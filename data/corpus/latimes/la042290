Who hasn't at some time been intrigued by ants? Even while cursing their 
invasion of the pantry, we admire the lone scout hurrying along with the news, 
or the knot of workers conveying a single crumb across the unprotected 
wasteland of a kitchen floor. But I was unaware until I read "The Ants" that 
colonies range from those with only 50 workers to colonies whose populations 
exceed hundreds of thousands, even a million individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the world's myrmecologists -- that is, students of the 8,000-odd members 
of the family Formicidae (ants) in the order Hymenoptera (which also includes 
bees and wasps) -- perhaps none is as well known to the public as E. O. Wilson. 
With the publication of "Insect Societies" in 1971 and then "Sociobiology" in 
1976, Wilson announced that evolutionary biology has theoretical implications 
that go beyond the anthill. There are echoes of both of these earlier books in 
"The Ants," which Wilson has written with his colleague Bert Holldobler. 
</P>
<P>
In "Insect Societies," Wilson discussed the evolution of insects from presocial 
beetles to the eusocial hives and mounds of ants, bees, wasps and termites that 
have sometimes been described as "superorganisms." Ants epitomize this kind of 
community in which several generations overlap, and individuals are divided 
into specialized castes that cooperate in producing and raising the young. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, Wilson observed that many of his theories would only be proved with 
the reconstruction of the full colonial system in vitro, in the laboratory, 
which was an impossibility 20 years ago. Since then, however, procedures to 
isolate and expose individual ants to synthetic sounds and smells have become 
routine, and what was then theory is now experimentally verified. Wilson and 
fellow entomologists have reared isolated ants, honey bees and termite larvae 
and determined their caste by an appropriate manipulation of food and hormones. 
</P>
<P>
Sociobiology as a scientific method has weathered stormy debates, many provoked 
by Wilson's insistence that the kind of reductionism that successfully explains 
insect behavior as a predictable response in relatively simple animals like 
ants can be applied to higher vertebrates, like ourselves. Over the last 15 
years, the analysis of kinship relations and investment strategies within 
species has become one of the most sophisticated areas of evolutionary biology. 
In "The Ants," Holldobler and Wilson describe the measured investment by adult 
ants in the survival of their offspring, using what they admit are value-laden 
words such as altruism to explain the intricate and varied ways that colonies 
respond to environmental change. 
</P>
<P>
But why write an entire book just about ants? 
</P>
<P>
Because ants are crucial participants in the ecological systems of all of our 
fragile forests and, even more than earthworms, are nature's leading soil 
turners. We need to know as much as we can about them as we race to save the 
ecological balance of this planet. 
</P>
<P>
On another level, as the culmination of insect evolution, ants can explain a 
lot about how evolution works. Different species of ants have evolved ways to 
enslave each other, to "domesticate" a species of aphid, which they herd and 
"milk" for honeydew, to organize military campaigns against their neighbors. 
They are able to achieve these complicated systems through complex forms of 
chemical communication and through the evolution of altruism, the apparent 
trade-off of individual sacrifice for the welfare of the colony. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ants" is a beautiful volume, with hundreds of line drawings and colored 
plates. It is an encyclopedia of ants, containing lists and descriptions, a 
glossary and a complete bibliography in addition to histories and discussions 
of the relationships within ant communities and between ant species, as well as 
symbiosis with other insects and with plants. 
</P>
<P>
For the novitiate, there are clear, detailed descriptions of the body parts, 
along with an explanation of their functions. There is also, at the conclusion 
(by which time the authors are secure in having made a number of converts), a 
guide for the novice in how to collect and set up ant colonies or farms. They 
mention how the late Harlow Shapley, a famous astronomer and amateur ant 
collector, found a rare ant while dining with Stalin in the Kremlin, placed it 
in vodka, and brought it back to the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard, 
where it is still on display. 
</P>
<P>
For the professional, there are judicious explanations of the rival theories of 
"kin selection" (in which individuals are apparently willing to make sacrifices 
for those very close to themselves genetically, like a sister) and "parental 
manipulation" (the suggestion that parents willingly exploit some of their 
children for the perceived larger good of the next generation) to explain why 
some individual ants are apparently willing to forgo their own reproductive 
option to provide for their mothers and sisters. 
</P>
<P>
For pundits interested in the roles of the sexes in evolution, there is 
dramatic evidence that females guide and dominate ant populations: "The ant 
colony is an almost exclusively female society, with the males remaining in the 
nest only until the time of their invariably fatal nuptial flight." Most 
colonies have a single queen (although there are some with more) that 
determines the assignments of the workers, all female, in regards to nourishing 
and protecting the next generation they are preparing for life cycles of their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
Aging workers of Australia's green tree ants emigrate to special "barrack 
nests" at the territorial boundary of the colony, the first line of defense 
when workers from neighboring nests invade. This stimulated Holldobler to note: 
"It can be said that a principal difference between human beings and ants is 
that whereas we send our young men to war, they send their old ladies." 
</P>
<P>
The recent discovery of eusocial life in a rare, burrow-dwelling African 
mammal, the naked mole-rat, puts the question of these "super-organisms" in a 
new light. The similarity between mole-rats and ants suggests that insects and 
vertebrates may have more in common than zoologists once thought.

the workers respond much more aggressively to fire and thief ants of the genus 
Solenopsis (gray) than to other kinds of ants. After contacting fire-ant 
workers near the nest, minor workers of Pheidole run back and forth to the 
nest, dragging the tips of their abdomens over the ground to lay odor trails 
(depicted in upper left). The trail pheromone attracts both minor and major 
workers to the battle ground. The majors are especially effective in destroying 
the invaders, which they chop to pieces with their powerful, clipper-like 
mandibles. Some of the Pheidole are themselves crippled or killed by the venom 
of the fire ants. From the book; drawing by S. Landry.

WAR STORIES FROM ECOLOGY'S ARCHDRUID; 
</P>
<P>
FOR EARTH'S SAKE: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF DAVID BROWER BY DAVID BROWER (GIBBS 
SMITH: $24.95; 527 PP., ILLUSTRATED) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David M. Graber, Graber is a research biologist with the National Park 
Service. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dave Brower is America's most charismatic conservationist. Some say -- I among 
them -- that he has accomplished more through the force of one man's will than 
any of his breed since John Muir. At age 77, he leads the pack for the title of 
America's most arrogant, opinionated, pig-headed and autocratic conservationist 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
Brower is never dull. This man John McPhee so aptly dubbed nature's "Archdruid" 
has been trying, by his own admission, to produce an autobiography for years. 
"For Earth's Sake" is half the loaf, revved up to make the Earth Day 
publication tie-in; Part II is scheduled for fall. 
</P>
<P>
What Brower offers is mostly recycled essays from his years of editorializing 
for the Sierra Club Bulletin and Friends of the Earth's Not Man Apart, spliced 
with contemporary annotation and transition. Another environmental curmudgeon, 
Edward Abbey, used the same recycling trick time after time and got away with 
it for the same reason that Brower will in "For Earth's Sake": It's damned good 
material. Pieces dating back more than 40 years will now find a larger audience 
than Sierra Club historians. 
</P>
<P>
Brower grew up in Berkeley, where his father taught at the university. The 
unspoiled hills and streams behind campus were his introduction to nature, and 
some of Berkeley's larger boulders his initiation into climbing. For all I 
know, Brower's ascents of Founder's Rock may have marked the founding of that 
city's renown for its mountaineers and rock climbers. He was an avid butterfly 
collector, and made his acquaintance with scientific terminology, population 
biology, and ecology in that way. By age 6, he was car-camping with his family 
in the Sierra Nevada. Brower also loved fast cars: His claimed record of 3 
hours 25 minutes from Yosemite to Berkeley in a 1934 Plymouth nearly matches my 
own reckless time on modern wheels and freeways! 
</P>
<P>
Brower failed in one area about which he is still sensitive: He dropped out of 
UC Berkeley as a youth and never did graduate from college. That failure may 
have catalyzed Brower's view of himself -- despite his fame -- as outsider, and 
initiated his chronic distrust of experts, especially governmental ones. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Sierra Club that focused Brower's unformed conservation and provided 
his first and most important platform. He returned the favor by molding a local 
nature and outdoor club into a sophisticated and powerful nationwide force for 
conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Dams loom large in Brower's legend, and they were the anvil on which Brower 
hammered the club into a modern social force. Preceding Brower, the damming of 
Yosemite's Hetch-Hetchy Valley had ripped the nascent Sierra Club apart. When 
the wounds had healed, the legend of Hetch-Hetchy gave the club the courage to 
oppose damming the Kings River, and gave us Kings Canyon National Park instead. 
</P>
<P>
Imminent drowning of Dinosaur National Monument by the proposed Echo Park dam 
and reservoir in 1954 fully brought out Brower's immense talent at writing, 
speech making and playing politics. For the first time, he ruthlessly dragged 
agencies such as the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corp of Engineers into 
the public arena and damned them. 
</P>
<P>
A few years later, in a bid to appear more conciliatory and in dire fear of 
losing the Grand Canyon itself, the club and Brower traded away Glen Canyon 
Dam. It was a terrible mistake, says Brower: "I asked Dave Brower why he just 
sat, and have continued to ask him. He has no answer. . . . It was not that he 
had not heard, from those who knew, how beautiful Glen Canyon was. It was not 
that he thought Glen Canyon Dam was necessary, because he knew it was not. . . 
. " 
</P>
<P>
Those were heady years. By way of expiation, the Sierra Club published an 
exhibit format book about Glen Canyon: "The Place No One Knew." Brower: " . . . 
the moral is simple: Progress need not deny to the people their inalienable 
right to be informed and to choose. In Glen Canyon the people never knew what 
the choices were. Next time, in other stretches of the Colorado, on other 
rivers that are still free, and wherever there is wildness that can be part of 
our civilization instead of victim to it, the people need to know before a 
bureau's elite decide to wipe out what no one can replace." Not blind 
opposition to progress, but opposition to blind progress. 
</P>
<P>
When flooding Grand Canyon became an issue again, Brower was ready with another 
book, "Time and the River Flowing: Grand Canyon." Full-page ads in major 
newspapers were the next weapon Brower tried. The ads brought waves of new 
members to the Sierra Club, people who joined for conservation rather than 
hiking company, and they cost the club its tax-exempt status. 
</P>
<P>
By no means all who experienced the transition were grateful. In 1969, 
revolution completed, the Sierra Club fired Brower as executive director and 
premier -- an episode which Brower headlines "How the Sierra Club Misuses Power 
and Talent, or How to Avoid the Four-Letter B-Word (BOLD)." The club is so 
eager to appear reasonable that it goes soft, undercuts the strong grass-roots 
efforts of chapters, groups and other organizations -- as if the new 
professionalization and prioritization require rampant tenderization. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, Brower created Friends of the Earth in his own radical image. 
Scarcely a decade later, a mature and successful organization, FOE would 
likewise toss out Brower. FOE could no longer function as his fief. Today, 
Brower's mouthpiece is Earth Island Institute. 
</P>
<P>
In his eighth decade, Brower is utterly unbowed. A few years back he was among 
the first to back Interior Secretary Hodel's proposal to drain Hetch-Hetchy. 
The conservation groups were late and weak in supporting it, not trusting Hodel 
and his motives. "The city's total revenue from power from its Hetch-Hetchy 
project's origin until now has far exceeded the cost of the facilities to 
produce it," he writes, "and that excess has in effect been a free ride for San 
Francisco at a substantial cost to the people who have been denied the 
intangible benefits of Hetch- Hetchy Valley for all these years. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not talking about just 'a campground,' as Mayor Feinstein is reported 
to have described Hetch-Hetchy. We are talking about an integral part of a 
national park that belongs not to San Francisco, not to California, not to the 
United States but to the world as part of the World Heritage. San Francisco 
owes us this one. It took Hetch- Hetchy under false pretenses in the first 
place. The city claimed that no other site would do, and that was false. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Brower's whimsy and casual approach to facts, his assumption that agency 
employees are Philistine can be maddening. At times, Brower is simply 
inexplicable. For some perverse reason of his own, he credits improvements in 
Yosemite Valley to the Curry Co., fabled in profit margin, rather than to his 
much benighted National Park Service, which has fought Curry to reduce the 
traffic and its impact. 
</P>
<P>
Brower once lived in Yosemite Valley for three years, working for Yosemite Park 
and Curry Co. He was fired by the company, yet is "impressed by its managers' 
concern for the valley. Even more so now, as I marvel at the genius with which 
the impact of 6 million human feet is kept to a minimum." 
</P>
<P>
I don't know what we would have done without him.

THE HOUSE OF NOMURA: THE INSIDE STORY OF THE LEGENDARY JAPANESE FINANCIAL 
DYNASTY BY ALBERT J. ALLETZHAUSER (ARCADE: $22.95; 304 PP.; 1-55970-089-0) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jeffrey E. Garten, Garten, a managing director of The Stamford Company, an 
investment banking firm in New York, was in charge of Shearson Lehman Hutton in 
Tokyo, 1984-1986. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is midday on Oct. 20, 1987, in Tokyo and panic is rampant. Wall Street has 
just experienced its biggest decline since 1929, and the effects are spreading 
across the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Top officials of Japan's four most powerful securities firms, led by Nomura 
Securities, are having lunch at the Ministry of Finance. Quiet words are 
exchanged, tacit understandings reached. Later that day, the Big Four go into 
the market and begin buying stocks en masse. The plunge in Japanese stocks is 
arrested. Soon the hemorrhaging slows in London and New York. A financial 
catastrophe is barely averted, thanks to the exercise of raw and deliberate 
Japanese financial power. 
</P>
<P>
So begins "The House of Nomura," the saga of a small money-changing business 
that started in 1872 in Osaka and became not only the world's largest 
securities firm but the most profitable financial company anywhere (with 
estimated profits for this last year of $1.5 billion according to the Wall 
Street Journal). It became not only the investment bank that trades 20% of all 
stocks and bonds in Japan but also the owner of the largest commercially funded 
research institute in the world. And it became not only Japan's second-largest 
software company, but also its fifth biggest real-estate operation. 
</P>
<P>
Written by an American stockbroker who worked in Tokyo, and based on extensive 
interviewing of the Nomura family and the firm's executives, the story of the 
financial empire encompasses, in the first instances, many colorful 
personalities. 
</P>
<P>
The House of Nomura began its ascent in 1905 when the founder's son, Tokushichi 
Nomura, made an investment in a textile firm that was rumored to be near 
bankruptcy. After careful research, Nomura learned that the firm was indeed 
healthy but that speculators were spreading lies to drive down the price of its 
shares. He also felt that the future of the spinning business was bright, and 
he sensed a strong stock market down the road. He bought into the textile group 
in time to catch the 1906 bull market, making his first fortune. 
</P>
<P>
One year later, with Japanese stock exchanges booming, Nomura had a strong 
intuition that the good times were ending. While others were buying feverishly, 
he was quietly selling and taking positions that allowed him to capitalize on 
price declines. Sure enough, when Japan was rocked by the crash of 1907, Nomura 
pocketed his second fortune. Having started with almost nothing, he had amassed 
more than $60 million, in today's dollars, before he was 30. He then went on to 
build a broad-based conglomerate composed of banks, securities firms and 
trading companies -- all of which survived and grew until World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Another legend was Minoru Segawa. Overweight and hard-drinking, he started as a 
stock salesman in the Nomura trenches in 1929 and rose to become the firm's top 
operating manager in 1948. Segawa was a gambler and speculator, a metaphor for 
the rough and chaotic stock markets in which he grew up. From the beginning, 
according to author Albert J. Alletzhauser, Minoru saw opportunities to 
manipulate stock markets for Nomura and friends by spreading false information 
and anticipating effects on prices. Thanks to him, Nomura reaped large profits 
in the aftermath of World War II in the black market for currency -- an 
important element in the firm's survival. 
</P>
<P>
There was Tsunao Okumura, a rich and lazy playboy who rose to be the firm's 
president after the war. Okumura was to symbolize the close link between money 
and politics. After the war, for example, he set up a movie house, receiving 
exorbitant prices for tickets to what was the only diversion the Japanese had 
from their devastated lives. With his profits, he provided food and geishas for 
Japan's financially impoverished but politically powerful politicians, many of 
whom would return the favor one day. Among those in his debt was Sigeru 
Yoshida, then prime minister, and his finance minister, Hayato Ikeda -- 
critical players in Japan's postwar recovery. 
</P>
<P>
"The House of Nomura" is more than a parade of characters. Alletzhauser shows 
how the ebb and flow of events in Japan affected the brokerage firm. Japan's 
victory over Russia in the war of 1905, for example, made it an industrial and 
military power and opened up major opportunities for Nomura. The earthquake of 
1923 resulted in widespread devastation, but it also led to Nomura's lucrative 
participation in the flotation of massive amounts of government-backed 
reconstruction bonds. World War I, in which Japan provided supplies to England 
and France, created another boom for Nomura. 
</P>
<P>
But the most significant period in the firm's history was 1939 to 1953, World 
War II and its aftermath. According to Alletzhauser, Nomura researchers were 
quietly predicting Japan's defeat as early as 1942. Before the end of the war, 
much of the House of Nomura's wealth was stashed away in various subsidiaries 
and records of transfer destroyed. After the Japanese surrender, the Nomura 
conglomerate was stripped of its banking and trading arms, and the Nomura 
family and top executives were purged. Only the securities firm and various 
subsidiaries were allowed to continue as the House of Nomura. 
</P>
<P>
How did the firm survive and recover from Japan's defeat during a period in 
which starvation was widespread, telephones didn't work and the Tokyo Stock 
Exchange was turned into a gym for American GIs? In the beginning there was the 
black market. Then came a massive campaign to donate small wooden boxes called 
Ryo Savings Chests -- piggy banks, really -- in Japanese houses all over the 
country. The keys were held by Nomura salesmen. When the boxes were full, 
Nomura would be called, and the money would be emptied and exchanged for 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Another important milestone was government permission -- the result of 
Okumura's political ties -- for Nomura to manage the first postwar mutual 
funds. Nomura Securities was tapping into personal savings as they were 
beginning to grow. As it built its client base -- house by house, community by 
community -- its financial power soared. 
</P>
<P>
"The House of Nomura" reveals Japan's securities markets as rife with all 
manner of inside trading and market manipulation. When this book was released 
in London earlier this year, Nomura sued the author and his British publisher 
for defamation. No doubt it objected to descriptions such as those of how 
Nomura once used in-house knowledge of an upcoming decline in the price of 
Honda's stock to protect its own positions and those of favored clients at the 
expense of its other customers. Alletzhauser tells another story of how Nomura 
once pumped up the price of the stock of Mitsubishi Heavy Industry in order to 
win a role as its financial adviser, enriching a variety of its friends in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond recounting specific deals and transgressions, the author explains how 
very low in the hierarchy of professions stockbrokers traditionally have stood 
in Japan, thanks to their image as unprincipled gamblers and their alleged 
association with gangster groups. He discusses, too, features of the Japanese 
system -- such as extremely low dividends and low taxes on capital appreciation 
-- that work to push stock prices up and up, well beyond any reasonable 
intrinsic value. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Alletzhauser writes about The Nomura Man, the regimented salesman who 
lives and acts like a foot soldier for a highly organized army devoted to 
selling stocks from daybreak to midnight. The drab dormitories for single men, 
the humiliation of not meeting sales quotas and the intense pressure to conform 
and perform at all levels are vividly described in many anecdotes. 
</P>
<P>
Since the research for "The House of Nomura" was completed, a political scandal 
involving stock-market abuses brought down two governments in Tokyo. In the 
last few months, moreover, Japan's stock markets have gone into a tailspin, 
losing nearly 25% of their total value, with economic consequences for Japan 
and the world that no one can yet foresee. 
</P>
<P>
When the dust settles, the Japanese securities industries may be subject to the 
biggest wave of reforms since the American occupation. Whatever happens, 
however, Nomura will still be Japan's major securities company, and 
Alletzhauser has given an American audience an extremely readable and important 
starting point for understanding the firm and the milieu in which it operates.

THE HOUSE OF MORGAN: AN AMERICAN BANKING DYNASTY AND THE RISE OF MODERN FINANCE 
BY RON CHERNOW (ATLANTIC MONTHLY PRESS/A MORGAN ENTREKIN BOOK: $29.95; 812 PP.; 
0-87113-3385) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Rothchild, Rothchild, author of A Fool and His Money (Penguin), is 
working on a book about the Campeau debacle for Simon &amp; Schuster. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bankers have never been popular and are often blamed for everything. In the 
last century, several states actually banned bankers, the way they might outlaw 
nude dancers or firecracker salesmen today. Texas didn't lift its ban on 
bankers until 1904. (Note: Given the number of bank and S&amp;L fraud cases 
currently pending, perhaps Texas should reconsider.) 
</P>
<P>
For their part, bankers have done their best to be as secretive, aloof and 
uncommunicative with the general public as possible. This was certainly true of 
the Morgans, which explains why it's taken so long for the remarkable history 
of Junius, Pierpont and Jack to come out. But come out it has -- all the juicy 
gossip about Pierpont and his unfortunate nose, his womanizing, his campaigning 
to cover up nude statues, his consulting with astrologers, the stuff you'd have 
read in the tabloids if bankers talked. 
</P>
<P>
(It seems that bankers have been far more faithful to the code of silence than 
the Mafia has, given the number of Mafia tell-all books that are published. The 
champion of bankers' omerta, Ron Chernow tells us, is Pierpont's pal, George 
Baker, of the First National, the sphinx of Wall Street, who gave no interviews 
between 1863 and 1923.) 
</P>
<P>
Although we're more inclined to think of the Kennedys and the Rockefellers as 
America's dynastic rulers, the quieter Morgans can lay better claim to the 
title. Their bank propped up foreign governments, financed both world wars, ran 
most of the nation's railroads, served as a private Federal Reserve, and 
meddled continuously in politics. Consequently, Chernow has written more than a 
book about a bank. It's also as informative and entertaining a history, 
especially of the period from 1880-1930, as this reviewer has read. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning with the 1830s, when a bond broker named George Peabody invited an 
enthusiastic unknown, Junius Morgan, to share in his enterprise, Chernow takes 
us through the fantastic developments that propelled the Morgans into great 
riches and made them the Protestant equivalents of the famous Rothschilds 
(alas, no relation to yours truly). 
</P>
<P>
The business was handed soon enough from Junius to his only son, the 
bulbous-nosed Pierpont, who obviously inherited the money gene. Pierpont chewed 
on big cigars, growled yes or no answers to terrified subordinates, interpreted 
every story in the Bible literally, and as mentioned above, entertained a 
succession of ladies on his yacht. He was the model, in other words, for the 
perfect modern banker. 
</P>
<P>
It was Pierpont who took the Morgan bank into the 20th Century, loaned out 
fabulous sums at home and abroad, rescued governments and corporations from 
bankruptcy, and had numerous run-ins with the trust-busting Teddy Roosevelt, 
who Chernow says was much more friend than foe. Pierpont and Teddy, enemies in 
the textbooks, turn out to have been "secret blood brothers" who shared deep 
philosophical affinities. The bitterest Morgan foe, in fact, may have been the 
pro-business William Howard Taft. 
</P>
<P>
The Pierpont era ended with his death in 1913; the business was handed over to 
his only son, Jack. High-strung, defensive and openly xenophobic, Jack Morgan 
brought out the bank's muted WASP prejudices, supporting Henry Ford's campaign 
against "hyphenated Americans" and vilifying Germans and Jews alike. He 
believed that people were out to get him, which some apparently were. He 
survived one stabbing and a letter bomb that was returned to sender due to 
insufficient postage. 
</P>
<P>
It was during the Jack Morgan era that Tom Lamont, a bank partner who served as 
a de facto secretary of state, took on the difficult task of defending two of 
the Morgans' most important international clients: Mussolini and the emperor of 
Japan. Lamont even took to writing press releases for Il Duce in order to 
persuade the American public that (1) Mussolini was a nice guy; (2) the 
invasion of Ethiopia was a happy event, akin to America's own push westward 
through the wilderness. Of Hitler, Lamont once said the only good thing about 
the man was his "wholesome" attitude toward Jews, and on the eve of Pearl 
Harbor, he blithely announced: "I may be 100 percent mistaken but I am not 
worried about the Far East." 
</P>
<P>
Lamont is only one example of how the Morgans became increasingly isolated from 
reality as the 20th Century progressed, and a reminder of why bankers probably 
should be restrained from conducting foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the economic front, nowhere has our tenuous financial system been 
better described than by Chernow, as he recounts how the Morgan bankers face 
one panic or crash or crisis after another. In the crash of 1883, the panic of 
1901, the crash of 1907, the emergency shutdown of the stock exchange in 1914, 
etc., there are many parallels to our current banking dilemmas. It's both 
reassuring and unsettling to discover that the excesses of the 1980s are 
nothing new: 
</P>
<P>
Mergers and acquisitions? There was a merger and acquisition mania in 1899. 
</P>
<P>
Bank failures? Six hundred banks failed in 1893 and hundreds more in 1932. 
</P>
<P>
Hostile takeovers? When the celebrated Jay Gould tried to raid a railroad owned 
by a Joseph Ramsey, two trainloads of henchmen representing each side collided 
in a dark tunnel, the survivors started shooting at one another, and the 
militia was called out. This is one technique Henry Kravis and the Coniston 
Partners haven't tried. 
</P>
<P>
Stupid loans to Latin America? In what seems to be a case of recurring amnesia, 
the U.S. banks make this mistake every fifth decade. It was the 1820s when the 
first round of Latin American loans defaulted; then, in the 1870s, more big 
loans produced the same result. In 1920, the banks got wise and sold Latin 
American bonds to thousands of small investors, who took most of the losses for 
that round, but in 1970, the banks once again risked their own capital to the 
tune of $3 billion that they'll never see again. 
</P>
<P>
Surely in 2020 these latest defaults will have been forgotten and we'll have 
the next Latin American debt crisis, unless of course the bankers remember what 
they've read in this book. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Boesky, the Wall Street crook? How about Richard Whitney, no less than the 
president of the New York Stock Exchange in the early 1930s, whose shady 
dealings landed him in Sing Sing. 
</P>
<P>
Public hearings to straighten out the latest investment mess? These have become 
a regular fact of Wall Street life. There were the 1905 hearings on abuses of 
life-insurance companies that squandered the policyholders' money on fancy 
parties and houses of mirth. There were the 1912 Pujo hearings on banking 
abuses, at which Pierpont himself was forced to testify. Two decades later, 
Jack Morgan took the oath at the Pecora hearings, and more or less reiterated 
what his father had said. 
</P>
<P>
(At the Pecora hearings, it was disclosed that officers at the National City 
Bank, just prior to declaring the institution bankrupt, lent themselves $2.4 
million, interest-free, from a special "morale" fund. Is this where Drexel got 
the idea?) 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, thanks to the Glass-Steagall Act and other restrictions on bankers, 
the Morgans lost their preeminence, and the firm was forced to split into 
Morgan Stanley, the investment house, and J. P. Morgan, the commercial house. 
Later, the J. P. Morgan branch merged with Guaranty Trust to form the Morgan 
Guaranty we have today. 
</P>
<P>
All of the gentlemen's agreements on which bankers conducted business in the 
early 1900s were long since abrogated, until by the 1980s, the bankers were 
happily cutting each other's throats. Recently, the last taboo, "Thou shalt not 
mount a hostile raid against another bank," was violated when Morgan Stanley 
aided the Bank of New York in its assault on Irving Trust. Pierpont, Chernow 
says, would have been horrified. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt, today's bankers would like us all to remember that in the 
not-too-distant past, their generous colleague, Pierpont, bailed out the city 
of New York, and also the federal government. This should make us feel a bit 
more sympathetic in the present crisis, when the government must return the 
favor and all of us must bail out the banks.

Photo, John Pierpont Morgan photographed by Edward Steichen, 1903. Steichen 
wrote in his 1963 book "A Life in Photography" that he had suggested a position 
for Morgan's head and hands, irritating the impatient multimillionaire. It was 
the irritation, however, that created the portrait moment: "His expression had 
sharpened and his body posture became tense. . . . I saw that a dynamic 
self-assertion had taken place, whatever its cause, and I quickly made the 
second exposure, saying 'Thank you, Mr. Morgan,' as I took the plate holder out 
of the camera. He said, 'Is that all?' 'Yes, sir,' I answered." What many have 
seen as a knife in Morgan's hand is actually the polished arm of his chair. ;

who blamed everyone else for her husband's ineptitude. They will need more than

Our hats are off to anyone who can survive two terms in a 20th-Century 
presidency and then go out and make a few honest millions by communicating 
effectively. Your writer criticizes Reagan as though he retired from the 
monarchy or papacy. Remember capitalism? Freedom? The pursuit of happiness?

REAGAN'S FALL

<TEXT>
<P>
In May of last year I was privileged to be in attendance at one of President 
Reagan's "private sector speeches" and feel compelled to let you know the 
reaction to his speech by a representative group of tax-paying Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Quite simply, we loved him. 
</P>
<P>
He did again what no journalist and very few politicians can do; he made us 
feel enormously proud to be Americans. He summarized the many problems facing 
our nation while encouraging each of us, in our own way, to meet these 
challenges. He was bright, articulate, positive and, excuse the term, 
inspirational. 
</P>
<P>
We know he's not perfect; we understand the implications of budget and trade 
deficits as well as anyone, and in spite of these insights, we still love the 
man. Amazing? Not really. We just don't expect any more out of Ronald Reagan 
than we do of ourselves.

Photo, "I have never heard a mountain lion bawling over the fate of his soul," 
environmentalist writer Charles Bowden quotes Edward Abbey in his foreword to 
photographer Mark Gaede's "Images From the Great West" (Chaco Press, 5218 Donna 
Maria Lane, La Canada, Calif. 91011: $35 cloth, $24.95 paper). Gaede's vision 
offers dramatic panoramas (like this view of Judith Landing on the Missouri 
River, Mont.) as well as close scrutiny in photos of rock paintings ("Grizzly 
Bear, Crow Indian petroglyph, Montana"), inscriptions from forgotten travelers 
("James Bridger, 1844, trapper") and portraits of Western writers (Norman 
Maclean, Thomas McGuane). An essay by A. B. Guthrie Jr. is accompanied by a 
tribute from Abbey and quotations from Guthrie's novels -- "The Big Sky," "Fair 
Land, Fair Land," "The Way West."

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: SAVE THE PLANET 750 EVERYDAY WAYS YOU CAN HELP CLEAN UP 
THE EARTH BY DIANE MACEACHERN (DELL: $9.95; 210 PP.)

<P>
In celebration of Earth Day (which is today, in case the Book Review happens to 
be the reader's first exposure to the media in the past week), publishers are 
releasing a flotilla of books (see also Just Released in Paper, Page 8) that 
offer practical advice for cleaning up our acts, our homes, our communities, 
our cities, our planet. But don't lament the felling of trees for the sake of 
this competition; these books are far less redundant than the garden variety of 
copycat publishing. While the actual advice proffered may overlap, the tone 
varies considerably, and, happily for the ecological movement, there seems to 
be an approach to suit every possible environmental offender, a description 
from which none of us are exempt. 
</P>
<P>
Diane MacEachern's "Save Our Planet" is a bouncy, energetic compilation of 
ideas designed to be implemented easily in any family. The short-entry style of 
presentation is combined with lots of graphics -- charts, boxes, lists -- so 
that there are absolutely no pages merely gray with text. This approach won't 
tax even the shortest attention span. Far from talking down to her audience, 
however, the author writes with great directness, simplicity and economy, as if 
to say that some issues are too important to clutter up with either technical 
jargon or cutesy PR talk. 
</P>
<P>
MacEachern's introductory chapter, "The Planet in Peril," is an excellent 
concise introduction to the major threats to the environment. (The author has 
served the Earth Day 1990 team as national communications consultant and 
formerly worked with Sierra Club in the same capacity.) The 750 ideas for 
cleaning up the planet are divided into areas where the plans can be put into 
practice: in the home, in the garden, at school, at the office, at the 
supermarket, on vacation. The text is punctuated with inserted tips under such 
labels as "Bright Ideas"; the book is not without humor, either, witness the 
corresponding category, "Not Such a Bright Idea." Sonja Bolle

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: DESIGN FOR A LIVABLE PLANET HOW YOU CAN CLEAN UP THE

<TEXT>
<P>
"Design for a Livable Planet" takes much more a reader's approach than 
MacEachern's family-friendly book. Jon Naar puts environmentalist efforts in a 
political and social context, sprinkling his chapters liberally with historical 
observations ("Drinking-water pollution is at least as old as the Roman Empire, 
when aqueducts were poisoned by lead leaching from the pipes") and quotes (from 
Tom Lehrer's song, "Pollution": "You can use the latest toothpaste, then rinse 
your mouth with industrial waste"). 
</P>
<P>
The book is filled with ideas for practical change on the individual level, but 
Naar really wants to drive home the point that the protection of the planet is 
too important to be left to bureaucracies, corporations and government 
agencies. To this end, he divides his book into issues and explains how the 
reader can use their Green consumer power and join existing grass-roots groups 
intent on influencing public policy. Sonja Bolle

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: MOON PALACE BY PAUL AUSTER (PENGUIN: $7.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An odd, claustrophobic novel about a passive young man who stumbles onto the 
mystery of his ancestry through a series of bizarre coincidences. 
</P>
<P>
Marco Stanley Fogg's commitment to inaction eventually reduces him to sleeping 
in Central Park and eating out of garbage cans. Paul Auster's evocations of the 
rituals with which the homeless fill their hours constitute the most compelling 
writing in the book. 
</P>
<P>
Rescued from life in the park by his friends, Fogg discovers a convoluted 
family history involving a decaying artist, his son and his grandson -- a set 
of interlocking stories so wildly improbable that they seem credible. Auster's 
daft, illogical logic makes this novel curiously readable.

OUT IN THE middle of nowhere, due east of Brawley in the bosom of the Imperial 
Sand Dunes, it is plain to see. This is what the battle is all about. 
</P>
<P>
A two-lane ribbon of asphalt known as California 78 slices through the towering 
dunes, forming a line of unmistakable demarcation. North of the roadway is 
seamless sand, stretching in undulating, dun-colored swells. Closed to 
vehicles, the terrain is graced with clumps of green and gold dune grass, 
creosote bush and an occasional silver-leafed sunflower. The only marks are the 
boot prints of desert wanderers and the faint tracks of a coyote or kangaroo 
rat. A silence broken gently by the wind cloaks this empty place, a stillness 
perfect for reflection. 
</P>
<P>
The picture changes markedly just south of the highway. Here, all manner of 
vehicles are welcome, and the land is mostly barren. With the dunes' fertile 
mantle of soil churned loose by the fat, knobby tires of off-road vehicles, the 
only plant survivors are lonesome tufts of bursage and Mormon tea, which cling 
to hummocks carved by spinning wheels. There is not a pocket mouse in sight, 
but human life abounds. Helmeted riders astride two-, three- and four-wheeled 
machines zigzag across the dunes in a dizzying dance, kicking up thick wakes of 
sand as they go. 
</P>
<P>
The north side is protected as wilderness and treasured by hikers, 
photographers and others eager to explore it on foot. The south is a 
playground, treasured by thousands of weekend dune jockeys seeking a tonic for 
the stresses of the urban world. The contrast forms the grist for an unusually 
nasty and colorful war -- the struggle for control of the California desert. 
</P>
<P>
With most of the West's mountains and coasts and river valleys claimed and 
carved up, Southern Californians have come to covet the nearby desert's vast 
landscape of extremes. Imported water and air conditioning have made the desert 
habitable in comfort, even luxury. Reliable vehicles have made its most 
forbidding corners safe to explore. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, preservationists and off-road vehicle users have faced off in 
Congress, where U. S. Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and Rep. Mel Levine 
(D-Santa Monica) have introduced -- and reintroduced -- the California Desert 
Protection Act. The bill would answer environmentalists' worries about threats 
to desert plants and wildlife by tightening restrictions on the use of about 12 
million acres of public lands that are neither controlled by the U. S. military 
nor protected in existing parks and preserves. Off-roaders, however, view the 
proposed restrictions as an infringement on their right to explore and enjoy 
this last Western frontier. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome of past wilderness battles in Congress suggests a logical pattern 
for compromise. So the preservationists want to set aside 4 million acres as 
wilderness? The user groups argue for 2 million? Strike a bargain and settle on 
3 million. This fight, however, is so entrenched and so infused with anger that 
no such resolution is on the horizon. It is a struggle framed in terms that 
seem, at times, as stark as the landscape. 
</P>
<P>
EVEN 15 YEARS ago, few people went to the desert for recreation, and when they 
did, recalls Gerry Hillier, district director for the U. S. Bureau of Land 
Management, "it was basically one dune buggy, and it was Mom and Dad and the 
kids." The arid lands clearly have a new allure. On Presidents' Day weekend 
this year, 14,000 people swarmed the Imperial Sand Dunes, ignoring a cold 
February drizzle for the chance to, as one exhilarated vacationer described it, 
"get out and get crazy in the dirt." 
</P>
<P>
For these off-roaders, the spectacular mounds of sand that rise from the Yuha 
Desert in far southeast California are a beloved destination. Reaching peaks of 
300 feet, the dunes are the largest such sand mass in the state, stretching in 
a 5-mile-wide band from the Chocolate Mountains for 40 miles south to the 
Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
The dunes' southern portion is designated a "free play" zone by its caretaker, 
the Bureau of Land Management, making it open to anything and everything with 
wheels. There is no speed limit, and near collisions are common as riders, 
often hidden from view by ridges in the ever-changing dunes, hurtle along. 
Although state law requires that the machines be equipped with mufflers, the 
piercing, chain-saw-like whine of the engines is, in some areas, almost 
deafening. 
</P>
<P>
Flanking the dunes are campgrounds packed with recreational vehicles. Radios 
blare as those awaiting their turn on the all-terrain cycles sprawl in lawn 
chairs, nursing beers or sampling treats off the hibachi. This is a family 
affair, with some campsites encircled by fleets of cycles of all sizes. 
</P>
<P>
Dave McWilliams introduced his son, Mike, to the sport at age 2. McWilliams, a 
truck driver from Hesperia for whom riding all-terrain vehicles is "a great 
stress reliever," says his family spends "every weekend we can" at the dunes. 
It is "healthy recreation," he says, a wholesome activity for children and 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
"It becomes a social gathering," says Sam Bell of Long Beach, who runs an 
industrial plating business. "It's space," adds his wife, Dana, who says her 
life revolves to a great degree around cleaning up after the previous weekend's 
desert outing and organizing the next. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fantastic freedom for the kids," explains Dana, a legislative officer for 
the American Motorcyclist Assn., whose four children range in age from 5 to 11. 
"You don't have any drugs. Out there, we turn them loose. They're safe. They 
have a ball. You have to take children and find these opportunities. That's why 
the desert means so much to me. It's freedom and it's safe. . . . And it's 
being taken away from us." 
</P>
<P>
Although the most far-reaching desert protection proposals would leave much of 
the Imperial Dunes' and most other "free play" areas intact, it's the off-road 
vehicle owners who are leading the desert fight. Their protests can be heard 
most clearly -- and perhaps understood best -- at Oldsmobile Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Deep within the dunes, about 2 miles from a paved road, this formidable rise 
draws a crowd of 4,000 riders on busy days. Revving the engines of their steel 
machines, they circle at the dune's base, ready to roar up the steep face. 
</P>
<P>
The melange of vehicles ranges from the garden-variety ATV to custom-made dune 
buggies such as "Blue Thunder," a San Diego-based favorite that is capable of 
zooming up the incline at 100 m.p.h. -- on its rear wheels. "This is the place 
to see who's got real speed," says Henry Shorr, business manager of a plumbers' 
union in Alta Loma. 
</P>
<P>
Riders such as Shorr have invested thousands of dollars in ATVs and view the 
desert as a refuge, a place to fly across the sand, unfettered by signs, 
signals, laws or other urban restrictions. In this era of drugs, gangs and 
other family stresses, the riders plan to hold tight to this form of escape. 
The Cranston-Levine bill, they say, is a hostile threat. 
</P>
<P>
Although the off-roaders, whose political muscle appears to have grown 
significantly in recent years, are the most vocal participants in the desert 
fight, myriad other less-visible desert users view the measure as an invasion 
of their rights. Among them are sheep and cattle ranchers, miners and rock 
hounds who prowl for gems in the craggy crevices of the desert's mountain 
ranges. Companies that string electric, telephone and fiber-optic lines across 
the desert are nervous as well, and the burgeoning number of entrepreneurs 
tapping its bounty to produce wind, solar and geothermal energy also are on 
alert. 
</P>
<P>
The mining industry, in particular, has marshaled its forces and launched a 
spirited attack on the proposed legislation. The California desert has been 
prospected for more than a century, and today, about $1.2 billion worth of 
sand, gravel and minerals -- mostly borates, sodium and so-called rare earth 
elements, as well as gold -- are unearthed there annually, the U. S. Bureau of 
Mines reports. 
</P>
<P>
The Cranston-Levine bill would allow existing mining operations to continue and 
would respect valid mining claims that existed at the time the law took effect. 
But further exploration of mineral resources within the new national parks and 
wilderness areas would be prohibited. That angers industry geologists, who 
dispute conservationists' arguments that the desert's mineral reserves have 
been well documented -- and claimed -- through decades of prospecting. "The 
absence of evidence is not evidence of absence," says Charles Davis, manager of 
government affairs for U. S. Borax, which runs an open pit borate mine in 
Boron, near Edwards Air Force Base. Only 20% of the desert, Davis contends, has 
been investigated for ore deposits. "It's like them saying back in the 1890s, 
'Let's close the patent office. We've already invented everything.' " 
</P>
<P>
Equally passionate are the sheep and cattle ranchers who turn their herds and 
flocks loose under permits issued by the Bureau of Land Management. Grazing 
would continue in all bureau-administered wilderness areas under the Desert 
Protection Act, but ranchers with animals in proposed national parklands would 
be barred from returning after their permits expire. 
</P>
<P>
"Our ranching families are our heritage -- mine and yours -- and they are far 
more endangered than any desert is," says Marie Brashear of Fontana, who is 
coordinating opposition to the Cranston-Levine measure. "They pay taxes. They 
own property and they've got rights." 
</P>
<P>
Largely silent in the debate is the desert's biggest single tenant: the 
military. Defense installations occupy roughly 3.2 million acres of desert 
lands from the China Lake Naval Weapons Center near Ridgecrest on the north to 
the Chocolate Mountain Gunnery Range in Imperial County. The Army -- contending 
that it needs additional room for training sites -- wants still more, seeking 
to add 240,000 acres to Ft. Irwin near Barstow. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have challenged the expansion, noting that the land targeted for 
acquisition includes important habitat for the imperiled desert tortoise. But 
many desert users, particularly off-road vehicle riders, insist that their 
access to the land should not be unduly restricted because of an endangered 
desert shrub or animal. "You come out here after a windstorm and you can't see 
a thing," says Jeff Blosdale of Redondo Beach, gesturing at the mosaic of ATV 
tracks marking the Imperial Dunes. "It fixes itself." 
</P>
<P>
TODAY'S FIGHT is over land that nobody wanted for hundreds of years, a vast, 
seemingly sterile territory long associated with the vivid image of death. 
Indeed, at times, the federal government literally could not give the desert 
away. Millions of acres were free for the taking under a series of homestead 
laws starting in the 1860s, but much of it went unclaimed, appearing, no doubt, 
too forbidding for even the most enterprising settler. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly then, the desert went unspoken for when the National Park 
Service and U. S. Forest Service divvied up the most prized of America's 
natural areas -- Yellowstone, Yosemite, the Grand Canyon, the Sierra Nevada and 
the Rockies. In 1933, the Park Service adopted the desert's crown jewel, 
creating the 2-million-acre Death Valley National Monument, and three years 
later, the service protected 560,000 acres at Joshua Tree National Monument. 
But large amounts of desert remained unclaimed, with no a suitor to be found. 
</P>
<P>
In 1946, Congress created one -- the Bureau of Land Management. Awarded about 
340 million acres of federal real estate that included most of the West's 
desert, the BLM took as its mission a task quite unlike the 
preservationist-oriented charter of the Park Service: overseeing the "multiple 
use" of these forlorn, leftover lands. 
</P>
<P>
The BLM quickly became a solicitous landlord, leasing millions of acres of 
range to ranchers, miners, and oil and gas exploration companies. If the image 
of the national park ranger was one who wore a crisp green uniform and peaked 
campaign hat, the BLM fellow was the guy in jeans, a rumpled tan shirt and 
battered Stetson. His job, in the era between the end of World War II and 1976, 
was to simply cater to those who sought to use the desert for commercial gain. 
Although advised to watch for flagrant abuses such as overgrazing, the BLM was 
not charged with protecting the desert for the sake of the land itself. 
</P>
<P>
To environmentalists, this philosophy seemed like a crime, and by the 1970s 
they had begun amassing evidence to support their suspicion. Off-road vehicles 
-- sales of which exploded in the '70s -- were running roughshod over the 
desert's fragile crust, and marksmen were using tortoises and Joshua trees as 
targets. Poachers were preying on the desert's bighorn sheep, and vandals were 
plundering its prehistoric sites. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists, meanwhile, continued to unlock new windows on the desert's natural 
splendor. Through the years, their work revealed the desert as a cradle for a 
startling variety of life -- 1,836 species of plants, 420 birds, 94 mammals, 63 
reptiles, 43 fishes and 16 amphibians. Researchers documented 46 distinct land 
communities -- from riparian marsh to desert forest -- with many of them 
literally islands in the sky, worlds of animal and plant life that retreated to 
the mountaintops as the inland seas of the Ice Age shrank and evaporated. 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, cries lamenting damage to the desert reached a peak, and Congress -- 
sensitive to pressure from the politically potent environmental community -- 
passed the Federal Land Management Policy Act. That changed everything for the 
BLM. Suddenly, the agency had dual, often conflicting, objectives: Protect "the 
quality of scientific, scenic, historical, ecological . . . and archeological 
values" of the desert, Congress ordered, but allow users to have their fun as 
well. To stay true to this ethic, BLM officials were directed to draft a 
land-use plan for the desert. The subsequent effort was a landmark undertaking 
for the BLM, which had never dealt with issues such as preservation or 
wilderness protection. 
</P>
<P>
By 1980, the BLM plan -- the product of 100 community meetings, 40,000 public 
comments and $8 million in taxpayer money -- was complete. Although a flurry of 
lawsuits from some parties accompanied its birth, the majority of desert lovers 
regarded it as a compromise land-use plan that gave everyone -- wilderness 
supporters, rock collectors, off-road cyclists, miners, ranchers and just plain 
people -- a share of what the desert had to offer. 
</P>
<P>
For preservationists, however, the optimism that accompanied adoption of the 
document soon faded. In January, 1981, the Reagan Administration brought into 
office a dim view of strong federal land-use planning and a crusade to cut the 
domestic budget in favor of military spending. It could not have come at a 
worse time for the BLM's Hillier, who oversees the desert district from a 
Spartan office in Riverside. "We took about a 25% cut in personnel," Hillier 
remembers glumly. The BLM was forced to embark on its unprecedented management 
venture with only 20 rangers to patrol an area twice the size of Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
Preservationists could see that the staff cuts were hurting the BLM, but by 
1984 they were convinced that a lack of commitment to truly enforce the desert 
plan was the agency's bigger problem. The BLM, they argued, had not become the 
vigilant steward its leaders had promised that it would be. 
</P>
<P>
Topping the environmentalists' laundry list of complaints was the agency's 1982 
approval of a series of amendments to the plan that reduced by 400,000 acres 
the amount of land the BLM proposed to designate as wilderness. The amendments 
signaled "a retreat, a massive retreat from protection," Sierra Club leader 
Elden Hughes says. There were, he says, other atrocities. The Barstow-to-Las 
Vegas motorcycle race, a controversial annual event that had been canceled by 
the BLM in 1974, was inexplicably allowed to resume -- on a course that cut 
through desert tortoise habitat and a region being studied as possible 
wilderness. And, after failing to obtain a reclamation bond from operators of a 
mine in a wilderness study area in the Inyo Mountains, the BLM was forced to 
pay $25,000 to remove 20 drums of cyanide left behind when the mine was 
abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
By 1984, the preservationists were convinced the BLM lacked the will to enforce 
the desert plan. Unless the desert was appointed a new, more vigilant steward, 
preservationists concluded, the destructive forces bearing down upon it would 
leave only a tattered remnant for the ages. 
</P>
<P>
ELDEN HUGHES traces his love for the desert to 1938. He was a boy of 7 who 
caught his first glimpse of Death Valley during a family outing. The visit left 
a lasting impression. 
</P>
<P>
There was the towering Telescope Peak, looming 11,049 feet above sea level, and 
the fetid pond at Badwater, the lowest point in the United States -- at 282 
feet below sea level. There were sand dunes, seemingly endless salt pans and a 
quiet that seemed haunting to a child. And there was the odd, jagged ledge 
formed by an earthquake fault along the eastern edge of the valley floor. "I 
was a wee tad then," Hughes recalls, "but it was a memorable trip." 
</P>
<P>
And the first of many to come. Today, this Whittier resident is one of the 
desert's most ardent defenders, a self-described "wanderer" who rarely lets a 
month pass without traveling there. For Hughes, the desert provides a place for 
contemplation and exhilaration, for peace and inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
He might stand on the curl of a dune waiting for the light to shine just right 
on a blooming beavertail cactus he hopes to photograph. He might pack a lunch 
and prowl Caruthers and Keystone canyons in the New York Mountains, where 273 
species of plants create a stunning garden. Or he might inch quietly across a 
sunbaked bajada, hoping to fix his lens on an unsuspecting desert animal. 
</P>
<P>
"The special thing about the desert is its vastness, which gives you the 
feeling you're the first person there," says Hughes, a bear of a man with a 
silver beard. "If you stand in the Mid-Hills and look north to Telescope Peak 
and southwest to San Gorgonio and northeast to Mt. Charleston, you know there 
are works of man below -- a railroad, power lines -- but the desert is so vast 
you can't see them. That's what's special about the desert. It can swallow up 
the works of man." 
</P>
<P>
For another preservationist, Jim Dodson of Lancaster, the desert's magic lies 
in the ability of its inhabitants to survive what seem intolerable conditions. 
"You have to understand how marvelous it is that nature can provide these 
adaptation mechanisms that allow plants and animals to succeed in a land so hot 
and dry," says Dodson, budget officer for Edwards Air Force Base. "Until you 
see how much life there is, you won't really know the desert." 
</P>
<P>
To Hughes and Dodson, the desert is like a child -- precious, irreplaceable and 
vulnerable. And they are alarmed by what they see as random, often senseless, 
violence that is increasingly inflicted on its inhabitants and lands. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-eight varieties of plant, animal and insect life are threatened or 
endangered in the desert, they say. The most recent listing, just last month, 
was the lumbering desert tortoise, California's official state reptile. The 
tortoise seems to be dying out at a disturbing rate, in part because of 
predation and loss of habitat, but also because of disease. Its demise, many 
environmentalists say, is an ominous symbol of the desert's plight. 
</P>
<P>
Still, these men are realists. With Southern California's population at 16 
million and threatening to swell, they recognize that human impact on the 
region's emptiest playground is inevitable. The trouble is, they say, things 
have gone too far. The desert, Hughes says, "is in crisis. There are areas that 
are still true gems, but we need to save them, now." Otherwise, the elements of 
the desert that they cherish will be lost for good. 
</P>
<P>
The best candidate for the role of rescuer, conservationists believe, is the 
National Park Service. The BLM -- derisively referred to as the "Bureau of 
Livestock and Mining" by some detractors -- has failed to give the desert the 
protection it deserves, they say. And so, the Sierra Club, Wilderness Society 
and other groups have concluded that the desert's best parts should become 
parkland. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Cranston agreed and introduced the California Desert Protection Act. 
Together with a companion House measure sponsored by Levine, the proposal would 
set aside 4.5 million acres of wilderness, enlarge Death Valley and Joshua Tree 
national monuments and make them national parks, and transform the East Mojave 
Scenic Area into a new, 1.5-million-acre national park. 
</P>
<P>
Off-roaders and other critics angrily contend that the legislation would fence 
off the desert for an elite few, those fit enough to survey its wonders on 
foot. "Locked out," they argue, would be families with children or grandparents 
or disabled members unable to experience the desert's special places if denied 
the right to enter by vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
But advocates describe the plan as a compromise that shields the desert's most 
spectacular and pristine features while leaving plenty of territory open to 
military maneuvers, all types of motorized recreation, mining and other uses. 
Without it, they say, the desert's future looks bleak. 
</P>
<P>
"Man can trash the desert, and in places man has," Hughes says. "Without 
protection, we'll have nothing to pass on to future generations. Wouldn't that 
be a sin?" 
</P>
<P>
IN DEATH VALLEY Canyon, near the foot of Telescope Peak, lies a startling 
geologic formation, one that blends billion-year-old Precambrian rock with 
limestone and lava from the Tertiary period of mere millions of years ago. At a 
loss for any rational description, scientists labeled this formation "Chaos." 
It could serve as a geologic metaphor for the continuing debate over the 
desert, one in which the clash of extremes has created a seemingly immutable 
deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
When the BLM's first desert-use plan was submitted to departing Interior 
Secretary Cecil D. Andrus in December, 1980, the secretary asked what the 
people in California thought about it, recalls Hillier, one of its prime 
architects. About 10% hated it as too restrictive, 15% thought it was not tough 
enough and 75% generally supported it, Andrus was told. "That's good enough for 
me," he responded. "If you ever lie awake worrying about satisfying those 25% 
on the fringes, you'll never get anything done." 
</P>
<P>
But alas for Hillier, the vocal, often shrill, fringes of both sides still dog 
the BLM. And the difficulties of establishing the agency as a resource 
protector on par with the Forest Service or Park Service have locked him, too, 
in the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Wilderness legislation in the West always is a contentious issue, one usually 
reconciled only when both senators from the state involved compromise. But so 
far, Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) has refused to work out an agreement with 
Cranston and is not likely to do so as long as Wilson is running for governor 
of California. So the fight has moved to the Democrat-controlled House, where 
Levine has run into potent opposition led by Republican Rep. Jerry Lewis of 
Highlands, whose 35th Congressional District covers most of the San Bernardino 
County desert. An influential GOP leader, Lewis helped persuade the Reagan and 
Bush administrations to side with the BLM and oppose the Cranston-Levine plan. 
They support Lewis' bill, which essentially would ratify the present BLM desert 
plan into law. 
</P>
<P>
A key to the BLM campaign to hold onto the land it now controls is the argument 
that the East Mojave does not have the unique and significant resources that 
would qualify it as a new national park. In February, at Lewis' insistence, the 
BLM persuaded Park Service Director James M. Ridenour to sign a BLM-composed 
letter declaring that the East Mojave area "did not have the qualities needed 
to designate it as a national park," Park Service sources have disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
At a jammed hearing in California, Lewis brandished the letter for all to see. 
The BLM maneuver horrified old Park Service pros, who knew that sentiment 
within the agency actually ran with the Cranston-Levine plan. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Park Service had concluded in a 1987 report that East Mojave 
"would be a worthy and valuable addition to the National Park System." And even 
the BLM's own desert planning staff found in 1979 that East Mojave "readily 
qualifies for national park or monument status." But acknowledging that at this 
time, one informed environmentalist believes, would be a serious blow to the 
BLM. If Congress grabbed the East Mojave and gave it to the Park Service, he 
says, that would undermine the BLM's fledgling perception of itself as a 
preservationist force. "They have started to move in the right direction. One 
way to kill that feeling, that spirit, is to yank this away from them." 
</P>
<P>
Hillier insists that the BLM is making a sincere effort to provide the sort of 
long-term protection the desert needs. He bristles at the environmentalists' 
notion that the BLM is partial to off-roaders and miners. Hillier says he is 
carrying out the congressional mandate, which often angers the mechanized road 
runners as much as Sierra Clubbers. 
</P>
<P>
And he resents the implication by some preservationists that his agency has 
stood by while the desert was harmed by special-interest groups. "The fact of 
the matter is, in terms of off-road-vehicle use, you can fly over millions of 
acres of this country and never see a track," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Although his budget and staffing have improved, Hillier still faces an uphill 
battle to persuade Congress that the Cranston-Levine bill is not necessary, 
that the BLM can protect the desert well enough. Although the Park Service has 
suffered devastating budget cuts -- the 33% reduction in real dollars since 
1985 means that only 10 permanent rangers must patrol 2 million acres of Death 
Valley -- park status still carries prestige and tradition. There is a 
perception among some legislators that critical areas of the desert would be 
less vulnerable to neglect and abuse if they were in a park. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the dispute is not settled this year or next, the desert will survive. 
Critical portions are preserved in parklands now, and others will become 
protected wilderness. The BLM has proposed that Congress designate about 2 
million acres in wilderness areas of 6 million originally studied for 
preservation, giving them the protection the Sierra Club and others are 
demanding. Whenever this battle is over, it is almost certain that at least 2 
million acres of desert will be incorporated into the national wilderness 
protection system. 
</P>
<P>
Other portions have been designated as areas of critical environmental concern, 
to protect special natural features or endangered plant or animal life. And a 
1.5-million-acre region west of the Colorado River and bracketed by Interstates 
10 and 40 has been set aside as the East Mojave Scenic Area for management 
similar to that of a park, but not as restrictive. Such "interim" protection is 
vital, because both sides declare that they are in the trenches until victory 
is theirs -- and there is no talk of compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"No!" declares off-roader Dana Bell. "We compromised back in 1980. We gave up 
98% of the desert, and we don't want to give up the 2% we got." 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club's Hughes is equally adamant. "The Cranston bill was written as 
a compromise. It has taken park protection to save the desert so far, and we 
think that's what it will take in the future. Much of the desert is pristine 
and near-pristine. We are in time if we do it now, and we have plenty of 
horrible examples of what happens if we don't." 
</P>
<P>
Hillier, who has listened to such desert extremism for 14 years, has come to 
hear in it commonalities unacknowledged by either camp. "They both love the 
desert in their own way and, in fact, there's probably even a bit of hypocrisy 
on both sides," he says. "There's probably more than enough elitism on both 
sides." 
</P>
<P>
Sounding a bit wistful, and decidedly weary, Hillier sighs and adds, "The thing 
that probably has made it the most difficult over the last decade is the 
consensus that we had hoped for when we finished the plan has never really 
fully come together."

THE STAGE IS SET; 
</P>
<P>
IF IT'S DRAMA YOU WANT, THE ATLAS BAR &amp; GRILL HAS IT

Mario Tamayo has a knack for transforming unpromising L.A. locations into 
fun-filled dining spots like Cha Cha Cha and Cafe Mambo. Those first ventures 
were modest in scale and decorated with little more than bright paint. 
</P>
<P>
But Atlas Bar &amp; Grill is a big step upward. Working with artist-designer 
Ron Meyers, he's turned a cavernous expanse in the Wiltern Center, on Wilshire 
Boulevard, into a stunning set for Tamayo's blend of informal eating and live 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers kept much of the furniture and layout left by the previous restaurant 
occupant, L. A. Ole. But he has transformed what was an overpowering void into 
a setting as theatrical as anything you've seen on Broadway. The dining area is 
separated from the entrance facade by a fence of gilded wands. A wrought-iron 
screen of mythological figures that suggests a pencil sketch suspended in 
midair separates the dining area from the bar and somewhat open kitchen. The 
screen defines the dining area, giving it an exuberant, surprisingly intimate 
feeling, and diners can admire its multiple reflections in a mirror over the 
bar. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant's unusual lights are starburst fixtures of incandescent tubes 
and zigzag shades that hint at the Wiltern's flamboyant Art Deco ornamentation. 
Decorations shaped like lightning bolts draped in crystal add to the eclectic 
decor. And yellow walls reflect a warm glow reminiscent of candlelight. 
</P>
<P>
A small performance space is flanked by golden sunbursts on doors that conceal 
stage equipment when it's not in use. Excessive noise is absorbed by cork floor 
tiles and acoustic ceiling panels so that diners can actually carry on a 
conversation at the tables -- a rare treat in today's stylish but noisy 
restaurants.

BALZER ON WINE: CALIFORNIA CABERNETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Lawrence Balzer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WHENEVER A California Cabernet scores well in a tasting, East Coast wine 
pundits dismiss the results as a fluke. Bordeaux wines, of course, are the 
best, they say. Such snobbery was evident in a 1976 incident. In the Spurrier 
Paris tasting that year, Stag's Leap 1973 Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon 
triumphed over Chateau Mouton-Rothschild and Chateau Haut-Brion, both of 
Bordeaux. Gallic champions made all kinds of excuses, but when the competition 
was restaged 10 years later, California still prevailed. Yet, prejudiced 
naysayers continue to doubt the ability of California Cabernets to age 
gracefully. 
</P>
<P>
But a recent tasting in Glendora of 41 Cabernets from the '75 vintage, plus one 
from Washington state and another from Bordeaux, confirmed the mettle of 
California Cabernets. Sixteen of the wines averaged scores of 17 out of a 
possible 20 or better, all well beyond the 13.6 score of the highly acclaimed 
Mouton-Rothschild 1975. 
</P>
<P>
The big winner? Sonoma Valley's Chateau St. Jean 1975 Glen Ellen Vineyard, an 
absolutely glorious wine, scoring 19.5, with beguiling scents of roses and 
violets rising from a tapestry of tastes suggesting luscious black currants. On 
release in 1979, it sold for $7.50. Wine merchants who still have some sell it 
for $40 or more. Richard Arrowood's Chateau St. Jean 1975 Sonoma Cabernet 
Sauvignon also scored high, along with Caymus, a trio from Diamond Creek, 
Burgess Cellars, Ridge York Creek, Villa Mt. Eden, Veedercrest, St. Clement, 
Stag's Leap and Spring Mountain's Les Trois Cuvee. All now sell for at least 
five times their original price. 
</P>
<P>
Today's Cabernet market has equally good options for collectors. My 
wine-appreciation classes recently gave top ranking to Arrowood's Chateau St. 
Jean 1986 Alexander Valley Cabernet ($20). They also favored the Benziger Glen 
Ellen 1986 Cabernet ($17.50). Another -- the 1986 Arrowood Sonoma County 
Cabernet Sauvignon ($20) -- would grace your shopping list. Arrowood, a former 
wine maker at Chateau St. Jean, is now devoting nearly all his time to his own 
winery, just a hoot 'n a holler from Chateau St. Jean, where he will continue 
to be a consultant. Robert Lawrence Balzer

FOOD &amp; WINE: RIGHT FROM THE START; 
</P>
<P>
CELEBRITY BREAD IS WHAT KEEPS THEM LINING UP AT LA BREA BAKERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS PARSONS, Russ Parsons is food editor of Los Angeles Times Syndicate. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
IF PEOPLE LINE UP outside a restaurant, it's often because of celebrity chefs, 
celebrity architects or celebrity clientele -- even, occasionally, for food. 
But the lines in front of Campanile and its adjacent La Brea Bakery, owned by 
Nancy Silverton and Mark Peel, are there for celebrity bread. 
</P>
<P>
That may seem a bit of an exaggeration. Bread, after all, is the simplest of 
foods made from the most common of ingredients -- flour, water and yeast, a 
single-celled fungus that turns sugars into the carbon dioxide that makes bread 
rise. Most bakeries use the same strain of commercial yeast, but at La Brea 
Bakery, the yeast is different -- the yeast is the star. 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 160 different types of yeast, most of them floating in the 
air. Some impart a wonderful flavor to bread, some taste horrible. Bakers once 
kept a chunk of bread dough from a good batch of bread in order to guarantee 
the quality of the next loaves. Modern yeast, dependable and neutral in flavor, 
is more convenient, but, some say, makes bread with less character than did its 
unpredictable ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
At La Brea Bakery, Nancy Silverton's old-fashioned technique yields bread with 
character: Almost every loaf has its roots in a single 4-cup batch of sourdough 
starter that she created by soaking organically grown grapes in a mixture of 
flour and water, then straining out the grapes. The ambient yeasts from the 
vineyard went to work on the soggy flour, creating a sourdough starter that, 
four years later, is the heart of her business. 
</P>
<P>
Silverton's white, rye and whole wheat starters are bubbly, smelly things with 
the distinctly sour, fermented aroma of bad beer. In the course of a day's 
bread making, 30-gallon barrels are emptied of all but a few gallons of 
starter. They're replenished three times a day with more flour and water. This 
is called "feeding" the starters. 
</P>
<P>
When starter is taken from the barrel, it is mixed with more flour and water to 
make what's called a "sponge." The sponge is left to rise again, at which time 
more flour and any additional ingredients -- herbs, nuts, olive oil, anchovies 
-- are added to make the bread dough, which is then kneaded and shaped to form 
the final loaf. 
</P>
<P>
Home cooks can make their own sourdough starter using packaged yeast. Silverton 
says that as little as four tablespoons of starter, kept in the refrigerator 
and "fed" twice a week, would work well for home cooks. Just remember to feed 
the starter 24 hours before making bread. 
</P>
<P>
ROSEMARY OLIVE OIL BREAD 
</P>
<P>
3 cups water 
</P>
<P>
1 cup starter (see below) 
</P>
<P>
10-12 cups unbleached bread flour 
</P>
<P>
2 1/2 tablespoons wheat germ 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons salt 
</P>
<P>
2 1/2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh rosemary 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup olive oil 
</P>
<P>
In bowl of a large mixer, combine water and starter and stir to mix well. On 
low speed, gradually stir in flour, 2 cups at a time, until 10 cups have been 
added. Add wheat germ and mix at low speed for about 10 minutes, until dough 
pulls away from bowl and has a smooth, resilient texture. Add salt, rosemary 
and olive oil, and mix for at least 2 minutes. Remove dough from work bowl onto 
well-floured board or counter. With well-floured hands, knead dough until firm 
and resilient. Coat steel bowl with about 2 teaspoons olive oil, put dough in 
bowl and turn dough to coat well with oil. Cover loosely and leave in warm 
place to rise until tripled in volume, about 2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Punch dough down and divide in half. Shape each half into round loaves, put on 
cookie sheet, cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Remove from refrigerator and let dough rise slowly and come to room 
temperature, about 2 1/2 hours. Preheat oven to 500 degrees. Dust another 
cookie sheet with wheat germ or corn meal, and gently transfer both loaves to 
second sheet. Using sharp knife, cut shallow crisscross pattern in top of each 
loaf. 
</P>
<P>
When oven temperature reaches 500 degrees, fill small pan with water and put 
pan on bottom of oven. Put cookie sheet with loaves on rack in lower third of 
oven. Close door and turn temperature down to 350 degrees. Bake for about 20 
minutes; then remove water. Bake for another half hour ; check during last 10 
minutes to see if bread is done -- when crust has turned deep-brown and loaves 
sound hollow when tapped on bottom. Let cool before slicing. Makes 2 large 
loaves. 
</P>
<P>
SOURDOUGH STARTER 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon active dry yeast or 1/10 cake fresh yeast 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup warm water 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon water, room temperature 
</P>
<P>
2 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour 
</P>
<P>
Stir yeast into warm water and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. Stir 
in remaining water and flour, 1 cup at a time. 
</P>
<P>
Makes 2 1/3 cups. 
</P>
<P>
Note: The above recipe calls for only half of this starter. Put remainder in 
plastic container and keep in refrigerator, stirring in about 1/2 cup each of 
flour and water twice a week so starter will be available when needed. 
</P>

CHILDREN CAN FIND themselves -- or lose themselves -- at Quinby's for the 
Curious Child, which carries books about inner and outer exploration, from 
self-awarness-focused stories to travel adventures. Not that Quinby's is stuffy 
or reeks of good-for-you wholesomeness. 
</P>
<P>
Children are welcome to grab volumes off the shelves, station themselves 
wherever they please -- on the floor or in the aisles -- and read, unmindful to 
the adults stepping over and around them. 
</P>
<P>
The selection ranges from sturdy infant/toddler volumes designed to survive 
gumming and gnawing to an excellent collection of books for the advanced junior 
reader. Non-fiction topics include science and nature, biography, arts and 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Quinby's also stocks hard-to-find foreign-language books, children's sing-along 
tapes, book-and-audio-tape gift sets and classic children's films on video. The 
cartoon tie-in products so prevalent in larger shops are avoided -- mercifully, 
there's not a Smurf or a Mutant Ninja Turtle in sight. 
</P>

FLOWER CHILD IN THE '90S

<P>
A FASCINATION FOR myth, exotic cultures and rare animals still inspires Laurel 
Burch. Those of you around for the '60s will remember Burch as the pretty 
flower child who made jewelry from old coins, necklaces, beads and pins and 
peddled her creations at San Francisco street fairs and flea markets. 
</P>
<P>
Now the '60s are well in the past, and Burch's little business is now a 
multimillion-dollar enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Burch has been showing her jewelry at San Diego's Bazaar del Mundo for 17 
years. A new shop, the Laurel Burch Gallerita, has opened there to showcase her 
more than 600 earring designs of cloisonne and cast metal ($20 to $38), belts, 
necklaces, pillboxes, canvas tote bags, sweat shirts and T-shirts. About her 
latest line, The Art of Human Being, Burch says, "I wanted to celebrate the 
diversity, as well as the similarity, among peoples of the world." Maybe the 
'60s aren't completely over.

DOGS ARE BARKING, cats are purring -- all pandemonium has broken loose. The 
animals seem to know that a good friend has arrived. 
</P>
<P>
It's Tracy Parsons, president and co-founder of Critter Caterers, and her 
packed station wagon. "We're a complete food, toys, treats, gifts and even 
apparel delivery service for dogs and cats," Parson says. "We don't charge a 
delivery or membership fee, our prices are comparable to pet stores' and we 
even have an animal-care specialist for dietary evaluations." 
</P>
<P>
This is not just another superfluous faddish service. Those who have pets know 
how often they must fit a trip to the pet store into their hectic schedules and 
how often they run out of pet food. Critter Caterers delivers everything pet 
owners need, from leashes to dog houses -- and it takes orders daily from 7 
a.m. to 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
A popular specialty, Bentley's Biscuits, are fresh, homemade treats named after 
Parsons' own Old English sheep dog. "We use only fresh, 'people' ingredients," 
Parsons says, "like whole-wheat flour, chicken broth and eggs. Pet owners have 
told me that the biscuits are so good they eat them too." 
</P>

Critter Caterers serves the dogs and cats of Los Angeles, Hancock Park, Beverly

ROMANCING THE TABLE

<TEXT>
<P>
While looking for finishing touches for the elegant homes she designs, Winkler 
discovered that she could never find just the right table, bed and bath linens 
and accessories. So she decided to create her own. 
</P>
<P>
The result is Bebe's Home, a collection of rich, romantic items for the home. 
</P>
<P>
All the pieces of the collection -- which comprise English manor, French estate 
and New York pied-a-terre styles -- are perfect for eclectic California. And 
all complement one another: Bed treatments, cushions and sofa throws echo the 
fabrics and trims of the table linens. 
</P>
<P>
Bebe's Table includes what Winkler calls table "shawls," in rich damask and 
lush cotton fabrics trimmed with fringe, which are layered over tablecloths; 
the "palettes" (place mats), made of damask and trimmed with braid are 
available in round and rectangular sizes. The matching napkins come in 22- or 
24-inch sizes, and there are also smaller "aperitif" napkins in a variety of 
fabrics, trimmed with braids and fringes. Perhaps the most unique of the table 
collection are what Winkler calls "Fashion Wraps," an innovative approach to 
napkin rings: elegant tasseled cords, ruby- and ivory-lacquer "signature 
bracelets," ivory-and-onyx-toned wood rings and a brass-buckle knife rest that 
can also be used to encircle a napkin. 
</P>
<P>
 Bebe's Home items are available at Terra Cotta, 11925 Montana Ave., Brentwood; 
(213) 826-7878.

A NEW DAY FOR EARTHLY CONCERNS; 
</P>
<P>
WITH 5 BILLION ABOARD, TIME FOR THE NEXT REVOLUTION 
</P>

environmental and policy studies at Dartmouth College.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Earth Day is at its best at the neighborhood level, with nature hikes and trash 
pickups -- but it's bigger than that. It brings forth resounding speeches by 
politicians, some of them sincere, but it's bigger than that, too. There are 
Hollywood events, TV specials and ads telling us how various corporations love 
the planet, but it's much bigger than that. 
</P>
<P>
Every school in Thailand is planting a tree; every church in Costa Rica is 
giving an Earth sermon; there are concerts in the Soviet Union, a rain-forest 
roadshow in Japan and a beach cleanup in Tanzania -- but I think, and hope, 
that Earth Day is bigger than all that. 
</P>
<P>
If we're wise and lucky, Earth Day 1990 can be one of those peoples' 
demonstrations, like the ones in Berlin and Leipzig and Wenceslas Square, that 
launch a revolution. The revolutionary opportunity is not the turnover of one 
government for another, nor even the establishment of a new idea of government. 
It's bigger than that. The potential revolution is equivalent to only two 
others in human history -- the Agricultural and the Industrial revolutions. 
</P>
<P>
About 8,000 years ago, when there were just 10 million people in the world, 
some hunter-gatherers started domesticating animals, cultivating plants and 
founding humanity's first permanent settlements. They altered the face of the 
planet and the thoughts of humankind. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time it made sense to own land. People who stayed in one place 
could accumulate things. The ideas of wealth, inheritance, trade, money and 
power were born. Some people lived on excess food produced by others and became 
full-time potters, toolmakers, musicians, scribes, priests, soldiers or kings. 
Thus arose, for better or worse, the division of labor, experts, armies and 
bureaucracies. 
</P>
<P>
As its inheritors, we think of that revolution as a great step forward. At the 
time it was a mixed blessing. Agriculture was not a better way of life, but a 
necessary one, because of increasing population and decreasing game. Settled 
farmers got more food from an acre of land, but the food was of lower quality 
and less variety and it required a lot more work. Farmers became vulnerable, as 
nomads never were, to weather, disease, pests, invasion and oppression from 
their own emerging ruling class. Since they no longer moved away from their 
wastes, they experienced humankind's first environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
The Industrial Revolution was also a brilliant adaptation to the problem of 
populations growing beyond their technology and resource base. Agriculture was 
a response to wildlife scarcity; industry to land and energy scarcity. Around 
1750, when there were 800 million people in the world, the Industrial 
Revolution began with science and coal and led quickly to steam engines and 
capitalism (and later to capitalism's dissenting offshoot, communism). 
</P>
<P>
Again, everything changed. There were roads and railroads, factories and smoke. 
The cities swelled. Again, the change was a mixed blessing. Human labor became 
harder and more demeaning. The environment turned unspeakably filthy. The 
standard of living for most workers was far below that of a yeoman farmer. But 
work in a factory was better than starving on the crowded land. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard for us to appreciate how profoundly the Industrial Revolution changed 
human thought, because we still think its thoughts. Historian Donald Worster 
described the thought-revolution: 
</P>
<P>
"The capitalists . . . promised that, through the technological domination of 
the Earth, they could deliver a more fair, rational, efficient and productive 
life for everyone . . . . That meant teaching everyone to treat the Earth, as 
well as each other, with a frank, energetic, self-assertiveness . . . . People 
must . . . think constantly in terms of making money. They must regard 
everything around them -- the land, its natural resources, their own labor -- 
as potential commodities that might fetch a profit in the market. They must 
demand the right to produce, buy and sell those commodities without outside 
regulation or interference . . . . As wants multipled, as markets grew more and 
more far-flung, the bond between humans and the rest of nature was reduced to 
the barest instrumentalism." 
</P>
<P>
That bare instrumentalism engendered incredible material success and, in a 
world that now holds more than 5 billion people, severe environmental 
degradation. It created the necessity for the next revolution, the one we 
celebrate with Earth Day. 
</P>
<P>
Few of us picking up trash and carrying Earth banners think we're participating 
in a thoroughgoing revolution in human culture. But some of us suspect that's 
the direction our concern will take us. We know it is impossible to go on 
finding, moving and wasting oil, leveling forests, paving land, dumping poisons 
and multiplying our numbers. A new way of life, a new set of thoughts must be 
found. 
</P>
<P>
Earth Day coordinator Denis Hayes clearly hopes to launch a thought-revolution: 
"I would really like to create a situation where people become more 
introspective about themselves and think more carefully about purpose and 
meaning in life. There is a sort of mindless, heedless rush -- an enormously 
acquisitive preoccupation with more and more and more. I hope people will begin 
to question our purpose and come up with more satisfying answers." 
</P>
<P>
A more satisfying answer is already here in the idea of sustainability -- a 
word that has just surfaced in the discourse of the industrial world. It means 
using the planet's resources in a way that permits future generations to have 
some, too. 
</P>
<P>
It's as impossible for us to describe a fully sustainable world as it would 
have been for the farmers of BC 6000 to foresee present-day Iowa or the English 
coal miners of 750 to imagine a Toyota assembly line. We only know that a 
sustainable world would be highly efficient in its energy use. It would 
respect, reuse and recycle materials. It would have a stable population. Human 
needs for community, identity and self-respect would be met directly, rather 
than with expensive material substitutes. The thoughts in people's heads would 
be about harmony with nature, rather than conquest. 
</P>
<P>
Like the other great revolutions, an environmental revolution will require 
sacrifices and lead to enormous gains. It too will change the face of the land 
and human institutions, hierarchies, self-definitions, cultures. It will take 
centuries. 
</P>
<P>
If it happens. There is no guarantee, of course. There were hunting-gathering 
tribes who spurned the idea of agriculture and either died out or were engulfed 
by powerful settled neighbors. There are agrarian societies that still resist 
the industrial mind-set. An environmental revolution can't be piecemeal, 
however, because the ecological problems it must solve are global. Humankind 
has to pull off this revolution as a whole -- or sink as a whole into the 
ecological and economic impoverishment of a culture that has failed to adapt to 
historical necessity. 
</P>
<P>
William D. Ruckelshaus, former administrator of the Environmental Protection 
Agency, recently wrote about the enormous nature of the challenge: 
</P>
<P>
"Can we move nations and people in the direction of sustainability? Such a move 
would be a modification of society comparable in scale to only two other 
changes: the Agricultural Revolution of the late Neolithic and the Industrial 
Revolution of the past two centuries. 
</P>
<P>
"Those revolutions were gradual, spontaneous and largely unconscious. This one 
will have to be a fully conscious operation, guided by the best foresight that 
science can provide . . . . If we actually do it, the undertaking will be 
absolutely unique in humanity's stay on the Earth."

GORBACHEV HAS MET HIS MATCH: HISTORY; 
</P>
<P>
LITHUANIA: THE SOVIET PRESIDENT WAS PRESENTED WITH A FACE-SAVING COMPROMISE, 
BUT CONSERVATIVE HEAT MAY HAVE FORCED HIS IRON FIST.

<P>
In the early afternoon of March 7, a government plane with a single passenger 
aboard took off from Vilnius, Lithuania, and headed for Moscow. The passenger, 
Algirdas Brazauskas, leader of the Independent Communist Party of Lithuania, 
was scheduled to meet with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at 4 p.m. His trip, 
endorsed by the entire Lithuanian leadership, was a last-ditch effort to avoid 
an open break with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
At their meeting, Brazauskas said the Lithuanians would refrain from declaring 
independence the following Sunday if Gorbachev promised to initiate serious 
negotiations leading to Lithuanian independence down the road. Gorbachev 
tersely refused the compromise proposal. 
</P>
<P>
This virtually unknown episode debunks the conventional wisdom that the 
Lithuanians left Gorbachev no choice. As Moscow tightens the economic noose 
around the Baltic republic, the March 7 meeting also provides some important 
clues about the nature of the crisis and, beyond that, the increasingly 
explosive dynamics of high-level Soviet politics. 
</P>
<P>
Why did Gorbachev reject Brazauskas' offer? The Soviet leader may simply have 
misjudged Lithuanian determination. He may have wished to avoid setting a 
precedent that might trigger a separatist stampede. Or Gorbachev may have bowed 
to powerful conservative pressures against his policies. 
</P>
<P>
Although each of these factors probably played a role, conservative pressure 
may indeed have been the decisive one. In the past several months, there has 
been a veritable explosion of conservative anger at Gorbachev, now openly and 
routinely accused of destroying the Communist Party and the Soviet system. More 
ominously, the top military leadership has jumped into the fray with dire 
warnings of the unraveling of the Soviet state if current policies continue. 
They have also castigated Gorbachev's arms-control and defense-cut measures and 
called for a crackdown on nationalist and separatist elements. Then last month 
the KGB issued an unprecedented admonition to the leadership that the fate of 
Soviet socialism itself is now at stake. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's confrontational tactics in Lithuania have probably won him a 
reprieve from all the conservative carping. The zeal of the guardians of the 
old order to save socialism and empire in Lithuania is instructive. The 
hard-line commander of the Soviet army, Valentin Varennikov, was quickly 
dispatched to Vilnius. Without delay, he inflamed tensions and called for use 
of force. The KGB, meantime, churned out sinister anti-socialist plots, 
complete with devious Westerners and Lithuanians with dark Nazi pasts. Glasnost 
fell by the wayside and propaganda, disinformation and outright lies filled the 
media. The dreaded past, it seemed, had returned. 
</P>
<P>
But the past is no longer, and Gorbachev's gamble will prove a disastrous 
miscalculation. The Lithuanians have become even more united and determined to 
achieve their independence. Other potential separatists -- in the western 
Ukraine, for example -- are likely to decide that talking to Moscow is useless 
and thus unilateral action is their only option. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's actions have stirred a wave of pro-Lithuania solidarity across the 
country that is sure to grow. Hundreds of thousands have taken to the streets 
in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Tbilisi, Tashkent and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the outcome of the crisis, Gorbachev, the politician, has already 
chalked up another failure. For millions of liberal-minded Soviet citizens, his 
implicit collusion with the military and the hard-liners is yet another sign 
that he is no longer their man, while his conservative enemies are unlikely to 
be appeased. What he apparently does not understand is that in Lithuania he is 
not fighting separatists and extremists, but history itself. The decolonization 
of empires, once set in motion, is irreversible. Nothing less is happening to 
the Soviet empire in Lithuania. Gorbachev cannot win. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the West, including the Bush Administration, also do not seem to 
understand this. To them, the sole guarantee of stability is Gorbachev and his 
promise of perestroika. Anything that seems to stand in his way is seen as 
undesirable. A typical commentary in an American news magazine, for example, 
asserts that the Lithuanians' struggle for independence shows a "lack of 
political wisdom" and that their supporters in Congress are "cheerleaders of 
tragedy." President Bush's main task is seen as "persuading Gorbachev to avert 
bloodshed." Suppressing the Lithuanians by other means is evidently acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
Such attitudes, though regrettable to hear from journalists, are inexcusable 
coming from the Administration. Yet Washington's record in the crisis so far is 
not encouraging. The Administration's refusal to take a principled stand, its 
passivity in the face of Moscow's brutal pressure and its unseemly semantic 
acrobatics in trying to define violence in a way that does not apply to 
anything Gorbachev does -- all are unbecoming of a great power. Far worse, they 
may result in greater violence by giving the impression of American 
indifference or even collusion with the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
This impression, in fact, has already taken root, prompting stinging criticism 
of American policies by democratic elements in Moscow and elsewhere. Even 
before the emergence of the Lithuanian crisis, the Administration's 
non-reaction to the massacres of nationalist demonstrators in Tbilisi and Baku, 
coupled with its general ambivalence toward the resurgent national independence 
movements, may have led the Kremlin to believe that Washington is keenly 
interested in the continuing survival of the Soviet empire, such as it has 
become, and would not support self-determination for any of its parts. Shortly 
after the summit meeting at Malta, in a major speech to the Central Committee, 
Gorbachev boldly stated that "foreign nations and politicians" understand that 
"the existence of a unitary, durable and powerful Soviet Union is an imperative 
necessity of the epoch" and claimed further that interest in the "preservation 
of the (Soviet) Union" . . . has been confirmed unequivocally in our contacts 
with the leaders of the largest states of the world, including those on whose 
support our domestic separatists count." 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not such assurances have, in fact, been given to the Soviet 
president, he seems to believe them. This is dangerous. It is imperative for 
Washington to understand that the days of the Soviet empire are numbered and 
that Gorbachev should be disabused of the notion that efforts to prop it up by 
force and blackmail will find sympathy in the West. 
</P>
<P>
At stake is more than arms control and economic relations with Moscow, or 
indeed Gorbachev's political future. Huge numbers of lives could be lost in a 
violent explosion triggered by the kind of misreading of history we are 
observing in Lithuania today.

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some years ago, as President Calvin Coolidge was leaving church on a Sunday 
morning, he was approached by a re porter. "What was the sermon about?" the 
reporter asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Sin," the President replied. 
</P>
<P>
"And what did the preacher have to say about sin?" the reporter persisted. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he was against it," Coolidge answered. 
</P>
<P>
The consensus on the environment is about as strong as the consensus on sin. 
Ask Americans how they feel about the environment and they say, "We're for it." 
</P>
<P>
That explains two things: why the environmental coalition is so successful, and 
why those who do not accept environmentalism as a consensual value -- business 
interests, conservatives and environmental radicals -- are so frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
Earth Day, for example, has taken on the character of a celebration rather than 
a protest. Activities are being sponsored by TV networks, public-relations 
firms, schools, movie stars, local governments, labor unions, rock bands, 
museums, political parties and even major corporations. In the immortal words 
of Jimmy Durante, "Everybody wants to get into the act." 
</P>
<P>
Honolulu will have a Low-Energy Parade (vehicles run on fossil fuels not 
allowed). Street vendors in New York will sell organic foods (tofu knishes?). 
On ABC's "Earth Day Special," Bette Midler will portray a long-suffering Mother 
Earth -- a sort of ecological Stella Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Who is the target of all this activity? According to the Earth Day 1990 
brochure, "The (environmental) crisis exists precisely because of actions we 
have taken." As Pogo once said, "We have met the enemy, and he is us." 
</P>
<P>
Radical environmentalists see things differently. They insist that the issue 
involves fundamental social conflict. "Who is destroying the earth? Are we all 
equally to blame? NO!" proclaims one leaflet. "The polluters would have us 
believe that we are all just common travelers on 'Spaceship Earth,' when in 
fact a few of them are at the controls and the rest of us are choking on the 
exhaust." 
</P>
<P>
This particular point of view is espoused by Wall Street Action, a group that 
says it will try to disrupt the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. They 
complain that Earth Day is "a safe event" whose organizers say "nothing about 
the institutions or the economic system responsible for ecocide." 
</P>
<P>
The radicals are correct. Earth Day reflects a broad consensus on environmental 
values. You want a conflict of values? Try the abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
Three-quarters of the American people call themselves environmentalists. And 
they mean it. In one recent survey, that is the proportion who feel that 
"protecting the environment is so important that requirements and standards 
cannot be too high, and environmental improvements must be made regardless of 
cost." 
</P>
<P>
Conservatives like to think environmentalism is an "elitist" issue. As Earth 
Day Chairman Denis Hayes pointed out, the membership of environmental 
organizations has for a long time consisted largely of "upper-middle-class, 
well-educated, politically active, 35- to 60-year-old white folks." In other 
words, liberals. 
</P>
<P>
Minorities and working people were not supposed to have environmental concerns. 
They were too busy trying to make ends meet. The conservative strategy was to 
build a populist base on the issue of economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
That was a serious error. Conservatives had it backwards: Environmentalism is 
the populist position. Most people refuse to believe there is any trade-off 
between environmental protection and economic growth. If forced to choose, the 
public opts for slower growth and a clean environment. That holds true for rich 
and poor, young and old, GOP and Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
Business is frustrated by the environmental consensus. To the business 
community, the environmental movement is a greater threat to free enterprise 
than communism. The problem is that anti-environmental values have no 
legitimacy in the public debate. Therefore, businessmen find it hard to defend 
their interests. 
</P>
<P>
In the congressional debate over the Clean Air Act, for example, the business 
community has decided not to take its case to the public. Some business leaders 
want to announce that the measure will raise consumer prices, create energy 
shortages and ban large automobiles. But they have been persuaded not to go 
public for one reason: They lack credibility. 
</P>
<P>
After all, back in the 1970s, auto makers claimed tighter emission controls 
would destroy the auto industry. An executive vice president at Ford warned new 
pollution limits "could prevent continued production of automobiles" and "do 
irreparable damage to the American economy." 
</P>
<P>
Lee A. Iacocca was wrong. Under government pressure, the industry refined the 
technology of catalytic converters. This enabled them to boost fuel efficiency 
and exceed federal emission standards. The United States now exports catalytic 
converters to Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians, like businessmen, have learned that they have to be on the right 
side of the environmental issue. Republicans are following the lead of 
President George Bush. They are proclaiming the environmental cause as their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
Bush called himself an environmentalist in 1988, and the Democratic candidate, 
Michael S. Dukakis, never bothered to dispute the claim. In fact, the 
Republicans ran more campaign ads on the environment than the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
This is called policy-poaching, and Republicans have gotten good at it. Bush 
calls himself "the environmental President," and his commitment to a clean-air 
bill helped break the legislative deadlock and produce the first new 
anti-pollution measure in 13 years. GOP candidates for governor of California 
and Florida are touting their environmental credentials. 
</P>
<P>
This drives Democrats and environmentalists crazy. They think they're supposed 
to be the arbiters of who's politically correct on the environment. "We've not 
moved quickly enough to set a standard," said Jim Maddy, executive director of 
the League of Conservation Voters, "so each and every politician decides what 
it takes to be considered good on the environment." 
</P>
<P>
Conservatives in the Bush Administration also find themselves on the defensive. 
Every time they try to weaken Bush's environmental position, political 
necessity forces him to strengthen it. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, Bush created a stir in his opening remarks to a two-day, 
17-nation conference on global warming convened by the White House. The 
President told the delegates that more study was needed on the causes of global 
warming and that no action could be taken without considering the economic 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was immediately criticized for trying to use the conference as a delaying 
tactic. So the next day he backtracked and said, "We have never considered 
research a substitute for action." The President insisted he was trying to 
"apply the power of the marketplace in the service of the environment." 
</P>
<P>
What the Administration was really trying to do was revealed in a paper 
inadvertently released to the conference. The paper had a list of "talking 
points" for U.S. delegates. They were told to "raise the many uncertainties 
that need to be better understood" about global warming. 
</P>
<P>
The paper warned the U.S. representatives that it was "not beneficial to 
discuss whether there is or is not" a global warming problem. "In the eyes of 
the public," the document said, "we will lose this debate." The Administration 
is learning. You can't fight the environmental consensus, so you'd better join 
it. 
</P>
<P>
As the Earth Day experience demonstrates, everybody is an environmentalist 
these days. Because the environmental consensus is so broad, it is not likely 
to have much of an impact on U.S. politics. On the other hand, it is likely to 
have a big impact on the environment. After all, we're about to get a new Clean 
Air Act.

A NORTH AMERICAN COMMON MARKET: GOOD FOR ALL, BUT A HARD ROAD AHEAD; 
</P>
<P>
FREE TRADE: MEXICO HOPES FOR LESS AUSTERITY AND MORE AID. WASHINGTON THINKS IT 
WOULD BE A WAY OF GETTING MEXICO TO TAKE MORE IMF MEDICINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Walter Russell Mead, Walter Russell Mead is the author of Mortal Splendor: 
The American Empire in Transition (Houghton Mifflin). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The long, complicated and often unhappy relationship between the United States 
and Mexico has entered a new and hopeful phase: Discussions on a U.S.-Mexico 
free-trade agreement are under way. But the relationship remains a minefield 
for negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
Both countries have mixed feelings about the other; not everybody in either 
country favors closer ties. Mexico matters for the U.S. Southwest, not much for 
Maine and Minnesota. In Mexico, some see deeper North American involvement as 
the only solution to their country's prolonged economic downturn; others argue 
that the political and economic costs of Yanqui capital outweigh its benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Mexico has a president who believes in the United States, and the United 
States has a President who believes in Mexico. Since both leaders also believe 
in free trade, it is not surprising that the current climate is conducive to 
plans for a North American common market. 
</P>
<P>
Problem is that the idea means different things on each side of the border. 
Washington still has a touching faith in the kind of ultra-free market, 
ultra-austerity programs supported by the International Monetary Fund. Raise 
taxes, cut social spending, pay the foreign debt, keep wages low, allow foreign 
companies unrestricted rights to compete in domestic markets; the doctors of 
the international economy proscribe these remedies to all their patients. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico's ruling party has been swallowing this medicine in increasing doses for 
more than a decade. The result: the most serious political crisis since the 
horrors of the Revolution. Mexico hopes that a common market would mean less 
austerity and more aid. Washington thinks it would be a way of getting Mexico 
to take a bigger dose of medicine. 
</P>
<P>
The American concept of a common market is simple: Mexico will drop its 
barriers to U.S. investment while each side removes impediments to trade. This 
version of the common market will be popular in corporate board rooms here and 
in Japan, but it will be controversial elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States this plan won't find friends among labor and environmental 
groups. In essence, the plan would make it easier for U.S. firms to avoid 
paying U.S. wages and to comply with U.S. environmental and safety 
requirements. Japanese and other foreign investors would also be spared the 
necessity of building plants in the United States to take advantage of our 
markets; their products assembled in Mexico would benefit from the free-trade 
agreement and they would not face the higher costs of production in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Such a free-trade agreement would also be controversial in Mexico, though for 
different reasons. A surge of new foreign investment would bring badly needed 
jobs to Mexico and extend the benefits of the maquiladora system of 
export-oriented production beyond the immediate border zone. New exports would 
provide the foreign exchange with which Mexico could service its debt. Both 
these developments would be widely welcome. 
</P>
<P>
But the consequences of a free-trade agreement would go farther. For 70 years, 
Mexico's political and economic system has rested on the protection of key 
industries and limits on foreign investors. The Mexican Revolution was a 
revolution against foreign investment. In 1910, U.S. investors owned roughly 10 
million of the 14 million hectares in Baja California, and more than 100 
million hectares, overall, in Mexico. U.S. companies controlled Mexico's 
railroads, mining industries and oil; altogether, according to John Mason 
Hart's "Revolutionary Mexico," foreign investors controlled 130 of the 170 
largest enterprises in pre-revolutionary Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is in a difficult position. The 
economic order that emerged from the Revolution is no longer viable. But 
neither Salinas nor Mexico's ruling party is prepared to return to the policies 
of Porfirio Diaz, the much-hated turn-of-the-century Mexican dictator who tried 
to build national prosperity on the basis of foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
When Mexicans think about a common market with the United States, they think of 
the Common Market in Europe, and, specifically, the way in which the richer 
countries in the European Common Market have reached out to help the poorer 
members, especially Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Rich European countries like West Germany and France are still making generous 
contributions to the Spanish economy. Some estimates put the annual aid to 
Spain at close to $20 billion; on a per-capita basis, that would mean $40 
billion annually from the United States to Mexico for such things as 
infrastructure construction, debt relief and agricultural assistance. 
</P>
<P>
This kind of aid to Mexico would probably be good for the United States, and 
pay for itself in new export business. If linked to better wages, working 
conditions and more stringent environmental standards in Mexico, a substantial 
aid program would overcome many of the most troubling consequences in the 
United States of such a pact. Even a fraction of that money would help Salinas 
explain more convincingly to his constituents the difference between his 
program and Diaz's. But it is safe to say that neither the Bush Administration 
nor the Congress is contemplating $4 billion, much less $40 billion in aid to 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
These different ideas suggest that the United States and Mexico are still far 
from a mutual understanding, and that the route to a common market will be a 
long and torturous one -- much more so than in the case of the U.S.-Canada 
free-trade agreement. A North American and ultimately a Pan-American common 
market could be good for everyone, but we need to think more clearly about what 
such an agreement would be worth to us. The lesson out of Europe is that the 
rich countries have gotten plenty out of their Common Market only after making 
substantial, long-term cash commitments.

I think today should be called People Day. We don't need to worry about Earth; 
she'll be fine.

It's the humans who are the short-timers here. We ought to be worrying about 
what we're going to do to save us. When Mother Earth gets mad enough at the 
mess we've made of her domain, she'll just send us the way of the dodo. It may 
take her a while to tidy up after we're gone; we've been very sloppy guests,

THE SPRING OF OUR DISCONTENT

<TEXT>
<P>
The scene is increasingly common in Southern California. Flowers stand not full 
and robust but drooped over and shriveled. The roses for display on the dining 
table are so distorted from their natural shape that they look more like 
doilies for the place settings. Outside dead bees line the patio; crickets 
aren't chirping. If it is not quite a silent spring around here right now, it 
is certainly a disquieted one. 
</P>
<P>
The problem now is aphids, those parasitic insects that huddle together on new 
shoots, buds and leaves. They are invading local gardens in distressingly high 
numbers. The natural predators that usually keep aphids under control -- 
ladybugs, lacewings and tiny wasps -- have been destroyed in some 400 square 
miles of Southern California. So have wild honeybees, which pollinate fruit 
trees. All this, plus the lack of chirping crickets, have been attributed to 
aerial malathion spraying that has descended upon many local areas during the 
last nine months. 
</P>
<P>
The state has sprayed the pesticide in a campaign to rid the region of the 
crop-destroying Mediterranean fruit fly. That pest continues to pop up in 
unexpected places, giving farmers fits, local residents sleepless nights and 
state officials heartburn. But one of the certain unfortunate side effects of 
malathion spraying is that it is extraordinarily efficient in eliminating some 
"good" bugs. 
</P>
<P>
Without them, the natural controls crucial to a linked ecosystem begin to break 
down. And so, we are all robbed of one of the great joys of spring -- a lovely 
and healthy garden. The negative effects were expected, say entomologists, and 
the bad news in the back yard is nothing compared to the damage the Medfly 
could cause to the food supply. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe. We can only hope that Rachel Carson's words from 1962 don't return to 
ring in our ears: "It is ironic to think that man might determine his own 
future by something so seemingly trivial as the choice of an insect spray. 
</P>
<P>
"All this has been risked -- for what? Future historians may well be amazed by 
our distorted sense of proportion. How could intelligent beings seek to control 
a few unwanted species by a method that contaminated the entire environment and 
brought the threat of disease and death even to their own kind? Yet this is 
precisely what we have done. All this is not to say there is no insect problem 
and no need of control. I am saying, rather, that control must be geared to 
realities, not to mythical situations, and that the methods employed must be 
such that they do not destroy us along with the insects."

CELEBRATING EARTH DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Easter season is holy to many of the world's faiths. But this year, it 
seems to have become a time for the revival of an ancient religion -- the 
worship of nature. 
</P>
<P>
The publicity over Earth Day (or is it now Earth Month) goes far beyond a 
legitimate concern over the environment. We are asked to pay homage to a 
hostile planet on which humans would have become extinct if not for the 
progress and technology that environmentalists fear so intensely. We are asked 
to sacrifice for the good of this angry god we live on. Do not cut back the 
jungles that are strangling so many of the Third World nations. It might cause 
global warming. Sacrifice your air conditioning and refrigeration and your 
plastic cups. They might deplete the Earth's ozone layer. Make any sacrifice 
required to preserve endangered species that you may never have heard of -- but 
let's put limits on the growth of the human population. Unproven theories such 
as the "greenhouse effect," the ozone layer depletion theory, and 
overpopulation have become dogmas, accepted without question. Worship, 
sacrifice, faith -- the marks of environmental extremism and of all other 
religions. 
</P>
<P>
In the U.S., freedom of religion is a constitutional right -- but so is 
separation of church and state. Courts have prevented the teaching of "creation 
science" in public schools, ruling it was religion not science. It's time we 
examined courses in ecology and environmentalism for the same reason.

WOOD AND CRA PATRONAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Wood has an obvious, king-sized conflict-of-interest problem, as your 
columnist Bill Boyarsky so aptly pointed out in his commentary on political 
patronage ("The Power of Patronage and the CRA," Metro, April 14). Wood should 
not have been confirmed for another term as a member of the Los Angeles 
Community Redevelopment Agency, in control of a $500-million annual budget, 
while he continues to serve as one of the top officers in the Los Angeles 
County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
If Wood wishes to promote the full employment and economic well-being of the 
thousands of members of the AFL-CIO, fine, let him do so full-time, and not 
while he continues to hand out multimillion-dollar construction contracts while 
wearing his CRA hat. 
</P>
<P>
There is another blatant case of conflict of interest involving Wood and the 
City Council. Wood, because of his high position, has a key voice on a special 
committee to determine AFL-CIO political endorsements. If it is perceived as 
improper for a council member's vote to appear to be influenced by a campaign 
contribution, how is a vote influenced by a campaign endorsement any different? 
An endorsement can prove even more critical to a campaign than a contribution. 
</P>
<P>
After all these months of talk about a higher level of ethics and integrity 
being needed in local government, Wood's easy confirmation for another term on 
the CRA board indicates that the buddy-buddy political patronage train is still 
chugging along, right on track in City Hall, conflict-of-interest issues 
notwithstanding.

IRRELEVANCE OF GOOD INTENTIONS; 
</P>
<P>
ON TRANSFORMING EARTH DAY IDEALS INTO REALITY: NOT EASY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This Earth Day 1990 quite properly is a time to celebrate the environmental 
progress of the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
But Monday, the real work must begin. 
</P>
<P>
The achievements of two decades have been catalogued in exhaustive detail this 
past week: clean air, clean water, hazardous-waste cleanup, more parks and 
wilderness and so on. Also enumerated for all concerned have been the three new 
allegedly apocalyptic problems menacing the environment: the destruction of 
tropical forests, the ozone hole and the greenhouse effect. 
</P>
<P>
The first Earth Day 20 years ago was a success because it convinced Americans 
of the need to protect the environment and the costs of failing to do so. The 
momentum of Earth Day 1970 helped put in place the regulation and technology 
needed to attack the most obvious and obnoxious sources of pollution. In a 
sense, these have been the most painless jobs: cleanups done for us by others. 
</P>
<P>
Earth Day 1990 will be a success only if Americans realize that regulation and 
technology cannot do the complete job. The next step is for all of us -- each 
person and family -- to take a hard look at the way we live and to begin 
changing wasteful and polluting habits. Southern Californians have a special 
obligation to do so because their most pervasive pollution problem -- dirty air 
-- is a direct result of their driving habits. The burden is made even more 
difficult by the fact that population growth is depleting the area's 
developable land, resources and transportation capacity at an alarming rate. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is not a lack of will on the part of the people. Opinion polls 
demonstrate that most citizens will make the sacrifices necessary to control 
pollution and manage growth. They will accept additional regulation -- and 
taxation -- that will lead to obvious solutions. Witness the public support 
that greeted the city of Los Angeles' move to require the separation of trash 
in the home to facilitate recycling -- something that triggered a political 
revolt not that many years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But individual good intentions are wasted unless the economic and governmental 
structures exist to transform them into reality. Separating metal, paper and 
glass in the kitchen is meaningless unless the right trucks make the pickup and 
get the material to the end of the cycle -- including profitable markets for 
the recycled goods. The trick may involve creation of market incentives and/or 
tax breaks to get such programs going, just as subsidies were used during the 
energy crisis to assist alternate forms of energy. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Californians may be more willing than many think to join car pools or 
use public transit. But they will do so in large numbers only if convenience or 
economic incentive lures them from their autos -- or, unless there are 
disincentives such as a congestion tax for driving freeways during rush hours 
and the elimination of subsidized parking. As economist Murray Weidenbaum 
observed in The Times recently, most polluters pollute because it is easier or 
cheaper to pollute, or both. The playing field must be changed so that it 
becomes too expensive to pollute. 
</P>
<P>
The incentives must be clear and practical. They must lead to results. 
Trade-offs and potential unintended consequences must be analyzed carefully. 
It's true that there's hope for widespread use of electric cars before the 
millennium: But the electricity must come from someplace. Will it come from 
more conventional, polluting power plants? Or from a non-polluting alternative 
energy source? There's a big difference. 
</P>
<P>
The people may be ready, but collective action takes leadership. Most state and 
local officials have lagged behind the curve of public opinion. They soon will 
face public demand for action. The problem is compounded by competing and 
overlapping layers of government and, too often, lack of involvement of the 
business community. The region's ability to overcome these obstacles in the 
years to come will tell us a great deal about what Southern California will be 
like on Earth Day 2010.

HIGH COURT GOES COLD ON RELIGIOUS LIBERTY; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: THE FOUNDING FATHERS CLEARLY INTENDED RELIGION TO BE PERFECTLY FREE, BUT 
ONLY AS LONG AS IT STAYED PERFECTLY PRIVATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE F. WILL, George F. Will is a syndicated columnist in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A central purpose of America's political arrangements is the subordination of 
religion to the political order, meaning the primacy of democracy. The 
Founders, like John Locke before them, wished to tame and domesticate religious 
passions of the sort that convulsed Europe. They aimed to do so not by 
establishing religion, but by establishing a commercial republic -- capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
Hence religion is to be perfectly free as long as it is perfectly private -- 
mere belief -- but it must bend to the political will (law) as regards conduct. 
Thus Thomas Jefferson held that "operations of the mind" are not subject to 
legal coercion, but that "acts of the body" are. Mere belief, said Jefferson, 
in one god or 20, neither picks one's pockets nor breaks one's legs. 
</P>
<P>
His distinction rests on Locke's principle that religion can be useful or 
disruptive, but its truth cannot be established by reason. Hence Americans 
would not "establish" religion. Rather, by guaranteeing free exercise of 
religions, they would make religions private and subordinate. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three states and federal law exempt the religious use of peyote from 
prohibitions, and Justice Antonin Scalia, who wrote the majority opinion in the 
Oregon case, indicates sympathy for that policy. However, he rightly insists it 
is not constitutionally obligatory. 
</P>
<P>
If, he says, some religious conduct is thus disadvantaged, that is "an 
unavoidable consequence of democratic government." 
</P>
<P>
The Founders favored religious tolerance because religious pluralism meant 
civil peace -- order. Thus Scalia is following the Founders when he finds the 
limits of constitutionally required tolerance of "free exercise" in the idea 
that a society is "courting anarchy" when it abandons the principle stated in 
the 1879 ruling: "Laws are made for the government of actions." If conduct 
arising from belief, not just belief itself, is exempt from regulation, that 
would permit "every citizen to become a law unto himself." 
</P>
<P>
Scalia's position is not only sound conservatism, it is constitutionally 
correct.

"It's the movie that's trying desperately to get made." That's how producer 
Donna Dubrow describes "Road Show," the romantic action-adventure about a 
contemporary cattle drive -- that might star Sean Connery and Cher. 
</P>
<P>
"Serious discussions are underway. We're keeping our fingers crossed," reveals 
Dubrow, who's teamed on the project with husband John McTiernan (director of 
"The Hunt for Red October"), who'll produce and direct for 20th Century-Fox. 
</P>
<P>
Dubrow, senior vice president of production for Nelson Ent., first lassoed 
"Road Show" -- based on Robert Day's novel -- in 1977. MGM acquired rights to 
the project in the fall of 1978; Martin Ritt and, later, Richard Brooks, were 
the talked-about directors. 
</P>
<P>
There was a flurry of casting speculation. Finally, in 1983, after Jack 
Nicholson, Timothy Hutton and Mary Steenburgen were set to star, MGM -- which 
had undergone a change of management -- canceled the project. After much 
litigation, Dubrow got a settlement -- and her project back. Robert Getchell 
("Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore") scripts. 
</P>
<P>
"Road Show," which Dubrow dubs " 'The African Queen' on the range" -- is 
expected to roll this summer in Montana and Wyoming. "Hopefully with Sean and 
Cher," says Dubrow. "Just the idea of it! The sparks will fly!" Pat H. Broeske

OUTTAKES: IN SEARCH OF . . . ESTELLE PARSONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Mary Helen Berg 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When actress Estelle Parsons arrived on the set of "Dick Tracy" last May, she 
informed producer-director-star Warren Beatty of a small oversight: "I said, 
'Warren, I've never even seen a script. I haven't a clue what you mean when you 
say I'm gonna do the scene now.' " 
</P>
<P>
Beatty's not usually so absent-minded, says Parsons, who has a small role in 
"Tracy" as Tess Trueheart's muffin-baking mom. "With Warren, the project is 
really more important than life itself. You know that it's going to be 
perfectly, exactly what he wants. . . . It's like working for some of the old 
theater greats." 
</P>
<P>
"Tracy" opens June 15. And Parsons will be seen again later this year as 
Elliott Gould's tyrannical housekeeper in Miramax's "The Lemon Sisters." But 
the actress hasn't been all that visible on the big screen since winning an 
Oscar for her first film role more than two decades ago as the giddy wife of a 
gangster (played by Gene Hackman) in "Bonnie and Clyde" (1967), which had 
Beatty as star and producer. 
</P>
<P>
(The chameleon-like actress can also be seen in her recurring guest spot as 
Roseanne Barr's mom on ABC's "Roseanne.") 
</P>
<P>
The three-time Tony nominee and two-time Obie winner tells us that she turns 
down several movie offers each year -- theater is her "real" work. On the 
agenda for fall is a starring role as a Kentucky hills woman in an Off-Broadway 
production. 
</P>
<P>
"Theater is the actor's medium," says Parsons from her Manhattan apartment, 
which she shares with attorney-husband Peter Zimroth and their 6-year-old 
adopted son, Abraham. "Film belongs to directors. The actor has a great sense 
of power in the theater. I just love it." 
</P>
<P>
Even after Broadway roles ranging from a singing nursemaid "The Pirates of 
Penzance" (1981) to a dictatorial teacher in her one-woman show "Miss 
Margarida's Way" (originally mounted in 1977, revived briefly last winter), and 
scores of Off-Broadway and regional theater productions, Parsons says one goal 
is elusive.

OUTTAKES: CLEAR AND PRESENT STAR

<TEXT>
<P>
Alec Baldwin -- oh so hot, including a spread in the current Newsweek -- is in 
"discussions" with Paramount about stepping back into the shoes of author Tom 
Clancy's fictional hero Jack Ryan for the studio's adaptation of Clancy's 
"Clear and Present Danger." If a deal can be set, Baldwin will continue the 
role of the fictional CIA analyst he plays in "The Hunt for Red October." 
</P>
<P>
"He did a wonderful job and we certainly want him," says producer Bob Rehme, 
who holds movie rights to the Clancy drug-war themed thriller with partner Mace 
Neufeld and Paramount. But Rehme also says there was "nothing up front" -- no 
advance deal made for Baldwin to remain in the Ryan role beyond "Red October." 
</P>
<P>
Rehme tells us that the studio is "clearly anxious" to move fast on its next 
Clancy film. So fast, in fact, that filmmaker John Milius is currently doing 
double duty: Wrapping up post-production on his July release, "Flight of the 
Intruder," while writing the "Clear and Present Danger" screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have a script this summer and hope to go into production next year," 
Rehme says. "It will be a very big film involving locations on a couple of 
continents, but there aren't any underwater scenes and not as many special 
effects -- so it'll be easier than 'Red October.'

KFAC RECORDINGS: STUCK IN THE STACKS

<TEXT>
<P>
A critical lack of funds has made a virtual prisoner of the 50,000 recordings 
donated to Stanford University by KFAC, Los Angeles' late classical music radio 
station. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly eight months after being officially donated, the collection is 
languishing behind locked doors of a second-story, environmentally controlled 
storage area in the Braun Music Center on the Palo Alto campus. The collection, 
with strengths in opera and in classical music from the Baroque period through 
20th-Century compositions, could remain immobilized and uncatalogued for as 
long as two years. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Sawka, head of the university's Archive of Recorded Sound, said that 
the Oct. 17 Bay Area earthquake has caused the university to be in a "tighter 
than usual" budget period. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, storage areas slated for the record collection are being used to 
house materials moved from earthquake damaged areas of the campus. She also 
said existing funds are being redirected to repair those damaged facilities.

contemporary format (92.3 FM), said he had not been informed about the stalled 
status of the recordings. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised," said De Castro, who estimated the donation's value between 
$50,000 to $750,000 depending on whether it is evaluated as a collection or as 
individual items. "We worked with the movers at our expense to ship the 
recordings." 
</P>
<P>
Public access to the collection remains in the distant future. Sawka said it 
may take as long as two years before her staff of three full-time workers could 
unpack the 481 boxes of the collection and computer-catalogue all the items. 
Her first priority: shelf space. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope we could start (unpacking the recordings) within a year's time 
(but) the budget is hard pressed because of the earthquake," she said. "The 
critical problem is shelf space. One could hope for budget help from outside 
donors, but shelving is not a very glamorous item." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the size of the KFAC library, acquired over more than half-century 
during the station broadcasts in classical music, Sawka said that even if the 
university authorized another staff member it would take a year to complete the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
The KFAC donation increased the archives' holdings of classical music 
recordings by a third, but that figure may be reduced once duplicate recordings 
are culled by Sawka's staff. "At the very least 50% (of the donation) would be 
new material," Sawka said, "I would be very happy if we got 50%." 
</P>
<P>
A similar KFAC donation of about 5,000 compact discs made to the Los Angeles 
Public Library last year are also unavailable for public use. But at least part 
of the CD collection will gain its freedom as early as mid-summer, according to 
Joan Bartel, Los Angeles Central Library assistant director. 
</P>
<P>
Shackled with similar financial and space constraints as Stanford, the L.A. 
library, Bartel said, is negotiating to have an outside firm catalogue the 
materials. "If we go with the (outside) processing," she said, "the first 500 
might be available by the end of June or the first of July. 
</P>
<P>
"If cataloguing is done by the (library) staff, it may be the same time period 
but with far fewer titles."

THE SEATTLE SOUND: UNDERGROUND ROCK GETS A BOOST FROM SUB POP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The headline on Sub Pop Records' ads in the rockzines reads, "Hey Loser." And 
when the owners of the small, Seattle-based company come to Los Angeles, they 
walk the two miles from a budget motel to their attorney's office in Century 
City. Why waste money on a cab or car rental? 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, you wouldn't confuse Sub Pop's roster of recording artists with 
anything found on major labels: a squadron of former Muzak employees, 
lumberjacks and a 300-pound butcher from Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
In a world where vinyl is obsolete, tiny Sub Pop -- whose offerings have been 
described as everything from post-post-post-punk to neo-proto-heavy-metal -- 
specializes in 7-inch singles. 
</P>
<P>
Where slick, 24-track, digital recording is standard, most Sub Pop releases are 
recorded on an old eight-track machine. 
</P>
<P>
Yet nearly every major record company in the country has been sniffing around 
Sub Pop and its alternative-chart-topping acts, with an eye toward acquiring 
the label and/or its talent. The pickings include Mudhoney, Nirvana, Tad, L7 
and the Fluid. Sub Pop music rules college radio the way bands from Athens, Ga. 
did five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The label slings hordes of guys around the country in Tradesman vans, bands who 
flip their long hair on beer-soaked stages and loudly deconstruct '70s 
stadium-rock cliches for the indie-record fan. 
</P>
<P>
Sub Pop is the nexus between Guns N' Roses (who reconstruct '70s cliches) and 
the abstruse pop-isms of R.E.M. The label's offerings have more or less 
single-handedly brought aggressive rock back to college radio and made Seattle 
the center for alternative music in the U.S., the way Factory Records made 
Manchester the world capital of gloom in the late '70s or Prince made 
Minneapolis the international headquarters for moody funk. A Seattle band -- 
any Seattle band -- can pack a club almost anywhere in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
And at a time when white rock 'n' roll is as stale and directionless as it ever 
was in the mid '70s, Sub Pop's acts make a glorious noise unto the bored: 
throbbing, confrontational, guitar-based rock, bottom-heavy, fuzzed-out and 
greasy, as grounded in Blue Cheer, the Sonics and the Stooges as it is in the 
Zep. 
</P>
<P>
This grunge factory has as distinctive a house sound as anything since Memphis' 
legendary Stax, creating a regional identity strong enough to eclipse that of 
other Seattle acts such as Heart or Sir Mix-a-Lot, who sell 10 times what any 
Sub Pop band does. It issues consistently hard-rockin' product: art music for 
people who instinctively hate art. You might even call Sub Pop's sound dumb art 
music -- dumb art music that rocks. 
</P>
<P>
"What I hate is a really pretentious attitude," Sub Pop co-owner Bruce Pavitt 
said over a frosty ale during an interview at a West Hollywood biker bar. 
(Pavitt and partner Jonathan Poneman insisted on meeting at the bar because 
they had heard it had a lot of different kinds of beer.) "The 'We've got a 
degree from art school and we're going to reinvent pop' sort of thing is what 
killed rock 'n' roll." 
</P>
<P>
"Our bands were all lumberjacks," Poneman said. "Or they painted bridges." 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a real difference, though, between -- well, there's dumb and 
then there's really dumb," Pavitt said. "We don't do the really dumb. 
</P>
<P>
"I think rock 'n' roll should be fun. Why bother to say 'Die Yuppie Scum' when 
you can parody all the corporate mania that's been going on all these years?" 
</P>
<P>
If the Sub Pop attitude sounds like something you'd enjoy, a randomly chosen 
disc from the label is as sure a bet as a Def Jam record was to a rap fan in 
'86 or a Sun single was to a rockabilly nut 30 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Sub Pop began in 1980 as a fanzine called Subterranean Pop, a Pavitt-edited 
spinoff of OP (later Option) covering U.S. independent music region by region. 
It was also one of the first 'zines with a cassette-compilation format. 
</P>
<P>
In '86, Pavitt released "Sub Pop 100," a vinyl compilation that featured Skinny 
Puppy and Sonic Youth, among others. He hooked up a year later with Poneman, 
who had been a deejay at the University of Washington radio station, hired 
producer Jack Endino, and became a local label with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
In its first few months, Sub Pop put out classic EPs by Soundgarden (now on 
A&amp;M) and Green River, inventors, with the legendary Melvins, of the famous 
riffy Seattle grunge sound (Green River later split into Mother Love Bone and 
Mudhoney). 
</P>
<P>
Next came a series of colored-vinyl singles from Seattle-area bands released in 
severely limited editions, the sheer rarity of which made them irresistible to 
record collectors. Then followed a spate of LPs, the all-Northwest "Sub Pop 
200" compilation, and even singles from out-of-state artists. 
</P>
<P>
"There's something Machiavellian about our business plan, because the whole 
mystique of the label tends to grow proportionally to the records' 
unavailability," Poneman said. "Of course, it could backfire -- we'd really 
like to sell 100, 200, 300,000 copies of a Mudhoney record -- but in the 
meantime, we're going to continue to do business the way we've been doing it." 
(Mudhoney so far has sold 30,000 in the States, 60,000 in Europe, making it a 
superstar in the underground indie scene.) 
</P>
<P>
The intense demand for Sub Pop product allowed the label to do two things few 
indies have yet tried: They ship their records on a C.O.D. basis to a few 
independent stores, eliminating the traditional bane of the industry -- slow 
payment and bankrupt distributors -- while strengthening their cash flow. And 
the bulk of their singles go to a "singles club," a $35-per-year service that 
nets subscribers a limited-edition 7-inch in the mail each month from bands 
around the country. 
</P>
<P>
This small-is-beautiful system, while limiting growth -- the chains, where by 
far the majority of records are sold, don't deal on a C.O.D. basis -- allows 
Sub Pop to thrive as a small business. 
</P>
<P>
"When some labels put out records," Poneman said, "somebody runs off with their 
money in Europe. When three distributors go out of business on the West Coast 
in one month, which happened a couple of years ago, it zaps all their funds. 
But whenever we ship a new record, we get a major influx of cash right off the 
bat. . . . It's like, let's make some money. 
</P>
<P>
"As a label, we've had a choice to make: pour all our eggs into one basket and 
then watch that band go on to another label who will exploit what we did; or 
limit our distribution, have stronger cash flow and pour the money we make back 
into the band's career, helping them tour, make videos and other things indies 
of our size can't even think of doing. Major labels, who have a big enough 
capital base, can't be spontaneous, can't reflect the street." 
</P>
<P>
Soundgarden, whose awesome 1987 "Screaming Life" EP is perhaps the 
quintessential document of heavy Seattle grunge, was the first (and so far 
only) band to leave the label, first to SST, for which they recorded the 
Grammy-nominated "Ultramega OK" LP before being snapped up by powerhouse 
A&amp;M. 
</P>
<P>
"Bruce and Jonathan are the Don Kings of Seattle rock 'n' roll," Soundgarden 
guitarist Kim Thayil said of the Sub Pop owners. "The scene was already there; 
they just packaged it." 
</P>
<P>
Pavitt and Poneman prefer to think of their label as a punk-rock Motown. "We 
think that emphasis on singles, that drive toward classic songwriting is 
vital," Poneman said. "Putting someone in a 48-track studio with a name 
producer and the drum sound of the week isn't necessarily going to make great 
rock 'n' roll." 
</P>
<P>
"That's what the '60s punk bands were all about," Pavitt said. "Great anthems 
that could potentially change your life, especially if you were 16 years old 
and hated your parents. 
</P>
<P>
"Music Machine's (1966 hit) 'Talk Talk' was like that. So is Mudhoney's 'Touch 
Me, I'm Sick.' We're pretty assertive about letting bands know what we like. 
But there's no Holland or Dozier or Holland lurking around here. Basically, 
from the beginning a lot of our bands have hung out together, been produced by 
the same guy, an ongoing musical dialogue in Seattle. We just happen to be 
around to capture it. And the out-of-town bands are ones our other artists have 
played with and raved about. I think it's important to run a label like a large 
family." 
</P>
<P>
But what about the hype? 
</P>
<P>
"We use the same machinery as everybody else," Poneman said. "We made certain 
investments to get the press happening -- hiring a brilliant publicist in 
England; bouncing our rent check to get Mudhoney a van to go out on the road; 
flying certain European journalists to Seattle -- that most indies wouldn't. 
The payoff, ultimately, is that you get coverage. I'd like to perpetuate the 
myth that there's a grass-roots explosion for Seattle grunge, but the truth is 
that we've helped it happen." 
</P>
<P>
Said Pavitt, "What would the Stones have been without the hype? Just a white 
R&amp;B band with some good songs."

"If I should die in a car wreck / May I have Van Morrison in my tape deck," 
sings Poi Doggie Frank Orrall, perhaps the greatest line of sublime affection 
for music since, well, since Van the Man himself sang about how Jackie Wilson 
sent him heavenward back in 1972. Not that this Austin-via-Honolulu band sounds 
anything like Morrison. 
</P>
<P>
Or anyone else, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
A panoply of musical styles -- Afro-Hawaiian sort of describes some of it -- 
and the multiple pleasures of life make up the world beat trod by Poi Dog: 
simple things like "Spending the Day in the Shirt that You Wore," spending the 
night cuddled up like a "Big Beautiful Spoon" or walking instead of riding (the 
Jonathan Richman-like "The Ancient Egyptians"). But as Orrall sings, "The 
simplest things, so hard to achieve," and he's achieved the remarkable with a 
joyously pan-emotional report to his late mother ("The Me Who Was Your Son"), 
the peak of an album that can pull you through bad times and make good ones 
that much better. Steve Hochman

POP EYE: VAN HALEN OPENS A BAJA MARGARITAVILLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Celebrities just can't resist opening a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Whether it was Don Drysdale's Dugout in Van Nuys, Alan Hale's Lobster Barrel in 
West Hollywood or Dino's Lodge on the Sunset Strip, Los Angeles always has been 
jammed with Hollywood name-brand eateries. 
</P>
<P>
Now one of rock's superstar attractions, Van Halen, is getting into the act, 
but not in overcrowded L.A. Instead, the band is opening a sprawling new 
restaurant tonight in its favorite vacation spot, Cabo San Lucas on the tip of 
Baja California. Called Cabo Wabo (after a Van Halen song of the same name), 
the nightspot will seat up to 250 patrons inside (and 750 in an outdoor patio). 
In keeping with the group's raucous image, the bar offers dozens of varieties 
of tequila and beer, including the band's own Cabo Wabo brand. 
</P>
<P>
The band is christening the joint tonight by putting on its first live 
performance in 18 months. "We've been rehearsing for a month because we're 
starting to work on a new album," said Sammy Hagar, the driving force behind 
the eatery. "It's going to be a fun, no-pressure event. We'll do an all-guitar 
set and bring a bunch of people up to play -- everyone from Kip Winger to Elton 
John." 
</P>
<P>
After the opening fete, the band plans to leave most of its instruments -- and 
a full PA system -- at the club to encourage future jam sessions. "You might 
walk in some night and see me playing with Hank Williams Jr. or Neil Young," 
Hagar said. "And there'll never be a cover charge. So if someone wants to play 
a slow blues song for three days, who can complain?" 
</P>
<P>
Hagar said whenever he'd get a few days off from touring, he'd head for Cabo 
San Lucas. "I always had this fantasy about building a cantina where the guys 
could hang out and play." 
</P>
<P>
Though Hagar has been overseeing most of the construction details, working with 
Mexican architect Marcos Monroy Jr., all four Van Halen members -- and manager 
Ed Leffler -- are equal partners, along with Mexican partner, Jorge Viana, who 
has run several clubs in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Hagar said he originally intended spending $150,000 -- and the group has gone 
"far beyond" that. "We're not doing this expecting to make money," he said. "So 
if we do, it'll be a bonus." 
</P>
<P>
Cabo Wabo will serve -- in Hagar's words -- "only the best" native tequilas and 
mescals, made from fermented cactus juice by a government-licensed Mexican 
family brewery. However, only half of Van Halen can actually enjoy them. Both 
guitarist Eddie Van Halen and his brother Alex, the band's drummer, are on the 
"Just Say No" bandwagon, having quit drinking after years of booze and drug 
problems. According to Hagar, Alex has been sober for three years, Eddie for 
about four months. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the only drawback about this, because I don't want people to think 
we're promoting drinking," said Hagar. "Some people can handle it. Others 
can't. So I have virgin margaritas all ready for Eddie and Alex. I'm so crazy 
about Eddie, and I know how much hell he went through, that we want to be real 
supportive and keep him on the wagon." 
</P>
<P>
Since everyone else will probably ask the same question at tonight's opening, 
we needled Hagar -- when will the new Van Halen album be ready? "Who knows?" he 
said cheerfully. "The last two records were rushed because we had to meet a 
timetable. This time we don't want to have any regrets. So we're gonna do it 
till we think it's right, regardless of what everyone else thinks!"

If you've been keeping track, you've probably noticed that A&amp;M president 
Gil Friesen isn't the only key exec who has abruptly left the troubled label in 
recent weeks. So far our scorecard includes Jeff Gold (who's joined Warner 
Bros. as senior vice president of creative services), David Steffen, the 
label's sales and distribution chief, and Jesus Garber, the chief of its black 
promotion department, who have departed without announcing any official plans. 
While the dust settles, A&amp;M is being run by Jerry Moss, who sold the label 
to PolyGram Records last year but remains a powerful force, especially with 
PolyGram battling its own leadership-vacuum dilemmas. With the exception of its 
current Janet Jackson smash (which has topped the 4-million mark in sales), 
hits at the label have been few and far between. Which brings us to the next 
big question: Will Charlie Minor, A&amp;M's colorful promotion mogul, be the 
next to depart? 
</P>
<P>
Officially, nobody at A&amp;M is talking. Industry insiders say Minor might 
stay, but probably only if he gets offered presidency stripes. If not, he could 
take one of several job possibilities -- it's been widely reported that Minor 
has been talking to Irving Azoff about joining his new record label, though 
Azoff has insisted there are still several candidates for the job. Meanwhile, 
it's likely that A&amp;M won't be looking outside the label to replace the 
departed execs. "They'll have fewer chiefs," says one industry observer. "But 
PolyGram will give Moss autonomy, as long as he can get the label going again." 
That should be a challenge. A&amp;M has broken Seduction, a young female 
dance-music act, but its upcoming pop releases focus on adventuresome (but 
low-selling) critic faves like Suzanne Vega, John Hiatt and the Neville 
Brothers. The label's biggest commercial hope is a fall album from Bryan Adams, 
who had several huge mid-'80s hits, but needs to rebound from a disappointing 
last album.

Even if Little Richard didn't do the ceremony, producer Chuck Plotkin and his 
New Jersey-born bride, Wendy Brand Chaft, had plenty of musical fireworks at 
their wedding reception last weekend in Santa Monica. Of course, not everyone's 
as well connected as Plotkin, one of Bruce Springsteen's longtime producers and 
confidantes. 
</P>
<P>
The Boss returned the favor by performing "It's Gonna Work Out Fine" (with 
Jimmy Wood), saluting the bride by doing "Jersey Girl," accompanied by Tom 
Waits, who handled a solo version of "Fever." The squad of post-nuptial 
background vocalists included Patti Scialfa, Andrew Gold and Karla Bonoff. . . 
. At his second show at the Universal Amphitheatre last weekend, Van Morrison 
brought out Robbie Robertson to play guitar for a lengthy jam-version of 
"Moondance." . . . And if you're hungry for outrageous, Vegas-style nightmare 
pop theater, don't miss Bubba Lou Vickers (otherwise known as Bud E. Luv), who 
makes a rare appearance Thursday at Cafe Largo on Fairfax. The post-modern 
lounge artist's act includes a medley of three B.J. Thomas hits and a 
drum-machine version of Bobby Brown's "My Prerogative."

What promises to be the most unusual collaboration of the year? Could it be 
Mojo Nixon's proposed new band, which includes ex-X leader John Doe and the 
Beat Farmers' Country Dick Montana? Nixon is calling the congregation the 
"world's first cow-punk supergroup." . . . The B-52's' Kate Pierson has cut a 
duet with Iggy Pop for his upcoming album. . . . I.R.S. is releasing a live

classix-trax as "Tempted," "Is That Love," "Black Coffee in Bed" and "Pulling

LOS ANGELES ART: IS IT A (WORLD) CLASS ACT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Santayana once said, "Most people think that genius is as common as 
cheese, whereas it is as rare as love." Christopher Knight's "Is L.A. a 
World-Class Art City?" (April 8) was well intentioned and made some good points 
but didn't bite the real bullet. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is that he confuses art success with institutional and commercial 
success. Nothing could be farther apart. Art is simply much harder to do than 
you think. 
</P>
<P>
You can't (and never will) have a real art city, center, movement, whatever, if 
you persist in calling second-class art first-class art. It's as simple as 
that. 
</P>
<P>
What passes as first-class art is mainly halfhearted, half-understood, 
half-achieved art efforts that have been puffed up by culturally illiterate 
taste makers; these pass off the second-rate goods largely to perpetuate their 
authority and to ingratiate themselves with a possibly more ignorant collector 
class whose interest it is to call it all art so that they can make power plays 
with their money and social networks (including museums). 
</P>
<P>
The thing that has made New York an art town is not the money, the hype, the 
hoke, the museums, but the continuing existence of a relatively few artists who 
aspire to serious achievement. The rest is a media success. 
</P>
<P>
Marcel Duchamp (influential but himself somewhere between a second- and a 
third-rate artist) held that when times were bad for art, the real artists 
would go underground. That's where most of them are now -- but the promoters 
and the puffers-up will never discover it.

CD PACKAGING AND PLANET EARTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is no question that excess packaging has to stop. It's absurd to say, as 
did the owner of the Tower Records chain, that "there's less paper used in CD 
packages than one Sunday issue of the L.A. Times." 
</P>
<P>
Reading the Sunday Times can take a whole afternoon. I don't think the same can 
be said for the packaging on a CD.

CD PACKAGING AND PLANET EARTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With all the hoopla over CD packaging ("Are CDs Destroying Our Planet?," the 
April 15 Pop Eye column), I can't believe no one is raising a voice against 
those annoying plastic CD storage cases. They're heavy, expensive, bulky, hard 
to open, easy to break and certainly not biodegradable. 
</P>
<P>
By switching to cardboard sleeves like those used for vinyl records, retailers 
(and consumers) could store three times as many CDs in the same space. And, due 
to reduced weight, stores would save a bundle on shipping. 
</P>
<P>
But even a cardboard sleeve is unnecessary. Because CDs are relatively hard to 
damage, they could be simply tucked into their own liner notes, and 150 would 
fit in a shoebox! 
</P>
<P>
When someone starts buying CD cases for reuse or recycling, I'll be the first 
in line.

ENGINE OF ANIMATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a CalArts alumnus (1980), I found David Wharton's April 15 article included 
a typical omission -- that of the names and contributions of former 
character-animation students. He's not alone; it's an omission made by almost 
all of the arts community. 
</P>
<P>
Where were the names of Tim Burton, John Musker, John Lassiter, Ron Clemmons 
and others? 
</P>
<P>
For the past 30 years, animation has been treated as a bastard child, not 
really considered art and not really considered film. I would contend it has 
had a greater influence on world culture than many of the other arts. 
</P>
<P>
Look at advances in computer graphics. Look at shopping malls and theme 
restaurants patterned after the Disneyland model, and now the more serious 
works of Michael Graves, Arata Isozaki and Frank Gehry. 
</P>
<P>
Look at fashion. Then take a good look at the turn toward the broad and the 
cartoony in live-action films, following a string of animated hits. Now look at 
prime-time television. And guess what's selling at Sotheby's! 
</P>
<P>
Behind the reinvigorated animation industry is the CalArts character animation 
school.

THEATER NOTEBOOK: 5 IS ENOUGH FOR THE STAR OF 'FAMILY SECRETS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Welcome to Sheri Glaser's family. There's Mort -- he's the well-meaning dad. 
Bev's the Jewish mother; law school and lithium keep her steady since a nervous 
breakdown long ago. Rose is Bev's mother, falling in love at a seniors' 
residence. Granddaughter Fern -- champion of the alternate lifestyle -- is 
preparing for a home birth. Her younger sister, Sandra, lost her virginity last 
night and is waiting for him to call. 
</P>
<P>
Glaser plays all five, with quick clothes changes and expert physical and vocal 
adjustments, in "Family Secrets" at the Heliotrope Theatre in Hollywood, a 
quintet of poignant monologues written by the actress and her husband, Gregory 
Howells. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Glaser premiered a version of the work -- then called "Secrets of 
Life" -- at the Rose Theatre. Though it was well-received, friends suggested 
she create a structure for the disparate voices. 
</P>
<P>
"It was obvious that three of the characters were already my family," said the 
Bronx-born actress, 29. "And I can do my father -- or a father -- so I decided 
that family was the best way to go." 
</P>
<P>
In came Mort; out went Miguel and his New Age philosophies. Southerner Fern 
became New Yorker Fern. And the distance between the real-life Glasers and the 
make-believe Fishers got smaller and smaller. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course it's vulnerable," Glaser conceded. "What I'm doing is very personal. 
But I like feeling vulnerable out there. Like when Bev is talking about her 
confrontation with her own mother and expresses her abandonment. . . . Well, 
when my mother was 4, her mother had a nervous breakdown. And when I was 4, my 
mother had a nervous breakdown. So I was abandoned the same way she was. But my 
mother came back. So those feelings are mine." 
</P>
<P>
Most of what we hear from the humiliated teen-ager, Sandra, comes from real 
life, too. "My first sexual experience was even more graphic and painful," 
Glaser said dryly. In her initial monologue show, "Coping," which played in San 
Diego in 1987, the actress's own pregnancy was one of the focal segments. This 
time, she relates the birth. 
</P>
<P>
"The birthing piece is so powerful and universal, I feel kind of committed to 
it," Glaser said. "But I'd love to move on to the part I'm in now, 'cause this 
part is very funny and exciting and painful -- all those great elements. All 
the little diseases. I use cloth diapers; I'm fanatical about everything with 
her. She's never been immunized, never had antibiotics. She still nurses on and 
off. My daughter is 2 years old and -- this is embarrassing to say -- she runs 
my life." 
</P>
<P>
When she's done with motherhood? "Marriage and sex," Glaser said brightly. "I 
think it'd be hilarious to explore a marriage at this stage -- one that's 
working but isn't perfect: a lot of love and a lot of garbage. Power issues. 
Sex. Learning to be able to say, 'That doesn't feel good' or 'I'm not in the 
mood.' You know, learning to speak up." 
</P>
<P>
Glaser's current performance style evolved during years of theater work in San 
Diego, where after discovering improvisation and dropping out of college ("I'd 
found what I wanted") she appeared in the groups Hot Flashes and Egomaniacs. 
Now, happy in the solo format, she's looking forward to continuing plumbing the 
depths of Glaser family business, convinced that she'll never run out of 
material. 
</P>
<P>
Just as she weathers the psychic demands of her characters, Glaser has no fear 
of playing an old woman or a middle-aged man. 
</P>
<P>
"I imagine them both, looking out, and it's such a strong image," she said 
earnestly. "When I move into Rose, I feel that age in my body. Her age, his 
gender. I feel it as strongly as I can. With her, I imagine this old, old body 
sitting down. And my dad -- I know his body. There's a cyst there, hair on his 
chest, a scar. I know a lot about him. I know his smell. I know his strength 
when he hugs me. I have so much information inside me." 
</P>
<P>
"Family Secrets" plays at the Heliotrope Theatre, 660 N. Heliotrope Ave., 
Hollywood, at 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays, 2 and 7 p.m. Sundays, through May 
6. (213) 466-1767. Tickets are $15.

PUPPETS HELP KIDS BREAK THE ICE WITH DISABLED CLASSMATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD S. PALMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sight of the 3-foot-tall puppet wearing crutches and leg braces prompted 
many questions from the children at Palm Crest Elementary School in La Canada 
Flintridge. 
</P>
<P>
"Do your legs hurt?" 
</P>
<P>
"Did you catch spina bifida, or did you have it when you were born?" 
</P>
<P>
The questions were from a group of about 75 fourth-graders. But when the 
puppet's adult operator, Kris Clark, replies, she lets "Valerie" do the 
talking. 
</P>
<P>
Valerie is a large puppet for which Clark provides voice and movement. They are 
both part of the "Kids on the Block" program. Together with a group of about a 
dozen volunteers from the Women's Council of Verdugo Hills Hospital and 
Foundation, they are helping schoolchildren make friends with disabled students 
in their classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"This program makes it much more comfortable for everyone," said Clark, a 
housewife who is co-chairwoman of the local group. She is not handicapped but 
has an 8-year-old daughter with spina bifida, which attacks the legs. 
</P>
<P>
Clark and the "Kids on the Block" characters have been visiting schools two or 
three times a month for the last three years. Clark said the volunteers and 
their colorful puppets, which depict specific disabilities, perform for groups 
of about 60. 
</P>
<P>
The puppets are about the size of a 3-year-old child and are expensive -- $700 
to $1,200. Part of the expense lies in the accessories, such as Valerie's 
crutches and leg braces. 
</P>
<P>
Alyce Russell, who operates one of the puppets, said: "It's so important for 
(the children) to be able to ask questions. That breaks down the barrier."

FIRE PROTECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your recent report of the De Luz annexation by the North County Fire Protection 
District ("De Luz Fights Annexation Bid by Fire District," March 31) leads to 
the inescapable conclusion that this annexation is favored by Chief Andrew 
Vanderlaan, while the rest of the community is being dragged along kicking and 
screaming. 
</P>
<P>
This, in fact, is not the case. 
</P>
<P>
While a segment of the area is opposed to the annexation, the dissenters were 
unable to muster sufficient protests to prevent the question from going to the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is the majority of the De Luz residents are in favor of the 
annexation, which will provide full-year fire protection in accordance with 
provisions that evolved after two years of negotiations for a reasonable 
response time at a reasonable cost.

A CALL FOR HELP GOES UNHEEDED IN EL CAJON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNEED, Sneed is a professor of journalism at San Diego State University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Cajon residents should not take police protection for granted. My wife and I 
learned that March 19 when we tried to summon police help through 911 to stop a 
man from injuring a woman and a baby in a small park across the street from our 
home. 
</P>
<P>
The man was straddling the woman, who was lying on the ground. The two were 
engaged in a heated argument and, though I saw no blood, the woman was getting 
roughed up as she struggled to climb into the back of a pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
Amid cursing, I heard the man shout: "Get out of my life, bitch!" The man then 
dragged the woman from the back of the truck and another altercation ensued. 
Somehow, the woman managed to crawl back into the pickup bed, where she grabbed 
a baby. 
</P>
<P>
The man then got into the truck and floored the gas pedal. In a frantic few 
seconds, the truck lurched forward, the woman held on for dear life, and the 
baby slipped from her grasp. My heart was in my mouth since the tailgate was 
down. 
</P>
<P>
The woman shrieked, causing the man to hit the brakes long enough for her to 
retrieve the infant, who tottered precariously on the tailgate. The truck then 
sped off. 
</P>
<P>
This all took less than two minutes. I am somewhat embarrassed that I stood and 
watched. During those hectic moments, my first thought was about cases where 
assault victims cried out for help and bystanders ignored their pleas. 
</P>
<P>
Still, I froze. I was shaken because, before my wife told me a man and a woman 
were fighting, I could hear muffled screams and prayed that my 4-year-old 
daughter hadn't been hit by a car or abducted. Selfishly, I was relieved that 
my family wasn't in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
I also didn't try to intervene because, in another flashback, I knew that 
domestic disputes often erupt into situations where both parties, and even 
intervenors, can be injured or killed. I suppose thinking about myself and my 
family is only human, but I felt that the sanest thing to do was to call the 
police. 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I figured the police would arrive at any moment. Alas, no squad car 
showed up. At all! 
</P>
<P>
While I am troubled by my own behavior, I am more troubled by the absence of 
police response. Does someone have to be maimed or killed before the police 
react? Is dragging a woman out of a truck by her heels, wrestling her to the 
ground and roughing her up not sufficient cause for the police to respond? 
</P>
<P>
Would it have taken the baby tumbling onto the street and getting killed for 
the police to be dispatched? Perhaps the 911 operators are trained to sort out 
legitimate calls. But this was a legitimate call, one that could have exploded 
into a life-threatening situation. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, burglars broke into our home, and my wife called 911. Then, the El 
Cajon police arrived in a timely fashion. 
</P>
<P>
A 50% response rate, however, doesn't cut it. It isn't what legitimate callers 
to the 911 number expect.

STING: THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES TAUGHT IN THE CLASSROOM LOSE THEIR MEANING 
WHEN POLICE AND SCHOOLS USE LIES, DECEPTION AND DUPLICITY IN AN ATTEMPT TO DO 
SOMETHING ABOUT DRUGS.

<P>
Another sting operation in San Diego schools. 
</P>
<P>
Undercover police agents pose for six months as students in three San Diego 
high schools to ferret out drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
We read about the raids in the newspaper and are comforted. More self 
congratulation that San Diego moves aggressively to protect its children from 
the horror of drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Let's agree upon one thing: The cost to our society of drug abuse in terms of 
ruined lives, grieving families and crimes inflicted on others is incalculable. 
</P>
<P>
Action must be taken to stem the momentum of this scourge. 
</P>
<P>
Our hearts go out to those distraught parents who are daily witness to the 
deterioration of their addicted children. 
</P>
<P>
But, in our enthusiasm to "do something about it," we should look very 
carefully at the consequences of our actions. 
</P>
<P>
"Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty," Thomas Jefferson warned. Sometimes 
the vigilance needed to protect our freedom is painful. Protecting the values 
of a free people is never easy. 
</P>
<P>
We have seen in East Germany how distrust permeated the very fabric of the 
community with fear and hate. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the Cold War, we have known that people in Soviet Bloc countries 
refused to talk openly for fear they would be informed upon. There was no 
trust. 
</P>
<P>
But not in this country. Here we pride ourselves as people with a reputation of 
"speaking our minds" to anyone. Here the police are civil servants -- friends 
who control automobile traffic, deliver babies on occasion, protect us from 
lawbreakers. 
</P>
<P>
Trust. 
</P>
<P>
That's what we take for granted in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the things we say may be imprudent or hurtful or simply stupid. But 
that is our choice. We are free to make jackasses out of ourselves. We never 
doubt that is our constitutional right. 
</P>
<P>
Living in a constitutional democracy means that sometimes lawbreakers go free. 
</P>
<P>
Dictatorships are tidier in that respect. Their wrongdoers are meted out swift 
and often lethal punishment. But in dictatorships, there is subjectivity in 
determining "wrongdoers." 
</P>
<P>
We try not to cross that line in our democracy. We are a nation of laws whose 
ideal is to judge all people by identical standards. 
</P>
<P>
So, finally, we return to the sting operation in the San Diego schools. 
</P>
<P>
The head of the San Diego police narcotics task force is quoted as saying, "The 
previous raids have taught high school kids a lesson. Obviously, there's a 
paranoia (among students) now." 
</P>
<P>
If the narcotics officer meant that the student paranoia was an indication of 
the success of the sting, the "benefits" of the sting warrant closer 
examination. 
</P>
<P>
When our young people are taught to distrust their classmates, how then are we 
different from those totalitarian states we have traditionally abhorred? 
</P>
<P>
There is a story that during the blitz of Britain in 1940 it was determined 
that the British anti-aircraft effort against the German bombers was 
ineffective. The shells could not reach the required altitude. 
</P>
<P>
To save munitions, the shelling was discontinued. Immediately, the civilian 
population became extremely upset with the silence. The sound of the ack-ack 
obviously fulfilled their need to feel as if protection were being provided. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-aircraft shelling was resumed and the people were comforted. The 
government accommodated the public need at only the cost of the shells. 
</P>
<P>
After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. government, to give the appearance 
that it was doing something, interned U.S. citizens of Japanese descent. 
</P>
<P>
The damage to the integrity of our government and to the Japanese-American 
internees as a result of that effort to accommodate a purported need of the 
people is irreparable. 
</P>
<P>
The stings are not just a police operation. Because the San Diego Police 
Department is an arm of city government, in effect, the stings are a 
cooperative effort of the City of San Diego and the San Diego Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
The city and the school district, by implementing the sting, are making the 
statement that there is a terrible drug abuse problem in the schools, and they 
are doing something about it. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the benefits are dubious; the paranoia is real, however. 
</P>
<P>
It is foolhardy to believe that young people can be taught democratic 
principles in a classroom and still retain a belief in those principles while 
observing lies, deception and duplicity around them in those same classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The living example of the school system and Police Department in acknowledged 
collusion to deceive them, no matter how noble the purpose, teaches the wrong 
lesson. 
</P>
<P>
The city and the city schools find themselves in a dilemma. But they should be 
aware that standing firm against public frustration in order to serve the 
long-range best interests of students is also courageous. 
</P>
<P>
Would the school system incorporate into its curriculum the premise that deceit 
is acceptable when seeking a desirable end? 
</P>
<P>
Of course not. 
</P>
<P>
Would the school system incorporate into its curriculum the premise that to 
foster distrust among one's fellows in order to achieve a desirable end is 
acceptable? 
</P>
<P>
Of course not. 
</P>
<P>
Inculcating distrust in the minds of impressionable students is far more 
serious than lobbing futile shells at enemy aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Unified must find another way.

SHOULDER SEAT BELTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for your newspaper's excellent article about our settlement with Ford 
Motor Co. for failure to provide rear-seat shoulder harnesses in our Escort 
("Ford Settles for $6 Million in Suit," April 4). 
</P>
<P>
We feel it is very important that your readers know that, while rear-seat lap 
belts may prevent a person from being ejected, they can also cause death or 
paralysis in head-on collisions. 
</P>
<P>
We learned of this safety hazard the hard way when we were in a serious 
accident and lap belts broke the spines of our 11-year-old sons, killing one 
and leaving the other a paraplegic. 
</P>
<P>
Federal law requires that all 1990 cars be equipped with rear-seat shoulder 
harnesses. However, there are still millions of cars on the road which should 
be retrofitted with them. Unfortunately, many dealers are refusing to install 
the harnesses because they don't want to assume liability. 
</P>
<P>
We're urging consumers to demand that their dealers install the rear-seat 
shoulder harnesses. If your dealer refuses, write to your congressional 
representative. Don't take "no" for an answer. The life of your loved ones may 
depend on it.

4 HURT WHEN VEHICLES HIT CATTLE ON FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Five cattle wandered onto the Golden State Freeway in Castaic late Friday night 
and were struck and killed by two vehicles in collisions that injured four 
people and tied up traffic for more than two hours, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at 11:57 p.m. when a pickup traveling south struck at 
least one of the animals and went over a guardrail and down a 200-foot 
embankment, said Los Angeles County Fire Department Capt. Mike Carrick. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the truck, Derrick Ward, 33, of Pacifica, and a passenger, Joseph 
Roque, 46, of San Francisco, were taken to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital 
in Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
Roque suffered two broken legs along with head and chest injuries and was in 
satisfactory condition Saturday. Ward was admitted for observation for a 
possible bruised heart, a hospital spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
A search and rescue team from the Sheriff's Department pulled the two men from 
the embankment, Carrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Another car struck the cattle and two occupants were treated for minor 
injuries, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
While the freeway was being cleared, traffic was backed up on the southbound 
lanes for two to three miles, Carrick said. At one point, only one lane was 
open while Caltrans and county animal control workers removed the five animal 
carcasses. All lanes were reopened shortly after 2 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"In that particular area there are a number of cattle that are fenced in the 
range," Carrick said. "Apparently they escaped." 
</P>
<P>
Carrick said injuries from the accident could have been much worse.

'UPZONING' BLAMED FOR PRICE OF LAND; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS: CRITICS SAY COUNTY DECISIONS HAVE INFLATED THE COSTS OF 
SCENIC TRACTS, HINDERING EFFORTS TO BUY PARCELS FOR PUBLIC USE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County officials are undermining efforts to complete the Santa 
Monica Mountains National Recreation Area by relaxing zoning controls on 
mountain lands and, in effect, inflating the cost of scenic tracts the 
government wants to buy, according to key congressmen and advocates for the 
national park. 
</P>
<P>
At issue are decisions by Los Angeles County supervisors to "upzone" mountain 
lands to allow for more intensive development than land-use plans provide. 
Critics say upzoning has inflamed an already superheated market for mountain 
land and encouraged owners to demand more than the appraised value of their 
property. 
</P>
<P>
One such decision, for example, gave the owners of a piece of property the 
right to build 47 additional houses on land coveted for parklands, boosting the 
property's value by at least $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The result of such decisions, they say, is that lands needed for the park are 
made unaffordable and are lost to development, with luxury houses for the rich 
being built where nature preserves should be. 
</P>
<P>
California lawmakers and environmentalists, who plead each year for federal 
appropriations to expand the recreation area, said upzoning has become a sore 
point with key members of Congress, causing them to question how much support 
the park has from local officials. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors and their aides said they support the Santa Monica Mountains park 
but that they must also protect owners' rights to a fair return for their land. 
</P>
<P>
"We are living in a free country," said Supervisor Deane Dana, whose district 
includes the part of the recreation area along the Malibu coast. "We have no 
authority to freeze land values forever." 
</P>
<P>
But the upzoning decisions are troubling to a wide range of officials concerned 
about the park. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a perception among Members of Congress, who are in key positions to 
determine funding for parks, that Los Angeles County does not actively support 
setting aside open spaces for public use in the Santa Monicas," Sen. Pete 
Wilson (R-California) said in a letter to the supervisors more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
One such member is Rep. Ralph Regula of Ohio, the ranking Republican on the 
House Appropriations Committee's interior subcommittee, which budgets money for 
park acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
Upzoning is "driving up the cost of acquisition," Regula said. "If the county 
would like to have a national park . . . they've got to cooperate a little 
bit." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Chester Atkins (D-Mass.), also on the panel, said members are concerned 
"that we're getting maximum value for our money -- that we're not in a 
situation where things are happening with zoning . . . which are artificially 
inflating the value of the land and increasing the burden on the taxpayer." 
</P>
<P>
The situation has infuriated Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles), sponsor 
of the legislation that created the national recreation area in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot understand why, when there's such strong regional support for the 
national park, and when the need for more public open space in . . . the Los 
Angeles area is so obvious to everyone else, that the Board of Supervisors 
repeatedly makes decisions that allow the destruction of what little open space 
is left," Beilenson said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people would be enraged if they understood that this same supervisor 
that they cast their vote for . . . is also someone who's making it virtually 
impossible for the public to acquire parkland at a reasonable price, in order 
that some already wealthy developer can make additional millions building 
enormously high-priced houses, available only to millionaires, in areas where 
we shouldn't be building houses at all," Beilenson said. 
</P>
<P>
But supervisors and their aides said that such attacks are unfair and that they 
are on record as supporting the park. And although some beneficiaries of 
upzoning have been campaign contributors, they said their decisions had nothing 
to do with rewarding supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"The property owners do have rights," Dana said. "I would imagine we would be 
open for lawsuits if we restricted people's rights." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Vannatta, planning deputy for Supervisor Mike Antonovich, whose district 
includes the oak-robed hills and valleys of Agoura within the recreation area, 
said, "Mike is in support of the creation of the park." 
</P>
<P>
"What is the county to do?" Vannatta asked. "Is the county to unreasonably 
withhold development?" 
</P>
<P>
Extending over 155,000 acres from Griffith Park in Los Angeles to Point Mugu 
State Park in Ventura County, the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation 
Area is actually a mosaic of private lands and public preserves, owned by 
local, state and federal parks agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The National Park Service eventually is to own 37,910 acres in the area, but 
due to budget constraints it has acquired only 16,450 acres during the past 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, purchases to date have cost the federal government $118 million -- or 
three-fourths of the ceiling of $155 million in the legislation that created 
the recreation area. Congress eventually must raise the limit if acquisition is 
to continue. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy involves approvals of more intensive development than provided 
in the Malibu-Santa Monica Mountains Area Plan, adopted in 1981 as part of the 
county General Plan, and in the land-use element of the Malibu local coastal 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The plans control the number of homes or other developments that may be put on 
tracts of land. However, the limits can be relaxed for specific parcels, in 
response to requests from developers who present data to show that their 
proposals will not overburden roads, sewer systems and schools. 
</P>
<P>
Those requests, which are routine in all parts of the county, are, when granted 
for land in the Santa Monica Mountains, harmful to efforts to acquire parkland, 
congressmen and park advocates say. 
</P>
<P>
Critics stressed that they are not advocating "downzoning" of mountain tracts 
and that they merely want to hold the line at current building entitlements. 
</P>
<P>
They say upzoning complicates the daunting task of creating a national park at 
a time of tight federal budgets, and in a place where land prices already are 
among the nation's highest. 
</P>
<P>
Because of upzoning, they said, acquisition funds don't buy much and developers 
reject lucrative offers, based on current appraisals, because they expect the 
land to become more valuable if they seek easy-to-get upzoning. As a rule, 
parks agencies can only buy land at appraised values. 
</P>
<P>
Some conservationists see upzoning as a kind of "inverse condemnation," which 
causes blight and crowding to intrude on adjacent public preserves, thus 
denying taxpaying visitors full use and enjoyment of what their tax dollars 
have bought. 
</P>
<P>
But the main effect is to inflate land prices. And critics say it is being felt 
not only by the Park Service but also by the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy, a state parks agency that is a key player in development of the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be that the limiting factor was that we didn't have any money," 
said Joseph T. Edmiston, the conservancy's executive director. "Now the 
limiting factor . . . is the absence of willing sellers -- and we're not 
talking about willing sellers at less than market value." 
</P>
<P>
Landowners are so confident they can get upzoning that they, in effect, "laugh 
at" conservancy appraisals, Edmiston said. "There is such a history of 
upzoning," he said "that one would be a fool from just a pure business 
standpoint" not to assume he can get approval for more development from the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
But Vannatta, Antonovich's planning aide, said critics have exaggerated the 
amount of upzoning that has actually taken place. He said an analysis by county 
planners showed that since 1981, only about 450 more homes have been approved 
in the mountains within Antonovich's district than envisioned by the area plan. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors have done "a pretty credible job of sticking to" the plan, Vannatta 
said. 
</P>
<P>
David Brown, chairman of the Sierra Club's Santa Monica Mountains Task Force 
and vice president of the Las Virgenes Homeowners Federation, questioned 
Vannatta's estimate, saying his own analysis shows about 1,000 more units have 
been approved than provided in the area plan. 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston contended that the actual number doesn't matter as much as the effect 
of upzoning on developers' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Notwithstanding the complaints of Beilenson and others, the supervisors are on 
record in support of the Santa Monicas park. In May, 1988, they passed a 
resolution asking Congress for generous appropriations so scenic tracts would 
not "be lost to development." 
</P>
<P>
A few months later, they were reminded of this stand as they considered a 
controversial request to upzone the former Renaissance Pleasure Faire site in 
Agoura for a luxury home development, known as Paramount Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
The National Park Service and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy had long 
coveted the 320-acre site as an addition to the national recreation area. With 
that in mind, park supporters urged supervisors to approve no more than 103 
homes -- the maximum number for which the tract was zoned, which would keep the 
property more affordable for park acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson and Wilson, among others, warned the supervisors that they would be 
sending the wrong message to Congress if they upzoned the property while the 
government was seeking to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
But in March, 1989, the supervisors approved development of 150 homes by a 3-1 
vote, with only Supervisor Ed Edelman voting no. 
</P>
<P>
The decision increased the value of the land by millions of dollars. The 
National Park Service and conservancy had pooled their funds and were prepared 
to pay $14 million -- the amount they anticipated the land would be worth if a 
tract of 103 homes were approved. With approval of 150 homes, the appraised 
value of the land rose to $19 million, although the developers also rejected an 
offer for that amount. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Heller, a principal in the project, had said the development would be 
uneconomical if he were allowed to build only 103 homes. The supervisors said 
they also were persuaded by the developers that the 103-unit limit was wrong in 
the first place because it had assumed steeper slopes than were actually on the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Several individuals and firms involved in the project were longtime supporters 
of the supervisors, and particularly of Antonovich, the area's representative. 
From 1985-89, they contributed $36,995 to the supervisors -- of which $29,495, 
or more than three-fourths, went to Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
The $36,995 included $20,600 from the Engineering Technology, Inc. of Sherman 
Oaks, consultants who represented the developers before the Board of 
Supervisors. An additional $15,395 came from Art Whizin, Heller Construction 
and Raiten Development, all principals in the project. 
</P>
<P>
Vannatta said these contributions had "zippo influence" on Antonovich. He 
pointed out that before the case reached the supervisors, the Regional Planning 
Commission had decided to let the developers build 159 houses. The supervisors 
actually reduced that to 150 at Antonovich's insistence, Vannatta said. 
</P>
<P>
In another recent case, the supervisors in December approved a development in 
Corral Canyon in Malibu that was to include a golf course, country club and 
housing development. The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy had tried to buy 
the land for about $8 million, but the developers, Sun Pacific Properties, 
spurned the offer as ridiculously low. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by the supervisors brought a firestorm of criticism, with 
opponents saying the scenic canyon, with its year-round stream, should not be 
merely a playground for the rich. 
</P>
<P>
And three lawsuits were filed in an attempt to void the decision, because it 
allowed massive grading of streamside habitat area designated for special 
protection in the Malibu coastal plan. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was rendered moot last week, when the owner of the land, 
entertainer Bob Hope, suddenly scrapped plans for the golf course and country 
club and agreed to donate 200 acres, including the habitat area, to the Santa 
Monicas park. 
</P>
<P>
Had the deal with Hope not been struck, however, a controversial land-use 
decision would have benefited political contributors. 
</P>
<P>
According to campaign records, individuals and firms involved in the Sun 
Pacific project contributed $40,845 to the supervisors over five years -- more 
than three-fourths of that to Dana and Antonovich. About half the money was 
contributed in 1989, when the project was approved. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1989, alone, Dana received 22 separate contributions totaling $9,900 
from those associated with the development. 
</P>
<P>
He got $500 each from Sidney McClue, A. Bruce Robbs and C.B. Robbs, and $1,000 
from A. Bruce Robbs, Jr. -- officials with Sun Pacific. He also got $500 from 
the project's environmental consultants, Planning Consultants Research; $1,000 
from the project architects, Corbin, Yamafuji, &amp; Partners; $1,000 from 
project engineers, Psomas and Associates; and $1,000 from the geotechnical 
engineers, Schaefer Dixon Associates. Six of these contributions came on the 
same day, March 20. 
</P>
<P>
Then on March 22, Dana received 14 separate contributions of $100 to $1,000 
apiece from attorneys with Latham &amp; Watkins, a big law firm that works for 
Sun Pacific and many other developers. 
</P>
<P>
Dana said the contributions played no role in the decision. 
</P>
<P>
He called the golf course an "excellent use of the land." In an interview 
before the announcement of the gift from Hope, Dana described the project as 
"very beautiful" and "ecologically sound." 
</P>
<P>
Another battle arose over the Currey-Riach project, which involves 1,000 
condominiums and a commercial complex on land bought by developers from Bob 
Hope. 
</P>
<P>
Two hundred eighteen acres of the site near Malibu Creek State Park were to be 
deeded to a parks agency to be preserved as open space under an approval 
granted by the Regional Planning Commission several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But the Currey-Riach developers appealed to the Board of Supervisors and 
persuaded it to let the 218 acres remain as privately owned open space. At a 
hearing in 1983, Antonovich, who represents the area, stunned environmentalists 
with his defense of that decision. He said he was concerned that a parks agency 
might sell rather than preserve the land. 
</P>
<P>
Then, last August, the developers told the county that they wanted to adjust 
their building plans in a way that would encroach on the open space. The 
supervisors went along, but told the developers they did not want the amount of 
open space significantly reduced. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists once again pleaded to have the open space given to the 
conservancy or the National Park Service. The supervisors once again refused, 
with Antonovich warning that the open space was not secure if in the hands of 
public parks agencies. 
</P>
<P>
From 1985-89, Currey-Riach Co., its officials and affiliated firms donated 
$45,805 to campaigns of the supervisors, according to a review of campaign 
reports. More than half that amount -- $24,305 -- went to Antonovich. Dana got 
$11,000 and Pete Schabarum $9,500. 
</P>
<P>
Vannatta, the Antonovich aide, said the contributions weren't a factor in the 
Currey-Riach case. Open space will not be lost, he said. It was just that the 
developer "was particularly unwilling to turn it over" to the public. 
</P>
<P>
To the north of Currey-Riach, the Park Service in 1985 paid $8 million to 
acquire lower Cheeseboro Canyon in Agoura, whose lovely hills and oak savannas 
have become a favorite of hikers, equestrians and bird-watchers. 
</P>
<P>
But it turned out that Los Angeles County had an easement across the land, 
which would allow it to bulldoze an extension of Thousand Oaks Boulevard 
through the heart of the canyon. Conservationists and parks officials since 
have asked the county to abandon the easement, but to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
Vannatta explained: "We have not said for sure that we are going to stick with 
that alignment" for the road. But "our public works department feels that it is 
clearly the best route for a new highway."

CHATSWORTH GROUP AIMS TO BLOCK NEW COURTHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN YAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At age 75, Harry Godley easily gets breathless when he walks, but he went 
door-to-door in his Chatsworth neighborhood Saturday gathering signatures of 
people who, like him, want to block construction of a proposed county 
courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
Godley and about 20 other opponents wanted people living in the area to sign 
1,000 copies of a letter to be sent to county Supervisor Mike Antonovich, 
asking him to vote against building the courthouse at the corner of Plummer 
Street and Winnetka Avenue. The group will be gathering signatures through 
Monday in a 1-mile-square area near the site. 
</P>
<P>
The county plans to build a municipal courthouse to serve the West Valley and 
has been looking at about four sites, including a 9-acre lot at Plummer Street 
and Winnetka Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Chatsworth location has raised the ire of some residents. They say 
they don't object to the courthouse but believe it should not be built close to 
a residential area. They fear a courthouse will increase noise and traffic in 
their quiet neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Residents living on Oakdale Avenue near the proposed site said they are 
disappointed that Antonovich has not announced his stand on the issue but hope 
the deluge of letters will swing the supervisor to their side. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he ought to come out and make some sort of statement," said Godley, 
chairman of the Chatsworth Homeowners Committee, which represents an area that 
includes 2,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Dorsey, justice deputy for Antonovich, said the supervisor cannot announce 
his position until Los Angeles Municipal Court officials select a site. Even if 
Antonovich opposed the site, Dorsey said, opponents of it would have to win 
over a majority of the five supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The deputy said the county views the Chatsworth lot as an "excellent site" and 
said residents have pictured the worst. 
</P>
<P>
"They have this mythology in their heads that it's going to bring the hardened 
criminals to the area," he said. Dorsey said the courthouse would be a 
convenience to West Valley residents. "It's for your benefit," he said. 
"Instead of going miles away to pay a traffic ticket" at courthouses in Van 
Nuys or San Fernando, tickets could be paid nearby. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed municipal courthouse would have 18 courtrooms where traffic and 
small claims cases would be heard, and preliminary hearings and arraignments 
would be held for felonies ranging from drug possession to murder. 
</P>
<P>
The volunteers gathering signatures were also asking people to sign a petition 
that would only be submitted to Antonovich if the Plummer Avenue site is 
formally selected and Antonovich comes out in favor of it. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the homeowners Godley approached Saturday signed a letter. 
</P>
<P>
Residents said they fear court visitors will park on their streets rather than 
paying to park near the courthouse. They also anticipate a decline in the value 
of their homes and dread the possibility of those accused of crimes escaping 
the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, they fear the courthouse will be expanded beyond 18 courtrooms, 
although county officials have assured them no expansion is planned. 
</P>
<P>
One resident who has had to pay parking tickets at other courthouses said he 
would be glad to have a courthouse built closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
"If you get a ticket out here, it's a big hassle going to San Fernando," said 
Matt McLincha, who said he has waited as long as seven hours for a case to be 
heard.

MICHAEL BRYANT'S DOUBLE LIFE; 
</P>
<P>
SUSPECT: NEIGHBORS WHO KNEW THE AMIABLE MAN ARE SHAKEN BY THE MURDER CHARGE 
AGAINST HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
To those who knew him in Woodland Hills, Michael Bryant was a soft-spoken and 
generous man who kept mostly to himself. 
</P>
<P>
Though reclusive, he was far from unfriendly. He was quick to volunteer his 
help to neighbors. He sent Christmas cards and friendly notes to his landlady. 
He liked to show off the tricks he had taught his pet Doberman. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant, 44, told people he was a free-lance photographer. But often he spent 
his time gardening in his fenced back yard and was proud of the cherry tomatoes 
he gave to friends. "They were better than you could buy in a supermarket," his 
landlady said. 
</P>
<P>
But authorities say Michael Bryant and the life he led in Los Angeles was a 
facade; that, in fact, Bryant was Francis W. Malinosky, a Vermont school 
administrator who dropped from sight in 1979 after he became the prime suspect 
in the disappearance of a teacher with whom he had been romantically involved. 
</P>
<P>
Malinosky's double life came to an end earlier this month when he was traced by 
local and Vermont authorities to Woodland Hills. He was arrested and charged 
with the murder of the missing teacher. And while Malinosky waits in Los 
Angeles County jail for an extradition hearing, mystery still surrounds him. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators say that when they searched Malinosky's belongings they found 
cameras and a business card suggesting he, indeed, was a photographer. But the 
only photos found were of him smiling amid fields of marijuana plants. No 
tomatoes were found at his house, but police said several pounds of packaged 
marijuana seeds were found in the garage. And in the unpretentious, 23-year-old 
Volkswagen he drove, investigators found a coffee can crammed with $217,000 in 
$100 bills. 
</P>
<P>
"Finding this guy just opened up more questions," said Sgt. Leo Blais, a 
Vermont State Police detective who has tracked the Malinosky case for years. "I 
am trying to get an idea of what he has been doing for 10 years and it is hard. 
We don't know much about him." 
</P>
<P>
Those who thought they knew Michael Bryant of Woodland Hills have also had to 
face the same enigma. A man they viewed as a good neighbor or tenant is charged 
with murder and is suspected of hiding behind at least four aliases and earning 
his living at least in part by selling marijuana seeds along with instructions 
on their planting and cultivation. 
</P>
<P>
"This really comes out of left field," said Lilian Darling Holt, Bryant's 
landlord for nearly five years. "It is devastating. Michael was a marvelous 
tenant and person. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole thing doesn't seem right," she said. "It seems that over the years 
there would have been something that would now click and I'd be able to say, 
'Son of a gun, I now see how this could be.' But there is nothing like that. I 
just feel very bad. I wish I could do something for him." 
</P>
<P>
Holt is not alone in being both perplexed and supportive of Bryant. Neighbors 
he was friendly with in the 4900 block of Topanga Canyon Boulevard have 
volunteered to care for his dog while he is in jail. And an attorney who met 
Bryant a few years ago in a coffee shop is now helping him fight extradition to 
Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
"There is complete shock among those who knew him," said the attorney, Gregg 
Michael Abrams. "He was the kind of guy most people would want as a neighbor." 
</P>
<P>
Abrams said Malinosky disappeared from Vermont and began using false names 
because he was being hounded by authorities for a crime he did not commit. 
</P>
<P>
"There is more to this case than meets the eye," Abrams said. "You don't need 
to be a genius to see why he would leave Vermont. He believed a witch hunt was 
under way, and he decided to leave." 
</P>
<P>
But authorities insist they have made no mistake. Malinosky is the only suspect 
in the Nov. 5, 1979, disappearance and apparent murder of Judith Leo-Coneys. 
The 32-year-old mother of a small boy disappeared after telling friends she was 
going to a house owned by Malinosky. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone out here I talk to about him can't believe it," said Blais while he 
was in Los Angeles last week investigating Malinosky's life here. "They keep 
telling me he isn't the type." 
</P>
<P>
So far Blais has established that Malinosky lived in the Los Angeles area in 
the early 1980s and worked as a house painter. He later moved to Utah and then 
back to Los Angeles, where beginning in late 1985 he lived alone in the 
two-bedroom Topanga Canyon Boulevard house. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, Malinosky somehow picked up one alias -- Barry Vandiver Bryant 
-- that actually was the name of a real person, Blais said. The real Barry 
Bryant, of Charlotte, N.C., has since changed his name because of credit 
problems that began when Malinosky took his identity. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, Malinosky was, on the surface, an unlikely murder suspect. He had 
taught for several years in Burlington area schools and was known to many in 
the northern Vermont community. At 34, he was assistant director of special 
education for the Burlington School Department. 
</P>
<P>
Bearded and slightly balding, he was a man who enjoyed the outdoors. He had an 
apartment in Burlington and owned a house in the rural town of Shelburne, which 
was more convenient for hunting and skiing. A mellow-voiced widower, his wife 
having shot herself to death in 1976, Malinosky was raising a daughter and son. 
</P>
<P>
But in mid-1979 Malinosky's life apparently went into a tailspin when 
Leo-Coneys broke off a two-year relationship with him. According to Chittenden 
County court records, he was deeply hurt by the breakup, had sought psychiatric 
counseling and had been seen at least once spying through the windows of 
Leo-Coneys' apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks before her disappearance, Leo-Coneys was held at gunpoint by 
Malinosky for several hours while he unsuccessfully attempted to persuade her 
to resume their relationship, records say. 
</P>
<P>
On the morning of Nov. 5, 1979, Leo-Coneys told friends and relatives she was 
going to drop by Malinosky's home in Shelburne to retrieve something of hers. 
She chose that morning to go because she knew he was scheduled to be at work in 
Burlington. 
</P>
<P>
But Leo-Coneys was never seen again. She was reported missing by her family 
later that day and investigators learned that Malinosky had not gone to work or 
even called his office to explain why. That night, when he was spotted driving 
his van in Shelburne and questioned by police, he said he took the day off to 
go bird hunting and did not see Leo-Coneys. 
</P>
<P>
Leo-Coney's car was found at a junkyard in the town of Roxbury the next day. A 
handwritten note on the windshield said the car could be stripped for parts and 
was signed "R. Peterson." 
</P>
<P>
Malinosky was questioned repeatedly after the disappearance but on Dec. 2, 
1979, he put his children on a bus to his former in-laws' home, emptied his 
bank accounts and disappeared. Though Leo-Coneys' body has never been found, 
authorities claim they have amassed convincing evidence pointing to Malinosky. 
</P>
<P>
According to court records, FBI experts matched Malinosky's handwriting to the 
note found on Leo-Coneys' car at the Roxbury junkyard. Investigators also found 
a cab driver who reported picking Malinosky up in Roxbury on the day of the 
woman's disappearance. A cab dispatcher who took the call remembered talking to 
Malinosky. She had once been one of his students. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives had also noticed while interviewing Malinosky the first time that 
his parka was torn and leaking its down filling. The same type of down was 
found in Leo-Coneys' car, court records say. 
</P>
<P>
Police believed after Malinosky's disappearance that he might have killed 
himself, and the case languished without any charges being filed. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the Leo-Coneys case was assigned to Blais to be updated and, using a 
computer search, the detective learned Malinosky was alive and had apparently 
lived in Salt Lake City in the mid-1980s, where he used his own name to get a 
driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
Blais went to Utah but Malinosky was gone. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, the case languished, until last year when a new state attorney, 
William Sorrell, was appointed and made the Leo-Coneys investigation a 
priority. The case was presented Feb. 20, 1990, to a grand jury, which 
concluded that Leo-Coneys was dead, and a warrant was issued two days later 
charging Malinosky with her slaying. 
</P>
<P>
According to court records, Malinosky's daughter told investigators she had met 
her father earlier this year at the St. Moritz Hotel in New York City. Blais 
learned that the hotel room Malinosky used was paid for by a credit card issued 
to a Barry Vandiver Bryant. From that point, credit card billings under that 
name were traced to four private mail boxes in the San Fernando Valley and 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Los Angeles Police Department fugitive squad questioned the 
private mail box proprietors who identified Barry Bryant as Malinosky. And on 
April 12, the detectives were alerted by one of the mail-drop operators that 
Bryant had just picked up his mail. 
</P>
<P>
Police and FBI agents immediately went to the area on Ventura Boulevard in 
Woodland Hills, but Bryant was already gone. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators decided to check area motels, and a clerk at a Best Western 
in the 21800 block of Ventura Boulevard identified a photo of Malinosky as a 
guest who had been renting a room since Feb. 20 -- the day the grand jury 
hearing began in Vermont. Investigators now believe he moved to the motel after 
learning, possibly through friends or family in Vermont, that the grand jury 
was investigating the case. 
</P>
<P>
Police watched the motel room and Malinosky was arrested that afternoon when he 
drove up in his 1967 Volkswagen. He had papers identifying himself as Michael 
Bryant that showed his address as a house about five blocks away on Topanga 
Canyon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
In the car, police found the coffee can containing $217,000, along with a 
material normally used to keep moisture out of packages. Detectives said the 
powder indicates the can of money may have been buried previously. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators were puzzled by where Malinosky had gotten the cash. But the next 
day, his house was searched and dozens of packets of several different 
varieties of marijuana seeds were found in the garage. Police theorized that 
Malinosky may have accumulated the cache of money by selling drugs or the 
seeds. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Detective Ronald Tuckett said marijuana cultivation 
instructions and other drug paraphernalia were found in the garage. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like he may have been in the mail order business," Tuckett said. 
</P>
<P>
Though the drug investigation is continuing, it is unlikely local charges will 
be filed against Malinosky because they could hinder his extradition to Vermont 
to face the murder charge, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Alerted on the morning of April 12, the day Malinosky picked up his mail, Blais 
was already flying from Vermont to Los Angeles when the man he had pursued 
since 1986 was taken into custody. The detective and suspect met for the first 
time in a holding cell. 
</P>
<P>
"All he did was stare at the ground," Blais said. "He was very upset. I 
introduced myself and he said, 'I know who you are.' I said, 'I know who you 
are, too, but do you want me to call you Frank or Michael or Barry or what?' He 
said to call him Frank. It was a strange feeling to finally meet him face to 
face."

DELAY SOUGHT IN SENIOR HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lawndale city officials sent a letter Friday urging the developer of a 
subsidized apartment complex for seniors to stop qualifying potential tenants 
until legal questions are resolved about a lottery used to select applicants. 
</P>
<P>
They had previously asked the Detroit-based developer, Cooperative Services 
Inc., to reschedule the March 13 lottery after discovering that only a small 
number of Lawndale seniors would participate in it. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 306 seniors who applied for one of the 56 subsidized apartment units, 
only 52 were from Lawndale. Of the 100 given priority ranking, only 17 were 
Lawndale residents. The complex is the city's only subsidized apartment complex 
for low-income seniors. 
</P>
<P>
But Cooperative Services refused to reschedule the lottery, saying a new 
drawing would be unfair to those who were picked and would delay occupancy of 
the complex. 
</P>
<P>
In an April 16 letter to the federal Housing and Urban Development department 
-- which provided grants to fund the project -- city officials alleged that the 
ethnic composition of those seniors given priority ranking did not reflect that 
of the community. Although 1980 census figures indicate that Latinos make up 
28.4% of the community, only 15% of the tenant applicants were Latino, the 
letter stated. 
</P>
<P>
If HUD declines to compel the developer to hold the lottery again, city 
officials may seek a restraining order against Cooperative Services to prevent 
the selection process from continuing, City Atty. David J. Aleshire said.

Shirley and Boyd Brewster have a big family: 10 children and 10 grandchildren 
-- and 250 tenants in the senior citizen apartment complex that the Brewsters 
manage in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewsters are on call 24 hours a day at Inglewood Meadows Apartments, 
listening to tenants' concerns, lobbying for increased services and, throughout 
it all, treating residents like family. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's personal touch has won them an award as the national apartment 
managers of the year by the Assn. of Housing and Urban Development Management 
Agents. They will be honored at a luncheon Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In nominating the couple, the Brewsters' boss, Philip Sutherland, wrote, "One 
of the greatest needs of seniors is to be loved and cared about, and that Boyd 
and Shirley Brewster supply in abundance." 
</P>
<P>
The average age of their tenants is over 80. The oldest resident is 97. Most of 
those in the 199-unit government-subsidized complex are on Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
"These people have nobody in the world," Shirley Brewster said. 
</P>
<P>
That's where she and her husband come in. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd Brewster cooked 95 pounds of chicken and ribs for a Fourth of July 
barbecue that drew nearly 100 residents, including a few who had not ventured 
out of their apartments in years. 
</P>
<P>
When Christmastime came, instead of heading off to their real family in the Bay 
Area, the Brewsters decided to trim a tree in the apartment recreation room for 
those who had no place else to go. 
</P>
<P>
When the guest list grew to 80, and their vacation money ran out, the Brewsters 
solicited food and gifts from local merchants and community groups. At the 
party, they cooked four turkeys and three hams. 
</P>
<P>
But tenant Amal Alexander, 80, points out that sacrificing their personal 
vacations is not all the Brewsters contribute. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have a problem they will see that that problem is taken care of," said 
Alexander, president of the complex's senior citizen association. "It's never 
too late to call them." 
</P>
<P>
Shirley Brewster, known to her tenants as Dutch, is frequently on the phone 
herself, lobbying whoever it takes to get services for her residents. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewsters, who moved into Inglewood Meadows last April after numerous other 
apartment manager jobs in Northern California, said the award is an honor -- 
but not why they do what they do. 
</P>
<P>
A bigger thrill for Boyd Brewster came after the Fourth of July barbecue when 
the cooking was done. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of the residents gathered together and surprised Boyd Brewster with a 
round of "For He's a Jolly Good Fellow." Marc Lacey

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: IT'S THE END OF THE LINE FOR 'DINOSAUR' PHONE SYSTEM AT 
EL SEGUNDO CITY HALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
You're as likely to get a busy signal as a ring. 
</P>
<P>
If your call is transferred, don't be surprised if it's disconnected instead. 
</P>
<P>
A few extensions don't even ring anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the El Segundo City Hall telephone system. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like an old out-on-the farm party line system," says receptionist 
Evelyn Benedix, whose voice is the first to greet callers to city offices. 
</P>
<P>
Direct dialing, a common telephone feature these days, is unknown in City Hall, 
and the 15-year-old system doesn't have enough lines to handle the volume of 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
The few telephone repair technicians who know how to fix the system call it 
their "dinosaur," and since many spare parts are no longer manufactured, 
technicians must fabricate their own or figure out how to make newer parts 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Benedix is no longer able to dial 20 extensions containing the number 9 from 
the switchboard, although outgoing calls may be made from those lines. "The 
part that dials 9 is broken and there's no replacement," she said. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the three lines into the Police Department service desk rejected 
calls all day. The phones rang but the calls didn't connect, and Benedix had to 
route them to the watch commander. 
</P>
<P>
Benedix would like to take a good ax to the whole system. Instead, the City 
Council recently voted unanimously to spend $265,000 for a new system after 
Benedix gave a talk about the old one. 
</P>
<P>
According to A T &amp; T, which will have the new system operating by the end 
of June, it will have direct dialing, a voice-mail message system and a digital 
switching system that will reduce disconnections. The number of lines will be 
doubled, and the police emergency operating center -- used in the event of 
disasters -- will be able to receive up to 40 calls at a time. 
</P>
<P>
The city, however, is stopping short of the automated call direction system 
that many cities and companies use. "We want to provide a customer-oriented 
system with a warm body to answer calls," City Manager Ron Cano said. 
</P>
<P>
That warm body will continue to be Benedix, who, besides running the 
switchboard and answering general information questions about the city, also 
types purchase orders, runs outgoing mail through the postage meter and sells 
dog licenses. 
</P>
<P>
She expects that the new system will cut the calls she handles by 50% and 
predicts: "That will help me get the rest of my work done." Gerald Faris

HOSTAGE DAUGHTER'S HOPES RISE IN THOUSAND OAKS FOR ALANN STEEN'S RELEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Somewhere in the Middle East today, American hostage Alann Steen turns 51. 
</P>
<P>
His daughter has tried to learn not to hope for too much in the 39 months since 
he was abducted by Islamic extremists, not to hope that they really will 
release him this time. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time something comes up, I just get my hopes up," said Jackie Steen 
Scardino, 29, of Thousand Oaks. "I just get really, really high on hope that 
something will come of it and then it just comes crashing down." 
</P>
<P>
Steen's captors have made promises before, only to follow with silence. 
</P>
<P>
This time, despite herself, Jackie Scardino felt the hope rise again. 
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine announced Wednesday that one 
of three hostages, including Steen, would be released within 48 hours. The 
faction also demanded that Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly go to 
Damascus to discuss details. 
</P>
<P>
But the United States refused to send Kelly and the 48 hours elapsed. As the 
weekend began, Steen's release remained a possibility. But Jackie Scardino said 
she felt cheated and called the captors' request that Kelly travel to Damascus 
harmless. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel really frustrated with Bush. I don't think he's doing all he could be," 
she said. "Maybe you can imagine what it's like to be a captive for the first 
week, but imagine what it's like for three years. That's the message we'd like 
to send to President Bush, is to imagine what it's like." 
</P>
<P>
Of the government's refusal to negotiate with terrorists, Scardino's husband, 
Chris Scardino, said cynically, "We never sell arms to them, either." Sending 
Kelly wouldn't be "giving into a demand, when so much was at stake," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Steen's family has heard reports that he has been kept in a small room with 
three other hostages, with "no books and nothing to do mentally. I suppose he'd 
be going stir-crazy," Jackie Scardino said. 
</P>
<P>
She remembers the day her father was reported kidnaped: "I was very optimistic 
he'd be in there for a couple weeks and that our government would get him out 
because he was an American. And they haven't done anything," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"People should think about it every day, and not just when we get news from the 
Middle East," Chris Scardino said. "People should be more aware of it." 
</P>
<P>
As negotiations over Steen's release stalled Friday, Jackie Scardino watched 
her 14-month-old son scamper after a fuzzy orange ball in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan Alann Scardino bears the name of the grandfather he has never met. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Scardino last saw her father's face in a grainy video released by his 
captors two years ago. On Friday, she leafed through a book of snapshots with 
some friends. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't know I'm married, he doesn't know my sister's married, he doesn't 
know he has a grandson," Jackie Scardino said. "It's very hard. I think about 
him every day, but I can't let it get to me. There are times when it does. It's 
just a feeling of helplessness."

INTEREST IN REDEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article on the North Hollywood Redevelopment District (April 8) was very 
informative. The article pointed out the lack of interest by the community, so 
I called the Community Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
I was informed that I would be able to attend the monthly advisory meetings but 
that under CRA rules, I am ineligible to become a member of the board because 
my home lies five blocks outside the boundaries of the redevelopment district. 
</P>
<P>
The official I spoke with also suggested I was misinterpreting the article as 
to the lack of community support. She said at least 25 people attend each 
meeting.

Judging from this conversation, this is certainly an example of the 
inflexibility of the CRA and its advisory committee in meeting the needs of the 
community it is supposed to be serving. I plan to attend the next meeting in 
May and hope that one day I will have a voice in the direction my neighborhood 
is taking. But I believe that the CRA should encourage participation by all 
residents, not those that fit in their rules.

AVALON AND PENINSULA SCHOOLS GET TOP HONORS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: PALOS VERDES DISTRICT WINS MORE STATE AWARDS THAN ANY OTHER 
DISTRICT, AND CATALINA SCHOOL IS REWARDED FOR ACADEMIC IMPROVEMENT.

Distinguished school flags will be flying on both sides of the Catalina Channel 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Palos Verdes Peninsula district won more of the state education awards this 
year than any other school district in the state, and Avalon Junior and Senior 
High School on Santa Catalina Island became one of the smaller schools in 
California to take home a medal. 
</P>
<P>
The schools were among 141 in the state, including 18 in Los Angeles County, 
honored by the state Department of Education for outstanding student academic 
performance or significant educational improvement. 
</P>
<P>
The award-winning schools in the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District 
were Rolling Hills, Palos Verdes and Miraleste high schools and Ridgecrest 
Intermediate School. In addition, Malaga Cove Intermediate School was one of 33 
schools statewide named "sustained achievement schools" for winning the award 
in 1988, the last time intermediate and high schools were honored, and keeping 
test scores high. 
</P>
<P>
On Catalina Island, Avalon Junior and Senior High School, with a combined 
enrollment of about 460 and a graduating class of 26, won for its academic 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
State evaluators found that the number of students taking advanced courses, 
such as mathematics and chemistry, has increased significantly the last four 
years, that the requirements for graduation have been toughened, and that 
student scores on California Assessment Program tests have improved. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very impressive," said Carol Kennedy, a member of the state evaluation 
team that visited Avalon. "There was lots of personal attention given to the 
students." 
</P>
<P>
The average CAP reading score for seniors at Avalon, part of the Long Beach 
Unified School District, increased to 260 in the last school year from 222 in 
the 1987-88 school year. The average math score rose to 235 from 195 in the 
same period. About 90% of the school's 26 seniors plan to attend college next 
year. Nine of them plan to enroll in four-year colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 40% of Avalon's students are Latino, and most are from low-income 
families. Nearly 15% speak only limited English. Many of the students are from 
families that work in the island's hotels and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Avalon Principal Jon Meyer said the district has loyal students and a 
supportive community. "Our parents are involved," he added. "To pull a group of 
parent supporters together, all I need to do is make a phone call." 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills, Palos Verdes and Miraleste high schools were repeat winners, 
having been named distinguished schools in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes was the only district in the state this year to have all high 
schools win the award. School officials praised cooperation between the 
district and the parents. 
</P>
<P>
Interim Supt. Wayne Butterbaugh said he's surprised by the long list of 
donations and gifts from community members at board meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"I give the parents a lot of credit," he said. "This is the result of the 
schools setting goals for themselves and then sacrificing to meet those goals 
-- just like a championship athlete." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, the state education official, praised the strong "home-support system" 
she found at the peninsula's schools. 
</P>
<P>
"They have pressure on them to go to good colleges," she said. "They don't have 
the pressures of gangs, drugs, poverty and no place to study at home that some 
districts face." 
</P>
<P>
State schools Supt. Bill Honig will honor the schools at a ceremony May 24 at 
the Anaheim Hilton and Towers Hotel. Some of the state's distinguished schools 
will be recommended for the National School Recognition Program.

WE CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO INVEST IN ENVIRONMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember when traffic congestion was what people moved to Orange County to get 
away from? Remember when oil spills were something that happened to other 
people's beaches? Or when no one thought about what happened to trash once it 
left the curb? 
</P>
<P>
It's amazing what one of the state's biggest growth rates -- not to mention a 
major oil spill off Huntington Beach in February -- has done for the 
environmental movement in Orange County. Today, even as the 20th anniversary of 
Earth Day is celebrated, residents indicate that they have a deepening 
awareness that the ecological system on which they depend is fragile. They also 
are conscious of their role in generating the mounds of trash and tons of air 
pollutants and indicate a willingness to change their behavior to reflect that 
concern. According to a recent survey conducted for The Times, for example, 82% 
of Orange County residents favor mandatory trash recycling of glass bottles, 
newsprint and aluminum cans. In this, residents appear to be ahead of their 
elected leadership: So far only six of the county's 29 cities offer recycling. 
Irvine, which was the first, expected 40% participation but instead got 70%, an 
indication that people are looking for ways to take action. In addition, more 
than two-thirds of those surveyed said they buy items advertised to be safer 
for the environment, even though they cost more. 
</P>
<P>
The survey conducted by Mark Baldassare and Associates also indicated that 72% 
of the county's residents favor using tax dollars to build mass transit 
systems, and nearly half said they would "very likely" use public transit to 
get to work if the stops were convenient. 
</P>
<P>
Voting for increased taxes for transportation and transit is another matter, 
however. Orange County residents have twice voted against a half-cent sales tax 
increase -- a boost approved in every other urban county in the state -- for 
projects aimed at easing traffic congestion. They will get another chance in 
November. Meanwhile, a statewide measure, Proposition 111, which is on the June 
5 primary ballot, deserves support. It would increase gas taxes by 9 cents over 
the next five years to pay for freeway widening and many other vitally needed 
highway and transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, 77% of Orange County residents -- Republicans and Democrats alike -- 
said they are more interested in the environment now than they were several 
years ago, reflecting a national trend that was sparked to some degree by the 
Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska's pristine Prince William Sound. But there 
must also be a willingness to invest in the environment and to change 
lifestyles to preserve and recycle resources. One of comedian Lily Tomlin's 
characters in the play, "The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the 
Universe," says: "It's hard to be politically conscious and upwardly mobile at 
the same time." But this may be just what is needed to preserve the good life 
that Orange County residents have worked so hard to achieve and make Earth Day 
20 years hence something worth celebrating.

MARINE AIR STATION VS. COUNTY DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I will provide the short plank if Mayor Larry Agran of Irvine provides the long 
walk, along with everybody else who complains about the noise at the Tustin and 
El Toro air stations (April 7). 
</P>
<P>
Agran can try blaming the county, which has cheated on Community Noise 
Equivalent Level (CNEL) 65 areas. 
</P>
<P>
But he has only himself to blame for moving into an area with two military 
bases that have been there since World War II. Everyone wants to be free, but 
few are willing to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
The noise was here before most of us were here, before most of us were born! As 
a resident of central and south Orange County for 41 years and as a former 
Marine stationed at El Toro, I know what it takes, as others do, to maintain 
freedom. The military has to train and if you move into their training area, 
you adapt to them. 
</P>
<P>
So, to Agran and the rest of the yahoos who complain about noise, I wouldn't 
call someone who buys a house under a flight pattern an innocent bystander. 
</P>
<P>
I would suggest they relocate to Blythe or Quartsite, where there aren't so 
many military aircraft.

MARINE AIR STATION VS. COUNTY DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After serving 22 years in the armed forces, I just couldn't resist writing 
concerning those city fathers and a small group of citizens who want the 
Marines to move the Tustin helicopter facility. 
</P>
<P>
Is it really a noise problem or is it greed -- that some investors would like 
to grab the land? 
</P>
<P>
A good real estate agent will take a prospective buyer all over an area and 
point out what business or armed force installation in an area might be a noise 
factor. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 years ago, when we returned from overseas, we purchased a home in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
On the first trip through the area, the real estate salesman pointed out the 
flight paths used by Douglas Aircraft Co. and the Air Force base in Long Beach. 
We had the opportunity to purchase the house in the air paths or find another 
house. We purchased the house. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 25 years, we have lived in Cypress, below the LAX, John Wayne and 
Los Alamitos base flight paths, and it has never bothered us. 
</P>
<P>
If you are busy with your life and have varied interests, you don't have time 
to worry about aircraft flying overhead. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the 1960s, the Air Force moved out of Long Beach because local groups 
complained about jet noise. The local population "jumped up and down" because 
the loss to the area was more than $1 million a month, and the joke was that 
the Air Force was not flying jets. They were Douglas Aircraft Co. jets. Just 
imagine what Tustin will lose if the Marines move out of the base. 
</P>
<P>
Let us be realistic and think about higher taxes as a result of revenue that 
will be lost. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't it being patriotic to help our government save money and not burden our 
Marines, who are doing their job day in and day out for the protection of our 
country?

DEMOCRATS CAN WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As one of several Democratic candidates for public office in Orange County, I 
wish to protest a statement made by your paper on Page 1 of the first section 
of your March 10 edition. Printed in a box at the bottom of the page, it cited 
a news story on Page 24 of the same section saying that: "The good news for 
Democrats is that they are entered in all 14 county races. 
</P>
<P>
The good news for Republicans is that both sides expect the GOP to win all 14." 
</P>
<P>
The wording of this statement, particularly the second sentence thereof, is 
both untrue and, because of its front page placement, especially embarrassing 
and damaging to all of our party's candidates. Who is going to walk the 
precincts, make the phone calls or contribute money to a Democratic candidate 
who at the very outset of his campaign has, reportedly, agreed that he expects 
his Republican opponent to win? 
</P>
<P>
To the best of my knowledge, neither I nor any other Democrat in question was 
interviewed at the time as to his expectations of victory and nothing in the 
referenced story substantiates in any way your assertion that we all expect to 
lose. I, for one, certainly did not undertake the expense and effort of running 
for Congress with the thought that it will all be in vain. That would be utter 
nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
In short, we Orange County Democrats have enough on our hands already without 
being branded by The Times as a bunch of self-confessed losers. Give us a 
break!

F RULE FOR CHEERLEADERS -- UNFAIR AND DISCRIMINATORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to letters (April 15) regarding our opposition to the school's 
policies regarding cheerleaders, our request was not just to make our daughter 
Melissa the exception but to change the rules for all girls who wish to be 
cheerleaders. If everyone objects so stringently to exceptions, why is it OK to 
make the cheerleaders an exception and have different rules for them? 
</P>
<P>
As to comments about our role as parents, let me assure you we did interface 
with Melissa, she did interface with her teacher and counselors and our role as 
parents is also to support our child when the system has failed her. 
</P>
<P>
I fail to see why a single "F" in a class equates with irresponsibility and 
total academic failure. I am not concerned about my daughter who even with the 
"F" in chemistry has a 2.9 GPA for three years of high school, who has been 
responsible and mature enough to be co-captain of her squad both years, who is 
acknowledged by the teachers and administrators to be a respectful, outstanding 
student with a positive and supportive attitude. 
</P>
<P>
I am much more concerned about my child as a whole person, her well being, her 
happiness; the pursuit of her own goals and agenda, the fulfillment of her 
spirit and yes, her education. The idea that grades are indicative of an 
education is pure fallacy, the position that one "F" signifies some 
overwhelming failure is a myopic perspective, and by the way, the real issue is 
"discrimination." Why doesn't all the rationale that apply to cheerleaders also 
apply to all other activities? 
</P>
<P>
As for the lesson, this is teaching Melissa, she has learned that 
administrators, teachers and the school board will go to any lengths to protect 
their policy; when one stands up to challenge rules that are discriminatory, 
she will be criticized and many friends won't stand with her. As Einstein so 
aptly phrased it: "Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition 
from mediocre minds."

TRIBUTE TO UCI'S DANIEL ALDRICH -- AN EDUCATOR AND RENAISSANCE MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The media tribute to the late Daniel Aldrich, founder and chancellor of UC 
Irvine until his retirement, is apt, appreciated and inspiring. It is a tribute 
to the media writers and editors that this great person, neither politician nor 
TV celebrity but an educator and something of a Renaissance man, should be so 
honored. 
</P>
<P>
In remembrance of Chancellor Dan, we grieve. Too briefly did this hero touch 
our lives. Yet the light he lighted will forever glow. 
</P>
<P>
The growing impact of his creative mind moved minds of all who knew this gentle 
genius. Paired with his intellect was his caring heart. Mind governed by 
compassion was his way. 
</P>
<P>
He dared to dream great dreams, then worked to make those dreams come true, 
using his time always to create better times. 
</P>
<P>
Dan knew, as a man of soil, that from dark of night comes morning light, and 
from the seed of death new life is born.

ORANGEWOOD SHELTER'S COUNSELORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We, as former Orangewood Children's Home counselors, are writing in regard to 
the article written about Orangewood and the alleged abuse occurring there. We 
are concerned that the article presented a biased viewpoint and that the 
general public, knowing little of the day-to-day operation of Orangewood, will 
have a negative image brought to mind each time Orangewood is mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
Of equal importance is that we personally were hurt by the article. It must be 
understood that working at Orangewood is not a typical 9-to-5 job. To work at 
Orangewood is to open your heart and your life to care for hurting and abused 
children. When your day is over and you go home, you are not finished working; 
you worry about the children. Their problems become your problems. Their fears 
become your fears. And the next day you go back with love, dedication and hope 
to guide you through another day in making a difference in a child's life. 
</P>
<P>
Each day the group counselors strive to be there for the children. Field trips 
are continuously being taken. Counselors frequently take their own time after 
work to take children to the mall or to dinner to give them special one-on-one 
attention. During the holidays, many children who are not able to spend the day 
with their families are taken out of Orangewood to spend the day with a 
counselor and their family. These are dedicated individuals whose first 
priority is the children. 
</P>
<P>
We hold the highest regard and respect for the group counselors at Orangewood. 
Their job is a most difficult one. We left Orangewood feeling proud of the work 
we did there and will continue to support the outstanding achievements of the 
counselors. We hope those who read the article will keep in mind that what was 
represented was one viewpoint and there are so many more of us who feel that 
our work at Orangewood is building self-esteem, providing crisis intervention, 
healing the hurts, and loving the children as our own.

TRIBUTE TO UCI'S DANIEL ALDRICH -- AN EDUCATOR AND RENAISSANCE MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifteen years ago I served as the president of our community association. In 
those days, we sponsored a candidate forum before each election. 
</P>
<P>
On the docket was a forum for the upcoming school board election and I thought, 
"Wouldn't it be great to have the UC Irvine chancellor, Dan Aldrich, moderate 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Off went an invitation filled with slightly veiled references to civic duty but 
anticipating a polite "No, thank you." Surprise! I received an immediate 
telephone call of his acceptance and a request to come by my house to work out 
the details. 
</P>
<P>
We met, discussed the event and had a delightful time sharing our common 
interest in growing things and our equally common interest in education. I, who 
nearly missed the college experience, suddenly realized why he was doing such a 
spectacular job at UCI. Fortunately, others discovered that talent long before 
me. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks, Dan. Thanks from all of us.

SPORTS BARS AIM TO SCORE BIG WITH GIANT TVS; 
</P>
<P>
TRENDS: FANS FROM AS FAR AWAY AS L.A. CONVERGE ON ORANGE COUNTY PUBS THAT OFFER 
VERITABLE VIDEO BUFFETS ON HUGE SCREENS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It's Saturday afternoon, and 20 or so people, mostly men, have forsaken the 
blue skies and bright sun to huddle in the semidarkness of the 16 video 
monitors in the Out of Bounds Sports Bar and Grill in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the televisions have 8-foot screens. Six monitors line the wall behind 
the bar, with two others boxing the corners. The rest jut at odd angles to 
provide full coverage. It's a veritable video buffet. 
</P>
<P>
The Out of Bounds probably wasn't what they had in mind on the East Coast when 
tavern owners set those first black-and-white televisions on their bars. A 
sports bar was four walls and a roof, a place to hang out, drink, talk about 
Mantle and Williams, Orr and Tittle. It was a way to get through the sloppy 
winters. 
</P>
<P>
When the sports bar was exported to California, it underwent some perhaps 
predictable changes. It's a marketing concept rather than a hangout. A place 
where there's male bonding rather than buddies. 
</P>
<P>
Glitzy or not, the sports bar theme works. "It's a concept that began in the 
mid-1970s that became very popular," says Tony Romero, beverage supervisor at 
Champions American Sports Bar and Grill at the Irvine Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, Saturday afternoons this time of year are given over to baseball. But 
on this day, with the lockout just ended and opening day yet to start, the 
screens are aglow with college basketball -- the NCAA semifinal double-header 
of Arkansas versus Duke, followed by Georgia Tech versus University of 
Nevada-Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
While Duke and Arkansas go at it on all screens, Out of Bounds owner Mark 
Larsen oversees the installation of two more satellite receivers that can pull 
in stations from Kentucky, Moscow, or as Spike Lee says about Michael Jordan, 
the Sea of Tranquillity. 
</P>
<P>
Larsen has spent the last three years turning the bar into a video sports 
mecca. "If it's up there, I'll get it," he tells me. "There are 20 satellites 
up there, and 24 channels on each. It's a matter of search and find." 
</P>
<P>
Larsen, a confirmed sports fanatic, was convinced from the outset that more and 
bigger televisions would draw more sports fans. "Especially football. That's by 
far the sport that everybody watches," he says. "During football season, at 9 
a.m. people are waiting to get in. They come from as far as L.A.; they fight 
for the seats at the bar because they can watch all the games at once." 
</P>
<P>
He adds: "I wish football was 36 weeks a year. If it was, I could close all 
week long and just open on Sundays." 
</P>
<P>
But while the sports theme will carry a bar a long way, it's not always into 
the end zone of financial success. There will inevitably be down times. For 
example, on the Wednesday night before college basketball's Final Four, the Out 
of Bounds is, by its own standards, dead to the world. Maybe a dozen customers 
ambled about, unaccustomed to the elbow room. 
</P>
<P>
On the big screen near the stage, there is horse-jumping from Florida. The 
eight televisions over the bar are tuned to different stations; National 
Invitation Tournament basketball is side by side with the world snowmobile 
championships and beach volleyball. Lee Marvin is slapping the Dirty Dozen into 
shape, although what we are hearing is 50 watts of Chick Hearn and Laker 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
On the main monitor the Lakers are playing the Clippers. The monster screen 
gives the game a three-dimensional immediacy; from the angle of the camera 
under the basket, a driving layup looks as if it is about to provide an 
in-your-face look at the business end of a size 14 Reebok. This is sports as it 
was meant to be seen on television. 
</P>
<P>
The small crowd is made up of stayers. Two women alternately shoot pool and 
shoot free throws in the basket toss. None of the men make a serious effort to 
get friendly with them. 
</P>
<P>
They say Out of Bounds actually has several personalities. 
</P>
<P>
"This bar does a metamorphosis around 9 o'clock," says Bob Bond, an electrical 
components salesman from Huntington Beach. After 9, a band cranks up, and the 
bar fills with younger people ready to boogie. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Larsen has found that the bar's schizo personality doesn't confuse 
customers. "On Thursday, Friday and Saturday it's a meat market," he agrees. 
</P>
<P>
I ask Larsen's friend, Mark Matteke, a carpenter from Tustin, what the best 
night is for being in the bar. "During football season the best night is 
Monday," he says. If you're looking for women (although he doesn't phrase it 
quite so delicately), Friday and Saturday nights. 
</P>
<P>
On the TV screens, the Duke Blue Devils are beginning to overpower the 
Razorbacks. The customers are attentive but unenthused. 
</P>
<P>
At such sports bars as Jeff's Sports Connection Deli in Orange, Henry's Goat 
Hill Tavern in Costa Mesa and the Time Out Sports Bar in Anaheim, sports fans 
get much the same attention. Time Out has three satellite dishes to power its 
televisions. Patrons gobble 150 pounds of peanuts a week, recycling the shells 
as carpeting. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a meat market. The guys aren't here to pick up chicks. Their first 
question is, 'Is the game on?' " says Tammy Radan, who owns Time Out with her 
husband, Dave. 
</P>
<P>
For true East Coast sports bar ambience, Reagan's Irish Pub on Jeronimo Road in 
Mission Viejo wins hands down. Reagan's is a dark cavern of swirling smoke and 
conversation. Celtics and Red Sox photos and posters line the walls. 
</P>
<P>
At the Champions American Sports Bar and Grill in the Irvine Marriott, 60 or 70 
customers are settling in for this afternoon's main course: UNLV and Georgia 
Tech. About half are there for the game; the rest seem to be overflow from a 
wedding. 
</P>
<P>
Champions is cheerful, sanitary, well-lit. At Champions the bartenders and 
waitresses are dressed in referee's outfits. An old movie poster touts "The 
Rose Bowl Story." There's a Magic Johnson poster, full size. California Angels 
uniforms are reverently sealed in a glass case on one wall. 
</P>
<P>
There are 25 Champions bars across the country, and this, reputedly, is the 
busiest of them. Champions is the kind of place one can bring the family, which 
indeed several people have. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Out of Bounds, Champions can show different programs on different 
televisions, and the staff is good about tuning in special games for the 
regulars, Kendall says.

AIR TRAFFIC IN EUROPE FACES CROWDED SKIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A "radical reorganization" of the way in which Western Europe manages its air 
space is "urgent and essential" if the region's air transport system is not to 
be brought to a near standstill in the late 1990s because of congestion, 
according to a report released this month. 
</P>
<P>
The study, commissioned by the International Air Transport Assn., said the 
number of airline passengers carried each year in Europe will almost double, 
from 267 million in 1988 to 500 million by the year 2000. By 2010 that figure 
could reach 740 million. 
</P>
<P>
The IATA report called for a unified Europe-wide air traffic control system 
instead of the 22 or 23 systems operating now, as well as reorganization of air 
corridors, expansion of airports and other changes. 
</P>
<P>
Unless improvements are made, 16 of 27 major airports in Western Europe will 
not be able to meet forecast demand by the year 2000, the study predicted. 
These airports, in order of worst potential problems, are: Madrid, Frankfurt, 
London Gatwick, London Heathrow, Barcelona, Milan Linate, Duesseldorf, Dublin, 
Stockholm Arlanda, Athens, Palma de Majorca, Geneva, Manchester, Marseilles, 
Copenhagen and Hamburg. 
</P>
<P>
Luxury rail travel is being offered between Los Angeles and the San Francisco 
Bay Area on board the privately owned California Sun Express double-decker dome 
cars of Amtrak's Coast Starlight trains. 
</P>
<P>
The new service operates daily between Los Angeles and Oakland. Organized 
sightseeing tours with an overnight stay at San Luis Obispo and Morro Bay are 
also available. 
</P>
<P>
The upper level on each of the cars seats 64 passengers in upholstered seats 
with brass handrails, oak tables and plush carpeting. All passengers have seats 
in the full-length upper dome, with unobstructed 360-degree views. 
</P>
<P>
The lower level features a 22-seat dining salon with white linens, imported 
china, French stemware and silver flatware. All meals are prepared from scratch 
by a chef in the stainless steel electric kitchen. Brunch and dinner, featuring 
a California-style menu, are served on the train. 
</P>
<P>
The one-way fare between Los Angeles and San Luis Obispo is $99.50; from Los 
Angeles to Oakland without a stopover, the one-way fare is $179. Two-day, 
one-night packages are available starting at $379. 
</P>
<P>
For more information, contact Princess Railtours, 2815 2nd Ave., Suite 400, 
Seattle, Wash. 98121, toll-free (800) 835-8907. 
</P>
<P>
Parisians and visitors to the city in a few years will be able to ride the 
"boa." 
</P>
<P>
Transport officials in Paris this month unveiled the Metro of the future, a 
46-meter experimental prototype that will start test runs in June. 
</P>
<P>
The new train has none of the old separations between cars but, like its 
namesake the boa constrictor, is one long, continuous train that can hold up to 
890 passengers -- 5% more than those now in use. 
</P>
<P>
If tests prove successful, the city will order enough to replace the current 
1,400 metro trains between the years 1998 and 2010, when the present cars will 
average 30 years old. 
</P>
<P>
A California company's proposed "Third World in America" tour has tourism 
promoters in Virginia, West Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky hopping mad. 
</P>
<P>
For $500, Global Exchange of San Francisco, a nonprofit research ands action 
center specializing in "awareness" tours to such countries as Haiti, the 
Dominican Republic, South Africa and Brazil, will take participants on an 
excursion through Appalachia June 17-25 to see impoverished families, crumbling 
coal mining towns and appliance-strewn streams. 
</P>
<P>
"I suggest that those folks could save a lot of money and get a great dose of 
Third World reality simply by walking through the barrio in Los Angeles," West 
Virginia Commerce Commissioner John Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're looking for poverty and environmental problems, yes, you can find 
them in our three states," said Cindy Ford, spokeswoman for the Nashville 
Chamber of Commerce. "But I don't think we have any more problems than any 
other state. 
</P>
<P>
"If they want to visit West Virginia, they can come for the white-water rafting 
or to visit one of our state parks. It might be a chance for them to breathe 
clean air." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the criticisms have actually helped promote the tour, with Good 
Morning America, Cable Network News and several major newspapers calling for 
more information. 
</P>
<P>
According to Laurie Adams, tour coordinator for Global Exchange, the name of 
the tour alone "raised some flags" among people who have a stereotypical view 
of the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been really surprised at the response," she said. "It (the Appalachia 
tour) is just one aspect of the program we have, which is to meet with people 
in different countries and different communities and share ideas on (such 
matters as) the environment, unemployment, women's issues and so on." 
</P>
<P>
Global Exchange's programs are intended to be educational and to help break 
through stereotypes and prejudices, she said.

RYE ONCE WAS HAVEN FOR WRITERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

RYE, England 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a stormy night in January, 1726, a ship carrying King George I from Hanover 
to London ran aground near the town of Rye on England's south coast. 
</P>
<P>
News of the king's unexpected arrival traveled quickly to the town's mayor, 
James Lamb, who rode down to the shore and escorted the king back to Rye. For 
the next four nights, the monarch slept in Lamb's elegant red-brick manor at 
the top of Mermaid Street. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike King George, the first time I visited Rye was for one night. Immediately 
I regretted the brevity of my stay. 
</P>
<P>
No sooner had I left than I longed to return and wander the cobblestone streets 
of this ancient town, where I could enjoy England's seaside, countryside and 
history all in one place. 
</P>
<P>
Rye sits on a hill overlooking vast Romney Marsh, a luxuriant flatland of 
grassy fields and grazing sheep. Its narrow lanes bustle by day, yet fall 
silent and brooding at night, lit eerily by the glow of street lamps and the 
moon on the sea beyond. 
</P>
<P>
Although Rye's glory days as a major seaport are long over, it is one of the 
best-preserved towns in England. 
</P>
<P>
Rye is two hours by train from London. At the next opportunity I returned, this 
time for several days. I wasn't the first to find the town so irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 100 years, British and American writers and poets have flocked to 
Rye and Romney Marsh. Henry James came to England in 1876, took up residence in 
the old Lamb House in 1898 and stayed for 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
His contemporaries, H. G. Wells, Stephen Crane, Joseph Conrad and Ford Madox 
Ford, lived nearby. British writer E. F. Fenson moved into Lamb House shortly 
after James' death, and American poet Conrad Aiken lived in Jeakes House on 
Mermaid Street from 1924 to 1947. 
</P>
<P>
Although Rye's isolated setting has made it a sanctuary for the creative 
spirit, the town has not always been so tranquil. The sea once flanked Rye on 
three sides, and for centuries it was one of the most important ports on the 
south coast of England. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1700s, Rye was the favored lair of smugglers. The notorious 
Hawkhurst gang, which terrorized even the king's customs agents, made its 
headquarters at the Mermaid Inn on Mermaid Street. 
</P>
<P>
After a successful nighttime raid they would often sit by the windows of the 
inn, loaded pistols before them on the table, drinking and carousing. 
</P>
<P>
As late as 1823 the tides still lapped the cliffs of Rye. Gradually, however, 
the three rivers that empty into Rye Harbor piled up its silt and left Rye 
aground, three miles from the English Channel. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the town has not lost its watch on the sea. From the lookout at the end of 
High Street, you can see out to the harbor, and, on a clear day, across the 
Channel to the French coastal towns of Boulogne and Dieppe. 
</P>
<P>
James wrote some of his most celebrated novels at Rye, including "The 
Ambassadors" and "The Golden Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
James had coveted Lamb House since seeing a watercolor of it at the home of a 
friend in London. When he later learned that a long-term lease was available, 
he snapped it up. 
</P>
<P>
Lamb House quickly became a center for literary hobnobbing. 
</P>
<P>
Crane, author of "The Red Badge of Courage," lived out on Romney Marsh at 
Brede's Place, while British author Ford -- who later moved to Paris and became 
a patriarch to the writers of the Lost Generation of the 1920s -- had a house 
in the nearby town of Winchelsea. There he collaborated on two novels with 
Conrad. 
</P>
<P>
Callers from London often would take a morning train down to Rye, arriving at 
Lamb House in time for lunch. After the meal, James would lead his coterie on a 
jaunt across the marsh and among the grazing sheep to Winchelsea. 
</P>
<P>
One morning I decided to hike the same path, with the help of a map I had 
picked up at the Martello Bookshop on High Street. After three pleasant hours 
of zigzagging across grassy fields I arrived at Winchelsea. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take long to find a village tea shop, where I rested over cakes and 
hot cups of Earl Grey tea before catching the bus back to Rye. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to understand what drew Henry James and his literary colleagues to 
Rye, spend some time wandering its narrow streets. 
</P>
<P>
Along Cinque Ports Street parts of the old town wall still stand. Four stone 
gates once guarded the corners of Rye, but only one remains, the 14th-Century 
Land Gate. 
</P>
<P>
The two barrel-shaped towers and stone archway of this massive portal once were 
fitted with a drawbridge; during high tide it was the only entrance into the 
town. 
</P>
<P>
The clock above the arch was installed in 1863 as a memorial to Prince Albert, 
Queen Victoria's beloved consort. It broke down in 1940, but was repaired in 
1981 to celebrate the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana. But you would 
still be wise not to set your watch by it. 
</P>
<P>
In the center of Church Square at the highest point of the town is St. Mary the 
Virgin, one of the most glorious churches in this part of England. The 
buttresses seem to float out from its exterior walls. 
</P>
<P>
Two rows of high arches grace the interior, and in the early afternoon the sun 
streams in through the stained-glass windows and sets the chancel aglow. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of St. Mary's began early in the 11th Century and continued for at 
least 100 years. Much of the original structure was destroyed in 1377, when the 
French sacked Rye, burned most of the town to the ground and carried the church 
bells off to France. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the town's inhabitants, suspected of putting up too feeble a 
resistance, were condemned as traitors and hanged. The following year a party 
of men from Rye and Winchelsea launched a retaliatory raid on the French and 
recaptured the bells. 
</P>
<P>
In time St. Mary's was rebuilt. Set into one of its interior arches are the 
giant coal-black pipes of the church organ. One morning I wandered in and found 
the organist at practice. I sat down, mesmerized, as he played Albinoni's 
haunting "Adagio" and set every molecule in the cathedral vibrating. 
</P>
<P>
A short walk from Church Square will take you to the end of Watchbell Street, 
which looks out over the cliffs to Strand Quay. This was the center of trade 
during the prosperous Elizabethan Era. 
</P>
<P>
Once the sea reached to the edge of the quay, but today the wharf is touched 
only by the banks of the River Tillingham. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Traders Pass takes you to Mermaid Street where the medieval, 
black-timbered Mermaid Inn, former haunt of smugglers, has been left to a 
peaceful existence as a hotel and restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
At the top of Mermaid Street is the red-brick facade of Lamb House. During the 
summer season the first floor and garden are open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Some of James' books, letters and other possessions are on display there. Among 
them is a copy of the lease James signed when the coveted house first fell into 
his hands. 
</P>
<P>
The night before I had to leave Rye, just before going to bed, I felt myself 
drawn again to Mermaid Street. 
</P>
<P>
The fog had settled over the darkened, ancient lane, now lit only dimly by a 
street lamp. As I stood alone, the cobblestone pressing hard into my feet, I 
found my imagination drifting back through the centuries. Suddenly I heard a 
sound in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
Was it the wind? Perhaps. But then again, could it have been the Hawkhurst 
gang, laughing and shouting, making their way up Mermaid Street?

DOORS ARE FINALLY OPEN TO WESTERNERS IN OMAN

MUSCAT, Oman 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They look quite elegant, the Omani men in their white dresses, dishdashas, with 
silver-hooked dagger sheaths at their waist belts. 
</P>
<P>
In the oasis of Nazwa, 80 miles west of Muscat, they offer a visitor a cup of 
Arabic coffee according to traditional rules of hospitality. They want to know 
where the visitor is from and rapidly get involved in a lively discussion. 
</P>
<P>
If it were not for the Japanese-made pickup trucks in the background, packed 
with vegetables and fruits, one could easily feel transported into a 
century-old Arab society. 
</P>
<P>
Oman offers tourists more than bazaars. Portugese and Arabic forts dot the 
coastline, where more than 200 empty sand beaches are spread along a 1,200-mile 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
One can also see forts on mountains or in valleys near oases in the back 
country, such as in Bahla and Jibrin. 
</P>
<P>
When the Gulf of Oman is hot and humid, from April till November, tourists 
mainly from the Gulf countries flock to the southern region of Dhofar near the 
port city of Salalah, the "Garden of Eden in the Arabic peninsula." 
</P>
<P>
Citizens from the six-nation Gulf Co-operation Council have been able to enter 
Oman without restrictions for several years. Now, under rules in force since 
January, most Westerners are able to receive a tourist visa. 
</P>
<P>
Before, only a limited number of tour groups from the West were allowed in 
because a tourist infrastructure was underdeveloped, and the government wanted 
to protect its people from "cultural shock." 
</P>
<P>
"Oman is an unspoiled country, and we will do our best to keep it like this. 
That is why we are opening slowly," said Fatik Bin Fahr, director-general of 
the tourism authority. 
</P>
<P>
"Oman will not offer cheap tourism. We do not want backpack tourists who cannot 
behave and then create problems." 
</P>
<P>
Said his assistant, Mohammad Nur: "The hospitality of every nation has its 
natural limits." 
</P>
<P>
That's the reason why the tourism authority plans to allow no more than 50,000 
Western tourists per year to enter the country through 1995, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nur said that Oman is getting advice from the United Nations in order not to 
repeat mistakes made by countries such as Spain, where a tourism boom saw 
skyscrapers spring up along the coasts and millions of tourists each year erode 
national traditions. 
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, about 16,000 tourists visited Oman in 1988, 
and the figure for 1989 is expected to be a few hundred more. About 6,000 
Westerners arrived during the winter of 1989-90, 2 1/2 times more than in the 
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
The country was virtually closed to non-Arabs before 1970, when Sultan Qabus 
deposed his Muslim fundamentalist father and began a step-by-step modernization 
of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Oman gained about $53 million from tourism in 1988, an important source of 
income that it hopes will expand, as crude-oil reserves may be depleted in 30 
years. Now 90% of foreign-curency earnings are from oil exports. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials are coming up with ideas to attract more visitors. 
Foreigners are now allowed to take photographs of Sultan Qabus's fairy-like 
palace and the adjacent restored old buildings inside Muscat's defense wall. 
Security measures are relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
But photographers who want a picture of the bazaar in Nazwa had better hurry. 
Most parts were being destroyed to clear space for a modern shopping center.

MAKING CLOSE CONTACTS OF THE ORANGUTAN KIND

KUTAI NATIONAL PARK, Borneo 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Within a minute of our arrival by boat, my wife, Cat, had a baby orangutan 
thrust into her arms. 
</P>
<P>
"I must make tea. I must make tea," one of the rangers said frantically. "Could 
you hold him for a moment? It's all right, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
All right to hold a baby orangutan? My wife was wearing one of the biggest 
smiles I had ever seen. "Welcome to Kutai, East Kalimantan," said the ranger, 
returning with two glasses of tea. 
</P>
<P>
My wife also let me hold the little orangutan. To hold the infant, to feel its 
skin and hair and to have it grasp your hand was a unique and wonderful 
sensation. 
</P>
<P>
Kutai National Park on the Indonesian side of Borneo is where guests can make 
close contact with orangutans, found in the wild only on the islands of Borneo 
and Sumatra. These "wild men of Borneo," as an early explorer described them, 
are an endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
Because their ultimate fate rests with their habitat, the rain forest, getting 
to see one of these apes outside of a zoo is a rare event. 
</P>
<P>
Borneo and Sumatra have several orangutan rehabilitation centers, but most 
restrict contact between travelers and orangutans because they receive many 
thousands of visitors a year. 
</P>
<P>
Kutai, on the other hand, is different. Because of its remote location, the 
park gets very few visitors -- maybe 25 a year -- who generally stay only one 
or two days. In a busy month, five or six travelers may show up. The rangers 
spend most of their time in the reserve, which is about two hours by boat from 
the closest town. 
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government for years has had plans to develop and expand Kutai 
Park. Plans include a road that would link the reserve with Samarinda, the 
provincial capital, as well as guest cottages and larger staff quarters. 
</P>
<P>
The road will make Kutai more accessible, but may also destroy the special 
quality that the area offers because it gets so few visitors. No one seems to 
know when the road will be built; virtually no progress has been made on it in 
the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
Three guest bungalows are under construction now. If you want to see the park 
in its pristine condition, visit it in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
After playing with the baby orangutan only a few minutes, one ranger said, 
"Come quickly. Big orangutan." 
</P>
<P>
We followed him outside into the clearing where an adolescent orangutan was 
just coming in from the jungle. The rehabilitation center takes in orphaned 
orangutans and trains them to live on their own in the jungle. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, semi-wild "teenagers" come back for food. This one ran to Cat and 
climbed up her clothing until he was holding onto her by the back of her neck. 
He appeared to be as strong as he was heavy. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants some food," said the ranger. "We call it 'Orangutan Terrorism.' He'll 
hang on until you give him something to eat. He won't hurt you, though." 
</P>
<P>
I went back for the bananas I had brought with us. When the orangutan saw the 
food, he jumped onto me, plucked the bananas out of my hand and climbed into a 
tree. 
</P>
<P>
We went for a walk through the jungle, which felt like a scene out of an 
adventure movie as the ranger hacked a trail through the brush with his 
machete. He pointed out orchids, trees that had what looked like human hair 
growing from their trunks and limbs, all sorts of medicinal and carnivorous 
plants. He made us wait silently while a wild boar ran across our path. 
</P>
<P>
We couldn't see the sun because of the forest canopy. If the ranger hadn't made 
notch marks on trees as we walked, we would have had no idea how to get back. 
We saw a wild orangutan in a tree and also came across some large monitor 
lizards near the water's edge. 
</P>
<P>
Just before sunset some deer came out to feed near the rangers' quarters. A 
spectacular hornbill flew by as the baby orangutan crawled on our laps and 
played. It was about as perfect as it ever gets. 
</P>
<P>
The trip to Kutai Park is rough. First, you have to get to Samarinda or 
Balikpapan on the Indonesian east coast of Borneo. Direct connections to the 
outside world are few, the best being a direct flight to Balikpapan from Brunei 
on the north coast of Borneo (with easy access from Singapore or Hong Kong). 
</P>
<P>
A crowded longboat leaves Samarinda every morning about 6 a.m. to Bontang, an 
eight-hour trip down the Mahakam River and onto the open sea. A few days a 
week, from both Samarinda and Balikpapan, a "speedboat" makes the trip in four 
to six hours. 
</P>
<P>
Once in Bontang, go straight to Kutai Park headquarters, known in Indonesia as 
Taman National Kutai or PPA. The rangers at the headquarters will help arrange 
a hotel for the night, and a boat charter out to the park reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Round trip from Samarinda to the park should cost about $40 U.S. per person for 
everything: transportation, food and lodging. Lodging inside the park is free 
now, but a nominal fee is expected to be charged when the guest quarters are 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
Longboats are not comfortable. The hotels in Bontang are definitely not Holiday 
Inn caliber. And there are no mattresses at the park site. If you go, it's a 
good idea to take along a pad or air mattress. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a good idea to bring some food. The rangers have plenty of rice and 
are willing to share it. But sometimes they run out of everything else (for 
three days before our arrival they were living on only rice and sugar). 
</P>
<P>
Noodles, fresh fruit, vegetables and protein, such as dried fish or meat, 
hard-boiled eggs or canned meat are good ideas. You can buy everything in 
Bontang. It would be a nice gesture if you shared the food with the rangers. 
They do a lot for visitors.

INNS, HOTELS, B&amp;BS IN THE GREAT NORTHWEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE IRVING, Irving is co-author of Northwest Best Places 1990-1991, 
(Sasquatch Books, Seattle,$15.95). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pacific Northwest is a natural delicacy with rocky coastlines, verdant 
mountains and fertile farmlands. At times its exterior can appear gray, its 
climate sober, its waters chilled and its mountains temperamental. But at other 
moments it is warm and sunny and frosted with wildflowers under constantly 
changing skies and crystal-clear air. 
</P>
<P>
There are many wonderful places to stay. The inns, hotels and bed and 
breakfasts that follow are a few of its treasures. 
</P>
<P>
April Point Lodge: P.O. Box 1, Campbell River, B.C. V9W 4Z9, Canada (about 100 
miles north of Vancouver on Quadra Island), (604) 285-2222; double rooms start 
at $99 a night. This is not roughing it. April Point Lodge is perhaps the 
finest fishing lodge in the Northwest and not just because the knowledge the 
fishing guides have is based on generations of experience. Cabins are 
attractive, with large fireplaces, and food is outstanding. You must fly or 
take a ferry in. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia Gorge Hotel: 4000 Westcliff Drive, Hood River, Ore. 97031 (about an 
hour east of Portland), (503) 386-5566 or (800) 345-1921; double rooms start at 
$135 a night. On a cliff overlooking Columbia Gorge, just above where hundreds 
of windsurfers zip back and forth across the river. If you're going to stay in 
this handsome hotel, a gorge-side room is a must (otherwise you may find 
yourself overlooking and overhearing Interstate 84). A seven-course breakfast 
comes with an overnight room. It's so big it's frightening. 
</P>
<P>
Four Seasons Olympic Hotel: 411 University St., Seattle, Wash. 98101 
(downtown), (206) 621-1700 or (800) 223-8772; double rooms start at $190 a 
night. Seattle's most elegant hotel, it's not as luxurious as you might expect, 
but refreshingly simple. The service is gracious and the hotel exhibits 
four-star touches. 
</P>
<P>
Hastings House: P.O. Box 1110, Ganges, B.C. VOS 1EO, Canada (halfway between 
Vancouver and Victoria in the Gulf Islands), (604) 537-2362; double rooms start 
at about $200 a night, including breakfast and afternoon tea. A remarkable 
place in part due to the surroundings amid fruit trees, gardens and rolling 
lawns that overlook a peaceful cove on Salt Spring Island. A dozen suites in 
four renovated farm buildings. Our favorite is the Hayloft with its bay window 
seat, Franklin stove and folk art. The service is especially prompt and 
efficient. 
</P>
<P>
The Heathman Hotel: 1009 S.W. Broadway, Portland, Ore. 97205 (downtown), (503) 
241-4100 or (800) 551-0011; double rooms start at $125 a night. The place to 
stay in Portland, it has afternoon tea each day, an exquisite marble bar for 
the evening, elegant rooms and one of Portland's finest restaurants. You feel 
well taken care of but not fussed over. 
</P>
<P>
The James House: 1238 Washington St., Port Townsend, Wash. 98368 (about 50 
miles northwest of Seattle); (206) 385-1238; double rooms start at $60 a night. 
Among the Northwest's first B&amp;Bs and Port Townsend's finest Victorian home. 
James House has about a dozen antique decorator rooms, though the best ones 
face Puget Sound. The main floor has two beautiful parlors, each with a 
fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
Mattey House Inn: 10221 N.E. Mattey Lane, McMinnville, Ore. 97128 (35 miles 
southwest of Portland), (503) 434-5058; double rooms start at $55 a night, 
including breakfast. The Mattey House stands behind its own little vineyard, 
like a remote French manor. It's an 1890s Victorian mansion. It has nice extra 
touches such as fresh flowers, plush bathrobes and, appropriately, a glass of 
wine in the parlor. The hosts are enthusiastic guides to the Willamette Valley 
wine country. 
</P>
<P>
Mazama Country Inn: P.O. Box 223, Mazama, Wash. 98833 (185 miles northeast of 
Seattle), (509) 996-2681; double rooms start at $58 a night. A spacious lodge 
in the middle of pristine Methow Valley, where in the winter guests 
cross-country ski over the 100 miles of groomed trails. In the summer they 
explore the valley on horseback. The original inn was a converted farmhouse but 
the new cedar building has a bit more charm. It's rural without being rustic. 
Dining is family style. 
</P>
<P>
Paradise Ranch Inn: 7000-D Monument Drive, Grants Pass, Ore. 97526 (about 200 
miles south of Portland, about 61 miles north of the California border), (503) 
479-4333; double rooms start at $83 a night. Imagine a working dude ranch 
turned into a Northwest resort. That's exactly what you'll find here, with 
activities ranging from trout fishing to tennis, swimming in a heated outdoor 
pool to hiking. But best of all, it's not a sprawling resort. Having only 18 
rooms makes it very peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Beach Hotel: 267 N.W. Cliff, Newport, Ore. 97365 (about 114 miles 
southwest of Portland); (503) 265-5428; double rooms start at $50 a night. In 
this informal bluff-top hotel for bookworms, each of the 20 rooms is decorated 
in a different literary theme. For instance, the Agatha Christie room is in 
green English chintz with a tiled fireplace and items that served as clues in 
Christie mysteries. The best part of the hotel is the library on the third 
floor that has a fireplace, lots of comfortable chairs and a wide-open view of 
the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Tyax Mountain Lake Resort: Tyaughton Lake Road, Gold Bridge, B.C. VOK 1PO, 
Canada (about 110 miles north of Vancouver), (604) 238-2221; double rooms start 
at $98 a night. This place defines indulgence for the active minded. The best 
way to get here is by float plane. It's right by a lake, though the key to fun 
here is "heli" anything: heli-skiing, heli-hiking, even heli-fossil hunting. 
You can stay in the large log lodge but if you arrive with a group try to 
reserve one of the three chalets on Tyaughton Lake. 
</P>
<P>
The Willows: 2579 West Shore Drive, Lummi Island, Wash. 98262 (about 100 miles 
north of Seattle), (206) 758-2620; double rooms start at $90 a night. On 
pastoral Lummi Island, the Willows has only four rooms but all are very 
comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
However, it's the Saturday night dinner, really a feast, that has won such a 
following among locals. It begins at sunset on the porch to the accompanyment 
of a harpist and guitarist and finishes five courses later in the sitting room 
with a civilized glass of port. Dinner cost is $75. Reservations are required.

CONSUMER REPORT: THROUGH-FARES OFFER REAL SAVINGS; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: MANY CARRIERS OFFER COMPLIMENTARY FLIGHTS TO OUTLYING CITIES IN 
FOREIGN DESTINATIONS AS PART OF A "THROUGH-FARE" POLICY. BUT YOU MAY HAVE TO 
ASK ABOUT IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Free flights to other destinations once you fly to a carrier's gateway city 
overseas? 
</P>
<P>
That's possible when airlines provide a "through-fare," allowing overseas 
travelers to fly at no charge after their arrival to cities near their primary 
destination. 
</P>
<P>
Also, an airline may pick up the tab for a domestic flight from a connecting 
city in California to its gateway at LAX if the traveler is flying out of the 
country on that carrier. 
</P>
<P>
The same airline may allow you to reverse this procedure and fly back from Los 
Angeles to another city in California after your return international flight. 
</P>
<P>
Through-fares, which airlines also call "common rates," also may be available 
once you arrive abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the size of the country you're going to, you might be able to fly 
on to another city without additional charges. In a small country like the 
Netherlands, for example, through-fares probably would not be offered to 
another city from the gateway city of Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
Many airlines offer through-fares to LAX, which can save money for passengers 
in outlying areas. But availability of these special fares, which can vary 
depending on the particular kind of basic fare involved, and time of year, is 
not always heavily promoted by the carriers. Check with your travel agent or 
airline directly for options. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, there are often many opportunities to add cities to your overseas 
itinerary, free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
"Through-fares are part of the airline structure, and they should always be 
considered when you're close to a major gateway in the United States," said 
Mikki Fink of Sun Coast Travel in Westlake Village. "People are often very 
surprised at all of the extra cities they can go to." 
</P>
<P>
For example, SAS offers free round-trip flights to LAX from all cities in 
California to its passengers flying out of LAX on most of its regular and 
discount fares. 
</P>
<P>
On Lufthansa, the fare for a Palm Springs-LAX-Frankfurt flight would be the 
same as if you flew from Los Angeles to Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
Through-fares from San Diego to Los Angeles are often available. And in some 
cases, your international fare may be even lower. The San Diego-LAX-Frankfurt 
fare on Lufthansa can be as much as $43 less round trip than the LAX-Frankfurt 
fare. 
</P>
<P>
Fares from LAX and San Francisco on the same carrier to points overseas are 
often identical. 
</P>
<P>
Suppose you wanted to spend time in San Francisco for business or personal 
reasons? In some cases, an airline might pick up your round-trip LAX-San 
Francisco fare to catch its flight from San Francisco. Air New Zealand, for 
example, offers this perk on most of its fares. 
</P>
<P>
Other domestic examples: Iberia and Korean Air offer through-fares from San 
Diego and San Francisco to LAX. Pan Am also offers through-fares from San Diego 
and San Francisco to LAX. Swissair provides through-fares from San Francisco, 
San Diego, Oakland, Fresno, San Jose and Sacramento to LAX on most of its 
fares, as does KLM for San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
On its regular and APEX fares, Air France offers through-rates from San Diego, 
Fresno, Monterey, San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, Sacramento, Ontario, Long 
Beach, Santa Ana and Las Vegas to Los Angeles on its LAX-Paris flights. 
</P>
<P>
However, if you fly Air France from LAX to Paris on its nonrefundable Eurosaver 
fare, only Fresno, Monterey, San Diego, Sacramento and Las Vegas have 
through-fares. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, these domestic flights must be taken only on USAir, whereas you can 
fly to LAX on virtually any carrier on the regular and APEX fares to Paris. 
</P>

British Airways has launched a program of complimentary round-trip helicopter 
flights from John Wayne Orange County Airport to LAX. This service is available 
to all passengers on regular fares. If you fly first or business class, you can 
also opt to get a free ride to LAX through Concierge Limousine Service. 
</P>
<P>
Similar benefits may be available once you arrive overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Varig lets Rio de Janeiro-bound passengers departing from LAX on most regular 
and discount fares continue on to Sao Paulo at no extra cost. 
</P>
<P>
In Europe, SAS offers through-rates from its gateway of Copenhagen with all of 
the cities in the mainland or Jutland part of Denmark; Oslo, Bergen, Stavanger 
and Christiansen in southern Norway, and Goteborg in Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Swedish capital of Stockholm isn't included in this option. You 
have to purchase your seat to Stockholm, but once you get there you can fly 
free to five other cities in Sweden: Jonkoping, Kalmar, Norrkoping, Vasteras 
and Vaxjoe. 
</P>
<P>
"You can find many examples of through-fares in Europe," Eileen Drutman, SAS 
spokeswoman, said. "They're available most often with regular fares, but they 
can be utilized with promotional fares as well." 
</P>
<P>
Lufthansa lets you fly at no extra charge from its gateway city of Frankfurt to 
Bonn, Cologne, Dusseldorf, Hamburg and Stuttgart. In addition, Lufthansa offers 
its own rail services free from Frankfurt to Bonn/Cologne, Dusseldorf and 
Stuttgart. 
</P>
<P>
If you fly LAX-Dusseldorf-Munich on Lufthansa, you can continue on free of 
charge to Bremen, Hanover, Nuremberg, Berlin and even Leipzig in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Swissair permits passengers on its LAX-Zurich flights to fly to Geneva and 
Basel at no extra charge. And Korean Air lets you journey to Pusan, 
second-largest city in South Korea, from Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
However, once your stay in a city is considered a stopover, rather than a 
connecting point, the chance to fly free to other points may be lost. 
Internationally, once your stay reaches six hours, it's considered a stopover. 
An exception is when the next flight to your ongoing point isn't available 
within 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Some travelers take advantage of this option and book flights so that they 
arrive at the overseas gateway too late to catch the last plane of the day to 
their next point. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, it would be a prudent move to have your ticket written to the 
farthest point you can go on a through-fare before you leave the United States. 
Although you can have a regular- fare ticket rewritten overseas to fly on to a 
common-rated city at no charge, getting it accomplished may be difficult or 
even impossible with a promotional fare.

SKAGWAY, NOT SITKA

<TEXT>
<P>
Having had the opportunity to take several cruises to southeast Alaska, I can 
vouch for the many wonders about which Shirley Slater and Harry Basch 
accurately wrote ("A Couple of Ways to See Alaska From Sea Level," April 8). 
</P>
<P>
However, while it is true that in Sitka one can see many examples of Russian 
architecture, one cannot see the ghost of con man Soapy Smith still stalking 
the streets. 
</P>
<P>
To appreciate the lore and legend of Alaska's greatest confidence man, one must 
go to Skagway, walk the streets which Soapy walked during the gold rush days 
and visit Soapy's grave. Soapy lives on, but in Skagway, not in Sitka.

MOSCOW EXTENDS LITHUANIA EMBARGO TO FOOD, METALS; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: THE LEADER OF THE LOCAL COMMUNIST PARTY APPEALED FOR COMPROMISE, 
SAYING THAT THE PRICE OF INDEPENDENCE "MUST HAVE LIMITS." EARLIER, SOLDIERS 
STORMED A PRINTING PLANT AND BEAT CIVILIAN GUARDS.

VILNIUS, Soviet Union 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moscow on Friday expanded its energy embargo on Lithuania to include certain 
shipments of food, metal and industrial parts in its continuing effort to crush 
the republic's independence drive, Lithuanians said. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Soviet soldiers also stormed a printing plant and beat civilian 
guards and a local legislator Friday, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin "is seeking to stop the plants, put the workers on the streets, and 
encourage social unrest," Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis charged at 
a news conference Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far in the 5-week-old standoff, no such unrest has occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Despite military and economic pressure, Lithuanians have refused to back off 
their March 11 declaration of independence from the Soviet Union, as demanded 
by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and have solicited Western material 
and political support. 
</P>
<P>
In Birmingham, Ala., where President Bush gave a political speech at a rally, 
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Friday the White House is "increasingly 
concerned" by reports of the Soviet economic crackdown on Lithuania and that 
Bush will be ready to brief Congress early this week on possible retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania was forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
Two ships from Cuba carrying raw sugar were diverted from the Lithuanian port 
of Klaipeda and a shipment of fish due from Latvia was sent elsewhere, 
Lithuania Deputy Prime Minister Romualdas Ozolas told reporters Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania produces more meat and milk than it consumes and is in no danger of 
starving. 
</P>
<P>
But Lithuania's Communist Party chief, Algirdas Brazauskas, said Friday this 
Baltic republic of 3.8 million people must compromise on its pro-independence 
decisions or face critical shortages of oil and natural gas in two weeks, after 
Soviet cutoffs and reductions the previous two days. 
</P>
<P>
Brazauskas said Moscow also has cut off the supply of rubber tires, 
polyesterol, cables, bearings and caustic soda. Large scheduled shipments of 
metal and wood failed to appear, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most factories here are expected to close if Lithuania cannot solve either the 
embargo-induced shortages or the confrontation with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"In two weeks we will have a critical situation," Brazauskas told the 
Lithuanian parliament. "The price for independence must have limits." 
</P>
<P>
Algimantas Cekuolis, a newspaper editor and former Lithuanian representative in 
the Soviet parliament, told reporters Lithuanians may offer to freeze their new 
laws backing up independence, "if Moscow gives us guarantees of something." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has refused to negotiate unless Lithuania rescinds its declaration of 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene was in Norway on Friday learning about 
buying oil for hard currency at world-market prices instead of low-cost oil for 
Soviet rubles. She offered to trade Lithuanian dairy products and said she will 
seek financial aid from the West. 
</P>
<P>
But even if she succeeds, she said Lithuania does not have the facilities to 
transport imported crude oil to the republic's single refinery. Apparently, a 
pipeline would have to be altered. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Western diplomat in Moscow noted that the Soviet Union would have to 
agree to Lithuanian imports because it controls the coastline. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all this, Foreign Minister Lennart Meri of neighboring Estonia said in 
Finland on Friday his republic rejects Soviet threats and inducements and 
refuses to rescind a March 30 declaration proclaiming itself an occupied, 
independent state. 
</P>
<P>
Armed soldiers stormed a Communist Party printing plant in the center of 
Vilnius on Friday afternoon, beating at least 12 civilian guards and a local 
legislator, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet soldiers previously occupied more than a half-dozen party and public 
buildings, but without violence. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuanian legislator Zigmas Vaisvilas told reporters the civilian guards 
arrived Friday at the plant, which already was occupied by a few Interior 
Ministry troops without weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet news agency Tass said the colonel in charge asked the 27 civilians 
to leave and called in reinforcements when they did not. 
</P>
<P>
Helmeted Soviet soldiers carrying automatic weapons and truncheons arrived in 
two trucks, surged into the building and beat some of the civilians, said 
witness Angele Guobiene, who works for the trade union journal Darbas Ir 
Poilsis, which is printed at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper editor Algimantas Cekuolis said the civilians, including legislator 
Vaisvilas, were hurt when they tried to bar the soldiers. Two or three people 
were hospitalized, Cekuolis said. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said the civilians were hurt when soldiers shoved them bodily out the 
door. 
</P>
<P>
Police kept reporters out of the building. Soldiers were visible behind a gate 
in the building's courtyard. Some workers barricaded themselves near printing 
presses and looked out of open second- and third-floor windows. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 people gathered outside. They sang nationalist songs and carried the 
hammer and sickle of the Soviet Union merged with the Nazi swastika. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers began occupying buildings in Vilnius a month ago, among them a plant 
that prints the republic's newspapers. The plant occupied Friday prints 
non-political magazines. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania on Friday limited gasoline to about eight gallons a month for private 
cars and some large factories were to give workers a day off Saturday -- the 
only conservation steps reported to deal with the cutoff of oil and loss of 80% 
of its supply of natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
The energy embargo left Lithuania with only 15% to 17% of the 18 million cubic 
meters of natural gas it uses daily for homes and industry. 
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary spokeswoman Daina Kalendra said that as of Thursday the republic 
has suffered no electricity shortage. 
</P>
<P>
Brazauskas, an economic manager by training and chairman of parliament's 
emergency energy committee, led the government until the pro-secession Sajudis 
movement won control in February elections and declared independence in March. 
</P>
<P>
Last December he split his party from Moscow and won approval of many 
Lithuanian nationalists. Some see him as a pragmatist who best could deal with 
the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
But deputies of the Supreme Council, Lithuania's parliament, accused him Friday 
of trying to slow Lithuania's independence drive. 
</P>
<P>
"You're raising a white flag," charged Kazis Saya, a writer. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has demanded repeal of new republic laws that halt conscription of 
Lithuanians into the Soviet army and introduce identity cards for all citizens. 
He also complained about alleged seizure of Communist Party property. 
</P>
<P>
Brazauskas said the March 11 declaration should not be reconsidered, but urged 
lawmakers to compromise on Gorbachev's other demands "to take us out of this 
dead end."

SERVICES UNDER FIRE FOR KEEPING WOMEN OUT OF COMBAT JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visiting Soviet Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev had a problem. He wanted to thank the 
Navy pilots who had flown him to and from the aircraft carrier Roosevelt, and 
one of them was a young woman. 
</P>
<P>
Akhromeyev crisply returned the salute of Lt. Cmdr. John Labella, then faced 
Lt. Christine Lipphardt. She also stood at attention and saluted. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't know what to do," recalled Akhromeyev's host and American 
counterpart, Adm. William J. Crowe, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
It was clear, Crowe said, that the man who commanded millions of Soviet 
soldiers couldn't decide whether military discipline or his social conditioning 
should prevail. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally, he grabbed her hand and kissed it," Crowe recalled with a chuckle. 
"And then she got confused!" 
</P>
<P>
The admiral, now retired, likes to recount that 1988 incident to show the 
advancements women have made in the American military services. 
</P>
<P>
As demonstrated by Army Capt. Linda Bray's command of a military police unit 
during the Panama invasion last December, women over the last 10 years have 
slowly assumed many jobs that place them in harm's way. 
</P>
<P>
Bray, riding in an armored Jeep under fire, directed troops of the 988th 
Military Police Company in an assault on a Panamanian Defense Forces canine 
unit barracks. (Initial news reports said three Panamanians were killed in the 
skirmish, but the Army said later that no bodies were found.) 
</P>
<P>
"Shots were fired. I returned fire. And that's the way it was," Bray said 
later. 
</P>
<P>
One who argues that women should be allowed to go into combat is retired Brig. 
Gen. Evelyn Foote, who joined up when women were relegated to the Women's Army 
Corps to serve primarily as nurses or secretaries. 
</P>
<P>
"When the shooting starts, it's a moot issue," said Foote, whose career spanned 
29 years in posts from Vietnam to Europe. "The nature of the modern battlefield 
means that there are no front lines, no flank, no rear. . . . If women are 
serving, they will be in combat." 
</P>
<P>
Others remain skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"The simple truth is this: However well one woman (or 1,000 women) may have 
performed in a firefight in Panama, it does not change the fact that men -- as 
a group -- fight better than women," Lou Marano, a Vietnam vet and a Washington 
Post editor, asserted in a recent commentary. 
</P>
<P>
The Women's Armed Services Integration Act of 1948 prohibits the Navy, the Air 
Force or Marine Corps from assigning women to duty on "vessels or in aircraft 
that are engaged in combat missions." 
</P>
<P>
By policy, the Army bars women from participating in its primary fighting 
elements -- infantry, tank and most artillery units -- but they do serve in 
many of the supply or support units that could end up in the thick of battle. 
</P>
<P>
The legal restrictions against women in combat do not include the Coast Guard, 
which is under the Department of Transportation in peacetime, but it is unclear 
whether women in Coast Guard command positions would retain their posts should 
the Coast Guard be integrated into the Navy in time of war. 
</P>
<P>
As pressure has grown to open more military jobs to women, the definition of 
combat has changed. In 1988, Pentagon officials devised the "risk rule" to 
determine what chance of being in combat, encountering hostile fire or being 
captured any unit faces. 
</P>
<P>
Because the services have some leeway over which jobs are open to women, some 
restrictions have fallen by the wayside and debate rages over others. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1989, 229,000 women were in the Army, Navy, Air Force and 
Marines, representing about 11% of military personnel. The Coast Guard had 
2,700 women, or 7.3%. 
</P>
<P>
The number of women in the military has risen dramatically since 1967, when 
President Johnson lifted a 2% maximum rule. He also ended a ban on women as 
generals or admirals. 
</P>
<P>
With the introduction of the all-volunteer force in 1973, the military began to 
recruit women to fill its ranks. 
</P>
<P>
A recent study by RAND Corp. found that one of eight new recruits is female. 
And more women want to volunteer than are accepted, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
Although most women still go into administrative, clerical, medical, 
communications or intelligence specialties, they are being integrated more and 
more into male-dominated jobs. They are being graduated from the service 
academies and slogging through basic training with their male colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Side by side with men, women control the keys to nuclear launching equipment in 
the Air Force's underground missile silos. 
</P>
<P>
They've served aboard ships in the Persian Gulf, repairing and refurbishing 
ships damaged by enemy missiles. 
</P>
<P>
They tote M-16 rifles on guard duty at bases from Okinawa to West Germany, and 
stand ready to ferry supplies to troops should war break out again in the 
demilitarized zone between Communist North Korea and capitalist South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
In Panama, women flew Strategic Air Command transports that refueled planes 
carrying troops and supplies from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
They dodged bullets and artillery fire while flying troops to battle aboard 
Blackhawk helicopters -- two of the pilots were the first women to be nominated 
for the prestigious Air Medal with a bronze V for valor. 
</P>
<P>
For all these advances, the confusion that struck the five-star Soviet general 
when he faced Lt. Lipphardt seems also to afflict many male leaders in this 
country as well, when it comes to the idea of women as warriors. 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt in Lipphardt's mind. She flies planes to and from aircraft 
carriers with mail, people and supplies, but she can't be based on a warship as 
a jet pilot because that would be combat duty. 
</P>
<P>
Now, without a chance to go after what she considers the Navy's most 
challenging job, she is thinking of leaving the service. 
</P>
<P>
"If the ban against combat flying were dropped, maybe I'd feel differently," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, the Pentagon's Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services 
reported to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney that the services "can ill afford to 
continue to limit these women and their experiences in the face of the 
anticipated manpower shortages of the 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
Based on statistics alone, women seem to fare best in the Air Force, where 
long-distance weaponry allows 97% of its specialties to be open to women; 13.6% 
of the Air Force is female. 
</P>
<P>
Women are barred from fighters, bombers, tactical airlift transports and some 
helicopters, but they are allowed to fly in some cargo planes, in command-post 
aircraft, on reconnaissance aircraft and on support missions. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force recently lifted restrictions against women flying on the 
transports that drop paratroopers into battle zones. 
</P>
<P>
The Army is 11.4% female, and its recruitment advertising boasts that more than 
93% of its specialties are open to women. Given the service's combat needs, 
however, this means that about half of all Army jobs are closed to women. 
</P>
<P>
The Army, after more than a year of indecision, still doesn't know what to do 
with about 345 women trained as field artillery officers who were pulled from 
their jobs amid objections that they would be too exposed to enemy fire. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy, which is 9.9% female, bars women from serving on all aircraft 
carriers except the Lexington, a training ship. Other combat vessels, such as 
destroyers and cruisers, are also off limits, but women do serve at sea on 
support ships, such as oilers and tenders, that supply carriers, submarines and 
other fighting vessels. 
</P>
<P>
In the Marines, just 4.8% of jobs are open to women. Officials noted that 
because the corps relies on the Navy for medical services, it has relatively 
few nursing jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Questions about the future of women in the military have grown sharper, not 
only because of the attention focused on the hundreds of women who participated 
in the Panama invasion, but also because of the massive personnel cuts that lie 
ahead as the Cold War winds down. 
</P>
<P>
Two congresswomen say they want to ensure that military women don't suffer 
disproportionately in reductions of forces that seem certain to come with the 
easing of East-West tensions. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.), a member of the House Armed Services 
Committee, has introduced legislation to allow women to go into combat, at 
least on a trial basis. Her bill would allow women in the Army to apply for all 
positions, including combat-related ones. After four years, the women's 
performance would be evaluated to see if the program should be continued. 
</P>
<P>
"Polls show 7 out of 10 Americans think women should have a chance to serve in 
combat units if they want to," Schroeder said. "It's a really touchy issue . . 
. but we've had women die in combat, and I think the American people are aware 
of what that means." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Beverly B. Byron (D-Md.), chairman of the House Armed Services 
subcommittee on military personnel, agrees that more job categories should be 
open to women but opposes their entering combat units. 
</P>
<P>
"We're moving along at a pace I'm comfortable with," she said. 
</P>
<P>
West Point and the Navy and Air Force academies began graduating women only 10 
years ago, so few female officers have had time to reach the higher, 
decision-making ranks. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, just seven women held the rank of general or admiral. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still in the process of aging the officer corps," Gen. Foote said. "It's 
going to take us a while to get women where they can make more than just token 
changes in the way the military is run."

<P>
Bob Thorlakson looked back at 22 years in the Army and ahead to the shrinking 
military of the post-Cold War '90s and made a decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I got out. I decided not to wait around for the cuts to hit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thorlakson and untold numbers of other men and women in the American armed 
forces are trying to make their peace with peace. 
</P>
<P>
Some are leaving. Many more are considering it. Most apparently are hoping to 
hold on, unsure whether they will avoid the ax but unwilling just now to give 
up the uniform and make the leap back to civilian life. 
</P>
<P>
"You read so much about the cutbacks that are coming down the road," said Lt. 
Col. Bill Daniels, who plans to retire this year after he completes his 20th 
year in the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
These private struggles are being played out across the nation and at U.S. 
bases abroad as the Bush Administration and Congress scale down defenses in 
light of a suddenly receding Soviet military threat. Big force reductions are 
coming -- some estimate 300,000 people over four years -- although the crunch 
is not likely to hit many military families until next year. 
</P>
<P>
Thorlakson, 45, didn't know when he retired last December if he would have been 
forced out by the cutbacks. He held the rank of lieutenant colonel and was 
nearly eligible for promotion. But the Army's future -- and thus his own -- 
looked so murky that he took his chances on a civilian job. 
</P>
<P>
Like many others who had never held a job outside the military, Thorlakson 
stumbled at first. He took a job selling family financial services but soon 
found it didn't suit him. He quit. Now he is looking for work in personnel 
management. 
</P>
<P>
Thorlakson, of suburban Washington, is confident that he will find a good job. 
But for many others facing similar decisions, the prospect of change can be 
intimidating -- even though it's too early to know how many one-time soldiers 
will be competing for civilian jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"They are apprehensive. They don't know what's going on," said Jack Merritt, a 
retired Army general who keeps in close contact with servicemen. He is 
executive vice president of the Assn. of the United States Army, a champion of 
Army causes. 
</P>
<P>
The fear is felt even among those just entering the service. 
</P>
<P>
Merritt spoke recently to ROTC cadets at Norwich University, a military school 
in Northfield, Vt. 
</P>
<P>
"That was foremost on their minds: 'Is there a future for me now?' 
</P>
<P>
"My answer is, of course there's a future, but it will be a future for fewer 
people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon planners are worried too. They've never had to shrink an all-volunteer 
force, which now has 2.1 million active-duty personnel. Many careers will be 
slowed, many ended. And some will be changed even before they begin. A recent 
Pentagon report to Congress said many ROTC students, some of whom signed up as 
long as five years ago, will not be allowed to enter active duty. They will 
have to serve their required time in the reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, probably starting next year, the pink slips will start coming. The 
Pentagon is concerned that this might hurt morale and discourage America's 
youth from taking a chance on the military in the future. 
</P>
<P>
In force reductions after World War II and the Korean and Vietnam wars, 
thousands of draftees were itching to turn in their weapons and get back into 
civvies. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not true today," Christopher Jehn, the assistant defense secretary for 
force management and personnel, said in an interview. "Everybody in the 
military wants to be there, including many who believe they made a career 
commitment to the military." 
</P>
<P>
"They've all got contracts with us," Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said 
recently. "And so how we treat them is going to have a big impact on our 
continued ability to recruit and retain first-class people to serve in the 
military." 
</P>
<P>
The problem is most acute in the Army, which plans to cut about 135,000 from 
its total force of 770,000 by 1994. And Congress could order more. 
</P>
<P>
Most Army cuts will hit the enlisted ranks but officers also will be dropped. 
The Pentagon recently asked Congress for greater authority to fire officers in 
grades below lieutenant colonel. It said this would be done only as a last 
resort, but added: "The Army's situation is severe enough to warrant such 
action," even if more is done to encourage officers and others to quit 
voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
Brig. Gen. Timothy Stroup, the Army's top personnel manager, said one of his 
main goals is to prevent former soldiers from feeling that they were unfairly 
forced to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"They go back to the hometowns of America . . . to be the fathers and mothers 
of the next generation of young men and women that join the military," Stroup 
said. "It's important that we have satisfied alumni." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.), the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed 
Services Committee, said: "Memories are long. If we botch the job now in 
scaling back military spending, can we depend on an all-volunteer force to come 
to our rescue in the future?" 
</P>
<P>
Many in Congress are calling for deeper and swifter reductions than the 
Administration has proposed. They know that the quickest path to a "peace 
dividend" is to save on troop costs, even though the Defense Department 
cautions against a politically inspired rush to retrench. The Pentagon spends 
nearly half of its $300-billion-a-year budget on manpower. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said it can reach its goal of shrinking the armed forces by 50,000 
people this year with few if any firings. Fewer recruits will be hired to fill 
the usual number of vacancies left by retirements, resignations, deaths and 
discharges. 
</P>
<P>
Attrition alone won't do the trick in 1991, though, or for the next several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Because the services have not yet resorted to dismissals, the fear of firing is 
only beginning to set in. 
</P>
<P>
"When you see those cuts, then you'll see a different attitude among the young 
kids with 10 or 12 years of service: 'Where am I going?' they'll wonder," said 
Col. Fred Allega, a Marine pilot who is retiring, but not because of the coming 
squeeze. 
</P>
<P>
"People are feeling more secure than they should," said Navy Capt. Bruce 
Sherman. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley D. Hyman, president of Identify Research Institute, which advises 
military people on making the transition to civilian life, said most soldiers 
are at least vaguely aware of the painful adjustments they face but are trying 
to ignore them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like they're thinking, 'I know I'm going to the dentist to have all my 
teeth pulled, but it's next year. I'm all right now. When it's going to be 
tomorrow, I worry.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hyman hears from soldiers around the country. One recent day, while talking 
with a visitor at his home in McLean, Va., Hyman got a call from a sailor who 
said he was thinking of quitting because his base at Norfolk, Va., would be 
cutting back. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy is scared," Hyman said after hanging up. 
</P>
<P>
Signs of increased anxiety among military people are just beginning to appear, 
said Hyman, who has been advising service families for more than 20 years. He 
predicts that force reductions will take a heavy emotional toll in the next 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to see more suicides, more family breakups," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jehn, the Pentagon personnel chief, said he needs Congress' help to make the 
force reductions as quickly as required but as painless for people as possible. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department is asking for authority to provide severance pay to 
enlisted people who get the ax -- something never done before. Under current 
law, officers cut after five to 20 years of service are given one month's base 
pay for each year of service, up to $30,000. Jehn said enlisted people should 
get equal treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Stroup, the Army personnel chief, said the department also needs more latitude 
to cut officers. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to do that, but we have to reduce the force and you want to keep 
your force balanced so you don't have too many senior officers and no junior 
officers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jehn said the department also is developing an experimental program, in 
cooperation with the Labor Department, to help servicemen with 10 to 14 years 
of experience adjust to the civilian job market. They will be advised on ways 
of searching for a job, conducting themselves in job interviews, and writing 
resumes. 
</P>
<P>
"Those kinds of things most of these people aren't going to know," he said.

PLAN FOR RADIOTELESCOPE GENERATES EXCITED BUZZ AMONG ASTRONOMERS

<P>
George Seielstad stood numbly as he looked at the wreckage of his 
"one-of-a-kind" radiotelescope set in a valley of the rugged Allegheny 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The radiotelescope, which is as long as a football field, had collapsed in on 
itself one cool November night in 1988, the result of metal fatigue after 26 
years of searching the heavens from a special "radio quiet zone" about 220 
miles west of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I was speechless and felt total disbelief. That telescope was one of a kind," 
said Seielstad, director of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory at Green 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
But the heap of twisted metal has given scientists a stellar opportunity. Plans 
are under way for a radiotelescope to tower 35 stories above and 330 feet 
around isolated Deer Creek Valley. 
</P>
<P>
By 1995, the $75-million telescope should be ready to map the undiscovered 
universe by listening to the radio waves of outer space instead of peering into 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're making something that will define the state-of-the-art radiotelescope 
technology to take us well into the next century," Seielstad said. 
</P>
<P>
Astronomers said the telescope's technical advancements will open more doors to 
understanding the evolution of the universe and composition of gases between 
galaxies. Scientists also can pursue more in-depth studies of pulsars, or 
small, quick-moving stars. 
</P>
<P>
The first telescope, completed in 1962 for $850,000, detected radio signals 
from far beyond the Milky Way and helped unlock the secrets to pulsars and 
quasars. 
</P>
<P>
The new telescope will be designed to receive more and clearer signals with a 
solid surface of about 2,000 individually controlled panels to counteract the 
sagging effects of gravity as the telescope moves. 
</P>
<P>
The telescope also will be fully movable, allowing it to point anywhere in the 
northern sky. The original telescope moved only up and down and relied on the 
Earth's rotation for further direction. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be 10 times more sensitive than anything else we have on Earth," said 
Ludwig Oster, program manager for the National Science Foundation, which is 
funding the project. "It will be on the cutting edge of technology and will do 
research that can't be done anywhere else. We can look further back in time 
toward the 'Big Bang.' " 
</P>
<P>
The telescope will be able to pick up naturally emitted radio signals from as 
far away as 10 billion light-years, giving scientists a glimpse into when 
galaxies first formed, astronomers said. 
</P>
<P>
The first search for intelligent life was at Green Bank and the new telescope 
may be included in some occasional extraterrestrial studies, Seielstad said. 
</P>
<P>
Green Bank is in the world's only radio quiet zone, a 13,000-square-mile area 
designated by the federal government in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
Local radio and television stations can be picked up by the valley's 500 
residents, but signals are carefully regulated. Many residents have cable 
television. The mountains of the Monongahela National Forest also shield the 
instruments from radio "noise" caused by anything from car engines to toasters. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes this a unique spot on Earth and is the equivalent of a national park 
except we're protecting radio-frequency space," Seielstad said. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Lockman, an astronomer at the observatory's office in Charlottesville, Va., 
said the advanced telescope and radio quiet zone will make Green Bank a leading 
facility for astronomers from all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
"The collapse left a major gap, but you have to take events like this and focus 
on the future and new opportunities," Seielstad said. "We couldn't have 
predicted it would have turned out this well."

Gonzalez has raised lions for the last 10 years on his farm in the interior. He 
said Brazil's soaring crime rate has helped create a steady demand. 
</P>
<P>
"I recommend a large back yard, the construction of a gate and plenty of space. 
Then let them roam free at night," Gonzalez said in a telephone interview. 
Three lions guard Gonzalez's home. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez started with three lions smuggled from Africa and raises a litter 
every three months. When the cubs are 30 days old, he puts them up for sale for 
$300, using classified ads. So far, he has sold 30 lions. 
</P>
<P>
"They adapt remarkably well to life at home. I never have a problem selling 
them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez said a baby lion needs to be fed two to three big chickens a day, 
supplemented with a few cans of dog food. Adult lions require four chickens and 
about nine pounds of meat daily, which can run to about $250 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping lions at home is legal in Brazil, said Capt. Allan Salazar of the 
Forestry Police in Minas Gerais, of which Belo Horizonte is the capital. He 
said non-native animals are unprotected by law. 
</P>
<P>
"Exotic animals can be kept at home if conditions are good. The owner is 
responsible for security and the animal's actions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez says he visits the homes of all his clients after they buy their lions 
to make sure that there are no problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Lions are as loyal as dogs. In fact, I recommend getting a dog to keep your 
lion company because they learn to play together," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said lions are no problem with children either, as long as the animal is 
purchased "when small, so they can get used to each other." 
</P>
<P>
And he says a lion-guarded home is a safe home. 
</P>
<P>
"Thieves are smart. They always scope out their targets -- if there's a lion on 
the premises they won't try robbing the house," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One happy customer is Ana Maria Conceicao de Oliveira, who lives with her 
husband, 13-year-old daughter and "Mikey," the 20-month-old family lion, which 
occupies a large pen in the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
"We bought Mikey to scare away burglars and I'm sure no thief would enter our 
house. People around the neighborhood know we have a lion so the word is out," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her daughter, Raquel Christina, plays with the lion in the back yard and feeds 
him a daily ration of 20 pounds of chicken necks, lungs, hearts and kidneys. 
</P>
<P>
"Burglars are afraid of dogs. Imagine how they would feel about Mikey," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez denies having any problems with customers, but the Rio newspaper 
Jornal do Brasil reported at least one woman was unhappy with her lion and 
resold it because it had ripped up her bathroom when she gave it a bath. 
</P>
<P>
"In practice, I learned that a lion is a lion and a dog is a dog," said the 
woman, identified only as Maria Celia. "A lion is temperamental and difficult, 
very different from a puppy."

'DEATH LOTTERY' DRAMATIZES CROWDING IN BRAZIL PRISONS 
</P>

<P>
To dramatize extreme overcrowding, inmates at a prison in the industrial center 
of Santo Andre have taken up a form of protest that surfaces from time to time 
in Brazil's squalid penal institutions -- the "death lottery," in which a 
selected inmate is killed. 
</P>
<P>
Marcelo di Pietro, 27, a convicted rapist and murderer, was strangled to death 
in late March by other inmates at the Santo Andre main prison. He and 46 other 
inmates had been kept in a cell built for six. 
</P>
<P>
Prisoners vowed to continue with a list of a dozen inmates marked for death 
until authorities correct the overcrowding. The jail, which was designed for 96 
prisoners, held 368 in late March. Following the transfer of 40 inmates, the 
Santo Andre prisoners agreed to grant authorities another month to work on the 
problem before resuming the "lottery" -- which apparently is less a matter of 
chance than a group decision to kill specific inmates. 
</P>
<P>
Di Pietro's death focused new attention on the critical problems of crime and 
punishment in Brazil. Economic crisis and an influx of illegal drugs have sent 
the crime rate soaring and filled the prisons to overflowing. A report last 
year by the human rights group Americas Watch, titled "Prison Conditions in 
Brazil," found that Brazil had 87,000 inmates crammed into 41,000 spaces. 
</P>
<P>
"Violence by both guards and inmates is widespread," the report concluded. 
"Torture to obtain confessions is common, and guards reportedly beat prisoners 
often. Inmates assault and rape other inmates, and, as a form of protest 
against prison conditions, sometimes even murder them." 
</P>
<P>
Death lottery killings gained notoriety in 1985. In the course of two months, 
17 inmates in prisons around the city of Belo Horizonte were killed by their 
cellmates, who were complaining of overcrowding, bad food, lack of medical 
care, bureaucratic delays and violent treatment at the hands of guards. 
</P>
<P>
Jail conditions became a national scandal in February, 1989, when 18 prisoners 
were crushed to death in a Sao Paulo police lockup after guards had crammed 51 
men into an isolation cell that measured 9 feet by 4 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The situation remains critical in Sao Paulo state, where Secretary of Public 
Security Antonio Claudio Mariz de Oliveira admitted that 130 prisoners should 
be removed from the Santo Andre prison immediately, but said there is no place 
to put them. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not have a short-term solution for this grave problem," Mariz de 
Oliveira said, "as the situation in Santo Andre is exactly the same as in the 
other prisons of Sao Paulo." 
</P>
<P>
Di Prieto, the victim of the slaying in March, appeared to have been killed in 
the manner used in previous death lottery slayings. One inmate jumped on his 
chest to stun him and another strangled him. 
</P>
<P>
The participants often target rapists. "Among the victims of these rapists 
might be our daughters, our wives, our mothers," one prisoner told the 
newspaper Estado de Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
The Santo Andre inmates say they have a list of 12 other prisoners who are 
"condemned" and say the killings will resume if the overcrowding is not solved. 
</P>
<P>
An inmate's letter published in March in the Sao Paulo press described 
mistreatment at the hands of guards, including beatings as well as thefts from 
food packages brought by family members. One major complaint is that the 
bureaucracy moves too slowly, so that prisoners are kept in jail beyond their 
scheduled release dates. 
</P>
<P>
Di Prieto, who maintained his innocence of the three rapes and murders that had 
landed him in the Santo Andre prison, knew he had been chosen to die. "Do not 
miss my wake, or I will be very sad," he wrote to his girlfriend just before he 
died. "A kiss from this man who has but few hours to live."

ISRAEL'S PRESIDENT HERZOG RETURNS TO AIRWAVES; 
</P>
<P>
BROADCASTING: HIS RADIO REPORTS DURING THE 1967 WAR MADE HIM A HERO. A RECENT 
ADDRESS ABOUT CURRENT SECULAR-RELIGIOUS STRIFE CAUSED A SENSATION.

<TEXT>
<P>
Israeli President Chaim Herzog, whose radio reports during the 1967 Middle East 
War gripped his countrymen, has returned to his hobby of broadcasting to 
enliven his largely ceremonial duties. 
</P>
<P>
On the last Thursday of each month Herzog sits at his desk in his official 
residence in Jerusalem and tapes an address to the nation, an Israeli version 
of the fireside chats popularized by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 
1930s. 
</P>
<P>
"I am completely at home with the microphone," said Herzog, 71, a former 
British and Israeli military officer, U.N. ambassador, Labor Party legislator, 
lawyer and historian. 
</P>
<P>
His radio reports in 1967 made him a civilian war hero in Israel's six-day 
victory over Egypt, Syria and Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize it at the time, but I had a listener rating of over 90%," the 
Irish-born Herzog, president since 1983, said after taping an address last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-minute speech, broadcast the next day, caused a minor sensation. 
</P>
<P>
Descending from the perch of presidential neutrality, Herzog fueled a raging 
debate between Israel's secular majority and the religious minority that holds 
the balance of power in a fractured Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
He hailed the contribution to Israel of kibbutzniks -- members of collective 
settlements and international symbols of the country's pioneer spirit -- and 
blasted those who dare to defame them. 
</P>
<P>
A few days earlier, politically influential Rabbi Eliezer Schach had questioned 
the Jewishness of the non-observant kibbutzniks, a pillar of support for 
Herzog's Labor Party. 
</P>
<P>
"Does the nation know how much it owes this group of people?" Herzog asked 
listeners in Hebrew that still lilts with an Irish accent. "Do (they) not 
deserve that we stand by their graves and ask their forgiveness?" 
</P>
<P>
He complained about the besmirching of secular leaders by "those (who) have 
never heard the din of battle," a dig at Orthodox Jews exempted from army 
service to pursue religious studies. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli media played excerpts of the broadcast for days, prompting the 
president's office to deny that Herzog -- whose father was the first chief 
rabbi both of Ireland and of Israel -- had explicitly or implicitly criticized 
Schach. 
</P>
<P>
But the message in the radio address was unmistakable. 
</P>
<P>
Two religious parliamentarians accused him of abusing his neutral post and 
called on him to resign. But the overwhelming public response was positive, 
presidential aides and Israel Radio director Amnon Nadav said. 
</P>
<P>
Herzog's career is crammed with achievement, but he is seen at times as 
patrician and remote from the concerns of the common Israeli. 
</P>
<P>
His office, graced with portraits of Britain's Queen Elizabeth and Prince 
Philip and pictures of him meeting world leaders, may reinforce this image in a 
down-to-earth country. 
</P>
<P>
While Israel's liberal Establishment rallied behind his broadcast and backed 
his pleas for electoral reform to reduce the power of minor parties, it has at 
times been disenchanted with Herzog, who was elected by Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
His fondness for broadcasting does not stretch to affection for the news media, 
which he says have tarnished Israel's image. 
</P>
<P>
Succeeding the popular Yitzhak Navon, who turned the presidency into a 
"national conscience," Herzog urged Israelis to preserve democracy and fight 
racism between Arabs and Jews. 
</P>
<P>
But critics say the president, a former head of army intelligence and military 
governor of the occupied West Bank, has been soft on civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986 he pardoned the head of the Shin Bet security service and three aides 
involved in killing two captured Arab bus hijackers and a subsequent cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
He also made three controversial decisions to commute prison sentences of 
far-right Jewish gunmen convicted of killing Palestinians. The third such 
gesture of clemency was announced last year at the height of Jewish vigilante 
attacks on Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
Before becoming president, Herzog hosted a number of shows for Israeli radio 
stations and was a frequent contributor to the British Broadcasting Corp. in 
the late 1970s with a quarterly "Letter from Israel." 
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio asked him more than a year ago to start broadcasting again, but he 
said he was reluctant at first because he did not want to intervene in politics 
during an election period.

HONESTY RESTORED AT LOOTED CANDY SHOP 
</P>

<P>
When looters plundered their candy and tobacco shop in the chaos that 
accompanied Hurricane Hugo seven months ago, Hal and Mary Longer decided to 
return to the States. 
</P>
<P>
Now they have decided to stay, touched by the unexpected honesty of some of the 
looters. 
</P>
<P>
While cleaning up their ransacked shop, the Longers were astonished to find a 
dozen IOUs from people who took part in a three-day looting rampage on St. 
Croix Island after Hugo struck Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Then other fellow residents -- realtors, business people, a lawyer, even a 
territorial senator -- began stopping by to confess that they, too, had taken 
things from the store and would pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me feel great that there are some honest people in the world," 
Longer, 63, said recently in his refurbished store. 
</P>
<P>
"It restores your faith," his wife, 49, said from behind the candy counter. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three main U.S. Virgin Islands, east of Puerto Rico, the hurricane hit 
St. Croix by far the hardest. About 90% of the houses were destroyed or 
damaged, and reconstruction continues on the island, which has 55,000 permanent 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
St. Croix's image as a Caribbean tourist haven was tarnished by the looting. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of businesses were plundered. About 100 people were arrested, and even 
some police officers and national guardsmen were accused of taking part in the 
looting. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush sent 1,100 military police, who remained for two months. 
</P>
<P>
The Longers, who moved to St. Croix from Davenport, Iowa, in 1987, were 
visiting Philadelphia when the hurricane struck. They returned two weeks later 
to find their shop, called Steele's Smokes &amp; Sweets for a previous owner, 
in ruins. 
</P>
<P>
"The place was a mess," Longer said. "The inventory was trashed and even the 
scales were gone. Cleaning up was the worst, because they threw stuff all over 
the walls. There was no need for that." 
</P>
<P>
Their house also was heavily damaged. The Longers said they were ready to move 
back to the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
That was before they found IOUs for stolen goods that had been left for them in 
their own shop and the one next door. 
</P>
<P>
One scribbled on an envelope said: "I took four boxes of cigars. I am one of 
your regular customers. I will pay you when I see you -- Bill." 
</P>
<P>
"On the back of the envelope, someone else wrote: 'I took some too -- Don,"' 
Longer said. 
</P>
<P>
Bill and Don later paid their total debt of $100, he said, and added, "Every 
one of the people but one has voluntarily come in to pay, and I know the one 
will." 
</P>
<P>
Longer said a man walked in one day, wandered around as if looking for 
something to buy, then handed him $27 for six tins of stolen pipe tobacco, and 
"the guy's had a smile on his face every time he's come back in the shop." 
</P>
<P>
Other St. Croix shopkeepers had similar experiences. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Seroogy, 39, owns the Solitude Country Store, a grocery in the island's 
affluent East End. After he reopened, Seroogy said, people approached him 
wanting to make amends. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was first told of some of the people who were in the store and what 
they were doing, I was really mad, just very angry and disappointed," he said. 
"But when they started coming back and, indeed, came forth and paid, I wasn't 
angry." 
</P>
<P>
Hal and Mary Longer said their rebuilding costs were $136,000, including 
$37,000 in damaged or stolen inventory, and insurance covered all but $14,000 
of the loss. 
</P>
<P>
The main reason they decided to stay, they said, is the way their customers 
have treated them since the hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gov. Derek Hodge said the IOUs showed that many looters were ordinary 
people panicked by the ferocious storm. 
</P>
<P>
"In the darkest days of our despair, there were those who recognized being a 
good citizen still had a value," he said.

GIANT PANDAS THREATENED BY INBREEDING

The recent discovery of a way to speed up bamboo flowering, hailed as the 
salvation of the giant panda, was a waste of effort, according to a Chinese 
expert who says inbreeding could be the end of the endangered animals. 
</P>
<P>
Indian researchers announced in March that they had developed a revolutionary 
process to cause bamboo, the panda's only food source, to flower and produce 
seeds decades earlier than its normal life cycle. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, bamboo flowers only once in its lifetime, after growing from 12 to 
120 years. The flowering takes place in an entire grove and, when it is over, 
the whole grove dies. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, some Chinese scientists raised the alarm that pandas were in imminent 
danger of starvation after a large grove of arrow bamboo flowered and died in 
the Wolong panda reserve in Sichuan province, in China's southwest. 
</P>
<P>
Wolong is one of six panda reserves, holding about 400 of the world's estimated 
1,500 pandas living in the wild -- all in China. 
</P>
<P>
Western scientists had cheered the speedier regeneration of bamboo forests as 
spelling salvation for the pandas. 
</P>
<P>
But Pan Wenshi of Beijing University, one of the world's foremost authorities 
on pandas, said the animals were never in danger of starving. 
</P>
<P>
"There has never been a bamboo shortage for the pandas," Pan said. "Even if one 
species flowered and died, the pandas always had plenty of other species they 
could eat. 
</P>
<P>
"The development of the speedier bamboo growth process was a waste of time and 
effort," the biologist said. 
</P>
<P>
An official of the Forestry Ministry, responsible for protecting pandas, said 
he believed the animals would have to migrate to find food when an entire grove 
of bamboo died. 
</P>
<P>
"But I do not think the food situation is dire," the official said. He could 
not comment on the newly discovered bamboo growing process. 
</P>
<P>
Pan said that not only was the new process unnecessary to the pandas' survival, 
it went against nature. 
</P>
<P>
"When a bamboo forest dies, other plants can grow in their stead. That is the 
natural way, the way it should be." 
</P>
<P>
Pandas, which in prehistoric times ranged virtually across China from Beijing 
to China's extreme south, have shrunk in numbers at the approach of man. 
</P>
<P>
"Man is crowding the pandas out," said the Forestry Ministry official. The 
pandas' main sanctuary, Sichuan, is China's most populous province, with 100 
million people. 
</P>
<P>
Even under optimum conditions, the animals have an uphill battle to survive. 
Their life span is only 12 years, and their reproductive period is brief. 
Zoologists say a giant panda couple produce on average only 0.6 offspring. 
</P>
<P>
Poaching and pollution have taken their toll on the bear-like black-and-white 
creatures. 
</P>
<P>
But Pan contends that the biggest enemy of the panda, worse than man, is 
inbreeding. There are only small concentrations of pandas in each of the six 
reserves, and even smaller numbers are of breeding age. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing a very small gene pool, with weak panda babies being born -- many 
of whom eventually die," Pan said. 
</P>
<P>
Pan and other researchers want to try to move male pandas around from one 
region to another to widen the gene pool and ensure stronger panda offspring. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't do anything, at this rate there could be no more pandas in another 
30 years," he said.

STRIKES LAID TO OUTGOING SANDINISTAS; 
</P>
<P>
NICARAGUA: DAYS BEFORE CHAMORRO IS TO TAKE POWER, MAIL, PHONE AND BANKING 
SERVICES ARE IN DISARRAY. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With just four days remaining before the new government of Violeta Barrios de 
Chamorro is scheduled to take office, the outgoing Sandinista government 
appears to be orchestrating a series of strikes that may threaten Chamorro's 
ability to assert her government's authority. 
</P>
<P>
The strikes, which Sandinista leaders say are intended to ensure the 
demobilization of Contra rebels as scheduled, have halted mail service and 
crippled international telephone service. Friday, they shut down the nation's 
banking system. Sandinista activists also have threatened to disrupt 
electricity, water and health services. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, the Sandinista government has granted workers' demands for hefty 
wage increases, saddling Chamorro's incoming conservative government with 
sharply higher expenses at a time when inflation already is rampant. For 
example, President Daniel Ortega last week doubled the salaries of water 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the Sandinistas have threatened to make the nation "ungovernable" 
if they ever lost their grip on power. By the current campaign of labor unrest, 
they seem to be flexing their muscles in a last-minute reminder to the Chamorro 
government that they remain a force to be reckoned with. 
</P>
<P>
But the government is not directing the strikes, according to Cesar Jerez, 
director of the Jesuit-run Central American University in Managua, who has good 
relations with Sandinista leaders. Jerez described the strikes as the work of 
individual labor groups tied to the government. "Everybody's trying to avoid a 
deterioration of the situation, but there are things that are not in control," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Sandinistas have attributed the labor unrest in part to workers trying to 
win higher salaries before the new government takes office, and Ortega has 
issued calls for restraint. "These struggles are just, but the problem can't be 
solved overnight," Ortega said. 
</P>
<P>
However, in a speech Friday night, Interior Minister Tomas Borge, one of the 
nine members of the ruling Sandinista National Directorate, called the strikes 
"a form of pressure (on the Contras) so they comply with their commitments." 
</P>
<P>
Other Sandinista leaders, such as Damaso Vargas, vice secretary of the 
Sandinista Workers Central, the main Sandinista labor group, have acknowledged 
that the strikes are centrally controlled with the dual purpose of securing 
large wage increases and making sure that the Contras are neutralized as a 
fighting force. 
</P>
<P>
"We can paralyze the country in a matter of minutes, and that should be 
understood by the new government," said Vargas, who warned in an interview that 
the strikes could continue until June 10, when the Contras are scheduled to 
complete the process of surrendering their weapons. 
</P>
<P>
In an agreement signed Thursday, the U.S.-backed Contras promised to begin 
giving up their arms April 25. High-ranking Sandinista officials and labor 
leaders have said they do not trust the rebels to comply with the accord, and 
the current round of strikes appears designed to force Chamorro's government to 
see that the Contras are disbanded by June 10. 
</P>
<P>
Beset by runaway inflation, a plummeting currency and the unemployment of about 
a third of the work force, Nicaragua's economy is already in terrible 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush has lifted the five-year-old trade embargo against Nicaragua and 
pledged a $300-million aid package to help the new government. Chamorro's 
economic team has prepared steps designed to reinvigorate the nation's economy.

POLITICIANS GET DIRECT LINE TO SUPPORTERS

For $2 a minute, anyone with a phone can hear a "Beat Helms" message sponsored 
by a critic of Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
For $12.50 a month, anyone with a bank account can support Helms and other 
Senate Republicans by allowing automatic deductions from their bank books. 
</P>
<P>
In the competition for campaign cash, candidates and political groups are 
trying out new fund-raising gimmicks and dusting off reliable old ones. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets intense out there when everyone is asking, so sometimes being 
different works," said Michelle Davis, executive director of the Republican 
Governors Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Davis describes the traditional fund-raiser like this: "You dress up, you go to 
a dinner, you listen to people give speeches, you write your check and you go 
home." 
</P>
<P>
The big money in politics still comes from these big-name fund-raising dinners 
and from the huge "soft money" contributions that corporations and labor unions 
make to party organizations. 
</P>
<P>
But some of the newest fund-raising methods rely on high-tech gimmicks such as 
900-number telephone lines and electronic fund transfers that allow fast and 
easy access to contributors' bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican governors' group, meanwhile, is adding a little glitz but 
sticking to basics as it tries to offer contributors more than a chicken dinner 
for their checks. The group is holding smaller, more intimate sessions at which 
donors can chat with governors and other prominent Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to do more than we have in the past -- to add a little cachet," Davis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which helps elect Democrats to 
the House, this year added the Preakness to the lineup of big sporting events 
for which it offers tickets in exchange for contributions. Super Bowl parties 
long have been fund-raising favorites. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, hard pressed for cash, also is raising more money than ever from 
Democratic incumbents who have cash to spare in their huge campaign war chests. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-Helms effort, sponsored by a North Carolina State University 
professor, is but one example of the growing popularity of 900 phone lines as a 
political tool. The National Rifle Assn. started the trend a year ago and 
quickly raised $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Hance, defeated in the Texas GOP gubernatorial primary this month, charged 
$3.95 a call for a message from his anti-tax group. The campaign pocketed $2 a 
call. 
</P>
<P>
The Helms and Hance phone lines come cheap when compared to the two 900 lines 
set up by Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, the Senate's 1989 fund-raising 
king. The senator charged $25 and $50 for two 900 lines that gave callers 
recorded voter registration information and details about a fund-raiser Gramm 
was holding with President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Election Commission has looked at a number of legal questions 
related to political use of 900 lines, which critics say can easily be used to 
avoid or bend contribution limits. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats also are raising questions about the National Republican Senatorial 
Committee's "Candidate Escrow Funding" program -- the $12.50 a month 
direct-deposit gimmick. Participants get a $25 check in exchange for 
authorizing monthly bank debits that will increase 10% a year. 
</P>
<P>
"Leave it to the Republicans to figure another way to con you," Texas 
Democratic Chairman Bob Slagle said of the GOP effort. 
</P>
<P>
The Republicans have revised the fund-raising letter that goes with the $25 
check to make it clearer that people will pay out more than that in the long 
run and have set up a toll-free telephone line to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
Some more traditional fund-raising gambits also still stir controversy from 
time to time, such as mailings that cash in on someone's name without their 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
Some 200,000 letters mailed out by "Friends of Dan Quayle" late last year 
sought contributions to support the conservative agenda, yet Quayle had nothing 
to do with the mailing and gets none of the money.

'MAD COW DISEASE' KILLS 10,000 CATTLE IN BRITAIN; 
</P>
<P>
LIVESTOCK: THE GOVERNMENT SEES ONLY A REMOTE RISK TO HUMANS. THE MALADY MAY BE 
SPREAD THROUGH CATTLE FEED.

<P>
"Mad cow disease" has killed 10,000 cattle, restricted the export market for 
Britain's cattle industry and raised fears about the safety of eating beef. 
</P>
<P>
The government insists that the disease poses only a remote risk to human 
health, but scientists still aren't certain what causes the disease or how it 
is transmitted. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone agrees that the risks are low," says Martin Raff, a 
neurobiologist at University College, London. "But they certainly are not zero. 
I have not changed my eating habits, but I certainly do wonder." 
</P>
<P>
Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, was diagnosed 
only in 1986. The symptoms are very much like scrapie, a sheep disease which 
has been in Britain since the 1700s. The incurable disease eats holes in the 
brains of its victims; in late stages a sick animal may act skittish or stagger 
drunkenly. 
</P>
<P>
The suspicion is that the disease was transmitted through cattle feed, which 
used to contain sheep by-products as a protein supplement. 
</P>
<P>
The government banned the use of sheep offal in cattle feed in June, 1988, and 
later banned the use of cattle brain, spleen, thymus, intestines and spinal 
cord in food for humans. Sheep offal is still used in pig and poultry feed. 
</P>
<P>
In March, the government announced that it would pay farmers 100% of market 
value or average market price, whichever is less, for each animal diagnosed 
with BSE. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is a recognition -- not just of pressure from farmers -- but that 
the public would feel more confident that no BSE-infected animal would ever be 
likely to go anywhere near the food chain if there was 100% compensation," said 
Sir Simon Gourlay, president of the National Farmers Union. 
</P>
<P>
The disease struck one of his own cows, Gourlay said. "In the course of 24 
hours, the animal went from being ostensibly quite normal to very vicious and 
totally disoriented." 
</P>
<P>
As of Feb. 9, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that 9,998 
cattle have been destroyed after being diagnosed with BSE. 
</P>
<P>
The government has paid $6.1 million in compensation, and is budgeting $16 
million for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Ireland's Department of Agriculture and Food said about 20 cases have been 
confirmed there, all of them near the border with the British province of 
Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the disease, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service in July banned imports of cattle, embryos and bull 
semen from Britain, said Margaret Webb, a USDA spokeswoman in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Similar embargoes have been imposed by Australia, Finland, Israel, Sweden, West 
Germany and New Zealand, according to the Agriculture Ministry, and the 
European Community has proposed a ban on exports of British cattle older than 6 
months. 
</P>
<P>
David Maclean, a junior agriculture minister, has complained of "BSE hysteria" 
in the media and has insisted that the risk of the disease passing to humans is 
"remote." 
</P>
<P>
The government has committed $19 million to finding the cause of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
A commission chaired by Sir Richard Southwood, a professor at Oxford 
University, reported last year that the cause of BSE "is quite unlike any 
bacteria or known viruses." 
</P>
<P>
The report said the disease is impossible to detect in apparently healthy 
animals because it does not prompt the immune system to produce antibodies. 
</P>
<P>
The Southwood report said it is "most unlikely" that the disease poses a threat 
to humans. But the report added: "If our assessments of these likelihoods are 
incorrect, the implications would be extremely serious." 
</P>
<P>
There is a human variant of spongiform encephalopathy, known as 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. About two dozen cases were reported in Britain last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Another form, known as kuru, had been found in cannibals in New Guinea. 
</P>
<P>
According to a report in the British Medical Journal, the incidence of 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is no higher in Britain than it is in countries free 
of scrapie. 
</P>
<P>
"It is urgent that the same reassurance can be given about the lack of effect 
of BSE on human health," a consultative committee reported to the Agriculture 
Ministry. The committee's report, released early this year, said it is only a 
"shrewd guess" that BSE is transmitted through sheep offal in cattle feed.

CAJUN, CREOLE CULTURES BLEND AT SIMI FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Simi Valley park took on overtones of the Louisiana Bayou country Saturday as 
hundreds gathered for an all-day party that resembled a huge Cajun and Creole 
family reunion. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd dined on barbecued alligator tail and boiled crawfish, sported Mardi 
Gras masks and listened to bands composed of fiddlers, accordionists, harmonica 
players and washboard thumpers. 
</P>
<P>
The first Bayou Simi Cajun/Creole Cultural Festival at Strathearn Park, a 
fund-raiser for Polio Plus sponsored by the Simi Valley Sunrise Rotary Club, 
was pronounced a success by organizers. 
</P>
<P>
About 30,000 to 40,000 people in Southern California have Cajun and Creole 
backgrounds, said Rotarian Bobby Weiszmann. "It's a hidden culture that no one 
seems to know about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine Manuel DeLille, a fifth-generation Creole who lives in Los Angeles, 
gave some background about the culture. 
</P>
<P>
"Cajuns were brought to Louisiana originally on ships" from the French colony 
of Acadia in Canada. "They're born and reared in the swamp areas, and are 
mostly Caucasian . . . Creoles are a mixture of Spanish, French and black. 
They're born and reared in the city -- New Orleans," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Both groups are very friendly, very family oriented and almost all events focus 
on food and music, DeLille said. 
</P>
<P>
Cajun and Creole food such as gumbo, boudin and pralines were sold at about 
half of the 16 booths throughout the park and devoured at picnic tables, on top 
of bales of hay and on the grass. 
</P>
<P>
Booths not selling refreshments displayed handicrafts and T-shirts with a 
Cajun/Creole motif. At one table, Mardi Gras masks were featured, another had 
necklaces with tiny crab charms, while a third sold stuffed animals and dolls. 
</P>
<P>
Those who weren't eating or buying were usually dancing. Four bands played 
throughout the day, from noon to 8 p.m., all performing zydeco or Cajun music. 
</P>
<P>
Cajun music is more folk-oriented, while zydeco music has a faster beat and has 
more of a blues influence, said Pat Harrison, 33, of Santa Monica. She has no 
Cajun or Creole background but said she enjoys attending many of the 
Cajun/Creole festivals in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
"You see a lot of familiar faces at these things," she said. "There are a 
surprising amount of transplants here." 
</P>
<P>
The Simi Valley festival was smaller and "much more homey" than most, Harrison 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Other highlights of the festival included a gumbo cook-off and a zydeco dance 
contest. A children's Mardi Gras parade and Cajun dancing lessons were also 
offered. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to raise $5,000," said Weiszmann, one of the festival's organizers. 
"We hope to do it every year."

AIR POLLUTION HAS COUNTY BREATHING UNEASILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County's air, deceptively clear and often brilliantly blue, is the 
county's top environmental problem 20 years after the nation's first Earth Day. 
</P>
<P>
County officials cite air pollution in the county, which exceeds federal and 
state ozone standards by about 50%, as a primary concern because of its 
potentially ruinous repercussions for people, business and industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Air is something we all need," said Thomas Berg, director of the county's 
Resource Management Agency, which oversees the county's air pollution control 
and environmental health departments. "It is something that affects each and 
every one of us personally." 
</P>
<P>
Smog, mostly caused by exhaust from cars, trucks and generators, not only 
causes health problems, but also hurts Ventura County agriculture, the county's 
largest industry. Harmful gases in the air, primarily ozone, reduce crop 
yields, studies have shown. 
</P>
<P>
The picture has improved in the past 20 years, partly because of creation of a 
local Air Pollution Control District and passage of the California Clean Air 
Act, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have reduced the number of days we exceed the standards by around half," 
said Richard Baldwin, county air pollution control officer. "But we still 
exceed the standard about 50 days a year, and that's still severe." 
</P>
<P>
Officials expect the air to continue to improve, at least until 1995. At that 
time, the county's Air Quality Management Plan predicts, improvements in air 
quality will be counteracted by the increasing population of the county. 
</P>
<P>
But Baldwin puts his faith in regulations from his district that will require 
reductions in cars on the roads and emissions from industry, as well as new 
alternative fuels and other technology to keep the county's air improving and 
breathable in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to air pollution, contamination of the county's surface- and 
ground-water supplies is another major environmental concern for county and 
federal officials on the 20th anniversary of Earth Day. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the county's waterways as well as Mugu Lagoon at the ocean's edge are 
contaminated at levels considered high enough to impair animal habitats, 
according to a State Water Resources Control Board report. 
</P>
<P>
The same report showed that the Calleguas Creek and Revolon Slough as well as 
Mugu Lagoon, one of the county's largest wetlands areas, were contaminated with 
pesticides from agricultural field runoff. Those levels of contaminants, 
including the now-banned DDT, are considered unsafe for wildlife and in 
drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
Seawater also has seeped into the county's freshwater pools deep beneath the 
ground. That intrusion, which was discovered only last year, could jeopardize a 
major long-term drinking water source for the county. 
</P>
<P>
The seawater intrusion is the result of decades of growers and cities pumping 
more water from the ground than was replenished through rain and runoff each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the level of nitrates in eight wells in the unincorporated El Rio 
area now exceed health standards, said Donald Koepp, director of the county 
Environmental Health Division. The nitrates come predominantly from fertilizers 
on agricultural fields, Koepp said, but some contamination also comes from 
leaky septic tanks. 
</P>
<P>
The state is considering for the first time setting limits on the kind and 
amount of runoff that growers and municipalities can allow to flow into storm 
drains and down flood control channels such as the Revolon Slough and the 
Calleguas Creek, Koepp said. 
</P>
<P>
On land, according to officials, the county faces problems of vanishing 
wetlands and the subsequent effect on endangered and threatened species. 
</P>
<P>
"Wetlands and riparian habitats along stream beds are the most productive 
habitats in the world with the greatest diversity of species," said John 
Hanlon, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife biologist who monitors the Ventura County 
area. "Those are two critical habitats we're losing now in Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
Development along river banks, operations to remove rock and gravel, and 
channeling creeks and rivers to straighten them or reduce the possibility of 
flooding during storms are the major causes for destruction of the habitats, 
Hanlon said. 
</P>
<P>
Destruction of those habitats and other wildlife areas in Ventura County has 
endangered seven species, including the California condor, the peregrine 
falcon, the brown pelican and the California least tern. The island night 
lizard also is threatened, Hanlon said. 
</P>
<P>
Another concern is that the county's landfills are filling up. Once they were 
set up anywhere, such as the old Fillmore city dump where residents could burn 
their trash in the bed of the Santa Clara River in Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
The county must have a new landfill and is now in the process of finding a 
suitable site, Berg said. But the real answer lies in reducing the amount of 
waste produced by county residents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a county of 650,000 people who produce a million tons of garbage each 
year," Berg said. "That is as many as 10 times the waste produced by some 
developing countries." 
</P>
<P>
New legislation that mandates a 50% reduction in waste by the year 2000 may 
save the county from disaster, Berg said. The city of Ventura, for instance, is 
well on its way to that goal with a curbside recycling program and plans for a 
new building in which waste will be separated for recycling. 
</P>
<P>
The people who pour into Ventura County and Southern California may prove to be 
the ultimate environmental problem, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The population of Southern California, excluding San Diego County, will 
increase from 13 million to 18 million by the year 2000, projections say. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County's population is expected to reach 900,000 by that year. County 
plans to control development and cities' agreements to leave open space are 
designed to hold the area's population to that level, Berg said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the environmental problems Ventura County faces, Berg, Baldwin and 
Koepp said the county has the means to control and possibly reverse its 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been thinking and working on these issues since the first Earth Day in 
the '70s," Berg said.

CLEANING UP AFTER ENVIRONMENTAL PARTY;

They also serve who stoop to gather Earth Day litter. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Earth Day litter. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Ventura drew thousands to the beach by Channel Islands National 
Park Saturday with its Earth Day and Land By The Sea Fair -- a cheerful, 
well-mannered mob of people. 
</P>
<P>
But it took a small mob of volunteers and public employees to clean up the mess 
that was made while celebrating the natural environment. 
</P>
<P>
"We got here about 6:30 a.m.," said Terri Kirby, a state employee who brought 
15 young California Conservation Corps workers from Camarillo to help set up 
the event and clean up afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Kirby spoke at about 1:30 p.m. There wasn't a lot for the cleanup patrol to do 
then, but there were a pair of discarded yellow napkins on the ground near the 
food line where she stood. She collected them and tossed them in a nearby trash 
can. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would be dirtier than this," said Conservation Corps worker John 
Creighton. "But people have been picking up cans . . . I guess that's what it's 
all about, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
Some of the city's Earth Day guests, however, forgot. 
</P>
<P>
At 10:30 a.m., for instance, a man in gray jeans rose to leave the beach stage 
area, remembering to bring a free sapling he was given at the telephone book 
recycling truck -- and forgetting the inch-long Marlboro butt he left in the 
sand. 
</P>
<P>
At 11 a.m., a happy family dashed down the sidewalk outside the Channel Islands 
Visitor Center, heading in the direction of the "Mr. Clean" boat display -- and 
leaving behind a full Winchell's takeout tray, complete with three Styrofoam 
cups, a few crumpled napkins and half a dozen donuts. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Cohen, a city recreation supervisor and organizer of the day's events, had 
never doubted that such episodes would happen, even at an Earth Day party. In 
the weeks before the event, Cohen said, the city restricted the materials that 
the exhibitors were allowed to distribute, arranged to set up a temporary 
recycling center for cans and bottles and assembled a team of volunteers -- 
drawing heavily on local high schools -- to help in the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen extra trash cans were added to the usual six or so in the area, and 
port district and National Park Service maintenance crews were scheduled to 
make mid-day "loops" through the site to keep trash cans from overflowing. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 18 people here ready to clean up, but there's nothing to clean up," 
said Cohen at about 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
But then the concluding concert by guitarist Larry Carlton ended and the human 
tide receded from the beach to the parking lots. Plenty was left behind in the 
sand: a Budweiser bottle (even though festival organizers sold no alcohol), a 
Snickers wrapper near the T-shirt stand, a "Save California Wildlife" bumper 
sticker, a plastic lunch bag and a few cigarette butts. 
</P>
<P>
The droppings made for interesting speculation: Which Earth Day patron did 
this? And was he or she wearing a politically correct T-shirt at the time? 
</P>
<P>
Officials reported a nearly flawless day, otherwise. The sun shone, traffic 
backed up a bit but generally ran smoothly, and the headlining band finished 
only half an hour later than scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing. Real quiet. Nice family day," said Ventura Police Officer Hiram 
Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say it's very successful, in terms of the numbers . . . and the interest 
of the people," said Bill Noak, a member of Citizens to Preserve the Ojai, who 
was doing a brisk business in environment-oriented books. 
</P>
<P>
"I bet we're easily over 10,000," said Cohen, estimating total attendance over 
the course of the day. "Probably closer to 15,000." 
</P>
<P>
Rangers at the Channel Islands National Park visitor center counted more than 
1,000 visitors between 10 a.m. and noon. 
</P>
<P>
The day's dozens of exhibitors ran the gamut. Beyond War was there, as was the 
Channel Coast Natural History Assn. and the Southwestern Herpetological 
Society, whose members entertained passing onlookers with snakes. 
</P>
<P>
The Green party, which counts about 75 dues-paying members in Ventura County, 
had a booth, and so did Clean Seas, a nonprofit corporation funded by a 
consortium of major oil companies to clean up spills and represent the 
petroleum industry at events such as this one. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Barbara, where an oil spill inspired the first Earth Day 20 years ago, 
organizers blocked oil companies from appearing at this year's Earth Day 
festivities. Ventura did not, Cohen said, because its Earth Day and Land By the 
Sea Fair celebration is aimed at both environmental and energy education. 
</P>
<P>
"We kind of fall into a different category," Cohen said. "So the oil interests 
are here. You have to work with those people." 
</P>
<P>
At the Clean Seas exhibit, Clean Seas equipment operators Bill Jones and Kent 
Creighton were demonstrating oil-spill cleanup techniques with a foil tray of 
water, a quart of 40-weight motor oil and a pinch of transmission fluid. Once 
the oil was in the water, they dropped in specially designed white pads, which 
absorbed the petroleum products but not the water. 
</P>
<P>
"That's sick," said 8-year-old Rachel Cirricione, of the spill and cleanup 
display. 
</P>
<P>
"But you gotta do it," said Bill Jones, dropping in a white pad. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, Bill," said Creighton after the little girl had gone. "We need to put one 
of those ducks in here, and some fish. More realistic."

THE DROUGHT FARMING; 
</P>
<P>
PLAN TO SELL CREEK WATER UPSETS USERS DOWNSTREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The city of Thousand Oaks is headed for a possible legal battle over a plan 
that would put an end to a practice of providing some local farmers with free 
water for irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
Every year the city pours about 13,000 acre-feet of treated sewer water into 
the Conejo Creek, which winds through the Santa Rosa Valley, meets the 
Calleguas Creek, flows down to Mugu Lagoon and out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers downstream depend on the water, which they have been using for free on 
their crops in their fields east of Camarillo since the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
But that could end. 
</P>
<P>
Caught in one of the worst droughts in memory in Ventura County, the city has 
devised a plan to pump the water out of the creek and sell it to the farmers 
located miles away on the parched Oxnard Plain. 
</P>
<P>
The scheme has sparked heated criticism from some growers along the creek, 
praise from farmers farther away and could end up being argued over for months 
in state offices and courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks has applied to the state for rights to water in the creek. 
Opponents have until May 15 to file objections with the state Water Resources 
Control Board. A hearing on the issue will then be scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
John Lamb -- a descendant of Juan Camarillo, who first farmed the area more 
than a century ago -- is vowing to put up a hefty fight, possibly in court. 
Without the water, his family's farm, passed down for generations, could be in 
peril, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They're born-again reclamationists," John Lamb said of Thousand Oaks 
officials. "The city has been throwing the water away for all these years and 
now they see an opportunity to make a buck. 
</P>
<P>
"They're jumping on the drought bandwagon. We're saying, 'Wait a minute, we're 
the guys in the white hats.' " 
</P>
<P>
Lamb said his family has been using the water for 15 years and has spent 
$200,000 on pumps and crossings. The water, after all, is cutting through their 
land, he said. Over the years it has carved a 20-foot trench and caused a dirt 
farm road to slowly deteriorate. Plant life -- including a nearly impossible to 
kill bamboo-like plant called arundo -- abounds in the riverbed, making it 
difficult to cross the creek in some places. 
</P>
<P>
Since the water was there, the Lambs felt they had the right to use it. 
</P>
<P>
But Thousand Oaks officials see it another way. 
</P>
<P>
Don Nelson, the utility director of Thousand Oaks, is fond of a saying that 
Mark Twain coined back in the rough-and-tumble days of California's early 
settlers. 
</P>
<P>
"Whiskey is to drink," he said, with a grin. "Water is to fight over." 
</P>
<P>
If not for the city's treated sewer water, the creek through the Santa Rosa 
Valley east of Camarillo would run dry -- forcing farmers to find other sources 
of water anyway, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the water could be better used on the Oxnard Plain where 
farmers are the hardest hit by the drought. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks' plan could alleviate some of the county's water problems, Nelson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at this from a larger view," Nelson said. "But we can't 
accommodate everyone." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the farmers along the riverbed would have to purchase all their 
water from local water districts, he said. The growers already are purchasing 
some of their water from the Camrosa County Water District. But they say it is 
costly: about $215 per acre-foot. 
</P>
<P>
John Lamb's father, Robert, said about 60% of the water his family uses is from 
the creek, and they barely can afford to replace it with the Camrosa water 
because the farm is not always profitable. "We've made money on this ranch two 
out of the last 10 years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is asking the state for the right to use some of the water. But the 
Lamb family faces an uphill battle, said Dave Cornelius, a senior engineer in 
the state Division of Water Rights. 
</P>
<P>
"Thousand Oaks applied first," Cornelius said. "First in line, first in right." 
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1980s, Thousand Oaks has been considering gaining rights to the 
water. Normally, cities automatically own the water in their sewage treatment 
plants, Nelson said. But since Thousand Oaks is pouring the water into the 
creek, it is part of the public domain, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone told us that we couldn't gain the rights to the water because it had 
never been done before," Nelson said. But city officials wanted to try. 
</P>
<P>
Officials met with the general manager of the Pleasant Valley County Water 
District to formulate a plan. 
</P>
<P>
According to Le Roy Miller, the general manger of the water district, Pleasant 
Valley wants to build a pump station on the creek just south of the Ventura 
Freeway at the bottom of the Conejo Grade. 
</P>
<P>
The company will then blend the water with ground water and send it through a 
pipeline to about 35 ranchers on the plain. Miller said they still have not 
decided how much they will pay Thousand Oaks for the water, but it will 
probably cost about $40 per acre-foot. One acre-foot equals 325,851 gallons of 
water, enough for a family of four to live on for an entire year. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about a lot of water," Miller said. "We need it now. We needed 
it yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
Miller said they have depleted reservoirs "down to the mud" several times, 
forcing the district to ration water. 
</P>
<P>
Rancher Tom Vujovich said his crops are running dry, and he's "very, very 
worried and concerned." 
</P>
<P>
"We're just trying to do our best and hoping next summer we'll have the water," 
Vujovich said. "We really think we've got a great project here. It's going to 
be a great help to the county." 
</P>
<P>
But it is not going to be cheap, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
To get the water from the creek to the farms is going to cost the district 
between $6 million and $7 million. As a result, the district will have to 
increase the price of the water from $55 per acre-foot to about $120 per 
acre-foot to finance the improvements, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the district would prefer to pump the water directly from the sewer 
plant, located off Hill Canyon Road in the Santa Rosa Valley. But to do so 
could cost millions more, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the district wants to leave the water in the creek that cuts 
through half a dozen farms -- including the Lamb family's -- upstream. But, 
Miller said, they have no intention of selling the water to the farmers because 
expensive equipment would be required to monitor the flow. 
</P>
<P>
The farmers in the area are using about 1,800 acre-feet a year, far more than 
the district can afford to give away, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, someone is going to lose. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the conflict between the city and the farmers, Ventura County officials 
strongly support the plan as a crucial alternative to the water crisis. 
</P>
<P>
And Simi Valley officials are considering doing the same with their treated 
sewer water. On Monday night, the City Council will vote on whether to spend 
$30,000 to study the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks' proposal is "the best thing since sliced bread," said Jerry 
Nowak, the deputy director of the county's public works department. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now most of the water is being lost to the ocean," Nowak said. "We're in 
a drought situation, and we need every drop we can get."

VENTURA WEST MARINA PRAISED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to your article (April 15) on the slip rental rate increase 
proposed in Ventura Harbor, I would like to clarify a statement in which I was 
represented as saying maintenance is marginal in Ventura West Marina and the 
facilities are not well-maintained. 
</P>
<P>
As an owner of a yacht brokerage in Ventura Harbor, I am acutely aware of the 
costs involved in maintaining facilities in a harbor environment. 
</P>
<P>
As a Ventura West Slip renter and a live-aboard, while I am not all that 
excited by the prospect of a rate increase I consider Ventura West Marina as 
one of the finest live-aboard marinas in the area. 
</P>
<P>
In no way did I imply the facilities at Ventura West Marina are inadequate or 
not well-maintained. In fact, I stated that my wish is to see these additional 
fees used to increase and improve the facilities for the boaters. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, while no one enjoys paying additional housing costs or slip rental 
fees, a 5% increase is probably not out of line considering the rise in 
property values in the Ventura Harbor area. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, I am more concerned about "marginal" journalism, or attempts to 
tailor controversy for a slant in a news story, than a slight monthly increase 
in my cost of living.

SCHOOL LIBRARIES A BASIC NEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent financial problems of the Simi Valley Unified School District have 
exposed one of the weakest links in our educational system, particularly here 
in California: school libraries. 
</P>
<P>
We hear of one horror story after another about the educational inadequacies of 
our population. Most experts seem to agree that an emphasis on reading is 
needed. Yet school libraries, an obvious reading resource, continue to exist 
(or sometimes not exist) on inadequate funding for both books and personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Simi district proposes severe cutbacks for school libraries. The cry 
"back to basics" is often heard. What could be more basic than books for the 
students to read?

GARAGES DRAINED OF GROUT, OIL IN TOXICS ROUNDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The day before Earth Day, the garages of Los Angeles emptied out their house 
paint, batteries, crankcase oil, insecticide, rug shampoo, model airplane 
paint, tile and grout sealer, and snail and slug killer for a household 
hazardous-waste roundup at the Unocal refinery in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
"Even got some low-fat yogurt," said Unocal environmental specialist John Van 
Kooy, peering at a heap of containers in the refinery's parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"It's peach," he reported after a close examination. 
</P>
<P>
The event drew an estimated 1,200 cars in six hours. 
</P>
<P>
For much of the time, a slow-moving, half-mile-long line of traffic snaked west 
of the parking lot as people from as far away as the San Fernando Valley waited 
to get rid of their waste. 
</P>
<P>
David Henth, 23, brought a trailer loaded with 600 gallons of paint all the way 
from Granada Hills. He had acquired the paint, contained in fragile, rusty 
pails, as part of the purchase of a house that needed fixing up. 
</P>
<P>
Attendants in white safety suits told him to pull around for unloading. 
</P>
<P>
But for most people, who had more modest hauls, the removal took place with the 
efficiency of a fast-food operation. 
</P>
<P>
David Broadbent, 39, an environmental consultant who lives in Lomita, sat in 
his 1979 Triumph TR-7 convertible as an attendant relieved him of a single 
automobile battery. 
</P>
<P>
"Now you can go to the beach," the man said to Broadbent. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to go back and paint my house," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
The cleanup was co-sponsored by the Los Angeles Department of Public Works, 
Standard Brands Paints, Western Waste Industries, Union Pacific Corp.'s 
subsidiary USPCI, WH Tank Lines and McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
Although a similar roundup in Granada Hills last August drew about twice as 
many cars, officials said the Unocal event attracted more business than they 
could handle and pronounced it a success. 
</P>
<P>
"There ought to be more of them," declared Richard Stegemeier, president, 
chairman and chief executive officer of Unocal Corp. Stegemeier said Unocal 
contributed about $150,000 for the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
The old motor oil will be recycled in fuel oil, he said. Standard Brands will 
recycle the paint. Insecticides will be treated to eliminate toxicity before 
disposal.

MYERS IS WELCOME ADDITION TO REDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM VERDUCCI, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CINCINNATI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Randy Myers was traded for the Reds' John Franco, Mets executives noted 
that one of their intentions was to improve team chemistry. They thought Myers 
was more interested in weight lifting than the good of the team. That view 
seems especially ironic after what Myers has become here in less than two weeks 
of the season: a popular player in the clubhouse who is giving the bullpen -- 
if not the entire club -- a new identity. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds are amused, and some of them encouraged, by Myers' macho act, which 
includes camouflage gear, plastic grenades and Soldier of Fortune magazine. He 
has given nicknames to Norm Charlton ("The Genius"), Rob Dibble ("The 
Officer"), himself ("Mr. Mellow") and the entire bullpen ("The Nasty Boys," 
which he said he arrived at after watching Tim Layana throw a nasty 
knuckle-curve) and has instituted a strikeout competition between the starters 
and relievers (his side leads, 37-21). 
</P>
<P>
More important, the Reds are impressed by his tenacity and his pitching, which 
produced one win and three saves in Cincinnati's 7-0 start. 
</P>
<P>
"John Franco is a great pitcher," Charlton said. "But if there were bases 
loaded and John was behind 3-0 on a hitter with a one-run lead, he'd be ice 
cold out there. Randy has a totally different personality. You can see fire 
coming out of his head. 
</P>
<P>
"Randy brings out the best -- or the worst, whatever you want to call it -- in 
Rob and me. All three of us are adrenaline pitchers. We go on a full tank all 
the time." 
</P>
<P>
Myers, who complained in New York that Davey Johnson didn't use him enough, is 
elated to be here because Lou Piniella has promised to use him "short and 
often." He also seems to enjoy being on a team where it is more important to 
have fun than to be cool. You've probably noticed that the Mets have eliminated 
their eccentric types (Wally Backman, Lenny Dykstra, Roger McDowell, Myers) and 
put together more of a vanilla-flavored team. 
</P>
<P>
"If they want to make me the scapegoat, fine, let them go ahead and do it," 
Myers said. "I don't care. I'm not a goody two-shoes. If that's what they 
wanted, that's not me. I'm just not that kind of guy." 
</P>
<P>
The first "Nasty Boys" banner of the season was hung at Riverfront Stadium 
Tuesday. It included the uniform numbers of Myers, Dibble and Charlton. Myers 
was upset that it did not include those of Layana and Tim Birtsas, who also 
have membership in the club. 
</P>
<P>
For all of their shenanigans, these guys provide serious relief. If it is not 
the best bullpen, it certainly is the hardest-throwing one. Myers, Dibble and 
Charlton have fanned 30 of the 77 batters they have faced this year. 
</P>
<P>
After the Padres swept the Giants in San Francisco last weekend, catcher Mark 
Parent was feeling pretty good. "What we did this weekend was send a message to 
the Giants: 'You guys aren't even going to be competing with us this year,"' 
Parent told reporters. "And pretty soon, we'll be sending the same message to 
the Reds." 
</P>
<P>
So what happened Tuesday? Cincinnati beat San Diego, 2-1, in a game in which 
Parent struck out with the tying and winning runs on base in the ninth inning. 
The lesson: It's fine to be confident, but career .184 hitters like Parent have 
no business running their mouths off like that. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds also beat the Padres Wednesday, 11-7. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres and Reds have the makings of a good rivalry. Not only are they the 
premier teams in the division, but their managers don't appear to like each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
Piniella, who played for Padres Manager Jack McKeon in 1973 in Kansas City, 
wrote in his 1986 autobiography that McKeon is "a champion second-guesser. I 
didn't like his manner, his tone of voice, his sarcasm, and the feeling was 
mutual. He didn't like me very much. I just couldn't play for the man." 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, McKeon wrote in his book that Piniella was "the most selfish 
player I've ever seen. In my first spring training, I lectured them every 
morning on baseball. A couple of veterans thought it was a waste, but mainly it 
was Lou Piniella. He's the one who undermined me." 
</P>
<P>
Both tried to douse those fires Tuesday. Piniella said he likes and respects 
McKeon, who said, "We don't have any problems. I'd like to think we can see 
past whatever happened 17, 18 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Carter is having a terrible start with the Padres. Though he expected to 
see more fastballs in the National League, Carter is getting a regular dose of 
breaking pitches, and will until he proves he can hit them. It's bad enough 
that he is not hitting (5-for-32, .156, no homers), but Carter also is giving 
credence to the notion that he is a poor clutch hitter. He has batted with 27 
runners on this year and driven in three of them -- one with a bases-loaded 
walk. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, with the bases loaded and his team down 2-0, he made the mistake of 
not knowing how many outs there were. Carter thought there was one out so he 
jumped at a high, first-pitch fastball. "I said, 'Just drive it. Sacrifice 
fly,"' Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
But in fact his fly ball resulted in the third out of the inning. Carter came 
up with a weak explanation for his mistake. He blamed it on his transition to 
the National League. He said he is not accustomed to the whereabouts of 
National League scoreboards. 
</P>
<P>
Friday the 13th turned out to be a scary night for McDowell, who wears No. 13 
for the Phillies. In one-third of an inning, he gave up three hits, walked two 
batters and permitted six earned runs. And the four players who wear No. 13 who 
batted that night -- Lance Parrish, Alvaro Espinoza, Glenn Wilson and Jose Lind 
-- were a combined 3-for-15. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox, who have Marty Barrett and Lee Smith to trade, had better find 
some starting pitching fast. 
</P>
<P>
The Athletics' Scott Sanderson may turn out to be a fine replacement for Storm 
Davis, who won 19 games for them last year with the generous support of 5.61 
runs per game. In Sanderson's first start, Oakland scored 15 runs for him. The 
Royals provided Davis with one run in his first start, a 3-1 loss. 
</P>
<P>
The umpires didn't have enough time to prepare for the season because of the 
lockout and their strike. Their work, particularly on balls and strikes, has 
been noticeably off. 
</P>
<P>
The right side of the Mets' infield is a danger zone. Gregg Jefferies, while a 
better hitter, hasn't improved his fielding or his ability to cope with 
mistakes. And Mike Marshall is the most awkward first baseman in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Viola, who has regained the pop on his fastball, is going to have a huge 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Don Mattingly appears to have licked his April hitting troubles, which means he 
probably will win the batting title. 
</P>
<P>
John Smoltz is a mystery. He was 11-6 at the break last year and is 1-7 since.

THE EVOLUTION OF YOUNGER ATHLETES IN PROFESSIONAL SPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN DENLINGER, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first professional football player was a 16-year-old high school star 
recruited-for $10-by a YMCA team in western Pennsylvania as an emergency 
fill-in at quarterback. That was in 1895, so the controversy caused by Alabama 
linebacker Keith McCants and about two dozen others pushing their way into the 
NFL draft next Sunday is more about quirks and contradictions than history. 
</P>
<P>
Until Spencer Haywood yelled foul and took the National Basketball Assn. to 
court 19 years ago, only athletes were denied the right to sell their services 
to an employer whenever they chose. The restrictions, though written 
differently, amounted to denial into the major pro basketball and football 
leagues until four years after a player's high school class had graduated. 
</P>
<P>
What evolved as a result of Haywood's victory is a fascinating mix of 
cooperative progress and resistance. 
</P>
<P>
Basketball is moving toward a system that might, in a few years, allow its 
athletes the full flexibility everyone outside sport enjoys. The final gesture 
would be players permitted to apply for the pro draft and welcomed back to 
college, with no loss of eligibility, if that seems the wiser option. 
</P>
<P>
Football is nowhere near such a system. Though undergraduates will be included 
in droves as never before this year, it might not last. The reason is a wage 
scale the NFL might impose before next year's draft that would cause salaries 
for rookies to plummet. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed scale, rookies would sign two one-year contracts for $60,000 
and $70,000. Signing bonuses would start at $500,000 and fall to $100,000 for 
the 28th, and last, first-round pick. These wages still are beyond the 
imagination of most college graduates. But the first pick in last year's draft, 
quarterback Troy Aikman, was given a $2.75 million signing bonus; the figure 
for the player chosen last in the second round, or the 54th pick overall, was 
$250,000. 
</P>
<P>
McCants, by seeming out of condition and uncooperative during recent workouts 
for NFL teams, might no longer be the top pick. With that prize, gained by 
having the worst record in the league last season, the Atlanta Falcons say they 
are leaning toward another underclass eligible, quarterback Jeff George. In 
all, at least six of the 22 early entries are expected to be first-round 
selections. 
</P>
<P>
Born into poverty in Mobile, McCants is fond of saying: "I knew there were two 
paths in life and one of them led nowhere." As Spencer Haywood realized at 
about a similar age nearly a generation ago, the shortcut path that leads to 
professional sports is anything but uncluttered. 
</P>
<P>
The early-entry process in the NBA has included a name change and five years of 
amnesia. A recent league publication said: "The 1990 NBA draft will mark the 
15th year that the Early Entry rule for draft eligibility will apply." That 
suggests Phil Chenier and more than two dozen others were jump-shooting and 
rebounding phantoms, because early entries into the NBA started not in 1976 but 
in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
The route through which Chenier and five other Haywood-inspired pioneers sought 
to enter the NBA was called the Hardship Draft. Little wonder many in the 
league cringe and offer selective memory, because at best the earliest early 
entry procedure was an embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
For most other families and nearly every other American business, passage for a 
son from school to life's work is a time for hopeful celebration. Not so for 
the Cheniers of Berkeley. If the most devious thing Phil might do for them was 
steal an opponent's pass every game or so, why were his new employers snooping 
around his neighborhood? 
</P>
<P>
"We never figured out why either," Chenier said the other day in his Columbia, 
Md., home. "But investigators came questioning our neighbors. Supposedly, the 
league was going to refuse players it felt did not qualify as hardship cases." 
</P>
<P>
Quiet intimidation is what it seems on hindsight, because Chenier and the rest 
were about to stir disruption of cozy collusion between colleges and pros that 
Haywood some months earlier had created. 
</P>
<P>
With its restricted-entry rule, the NBA got from the colleges a cost-free 
developmental program, publicity buildup for players and immense goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
What could spoil such bliss? 
</P>
<P>
Competition. 
</P>
<P>
The new American Basketball Assn. figured a way to survival (meaning eventual 
merger with the NBA) was to trash its own restricted-entry rule and admit 
collegians with postgraduate ability. An Olympian the year before and a 
sophomore at Detroit University, Haywood in 1969 was such a player. 
</P>
<P>
"I was making $15 a month in school (allowed under NCAA scholarship rules at 
the time)," Haywood said in his autobiography. "When someone says you can make 
$100,000 a year, you start listening." 
</P>
<P>
How to grab the 19-year-old Haywood and infuriate the colleges as little as 
possible was solved by an agent named Steve Arnold. According to Don Ringsby, a 
former co-owner of the Denver team that chose Haywood during a secret ABA draft 
and signed him: Arnold "came up with the 'hardship' gimmick whereby we could 
plead for a waiver of the (four-year) rule on the basis of financial hardship. 
He knew Spencer came from a poor family in the Deep South. Arnold just invented 
it. It was a gimmick. And Jim Gardner, the president of the ABA, okayed it." 
</P>
<P>
A contract dispute with Denver led Haywood on Dec. 20, 1970, to sign a 
six-year, no-cut deal with the NBA SuperSonics for $1.5 million, to be paid at 
the rate of $100,000 for 15 years. Even though Haywood had been a pro for more 
than a year, NBA Commissioner Walter Kennedy earlier had said no NBA team could 
sign him. Not until June 1971 would it be four years after his high school 
class graduated. 
</P>
<P>
Haywood sued and finally won. The federal district court judge who ruled in his 
favor, Warren J. Ferguson, wrote: "It is uncontested that the rules in question 
are absolute and prohibit the signing of not only college basketball players 
but also those who do not desire to attend college and even those who lack the 
mental and financial ability to do so. As such, they are overly broad and 
improper." 
</P>
<P>
The wailing was both immediate and loud. 
</P>
<P>
NBA Commissioner Kennedy: "This could kill college athletics and seriously 
injure professional athletics." 
</P>
<P>
Northwestern football coach Alex Agase: "This could eliminate all superstars 
from college competition." 
</P>
<P>
Furman basketball coach Joe Williams: "This will take a great deal of incentive 
out of recruiting good players." 
</P>
<P>
The colleges, of course, could have simplified matters-and purified 
themselves-by going back to using student-athletes. Instead, a grudging 
compromise came about in the NBA, the hardship "gimmick" Arnold had devised 
several years earlier for the rival league. Into the uncharted waters came 
Chenier. 
</P>
<P>
"I first thought about it during trials for the 1971 Pan Am Games," he said. 
"I'd befriended (University of Minnesota forward) Ron Behagen, who introduced 
me to two agents from New York. They said a couple of NBA teams were 
interested. I'd just finished my junior year at Cal." 
</P>
<P>
Chenier was frustrated by losing to John Wooden's nonpareil UCLA teams-and when 
a very good transfer to Cal decided to return home to Nebraska, he opted to 
apply to the NBA. Nineteen years later, he said: "I didn't feel I was in a 
hardship situation." 
</P>
<P>
The NBA's investigators very likely agreed. But Chenier, Cyril Baptiste, Joe 
Hammond, Ed Owens, Tom Payne and Nate Williams were part of a supplemental 
draft. Baptiste, Payne, Williams and Chenier were first-round choices, with 
Hammond a fourth-rounder. Owens was not chosen. 
</P>
<P>
"The deal was pretty much secure ahead of time," said Chenier, meaning money. 
Still, he thought the deal was with the Chicago Bulls and was flabbergasted 
when the Bullets drafted him. 
</P>
<P>
Of that six-player class, only Chenier had a long and productive NBA career. 
Chenier has not regretted his decision. The only time he feels even mildly 
guilty is when he talks with his teenage son and daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult for me at this point to say to the kids upstairs (he also 
a daughter in college): 'Hey, school's important. You've got to get your 
degree.' I tell them I made some mistakes. There were certain areas where I did 
not achieve what I could have. But you shouldn't set your goals in accordance 
with someone else's." 
</P>
<P>
Chenier has an associate degree in computer science from Howard Community 
College, where he works in student activities. Also an analyst on Bullets 
telecasts, he hints at possibly trying to make up the 30-some credits he needs 
for a bachelor's degree. 
</P>
<P>
"When I talk with youngsters (exceptional at basketball), I don't want to feel 
hypocritical by saying: 'Oh no. This (NBA) dream can't be met. You can't 
achieve this.' Some can. To cut short one's dream is just as wrong as trying to 
lead somebody down the wrong path." 
</P>
<P>
No one has put the early-entry issue any better, for when to grab for the dream 
is as uncertain as at the dream itself. Over 19 years, the NBA lists 184 
players as having traded college eligibility for a shot at pro riches. 
</P>
<P>
That's not entirely accurate, because the tally includes at least two merry men 
who treated the NBA in the manner of a public-course golfer trying to crack the 
Masters. Not long after being told, about two years apart, that injuries had 
ended low-level college careers for them, Reinhard Schmuck of Baruch and Dick 
Whitmore of Brown applied for the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
Whitmore and a classmate, Arthur Jackson, decided he should petition the NBA as 
a way of understanding how a pro league operates. Both had aspirations of a 
career in sports management. 
</P>
<P>
"I wrote to Commissioner David Stern (last year), but got no response," said 
Whitmore, whose severe knee injury came early in his junior season. "I got no 
response. When I mentioned what I'd done to our sports information director, he 
put it on the (news service) wire." 
</P>
<P>
The barrage of publicity forced the NBA to include the whimsical Whitmore on a 
14-name list of candidates that featured Nick Anderson, Vlade Divac and J.R. 
Reid. That meant that the latest NBA draft also had something odd. 
</P>
<P>
Early entry is old enough so that a sixth-round choice by the Hawks in 1973, 
John Williamson, has a son at LSU who could consider it. An Ivy Leaguer, Brian 
Taylor of Princeton in 1972, scooted to the pros before anyone who played for 
Jerry Tarkanian. One player, Luther "Ticky" Burden of Utah, applied for the 
1974 draft, withdrew, then went through the process again the next year and was 
taken by the Knicks on the second round. 
</P>
<P>
When Schmuck took his Whitmore-like lark in 1987, an NBA official went to the 
trouble of phoning to tell him not to show up for the draft. Schmuck's coach at 
Baruch, Ray Rankis, had applied 13 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they took me too seriously," Rankis said, "because I wrote my 
application in crayon." 
</P>
<P>
Moses Malone showed that a high school player could jump immediately into the 
pros and become wildly successful; Darryl Dawkins and Bill Willoughby showed 
the leap might be too high even for the unusually gifted. 
</P>
<P>
That's subject for debate, because Dawkins was chosen in the first round of the 
1975 draft by the 76ers. Willoughby was a second-round choice, by the Hawks. 
Both made considerable money over decently long careers in the NBA and might 
well have been unsuited for academics beyond high school. 
</P>
<P>
Chenier says: "If you're not going to be a first-round draft choice, it really 
doesn't make a lot of sense to come out. Very few second-rounders get no-cut 
contracts." In the NFL, being selected in the second and third round still is 
honorable. 
</P>
<P>
No significant trends in basketball are obvious. Four of the six players in 
Chenier's class were first-rounders; only one player among the eight who 
applied the second year, Bob McAdoo, went that high. Twenty players applied in 
1974; a total of 15 applied from 1977 through 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"Each step in college basketball for most players is another step forward in 
maturity," said Bullets General Manager Bob Ferry, who drafted Chenier in 1971 
and whose son Danny considered early entry at Duke after the 1989 season. "Some 
players don't belong in college but are forced to be there (because its system 
serves as the best training area for the NBA). 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the experience in college is learning to handle pressure. Part of it 
is learning to handle responsibility. I think a player like Darryl Dawkins 
missed that." 
</P>
<P>
But what about Ralph Sampson? What if, after his sophomore season at Virginia, 
he had listened to Red Auerbach and opted for the pros? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know Ralph Sampson," said Ferry. "But there is a factor with some 
players where they're sheltered and protected to the point where that becomes a 
negative and retards their development as a player." 
</P>
<P>
The NFL has been feeling early-entry pressure since at least 1975, when 
Commissioner Pete Rozelle disapproved the contract between Clarence Rose and 
the Houston Oilers but later changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
Its policy of denial began in 1926, because Red Grange turned pro shortly after 
his final game at Illinois, earned a quick $100,000 in a series of exhibitions 
and angered the colleges. Earlier in the century, many players routinely played 
for their colleges on Saturday and for pro teams the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Like the NBA in its early stages, the NFL until this year mostly used 
supplemental drafts for underclassmen. A second-string Alabama teammate of 
McCants, Danny Cash, jumped after being dismissed from school. A Houston 
linebacker, Lamar Lathon, said he wants to use his money to underwrite drug 
rehabilitation for his sister. 
</P>
<P>
Few who declared early are linemen, the opinion among college and pro personnel 
experts being that it takes more time for larger players to mature. Along with 
lots of other scare stuff over the years, that also might be bunk. All Spencer 
Haywood and years of manipulation guarantees is the right to choose, not the 
inspiration to make the right choice.

BLAIR THOMAS, NOW RECOVERED, THINKS HE MADE RIGHT CHOICE

STATE COLLEGE, Pa.

<TEXT>
<P>
Blair Thomas, who played an extra season of college football to prove he had 
recovered from knee surgery, said Thursday his decision was the best he could 
have made in preparation for the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
The Penn State running back said Thursday that staying in college showed scouts 
that a season on crutches did not affect his play and made him more prominent 
among the thousands hoping for an NFL bid. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in a position a lot of guys would like to be in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Indianapolis is expected to sign Illinois quarterback Jeff George as the 
draft's top pick. Many expect Thomas to go second, to the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't have a preference, but if I could stay in the East, I would 
like to," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Thomas had considered entering the draft, but his knee was untested 
after arthroscopic surgery to reconstruct a ligament in January 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas sat out the 1988 season and returned to play in 1989 after no contract 
drills in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was a good decision in a couple of ways," he said in a telephone 
conference call. "The main reason was I couldn't have finished school, and I 
needed to show people that the knee was fine. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad with the decisions I've made over the years because those decisions 
put me in the position that I am in today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas injured his knee in late 1987 as the Nittany Lions prepared for the 
Citrus Bowl against Clemson. By 1989 he recovered enough to become Penn State's 
second leading rusher. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people have suffered this kind of injury and come back. Curt Warner for 
one," Thomas said. "Midway though the 1988 season, I thought my speed was where 
it had been." 
</P>
<P>
Warner is a former Penn State running back who was a first-round draft pick of 
the Seattle Seahawks in 1983. Thomas rushed for 3,301 yards in his 
regular-season career, 97 short of Warner's total. He added 186 in last year's 
Holiday Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said he last talked to the Jets during a workout camp five weeks ago. 
This month, he said, the only team to contact him was Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to know where I was going to be on draft day," Thomas said. "If 
they wanted to know where I was going to be on draft day, I would assume they 
were going to try to trade up." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said he will be at draft headquarters in New York Sunday. Seattle is 
scheduled to have the eighth and 10th picks in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
He said playing in the West with Seattle would not bother him. 
</P>
<P>
"Anywhere in the top five, I wouldn't mind playing. Eventually I could learn a 
system and produce in that system no matter where it is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If Thomas went to the New York Jets, he would be working with running backs 
Johnny Hector and Freeman McNeil. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen them play over a series of years. They're mature and a little older 
and have a sense of the game," he said. "If I were to go there, I would learn a 
lot from them." he said.

BLUE JAYS MAY BENEFIT FROM MIKE FLANAGAN'S WEALTH OF EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JIM HENNEMAN, BALTIMORE EVENING SUN 
</P>

TORONTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was a time when Mike Flanagan thought he'd spend his entire career with 
the Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
He had succeeded Jim Palmer as the leader of a quality pitching staff. He was 
surrounded by people who were friends, not just teammates. He'd been on 
two-pennant winners and a World Series championship team. He'd won a Cy Young 
Award. And he'd dug up his New England roots and settled his family in 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
But in baseball, change is often inevitable. When he was traded 2 1/2 years ago 
it was a tossup as to who benefitted the most -- Flanagan, for escaping from a 
losing atmosphere; the Orioles, for unloading a hefty salary and making room 
for a younger player; or the Toronto Blue Jays, for bringing a quiet leader 
into a clubhouse noted for turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan's numbers since arriving in Toronto have been no more spectacular than 
they were in his final years in Baltimore. But there is evidence that suggests 
the veteran left-hander's presence has been even more important than his 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays have two young left-handers in their starting rotation: John 
Cerutti, who pitched five scoreless innings in Monday's 4-2 win over the 
Orioles, and Jimmy Key, who will pitch the final game of the series Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to think that I've helped them," said Flanagan. "Just being around as 
long as I have is a factor." 
</P>
<P>
But it goes beyond that. "One thing he did when he came over here was open up 
the line of communication about pitching," said Cerutti. "We (the pitching 
staff) didn't really talk among ourselves that much about pitching. 
</P>
<P>
"Dave Stieb wasn't much of a talker, and Jimmy (Key) was receptive and 
approachable, but he's quiet. Mike is the kind of guy who helped us mentally as 
well as physically when he came over here," said Cerutti. 
</P>
<P>
"Being from New England, I had followed Mike from his days at UMass. When he 
was with the Orioles in the late 1970s and early '80s he was a guy I emulated. 
I thought his style was closest to mine. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great benefit to me, and all of us, when Mike came over here. He'll 
come in after an inning and explain what he was trying to do, what he was 
thinking on certain pitches. And we talk after games all of the time." 
</P>
<P>
Cerutti's first start this year lasted less than an inning, a marked contrast 
to Monday's performance. "He missed with a few sinkers that dropped out of the 
strike zone, and I guess he felt he had to throw harder," said Flanagan. 
</P>
<P>
"The pitches I threw that were hit hard were fastballs up," said Cerutti. "I'm 
better when I'm keeping the ball down, and it's something we talked about 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"He talks with us all the time, and a lot of the things he says are things he 
picked up from Jim Palmer. He's told us how Earl (Weaver) ran the club and how 
open everybody was, how much the pitchers communicated with each other. From 
that standpoint alone, he's had a great impact on the team." 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan makes no attempt to hide the fact that he learned about pitching by 
listening to Palmer, for whom he has almost a reverent respect. He calls 
Palmer's election to the Hall of Fame one of the highlights of his career. He 
brought a bottle of champagne to the press conference the night Palmer's 
election was announced and says that if it is at all possible he will attend 
the induction ceremonies in Cooperstown Aug. 5. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something I really want to do," he said. "It's something I'll never 
experience, and I'd like to see Jim go into the Hall of Fame. I might be able 
to get a day off, and if I do, then I'll be there." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the 38-year-old Flanagan is taking his own career one year at 
a time. "I'll see where we are in September and take it from there," he said, 
aware that the decision likely won't be his. "It probably depends more on how 
the club does than how I do. 
</P>
<P>
"If the club does good, then I'll proably be back. If I do good and the club 
doesn't, I'll probably be the first to go." 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan's style has changed somewhat over the years, from power to finesse. A 
year ago he had the lowest strikeout ratio of any American League starting 
pitcher, a statistic about which he was both unaware and unconcerned. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to have more strikeouts, and more walks, because I went deeper into the 
count," he said. "My stuff really hasn't changed in the last five years. Now my 
concentration is on trying to get a guy out with one pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"There are times when I feel like I can still pop the ball, but other times I 
know I have to change speeds more." 
</P>
<P>
Modest to a fault, Flanagan has never been overly impressed with his own 
accomplishments, but this is his 15th season in the big leagues. He hasn't 
lasted this long just because he's left-handed. 
</P>
<P>
He has been a very noticeable leader by example for the Blue Jays, just as he 
was for the Orioles. He's pitching again for a contender, a situation with 
which he's always been most comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
He introduced the "Kangaroo Kourt" to the Blue Jays and serves as the judge 
whenever it's in session. He doesn't go out of his way to set the pace, but 
neither does he make any attempt to sidestep the responsibilities that go with 
being a veteran. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Flanagan has made changes as a pitcher, but not as a person. He just 
doesn't work in his adopted home town anymore.

AND DOWN THE STRETCH HE CAME, RUNNING THE WRONG DIRECTION

<P>
Larry Collmus used to say his most exciting time in racing was announcing the 
fifth race at Pimlico here on Preakness day, 1986. It was heady stuff for a kid 
of 19, not long out of high school, calling a race for a crowd of 87,652. 
</P>
<P>
But that was easy. The horses in that race all ran in the same direction. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard the crowd sort of murmur," said Collmus, now in his third year as 
announcer at Golden Gate Fields in Albany, Calif., "and then I saw the horse." 
</P>
<P>
Sporting crowds roar in exultation, or anger. They buzz in anticipation. But 
when something weird happens, they murmur. 
</P>
<P>
In the third at Golden Gate on April 1 Collmus had been making his call of the 
eight 3-year-old maiden fillies at the far turn of the six-furlong race. Then, 
responding to the murmur, he saw the ninth horse. Gold Charm was coming around 
the clubhouse turn, going the wrong way, riderless. 
</P>
<P>
The field was on course to mayhem at the sixteenth pole, where the contending 
horses would be at full speed. 
</P>
<P>
There are no training manuals for guidance in such situations. "My first 
concern was for the jockeys," Collmus said. 
</P>
<P>
He began to speak the Mayday of the race track: "Loose horse!" 
</P>
<P>
He paused. "Yes, Judge?" he said, his mike open. Steward Dennis Nevin had 
called to him from the judges' stand below. "He said to go ahead," Collmus 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"Riders, watch out," Collmus called. "A loose horse in the stretch. Please 
watch out. Loose horse in stretch. Pull your horses up. Look out!" 
</P>
<P>
Collmus had seen Gold Charm, coming from the No. 1 stall of the starting gate, 
duck in, crash into the inside rail and unseat his rider. He did not see Gold 
Charm regain his feet and, disoriented, run off clockwise. 
</P>
<P>
Tiffany's Gem broke last from the gate, and jockey Ron Warren saw Gold Charm 
hit the fence. "I looked back and saw him get away from the pony boys 
(outriders), so I thought there'd be a problem," Warren said later. 
</P>
<P>
The riders apparently didn't hear Collmus, but they saw workers in the infield 
waving their arms and heard shouts as they made the far turn, so they were 
riding tentatively at the quarter pole. By then the loose horse was passing the 
finish line, hugging the rail. 
</P>
<P>
He was a surprise to apprentice jockey William Mahorney Jr., riding 51-1 
also-ran Mayfair Drive. "I look up," Mahorney told Collmus later, "and there's 
this horse." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, Ricky Frazier, on the lead with Wild Win, was first to see the 
loose horse. "He angled out about five paths," Collmus recalled. And he lasted 
by a head over Tiffany's Gem. There was a stewards' inquiry, but no objections. 
After 13 minutes, Collmus was instructed to announce that the race stood "as 
is." No one, the stewards decided, had gained unfair advantage. 
</P>
<P>
It would seem that knowing there was a loose horse, as Warren did, or seeing 
him first, as Frazier did, would be an advantage. But nobody appealed. 
</P>
<P>
Steward Lewis questioned Collmus' "judgment" in suggesting the riders pull up. 
It was later agreed his action was humanely motivated. 
</P>
<P>
"Lumpy," as Collmus was affectionately known in the Maryland press boxes when 
he was a chubby kid calling a race a day, is established at the Northern 
California tracks. He has a difficult drive from Foster City (near Bay Meadows) 
to Golden Gate at Albany, across the Bay Bridge, and the earthquake made it 
tougher. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's a great meeting they have here," he said. "Bob Umphrey (once an 
assistant in the Laurel racing office) is the racing secretary and he puts on a 
show. We have everything: two miles on the grass, four and a half furlongs on 
the grass, everything. And the races fill." 
</P>
<P>
On the Sunday when Gold Charm went the wrong way, Golden Gate handled 
$1,786,393 on track and $1,789,212 at 15 inter-track outlets.

DRAFT: UNDERCLASSMEN, BUT NOT UNDERTALENTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

NEW YORK 
</P>
<P>
One of the NFL's prominent personnel men was talking about the 35 juniors who 
make Sunday's NFL draft one of the deepest in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like it," he said. "I'd much rather have a 23-year-old with two or 
three solid years of college behind him than a 20-year-old with a 
year-and-a-half's experience." 
</P>
<P>
Does that mean, he was asked, that he wouldn't pick a junior if a good one was 
available. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoa!" he almost yelled. "I didn't say that!" 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 draft, which begins at noon EDT and continues Monday with the final 
seven or eight rounds, is the first in which the NFL has indiscriminately 
allowed in underclassmen, following a pattern established by pro basketball 
nearly two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
Like the man cited above, nearly everyone from commissioner Paul Tagliabue down 
say he wishes the kids would stay in school. 
</P>
<P>
Like the man cited above, nearly everyone is excited about the talent. 
</P>
<P>
Starting with quarterbacks Jeff George of Illinois and Andre Ware of Houston 
and linebackers Junior Seau of Southern California and Keith McCants of 
Alabama, perhaps four of the first seven players picked will be underclassmen. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 10 could go on the first round. 
</P>
<P>
"When you squeeze a lot of next year's draft into this year's, it's made it 
more lucrative," says Pittsburgh coach Chuck Noll, echoing his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"But it will be weaker down the line. I would prefer the juniors stay in there 
and get an extra year of experience and an extra year of time. Some of the 
reasons they have for coming out early aren't real good. But they're there and 
we'll make decisions on them." 
</P>
<P>
The exodus makes the draft the deepest in at least five years and perhaps the 
best since 1983, when the first round included John Elway, Eric Dickerson, Curt 
Warner and Dan Marino, who lasted until the 27th pick. It's richest in 
linebackers and running backs thinnest in offensive linemen and defensive 
backs. 
</P>
<P>
"What all these juniors do is make it stronger down the line," says George 
Young, general manager of the New York Giants. "Now you're still going to have 
good players available in the fourth round, although if you take one of the 
kids, you'll have to take a couple of years to break him in." 
</P>
<P>
The first round has only 25 picks because three teams, Dallas, Phoenix and 
Denver gave up theirs to take Steve Walsh, Timm Rosenbach and Bobby Humphrey 
respectively in last year's supplemental draft. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas' choice of Walsh, whom they've been trying to peddle ever since, was 
particularly painful since, at 1-15, the Cowboys would have had the first pick 
this year. Denver got a bargain in Humphrey, who rushed for 1,151 yards would 
never have been available with the next-to-last pick this year. 
</P>
<P>
Cracks in the all-seniors policy have been appearing for years -- few 
underclassmen who applied for the supplemental draft have been turned down in 
the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue, commissioner Pete Rozelle's top legal adviser, had a lot to do with 
that, arguing that the NFL would lose any court battle on the simple grounds 
that it was denying someone a chance to earn a living. 
</P>
<P>
Then last year, Barry Sanders, the Heisman Trophy winner, became the first 
three-year junior allowed in the regular draft and became offensive rookie of 
the year. This year, his first as commissioner, Tagliabue simply opened the 
doors, allowing in anyone who entered college in September, 1987 or before -- 
if he renounced any remaining college eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor is the labor impasse, which has convinced many agents that the 
owners are about to impose a rookie salary scale that would mean the end of the 
seven-figure contracts that have become standard the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's being driven strictly by player agents looking for more money for 
themselves," says Carl Peterson, general manager of the Kansas City Chiefs. 
"For a lot of them, the money they thought will be there may not be." 
</P>
<P>
But many of the juniors, quite frankly, need the money, like Lamar Lathon, a 
linebacker from Houston and a likely first-rounder, who wants to help his 
sister go through a treatment for crack addiction. 
</P>
<P>
Lathon is one of many linebackers who represent the cream of this draft. 
</P>
<P>
The best was supposed to be McCants, the Alabama junior who was considered the 
sure No. 1 pick when he announced he was coming out and was described by none 
other than Lawrence Taylor as "the Lawrence Taylor of the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
But McCants has been derailed by a series of circumstances ranging from his 
choice of an agent -- Lance Luchnick -- to a rather mediocre workout in which 
floating chips were discovered in his knee. Now he could drop down to sixth or 
lower, potentially costing him $1 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think he's a terrific football player, and I don't think anybody 
questions how good he was in college or how good he could be in the pros," says 
Bobby Beathard, now the general manager at San Diego after a dozen years with 
the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
"But from the workout, you get the idea this kid is not coming into the NFL 
saying, 'I'm doing everything I can to be worthy of the No. 1 pick."' 
</P>
<P>
In fact, McCants probably won't be the first linebacker taken and could fall 
down as far as tenth. Seau, the USC linebacker, will probably go to New England 
on the third pick. 
</P>
<P>
Other potential first-round linebackers include Lathon; James Francis of 
Baylor; Chris Singleton of Arizona; Renaldo Turnbull of West Virginia, a hybrid 
linebacker-defensive end; Percy Snow of Michigan State and perhaps Ron Cox of 
Fresno State; Terry Wooden of Syracuse; Darion Conner of Jackson State and Tony 
Bennett of Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
Like McCants, Seau and Lathon, Cox is a junior. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the running backs, a skill position that takes less time to 
learn. Sanders proved that last season when he gained 1,470 yards for the 
Lions. 
</P>
<P>
Blair Thomas of Penn State, a senior, is expected to be the second choice -- by 
the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
But other seniors have been pushed lower into the round by the juniors, 
including Darrell Thompson of Minnesota and Anthony Thompson of Indiana, who 
were thought to be top-five picks last season. Still, the Thompsons, Harold 
Green of South Carolina and Steve Broussard of Washington State, all seniors, 
could go in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
The junior running backs are led by Rodney Hampton of Georgia, Emmitt Smith of 
Florida, Leroy Hoard of Michigan and perhaps the riskiest prospect of the 
draft, Reggie Cobb of Tennessee. No one doubts Cobb's talent, but everyone's 
scared of him because he was dropped from college after failing a drug test the 
third time. 
</P>
<P>
"He's intriguing, a hell of an athlete," one personnel director says of Cobb. 
"The question is that there obviously are questions about him." 
</P>
<P>
Other positions are thinner -- in fact, most of the underclassmen are skill 
players. "You notice that there aren't many big guys there," Young says. "It 
takes much longer to develop them." 
</P>
<P>
Tackle Richmond Webb of Texas A&amp;M and center Bern Brostek of Washington are 
considered the only first-round offensive linemen. 
</P>
<P>
The best defensive line prospect is Miami's Cortez Kennedy with Ray Agnew of 
North Carolina State, Dennis Brown of Washington, Oliver Barnett of Kentucky 
and Jeff Alm of Notre Dame also potential first rounders. The only top 
underclassmen is Marc Spindler of Pitt and his stock has dropped because of 
questions about a bad knee. 
</P>
<P>
Ware and George are the only sure first-round quarterbacks, although Scott 
Mitchell of Utah and perhaps Cary Conklin of Washington could also squeeze in. 
</P>
<P>
Other potential first-rounders include wide receivers Reggie Rembert of West 
Virginia, Alexander Wright of Auburn and Greg McMurtry of Michigan; defensive 
backs J.D. Williams of Fresno State, Ben Smith of Georgia, Pat Terrell of Notre 
Dame and Vince Buck of Central State in Ohio; defensive end Rob Burnett and 
linebacker Terry Wooden of Syracuse and guard Mohammed Elewonibi of Brigham 
Young. 
</P>
<P>
Following the Falcons and Jets, the order in the first round is New England, 
Tampa Bay, San Diego, Chicago, Detroit, Seattle, Miami, Seattle again, the 
Raiders, Cincinnati, Kansas City, New Orleans, Houston, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, 
Green Bay with two picks, Atlanta again, Dallas, Philadelphia, the Rams, the 
Giants and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Washington is without a first-round pick for the 21st time in 24 years, having 
traded it to Atlanta for Gerald Riggs; Indianapolis gave its pick to Seattle 
for Fredd Young; Minnesota surrendered its first-rounder to Dallas for Herschel 
Walker and Cleveland gave its to Green Bay for the right to take Lawyer Tillman 
in the second round last year.

ANDERSON GETS WHAT HE WANTS; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: BUCCANEERS COMPLETE TRADE WITH CHARGERS. RUNNING BACK SIGNS $3.6 
MILLION CONTRACT FOR FOUR YEARS. 
</P>

<P>
After a hectic 48 hours, Gary Anderson officially is a Tampa Bay Buccaneer. 
</P>
<P>
The deal was sealed Saturday morning when Anderson signed a four-year contract 
with the Bucs. It is valued at $3.6 million, sources said. The deal includes a 
$400,000 signing bonus and a $600,000 salary for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm definitely glad this is over," said Anderson, who sat out last season in a 
contract dispute with the Chargers. "I'm ready to play football again." 
</P>
<P>
The Bucs will waste no time putting him to work. Anderson will take part in a 
two-day rookie mini-camp starting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Reaching the agreement was the last hitch in the deal that was arranged 
Thursday, bringing the Chargers a third-round pick in today's NFL draft and a 
conditional second-round pick in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Tampa Bay had imposed a deadline of 9 a.m. PDT Saturday for reaching a contract 
agreement or calling off the deal. Tampa Bay officials said the deal was 
completed on time except for a few technical details. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a few anxious moments when we were concerned it would get done, but 
everything turned out the way we hoped and the way Gary hoped," said Bobby 
Beathard, Charger general manager. 
</P>
<P>
The trade sends Anderson back to Tampa Bay, where he makes his home and played 
for three seasons (1983-85) with the Tampa Bay Bandits of the defunct United 
States Football League. And it ends a productive but abbreviated stay for 
Anderson in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard met once with Anderson and his agent, Peter Johnson of Cleveland, 
after taking over as general manager Jan. 3 but never entered into serious 
negotiations. He said he became convinced after signing three running backs in 
the Plan B free agency that the best solution was to trade Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
"Our feeling was we wouldn't be able to sign him," Beathard said. "We knew from 
the outset we had a little difference of opinion about Gary. And that's not a 
knock on Gary. Gary is an awfully good football player, but they felt that he 
was worth a lot more than we thought he was worth. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard added: "The trade probably told more than anything about Gary 
Anderson. We had conversations with several teams when we made the decision to 
make the deal, and this was the best deal we could make. We're happy with what 
we got."

HAZARDS OF THE ROAD;

DMV EXAMINERS IN PASADENA LEARN HARD WAY WHO CAN DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jyi-Yi Chiu was doing just fine, until Richard Ascar told her to make a right 
turn into the parking lot. Chiu turned too wide, stepped on the gas instead of 
the brakes and bonked into a metal gatepost. 
</P>
<P>
The brand new Toyota sported a pitiful punched-in look, with a deep crease down 
the front and a lopsided bulge to the hood. "I didn't see the gate," said Chiu 
fretfully. 
</P>
<P>
Chiu had just flunked her driving test in a rather spectacular fashion. Ascar, 
a Department of Motor Vehicles licensing and registration examiner in Pasadena, 
summarily rejected Chiu's application for a California driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had an accident before," Ascar said, waving his hand in agitation. 
</P>
<P>
Ascar, a 12-year veteran of the DMV, is one of the rare ones. Most of the 
examiners at the office on Rosemead Boulevard say they've been averaging about 
one accident a year while administering road tests, from modest fender-benders 
to astounding wall-bangers. 
</P>
<P>
The cinder-block wall that separates DMV from the RB Furniture Store parking 
lot next door has been jolted so often by careening test-takers that RB 
demanded that metal poles be 
</P>
<P>
installed as barricades on the DMV side. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first took the job, I figured I'd just be driving around with them for 
a couple of blocks," said examiner Frances Torres, who has been testing drivers 
for two years. "It never occurred to me that I'd be dealing with people who had 
no knowledge at all of what it means to be behind the wheel." 
</P>
<P>
The bustling Pasadena DMV office, where an overflow crowd of between 1,200 and 
1,400 people a day goes to take care of car business, has become one of the 
doorways through which a growing immigrant population in the San Gabriel Valley 
passes into the freeway society. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena examiners can administer the written test for a driver's license in 
two dozen languages, including Samoan, Thai, Hindi, Chinese, Japanese, 
Vietnamese, Armenian, Russian, Polish and Greek. 
</P>
<P>
But you never know what you'll get from those pulling into the road test line 
behind the building, examiners say. The urgency to get a driver's license in 
Southern California, where cars often represent the only means of getting to 
work or play, brings some unlikely applicants to the Pasadena DMV office. 
</P>
<P>
"Once, I flunked a woman after she had driven a block," says Greg Doherty, a 
17-year veteran who is usually given the office's hard cases. "She told me she 
had never driven a car in her life before. She said she'd been watching 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, about 30,000 people took the road test at the Pasadena office, 
resulting in nine accidents -- and countless near misses, according to 
examiners. That was up from five in 1988 and four in 1987. Almost 30% of those 
who take the road test in Pasadena fail, significantly higher than the average 
of between 22% and 25% in 175 state offices. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena's fail rate is partly because it's used as a site for testing drivers 
of big rigs and buses, as well as regular drivers, says branch manager Rawlin 
Mull. 
</P>
<P>
"About 40% of the commercial drivers fail," says Mull. 
</P>
<P>
But the Pasadena office also is the DMV office of choice for thousands of 
recent arrivals from countries where there's little opportunity to learn 
behind-the-wheel skills or freeway etiquette. 
</P>
<P>
"You and I grew up driving around with our moms, racing from stop sign to stop 
sign in a car, not in a basket on a bicycle," says one street-hardened 
examiner. 
</P>
<P>
During one afternoon on the line recently, Doherty wrestled for control of the 
steering wheel with one young novice driver who was accelerating toward the 
rear end of another car. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a mistake in driving skill," said the miffed test-taker. "It was 
the meaning of his words. I didn't understand what he was saying." 
</P>
<P>
Then Doherty got into the passenger seat of a brand new Cadillac and quizzed an 
elderly man who was there to have his license recertified. 
</P>
<P>
The man's wife stood tensely on the sidewalk, watching her husband fumble 
ineffectually with the controls. "I hope to God he fails," she muttered. "He 
has no business being behind the wheel." Her husband was 79 and in failing 
health, said the woman. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid to get into the car with him," she said. "No, he hasn't had any 
accidents. God knows why not. Somebody must be watching out for him." 
</P>
<P>
Doherty failed the man before the car left the curb. "I could tell he had some 
problems," said Doherty. "He wasn't even aware that the motor wasn't running." 
</P>
<P>
According to a DMV spokesman, the accident rate for road tests statewide has 
been rising precipitously in recent years. Last year, there were 295 accidents 
during road tests, with 34 resulting in injuries to examiners. That was up from 
210 accidents in 1988 and 185 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In San Mateo last month, an examiner suffered a severe back sprain when an 
applicant unexpectedly shifted into reverse and floored the accelerator, 
smashing his car into the DMV building. 
</P>
<P>
Put two examiners together, and they start telling war stories. 
</P>
<P>
Doherty points at the RB wall, next to which drivers pull in after they have 
finished their tests. "I went through that wall last July," Doherty says. "A 
gal hit the gas instead of the brake, and she knocked a hole in the wall the 
size of the car." 
</P>
<P>
Billy Barnes, RB's warehouse manager at the time, says he was standing on the 
other side of the wall when the car crashed through. "I saw the examiner 
sitting there, shaking his head," says Barnes, who has since transferred to 
another RB facility. "Somebody said, 'I guess he's not going to pass her.' " 
</P>
<P>
Doherty says his only injury came a few years ago in another parking lot 
accident, when he tried to grab a gear shift whose handle was cracked. "The 
driver sort of froze on the accelerator, and we had a choice of hitting some 
pedestrians or some motorcycles," Doherty says. "I grabbed the wheel and tried 
to throw it into park, and we wound up sitting on a couple of Kawasakis. I cut 
my finger." 
</P>
<P>
Others have wrenched their backs or necks. "When everything is moving at 35 
m.p.h. and all of a sudden it stops, it sort of makes you sore all over," said 
one examiner. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Snyder, DMV deputy chief of field operations, said new examiners are given 
three weeks of training for road tests, including instruction on when and how 
to seize the steering wheel or to apply the emergency brake. 
</P>
<P>
"We show them how to take control of a vehicle and even how to reach over (from 
the passenger seat) and step on the brake, if possible," says Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
"Boogie rides," examiner Martin Delgado calls the wild, unpredictable forays 
into the traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are the scary ones," he says, describing a few near misses he has 
experienced. "You have to be able to react, be defensive." 
</P>
<P>
It's a lesson that some learn the hard way. Examiner John Ray was almost 
finished testing a man last year, when he directed the driver to make a turn. 
</P>
<P>
"He was doing real good until that point," Ray says. "But he lost it a little 
coming around the corner. I looked down for a second to make a note. When I 
looked back up, all I could see was the rear end of a Chevy." 
</P>
<P>
The driver's car was totaled, Ray recalls. "It just kind of peeled back from 
the hood." But Ray learned a valuable lesson. "From now on, I don't look down."

The lunch rush was over at Marroosh Sandwiches, an Armenian restaurant on Allen 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The last telephone to-go order had been filled, the last falafel fried, the 
last shawerma slices rolled in pita bread. At the window table remained only 
two dark-suited, elderly men who lingered over their plates, chatting in 
animated Armenian. 
</P>
<P>
Cook Garo Krikorian took his afternoon break, sipping a demitasse of strong, 
black Armenian coffee and smoking a cigarette to fortify him for the remaining 
five hours of business. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be there," he told Boghos Kozadjian. "We close. We don't open our 
business. I don't send my kids to school on the 24th." 
</P>
<P>
"Every Armenian in the whole world who has a shop will close that day," 
Kozadjian replied. 
</P>
<P>
"That day" is April 24, Tuesday, the anniversary of what Armenians call the 
Armenian Genocide. The date commemorates the deaths of 1.5 million Armenians 
who died beginning in 1915 during their relocation from Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
Turkey, however, does not recognize the deaths as genocide and instead calls 
them casualties of war. Armenians continue to pressure to have the genocide 
recognized internationally and by Turkey so that reparations may be made to the 
victims and their descendants. 
</P>
<P>
For Pasadena's Armenian community, the 75th observance comes at a time of sharp 
self-awareness. A special count commissioned by the city of Pasadena revealed 
earlier this month that the city's Armenian-American population numbers 6,850. 
The statistics depicted Pasadena's Armenian-Americans as educated, 
property-owning, middle-class folk. 
</P>
<P>
But the figures do not reveal the soul of the Armenian community. That comes 
from the stories some Armenians tell, the memories they revive at this time of 
year. 
</P>
<P>
For Barkev Magarian, 74, the genocide is a childhood memory of himself as a 
4-year-old, riding in a box strapped to a donkey as he fled Turkey with his 
family in a caravan of 400 other Armenians marching to neighboring Syria. 
</P>
<P>
"On the road, you did not speak Armenian because we were scared that if 
somebody knew we were Armenian, they would kill us," Magarian recalled, 
speaking through a translator in his Washington Boulevard apartment. 
</P>
<P>
As the caravans passed through towns, robbers would set upon the refugees. 
"Whoever they were able to kill, they did," Magarian said. "If they saw a good 
dress on you, they took it away." 
</P>
<P>
Some Armenians swallowed their gold teeth hoping to hide them from the 
brigands, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Once they reached Aleppo, Syria, the Armenian refugees lived in makeshift 
houses and piled blankets on the floor for beds, Magarian said. The Armenians 
gradually established themselves in Aleppo, where Magarian said he found 
employment as a shoemaker and started a family. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1960, Magarian became an immigrant again, leaving Syria for Beirut, 
Lebanon, when political unrest caused economic instability. Magarian said he 
sold eggs in Lebanon to support his family back in Aleppo. "I used to go to the 
train station and give the money to someone on the train who would give it to 
my wife," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually he brought his family to Beirut, but a civil war beginning in 1975 
between the Christians and Muslims heated to the point that life became 
unbearable for the Armenians who tried to stay neutral. Beirut became a 
battleground with constant shelling. Normal life again ended for Magarian and 
his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"It was always scary," he said. "You didn't want to go out because a car bomb 
will explode. We were afraid to go out to get food." 
</P>
<P>
Magarian and his wife slept in their clothes, trying to find a safe place to 
hide in their home during the bombing and rushing out during breaks in the 
bombing to buy food and run errands. 
</P>
<P>
They tuned to the radio to learn where bombs had fallen, and found themselves 
strangely happy to learn they were alive while others had died, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In July, Magarian and his wife finally left, uprooting themselves for a third 
time in his life to find peace. He came to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"There are 10 Armenian families in my area, an Armenian grocery, Armenian 
church, a pharmacy, Armenian doctors and I have a bus pass," he said, suddenly 
jumping to his feet to illustrate -- with an ancient Armenian dance step -- his 
frame of mind. "I am happy." 
</P>
<P>
While Magarian is a new, legal immigrant, some of Pasadena's Armenians fled 
Lebanon illegally. They include 47-year-old Harout, who asked that his real 
name be withheld. Harout's memories do not trace back to the genocide. His are 
of modern hardships for Armenians in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
A former prosperous businessman in Beirut with 32 employees, Harout now calls 
himself "a humble employee," who lied to his current boss about his illegal 
status in order to get a job to support his wife and teen-age daughter. 
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, Harout's home was in the city's Christian sector and his work in the 
Muslim sector, so he found himself confronting armed men from both camps. Some 
nights he couldn't cross the lines and was forced to spend the night in a 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Four times he was taken into custody during the civil war. Soldiers from both 
camps tried to pressure neutral Armenians to take a side. "They said, 'Why 
aren't you fighting in the war?' " 
</P>
<P>
Three times bombs knocked out the windows on his car and home. He tried to sell 
a vacation home in the mountains only to discover it had been stripped of its 
contents, and was being occupied by the Syrian Army. 
</P>
<P>
"They stole everything. It was empty," Harout said. "Even the wallpaper, they 
stole that." 
</P>
<P>
Harout fled Lebanon with his family in 1986 and applied for legal American 
citizenship. But that procedure, already complicated, was made more so by the 
closure of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut. All the embassy files were shifted to 
Athens, so Harout and his family had to travel to Greece to fill out papers to 
stay in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know how much money we spent making phone calls, telexes to get the 
documents, airplane tickets and hotels?" he said. "A green card cost my family 
$12,000." 
</P>
<P>
While Harout appreciates his opportunities here, he knows of others who still 
remain illegal, unable to afford the high price of sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have two friends who don't have their green cards," he said. "They are 
scared." 
</P>
<P>
For Joy Sarafian, a fourth-generation Californian of Armenian descent, the 
memories at this time of year are mainly historical. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel I represent most Armenians," Sarafian said. "But if you ask me 
the Armenian values, I can tell you what it meant to be my grandmother's 
grandchild or my father's daughter." 
</P>
<P>
A 37-year-old single woman who owns her own public relations company, 
Sarafian's ancestors came from Fresno in the 1890s when the first wave of 
Armenians fled Turkey and settled in the United States, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Growing up in Pasadena, Sarafian said she never experienced discrimination, but 
she also never felt the strong identification with the Armenian culture that is 
now springing up. Assimilation was the goal. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were growing up, there was no such thing as an Armenian school, no 
such thing as an Armenian college," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She jokes that if Armenia, now a part of the Soviet Union and Turkey, were ever 
to be re-created as an independent country, she couldn't leave the United 
States because there are "no Nordstroms." Yet she takes pride in the 
accomplishments of her father, Armen Sarafian, founder of the American Armenian 
International College in La Verne and a past Pasadena City College president. 
</P>
<P>
Still, she finds herself puzzled as to what makes her an Armenian and what 
compels her to strongly identify with her heritage. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my question: What makes us Armenian? I don't know," she said. "Is it 
the culture, the books or just pride in family? Even though I'm 
fourth-generation Californian, I can honestly say that my sense of being 
Armenian has never left." 
</P>

FATE OF BICYCLE CLUB RIDES ON COURT ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA GRIEGO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BELL GARDENS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge in Florida is scheduled to start the first of a series of 
hearings Friday to determine how many of the investors in the Bicycle Club knew 
that profits from a marijuana smuggling ring were invested in the club. 
</P>
<P>
The judge is expected to decide eventually whether any of the club's 31 
investors will be required to forfeit their interests, and who ultimately will 
control the club. 
</P>
<P>
The club was seized April 2 by the federal government and placed under the 
control of the city of Bell Gardens after a federal jury found four men guilty 
of a complex racketeering scheme that involved investing drug-smuggling profits 
in several ventures, including construction of the club. 
</P>
<P>
One of those men was a partner of a group that owns a controlling interest in 
the Bicycle Club. 
</P>
<P>
For the last three weeks, revenues from the club, which sometimes reach 
$200,000 a day, have been deposited directly into a special account controlled 
by the U.S. Marshal Service. The club's 31 investors will not receive their 
share until the judge determines who will be allowed to retain ownership in the 
club and who must forfeit it to the federal government for auction. 
</P>
<P>
At stake is control of a card casino that brings in $100 million a year, 
creates 1,900 jobs and provides about half of the city's tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Lockridge, a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Agency, said that in most 
federal seizure cases, neither innocence nor ignorance of the owner or investor 
is considered a defense. 
</P>
<P>
"It is hard to understand, but the case is not against the people," he said. 
"The case is against the property. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, if a vehicle is used to transport drugs, it has nothing to do 
with whether the driver or the owner knew. Under the law, the question is, 'Did 
the car transport narcotics or didn't it?' If in fact it did, it can be seized 
and can ultimately be forfeited by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is (whether) the Bicycle Club was built with the proceeds of 
illegal activity. If it was, then that's the end of the story." 
</P>
<P>
But Lockridge added that the federal judge ultimately decides what will happen 
to the seized property. There are provisions for innocent owners, but it is up 
to the owners to prove their innocence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bicycle Club is owned by two general partnerships -- LCP Associates and 
Park Place Associates. Michael Gilbert, one of the men convicted of 
racketeering, is a limited partner in LCP Associates, which has a 65% interest 
in the club. Club General Manager George Hardie holds a controlling interest in 
the other general partnership, Park Place Associates, which owns the remaining 
35%. 
</P>
<P>
Federal law recognizes five different degrees of innocence, ranging from an 
investor or owner who was not convicted but was found to be involved in illegal 
activity, to an owner or investor who was found to have done everything 
possible to prevent his property from being used for illegal purposes, 
Lockridge said. 
</P>
<P>
Hardie said the case is further complicated because the club is unique among 
properties seized by the federal government in drug cases. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not like a car or a boat," he said. "It is a living and breathing asset. 
It has a value that fluctuates. I don't think anybody in the country knows how 
it is going to turn out. It could go on for two or three years." 
</P>
<P>
There are several possible outcomes. 
</P>
<P>
The judge could decide that the entire club should be forfeited and put on the 
auction block. The federal government has no interest in running a card casino, 
Lockridge said. 
</P>
<P>
But that outcome is the least likely one, Bell Gardens City Manager Claude 
Booker said. He noted that the U.S. attorney in Miami has already stated that 
Park Place Associates, the general partnership controlled by Hardie, is an 
innocent third party. Hardie, who testified as a government witness during the 
three-month trial, has said he did not know drug money was used to help build 
the club. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors said $12.5 million of the club's $22 million construction 
costs were traced to the drug-smuggling scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the U.S. attorney's office in Miami declined to comment about 
the upcoming hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Booker also cited a partial forfeiture as another possibility. In that case, 
anywhere from 5% to 65% of the club could be forfeited and auctioned. 
</P>
<P>
Hardie, who was allowed to remain general manager, said in a recent interview 
that he expects to be allowed to retain his interest. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was referred to Los Angeles developer Samuel Gilbert while 
attempting to obtain financing to build the club. Hardie said that after 
several meetings a deal was negotiated in which a partnership formed by Gilbert 
would receive 65% of the club in return for financing the construction. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert was not a partner of LCP Associates, which owns 65% of the club, but 
most of the money LCP used to finance a construction loan for the club came 
from Gilbert's elaborate laundering network, federal prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Gilbert, Samuel Gilbert's son, was the only partner in LCP Associates 
convicted of racketeering in relation to the money laundering case. He owned 5% 
of the Bicycle Club. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel Gilbert was indicted in the case, but died before authorities announced 
that he had been charged. 
</P>
<P>
The hearings that are scheduled to begin Friday are expected to shed more light 
on the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not over," Hardie said. "It's an ongoing thing. It's not pleasant. Sam 
probably took a lot of secrets with him to the grave."

THREE CITY COUNCILS REORGANIZE, SELECT NEW MAYORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cerritos 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ann B. Joynt, who led the balloting in City Council elections two 
weeks ago, is the city's new mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Joynt, 50, who is beginning her second council term, was elected unanimously as 
mayor Wednesday night at the council's reorganization meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Joynt, a former high school teacher, is executive director of the U.S. Academic 
Decathlon, which has headquarters in Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
The council selected Paul W. Bowlen as vice mayor. Bowlen, 49, a teacher at 
Cerritos High School, was elected to the council two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
As mayor, Joynt replaces Diana Needham, who was prohibited from seeking 
reelection this year by a 1987 City Charter amendment limiting council members 
to two consecutive terms. Veteran Councilman Barry Rabbitt was also barred from 
seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Two newly elected council members -- John Crawley and Sherman Kappe -- were 
sworn in at the meeting. Crawley, 47, is a financial analyst with Atlantic 
Richfield Corp. Kappe, 45, is a former planning commissioner. He is a 
residential property owner and manager. 
</P>
<P>
La Mirada 
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday night's meeting, the City Council selected Lou Piltz to succeed Art 
Leslie as mayor. The mayor pro tem will be Bob Chotiner. 
</P>
<P>
Piltz, a retired maintenance manager for Lucky supermarkets, joined the council 
in 1978. He has been mayor twice previously during his four terms in office. 
</P>
<P>
Council elections were called off when no one opposed the incumbents. As a 
result, Piltz, Wayne Rew and Art Leslie will begin new four-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
Norwalk 
</P>
<P>
First-term Councilman Luigi A. Vernola was elected mayor Wednesday by City 
Council colleagues. Vernola replaced Councilwoman Grace F. Napolitano, who was 
reelected to the council in the April 10 election. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Mike Mendez, who was elected to the council in 1988, was named mayor 
pro tem.

ROHRABACHER, WITH NO PRIMARY OPPONENT, STILL OUTSPENDS DEMOCRATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE HATCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As two low-budget Democratic candidates fight for the right to challenge him in 
the Nov. 6 election, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) has been quietly raising 
and spending campaign cash at a rate of more than $15,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement filed with the Federal Elections Commission last week, 
Rohrabacher reported $54,131 in contributions and $50,607 in expenditures for 
the first three months of the year. His cash on hand as of March 31 amounted to 
$95,053. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the two Democrats scheduled to compete in the June 5 primary, 
computer newsletter publisher Jim Cavuoto of Torrance and political science 
instructor Guy Kimbrough of Huntington Beach, said they have accumulated less 
than $5,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Democrat filed quarterly campaign finance statements, which are 
required for federal candidates only if their fund raising or spending has 
surpassed $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
But both men predicted they would cross that threshold this week. Kimbrough 
said he would raise $15,000 during the primary campaign and, assuming he wins 
his party's nomination, $135,000 for the general election. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's very do-able, and I'm not just blowing smoke," said Kimbrough, 
who raised $12,544 before losing to Rohrabacher in the 1988 general election. 
</P>
<P>
Cavuoto said he could collect similar amounts, but added, "Going much beyond 
$100,000 is going to be tough." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher faces no primary opposition in his bid for a second term as 
congressman for the largely coastal 42nd District, which includes Signal Hill 
and parts of Long Beach. But his fund raising has been brisk. 
</P>
<P>
Of the $54,131 in contributions listed in Rohrabacher's quarterly report, 
$12,000 came from political action committees, including a total of $1,750 from 
five oil industry donors -- Texaco, Chevron, Exxon, Unocal and the Independent 
Oil Producers Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher favors aggressive domestic oil exploration -- including offshore 
drilling -- and he acknowledges that this position probably helped prompt oil 
industry contributions to his campaign. An industry lobbyist agreed, but said 
his group's donation was also prompted by a political fact of life: Incumbents 
usually win. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been around long enough to know that the power of incumbency is 
important," said Bill Northrop, executive vice president of the Independent Oil 
Producers Agency, a marketing cooperative for small oil operators. "What little 
we have to give we give to incumbents." 
</P>
<P>
Among the other PAC donors listed in Rohrabacher's report are a tobacco 
industry group, the Bank of America, General Telephone and three defense 
contractors -- Lockheed, Rockwell and McDonnell Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
Cavuoto said he will draw attention to "big money" special interest 
contributions to Rohrabacher -- predicting that voters will be put off, for 
instance, when they learn of his donations from the oil industry. Rohrabacher 
disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it is intellectually defensible to suggest that because someone 
is in public office, then they (would take) a position simply because they 
accept contributions from a certain industry," Rohrabacher said. "People are 
sophisticated enough to know that it's industry that is supporting people for 
the stands they take and not the other way around." 
</P>
<P>
Of Rohrabacher's $50,607 in expenditures, $13,837 went to pay campaign debts 
incurred during his successful first run for Congress in 1988. As of March 31, 
his outstanding debts were $22,291, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
Other expenditures covered 1990 campaign spending. A big-ticket item, for 
instance, was paychecks for his campaign manager, Gene Ferguson, who made 
$12,315 in salary and bonuses during the three-month period. 
</P>
<P>
One of the largest single payments, $3,500, covered expenses incurred by Vice 
President Dan Quayle when he attended a February fund-raiser for Rohrabacher in 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher's campaign treasurer, Jeffrey Earle, says the rookie congressman 
hopes to keep his spending to a minimum during the coming year. Maintaining a 
sizable cash balance proves useful come election year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been told that by having $100,000 in the account at the beginning of the 
year (we) might have deterred some potential challengers," Earle said. 
</P>
<P>
Cavuoto and Kimbrough admit that Rohrabacher will be tough to beat, buoyed as 
he is by a sizable war chest, the power of incumbency and the Republican 
Party's commanding 53% share of registered voters in the 42nd District. Faced 
with these odds, they say, contributions will be hard to get -- even from the 
Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
But each candidate says he can still collect enough cash to run a winning 
campaign. Cavuoto says he will use his state Democratic Party endorsement and 
his connections in the computer industry to raise money, and Kimbrough hopes to 
call on union organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Both candidates plan to tap groups at odds with Rohrabacher -- opponents of 
offshore oil drilling and those who oppose his anti-abortion stand, for 
example. They also hope to target groups angered by the GOP congressman's 
efforts to restrict federal funding for art projects that government agencies 
deem obscene, indecent, sacrilegious or racist. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher says he doubts such strategy will work. He says his positions on 
issues such as oil drilling, abortion and federal funding for the arts, though 
controversial, are much appreciated in his conservative district. 
</P>
<P>
"I think voters appreciate the fact that I'm not afraid to take tough stands," 
Rohrabacher said. "They didn't send me back here to sit in a rocking chair."

TEACHER LAUDS ACTS BY 'REMARKABLE' STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a day and age when it seems popular to state how bad our teens are in 
society, I have a story to show otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
I have been a student teacher at Nogales High School in La Puente since 
February in the Choral Music Department. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent choir tour, my car was stolen from the campus. The students of 
the choir were outraged and began gathering information, resulting in a list of 
suspects. Some of the students went searching for my car in the surrounding 
area. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday following the tour, I was asked to remain in class over lunch. All 
the choir students came in the room, (and) over 100 students proceeded to share 
with me the impact I've had on their lives in only two months and how they were 
sorry this adversity had come to me. Then they handed me a shoe box marked 
"Stolen Car Fund." The students had collected over $500 in cash to help my wife 
and I with any expenses we may have. 
</P>
<P>
What I wish to say first is to teachers everywhere: You can have a profound 
impact on the lives of your students, impact that will move them to action. 
Secondly, I've got to say that there are still teen-agers with remarkable 
character, young people who respect others, who care about others and who are 
willing to give of themselves to help others. 
</P>
<P>
We all must remember to reinforce the good in people and recognize them for who 
they are inside, young and old alike. Thank you, Nogales students!

CERRITOS TO BEGIN RECYCLING BEFORE LAWS TAKE EFFECT

<TEXT>
<P>
Residents will be recycling at least part of their trash by the end of the year 
to get a jump on state recycling laws, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council decided April 4 that it wants to recycle something in a hurry, 
and city staff members have been scurrying around searching for ideas. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll go with grass very soon," said Councilwoman Ann B. Joynt, adding 
that one of her first acts as the new mayor will be to set up a solid-waste 
management committee for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, all municipalities must have recycling plans in place by the 
middle of next year and by 1995 must cut by 25% the amount of garbage and trash 
produced by residents and businesses. By the year 2000, cities must cut their 
waste by 50%. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking for a lot of advice from the (Los Angeles County) Sanitation 
Districts," said City Public Services Director Vincent Brar. "This is such a 
new field, especially for cities who have no experience in recycling and 
haven't done it in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Joynt said she expects little resistence to recycling from residents: "I think 
this community is ready for it." 
</P>
<P>
The Earth Day celebration today gives the city a chance to capitalize on public 
enthusiasm for new conservation measures, she added. 
</P>
<P>
"Earth Day represents an awareness that has reached right down to all the 
people in the community and provided motivation so that they want to be a part 
of it," she said. "And it's up to us as a council to provide the mechanism." 
</P>
<P>
The resolution to start recycling, which was unanimously adopted by the 
council, was the last proposal introduced by departing Councilwoman Diana 
Needham, who was prohibited by city charter from seeking a third consecutive 
term. 
</P>
<P>
"It was her environmental last hurrah," said Joynt, who was selected Wednesday 
by the council to succeed Needham. 
</P>
<P>
"The City Council," Needham said, "could wait until we're mandated, but I 
wanted the city to be in the forefront." 
</P>
<P>
Several cities, she pointed out, already have recycling programs. 
</P>
<P>
Downey, for example, has had residential recycling since 1976 for glass, 
newspapers and aluminum. The city recently added plastic soft drink and water 
bottles to its list. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the first things we've got to do," Brar said, "is do a waste-stream 
analysis to tell us how much and what is in our trash. Then we can say, 'OK, we 
have so much . . . and this is what can be reduced from it.' " 
</P>
<P>
The most likely choice on the list of possible recyclable items, Brar said, is 
clean green waste: grass clippings, shrubbery, leaves and tree branches. It can 
be sold and reused as compost or as cover for landfills. 
</P>
<P>
It is so difficult to come up with markets for the recycled items and so 
expensive to hire waste management consultants to draw up plans, Brar said, 
that he will talk to other cities and to Sanitation Districts officials about 
possibly "hiring a common consultant to come up with a common plan."

ASTROS SPOIL THIS ANNIVERSARY PARTY; 
</P>
<P>
DODGERS: CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION ENDS IN DISAPPOINTMENT AS HOUSTON SCORES TWICE 
IN THE NINTH INNING TO WIN, 6-5. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Appropriately, on the centennial anniversary of the Dodgers' first victory in 
the National League, fans were treated to a few things Saturday night that 
happen about once every 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Eddie Murray committed an error. It was the Dodger first baseman's first 
error in 123 games, since May 30 of last season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Casey Candaele of the Houston Astros hit a home run. It was the second 
homer of the infielder's career. The first, in 1987 with Montreal, was 
considered so special the Expos painted the seat at Olympic Park. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jay Howell blew a lead. 
</P>
<P>
That final oddity is what the Dodgers will remember, as Howell was handed a 5-4 
lead in the ninth inning and gave up two runs, resulting in a 6-5 loss to the 
Astros before 48,434 at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Howell had not allowed an earned run in two appearances this season, and cost 
the Dodgers losses in three of 56 appearances last season. But none of that 
made what happened Saturday any easier to accept. 
</P>
<P>
"I stunk," said Howell, who battled shoulder stiffness last week but did not 
blame his problems on anything physical. "I am not searching for any excuses. 
The team did their job. I did not do mine." 
</P>
<P>
After the Dodgers had taken a 5-4 lead on an error by Ken Caminiti in the 
sixth, the Astros had managed only one hit over the next three innnings off 
starter Fernando Valenzuela and reliever Don Aase. In came Howell to finish the 
game in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Three pitches later there was trouble, on a ground ball single to right by 
Rafael Ramirez. Up stepped pinch-hitter Ken Oberkfell, who led the major 
leagues in pinch-hits with 18 last season. He lined a double past Murray that 
scored Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Young replaced Oberkfell on second base. Two pitches later, he raced 
home when pinch-hitter Terry Puhl blooped an 0-and-2 fastball to left field for 
the game-winning single. 
</P>
<P>
"If you wanted to cite a mistake, that 0-and-2 pitch was it," Howell said. "I 
can't allow something like that. But the guys know I'm busting my butt. . . . 
And I know this certainly won't carry over." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers had a chance in the ninth against reliever Dave Smith, as Juan 
Samuel led off with a single. But Samuel was thrown out attempting to steal by 
catcher Craig Biggio. 
</P>
<P>
"I was given the sign to run, but my legs just don't run fast enough," Samuel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After Willie Randolph walked, Chris Gwynn struck out and Murray grounded to 
second to end the game. Gwynn, starting in left for the injured Kal Daniels, 
went hitless in five at-bats. He left the bases loaded in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Howell lost a victory for a pitcher who really understands frustration. 
Fernando Valenzuela, despite allowing four runs on seven hits over six innings, 
was poised for his first win, which would have come 47 days before last 
season's first victory. But he remains 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela thought the game was won in the sixth on a bases-loaded error by 
Caminiti, who bobbled Randolph's grounder. The bases had been loaded against 
reliever Juan Agosto on singles by Mike Scioscia and Alfredo Griffin and a walk 
to Mickey Hatcher. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros' ninth inning ruined all that, and spoiled the Dodgers anniversary 
day celebration. 
</P>
<P>
The pregame festivities delayed the start of the game, which was scheduled for 
7:05, by 34 minutes. The Astros, unlike the public, had been told the game 
would start about 7:20 p.m., so they didn't protest. But Fred Claire, Dodger 
vice president, was ready with a response. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy covering 100 years in 10 minutes," Claire said with a smile. "If 
they had wanted to protest, I would have told them, 'You try it.' " 
</P>
<P>
After the Astros took a 2-0 lead in the first inning on Glenn Davis' homer, the 
Dodgers scored a run in their half of the inning on Murray's double, but the 
Astros scored again in the third on Bill Doran's double. 
</P>
<P>
"They give me runs, and I give them back," Valenzuela said. 
</P>
<P>
After the Dodgers had taken a 4-3 lead in the fourth inning thanks to another 
grounder off Caminiti's chest that allowed a run, Valenzuela let the Astros tie 
it again in the fifth by giving up the homer to Candaele. He almost gave up 
more later in the inning, after the bases became loaded on a walk, an infield 
hit, and a grounder by Davis that bounced off Murray's glove for an error. But 
he struck out Glenn Wilson to end the threat. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hamilton, suffering from a torn rotator cuff, was placed on the 15-day 
disabled list as expected. As an indication of the potential seriousness of Kal 
Daniels' twisted side, in replacing Hamilton, the Dodgers ignored triple-A 
middle infielder Jose Vizcaino and recalled left-handed hitting first baseman 
Brian Traxler. By doing this, they are giving the third base job to the platoon 
of Mike Sharperson and Lenny Harris, but not filling a backup infielder spot 
previously held by the two players. 
</P>
<P>
Traxler hit .301 in 64 games at triple-A Albuquerque last season and was 
hitting .296 in seven games this year. He was counseled by Manager Tom Lasorda 
this spring about his biggest problem -- his weight. Traxler, 5-foot-10, has 
since dropped 15 pounds, putting him at around 200 pounds. He is not a home run 
hitter -- he has just 14 in his two full minor league seasons. "With Kal hurt, 
we wanted to get a left-handed bat in there," Vice President Fred Claire said. 
Daniels hit off a tee in a batting cage and his side, twisted Friday night, was 
still bothering him. "I thought I'd be able to play, but it's still sore," 
Daniels said. "I'll watch it day to day." 
</P>
<P>
Look for the Dodgers to make a determination about surgery for Hamilton within 
10 days, after evaluating the results of rest and rehabilitation. He received 
another scare Saturday when he tried lifting a small weight with his right arm, 
and then his left arm. The right arm was noticeably weaker. "Whatever it takes 
to get my arm stronger, I will do," Hamilton said.

LOSS TO LAKERS COULD BE CASEY'S FINALE AS COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The end of the Clipper season came Saturday night, with the end of the Clipper 
coach's tenure expected today. 
</P>
<P>
Though no one will comment officially, all indications are that Don Casey's 1 
1/2-season run will be terminated during an afternoon meeting with General 
Manager Elgin Baylor. Technically, it will not be a firing since the Clippers 
hold only an option on Casey's services for next season. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't look good," one source said. 
</P>
<P>
Casey's hopes to be retained were buoyed by showings in recent weeks, including 
a 125-115 loss to the Lakers before 15,350 at the Sports Arena, finishing the 
most successful Clipper season since 1985-86 at 30-52. Unlike a year ago, when 
the Clippers also finished strong and the search for a permanent replacement 
for Gene Shue lagged well into the summer, a decision this time will be made 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't make sense," Baylor said before the game. "I don't believe it 
should drag on. Quicker is better for everyone. I'm not going to say how it's 
going to be one way or the other. I'm going to sit down with Casey so he will 
know first what I'm thinking." 
</P>
<P>
At the latest, Baylor and Casey will meet Monday morning, before Casey departs 
for the East Coast and a weeklong vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Casey has a 41-85 record, on both an interim and a permanent basis, in his 
first NBA head coaching job. This season, the Clippers had several notable 
accomplishments -- 10 road victories, equaling the last three seasons combined; 
the first time out of last place in three years -- but Casey will ultimately be 
remembered for the emotion he stirred in his players. Unfortunately for him, it 
was mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, as the Clippers finished a 21-61 season, he had practically 
unanimous support from players. Feelings were upbeat and that carried over to 
the start of 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
Then, things fell apart. Players said Casey had changed and they also were 
unhappy about substitution patterns and the offense. They met with owner Donald 
T. Sterling in mid-February to air complaints, some going so far as to ask that 
Casey be fired. 
</P>
<P>
That never happened, things began to look good again heading toward the end of 
the season, even as the starting backcourt of Ron Harper and Gary Grant mended 
from injuries. The Clippers were still losing, but they were making good 
impressions -- falling by seven points to San Antonio, seven to Phoenix, seven 
to Portland, seven to the Lakers in another recent meeting, four to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, that won't allow Casey to keep his job, though he said he has not 
been told anything. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought our guys, despite what anybody else thinks, played to their ability 
at this juncture," he said, sounding like a man making a last defense. "I think 
we extended them (the Lakers). That's a team that wins 50 to 60 games a year, 
and a bunch of young guys played them close. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, the meeting should be very simple. We are discussing the situation and 
it should either be: A, you are the coach now; B, you are not the coach now; C, 
you have a place in this organization after being with us seven years; or D, 
hit the road. I don't know what you have to take a lot of time with. I am not 
on that jury." 
</P>
<P>
He paused. 
</P>
<P>
"But I would be an excellent tiebreaker." 
</P>
<P>
He smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"My feelings in this business change with the wind. When you're not hearing 
anything, you grope to watch body language, whether you get an Easter card, 
things like that. But those are things you can't control. Just like I can't 
control meetings I'm not in attendance at. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm only hearing the conjecture that you guys are hearing. But nothing would 
surprise me." 
</P>
<P>
Clipper-Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson had 30 points, 12 assists and eight rebounds for the Lakers and 
James Worthy added 28 points on 12-of-13 shooting. Danny Manning led the 
Clippers with 30 points. . . . As expected, Byron Scott did not dress because 
of a sprained left ankle, and the Lakers are hoping he will be ready to 
practice Tuesday. The new lineup had a three-forward offense with Orlando 
Woolridge added.

THE NFL DRAFT; 
</P>
<P>
RAMS; 
</P>
<P>
AT NO. 23, THEY MAY TRY TO TRADE UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sorry, no more April draft showers for the Rams, who saddle up for today's NFL 
player raffle as commoners after hand-selecting 10 of the top 112 prospects the 
last two years. 
</P>
<P>
Which reminds us, did the Rams ever formally thank Eric Dickerson for 
unhitching his mouthpiece in 1987? Let's see, that was three first-round picks, 
three seconds and a toss-in tailback, Greg Bell, who rushed for 2,349 yards and 
scored 33 touchdowns in two seasons, all for less than $1 million in salary. 
</P>
<P>
Quite a clearance sale for the trading of a probable former tailback and 
soon-to-be cable television football analyst. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the Rams aren't through working Dickerson's exponential trade 
power. After sapping Bell for two productive, cost-effective seasons, the team 
is ready to pass him on to the highest bidder in exchange for quality defensive 
help after acquiring former Seattle tailback Curt Warner, AstroTurf-cheap, at a 
recent Plan B fire sale. 
</P>
<P>
The chances of using Bell's value to trade up from their 23rd spot in today's 
first round aren't as great as peddling him in a trade for a competent 
defender, Ram Coach John Robinson said, conceding that Bell's running papers 
lack only rubber-stamp and delivery. 
</P>
<P>
"The die has been kind of cast there," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the two past years, though, today's draft won't pass without a few 
yawns. The Rams have three choices in the first four rounds, having 
relinquished their fourth choice to Detroit last summer in exchange for tight 
end Pat Carter. After picking 23rd, the Rams don't select again until No. 49 in 
the second round. 
</P>
<P>
"We can go out for lunch and come back after each draft pick," Robinson said. 
"It'll be much more of a businesslike draft, and the names will be much more 
businesslike." 
</P>
<P>
Meaning you probably won't recognize any of today's choices, unless you're 
blood-related to either Brigham Young University guard Mohammed Elewonibi or 
Washington center Bern Brostek. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams picked the wrong year to go shopping for offensive linemen and 
defensive backs, but those are their areas of greatest need in a draft replete 
with quarterbacks and running backs, Ram positions of least concern. 
</P>
<P>
"In the defensive secondary and offensive line, there will probably be fewer 
players taken in the first round than in most years," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams need an offensive lineman of the future for three good reasons and 
ages -- tackle Jackie Slater, 36 in May; tackle Irv Pankey, 32, and center Doug 
Smith, 33. The Rams wouldn't be sweating this one out had Mike Schad, the 
Canadian, worked out in 1986, or had either Warren Wheat or Kevin Robbins not 
been lost to waiver-wire roster juggling in September. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to find a guy," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the best guy in this year's draft, Texas A&amp;M tackle Richmond 
Webb, is almost a lock to be taken early, leaving the Rams to scour a field of 
Elewonibis, Brosteks, or perhaps an Iowa State center named Keith Sims. 
</P>
<P>
The danger here is taking a player just to fill a need while passing over a 
superior athlete. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said: "You can't identify a weakness and say, 'We need a wide 
receiver,' and then take a wide receiver who isn't any good." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are preparing for several scenarios, ready to take advantage of any 
draft-day strangeness, such as last year's first-round plunge of safety Louis 
Oliver, a projected top-10 choice who dropped to 25th before Miami scooped him 
up. Oliver turned out to be a terrific pick. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the odds of the Rams trading up and landing a potential standout -- 
Alabama linebacker Keith McCants, USC's Junior Seau or Miami defensive tackle 
Cortez Kennedy -- appear remote. Robinson said the first round consists of 
eight or nine great players and then levels out considerably. 
</P>
<P>
Even with Bell and running back Gaston Green at his disposal to use as trade-up 
bait, Robinson said it will be difficult to pull a draft-day trigger. 
</P>
<P>
"The only advantage is to move up past (No.) 10 into picks eight, seven, six or 
five," he explained. "But you pay a hellacious price to do that. Moving up from 
23 to 15 doesn't seem an advantage." 
</P>
<P>
If, inexplicably, a premier player should fall down to, say, position 13 or 14, 
then the Rams might make a move. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd move up for Cortez Kennedy," Robinson said. "You'd move up for Seau, 
you'd move up for McCants. And if Richmond Webb was your fancy, you'd move up 
for him. Then I think you're on the phone." 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback is another concern for the Rams, who are moving forward with plans 
to shift Pro Bowl cornerback Jerry Gray back to his natural position, free 
safety. That leaves as 1990 starters the second-year tandem of Darryl Henley 
and Alfred Jackson, both of whom lack measurable experience. Jackson has soared 
up the depth chart since arriving as a fifth-round pick from San Diego State in 
1989 after finishing his college career as a wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
"Cornerback is a big need on this football team," Robinson explained. "But the 
first place you'd look to solve it is Darryl Henley and A.J. Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson is quick to remind that the San Francisco 49ers not only survived the 
1986 season with two rookies at the corners, Don Griffin and Tim McKyer, they 
won the division. 
</P>
<P>
If Fresno State's J.D. Williams, the top cornerback prospect, should last until 
pick No. 23, the Rams would take him. Robinson would also consider 
safety/athlete-types such as USC's Mark Carrier and Notre Dame's Pat Terrell, 
but thinks that most of this year's cornerbacks are second-round material. 
</P>
<P>
If the Rams don't draft a cornerback, look for the team to use Bell to obtain a 
veteran in a trade. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost impossible to trade for the elite corner," Robinson said. "The 
competent corner, I think you can trade for. I think that will be ongoing for 
us through training camp." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Robinson doesn't think the Rams will draft a No. 3 quarterback this 
year, despite losing a developmental left-hander, Jeff Carlson, to Plan B free 
agency. The plan is to use a top pick next year or in 1992 for a quarterback; 
Jim Everett will be pushing 30 by then. "That gives you seven years' difference 
there," Robinson said. . . . Robinson said he is not upset that second-year 
running back Cleveland Gary recently signed a minor league baseball contract 
with the Montreal Expos. "I think it's great," Robinson said. "We're going to 
get him enough. We'll get him for a full training camp. I don't think there's 
any problem there." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams will probably draft two offensive linemen to battle for one open line 
position. . . . Robinson is experimenting with a new defense that involves more 
down pass rushers on first down. "Passing on first down against us is a 
problem," Robinson said. "There will be some changes made, not that I want to 
discuss that much."

SANDERS' SUCCESS HELPED OPEN FLOODGATES TO UNDERCLASSMEN; TODAY, 38 JUNIORS TO 
TRY LUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a 20-year-old college junior, Barry Sanders came out of Oklahoma State last 
summer, carrying the Heisman Trophy and a football, to make the NFL game look 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his inexperience, Sanders, the running back in a run-and-shoot offense, 
averaged 5.3 yards a try, led the NFC in yards gained, became the Detroit 
Lions' MVP and finished as the league's consensus rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for a junior. Hardly anyone else, in fact, ever did all that after a 
big year as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
Nor was the feat lost on other underclassmen. And so as the NFL's 55th annual 
player-distribution process begins at 9 a.m., PDT, today, a record 38 college 
juniors will head for the pros in what may be remembered someday as the Barry 
Sanders memorial draft. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the 38, conceivably, are as talented as Sanders, who will shortly 
begin his second pro season after his first year at Detroit's Oakland 
University, where, continuing as a role model for junior dropouts, he toiled as 
a transfer student this spring. 
</P>
<P>
If not as gifted as Sanders, some, nonetheless, will be drafted in the first 
round. As many as a dozen juniors could go in the first two rounds, starting 
with Illinois quarterback Jeff George, the No. 1 pick. 
</P>
<P>
Other juniors preferred over most seniors are USC linebacker Junior Seau, 
Alabama linebacker Keith McCants, Florida running back Emmitt Smith, Houston 
quarterback Andre Ware, Houston linebacker Lamar Lathon and USC safety Mark 
Carrier. 
</P>
<P>
The Indianapolis Colts signed George after a trade with the Atlanta Falcons, 
who won the top draft choice for the second time in three years. 
</P>
<P>
That's been the fashion in recent Aprils -- signing the year's No. 1 pick a day 
or two before the draft process begins. 
</P>
<P>
George signed a six-year, $15-million contract, but it remains to be seen if he 
can play in the NFL. Using a high pick on an inexperienced junior is somewhat 
like using a blind date to find a wife or husband. 
</P>
<P>
But this is a year in which, according to many scouts, much of the real quality 
is coming out of the junior class. They say there are only three Pro Bowl types 
in the entire draft -- two of them juniors, Seau and McCants, plus senior 
running back Blair Thomas of Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
George doesn't rank with Seau, McCants and Thomas -- in the collective wisdom 
of the scouts -- but Cortez Kennedy might. A Miami senior, Kennedy is a 
290-pound defensive tackle. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Steinberg, the general manager of the New York Jets, would take Kennedy 
over almost any junior. 
</P>
<P>
"Drafting juniors is a bad idea whose time has come," Steinberg said. "The 
problem is that there's no way to know if they'll ever develop. The NFL doesn't 
want juniors. They aren't mentally ready, they aren't physically ready, and 
their skills are not refined. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of them do have the skills, though. The juniors have made this into a 
super draft -- the best we've had in eight years -- even if it is a grab bag." 
</P>
<P>
There's so much uncertainty that the scouts can't even agree on a junior as 
visible as George. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL's two New York general managers, for example, Steinberg and George 
Young of the Giants, differ pointedly on the young athlete's value. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg is generally pro-George. "Physically, he's got everything, including 
the intangibles," the Jet chief said. "He's the sort to win championships for 
you." 
</P>
<P>
Young, however, is in the majority, which tends to be lukewarm on George. "He 
is one of the best quarterbacks on the board this year," the Giant general 
manager said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best? And he's the top pick? What a year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE PASSERS 
</P>
<P>
There are plenty of talented running backs and linebackers available, but long 
before 1999, the passers drafted today will have made a bigger impact than any 
other group. 
</P>
<P>
This is the view of many NFL scouts, who have concluded that the quarterback 
class of 1990 could even surpass that of 1983, which began with John Elway and 
ended with Dan Marino. 
</P>
<P>
Said Young: "We're seeing more quarterbacks than ever this year -- more that 
will eventually be (successful) players down the line." 
</P>
<P>
From Dallas, Bob Ackles, the Cowboys' chief scout, said: "Schools that send up 
a quarterback every century or so are in it this year. Take Mike Buck of 
Maine." 
</P>
<P>
Ackles, Steinberg, Buffalo's Bill Polian and others won't be surprised if five 
or six starting quarterbacks come out of the following group today: 
</P>
<P>
Jeff George, 6-3, 212, Illinois (junior): Although he could use another year or 
two of college seasoning, George "has been well trained by (Illini Coach) John 
Mackovic," Steinberg said. "He has the size, arm and touch." 
</P>
<P>
Andre Ware, 6-2, 206, Houston (junior): Downgraded at first this year because 
he played in the run-and-shoot offense, which showcases average passers, Ware, 
the Heisman Trophy winner, has moved up in the ratings with every tryout for 
the scouts. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Mitchell, 6-6, 229, Utah (junior): A left-hander, Mitchell throws "a 
nice, catchable ball (while) rolling to his left," according to Joel Buchsbaum, 
Pro Football Weekly's personnel expert. If so, he will trouble NFL defenses. 
</P>
<P>
Cary Conklin, 6-4, 215, Washington: Steinberg said: "This man has the size and 
all the physical tools." The draft's best senior quarterback, Conklin lost $1 
million or more when the juniors came out. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Tom Willis, 6-2, 188, Florida State: Well drilled for five years on Bobby 
Bowden's passing team, Willis has the polish that the juniors lack. He also has 
"most of their tools (but) not their size," Steinberg said. Buchsbaum calls him 
"one of the best, if not the very best, (quarterback) prospect." 
</P>
<P>
Troy Taylor, 6-3, 200, California: Smart, slender, Taylor has the good passing 
mechanics that most of the others would like to have. 
</P>
<P>
John Friesz, 6-4, 210, Idaho: From Dallas, Ackles singled out Friesz as one of 
the day's top two or three quarterback prospects. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Buck, 6-3, 220, Maine: Highly rated for his arm, poise, judgment and 
mobility, Buck has had a knee problem. 
</P>
<P>
Major Harris, 6-0, 208, West Virginia: "Despite his size, Harris rates in this 
group somewhere," Ackles said. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Rice, 6-0, 200, Notre Dame: The team that takes Rice will get a superb 
running back who can become an NFL passer. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Hodson, 6-2, 190, Louisiana State: They say he needs only consistency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE RUNNERS 
</P>
<P>
Quality NFL running backs are in such short supply to begin with, and tend, 
secondly, to wear out so fast, that most pro teams value a bumper crop of 
runners above all other kinds of draft prospects. So, today will be Christmas 
for many NFL coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more good backs than anything else in this draft," Young said. "Of 
the 38 juniors coming out, 15 are running backs." 
</P>
<P>
Named below are the best of about 75 above-average candidates, as voted on by 
Steinberg, Young, Ackles and two other scouts who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, none of us are telling the truth," Young said. "No writer should 
believe any scout in the last three weeks before the draft." 
</P>
<P>
The consensus: 
</P>
<P>
Blair Thomas, 5-10 1/2, 194, Penn State: One coach said: "If Thomas hadn't 
missed a full college season with a knee injury, they would be comparing him 
now with Hall of Famers." 
</P>
<P>
Emmitt Smith, 5-9 1/2, 200, Florida (junior): Buchsbaum calls Smith a Walter 
Payton type. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Green, 6-1, 215, South Carolina: "We're considering Green," said chief 
scout Joe Mendes of the New England Patriots, who draft third. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Thompson, 6-1, 219, Minnesota: The durable Gopher has the acceleration 
that offensive coaches want. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Hampton, 5-11, 210, Georgia (junior): As a sophomore, Hampton was good 
enough to alternate with last spring's No. 1 Steeler, Tim Worley. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Broussard, 5-6 1/4, 200, Washington State: Broussard has great speed, 
hands and power. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Thompson, 5-11, 207, Indiana: The first-round quality runs deep enough, 
perhaps, to include the Heisman runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Cobb, 5-11, 215, Tennessee (junior): Cobb has first-round talent and 
off-field problems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LINEBACKERS 
</P>
<P>
Of the linebackers on the board, "The top 10 or 12 divide into two groups," 
Ackles said. "Good, and great." 
</P>
<P>
Some of them: 
</P>
<P>
Junior Seau, 6-2, 240, USC (junior): After growing up in Samoa, Seau learned to 
speak English at 7, and he is still an inexperienced player -- though quite 
possibly the class player of this draft. 
</P>
<P>
Keith McCants, 6-4, 258, Alabama (junior): Equally unpolished, but with even 
more talent, McCants apparently has an attitude problem. 
</P>
<P>
Others: 
</P>
<P>
Lamar Lathon, Houston junior, and the following are linebackers with presumed 
first-round talent: Chris Singleton, Arizona; Darion Conner, Jackson State; 
James Francis, Baylor; Percy Snow, Michigan State and Ron Cox, Fresno State 
junior. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DEFENSIVE LINEMEN 
</P>
<P>
Only one stands out, and only three -- about half as many as in other years -- 
seem to have first-round skills: 
</P>
<P>
Cortez Kennedy, 6-1 1/2, 290, Miami: Said Steinberg of this probable high 
first-round choice: "Kennedy is the kind of defensive tackle you have to 
account for on every snap." 
</P>
<P>
Reynaldo Turnbull of West Virginia and Ray Agnew of North Carolina State are 
other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DEFENSIVE BACKS 
</P>
<P>
No two scouts have the same opinion of the best defensive backs in what they 
say is another slim talent field. The leaders: 
</P>
<P>
Ben Smith, Georgia; Mark Carrier, USC junior; Pat Terrell, Notre Dame, and 
James Williams, Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE OTHERS 
</P>
<P>
The pickings are even slimmer in the offensive line and at tight end. As for 
wide receiver -- where the Philadelphia Eagles have a need -- Coach Buddy Ryan 
said: "There's no wide receiver out there that I'd give a No. 1 for." 
</P>
<P>
The leaders: 
</P>
<P>
Offensive lineman: Richmond Webb, Texas A&amp;M. 
</P>
<P>
Tight end: Eric Green, Liberty. 
</P>
<P>
Wide receiver: Reggie Rembert, West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE AREA 
</P>
<P>
Of the dozens of draft-eligible players watched last season on Southland 
football fields, Seau and Carrier of USC are expected to be the first chosen 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 1 UCLA pick, the scouts say, will be Charles Arbuckle, one of the top 
three tight ends in the draft, or offensive lineman Frank Cornish. 
</P>
<P>
Others: 
</P>
<P>
USC: backs Leroy Holt and Aaron Emanuel, tight end Scott Galbraith, receiver 
John Jackson, linemen Bill Schultz, Dan Owens, Tim Ryan, Brad Leggett and Brent 
Parkinson, linebackers Delmar Chesley and Michael Williams, and defensive backs 
Cleveland Colter, Ernest Spears and Dwayne Garner. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA: back Mike Farr, defensive lineman Mike Lodish; offensive linemen Keith 
Jacobson and Rick Meyer, and linebackers Marvcus Patton and Craig Davis. 
</P>
<P>
CS Fullerton: back Mike Pringle, lineman Reggie Redding, defensive lineman John 
Bavaro, linebacker Harold Jones. 
</P>
<P>
CS Long Beach: receiver Derek Washington, linemen Cornelius Harrell and Dave 
McKinnon. 
</P>
<P>
CS Northridge: lineman Barry Voorhees, defensive back Willie James. 
</P>
<P>
NFL Notes 
</P>
<P>
The teams expect to complete five rounds of the draft today. They have agreed 
to begin no new round after 6 p.m., PDT, and will finish Monday, starting at 7 
a.m. . . . Commissioner Paul Tagliabue will preside at draft headquarters, New 
York's Marriott Marquis Hotel. The draft will be televised by ESPN. . . . Only 
25 teams will participate in the first round. The three others -- Dallas, 
Denver and Phoenix -- used their picks in last summer's supplemental lottery.

NAMES AND NUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
Misleading: The Houston Astros have had a reputation for outstanding pitching, 
but they have not had a productive starter come out of their farm system since 
James Rodney Richard in 1971. In fact, there are only five Houston farm 
products currently on major league pitching staffs: Dave Smith and Charlie 
Kerfeld of the Astros, Don August and Mark Knudson of the Milwaukee Brewers and 
Pat Perry, who is on the Dodgers' disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
Relief From Relief: With Steve Bedrosian burdened by his son's battle with 
leukemia, the San Francisco Giants' bullpen was 0-4 with one save in five 
opportunities and a 6.08 earned-run average entering a weekend series in San 
Diego. And against left-handers, Dan Quisenberry's famed sinker wasn't sinking. 
They were five of seven vs. Quiz, not including three sacrifice flies. 
</P>
<P>
Nasty, Indeed: Randy Myers packed his camouflage fatigues, plastic hand 
grenades and Soldier of Fortune magazines when he left the New York Mets for 
the Cincinnati Reds, where he unveiled his macho manner and material and said 
that, henceforth, the Reds' bullpen would be known as the Nasty Boys. A 
definition of nasty? Through Thursday and an 8-0 start, the Reds bullpen had a 
4-0 record with five saves and a 1.86 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
House of Tudor: Coming back from the arm problems that sidelined him for almost 
the entire 1989 season with the Dodgers, John Tudor has made two victorious 
starts for the St. Louis Cardinals, allowing no runs in 13 innings. "This is 
definitely far above my expectations," he said. "I don't think anyone could say 
they anticipated this. It's been a long time since I felt this good this early, 
but I don't think anyone knows how I'll hold up over 30 or 35 starts. I hope it 
continues, but there's no guarantee. The hitters aren't hitting my mistakes 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
Oil Canese: The Montreal Expos pulled out a 5-4 victory over the Philadelphia 
Phillies Monday although Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd left after five innings, 
trailing 4-2. "It was one of them nights, but the only thing I care about is 
whether we won," Boyd said. "Looking at it like that I kind of think I held 
them to a good deficit . . . know what I mean?" ROSS NEWHAN

OPTIMISM EVAPORATES QUICKLY IN ATLANTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN

<TEXT>
<P>
The Cincinnati Reds might be April's hot story, but it's Atlanta that is 
burning -- the hopes of the Braves and their touted young pitching staff 
incinerating faster than you can say William Tecumseh Sherman. 
</P>
<P>
Unless there's a swift and dramatic change, owner Ted Turner might scorch both 
Russ Nixon, the manager, and Bobby Cox, the general manager, tossing in Mike 
Fratello, coach of his Atlanta Hawks, as kindling. 
</P>
<P>
Turner may have created the Goodwill Games, but the concept goes only so far. A 
1-8 record after Saturday's loss to the Reds isn't likely to create harmony. 
</P>
<P>
This was to be a fine season for the National League West's perennial cellar 
dwellers. In addition to promising pitching, the Braves had remodeled the 
lineup with the $5.7-million signing of free agent first baseman Nick Esasky 
and the acquisitions by trade of third baseman Jim Presley and catcher Ernie 
Whitt. 
</P>
<P>
It may still happen, but more than the pre-weekend madness of 1-8 has been the 
disturbing method. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Braves were outscored 70-28 in the nine games, allowed 10 or more hits 
in eight of them and opposing players collected three hits or more 14 times. 
The staff earned-run average was 7.63, and of the 28 times Nixon went to the 
bullpen, 17 times the reliever came on to allow at least one earned run. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The potential ace of the rotation, John Smoltz, is 1-7 since participating 
in last summer's All-Star game and 0-2 this year, the opposition hitting .444 
against him. The potential relief ace, Mike Stanton, had a 14.54 ERA based on 
seven earned runs in 4 1/3 innings after giving up only four earned runs in his 
final 44 innings at Richmond and Atlanta last year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Esasky was six of 35 after Saturday with no extra base hits, no runs batted 
in and was responsible for 15 of the 63 strikeouts the Braves had accumulated 
in 303 at-bats. Dale Murphy, seeking to shake two bad seasons, had nine 
strikeouts and seven hits in 34 at-bats, with one home run and four RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Whitt, batting .150, had thrown out only two of 18 base stealers and was 
exchanging oral jabs with his pitchers because of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see why some people can hold runners on and others can't," he said. 
"It should be an adjustment easily done. The pitcher should know when the 
runner goes and cut his release time accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've made only one bad throw. It's not like I'm throwing rainbows down 
there, but it's a definite concern and something has to be done." 
</P>
<P>
Said Pete Smith: "Nothing against Ernie, but he doesn't have one of the 
strongest arms in the world. At the same time, we as pitchers could do a better 
job of holding people on." 
</P>
<P>
Said Nixon, of the staggering start: "I never thought it could be this bad. I 
mean, I still think this could be a great club. I really had no idea." 
</P>
<P>
The status of the manager and general manager was considered uncertain going 
in. What might save them is that no one seems to be paying attention. Or cares. 
Atlanta apathy? 
</P>
<P>
The Braves were the only team in baseball not to draw a million each of the 
past two years. They averaged 13,917 in 1989 and 9,284 for the first five dates 
of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, two days after the Dayton Dynamo and Atlanta Attack drew 8,653 for 
an indoor soccer game there, the Braves and Reds attracted 6,484. 
</P>
<P>
Strange Twists: Juan Samuel, the Dodger leadoff man, appears to have responded 
aggressively to the center-field assignment. 
</P>
<P>
But Devon White, the Angel center fielder, continues to resist the leadoff 
role, irritating management with his lack of selectivity. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's Philadelphia's Len Dykstra, who once was considered a center-field 
candidate for the Dodgers and remains among the leadoff possibilities for the 
Angels if White is traded. Tim Raines of Montreal and Junior Felix of Toronto 
also are Angel candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Dykstra has heard all the rumors. "The Phillies have been good to me," he said. 
"They gave me the chance to play every day. I'm not saying I want to be traded, 
but if I had to be traded, the Angels and Dodgers would be one, two on my list. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up in Garden Grove. There were many times I rode my bike to Anaheim 
Stadium and found ways to sneak in. I'm moving back to Mission Viejo next 
winter. It (a trade) would complete the homecoming." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels and Phillies make a perfect trade match. The Angels have a surplus 
of the commodity the Phillies require -- pitching. 
</P>
<P>
A package is a possibility, although Dykstra said he talked with Philadelphia 
General Manager Lee Thomas in spring training and was told he would not be 
traded. Dykstra said he thought that if the Phillies traded anyone it would be 
Von Hayes, netting at least two starting pitchers in return. 
</P>
<P>
Dykstra, on the other hand, is more than a leadoff man and center fielder. His 
fiery personality is capable of igniting an unemotional team. A veteran Angel, 
reflecting on that the other day, said: "Of all the players I've heard 
mentioned in trade rumors, Lenny is the one I'd most like to see come here. We 
have a lot of guys who care and want to win, but they keep it to themselves. We 
need someone to come in and break some bats, rattle some bones." 
</P>
<P>
There is a theory that the departure of personalities such as Roger McDowell, 
Randy Myers, Wally Backman and Dykstra have cost the New York Mets their 
abrasive and aggressive flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Dykstra said he agrees with that and also finds it amusing that the Mets, 
concerned about Keith Miller's play amid overall defensive shortcomings (they 
committed 14 errors in 11 games), are again in the center-field market, having 
traded three center fielders in the past two years -- Samuel, Dykstra and 
Mookie Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mets have shown bad judgment," Dykstra said. "When you've got pitching 
like that, wouldn't you try to get a defense that can catch the ball?" 
</P>
<P>
Dykstra, in the meantime, is off to his best start. He entered a weekend series 
in St. Louis with the NL's second-best batting average. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not thinking about the rumors or anything else," he said. "I'm just trying 
to concentrate on playing, being consistent all year. I learned a lot playing 
every day during the last two months of last year and went home and wrote down 
some things I needed to do." 
</P>
<P>
One was to bulk up, get stronger. The 5-10, 165-pound Dykstra suddenly went to 
190. 
</P>
<P>
"I lifted some weights and took some real good vitamins," he said. "I feel a 
lot stronger. I just hope I can keep it on. I've already lost six pounds in a 
week. I mean, it's hard because your diet changes so much during the season 
with all those TWA specials." 
</P>
<P>
Doc on the Mend: After Dwight Gooden allowed 14 hits and 10 runs in the 7 2/3 
innings of his first two starts, both winless, there was a suspicion that the 
Mets' ace might have been tipping his pitches. 
</P>
<P>
No indication of that, however, when Gooden bounced back Thursday to go seven 
strong innings in a 4-1 victory over the Chicago Cubs, whose shortstop, Shawon 
Dunston, said: 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see him tip nothing. He was throwing a 95-mile-per-hour fastball on 
the inside corner. If he keeps that up, the only tipping is going to be the 
other team tipping their caps to him." 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs almost always do. 
</P>
<P>
Gooden has a 19-3 career record against them, winning seven in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Evoking memories of Ted Williams, Boston Red Sox outfielder Mike Greenwell 
attacked the New England media the other day, saying, "It's very tough to deal 
with those guys because you'd like to wring their necks. I would wring their 
necks if the law permitted it." 
</P>
<P>
This all started because of the few base hits ringing off Greenwell's bat. He 
was seven of 37 with no RBIs through Friday, compounding Boston's pitching 
woes. 
</P>
<P>
While Roger Clemens was 3-0 with a 4.12 ERA entering a weekend series in 
Milwaukee, the rest of the Boston staff was 2-4 with a 5.64 ERA, and there was 
no indication of immediate help for the three-deep rotation of Clemens, John 
Dopson and Mike Boddicker. 
</P>
<P>
"I started looking (for pitching) last June," General Manager Lou Gorman said. 
"I understand the fans' frustration because I'm as frustrated as anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the Texas Rangers are getting nothing after Nolan Ryan and Kevin 
Brown. The Rangers, through Friday, were 5-0 in games Ryan and Brown started, 
0-6 when others started. Last year, they were 36-24 in the Ryan and Brown 
starts, 47-55 otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
A solid start has served to defuse the always combustible New York Yankee 
environment. It's April, Pascual Perez has pitched 11 innings without allowing 
an earned run and Dave Winfield, one of George Steinbrenner's favorite punching 
bags, says: "What's starting to happen here isn't luck. Some very positive 
signs are emerging. There is emotion in the clubhouse. There is a unity that I 
haven't seen for quite a while. We have the offense and pitching to do it as a 
team. There are no great pitching stars, but a lot of good, solid guys." 
</P>
<P>
The torrid start of Red shortstop Barry Larkin would seem to suggest batting 
tips from Manager Lou Piniella, the former Yankee manager and hitting 
instructor, but Larkin, 22 of 39 through Saturday, said he couldn't adapt to 
Piniella's style. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried it, but I couldn't use his philosophy," Larkin said. "It wasn't 
something I was comfortable with. It's more a long-ball swing and I'm not a 
home run hitter." 
</P>
<P>
Have Piniella and San Diego Padre Manager Jack McKeon turned over new leaves? 
</P>
<P>
Piniella, who played for McKeon in 1973 in Kansas City, wrote in his 1986 
autobiography that McKeon is "a champion second-guesser. I didn't like his 
manner, his tone of voice, his sarcasm, and the feeling was mutual. He didn't 
like me very much. I couldn't play for the man." 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, McKeon wrote in his own book that Piniella was "the most 
selfish player I've ever seen. In my first spring training, I lectured them 
every morning on baseball. A couple of veterans thought it was a waste, but 
mainly it was Lou Piniella. He's the one who undermined me." 
</P>
<P>
In response to questions this week, Piniella said he respects McKeon, and 
McKeon said: "We don't have any problems. I'd like to think we can see past 
whatever happened 17 or 18 years ago."

NEWSWIRE: BYERS: TARKANIAN 'BEAT SYSTEM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former NCAA chief Walter Byers says Nevada Las Vegas basketball Coach Jerry 
Tarkanian "beat the system" in his 13-year battle with the governing body of 
college sports. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a man who worked the system and beat the system," Byers said in his first 
interview since retiring as executive director in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a legal bromide about justice delayed is justice denied. The story of 
this case proves that." 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA ordered a two-year suspension of Tarkanian in 1977 after an 
investigation of the UNLV program, but the coach obtained an injunction 
preventing any action against him. The injunction was overturned by the U.S. 
Supreme Court in 1988, but the NCAA still hasn't decided whether to take 
further action. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV's recent NCAA championship convinced Byers to rewrite a chapter in his 
upcoming autobiography that deals with the Tarkanian affair.

Uwe Krupp, a West German defenseman who plays with the Buffalo Sabres, tested 
positive for a banned drug after a World Hockey Championship game, West German 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Krupp's urine sample showed traces of an illegal drug, Helmut Bauer, technical 
director of the West German team, told the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what it is, but Uwe told me he took some sleeping pills when 
flying from the United States to the championships," Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
The first doping test was carried out after West Germany's 3-0 loss to 
Czechoslovakia on Friday. It must be confirmed by a second test, which will 
processed in a lab at Cologne, West Germany. That lab is approved by the 
International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Krupp did not answer his telephone at the West Germans' team headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Krupp, a 25-year-old defenseman, has played for Buffalo for four seasons.

Mike Racanelli of Ohio State continued to dominate the individual portion of 
the NCAA men's gymnastics meet by winning medals in five of the six individual 
events Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Racanelli, a senior who won the separate all-around competition earlier in the 
day, won the floor exercise and placed in the top six -- the requirement for 
All-American status -- in the other five. 
</P>
<P>
Racanelli was the only gymnast to qualify for all six events during 
preliminaries Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's Chris Waller created the most excitement of the evening when his 
horizontal bar routine -- the final routine of the night -- drew 10.0 scores 
from two judges. His final score was a 9.975, the highest score of the meet. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA and Penn State each had two individual titlists. Brad Hayashi was UCLA's 
other champion, winning the vault. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State's Mark Sohn defended his title on the pommel horse by scoring a 
9.900. Sohn, the only 1989 champion who returned to defend his title, beat 
Arizona State's Christian Rohde, who had a 9.850. Penn State's Wayne Cowden had 
a 9.900 on the rings to edge Chainey Umphrey of UCLA for first place. 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska, the national team champion, had three gymnasts make All-America in 
two events. Freshman Trent Dimas took second in the horizontal bar and floor 
exercise. Patrick Kirksey won the parallel bars and was third in the pommel 
horse, and Mark Warburton was third on the parallel bars and sixth on the 
rings.

SANTA ANITA; 
</P>
<P>
FIELD FOR SAN JUAN COMES UP SHORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In terms of quantity, the 51st running of the $500,000 San Juan Capistrano 
today is lacking. 
</P>
<P>
Only seven horses entered the 1 3/4-mile marathon on the next-to-last program 
of Santa Anita's 90-day meeting. 
</P>
<P>
To most observers, only three members of the field have a realistic shot at the 
$275,000 top prize -- Hawkster, El Senor and Frankly Perfect. Live The Dream, 
Delegant, Valdali and Santangelo all seem mere pretenders. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Tufts' morning line reinforces this belief. Santa Anita's linemaker 
established El Senor the 8-5 favorite, Hawkster is 9-5, Frankly Perfect 5-2, 
then comes Valdali, Live The Dream and Delegant all at 15-1 and Santangelo is 
20-1. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy for Hawkster in the Capistrano will be simple. He will go right to 
the lead and attempt to become the first horse to go wire-to-wire in the Grade 
I race since Obraztsovy held off Exploded in 1981. The year before, John Henry 
won in the same fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkster's jockey and trainer, Pat Valenzuela and Ron McAnally, are both 
familiar with those two victories. Valenzuela rode Obraztsovy for the 
then-biggest win of his career and McAnally was John Henry's boss. 
</P>
<P>
After two futile attempts on the dirt, a surface he hasn't won on since the 
fall of 1988, Hawkster opened up on his five rivals in last month's San Luis 
Rey with some fast fractions. Not until the final yards was he collared by 
Prized, who is unbeaten in three starts on the turf and who has earned himself 
a place as one of the nation's premier thoroughbreds. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkster will be carrying three fewer pounds today and his recent works 
indicate he has lost none of his sharpness. It also doesn't hurt that front 
runners have been doing well in the waning weeks of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Frankly Perfect had a two-race winning streak end in the 1 1/2-mile San Luis 
Rey. He broke a trifle slowly, then was the first one to take a run at 
Hawkster. He came up empty late and wound up third, beaten by two lengths. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Whittingham, who is seeking his 15th win in this race, thought the 
5-year-old Perrault horse moved too soon last time and says he has been 
training well. 
</P>
<P>
Frankly Perfect will also be making his first start for new owner Jerry Buss. 
The Lakers' owner purchased an interest in the horse, who is also owned by the 
Kings' Bruce McNall and Wayne Gretzky. Presumably, Buss bought the same 
interest in the horse which, for a short time, belonged to actor Sylvester 
Stallone. 
</P>
<P>
Without question, El Senor was finishing fastest in the San Luis Rey. Far back 
early, the 6-year-old roan really took hold late and was beaten by only a 
half-length by Frankly Perfect. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first start of the year for the son of Valdez, who hadn't been out 
since finishing seventh in the Breeders' Cup Turf. He figures to move forward 
off that race and the additional distance certainly won't be a hinderance. 
</P>
<P>
If any of the others are to spring an upset, Live The Dream, Charlie 
Whittingham's other entrant, is the most likely. He lost ground the entire 
journey in the 1 1/2-mile San Luis Obispo Feb. 19 in an effort that was much 
better than his eighth-place finish would indicate. 
</P>
<P>
Distance shouldn't pose a problem for the Northern Baby colt and he will carry 
eight fewer pounds than Frankly Perfect, seven fewer than Hawkster and five 
fewer than El Senor. 
</P>
<P>
Delegant, who is trained by Michael Whittingham, finished fifth in the San Luis 
Rey. He drops 11 pounds off that race, but he wasn't able to beat Frankly 
Perfect when the latter had trouble in the San Luis Obispo and he was getting 
eight pounds that day. 
</P>
<P>
Valdali was a distant third at 8-5 against much weaker competition. His only 
pluses are that he can go a mile and three quarters and he'll be ridden by Gary 
Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
The only good race Santangelo has run since coming to this country from South 
America was on the dirt. He was second to Opening Verse in a Feb. 15 allowance 
race. Nor was he disgraced when fifth in the Santa Anita Handicap. So, 
naturally, he's trying the grass again, where he has finished 10th, seventh and 
fourth in three U.S. tries and has failed in 16 of 18 attempts lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing his love affair with the Santa Anita hillside sprint course, Coastal 
Voyage made even-money look like a gift with an easy victory in the $102,500 
San Simeon Handicap Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Successful in four of five starts on the unique turf layout, the 6-year-old 
Coastal horse beat Patchy Groundfog by 2 3/4 lengths while covering about 6 1/2 
furlongs in 1:12 1/5. Raise A Stanza was third and Wonder Dancer last in the 
compact field. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a good day for the barn," said Eduardo Inda, McAnally's assistant. 
Earlier, Silver Ending had scored a 6-1 surprise in the Arkansas Derby. "It's 
nice to win for Ron. He's just a super boss." 
</P>
<P>
Ridden by Alex Solis, Coastal Voyage earned $60,000 for owner John Brunetti 
with his eighth victory in 15 career starts and returned $4. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Laffit Pincay escaped serious injury when Another Lady flipped in the gate 
shortly before the second race was to start. "I got pinned down there," said 
Pincay, who missed the third race, then returned for the rest of the card. "I 
was very tight and all the weight was on my leg. I really thought she broke it. 
The muscles on both side of my knee are sore, but there was no damage to the 
bone. It hurts when I walk, but not when I ride. I'll put more ice on it 
tonight and see how it feels tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, Forty Niner Days was the lukewarm 3-1 favorite at Santa Anita for 
the simulcast of the California Derby from Golden Gate. Forty Niner Days, who 
showed brief speed and stopped, was 7-1 up north.

SILVER ENDING SURVIVES FOUL CLAIM, BEATS REAL CASH IN THE ARKANSAS DERBY

Southland-based Silver Ending, a bargain basement purchase, survived a foul 
claim to win the Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn and earn a trip to the Kentucky 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Silver Ending was eighth in the early going, but he made his move along the 
rail and passed several horses in the far turn. 
</P>
<P>
Jockey Gary Stevens then squeezed the colt inside of Southland-based Real Cash 
and went on to win by 3 1/4 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Santos, who rode runner-up Real Cash, filed a foul claim against Silver 
Ending, saying the colt veered out in the turn. But the stewards upheld the 
victory for Silver Ending. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Ron McAnally, who paid only $1,500 for Silver Ending at a yearling 
sale, said he would take the colt to Louisville for the Kentucky Derby May 5. 
</P>
<P>
Silver Ending covered the 1 1/8 miles on a good track in 1:48 and returned 
$14.20, $7.60 and $5.80 as the third choice in the field of 13. The colt earned 
$300,000, increasing his career total to $668,900. 
</P>
<P>
Real Cash, part of a Wayne Lukas-trained entry, paid $9.20 and $11.40. Bright 
Again, the favorite who was second to Summer Squall in the Jim Beam, was never 
far off the lead but finished seventh. 
</P>
<P>
At Keeneland: Go for Wand charged into the lead midway down the backstretch and 
scored a five-length victory in the $224,000 Ashland Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 juvenile filly champion ran the 1 1/16 miles in 1:43 3/5 in the mud. 
</P>
<P>
At Garden State: Wind Splitter rallied from well off the pace to win the 
$114,000 Trenton Handicap by 2 1/2 lengths over Loyal Pal.

As an 18-year-old viewer of "The Outsiders," I think Fox has the best midseason 
replacement series on television. The six actors who portray S. E. Hinton's 
beloved characters are right on target. These young men -- Robert Russler, 
Harold Pruett, Boyd Kestner, Rodney Harvey, Jay Ferguson and David Arquette -- 
certainly spice the series.

MILKEN SOUGHT TO PROTECT BROTHER AND AVOID A TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS FRANTZ and SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Milken expects to go to prison and gave up his fight against securities 
charges to obtain dismissal of the counts against his brother and avoid the 
ordeal of a trial that he had come to doubt he could win, one of his closest 
friends and others said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Milken is scheduled to appear in federal court here Tuesday or Wednesday to 
plead guilty to six felony charges and agree to pay $600 million in penalties. 
The momentous actions will mark the end of the government's sweeping 
investigation of the Beverly Hills-based financier and former head of junk 
bonds for Drexel Burnham Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
But it remains uncertain whether the Milken deal signals the end of the 
government's probe into corruption on Wall Street or the start of a new phase. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Milken acknowledged Saturday that he has agreed to be 
questioned by federal prosecutors and attorneys for the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. But the sources said that Milken has not promised to provide 
information against specific individuals, a departure from most plea 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
Milken had maintained his innocence since his indictment 13 months ago. He 
began to seriously consider a plea bargain two weeks ago after prosecutors 
vowed to file an expanded list of charges if he did not agree to plead guilty 
by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The deadline had been set and he agonized over it every day, all the time," 
said Harry R. Horowitz, one of Milken's closest friends since their boyhood 
days in Encino and also a former executive at Drexel. "Certainly the No. 1 
factor was the dismissal of the charges against Lowell. He didn't make the 
decision until the very end. He is resigned to going to jail. He knows he has 
to serve time. But I think Michael made a choice for the future and not for the 
past." 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz and others close to Milken said Saturday that the financial wizard had 
come to doubt that he could be acquitted in a trial, although he still believed 
he was not guilty. Horowitz said the government was prepared to add another 100 
counts to the list of charges against him, a claim that could not be confirmed 
with prosecutors, who have refused to discuss the case. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz said that Milken overruled his wife, Lori, and other family members 
and friends in deciding to plead guilty. 
</P>
<P>
"I still do believe, as his wife believes, that he could fight and win and be 
vindicated," Horowitz said. "But unfortunately the damage that would be done on 
all sides in a long court case means everyone would end up a loser." 
</P>
<P>
Milken, 43, was indicted in March, 1989, on 98 charges of racketeering and 
criminal securities fraud, ranging from insider trading and market manipulation 
to concealing the true ownership of stocks. His brother and former aide, 
Lowell, 41, and former Drexel trader Bruce L. Newberg, were charged along with 
him. It is unclear how the agreement will affect Newberg. 
</P>
<P>
While sources have said the agreement grants Milken immunity from any future 
criminal prosecution, one source said his brother could face later charges if 
the government uncovers wrongdoing in the future. 
</P>
<P>
When sources close to Milken first disclosed Friday that he had agreed to plead 
guilty, they said the six counts will not include racketeering, which carries a 
20-year prison term, or insider trading. The sources said the pleas will come 
to charges with maximum terms of five years each and that prosecutors will 
recommend that he serve the sentences concurrently. 
</P>
<P>
If the judge agrees, Milken would probably face a maximum of five years in 
prison and could be eligible for parole after completing one-third of the time. 
</P>
<P>
The $600 million in penalties, the largest ever assessed against an individual, 
would not leave Milken broke. He posted $700 million in cash and assets when he 
was indicted and is said to be worth at least $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of cooperation was said to have been one of the most difficult in the 
negotiations, with Milken holding out against any cooperation at all. But 
several government officials, including SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden, were 
said to have been equally adamant that Milken be required to share what he 
knows. 
</P>
<P>
Although details remained unclear Saturday, sources indicated that the 
agreement will allow both sides to claim victory on the cooperation issue. 
Milken has agreed to be questioned extensively by the government, although 
interviews will not take place immediately. 
</P>
<P>
One source said that it was understood that Milken "would not sit down and go 
through a debriefing and turn over everyone (on whom) he had knowledge of 
criminal conduct." But the source said Milken could be used to corroborate 
information the government had obtained elsewhere. He said government 
interviews with Milken would not be under oath. 
</P>
<P>
Convicted stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky first implicated Milken as part of 
his deal with the government, and Boesky's allegations formed the basis for the 
initial charges. But in recent months prosecutors had secured the cooperation 
of other people close to Milken and the threatened second indictment was 
expected to be much stronger. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of Milken's cooperation is of no small concern to many powerful 
people who were his clients and may still be subjects of government 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
"You're talking about a lot of the leading lights in American industry," said 
one lawyer involved in the case. "If Mike did cooperate, there would be a lot 
of concerned people." 
</P>
<P>
Milken was involved in many of the largest corporate takeover fights of the 
1980s. And prosecutors and the SEC are known to have been interested in his 
involvement with big buyers of junk bonds, including First Executive Corp., the 
big Los Angeles life insurance concern headed by Fred Carr, and Beverly 
Hills-based Columbia Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
The extent of Milken's cooperation will not be known until full details of the 
deal are made public. But Milken's agreement to be interviewed leaves room for 
the government to claim that it is getting his cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the issue of what Milken agreed to, however, a perhaps more fundamental 
question is how enthusiastic the government is to continue the whole series of 
inquiries that grew out of the investigation of Drexel Burnham, which paid $650 
million last year after pleading guilty to six felonies and is closing its 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors in New York refused to discuss any aspect of the case. But 
other lawyers in the case or related investigations said the U.S. attorney's 
office in Manhattan appears to have little enthusiasm to bring new indictments. 
</P>
<P>
However, they said the SEC apparently intends to forge ahead with 
Drexel-related investigations. Breeden is said to be particularly eager to 
pursue cases related to the savings and loan industry. 
</P>
<P>
The criminal cases were begun in New York, when Rudolph W. Giuliani was the 
U.S. attorney in Manhattan. Giuliani appeared to have a particular lust for 
Wall Street cases that attracted great publicity. Some of his critics have 
suggested that his zeal may have been related to his later, unsuccessful run 
for mayor of New York. 
</P>
<P>
Giuliani's successor, Otto G. Obermaier, seems far less concerned about 
bringing cases that are likely to attract attention from the press. In any 
event, Obermaier has had to disqualify himself from supervising anything 
related to the Drexel investigation because his former law firm represented 
potential defendants. 
</P>
<P>
In the years since the Drexel investigation began, the U.S. attorney's office 
has had significant turnover. And the two assistant prosecutors assigned to the 
Milken case, John Carroll and Jess Fardella, are said to be eager to move on, 
probably to private practice. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer who knows the two prosecutors well said he thinks further criminal 
prosecution in New York is unlikely. "My sense is that it's over," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Alan R. Bromberg, a securities law professor at Southern Methodist University 
in Dallas, also sees the Milken deal as the end of the line for the Wall Street 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the capstone for the government's campaign against the securities 
industry," he said. "It now has the biggest scalp." 
</P>
<P>
CREDIT CRISIS 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the junk-bond market that Milken helped create has left some 
companies squeezed for credit. D1.

3 FAMILIES AWAIT WORD ON HOSTAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
FISHKILL, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three families, scattered across two continents, were keeping an anxious vigil 
this weekend to see whether the pro-Iranian kidnapers who have held their loved 
ones will deliver on their promise to release one of the captives, maybe as 
early as today. 
</P>
<P>
The faceless group that calls itself the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of 
Palestine has raised their hopes many times before over the past 1,184 days, 
but this time seems different. In many towns where relatives of the hostages 
live, optimistic neighbors are tying yellow ribbons to trees and buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The families' spirits got a big boost late Saturday when the State Department 
began notifying them that it expects one of the hostages to be freed within 24 
to 36 hours. It was the first time the government has been so encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty sure that someone will be released," says Ruth Polhill, whose 
55-year-old son, Robert, is one of the three captives. "If there is one, I'm 
not even allowing myself to think who that one might be." 
</P>
<P>
At first, she thought it would be Jesse Turner, because his picture was 
released by the kidnapers Wednesday, when they first announced they planned to 
let one of their three prisoners go. But the next day, when they put out an 
angry statement accusing the United States of being uncooperative and delaying 
the transfer, Robert Polhill's was the picture they included. 
</P>
<P>
Although the release appeared to be back on track Saturday, it was anyone's 
guess which hostage would be chosen. The faction holds Polhill, Turner and 
Alann Steen, who will mark his 51st birthday today. 
</P>
<P>
All three were professors at Beirut University College when they were abducted 
Jan. 24, 1987, by kidnapers who had made their way onto the campus disguised as 
riot police. A fourth captive, Indian-born Mithileshwar Singh, who has 
permanent resident status in the United States, was released in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Five other Americans are also being held, apparently by other factions. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Polhill, a slight, elderly widow, sat in her apartment here, monitoring 
television news for the latest developments and patiently answering a drumbeat 
of phone calls from reporters or concerned friends. Her living room is 
decorated with pictures of her son, family and the other hostages as well. 
</P>
<P>
One photo shows Ruth Polhill standing arm in arm with Singh's wife, and she 
also has framed a letter she got from President Bush. "God bless your son," the 
President wrote in his own hand at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
She rummaged through a drawerful of news clippings she has collected. Someday 
soon, Polhill hopes her son will see for himself the evidence that his family 
and his country never forgot about him while he was in captivity. Last 
Christmas, it seemed that half the county turned out when the town invited her 
to light a commemorative tree with 10,000 lights. 
</P>
<P>
The widow's Lebanese daughter-in-law, Firyal, has gone to Damascus to await the 
release. "She said she would be there to welcome whoever comes out," Ruth 
Polhill said. Polhill's two sons from his first marriage spent the weekend in 
their apartment in Queens "killing time -- watching gymnastics," 23-year-old 
Bryan Polhill said. "It's been all right. I'm trying not to ride a roller 
coaster." 
</P>
<P>
In Boise, Ida., a media battalion camped out in front of the three-bedroom 
white frame home of Estelle Ronneburg, Turner's 68-year-old mother. She left 
her front door unlocked and invited reporters who lounged on her wooden front 
porch to come in and watch late-night television. When one journalist showed up 
in a taxi, Ronneburg and her husband, Eugene, offered him the use of their car. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters brought the couple breakfast, lunch and dinner, and the Ronneburgs 
returned the favor by offering them a share of the food trays delivered by 
local grocery stores. A crew from CBS even arranged to have their lawn mowed -- 
an act of contrition, perhaps, for having trampled it. 
</P>
<P>
Ronneburg, too, has collected her own history of the anguish and uncertainty 
that she has known for more than three years. There are newspaper stories, 
letters from friends, and telexes from Lebanon. The darkest moments are marked 
by the clippings that report death threats, such as the one in 1987, when her 
son's captors said they would kill one of the hostages unless West Germany 
released a Lebanese man accused of hijacking an airliner. 
</P>
<P>
Just as heartbreaking were the erroneous reports of impending release. 
</P>
<P>
Before Singh was released, for example, the kidnapers raised her hopes by 
sending out pictures of her son and Steen. "I was devastated," Ronneburg said. 
"We were happy for Dr. Singh, but it was hard to take." 
</P>
<P>
This time, "I'm trying not to let myself become too excited, because I've been 
down this road before, and it's not fun when it doesn't work out," Ronneburg 
said. "But I can't help but hope and pray that my son is going to be released." 
</P>
<P>
Turner, like Polhill, is married to a Lebanese woman who still resides in the 
Middle East. His wife, Badr, was pregnant when he was abducted, and Turner has 
never seen his 2 1/2-year-old daughter, Joan. 
</P>
<P>
Steen has also missed important family milestones. Two daughters were married 
while he was in captivity, and he may not be aware that he now has a grandson 
who lives in Thousand Oaks and bears his name.

LOW-COST HOUSING AGENCY AIDS ITS CHIEF'S HOMETOWN

<P>
A state agency created to aid financially strapped renters and home buyers has 
increasingly used its $3.5 billion in bond proceeds to help those with 
above-average incomes buy homes -- particularly around Fresno, the hometown of 
the agency's director. 
</P>
<P>
A Times review of the performance of the California Housing Finance Agency -- 
picked by Gov. George Deukmejian to operate his proposed $2-billion first-time 
home buyers program -- shows that it has turned away from the heavily populated 
areas where the need for low-cost housing is greatest. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, five Central Valley counties have received more than half of the homes 
financed by the agency, with Fresno County getting more than any other since 
July 1, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno received twice as many agency-financed housing units as Los Angeles, 
Orange and San Diego counties combined -- an area with more than 20 times 
Fresno's population. 
</P>
<P>
The director of the agency, Karney Hodge, said that the tilt toward Fresno is 
beyond the agency's control and has nothing to do with his own ties to the 
community or to his friend and political patron, Senate Republican Leader Ken 
Maddy, who is also from Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
But critics of the housing finance agency charge that under Hodge, the agency 
has done little more than make reduced-interest mortgages available mostly to 
middle-income, first-time home buyers in parts of the state where land costs 
are cheap and housing is still relatively plentiful and affordable. 
</P>
<P>
And while the agency is run with businesslike efficiency -- winning an enviable 
AA rating on its massive bond issues -- it has also become a prime example of 
the workings of political patronage in California. 
</P>
<P>
Hodge, a clothing store owner and longtime civic activist, was Maddy's campaign 
treasurer from 1970, when the lawmaker first ran for the Legislature, until 
1983, when Maddy successfully persuaded Deukmejian to name his friend and 
political ally as housing finance director. The salary for the job, set by the 
agency's board, is $96,516 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Once established in his new position, Hodge hired several individuals with 
strong ties to Fresno or to Maddy. Among those brought into the agency were 
Maddy's sister, Marilyn Brazell, and Maddy's son Donald, as well as former 
Maddy legislative aide Fred Noteware. The Republican lawmaker, Brazell and 
Hodge are also part-owners of a condominium on Huntington Lake, a resort area 
about 50 miles northeast of Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
Both Maddy and Hodge say emphatically that there is no connection between their 
ties to Fresno and the drift of the agency's activity toward their hometown. 
</P>
<P>
Maddy said that he has never asked Hodge to direct agency loan money to his 
home district or to hire relatives. "I've never solicited or pushed or asked 
for any project per se," Maddy said in an interview. "I don't really have any 
knowledge of any particular project that (has) gone through." 
</P>
<P>
When asked about his hiring practices, Hodge said simply: "You go to people you 
know." 
</P>
<P>
On the high proportion of agency-financed housing going to Fresno in the last 
two budget years -- 16% of all homes and apartments -- Hodge told a reporter: 
"They're going there because of the market. There's no way to change that." 
</P>
<P>
However, Hodge and his staff say now that there will be changes. They plan to 
divide the state into six districts, each of which would get an equal share of 
housing mortgage money. (The new plan would give about 35% of the agency's home 
mortgage money to Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties, which combined 
make up 47% of the state's population.) 
</P>
<P>
Program director Noteware said that in the past the agency's senior staff met 
regularly to review bids from mortgage lenders and developers and committed its 
funds to those offering the lowest-cost housing without regard to location. 
Consequently, very little of the state money has gone to urban home buyers in 
expensive real estate markets. 
</P>
<P>
However, the agency's critics, including some members of the agency's own board 
of directors, say that the Fresno bias is symptomatic of an agency that has 
lost sight of its original purpose: to provide low-interest loans to home 
buyers with moderate incomes and for apartment developments that offer cheap 
rentals to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
"We did some things (to reach the poor)," said former board member James 
Hendricks, "but clearly it did not go far enough. I'd be the first to tell you 
I'm not proud of the scope and depth we went in this area." 
</P>
<P>
A Fresno developer and a Democrat, Hendricks said he was appointed by 
Deukmejian to the board because he knew Hodge and was a college classmate of 
the governor's appointments secretary, Marvin R. Baxter. 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks said he was baffled as to why he was appointed to a slot on the board 
reserved for a tenant's representative. "I'm black. I'm a developer. I have 
apartments. It may have been stretching the point to say I was the tenant 
representative." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's deputy press secretary, Tom Beermann, said that Hendricks 
"qualified as a tenant's representative because his background with the Fresno 
Redevelopment Agency and his position as Fresno's assistant city manager put 
him in a position of being involved with tenant and low-income housing issues." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever his qualifications, transcripts of board meetings show that Hendricks 
was one of several board members to raise questions about the use of agency 
bond money. 
</P>
<P>
One current member of the board is even more outspoken about the agency's 
performance. Allen P. Baldwin, another Deukmejian-appointed tenant 
representative on the board, is executive director of the Orange County 
Community Housing Corp. -- a nonprofit agency that builds and manages 
apartments for low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
"I continue to get irritated watching these dollars go into projects in areas 
where housing isn't a major problem," Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am an executive of the largest housing finance agency in the nation," 
Baldwin said. "If it's not me who helps solve this problem, then who? Is it 
going to come from Idaho? Leadership and innovation have got to come from us." 
Baldwin said he lacks support from other board members to make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the housing finance agency's board, Glendale-based real estate 
developer Sebastiano Sterpa, is much more enthusiastic about the agency's 
performance under Hodge. 
</P>
<P>
"Karney's done a super job," he said. "He has transformed an agency that was 
floundering around. . . . The amazing thing is (when he took the job) he didn't 
know anything about the agency or the intricacies of capital markets." 
</P>
<P>
Sterpa, a past president of the California Assn. of Realtors, has had direct 
financial ties with the agency's director. Financial disclosure statements show 
that Hodge invested in a real estate partnership put together by Sterpa. Hodge 
reported putting more than $10,000 into the deal; Sterpa put in more than 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Hodge said that joining in an investment with the chairman of his board did not 
represent a conflict of interest. "It's just a syndicate he (Sterpa) put 
together to buy a building," Hodge said. "I didn't even give it a second 
thought. He was looking for investors. It has nothing to do with housing." 
</P>
<P>
Since it was created in 1975 "to meet the housing needs of persons and families 
of low or moderate income," the California Housing Finance Agency has become 
one of the state's largest real estate lenders. It has more than $3 billion in 
bonds outstanding -- money it uses to finance mortgages for individual 
homeowners and apartment developments. 
</P>
<P>
Because earnings on the agency's bonds are exempt from state and federal taxes, 
bond purchasers are willing to accept lower-than-market interest rates on their 
investment. The reduced rates are passed along to qualified developers and 
first-time home buyers. Current California Housing Finance Agency mortgages 
charge about 8.3% -- as much as 2% below conventional rates. 
</P>
<P>
First-time home buyers can earn up to the median household income for their 
counties -- or 115% of median income if there are three or more in the family. 
The loan can be used toward a sales price up to 90% of the county average. In 
Los Angeles County, a couple earning up to $47,800 is eligible to purchase a 
new house or condominium for up to $172,700 under the agency's loan program. 
</P>
<P>
The agency has always relied on fees charged to lenders and interest earnings 
on its unspent bond funds to hire its staff and meet its ongoing expenses. 
Because of that, both Hodge and Sterpa like to talk about what the California 
Housing Finance Agency "is doing without government assistance." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the agency depends heavily on the tax-exempt nature of its bonds to 
make its programs work. The nonpartisan legislative analyst has estimated that 
every $1 billion in tax-exempt bonds costs the federal government as much as 
$25 million and the state as much as $8 million in lost taxes each year. 
</P>
<P>
In its early years, the housing finance agency maintained a balance between 
financing apartments and individual mortgages -- between mostly low-income 
renters and generally more affluent first-time home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
But that has changed dramatically, in part because of changes in federal rent 
subsidy programs and federal tax law. Hodge and others say that the withdrawal 
of federal subsidies and changes in the tax laws discouraging investment have 
left the agency with little flexibility to respond to the housing crisis in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
In the last nine months, the agency financed 4,402 home purchases and just 211 
apartments. Only 99 of those homes -- and none of the apartments -- were in Los 
Angeles County, the state's most populous county. 
</P>
<P>
The legislative analyst's office has identified another trend in current 
housing finance agency programs: 42% of those who took advantage of the 
agency's first-time home buyer program last year had income levels above the 
official state definition of "moderate income." In Los Angeles that means an 
annual income of more than $41,050 for a family of three. Only 11% of the loans 
went to low-income households. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to concern that home ownership is increasingly beyond the reach of 
middle-class Californians, Deukmejian has asked the Legislature to add $1 
billion to the agency's existing first-time home buyer program and to create a 
$1-billion program for households with even higher income levels. 
</P>
<P>
The new program, which would require a $20-million-a-year subsidy paid directly 
by state taxpayers, would make mortgages available to individuals and families 
with incomes substantially higher than median income in many high-cost 
counties. To be eligible for state-subsidized mortgages, the home buyers could 
have annual incomes up to 35% of the average sales price for houses in their 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
In Marin and San Mateo counties, for example, the program would allow a family 
of three earning up to $83,699 a year to qualify for a state-subsidized 
mortgage on a house or condominium purchase up to $239,140. 
</P>
<P>
Housing finance agency board member Baldwin complained that Deukmejian's plan 
-- like the agency's existing first-time home buyers program -- would help "a 
lot of yuppies." 
</P>
<P>
Said Gary Squier, former director of the Los Angeles Housing Authority and now 
a housing consultant: "The crisis is in multifamily rental housing. But the 
political expression of housing needs is in home ownership." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, for example, the city housing authority has a list of 93,000 
people waiting for 3,500 subsidized rental units expected to open up this year. 
</P>
<P>
More than most offices of state government, the California Housing Finance 
Agency is independent of the governor and the Legislature. It is not even 
subject to the usual budgetary review. And more than most agencies, the housing 
finance agency bears the stamp of the man that Deukmejian appointed to run it, 
Karney Hodge. 
</P>
<P>
"Before Karney, the management aspects of the agency were out of control," said 
a staff member who asked that he not be identified. But he and other employees 
complain that Hodge has emphasized fiscal strength and control at the expense 
of innovation in helping low-income Californians. 
</P>
<P>
Hodge at 62 is a hardy, gregarious man. All but the most bitter of the agency's 
critics describe him as likable, even charming, and uncannily adept 
politically. 
</P>
<P>
He is a man too energetic to be content with running his family's clothing 
business in Fresno, where he was a community dynamo. But he and Ken Maddy leave 
no doubt it was Hodge's longtime association with Maddy -- dating back to 
Maddy's work in the Hodge store when he was a college student -- that got Hodge 
his current job. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the first major officeholder who came out for Deukmejian early on (in 
1982)," Maddy explained. "So I had input into the whole process of structuring 
(the Deukmejian) team, and so I suggested to Karney to come up here." 
</P>
<P>
Some outsiders contend that without Hodge at the helm of the agency and without 
Maddy's support, Deukmejian might have ignored the agency and housing issues 
generally throughout his two terms as governor. 
</P>
<P>
"Without Karney, the agency would have withered and died, " said one developer, 
who recalled that as a state senator, Deukmejian had strongly opposed 
legislation establishing the agency. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a strong sense among those who follow the activity of the 
low-profile agency that it might have done better. 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks said he has "a gut feeling" that the agency should be doing more for 
the poor. "If you ask the question should there be more, the answer is yes."

CZECHOSLOVAKS, POPE CELEBRATE NEW FREEDOM

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Czechoslovaks underscored their repudiation of 
communism here Saturday with a jubilant salute to Pope John Paul II, who had 
championed their rights when they could not. 
</P>
<P>
"Today we stand before the ruins of one of the many towers of Babel in human 
history," the Pope said as an epitaph for four decades of failed communism in 
Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
For emotion, the reception given history's first Slavic Pope in the 
Czechoslovak capital had few parallels in John Paul's 46 journeys abroad. As 
rhetoric, the airport welcome for the Pope from playwright-President Vaclav 
Havel, a political prisoner of a dying Communist regime just six months ago, 
had no peer. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not know whether I know what a miracle is," Havel said. "Nonetheless, I 
dare say I am a party to a miracle now: A messenger of love comes into the 
country devastated by the ideology of hatred; a living symbol of civilization 
comes into the country devastated by the rule of the uncivilized. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
This capital of 1.2 million, where 40 years of Communist rule collapsed in a 
popular, peaceful revolution last winter, turned out en masse for the Polish 
Pope, who has long been lionized throughout Eastern Europe as the paramount 
spokesman for human rights and a powerful force for democratic change. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously moved by his reception, the Pope congratulated Czechoslovaks "on 
regaining your freedom" and scored the incapacity of Communist government "and 
its ideology to transmit to man the meaning of life and a firm hope for the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
"When I utter the splendid word freedom, I utter it with all the love and 
fervor in my heart," John Paul said. "I utter it as a profession of my faith in 
man and in his dignity. I utter it with a sense of sincere solidarity with all 
those to whom freedom has been so long denied." 
</P>
<P>
A large, enthusiastic crowd lined John Paul's route through a city dressed in 
spring-green and the institutional gray of bygone apparatchiks. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of up to 500,000 by some estimates sheltered under umbrellas in a 
rain-drenched esplanade for a papal Mass. Before he began, John Paul kissed on 
both cheeks Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek, the ailing, 90-year-old Czechoslovak 
patriarch who is a national hero today for his long resistance to Marxist rule. 
</P>
<P>
John Paul preached to the multitude in Czech and in Slovak. Repeatedly he was 
interrupted by applause during a homily hailing "your rebirth . . . the great 
work of the spiritual renewal of your homeland." 
</P>
<P>
In an airport address launching his two-day visit, the 69-year-old pontiff 
called communism "a tragic utopia" that failed throughout Eastern Europe 
because it ignored certain essential dimensions of man: "his uniqueness and 
unrepeatable quality, his unquenchable yearning for freedom and truth, his 
inability to be happy if the transcendent relationship with God is excluded." 
</P>
<P>
The Pope returned to his theme "with a heart brimming over with affection" for 
Czechoslovakia in an address to intellectuals and leaders of other churches. 
</P>
<P>
"Without a sense of the transcendent, any type of culture remains a formless 
fragment like the unfinished Tower of Babel," John Paul said. "A person without 
culture is lacking in an activity which each person owes him or herself. Life 
without culture is life without spiritual depth, without openness to mystery, 
life exposed to the risks of superficiality regulated only by needs and 
consumption. 
</P>
<P>
"Today we stand before the ruins of one of the many towers of Babel in human 
history," he continued. "The building people tried to construct in former years 
was without a transcendent dimension, without spiritual depth. Every effort to 
build society, culture, unity between people and their brotherhood upon denial 
of the transcendent dimension creates, as at Babel, division of hearts and 
confusion of tongues." 
</P>
<P>
Cameras from the state television network tracked the papal passage 
unblinkingly from stop to stop Saturday in a country where Communist rule had 
savagely repressed all religion. 
</P>
<P>
Catholics, who make up at least half of the 15 million people by Vatican count, 
lost priests to jail and churches to the state. 
</P>
<P>
At the low point of church-state relations, formally restored on the eve of the 
papal visit, 10 of 13 bishoprics were vacant because Communist rule would not 
accept the Vatican nominees. 
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's new world, thousands of yellow-and-white papal flags waved among 
Czechoslovakia's red, white and blue, and, at the Mass, a single Stars and 
Stripes. Posters at every turn welcomed "Jan Pavel," as the Pope is known here. 
</P>
<P>
"Pavel and Havel, two good men," said one young Prague well-wisher. 
</P>
<P>
In his appearances, John Paul repeatedly praised Tomasek, who, then a bishop, 
was jailed from 1951 to 1954. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pope also comes to pay tribute to all your suffering," John Paul told a 
meeting of clerics. "Your victory is the fruit of fidelity," he said, urging 
his priests and nuns to help heal lingering wounds through church-state 
cooperation for national renewal. 
</P>
<P>
Under democratic rule -- parliamentary elections are scheduled in June -- 
Czechoslovakia "is in a certain sense returning to Europe," where, John Paul 
said, great promise awaits. 
</P>
<P>
"A united Europe is no longer a dream; it is not a utopian memory for the 
Middle Ages. The events which we are witnessing show that this goal can be 
actually reached," John Paul said, embroidering on his oft-expressed dream of a 
common European home from the Atlantic to the Urals based on common Christian 
principles. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Pope travels from Bohemia, where Prague is located, to the regions 
of Moravia and Slovakia for outdoor masses. He returns to Rome tonight.

ADELANTO'S DILEMMA; 
</P>
<P>
U.S. SUES DESERT TOWN FOR REJECTING A SHELTER FOR HOMELESS MENTALLY ILL IN 
RESIDENTIAL AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

ADELANTO, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Justice Department is charging that this little Mojave Desert town has 
finally found something it doesn't want: a shelter for the homeless mentally 
ill. 
</P>
<P>
Adelanto likes gambling. It welcomes prisons. It is willing to take garbage 
from other cities. It wants an international airport. 
</P>
<P>
But Adelanto does not want mentally ill people living in its residential 
neighborhoods, according to a housing discrimination suit filed in federal 
court in Los Angeles by the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
Adelanto city officials deny the discrimination allegation, contending that the 
decision they made that prompted the suit was based on legitimate zoning 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
At issue in the suit, which could have nationwide significance, are the 
circumstances under which local governments may legally bar facilities for the 
handicapped from residential areas. The suit is the first of its kind on behalf 
of the mentally ill, according to Justice Department officials. It is based on 
the federal Fair Housing Amendments Act that, as of March 12, 1989, outlawed 
housing discrimination based on handicaps. 
</P>
<P>
Federal attorneys charge that the Adelanto City Council acted illegally last 
August when it denied a permit that a boarding house for homeless mentally ill 
people needed to continue operating in a residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"The City Council denied the application . . . because of the handicap of the 
residents of the home," the suit charges. 
</P>
<P>
It asks the court to prevent the city from closing Lillie Ruff's Homeless 
Shelter, which houses eight mentally ill residents who were referred there by 
San Bernardino County officials. The suit, filed March 18, also seeks punitive 
damages "because of the intentional and willful nature of the defendant's 
conduct." 
</P>
<P>
Ruff, a 42-year-old widow and licensed vocational nurse, opened the home in 
1987 and was subsequently told by Adelanto officials that she needed a 
"conditional-use permit" to continue operating the boarding home in her 
neighborhood of mostly single-family houses. Adelanto zoning laws allow city 
officials to grant permission for boarding homes to operate in such 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
But when Ruff applied for the permit before the Adelanto Planning Commission 
last July, neighbors of the home presented city officials with a petition with 
38 signatures stating: "We do not want the mentally disturbed right in the 
middle of a family housing area with many children." 
</P>
<P>
Ruff, who lives at the shelter with her three small nephews, dismisses that 
concern. "They said they feared for the children, and I have more children than 
anyone on the block," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission turned down the request for a permit to operate the 
home and last August the City Council rejected Ruff's appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Adelanto officials deny that their rejection of the permit was discriminatory 
and insist they had merely enforced zoning laws prohibiting commercial 
activities in residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no problem with mentally handicapped people . . . if they're put in an 
area that is zoned for that," said Mayor Edward Dondelinger in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of protecting handicapped people from discrimination in housing is 
complicated. Currently, under California law, facilities licensed by the state 
to give care and supervision to six or fewer mentally handicapped clients 
generally cannot be barred by local authorities from operating in residential 
neighborhoods. But facilities with more than six clients are not afforded such 
protection under state law, nor are boarding homes, such as Ruff's Homeless 
Shelter, that provide food and housing but do not have state licenses for care 
and supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the state's fair housing regulations -- which cover the physically 
handicapped -- do not cover the mentally ill or retarded, according to John 
Castello, chief counsel for the state Department for Fair Employment and 
Housing. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Fair Housing Amendments Act is an attempt to extend protection 
against discrimination in housing to all handicapped people, no matter the 
nature of their disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Rubenstein, legal director of the Mental Health Law Project, a public 
interest legal firm in Washington, said of the Adelanto suit: "It is important 
across the country because . . . many local governments either don't understand 
what their obligations are or fail to abide by their obligations (under the 
federal Fair Housing Amendments Act)." 
</P>

The remote town of Adelanto, 90 miles northeast of Los Angeles and with a 
population that state officials put at 5,000 (town fathers claim 10,000) would 
seem an unlikely focal point for such a dispute. In its quest for financial 
growth over the last 15 years, Adelanto has been less than choosy about 
enterprises it was willing to welcome. For example: 
</P>
<P>
* In the mid-1970s, the city tried unsuccessfully to legalize Las Vegas-style 
casino gambling within its boundaries through a state initiative. That dream is 
still alive, but Adelanto makes do with only a legal card room, called the 
Hi-Desert Casino. 
</P>
<P>
* In the mid-1980s, Adelanto tried to acquire a maximum-security 1,500-inmate 
state prison to create jobs. State correctional officials called the project 
off after they were advised that jet fighters shrieking out of George Air Force 
Base -- adjacent to the city -- would be an invitation to an inmate lawsuit 
over intolerable noise. Since then, Adelanto has managed to attract a 
380-inmate facility for parole violators, which is under construction. 
</P>
<P>
* City officials say they currently are negotiating with several companies to 
haul in garbage from other municipalities for conversion to energy and other 
byproducts. 
</P>
<P>
* The city hopes to create a "Hi Desert International Airport" on the site of 
George Air Force Base when that facility closes in 1992. Community leaders have 
invited aeronautic industry officials to town to discuss the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Former City Councilman Gus Ronnebeck, a retired Air Force sergeant, is a 
booster of such projects, but an opponent of Ruff's Homeless Shelter. He and 
his wife, Margaret, were among those who signed the petition against it. 
</P>
<P>
The Ronnebecks become angry at the mere mention of Ruff's pink one-story 
triplex, which is directly across the street from their ranch-style home. 
</P>
<P>
Gus Ronnebeck said of the boarding home: "I think you should have that in a 
commercial area. It should be operated as a commercial business." 
</P>
<P>
The Ronnebecks admit that none of the residents of Ruff's shelter has ever 
bothered them. 
</P>
<P>
"We personally have not had them come to our house," said Margaret Ronnebeck. 
"We have loaded guns here and if they come here they're going to be carried 
away." 
</P>
<P>
Such fear of the mentally ill is based on myth, maintains Edward Garner, 
coordinator of the San Bernardino County Mental Health Department program that 
refers clients to Ruff's shelter. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't have any more potential for violence than the ordinary citizen, 
probably less," said Garner, a clinical psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the shelter who spoke before the City Council last August 
complained of behavior by the boarding home residents that they found annoying 
rather than violent. 
</P>
<P>
"(They) walk right into your yard," complained Elsie Allen. "They open up the 
gate and walk right in and if they get hurt, then they can sue us." 
</P>
<P>
Irl Peterson, whose elderly mother lives across the street from the home, said, 
"I see these patients numerous times in the open fields staring out in a manner 
which is (not) befitting of a normal person." 
</P>
<P>
When the City Council heard Ruff's appeal of the Planning Commission decision 
last August, it was warned by City Atty. Ivan L. Hopkins that, under federal 
law, it could not legally consider the mental handicaps of the boarding house 
residents in deciding whether to grant a permit for the home. To avoid unlawful 
discrimination, he advised, the council must approve or deny the request for a 
permit as though it were considering a boarding house for ordinary residents. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, during the deliberations, Mayor Dondelinger expressed concern 
over the behavior of residents in such shelters that had operated in the city 
previously. 
</P>
<P>
"(The) people have been unsupervised," he complained, "(and) have gone around 
to the stores and caused all kinds of problems and we have very little control 
over what happens in any of these places . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4 to 1 to deny the permit. Councilman Frank Harris cast the 
dissenting vote because he disagreed with the decision of the majority to allow 
Ruff to continue to operate even during a 90-day period for appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Ruff subsequently complained to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development and federal attorneys brought suit. The shelter has remained open. 
</P>
<P>
Dondelinger vowed to fight the suit. "We can't let them take businesses and put 
them beside houses. We can't let the zoning go askew." 
</P>

<P>
One of America's worst-kept military secrets, the F-117A Stealth fighter, was 
unveiled Saturday to a crowd of thousands who cheered a demonstration flight by 
two of the multimillion-dollar aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The two bat-shaped planes swept in under a thin cloud cover and passed over 
Nellis Air Force Base, banked sharply against the Las Vegas skyline and landed 
to give the public its first close-up of the once top-secret aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
There was an eerie whine as the lead craft, piloted by Capt. Randall Peterson 
of Rock Island, Ill., made a pass 58 feet above the runway. 
</P>
<P>
The second F-117A, piloted by Maj. Steven Charles of Springfield, Mass., then 
swept by the crowd, circled and landed. 
</P>
<P>
Both jets were surprisingly quiet in flight and while taxiing to an area 
encircled by several thousand people, including military family members, VIPs 
and 225 members of the media, including 37 from five foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
Viewing was opened to the public later and up to 150,000 people were expected. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign journalists represented Britain, France, Australia, Japan and West 
Germany. Asked if any Soviet reporters were on hand, Tech. Sgt. Bobby Shelton, 
the Stealth unit information officer, said, "They didn't ask us." 
</P>
<P>
No performance details were released, other than that the radar-evading F-117A 
is a single-seat, twin-engine subsonic jet. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a fighter in every respect," Peterson, 30, told the crowd, saying that 
the jet has outstanding handling characteristics and gives the United States 
unprecedented capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to an F-117A nickname that has surfaced, he said, "Nobody that flies 
the Stealth aircraft calls it a wobbly goblin." 
</P>
<P>
Also off-limits were questions on reports that a Stealth fighter used in the 
U.S. invasion of Panama last year dropped bombs far from its target. 
</P>
<P>
"The bombs hit exactly where they were aimed," Peterson said before another Air 
Force officer broke in and said, "We can't discuss information like that." 
</P>
<P>
"I only wish I could tell you what this fighter can really do," said Ben Rich, 
vice president of Lockheed Corp., which builds the jet at its secret "Skunk 
Works" in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
The F-117A costs more than $100 million a copy, according to a recent report by 
the General Accounting Office. The Air Force gave a figure of $42.6 million -- 
the so-called fly-away cost of one plane, without counting development costs 
for the program. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force has only recently pulled back the shroud of official secrecy on 
the F-117A, which had long been rumored to exist and has been flying for a 
decade. Previously, only pictures had been shown. 
</P>
<P>
The Stealth fighters are attached to the 37th Tactical Fighter Wing at the 
Tonopah Test Range, a remote airfield 140 miles northwest of Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 2,500 military personnel assigned to the program live in the Las 
Vegas area and commute to Tonopah each week. For their families, the public 
demonstration was the first view of the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Peter Kempf, commander of the 12th Air Force, saluted the families, 
noting that military personnel had to be away from home four days a week for 
three years and couldn't tell their families why. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson, who has been in the Stealth program 3 1/2 years, said he was only 
able to tell his wife: "Hey, I've got a job but I can't tell you where it is or 
what I'm doing." 
</P>
<P>
The F-117A is a relatively simple aircraft to fly and operate, said Col. 
Anthony Tolin, commander of the 37th. With only three accidents in nine years, 
it has the best safety record of any Air Force plane, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 59 Stealth fighters have been purchased and the last will be 
delivered this fall.

REVISED AT BEHEST OF MINORITIES, NEW CIVIL SERVICE EXAMS READY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Eight years after the civil service qualifying examination was thrown out 
because it discriminated against minorities, the government has devised new 
competitive entrance tests that will be given across the country in June. 
</P>
<P>
Americans interested in federal professional and administrative careers will 
have a chance for the first time in nearly a decade to compete openly at 
hundreds of examination sites around the nation for the roughly 10,000 
entry-level jobs on the government's management track. The government estimates 
300,000 to 500,000 people will take the exams. 
</P>
<P>
Since the old qualifying exams were thrown out, hiring for entry-level 
professional and administrative jobs has been done in a stopgap manner or on 
the basis of narrow tests aimed at specific jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new procedure, the Office of Personnel Management will administer six 
broad-based tests, each of which covers a range of related occupations. The 
tests were developed at a cost of about $100,000 each to select the best 
applicants and eliminate "adverse impact" on minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Only 5% of black applicants passed the old Professional and Administrative 
Career Examination, or PACE, which was thrown out in 1982. Only .07% of them 
received a high enough score to be considered for hiring. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wants people selected by the government to be of high quality," said 
Richard T. Seymour, director of the employment discrimination project at the 
Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which brought the original suit 
against PACE in 1978. "We just don't want a thumb on the scale of merit." 
</P>
<P>
Since the abandonment of PACE, civil servants have been hired for 118 different 
kinds of jobs based on interviews, recommendations, college grade point 
averages and, increasingly, from specialized tests developed for specific jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Former Office of Personnel Management Director Constance Horner described the 
process as "intellectually confusing, procedurally nightmarish, inaccessible to 
students and very difficult to explain." 
</P>
<P>
The hiring process is almost universally blamed for at least part of the 
problem described as the "quiet crisis" in the quality of government by the 
commission headed by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker. "There is 
a widespread sense that the overall quality of federal entry level employees is 
declining," the commission said last year. 
</P>
<P>
The new tests will not immediately end litigation over discrimination in PACE 
and an earlier test. In 1981 the U.S District Court ruled that once the 
government devised a test the court considered non-discriminatory, it would 
monitor the situation for five years to ensure that actual hiring was fair. If 
the court determines the new tests are non-discriminatory, then the five-year 
clock will start ticking.

SHUTTLE COUNTDOWN RESUMES FOR HUBBLE TELESCOPE MISSION

Countdown clocks resumed ticking Saturday for the shuttle Discovery's delayed 
launch Tuesday to boost the $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers also readied the shuttle Columbia for rollout to its launch pad today 
for a May flight. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery's carefully scripted countdown began on time at 3 p.m. The ship's 
five-member crew is set to blast off at 5:31 a.m. PDT Tuesday, 14 days after 
the flight was grounded just four minutes before takeoff by a faulty hydraulic 
power steering unit. 
</P>
<P>
"We're off and running," NASA spokesman George Diller said. "We're still 80% go 
for launch weather-wise." 
</P>
<P>
With Discovery's launch processing on track, engineers worked to ready Columbia 
for its May 16 Spacelab astronomy mission. 
</P>
<P>
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has not had two shuttles on 
the launch pad since Columbia took off Jan. 12, 1986, with Challenger poised on 
a pad 1.7 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia's 3.5-mile trip to the firing stand was set to begin at 8 a.m. today. 
Five hours later, Discovery's five-member crew was scheduled to fly in from the 
Johnson Space Center in Houston to make final preparations for launch. 
</P>
<P>
Commander Loren J. Shriver, 45; co-pilot Charles F. Bolden, 43; Steven A. 
Hawley, 38; Bruce McCandless, 52, and Kathryn D. Sullivan, 38, plan to launch 
the telescope Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery's replacement auxiliary power unit was successfully test fired 
Wednesday and the battery charging for the telescope was completed Thursday, 
one day ahead of schedule.

SANDINISTA FOE TO LEAD ASSEMBLY; 
</P>
<P>
NICARAGUA: CHAMORRO NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE LEGISLATURE IS REJECTED. THE 
VOTE DISCLOSES A DEEP RIFT IN HER RULING COALITION.

<TEXT>
<P>
President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's political coalition Saturday 
rejected her candidate to head the new National Assembly and chose instead a 
woman who is less conciliatory toward the defeated Sandinista government. 
</P>
<P>
By a 28-23 vote that reflected a deep rift in the National Opposition Union, 
the coalition's newly elected deputies chose Myriam Arguello over Chamorro's 
chief political strategist, Alfredo Cesar, as their nominee to preside over the 
92-seat Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Because the coalition's 14 parties agreed in advance to accept the nominating 
vote as binding, Arguello, a 63-year-old Conservative lawyer, is assured of 
winning the legislative post when the new Assembly convenes for the first time 
Tuesday. The Sandinista-dominated Assembly elected in 1984 met for the last 
time Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Arguello's first act as Assembly president will be to accept the formal handing 
over of power that day from President Daniel Ortega, whose police made her an 
anti-Sandinista hero by arresting her during a political demonstration in July, 
1988, and jailing her for more than five months. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, she will transfer presidential powers to Chamorro, upset winner 
in the Feb. 25 elections, during a ceremony at Managua's main baseball stadium. 
Vice President Dan Quayle and at least eight Latin American presidents are due 
to attend. 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro is expected to name her Cabinet and announce changes in the 
Sandinista-led army Monday. Those decisions will be strongly influenced by a 
close circle of family advisers headed by her son-in-law, Antonio Lacayo, and 
by Cesar, who is married to Lacayo's sister. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the two-month transition, both men have worked to reach compromises 
with the Sandinistas for the sake of a peaceful transition. They helped forge a 
definitive cease-fire with the U.S.-backed Contras on Thursday and an earlier 
transition accord to preserve the "integrity and hierarchy" of the 
all-Sandinista army officer corps. 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro's reliance on those advisers has put her in conflict with Vice 
President-elect Virgilio Godoy and the coalition's 14-member political council, 
who favor a harder line against the Sandinistas and fear being excluded from a 
major role in her administration. 
</P>
<P>
Cesar, 38, who served the Sandinista government as central bank president 
before going into exile in 1982 to become a civilian Contra leader, has been a 
particular target of controversy because of his aggressive style and 
unconcealed presidential ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
The nomination of an Assembly president brought tensions within Chamorro's 
alliance into the open. In an all-day public meeting, with Godoy presiding, the 
51 deputies traded bitter words. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Moreno, a labor leader, accused Cesar of having distributed literature 
for his own Assembly candidacy while locking up "tons of material" printed for 
other candidates. Eli Altamirano, a Communist Party leader, called Cesar "a 
political divorcee" from the 14-party bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of Arguello said she would make compromise with the Assembly's 
Sandinista minority more difficult. Her supporters emphasized that, unlike 
Cesar, she had never joined the Sandinistas and had stayed in Nicaragua to 
oppose them. They said that, as an outsider to Chamorro's circle, she would 
better guarantee the independence of the legislative branch. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have to worry that she is going to fight (with Chamorro) because we 
women understand each other," said Julia Mena, a deputy from Godoy's Liberal 
Independent Party. "With Dona Violeta and Dona Myriam, we are going to 
democratize Nicaragua."

A trash fire at Grand Central Terminal on Saturday sent smoke billowing into 
the main concourse and caused the evacuation of about 500 people, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze began shortly after 10 a.m. under the cement slab of a platform on 
the station's upper level, a Fire Department spokesman said, adding that the 
fire was under control within an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Homeless people were thought to be responsible for the fire, which police 
considered of suspicious origin because debris should not have been under the 
platform.

BUSH TO SPEND EARTH DAY GETTING HOOKED ON REEFS

<P>
Here, where the wily bonefish abounds in the flats of the Florida Bay, is what 
President Bush plans to do on Earth Day: 
</P>
<P>
At the unusual hour of 7:05 a.m., he intends to award a "Point of Light," the 
presidential commendation he has created to recognize voluntarism, to an 
organization that is working to protect the fragile coral reefs of the Florida 
Keys. By about 8 a.m., or so, he plans to go fishing. 
</P>
<P>
That's not to say that the man who campaigned for the White House on the pledge 
to become "the environmental President" is ignoring the nationwide celebrations 
marking the 20th anniversary of Earth Day. 
</P>
<P>
He is just doing it in his own fashion -- a little bit of this, a little bit of 
that -- rather than landing with both feet in the midst of a big bash. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout his visit to Florida, Bush has skittered into and out of 
environmental topics -- creating the aura of environmental action without 
appearing to be consumed by it. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, he announced that sites on the coasts of Louisiana, Maine, 
Massachusetts and Florida had been added to the Environmental Protection 
Agency's National Estuary Program, established to protect environmentally 
sensitive wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he plans to announce greater protection of the heavily trafficked 
Florida sea lanes, where Blackbeard and other pirate cohorts once swooped down 
on Europe-bound sea travelers. In the 1990s, it is the life at the sea bottom 
there -- the only living coral reefs in the continental United States -- that 
need the protection. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere on the Bush agenda was there any reference to one of the most sensitive 
environmental decisions on his plate: whether to ban for the foreseeable future 
oil drilling and exploration off the coast of Florida near the Everglades, 
although he has suggested he might accept such a ban. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1989, he suspended preparations for leasing segments of the Outer 
Continental Shelf near the Everglades and along two-thirds of the California 
coastline, a decision that has brought into sharp focus the clash between 
environmental, economic and energy concerns. 
</P>
<P>
The bitter debate over the leases has led to frequent postponements of the 
decision -- one that White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater routinely 
says requires more research, and one that is certain to anger somebody. 
</P>
<P>
While the President's four-day trip has had three purposes -- a meeting 
Thursday with French President Francois Mitterrand in Key Largo; political 
appearances in Birmingham, Ala., and Orlando, Fla., on Friday, and fishing, 
fishing and more fishing on Saturday and today -- environmental messages were 
salted into Bush's public events throughout the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
As a cap on the trip, Bush, whose frequent-phoning habits have made the 
telephone the very symbol of chief executiveship, will once again reach out and 
touch someone. He is planning to call, of all places, Mt. Everest (an 
international team has timed its climb to coincide with Earth Day) and the 
Columbia River Gorge (to speak to an Earth Day rally there). 
</P>
<P>
Even the setting for a news conference with Mitterrand sent signals of 
appreciation for remarkable outdoor beauty. The French and American presidents, 
their backs to the whitecaps of Card Sound, faced reporters on a finely 
manicured lawn edged by mangroves. A flapping circle of orange, green and white 
parachute cloth was tied to palm trees, providing shade from the late-afternoon 
sun. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's recreational activities fit certain patterns. He is a 65-year-old jogger 
-- turning in respectable 10- to 11-minute miles -- and he is fascinated with 
fast boats. 
</P>
<P>
In Kennebunkport, Me., site of his vacation home, and here in Florida, it seems 
a day would not be complete without both. 
</P>
<P>
So on Friday, before setting out from the Keys on a 15-hour day of travel, Bush 
jogged for a half-hour just after sunup, showered, changed into a blue rain 
suit and climbed aboard a speed boat with his host, Carl Lindner and Lindner's 
son, Keith. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Lindner, a Cincinnati businessman whose enterprises include importing 
bananas, runs a yellow speedboat on the waters off the Ocean Reef Club. He 
calls the boat Chiquita. 
</P>
<P>
As for the presidential fishing expedition, Bush had no chance to break his 
unwanted Kennebunkport record. It was there last summer that he spent day after 
day, more than two weeks in all, before finally landing a bluefish. 
</P>
<P>
That drought became a subject of extreme sensitivity -- a topic as welcome in 
presidential conversation as broccoli is on the presidential plate. 
</P>
<P>
At sundown, word from the shallow waters of Florida Bay was that Bush came up 
almost empty-handed. Although he caught several snappers that he threw back, 
the bonefish remained as elusive as the bluefish further north.

Fire ripped through a hotel before dawn Saturday, sending more than 200 sleepy 
guests scurrying to safety from the flames and smoke near the glittering Las 
Vegas Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Three people were treated for minor smoke inhalation injuries in the fire at 
the Las Vegas Inn, but no serious injuries were reported and no one was 
believed trapped in the five-story hotel, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Early warnings allowed nearly all the guests, estimated at more than 200, to 
evacuate the hotel without injury, fire authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Two smoke victims were treated and released from Valley Hospital, nursing 
supervisor Eleanor Jakobs said. A third was treated and released from 
University Medical Center, according to a nursing supervisor who said hospital 
policy prohibited giving his name. 
</P>
<P>
"Looks like the Inn is burning to the ground to me," the supervisor said after 
viewing the flames from the hospital roof. 
</P>
<P>
"Billowing smoke rising into the clouds above the lights on the Strip -- one 
hell of a light show," 
</P>
<P>
Flames broke through the roof of the hotel, sending smoke across the Las Vegas 
Strip, two blocks away, and throughout a section of Las Vegas, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of onlookers lined the street as firefighters rained water on the blaze 
that broke out about 2:30 a.m. and defied control two hours later.

THE NFL DRAFT; 
</P>
<P>
CHARGERS; 
</P>
<P>
BEATHARD HAS A 5 UP SLEEVE, BUT WHAT ELSE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Bobby Beathard, the Chargers' general manager, finds himself in such an unusual 
position today that he almost doesn't know how to act. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard has a first-round pick in the NFL draft -- and likely will use it. 
</P>
<P>
The last time he did that was in 1983, when he was the general manager of the 
Washington Redskins. He selected cornerback Darrell Green with the final pick 
of the round. This time, the pick is the fifth overall, a lofty position 
Beathard never enjoyed with the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been here before," Beathard said. "I'm not sure what to do." 
</P>
<P>
That is one reason, Beathard said, that he is speaking so freely about the 
available players. And he has made no secret about his interest in offensive 
tackle Richmond Webb of Texas A&amp;M. 
</P>
<P>
Webb appears to be what the Chargers need to help rebuild their offensive line. 
At 6-feet-6, 290 pounds, he could step in and play immediately. Beathard has 
said he clearly is the best offensive lineman in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a tough guy to pass up," Beathard said. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Beathard is speaking this openly because the pick appears too good to be 
true. But late-changing events could alter his plans. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard has become all but convinced that Tampa Bay will select linebacker 
Keith McCants of Alabama with the fourth pick. Combine that with a possible 
late trade between New England and Seattle that would allow the Seahawks to 
move up and take Miami defensive tackle Cortez Kennedy third, and the Chargers 
could be looking at linebacker Junior Seau of USC and Oceanside High School. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard might then take Seau, who could help at inside linebacker, and worry 
about filling the offensive line needs later. 
</P>
<P>
This, of course, is if the New York Jets do not upset the modified scenario by 
taking someone other than running back Blair Thomas of Penn State with the 
second choice. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know what's going to happen," Beathard said. 
</P>
<P>
He is not alone. The draft is a guessing man's game. And Beathard has a 
reputation of being one of its shrewd players. 
</P>
<P>
He has a history of being active and creative on draft day. Last-minute deals, 
mid-round deals, trading a first-round choice for later picks, swapping a high 
pick next year for a lower one this year, trading players for picks -- he can 
conjure up just about anything. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, he's saying it could get mighty boring around Charger 
headquarters, especially if they hold onto their current picks. After the first 
round, the Chargers do not have another choice until the third. They have three 
picks there, the first of which is 57th overall, acquired from Tampa Bay in the 
deal for running back Gary Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
"It might be kind of a dull day," Beathard said. "It's a long time between the 
fifth pick and the third round. Maybe something will happen, but right now, I 
can't think of a way to make it happen." 
</P>
<P>
But those who have watched Beathard doubt today will be any different than the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't worry, he'll do some trading," said Bruce Allen, a Phoenix-based agent 
whose father is former Redskin Coach George Allen. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard has been saying for weeks that he would like to trade his No. 1 pick 
for a slot later in the first round, with the idea of picking up another choice 
in the bargain. The Chargers would prefer that it be something in the second 
round, where they are without a pick because of the trade with Chicago for 
quarterback Jim McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
But as the draft has drawn closer, Beathard has said he is beginning to accept 
the fact that he might not be able to swing such a deal. Beathard lately has 
labeled the chances of making it happen as "50-50" at best. 
</P>
<P>
That could change quickly if any of the four teams ahead of the Chargers in the 
first round do other than what Beathard expects. His dream might be to have 
Kennedy left on the board when the Chargers pick. Several teams close behind 
them have said that they like Kennedy, including Detroit, which has the seventh 
pick, and Seattle (Nos. 8 and 10). 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said he likes Kennedy, too, but might be willing to trade him for the 
right price and a spot close enough to the top to take Webb -- if that is who 
he really wants. 
</P>
<P>
One other scenario could have the Chargers using a first-round choice to fill 
what Beathard said is their other most glaring need -- cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
The options there appear to be as limited as they are at offensive line. 
Beathard said this is not a strong year for cornerbacks, either. 
</P>
<P>
The best may be J.D. Williams of Fresno State, whose sprinter's speed is 
attractive. But some scouts wonder if he has coverage ability to match. The 
next best choice might be Ben Smith of Georgia. The Chargers worked Smith out 
on Monday, but that might have been more as a contingency in case they move 
well back into the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Another backup plan could have the Chargers taking one of several other highly 
regarded linebackers, including James Francis of Baylor and Chris Singleton of 
Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
But Beathard has said these scenarios are unlikely, because he does not want to 
trade back to further than the 10th pick overall. 
</P>
<P>
And while attention might be focused on Round 1, the Chargers have plenty of 
other business to take care of over the next two days. 
</P>
<P>
They have 14 choices in the 12-round draft, including three selections in both 
the third and seventh rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard has identified several other areas the team would like to address as 
wide receiver, tight end and return specialist. About the only position 
Beathard has said he would not draft would be a kicker. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Rod Bernstine, the Chargers' first-round choice in 1987, has changed positions 
again. A tight end as a rookie, an H-back last season, Bernstine has been moved 
to running back, General Manager Bobby Beathard said. Beathard said that Coach 
Dan Henning said he thought he could make more use of Bernstine as a runner. 
Bernstine, who has missed part of each of his first three seasons because of 
injuries -- the most serious of which required reconstructive knee surgery in 
December 1988 -- was a fullback during his first two seasons at Texas A&amp;M. 
Last season as an H-back, Bernstine gained 137 yards on 15 carries, an average 
of 9.1 yards, before being injured in the fifth game against Denver and later 
undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery.

SHARTS HELPS CSUN TUNE UP FOR RIVERSIDE IN 8-5 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Scott Sharts pitched his first complete game at the collegiate level Saturday 
in leading Cal State Northridge to an 8-5 California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
victory over Chapman at Hart Park in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Sharts (2-1), troubled by tendinitis in his right (pitching) arm, scattered 
seven hits in his third start on the mound this season. 
</P>
<P>
"(The elbow) felt great today," said Sharts, a sophomore. "It didn't bother me 
at all." 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors, who finished 5-0 against Chapman this season, improved to 28-15, 
and 15-6 in conference play to remain 1 1/2 games behind CCAA-leading UC 
Riverside (16-4), which beat Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, 12-4, on Saturday. 
Chapman fell to 23-19, 13-10, three games behind Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN, which defeated Chapman for the third time in three days, will meet 
Riverside in a pivotal three-game series beginning Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're fortunate to have the luxury to meet Chapman and Riverside at this time 
of the year," Kernen said. "It's hard to beat a team five times. We didn't get 
caught up in that. It takes a special kind of mentality to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Sharts, who leads the Matadors with 17 home runs, picked up his first victory 
last Saturday in a 9-2 win over Cal State Dominguez Hills. He gave up one run 
and five hits in 6 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely want to do some more pitching the rest of the season," Sharts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sharts was not too concerned despite allowing a three-run home run to Doug 
Yates in the first inning that gave the Panthers a 3-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't worried about it," Sharts said. "I knew we had the ability to come 
back. We've done it all year." 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors took the lead for good two innings later, sending nine batters to 
the plate and scoring five runs to go ahead, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Richardson knocked in three runs with a bases-loaded triple to deep 
center field. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge added two runs in the fourth to go ahead, 8-3. Craig Clayton, who 
doubled and advanced to third on Greg Shockey's single, scored the first run 
when catcher Mike Kelly's attempt to throw out Shockey in an attempted steal of 
second ended up in center field. 
</P>
<P>
Shockey (three hits) went to third on the error and Sharts singled him home on 
a bad-hop grounder that caromed off shortstop Mark Landeros' shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman pushed across two runs in the fourth to close to 8-5. Jason Rolish 
walked and advanced to second on a single by Rod Klopfer. Landeros doubled to 
score both baserunners. 
</P>
<P>
Clayton, who pitched the entire game in Northridge's 12-inning win over Chapman 
on Thursday and leads the team with a .407 batting average, was three for five 
and scored three runs.

CANYONS DEFEATS CUESTA TO MOVE CLOSER TO TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Emotions grew a little heated when College of the Canyons played Cuesta 
Saturday afternoon, but nothing has been hotter than the Cougars' bats. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons rapped 13 hits in posting a 7-5 Western State Conference win in a game 
that was played at the emotional pitch of a championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Cuesta, which entered the day one game behind first-place Canyons, was pushing 
to remain in contention for its first conference title; perennial champion 
Canyons was trying to solidify its bid for another championship. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to downplay (the game) a little bit," Cuesta Coach Larry Lee said. 
"Baseball's not a game you can get too emotional about, but it was definitely 
an emotional game." 
</P>
<P>
Willie Shoemaker and Angel Cordero could have been in the dugouts there was so 
much bench jockeying, and midway through the game, the home-plate umpire had to 
admonish both benches for their hostile words. 
</P>
<P>
There was no stopping the Canyons offense, though. 
</P>
<P>
In winning three WSC games in the past four days, Canyons had a total of 44 
hits. Canyons (23-10, 14-3), which has three WSC games remaining, now leads 
Cuesta (20-13-2, 12-5) and Moorpark by two games. 
</P>
<P>
All but one of Canyons' starters hit safely, and Gary Morgan, J. R. Trujillo, 
Billy Horvat, Jon Beauchemin and Mike Kerber each had two hits. 
</P>
<P>
However, Cuesta right-hander Paul Mayo kept Canyons off-balance in the early 
going with his drop-off-the-tabletop curve, and the score was tied, 1-1, after 
three innings. 
</P>
<P>
"His breaking ball is as good a breaking ball as we've seen in a long time," 
Canyons Coach Len Mohney said. "I think it was more his breaking ball than that 
we were being unaggressive." 
</P>
<P>
After twice striking out looking, shortstop Charlie Fowlks caught up with Mayo 
in the fourth inning and hit his fourth home run, a three-run shot to left 
center. 
</P>
<P>
Cuesta battled back in the fifth with three runs off Canyons starter Roland 
DeLaMaza to tie the score, 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
Trujillo and Beauchemin made a winner of DeLaMaza (6-1) when they had 
consecutive run-scoring singles in the bottom of the inning to put Canyons back 
ahead, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
"He battled," Mohney said of DeLaMaza, who struck out four and allowed two solo 
home runs in his five-inning stint. "He kept us in the game, but his 
concentration was not very good for us today." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Adams relieved DeLaMaza in the sixth and held Cuesta to one unearned run 
with four innings of two-hit pitching. 
</P>
<P>
"Jeff Adams did a great job again," Mohney said. "We never had that big of a 
lead. . . . I never felt good about it for some reason." 
</P>
<P>
Canyons added an insurance run in the eighth when Kerber scored Morgan with a 
single, and Adams retired the last seven men he faced to earn his fifth save. 
</P>
<P>
Mayo (3-4) went the distance and struck out five for Cuesta, which has compiled 
its highest total of WSC wins. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons left 11 men on base, including three in the seventh inning.

GRIEVING OVER JUNK BONDS: SOME FIRMS SURE MISS THEM; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCE: ALTHOUGH HIGH-YIELD DEBT CAME TO SYMBOLIZE EXCESS IN THE '80S, MANY 
SMALL AND MID-SIZED COMPANIES RELIED ON IT FOR GROWTH. NOW, THEY FACE A CREDIT 
CRUNCH. 
</P>

<P>
Michael Milken probably had companies like DEP Corp. in mind when he extolled 
the benefits of junk bonds for the American economy. 
</P>
<P>
DEP, a Los Angeles-based maker of hair- and skin-care products, added a wing to 
its plant, created more than 100 new jobs and grew from a modest $18 million in 
annual sales to more than $100 million today. This was made possible by a 
financing in 1986 that included a $16.5-million high-yield bond offering by 
Drexel Burnham Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Drexel is gone. The junk bond market remains depressed. And Robert 
Berglass, chairman and president of DEP, claims that his company and thousands 
like it are facing a credit squeeze that could ultimately hurt the national 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
Despite DEP's profitable performance, the company has found that it can no 
longer raise capital, at least not without giving up a major chunk of equity. 
As a result, DEP has had to scale back its growth plans dramatically, including 
scrapping a strategic acquisition that it had hoped to make earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Making a phone call and saying we need the money used to be the easy part," 
Berglass says. Now, "It's back to the '70s, when money was very hard to come 
by." 
</P>
<P>
While defaults on junk bond debt have led to highly publicized disasters, and 
junk bonds themselves have come to be synonymous with the excesses of the 
1980s, the sudden absence of the junk bond market may also be placing a lid on 
the growth of medium-sized and smaller companies. Not only can't companies 
resort to the junk market for capital, but the demise of the junk bond trade 
and spill-over from the savings and loan crisis is also having an impact on 
commercial banks, prompting them to significantly raise standards for granting 
commercial loans.

The head of the West Coast corporate finance office of a major Wall Street 
firm, who asked not to be identified, says the situation is dire for companies 
with less than $100 million in annual sales. "The unfortunate truth is that 
there is a horrendous squeeze right now," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The economic consequences of a true credit squeeze on smaller companies could 
be severe. In the 1980s, these firms played a major role in U.S. economic 
growth. In the past decade, as employment by Fortune 500 companies actually 
contracted, growth by smaller companies fueled the upsurge of private-sector 
job creation. 
</P>
<P>
Economists caution that the true extent of a credit crisis is far from clear. 
Robert Dederick, chief economist for Northern Trust Co. in Chicago, says there 
is lots of anecdotal evidence. But he says there aren't any hard statistics yet 
proving that companies actually are being starved of growth capital. The 
Federal Reserve is said to be looking into it. "Any quantitative numbers simply 
haven't appeared yet," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of hard numbers is small comfort to companies such as North American 
Watch, another former Drexel customer, which imports and wholesales 
wristwatches. The company, based in New York, had raised $70 million through 
two junk offerings in the 1980s. Now, according to Gedalio Grinberg, the 
chairman and chief executive, the company has had to drastically scale back 
plans for expansion and acquisitions. "The best thing to do is take a very 
conservative approach now," Grinberg says. "We won't even consider further 
acquisitions while this (junk bond) market is as it is." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the biggest junk bond offerings went to finance corporate raids that 
had little apparent economic benefit. But Milken and other proponents of junk 
bonds maintained that many offerings went directly to financing the growth of 
small entrepreneurial companies. Douglas Brengel, a senior corporate finance 
official in Salomon Bros.' Los Angeles office, says the excesses of junk bonds 
-- the kind of debt that led, for example, to the bankruptcy filings by Campeau 
Corp.'s retail units -- deserve to be swept away. He says, however, "The 
casualties are the 50% of the market or more that are the kinds of companies 
you're talking about -- growth-oriented companies that use this market as an 
alternative to more costly and restrictive sources of funds." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, there are plenty of small, entrepreneurial companies that raised 
money from junk and then promptly sank under the weight of the debt. Penril 
Corp., a small Maryland maker of data communications equipment, raised $18 
million through a Drexel junk offering in the mid-1980s. Management went on a 
buying spree and the company ended up in default. 
</P>
<P>
"Drexel told the people who were running the company then that money is 
available now; why don't you take it all now and do your expansion at once," 
says Henry David Epstein, who was brought in later as chairman and chief 
executive to turn around the company. 
</P>
<P>
But now, the company has returned to financial health. And Epstein says he 
would like nothing better than to do a junk offering himself. He can't because 
of the state of the junk market. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that the company is healthy, I'm expansion minded," he says, adding: "It 
would be great if I could issue some high-yield bonds to buy some things. But I 
can't. There really is no high-yield bond market left for a small company." 
</P>
<P>
Na-Churs Inc., an Ohio-based maker of liquid fertilizers, has had its ups and 
downs since Drexel completed a $20-million junk bond offering for it in 1981. 
In the late 1980s, the company did a leveraged buyout, mainly with internally 
generated cash. 
</P>
<P>
Now, according to company President John D. Kelly, Na-Churs is beginning to 
think about making an acquisition in 12 to 18 months. But he says the financing 
prospects are daunting. The company would have to give up a substantial amount 
of equity warrants to get the money it needs. Deals are being structured, he 
says, so that companies can buy back the warrants, regaining the ownership 
stake. But, he says, "In exchange for getting those warrants back you may be 
paying a very substantial sum." 
</P>
<P>
There is, of course, good old-fashioned internal growth -- development of new 
product lines, steadily building market share over time. But company executives 
say, in today's world, growth for smaller companies also rests on growth by 
acquisition, such as purchase of strategic product lines. In the current credit 
environment, executives at smaller companies say the giants have a distinct 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
DEP could raise money now, but only by agreeing to give up a big ownership 
stake to an investor. DEP's stock is traded publicly, and Berglass maintains 
that diluting current stockholders' ownership stake wouldn't be fair. 
</P>
<P>
Berglass says DEP and other small companies in the personal-care industry 
lately have had to sit back and watch while giant companies such as 
Colgate-Palmolive and Procter &amp; Gamble use their huge financial resources 
to gobble up successful brand names. 
</P>
<P>
For many companies, the situation at commercial banks is even more worrying 
than the state of the junk market itself. Most commercial banks have big 
exposure to loan losses from deals involving junk bond financing -- deals now 
referred to in banking parlance as highly leveraged transactions, or HLTs. 
</P>
<P>
Bank regulators, alarmed by the impact of junk bonds on the savings and loan 
industry, have begun pressuring commercial banks to separate out their HLT 
loans in financial reports and to monitor their lending practices more closely. 
As a result, many banks seem to have become much stricter about the kinds of 
commercial loans they will make, as well as the conditions they attach to them. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Abraham, senior vice president and chief financial officer of Security 
Pacific's Middle Market Bank, which lends to medium-sized companies, maintains 
that Security Pacific has always applied stringent standards to commercial 
loans and isn't tightening up. But he says banks in general throughout the 
country seem to be raising their standards. And, significantly, he says fewer 
smaller banks and foreign institutions now are willing to take parts of 
syndicated loans. Such big syndicated loans, in which the actual lending is 
divided among a series of institutions, have been an important alternative to 
junk financing for smaller companies. 
</P>
<P>
Banks are becoming stricter, too, because they are under pressure to boost 
their capital by the end of the year to meet new requirements. 
</P>
<P>
For a small but not insignificant sector of industry, the specific impact of 
the demise of Drexel itself seems to be having a negative impact. Drexel's 
parent company went into bankruptcy proceedings in February and has begun 
liquidating the company. When Milken and Drexel were building the junk bond 
market in the late 1970s, they invented the idea of creating new junk bonds to 
provide capital to smaller companies. Previously, junk bonds were all "fallen 
angels" -- the bonds of previously investment-grade companies that had fallen 
on hard times. So Drexel became the investment banker to hundreds of companies 
in which no other Wall Street firm was interested. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Wall Street firms are engaged in a feeding frenzy, courting the Drexel 
customers that were transformed by junk bonds into giants. But, for the most 
part, they're not interested in today's smaller companies, including some that 
had obtained financing relatively recently through Drexel. Brengel of Salomon 
Bros. says with a few exceptions, investment banks are unlikely to be 
interested in companies with $100 million or less in sales. 
</P>
<P>
The general decline in the securities industry is also likely to have an 
impact. Because of falling profits at Wall Street firms, many are reducing the 
size of the corporate finance departments. And the type of deals that can get 
done now produce much slimmer commissions, making them less attractive. 
</P>
<P>
In general, the only kinds of high-yield financings that can get done these 
days are private placements of debt in which the buyer of the debt securities 
-- such as insurance companies or foreign banks -- demand warrants or some 
other sort of equity stake. For investment banks, commissions on such private 
placements tend to be about 2% of the financing, as opposed to the 5% or 6% 
that was common on public offerings of junk bonds, providing less incentive for 
the Wall Street firms to do the deals. Although in the current environment 
investment banks probably will have to get used to doing smaller deals, 
executives at smaller companies say they don't see signs of it yet. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller West Coast companies may be at a particular disadvantage, since several 
Wall Street firms have announced plans to close or reduce the size of their 
West Coast offices. 
</P>
<P>
Salomon has actually expanded its West Coast presence recently. But Brengel 
acknowledges that for smaller companies, for better or for worse, "a lot of the 
deals that did get done in the past just aren't getting done now."

JAMES FLANIGAN: ENVIRONMENTALISM AS ECONOMIC ENGINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sky is not falling and the end of the earth is not nigh. And if you think 
through the current environmental crisis, you'll see solutions more than 
problems -- and signs of new industries emerging. 
</P>
<P>
First, though, it's important to understand that environmental problems are in 
many ways an economic signal, a symptom like fever in the body, pointing to 
areas where true costs are not being recognized. The environmental movement is 
not an enemy of the economic system -- though it certainly attracts its share 
of cultists -- but a rigorous accountant of it. 
</P>
<P>
By the same token, industry and technology -- and not a Luddite retreat -- will 
solve environmental problems. In fact, it's a fair bet that biotechnology will 
be a big part of the environmental solution, just as microchips helped 
alleviate the energy crisis of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
But that gets ahead of the story. Today is Earth Day, and concern for the 
environment is being celebrated everywhere, as it was marked last week by the 
White House conference on global warming -- the theory that carbon dioxide 
emissions from burning coal and oil have set up a climatic effect that will 
increase the earth's temperature and turn farmland into desert, even while 
melting ice caps and flooding coastlines. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush called for further research on global warming, while European 
delegates wanted immediate action on the problem. "Bush is right, we don't know 
enough about long-term climatic change," says Allan Kneese, senior fellow of 
Resources for the Future, a Washington research group that has been studying 
environmental change for three decades. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, he's right. For curbing carbon dioxide, the United States already has 
clean-air laws that are far more rigorous than any in Europe. But the global 
climate is a new kind of question on which data is either contradictory or 
incomplete. The problem isn't new -- carbon dioxide has been accumulating in 
the atmosphere for centuries -- but awareness of it is. And at such times we 
have better questions than answers. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the record is reassuring. The first Earth Day, in 1970, was concerned with 
polluted rivers and air and came eight years after the late marine biologist 
Rachel Carson published "Silent Spring." She said pesticides, such as DDT, and 
effluent from factories were killing fish and plant life. And though industry 
and farm groups initially attacked her, Carson was right. Agriculture had 
failed to recognize side effects in DDT, and industry had failed to account 
properly for waste disposal. Pollution, in fact, can treble the cost of using 
water -- even for industrial purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Now those problems have been solved, not perfectly perhaps, but Lake Erie is 
cleaner and edible fish live again in New York's Hudson River. The sulfur and 
particulates that were the chief air pollution concerns in 1970 have been 
sharply reduced. 
</P>
<P>
So we are addressing other problems, longer in time and broader in geography. 
We now see that a power plant in Ohio can send acid rain to Maine; that garbage 
leaks poison into soil and water, and toxic waste is lasting. 
</P>
<P>
The problems -- holes in the stratospheric ozone layer above Antarctica -- 
often seem beyond our power to affect. But environmental history shows that the 
human mind comes up with solutions almost as problems appear. 
</P>
<P>
It was that way with energy. In the 1970s, the conventional wisdom said that 
energy would be scarce forevermore and economic growth would stall because it 
was believed that a 1% increase in energy use was needed to produce a 1% rise 
in economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
Then all that changed. Today it takes less than one-half of 1% growth in energy 
to produce a 1% rise in the economy, and the trend is down. 
</P>
<P>
What happened? A rise in the price of oil made everyone aware of wasteful usage 
-- of less-than-fuel-efficient cars and homes and industrial practices. The 
solution was conservation and the downsizing of machinery with the aid of 
memory chips and processors. 
</P>
<P>
The United States uses no more crude petroleum today than it did in 1970, and 
uses less iron ore and steel, lead and copper. Downsizing caused economic 
dislocation -- people lost jobs, some communities were devastated -- but not 
economic ruin. Instead, a new economy emerged, based on the use of less raw 
material and more plastics (a derivative of petroleum). 
</P>
<P>
The use of plastic in the United States has gone way up as new wonder materials 
have reduced the weight in cars and airplanes, drainage pipes and backpacks. 
</P>
<P>
But we are becoming aware of another cost: Plastics do not break down in 
nature. "Plastic simply accumulates in landfills, leading to toxicity," says 
Barry Commoner, a long-time environmentalist and professor at New York's Queens 
College. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is economic as much as environmental. Plastics are relatively 
cheap, but that may be because disposal costs aren't being recognized. So now 
plastics prices should go up to account for the cost of making them degradable, 
and other materials -- glass, recyclable paper -- will regain some markets. 
</P>
<P>
The trend in environmental policy is to stress economic incentives and 
preventing pollution as opposed to only reducing it, says James K. Hammitt of 
Rand Corp., which advises the government on environmental matters. That means 
consuming different fuels rather than putting scrubbers on power plants, and 
using recycled or entirely new materials rather than simply cutting back on the 
use of polluting materials. 
</P>
<P>
And that policy opens the way for advances in biotech -- the use of living 
organisms as commercial products -- in both industry and agriculture. There are 
more biogenetic products than ever up for Department of Agriculture approval, 
says Alan Goldhammer of the Industrial Biotechnology Assn. in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
They are overdue because the economic and environmental laws of diminishing 
returns from chemical fertilizers and additives set in a long time ago. Yields 
in U.S. cornfields, for example, grew 5% a year for more than two decades after 
World War II -- from 45 bushels per acre to 145. But then they stopped growing, 
and since the mid-'70s the soil has demanded more fertilizer and water to 
maintain the same yields. 
</P>
<P>
But now environmental accountants are questioning the low prices farmers are 
charged for federal water, as well as hazards from chemical fertilizers. So 
enter biological products, which can encourage growth by duplicating the crop's 
own hormones while conserving water by giving a crop the water-storing 
characteristics of a semi-arid plant such as the palm. 
</P>
<P>
Is that tampering with nature? No, it's in the great tradition of U.S. 
agronomist Norman Borlaug, who in the 1940s -- working in Mexico as the world 
raged in war -- cross-bred shoots of rice and wheat to make them resistant to 
disease and weather damage. His work, for which he was given the Nobel Peace 
Prize -- brought about the green revolution in Asia, saving millions from 
famine and bringing Asia the economic growth we see today. 
</P>
<P>
Will environmental concerns stop economic growth? On the contrary, says Oliver 
Nicklin, head of Chicago's First Analysis Corp., an investment firm 
specializing in environmental companies, "you can't have economic growth 
without dealing with the environment."

GUTSY COMPUTER MAKER SCORES A TURNAROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. companies have been about as successful selling personal computers in 
Tokyo as the Japanese were at selling Hondas in Detroit 20 years ago. Even 
deep-pocketed Apple Computer has had little success selling a Japanese-language 
version of its Macintosh machine in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
So when AST Research announced April 10 that it would become the first U.S. 
company to sell a clone of NEC Corp.'s popular PC in Japan, many on Wall Street 
expressed skepticism about the risky venture. 
</P>
<P>
But others say the surprise move exhibits the kind of boldness that may set 
Irvine-based AST apart from the pack of upstarts chasing the PC industry's "Big 
Three" -- International Business Machines, Compaq Computer and Apple. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a gutsy move to take on NEC," said Bruce Stephen, an industry analyst 
with International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass. "But clearly with a U.S. 
market that is maturing, you have to move international to break away from 
other computer makers." 
</P>
<P>
Safi Qureshey and Tom Yuen, two immigrant engineers who have helped build AST 
into America's ninth-largest computer maker, say they're determined to break 
into a market dominated by NEC and seize a chunk of the fast-growing, 
$5.6-billion personal computer market in Japan. And they note, with just a bit 
of cockiness, that the skeptics on Wall Street have been dead wrong about the 
company before. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen months ago, analysts and investors had pretty much written off the 
small Irvine PC maker after it suffered a series of setbacks: 
</P>
<P>
* The abrupt resignation of co-founder Albert Wong, AST's chief technology 
officer, in November, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
* A slowdown in AST's sales as it and other PC makers were hit by an 
industry-wide slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
* The announcement in January, 1989, of the company's first-ever quarterly 
loss, a whopping $8.9-million deficit. 
</P>
<P>
* The layoff of 6% of AST's work force, the firm's first job cuts. 
</P>
<P>
But 18 months after Wong resigned, AST has executed an impressive turnaround 
that has the investment community singing its praises again. Its stock price 
has surged from about $6 a share in January, 1989, to more than $23 this week. 
And while industry titans such as Compaq are reporting haphazard quarterly 
results, AST last week reported its highest quarterly sales and earnings ever, 
outperforming analysts' expectations for the fifth quarter in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"When Albert left, it provided us with a golden moment to re-examine ourselves 
and why we went through a slump," said Yuen, chief operating officer and one of 
the company's founders. "I suppose that 1 1/2 years has been a good test of the 
departure." 
</P>
<P>
AST's recovery is attributed to a number of moves that have slashed corporate 
overhead and cleaned up the firm's balance sheet. The company has sold off two 
product lines, pushed new products out the door faster and placed its computers 
in the hands of more retailers. 
</P>
<P>
Qureshey and Yuen say these efforts are part of their goal to join the 
industry's top ranks upgrade the computer, the circuit board can be quickly 
replaced without redesigning the entire machine. 
</P>
<P>
Since customers can upgrade their computers quickly and inexpensively, they 
need not worry about obsolescence, Qureshey says. To further emphasize speed, 
AST built a new manufacturing plant in Fountain Valley that can be set up to 
handle new products within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
The shift to high-performance machines is also based on a strategic vision. 
Qureshey sees opportunity to make inroads into the weakening $30-billion 
minicomputer industry, which is being squeezed between supercomputers and 
ever-faster PCs. Minicomputer customers who need to replace their equipment are 
ripe for the picking, he says. 
</P>
<P>
With 25% market saturation, the PC market is becoming a replacement market, 
with users seeking to inexpensively upgrade to better models, said Stephen 
Smith, analyst at PaineWebber in New York. 
</P>
<P>
AST hasn't always been the fastest to market. It has been slow to break into 
the rapidly growing portable laptop market, now dominated by Toshiba Corp. and 
Zenith Data Systems. AST says it is developing a laptop model and hopes to 
bring it to market within the next year. 
</P>
<P>
AST hopes to move faster in building its name overseas. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine-based firm is building a computer factory in Europe in preparation 
for the liberalization of Western European trade in 1992. And company officials 
have been crisscrossing the globe to develop markets in the Far East, Eastern 
Europe, the Soviet Union, Pakistan, India and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Qureshey journeyed to the Soviet Union in February as part of an exhibition of 
U.S. computer systems. The marketing effort was a shotgun approach to getting 
new business, but Qureshey said the trip "planted some seeds" in a market with 
huge potential. 
</P>
<P>
While domestic PC sales are expected to grow 13% this year, international sales 
will grow faster. International sales accounted for 38% of AST's revenue last 
year, and Qureshey would like to see that figure pass 50% within a year. 
</P>
<P>
AST is not the only firm to pursue overseas sales. Most computer firms are 
diversifying into international markets and companies such as Compaq already 
derive half their revenue from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Given the past acceptance of U.S. products in Japan and the falling yen, which 
makes U.S. products more expensive overseas, AST's venture in Japan is risky, 
said JoeAnn Stahel, president of Storeboard/Computer Intelligence, a Dallas 
market research firm. 
</P>
<P>
But Qureshey and Yuen are proud to be carrying the flag of American computer 
manufacturing to Japanese soil, noting how U.S. trade officials have described 
the venture as a test of Japan's willingness to accept competitive imports. 
</P>
<P>
Many business users are replacing older PCs with more powerful ones. AST could 
benefit if those users preferred inexpensive upgrades, said Stephen Smith, 
analyst at PaineWebber in New York. 
</P>
<P>
AST, which spent two years and millions of dollars researching the project, 
isn't betting the company on the success of the Japanese venture. With $77 
million in cash on its books, AST can wait for long-term results. 
</P>
<P>
Closer to home, AST has always struggled to get its product on retailers' 
shelves, where space is scarce and where IBM, Apple and Compaq are dominant. 
AST has been part of the pack of companies competing to be the "alternative" 
brand. 
</P>
<P>
In the past years, however, AST has signed up such major retailers as 
Computerland, Micro Age and Sears Business Systems Centers to carry its 
products. Its sales through computer stores have doubled in the past year, 
Stahel said. 
</P>
<P>
"The company is no longer sales-driven," said Wong, who earlier this year 
started a small computer company in Irvine. "They look at the bottom line a lot 
more, and that's a credit to Tom and Safi. The loss in 1988 forced them to look 
at the financial side." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the recent cost savings has been invested in new capacity. Besides 
building the Fountain Valley plant, AST moved into a new $30-million 
headquarters complex in the Irvine Spectrum Business Park. 
</P>
<P>
AST's plants make computers for Tandem Computer and Texas Instruments, which 
then sell the machines under their own brand names and will likely add another 
agreement in the near future. Qureshey said such agreements further distinguish 
AST in the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
Qureshey likens AST's strategy in the PC market to the one that Honda pursued 
in automobiles. By selling high-quality, moderately priced products, AST hopes 
that customers will return to buy its higher-priced models.

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS: U.S. ECONOMIC BOOM IN '60S BEAT 'GREATEST' IN '80S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID M. GORDON, DAVID M. GORDON is professor of economics at the New School 
for Social Research in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Has the recent business cycle expansion been the "greatest ever"? This may seem 
to many readers like flaying a dead horse, but I will once again devote this 
column to a critique of recent claims by Martin Anderson, former Reagan White 
House adviser, that the "Reagan Boom . . . was the greatest economic expansion 
the world has ever seen -- in any country, at any time." 
</P>
<P>
I challenged that conclusion in my last column on Feb. 25, arguing in some 
detail that Anderson's claims were misplaced. As might have been expected, 
Anderson complained about my column in a letter to the editor, charging that I 
had "never refuted (his) main point" and that I had perpetrated "more shoddy 
research and illogical reasoning in fewer words" than he had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
Excerpts of Anderson's letter were published in this section March 18. Since 
space constraints prevented my being able to reply to his charges then and 
there, I promised that I would respond in my next column. Being a man of my 
word, I now offer my response. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson complained vigorously in his letter, indulging in some gratuitous 
red-baiting while he was at it. But he both failed to respond to the arguments 
I made in my piece and tried to change the rules of the game in the process. 
</P>
<P>
I argued in my original column that the comparisons he made in his original 
piece, in supporting his claims of "world records," were misconceived in three 
important ways: 
</P>
<P>
1. It makes little sense to compare an economy's absolute volume of expansion 
in jobs and output, instead of their expansion relative to the size of the 
economy. If a 1% annual increase in employment in China resulted in as many as 
5 million new jobs, I asked, would we argue that its economy was growing more 
robustly than the U.S. economy in which a 2.6% annual increase in 1986-87 
generated "only" 2.8 million new jobs? Claims of greatness should focus, in 
other words, on growth relative to the previous size of the economy, not the 
absolute volume of the growth. 
</P>
<P>
2. It seems similarly misguided to talk about the nominal value of output 
expansion, rather than its real value. And yet Anderson had offered as evidence 
of "greatness" the cumulative increase in nominal GNP, uncorrected for 
inflation. Conservatives had rightly ex pressed concern about rampant inflation 
in the late 1970s. Shouldn't they therefore assess their own record of output 
expansion by correcting for inflation rather than claiming price-inflated 
nominal output growth as part of their achievement? 
</P>
<P>
3. It is misleading, finally, to comment on the pace of expansion from the 
bottom of a recession without also taking into account the depth of that 
recession; real net investment grew by 50% from 1982 through 1989, for example, 
but it had previously declined by roughly half from 1979 to 1982 and was in 
fact lower in 1989 than it had been in 1979. Is this rapid expansion or limp 
recovery from a devastating recession? Anderson ignored these problems, 
earnestly repeating his claims about "GNP produced (and) jobs created" from the 
trough of the 1980-82 recession. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson also suggested that we play by different rules than he had earlier 
followed. In his original piece, for example, he had claimed that the number of 
jobs created between 1982 and 1989 by itself "was a world record. Never before 
had so many jobs been created during a comparable time period." 
</P>
<P>
In direct response to that claim, I simply pointed to other periods and places 
with greater relative employment expansion. In his letter, Anderson argued that 
we must "apply the same multiple criteria to each" business cycle, ignoring his 
earlier advertisements for world records along single dimensions of 
performance. The problem with Anderson's subsequent challenge, however, is that 
economists do not uniformly agree on the set of multiple criteria by which we 
should judge business cycles or periods of expansion; there is certainly no 
consensus that the four "normal criteria" he listed -- GNP produced, jobs 
created, successive months of continuous growth and change in the value of the 
stock market -- are either the most important or the only relevant standards. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Anderson persevered, insisting that I play by his rules. He closed his 
letter: "By definition, one of America's economic expansions has to be our 
greatest one; perhaps someday Professor Gordon will let us all know which one 
he thinks is the greatest." 
</P>
<P>
OK. Since I'm a sporting fellow, I'll play the game even though I would 
continue to argue that comparisons of expansions alone, instead of 
business-cycle averages, can be highly misleading. Limiting myself to the U.S. 
economy in the post-World War II period, for which data is the most readily 
comparable, I choose the long expansion of the 1960s as uniformly more 
impressive than the long expansion of the 1980s, judging throughout by relative 
and not absolute rates of growth. (I ignore here Anderson's criterion of stock 
market inflation, since stock market surges can just as easily indicate 
financial fragility -- witness the late 1920s in the United States or the 
recent Tokyo stock market -- as they can reflect sustainable economic 
strength.) 
</P>
<P>
* Using standard National Bureau of Economic Research business-cycle dating, 
the 1960s expansion lasted from the first quarter of 1961 to the fourth quarter 
of 1969, a total of 36 quarters. From the fourth quarter of 1982 to the fourth 
quarter of 1989, the recent expansion had continued for 29 quarters; it still 
has seven quarters to go before it even ties the record. Will it make it before 
giving way to stagnation or recession? We'll soon find out, but in any case, it 
was not yet, when Anderson wrote in January, 1990, the "longest expansion 
ever." 
</P>
<P>
* Real output growth in the 1960s expansion was 37.2% over its initial value, 
compared to 27.7% in the 1980s case. 
</P>
<P>
* Employment growth was much closer, with 17.8% in the 1960s case and 17.2% in 
the 1980s expansion. But rapid employment growth by itself may be a sign of 
weakness, not strength, since it may reflect sluggish productivity growth . . . 
so let's continue. 
</P>
<P>
* Real hourly productivity increased by 22.3% in the 1960s expansion but by 
only 12.4% in Anderson's "greatest ever." 
</P>
<P>
* What about real net fixed non-residential investment, a measure of an 
economy's commitment to its future productive potential? It increased by 101.7% 
from 1961 to 1969 but by only 51.7% from 1982 to 1988 (the last year for which 
data is available). 
</P>
<P>
Oh, by the way, wouldn't it make sense to ask how people fared during these 
expansions -- a dimension of economic performance that Anderson conveniently 
neglects? One might reasonably argue, after all, that it is people's well-being 
that economic expansions are supposed to promote. 
</P>
<P>
Real median family income grew by 29.4% from 1961 to 1969 but by only 9.8% from 
1982 to 1988 (the latest year for which data is available). Real spendable 
hourly earnings for production and non-supervisory employees, a measure of the 
hourly take-home for the vast majority of wage and salary employees, rose by 
9.6% from 1962 to 1969 but did not increase at all, remaining exactly the same, 
between 1982 and 1988 (the latest year for which data is available). 
</P>
<P>
The expansion of the 1980s was so limp, indeed, that present growth was 
financed by borrowing from the future. Many write about the federal debt. But 
of even greater concern has been runaway private debt during the 1980s 
expansion. We can measure the private debt burden by comparing total private 
financial and nonfinancial debt -- including debt owed by financial 
institutions, households, farms, nonfinancial corporations and nonfinancial 
noncorporations -- with total gross product. By this measure, the private debt 
burden increased by 29% during the period of expansion from 1982 to 1988. By 
contrast, the private debt burden increased by only 15% -- roughly half the 
increase in relative indebtedness -- from 1962 to 1969. 
</P>
<P>
"By definition," Anderson concludes, "one of America's economic expansions has 
to be our greatest one." Sorry, Mr. Anderson, but it wasn't the one you helped 
shepherd from the White House.

MARKETING BEEF PROVES TO BE A DIFFICULT TASK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA L. La GANGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Beef: Real Food for Real People" just doesn't do the job. Maybe it's because 
spokesman James Garner went down with quintuple-bypass heart surgery. Or 
because spokeswoman Cybill Shepherd was quoted as saying that she, well, never 
really ate much of the stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe the real fault lies in how beef is sold -- as a commodity, not a 
series of specific products. Combine that with generic advertising's spotty 
record and chicken's soaring popularity and what do you have: The lowest 
consumption of beef in 25 years, a mere 77 pounds per capita in 1987, the most 
recent statistics available. 
</P>
<P>
"The value of advertising a generic product (beef) is generally considered to 
be less effective than brand name advertising," said a recent study by the 
National Cattlemen's Assn. 
</P>
<P>
One solution to the problem is so-called branded beef, a seemingly simple 
concept. Slap a handle on your hamburger and hope that the public will bite. 
Sounds logical, for after all, nearly everything else is sold that way. 
</P>
<P>
But so far, the concept has not taken off. The cattlemen's association study 
blames economics: "Development of new, differentiated (brand-promoted) products 
consistent with consumer preference for convenience is slowed as packers strive 
to maintain volume and margins at the expense of research and development." 
</P>
<P>
To John Francis, executive vice president of marketing for the National Live 
Stock and Meat Board, the problem is that major meatpackers just haven't 
progressed very far along the "learning curve." 
</P>
<P>
"A couple years ago there were three or four dozen branded products," Francis 
said. "Now there's under a dozen. That's an indication of the kind of learning 
curve our industry has to go through. . . . Right now, I'm not sure (branded 
beef) measures on the Richter scale. In the total scheme of things it's very, 
very small." 
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, Monfort Inc., a subsidiary of ConAgra, has poured 
nearly $1 million into the research and development of branded products. The 
results have been dismal. 
</P>
<P>
The firm has three failures under its belt, has never gotten a branded product 
past the test-market stage and currently has no branded product on the market, 
said Joseph Meilinger, Monfort's vice president for marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Monfort Cooked Meats -- a line of prepackaged meat loaf and barbecued ribs -- 
debuted and died in 1985. Prepackaged, retail-ready lamb, all vacuum packed and 
bearing the Monfort American Gourmet label, was unveiled in 1987 and withdrawn 
in 1988. In that same time frame, the company tried out a labeling program 
called Monfort Gold, but only one market chain opted to decorate its meat packs 
with the company's labels. And not for long. 
</P>
<P>
"We've tried different things," Meilinger said. "They haven't been successful. 
We are not daunted. We will continue to work with the retailers and consumers 
and bring them a product. . . . But the American consumer is very difficult to 
please in this area. You can't just sell them a pig in a poke." 
</P>
<P>
With 42 items from brisket to top sirloin steak in its product line, Excel Inc. 
is the only Big Three meatpacker that currently offers customers branded beef. 
At the behest of Kroger Inc., a major supermarket chain, Excel launched its 
branded beef in Kroger markets in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"The one way, and a significant way, to influence demand for beef is to 
differentiate it from other products," said Herbert Meischen, Excel's vice 
president for marketing. "The only tool in most markets is price and item, like 
offering the chuck roast this week at $1.29. If you want a big piece, you get a 
big un'. If you want a small one, you get a small un'." 
</P>
<P>
More differentiation is necessary, gives you something to advertise and just is 
what Excel offers throughout the South, Meischen said. While Excel will not 
divulge specifics, Meischen said the branded items are doing well. 
</P>
<P>
But few branded beef concerns are as successful as Coleman Natural Meats Inc., 
a Denver firm that sells antibiotic-free and hormone-free beef and lamb in 35 
states and had $20 million in sales in fiscal 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The company started selling natural beef to retailers in 1979, but did not come 
out with a line of prepackaged meats until five months ago. What that means is 
that, originally, you could wander into a Mrs. Gooch's Natural Foods Market and 
find slabs of Coleman beef that were cut into saleable form by a butcher. 
</P>
<P>
With the prepackaging program, cut, wrapped and labeled meats are delivered to 
markets for display in regular refrigerator counters. Four market chains 
currently offer prepackaged Coleman Natural Beef, said Mel Coleman Jr., the 
company's director of sales and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
"Our whole program is designed around producing natural and organic food 
products raised using ecologically focused principles," Coleman said. "The 
reason we're doing prepackaging is because, like the rest of the industry, 
that's where we think the future is going to be."

WHICH IS THE BETTER INVESTMENT, REAL ESTATE OR THE STOCK MARKET? THE DEBATE 
CONTINUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding "Real Estate vs. Stocks: Which is Better," no argument when you buy 
rental property so that the rents always cover the debt service and you have 
tax benefits from the debt service and depreciation. 
</P>
<P>
However, one gives up liquidity to own real estate, which makes it sometimes 
totally out of the question for retirees, small pension plans, etc. Also, if 
the rents don't cover the cash flow or are interrupted, you have negative cash 
flow. That's like buying IBM stock and paying them the dividend while you hope 
it goes up in value. It also assumes one always "qualifies" for the loan, which 
is not necessary with buying stock or mutual funds, let alone the hassles of 
being a landlord. 
</P>
<P>
Surveys point out that few people in this area can afford to buy a home. Couple 
that with the downsizing of the defense industry employers and you have a 
serious question about the (real estate) demand factor. Assumptions about 
break-evens in rents or appreciation may not be as well founded as in the past.

WHICH IS THE BETTER INVESTMENT, REAL ESTATE OR THE STOCK MARKET? THE DEBATE 
CONTINUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a financial analyst and registered investment adviser, I think "Strategy 
Switch for Profiting in Home Market" attempts to prove and persuade that 
residential real estate has and continues to supersede investments in the stock 
market. Unfortunately, the mathematics behind this assumption was poorly done 
and the conclusions reached incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
Except for maybe a dozen houses on the waterfront in Orange County, both the 
Dow Jones and the S&amp;P 500 outperformed residential homes during the 1980s 
by a wide margin (both indexes showed about 18% annual returns) and will likely 
do so in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
The reason your article comes to a different conclusion is because substantial 
pieces of data were entirely left out of the analysis. The article apparently 
assumes that there are no carrying costs to owning real estate. If you leave 
these very substantial costs out of the analysis, real estate looks good. But 
in real life, these are real costs. 
</P>
<P>
These overlooked costs include the non-deductible portion of each month's 
interest payment (about 67%); the non-deductible portion of property taxes 
(again 67%) and all non-deductible maintenance costs. 
</P>
<P>
Residential real estate is not and has not been a great investment. It's 
sometimes better than renting, but it's main value is to provide shelter, not 
accumulate wealth. 
</P>
<P>
I notice that the hypothetical examples (in the story) were provided by real 
estate salespeople who not coincidentally have a strong interest in presenting 
a favorable case for home purchase.

DEFINING INDUSTRY'S ENVIRONMENTAL ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Less than a decade after one of the most toxic chemicals known to mankind was 
cavalierly sprayed on the roads of Times Beach, Mo., turning it into a ghost 
town, businesses across the nation have rallied to the cause of the 
environment. Today's celebration of the 20th anniversary of Earth Day has more 
corporate backers than its founders ever imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 But how far has business really come in terms of forging a proper 
environmental role? Sharon Bernstein asked six leading executives, economists 
and environmentalists for their wish list of what corporate America should do 
to improve the environment: 
</P>
<P>
ALICE M. RIVLIN 
</P>
<P>
Economist at the Brookings Institution, chairman of the governing council of 
the Wilderness Society and a director of Union Carbide 
</P>
<P>
I'd like to see business, particularly major businesses that have an impact on 
the environment, take a long-range view. In the long run, business can't 
operate profitably if it is degrading the environment. From the quite selfish 
point of view of the individual company, it needs to have not only an image, 
but a real program for being a responsible environmental citizen. This means 
taking care of toxic waste, avoiding pollution and other damaging emissions. It 
means working with communities to avoid environmental damage. 
</P>
<P>
It's sometimes difficult for companies to be as environmentally responsible as 
they'd like to be, because it's costly in the short run. That's part of the 
general problem of short-run focus in American companies. But I think if they 
take a long-range view, especially with the rising concern about the 
environment in the general public, it's clear that long-term profitability will 
be aided by environmental responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
FRED KRUPP 
</P>
<P>
Executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund 
</P>
<P>
Corporations should recognize that there's an exploding demand from individuals 
and societies for them to invest in developing environmentally sound products, 
not just in developing ad campaigns that sound environmental. Seventy percent 
of consumers polled say they want products that are environmentally sound. Some 
corporations have realized that those who produce the truly good products to 
meet this demand will be the most competitive. The stakes are not only 
environmental quality but the very competitiveness of the American business 
sector. Because if our own businesses don't wake up to this demand, our 
consumers will have to seek foreign sources for these products. 
</P>
<P>
Because the greenhouse effect is an environmental problem of overriding 
importance, the most important products that corporations need to supply us 
with are high efficiency appliances, high mileage automobiles and ways of 
powering our society with renewable energy. 
</P>
<P>
The advertising agencies have given us a throwaway society and effortless 
housekeeping, where instead of rubbing the stains out, we spray them away with 
more and more toxic cleaners. We've got to move to nontoxic products. We've got 
to stop pretending that choosing between paper and plastic bags in the 
supermarket involves any real choice, and instead start doing what the 
Europeans have been doing for years: use convenient string bags. We've got to 
move away from disposable razors and disposable pens, and toward durable goods. 
</P>
<P>
The economy of the next 40 years will have to go through a massive 
restructuring. There will be certain goods that will be produced in much 
smaller quantities, but there will be whole new markets for environmentally 
sound goods. It's a major transition, but we've done it before. We've gone from 
candles to electric lights, we've gone from wood burning stoves to coal, and 
from coal to oil. 
</P>
<P>
DEAN L. BUNTROCK 
</P>
<P>
Chairman of Waste Management Inc. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to see every company take a fresh look at the relationship between 
its business and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
The board of Waste Management adopted a new, strong environmental policy on 
March 7, which includes principles for compliance, pollution prevention and 
nature conservation, as well as for positive public policy, environmental 
education and cooperation with environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
It also sets forth a commitment to report annually on our environmental 
performance. I would like to see other companies adopt similar environmental 
policies, tailored to their specific businesses. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to see federal and state agencies implement enforcement programs 
that more effectively ensure that everyone subject to environmental laws is in 
compliance. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to see business, government and environmental groups, whenever 
appropriate, make more of an effort to work cooperatively on solving 
environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
Warfare in the press and courts often simply creates barriers and delays 
finding solutions to environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
RICHARD J. MAHONEY 
</P>
<P>
Chairman and chief executive, Monsanto Corp. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to see business as part of the solution and not as part of the 
problem. We have decided we're going to be part of the solution -- for Monsanto 
to have zero affect on the environment. That takes time. We started with a very 
important pledge on air emissions, to reduce them 90% by the end of 1992. But 
our real intention was to reduce air emissions to zero. And we have similar 
programs for all of the environmental effects of Monsanto. 
</P>
<P>
I can't speak for everybody in the business community and I can't speak for all 
issues because there are some very intractable problems that don't befall us at 
Monsanto. But I think if you're in a leadership role you can call on your own 
people's creative energies to solve the problem, rather than waiting for some 
person, whether regulator or legislator, to thrust on you a solution that may 
not be appropriate to you. 
</P>
<P>
When you cut all through it, maybe the simplest answer is that it's the right 
thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
In the last couple of weeks, I find very troublesome the amount of pot shots at 
corporations as somehow having newly discovered Earth Day. There are some very 
sincere efforts to do what the public and we want to do, and ours is one of 
them. These are not publicity stunts. 
</P>
<P>
WILLIAM D. RUCKELSHAUS 
</P>
<P>
Chairman and chief executive of Browning-Ferris Inc., a Houston-based waste 
disposal company, and former director of the Environmental Protection Agency 
</P>
<P>
Fundamentally, the most important thing business could do is comply with the 
rules and regulations established by the government for the conduct of their 
activities. If every business did that, our environment would be an appreciably 
cleaner place. 
</P>
<P>
I think the really big environmental problems that we are going to face in the 
future are global problems, and what business could do on its own that would 
have the most beneficial effect would be to make sure that whenever they 
establish any kind of facilities abroad, they hold themselves to the same 
standards that they would be held to at home. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the resulting environmental problems could threaten, if not mankind, 
then at least free institutions. 
</P>
<P>
J. MICHAEL McCLOSKEY 
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Sierra Club 
</P>
<P>
Businesses ought to realize that they can better assure their future in 
American society and prosper more by being environmental leaders. They ought to 
do what StarKist did in saying it's only going to sell dolphin-safe tuna, or 
what Conoco did in saying that their new ships are going to be double hulled. 
</P>
<P>
It's not enough to wait for and comply with regulations. The regulations can 
never adequately catch up with what they're really doing. Thousands of new 
chemicals are developed every year and processes and products keep changing. 
The burdens to the environment keep changing all the time with a dynamic 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
Frankly, American industries have not been good environmental citizens. Some of 
them have been, but too many of them thought they could get away with whatever 
they could and postpone the day of compliance as long as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Thank goodness there are some industrial leaders that recognize that a time for 
a change has come. We need more of them.

BALDWIN HILLS ESTATES WEIGHS PLAN FOR GATED COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A while back, Baldwin Hills Estates was one of those neighborhoods people liked 
to refer to as a well-kept secret. 
</P>
<P>
But that anonymity ended nearly five years ago when a devastating arson fire 
swept through the community, catapulting it into the national spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
"The news went all over the country," said Joseph Gardner, the president of the 
Baldwin Hills Estates Homeowners Assn. "And that's when America saw that all 
those expensive homes were owned by black people." 
</P>
<P>
Curiosity seekers flooded into the area to view the devastation, and later to 
see the elegant homes being rebuilt. Residents say the neighborhood continues 
to attract such unwanted traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the residents have become concerned that they face a growing threat of 
crime. Although the community traditionally has had few such problems, police 
categorize an adjacent apartment community as a high-crime area, sparking 
worries in Baldwin Hills Estates. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the residents of Baldwin Hills Estates, a wealthy black community 
where many of the streets take their names from Spanish noblemen, are 
considering a proposal to make their neighborhood a gated community. 
</P>
<P>
"At first people came to see what the fire had done, then they came to see the 
homes being rebuilt," said Geraldine White, whose home was one of 53 destroyed 
in the fire on June 2, 1985. Another 13 homes were damaged and three people 
were killed. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it seems whenever someone comes to town, people bring them up here to look 
at our homes," White said. 
</P>
<P>
One-thousand households in the hills have been asked to vote on the proposal at 
a community meeting April 28. The balloting will be held at the site where the 
fire was the most destructive, at the intersection of Don Diego and Don Carlos 
drives. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, seven electronic gates would be used to cut off pedestrian and 
auto access to the isolated hillside community. Homeowners would be able to 
operate the automated gates with a device similar to a garage-door opener and 
from their homes by phone to let in visitors. Police and fire departments and 
other city agencies would be given access codes to operate the gates. 
</P>
<P>
The installation of the gates would cost $225,000, or about $225 per household. 
If 51% of the residents approve the plan, Gardner said, the next step would be 
to collect funds. A $25 payment would be needed from 85% of the residents for 
the plan to go forward, and the group would have to obtain approval from the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, the idea has picked up considerable support. 
</P>
<P>
"I think putting up gates is a great idea," said Mary Bryant, who also lost her 
home to fire. "The neighborhood is changing around us. There are problems with 
robberies, vandalism. I think a gate would give us a more secure feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the plan also cite the positive effect the gates would have on 
property values. "The system will more than pay for itself, plus the value of 
individual 'peace of mind' cannot be calculated," read a leaflet publicizing 
the plan. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone agrees. "There are still a lot of questions left unanswered," 
said Patrick Brown, a resident. "It seems ridiculous to have a gate without 
having someone manning it. And where are the traffic studies? What they have 
come up with is a gate that is going to monitor itself. I don't see it." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, whose district includes Baldwin Hills, said 
she, too, has reservations. Galanter's support is needed for city approval. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, I believe public streets should be public," Galanter said. "We are 
concerned about security, but this is an open city. It shouldn't be a city of 
locked gates and walls." 
</P>
<P>
If a community is going to consider taking public streets out of use, Galanter 
said, "it should also assume the responsibility for maintenance and other 
services." 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Brewer, assistant chief of the Los Angeles Police Department who lives in 
Baldwin Hills Estates, also questioned the plan. "I support their efforts, but 
something like that will not be done over night," he said. "It going to take a 
lot of working out to do. There are big problems: It involves closing streets 
off; deliveries have to be made, and the cost would require continued funding." 
</P>
<P>
Gardner, a real estate agent who is running for county assessor in the June 5 
election, said he became convinced that the community needed gates two years 
ago when he was startled out of his sleep one morning by vandals who threw a 
rock through his picture window. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood had enjoyed relative obscurity prior to the fire, but in 1963, 
it captured the spotlight when the Baldwin Hills Reservoir broke, sending 292 
million gallons of water into the neighborhood west of where the fire later 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Few outsiders ventured into the hilly community east of La Brea Avenue, south 
of the Santa Monica Freeway where the homes have striking panoramic views of 
the Los Angeles basin, stretching from the high-rises of Century City to the 
Los Angeles Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
It was a favored spot for photographers who would stream into the Baldwin Hills 
on especially clear days to capture that spectacular picture of the downtown 
Los Angeles skyline with snowcapped mountains in the background. 
</P>
<P>
Since the fire, Baldwin Hills has changed. The rebuilt homes now sell for well 
over $600,000. Spanish tile roofs have replaced the wood shingles that proved 
so dangerous in the fire. Baldwin Hills Estates and nearby Baldwin Vista, View 
Park and Leimert Park are part of a expansive upper-middle-class black enclave, 
which in recent years has been the scene of numerous receptions for politicians 
seeking campaign contributions from wealthy black donors: Jesse Jackson, New 
York Mayor David Dinkins and others have held receptions there. 
</P>
<P>
"My impression is more and more politicians are taking the community 
seriously," Galanter said. "The fact that it is becoming a fairly routine 
stopover for politicians is a healthy sign that the political community 
recognizes the importance of the people and the money that is in the area." 
</P>
<P>
But then there are those like Geraldine White who moved into the Baldwin Hills 
in 1968 when few outsiders ventured into the community, and all of the 
neighbors looked out for each other. 
</P>
<P>
"Those were the good days, but those days are gone now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
White, a supporter of the gates, says she hopes they will bring back a little 
of the security and privacy Baldwin Hills enjoyed in the past.

GATEWAY PLAN SAILS THROUGH COMMISSION; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: SUPPORTERS SAY RESIDENTIAL PROJECT IS A BIG IMPROVEMENT OVER A 
MASSIVE SHOPPING CENTER AND OFFICE COMPLEX ONCE PLANNED FOR THE SITE NEAR 
MARINA DEL REY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
With unusual speed and harmony, the massive $400-million Channel Gateway 
residential and office complex near Marina del Rey moved one big step toward 
construction last week. 
</P>
<P>
The high-rise project won the unanimous blessing of the Los Angeles Planning 
Commission on Thursday after Venice community leaders and representatives of 
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter joined in a chorus of support for 
the 16-acre development. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the City Council overturns the commission action -- which is not 
considered likely -- developer Jerome Snyder and associates will be able to 
build 512 condominium units in two 16-story towers, 544 apartments in 
four-story buildings, a 300,000-square-foot office building, and parking for 
more than 3,460 cars on the Lincoln Boulevard property. 
</P>
<P>
The lone voice of opposition to the project came from Culver City, which 
recently sparked the ire of Los Angeles officials by approving the Marina Place 
shopping center, three blocks from Channel Gateway. Threatened with a lawsuit 
by Los Angeles over the shopping mall, Culver City officials have sought to 
retaliate by opposing Channel Gateway. 
</P>
<P>
Venice attorney Debra Bowen praised Channel Gateway as a major improvement over 
a massive shopping center and office complex once planned for the triangular 
site on the edge of Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder bought the Channel Gateway property for $45 million last year from a 
partnership headed by state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana). The Robbins group 
had planned to build a massive shopping and commercial center called Admiralty 
Place but abandoned the plans two years ago when Culver City approved initial 
zoning for Marina Place. Channel Gateway's supporters said Snyder's residential 
project would generate significantly less traffic than a shopping center, 
provide affordable housing, and have far less impact on the nearby Oxford 
Triangle neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter, who was ill and did not attend Thursday's Planning Commission 
meeting, in an interview praised Channel Gateway as "an enormous improvement 
over what was contemplated before." 
</P>
<P>
Galanter attributed the Venice community's good will toward Channel Gateway to 
Snyder's efforts to work with the residents, who traditionally have opposed 
major developments. She said Snyder took the time to "come up with a project 
that meets community needs." 
</P>
<P>
He also took the time to work closely with Galanter, who was elected to the 
council in 1987 after tapping anti-development sentiment in her Westside 
council district. 
</P>
<P>
Even before Snyder and his partners purchased the property, he met with 
Galanter to discuss what it would take to win approval for the development. "I 
told the councilwoman I didn't want to get into a major fight," Snyder said in 
an interview last month. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter advised him to consult with community groups, provide more affordable 
housing and reduce the office space to cut down on traffic in the heavily 
congested Lincoln corridor. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder heeded the advice. 
</P>
<P>
He agreed that 20% of Channel Gateway's apartments will be affordable to low- 
and moderate-income households for 40 years. He pledged to establish a 
$1.25-million trust fund controlled by Galanter for housing and community 
improvement projects. And he promised that office parking will be made 
available to beach-goers on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
"When the property was brought to us," Snyder said, "it was going to be a 
shopping center." After he agreed to build a largely residential project with 
some affordable units, Snyder said the community "pretty much saw us as a white 
knight." 
</P>
<P>
The only bumps in an otherwise smooth road to Planning Commission approval came 
when commissioners voted to require Snyder to establish an effective program of 
car-pooling and transit use by office workers. Only after the program is shown 
to be successful will he be allowed to rent the final 15% of the planned office 
space. The commission also voted to limit the amount of restaurant space. 
</P>
<P>
The city Planning Department had recommended reducing the size of the office 
building by 15% to ease the office tower's impact on Lincoln Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
But Snyder and Galanter opposed the recommendation, and it was rejected. So was 
a recommendation that the number of affordable apartment units be increased. 
</P>
<P>
An environmental impact report on Channel Gateway predicted that the project 
would generate 8,500 daily vehicle trips, but that the added traffic could be 
offset by computer-controlled traffic signals and the widening of Lincoln 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental report identified more than 80 developments within a 2.5-mile 
radius of Channel Gateway, including the Marina Place mall, the massive Playa 
Vista project between Marina del Rey and the Westchester Bluffs, and a major 
business center on the north side of Los Angeles International Airport. The 
report predicts gridlock on the area's road system if the massive amount of 
proposed development is actually built. 
</P>
<P>
Channel Gateway is the latest in a series of large-scale projects by Snyder. He 
is building the $400-million Water Garden office project in Santa Monica. He 
has developed the $250-million Wilshire Courtyard office complex near the Los 
Angeles County Art Museum, and he converted the high-rise Marina City Club in 
Marina del Rey from apartments to condominiums.

VENICE: HEATED DEBATE OVER HOW TO FIX CRUMBLING CANAL WALLS HAS GONE ON FOR TWO 
YEARS. BUT THERE'S HOPE ON THE HORIZON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Homes on the banks of the Venice Canals are fetching prices in the $750,000 
range, but the quaint waterways that provide the area's charm continue to be 
"fixer-uppers." 
</P>
<P>
As cottages that once lined the banks are transformed into fancy remodels, the 
crumbling walls of the canals seem all the more forlorn as they wait for their 
own face-lift. And wait. And wait. 
</P>
<P>
Though long in the works, rehabilitating the canals has been stymied by a 
variety of disputes, ranging from environmental concerns to financial matters. 
</P>
<P>
There are six waterways remaining in what was once a system of canals 
envisioned by Venice founder Abbot Kinney, though these were dredged by another 
developer. One resident described the canal area, between Washington Boulevard 
and Venice Boulevard, east of Pacific Avenue, as an urban oasis, albeit one in 
which the waters have grown murky and the banks are disintegrating. 
</P>
<P>
For almost 25 years, city plans to restore the canals have been repeatedly 
drawn up and then shot down. 
</P>
<P>
The latest delays in the rebuilding project involve an acrimonious two-year 
debate between property owners and Venice-area Councilwoman Ruth Galanter over 
what type of concrete blocks should be used to rehabilitate the canals -- a 
battle between brands known as Loffelstein and Armorflex. And although that may 
sound like nothing more than a tongue twister to an outsider, to a majority of 
canal property owners, it means beauty versus the beast. It means war. 
</P>
<P>
Hostilities between the councilwoman and the Venice Canals Assn. are set out in 
an exchange of sharply worded correspondence with each other and with other 
residents of the canal community. 
</P>
<P>
The association, which claims to represent 200 property owners (there are 350 
properties in all) have accused Galanter of taking an Armorflex or 
nothing-at-all stance. The association strongly opposed the use of the 
Armorflex blocks for aesthetic reasons. And according to their poll, about 70% 
of property owners along the canal oppose the Armorflex plan. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter has said the choice of blocks is not a beauty contest. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, Ms. Galanter doesn't face the specter of waking up every morning to 
the cinder-block horror of Armorflex," fumed a letter to canal property owners 
from the association after a rancorous public meeting late last year. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter has fired her own written salvos, dismissing the group's aspersions on 
her as "hogwash, pure and simple." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Galanter insisted that she has not cast her lot with 
Armorflex. "I have no brand loyalty whatsoever," she said. "My job is to 
represent my constituents and to uphold the laws . . . and that's what I'm 
trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the harsh words, there appears to be on the horizon a perestroika by 
the Pacific. Canal association leader Mark Galanty, a major critic, now talks 
of a "a new beginning with Galanter," a shift in the relationship that 
apparently began when a consultant was hired by the property owners to 
intercede at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter, too, acknowledges a thaw in the feud, which she attributes in part to 
new property owners in the area who have taken a more conciliatory tone with 
her by asking for help, which she said she was all too happy to give. 
</P>
<P>
Some of them even came to her fund-raiser, Galanter said, though she, too, 
credits the consultant with convincing hard-line canal property owners that she 
was not to blame for derailed plans for the canals that were one step from 
fruition when she took office. 
</P>
<P>
A large part of the neighborhood's unhappiness with Galanter can be traced to 
what they perceive as her role in the cancellation of one canal rehabilitation 
plan that had the backing of her predecessor, Pat Russell. After many earlier 
battles on if and how the canals should be refurbished, property owners had 
voted for an assessment district in which they would be charged for repairs to 
the canals. 
</P>
<P>
The city had signed off on a plan for vertical concrete walls, and the matter 
was on the agenda for the Coastal Commission, when it was suddenly discovered 
that the canals were subject to environmental protection as a wetlands area, 
even though they are made by humans. 
</P>
<P>
That, Galanter explained, meant a vertical bank was unacceptable because there 
was no way that protected organisms could cling to it and the Coastal 
Commission staff had recommended against it. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter said canal property owners wanted her to use political muscle to push 
the project through, but she declined, preferring to withdraw the city's 
application and come up with a plan that was environmentally sound. 
</P>
<P>
This is where Armorflex came on the scene, after it was suggested by the 
Coastal Conservancy, to whom Galanter had turned for help. Armorflex is a 
blanket of interlocking concrete blocks tied together by cables. Parts of the 
blocks would be hollowed out to allow for native plants and organisms to grow. 
</P>
<P>
A test site was launched to see if a planting of pickle weed and salt grass 
would succeed. The first planting didn't take. The second was eaten by the 
canal ducks (the bird most people associate with the area is considered 
domesticated and not protected). 
</P>
<P>
Finally, wire was placed over the blocks to protect the tender new shoots, and 
Galanter planning deputy Jim Bickhart was spotted by residents wielding a 
garden hose in an attempt to get things moving. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, canal association leader Henry Colman reports, the anti-Armorflex 
faction was accused of sabotaging the pickle weed by drenching it with a toxic 
substance in the dead of night. The charge proved groundless, Colman said. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter, meanwhile, was accused in a letter from an association representative 
of caring more about pickle weed and salt grass than about her constituents. 
</P>
<P>
As the debate rage, Armorflex became the look the neighbors loved to hate. They 
disliked it enough to shop for a substitute -- Loffelstein or Loffel Block. 
Loffelstein is a series of log-like concrete planters that weigh more than 100 
pounds each. The planters are stacked on top of each other to form a retaining 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
A city study has found Loffelstein to be a close second to Armorflex in safety 
tests, with no substantial differences found. However, Galanter said, Armorflex 
appears to be easier to repair. In a press release issued last fall, Galanter 
pronounced Armorflex as "safer and less expensive than other materials and will 
do the best job of protecting the environment." 
</P>
<P>
But now, she is assisting the Venice Canals Assn. in getting the approval of 
the Coastal Commission for a Loffelstein test site, to see if it passes muster 
with the pickle weed and salt grass seeds. The test, if approved, is expected 
to take up to another 18 months.

REDEVELOPMENT PLAN MAY AID SOCIAL SERVICES; 
</P>
<P>
HOLLYWOOD: THE PROPOSAL CALLS FOR SETTING ASIDE 10% OF THE $900 MILLION 
GENERATED IN REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A plan to earmark for social service programs 10% of the $900 million that is 
to be spent on the massive Hollywood redevelopment project is likely to be 
approved by the city Community Redevelopment Agency and signed into law, 
redevelopment officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said the plan is the first of its kind in Los Angeles, and 
perhaps the nation, in which social reform programs are directly linked to a 
redevelopment effort. 
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, as much as $90 million would be spent over the next 30 
years on day-care facilities, medical services, shelter programs for the 
homeless and runaways, educational and job training facilities and counseling 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was approved April 6 by the Hollywood Community Advisory Council, and 
is now before the CRA board of directors, which is overseeing the effort to 
revitalize a 1.7-acre swath of central Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a good principle and is consistent with what the agency is doing now," 
said Carlyle Hall, one of seven CRA board directors and chairman of the CRA 
board's housing and social needs committee. "I think the 10% should be a floor, 
and not a ceiling, for spending on social needs." 
</P>
<P>
Other CRA officials and members of the community advisory group also hailed the 
plan and predicted that it would be approved. Hall said the CRA board would 
start reviewing the proposal within several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is very likely (the board) will adopt it," said Lester Burg, 
assistant project manager of the CRA's Hollywood Redevelopment Project. And 
project manager Cooke Sunoo said that although the project has been tied up in 
court, the agency has budgeted $350,000 for social-needs programs for the 
fiscal year that starts July 1. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood project, like most redevelopment efforts, is expected to be 
self-financing in the long run. Initial phases of the project are built with 
funds borrowed against future tax revenue. If successful, the initial phase of 
redevelopment then generates enough additional property tax revenue to pay for 
the rest of the project. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, 20% of the added tax revenue generated by redevelopment 
projects must be set aside to create affordable housing. The new plan goes 
further, setting aside an additional 10% for other social needs -- a first for 
the CRA, Sunoo said. 
</P>
<P>
The community advisory council, which sought input from CRA staff members 
before approving the plan, determined most of its priorities from a study of 
social needs in Hollywood that was conducted by an outside consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
HCAC Chairwoman Torie Osborn said she expects little opposition from the CRA 
board. She noted that the initial idea for setting aside the 10% came from City 
Councilman Michael Woo, who represents the area. That idea was incorporated 
into the redevelopment document approved by the City Council in May, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing like this plan, to my knowledge, anywhere else in the 
country," Osborn said. "It is a visionary document." 
</P>
<P>
What is at stake, and now subject to approval, is exactly how the money will be 
spent. 
</P>
<P>
The plan does not allocate fixed percentages of funds for specific purposes. 
Instead, it is flexible by design. The plan is for the CRA to work closely with 
the citizen's advisory council and private groups in determining how the money 
will be spent, Osborn said. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents have criticized the plan as being unrealistic. Among the critics 
are some members of an elected advisory group that Woo replaced last year as 
the official advisory panel to the CRA in favor of the Hollywood Community 
Advisory Council. 
</P>
<P>
At issue, opponents said, is the wording of the Hollywood Redevelopment Plan, 
which says the agency "shall expend or cause to be expended an amount equal to 
10% of the tax increment available to the agency . . . to address the social 
needs of the community." 
</P>
<P>
"Where is the 10% guaranteed?" asked community activist Norton Halper. "Not 
only is it not in the plan, it does not exist." 
</P>
<P>
Halper said he favors spending on social needs, but he warned that the CRA is 
"deceiving the community and the social needs groups that think they are going 
to get a lot of money to put forth their programs, when the money will not be 
there." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a deceptive hoax," said Halper. He said as much as 70% of the $1 billion 
ultimately projected for redevelopment would be used to finance the debts the 
CRA will incur by borrowing money up front for projects. 
</P>
<P>
Halper is a member of the Project Area Committee, the group that was replaced 
by the HCAC. Though stripped of its official status, the committee still meets 
once a month. 
</P>
<P>
Woo said the social programs will not have to wait for the redevelopment 
project to get under way before the money starts flowing. The initial 
borrowing, he said, will pay not just for construction, but for some of the 
social programs too. 
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, it may be many years before these needs are served," Woo said. "We 
have got to start generating some money now." 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Davis, chairwoman of the HCAC's Housing and Social Needs Committee, 
acknowledged that such debts would be incurred. "But I don't think they would 
be significant enough to dilute the purpose" of the plan to help the community, 
she said.

ROSES, LEMON AWARDS GO TO DOWNTOWN PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The First Interstate World Center, the Checkers Hotel and the Russ Hotel, a 
single-room occupancy hotel in Skid Row, have been awarded Roses by the 
Downtown Breakfast Club in its annual Roses and Lemons competition. 
</P>
<P>
This year's Lemon -- only one was chosen -- is Pershing Square, according to 
Fred Merritt, club chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-acre park bounded by 5th, 6th and Hill and Olive streets, was singled out 
"for being neglected for too long . . . it's a desert in the middle of downtown 
and has been since I was in the service in World War II," Merritt said. 
</P>
<P>
The three buildings are among six Roses selected by the group of 28 business 
leaders concerned with aesthetics and real estate development in downtown Los 
Angeles. The awards were made Thursday at a luncheon at the Biltmore Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate World Center, 633 W. 5th St., won in the new construction 
category; the Checkers Hotel, 535 S. Grand Ave., won in the renovation 
category, and the Russ Hotel, 521 S. San Julian St., won in the downtown 
housing category. 
</P>
<P>
Roses also were presented to The Metropolitan, an apartment building at 950 S. 
Flower St., in the downtown housing category for a tie with the Russ Hotel; to 
the Inner City Arts Center, at 1202 E. Olympic Blvd., in the civic/private 
commitment category, and to Downtown Dollar Days in the good ideas category.

SAM HALL KAPLAN: REQUIEM FOR A CLAREMONT NEIGHBORHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sam Hall Kaplan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many of the tree-shaded California bungalows and inventive block houses that 
edged 6th Street and upper Mills and Brooks avenues in the Arbol Verde district 
of Claremont are gone now, replaced by weed-covered lots or raw asphalt for 
parking. 
</P>
<P>
Gone also is the neighborly spirit, sense of place and history that once 
distinguished the modest six-block enclave as an evocative vestige of this 
college town's post-graduate bohemian community and barrio. For years, because 
of restrictive covenants elsewhere, Arbol Verde was one of the few places 
Latinos could settle. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Arbol Verde (Spanish for green tree) was once known simply as "the 
barrio" and spilled over into the bordering cities of Montclair and Upland. 
</P>
<P>
But a road-widening program 20 years ago, carried out in part to serve the six 
Claremont colleges, destroyed dozens of homes, the neighborhood's only church 
and social center, split the community and scattered many families. 
</P>
<P>
But doing more damage to the neighborhood fabric over the last two decades has 
been a questionable expansion program pursued with a restive persistence by 
neighboring Claremont McKenna College (CMC). 
</P>
<P>
Some long-term homeowners persevere. But most of the area's 90 or so houses 
have been purchased over the years by the college. More than a dozen of the 
houses, including some of distinct historic interest, have been demolished. 
Others have been stripped of detail and painted a bland institutional beige, 
and what shabby landscaping has been done is fenced by unappealing chain link. 
A disturbing quiet prevails. 
</P>
<P>
And all this in accordance with a zoning ordinance approved last year by the 
City Council, despite objections by the city Planning Department staff, the 
city Planning Commission, and an independent environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
The report stated that the zoning plan championed by the college would displace 
half the neighborhood, compromise the integrity of the remainder and, in 
effect, destroy the area's cultural and architectural significance. 
</P>
<P>
The report was brushed aside by a council resolution of "overriding concern." 
</P>
<P>
"It was an example not just of bad planning, but also of bad government," 
observed Jenniffer Jaffe, a professional planner who, as head of Arbol Verde 
Neighborhood United, had with others protested the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The council's decision was, not coincidentally, reflective of a special, 
questionable relationship between the city and the colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath its academic patina, Claremont is a very company town, with many 
officials affiliated in various ways with the colleges and beholden to them. 
Meanwhile, after years of a protracted, bitter battle by residents here to 
preserve the neighborhood from encroachment by CMC, it appears the institution 
has prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
Although CMC said it wanted to improve the neighborhood while considering vague 
plans for new athletic fields in the distant future, the reality beyond the 
public relations rhetoric is that through arbitrary demolitions, neglect and 
evictions it destabilized Arbol Verde. 
</P>
<P>
"They just said one thing, smiled, and did another, beating everyone down while 
the city turned its cheek," said Reatha Reedus, who has lived in Arbol Verde 
for 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
Reedus was one of nine long-term activist tenants recently served eviction 
notices from CMC. They have until the end of June to move. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Reedus, Jaffe and others had organized residents to protest the 
encroachment, to appeal various attempts by CMC to compromise the area's 
residential zoning, to decry the effects of spot demolitions, and with the help 
of volunteer professionals, propose alternative plans to accommodate the 
college's perceived needs without rending the area. 
</P>
<P>
They have repeatedly contended that the school, with about 800 students, could 
easily meet their needs on its existing campus, or by imaginatively sharing 
facilities with the five other Claremont colleges, or by expanding on vacant 
land it owns elsewhere, but not in a vital, historic neighborhood of affordable 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
There also was the charge that the college was "block busting" the 
neighborhood: buying up properties, allowing them to deteriorate, evicting 
tenants and generally depressing values to allow them to purchase more property 
there more cheaply. 
</P>
<P>
The college has repeatedly denied the charges. It contends that it only has 
been acting as "as a very responsible landowner who has invested millions of 
dollars into the improvement of the neighborhood," and who hopes someday to use 
it for expansion. 
</P>
<P>
It was this conflict between college and community set in an architecturally 
interesting neighborhood with an engaging multicultural legacy that attracted 
my attention eight years ago to do a story there. 
</P>
<P>
The specific battle then centered on the planning designation for the area, 
whether it should be "residential," as preferred by the residents, instead of 
the institutional "semi-public" the college sought. If zoned residential, it 
was thought that the city would be obligated by its general plan to preserve 
the neighborhood's physical and social character and conserve the existing 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
The residential designation was subsequently upheld and the neighborhood 
exacted a promise by CMC to back off its expansion policy, better maintain its 
properties and generally act to stabilize the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Long ago, I learned not to rely on what most institutions and people say, 
rather on what they do, and so I made a point over the years to drop by and 
check up on the state of Arbol Verde. What I have witnessed is a once viable 
neighborhood's spirit and landscape being nibbled away. 
</P>
<P>
The emerging portrait does not speak well for the city's resolve or CMC's 
promises. 
</P>
<P>
"If Arbol Verde was at 10th and Indian Hill (in the tonier historic area of 
Claremont), this devastation wouldn't have been allowed," Reedus said. Ever the 
optimist, Jaffe interjected wistfully that perhaps it still can be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
People in Claremont talk of the battle between CMC and Arbol Verde having 
gotten too personal; of the college winning and some residents losing. 
</P>
<P>
But in this battle that saw a modest historic neighborhood repeatedly 
compromised by a faulty planning process, an insensitive local institution and 
a irresolute City Council there really are no winners, only losers.

REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: SELL REPLACEMENT HOME TOO SOON AND YOU RISK LOSING TAX 
DEFERRAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS, Robert J. Bruss is a San Francisco-area lawyer, author and 
real estate broker. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: We sold our home about a year ago and bought a more expensive home to 
avoid having to pay tax on our sale profit. But a month ago, my wife had twins 
and we need to buy a larger home quickly. However, our tax man says if we sell 
our home now we will have to pay tax on our deferred profit, since we owned our 
home less than 24 months. If this is true, is there any way to get around this 
tax rule? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Yes. But first let's back up. When you sold your first home you 
deferred the profit tax by purchasing a replacement principal residence of 
equal or greater cost within 24 months before or after the sale. This is the 
"roll-over residence replacement rule" of Internal Revenue Code 1034. 
</P>
<P>
However, this rule can be used only once every 24 months. The one exception 
allows a tax deferral on a sale in less than 24 months if the sale is due to a 
job location change, which qualifies for the moving expense tax deduction (new 
job must be at least 35 miles further away from old home than was the old job). 
But I'll presume you do not qualify for the moving expense deduction since you 
didn't mention any job location change. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid having to pay tax, just wait to sell your current home until you have 
owned it at least 24 months. However, your letter says you need a larger home 
immediately. One solution is to lease your current home to a tenant, perhaps 
with an option to buy after your 24 months expires, and either buy or lease a 
larger home, so you can move now. Several Tax Court decisions say a temporary 
rental of your old home, while it is available for sale, will not convert it 
into rental property and you will not lose the tax deferral of IRC 1034. Please 
consult your tax adviser for full details. 
</P>

Faxed Counteroffer May Not Be Binding 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am selling a large commercial building. It is listed with a fine real 
estate broker. He found a buyer from Hong Kong who inspected the building, went 
back to Hong Kong and transmitted his purchase offer bid via Federal Express. I 
counteroffered and sent the counteroffer back via Federal Express. Then the 
buyer sent his acceptance of my counteroffer via fax. It clearly shows his 
signature and the date. 
</P>
<P>
That was about two months ago. Recently he wrote that he is unable to complete 
the purchase because of financial reverses. I don't think I can get a 
replacement offer that is as good as this buyer's offer. He has put up only a 
$20,000 deposit. Do you think we have a valid contract since the only copy I 
have was sent via fax? 
</P>
<P>
A: I don't know if you have a legally enforceable contract. Some attorneys 
think fax acceptances are valid, but I am not aware of any appellate court 
decision upholding contracts that were accepted via fax. Most attorneys 
recommend that fax acceptances be followed up by obtaining the original copy of 
the document, so it can be enforced in court if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Considering that your Hong Kong buyer may not be willing to part with the 
original copy of the accepted counteroffer, you may have a difficult situation 
if you try to sue that buyer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How to Earn Profits in a 'Flat' Market 
</P>
<P>
Q: The real estate market in our area seems to be "flat." For the long term, I 
think houses will continue to be good investments, but I am reluctant to buy 
now because I don't see much appreciation in our town. Is there any way to earn 
profits in a flat real estate market? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. I recommend buying houses that need fix-up work. My goal is to increase 
the market value by at least $2 for each $1 spent on improvements. Whether a 
local real estate market is stagnant or appreciating, buying fix-up property 
and immediately upgrading it is usually the best way to profit in real estate. 
</P>
<P>
The most profitable improvement is paint. Other profitable improvements include 
cleaning, repairing, new carpets and new landscaping. But avoid unprofitable 
improvements such as new roof, new plumbing, new wiring and other necessary 
structural work that doesn't increase the home's market value by more than its 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It Doesn't Pay to Buy Retirement Home Early 
</P>
<P>
Q: My husband and I are thinking of buying a lot where we will build our 
retirement home in Florida. But he thinks we should wait, because he is about 
six years away from retirement. We have been vacationing in the same area for 
the last few years and enjoy it very much every winter. I think we should buy a 
lot now, before prices go higher, don't you? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. It usually is not wise to buy real estate you cannot use within six 
months after purchase. I hate to be negative, but too many things can happen to 
change your plans before retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Death, disability, change of plans and many other unexpected circumstances can 
arise. If you buy that lot on which you plan to build a retirement home now it 
may be difficult to sell for as much as you paid. Or you may find it is just as 
economical to buy a nearby existing home for less than it will cost to buy a 
vacant lot and build a house on it in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Real Estate License Can Be a Disadvantage 
</P>
<P>
Q: I own my home plus a rental house, which I recently fixed up and plan to 
sell at a considerable profit. Do you think I should study to get a real estate 
sales license, so I can get the inside track on the new listings when they 
first come on the market? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. A real estate sales license can be a major handicap to a real estate 
investor. Many property sellers and buyers are afraid of real estate licensees 
and they are extremely cautious when dealing with them. 
</P>
<P>
I find that when I disclose my broker's license to buyers and sellers they 
become extremely cautious. Unless you plan to sell real estate to earn sales 
commissions on your transactions I do not recommend you obtain a realty sales 
license. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Title Insurance Is Excellent Protection 
</P>
<P>
Q: In a few months I will be buying my sister's house. She owns it free and 
clear. Her plan is to give me a 100% mortgage (nothing down) so she can live 
off the interest income. It will give my family and me a place to live and 
provide good income for my sister. Do you think I should buy title insurance on 
this family sale? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, always obtain an owner's title insurance policy, especially when buying 
real estate from relatives. It is cheap peace of mind protection. The insurance 
protects you as long as you own the property. It would be a shame to make all 
your mortgage payments, only to discover your sister didn't convey marketable 
title to you. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Don't Buy Land Not Used Within 6 Months 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am considering buying a vacant lot. How can I avoid a prescriptive 
easement, since I'll be away from this land until about 12 years from now, when 
I want to build a house on it? Also, what contingencies should I include in 
this offer? 
</P>
<P>
A: My advice is don't buy land unless you plan to use it within six months. Too 
many things can happen if you don't use it immediately. For example, you might 
be able to build a nice house on the lot today, but in the future the city 
might change the rules and either reduce the size of a home which can be built 
or require a larger minimum lot size for building a home. 
</P>
<P>
As for avoiding a neighbor acquiring a prescriptive easement or, worse yet, 
title by adverse possession, be sure to inspect the lot at least annually. If 
you discover anyone using the property without your permission, have them 
ejected so they don't acquire any rights in your property. 
</P>
<P>
I am not certain what you mean by contingencies to include in your purchase 
offer. If you need financing, be sure your offer is contingent on obtaining a 
specified mortgage. You also may want to include contingencies such as checking 
availability of utilities and making sure you can obtain a building permit 
under current circumstances. But there is no guarantee that you will be able to 
build on that lot in the future. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Every State Requires Real Estate Sales License 
</P>
<P>
Q: Please send me a list of the states that do not require licenses to sell 
real estate. I will be retiring in a few months and want to go into real 
estate, as I am sure I could earn big money selling homes. However, I am too 
old to study for an exam. 
</P>
<P>
A: Every state requires a written examination to obtain a real estate sales 
license. In addition, many states require completion of one or more basic real 
estate courses before taking the exam. To learn the specific real estate 
license requirements of the state where you want to sell real estate, please 
write to the Real Estate Commissioner at the state capitol. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remedies When Seller Changes Her Mind 
</P>
<P>
Q: We contracted to buy a beautiful old home. But about two weeks before the 
scheduled closing date, after we had arranged our new mortgage and were getting 
ready to move out of our old home, the seller notified her agent that she had 
decided not to sell after all. She changed her mind about moving and wants to 
stay in her present house. She is a sweet old lady, but we don't think she is 
being fair to us. The realty agent advises us to consult an attorney. What 
should we do? 
</P>
<P>
A: Your seller seems to have a bad case of seller's remorse disease. As a 
buyer, your legal remedies are to bring a specific performance lawsuit to force 
the seller to honor the sales contract and deliver the deed as agreed, sue the 
seller for damages (this can be hard to prove) or terminate the contract and 
get your earnest money deposit refunded. Please consult your attorney for more 
information. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deferral Only Works With Replacement 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are in the process of selling our home. The profit will be about $75,000 
net. I realize that we can defer our profit tax by buying another home of equal 
or greater value. But we want to move into a rental house we bought about six 
years ago. It cost us about $20,000 more than we expect our old home to sell 
for. Will this qualify for tax deferral? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. The "roll-over residence replacement rule" of Internal Revenue Code 1034 
says you can defer your profit tax when selling your principal residence and 
buying a replacement principal residence of equal or greater cost within 24 
months before or after the sale. Since your rental house was bought six years 
ago, it doesn't qualify.

PROS AND CONS OF BIWEEKLY LOANS

<P>
QUESTION: What do you think of biweekly mortgages? I ask because I am 
considering refinancing my home and a lender I talked with was pushing biweekly 
loans. As she explained them, they pay off in about 20 years. But I'm not sure 
I like the idea of having to make loan payments every two weeks and having them 
withdrawn automatically from my checking account. If these loans are such a 
good deal, why don't all lenders offer them? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Biweekly mortgages are good for lenders because they get their money 
back faster than with a traditional mortgage, which requires one payment each 
month. But most lenders don't offer biweekly because of the difficulty 
programming their computers for two collections every month. 
</P>
<P>
However, you can accomplish the same result by making the equivalent of 13 
instead of just 12 monthly payments each year. 
</P>
<P>
For example, suppose your monthly mortgage payment is $1,200. Just add $100 
extra to each monthly payment and you will be making the equivalent of 13 
payments each year. This should pay off your loan in 15 to 20 years, depending 
on the interest rate. 
</P>
<P>
Biweekly mortgages are popular with blue-collar workers who get paid every two 
weeks. The key is that the payment is withdrawn automatically from your 
checking or savings account. However, for most borrowers, there doesn't seem to 
be any great advantage to biweekly mortgages and it can be a bookkeeping 
problem to remember that the lender is going to deduct a loan payment from your 
checking account every two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
My suggestion is to take a 30-year mortgage with monthly, rather than biweekly 
payments. If you wish to have it paid off rapidly so you can save thousands of 
dollars in interest, just pay it off as if it were a 15-year mortgage. 
Depending on the loan amount and interest rate, your extra payment each month 
will typically be between $100 and $200. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Negative Amortization ARM Could Be Risky 
</P>
<P>
Q: My wife and I want to buy our first home. We found a wonderful real estate 
agent. The first thing he did was to get us to fill out a loan application, so 
he could get us prequalified for a mortgage. He tried a local S&amp;L, which 
advertised the best rates, but we discovered their borrowers must have good 
income and perfect credit. Although we have excellent credit, our income is not 
very high. 
</P>
<P>
Next, the realty agent took our application to an "easy lender" who, he said, 
rarely turns anyone down. But all they offered us was an adjustable-rate 
mortgage with negative amortization. That means our monthly payment will stay 
reasonable, but we are not happy about the possibility that we could wind up 
owing more on the mortgage than we borrowed. What do you think of negative 
amortization mortgages? 
</P>
<P>
A: As you probably already know, adjustable-rate mortgages shift the risk of 
rising interest rates from the lender to the borrower. To help minimize the 
possibility of rising payments, which the borrower cannot afford, some ARM 
lenders offer loans with negative amortization. This means the payment can't 
increase by more than a specified amount if interest rates go up, but the 
unpaid interest is added to your mortgage balance. 
</P>
<P>
This is all right if the home also increases in market value. But if it 
doesn't, you could find your equity being wiped out. However, if you only plan 
to stay in the home for a few years, then a negative amortization loan would be 
all right because there probably won't be much negative amortization interest 
added to your loan's principal balance in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
If you plan to keep the home more than a few years, my suggestion is to shop 
around among lenders on your own. Perhaps you will discover a better lender 
where you can qualify for a loan that doesn't have negative amortization. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Lender Transfer Loan Out of State? 
</P>
<P>
Q: About two years ago, we got our home loan from a local savings and loan. We 
have our checking and savings accounts with the same S&amp;L and it is very 
convenient for us. But last week we received a notice that our loan will now be 
serviced by an out-of-state lender we have never heard of. Both my husband and 
I get paid on the 15th of the month and we made our loan payments on the same 
day. Is there any way we can stop this? 
</P>
<P>
A: Welcome to the multibillion dollar world of loan servicing. You are the 
latest victim and there isn't much you can do. If it will make you feel any 
better, I have one mortgage that started out in California, moved to Texas, 
where it was transferred among several loan servicers, then it moved to 
Oklahoma and now it is in Toledo, Ohio, where the loan servicer is doing a 
terrible job. All during this time the loan has been owned by Fannie Mae, but 
the servicing keeps getting sold and transferred. The same thing is happening 
to your loan.

'URBANOPOLIS' FERVOR NOT UNIVERSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was shocked when I read Leon Whiteson's article on "Universal's 'Urbanopolis' 
" (April 15). It seemed to me that Whiteson failed to point out that there are 
many people who are not as enthusiastic about MCA's previous, current and 
proposed development as those whom he interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
The map for Universal City with Whiteson's article does not show that there is 
an established neighborhood of single-family residences west of Barham 
Boulevard and north of the Hollywood Freeway. This neighborhood, Hollywood 
Manor, is just east of Universal City's property line. 
</P>
<P>
MCA Development is now forced to contend with neighbors in Hollywood Manor who 
are concerned by MCA's present grading of a road and applications MCA has put 
forth that seek to alter a conditional use permit issued 10 years ago by the 
county to protect the homeowners interests and their properties. 
</P>
<P>
The "City Walk" project is directly linked with our concerns as MCA/Universal 
is faced with the problems of inadequate parking and its need for a new public 
access road that will bring their customers in and then send them out on their 
way onto the already heavily congested Hollywood Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
It is an altogether common occurrence to find the Hollywood Freeway at a 
virtual standstill as it winds through the Cahuenga Pass. The traffic situation 
is no better at Barham, since this throughway is being used for access into 
Burbank, North Hollywood and Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed developments will certainly have a detrimental effect on the 
traffic flow through these areas. If MCA/Universal is allowed to continue its 
avoidance of an environmental impact report, the present situation could reach 
gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
It will take much more than an MCA model of "Urbanopolis" to bring our 
community toward the state of being "not unhappy." It will also take a thorough 
legal and political investigation before we can join Jane Blumenfeld in calling 
the MCA project "pretty exciting."

GLOOM IN BURBANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a homeowner and proud resident of Burbank, I am compelled to write after 
reading Betsy Bates' article, "City Proud of Progress Shrugs Off Gag" (April 
1). 
</P>
<P>
I, too, am enamored with Burbank's small-town feeling, its efficient public 
services and its sense of community pride. 
</P>
<P>
These are the very same reasons why my family chose to make Burbank our home. 
</P>
<P>
However, I would like to point out that Bates failed to mention that Burbank 
Councilman Tom Flavin, who was featured in her article, is the subject of a 
current citywide, resident-initiated recall petition (along with Councilman 
Michael Hastings). Councilmen Flavin and Hastings have politically endorsed a 
multitude of massive commercial development projects that can threaten the very 
same qualities for which we all hold so dearly. 
</P>
<P>
If these projects are passed as proposed by the City Council, Burbank will no 
longer remind residents of . . . "little Midwestern towns." The plans call for 
towering office buildings throughout the city, many abutting residential 
neighborhoods; many of our lovely shopping streets will be widened and 
oxygen-giving, shade-bearing trees (some as old as 40 years) will be removed; 
extensive commuter traffic will cut through our residential neighborhoods, and 
Burbank's quality of life will vastly deteriorate.

LOBBY FOR WHOM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The idea that the National Assn. of Home Builders (NAHB) can represent 
homeowners' interests is absurd "Builders Forming Homeowners Lobbying Group" by 
Catherine Collins (April 8). Talk about the fox guarding the chicken coop. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, protecting the mortgage interest deduction and improving housing 
affordability are common causes for both parties. But builders would certainly 
be fools if they didn't champion them -- homes are their bread and butter. 
Homeowners, therefore, needn't worry that the building industry will suddenly 
stop lobbying for these items. 
</P>
<P>
NAHB spokesman Bannister says, "We both want the best-quality housing at the 
lowest price possible . . ." as if that exhausts the issues. But what about 
zoning, construction limitations, congestion, crime, environmental impact, 
neighborhood service, etc., issues on which builders and homeowners may see 
things quite differently? 
</P>
<P>
Whose side will the organization take when community agencies restrict 
development because of impending gridlock? Or when there's a conflict between a 
developer's rights and the well-being of the community? 
</P>
<P>
Our real concern should be what the NAHB will do with the power granted it by a 
membership of a quarter million. That kind of weight is important in Washington 
and, true needs of the membership aside, could buy NAHB lots of political clout 
potentially at conflict with the needs of the home-owning community at large. 
No wonder "Builder Jack Shine" (pictured with the article) is smiling.

'URBANOPOLIS' FERVOR NOT UNIVERSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re: "Universal's 'Urbanopolis,' " I especially appreciate that local residents 
were invited into the design process, that there will be housing planned 
specifically for people who will work in the complex (I hope it will be 
significantly affordable), and that the complex is pedestrian-oriented "with a 
lively and varied communal environment." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Whiteson's article leaves many critical issues unaddressed: 
Where's the green space (beyond the few peek-a-boo palm trees)? Where are the 
renewable energy systems? Solar or photovoltaic panels? Where are the pools of 
water in various stages of purification for reuse? Where are the roof gardens 
and parks on all that flat roof space? 
</P>
<P>
All future development in this city must address how we can build without 
diminishing the prospects of future generations. 
</P>
<P>
If we're installing so much pavement that the rainwater goes into sewers and 
into the ocean instead of percolating down to replenish the ground-water table, 
we're diminishing those prospects! Building in balance with nature is essential 
for our future as a city and our future as a species on the planet.

GARDENER'S CHECKLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week: 
</P>
<P>
* Deciduous flowering shrubs and trees can be pruned right after they finish 
blooming. 
</P>
<P>
* Start feeding camellias, azaleas and rhododendrons an acid fertilizer when 
they stop blooming. 
</P>
<P>
* Try morning glories, sweet peas, nasturtiums or black-eyed Susan vines to 
hide an unattractive fence, to provide shade or create privacy on your porch. 
</P>
<P>
* Plant cucumbers, squash, beans, sweet corn, tomatoes, peppers and egg plants 
now.

CREATE A BASIC WORKSHOP FOR HOME; 
</P>
<P>
DO-IT-YOURSELF: WORKBENCH IS THE HEART OF A FUNCTIONAL WORKSHOP. IF SPACE IS A 
PROBLEM, A FOLD-DOWN UNIT MAY BE A GOOD CHOICE TO BUILD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reader's Digest 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
If you dream of an efficient, functional place to work on projects and store 
tools, here are some hints to help you get started on your ideal home workshop. 
</P>
<P>
A workbench is the heart of a workshop. A sturdy 2-by-4 frame topped by a 
double layer of three-quarter-inch plywood will serve as an excellent, 
easy-to-make workbench. 
</P>
<P>
If a full-sized bench takes up more space than you have, you can build a 
fold-down unit. Use a solid-core door for the bench top; fasten it to a wall, 
using a piano hinge. Support the front edge with 2-by-4 legs attached with 
hinges and folding leg brackets that lock open. 
</P>
<P>
For most people, the correct height for a workbench is 34 to 36 inches. If you 
need a different height, choose one midway between your hips and your wrist 
when your arm is hanging straight down. 
</P>
<P>
Because concrete is hard on the feet and damages tools that are dropped 
accidentally, cushion the workshop floor with plywood or an old carpet. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some tips for expanding storage space: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A back-of-the-door tool rack is great for storing small tools and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 -- You can store tools on wall hooks or on a peg board. Paint the outline of 
each tool on the surface to remind you and others where to replace it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To make a handy rack for screwdrivers and other small tools, drill a series 
of one-half to 2-inch holes through a 1-by-3. Mount the rack on the wall with 
L-brackets. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Need a storage receptacle for sharp or pointed tools? Cut a block of 
plastic foam from the packing material in an appliance carton. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Use the unfinished stud spaces of your workshop walls. To make shelves, 
nail old boards horizontally between the studs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A good way to organize washers and nuts is to hang them according to size 
on large safety pins or on wire coat hangers whose necks have been untwisted. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jars with screw tops are ideal for storing small items such as nails, 
screws, nuts and bolts. You can double your shelf capacity by screwing some of 
the jar lids to the undersides of the shelves. Place a lock washer under the 
head of the screw so that the lid won't turn when you unscrew the jar. Or 
attach the lid with two screws. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If you need a rack to store abrasive sanding disks, cut off one-third to 
one-half of an aluminum pie plate and fasten it to the wall, bottom side out. 
</P>
<P>
Set your workshop up with safety precautions in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When working with any power tool -- large or small -- use only a 
heavy-duty, grounded (three-prong) extension cord that is 14-gauge or larger. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To keep power-tool cords out of the way as you work, hook the slack on a 
long spring screwed into the ceiling above your workbench. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Store discarded toxic chemicals such as solvents in a separate, sealed 
trash container. Ask your local carting company, recycling center or sanitation 
department about how to dispose of them properly. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Because linseed oil is prone to spontaneous combustion even in cold 
weather, quickly discard any rag used with linseed oil or with a product 
containing linseed oil. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If you have small children, store all tools in locked cabinets or drawers. 
As the children grow up, gradually introduce them to the safe use of hand 
tools, but continue to lock up power tools.

SCRAPE, SPACKLE, SAND BEFORE WALLPAPERING

<P>
Take care to invest in the care and cleaning of walls before redecorating them 
with new coverings. 
</P>
<P>
First, scrape away peeling paint and sand smooth. 
</P>
<P>
Then apply a spackling compound over scraped areas, cracks or nail holes. Prime 
all patched areas. 
</P>
<P>
Flat oil-base painted walls need only washing and light sanding after patched 
areas are primed. 
</P>
<P>
Walls painted with low-quality paint need a priming over the entire wall. 
</P>
<P>
Glossy painted surfaces are too slick to hold coverings. Dull them by sanding. 
Then, wash with an extra-strong trisodium phosphate solution or a soap and 
ammonia mix. Rinse thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
For papered walls, remove old wall coverings. Newer strippable coverings peel 
off readily, but one of these methods may be needed for older coverings: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Scrape paper from the wall with a scraper. Then, remove paste residue with 
steel wool and warm water. Rinse thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rent a steamer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sponge or spray on a remover sold at hardware stores, following label 
instructions. Repair and prepare stripped walls as for painted walls.

INTERIORS: GETTING STARTED IN THE FINE ART OF STENCILING; 
</P>
<P>
DECOR: PAINTING DESIGNS CAN ENHANCE THE LOOK OF EARLY AMERICAN PINE FURNITURE 
OR ADD INTEREST TO A ROOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. J. HAND, Los Angeles Times Syndicate. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Looking for an easy, effective way to set off a piece of Early American pine 
furniture? Or liven up a mundane wooden floor? Or add interest to the typical 
painted room? Stenciling may be what you're looking for. 
</P>
<P>
Stenciling is an art that requires almost no artistic skill. If you can cut out 
a simple pattern with a sharp knife and make little dabbing motions with a 
paint brush, you can decorate successfully with stencils. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the best way to get started in stenciling is to buy a copy of "Early 
American Cut and Use Stencils," by Joanne C. Day (published by Dover 
Publications, 180 Varick St., New York, N.Y. 10014). 
</P>
<P>
This book includes 54 full-sized stencils in a variety of Early American 
motifs, all printed on heavy oak tag. All you have to do to use them is cut out 
a page, soak it in a mixture of linseed oil and thinner, and let dry. Then you 
take a sharp razor knife and cut along the printed shapes and you are ready to 
start stenciling. 
</P>
<P>
This involves little more than taping the stencil in position on your work, and 
dabbing paint over it with a blunt stenciling brush as shown in the sketch. 
Day's book includes a basic set of instructions, but if you give stenciling a 
try and become interested, you might want to learn more about it. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, she has a more advanced book, "The Complete Book of 
Stencilcraft," published by Simon &amp; Schuster. Another book with good 
information is "Paint Magic," by Jocasta Innes (Pantheon Books). 
</P>
<P>
If you'd like to fool around with stenciling on your own, here's a quick review 
of how to get started: 
</P>
<P>
You can make a simple basic stencil out of a piece of cardboard. An ordinary 
file folder works well. If you can come up with your own design idea, fine. If 
not, you should be able to get ideas from magazines, catalogues and books. 
Simple Early American and Pennsylvania Dutch designs always work well. 
</P>
<P>
Once you have your design, draw it out on your piece of cardboard. Then mix up 
a small batch of boiled linseed oil and paint thinner or turpentine, mixed 
50/50. Soak this into both sides of the cardboard for several minutes. Then 
wipe off the excess and let dry for about half an hour. This treatment will 
give the cardboard extra body, make it easier to cut, and when fully dry, will 
protect the stencil from both latex and oil paints. 
</P>
<P>
If, after half an hour, the cardboard is still wet, wipe it off again. Then lay 
it out on a smooth board and cut along your lines with a razor-sharp knife. 
Then let the stencil dry overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Paints used for stenciling can be latex or oil, but in any case, should be 
fairly thick. Thin, runny paints will seep under your stencil. Subdued, earthy 
colors such as browns, greens, ochers and rusty reds usually look most 
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than buy cans of paint, it's often cheaper to mix your own, using 
artist's acrylic or oil paints. These come in tubes and can be thinned with 
water (for acrylics) or turpentine (for oils) to a consistency about like heavy 
cream. 
</P>
<P>
There are special brushes made for stenciling, but if you can't find one at 
your art store, buy a cheap round sash brush at your paint store and cut off 
the bristles to about half their original length to create a stubby, flat-nosed 
substitute. 
</P>
<P>
Put some of your paint in a saucer or other shallow container and tap the end 
of the brush into it a few times. Dab the end of the brush onto some newspapers 
a few times to get off the excess and you are ready to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
It's not a bad idea to practice a bit with your stencil on a scrap of wood. 
This will help you get the feel of how much to load the brush, and how to apply 
the paint. So place your stencil down on a scrap and give it a try. 
</P>
<P>
Apply the paint by tapping lightly with the tip of the brush. Don't try for a 
heavy coat. If the brush is too wet, paint will seep under the stencil and 
cause smears. If it's too dry or your paint is too thin, you won't get good 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Once you have your technique worked out, wipe the stencil clean with a soft rag 
or paper towel. Then tape it to your real work and go to it. After the paint 
has dried you might want to go over it lightly with very fine sandpaper to give 
it a worn look. If the stencil is in a high-wear situation, it's a good idea to 
protect it with a coat or two of varnish.

TIMELESSNESS OF TRADITIONAL U.S. FURNITURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's attic -- The Smithsonian Institution -- and antiques stores and 
museums around the world inspired many of the designs at the fall furniture 
market in High Point, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
At a difficult time for the furniture industry, when business is spotty and 
several of the country's top department stores are on the sale block, 
manufacturers chose to emphasize traditional pieces that bear a well-known 
designer's name or recall another era. 
</P>
<P>
The contemporary styles in wood are warm rather than stark, often embellished 
with inlays or a painted surface. In place of shiny chrome, softer bronze and 
pewter finishes characterize metal pieces. Rather than glass, natural and faux 
unpolished stone materials are used. 
</P>
<P>
Sofas and chairs are clearly made for lounging. Both contemporary and 
traditional upholstered pieces are overstuffed and oversized with sausage-like 
arms, and they are slathered with deep cushions and extra throw pillows. 
</P>
<P>
The American love affair with a romanticized representation of our past 
continues unabated. New American country pieces that borrow from the past but 
don't reproduce it were among the most popular at the market. 
</P>
<P>
Copies of styles from the last three centuries of English and American design 
are a close second. French themes and neoclassical styles such as Biedermeier 
are minor themes. 
</P>
<P>
Indicative of the pragmatic nature of design today, two of the major new 
furniture groups combine several English periods (Century and Drexel.) Another 
is "contemporary with many references to the past" in designer Charles 
Pfister's words (Baker). The Lexington group "combines French, English and 
Italian influences in every piece," according to designer Lynn Hollyn. 
</P>
<P>
Henredon copied about 35 antiques from the plantations for its licensed 
Historic Natchez (Miss.) Foundation Collection. This group, like Lynn Hollyn's, 
includes a variety of coordinating fabrics and accessories. 
</P>
<P>
The new furniture is, above all, designed to go with what most people already 
own. Manufacturers have finally learned that the majority of consumers buy 
furniture a piece at a time. So there's less stress on large "suites" meant to 
furnish an entire room. 
</P>
<P>
A new cedar chest by Lane is a good example of this trend. The chest, decorated 
with a silk-screen version of a mid-19th-Century primitive painting, is part of 
the 200-piece America Collection licensed by the Museum of American Folk Art. 
Yet it is interesting enough to stand on its own. 
</P>
<P>
Another example is the Turkish chair introduced by Century. The opulently 
upholstered overstuffed chair, a close copy of the original owned by the 
Smithsonian, looks as if it came from a banker's parlor. It's also an example 
of the trend toward reproducing 19th-Century rather than 18th-Century antiques. 
</P>
<P>
Those not up to buying even one new piece can update a room with accents in 
faux leopard skin. Mark Hampton selected leopard for an entire room display of 
his collection for Hickory Chair Co. to which several new pieces were added. 
But the fabric showed up as an accent in pillows or chair covers in virtually 
every stylish showroom from Drexel to Thayer Coggin. An oversize, fully 
upholstered ottoman was another common accent piece. 
</P>
<P>
Upholstery fabrics moved in two main color directions: Jewel-like emerald, 
brilliant blue, red and eggplant, and clear bright florals in sunny yellow and 
blue or other flower-like colors used with white.

DESIGN SOLUTIONS: CHOOSING COLORS THAT WILL STAY 'IN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Designers and International Society of Interior Designers.

QUESTION: We're redecorating and want a new color scheme. I know that mauve was 
"in" -- my mother had avocado and gold. I don't want my home to look dated. How 
does an interior designer choose colors to avoid this? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: The complex influences that affect color palettes range from the 
political climate to the predominate color selections on a top-rated television 
series (such as "Miami Vice" pink). 
</P>
<P>
During the 1960s, we experienced the shock of "Aquarius," Andy Warhol and Peter 
Max art, miniskirts, civil rights marches, neon and psychedelic. The natural 
color choices for this era were bright, bold orange, yellow, red, chartreuse 
and hot pink. The style was Danish Modern, bean-bag chairs and beaded room 
dividers. 
</P>
<P>
The 1970s brought Kent State, oil embargoes, Watergate, maxi- skirts, and a 
rise in divorce. So our psyches were depressed and we yearned for security. 
Naturally, our color choices became heavy and oppressed (no longer the pure 
brights of the '60s). The color palette was brown, avocado green, gold and a 
burnt, rusty orange. Our yearning for security made us select country or Early 
American furniture. 
</P>
<P>
So how can you select colors and styles that aren't dated? By having an 
awareness of everything that's going on around you. 
</P>
<P>
Renewed space exploration could bring a rise in popularity of sky blues or 
patriotic colors. The Olympics in Barcelona may renew our interest in Spanish 
design and historical colors. 
</P>
<P>
In general, consider the size of your room, its use and the mood you want to 
create. Warm reds and yellows may seem cheery to some, but they can cause a 
room to feel smaller or to radiate with tension. Cool blues or greens are 
calming (they actually slow down the heart beat), and help "expand" a room's 
size. Black can be dramatic or mournfully depressing.

Converting City Furniture to Country 
</P>
<P>
Q: We've recently moved to the country and need to have our formal furnishings 
work for us in this new setting. What can we do? 
</P>
<P>
A: Assuming that you want a "country" look for your new home, I'd recommend 
that you consider refinishing some of your pieces with a "pickled" or 
"whitewash" look. Whitewash does not necessarily mean white in color -- it's a 
wash put on wood that comes in a variety of colored shades. 
</P>
<P>
Painted furniture also works well in a country setting. Depending on the type 
of furnishings you have, you might consider having your kitchen or den 
furniture painted and stenciled. 
</P>
<P>
Your upholstered pieces pose no problem as they can be recovered in chintz, 
plaids or woven textured fabrics. Also there are country wallpapers with small 
flowered prints and geometrics -- many of these have borders and coordinating 
fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
Redo some of your pictures with more casual framing, add baskets and flowers, 
and, voila, you have country!

Can Homeowner Do Own 'Sponge Painting'? 
</P>
<P>
Q: I'm fascinated with the kinds of "sponge painting" I've seen in magazines 
and showcase houses. How do I find someone to do this? What does it cost? Or 
could I do it myself? 
</P>
<P>
A: Sponging, as well as glazing, stippling or blending several shades of color, 
are all special finishes employed by interior designers. With a little practice 
and care, you can have the same elegant effect. 
</P>
<P>
Sponging is worked by pouncing a sponge on the wall surface to give it a pebbly 
texture. The sponging is applied over plain, painted walls and woodwork and 
then a transparent glaze is added. 
</P>
<P>
There are some excellent books on this subject in your library or bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
There are crafsmen who do this kind of work. The cost of their services might 
be based on a flat or daily rate, and will vary depending on the size of your 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Should you find hiring out too expensive or choose not to tackle this type of 
project yourself, there are wall coverings available that approximate these 
looks.

Techniques to Light Room That's Dark 
</P>
<P>
Q: If you have a dark room, what is the most effective lighting? 
</P>
<P>
A: Begin by thinking about the shape and level of light required for tasks you 
'll perform in this room and for the atmosphere you'd like to create. The 
direction, intensity and distribution make up the shape. 
</P>
<P>
The shape of light is more important than the fixtures. Often, designers and 
clients concentrate on the look of fixtures and not on what happens to the 
light when it illuminates from the fixtures. Light has a dramatic effect on the 
way a space feels to us. 
</P>
<P>
Shapes of light include beams produced from down lights, adjustable accents and 
track lights. Washes are created from incandescent, fluorescent or 
high-intensity discharge wall washers. Pendant or wall mounted up lights, 
coves, valances and luminous ceilings tend to illuminate a space.

SPEAKING OUT: COLLECTIVE BARGAINING FOR HOUSING MAKES CENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK ICAZA, Icaza is president of United Food and Commercial Workers Local 
770. He is also president of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, 
AFL-CIO. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I believe unions should do more than negotiate for better pay and benefits. 
That's important, and United Food and Commercial Workers Local 770, which I 
lead, has won some of the best wages and benefits for food workers anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
But many problems faced by our 30,000 union members transcend collective 
bargaining. In Los Angeles, a big concern is owning your own home. It used to 
be a top goal for working families, especially young people just starting out. 
Many of our members are younger workers. 
</P>
<P>
Progress is often measured by the things we achieve for ourselves that our 
parents didn't enjoy. Most younger members in the work force grew up in 
neighborhoods where their parents owned their residences. But fewer children 
are as fortunate today. 
</P>
<P>
A recent state Senate report concluded that "home ownership is on the decline 
in this country for the first time since World War II." For the first time 
since 1944, the percentage of U.S. households owning their homes decreased, 
from 65.7% in 1980 to 64% in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a median-priced home in Los Angeles topped $217,000, for a 25.9% 
jump from the year before. In 1988, you had to earn more than $51,000 a year to 
buy a medium-priced house; only 26% of California households could afford to 
make such a purchase. Few working men and women can meet that threshold. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is worse for young people. In 1988, only 27.8% of 25-29 year olds 
in the western states owned homes, compared to 36% in 1980. A recent Harvard 
University study uses these and other statistics to predict "a permanent 
underclass of disadvantaged renters." 
</P>
<P>
The high cost of housing "jeopardizes the long-term financial security of 
future generations," the Harvard report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Many working families, even those with two income earners, have been forced to 
settle for more affordable homes in the far suburbs and long commutes to work. 
Others have postponed or canceled plans to purchase a house. 
</P>
<P>
A new proposal offers some hope for union members who would like to own their 
homes, but can't afford to. 
</P>
<P>
It began with an innovative contract negotiated in 1988 with Boston hotels by 
the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union. Under it, employers will 
pay 5 cents an hour into a joint trust fund to help hotel workers finance home 
purchases. Employers would then work together with the union in overseeing the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The money would help make down payments, pay closing costs or bank fees, obtain 
favorable interest rates or as collateral for mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
But before the $1-million housing trust fund can be set up, the federal 
Taft-Hartley Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 must be amended. In now 
allows employers to write off as tax deductions only payments to employee 
health and welfare funds that cover workers for such things as health and 
dental benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Amending the Taft-Hartley Act is controversial. Some union leaders and 
pro-labor Democrats worried that changing the Act to allow for the housing fund 
would open the door to other amendments hostile to working people. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) solved the problem with adjustments to a bill 
he introduced in 1989. It would permit unions and employers to bargain about 
establishing and administering trust funds that provide financial aid for 
employees seeking to own their homes. The measure is also backed by Sen. Orrin 
Hatch (R-Utah). 
</P>
<P>
The Kennedy bill was approved by the Senate late last year and was approved in 
early April by the House of Representatives. The Bush Administration backs the 
measure, and it's expected to soon become law. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Kennedy thinks the housing trust fund idea could be adopted by unions 
across the country when the Taft-Hartley law is amended. He says his bill could 
serve as a "model for the nation" because it "recognizes the hardships of 
working families in finding homes." 
</P>
<P>
Later this year, Local 770 joins other Food and Commercial Workers local unions 
in bargaining for new contracts with the Southern California supermarket 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Persuading employers to contribute into trust funds aiding union members is not 
a new idea. Companies already pay into trust funds providing union members with 
dental, psychiatric, orthodontic and vision care plus hearing aids, speech 
therapy, preventive medicine, pensions and supplemental unemployment benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Why not a fund to help with housing? 
</P>
<P>
An informal survey of our union members has demonstrated much interest in 
pursuing a program to aid home purchasers -- even if it means taking several 
cents an hour for housing trust fund contributions out of prospective pay 
raises. Employees are mindful that benefit increases must come from the same 
pot of money that goes to fund wage boosts. 
</P>
<P>
A joint union-management trust fund won't solve the housing crunch in Los 
Angeles. But it may be something constructive unions could do to help their 
members realize the dream of home ownership.

ENDOWMENT CAMPAIGN TAKES CENTER STAGE;

CASH-POOR ORANGE COUNTY PERFORMING ARTS CENTER KICKS OFF A DRIVE TO QUADRUPLE 
ITS ASSETS AND CLOSE UP ITS GAPING 'INCOME GAP' 
</P>

<P>
With familiar fanfare, the Orange County Performing Arts Center has launched a 
drive to nearly quadruple the cash assets of its Endowment Fund, an investment 
fund intended largely to help bridge the inevitable gap between ticket sales 
and annual expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Center officials say they already can count on more than $50 million in pledges 
to the endowment -- but that's money that may not come in for a long, long 
time. The pledges, most in the form of such deferred gifts as will bequests, 
are essentially IOUs, expected (though most are not legally binding) to be paid 
over the next 30 to 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the endowment sits at only $3.2 million in actual cash, on hand and 
earning income in interest and dividends. In hard dollars, the endowment makes 
up less than 20% of the $17 million it takes to run the Center for one year. 
</P>
<P>
Does that spell trouble? Compared with other major American performing arts 
centers, does Orange County's endowment fall precipitously short? 
</P>
<P>
The Kentucky Center for the Performing Arts has an endowment -- all of it in 
cash -- of $5 million, the same size as its annual operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
The Tennessee Performing Arts Center, which also has a budget of $5 million, 
has a cash endowment of nearly twice that, $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, ask Lawrence J. Wilker, head of Cleveland's Playhouse Square 
Center, about that organization's endowment and he delivers a Yiddish lesson: 
"You know what eppes means? Eppes means zero. We have zero endowment." 
</P>
<P>
The situation is the same at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, which nonetheless 
has managed to stay in business for 128 years, longer than any other performing 
arts center in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Endowments, it seems, vary from place to place just as surely as programs and 
playbills, expenses and revenues. "There are no norms, no rules of thumb that I 
know of," said David Eiteman, who teaches financial management of nonprofit 
organizations for UCLA's graduate arts management program. 
</P>
<P>
Just about everyone wants an endowment, though. No performing arts center can 
pay the bills on box office alone. Every year, charitable contributions or some 
other form of revenue must be used to meet expenses, which means that an 
enormous effort often must be spent on fund raising -- an especially 
challenging task in an increasingly competitive market. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Center had to come up with more than $4 million to cover its 
1989 operating shortfall, to bridge the "income gap," as officials there say, 
between between costs and revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Endowment income is generated from principal assets that are set aside 
permanently. It is, therefore, impervious to the vagaries of annual fund 
raising and thus lends financial stability. Endowments can avert insolvency in 
worst-case scenarios, Eiteman said. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he added, by lessening reliance on ticket revenue, endowments can 
allow greater freedom to present more experimental or adventurous programming 
-- which, according to some observers, has been in short supply at the Center. 
</P>
<P>
The variance in endowments' size -- and whether they exist at all -- has to do 
with several factors, experts say. Among them are a community's financial 
resources, an organization's age, whether it must raise money to construct 
facilities, and the length of time that's been spent building the endowment 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
How come the three-theater Tennessee Performing Arts Center has an endowment 
twice the size of its budget? Largely because officials there never had to ask 
the private sector for money to construct facilities, or cash to cover annual 
operating expenses, according to chief financial officer Gary Gossett. 
</P>
<P>
The center, Gossett said, was founded in an established building and its 
officials don't rely on private donations to bolster operating revenue, but on 
funds from such alternative sources as concession sales and theater rental. So, 
when Nashville community leaders trudged the fund-raising trail, they were 
asking only for endowment contributions. By the time their center opened in 
1979, they'd already amassed $5 million for the endowment. "It would almost be 
suicide" to have simultaneously requested funds for an endowment and for 
construction and operation of three theaters, Gossett said. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, officials at Playhouse Square, who had to raise capital to build 
and renovate their theaters, opted against an endowment drive. "You've got to 
give (donors) a break," said Wilker, a former chairman of the Assn. of 
Performing Arts Centers, a nationwide service organization. Only now, he said, 
is development of an endowment under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Orange County Center, though, wanted to have it both ways: 
They solicited building funds and started building an endowment, too. (Indeed, 
the endowment drive preceded the construction campaign. More than $73 million, 
about 30% of that in pledges, had been raised to build a single theater by the 
time the Center opened in 1986; the endowment began in 1982.) 
</P>
<P>
However, as Center Chairman Henry T. Segerstrom explained recently, while the 
building campaign went after cash, "the thrust of the (initial) endowment 
campaign was in deferred gifts." The upside was that the various fund-raisers 
didn't find themselves competing with each other. But the downside is an 
endowment that today is mostly promises, not money in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Eiteman and others gave the Center's current total endowment a good 
rating. While cautioning that comparisons are tenuous, since community wealth 
and other factors can vary so widely, Eiteman noted that the Center "is a new 
organization and, in addition to start-up costs, it has been able to raise 
certainly a fair amount of money. It's a good start, it's a good endowment." 
</P>
<P>
So why, then, do Center officials want to raise more endowment cash? If the 
endowment doesn't seem to be ailing, why not solicit money for other needs, 
such as education programs or outreach to the under-served, for instance? 
</P>
<P>
A larger cash endowment is a priority basically because it would relieve some 
of that "never-ceasing" pressure of annual fund raising, Segerstrom said. He 
added, though, that the Center's endowment is unrestricted; endowment funds may 
be allocated for education or outreach, as the endowment grows. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of the new campaign is to increase the endowment's cash assets to $12 
million by the end of 1993. Segerstrom said that that would increase annual 
endowment interest to at least $1 million a year by the end of 1993. Endowment 
interest last year totaled $140,000, Center figures show. 
</P>
<P>
Segerstrom said that in the long run -- three to five years from now -- a 
larger cash endowment could also mean more "daring" programming, and could 
allow the Center to produce more programming instead of importing events. 
</P>
<P>
"The time to build your financial security is during those periods when your 
operating results are good," Segerstrom said. "That's what we're trying to do." 
Center officials say 1989 was a record year for attendance, that box office 
revenue covered 83% of operating costs. Typically, about two-thirds of a 
performing arts center's budget is covered by ticket sales, according to 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Still, fund raising to support annual operations certainly won't halt just 
because an endowment-cash campaign is under way. Is there potential now for 
competition between the two funding drives -- the very thing the Center tried 
to avoid during its construction phase? And construction may not be over. The 
Center has announced tentative plans to build two new theaters by 1998. 
Couldn't the new campaign mean competition when it comes time to seek new 
building funds? 
</P>
<P>
Segerstrom acknowledged that there are no easy answers. "That's a whole other 
area and we simply haven't come to that," he said. "We would obviously precede 
any further facility commitment by a very thorough analysis, a fund-raising 
study, so we would have some assurance before anything was started that there 
was a satisfactory donor base."

RANDY LEWIS: HATE-MONGERS ARE A SAD CHAPTER IN THE HISTORY OF COMEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Randy Lewis 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most important comedians have always been those who helped knock down the 
social, racial, economic and/or cultural barriers that keep people apart. 
</P>
<P>
In the '30s, Charlie Chaplin and the Marx Brothers made sure that society's 
little tramps didn't get steamrolled in America's desperate quest for the 
better life. Though they worked from greatly different vantage points, Lenny 
Bruce and Bill Cosby contributed during the 1960s to the condemnation of 
culturally ingrained racism. And Woody Allen has built a career on giving hope 
to nerds throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, comedians often have assumed the role that the sage assigned to 
journalists -- "to comfort the afflicted and to afflict the comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, some new-generation descendants of the greats have begun to 
worship the tools some of their forefathers used -- stinging insults, graphic 
language, sexually explicit situations -- without understanding the job for 
which those tools were employed. I refer to two of the today's hottest stand-up 
comics, performers who have reached rock 'n' roll-star status capable of 
filling huge concert halls and arenas: Sam Kinison and Andrew (Dice) Clay. 
</P>
<P>
Each is scheduled to play Orange County this week: Kinison in a club date at 
the Laff Stop in Newport Beach and Clay at the 18,765-capacity Pacific 
Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa. (Sam usually does larger facilities, but he booked 
this one himself, reportedly to help pay his considerable alimony bills.) 
</P>
<P>
Both have captured the attention (I would have said "imagination," but that's 
far too complimentary) of the MTV-generation audience. Both appeal primarily to 
teen-aged males -- no surprise, considering the heavily misogynist content of 
both their acts. If I were a woman and a date took me to see either of these 
wild boors, I'd ask for his money back -- then hail a cab. 
</P>
<P>
Though I'm at a loss to explain the popularity of either, Clay is the bigger 
mystery. (By the way, if you're looking for lots of examples of their "jokes" 
here, forget it. The amount of each man's material that can be quoted in a 
family newspaper probably weighs less than a stegosaurus's brain.) 
</P>
<P>
With Kinison, it's easier to identify (if not identify with) the primal 
catharsis in some of his routines. On his first album, there was an underlying 
sense of true frustration at the hypocrisy he experienced in the life he led as 
a preacher before turning his back on the church and becoming the antichrist of 
stand-up. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Kinison, unlike Clay, knows how to structure a joke that is created out 
of a unique (albeit generally base) perspective. And Kinison knows how to 
deliver a punch line. 
</P>
<P>
One old routine about how difficult Jesus might have found it to explain his 
Crucifixion and Resurrection to a wife displayed originality, intellect and 
absurd juxtaposition of the real and the far-fetched. Sound comic principals, 
all. 
</P>
<P>
But since then, Kinison has been caught up in his own fame: He spends nearly as 
much time on his latest album responding to Rolling Stone comments about his 
reputed wild lifestyle as he does creating "new" material. And that consists of 
inflaming racist attitudes toward Iranians, gays, women, the physically 
disabled and just about anyone in the world who's not Sam Kinison. 
</P>
<P>
Dice Clay, however, doesn't even have that much going for him. How he has so 
quickly become a national phenomenon is a mystery that ranks up there with how 
TV execs ever thought Pat Sajak would one day unseat Johnny Carson. 
</P>
<P>
If there's more than meets the eye to Clay's act -- a leather-jacketed New Yawk 
street thug who brags about every bizarre twist on intercourse he knows -- I 
can't find it. Clay substitutes unbridled repugnance for viewpoint, odious 
epithets for insight. He's as funny as a gang rape, as clever as a midnight 
mugging. 
</P>
<P>
Lenny Bruce showed that comedy can be tough, brutal and sometimes even ugly in 
skewering the objects of his scorn. But those targets were small-mindedness, 
bigotry and hate -- traits that Clay and Kinison would rather lionize. Their 
loathsome attacks on women, homosexuals, ethnic minorities and others aren't 
pointed or thought-provoking. They are simply imbecilic. Perhaps Clay doesn't 
make jokes about the chronically stupid because they would hit too close to 
home. 
</P>
<P>
If there's any rationalization for Clay's moronic-punk persona, it could only 
be that he really is a brilliant performance artist whose very presence exposes 
how easily America can fall in line behind a crude, unthinking, spectacularly 
unfunny delinquent. 
</P>
<P>
Could it be that both are so hugely popular for the simple reason that they 
accurately reflect, and give voice to, the values of their audience? That a 
young generation bred on the senseless brutality of slasher movies like "Friday 
the 13th" and "Nightmare on Elm Street" have become (to borrow Hunter S. 
Thompson's pet phrase) a nation of swine? 
</P>
<P>
Is it possible that, because celebrity worship has been elevated to the rank of 
religious experience, we have surrendered the ability to think critically when 
in the presence of a "star"? Otherwise, why would audiences grant not just 
their approval but their delight at attitudes and behavior that, if expressed 
by a child or a stranger at the supermarket, they would greet with the back of 
a hand? 
</P>
<P>
More disturbing yet is the realization is that Kinison and Clay, because they 
are at the top of the stand-up comedy heap right now if only in terms of their 
ticket-selling potential, undoubtedly are spawning dozens, maybe hundreds of 
imitators who are dying to step into their dung-encrusted jackboots. 
</P>
<P>
Remember the scene in Woody Allen's "Manhattan," when a question -- how does 
one respond to neo-Nazis -- pops up at a posh party of left-wing intellectuals? 
"We should go down there," Woody suggests, "get some bricks and some baseball 
bats and really explain things to them." When one haughty woman opines: "Really 
biting satire is always better than physical force," Woody retorts: "No, 
physical force is always better with Nazis." 
</P>
<P>
But the best course of action simply may be the one you'd take with bratty 
children who misbehave just for the attention they can draw: ignore them and 
hope -- no, pray -- they'll go away.

GADFLY BUZZING GATES OVER HIS POLITICAL FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN WEIKEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sparing no expense, Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates threw three Christmas 
parties for his office staff at the tony Four Seasons Hotel and The Ritz in 
Newport Beach. He picked up the tab with $5,891 in campaign funds. 
</P>
<P>
The gunslinger get-up Gates wore to a California State Sheriff's Assn. 
conference cost $1,598, and the price tag for art he wanted for an election 
fund-raiser was $13,872. Political contributions paid for both. 
</P>
<P>
Reaching once more into his donations, campaign disclosure statements show 
Gates bought $1,565 worth of Los Angeles Rams tickets for his staff and 
supporters. When the sheriff needed limousines for transportation to political 
events, campaign funds paid for them too. 
</P>
<P>
Six weeks into his bid for a fifth term as the most powerful law enforcement 
official in the county, Gates is already under fire for the way he spends what 
the late state Treasurer Jesse M. Unruh called the "mother's milk of politics." 
</P>
<P>
The strong criticism has come from Shirley L. Grindle, a veteran political 
activist who has specialized in bird-dogging campaign donations to the County 
Board of Supervisors to make sure there isn't a whiff of conflict of interest 
in any of their votes. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past 10 days, she has filed a complaint against Gates with the Orange 
County district attorney's office and has asked the Fair Political Practices 
Commission, a state watchdog agency, to audit the sheriff's campaign 
expenditures since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
From meals at Harrah's at Lake Tahoe to the cellular phone in his Cadillac, 
Grindle suspects that Gates might have spent thousands of dollars in violation 
of state campaign spending laws. 
</P>
<P>
"He's carrying on in a high style," Grindle said. "I have never seen a local 
politician entertain his constituents like he does. Gates is the only one in 
the county doing this. He makes the County Board of Supervisors look like 
kindergartners." 
</P>
<P>
Gates' political handlers say Grindle's charges are frivolous, little more than 
a shallow political stunt cooked up for the benefit of Don Bankhead, a retired 
Fullerton police captain challenging Gates in the June election. Part of 
Bankhead's campaign strategy is to raise questions about Gates' personal 
integrity. 
</P>
<P>
"He has never bought his wife a fur coat or taken her to Tahiti with campaign 
funds," said David R. White, Gates' campaign treasurer. "One of the things I 
notice is that the people who campaign against him can't get enough support in 
the community so they have to use the press to get it for them." 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff did not respond to repeated inquiries to comment on Grindle's 
accusations. 
</P>
<P>
Grindle, a vocal opponent of Gates, announced she was going to take official 
action against the sheriff on April 12 during a political gathering for 
Bankhead at the Irvine Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, she filed a complaint with the district attorney's office 
alleging that Gates' was illegally renting his campaign office space from a 
corporation he and his wife own in San Juan Capistrano. Grindle also questioned 
whether campaign funds were improperly donated to a horseback riding event 
hosted by the company, Ortega Equestrian Center. 
</P>
<P>
This week, she formally requested that the Fair Political Practices Commission, 
which monitors campaign financing in the state, audit three years' worth of 
Gates' campaign expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not like this looking like it's a political gambit," Grindle said. "I 
don't care whether Don Bankhead is running, but I think Gates should be out of 
office. I do know a lot about campaign stuff. If Gates is violating the law, it 
has nothing to do with Bankhead." 
</P>
<P>
The Bankhead camp, which has mounted a grass-roots effort to unseat Gates' 
well-financed campaign, denies any involvement with Grindle's decision to take 
on the sheriff over his expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
"This is Shirley operating on her own," said Wade G. Richmond, Bankhead's 
campaign manger. "She only contacted us as a courtesy. We really shouldn't get 
involved in this while awaiting word from the D.A. We should just let the 
normal process take place." 
</P>
<P>
Under state campaign finance law, political contributions can be spent on 
anything with a "reasonable relationship" to political, legislative or 
governmental purposes. Expenditures of primarily personal benefit to candidates 
and campaign staff are prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
Allen Ashby, a spokesman for the state attorney general's office, said the law 
is deliberately designed to allow a broad range of expenses so it would not 
have "a chilling effect on the political process." 
</P>
<P>
There are some specifics, however. Candidates cannot use political 
contributions to rent campaign office space directly from their immediate 
families or the treasurers of their election committees. 
</P>
<P>
Individual donations from a business or a citizen are limited to $1,000 a year, 
and gifts to staff and supporters worth more than $100 are prohibited unless 
they relate to a political, legislative or governmental purpose. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the state attorney general's office has issued at least 67 opinion 
letters to elected officials detailing how campaign donations can be spent, 
ranging from travel abroad to bonuses for campaign staff members. 
</P>
<P>
Acceptable under the law are the traditional parties, tokens of appreciation, 
and in some instances bonuses for campaign workers after a successful election 
campaign. But gifts, money or other items given as compensation for service are 
considered inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
The opinion letters state that campaign funds can be used to buy tickets to 
athletic events for campaign staff and constituents. Campaign funds can also 
donated to charities as long as the donation relates to a political, 
legislative or governmental purpose. With respect to clothing, campaign funds 
can be used for a "reasonable" wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing Gates' campaign disclosure statements several weeks ago, 
Grindle said she suspected that the sheriff might have made personal use of 
campaign funds and received some contributions that exceeded the legal limit. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Grindle wants the FPPC to look at $2,000 in campaign 
contributions to Gates in one year from Valenti and Coelho Inc., a real estate 
investment firm in Tustin, although the legal limit is $1,000 per year in 
contributions from a business or individual. Campaign disclosure forms show two 
$1,000 contributions from the company in February, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Grindle further contends that Gates might have misused campaign funds by paying 
$1,611 this year in rent for his election headquarters to Ortega Equestrian 
Center. Campaign disclosure statements show that Gates also paid $1,611 in rent 
to the Equestrian Center in 1989, but state provisions restricting rent were 
not in effect at that time. 
</P>
<P>
Grindle says Gates gave another $1,200 in campaign funds over the last three 
years to Ortega Equestrian Center for a horseback riding competition there. 
Gates' lawyer says the money was a charitable donation allowable under the law. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the $1,598 costume Gates wore to the sheriff's association 
function, Grindle questions what she calls "voluminous amounts" of campaign 
funds Gates has spent for meals, entertainment, a car phone and gifts for his 
staff and constituents. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign disclosure forms show that Gates spent $9,517 for calls from his 
cellular car phone; $21,928 on gifts for his constituents; and $13,601 for 
meals and travel expenses related to "political" events, some of which were 
Christmas parties for his staff and functions in Lake Arrowhead, San Luis 
Obispo, Long Beach, Stateline, Nev., on Lake Tahoe, and Laughlin, Nev. More 
than $2,140 was used for limousine service. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that Mr. Gates is entertaining Orange County and calling it 
political entertainment," Grindle said. "These things are representative of my 
concerns. I don't know of any one who keeps a campaign headquarters alive in 
non-election years." 
</P>
<P>
Gates' campaign manager, Eileen Padberg, and his lawyer, Darryl R. Wold, defend 
the sheriff, saying he has gone to great lengths to check and double-check his 
expenditures to make sure they comply with campaign finance laws. They said 
Grindle's allegations are another in a series of charges that have been made 
against the sheriff for more than a decade and never proven. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel confident that all is squared away," Padberg said. "Grindle works for 
Bankhead and she is going to do what she has to do and we are going to do what 
we have to do. She holds herself out as an expert in this area, but we will 
see." 
</P>
<P>
Grindle led the fight 12 years ago to pass the so-called TIN CUP ordinance, 
which prohibits members of the Board of Supervisors from voting on or 
influencing decisions that will have a financial or material impact on their 
major campaign contributors. Since then, Grindle, who devotes considerable time 
to seeing that the ordinance is enforced, said she has become familiar with 
state campaign laws. 
</P>
<P>
But Gates' supporters say she doesn't know what she is talking about with 
respect to the sheriff. Legally, there is no problem, Wold said, because 
campaign funds were never diverted to personal use and rent for office space 
was paid to a corporation, an arrangement that is not prohibited by law. Wold 
said expenditures for tickets and parties are legitimate ways to recognize good 
work and maintain staff morale. 
</P>
<P>
"All she is doing is saying that she has suspicions," Wold said. "She has no 
facts. She is just a Gates opponent making charges. Anybody can do that. We 
don't attack someone unless we have the facts to support it. If she has facts, 
let her produce them." 
</P>
<P>
HOW GATES HAS SPENT DONATIONS 
</P>
<P>
Political activist Shirley L. Grindle of Orange has asked the state Fair 
Political Practices Commission and the Orange County district attorney's office 
to investigate the way Sheriff Brad Gates spends his campaign funds. Among 
others, she questions the following expenditures: 
</P>
<P>
1,598: Costume for California State Sheriff's Assn. conference 
</P>
<P>
$13,872: Artwork for a sheriff's fund-raiser 
</P>
<P>
$1,565: Los Angeles Rams tickets 
</P>
<P>
$2,400: Staff Christmas party at Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
$1,611: Rent for campaign headquarters paid in 1990 to OTRA Inc.,which Gates' 
family owns 
</P>
<P>
$1,200: Charitable equestrian event at Ortega Equestrian Center,which Gates' 
family owns.

DIANNE KLEIN: THE VISIONS OF DYING CHILDREN SEEM TO BRING GOD ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANNE KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Geni Bennetts, director of hematology and oncology at Childrens Hospital of 
Orange County, is a woman of science. She heals children, or she tries to, with 
the aid of the world's most advanced medical technology. 
</P>
<P>
I have come to see her today, however, to talk about the vastness beyond the 
limits of medicine, a phenomenon that fuzzes black and white and verifiable 
scientific explanations. 
</P>
<P>
Talking about this with me makes Geni Bennetts a little uncomfortable. She 
doesn't want to sound like a kook, which she is most certainly not. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot accept it as science," she says. "I accept it as part of life. I have 
never tried to prove it -- or disprove it. I just accept it." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bennetts and I are talking about life after death, about hope, and about 
children's amazingly similar visions only hours, or moments, before they die. 
</P>
<P>
Listening to children foretell their own deaths, and then hearing them comfort 
the parents they will leave behind, has changed Dr. Bennetts' life. Never in 
her 15 years of treating children with cancer has she found a child's 
premonition to be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
When Geni Bennetts tells me some of these children's stories, her eyes, and my 
own, cloud with tears. 
</P>
<P>
Seven-year-old Danny had leukemia. He was hospitalized at CHOC and was not 
expected to survive. His friend, Timmy, had died not long before. 
</P>
<P>
Late one afternoon, Danny's mother was at his bedside as her son slept. When he 
awoke, Danny found his mother in tears. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't cry," Danny told his mother. "Do you see my angel? She's outside my 
window. She's telling me that she is going to take me to Timmy. She says that 
Timmy and I are going to go fishing." 
</P>
<P>
Danny died later that night. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the children that Dr. Bennetts tells me about have come from religious 
homes; others have not. All of them have been on medication, but their visions, 
reported matter-of-factly between more prosaic talk of everyday life, belie the 
suggestion that they spring from a drug-induced haze. 
</P>
<P>
"We in medicine have seen people hallucinating," Dr. Bennetts says. "It isn't 
like that. These children are perfectly lucid." 
</P>
<P>
The number of children who have had peaceful visions of their own death is 
impossible to know. Dr. Bennetts, however, is not the first to publicly talk 
about them. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Diane Komp, a specialist in oncology and a professor of pediatrics at Yale 
University School of Medicine in New Haven, is writing a book about similar 
experiences with her young patients. 
</P>
<P>
After publishing an article in Theology Today in October, 1988, which spawned 
further publicity, she says many parents wrote to tell her of their children's 
peaceful deaths after experiencing such visions -- during their waking hours or 
in their dreams. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the impartation of peace from these experiences is what has had the 
most impact on me," says Dr. Komp, who has been practicing medicine for almost 
25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bennetts says fewer children tell her of their visions these days because, 
thanks to medical advances, fewer of her patients die. And if it is at all 
possible, physicians honor requests to transfer terminally ill children to 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it seems, regardless of where a child dies, the stories of deathbed 
visions are remarkably the same. 
</P>
<P>
"So many of the kids talk to their angels," Dr. Bennetts says. "One mother 
called me after her child died at home. She said the angels were there too." 
</P>
<P>
And many of the terminally ill, she says, hang on to life until they have 
completed certain tasks. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle, stricken with bone cancer, had been a patient of Dr. Bennetts for 
seven years. One day, Dr. Bennetts called on her in her hospital room. 
Michelle, then 21 years old, asked if she was going to die. 
</P>
<P>
"I said yes. And then I started to cry. I told her I had done my best. She 
started to comfort me. She said that she just needed to know and then she 
showed me a list, which I didn't even read then, of the things that she wanted 
to get done. Before she died, everything on that list was done. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Children seem to know when life is leaving them, even at 2 or 3 years of age," 
Dr. Bennetts goes on. "I've seen one 3-year-old sit up in bed and say, 'I'm 
dying,' and two hours later, the kid was dead. . . . These children are not 
afraid if they are not in pain." 
</P>
<P>
Another CHOC patient, 5-year-old Johnny, had leukemia. He had been close to a 
little girl, Erica, who had died of a brain tumor. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny, at the time, was a big fan of "Star Wars." The movie had just come out. 
Johnny was taken by ambulance to see the movie in a theater, while lying on a 
gurney. He had all his "Star Wars" toys lined up at the foot of his hospital 
bed. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in the room," Dr. Bennetts says. "And he started talking to someone. He 
was perfectly lucid. He had been talking to me and his mother. Then he said it 
was Erica who was there, and that she wanted to play with his toys. He wouldn't 
let her." 
</P>
<P>
Over the next few days, Johnny told of seeing Erica again and again. He still 
wouldn't allow her to play with his toys. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been thinking, as this went on, that if Johnny let Erica play with his 
toys, maybe he would die. . . . That's exactly what happened. The day that he 
told his mother that he was going to play with Erica was the day he died." 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan, who was 8 years old, had a brain tumor, but he had been receiving 
chemotherapy and his condition was stable. Dr. Bennetts thought he had, at the 
very least, several more months to live. 
</P>
<P>
"One night, at 2 in the morning, he bolts upright in bed," Dr. Bennetts says. 
"He says, 'I want to see a priest.' He wasn't Catholic, so I didn't really 
understand this, but he was demanding to be blessed and to see his mother and 
father and brother. 
</P>
<P>
"They called me, and I told them to go ahead and call everyone. Father Mack 
(then a chaplain with St. Joseph's Hospital) got out of bed and blessed him. I 
came in. His family came in. He said goodby to everyone. He said he knew he was 
dying and that everything was fine. He lay down and never woke up. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't have predicted for anything that he would have died that night." 
</P>
<P>
Another boy, a 4-year-old Asian whose family did not practice a Christian 
faith, had a vision of an angel visiting him and then summoned members of the 
hospital staff into his room. He thanked each of them for helping him and then 
he said goodby. 
</P>
<P>
"Then he laid down and died," Dr. Bennetts says. "He was not upset, not at all. 
But you can imagine. There wasn't a dry eye on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
Geni Bennetts says that for most of her life, she did not believe in life after 
death. She has abandoned the religion of her childhood, and to this day she is 
not formally affiliated with any faith. 
</P>
<P>
Yet her experiences with dying children have deepened her personal conviction 
that there is indeed a God, one who has taken, and cradled, the children that 
she loved. 
</P>
<P>
"God was real to these children," she says. "It certainly is comforting to me 
that these kids are going on to a better place, where someone is taking care of 
them better than I could. I couldn't fix them. . . . These kids have changed my 
life."

TOBACCO WAR WILL TARGET MINORITIES; 
</P>

HEALTH: ORANGE COUNTY EXPECTS TO START A $2.9-MILLION PROGRAM IN JUNE TO 
DISCOURAGE SMOKING IN THE ETHNIC POPULATIONS THAT ARE NOW UNDER SIEGE BY AN

<P>
SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a young woman in Cambodia, Kol Yon started chewing a concoction of betel 
nut, lime juice and thick clumps of tobacco because she wanted the scarlet lips 
and black teeth her culture considered beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
Now Kol Yon, 78, says she chews for the sensation on her lips and the nicotine 
high. She picks out her ingredients from dozens of products on sale at the 
Asian market near her apartment in downtown Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
She has never heard, she said, about cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Not far from where Kol Yon and her friends congregate to chew together at an 
apartment that doubles as a Buddhist temple, a Spanish-language billboard on 
17th Street adorned with a cartoon camel and a flashy convertible promises 
young Latinos that a cigarette is suave, or smooth. 
</P>
<P>
Both examples are drawn from the newest front in the state's $220-million war 
on tobacco: Orange County's effort to reach minorities who have brought age-old 
tobacco customs with them to the United States or -- far more disturbing to 
health officials -- who are being attracted to smoking for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"They (tobacco companies) need to find new markets because smoking kills off a 
lot of their customers, and a lot of others are quitting," said Dr. Hildy 
Meyers, director of the county's new anti-tobacco campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of obvious where they're going. A lot of promotional and billboard 
advertising is aimed at minorities." 
</P>
<P>
The anti-tobacco campaign will be paid for with the county's share of the 
Proposition 99 statewide tax, which added 25 cents to a pack of cigarettes as 
of January, 1989, and is expected to net Orange County $2.9 million over the 
next two years. 
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to build a network of educational and counseling 
services that will work through schools, physicians, clinics and neighborhood 
community groups to discourage tobacco use. Health officials are putting the 
final touches on a proposal expected to be presented to the Board of 
Supervisors in May. 
</P>
<P>
The program, the first comprehensive anti-tobacco effort ever undertaken by the 
county, is set to get under way in June. 
</P>
<P>
The theme of the public awareness program echoes that of the state's sometimes 
controversial anti-tobacco billboard and broadcast advertising blitz. Since it 
was unveiled two weeks ago, several television stations have refused to run 
some of the ads, saying they are unfair to the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
Like the state, the county will target minorities, who health officials say are 
being exploited by cigarette advertising. Those considered most vulnerable, 
according to the county's target list, are blacks, Latinos, Asians and 
teen-agers. The county campaign will also focus on those who face the greatest 
risk from tobacco smoke: women and teen-age girls who are pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
Among the trends most disturbing to health officials is the apparent increase 
in cigarette use among female members of minority groups. Smoking rates among 
young female Asian and Latino immigrants, for example, have tended to be lower 
than the rates among young Anglo females born in the United States. But as 
these young immigrant women have become more westernized, their smoking rates 
have climbed, health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
These young women are among the most likely to be attracted by cigarette ads 
that stress sophistication and liberation, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Young male Latinos, whose smoking rates are far higher than their Anglo 
counterparts, are also increasingly targeted by cigarette advertising, health 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers cites a 1987 study by a private health research group that reported the 
tobacco industry spent $490.7 million on advertising aimed at Latinos living in 
the United States, more than a 20% increase over the year before. 
</P>
<P>
"The cigarette marketing people are very clever so the health department people 
need to be," explains Nampet Panchipant-M, director of immigrant services for 
the county health department and one of the coordinators of the anti-smoking 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
As part of their counterattack, county officials hope to set up a 24-hour 
multilingual hot line to offer advice and counseling referrals to smokers or 
relatives of those who smoke within minority populations. 
</P>
<P>
The dangers of secondary smoke, especially to pregnant women, will be given 
heavy emphasis in the county campaign. Pregnant women who call the hot line, 
for example, might be offered advice on reducing their exposure to cigarettes 
even if they don't smoke, but live or work closely with a smoker. 
</P>
<P>
County officials are quick to acknowledge, however, that they must place their 
greatest emphasis on work outside their offices and within the community. The 
addition of three "bilingual and bicultural" health educators was recommended 
in an earlier report to the Board of Supervisors to help bridge both language 
and cultural gaps. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to go where the target population is," said Panchipant-M, 
herself a native of Thailand. "If we say you can come to our clinic and we'll 
help you, they're not going to come. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Health department officials say they will borrow a page of the tobacco 
industry's advertising manual by trying to come up with themes that target 
specific ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, officials point to a Spanish-language brochure produced by the 
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which they say capitalizes on the 
Latino culture's traditionally close-knit families. Rather than stressing only 
the benefits to an individual's health, the brochure urges smokers to quit for 
the sake of their loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, messages aimed at Asian smokers, Panchipant-M said, must be 
carefully worded to politely suggest that they consider quitting while avoiding 
a more direct message that would be considered culturally rude. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, reaching the diverse Asian community with an effective 
anti-tobacco campaign will be a formidable task. 
</P>
<P>
Simply put, Panchipant M said, there is no "unified infrastructure" for 
communicating to the 200,000 Asian-born residents of Orange County. Officials 
must shape a message for 17 different population groups, each with distinct 
cultures and languages or dialects. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some of those population groups -- the Hmong mountain tribes of Laos 
recruited by the United States to fight during the Vietnam War, for example -- 
have no tradition of a written language. Many other immigrants from war-torn 
rural areas of Southeast Asia have no formal education and have never learned 
to read or write. 
</P>
<P>
For those groups, county officials said they will have to rely heavily on 
visual messages and direct person-to-person contact. But beyond literacy 
problems lies a more fundamental barrier: the lack of even the most rudimentary 
understanding of health issues. 
</P>
<P>
TROUBLESOME TARGET 
</P>
<P>
* The state's $220-million war on tobacco will direct $2.9 million into Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
* A main target will be the 200,000 Asian-born residents here, but officials 
must shape a message for 17 groups, each with distinct languages. 
</P>
<P>
* Some messages must be worded to politely suggest that they quit, while 
avoiding a more direct message that would be taken as culturally rude. 
</P>
<P>
* As part of their attack, county officials hope to set up a 24-hour 
multilingual hot line to offer advice to minority-group smokers.

LAGUNA HILLS SQUAD SAYS SMART MONEY'S ON THEM

After two days of mind-bending tests, quizzes, speeches and interviews, the 
Laguna Hills High School Academic Decathlon team was among the top contenders 
when competition concluded Saturday at the national championship for America's 
smartest teens. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills, representing California, failed in its bid to win Saturday's 
final event, the Super Quiz, a fast-paced, multiple-choice exam that pits teams 
head to head. But the 600-point difference between Laguna Hills and the winners 
of the Super Quiz, the state champions from Arizona and Massachusetts, left the 
Orange County team well within reach of the national title. 
</P>
<P>
The winning team will be announced today at an awards banquet at the Des Moines 
Marriott. The champions will be treated to a White House visit Thursday, when 
they will be personally congratulated by President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"If you finish in the top five in the Super Quiz, an overall win is certainly 
within your grasp," said Laguna Hills coach Roger Gunderson after the 90-minute 
quiz, which was nationally televised by Iowa public television from the Des 
Moines Convention Center. "We came in third in the Super Quiz in the state 
(championship), and we still came back to win it." 
</P>
<P>
The official standings were not released after the event, although Gunderson 
said Laguna Hills finished in the top four in the Super Quiz. Overall standings 
also were kept secret by U.S. Academic Decathlon officials. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills team captain Jeff McCombs, an 18-year-old senior, said that 
despite the team's showing in the Super Quiz, he remained confident that the 
nine-man squad will be on its way to Washington later this week. 
</P>
<P>
Other teams "may have been extremely strong in their state competitions in the 
Super Quiz and weak in other areas," he said. "We do well in the Super Quiz, 
but it's not our strongest area." 
</P>
<P>
The Super Quiz was the last event in the Academic Decathlon, which tested 
students from 38 states and the District of Columbia in essay-writing, 
interviewing and speech skills in the subjects of social science, science, 
mathematics, economics, language, and literature and fine arts. The Super Quiz 
was the only event in which students competed head to head. 
</P>
<P>
In the final event, the teams were split into three groups based on grade-point 
average and given five multiple-choice questions each on Native American 
history and affairs, with seven seconds to answer each question. A correct 
answer was worth 200 points. 
</P>
<P>
McCombs and juniors Jay Kim, 16, and Ryan Sakamoto, 16, were the "A" group. The 
"B" group was seniors Mike Lee, 17, and Jack Dietz, 17, and junior Todd Faurot, 
16. The "C" group was made up of seniors Julian Kingston, Jeff DeWit and Bill 
Fischer, all 17 years old. 
</P>
<P>
In the Super Quiz, they were tested on questions such as: "The last sustained 
Indian uprising in the United States was led by (a) Chief Joseph, (b) 
Blackhawk, (c) Cochise, (d) Geronimo or (e) Crazy Horse." (Geronimo is the 
right response.) 
</P>
<P>
Among those in the audience at the Super Quiz was a contingent of about 30 
Laguna Hills parents, relatives and school administrators who made the journey 
from Orange County to see the boys in action. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether they win or lose, it won't be because they didn't try," said Jim 
DeWit, father of Jeff. "They did their best, and that's all we can ask. But on 
the other hand, we're still keeping our fingers crossed." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills scored 25 correct answers, for 5,000 points, in the Super Quiz. It 
was not known how many points the team scored in the other events, although 
team members for the most part expressed confidence when questioned after each 
test Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Kingston, who scored a perfect 5-for-5 on the Super Quiz, emerged from his 
personal interview Friday pumping his hands and grinning broadly. "It was 
amazing -- one guy (judge) was nodding, another guy was applauding," he said. 
"I think they liked it."

FAMILY SAYS SLAIN TEEN WAS TRYING TO AVOID GANGS

<P>
Roger Ochoa wanted to break free from the turbulence of crime and gang violence 
of his Santa Ana neighborhood. He began working for a computer repairman and 
wanted to move with his family to a safer neighborhood, but he could not escape 
his harsh surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
At 10:30 p.m. Friday, at a birthday party for a friend, the 17-year-old was 
shot to death, four times in the back, after a heated argument with suspected 
gang members, his family said. 
</P>
<P>
For police, it is another gang-related homicide. But for family and friends, it 
is a tragic end to dreams for a better life outside the grasp of inner-city 
gang brutality. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid had a tough life. He never had a chance," said Fred Miller, who hired 
Roger part time to help him repair personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very unselfish, very gentle and caring," Miller added. "But he had 
grown up in a mess (in Santa Ana). You got kids in gangs and kids not going to 
school and alcohol and drug abuse. He got caught up by it all." 
</P>
<P>
Roger's death was part of a night of gang-related violence in which three men 
were also attacked in an unrelated Anaheim stabbing incident, Anaheim police 
Sgt. Fred Roush said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the wounded men was airlifted to the Long Beach Memorial Medical Center. 
The others were taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange, an Orange County Fire 
Department spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
No suspects have been arrested in the knifings, Roush said, who had no 
information on the condition of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
In the fatal Santa Ana shooting, police concluded a night of investigation 
Saturday morning by arresting suspected gang members Rudy Padilla, 22; Javier 
Padilla, 20, and Frankie Castellon, 19. The suspects were served search 
warrants at two neighborhood homes, Santa Ana Police Sgt. Dick Faust said. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth suspect is at large, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police did not say whether Roger was also a gang member. Police did not release 
his name, but relatives, his employer and a former teacher spoke emotionally 
about the youth's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Roger had just returned home Friday night from his job when friends came over 
and invited him to the birthday party on the 1200 block of East 3rd Street, 
several blocks from his house, according to his mother. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't really want to go, but they persuaded him to go," his mother, 
Cristina Ochoa, said in Spanish. "He told me, 'I'll be back soon.' And I told 
him, 'Don't be late.' Those were our last words." 
</P>
<P>
Soon after Roger arrived at the party, he got into a fight with another person, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
A group left quickly but returned minutes later and opened fire on Roger, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The youth was rushed to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, where he was declared 
dead at 11:12 p.m., police said. 
</P>
<P>
Friends and family gathered at the Ochoa house Saturday to console the mother 
and his four sisters. His father is in Mexico, family members said. 
</P>
<P>
They described Roger as good-natured, humorous youth who had a streak of 
altruism. "He would see some poor people, and he would come home without his 
shirt because he gave it to them," said his sister, Veronica, 15. 
</P>
<P>
"He would give his tennies away" sometimes too, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mourners decried the gang violence that engulfed and killed Roger. "The 
senseless murder is never going to stop until we the people say something and 
take our streets back," said Yolanda Galdamez, his aunt. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so tired of gangs. You can't even sit out on your porch because you're 
afraid of getting shot. . . . The gangs control the streets." 
</P>
<P>
Family members said they do not think that Roger was ever a gang member. 
</P>
<P>
He first ran afoul of the law with drug problems in his early teens, said 
Richard Rohr, his teacher at Joplin Youth Center in Trabuco Canyon, a detention 
facility for youths. 
</P>
<P>
Roger was last in Joplin for a few months on a violation of probation codes and 
was released in December after taking a computer and math class, Rohr said. 
</P>
<P>
His experience at Joplin "was bittersweet," Rohr said, "because he wanted to do 
well, but he was torn between what he wanted to do and peer pressure. He had a 
tremendous aptitude for computers. . . . He was a role model." 
</P>
<P>
Upon being released from Joplin, he landed a part-time job in Rancho Santa 
Margarita by using his training from class, said Miller, his employer. 
</P>
<P>
"He was definitely a smart boy. He really knew the Apple computer," Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After working with Roger for four months, Miller gave the youth a key to his 
house and let him sleep over frequently. 
</P>
<P>
"He was like a part of the family," he said. "It's just hard for a kid like him 
to get out of what he was involved in. I would tell him, 'One of these days, 
you're going to get killed.' He would just shrug it off and say, 'I'm careful. 
I know what I'm doing.' "

ERIK MITCHELL RUNS AWAY FROM 200-METER FIELD

<P>
As he hunkered down into the starting blocks before the boys' 200-meter run at 
the Mt. San Antonio College Relays Saturday, Erik Mitchell found himself in the 
worst position. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, a senior at Los Alamitos High School, was stuck in the outside lane. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, he would not see his competition for at least the first 100 meters and 
therefore would have little to gauge his pace. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Mitchell left all his competitors behind in the final 80 
meters, running a personal-best time of 21.13 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, the Southern Section 2-A champion in the 200 two years ago at Mayfair 
before transferring to Los Alamitos last fall, was buoyed by a tail wind of 
more than six meters per second, far above the two m.p.s. allowable for 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Green of Long Beach Poly, Mark Noriega of Pasadena and Donovan Burks of 
L.A. Washington were among those left in Mitchell's wake. 
</P>
<P>
Green came closest, finishing second in 21.48. Noriega was third in 21.50 and 
Burks fourth in 21.70. 
</P>
<P>
"No, it didn't bother me at all," Mitchell said of running in the outside lane. 
"I just ran the whole race hard." 
</P>
<P>
He said he saw no one, but heard Green, running a few steps behind in Lane 4, 
just as he entered the straightaway. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Green and Noriega appeared poised to take the lead after 100 meters. 
But Mitchell seemed to shift into a gear the others couldn't match and rocketed 
away to win by five meters. 
</P>
<P>
"The 200 is my favorite race," said Mitchell, who eclipsed the fastest time in 
Orange County this season. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente's Tim Martin had run 21.69. Mitchell's previous best was 21.75 and 
he ran 21.3 last year. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 200, there's more time (to run)," he said. "It gives me more time to 
pick up speed." 
</P>
<P>
Less than two hours earlier, Mitchell faced Burks and Green in the 100, the 
weaker of his two sprint races. 
</P>
<P>
Burks, the state leader and undefeated at 100 meters this year, won in a 
wind-aided 10.60. Green was second in 10.67 with Mitchell third in 10.68, his 
fastest time this season and the top time among county runners in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's previous best this season, 10.71, also was wind-aided. 
</P>
<P>
"I was losing my form in the last 10 meters," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
While Mitchell was losing it, Burks moved away strongly in the final 20 meters 
for a decisive victory. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's time of 10.68 capped a brilliant week in which he ran 9.8 for 100 
yards in a dual meet against Loara Tuesday. He then improved to 9.7 against El 
Dorado Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Pendleton, the weight events coach at Los Alamitos' Empire League rival 
Esperanza, brought his stable of shotputters and discus throwers to Mt. SAC in 
search of the best competition the country has to offer. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Parlin, the county leader in the shotput and discus, Mike Burns and Mark 
Kinney give Esperanza the best depth in the Southern Section in the weight 
events. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Noon of Fallbrook, whose 73-5 3/4 throw is the best in the nation this 
year for a high school athlete, was a noteworthy absentee, however. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Noon, Brent's father and his coach, said he decided after his son's sub-par 
performance in a dual meet Thursday that Brent would be better off practicing 
Saturday than making a four-hour round-trip for six throws. 
</P>
<P>
With Noon a no-show, Parlin placed second in the shotput with a throw of 
59-1/4. Rene Bustamante of Schurr was the winner, throwing 60-1 1/2. Kinney was 
fifth with a mark of 55-1/4. Burns did not advance to the final. 
</P>
<P>
In the discus, Parlin finished sixth with a throw of 162-11. Greg Hodel of Don 
Lugo won with a throw of 185-1. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. SAC Notes 
</P>
<P>
Phouphet Singbandith of Magnolia won the triple jump for the second consecutive 
year. He jumped a wind-aided 50-0. Two weeks ago at the Arcadia Invitational, 
Singbandith jumped 51-1/4, the best mark in the country this year. . . . 
Katella's Kevin Carlson, who tied the county high jump record in a dual meet 
against Esperanza Thursday, finished third Saturday, jumping 6-6. Carlson's 
6-11 3/4 Thursday matched the county record set by Foothill's Doug Dreibelbis 
in 1983. . . . Adrian Brown of Huntington Beach ran 14.72 to take fifth in the 
110-meter hurdles. Greg Greene of Garey won in 14:37.

Coach Fred Almond wasn't feeling very confident as he and the Mission Viejo 
High School girls' track and field team arrived Saturday at Rancho Santiago 
College for the Orange County Championships. Two days before, Almond had 
watched three of his top athletes suffer significant injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Seniors Lisa Fager, Kristin Dunn and Allison Axtell -- the three keys to 
Mission Viejo's past success -- became question marks after Thursday's South 
Coast League dual meet at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
In that meet, Fager, a triple jumper, strained a quadriceps muscle; Dunn, a 
shotputter and discus thrower, suffered a slight tear in her shoulder, and 
Axtell, a long jumper and 400-meter runner, aggravated a tendon strain in her 
right knee. 
</P>
<P>
But coming into Saturday's meet, Almond said he was calm. 
</P>
<P>
"I released myself to the fates," he said. "But then halfway through the meet, 
I was trying to wish things (into reality) again." 
</P>
<P>
It must have been some powerful wishing. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo won the title for the third consecutive year, accumulating 87 
points. Woodbridge, the Diablos' chief county rival, was second with 74 points 
and Esperanza was third with 40. 
</P>
<P>
Fager, who at this meet last year set the county record in the triple jump at 
39 feet 11 1/2 inches, bettered that mark by nearly a foot, going 40-10. 
Although that mark cannot be considered a county record -- during that leap, 
the wind was measured at 2.08 meters per second, a bit over the 2.00 m.p.s. 
allowable for records -- it was a tremendous feat nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't even believe I went 40 feet," said Fager, who had marks of 38-6, 39-11 
1/2w and 39-8 1/4 before her final and winning leap. She was named field 
athlete of the meet. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt real good," Fager said. "After my first jump, I decided to keep going. 
My coach didn't want me to, but I went 39-11 1/2. We (had) made a deal that if 
I went over 39 on my second jump, I could keep going." 
</P>
<P>
Fager, who waited several moments at the end of the runway in hopes that the 
breeze would subside before her final attempt, said, "It still would have been 
a 40-foot jump. Maybe not a 40-10, but a 40-something." 
</P>
<P>
Brenda Robinson of Santa Ana Valley was second at 38-1 and Mission Viejo's 
Nikki Charette was third at 36-11 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn, whose goal Saturday was to output Santa Ana Valley's Joanna Alo, did just 
that, winning with a mark of 39-7. She also placed second in the discus to 
Estancia's Debbie Hargrove (133-4) with a toss of 121-7. 
</P>
<P>
"My shoulder hurts -- I'm not going to throw next Thursday (in Mission Viejo's 
dual meet against San Clemente)," Dunn said. "But I had to do it for the team 
today. There was no way I was going to let them down." 
</P>
<P>
Axtell, who outjumped Capistrano Valley's Sara Toomey by a half-inch to win the 
long jump at 17-11, also helped Mission Viejo by taking second in the 400. 
</P>
<P>
Another outstanding performance for the Diablos was turned in by sophomore 
Andrea Dean, who won the 100 (12.36, second best time in meet history), the 200 
(25.38w) and anchored both relays. 
</P>
<P>
But the sprinter of the meet award went to Woodbridge senior Kaci Keffer, who 
won the 400 in a personal-best 56.54, and the 300 hurdles in 44.14, which broke 
the meet record of 44.40 set in 1984 by Mary Anne Bullard of Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
In the distance events, Ocean View Coach Beth Chilcot predicted that Seahawk 
freshman Christie Engesser would win the 800 and 1,500 meters. Engesser came 
through, winning with times of 2:16.03 and 4:44.70, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Engesser won both by creeping up from the back of the pack in the early stages, 
then taking a commanding lead with a lap to go. Asked if it felt as easy as she 
made it look, Engesser, a former age-group competitor said, "No, it was hard. I 
haven't run in races where there's so many people in the front pack before." 
</P>
<P>
In the 3,000, Marta Pinto of Katella took off from the start in her customary 
sprint and never let anyone catch up to win in 10:12. 
</P>
<P>
Other top performances included that of Mater Dei's Melissa McDonald, who, 
having just overcome a season-long hamstring injury, improved her career best 
in the high jump by three inches to win in a meet record 5-10. La Quinta 
freshman Elinor Tolson won the 100-meter hurdles in 14.79 and was second to 
Dean in the 100 in 12.68. 
</P>
<P>
Another meet record was set in the final event, the 1,600 relay, as Esperanza 
ran a 3:55.13 to break the former mark of 3:56.29 set by Woodbridge in 1988. 
Woodbridge was second in 3:59.82 and Mission Viejo third in 4:03.60. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Almond, though, the meet's outcome was decided before that 
final event. 
</P>
<P>
"This was very tense because of those injuries," he said. "I wasn't giving you 
any baloney on that. The courage of these girls today was incredible. . . . I 
know how hard they had to dig down."

Not satisfied with victories in the 200- and 500-yard freestyle races Saturday, 
Mission Viejo junior Eric Diehl asked boys' swimming Coach Mike Pelton what it 
would take to overcome Poway and win the Mission Viejo Invitational at the 
Marguerite Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
It would take a winning effort in the final event, the 400-yard freestyle 
relay, Pelton replied. 
</P>
<P>
Diehl, who turned in an Orange County best of 4:30.32 in the 500, swam his leg 
of the relay in 46 seconds flat to lead the Diablos to the boys' championship 
with 412 points. Poway finished second in the meet with 393 points. The 
Diablos' time of 3:15.69 in the 400 relay easily outdistanced second-place 
Laguna Hills and third-place Poway. 
</P>
<P>
"That was three seconds faster than we'd done all year," Pelton said. "As good 
as Eric is, he was more concerned about the team. That says a lot about his 
internal makeup, his character." 
</P>
<P>
Diehl had to swim through grueling qualifying heats in the morning before the 
relay and was named the boys' swimmer of the meet. Mission Viejo also boasted 
the top girls' swimmer of the day, sophomore Katarina Triska, who won the 
100-yard butterfly and 200 individual medley to lead her teammates to the 
girls' championship with 447 points. Poway was second with 263 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really pleased with my performance," Diehl said. "I didn't think I'd 
swim that fast. The meet was a little long and I'm a little tired." 
</P>
<P>
Diehl just missed breaking the 200 free meet record -- 1:39.27 set in 1986 by 
Mission Viejo's Dan Jorgensen -- finishing in 1:39.74. His 500 time was a shade 
under Mission Viejo's David Louder's 4:29.15 meet record in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Triska, a 15-year-old Swedish national, won the 100 butterfly in 59.91 seconds 
and won the 200 IM with a mark of 2:13.07. Teammate Claudia Franco won the 100 
free (55.15) and 50 free (25.54). 
</P>
<P>
Tsukasa Kawabuchi scored double victories for Mission Viejo in the boys' 
division with a time of 48.28 in the 100 free and a 51.18 in the 100 butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
Shuichi Matsumoto of Laguna Hills won the boys' 200 IM in 1:56.8.

CANYON FALLS IN VOLLEYBALL QUARTERFINALS 
</P>

<P>
Canyon High surprised even itself by advancing to the quarterfinals of the 
third Volleyball Tournament of Champions at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion on Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon defeated El Toro, 15-8, in the first round of the playoffs and defeated 
Los Altos, 15-13, in a second-round match. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect to come this far at all," Canyon Coach Ardyce Masters said. "I 
was just hoping that we'd get out of our pool." 
</P>
<P>
Canyon lost to second-seeded Santa Barbara, 15-4, in the quarterfinals, but not 
before Eli Contreras had recorded 216 assists and Rick Phillips and Troy 
Aldrich added 48 and 47 kills, respectively, in 11 tournament games. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised we did this well," Contreras said. "But in the back of my 
mind, I knew that if we tried really hard, we could do it." 
</P>
<P>
Masters said it was the best Canyon has played this season. "We played against 
programs that have been around for eons. I'm very proud of the kids." 
</P>
<P>
In the second round, Canyon never trailed, leading by scores of 11-7 and 13-9. 
The Cowboys survived a scare when Los Altos tied the score, 13-13, but Aldrich 
had two kills to give Canyon the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the momentum from wining the first game carried over (against Los 
Altos)," Masters said. "They were really fueled up to play Santa Barbara." 
</P>
<P>
Three other Valley teams made it to the playoffs, but all lost in the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
Royal lost to Fresno Bullard, 15-3. Outside hitter Jeff Colton led the 
Highlanders with 37 kills in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Hambly (33 kills), Adam White (24 kills) and Travis Ferguson (106 
assists) also played key roles. 
</P>
<P>
Madera defeated Taft, 15-5, and Mission Viejo upset Crespi, 16-14. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Davis led Taft with 37 kills and Cody Hein had 28 assists in the 
tournament.

AFTER SOME ARM-TWISTING, L.B. TO ENTER RECYCLING AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When city leaders set out a decade ago to do something about the 360,000 tons 
of trash this town generates every year, they came up with a two-part plan: a 
recycling program environmentalists loved and a hulking incinerator they hated. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the incinerator sits less than half a mile from the sea, cremating an 
endless stream of household and commercial waste and converting the energy to 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
As for the recycling program that was supposed to accompany it? "There isn't 
any," environmental activist Virginia Siegel laments. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, as the country's environmental consciousness is raised on the 20th 
anniversary of Earth Day, the local reality is this: Recycling in Long Beach is 
about as convenient as parking in Manhattan, and the touted incinerator is 
beset by pollution problems. 
</P>
<P>
In a city of more than 400,000 people, there are just four places that recycle 
newspapers, four that recycle metal and two that recycle glass, other than 
redeemable bottles. Even then, some recyclers take metal cans but not 
newspaper, some take newspaper but not glass and others take certain types of 
glass but no metal. 
</P>
<P>
While cities from Arcadia to Irvine have already begun curbside pickup of 
household recyclables, Long Beach offers none. Residents scurry around town 
searching for a place to do an environmental good deed and redeem some cash. 
</P>
<P>
Even the city's newly hired recycling coordinator admits that he puts his 
sorted trash in an alley, "and someone mysteriously comes by in the middle of 
the night and picks it up." 
</P>
<P>
But after some powerful arm-twisting by the Legislature, which has forced all 
cities to reduce their garbage flow, Long Beach is entering the age of 
recycling. 
</P>
<P>
Recycling coordinator James Kuhl was hired by the city in October to organize a 
curbside program. He expects to have one working within a year. The program 
would require residents to sort their household trash -- which accounts for 60% 
of Long Beach's solid waste -- and leave it at the curb or in alleys for 
pickup. 
</P>
<P>
The city has begun holding workshops in each City Council district to ask 
residents how they would prefer to recycle and has sought the help of the Long 
Beach Area Chamber of Commerce to urge businesses to reduce and reuse waste 
that pours from the commercial sector -- 40% of the city's total, Kuhl says. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, City Hall is taking stock of itself, reviewing ways to reduce and 
recycle the mountains of office paper and cardboard that bureaucracy generates 
and to encourage such conservation habits as drinking from a ceramic mug rather 
than a plastic foam cup. 
</P>
<P>
The city is also considering a plan to make compost of a staggering 67 tons of 
lawn debris harvested daily from golf course and lawn clippings, tree trimmings 
and street sweeping -- none of which is now recycled, Kuhl says. 
</P>
<P>
"The city resists the idea of recycling and puts all its effort into the 
incinerator," said Frank Rodgers, spokesman for the Cal State Long Beach 
Associated Students Inc. Recycling Center. Founded 20 years ago by a student, 
it is the most comprehensive recycling center in town. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the residents of Long Beach want to recycle, but it's not 
convenient," he said. "If the city establishes a program to make it convenient, 
the people would participate." 
</P>
<P>
Under a recently passed state law, the city must do just that. With California 
approaching a trash crisis and landfills near capacity, the law requires that 
cities recycle 25% of what they throw away by 1995 and 50% by the year 2000 
(40% in the case of Long Beach, because it has an incinerator). 
</P>
<P>
Recent attempts by Long Beach officials to win exemption from state-mandated 
recycling failed, and for the first time in a decade, the issue is commanding 
the city's attention. 
</P>
<P>
But that is not the way it was envisioned a decade ago, when the Southeast 
Resource Recovery Facility incinerator was proposed to go hand-in-hand with 
recycling. 
</P>
<P>
The incinerator -- similar to other facilities run in other communities, 
including the City of Commerce -- was hardly resisted in Long Beach. The city 
promised to reuse what waste it could and burn the rest, sending a compact hunk 
of ash to the landfill instead of voluminous truckloads of garbage. 
</P>
<P>
In turn, the incinerator would produce electricity to be sold to Southern 
California Edison Co., earning money to repay the $170 million in bonds 
borrowed to build it. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1986, the facility was redesignated a "mass-burn incinerator" that had 
to import trash from Lakewood and Signal Hill to generate enough electricity to 
pay off the debt, and recycling took a back seat, said Siegel, a member of the 
city's Solid Waste and Recycling Advisory Committee and one of the city's most 
vocal recycling advocates. 
</P>
<P>
"The incinerator delayed a more sound environmental program like recycling," 
she said. "And by the time they have to meet recycling requirements in 10 
years, I'll be dead! I'll be compost!" 
</P>
<P>
Nearly two-thirds of the 360,000 tons of trash Long Beach throws away yearly is 
collected by the city. Virtually all of it is burned -- even what could be 
recycled, officials say. Recycling proponents want to see an intermediary 
sorting center where recyclable materials are separated from incinerator-bound 
trash. 
</P>
<P>
More extreme critics -- who have protested the plant with gas masks and picket 
signs -- have called for the incinerator to be shut down altogether, arguing 
that there is no place for a smoke-puffing plant in a basin that already has 
the nation's most polluted air. They contend that incinerator ash contains 
toxins that seep through landfills and into ground water. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District has yet to fully certify the 
incinerator, which has had problems controlling acid gases and other emissions 
considered hazardous to people and the environment, said Robert Pease, the 
district's engineering manager. 
</P>
<P>
Air-quality officials are awaiting an assessment next month of health risks 
before the incinerator can be fully certified as safe. The one submitted by the 
city several months ago, which concluded that health risks are minimal, was 
rejected by district officials, who say the study is invalid. 
</P>
<P>
The incinerator is snarled in a separate legal battle between the corporation 
that built it and the city, which refuses to sign off on the project because, 
it says, there are still repairs to be made. 
</P>
<P>
But there are no foes of the facility on the City Council, whose members have 
boasted about a "state-of-the-art" incinerator and have no apologies for what 
critics say are recycling sins. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a plant that is up and running," Councilman Ray Grabinski said. "You 
could be critical of the city and say it did more with (the plant) than with 
recycling, but you only have so many eggs to roll." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Les Robbins said that the plant "is part of recycling. We have 
something in this city that other cities don't have in dealing with trash: an 
incinerator. The ultimate goal is to recycle what can be recycled, and burn, 
rather than bury, the rest."

JON KLEIN: A -- 'BUZZ' ON MTV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sharon Bernstein 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine a video roller coaster ride through world events and culture. Imagine 
the news cut like a music video. That's "Buzz," a new half-hour program that 
MTV is banking on to help relieve its ratings slump and propel its image from 
Music Television (what MTV stands for) to terribly hip, program-oriented 
television. 
</P>
<P>
"Buzz," which premieres Sunday at 9 p.m., is a giddy montage of interviews, 
street scenes and cultural icons organized around a different theme each week. 
The show is made by MTV in England, where it also airs. Co-creator Jon Klein -- 
who himself could not say whether the program would intrigue viewers or simply 
make them dizzy -- 'talked about the show with Sharon Bernstein. 
</P>
<P>
What is "Buzz"? Is it a news show? 
</P>
<P>
It's not really meant to be categorizable in any traditional sense. There's a 
bit of news, there's a bit of art, there's a bit of current affairs, there's a 
bit of documentary to it. 
</P>
<P>
It's on Fridays in England and on Sundays on MTV in the States. It's a regular 
TV show. It's edited to be very fast-moving, but it's meant to be watched like 
a regular TV show. 
</P>
<P>
How is the show organized? Is there a plot? 
</P>
<P>
It's sort of thematic. The first U.S. show is about cultural stereotypes, so 
people talk a lot about racism or about sexism or about other forms of cultural 
stereotyping. 
</P>
<P>
It's kind of like meditations on a theme. There are different elements to it; 
it's through different people's eyes, through different stories, but it does 
stick to the theme fairly religiously. 
</P>
<P>
How do you get information? 
</P>
<P>
We set up bureaus all over the world. They're not really bureaus in a 
traditional sense, they're basically just kind of knowledgeable people, people 
who know what's happening in a city. We've got people in New York, Los Angeles, 
Paris, Tokyo, Germany, Ghana and Cairo. And these people just call us with 
information about what's happening. They read newspapers, they go to the 
movies, they go to the clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Does your sound track have songs in it? 
</P>
<P>
We're pretty free with (the sound track). We take all the sound off the 
interviews we do. We mix it with music both off videos and off records and old 
commercials and stock footage and make a kind of collage with it. 
</P>
<P>
The show is very sound driven, the sound is pretty important. We spend half our 
time in sound studios and half our time in video studios. 
</P>
<P>
And that's your way of staying in keeping with the "Music Television" aspect of 
it? 
</P>
<P>
I don't think it was that planned. But it just happens to be a real colorful 
rhythmic type of show, so we use a lot of music, we push the rhythm along, we 
cut to the beat. We do cut it very much like a music video. It's sort of like a 
music video with content. 
</P>
<P>
Would you describe one of the programs? 
</P>
<P>
In the show that we do about the future, we open with a segment where we talk 
to people from about 15 countries about what their concerns are for what's 
going to happen in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
We then go into a segment on "virtual reality," which is this artificial kind 
of reality where people can literally dive into a world which is created on 
their TV or on their computer, and they can interact with computer images. 
</P>
<P>
We've then got a piece on computer hackers, people who can break into your 
phone account and learn your credit history, who can break into government 
files and access sensitive documents, who have this ethic that they are the 
last bastion of goodness before a possible police state. 
</P>
<P>
And then at the end, there's a piece where we talk to kids who go to the United 
Nations school, kids from all backgrounds, and we ask them about the future. 
</P>
<P>
Do you think it's too much of a kaleidoscope for people to be able to watch for 
a half-hour? 
</P>
<P>
We have no idea. I mean, our friends think it's great. 
</P>
<P>
This show is meant to be understood and to be watched. We don't want it to go 
over people's heads or be too up in the air about things. The intention is to 
communicate. We just hope that people give it a chance as it wings its way into 
their sitting rooms, their living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"Buzz" really doesn't want to be confusing or nebulous. Sometimes the fact that 
it's such a new format and looks so different can confuse people initially, but 
it's not something where we're trying to be obtuse. It's just a new format that 
may take people a few minutes or maybe a couple of shows to get used to. 
</P>
<P>
What does MTV hope to get out of this show? 
</P>
<P>
I think there are only so many music videos you can watch and MTV definitely 
realizes that, and it's going much more show-oriented. "Buzz" is sort of a 
bulwark of that phase in MTV's history. 
</P>
<P>
What kind of a commitment has MTV made to the show? 
</P>
<P>
We're taping the first 13 now, and we're starting in July with the next 13. We 
assume it will be 26 shows, and then we'll see what happens. It should 
definitely establish itself as a hit or a miss by then. 
</P>
<P>
What age group are you looking for? 
</P>
<P>
I would say it's for people who are 14 to 35, but I'm not sure. I don't know 
many people who are under 14, and I'm not sure if people in the older age group 
would like it. It's for people who grew up with television. 
</P>
<P>
Does the show have a point of view? 
</P>
<P>
We're trying to show a side (of life) that isn't usually portrayed on TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
We aren't really taking any particular political stands or waving anyone's 
flag. I think if anything, we're asking people to doubt the flag wavers, to 
doubt the things that will only tell you what to do and what to think, to doubt 
advertisers, to doubt TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes if you're watching a news show, the newscaster can be saying 
something which sounds very straightforward but is actually a very subtle way 
of making you believe one thing or another. You hear things in ads where things 
are presented in one way, and it's really for the convenience of selling that 
product, so "Buzz" sometimes mocks this kind of corporate slickness in certain 
advertisements and certain TV shows and says this kind of TV show can be a bit 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
So "Buzz" looks like a TV show that's a bit dangerous sometimes, because it's 
trying to point out that TV can be a bit dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
What is your vision about what this program will do for the people who watch 
it? 
</P>
<P>
We hope it makes them think or wake up a bit. This is not television that is 
meant to be relaxing or is meant to coddle you. This is television that sticks 
its hand out of the TV set and shakes you a bit.

ANOTHER SPRING, ANOTHER NEW FOOTBALL JOB FOR SDSU'S MAXEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now, Larry Maxey wasn't complaining, although he might have had a right to. He 
was walking across the courtyard of the Aztec Athletic Center at San Diego 
State one day earlier this week, talking about learning a new position in 
spring football. It's a yearly occurrence for him, like homecoming and 
registering for classes. 
</P>
<P>
"No telling what I'll be next year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He was joking -- sort of. 
</P>
<P>
Maxey came to SDSU as a running back when Denny Stolz was still coach and 
redshirted in 1988, his first year. Then Al Luginbill took over, and Maxey 
spent last spring learning to play strong safety. This spring? It's back to 
offense, where Maxey is learning the nuances of H-back, a receiver in the 
Aztecs' one-back alignment. 
</P>
<P>
You really wouldn't blame him if he were bitter. This is the guy's third 
position, and he has used only one year of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
You really wouldn't blame him if he felt sorry for himself. He didn't ask for a 
new coach who would change his position. 
</P>
<P>
You really wouldn't blame him if he felt, well . . . 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I felt dogged out, basically," he said. "But I thought about it and 
thought it was a compliment to my athletic ability that he asked me to play 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
"It turned out better for me because I did play quite a bit. Playing, period, 
helped me to understand the intensity it takes to play at this level. But I 
would have never let Coach Luginbill know I wasn't happy. I'm a team player. No 
way was I going to say no. After I got out there, it was fine." 
</P>
<P>
Like most of his teammates, Maxey had always been a star. On the playgrounds, 
in high school, for as long as anyone can remember. Put a football in his arms 
and gang way. 
</P>
<P>
He was the offensive player of the year in the Eastern League at Morse High in 
1987, rushing for more than 1,300 yards. He led San Diego County in punt 
returns and decided to play football at SDSU. 
</P>
<P>
The honors didn't stop coming despite his redshirt year. Sure, he was in street 
clothes on game days, but you should have seen him on the practice field. He 
was picked as scout team offensive player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
But Luginbill came along and took one look at the roster as he was preparing 
for his first spring practice last year, and his eyes widened in horror. He 
decided he had to do something, anything, to improve the defensive backfield. 
One of the things he decided to do was move Maxey to defense. Damage control, 
basically. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a natural offensive player," Luginbill said. "Larry really helped our 
football team last year. He sacrificed some personal things for the betterment 
of the team. That's what makes him a great person to be around." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't easy. Maxey started the second game, against UCLA, and was a fixture 
in the lineup for the next seven weeks. The Aztecs were having their best 
season since their Holiday Bowl year of 1986, but at times, you could find more 
open space in the defensive backfield than in Balboa Park. Then, on Nov. 4, 
Terance Mathis and his New Mexico teammates paid a visit. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the part of his media guide biography that read, "If Terance passes 
a couple of classes this summer, he'll be eligible for his senior season," 
Mathis had some impressive credentials. On that Saturday night against SDSU, 
Mathis caught six passes for 147 yards and one touchdown. Much of Mathis' work 
was done in areas of the field for which Maxey was responsible. 
</P>
<P>
"In that game, I felt helpless," Maxey said. "He destroyed my confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Maxey was benched for the second half and didn't play the next week against 
Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
His high school coach, John Shacklett, was at the New Mexico game. 
</P>
<P>
"Why didn't you play in the second half?" Shacklett wondered. 
</P>
<P>
His parents attend every SDSU home game. 
</P>
<P>
"Why aren't you playing?" his mother wondered. 
</P>
<P>
When Maxey watched the films, his eyes hurt from what he saw. When he got home, 
his ears burned from the questions. How do you explain embarrassment? 
</P>
<P>
On the Monday after the Wyoming game, Ron Mims, defensive backfield coach, told 
Maxey that the team needed more production at strong safety. Whoever had the 
best week of practice -- he or David Cooper -- would start. 
</P>
<P>
"After Coach Mims talked with me, I realized what they were trying to do to 
me," Maxey said. "When somebody feels too comfortable . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The coaches got Maxey's attention. By the end of the week, Maxey was told he 
would start at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
He finished the year with 76 tackles but broke up just one pass and had just 
one interception. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a difficult time for him because we were asking things that weren't 
natural for him," Luginbill said. "He's never had to play the game on anything 
other than natural instincts. He wasn't making some plays maybe he should have 
been making." 
</P>
<P>
Said Maxey: "I didn't get the picks (interceptions) most safeties do, but I had 
a lot of tackles. By the end of the last game, I had a feel for it -- I knew if 
I stayed there I'd eventually become a pretty good safety and have a lot better 
year this year." 
</P>
<P>
Heh, heh, heh. At the end of the season, he met again with Luginbill. He was 
being shifted back to offense. 
</P>
<P>
You got it. The guy who wanted to play offense had begun to enjoy defense. 
</P>
<P>
"When he mentioned it to me, I was kind of reluctant," Maxey said. "I was used 
to defense, and I didn't want to have to fight for the a position and learn all 
over again." 
</P>
<P>
So he is back on the field, in the spring, learning a new position. And, yes, 
he is happy about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I love offense, and I'm glad to be back," he said. "I think I can help the 
team more on offense than I could on defense." 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Raye and Mert Harris are Maxey's biggest competition at H-back. Raye was 
third on the team in receiving last season and, unless something strange 
happens, will be the starter this fall. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm playing well enough to play, and I'm not concerned with depth 
charts," Maxey said. "The way we run things, we all go in and out. I'm 
certainly not afraid of not playing. I know I'll be on the field doing 
something. I think I've picked things up better than the coaches expected." 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Johnson, SDSU receivers coach, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think he'd be as good as he is," Johnson said. "If there were a game 
tomorrow, he'd be in there playing." 
</P>
<P>
One of Maxey's biggest problems this spring, he said, has been dropped passes. 
At times, he has been so worried about where he was supposed to be that he had 
a tendency to take his eye off the ball. Besides, making a catch with a 
defender practically on top of you is a little different from catching the ball 
in the backfield and having some room to work. 
</P>
<P>
The worst times are when he is trying to recognize what scheme the defense is 
in. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're on the line, you're looking at the quarterback," Maxey said. "On 
the snap, you've got to turn and look at the defense and say, 'Is he playing me 
zone? Is he playing me man?' I think that's the hardest thing to do, recognize 
coverages." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, having played defense for a season has given Maxey somewhat of an 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing defense helped me to realize what they're playing," Maxey said. "I 
think that's the hardest thing to do -- recognize and try to read coverages and 
know what people are trying to do to you." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, aside from an on-the-field education, Maxey picked up a valuable 
off-the-field lesson during the past year that he hopes will help him this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never get to the point where I doubt my ability," Maxey said. "It was a 
major learning experience for me. Doubting myself didn't help myself or the 
team. I learned that great receivers drop balls, great running backs fumble and 
great safeties miss tackles. It's a matter of coming back the next day and 
doing it right."

COMEDIAN CLEANS UP HIS ACT AS A CLOWN; 
</P>

ENTERTAINMENT: A PRINTER BY TRADE, HE GIVES UP X-RATED ACT FOR THE PERSONA OF A 
HOBO CLOWN, MAKING CHILDREN LAUGH WITH HIS MAGIC TRICKS.

Robert Nebel, 51, happily believes he has a split personality. 
</P>
<P>
Once, for instance, he walked around dressed as a parrot to advertise an 
Anaheim nightclub called Crackers. On weekend nights he worked there as an 
X-rated stand-up comedian. 
</P>
<P>
His risque act made even hardy audiences wince, so he assumed another persona: 
Garbi the Hobo Clown, who specializes in children's birthday parties. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a different person in my day-to-day ordinary life," said Nebel, who lives 
in Anaheim and has a night job at a printing company in Commerce. "The guys 
would ask me to tell jokes, but I told them I don't mix the two jobs." 
</P>
<P>
It is a different story when Nebel puts on his hobo clown costume and makes 
kids giggle, often using magic to make doves and rabbits appear and disappear. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm out there to make people happy," said Nebel, an Air Force veteran who has 
spent much of his life as a drive-in theater manager. 
</P>
<P>
His entrance into show business came eight years ago, when "an agent friend of 
mine was looking for a monthlong clown act in Japan and I said I could do it, 
so I put together the hobo clown outfit." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the Japanese were not interested in that kind of clown. 
</P>
<P>
But, said Nebel, "since I invested a lot of time and money on the hobo 
character, I started doing it on my own. 
</P>
<P>
"It became a great source of happiness for me. Once a little girl came up, put 
her arms around me and said, 'Mr. Clown, that was so nice.' I'll never forget 
that moment." 
</P>
<P>
As a young man, he said, "the three things I wanted most in life was my own 
home, a nice car and a family." He has the house and car, "but my marriage 
didn't work out, and I never had a family." 
</P>
<P>
But he has clowning and magic to make him happy. "I enjoy it, and it helps me 
carry on my life." 
</P>
<P>
Nebel is a member of the Magic Castle in Hollywood and, he says, "one of these 
days I'm going to be a performer there." 
</P>
<P>
However, he already has something like it at his home in Anaheim. One room is 
decorated with photographs of hobo clowns, a pool table and a make-believe 
electric chair from a film studio. 
</P>
<P>
"They said it was used in the movie 'Bird Man of Alcatraz,' " Nebel said. It 
makes an electrical buzzing sound when someone sits in it. "It gets people's 
attention," he said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Nebel managed to get work at many of the clubs and bars in Orange County during 
his stand-up phase, but he contends that he became a clown to get away from the 
"filth of on-stage entertainment." "If I was going to be an entertainer," he 
said, "I didn't want to be known as a dirty comic." 
</P>
<P>
As for what he is doing now, he said: "I don't think I can go much farther in 
this kind of life. I'm getting up there in age. I'm sort of looking forward to 
retiring in Hawaii." 
</P>
<P>
According to Nebel, that may not be far away: "My life seems to be whizzing by. 
Seems like I was 30 last week."

HITTING AGAINST THE WIND; 
</P>
<P>
TOROS' DARRELL CONNER POSTED RECORD STREAK IN UNFRIENDLY PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As his Cal State Dominguez Hills teammates took turns in the batting cage 
before Thursday afternoon's game with visiting Cal State Los Angeles, Darrell 
Conner toiled behind the Toro baseball dugout at a batting tee. In the distance 
the clinks of aluminum bats hitting rawhide baseballs could be heard as the 
overcast gave way to hazy sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
On the Carson field, which is not kind to hitters, Conner had long since taken 
his practice swings in the cage. Now he stood in front of a giant net and swung 
his black aluminum bat at tennis ball after tennis ball. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't ever get enough hitting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As the contact-hitting junior first baseman almost always does, he had arrived 
early to get a little more practice. The tee, he said, "helps me get loose." It 
is one of many devices, including vision training, that were instrumental in 
his school-record, 19-game hitting streak earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm seeing the ball real well," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Conner's batting average, which has hovered around the .375 mark all season, is 
exceptional for a hitter in this wind-whipped park, where right-handed batters 
also fight the late-afternoon sun as it sinks into their eyes behind center 
field. 
</P>
<P>
"If Darrell played somewhere else, I would say he might be hitting .430 or 
.450," said Toro Coach George Wing. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-3 Conner, who has hit only five home runs in his collegiate career, 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a different kind of park. It's not a hitter's dream. It's a pitcher's 
dream," he said. "I've hit balls in the gaps that I thought would get in, and 
they didn't. You can't do too much in this park." 
</P>
<P>
What does a line-drive hitter like Conner, who has struck out less than once in 
each 10 at-bats, miss most when he plays here? 
</P>
<P>
"Dongs," he said. "A few more dongs (home runs)." 
</P>
<P>
Conner has just two home runs this year, but he is closing in on the school 
record for most doubles in a single season. 
</P>
<P>
Hitting, by itself, not just on the Toro field, "is the toughest thing to do," 
Conner said. 
</P>
<P>
"You face a different guy each day. Each throws the ball differently. Some of 
them have balls that move; others throw more straight. Another guy will have a 
better deuce (curve ball)." 
</P>
<P>
A native of Riverside, Conner transferred to Dominguez Hills from Orange Coast 
College in Costa Mesa not because he loved the playing facilities, but because 
he fell in love with the program and the social climate at the university. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, he was heavily recruited by UC Riverside, currently in a three-way 
race for the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. title. Dominguez Hills, on 
the other hand, entered this weekend's three-game set with Cal State Los 
Angeles with a disappointing 13-19-2 mark and is likely to finish with the 
school's third consecutive losing record. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Conner insists he made the right choice. 
</P>
<P>
"This was definitely the place to go for me," he said. "I could have gone to UC 
Riverside and been playing for a championship. But I like it here. I have a lot 
of confidence here." 
</P>
<P>
This has been a frustrating season for Wing, the Toros' second-year coach, who 
once was an assistant at Riverside. When the year began, he thought he had a 
team, stacked with junior college transfers such as Conner, that would 
challenge for the CCAA title. But entering the Cal State L.A. series, the Toros 
were in a tailspin, having lost 10 straight conference games. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a matter of no consistency on this team," Conner said. "You hear a 
lot about our lack of pitching, but the fact is, when the pitchers went out and 
did well, the hitting let this team down." 
</P>
<P>
Conner's record-setting performance, which ended a week ago when he lined out 
three times at Cal State Northridge, has stood out despite the losing streak, 
Wing said. The streak might have been even longer had Conner not missed four 
games with a chipped bone in his left wrist, sustained in a rundown in a game 
against Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still not quite there yet," Conner said of his recovery, which included a 
week wearing a cast. "Before the injury, I felt like no pitcher could get me 
out. Now I miss some (pitches)." 
</P>
<P>
Wing said Conner has still been a force at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest, he's only half what he was before," the coach said. "He may not 
be driving the ball like he was, but he still hits the ball with pop to all 
fields." 
</P>
<P>
Wing has been a bit irritated lately by some of the things he has read and 
heard about his team's performance. 
</P>
<P>
"Darrell's performance has been overlooked and neglected," Wing said. 
"Everybody -- the media, fans, and everyone else -- has harped on our won-loss 
record. We have not won on a consistent basis, and because of that he has been 
overlooked." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the rest of the team, Conner has been consistent. 
</P>
<P>
"What I like about Darrell is his stable personality," Wing said. "He is 
consistent in everything he does. He comes to practice with the same attitude 
that he comes to play with." 
</P>
<P>
Added assistant coach Eric Mihkelson, who calls the offensive signals for the 
Toros: "He has such good work habits. I wish I had a lot more players like 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Conner was an outfielder at Orange Coast and at Riverside Poly High School, 
where he was named most valuable player in the Citrus Belt League three 
consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
Wing recruited him to play first base because he thought Conner was too slow to 
be a college outfielder. In addition, the Toros were well fixed in the 
outfield. 
</P>
<P>
Conner didn't mind the switch, but during winter ball the Toros lost their 
projected third baseman when he quit following a run-in with Wing. Conner moved 
across the diamond to third as the season began, but he never got comfortable 
there. After about a dozen starts at the corner, and nine errors, it became 
clear to both Conner and Wing that the switch wasn't working. 
</P>
<P>
"I would get my hits and my runs batted in, but then I was giving up a lot of 
runs at third base," Conner said. 
</P>
<P>
Since moving to first base, Conner has committed only two errors. 
</P>
<P>
As for the team's poor showing, Conner isn't defensive. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating to all of us," he said. "Every guy out there is busting his 
butt to win." 
</P>
<P>
Conner would like to play in the Cape Cod League this summer, where aluminum 
bats are forbidden. The clinks, then, would be replaced by cracks of bat on 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
A hit is a hit to Conner, no matter what the sound.

In the 1987 China Girl (KCOP, Tuesday at 8 p.m.), director Abel Ferrara has 
created one of his potent ultra-violent, ultra-stylish Manhattan street fables. 
</P>
<P>
This time, it's a Romeo (Richard Panebianco) and Juliet (Sari Chang) tale set 
in the Lower East Side's cheek-by-jowl Little Italy and Chinatown. Not for 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
As if New York didn't already have enough to contend with, C.H.U.D. (KCAL, 
Saturday at 8 p.m.), a routine 1984 social protest/horror picture, finds the 
city's derelict population turned into hideous-looking ghouls through 
contamination with radioactive waste. John Heard and Daniel Stern star.

Photo, The 1986 summer hit "Back to School" (KCOP, Friday at 8 p.m.) is a big 
belly laugh of a comedy that casts Rodney Dangerfield, left, as a college 
freshman. Robert Downey Jr., center, and Keith Gordon co-star.

MUTUAL FUNDS / WERNER RENBERG: A WAY TO MATCH THE MARKET -- AND MAYBE TOP IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WERNER RENBERG, WERNER RENBERG is co-author of Making Money With Mutual 
Funds and author of a forthcoming book, The Bond Fund Advisor. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Few goals are dearer to mutual fund managers -- and those who invest their 
money with them -- than "beating the market." Few goals are more elusive. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of funds have not only failed to beat the market in recent years, they've 
fallen behind it. Some have even lost money during a bull market. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, some funds no longer rely primarily on professional managers to 
pick their stock investments. Instead, they've turned to mathematical formulas 
that are intended to match the performance of a particular market (U.S., 
international, over-the-counter, etc.) -- and maybe even beat it. 
</P>
<P>
Now, two of the nation's biggest mutual fund companies are introducing new, 
broad-based "index funds" for individual investors. 
</P>
<P>
When fund managers and investors speak of "beating the market," they usually 
refer to outperforming the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock price index. 
Sometimes, however, they may be talking about other indexes -- well-known or 
obscure -- that track different groups of U.S. stocks, bonds or foreign 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the stock prices of 500 large corporations, the S&amp;P 500 index 
represents about 75% of the total value of all common stocks traded on the New 
York Stock Exchange -- and therefore has become the most widely used benchmark 
for evaluating portfolio performance. 
</P>
<P>
In the five years ended March 31, only 84 mutual funds outperformed the S&amp;P 
500's 17.5% compounded average annual total return, according to Lipper 
Analytical Services. This has persuaded many investors to invest at least some 
of their money in mutual funds that are structured to match the S&amp;P 500's 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
Managing stock portfolios to match this index has been popular with those who 
manage pension plan assets since passage of the Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Enacted in a year when the index's total return 
was a negative 26.5%, ERISA included a requirement that pension fund managers 
diversify assets "to minimize the risk of large losses." By linking portfolios 
to such a broad-based index as the S&amp;P 500, managers could invest in stocks 
while complying with the need to act prudently. 
</P>
<P>
Vanguard offered shares in the first index-linked fund in August, 1976. Now 
known as the Vanguard Index Trust 500 Portfolio, it gave individual investors a 
vehicle enabling them to do about as well -- or as poorly -- as the broad 
market. 
</P>
<P>
The concept was simple, even if implementation wasn't. The fund would buy 
shares of all 500 companies in the same proportions that they are represented 
in the index, which is weighted to reflect the total market values of their 
shares. As investors buy or redeem shares in the fund, the fund buys or sells 
shares in a way that preserves the relative weights. As Standard &amp; Poor's 
adjusts the index to reflect mergers and other corporate changes, holdings are 
added or eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
For about a decade, Vanguard had the individual investors' S&amp;P 500 index 
fund field to itself. Beginning in 1986, a few other sponsors, such as Colonial 
Management Associates and Boston Co., came into the picture, but their growth 
was modest. (Wells Fargo, a leading manager of index-linked assets, created a 
fund for its customers' IRA accounts in 1984.) Others stayed out. A Fidelity 
spokesman in 1987 scoffed at the idea, saying it "guaranteed long-term 
mediocrity." 
</P>
<P>
No more. This week, Fidelity begins selling shares in Spartan Market Index and 
Dreyfus is introducing its Peoples Index Fund. (They had followed SEI Financial 
Management Corp. in offering S&amp;P 500 index funds for institutions.) 
</P>
<P>
"We're responding to customer demand," said Anne Detmer, marketing manager for 
Fidelity's growth and income funds, to explain the firm's turnabout. 
</P>
<P>
Fidelity, as well as Dreyfus, also may have noted the explosive assets recently 
passed $2 billion. They were not discouraged by the decision of the Boston Co. 
(TBC) to liquidate all of its index funds. (Explained Ken Melanson, president 
of TBC Funds Distributor: "Our clients chose not to use them -- they prefer 
active management.") 
</P>
<P>
All will be trying to equal the S&amp;P 500's performance. Adroit portfolio 
management can bring them close but probably will leave a small gap for two 
reasons: Unlike a managed index, funds incur costs; to accommodate redemptions, 
they also hold small amounts of cash which, except in a down market, can drag 
down performance. 
</P>
<P>
Their competition will be aimed at reducing the gap -- and enhancing returns 
for shareholders -- by minimizing annual operating expenses and transaction 
costs. Vanguard, a low-cost operator across the board, has held the 500 
Portfolio's annual expenses down to 0.22% of average net assets. To attract 
investors, Dreyfus and its investment adviser, Wells Fargo Nikko, are 
temporarily absorbing annual expenses while Fidelity is temporarily reducing 
fees to 0.28%. 
</P>
<P>
Funds have several ways to hold down the costs of buying and selling 
securities, of which the easiest may be to limit excessive switching by their 
shareholders. George U. Sauter, the Vanguard fund's portfolio manager, 
minimizes transaction costs by minimizing transactions. Unless the market is 
unusually volatile, he waits every day until about 3 p.m. to see whether he'll 
have a net cash inflow or outflow, then buys or sells accordingly. He also uses 
futures contracts to remain fully invested while saving cash for redemptions. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the competition to provide investors index-linked mutual funds isn't 
limited to S&amp;P 500 funds, as the accompanying table shows. Over the years, 
others have evolved -- some linked to indexes developed by firms affiliated 
with the funds -- with the objective of providing higher-than-500 returns or 
adding diversification to investors' portfolios. They include: 
</P>
<P>
* S&amp;P 500-related funds, such as those which invest equally in all 500 
stocks (Dean Witter), give more weight to better performers (Vanguard 
Quantitative Portfolios) and concentrate in the companies represented in the 
S&amp;P 100 (Principal Preservation). 
</P>
<P>
* Funds investing in companies of small and medium capitalization, which may 
use indexes such as the Wilshire 4,500 (Vanguard Extended Market) and Russell 
2,000 (Vanguard Small Capitalization). 
</P>
<P>
* Sector funds that match gold stock indexes (Benham and Rushmore), an index of 
natural gas distribution and transmission companies (American Gas Index), and a 
regional company index (Composite Northwest 50). 
</P>
<P>
* International equity funds linked to the Morgan Stanley Europe, Australia, 
Far East Index, known as EAFE (Colonial International Equity) and to EAFE's 
European and Pacific sectors (portfolios to be offered by Vanguard on May 1). 
</P>
<P>
* Bond index funds matching the Salomon Bros. Broad Investment Grade Bond 
Index. 
</P>
<P>
If a fund linked to one of these indexes attracts you, there are at least two 
points to remember: Because such funds are fully invested, they will be more 
volatile than conservative funds. Because they are volatile, you should 
consider them for only a portion of your assets and be prepared to stay with 
your choice for a few years. With such funds committed to putting all their 
cash into the market, Boston Co.'s Melanson points out: "There's no way an 
index can protect you when the market is going down."

WINLESS BRAYTON SEES VICTORY AS JUST BEYOND EVERY HORIZON; 
</P>
<P>
INDY CARS: A NEW TEAM AND OPPORTUNITY TO RUN THE COMPLETE CART SERIES MAKES 
31-YEAR-OLD OPTIMISTIC THAT HE'S GETTING CLOSER TO HIS GOAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Scott Brayton has driven Indy cars for 10 years and has yet to win a race. Nor 
is there any strong indication that he will sometime soon. 
</P>
<P>
He is not among the favorites in today's Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach, and 
if he would, by some strange quirk of fate, happen to win, the accomplishment 
would be hailed as the upset of the season, maybe the decade. 
</P>
<P>
So is Brayton some down-in-the-mouth guy, mad at the world for mistreating him? 
</P>
<P>
Hardly. He sees himself as a still-young man -- he's 31 -- improving in a field 
dominated by elite practitioners. And if he doesn't win today's race, or next 
month's Indy 500 or some other race this season or next, well, there will be 
others. And at least one of them, maybe more, will have his name on it. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he likes what he's doing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very involved in business, and I love business, and I have felt like there 
are times when I can make this much money elsewhere, and it would seem a little 
more attainable," he said Saturday. "I get so frustrated with it. 
</P>
<P>
"But then, when you begin to look over the fence and you know that you're here 
because you love to go fast, there isn't a streetcar in the world that offers 
you this kind of ride. 
</P>
<P>
"I love speed. I love getting in fast cars and standing on the gas. That's why 
I do it. And then I feel, deep down in my heart, that if I work at it long 
enough, I'm going to achieve (victory) because I've never quit at anything I 
really wanted. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, there may come a day that I walk away, as several others have in Indy car 
racing, winless, but I don't plan on being one of that number." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Brayton figures he has never had it so good. He is the lead driver on 
Dick Simon's team this year, up from No. 2. He is coming off a season in which 
he won $451,317 and finished sixth at Indianapolis and 10th at the Meadowlands 
in East Rutherford, N.J., and at Nazareth, Pa. And he is working at racing full 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"Without consistency, you don't have the shot," he said. "Four of (his 10 
seasons) I've only run five (or six) races. The other years were never full 
seasons. This is the first time in my career that I've had two back-to-back 
years of racing in CART. For instance, this is the first time I've come back to 
Long Beach, having run here last year. 
</P>
<P>
"That's very important. Baseball players who only play half the games generally 
aren't the best, and golfers that go to half the (tournaments) generally don't 
win the championship. You've got to get the momentum going for you . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Now I feel that we're getting closer every day." 
</P>
<P>
Brayton felt particularly encouraged by his performance in the final qualifying 
session Saturday. He moved up five spots in the lineup, to eighth, and, 
although his new Lola is powered by a Cosworth engine, not one of the hot 
Chevrolets, it was faster than the Chevy-powered rigs of Bobby Rahal, Eddie 
Cheever, Arie Luyendyk and A.J. Foyt. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the fastest I've ever gone here by over two seconds in qualifying, and I 
feel real positive about the race," he said. "In this last session, we started 
to get a handle on the car. We had a difficult time in Phoenix (in the season 
opener). We were so excited about doing well, and it kind of went out the 
window." 
</P>
<P>
At Phoenix, Brayton's crew had problems setting up the car properly and he 
qualified 10th and finished 13th. His handling problems were compounded by an 
unscheduled trip to the pits when he was black-flagged after track observers 
noticed smoke coming from his car's engine, often the sign of an oil leak. 
</P>
<P>
There was no leak, and CART officials determined that the smoke was coming from 
a protective layer of asphalt over the left rear suspension. 
</P>
<P>
That sort of thing happens in racing, and, unfortunately for Brayton, it 
frequently happens to him. Cheerfully, he goes on. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like (today) is the day that if we can come out, be consistent and run 
strong all day long, we're going to achieve the goal that I had going into this 
weekend," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you took just hard, cold facts, a lot of things that happen in the world 
wouldn't happen. When the first guy went to the moon, nobody really thought we 
could get there and walk on it. And when he did it, 'Oh, my God, let's go to 
Mars!' 
</P>
<P>
"I've set a track record and I've sat in the front row at Indy (in 1985 when he 
qualified second). I've led races. I have never won. And so I feel personally, 
when the combination is right and we can consistently run fast, we're going to 
be very competitive. And once we're there, we've got a shot at winning. 
</P>
<P>
"On the outside, that looks lots harder to attain than on the inside. For 
instance, who would have thought that Al Unser would have won the (Indianapolis 
500) in '87 and become a four-time winner?" 
</P>
<P>
Who, indeed? The senior Unser was being given sort of a courtesy ride that year 
in Roger Penske's third car in that race. 
</P>
<P>
So, with that sort of thing to remind him that he can win at this level, 
Brayton expects the best every day. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll guarantee you one thing, we're closer than we've ever been," he said. 
"How close that is, I don't know. But I know I'm going to win. It's in me."

PSYCHOANALYST'S MIND FOCUSES ON PATIENTS WHILE HIS HANDS CARVE INTRICATE 
ARTWORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sitting in the office of his Birdrock home, veteran psychoanalyst Erwin Angres 
held the polished apple, turning it slowly, silently considering its shiny 
contours. 
</P>
<P>
Then, using a small paring knife, he deftly cut several thin circles of golden 
peelings. The doctor talked about past patients and their deep-seated problems 
as the artist's hands delved deeper, slowly revealing in the apple the face of 
a Slavic woman. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, she was clearly there -- the remaining apple peel becoming a 
scarf about her head, the stem darkening her eyes. After a few days of drying 
and a coat of varnish, the shrunken figure would join Angres' thousands of 
artworks -- many of which have been created as he consulted with patients in 
his book-filled office. 
</P>
<P>
For more than four decades, the German native has engaged in the unlikely 
combination of art and psychoanalysis -- often at the same time. As his 
patients reveal the hidden quirks of their own personalities, Angres often 
works to expose the aesthetic secrets of an apple, a polished stone or a piece 
of driftwood. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1950s, Angres said, his artwork made him one of the first 
psychiatrists to deviate from Freud's theory that psychoanalysis must be 
conducted in a setting devoid of personality, for fear of impeding progress 
with the patient. 
</P>
<P>
Around Chicago, he soon earned nicknames: the Apple Doctor and, because of the 
drying process of his apple art, the Original Shrink. 
</P>
<P>
Since moving to La Jolla 13 years ago, he has spent countless hours consulting 
Midwestern patients over the telephone, his mind concentrating on their 
innermost thoughts as his hands work on a new creation. 
</P>
<P>
All around him sit his life's work. Not only apple art but intricate figures 
made of bananas, grapefruit rinds, bricks, seashells -- even plastic foam. 
</P>
<P>
Like satisfied patients, solved challenges, they're strewn about his home 
office and downtown La Jolla studio, perched on shelves beside books with 
titles such as "Emotional Problems of Early Childhood" and "The Erotic Arts." 
</P>
<P>
Bearing themes from the Bible and Greek mythology, most of Angres' creations 
possess multiple personalities. Viewed one way, the shard of oak rescued from a 
friend's woodpile shows a man's face and tells a story. Turn it around and 
there's a different man telling another tale. 
</P>
<P>
But it is the apple creations -- his renaissance of an Indian art form -- that 
have given Angres notoriety. They're grinning heads straight out of man's 
unconscious -- bitter faces, kings, clowns, sad old men from another century. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have the patient in mind when I create," Angres said in his accented 
voice. "It is something behind the patient, perhaps, but not the patient. 
</P>
<P>
"And I don't do it behind their back. It's to help me concentrate. In 
psychoanalysis, when you are listening, if your hands and eyes become inactive, 
they start to act up against you. They have to be employed." 
</P>
<P>
Some patients are so engaged in relating their stories that they don't notice 
what he is doing. But the images of the sessions stay with them. Years ago, 
said Angres, who is in his mid-70s, there was a young psychotic man being 
diagnosed by a pair of psychiatrists at a Chicago hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The man fitfully described seeing with his mind's eye a peculiar, bald man and 
seeing strange miniature faces peering from walls and bookcases. 
</P>
<P>
"They assumed he was having another hallucination," Angres said. "Then they 
asked him if he was actually seeing an analyst regularly, and he said, 'Yes.' 
They laughed because they suddenly realized it was me. He was seeing the Apple 
Doctor." 
</P>
<P>
Angres acknowledges that he has little idea if or how his patients' revelations 
find their way into his art. 
</P>
<P>
One winter day, for example, while listening to a suicidal woman patient, he 
drew on a piece of cardboard at his desk. The result: a Nativity scene, with 
Joseph posed as a garage mechanic and Mary as a working woman, holding the 
infant Jesus in front of a 1940 Ford. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked myself, 'What's the connection?' It's not a direct process. I have no 
idea how it works. But I know I haven't invaded anyone's private world with my 
work." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Allan Adler, a La Mesa psychiatrist and medical director of the Alvarado 
Parkway Institute, a 198-bed psychiatric hospital, said he had never heard of 
an analyst who combined art with his practice. 
</P>
<P>
"But analysis is an open field as far as ideas and creativity," he said. "There 
are no such standards of what's appropriate and inappropriate to do with 
patients. Some people smoke pipes. Maybe this is his way of smoking a pipe." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Paul Keith, president of the San Diego Psychoanalysis Society and 
Institute, added: "Although analysts occupy themselves in many ways behind the 
couch, this would be unusual. The question is, 'Does it distract him from 
paying close attention to what is being imparted by the patient?' " 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bernice Neugarten, a professor of developmental psychology at the 
University of Chicago and a friend of Angres, said patient sessions would not 
suffer in intensity because of the psychoanalyst's artwork. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Angres once mentioned to me that he had a certain restlessness during 
psychoanalytic hours, and that he liked to keep his hands busy," she said. "I 
know that he's been very successful as a psychoanalyst at a time when others 
have lost patients. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the practice of some women therapists who knit during patient 
sessions. It doesn't draw their attention away -- rather, it helps them 
concentrate." 
</P>
<P>
One patient visited Angres for months before noticing his work. "I was really 
in a horrible stage when I first began seeing him," she recalled. "I was 
suicidal, and I truly didn't see the artwork for months, I was so tied up in 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Mathes, another Angres patient, said she and Angres now regularly 
discuss his work as a warm-up to their sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"You have no idea what it takes to become a psychiatrist, and so it makes it 
special to see that part of him, what he sees in an apple or an orange," she 
said. "You wonder what he'll see in you. And, at the end of every session, he's 
always right on with his summaries." 
</P>
<P>
For Angres, art and medicine have always been almost equal pursuits. As a 
student in Germany in the 1930s, he worked his way through medical school at 
the University of Leipzig by illustrating anatomy textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
He moved to the United States in 1938, continuing his education at University 
of Chicago medical school and the Institute of Psychoanalysis there. As years 
passed, however, the artist's instincts remained intact inside the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
"The family folklore has it that he was a reluctant psychiatrist -- he really 
wanted to be an artist," said Noll Evans, a San Diego clinical psychologist and 
Angres' son-in-law. "But when he realized that he had a family to feed, he 
pursued the medical end of things." 
</P>
<P>
In each pursuit, Evans said, Angres uses his talent and training to detect what 
is not at first apparent to the eye. 
</P>
<P>
"He allows the rock or the apple rind to speak to him, making connections that 
are not immediately apparent to others. He does the same thing with people as 
he does with his art." 
</P>
<P>
Angres began his apple art by accident. During the mid-1950s, he was so 
consumed with his private practice that he often skipped lunch -- until his 
wife began giving him apples to take to the office. 
</P>
<P>
One Friday, he absent-mindedly carved an apple, and then threw it away. Three 
days later, the shrunken fruit was still there -- bearing the beginnings of a 
small, shriveled face. 
</P>
<P>
"In the organic process of shrinkage, the apple begins to take on life," he 
said. "And, because we're dealing with nature, there's a certain dignity in the 
distortion. So you see, the real work is done by the apple in my absence." 
</P>
<P>
His apple art soon made a minor splash in the Chicago art world. There were 
showings and news stories. Then imitators began to sell apple art. So Angres 
began to make his work more intricate -- and moved on to other media. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Angres talks as freely about the art of psychoanalysis as he does the 
psychoanalysis of art. In a 1969 interview in the Chicago Tribune, he explained 
the importance of both. 
</P>
<P>
"A person should have many interests," he said. "It's a dangerous thing to 
overspecialize. The specialist is prone to live and think only within one 
sphere. When he no longer can continue with that, he begins to die -- unless he 
has other deep interests, and the world is filled with so many wonderful things 
to interest him." 
</P>
<P>
More than 20 years later, he still harbors the same beliefs. And one day, 
Angres says, he'd like to conduct a seminar for retired people on redeveloping 
forgotten skills and interests. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a way to dust off some very old interests that have been long 
junked by people, pursuits that have been snowed under by their careers." he 
said. "When they get through with their specialty, many have all this time and 
they don't know what to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
Angres, however, has too little time and too many pursuits. He still flies back 
and forth to Chicago to see some patients. While in San Diego, he divides his 
time between his patients, his studio and art gallery off Prospect Street. 
</P>
<P>
Several mornings a week, he dons his denim jacket and a leather fishing hat and 
scours the beach near his home for raw materials. His home office is littered 
with pieces in the process of becoming art. 
</P>
<P>
One of his artistic heroes is Pablo Picasso who, late in his career, took an 
old bicycle and transformed it into a perfect re-creation of a goat. 
</P>
<P>
Angres points to a mounted lobster shell that, when turned around, becomes a 
woman performing a sinewy dance. "It's proof that even the ugliest of all 
creatures can become a seductive belly dancer." 
</P>
<P>
Then he picked up a polished rock from the floor and turned it in his hands, 
marveling at its possibilities. "This piece is loaded," he said. "This hole 
here could be a nose or a bellybutton. It has so much, I'm waiting for 
inspiration." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, like so many of his patients, the rock will reveal its closely held 
secrets to Erwin Angres. 
</P>
<P>
In his psychoanalytic career, the doctor will always be proud of his claim to 
be one of the first medical experts to challenge Freud's theory that an analyst 
must pose an impersonal face to his patients. 
</P>
<P>
But, in the end, he would rather be remembered for his art. 
</P>
<P>
"Psychiatry," he said, "is ultimately vague. At the end of the day, you often 
don't know what you've accomplished. It's sometimes only after years and 
sometimes decades that you see what you've done. 
</P>
<P>
"And, even when the patient goes away happy, you never know. After 10 years, 
what will happen to the children? But with art, you can hold the finished 
product in your hands -- even after an hour or just a few days. Art is much 
more satisfying." 
</P>
<P>
Standing amid his creations, the artist was asked to analyze his own work. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say," said the doctor, "that this is definitely the work of a very odd 
person." 
</P>

ERTE; VERSATILE ARTIST AND DESIGNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Erte, the versatile and prolific artist whose Folies Bergere costumes and 
Harper's Bazaar magazine covers set a lavish tone for the 1920s and whose art 
deco prints continued to sell well into the 1980s, died Saturday in Paris. He 
was 97. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for Cochin Hospital refused to state a cause of death. Friends said 
he had been hospitalized three weeks ago after returning from a vacation trip 
to the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
During his productive life, Erte designed costumes for the street, stage and 
screen, painted, made lithographs, sculpted in wood and metal, crafted jewelry 
and designed sets for opera, ballet, nightclub shows and films. 
</P>
<P>
He became famous for his fine-lined, elongated sketches of slender women in 
luxurious gowns and cocoons of fur, often accompanied in their glamorous 
high-tech settings by stylized greyhounds, leopards and panthers. 
</P>
<P>
The artworks became familiar fare in American art galleries -- in Los Angeles, 
they were often shown at the Circle Gallery and the Richard Mann Gallery. 
Lithographs from his famous alphabet series featuring the elaborately adorned 
"Erte woman" accent the walls of the Westwood Marquis Hotel, where Erte 
celebrated his 90th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
His graphics, paintings or sculptures are also prominent in the homes of Barbra 
Streisand and Cher and lesser-known celebrity admirers. And his continuing 
popularity won him nicknames as the "Father of Art Deco" and "Mr. Art Deco" -- 
titles that he disdained. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not like to be called 'Mr. Art Deco,"' he once told the Los Angeles 
Times. "I contributed to that movement. But I also contributed to surrealism. I 
do not understand it." 
</P>
<P>
Born to an aristocratic family Nov. 23, 1892, in St. Petersburg (now 
Leningrad), Russia, young Romain de Tirtoff designed his first dress -- an 
evening gown for his mother -- at the age of five. He emigrated to Paris in 
1912 to work for fashion houses and adopted as his professional name the French 
pronunciation of his initials, Erte (Air-tay). 
</P>
<P>
His Harper's Bazaar covers from 1915-37 made him a favorite in the United 
States, and he was lured to Hollywood in 1925 by a contract with 
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to design costumes and sets for movies and to "Paris-up" 
studio actresses. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to this country," he said then, "because I realize that from Los 
Angeles the films may do more toward establishing fashions than any other 
influence in the world. It is because they speak the international language of 
the eye and reach the masses." 
</P>
<P>
He stayed seven months, then left in a huff. 
</P>
<P>
While he was in town, Erte informed California women that their skirts were too 
short and men that their clothes were too drab, complained about actress 
Constance Bennett's prominent shoulder blades, and threw Lillian Gish out of 
his workroom when she demanded that her costumes for a role as a poor girl be 
fashioned out of silk. 
</P>
<P>
"Hollywoodland is a terrible place," he said on his way back to Paris. "Stupid 
and dull. I met some charming people, but on the whole it is terribly dead. If 
they have wild parties they have them in the houses with the window shades 
drawn." 
</P>
<P>
Erte broke his contract, he told reporters, because MGM kept rewriting a 
script, forcing him to design new sets and costumes for each version, then 
demanding he start over -- 50 costumes plus sets in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Erte designed costumes for George White's "Scandals" as well as 
the Folies, Dutch-born actress Mata Hari, who was better known as a German spy, 
American-in-Paris Josephine Baker, Sarah Bernhardt, Isadora Duncan, Joan 
Crawford and Anna Pavlova. 
</P>
<P>
Erte's personal fashion choices leaned toward lavender and mauve. When he first 
appeared in Los Angeles in 1925, he wore a "boudoir costume" of gray crepe de 
Chine pajamas with rose borders and a gray and fuchsia crepe dressing gown. For 
his first day at MGM, he chose lilac shoes. 
</P>
<P>
At a gallery opening here in 1979, he wore a lilac shirt and tie, a mauve-toned 
suit and white snakeskin shoes and belt. "I want to be an individual always," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
His vigorous good health and longevity were almost as celebrated as his 
legendary productivity. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been very fortunate," he summed up his career and life in a Times 
interview during a series of parties for his 90th birthday, which included a 
retrospective exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution. 
</P>

As a nonagenarian, he continued to work daily in his Paris apartment with its 
view of the Eiffel Tower, surrounded by a bevy of Burmese cats and turtledoves 
and the strains of Beethoven and Schubert. He concentrated in his later years 
on jewelry, clothes and sculptures. Retirement, he said, would kill him. 
</P>
<P>
"So many artists have to wait until they are dead before they can enjoy the 
fruits of their labors," he told The Times seven years ago. "I have been so 
fortunate all my life, and I am so grateful to the people who have appreciated 
my work."

<P>
Eleven years ago Michele D. De Angelus was about to embark on an overdue 
honeymoon with her husband, ceramist Jim Rothrock, when the phone rang. The 
caller was yet another art collector seeking her services as a free-lance 
curator. 
</P>
<P>
"We're leaving for our honeymoon," she said, "but let's make an appointment for 
next . . ." She never finished the sentence. The caller suggested that they 
stop by his house on their way out of town and examine his private collection. 
He wouldn't take no for an answer. 
</P>
<P>
She didn't know it then, but he was using corporate skills that had made him a 
millionaire and would soon make him a major player in the international art 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize how typical this was," De Angelus said a decade later in her 
Santa Monica offices. "Do it now, never do it later, it should have been done 
yesterday, how quickly can we move on this? Very typical Eli." 
</P>
<P>
"Eli" is Eli Broad (pronounced "Brode"), the man who persuaded the bride to 
take a detour on her honeymoon. That brief stop led to a dramatic career shift 
for De Angelus. Now 38, Shelly, as her friends call her, no longer has time to 
free-lance. She has become the curator and guiding force of the Eli Broad 
Family Foundation, a nonprofit, art-lending organization situated in a 
handsomely converted telephone switching station in the Ocean Park district of 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Long gone are the poverty days when she and her husband postponed vacations for 
economic reasons. Now she postpones vacations because she's too busy 
researching, curating and helping Edythe and Eli Broad acquire contemporary 
works by modern masters such as Anselm Kiefer, Robert Morris, Julian Schnabel, 
David Salle, Cindy Sherman, John Baldessari, Jenny Holzer and Leon Golub. 
</P>
<P>
Chief executive of Kaufman &amp; Broad, an international house-building company 
that he founded in 1957 (the largest of its type in California), the 
self-described "eclectic workaholic" was on the verge of breaking out of the 
relatively isolated role of the private collector. 
</P>
<P>
He was already at work forming the new Museum of Contemporary Art in Los 
Angeles. He had an eye for potential -- in art and in people. 
</P>
<P>
Broad remembered their first meeting in his Brentwood home: "I was very 
impressed with her as an art historian and with her knowledge and museum 
background. At that time, we were looking simply for someone to catalogue our 
collection. She was clearly overqualified for that task. I was impressed with 
her curatorial skills. She had written on art, lectured, been involved in 
education. I considered her a highly capable curator who did not really enjoy 
working in a very institutional setting." 
</P>
<P>
At that initial meeting, De Angelus' first impression of Broad was that he was 
"not a team player." As she examined paintings and sculpture by Matisse, Van 
Gogh and Picasso, Broad spoke about his collecting ambitions and dreams. These 
included the creation of a lending foundation where scholars could view and 
study contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
"He was at the point where he'd gone from being a casual collector buying 
things to decorate walls in his house," she remembered, "to a very serious, 
very avid collector who was much more experienced. I joined on at just that 
transition and it snowballed." 
</P>
<P>
But an evolution from part-time free-lance work for the private collection to 
curator of the Eli Broad Family Foundation is more than a snowball -- it's an 
avalanche. As Broad's diverse art interests grew, so did De Angelus' role. 
While he operated a business empire and served as first chairman of the 
founding group of the Museum of Contemporary Art, De Angelus began cataloguing 
the Broads' personal art, curated and consulted for the growing corporate 
collection and gradually worked toward the creation of the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Broad's relentless pace and voracious intellect are well-known in the corporate 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"If I worked for Eli Broad," David Carpenter, chairman and chief executive of 
Transamerica, once observed, "I'd sure want my facts straight before I walked 
into his office. You don't buffalo him." 
</P>
<P>
Not many people would have given the then-27-year-old woman much of a chance of 
survival with a notorious perfectionist such as Eli Broad. 
</P>
<P>
But De Angelus was well prepared for the task. She had learned the ropes in the 
professional art world in various positions, including a National Endowment of 
the Arts fellowship at the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio; as a researcher at the 
Whitney Museum in New York, where she worked on the "200 Years of American 
Sculpture" exhibit, among other things; and as an intern at the Smithsonian 
Institution and Yale University Art Gallery. She earned a master's degree in 
art history and French at Mt. Holyoke College in Massachusetts, did 
postgraduate work at the University of Delaware and lectured at Delaware, the 
La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art and UCLA Extension. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Barron, curator of 20th-Century art for the Los Angeles County Museum 
of Art, first recommended De Angelus to Broad. "Shelly has a very high and 
well-placed regard for herself, her intellect and her experience. I think she's 
someone who's not afraid to say what she thinks. My experience in dealing with 
people who are successful and often considered very demanding and difficult to 
deal with is that they often have a lot of respect for people who disagree with 
them, so long as it's backed up by evidence." 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Lyons, director of art programs for the Santa Monica-based Lannan 
Foundation, described De Angelus as "an extremely adventurous, dedicated, 
passionate looker at contemporary art. She's extremely knowledgeable about the 
entire field." 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forget the first time I went to San Francisco with him to look at 
galleries," De Angelus recalled. "Midway through the day I thought either this 
guy has a lot more energy than I have or he has on really comfortable shoes. 
He's really rapacious in his intellectual curiosity. He really does have a 
desire to make a difference in the world. He won't undertake something if he 
cannot really do it significantly." 
</P>
<P>
But Broad is shrewd when it comes to hiring employees. He recognized in De 
Angelus another potential overachiever. 
</P>
<P>
"I have the ability in whatever I do to get people to do more than they think 
they can do," Broad said of their relationship. "Now she's doing a whole lot 
more than she thought she could. We've both grown as a result of the 
relationship. I have no formal training in art history, and in some ways Shelly 
has been a teacher." 
</P>
<P>
Broad taught De Angelus by example, a talent he developed growing up in a 
family of rabbis and teachers. "I think Eli's gift is for selecting really good 
people to work with and then bringing them along," she said. "There are some 
people who can develop people really well, and if you're one of the people who 
can hang in there you really grow and learn a lot under his tutelage and 
challenge and provocation." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Broad had an international reputation and De Angelus was a relative 
unknown in the art world, he valued her judgment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very rare that he'd buy something I despise," she said. "There are times 
when I push or challenge him. A lot of times Eli will play devil's advocate. 
He'll challenge you. You have to be very clear in your thinking about an 
artist." 
</P>
<P>
Her role expanded as Broad's art ambitions grew. While helping to create MOCA, 
Broad was learning how difficult and expensive it is for museums to purchase 
contemporary works in an overheated art market. By the time an acquisition 
board voted to buy a new Schnabel or Salle, the price would have risen 
astronomically. But a private collector like Broad could purchase such works 
immediately upon their availability, and then loan them to the museum. 
</P>
<P>
De Angelus said she told Broad: "Historically, the great collections formed for 
museums were not realized by a museum board. They were formed by a single 
individual, like Frick or like Mrs. Whitney or the various donors to the 
Chicago museum." 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, after five years as board chairman of MOCA, Broad stepped down and 
began aggressively building the foundation with De Angelus' help. 
</P>
<P>
"But the way in which Eli's interests developed," she said, "and the ways in 
which we've worked together have really grown in a very natural way. So it's 
not as though there was this overwhelming concept of the foundation which I as 
an individual was called to implement. It really arose out of a natural 
interaction between us and a development of Eli's interests and ideas and 
understanding about the way museums work." 
</P>
<P>
De Angelus' role included serving as Broad's art scout, traveling to New York 
and Europe in search of contemporary art. She met with curators and artists, 
went to galleries and studios. When free from his corporate duties, Broad would 
join her and examine firsthand the works De Angelus recommended. 
</P>
<P>
"When I get there, we'll spend a long day together looking at the various 
collections," Broad said of his art trips to New York. "I like to make my own 
decisions but only after getting her views and judgment. She's a very good 
adviser. We agree most of the time, but there are occasions when we have 
different views." 
</P>
<P>
"Often I will come to artists that he isn't interested in or doesn't know 
about," she said. "Sometimes he'll bring an artist's work to my attention and 
say, 'OK, I'm interested in this artist. What period or what paintings should 
we collect?' Then I'll research that. It's a very dynamic relationship -- there 
are certain artists he feels very strongly about and others I feel very 
strongly about. I tend to be interested in more conceptual, more minimalistic 
kinds of work. Eli really likes very traditional painting with an obvious 
social commentary." 
</P>
<P>
Specific guidelines were set for the foundation. Its collection would be 
comprised of work done only in the last quarter of the century. There would not 
be an attempt at a complete survey of modern art. Instead, artists whose work 
interested Broad and De Angelus would be given an in-depth representation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're focusing on a select number of artists," De Angelus said, "but we're 
buying their work over a period of time. I think this comes out of Eli's belief 
that in a way the American audience for contemporary art is more sophisticated 
than people are thinking. In the 1960s that wasn't true and museums needed to 
present these kinds of survey collections, what I call trophy collections -- 
one elephant, one zebra, one antelope. The audiences got the overview, the 
general history of contemporary art postwar. What they need now is some really 
in-depth education about contemporary art. And museum collections in this 
country very rarely offer you that kind of in-depth look." 
</P>
<P>
Broad purchased a closed telephone switching station in Santa Monica to house 
the offices and offer exhibitions. The space is open only by appointment and 
only to art scholars, museum professionals, artists and writers. 
</P>
<P>
De Angelus curated the inaugural exhibition in December, 1988. The collection 
is not meant to be a museum in perpetuity, both Broad and De Angelus hasten to 
add, but a resource for museums. At some point the collection will be given as 
a whole to an institution. "But not before the year 2000," Broad added. 
</P>
<P>
De Angelus' role has expanded as the foundation has grown. Besides looking for 
art, she diplomatically negotiates the purchases. No longer is the ability to 
write a check the sole criteria. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to cultivate the artist or the dealer," she said, "get them to 
understand that the works will be well seen, that they'll be available for 
loan. Cultivating an artist, cultivating a dealer, getting to know their body 
of work, getting to know what pieces are important." 
</P>
<P>
There's considerable administrative work. Loan requests must be considered. 
Details of shipping and crating and insurance -- a major responsibility in a 
rapidly changing market -- require that De Angelus and her staff of four 
document every step of their work. 
</P>
<P>
Growing along with the foundation, of course, is the relationship between the 
businessman Broad and the art historian De Angelus. 
</P>
<P>
"Eli's obviously very aware of the market, being a businessman," she said. 
"That education in the market is something I've gotten from him. He often has 
very abstract thinking about fiscal matters, which is something that was new 
and very valuable to me. So I think it's an interesting exchange. I've pushed 
him to things he might not have become interested in otherwise, and in other 
things he's very insistent." 
</P>
<P>
That notorious insistence can occasionally make things difficult, De Angelus 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Eli's constantly onto the next thing," she said. "This has been somewhat tough 
on me because you'd sometimes kind of like him to say, 'You've done a great 
job. This is wonderful.' Well, obviously you've done a great job or you 
wouldn't be still in the job. Instead it's, 'What's the next thing that remains 
to be done, what are our next objectives?' " 
</P>
<P>
So what gives De Angelus the strength to continue? 
</P>
<P>
"In my humorous moments I think it's because I had a very withholding father," 
she said, laughing. "Since I don't have it in my personal life I've re-created 
it in my job life. But, seriously, although we're dissimilar as personalities, 
in certain ways Eli and I are similar. We're perfectionists. We're people who 
are intellectually inquiring, who need new information." 
</P>
<P>
De Angelus thinks back 11 years to that phone call and how it's changed her 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"I've really grown up under Eli's tutelage. I've become a much more efficient 
sort of A-type personality under his prompting. Now I have a really amazing 
view of the art world that not many people get. . . . Edy and Eli believe 
they're only caretakers for this art work, even the work they own personally. 
And we're all privileged to be able to help the art maintain this life and move 
along." 
</P>
<P>
What about the Broads' private collection that De Angelus was initially hired 
to catalogue? 
</P>
<P>
"We never did catalogue the collection," she said. "We got it organized, made 
documentary files, but it's still going on."

A TOKYO-NEW YORK-HAMBURG CLASSIC CONNECTION;

<P>
SONY CLASSICAL'S PRESIDENT GUNTHER BREEST INTENDS TO CARRY OUT HIS COMPANY'S 
COMMITMENT TO DOMINATE THE FIELD -- FROM GERMANY

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The great media revolution has begun. The logistical machinations are 
confusing. Also portentous. 
</P>
<P>
A Japanese electronics giant has purchased a distinguished yet faltering 
American organization and placed its destiny in the hands of a veteran of 
mighty phonographic wars from Germany. In the process, Tokyo has moved 
institutional headquarters from New York to Hamburg. 
</P>
<P>
The recording of so-called classical music -- both audio and video -- may never 
be quite the same again. Here is the basic, convoluted libretto: 
</P>
<P>
Once upon a time, there was a company named Columbia. Its history could be 
traced to 1891. It made seminal contributions to the evolution of take-out 
music. After World War II, it pioneered the long-playing vinyl record, 
liberating sonic art from the clumsy confines of 78-rpm shellac discs. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia could boast some very important names on its roster of conductors, 
instrumental virtuosos and opera stars. Nevertheless, as time wore on, the 
company devoted the bulk of its energy to pop endeavors. These produced the 
quickest, easiest and biggest financial rewards. 
</P>
<P>
When the focus of corporate activity shifted, so did the name on the label. 
Columbia became CBS Records. At the time, CBS Masterworks -- the branch that 
half-heartedly produced symphonies, operas and chamber music -- accounted for a 
paltry 5% of CBS Record sales. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as the American economy teetered, the industry looked eastward. Far 
eastward. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the Sony Corp. of Japan, which enjoys annual sales above $16 
billion, purchased CBS Records. It was worth noting that both Akio Morita, the 
co-founder of Sony, and Norio Ohda, the president, happened to be avid 
champions of the sort of music CBS had neglected. Ohda, in fact, had been 
trained as a baritone, and his voice actually graced a few records. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1989, Ohda formed a new label: Sony Classical. It would encompass 
the existing CBS catalogue as well as treasures from the vaults. More 
important, it would produce new records and videos for the global consumer 
market on an unprecedented scale, and take advantage of state-of-the-art 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
This may be the day of the compact disc (a.k.a. CD). For better or worse, the 
long-playing record (a.k.a. LP) is rapidly being forced into extinction, as if 
it were a 78-rpm dodo bird. The wealthy and generous geniuses at Sony, however, 
already are thinking ahead to Digital Audio Tape (a.k.a. DAT) and Laserdisc 
prerecorded software. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas CBS was sometimes accused of settling for shoddy recording techniques, 
Sony Classical is eagerly exploring futuristic concepts. Mind-boggling press 
releases boast of 20-bit enhanced digital audio for "high definition" sound and 
of comparable HDTV video. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Sony Classical intends to be a world leader, probably the world 
leader, in its field. The investment of Japanese funds is staggering. So is the 
deployment of international talent. 
</P>
<P>
The key figure, as regards talent, is Gunther Breest. Ohda lured him away from 
the all-powerful firm of Deutsche Grammophon (a.k.a. DG). Breest had long ruled 
that imposing Germanic roost as executive vice president and chief of 
production. 
</P>
<P>
Given the title of president of Sony Classical, he will concern himself with a 
broad variety of problems. These range from talent acquisition to introduction 
of new technology to product realization to in-depth marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Born 49 years ago in Leipzig, he learned his craft the old-fashioned way. In 
1965 he earned a diploma in sound engineering (the Germans, who have a title 
for everything, officially dubbed him Tonmeister). The following year he 
received a performance degree in Detmold, having specialized in organ and 
harpsichord. After working in Iceland and for the Bertelsmann corporation, he 
joined DG in 1970, working his way up the ranks as engineer, producer and 
director of artists and repertory (a.k.a. A&amp;R). 
</P>
<P>
He was personally involved in the creation of numerous recordings that have 
become historic landmarks. The secret of his success, it was generally 
acknowledged, involved his sensitivity to the needs and quirks -- artistic as 
well as personal -- of such difficult musicians as Herbert von Karajan, Carlo 
Maria Giulini, Claudio Abbado, James Levine, Maurizio Pollini, Leonard 
Bernstein, Itzhak Perlman, Placido Domingo, Jessye Norman and the members of 
the Amadeus Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
Although the terms of Breest's current employment are unavailable for public 
scrutiny, informed sources speculate that his Sony contract affords him 
anywhere from $400,000 to $800,000 annually for 5 years, plus "incredible 
perks." Those perks don't even include the frequent-flyer miles that he will 
accumulate commuting from his new home office in Hamburg to his bosses' office 
in Tokyo and to his auxiliary office in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the actual salary happens to be, Breest must be the best-paid 
executive in the international arts arena. He may also be the most powerful. 
</P>
<P>
Breest obviously doesn't come to New York often. The befuddled receptionist at 
Sony's local bureau doesn't seem to know who he is. When finally located within 
the maze of offices and sales rooms, he is characteristically jovial. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not surprised she didn't recognize my name," he laughs. "Perhaps that will 
change." This remark may rank as his only excursion into understatement all 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
He remains agreeably candid, chronically enthusiastic, hopelessly optimistic 
and only slightly diplomatic as he discusses his new life over simple pasta and 
very dry white wine in the elegant restaurant next door. His language reflects 
a beguiling fusion of tech talk, biz talk, Americanism, slang, textbook English 
and fine German syntax. 
</P>
<P>
"For the time being," he says, "I will be here every six weeks, for a week each 
time. Eventually, I want to cut back on that. We will have meetings via 
closed-circuit television, with me in Hamburg, my associates here and in Tokyo. 
That will save my flying back and forth." 
</P>
<P>
He owns a house in Hamburg, where he lives with his wife and two teen-aged 
daughters, both of whom happen to play the cello. He already has acquired an 
apartment for quick vacation escapes in Florida. In New York and Tokyo, 
however, he calls a hotel room home. 
</P>
<P>
He sighs patiently when asked why Sony/CBS Classical headquarters had to move 
to Germany. He has tried to answer this question before. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very simple," he claims. "These days, you cannot run a classical 
operation from a desk in the States. CBS was so successful in the pop field -- 
so successful with fast return of its investments. The company expected the 
same fast return with its classical product. Unfortunately, that is typical of 
American thinking. If you don't come back with 30%-plus in two years, they 
won't let you operate. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt we had to get away from this counter-productive attitude. It is so 
against the nature of classical music, which really needs to be nursed and 
developed. In this field, you hope to start with an artist at 18 and still have 
him when he is 80. In this field you need long-term thinking. You need support. 
That is not in the American business mentality. I cannot operate in such an 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
The meandering answer makes sad sense, despite its partial evasion. Breest 
refocuses. 
</P>
<P>
"The main reason for going to Hamburg?" he asks himself. "No. 1: The sources 
are in Europe. I wanted -- needed -- to be where the artists are. I wanted to 
be near the action. 
</P>
<P>
"No. 2: CBS is literally non-existent in Europe. The records are just not 
available. You don't see any product there. CBS is to my best experience too 
Americanized. I must change that." 
</P>
<P>
He takes into account the crumbling of the Berlin wall. "We must record the 
Berlin Philharmonic with (Claudio) Abbado. The new political situation makes 
that even more important than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
"I am certain the center of intellectual and musical activity will now go to 
central Europe, and Berlin will be the nucleus with a much broader opening to 
all of Eastern European countries. Sony Classical must be nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"I see an opening and a market. We may record in Leipzig and Dresden." 
</P>
<P>
He isn't likely to record with the local conductors in those East German 
cities, however. When pressed, he states that Kurt Masur (the newly appointed 
music director of the New York Philharmonic) and Hans Vonk are "not good 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
Originally, he had planned an extensive series of Russian operas to be taped in 
Bulgaria. Now, with the advent of perestroika, he is happy to move the project 
directly to Moscow. This man values authenticity, wherever practical. 
</P>
<P>
He recognizes the irony in Japanese money funding an American effort based in 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not be surprised if this were some sort of a trend," he reflects. "You 
see, the support from Tokyo is not primarily financial. Tokyo provides the 
philosophy, the understanding that really is in accordance with the needs of 
classical activity. Tokyo provides a strong view, a vision. It wants to build a 
catalogue that can still be exploited in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
"No one in the United States is willing to think that way today. It may have 
been different in the past, but I don't see anyone on a high management level 
of any American corporation willing to accept this way of thinking." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Breest got the Sony job as an indirect result of a commercial 
counteroffensive on Japanese territory. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first heard that Sony intended to take over CBS, I worried about the 
impact of that merger on Deutsche Grammophon. I thought that we -- DG -- simply 
had to go to Tokyo and show them who is No. 1. So we took all our equipment 
there and taped the program with Jimmy Levine, Kathleen Battle and Placido 
Domingo. I served as producer. We were shooting and recording busily. 
</P>
<P>
"Ohda came to observe a session. He was sitting quietly in the last row of the 
hall. He asked to see me, and made me the offer. It was strange. Here I was, 
being hired by the competition that I had come to fight." 
</P>
<P>
After 18 years at DG, Breest left with mixed feelings. "It was a very hard 
decision," he says. When pressed, he concedes that there were some extenuating 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not see at DG the necessary exploitation of the hardware. I was in that 
a little bit disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
He recounts some increasing frustrations. "I was always out to get fascinating 
artistic things. I was in permanent contact, for instance, with (Riccardo) 
Muti. I wanted to wait for the right moment, and it finally came when Karajan's 
shadow was begining to fade away. Just then, someone on a higher level at DG 
decided that Muti should go to the Philips division. I could not do anything. I 
was not in a strong enough position." 
</P>
<P>
That sort of history isn't likely to repeat itself at Sony. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to accept the disappointment," Breest adds. "I was a corporate man. 
But I resented the corporate interference. I think that DG got a bit too huge, 
that it had too many interests." 
</P>
<P>
At Sony, he gets to make artistic as well as management decisions. "I report 
only to (Walter) Yetnikoff, the head of CBS, and to Ohda," he declares with a 
grin that stops just short of smugness. "They accept that." 
</P>
<P>
Even with Sony's lofty technical standards and massive budget, Breest admits 
that he will have to keep an alert eye on Deutsche Grammophon. 
</P>
<P>
"Now they are my chief competitors," he says. "But I like competition. It is a 
weakness of mine. I need stimulation. In that sense I am happy to stand up 
against DG. When I joined DG, it had 10 to 12% of the market. When I left it 
had 24%." 
</P>
<P>
The challenge is obvious. 
</P>
<P>
Breest used to visit Los Angeles with some regularity when DG recorded Giulini 
and the Philharmonic. Now he may return from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
Within two years, he hopes to film and record the Music Center Opera/L.A. 
Philharmonic production of Wagner's "Tristan und Isolde." The hero is to be a 
rather controversial, potentially dangerous choice: Domingo. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the idea," Breest insists. 
</P>
<P>
The choice of heroine remains uncertain. The Philharmonic has announced a 
rather lightweight British soprano: Anne Evans. Breest mentions the possibility 
of the German mezzo-soprano Waltraud Meier, who has never undertaken a role 
like this. In any case, the conductor will be Zubin Mehta, and the designer 
David Hockney. 
</P>
<P>
Breest points out that he will not shoot a live performance. He is not required 
to abide by in-house casting decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"This must be special. It must be done very professionally. It will be a most 
sophisticated visual as well as musical production. There may be some changes 
in the staging. Hockney must be involved from the beginning to create this 
video art form. The lighting is very sensitive. 
</P>
<P>
"I am bored with all these videos that are designed for television and that 
merely record an opera-house performance in progress. We can do so much more." 
</P>
<P>
Sony Classical also has some interesting projects for Esa-Pekka Salonen, both 
with and without the Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he will sell records," Breest predicts. "It will take five years. I 
have high hopes for him, especially when I look at the existing catalogue. It 
is a question of repertory, and a question of context. 
</P>
<P>
"CBS made some wonderful recordings of modern music in the old days, with 
Stravinsky, for instance, and with (Pierre) Boulez. They were never looked 
after, never properly focused. They were just smuggled into the catalogue, as 
if by accident. We will remaster them and make them available internationally. 
We will focus on a special line: the music of this century. We will put effort 
in it, and tell the customers that we believe in it. 
</P>
<P>
"Esa-Pekka can be a tremendous help in support of the new. He will record 
adventurous things. He also will record Sibelius, Shostakovich and Stravinsky. 
There is much more interest in such things than the pop-minded -- the 
Michael-Jackson-minded -- people ever think there is." 
</P>
<P>
Having said that, the top salesman supports the A&amp;R director. "I will get 
influence in all the major markets. The orders and priorities will come 
directly from me. It won't just be in the big, the obvious markets." 
</P>
<P>
Though Breest insists that he offered no pressure and no special lures, many 
famous artists are following their former DG leader to Sony. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't go after them," he claims. "They go after me." He attributes this to 
his personal penchant for tender, loving care. 
</P>
<P>
"A key executive," he says, "must have a personal relationship with his 
artists. He must understand their weaknesses, their vulnerability, what makes 
them function. That -- not money -- makes them want to work with you." 
</P>
<P>
Giulini wants to continue working with Breest. So do Abbado and Levine. The 
latter will begin a series of Met productions for Sony with an "Aida" featuring 
Aprile Millo and Domingo. Further plans include an "Otello" conducted by the 
elusive Carlos Kleiber, the release of Vladimir Horowitz's final recital, and a 
series of Bruckner symphonies conducted for video only by the eccentric Sergiu 
Celibidache, who refuses to submit to ordinary audio recordings. For many, the 
ultimate coup of coups, however, will be Sony's release of the massive, 
self-glorifying video output of Herbert von Karajan. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is Zubin Mehta. 
</P>
<P>
"It is true," Breest says. "Mehta's sales have been amazingly slow. I am happy 
that he is leaving New York. He doesn't function well here. He likes the social 
life too much, and the speed. That distracts him. The demands, the power, the 
pressure of this city are not what he needs for music making. 
</P>
<P>
"In Berlin and Vienna he will have tremendous steps forward. He is an entirely 
different musician there. I was so surprised. 
</P>
<P>
"He had been such a promising musician at the beginning, and then it stopped. 
Nothing developed really. Now there will be a tremendous change." 
</P>
<P>
Breest frowns at the mention of Mehta's Los Angeles recordings, made for the 
rival firm of London/Decca. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not good," he asserts. Subject closed. 
</P>
<P>
Breest has inherited some valuable talent from CBS. "I will continue to build 
up the existing catalogue," he says, "with artists like Midori, Wynton Marsalis 
and Murray Perahia." 
</P>
<P>
He isn't happy, however, with all his legacies. He finds a recording of 
Donizetti's "La Favorita" with Alfredo Kraus and Agnes Baltsa "not as good as 
it could be," and is tempted "to pay everyone off and not do it." He is 
disappointed in a "Tosca" recorded by Eva Marton and Jose Carreras in Hungary 
under Michael Tilson Thomas. "If it can't be done at La Scala," he asks, "why 
bother?" 
</P>
<P>
The problem is practical. "I was able to stop certain things I disagreed with 
when I took the job. There were others that were too late to stop. Commitments 
had to be honored." 
</P>
<P>
One of the most bizarre commitments involves another Hungarian effort, Boito's 
"Mefistofele," as realized in 1987. Faust was assigned to Carreras, who had to 
abandon the project prematurely when stricken with leukemia. The recording was 
completed without him. It was hoped that he would dub in his part at a later 
date when he was well. 
</P>
<P>
Carreras is now well, but he no longer wants to sing this demanding role. It is 
being overdubbed instead by the ubiquitous Placido Domingo. The final product 
will include such curiosities as a love duet enlisting a tenor who sang his 
lines in 1990, a soprano (Marton again) who sang hers in 1987, and a conductor 
(Giuseppe Patane) who now happens to be dead. 
</P>
<P>
"We will explain the special circumstances," Breest assures us. "We will be 
honest. The listeners won't hear the difference, but they will know." 
</P>
<P>
"Every situation is different. One must analyze each one. One must try to do 
something special involving visionary powers," says Gunther Breest. 
</P>
<P>
He isn't looking back. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to copy what I have already done. I have dreams. I will fight for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
The master of Sony Classical may just achieve his goals. He is a pragmatic 
idealist. He seems a benevolent dictator.

COVER STORY: ED ASNER RETURNS TO COMEDY IN 'NOT A PENNY MORE'; 
</P>
<P>
COVER APRIL 22 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Ed Asner made TV viewers laugh during the '70s as blustery newsman Lou Grant on 
the classic TV series, "The Mary Tyler Moore Show." But in the '80s, his 
comedic prowess was overshadowed by his passionate -- and often controversial 
-- political convictions. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of my news exposure, one tends to forget about the comedic factor," 
said Asner, who has attached himself to countless liberal causes. 
</P>
<P>
The Emmy Award-winning actor has kicked off the new decade on a lighthearted 
note. He's starring as a wily con man who bilks four young men out of their 
money in "Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less," a two-part miniseries airing on 
cable's USA Network. Based on Jeffrey Archer's best seller, the British 
co-production airs Tuesday and Wednesday at 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"It was fun," Asner said. "I felt great making it. I have a feeling I put in 
more comedy than they initially envisioned." 
</P>
<P>
The gregarious 60-year-old actor was sitting in his comfortable Studio City 
office that is decorated with primitive masks and figures from around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Resting on the shelf of a bookcase was a dog-eared copy of Garson Kanin's play, 
"Born Yesterday," which Asner starred in on Broadway last year. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the first time I was on Broadway since 1960," he said. "I loved doing 
the work on stage, but I think we came in under-financed and unprepared to 
weather the storm of the New York Times pan. You need money. If you are good -- 
and we were -- we could have survived it. We ran five months. I'm not ashamed 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
Asner was approached to do "Not a Penny More" during "Born Yesterday." He 
jumped at it. "The Brits are fond of me because of 'Lou Grant,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
While filming "Not a Penny More," Asner also did two radio broadcasts for the 
BBC, which the actor fondly calls "The Beeb." 
</P>
<P>
"It was outta sight," Asner said. "I did a wonderful hour play written for the 
BBC by Richard Nelson and then did a solitary reading of nine Thurber stories. 
I love working over there." 
</P>
<P>
Asner kept interrupting the interview to do a little interviewing himself. 
"What do you think of 'Born on the Fourth of July'? " he asked. "Did you see 
'Glory'? I loved it. What was your favorite film from last year?" 
</P>
<P>
He finally returned to the topic at hand: himself. "I would do a series in a 
minute," he said. He's particularly miffed at the way NBC handled his last 
series, "The Bronx Zoo," in which he played the principal of a beleaguered 
Bronx high school. 
</P>
<P>
"You only saw 18 episodes of the 21 we shot," Asner said. "They were displayed 
over a two-year period, and you never saw more than three consecutively on the 
same night of the week at the same time. The network made it impossible to 
develop an audience. It was starting to show in England when I was there, and 
people liked it." 
</P>
<P>
When Asner isn't in front of the cameras, he's busy with political causes. 
Earlier this year, he was arrested with Martin Sheen for protesting U.S. 
involvement in El Salvador. In February, he participated in the vote observance 
in Nicaragua and last month went to Washington to spend a night on the streets 
with homeless advocate Mitch Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
Asner took a long time to voice his convictions. He admitted he was afraid to 
speak out when he became an actor in New York in the early '50s, fearing he 
would fall victim to the McCarthy blacklist. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt so lucky that nobody knew who I was," he said. "It instilled a strong 
desire to keep my mouth shut." 
</P>
<P>
When he moved to Hollywood in 1961, political groups such as the ACLU 
approached him to participate. "I was delighted, but I moved slowly, keeping 
myself very circumspect so I wouldn't fall prey to some future blacklisting." 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Asner was on top of the world. He had a hit series in "Lou Grant" and 
he was the newly elected president of the Screen Actors Guild. Asner decided it 
was the right time to speak out against America's involvement in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
"I always carried guilt feelings vis a vis our country's performance in Latin 
America, and I thought we had done wrong," Asner said. "I wanted to rectify it. 
I decided to get other people involved. I was terribly naive, terribly 
amateurish." 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1982, Asner and several other actors went to Washington to 
announce the formation of Medical Aid to El Salvador. "Because I didn't clarify 
until the question-and-answer period that I was not speaking as president of 
the union, a great hullabaloo engendered. It ended up with the series being 
canceled." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, his entire acting career was almost canceled. "I became too hot to 
handle," Asner said. "With the way the attack was in the beginning, it was so 
severe, I was prepared never to work again. Only because the attacks kept up 
and got me so mad, overcoming my air of defeatism, I began to respond in kind 
to the attacks. That would go on for years. Finally, the sporadic jobs came 
along and kept me going." 
</P>
<P>
Asner insisted that he will never run for public office. "I couldn't stand to," 
he said with a hearty laugh. "I run from public office."

Whoopi Goldberg, decked out in black leather and trademark dreadlocks, struts 
across the Caesars Tahoe stage like she owns it. Most of the jokes are 
unprintable; many are laced, predictably, with social commentary. From X-rated 
musings about George and Barbara Bush's sex life, she segues into the First 
Lady's silence about most all issues (except illiteracy) affecting the country. 
It works: She takes the packed house inside the 1,500-seat Circus Maximus from 
rowdy laughter to thoughtful pause. 
</P>
<P>
The actress-comedian burst to national prominence in 1984 with her one-woman 
Broadway show, and she's returned to doing what she seems to do best: taking a 
stage and, up close and personal, entertaining and challenging a live audience. 
With a casual flick of her famous hair, or a subtle raised eyebrow (actually, a 
shaved eyebrow) beneath black horn-rimmed glasses, Goldberg puts the jokes -- 
and her feelings -- across. 
</P>
<P>
It's clear that at age 34 she's in top form, in her element -- and in control 
of her career as a stand-up performer. 
</P>
<P>
But outside the theater doors, it's another matter. 
</P>
<P>
After the flat-out raves and wildfire word-of-mouth that accompanied her New 
York show, and an Oscar-nominated performance as Celie, the illiterate Southern 
girl in "The Color Purple" (1985), Goldberg has appeared in a string of 
generally undistinguished movies -- and some outright flops. Once talked about 
as an emerging superstar, she's recently turned up on episodic TV, first in the 
syndicated "Star Trek" (now in her second season) and now on the half-hour 
sitcom "Bagdad Cafe," the new Friday night CBS comedy series in which she 
co-stars with Jean Stapleton. 
</P>
<P>
The sitcom is the latest twist in a perplexing, roller-coaster career that some 
see as full of miscalculation -- the undermining of a unique talent. 
Underscoring this: the difficulty of maintaining a career in an industry that 
offers few opportunities for black leading ladies. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard various rumors about my career falling off the side of the road, 
and about what a comedown it is for me to do a TV series," admits Goldberg, 
chugging mineral water and chain smoking during an afternoon interview in her 
penthouse suite at Caesars. She shrugs. "I find it interesting that anybody 
would think I was stepping down by working with Jean Stapleton. I mean, come 
on!" 
</P>
<P>
Yet she concedes that the flow of feature-film offers that followed "The Color 
Purple" has dwindled. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't lived up to the expectations that everybody slapped on me when all 
of this began," she admits. "I think a lot of people wanted me to be a female 
Eddie Murphy." 
</P>
<P>
The key problem with her film choices, she insists, is that her choices have 
been limited. "I did the best of those films that were offered to me. And I did 
the best I could with my roles. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, it's always sort of funny to me when people say, 'Gee, why did you 
do this or that movie?' And I go, 'Why? Did you have something better for me?' 
</P>
<P>
"Because if I sat and waited for what was 'the right role,' I would never work. 
'Color Purples' don't come along that often." 
</P>
<P>
She admits that she often goes against the recommendations of her longtime 
manager, Sandy Gallin, because she flat out enjoys working. "It's not as if I 
sit at home reading a ton of scripts that have been sent. 
</P>
<P>
"The imagination of the people who are making the movies is somewhat limited 
for me," she explains. "Hollywood is bound by these old codes which don't have 
very much to do with the art of movie making or the art of performance. For 
instance, I think you don't have to mention in a movie that someone's black. 
It's sort of self-explanatory. 
</P>
<P>
"Take something like 'Ironweed.' No reason I couldn't have done Meryl Streep's 
part -- no reason at all. Those were people in a certain time, and it wouldn't 
have mattered what color she was." 
</P>
<P>
But as Goldberg has learned, Hollywood isn't color-blind. It's no accident that 
her movies largely rendered her sexless -- or that the one love scene she 
filmed, opposite white actor Sam Elliott in "Fatal Beauty," wound up on the 
cutting-room floor. 
</P>
<P>
With the scene snipped, the duo was left with an implied romance and the 
exchange of a chaste kiss. And Goldberg was left feeling insulted. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg -- whose real name is Caryn Johnson -- grew up in the housing projects 
of Manhattan's Chelsea district, active in children's theater. As a teen-ager, 
she got involved with drugs, ultimately dropping out of school. At 18, she 
married her drug counselor and became pregnant. In 1974, a divorced Goldberg 
moved with her baby to San Diego, working a string of jobs -- including as a 
bricklayer and a mortuary cosmetologist. She briefly collected welfare. 
</P>
<P>
Theater work led her to the San Francisco Bay Area, where she created her 
one-woman act, "The Spook Show," in which she played a mind-boggling parade of 
offbeat characters. Producer-director Mike Nichols saw the show in 1983, when 
Goldberg was performing at Manhattan's Dance Theater Workshop, and offered to 
mount it on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoopi Goldberg," which opened in the fall of 1984, was SRO at the 700-seat 
Lyceum Theater. A show album followed -- it won a Grammy -- and the act was 
taped for HBO. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg was an enigma, with a remarkable ability to convey deep warmth, and 
finely honed performing skills that helped etch unforgettable characters. There 
was Fontaine, the male junkie with a Ph.D; a little black girl who longs to be 
blond, blue-eyed and white, like the folks on "The Love Boat"; the surfer chick 
who chats about the mall, the beach and the time she had to perform an abortion 
on herself with a coat hanger. And a crippled woman who recounts her 
relationship with a man who courts her and proposes marriage, realizing that, 
with some, beauty really is in the eye of the beholder. 
</P>
<P>
When she made her screen debut in Spielberg's controversial adaptation of Alice 
Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel "The Color Purple," she was launched 
further into the mainstream. Typical headline: Newsweek's "Whoopee for Whoopi." 
(As for the typical interview: Goldberg wouldn't divulge her real name -- and 
padded her age by five years.) People magazine judged her one of the 25 most 
intriguing people of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
She lapped it up, cruising the party and benefit scene with a vengeance, 
usually in funky attire irresistible to paparazzi. The frequent "Whoopi 
sightings" ultimately led to guffaws in the press. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone even wrote that I'd go to the opening of an envelope," recalls 
Goldberg. "That hurt very deeply. I guess no one realized how new all of this 
was to me." 
</P>
<P>
The movie vehicles that accompanied Whoopimania at first capitalized on 
Goldberg's flair for hip, streetwise comedy -- complete with casual use of 
four-letter words -- and action. 
</P>
<P>
First off was the 1986 20th Century Fox action-comedy "Jumpin' Jack Flash," in 
which she played a perky computer operator who turns heroic after making 
contact with a British spy trapped in the Eastern Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Originally conceived for Shelley Long, the film went through an army of writers 
and got a new director -- Penny Marshall. There were battles between filmmaker 
and star. "We disagreed over a lot of things -- including the tone of the 
comedy," says Goldberg. "Penny wanted it big and broad. I like subtlety." 
</P>
<P>
Still, her performance in the mostly big and broad "Jumpin' Jack Flash" charmed 
most critics -- who thought she was better than the material. It had ticket 
sales of $26 million -- a modest hit. 
</P>
<P>
Next: the 1987 comedy-mystery "Burglar," directed by Hugh Wilson ("Police 
Academy"), based on a mystery series by novelist Lawrence Block. Bruce Willis 
was set to star as the paroled cat burglar who's blackmailed back into the 
business, with Goldberg as his poodle-grooming sidekick. When Willis dropped 
out, Goldberg took the lead role, with Bob Goldthwait grooming the poodles. The 
Warner Bros. film grossed $16 million, and wasn't highly praised by critics. 
</P>
<P>
"Fatal Beauty" (1987) was originally intended as a gritty, anti-drug tale about 
a beautiful undercover cop -- to be played by Cher -- who sets out to find the 
source of a deadly drug called Fatal Beauty that's hit the streets. When Cher 
nixed the project, MGM considered other actresses, including Tina Turner. 
Meanwhile, Goldberg expressed interest in the project. 
</P>
<P>
"The movie was written with a beautiful woman in mind, and they resisted me (at 
the start)," she says. "When they finally did come to me, they had to pay an 
ugly woman's price." (Reportedly $2.25 million.) 
</P>
<P>
Once Goldberg was cast, the script's hard edge disappeared. The reason: 
"Beverly Hills Cop II," was in release, and making a fortune. "That's what 
'Fatal Beauty' looks like," laments Goldberg. "It looks like a really crappy 
version of Eddie's movie, right down to the poster." 
</P>
<P>
The critics thought so too. The Hollywood Reporter's Kyle Counts dubbed the 
film -- which grossed just $11 million -- "Beverly Hills Coppette." 
</P>
<P>
Then came a trio of dramas -- "The Telephone" (1988); "Clara's Heart" (1988), 
for which she received strong notices, and the recent "Homer and Eddie" -- 
which all bombed. 
</P>
<P>
Of "Homer," she says: "When I saw the first cut of this movie, I thought, I'm 
not going to talk about it -- ever! I don't want to know from it. I mean, it 
sucks. I don't know why they ever released it." 
</P>
<P>
Directed by Andrei Konchalovsky ("Runaway Train") for Kings Road Entertainment, 
the "road" picture cast Goldberg as Edwina (Eddie) Cervi, an escaped mental 
patient who has a brain tumor and one month to live, opposite Jim Belushi as a 
mentally retarded dishwasher. 
</P>
<P>
Lamented the New York Times' Janet Maslin: "Whoopi Goldberg remains one of the 
great unclassifiable beings on the movie screen." 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg has her own laments -- and they have to do with the notion that an 
actor is somehow responsible for the way their movies come out. With a nod to 
the reviews for "Homer and Eddie," she exclaims, "I ate it. I ate it! Like I 
wrote it and directed it and put it up there. And I just thought to myself, 
(expletive) you all!" 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, she resisted the "black actress" label, with all its 
creative and career limitations. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, she told Ebony magazine: "I don't want them to say, 'Oh, she's a black 
actor, we can't use her.' I want them to say, 'Oh, here's a great role. Call 
Meryl Streep. Call Diane Keaton. Call Whoopi Goldberg.' " 
</P>
<P>
In the Ebony interview, Goldberg also claimed that she wouldn't play domestic 
help. But she's since played two -- in "Clara's Heart" and "The Long Walk 
Home," in which she stars opposite Sissy Spacek. Due this fall from New 
Visions, it's a period drama, set in 1955, with Goldberg playing a maid who 
becomes involved in the Montgomery, Ala., bus boycott. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, there's not a single black actress of leading-lady stature, with 
Diana Ross, Cicely Tyson and, now, Goldberg, fading from the spotlight. 
Goldberg knows that if she waits for scripts to come to her, she could end up 
with no film career at all. So, of late, she's been going after roles on her 
own. 
</P>
<P>
Which is how she wound up on "Star Trek: The Next Generation," in which she 
co-stars as the intergalactic barkeeper, Guinan. (The syndicated series airs 
Saturdays at 7 p.m. on KCOP, Channel 13.) 
</P>
<P>
Gene Roddenberry, the show's executive producer, recalls his surprise when 
Goldberg's management approached his office in the spring of 1988. "I knew she 
was a star, so I didn't quite understand why she would take a secondary role on 
a series." 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg, it turns out, is a longtime Trekkie, who recalls watching the series 
as a child "and being so happy to see that a black person (Nichelle Nichols, as 
Lt. Uhura) had survived into the future." 
</P>
<P>
She likewise went after the supporting role of the spiritualist in "Ghost," 
Paramount Pictures' romantic comedy starring Patrick Swayze due in July. This, 
after her name didn't come up in discussions. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want the role to be a vehicle for anybody," explains director Jerry 
Zucker. "Based on her earlier movies, I definitely had a preconceived notion of 
her as this kind of funny, crazy person. But, that wasn't the role we were 
casting." 
</P>
<P>
Then he met with Goldberg, "and I was surprised, because she had a warmth I 
hadn't realized was there before." 
</P>
<P>
A professed workaholic, Goldberg fervently believes that an actor must "keep 
the machinery oiled. . . . Work is work -- the idea is to make it as good as 
you can." 
</P>
<P>
Which is one reason she grabbed at the chance to do "Bagdad Cafe." 
</P>
<P>
"It allows me to exercise. It's like doing a weekly play. And I needed a steady 
gig -- I need to stay put, in California, for awhile. Plus I'm working with 
Jean Stapleton. Plus I've been told that I can be involved in some of the 
writing, if we get picked up next season." 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg plays Brenda, the harried owner of a desert cafe/motel, who forms an 
alliance with stranded tourist Jean Stapleton. The series is adapted from the 
1988 cult film of the same title, which filmmaker Percy Adlon originally wanted 
to make with Goldberg. (Adlon wrote Goldberg several letters -- which he later 
learned she never received. "She was a very big star at the time. My movie was 
obviously an art film. I think whoever was getting her mail did not think the 
movie would be big enough for her.") 
</P>
<P>
If Goldberg had done the film, Adlon says, he would have made her role more 
comedic. Which is what the show's producers have done. The series, which 
debuted March 30, was ranked No. 18 out of 84 shows in its first week (it got a 
27 share, which means 27% of the TV audience tuned in), but dropped to No. 37 
its second week (and a 23 share). It was No. 46 (with a 19 share) in week 
three. 
</P>
<P>
If a weekly series grind isn't enough to keep her well-oiled, she's got 
numerous other ventures cooking, including: 
</P>
<P>
* "Comic Relief 1990," which she will again co-host with Billy Crystal and 
Robin Williams on May 12 on HBO. This is year No. 4 for the benefit for the 
nation's homeless. (A list of Goldberg's other charitable and activist 
associations fills two typed pages.) 
</P>
<P>
* The tentatively titled, "Roshon Brown -- Class Clown," a comedy/drama special 
for Nickelodeon, starring Goldberg as guardian angel to a boy with low 
self-esteem and failing grades. It's one of two projects Goldberg's helping to 
develop and produce for the network. 
</P>
<P>
(A hit with the pint-size set, Goldberg has thrice been named favorite movie 
actress in Nickelodeon's "Kids' Choice Awards.") 
</P>
<P>
* "Whoopi's World," an animated series featuring a little kid Whoopi -- and 
humanistic messages -- that she's been shopping around with Hanna-Barbera. It 
follows the adventures of a group of racially diverse inner-city kids, 
including one in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
* "Living on the Edge of Chaos," Goldberg's latest one-woman show (which picks 
up where her first one left off). She takes it to Australia, New Zealand and 
Tasmania beginning in late May. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's that series of print ads for the Gap clothing chain that's been 
appearing in tony magazines. One ad, in the May issue of Vanity Fair, features 
a four-generation portrait -- by superstar photographer Annie Leibovitz -- of 
Goldberg; her mother, Emma; daughter Alexandria, 15, and teensy granddaughter 
Amarah Sky. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg herself came up with the idea for the picture -- after learning that 
the tabloids were in search of the baby's picture. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time anyone saw Amarah was under wonderful circumstances!" declares 
Goldberg, whose deep brown eyes flash when she recalls the tabloid coverage of 
her daughter's pregnancy. "I was hot when they went after my family. If someone 
wants to find crap, let them look for it on me. I'm the public figure." 
</P>
<P>
Twice divorced, now living with camera operator Eddie Gold, Goldberg says that 
Alexandria discovered sex at a young age, failed to protect herself and became 
pregnant at 15, opting to have the baby. (Alexandria is no longer involved with 
the baby's father, but he checks in on the child.) Goldberg didn't share in her 
daughter's decision to have the baby. "But she came to me first. And that means 
everything to me. But, it's a lot to deal with. It's going to be tough." 
</P>
<P>
She says she and her daughter are in phone contact at least several times a day 
-- Alexandria lives in Northern California -- and that she gets regular 
Polaroids of Amarah, "who's just found her toes," and who happens to share the 
same birth date as Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been quite an education," says Goldberg of her heady Hollywood odyssey, 
with "some emotionally expensive" lessons. 
</P>
<P>
The costliest: "That art and business are two different things. They really 
truly are. It was only art for me until the business stepped in. The business 
aspects can be wonderful -- because it means you can make more money. But 
there's a price -- you lose control of things." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Goldberg is optimistic. "I have very high hopes, and very high 
standards. I want to do 'The Lavender Hill Mob,' with Paul Newman and Sean 
Connery, and I want to do 'It Happened One Night,' with Timothy Dalton -- but 
I'll do the Clark Gable role. He'll be a member of the royal family. And I also 
want to do. . . ."
