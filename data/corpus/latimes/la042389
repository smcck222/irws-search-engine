I am in complete agreement with Mary Lindsay (Viewers' Views, March 19). Jay

<TEXT>
<P>
Trenchcoat (Channel 5 Sunday at 6 p.m.) is an anemic 1983 mystery-comedy from 
Disney with a caper plot involving fledgling mystery writer Margot Kidder, who 
is the sole reason for sitting through this disappointment. With that grand 
gargle of a voice, she manages to be absolutely lovable as she suffers through 
the film's absurdities with vigor and elan. 
</P>
<P>
In his sleek and scary 1981 Wolfen (Channel 13 Sunday at 6 p.m.), director 
Michael Wadleigh keeps us mystified right up to a jolting finish. Albert Finney 
stars as a veteran Manhattan cop trying to solve a series of perplexing 
killings which are so swiftly brutal nobody can figure out how they were done. 
The film's bravura special effects are so firmly held in check by a carefully 
established premise, succinct characterizations and much wry wit that the film 
is able to evolve into an allegory on the perils of man's violence against 
nature. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Matheson stars in the new TV movie The Littlest Victims (CBS Sunday at 9 
p.m.) as Dr. James Oleske, one of the first physicians to detect AIDS in 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Baywatch: Panic at Malibu Pier (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.) stars David Hasselhoff 
and Parker Stevenson as lifeguards in what sounds like a series pilot. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Gunn (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is another new TV movie, with Peter Strauss 
cast as the suave private eye created by Craig Stevens in the Blake Edwards TV 
series. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Bourke-White (TNT Monday at 5 p.m.) is a new TV movie starring Farrah 
Fawcett as the Life magazine photographer who gained recognition for her 
pioneering work in still photography. Frederic Forrest co-stars as playwright 
and novelist Erskine Caldwell. 
</P>
<P>
Tough Guys (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.) may be less than plausible, especially at the 
finish, but this 1986 film is a rousing success as a tribute to its durably 
larger-than-life stars, Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas, who triumph over their 
own canonization as a pair of veteran bank robbers, released into the modern 
world after years in the slammer. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Boxleitner stars in The Road Raiders (CBS Tuesday at 8 p.m.), a new TV 
movie about an oddball World War II military unit. 
</P>
<P>
Last Train From Gun Hill (Channel 11 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is a solid 1959 John 
Sturges Western which stars Kirk Douglas as a steely sheriff determined to 
bring the young killer of his wife to justice. 
</P>
<P>
The Dirty Dozen: Next Mission (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is the first 
(1985) of the three unfortunate TV movie sequels to the mordant Robert Aldrich 
1967 World War II adventure; Lee Marvin, Ernest Borgnine and Richard Jaeckel 
returned from the original. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Hyams' highly entertaining 1981 Outland (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) 
is "High Noon" cleverly transposed to outer space and affords Sean Connery one 
of his strongest portrayals as a federal marshal who's pulled a year's tour of 
duty at a mining colony on a volcanic moon of Jupiter. He's there only two 
weeks when he becomes puzzled by a series of deaths, all of them apparent 
suicides. 
</P>
<P>
Stacy Keach, Keith Carradine and Steve Railsback star in The Forgotten (USA 
Wednesday at 9 p.m.). It's a new cable movie about six Green Berets who are 
released by the Vietnamese government. 
</P>
<P>
Nighthawks (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m., again on Saturday at 10 p.m.) is a 
great-looking, fast-paced 1981 terrorist thriller so stripped down that it's 
outright vague as to why -- or for whom -- professional assassin Rutger Hauer 
is on such a rampage. Pursuing him are New York undercover policemen Sylvester 
Stallone and Billy Dee Williams, with Stallone's estranged wife (Lindsay 
Wagner) eventually becoming Hauer's target. Also featured are Nigel Davenport 
as the head of Interpol and Persis Khambatta as Hauer's accomplice. 
</P>
<P>
Conan the Destroyer (Channel 13 Friday at 8 p.m.) is the amusing 1984 Richard 
Fleischer-directed sequel to "Conan the Barbarian." This time Arnold 
Schwarzenegger's Frank Frazetta-like superhero is teamed appropriately with 
Grace Jones. 
</P>
<P>
8 1/2 (Channel 28 Saturday at 10 p.m.) is Federico Fellini's dreamy, reflective 
masterpiece about a film director in crisis. As usual, Marcello Mastroianni is 
superb as Fellini's alter-ego. 
</P>
<P>
The ratings checks on movies in the TV log are provided by the Tribune TV Log 
listings service.

JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: DEPRECIATED VALUE; 
</P>
<P>
IF SOMEONE SAYS: 'THANKS A MILLION,' YOU MAY BE FACING A GRATITUDE DEFICIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE WORD million has lost the near-magic, hyperbolic value that it once had 
when we used it to define phenomena almost beyond calculating. 
</P>
<P>
It was enough to say that Henry Ford and John D. Rockefeller were millionaires, 
though they may indeed have been billionaires. 
</P>
<P>
Today there are probably a million millionaires in the United States. To call a 
man a mere millionaire no longer identifies him as super-rich. Today's biggest 
wheelers and dealers are billionaires -- at least. 
</P>
<P>
The power a billionaire has is truly beyond our grasp. His money would buy him 
almost anything he might want except, perhaps, a sovereign state, youth or 
beauty. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, it might buy him some sovereign states. 
</P>
<P>
Today, baseball players make $2 million a year. Juries hand out 
multi-million-dollar judgments as if they were confetti. Rock Hudson's lover is 
granted $21.7 million from Hudson's estate because Hudson failed to tell him he 
had AIDS. Clerks and beauty shop operators win $20 million in the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
We seem to have lost sight of how much money $1 million is. 
</P>
<P>
But Dan Frazier, a correspondent of mine, is determined to keep the true 
meaning of the word million before our eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Frazier has prepared a book, as yet unpublished, that graphically demonstrates 
the true meaning of the casual phrase "Thanks a million." 
</P>
<P>
The book consists of 125 pages on each of which the word Thanks is printed 
8,000 times -- in 40 columns of 200 words each. The words are too tiny for me 
to measure on my 12-inch ruler. 
</P>
<P>
By riffling through those 125 pages and seeing the solid banks of Thanks flash 
by, page after page, you get some idea of what a million is. 
</P>
<P>
The only other enlightenment that the book offers is a few illustrations of 
what a million means in concrete terms. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a stack of a million $1 bills would be 667 feet high. You would 
have to circumvent the world 40 times to travel a million miles. If a million 
people lined up for a movie, that line would be more than 189 miles long. (That 
figure, of course, would have to be an approximation, depending on how fat or 
thin the people were.) 
</P>
<P>
If you had a stack of a million records, it would be 10 times taller than the 
Empire State Building. 
</P>
<P>
If you could travel at a million miles per hour, you could travel from Los 
Angeles to New York in nine seconds. 
</P>
<P>
If you saved $15,000 a year, it would take you 67 years to save a million 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
If a million cars were in a traffic jam on a three-lane freeway, traffic would 
back up from New York to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
(Let's not forget. We have at least 3 million cars in Los Angeles -- enough 
potentially to cause a traffic jam from here to New York.) 
</P>
<P>
Less fearsome, perhaps, is the fact that a sheet of a million postage stamps 
would cover nearly three tennis courts. 
</P>
<P>
A similar fact is that a million inch-thick novels would require 15.9 miles of 
shelf space. 
</P>
<P>
Frazier is still looking for a publisher (publishers evidently think no one 
wants to read Thanks a million times). But if you want to say "Thanks a 
million" to someone, you may buy a privately printed copy for $14, which can be 
sent to Frazier at 5611 Carlton Way, No. 402, Hollywood 90028. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as we tread anxiously into a world where billion has replaced 
million, and trillion has overtaken billion at least in terms of our national 
debt, we may, with trepidation, try to calculate what those terms really mean. 
</P>
<P>
A billion is a thousand times a million, and a trillion is a thousand times a 
billion. To grasp the meaning of these numbers, take each of Frazier's 
illustrations and multiply it a thousand times. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, if you could save a million dollars by saving $15,000 every year for 67 
years, it would take you 67,000 years to save a billion, and 67,000,000 years 
to save a trillion. 
</P>
<P>
And if you personally wanted to pay off the national debt, at about $15,000 a 
year, it would take you about 134,000,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
Those calculations are my own, and if they are off by $100 million or so, 
excuse me. 
</P>
<P>
I can't even remember what 9 times 6 is.

UCLA'S CONTROVERSIAL NEW CHIEF OF OBSTETRICS TAKES RISKS OTHERS WON'T, SAVES 
BABIES OTHERS CAN'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOY HOROWITZ, Joy Horowitz is an ex-Times staff writer. She was once 
referred to Khalil Tabsh for prenatal tests. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHALIL TABSH was up all night delivering another baby and has just finished a 
17-hour day, fueled only by cough drops and coffee. Now, wear ing green 
surgical scrubs, the newly appointed chief of obstetrics at the UCLA School of 
Medicine scrambles from his black Mercedes 560 SL and sweeps into the 
conference room 30 minutes late, like a man possessed. He is here, at Sherman 
Oaks Community Hospital, to discuss a case in which some lives must be ended to 
save others. And for Tabsh, the case is simple -- a medical necessity -- 
although he, perhaps more than anyone, still feels torn by it. 
</P>
<P>
His 34-year-old patient has flown here from a small Midwestern town. For eight 
years, she has tried to conceive. Last year, she had a miscarriage. But in 
recent weeks, after in vitro fertilization, she had five embryos implanted in 
her womb and all five unexpectedly began to thrive. Now, the odds are not in 
her favor for a healthy pregnancy unless he uses his technical mastery: He must 
end the lives of three fetuses. Kill three to save two. That will allow this 
farmer's wife to have the baby she so desperately wants. In fact, she can 
safely deliver twins, he reasons. If he does nothing, chances are that all five 
babies will either die or be born so premature that they'll suffer brain damage 
and a host of other problems. The third option is to abort them all. 
</P>
<P>
The audience Tabsh is trying to win over -- a panel of doctors, lawyers and 
ethicists that compose the bioethics committee of the Los Angeles County Bar 
Assn. -- is moved but not persuaded. Tabsh is not asking permission -- the 
guidelines for doing such an experimental procedure are set by himself and a 
hospital research committee. But he does seem to be seeking approval, and he is 
certainly hoping for help in the struggle to balance what can be done, what the 
patient wants done and what should be done in cases like these. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, there is no consensus about the procedure in question, called 
selective termination or reduction of pregnancy, its safety and accuracy still 
unproved and its nomenclature a thinly veiled means of obscuring the emotional 
burdens of abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"Aren't you playing a moral poker game with these fetuses?" one doctor asks. 
</P>
<P>
"If we create human life with the knowledge that if there's too many we can 
reduce their numbers, there's an inherent disrespect in that," another says. 
"We've got some doctors putting in extra babies only to turn to another doctor 
and ask him to get rid of a couple of them." 
</P>
<P>
"The future to me is bleak because I don't know how this will be controlled," 
says a third. "More and more people are pushing for aggressive fertility 
treatments. And we're seeing more and more requests for selective reductions." 
</P>
<P>
Tabsh looks pained. "Patients with one baby with mental retardation -- they 
suffer," he says. The voice is Middle Eastern, the delivery brisk but gentle. 
"Can you imagine taking home five? But, you know, it's very stressful on the 
person doing this procedure. I feel sick to my stomach every time I do this. It 
is not pleasant." 
</P>
<P>
Tabsh is one of a handful of doctors across the country who is quietly pursuing 
selective termination. Technically, it is fairly straightforward -- just a 
sidestep from amniocentesis. During the first trimester of pregnancy, when the 
fetuses are about 1 1/2 inches long, he watches them on a television monitor 
via ultrasound and selects those that, because of their position in the uterus, 
are most accessible. Still watching the monitor, he inserts a 22-gauge needle 
into the mother's abdomen, through the uterus and into the chest cavity of the 
fetus and injects a lethal dose of potassium chloride. The heart stops and the 
fetus dies; in time, it is absorbed by the mother's body. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pro-choice and I'm pro-life," Tabsh tells the assembled group, thinking of 
the 20 times in the past two years that he has ended the lives of some fetuses 
to save others sharing a womb. "Knowing 20 of my patients have taken home 
healthy babies -- this is why I do it." 
</P>
<P>
WHAT TABSH is wrestling with on this night is what he faces daily -- a moral 
and ethical dissonance caused by what medical science enables him to do. That 
conflict defines his rapidly advancing branch of medicine -- perinatology 
(literally, "around birth"), or maternal-fetal medicine. Perinatology turns on 
high-risk cases in which both mother and baby are the patients, not one or the 
other. It is the study of complicated pregnancies and of prenatal diagnosis, 
the wielding of tools such as ultrasound (also known as sonography) or 
amniocentesis or chorionic villi sampling, all of which allow one to "see" what 
is happening in the womb. Couples seek the new technology's experts -- a rare 
handful among whom Tabsh is prominent -- to predict a pregnancy's outcome and 
determine when to intervene to save a fetal life or end it, when to assure a 
successful pregnancy or terminate it. 
</P>
<P>
It used to be that babies and pregnancy just happened. The doctor was there to 
monitor things, and he or she made an appearance at the decisive moment, 
intervening during the birth process, if at all. Even a decade ago, natural 
childbirth was the rage. Now, the laying of hands atop a pregnant belly seems 
to have been superseded by the laying on of ultrasound-conducting jelly, 
probing needles or fetal monitoring belts. 
</P>
<P>
High-risk pregnancies -- involving mothers-to-be older than 35, couples with 
known genetic risks or a previous malformed child, women with medical problems 
or histories of miscarriage, and those whose tests indicate medical anomalies 
-- can be monitored through technology unavailable a decade ago. Fetuses that 
would not have survived are born healthy now because doctors can judge when and 
how to deliver, and arrange for pediatric surgeons to be in the delivery room, 
ready to perform immediate procedures. Some surgical remedies can even be done 
in utero, although so far these are few and rarely indicated. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors no longer simply ask, "Should we intervene in this pregnancy?" Instead, 
they focus on the questions of when and to what degree, particularly as the 
"high-risk" rubric seems to envelop a growing number of women. Even though the 
vast majority of pregnant women deliver healthy babies, more and more doctors 
are on the lookout for problems; peer pressure, malpractice fears and 
increasingly available technology are making intervention -- from testing to 
selective termination -- the norm rather than the exception. In the past 10 
years, the number of women choosing prenatal testing has tripled. 
</P>
<P>
Clinician, teacher, researcher, Khalil Mohammed-Ali Tabsh, 42, plows through 
this world like a combination high-tech wizard and the Lone Ranger. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd place him among the top five or six people in the country in 
maternal-fetal medicine," says Nicholas Assali, a founding father in the field 
of fetal physiology and recently retired professor of obstetrics from the UCLA 
medical school. "I'll tell you this -- he does not know what the word tired 
means." 
</P>
<P>
Tabsh delivers about 100 babies and estimates that he performs about 1,000 
ultrasounds and 500 amniocenteses annually, a high volume dictated by his 
specialty and his reputation. In addition, he is frequently called in as a 
consultant in emergency deliveries or complicated pregnancies at Santa Monica, 
Olive View, Northridge and UCLA hospitals. And he is continuing his research 
into the fetal lung development of twins and offering advanced training in 
high-risk obstetrics. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a Renaissance man," says his boss, Roy Pitkin, chairman of obstetrics and 
gynecology at the UCLA School of Medicine, a highly respected figure in the 
field of maternal-fetal medicine who appointed Tabsh to the faculty in January. 
"Few people in this field are able to span the distance from research to 
teaching to patient care. And I must tell you, I don't know that I've ever seen 
anyone with such devoted followers, from students to senior faculty colleagues. 
There is seemingly something charismatic about the guy." 
</P>
<P>
Tabsh, a master of the prenatal armamentarium, is considered a doctor of choice 
by patients and peers. Although many physicians perform ultrasound and 
amniocentesis, he is one of a select number of doctors authorized by the state 
to conduct the tests as part of its prenatal screening program, the only one of 
its kind in the nation. He was also one of the first doctors in Los Angeles to 
receive federal approval for pioneering the use of chorionic villi sampling, 
genetic testing of the placenta at nine to 11 weeks. For his part, Tabsh 
ascribes his talent to luck. "I'm good with my hands," he says. Peers say his 
ability to extrapolate three-dimensional images from the fuzzy TV pictures 
produced during ultrasound is exceptional. 
</P>
<P>
Tabsh's technical skill often translates into an aggressive pursuit of the 
avant garde. He is something of an obstetrical cowboy, riding the wild frontier 
of medicine, experimenting with the uses of technology to save lives that would 
almost certainly be lost if he limited himself to traditional approaches. 
Medically acceptable protocols allow for such innovation; Tabsh develops 
possibilities that rules and guidelines will only later stretch to cover (see 
related story, opposite). 
</P>
<P>
Most obstetricians monitor a fetus's condition with "non-stress" tests, 
stimulating the fetus and then asking the mother to report its response. But 
Tabsh applies a less commonly used but more sophisticated and invasive measure: 
He draws blood samples from the umbilical vein to determine how much oxygen is 
reaching the fetus. 
</P>
<P>
Often, he will teach himself a procedure that he's heard described, without 
ever having read about it in a medical journal or having seen it done. The 
controversial selective terminations are one such example. He had heard about 
colleagues performing the procedure in San Francisco and New York and decided 
to try it himself after discussing it with a doctor who'd pioneered the 
technique. "I talked to somebody who gave me an idea of how it could be done," 
he says. "At that time, there was nothing published on the procedure. I thought 
of all the possible complications that could arise and saw the possible ways of 
preventing them." 
</P>
<P>
In another case he improvised a technique in response to a crisis. An 
ultrasound picture of twins showed that one was twice the size of the other. 
The smaller twin had started bleeding into his brother through a shared 
placenta, causing the larger twin to swell and making his heart pump harder 
than necessary. The deteriorating condition of the infants led Tabsh to deliver 
the smaller one by Cesarean section and leave the other in the womb. As it 
turned out, only the larger twin survived, though Tabsh had guessed that the 
Cesarean delivery would save the smaller child's life and that the larger child 
was at greater risk. It was a never-before-attempted procedure. In fact, before 
performing the operation, Tabsh informed his patient that he had only practiced 
on sheep and other farm animals. 
</P>
<P>
Colleagues regard all this with mixed feelings. While acknowledging that Tabsh 
is talented and energetic, some view his work with caution. "We're not removing 
a fetus from the uterus and leaving one in," says Dr. Lawrence Platt, professor 
of obstetrics and gynecology at USC, who questions Tabsh's evaluation of the 
risks and benefits in deciding how to handle the twins' problems. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a bit of a wild man when it comes to doing things," says Dr. John 
Williams, formerly head of prenatal diagnosis at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center 
and now director of the privately run Prenatal Diagnostic Center in West Los 
Angeles. "If he sees something as being innovative, he pulls it off. Maybe he's 
just ahead of his time." 
</P>
<P>
Tabsh is neither a politician nor a moral philosopher. His personal bent is to 
save every pregnancy he can. So he actively pursues "good outcomes." He sees 
himself as a "fetal advocate," even if, as in the case of a doomed multiple 
pregnancy, it means destroying presumably healthy fetuses to do so. 
</P>
<P>
As obstetrical science moves closer to the ideal of guaranteeing every woman a 
perfect baby, Tabsh is viewed by many patients and doctors as a knight who will 
slay the dragon of uncertainty, replacing chance with choice; others say he is 
the dragon, a purveyor of runaway technology that has overtaken life's greatest 
miracle. Still others, in a time of rising malpractice premiums (obstetricians 
pay the highest rates in California, with perinatologists at the top of the 
list), say he's a saint; they're grateful that he takes on cases that most 
doctors can't or won't handle. A few days with him offers a glimpse into the 
fastest of medical fast lanes. 
</P>
<P>
TALL, BROAD-SHOULDERED, sometimes darkly preoccupied, Tabsh strides down UCLA 
Medical Center's newly renovated hallways with a fierce intensity. After 
completing his obstetrics and gynecology residency at Yale Medical School in 
1978, he came to UCLA for a two-year fellowship in perinatology and later 
received a tenured faculty appointment as associate professor. He looks at home 
here, having returned in January after three years in private practice. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, Tabsh's return to UCLA symbolizes the medical school's commitment 
to revitalize its sagging obstetrical service, which had ceased to be a leader 
in the field. In recent years, morale there had plummeted, and, says Pitkin, 
the department of obstetrics and gynecology was marked by a general sense of 
unrest. Tabsh, for one, gave up his tenured position -- a rare move in academia 
-- to pursue a private practice in 1986. But now, in addition to $1.2 million 
in physical refurbishments for patient care, efforts are under way to expand 
research and training opportunities. Certainly, Tabsh's being crowned with a 
full professorship by the university's chancellor in January is a harbinger of 
change. 
</P>
<P>
But at the moment, Tabsh's concerns are far more immediate as he stands in his 
self-fashioned bullpen -- between his patient, who is lying on an examining 
table, and his ultrasound machine. She is 32 weeks pregnant with twins and 
needs an amniocentesis immediately because she has started to go into premature 
labor. 
</P>
<P>
This will not be a "tap" for genetic information but one to determine whether 
her babies' lungs are mature enough for birth. If not, she might be given drugs 
to forestall labor or steroids to promote lung development. In any case, the 
amniotic fluid will be analyzed for surfactant, a type of fat secreted by 
well-developed lungs. 
</P>
<P>
Tabsh is not one for easy chitchat. His bedside manner is efficient. His right 
hand traces the surface of her abdomen with a transducer, a wand-like device 
that emits high-frequency sound waves that project an image of her baby on the 
video monitor before him. With his left hand, he punches buttons and knobs, 
simultaneously stepping on a floor pedal, eyes narrowed on the monitor's 
screen. Like a race-car driver, his body speaks of motion, swift and sure. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a membrane between them, though it's thin," he says, assessing the 
placement of the fetuses while pointing to a blip of light on the screen. The 
picture resembles a satellite-transmitted weather map. At the same time that he 
attends to the patient, he is also training two residents and an attending 
physician, none of whom was able to do the procedure the day before because of 
the babies' positions in the uterus. Today, though, the babies have moved 
sufficiently to allow Tabsh to share his expertise with his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you everything we're doing," he says to the woman, who, like some of 
the patients in his varied practices, has received no prenatal care during her 
pregnancy. Now, tears stream down her face, though she says nothing, as her 
abdomen knots up in a ball during another contraction. A nurse holds her hand. 
"You won't be surprised," Tabsh says. "Try to relax. You're doing fine." 
</P>
<P>
Watching the ultrasound machine, he guides a needle into the woman's abdomen. 
"You'll feel a little pressure now," he says. Since one of the twins is 
floating, he must wait until it has stopped moving before he can extract 
amniotic fluid. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like strong, mature fluid," he says, eyeing the vial he's just filled 
from one twin's sac. His patient smiles. But lab tests won't be forthcoming for 
several hours. Explaining his every move, he shoots a blue-colored dye into the 
first twin's sac to distinguish which fetus is which. Then, he does a second 
tap, this time guiding the plastic-gloved hands of a resident, who is placing 
the needle into the other twin's sac. 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, the twins' lungs are mature. Although some doctors would have 
found the procedure unnecessary and simply allowed the woman's labor to 
continue, Tabsh reasons that he's seen too many preemies in the neonatal 
intensive care unit not to intervene this way. Two small, healthy babies are 
delivered that night. 
</P>
<P>
But not all outcomes are so happy. 
</P>
<P>
Back at his Northridge office, in a small building sandwiched between 
Northridge Community Hospital and a shopping center, Tabsh has a waiting room 
crammed with 12 patients waiting to see him for prenatal testing. 
</P>
<P>
These patients are clearly nervous, flipping through magazines distractedly. 
Each is considered at risk of giving birth to an abnormal child, and many have 
been sent by a referring physician. Most have had simple blood tests to measure 
alpha-fetoprotein, or AFP, levels, yielding suspicious results. By California 
law, all patients less than 20 weeks pregnant must be offered the AFP test, and 
about half are choosing to have it. 
</P>
<P>
AFP is a protein produced by the fetus. If the AFP level is too high, it raises 
the specter of neural-tube defects, such as spina bifida, in which the lower 
end of the spinal chord fails to close properly, or anencephaly -- literally, 
"no brain." If AFP levels are low, there is a chance of a baby having Down's 
syndrome or other chromosomal anomalies. On the other hand, suspicious AFP 
results might mean nothing more than that estimated gestational dates are 
wrong, or that twins are to be expected. 
</P>
<P>
Tabsh's follow-up examination -- usually both ultrasound and amniocentesis -- 
will confirm the suspicions or give these couples' babies clean bills of 
health. If all is well, they could return for periodic ultrasound checkups; if 
it's the bad news, they will be asked to make a choice -- terminate or continue 
the pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Although most women agree to undergo prenatal testing, they do so believing 
that they will be reassured. And 98% of the time, they are right. But when 
problems are detected, couples are often unprepared to decide. 
</P>
<P>
One of the women in the waiting room is a petite 20-year-old, the youngest 
patient here. She is 18 weeks pregnant. When Tabsh turns on his white ACUSON 
model 128 real-time ultrasound machine to examine her, he winces. He 
immediately sees that there is no amniotic fluid around the baby. Cautiously, 
he tells her that there is a problem, even though she can see her baby kicking 
and waving on the screen. Soon, he realizes that the patient is leaking 
amniotic fluid. He asks her to meet him in his office down the hallway, past 
the bulletin board jammed with pictures of smiling babies. 
</P>
<P>
She sits in front of his desk, listening in shock and in tears. He tells her 
that he could not do an amniocentesis because of the lack of amniotic fluid 
around the baby. The baby is alive, he says. He could see nothing wrong with 
it, but its prognosis is extremely poor. Without amniotic fluid, the fetus 
cannot grow, its lungs cannot develop, and it will be grossly deformed. 
</P>
<P>
"How bad?" she asks. He cannot say exactly. His tests can provide information, 
but they cannot always offer a crystal-clear understanding of what it means. 
She will need to discuss this with her doctor, he says. But given his 
experience with such situations, he says he would recommend terminating the 
pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot kill my baby," she says softly, walking out the door. In the days 
that follow, however, she will change her mind and opt for an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Tabsh drives back to UCLA. Down a dreary corridor and across from a series of 
doors with "Caution: Radioactive Materials" signs, his UCLA office is a 
nondescript space -- a cubicle that, despite carpeting and a fresh coat of 
paint, remains virtually without personality. There are bookshelves, a desk, a 
chalkboard and not much else, save for the pictures of his four children -- 
Ali, Dina, Kareem and Tarek. 
</P>
<P>
Because he is both an intensely focused technician and a doctor whose expertise 
helps parents make life-and-death decisions, Tabsh is like two people. One is 
controlled and flinty. The other is playful and emotional, a person whom all 
the technological wizardry belies. That person, the one with an aching empathy 
for patients, tends to be downplayed, perhaps to help him distance himself from 
the intense emotions that surround him. Even he overlooks that side of himself 
at times. But not always. 
</P>
<P>
His next patient has driven from Santa Barbara to see him for a second opinion. 
She is a 32-year-old housewife who exudes much warmth. But she can barely 
conceal her grief at having lost a pregnancy for the second time. In 1987, she 
went into premature labor and delivered a 4-pound baby who died. In recent 
weeks, her fetus died during her fourth month of pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Now, she must decide when, or if, she should try again -- risking further 
heartbreak without any assurances of a healthy outcome. She has come for some 
simple blood tests and for basic information. She asks whether the demise of 
both fetuses was related. How could this happen again? Why? 
</P>
<P>
This is the currency of Tabsh's practice, the currency of loss. And of hope, 
too. He knows that he can provide courage to mothers who have suffered the 
trauma of a "bad outcome" or who, in years past, would never even have tried to 
become pregnant because of physical problems. But he also knows the limits of 
science, the reach of the heart. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors still do not know precisely what causes things to go wrong during 
pregnancy, or why. They have learned that certain factors can put women at 
higher risk -- having children later in life and high blood pressure, for 
example -- but they have no understanding of what brings those factors into 
play. And, in any case, many women who develop problems in pregnancy don't fall 
into a known risk category. 
</P>
<P>
Although the woman from Santa Barbara has a healthy child at home, she worries 
what another pregnancy will bring. There is talk of screening her for disease. 
But she's determined to try again. And psychologically? How is she feeling, he 
asks. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm OK as long as I don't have to go to baby showers," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"You should not conceive in the next six months," he advises. The tone is more 
comforting than patronizing. "The mourning process lasts about six months. Your 
body may be ready, but psychologically, it takes longer." 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping sooner," she confides. "But that's why I came here. I know you 
won't miss anything, Dr. Tabsh." 
</P>
<P>
With that, he walks her to his door. And, awkwardly, he says goodby in a way 
that is at once professional and personal. Standing beside her, he places an 
arm over her shoulder and squeezes it. It's his version of a hug. 
</P>
<P>
TABSH IS a handsome, bespectacled man with dark, questioning eyes and black 
hair offset by a shock of gray up front. More often than not, he wears a white 
doctor's coat that bears the name of a retired UCLA faculty member, which he 
covers with a strip of adhesive tape -- a sign both of his quirky sense of 
humor and of his new-kid-on-the-block position at UCLA. At times, he looks more 
boyish than any graying man ought to look; at other times, especially when his 
glasses are off while he rubs his eyes, he looks monumentally tired. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what prompted him to become a doctor, a half smile ducks across his face, 
and he replies: "My mother. She wanted a doctor in the family." 
</P>
<P>
Brusque though polite, he grudgingly agreed to be interviewed for this article, 
and even then, scheduling time for a meeting proved almost impossible. The only 
time he would sit still long enough for an interview was when he had little 
choice -- in an airplane on his way back from a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Those who know him best see him in starkly contrasting ways. 
</P>
<P>
"People are misled by his outer core," says his mentor, John C. Hobbins, 
professor of obstetrics at Yale University Medical School and a leader in the 
field of maternal-fetal medicine. "Inside the core, he's a warm, loyal guy who 
can be quite a team player." 
</P>
<P>
"He's not a team player," counters Assali, another mentor. "He's a loner and 
not an easy person to get to know." 
</P>
<P>
To residents, who have a hard time figuring out when he'll show up for rounds, 
he is a brilliant, if elusive, mystery man. To nurses, he's a softie, who 
sometimes crouches in the corner of a room to pray before performing a delicate 
operation. To colleagues, he is diffident, at times arrogant, but always 
available and much respected, though many worry that he is spreading himself 
too thin. To patients, he is "Dr. Amnio" or Dr. Tabsh, pronounced TAB-ISH. His 
first name, Khalil, means lover in Arabic, and he says he wishes people could 
pronounce it correctly, with the guttural ch sound used in Hebrew. But since 
most cannot, he goes by K, just K. 
</P>
<P>
A workaholic, he doesn't smoke, drinks only on social occasions and takes 
vacations almost never. He would do without sleep, too, if he could, although 
he usually sleeps from 10 p.m. until 2 a.m., at which point he rises without an 
alarm clock and catches up on medical journal reading at his Pacific Palisades 
home. His wife complains that he's so compulsive about documenting everything 
in patients' charts that he often gets home at 5 a.m., only to rush out the 
door two hours later. 
</P>
<P>
The last movie he saw, "The Godfather," was in 1973. Reading novels, he says, 
is a waste of time because he "lacks the imagination" to appreciate them. The 
joke circulating around the medical school is how he and his wife, 
anesthesiologist Suha Murad, whom he met in medical school in Beirut, managed 
to produce four children, given his obsessive work habits. 
</P>
<P>
Tabsh, son of a steel importer, was born in Lebanon and is a citizen of Saudi 
Arabia. But he says he plans to become an American citizen one day. He was born 
a Muslim, attended Protestant schools in Beirut and sends his children to 
Catholic school in Brentwood. He says he believes all religions teach the same 
thing: Do no harm. 
</P>
<P>
Educated at American University in Beirut, where he earned his bachelor's 
degree and went to medical school, Tabsh left Lebanon in 1975, soon after the 
civil war broke out there, to attend Yale. Upon completing his residency in New 
Haven, he returned to Beirut -- and lasted all of one week, finding it too 
unsafe to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Although he still adheres to some patriarchal values of the Middle East, such 
as wanting his wife to be home with his children rather than working full time, 
he accepts a different reality. The couple's conflicting work schedules 
preclude their spending much time together (two nannies take care of their 
children), but his wife says they at least talk on the telephone every night. 
</P>
<P>
"The American way of communicating, we don't have," she adds. "K won't come and 
tell me anything, especially about work. We survive with an understanding. An 
American woman would have divorced him a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
THE DILEMMAS doctors like K Tabsh now face daily are inextricably linked to 
abortion. Prenatal diagnosis, after all, is the only type of medical diagnosis 
in which a possible result is intentional death. For that reason, abortion is a 
central issue. But Tabsh adamantly downplays its significance. 
</P>
<P>
"The aim of prenatal diagnosis is not abortion," he says. "The aim is 
diagnosing malformations and abnormalities so patients can be prepared for a 
bad outcome, psychologically and physically." 
</P>
<P>
Deciding what to do in the case of a "bad outcome" is never easy, though some 
cases are more clear-cut than others. Sure candidates for abortion are the most 
severe abnormalities, such as anencephaly, or the disastrous, inherited 
metabolic and chromosomal diseases such as Tay-Sachs disease and Trisomy 13 and 
18, in which an extra chromosome produces severe retardation and babies who 
frequently don't live longer than one year. 
</P>
<P>
But because prenatal screening cannot predict the severity of a defect such as 
Down's syndrome, many couples are thrown into a moral quagmire. Some children 
with Down's lead fairly normal, happy lives, and some suffer a lifetime of 
chronic disability, creating enormous hardship on their families. When faced 
with a diagnosis of Down's, 91% of couples in California elect abortion, 
according to the most recent data compiled by the state Department of Health 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
Tabsh's position on abortion is clear: It is a patient's right to decide. But 
sometimes that rhetoric gives way to his feelings about the grim realities of 
second-trimester abortions. "When you do a D and E (dilation and elimination), 
it's a gross procedure," he says. "You grab the baby and pull the baby out. 
You're pulling arms and legs; the baby comes out in pieces. It's a sickening 
procedure." 
</P>
<P>
Personally, he does not perform abortions as part of his practice, except for 
selective terminations of multiple pregnancies -- which usually involve 
far-less-developed fetuses. He distinguishes the two types of abortions, saying 
second-trimester procedures are used to end an unwanted pregnancy whereas his 
selective terminations are saving a desperately wanted infant. 
</P>
<P>
But what of the patient who simply doesn't want to carry twins? Or a couple 
that decides to terminate a triplet based on sex? His own ethics dictate that 
he will not reveal the sex of a fetus nor reduce healthy twins to singletons. 
And, like other doctors performing pregnancy reductions, he leaves the woman 
with twins whenever possible. He says he does it partly because it leaves a 
margin for error and partly because he wants to save every normal fetus that he 
can. Triplet pregnancies are in a gray area because medical data is scant. 
Tabsh has delivered some healthy triplets but has also seen many suffer from 
prematurity. Finally, the patient and her family must decide whether to choose 
abortion, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't decide these things," he explains. "If it were up to me, I'd probably 
decide against it. I'm just a technician." 
</P>
<P>
Tabsh follows one other ground rule before performing the procedure at 
Northridge Hospital, a UCLA-affiliated hospital. He has taken the unprecedented 
step of insisting that patients meet with the hospital ethics committee to 
ensure a fully informed consent. 
</P>
<P>
The first doctors who performed selective terminations did so during the second 
trimester to abort one of a pair of fetal twins afflicted with Down's syndrome. 
Now, the stakes are changing. When the procedure is done to reduce the number 
of fetuses, it is done early in the pregnancy, before it is possible to detect 
genetic anomalies. That creates new worries. 
</P>
<P>
After he terminated one fetus in a set of triplets not long ago, lab tests 
revealed that the aborted triplet had Down's syndrome. It could have gone the 
other way. "I'm sure one day somebody's going to terminate a normal baby and 
leave an abnormal one behind," Tabsh says. "It's one of the problems we face 
with this (procedure)." 
</P>
<P>
For both patient and doctor, the moral ambiguity lingers long after an 
irreversible decision is made. And both find ways to live with the questions 
that will not be put to rest. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Embree, 33, a former patient of Tabsh's who helped create a support 
group for patients facing such decisions, was carrying twins when Tabsh 
discovered that one of them was suffering from hydrocephalus at 23 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
If the affected twin continued to grow, Tabsh told her, it could stunt the 
growth of the healthy one. On the other hand, terminating the baby with 
hydrocephalus could traumatize the other and result in losing both babies. The 
legal cutoff for an abortion was days away, and she and her husband had to 
decide over the weekend whether to agree to a selective termination. 
</P>
<P>
"We said to Dr. Tabsh, 'Help us decide,' " she recalls. "He said, 'You and your 
husband have to make the decision.' And I really appreciate that. He doesn't 
inflict moral values on patients." 
</P>
<P>
The Embrees elected termination for "Twin A." "Twin B" was born just two weeks 
later, weighing in at a scant 1 pound, 15 ounces. She was named in honor of the 
physician who delivered her after ending the life of her sister. Erica Tabsh 
Embree is now a healthy 2-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Embree often warns people who are considering a termination that there 
is residual pain. "I'll be at the mall now and see twins. I'll get that trigger 
inside. It can hurt. That baby was mine and I grieved for her." 
</P>
<P>
But when the time is right, she plans on telling her daughter about her start 
in life. And she will show her the ultrasound pictures, taken in utero, of 
twins who shared bloodlines. 
</P>
<P>
Tabsh's world is filled with the pain and joys of hundreds of parents like the 
Embrees. "Almost every day, you have to break bad news to one of these 
patients," he says, drawing a deep breath. "It's a catastrophe when you tell a 
patient: 'Your baby has anomalies, and some of these anomalies are not 
compatible with life.' 
</P>
<P>
"But sometimes, some come in with a problem and end up delivering a healthy 
baby. And that's my reward." 
</P>
<P>
No doubt the sweetest reward came with the birth of one of his own children. 
When his wife was pregnant with their fourth child, the amniocentesis results 
were normal. But 24 weeks into her pregnancy, Tabsh turned on his ultrasound 
machine to take a peek. And what he saw worried him. 
</P>
<P>
It was a tiny bubble, later diagnosed as a bowel obstruction. But he knew the 
defect could be corrected surgically after delivery. The ultrasound exam 
allowed them to make arrangements with specialists for surgery soon after 
birth. Without it, Tarek, their Nintendo-loving 4-year-old, might not be alive 
today. 
</P>
<P>
For Tabsh, it is reason enough to accept any moral conflict, to take the good 
with the bad.

DECOUPAGE

<TEXT>
<P>
AT FIRST GLANCE,most decoupage looks like schoolroom art for Mother's Day. 
Paper or foil cutouts are pasted on a surface in a "decorative arrangement" and 
shellacked in place. 
</P>
<P>
At second glance -- preferably in a book that deals with the early history of 
this French art -- decoupage is revealed in its intricate, stunning beauty. It 
was not always trays and lunch boxes; in the beginning there were tables, 
chairs, chests of drawers, screens and cradles, all beautiful enough to furnish 
a palace. And if a particular cutout was not everything that was needed for a 
desired effect, the artist added paint or watercolors, shadowing and enhancing 
the pasted-on pieces. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of its French name, decoupage reached its zenith in 18th-Century Italy 
as the arte povero, or poor man's art, designed to look like Oriental lacquer 
work; large pieces of furniture were almost covered with cutouts. Scrapbooks 
printed with pictures meant for decoupage were widely available until the 20th 
Century. National distinctions, based on the colors and kinds of papers used, 
became evident: earth tones in Sweden, bright colors in Sicily. 
</P>
<P>
Today's decoupeurs often use pictures from magazines, greeting cards and 
wrapping papers, which may explain why the craft has survived: The materials 
are inexpensive and accessible and require glue and acrylic spray (as a 
varnish) to anchor the cutouts. 
</P>
<P>
Currently available books, from Dover Publications, are "The Picture Sourcebook 
for Collage and Decoupage," by Edmund Gillon, and "The Cornucopia of Design 
&amp; Illustration for Decoupage," by Eleanor Rawlings. Order through your 
local bookstore or directly from Dover Publications Inc., 31 E. 2nd St., 
Mineola, N.Y. 11501.

I note that Wambaugh tends to blame attorneys for his legal problems ("The 
Crimes of Joseph Wambaugh," by Sean Mitchell, Feb. 26). I believe in and would 
defend Wambaugh's right to write about any subject, fiction or nonfiction, that 
inspires him. In exercising this right, your article estimates, Wambaugh 
realizes a return of about $1 million per book. Obviously, Wambaugh would like 
to keep exercising this right both as an expression of his creative freedom as 
well as for economic gain. On the other hand, when certain individuals feel 
abused by Wambaugh's work, he would deny them the right to seek redress.

Wambaugh concedes that maybe we are too free as a nation, that we may have to 
curtail our freedoms to a certain extent. At present, the Second Amendment 
right to keep and bear arms is abused to the point that this area is a 
battlefield. We need to leave the military assault weapons to the military and 
exercise the Second Amendment rights in a reasonable manner.

SERVICE WITH A SCOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The good news is that Lee Green's article, "Service With a Scowl" (March 5), 
made me laugh more than once as I read of his encounters with various rude 
retailers. The bad news is he's right. A polite consumer doesn't stand a chance 
against abrasive retailers. Thus, one is forced to resort to similar behavior 
to survive. And so, the vicious circle continues; rude retailers create rude 
consumers, and on and on. Prof. Jerald Jellison could have helped by offering 
some suggestions on how to effectively diffuse such hostile confrontation 
between consumers and retailers. Then, maybe, we would have a "kinder, gentler" 
marketplace.

ZAN THOMPSON: MOUNT ST. MARY'S AND HER SISTER MAGDALEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Zan Thompson

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I was a student at Mount St. Mary's on Chalon Road, the nuns told us to 
remember Estelle Doheny in our prayers. We blessed her for building the road up 
to the Mount, a tortuous, narrow strip of blacktop leading clear to the top. On 
a rainy day, with a wild wind blowing in from the ocean, it even gave an almost 
dauntless 16-year-old girl driving an old Cadillac a turn or two. It could be a 
scary road, but not as much when you knew it like we did, every rut and 
outcropping, every curve where the edge was sliding down into the canyon a 
little bit. 
</P>
<P>
Now the road to the Mount is a safe and proper road, but it still employs the 
grading and excavation that Mrs. Doheny bought for us. 
</P>
<P>
I thought of this when I attended the recent dinner and the evening at the 
Doheny Mansion on Chester Place in honor of Sister Magdalen Coughlin, who was 
putting her final imprimatur on 13 years as president of Mount St. Mary's 
College, which crowns a mountain in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Actually there are two campuses, the almost 70-year-old, four-year liberal arts 
college on Chalon Road and the two-year college known as the Doheny Campus on 
Chester Place near downtown Los Angeles. Since 1958, the Sisters of St. Joseph 
of Carondolet have directed the latter as a second campus of Mount St. Mary's. 
On the Chester Place campus, seven magnificent old homes rich with detail and 
architectural fillips are now classrooms, administrative offices and 
dormitories for the school. 
</P>
<P>
At the party, about 500 people walked between the beautiful rooms of the Doheny 
mansion. Mrs. Doheny's generosity in giving the residence into the guardianship 
of the St. Joseph of Carondolet sisters has proven a good choice. They have 
preserved and protected and enhanced the magnificence of her residence. The 
Pompeian Room is named for the grandeur of the ancient city, which is its 
model. The floor and marble pillars are from Italy, Spain and Africa. I love to 
be there and, lucky me, I have been several times for elegant occasions. I 
always feel like one of the Medici ladies -- the short-waisted one without the 
poison in her ring. 
</P>
<P>
I have rejoiced in the friendship of Sister Magdalen for about 10 years. She is 
a remarkable lady. She is a member of so many boards and committees, it's silly 
to name them. And the important thing is that the other members of these bodies 
each think that Sister devotes her time unstintingly to that one. She does. She 
seems to have found some marvelous, bottomless sea of time and energy so that 
everything she turns her hand to gets her complete attention. 
</P>
<P>
At the Mount and at Doheny, the young women are given a boundless feeling of 
self-worth and a feeling that they can do anything they set their minds to. 
This is a mirror image of Sister Magdalen. She has done so many things while 
she has been college president that seemed impossible. 
</P>
<P>
When I was a student at the college, we were mostly Irish -- Pat O'Connor, Lee 
Fitzgerald, Helene Breen, Genevieve Regan and the Borchard and McGrath girls 
from Oxnard. And Virginia and Dor Meyer from Chicago whose mother's name was 
Connor. Now, the MSM ethnic balance almost matches that of Southern California. 
The young women are 42% Anglo, 34% Latino, 13% Asian and 10% black. 
</P>
<P>
Three-quarters of the students who start the two-year program at Doheny finish 
and three-quarters of those finish with a four-year degree from the Chalon 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
They do it because they receive such reinforcement from Sister Magdalen and all 
of the faculty. 
</P>
<P>
All of the St. Joseph sisters have had that ability to make you think you could 
do it when you knew you couldn't. It must come with their vows. We were 
Depression kids and we thought there was no way we could all hang in and get 
through school. We did, though. And even a couple of the nuns in our day who 
never had a kind word at least put iron in our spines for the road ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Sister Magdalen left for Rome the morning after the dinner as a member of a 
group of 18 educators who would meet with Pope John Paul II concerning 
education in the United States. It is a signal honor and she will distinguish 
the group. 
</P>
<P>
You will be glad to know that the great pair of stone lions on the entrance 
steps into the Doheny mansion are napping as peacefully as ever. Someone must 
have told them Sister Magdalen will still be around, keeping it all together.

<P>
I must protest your choice of material in the View section April 12 and 13. 
First, we were treated to a photo of hangmen's nooses and an article that 
started out in a deceptively reasonable tone but went on to a gruesome level of 
detail about what happens in a hanging ("Mystery Hangman Sets Off a Washington 
Controversy" by Ann Japenga). 
</P>
<P>
Then, the next day, the first page of the View section features some truly 
stomach-churning photos of disgusting dolls ("Foul Play" by Beverly Beyette). 
</P>
<P>
One reason I buy a morning paper is to have something pleasant to read over 
breakfast. Leaving the first section and editorials until the evening, I reach 
first for View to read the comics, Dear Abby and Ann Landers and some amusing 
or enlightening stories on health and human interest. 
</P>
<P>
Nauseating dolls and the biomechanics of hanging are not what I consider 
suitable material for the breakfast table, nor for much of any purpose to be 
truthful. Please exercise some judgment. If we want to be subjected to sordid 
or depressing material, there is no dearth of sources.

THOUGHTS ON LIFE OF DAREDEVIL KNIEVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Strangely, I never found the egocentric antics of Evel Knievel of compelling 
interest; he was more to be pilloried than sensationalized, I always thought 
("Evel Doings" by Bob Sipchen, April 14). 
</P>
<P>
As a friend of Knievel's victim (talented entertainment exec Shelly Saltman of 
Calabasas) I found Knievel's boast ironic: The man "I hit with a baseball bat . 
. . never got a dime." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps this case typifies what's wrong with our judicial system: Knievel's 
assault victim wins a $12.7-million judgment, but can't collect. Meanwhile, 
this colorful south end of a horse headed north goes merrily on his way, 
freeloading off his son's exploits. 
</P>
<P>
There's a happy ending, however. His victim has his home, a lovely wife and 
children, respect of his peers -- and a clear conscience. Knievel has none of 
those, only a few expensive trinkets he was able to mooch off others. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe justice does work, after all.

IT'S OK TO FUDGE A BIT ON NORTHERN MICHIGAN TRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
INDIAN RIVER, Mich. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the late 1800s, wealthy families from Ohio and other Midwest states would 
travel by rail, boat and horse-drawn wagons through rugged wilderness to reach 
this tiny lakeside town in northern Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Today the rustic community is not much bigger, still set among seemingly 
endless stands of pine trees and an intricate system of serene rivers and 
lakes. But now it is easily accessible and more than living up to the Michigan 
slogan, "Water Wonderland." 
</P>
<P>
Indian River lies at the southern tip of Burt and Mullet lakes, two of the 
largest lakes in the state, about a four-hour drive north of Detroit. It is a 
center for water sports and outdoor activities, from fishing and bicycling to 
canoeing and boating. (The annual National Championship Outboard Marathon Races 
will be held on Indian River Aug. 12-13.) 
</P>
<P>
Because northern Michigan is almost as well known for its fudge as its vacation 
appeal, visitors have come to be known as "fudgies" by the locals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Via Highway or River 
</P>
<P>
Luckily for the fudgies, northern Michigan is easy to navigate by land or 
water. The main highway, Interstate 75, extends from one end of the state to 
the other, passing through Indian River and into the Upper Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
To get a feel for the area's rugged past, the adventurous shouldn't miss taking 
a canoe trip down the Sturgeon River. The Sturgeon wriggles its way across 
wilderness, through Indian River and into Burt Lake. There are two canoe 
liveries in town, and because both are owned by the same family, the rates are 
identical and so are the routes. 
</P>
<P>
Viewing the scenery is exhilarating, but the canoe ride is occasionally rough 
where fallen trees have created challenging obstacles. Fudgies and other novice 
paddlers should start with a one-hour trip, allowing time to bail out the 
canoe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fishing Boat -- or Pontoon 
</P>
<P>
For those who prefer a more substantial craft, River Junction Marina on the 
Indian River rents fishing boats and equipment, Burt Lake Marina and Crooked 
River Marina (in nearby Alanson) rent pontoons. Indian River, a long, 
meandering connection between Burt Lake and Mullet Lake, is a popular route for 
fishing or sightseeing. 
</P>
<P>
At piers along the way the boater can buy gas and supplies. One pier belongs to 
Pinehurst Inn in Indian River, a rustic bar/motel that's more widely known for 
its lounge, food and, on some evenings, live entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
If seasickness should set in, there's Burt Lake State Beach, where landlubbers 
can camp or picnic beneath the pines on Burt Lake or sunbathe on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
But outdoor recreation isn't the only draw at Indian River. It also can be used 
as a central base to visit the Upper Peninsula and other northern Michigan 
attractions. 
</P>
<P>
Within a 45-minute drive are historic St. Ignace and Mackinaw City, both 
gateways to Mackinac Island. And 1 1/2 hours away are the Soo Locks in Sault 
Ste. Marie, a hub of trade and shipping activity in the mid-1800s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Home-Style Cooking 
</P>
<P>
When dining in northern Michigan you'll notice that portions are plentiful and 
inexpensive. A good place in Indian River for a home-style meal is 
Christopher's, where most meals are under $10. 
</P>
<P>
Waterfront lodging in Indian River runs about $30 to $40 a night; campgrounds 
include Burt Lake State Park, Spring Lake (formally KOA) and Jelly Stone Park. 
</P>
<P>
If a rustic motel in the woods or cottage on the river isn't your idea of a 
vacation, St. Ignace and Mackinaw City are larger towns where Best Westerns and 
Ramada Inns will take you out of the woods. 
</P>
<P>
Mackinaw City is the northernmost city of the lower peninsula (at the "tip of 
the mitt"); St. Ignace is the southernmost of the Upper Peninsula. The 
8,614-foot suspension Mackinac Bridge, "Mighty Mac" over the Straits of 
Mackinac, connects the two peninsulas where Lakes Michigan and Huron meet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
View of the Island 
</P>
<P>
St. Ignace is a little less congested and easier to navigate than Mackinaw 
City. A cluster of contemporary beachfront motels, on State Street overlooking 
Lake Huron, offer a clear view of Mackinac Island for $48 to $86 a night. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby is Al's Pancake House, once a private home, on a hill with an impressive 
view of Mackinac Island. Blueberry pancakes made with fresh blueberries, 
sausage gravy with homemade biscuits and three-egg omelets make it tough to eat 
a light breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
From St. Ignace or Mackinaw City the public ferry lines -- Shepler's, Arnold's 
or Star Line -- take you on the 15-minute ride to Mackinac Island. All charge 
$9 for adults and $5.75 for children 6-12, round trip. 
</P>
<P>
Setting foot on Mackinac Island is like taking a step into the past, when Ft. 
Mackinac stood guard over the bustling northern fur trade. No motorized 
vehicles are allowed on the island. Transportation is by foot, bicycle or 
horse-drawn taxis. 
</P>
<P>
Fort tours are $5.50 for adults and $2.75 for children. Guides dressed in 
American Army uniforms (the fort changed hands several times between the 
French, British and Americans during its 115-year military history) give 
demonstrations of cannon and musket firings and tours of the barracks, school, 
supply house and commanding officer's home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Landmark Grand Hotel 
</P>
<P>
Another popular island landmark is the Grand Hotel, made famous in the film 
"Somewhere in Time." The hotel still maintains its formal air, requiring men to 
wear ties and jackets to dinner. It costs $5 to enter the hotel and tour the 
grounds. Rooms at the Grand range from $230 to $400. 
</P>
<P>
Without quite the prestige of the Grand Hotel, but putting forth the effort, is 
the recently remodeled Mission Point Resort, which until 1970 housed Mackinac 
College. Breakfast and dinner are included for the average $170 room rate. 
Facilities include a swimming pool, three tennis courts and bike rental. 
</P>
<P>
Among a dozen or so bed and breakfast homes on the island is the Metivier Inn. 
The three-story Victorian home, built in 1877, offers several turret rooms with 
a view of the straits from $84 to $145. 
</P>
<P>
The Windermere, built in 1887, is one of several waterfront hotels. It was 
turned into a hotel by Patrick Doud in 1905 and is still operated by the Doud 
family. Cost for two, $110 to $120. 
</P>
<P>
(Some rates are higher during the July 15-17 Chicago-to-Mackinac and July 22-24 
Port Huron-to-Mackinac sailboat races.) 
</P>
<P>
Most of the island's hotels are within a couple of blocks of Main Street, where 
souvenir, specialty shops and restaurants are intermingled with a dozen or so 
fudge shops. There are several bike liveries, and the scenic three-mile ride 
around the island's shore offers some pleasant diversion. 
</P>
<P>
You can easily spend a day on Mackinac Island, and the same is true of Sault 
Ste. Marie. It's less than an hour north of St. Ignace and is the oldest town 
in the state. It offers a wealth of information about the state's history and 
one of the most important waterways in the nation, the Soo Locks. 
</P>
<P>
A two-hour boat tour goes through the locks, the only waterway connecting Lake 
Superior to the other Great Lakes. Before the locks were built, anyone 
traveling or shipping on the lakes had to portage their canoes or cargo around 
the St. Mary's River rapids. To complicate matters, Lake Superior is 21 feet 
higher than Lake Huron. 
</P>
<P>
Near the locks is an information center, offering some history of the area and 
a miniature model that demonstrates how boats are lowered and raised from Lake 
Superior and Lake Huron.

CUTTING FLOWERS FIND THEIR PLACE IN THE SUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ELLEN GUFFEY, Mary Ellen Guffey grows flowers for cutting in Malibu. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cutting gardens used to be like vegetable plots, separated from the flower 
border, planted in utilitarian straight rows and generally accorded 
second-class status. 
</P>
<P>
But, today, cutting flowers have come out of the closet. And why not? They're 
pretty in vases and lovely in borders as well. 
</P>
<P>
Were I allowed to grow only one summer flower, and it had to decorate both the 
house and the garden, I would choose gloriosa daisy (Rudbeckia hirta). 
Developed from black-eyed Susans, these cone-centered blooms measure 4 to 7 
inches across and come in shades of gold, orange, brown and deep bronze. 
</P>
<P>
I'm growing from seed Rudbeckia Green Eyes, a tetraploid (four sets of 
chromosomes instead of the usual two) that promises 5-inch blooms with 
yellow-pointed petals and olive-green eyes. Maybe it's silly to grow gloriosas 
from seed when I have dozens of volunteers coming up from previous years crops. 
Although these self-sown seedlings are excellent plants, unlike some volunteers 
that revert to wild status, I couldn't resist those Green Eyes. Next year, 
perhaps, I'll try Nutmeg, which the catalogue assures will produce double 
blooms in rich autumnal hues. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, I'm not limited to just one selection, so my cutting garden will 
include blooms that complement gloriosa daisies, such as blue salvia (S. 
farinacea), blanketflower (Gaillardia) and tall marigolds. Another choice for 
summer bouquets is the perennial yarrow (Achillea, "Cloth of Gold"), with its 
flat, mustard-colored, long-lasting blooms. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing with sunny colors for the cutting garden is a new cosmos called 
Golden Goddess (Bidens ferulaefolia) that I'm growing from seed and should be 
showing color soon. The catalogue of Thompson &amp; Morgan, British seeds men 
who have obviously acquired Yankee marketing skills, describes Golden Goddess 
splendiferously: 
</P>
<P>
"Blooms en masse unabated from June through December, covers itself with 2 
1/2-inch flowers of classic natural symmetry, assumes perennial appearance and 
quality, blooms profusely for cutting and bedding, tolerates heat and resists 
pests and diseases." If it's even half that good, I'll be satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
Another new summer bloomer is coreopsis Early Sunrise, a shorter, earlier 
version of the prize-winning Sunray. Although just released this year, Early 
Sunrise is available as small plants in nurseries, so you won't have to grow it 
from seed. 
</P>
<P>
In arranging coreopsis, cosmos and other flowers with wiry stems, I like to 
crumple some chicken wire for the mouth of the vase. Amazing how well it holds 
flowers in place for casual, country bouquets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flower Arranger's Tips 
</P>
<P>
Gudy Kimmel, an accredited flower show judge who also teaches flower arranging 
at Harbor College and South Coast Botanic Gardens, gave me tips for summer 
bouquets. 
</P>
<P>
Kimmel favors small blooms, such as border carnations, miniature gladiola and 
garden pinks. She finds it difficult to work with huge flowers, such as giant 
dahlias, preferring instead dahlia pompon varieties or dwarf semi-double forms. 
</P>
<P>
One of Kimmel's favorites for the summer cutting garden is montbretia 
(Crocosmia x crocosmiiflora), a South African bulb with swordlike leaves and 
long-stemmed flowers in orange, yellow and red tones. Although these bulbs 
cannot be found in every garden center, two sources are Green Thumb Nursery in 
Canoga Park and Burkhard's in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the best of the new flowers for arranging, according to Kimmel, is 
lisianthus (Eustoma grandiflorum). Developed from prairie wildflowers, 
lisianthus is a flower arranger's joy, staying attractive in a vase 10 days or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these cutting flower selections can be planted immediately to take 
advantage of our normally cool, overcast weather in May and June. Not only will 
they get off to a good start, but they will provide color in late summer when 
nearly everything else is gone.

HOT PROPERTY: 'HOT LIPS' KISSING MANSION GOODBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LORETTA SWIT, probably best known for her television role as nurse "Hot Lips" 
Houlihan in MASH, and her husband, actor Dennis Holahan, have put their Bel-Air 
house on the market. 
</P>
<P>
"They're selling to get something smaller or more manageable," said Joe Coons 
of Merrill Lynch/Rodeo Realty, who shares the $2,495,000 listing with Merrill 
Lynch's Beverlywood office. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Fe-style house has three bedrooms and maids' quarters. The 2.2-acre 
property has a lot of privacy, Coons said, with its 300-foot-long driveway and 
eucalyptus and pine trees. It also has a pool. 
</P>
<P>
The recently remodeled house is about 25 years old, and Swit and Holahan have 
owned it for two. Coons described the Bel-Air home as "a showplace, like a 
gentleman's ranch house with an early-California flair." 
</P>
<P>
The SULTAN OF BRUNEI has purchased two new houses next to his Beverly Hills 
Hotel, sources say. No wonder both houses were painted pink, like the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The houses are really like one home, because there are steps between them, both 
are Mediterranean in style and they are behind gates. The compound -- with a 
total of eight bedrooms and 18,000 square feet on almost 2 acres -- sold for 
more than $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
A real estate agent who asked for anonymity said the sultan bought the houses, 
just behind the hotel, "so he can get service from the hotel without taking up 
hotel rooms."

When the sultan bought the hotel, he had plans to close it in increments for 
remodeling, but no rooms have been closed "because the hotel is running at a 
high occupancy, anyway," another source said. The sultan bought the hotel in 
October, 1987, for about $186 million. 
</P>
<P>
James Northcutt is decorating the sultan's compound, which was a project of 
Columbia Residential Development.

The race is on at Hollywood Park for WALDO FERNANDEZ, who has designed homes 
for Merv Griffin and other celebrities as well as the ballroom of Griffin's 
Beverly Hilton, to complete new interiors for the Turf Club and Directors Wing 
by Wednesday, opening day of thoroughbred racing. 
</P>
<P>
Marge Everett, chairman and chief executive officer of Hollywood Park, chose 
Fernandez to redo the rooms. The decor of the 1938 landmark hadn't been touched 
since the early 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
The 30,000-square-foot Turf Club is being transformed into an English hunting 
club setting, with dark wood paneling, red booths and brown carpet with 
polished brass trim. The 15,000-square-foot Directors Wing, above the Turf 
Club, is being redecorated in blue and white with a powder-blue patterned 
carpet and light blue, white and gray wall coverings. 
</P>
<P>
Among the regulars at the Turf Club, are Marvin Davis, Richard Pryor, Carole 
and Burt Bacharach, Walter Matthau, Jackie Collins, Tim Conway, John Forsythe, 
Jill St. John, Jack Klugman -- and Merv.

Good news for preservationists, and timely -- since the California Preservation 
Foundation is winding up its conference today at the Biltmore Hotel: 
</P>
<P>
Sale of a 60-year-old, 5-acre villa in Silver Lake to a developer who might 
have razed it, has fallen through, and the property, designated a city landmark 
last October as a means of saving it for another six months, is for sale again. 
</P>
<P>
Christie McAvoy, preservation officer for the Los Angeles Conservancy, said, 
"We're real interested that it's back on the market, and we'll be looking to 
see if we can interest some people in preserving the buildings." 
</P>
<P>
The villa, at 1923 Micheltorena St., was built by silent-movie star Antonio 
Moreno. It is owned by the Franciscan Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate 
Conception, who operated a home there for wayward and homeless girls from the 
1950s until the October, 1987 earthquake left cracks in the main building. 
</P>
<P>
CITY COUNCILMAN MICHAEL WOO has said that the estate "probably has more 
potential for a sensitive, adaptive reuse than any property within a 5-mile 
radius of downtown." It also has been termed ideal for an AIDS hospice. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Verguzco at Valley View Realty Inc. in San Fernando has the listing at 
$6.5 million but said, "There is an urgent need to sell, and the sisters are 
open to offers because they need to build a preschool in Sylmar for the poor 
living in the northeastern part of the San Fernando Valley."

BRAND BOULEVARD REVIVAL RAISING GLENDALE SKYLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID M. KINCHEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The long-awaited revival of Glendale's Brand Boulevard is under way, but the 
ground-hugging street of the past is being transformed into a high-rise 
corridor. 
</P>
<P>
Construction has started on what will be the city's tallest building, as well 
as a mid-rise office/retail/entertainment complex near the massive Glendale 
Galleria. The long-vacant 4-acre site north of the Galleria will be home to a 
twin-tower complex being developed by a unit of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Just about the only remnant of Brand's previous life as the city's major 
north-south retail street will be its distinctive diagonal parking. 
</P>
<P>
This spurt of construction activity should reinforce Glendale's position as the 
third-ranking financial center in California, behind Los Angeles and San 
Francisco, according to William R. Boyd of the Glendale office of Coldwell 
Banker Commercial Real Estate Services. 
</P>
<P>
"Financial service companies, including thrifts and insurance companies, occupy 
about 40% of the 3.14 million square feet of office space in Glendale," Boyd 
said. "An additional 40% is taken by service businesses, including law firms 
and accountants." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vacant Lot Question 
</P>
<P>
Last week's approval of Glendale City Center by the Glendale Redevelopment 
Agency answers those who had wondered: "What's going to be built in that vacant 
lot north of the Glendale Galleria?" 
</P>
<P>
The more than $150-million, 790,000-square-foot office/retail project will be 
constructed, beginning in September, in the block bounded by Brand Boulevard on 
the east, Broadway on the south, Orange Street on the west and Wilson Avenue on 
the north. 
</P>
<P>
A project of Homart Development Co., a subsidiary of Sears, Glendale City 
Center will feature twin office towers separated by an elaborate landscaped 
courtyard, according to Gino Rossetti, president of Rossetti Associates, Santa 
Monica, the architects. 
</P>
<P>
An 18-story tower will be built in the first phase atop a parking/retail 
structure, followed by a 22-story tower north of it in the second phase, 
Rossetti said. The leasing agent for Glendale City Center is the Glendale 
office of Coldwell Banker. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street from Glendale City Center, construction has started on Brand 
Passage, the first of two elements of The Exchange, a $50-million mixed-use. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
22-Story Building 
</P>
<P>
The Exchange, designed by the Feola/Deenihan Partnership AIA, Glendale, 
occupies two blocks bounded by Brand Boulevard, Wilson Avenue, Louise Street 
and Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
About three blocks north of The Exchange, construction is under way with a May, 
1990, completion on 500 N. Brand, a 22-story, 423,000-square-foot office tower 
by a joint venture of the Glendale-based Howard-Platz Group, Glendale 
Properties and General Electric Investment Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The $110-million 500 N. Brand is reportedly the largest 100% speculative office 
building under construction in the Southland, according to Richard Dunn of the 
Charles Dunn Co., the leasing agent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
20% Vacancy Level 
</P>
<P>
"In an office market running at a 20% vacancy level, Glendale is now 
approaching the single-digit range," Dunn added. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by Ellerbe Beckett, Santa Monica, the 332-foot-high granite-clad tower 
at Brand Boulevard and Milford Street will be Glendale's tallest building. 
</P>
<P>
The building will have 18,500 square feet of retail space in a two-story 
pavilion. There will be three levels of below-grade parking, along with five 
levels above ground. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled for completion in December, Brand Passage by the Howard-Platz Group 
is a four-story building at 130 N. Brand Blvd. with about 15,000 square feet of 
retail space, 40,000 square feet of offices and an 8,500-square-foot multilevel 
courtyard. The mixed-use development will extend street to street from Brand 
east to Maryland Avenue. The leasing agent is Dorn Platz &amp; Co., Glendale. 
The contractor is Rowland Constructors, Phoenix, with tenant improvements by 
Howard Building Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Construction is scheduled to begin in mid-May on the second increment of The 
Exchange, an eight-screen Mann Theater complex by Brand Development Co. at 130 
N. Maryland Ave. The three-level complex will be highlighted -- literally -- by 
a 22-foot diameter antique, lighted glass dome that will be visible from many 
locations in downtown Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the eight auditoriums will have a Lucas THX sound system, and several 
will be have 70-mm. projection systems. The complex is scheduled for a 
first-quarter 1990 opening. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale Redevelopment Agency is building a 742-space parking structure -- 
scheduled for completion in June -- adjacent to The Exchange, according to a 
spokeswoman for the agency. Feola/Deenihan is the architect for the structure.

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County and City of Industry have settled a 1988 lawsuit challenging 
the city's attempt to declare 600 acres of city-owned pastureland a blight on 
the community in order to declare it a redevelopment zone. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors agreed not to challenge the inclusion of the land just 
north of the Pomona (60) and Orange (57) freeways in a redevelopment zone if 
the city will forward to the county its full 57% share of property tax on new 
development. The tax on new construction in a renewal zone usually goes to a 
city's redevelopment agency. 
</P>
<P>
Industry projects about 7.2 million square feet of new construction over a 
35-year period in the disputed parcel. Industry City Atty. Graham A. Ritchie 
said that the parcel is exempt from a state law requiring that new 
redevelopment zones be 80% urban and blighted because it is publicly owned.

NEWS BRIEFS: LIGHT-RAIL ROUTE

<TEXT>
<P>
Pasadena's Board of Directors -- the city's name for its City Council -- has 
selected the Foothill (210) Freeway as the route for an east-west light-rail 
line through the city. 
</P>
<P>
The action discards two routes that have attracted strong opposition from 
property and business owners on Green Street. One of the routes would have 
turned Green Street into a transit mall and the other would have put rail cars 
on both Green Street and Colorado Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
City Director Rick Cole said choice of the Foothill Freeway corridor was 
dictated by the technology being used by the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission, which is building a light-rail line from Long Beach to Los Angeles, 
with plans to extend it to Pasadena.

<P>
The Westside of Los Angeles, as well as the cities of Beverly Hills and West

<P>
A typical two-bedroom apartment in Westwood rents for $1,500 a month, requiring 
an annual salary of about $60,000, according to John F. Carpenter of the firm's

interested in building apartments and investors seeking to buy them. 
</P>
<P>
Typical two-bedroom apartments in Brentwood and Beverly Hills rent for $1,450 a 
month. The same size unit rents for $1,250 in West Hollywood and $1,150 in

HANDYMAN Q&amp;A: HOME IMPROVEMENT; 
</P>
<P>
GARAGE SHOULD BE TAILORED TO FAMILY'S SPECIAL NEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDY LANG, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: We are contemplating building a garage next to or joined to our 
house. Can you give us some tips about the location of the garage. Are there 
any rules of thumb we should go by or should we just use our own judgment? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: There are some rules of thumb but the final decision is yours, based on 
the requirements of your family and city regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Your judgment should be tempered by the principal use of the garage aside from 
a place to park the car. If, for instance, the shopper in the family will have 
to carry large grocery bags from the car to the house, an effort should be made 
to locate the garage where there is easy access to the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Consider other factors, such as whether the garage also will be used as a 
workshop, a play area or anything else. Another factor is weather. Will it be 
necessary to protect the garage from winds or rays of the sun? 
</P>
<P>
An attached garage is preferable to a detached one, but if conditions make it 
necessary to have a detached structure, consider the use of a breezeway or some 
other walkway or protected area. 
</P>
<P>
Q: The wooden shingles on the outside of our house are fairly new but have no 
finish at all on them. How can they be finished? 
</P>
<P>
A: An impossible question to answer unless your personal preferences are known. 
What effect are you trying to achieve? The shingles can be stained, painted or 
coated with a preservative, or bleached. Most of the time, people prefer not to 
paint the shingles, yet it is done occasionally when a color change is desired. 
</P>
<P>
Using a finish that allows the grain and texture to show through is a more 
common way of treating them. Should you decide to paint them, use a primer 
recommended by the manufacturer, otherwise you may find the shingle substance 
will "bleed" through. In painting, remember the shingles absorb much of the 
paint. You will need at least two coats of paint over the primer. Apply the 
paint with a brush and put on a heavier coat than you would over ordinary 
siding. 
</P>
<P>
Q: We soon will be moving into a new house or, rather, an old house that will 
be new to us. A friend recommends we have all the locks in the house changed. 
This will be quite an expense and we are sure the owners will turn over to us 
all existing keys. What is your advice? 
</P>
<P>
A: The same as your friend's. There are many people who might have keys to the 
house, among them relatives of the owners as well as several tradesmen. All of 
them may be honest, but keys can fall into the wrong hands inadvertently. The 
locks to all doors that permit entry into the house should be changed. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I recently purchased a second-hand cherry coffee table. I was told by the 
dealer that if I wanted to refinish it, the pores should be filled with a wood 
filler before staining and finishing. After I removed the old finish, I found 
the surface of the wood to be fine-grained. It hardly seems to need a filler. 
But, in view of the advice I got, should I go ahead with the filling of the 
pores? 
</P>
<P>
A: Cherry wood usually is close-grained and does not require the pores be 
filled prior to finishing. The purpose of the filler is to provide a uniform 
surface. If yours already is that way, it would not seem to need any extra 
attention. It is difficult to give you an accurate answer without seeing the 
wood. Do you have a friend or relative who knows something about wood? If so, 
ask his or her opinion about the texture of the wood and whether any filler is 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The techniques of using varnish, shellac, lacquer, stain, sealer, bleach, 
remover, etc., are detailed in Andy Lang's booklet, "Wood Finishing in the 
Home," which can be obtained by sending $1 to Know-How, P.0. Box 477, 
Huntington, N.Y. 11743. Questions of general interest will be answered in the 
column.

DESIGN BLENDS STYLE, AFFORDABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wrapped in an attractive exterior of wood siding accented by brick veneer and 
paned windows, this home is designed for today's housing needs -- in terms of 
both style and affordability. 
</P>
<P>
The approach to the covered entry is graced by a brick planter. The 
side-lighted entry door opens to a spectacular living room, featuring vaulted 
ceilings, an open staircase, a hallway overlook upstairs and a fantastic 
fireplace arrangement. The fireplace unit includes a wood bin with overhead 
shelves to house TV and stereo components. Set off by quarry tile, the 
fireplace serves as a focal point and as a room divider between the living room 
and kitchen/dining area. 
</P>
<P>
The family-sized dining room has French doors opening to the back-yard patio. 
The adjacent kitchen also looks out to the back yard, with three windows placed 
over the sink. The well-appointed kitchen has plenty of built-in storage space 
and is laid out in the popular U shape. 
</P>
<P>
A half-bath and a 7-by-6-foot laundry room are easily reached from the kitchen 
and from the garage entrance. One cost-saving feature is that this area is 
located directly under the two baths on the second floor, reducing plumbing 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
Upstairs, the two smaller bedrooms are separated from the master bedroom suite 
by a full bath with a large linen closet. The large master bedroom includes a 
walk-in closet, a bath with shower and a linen closet. 
</P>
<P>
A balance of style and affordability is achieved with this design, which has a 
total living area of 1,753 square feet, not counting the optional basement of 
853 square feet. In addition to its modest size, the home is designed to reduce 
heating and cooling costs. All exterior walls are insulated to R-23, with R-38 
ceiling insulation and R-30 insulation in the floors. Attention also has been 
given to sizing and positioning the windows to make them as efficient as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>

ADP LEASES 'CUSTOM' BUILDING IN SAN DIMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Automatic Data Processing Inc. has arranged to lease a 200,000-square-foot, 
two-story office building in San Dimas through what is described as "the 
largest build-to-suit office transaction in the San Gabriel Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Total lease consideration was estimated at $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
The ADP division that will occupy the offices is one of the nation's largest 
providers of payroll-related tax filing services. It serves more than 100,000 
employers and processes payroll-tax payments for more than 6 million employees. 
</P>
<P>
The office building is expected to be under construction in June, with 
completion of the first 150,000 square feet in May or June of 1990. The 
additional 50,000 square feet will be designed while work is under way on the 
first phase. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce Construction Co., a subsidiary of Majestic Realty Co., is designing 
and building the structure in the Walnut Creek Business Park, a 45-acre, 
425,000-square-foot project of Majestic Realty. The ADP division occupies space 
in two buildings in the business park, where construction began in 1980.

FENCE FACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For several weeks now, Andy Lang has given misinformation regarding building 
codes in the Southern California area (in general) and Los Angeles in 
particular. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding last week's Handyman Q&amp;A column ("Discuss Fence With Your 
Neighbor"), permits are almost never required for fences, if one stops below 
the 6-foot height in rear and sides, and 30 inches at the front. A variance, 
without a conventional building permit is sufficient if those heights are 
exceeded. 
</P>
<P>
Hope this information is helpful -- before the building departments are flooded 
with requests for fence permits.

DUNNING HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Gordon, you're a good man. How nice you are to fight to save the Dunning 
house when the owner could care less about its future. I give you a lot of 
credit to put so much dedication into a structure that you don't even own. 
</P>
<P>
I live in West Los Angeles, near Santa Monica, and it's so distressing to see 
them tear down quaint bungalows to put in these god-awful modern apartment 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
All anyone cares about now is money. They don't think about the originality or 
history of a building.

<P>
Please encourage anyone who is involved with the Dunning house to let it 
remain. Bend requirements, if necessary, to have it declared a "historic" 
house. So what, if it isn't really. 
</P>
<P>
There is so little of the past that remains in the disposable society of today. 
I love to drive by older, well-kept houses. Not everything in Los Angeles needs 
to be new and palatial.

DUNNING HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My wife and I are in San Diego for the fifth consecutive spring, and read Paul 
Gordon's story about the Dunning house ("Fighting for the Survival of an Old 
House," April 9). If there was ever anything printed in your newspaper with 
human interest, that one should win the prize. 
</P>
<P>
Even out in my country (Montana), somewhat similar conditions have and still 
continue to be developing. And I would think this type of "happening" occurs 
most everywhere throughout our country. Things are continuously lost to 
developers' onslaughts. 
</P>
<P>
I am an architect and continuously look for new jobs, but not at the expense of 
losing our historical ties with the past -- especially the unique and 
irreplaceable past. 
</P>
<P>
I hope that Paul Gordon's message will stir similar feelings in your area.

BREAKING NEW GROUND; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA MONICA USES GREEN THUMB TO PUSH WATER-SAVING GARDENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Silver bells and cockleshells might have done the job in Mary's garden, but in 
Santa Monica, city landscapers have something else in mind. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last few weeks, workers have uprooted the grass in three gardens near 
City Hall and replaced green turf with Australian bluebell creepers, 
bougainvillea and other "drought tolerant" plants. 
</P>
<P>
The $10,000 demonstration project is designed to promote an increasingly 
popular method of gardening called "xeriscape." From the Greek word xeros, for 
dry, xeriscaping uses a combination of stones, mulches and plants that need 
little water. 
</P>
<P>
A xeriscape can save up to 40% of the water that would be used by a 
conventional garden or lawn, officials say. And in Southern California, 50% of 
the average household's water bill goes to outdoor uses. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of xeriscaping has been around for years, but the public -- until 
recently -- resisted exchanging lush green lawns for water-thrifty gardens 
planted with desert flora. Advocates of xeriscaping have had to dispel the 
notion that water-thrifty plants are generally drab and ugly. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to show people that xeriscape landscaping can be nice-looking and 
colorful and not just consist of cacti and sage brush," said Stan Scholl, 
director of General Services for Santa Monica, the office that is overseeing 
the city's xeriscape project. 
</P>
<P>
Although last year's drought -- which led to emergency water-conservation 
measures in dozens of Californian cities -- is now considered over in most of 
the state, water management officials are encouraging homeowners, developers 
and other water users to permanently adopt water-conservation habits, such as 
xeriscaping. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica, a new law requires that xeriscaping be used in all commercial 
and multifamily construction that includes landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
The concept was first developed in Denver. Its slowness in catching on locally 
is perhaps ironic, given the fact that much of Southern California originally 
was an arid land of chaparral and tumbleweed. 
</P>
<P>
But over the decades, hordes of Midwesterners and Easterners moved to Southern 
California, and they wanted the same kind of verdant front yards they had back 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to move people away from that mentality and toward a more 
natural landscape, toward plantings that are native to Southern California and 
to arid zones," said Jay Malinowski, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Water 
District of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The agency, which provides just over half of the water used in Southern 
California, is about to launch a $2-million campaign to promote water 
conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Malinowski said the tide has turned and that people are being persuaded to try 
xeriscaping. A conference on the subject in Orange County drew about 40 
participants five years ago, he said; the same conference this year attracted 
about 600. 
</P>
<P>
"As the word spreads that xeriscaping is less expensive, less labor intensive 
and can be just as pretty, if not prettier, it's becoming very, very popular," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Landscapers point to dozens of species of flowering plants, shrubs, vines and 
even edible crops that can be used in a water-conserving garden. In Santa 
Monica's project, plants include Australian bronze ajuga, blue fescue, eve 
coffeeberry and strawberry trees. 
</P>
<P>
Features that make a plant "drought tolerant" include long roots that can reach 
deep water sources and hairy or thick leaf surfaces that retain water. And some 
plants go semi-dormant in summer. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to using certain species of plants, a xeriscape employs efficient 
irrigation that allows water to permeate the soil before running off and groups 
plants with similar water requirements. It limits grass areas, since turf 
requires a lot more water. 
</P>
<P>
Scholl said the city will offer tours of its xeriscape gardens during Water 
Awareness Week, starting May 1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WATER-THRIFTY PLANTS

ARREST OF GAY MAN STIRS CLAIMS OF INJUSTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man charged with interfering with Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies 
outside a West Hollywood bar last week has accused deputies of mistreating him 
because he is gay. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like they (the deputies) wanted to make an example of me when all I did 
was complain about their mistreatment of someone else," said Edward Michael 
Crawford, 33, of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Rick Cartwright of the sheriff's department said that Crawford, who was 
arrested about 3:15 p.m. Tuesday, threatened deputies who had detained a man on 
the street in view of the Gold Coast Bar, 8228 Santa Monica Blvd., where 
Crawford was a patron. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford, a chauffeur who is a citizen of West Germany, was charged with 
interfering with a peace officer, a misdemeanor, and released on his own 
recognizance. He is to be arraigned May 9 in Beverly Hills Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Cartwright said Crawford came out of the establishment and "began telling 
officers they couldn't do what they were doing" and, after being told to leave, 
"went back into the bar and brought out about six people" who began harassing 
the officers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Different Story 
</P>
<P>
However, Crawford and several other patrons of the bar told a different story. 
</P>
<P>
They accused deputies of unjustly detaining the man who sheriff's officials 
said was reportedly lying in the street, and of provoking a group of mostly gay 
onlookers by "unjustly" arresting Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
"It got very ugly, and it was uncalled for on the part of the deputies," said 
the Rev. Bob Lucas, one of the bar patrons. "They acted as though they had come 
to put down a full-scale riot." 
</P>
<P>
Cartwright said that four patrol cars were called to the scene after the 
arresting officer reported that a crowd had become unruly, but he said that 
"there was absolutely no force used" and that the officers did nothing to 
provoke anyone. 
</P>
<P>
But several of the patrons, angered by what they said was "an unnecessary show 
of force" aimed at members of the gay community, disputed the Sheriff's 
Department's account of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Crawford) never went back into the bar. He was arrested after walking over 
to a pay phone to call the (West Hollywood) sheriff's station and complain 
about what was going on," said Ron Tillinghast, who said he witnessed the 
incident from inside the establishment. 
</P>
<P>
The incident took place on La Jolla Avenue, near Santa Monica Boulevard. The 
bar has windows that face both streets. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials say the stretch of Santa Monica Boulevard where the 
establishment is located is a hot spot for male prostitutes and street 
hustlers, and that it is not uncommon for officers to approach and question 
people who appear to be loitering there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Man Wasn't Arrested 
</P>
<P>
However, Tillinghast and others said that the man whose detention triggered the 
incident was doing nothing to warrant being detained. The man, who was not 
identified, was not arrested. 
</P>
<P>
"He was sitting on a ledge against a bookstore across the street doing nothing 
as far as we could tell," Tillinghast said. "That's what set things off. 
Several of us had been noticing him there before the deputies showed up. People 
inside the bar couldn't believe it when they saw the deputies stop and start 
hassling him." 
</P>
<P>
Crawford said he became upset when he saw the deputies approach the man "for no 
apparent reason" and place him "in a spread-eagle position and begin frisking 
him." 
</P>
<P>
"There was a male and a female officer and the female officer, who appeared to 
be a rookie because the other officer seemed to be instructing her how to 
conduct the spread eagle, was the one actually doing the frisking, which also 
surprised us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford said that he went outside to complain to the deputies about the way 
the man was being treated, and that the male deputy told him to "Get . . . away 
from here, or I'll place you under arrest." 
</P>
<P>
He said that he told the deputy he intended to report the incident to the 
Sheriff's Department, and walked to a public telephone about 60 feet away to 
call the sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
"As I was talking to the dispatcher, trying to tell him what was going on, this 
other deputy who'd driven up about then came over to where I was e and I heard 
the first one (deputy) who'd told me to leave yell to him to detain me. And he 
slammed the handcuffs on me." 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Rudy Walker, who was in charge of the West Hollywood sheriff's station on 
Thursday, said he was unfamiliar with the incident and could offer no details 
beyond those provided by Cartwright. Capt. Rachel Burgess, who heads the 
station, was on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to try the matter in the newspapers," Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lucas, a gay rights activist who has often publicly commended the 
Sheriff's Department for its law enforcement efforts, said he has asked Jack 
Bollen, West Hollywood's public safety coordinator, to forward a formal 
complaint about the incident to the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
"This community is at the boiling point, and I'm talking about gay people who 
perceive that they are often mistreated (by the Sheriff's Department), and then 
you have incidents like this that only reinforce that," he said. "We want the 
city or someone to investigate this."

NO STRANGER TO CAUSES, SHE NOW FIGHTS FROM CITY HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

ALHAMBRA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Barbara Messina sets out on a political mission, there's no stopping her, 
even if she is confronted with threats or public disdain. 
</P>
<P>
Take the case of El Cid, an adult bookstore targeted for closing by community 
groups shortly after it opened on Main Street in 1975. Unfortunately for the 
store owner, Messina headed the picketing campaign, which lasted five years, 
ending only after the store burned down in 1980. Fire officials suspected arson 
but closed the case due to insufficient evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Seven days a week, rain or shine, Messina dispatched picketers to the store, 
where volunteers took one- or two-hour shifts from 9 a.m. to midnight. Messina 
was frequently in the picket line herself, carrying placards and marching 
quietly. 
</P>
<P>
Some passing motorists honked in support, Messina said, whereas others heckled 
them, accusing them of infringing on free speech. 
</P>
<P>
"They took a lot of abuse, especially at night," Messina said of her fellow 
picketers, who were members of a group called People Against Obscenity. On at 
least one occasion, occupants of a passing car "mooned" them, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Influential Councilwoman 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, Messina, 49, is championing her principles from City Hall, where she 
has become influential after 2 1/2 years on the City Council. As a 
councilwoman, she also sits on the redevelopment agency board, and her vote has 
often decided the fate of major Main Street projects crucial to revitalizing 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
She is also a member of a committee that will advise the City Council on the 
development of Valley Boulevard, and as such will play a key role in the 
development of one of the city's key commercial strips. 
</P>
<P>
A short, energetic woman whose black curls are trimmed in an easy-care, 
no-nonsense style, Messina juggles a hectic schedule of family and city 
affairs, dashing from City Hall meetings to ribbon-cutting ceremonies to the 
family's new pizza restaurant, Artino's, which, it is planned, will be renamed 
Messina's Trattoria, or Messina's Little Eatery, to add a family atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1970s, when she was caring for three young daughters, Messina said 
she joined People Against Obscenity after she saw grammar school children being 
allowed inside the adult bookstore. She visited more than a dozen Alhambra 
church and community groups to sign up scores of picketers. On Mondays, members 
of St. Thomas More Catholic Church took the shift. Tuesdays it was Atherton 
Baptist Homes, and Wednesdays it was the Knights of Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
"I lived my life on the picket line," Messina said. The campaign took its toll, 
nearly breaking up her marriage, she said. Her husband, Michael, who had helped 
to schedule the picketing shifts, said the campaign got boring. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Matter of Principle 
</P>
<P>
"It took a lot of time, and it seemed nothing was happening," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Barbara Messina never considered giving up the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I'm just a stubborn Italian," she said. "It just became a matter of 
principle with me." Even after an anonymous sender mailed her a tarantula as a 
warning to quit, she held her ground. 
</P>
<P>
As a council member, Messina has a reputation for being outspoken and 
accessible to people. Critics, however, say she can be obstinate and emotional 
in her decision-making. But all agree that she is hard to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
Messina sits on a council that includes two attorneys, an accountant and a 
health administrator. She is outspoken and persistent -- some would call her 
stubborn. She is credited with doing her homework before meetings but often 
consults her husband, a former mayor and councilman whom she succeeded in 
office, for advice. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all the council people in Alhambra, Barbara Messina is the most loyal to 
the people of Alhambra," said Ralph Gilliam, a former Planning Commission 
member who is a regular at council meetings. "She speaks out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vocal at Meetings 
</P>
<P>
Herman Schwab, a 42-year Alhambra resident, agrees. In 1986, when Schwab and 
his neighbors on Violeta Drive were fighting a proposed theater complex near 
their homes, Barbara Messina met with the residents and spoke up for them at 
council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Messina met with and agreed to help Ramona Avenue residents 
opposed to a controversial 78-foot sign. Resident Clifford Chen said that 
Councilman Michael Blanco, who also opposed the sign, "let his vote speak for 
itself," while Messina "talked to us." The city obtained an injunction to halt 
the sign's construction. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to put myself in the other person's position," she said. "I'm a bleeding 
heart, as they like to put it. It's true." 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam said that after being called for the least little thing, Messina "will 
call City Hall and make things happen." As a result, Messina receives 20 or so 
calls a week from residents, and she follows up on all of them, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stubborn Under Stress 
</P>
<P>
Messina admitted to being stubborn when she is under stress, but added, "If you 
show me I'm wrong, I'm flexible." 
</P>
<P>
For example, she said, she had originally opposed installation of a dance floor 
at a proposed restaurant downtown, but after learning that there would not be 
nightly dancing there, she voted to approve it. 
</P>
<P>
When Messina first took office, her relations with other council members were 
"a little strained," she said, because they probably believed accounts of her 
stubbornness circulated by her opponents. But tension eased after council 
members attended a retreat and "put their cards on the table," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Messina's colleagues on the council said she is hard-working but can be 
hardheaded. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy working with Mrs. Messina," Boyd Condie said. "I think she feels 
fervently about things." 
</P>
<P>
Blanco, who backed one of Messina's opponents during her 1986 bid for office, 
said: "It's easier to work with Michael (Messina) than it's been working with 
Barbara." He said he felt Michael Messina was better at understanding city 
issues. But Councilman Talmage Burke said Barbara Messina is good at talking 
with residents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Heart of Gold 
</P>
<P>
"If she has all the facts and listens to all the discussions, she comes to a 
reasonable conclusion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Parker Williams, a former council member who at times had clashed with Messina 
over redevelopment and other issues, said: "She's got a heart of gold, but she 
doesn't understand things." 
</P>
<P>
"I can say the same thing about him," she responded. She said Williams thinks 
she doesn't understand the economic consequences of city policies. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand," she said. "I just don't agree with him." She said she tends to 
side with the underdog, mainly residents and small business owners. 
</P>
<P>
Messina acknowledged that 20 years ago she was thin-skinned, but said she feels 
that now she has learned to take criticism in stride. What made the difference 
was the 1973 death of her daughter Kathleen, 10, from a brain tumor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Close to Her Daughters 
</P>
<P>
"Life is too short," Messina said. "I don't harbor any hard feelings for 
anybody that's done anything to me. I just don't think it's worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Now her biggest problem is learning how to say no so that she doesn't stretch 
herself too thin, she said. 
</P>
<P>
She is close to her daughters, two of whom are married -- but "no grandchildren 
yet," she said. Teresa Messina Juarez, 27, and Maryann Messina-Doerning, 25, 
are both teachers in Alhambra. Kristen, 18, is a cheerleader at Alhambra High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
"We really grew up with a sense of civic responsibility early on," said Juarez, 
who is a library board member. Daughter Maryann helps manage the family 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Messina knows that the restaurant's location on Main Street may raise a 
conflict-of-interest issue if future city projects are proposed nearby, but she 
said she has informed the city attorney that she will disqualify herself from 
voting based on his advice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hates to Cook 
</P>
<P>
Messina admittedly hates to cook but agreed to help run the restaurant as a 
family investment. She works there four or more hours a day and whips up a 
10-gallon batch of spaghetti sauce and meatballs every Monday. 
</P>
<P>
One recent weekday, Messina, dressed in a tailored gray skirt, white blouse, 
and black pumps because she had just come from a city-related meeting, stood 
behind the restaurant stove and served up a heaping portion of the spaghetti 
lunch special. The mild sauce, made from her grandmother's recipe, is jazzed up 
with sweet bits of fresh garlic, which she loves. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a better spaghetti sauce," said Steve Francis, a 19-year-old who 
started working at the restaurant before the Messinas bought it in February. He 
also credits the councilwoman for getting him back on the job, which he had 
quit after an argument with Michael Messina. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my fault," Francis said. "She helped me own up to it." Michael Messina, 
who said his wife is much better than he is at dealing with people, now mainly 
concentrates on the business side of the restaurant while she supervises the 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Messina shuttles to her appointments in a new Cadillac sporting 
personalized plates that say "HOT ITLN," for Hot Italian. "It caused such a 
stir," she said, wincing in disbelief. The plate elicited uninvited comments 
from truck drivers and raised eyebrows from neighbors, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Come a Long Way 
</P>
<P>
Politically, she has come a long way since 1969, when she headed a citizens 
group to defeat proposals for a new courthouse and library that would have 
raised taxes for homeowners such as the Messinas, who had just bought a house. 
</P>
<P>
Picketing the bookstore further piqued her interest in politics by introducing 
her to Sacramento legislators she described as "so liberal." But she did not 
run for the council until 1986, when she won a close race to fill a seat 
previously held by her husband. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, after then-Mayor Mike Rubino left office after a conviction for 
accepting a bribe, Messina's husband urged her to run, but she demurred, saying 
she didn't feel she was qualified. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I did have the housewife syndrome at the time," she said. She said she 
no longer suffers from that but acknowledges that she frequently consults her 
husband on city policy. 
</P>
<P>
"I respect him, and I respect his opinion," Messina said. She said her husband, 
who owns Messina Development Co. in Alhambra, is an expert on development 
issues and also the person she most admires. He said his company does not take 
on projects in Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proud of Park 
</P>
<P>
Asked to name the accomplishment she is most proud of, the councilwoman names 
the renovation of Almansor Park, a project completed when her husband was on 
the council and she was his field representative. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Blanco said that Messina's penchant for consulting her husband has 
made it more difficult for the council to reach decisions on various projects. 
</P>
<P>
"At times she sounds like what he says is what she's going to do," Blanco said. 
"But he's not there (at council meetings) to discuss things." He said that as a 
result, progress on the city's redevelopment projects has slowed. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Messina said he advises his wife, but they do not always agree and she 
often turns out to be right. "We each have certain talents and skills," he 
said. "We feed off each other." 
</P>
<P>
He dismisses as "typical political talk' accusations that although his wife is 
on the council, he is running the show. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Team Approach 
</P>
<P>
He said he is quieter than his gregarious wife. When he was a councilman, he 
said, the talk was that "he may be running, but it's her that's running 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
The Messinas' team approach did get them into trouble in 1985. Then Councilman 
Michael Messina, saying his job was requiring him to travel more, offered to 
resign -- but only if the council named his wife to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
Critics accused Messina of trying to broker the selection of his successor, and 
the council rejected the conditional resignation on a 2-2 vote. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just taken the wrong way by people," Barbara Messina said of the 
resignation offer. "I just didn't feel it was out of line." 
</P>
<P>
For some politicians, such as former Monterey Park Councilman Matthew G. 
Martinez, who went on to be a state assemblyman and now U.S. congressman, a 
City Council seat has turned out to be a steppingstone to higher office. 
</P>
<P>
Messina plans to run for reelection next year but insists she has no ambition 
beyond City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard enough trying to deal with four other people, much less an Assembly 
position," she said.

IRWINDALE: A CITY SPLIT BY DISSENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
IRWINDALE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nobody said it would be easy. But the latest rash of squabbles and setbacks 
related to this city's quest to lure the football Raiders away from Los Angeles 
has city officials laboring to get back on track. 
</P>
<P>
Despite brave assertions that a deal to build a football stadium is "very much 
alive," city officials acknowledge that Irwindale is in disarray. Most of the 
blame is being placed on recent troubles with fired consultant Fred Lyte. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had disagreements among our City Council and community over the years," 
said Mayor Patricio Miranda, in a written statement last week, "but I've never 
seen our community divided like it is now by an outsider and his followers." 
</P>
<P>
Lyte, who lives in San Marino, blames Miranda for "destroying much of the good 
work of the past 12 years." Along with City Manager Charles Martin and recently 
rehired consultant Xavier Hermosillo, Lyte was one of the three principals who 
negotiated the initial agreement with the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the following developments have shaken the equilibrium of a 
city that has seen its share of rancorous political feuds: 
</P>
<P>
A group of residents has initiated a recall campaign against Miranda and City 
Councilman Salvador Hernandez, charging them with bringing "chaos" to the 
city's redevelopment program and jeopardizing the stadium deal. 
</P>
<P>
Miranda and Hernandez have issued statements charging Lyte with orchestrating 
the recall campaign and creating problems for the city in the midst of 
sensitive negotiations for a football stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Angry memos from opposing sides have charged that a college and trade school 
scholarship fund for deserving Irwindale youngsters, established with a portion 
of Lyte's fees for bringing new businesses to the city, is either being 
mismanaged or "held hostage" by Lyte. 
</P>
<P>
The city has been forced to abandon its preferred site for a football stadium, 
in a gravel pit north of the 210 Freeway, switching to another gravel pit west 
of the 605 Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Though city officials have promised an update on stadium negotiations at this 
week's council meeting, a memo from R. Zaiden Corrado, a special counsel to the 
city, indicates that Irwindale may be coming up short in financing for the 
deal. Charging that Lyte had failed to produce a promised $35 million from 
"major companies in the area," Corrado said, "we're now short that $35 million 
in trying to finalize the deal with the Raiders." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Negotiations 'Moving Along' 
</P>
<P>
But City Manager Martin insisted last week that negotiations are "moving 
along." 
</P>
<P>
He said that the city had switched sites "with the permission of (Raiders 
General Manager) Al Davis" and that the city had initiated "some very rapid 
studies" on the new site. 
</P>
<P>
The old site was jeopardized by the city's inability to gain control of a 
would-be stadium parking lot on land now controlled by the county and the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers. "After a year of trying to convince the corps and the 
county, we're finding we're not getting the cooperation we need," said Martin. 
"So we're switching." 
</P>
<P>
But most of the anger last week seemed directed at the management of the 
$300,000 scholarship fund, which has provided as much as $10,000 a year for 
Irwindale youngsters to attend such places as UC Berkeley Law School, Harvard 
and a golf pro school. 
</P>
<P>
One of the diverse perquisites available to the 1,000 or so residents of 
Irwindale -- whose aggressive Redevelopment Agency has filled city coffers and 
provided its citizens with optical expenses, home improvement grants and free 
senior citizen breakfasts -- the Irwindale Scholarship Fund has been doling out 
about $40,000 a year in the past eight years. 
</P>
<P>
But now, city officials charge, scholarships are being "held hostage" by Lyte, 
who was fired last December. Lyte was a major player in the city's 12-year 
transformation from the "gravel capital of Southern California" to a prosperous 
center of commerce and industry. 
</P>
<P>
The scholarship foundation was established in 1978, as part of Lyte's contract 
with the city. Before the City Council dismissed him, Lyte had earned about $6 
million in commissions for bringing new businesses to the city. He agreed to 
put 10% of that into the scholarship fund. 
</P>
<P>
Lyte said that he had chipped in about $80,000 a year in additional funds -- 
"to build up the capital." 
</P>
<P>
Lyte is using the scholarship fund as a tool to get the city to drop its 
$2-million lawsuit against him, charged Corrado, whose law offices are in 
Fullerton. Lyte's wife Margie, the scholarship fund's treasurer, has refused to 
allow any money to be disbursed to recent applicants, Corrado said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are at least seven kids who need the money and they need it now," said 
Corrado. "Based on Mr. Lyte's most recent correspondence, those applications 
are being denied." 
</P>
<P>
In its lawsuit, the city has charged Lyte with conflict of interest, claiming 
that he had violated a provision in his contract forbidding him from 
recommending to the city projects in which he had a financial interest. The 
City Council has withheld more than $1 million in fees still owed to Lyte. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Scholarship Fund 
</P>
<P>
Corrado proposed last week that the city establish a new scholarship fund, 
using $15,000 in city funds for immediate scholarship awards, while the fate of 
the current foundation is being determined. 
</P>
<P>
Lyte, who donated most of the foundation's funds, said last week that he and 
his wife were simply trying to preserve the foundation's principal for future 
generations of applicants. 
</P>
<P>
"All I'm saying is, let's make sure we have the money to spend before we spend 
it," said Lyte, denying that he was trying to "blackmail the children of 
Irwindale." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Philosophical Difference 
</P>
<P>
Martin acknowledged that there was a philosophical difference between Lyte and 
the City Council. "Fred feels that no capital should be spent, only interest," 
said the man who serves as city manager and city attorney. "The city feels that 
funds should be expended on the basis of need and demand." 
</P>
<P>
City officials have also charged Lyte with orchestrating the recall campaign 
against Miranda and Hernandez. "A disgruntled former consultant and his 
followers are creating problems in our city at a time when we need to focus our 
energies on the Raider deal," said Hernandez, in a written statement in 
response to the petitions. Neither Miranda nor Hernandez responded to telephone 
calls from The Times last week. 
</P>
<P>
The recall campaign was initiated last month by Irwindale resident Brenda 
Marin, whose petitions charged Miranda with using his office for personal gain 
and Hernandez with "blindly" supporting the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Reached at her home, Marin refused to comment. "I don't give interviews to 
anyone but the Tribune," she said, referring to the San Gabriel Valley Daily 
Tribune. To bring the recall to a vote, Marin and her supporters must garner 
the signatures of 160 of the city's registered 532 voters, said a spokeswoman 
for the city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Hermosillo, a special public relations consultant for the city, said that 
recent correspondence from Lyte showed that the fired consultant "obviously has 
involved himself in this recall." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Open Letters 
</P>
<P>
Hermosillo, who was fired by the city last May, was recently rehired at $100 an 
hour to become part of the city's new negotiating team. 
</P>
<P>
He referred to two open letters to Irwindale residents that Lyte has mailed 
recently at his own expense, both attacking Miranda. In one of the letters, 
distributed in March, Lyte offered to assist any pro-recall voters whose rights 
were interfered with by local authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"I have discussed this recall election with federal authorities," Lyte said in 
the letter. 
</P>
<P>
"He has carried a personal difference of opinion with the mayor to a point 
which extends far beyond anything that's been done in this community before," 
contended Hermosillo. 
</P>
<P>
Lyte denies that he is personally involved in the recall campaign.

WHEN THE CHILD MOLESTER TURNS OUT TO BE A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DOYLE, John Doyle, a newspaper reporter, requested that his real name 
not be used to protect his children's privacy. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DICTIONARY DEFINITIONS sometimes don't suffice. The word molest can mean to 
annoy or harass. But when applied to a sexual attack, it doesn't begin to 
describe the act. 
</P>
<P>
I found out just how inadequate it is because, about a year ago, my children 
were molested. 
</P>
<P>
On those rare occasions when my wife or I discuss it with close friends, the 
word hangs in the air, then draws looks of sorrow and expressions of concern. 
But even if they want to know more, few dare ask for details. The talk soon 
moves to other, more pleasant subjects. That's fine because nothing about 
molestation is easy, least of all talking about it. 
</P>
<P>
Frederick, the 13-year-old who molested my son and daughter, hasn't been in our 
home for more than a year now. But like cockroaches, what he did infests our 
lives to this day. Do anything -- open a book or a container of flour -- and 
the memories slither out. 
</P>
<P>
On Christmas, our daughter stopped emptying her stocking and said, "I bet Santa 
only put coal in Frederick's stocking." The other day, she and my wife were 
baking dinosaur-shaped muffins. If the fearsome allosaurus came to the door, 
she would kick him in the knee and run away, she told her mother. She paused. 
"But Mom, what would I do if (Frederick) came to the door?" 
</P>
<P>
The image I had of molesters was that they were sickos in parks or people in 
bizarre cults who use children for God-knows-what. Frederick didn't fit the 
stereotype. He played Little League baseball, was active in a children's 
theater troupe and had a terrific mother. On three weekends when she had to 
leave town, we helped her out by having Frederick stay with us. 
</P>
<P>
About two months after Frederick's last visit, my son, then 5 and in 
kindergarten, began to describe what the teen-ager had done. He began with the 
most minor violation, awaiting my reaction before relating more. I since have 
learned that this is the classic pattern of behavior children follow when 
broaching the subject of molestation. 
</P>
<P>
"(He) showed me his privates," my son began. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, really," I replied, outwardly calm. I continued to wash the dishes, 
petrified. Thoughts swirled. Frederick was just a kid. We had never left the 
house when he was over. This was nothing more than a game of doctor, I hoped. I 
assured my son that he had done nothing wrong, thanked him for telling me and 
told him he was very brave. Emboldened, he gave us details long into the night. 
</P>
<P>
Little kids look up to big kids. Push them on a swing, and you're a trusted 
friend. Frederick slept in my son's room. While my wife and I were in our room, 
Frederick manipulated my son into thinking that molestation was some sort of 
game. First there was "showing." Then touching, "tasting" and probably sodomy. 
There were at least three, and as many as five, opportunities. Remember, 
Frederick told my son each time, don't tell anyone. 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I hoped that Frederick had not done the same things to our 
daughter, then 2. We were wrong. Like our son, she started by giving us the 
least offensive information, then studied our faces. She saw pain. It's common 
for very young victims to feel torn at this point. They want and need to tell, 
but they don't want to hurt their parents. My daughter's solution was to send 
up a different kind of trial balloon. Since the truth made us so sad, she gave 
us metaphors. "Frederick tore up all my stuffed animals," she said. 
</P>
<P>
It was her way of telling us that something bad had happened. But we didn't 
understand her code. The statements relieved us, so her use of fantasy was 
reinforced. For the next six months, she talked about Frederick incessantly. 
There was always an element of fact, but she obscured it with enough fiction so 
that we didn't get that look of hurt on our faces. 
</P>
<P>
It took a therapist experienced in these matters to shake our denial. When our 
daughter said something like "Frederick broke all my toys," we learned to ask 
calmly, "Was there anything else?" 
</P>
<P>
Now we know that she was raped, sodomized and forced to perform oral sex in 
such fear that she didn't once cry out. Don't tell, he warned. 
</P>
<P>
The only solace we could take was that our children trusted us enough to break 
their vows of silence. At last, we began to understand why our outgoing 
children had become sullen, why our son drew disturbing pictures of himself 
caught in traps, why our daughter would not sleep in her room. We could start 
dealing with it. 
</P>
<P>
For six months now, our kids have spent Tuesday afternoons with a therapist. In 
the sessions, my son doesn't talk much about Frederick. But the therapist said 
he's angry and feels guilty. He thinks he should have protected his little 
sister and shouldn't have let it happen to himself. He's mad at us, too, 
because he doesn't understand why we let it happen. He said he has told only 
his very best friend. "But," he added in a voice that sounded years beyond 6, 
"he didn't really understand what molest is." 
</P>
<P>
Neither did I. In my house of memories, there is no Frederick, no nightmares 
that go on night after night for months, no therapy sessions. I have written 
newspaper stories about disasters and personal tragedy. I have had deaths in my 
family. But I have never felt more pain than when my 3-year-old daughter says 
to me, as she often does, "Do you want to know what (Frederick) did?" I gently 
tell her that I know; then I hold her. 
</P>
<P>
I now know that we could have done more to prevent it. We were exceedingly 
careful about choosing nursery schools, and we rehearsed instructions about 
strangers. But we never thought to warn the kids about friends. It never 
occurred to us that our children would be at risk in our own home, with my wife 
and I present. 
</P>
<P>
We still tell them that most people are good. But I am far less trusting. When 
our friends come over, I find myself wondering whether they're molesters. We 
make a point of getting to know the parents of our kids' playmates, and when 
those children come over, we make sure the bedroom doors remain open. 
</P>
<P>
After our son started to tell us about Frederick, we called his mother and gave 
her a chance to confront him, on the chance that he had an innocent 
explanation. He didn't. Because she was a friend, we waited a few days before 
calling the police. Frederick was arrested. He pleaded guilty to the sex 
offense and was sentenced to probation. Months later, when we learned what he 
had done to our daughter, detectives rearrested him. After denying all along 
that he had molested my daughter, he finally confessed. The judge was less 
understanding the second time around and sentenced him to two weeks in juvenile 
hall. Frederick must see a probation officer weekly, perform community service 
and go to therapy. Our kids greeted the sentence with glee. 
</P>
<P>
In my view, the judge issued a firm sentence. But because Frederick is a 
juvenile, everything about the case is confidential. (Frederick isn't his real 
name.) Unlike adult sex offenders, he is not required to register with the 
police. And when he turns 18, he can request that his record be sealed. 
</P>
<P>
Whether he will molest again is anyone's guess. In his favor, his mother takes 
his problem very seriously. At his sentencing, she and I spoke for 45 minutes. 
Both of us were in tears. She is deeply sorry. But he's his own man now. Like a 
recovering alcoholic, perhaps he can control his behavior; but he must realize 
he has a problem. I don't know that he does. 
</P>
<P>
Much is unknown about molestation, including how often it occurs or how often 
juveniles molest. Victims may not talk about it until years afterward, if at 
all. But as with other sex crimes, society is learning more. Experts say that 
most molesters were victims themselves. Authorities say there are more reports 
of women and teen-age girls molesting. Both findings apply in Frederick's case. 
As a child, he was molested by a teen-age girl, something that emerged only 
during his therapy after his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
To someone who doesn't know them as we do, our children would seem fine. Our 
son is obsessed with Little League. He hasn't drawn a picture of himself 
ensnared in a trap for some time now, although he still sleeps with his light 
on. Our daughter happily will demonstrate the latest steps she's learned in 
ballet for anyone who asks. But while scribbling at the kitchen table awhile 
back, she drew what she called a picture of herself. As we sometimes do, we 
asked her to tell us about it. "I'm sad," she said. Why? "Because someone hurt 
me," she answered. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, my wife and I are closer now. Problems common to any family seem 
small. Things such as job advancement are less important than stability at home 
and being there for our kids. The shock I felt at first is gone. But a feeling 
of loss remains. Because of what happened to my children, we all have been 
robbed of something very precious. They've lost some of their innocence. 
They've lost the sense that they are safe in their own home and that their 
parents always can protect them. They've lost the comforting childhood belief 
that bad guys are easy to spot, that villains don't look like witches or 
wolves. Sometimes they look like the kid next door.

OUTTAKES: CASHING IN ON JACKIE 
</P>

<TEXT>

Producer Lester Persky tells us he has interest from all three networks for the 
six-to-eight-hour miniseries of the Jacqueline Kennedy-Onassis story that he'd 
like to have ready for next season. He completed his rights deal for C. David 
Hayman's unauthorized 728-page "A Woman Named Jackie" -- due out May 3 from 
Lyle Stuart, Inc. -- just last week for "substantial six figures," Persky said. 
</P>
<P>
Already the object of intense media heat, "A Woman Named Jackie" reportedly 
includes information drawn from some 800 interviews, as well as previously 
unreleased letters, White House records and FBI files -- plus a word-for-word 
reproduction of the prenuptial agreement she signed before marrying Aristotle 
Onassis. 
</P>
<P>
Persky, who produced NBC's miniseries version of Hayman's "Poor Little Rich 
Girl," said his new project will cover "Mrs. Onassis' entire life, from even 
before she was born." He added, "We will try to do it in a quality way, with 
tact." 
</P>
<P>
Onassis' spokeswoman told us that Jackie has no plans to respond either to 
Hayman's book or Persky's miniseries treatment of it: "We never respond . . . 
we don't encourage them, obviously." Stacy Jenel Smith

Improv owner Budd Friedman and his partner, Mark Lonow, are about to bring 
stand-up comedy right into your home -- and you'll be the comic. Look for "The 
Improv Comedy Game" ($18.95) this summer, in which players "start out as an 
amateur," Friedman told us, with the object "to become a star." 
</P>
<P>
A toss of the dice will determine where a player lands on the board: On a 
square that accelerates one's stand-up career (example: "You 'kill' at Improv. 
Budd and Mark make you a 'regular.' Score three points."); sets the player back 
("Heckler is funnier than you. He gets TV series. Lose two points."); or 
requires the player to perform material from one of four categories -- Cracks, 
Gags, Improvs, Groaners. Generating laughs earns additional points, pushing 
them up the ladder of success. 
</P>
<P>
Players can try their own jokes or choose among the hundreds provided (and 
still being written). Professional comedians who have worked at the Improv are 
contributing jokes, such as: 
</P>
<P>
From Steve Mittleman -- "I have a really weak chin. It takes me three or four 
hours to change a pillowcase." 
</P>
<P>
And from Carrie Snow -- "I'm reaching my sexual peak, and it's lonely at the 
top!" Todd David Schwartz

WINE: DELICIOSA; 
</P>
<P>
AN IDEAL CLIMATE AND A MASTER HAND CONTRIBUTE TO A MOST UNUSUAL WINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LAWRENCE BALZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WHEN EXPLORER Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo sailed by the Santa Barbara Channel 
Islands in 1542, he found a region of enchanting beauty. In his journals, he 
noted that the surrounding climate was deliciosa. 
</P>
<P>
That distinctive climate has appealed not only to explorers and settlers but 
also to wine makers. The Santa Ynez Valley climat -- a Burgundian wine term 
that encompasses a vine-growing district's endowments, including the weather, 
the soil and how the land is exposed to the wind, rain and sun -- is ideal. The 
coastal mountains northwest of the city run not on a north-south axis, but from 
east to west, and the Pacific Ocean's cooling breezes flow along them. 
</P>
<P>
Wine has been made for sacramental and social purposes in Santa Barbara since 
the 1800s, but commercial wine making did not begin until 1962. That was when 
Pierre Lafond, who heads several diverse operations in Santa Barbara, from 
delicatessens to fashion, founded the Santa Barbara Winery. 
</P>
<P>
Lafond calls himself an "accidental wine maker" because he is an architect "by 
training and choice." But he was inspired to take on a struggling wine shop, 
buy grapes and make various fruit wines. He eventually converted the business 
into a successful winery. And he no longer needs to buy his grapes because, in 
1972, he planted the Lafond Vineyards along the banks of the lower Santa Ynez 
River. 
</P>
<P>
And in 1981, another inspiration struck Lafond when he hired Bruce McGuire as 
wine maker. Since then, the winery has achieved gold-medal distinction. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent tasting with McGuire, I found the 1987 Santa Ynez Valley Sauvignon 
Blanc ($8) sensational -- but not because of the 10% Semillon, a taming factor, 
in the blending. 
</P>
<P>
The secret is in a growing process called leaf stripping: Parts of the vines 
are stripped of leaves, and the sun-tanned clusters of grapes produce a 
Sauvignon Blanc with almost spicy, fresh-lime suggestions in the taste. To add 
a buttery richness, McGuire puts half of the wine through malolactic 
fermentation and seven months on the yeast lees. The Sauvignon Blanc is not to 
be missed. An even richer edition, a Reserve ($11), will be available May 1. 
</P>
<P>
For a most unusual wine, the 1987 Santa Ynez Valley Dry Chenin Blanc ($7) is 
one to try. It is rich and has a toastiness from being on the yeast lees. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire, 33, was one of the first wine makers in the state to employ the 
technique of leaf pulling. "This improves color," he says, "reduces the malic 
acid and produces riper fruit flavors." 
</P>
<P>
The wine is 100% barrel-fermented to dryness in French oak puncheons and is 
aged on the yeast lees for six months. Thirty percent of it undergoes 
malolactic fermentation, which gives the wine a rich middle-palate sensation 
where the taste buds would ordinarily identify sweetness. Try this wine on your 
Chardonnay-loving friends. 
</P>
<P>
Another wine we tasted was the 1987 Santa Ynez Valley Chardonnay ($10). Its 
bouquet is reticent, but the fruit intensity comes through like a star emerging 
through velour drapes. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 Late Harvest Santa Ynez Valley Zinfandel Essence (tenths, $15) is 
worth a journey to the winery. The wine is made from foot-stomped, botrytised 
berries, and it's a honey-sweet liquid bronze nectar. Deliciosa.

STAGE WEEK: RADIO'S JOE FRANK VENTURES ONTO STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you liked Joe Frank on the radio, get ready for Joe Frank -- on stage. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, KCRW's popular storyteller ("Work in Progress") opens at the 
Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) in the solo piece "Joe Frank: In 
Performance," written by Frank and directed by film producer Paula Mazur. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to appear live on stage with props, music, music on tape, and voices 
that'll come out of speakers -- with whom I'll engage in dialogue," said Frank. 
"There are three basic subjects: sex, power and spirituality . . . or love, 
work and the need for some kind of meaning. There will be wild moments, 
thoughtful, frenetic, reflective and quiet moments. I hope it'll amuse people 
-- and move them." 
</P>
<P>
His incognito radio work, Frank noted, has had its own advantages. 
</P>
<P>
"You get to develop a kind of intimacy that you can't with any other medium," 
he explained. "It's a very direct kind of relationship -- although, of course, 
it's sort of one-way. But I do imagine myself talking to somebody, some generic 
listener: Joe Listener," Frank said. "But (his identity) varies. I get letters 
from old people, people in high school, prisons. I don't have any particular 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
The idea to physically place himself in front of an audience began last year 
when the writer/performer was invited to discuss his work at 72 Market Street's 
Saturday afternoon lecture series. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided I didn't want to talk about my radio show," he said. "I didn't want 
to demystify it, explain what I do. I also didn't want to talk about why I do 
it, because whenever I see artists talking about themselves and their work, it 
always seems to trivialize it. So instead of doing a lecture, I decided to do a 
performance. I'd always wanted to do it and thought it might be fun. I ended up 
(using) what I felt were some of the strongest monologues, and those with a 
comic bent." 
</P>
<P>
A few days before the show, pre-performance jitters struck. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was going to be a disaster," he admitted. "But when I got up in 
front of the audience, I had an amazing experience. It was extraordinarily 
uplifting and exhilarating. They loved the show; they were rolling in the 
aisles. And for the first time, I could hear it. I experienced the response. In 
radio, you're in a vacuum. So doing it in front of a live audience, I really 
had a relationship with people -- and it affected the way I performed." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the medium (a theatrical adaptation of his "Rent a Family, Part 
One" is ongoing at Stages), Frank's own persona is unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same sensibility," he stressed, "the same aesthetic. The only thing 
is: On radio, you can tell a one-hour story about some event in your life. I 
don't think you can do that on stage. There's also considerably more of a comic 
slant to this material; the stories are shorter. It isn't as if I, Joe Frank, 
am going to get on stage and tell a bunch of unrelated stories. It's about one 
character, (told) from the point of view of this Joe Frank-ish guy." 
</P>
<P>
High as he is on this new detour, the writer/performer is burning no bridges 
when it comes to radio. 
</P>
<P>
"Radio is what I know," he said, "it's brought me wherever I am. Now, it may be 
that radio is really the medium I should be in -- that this adventure is really 
(just) an adventure. Then I'll go back and do radio. I don't know how this is 
going to evolve. I've been on radio for 10 years, so it's exciting to try 
something new. But I just received a major CPB (Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting) grant, so unless I want to give the money back, I'll probably be 
back." 
</P>
<P>
CRITICAL CROSSFIRE: John Olive's "The Voice of the Prairie," a gentle drama of 
radio storytelling in an earlier era, is playing at the Back Alley Theatre in 
Van Nuys. Bob Clark directs Rachel Babcock, Gretchen Corbett, Ronny Cox, Barry 
Gordon, John M. Johnson, Dick O'Neill and Bobby Zameroski. 
</P>
<P>
The Times' Sylvie Drake found "a Frank Capra play -- in tone, not derivation. 
Olive owns it exclusively. It may not be much more than a deft and witty 
valentine to a pioneer spirit and to the value of words, but that suffices. 
It's fun, it has a knowing heart and a voice to delight all within earshot." 
</P>
<P>
Said the L.A. Reader's Susan Armine: "Olive's expertly crafted story of a 
sweet-but-slippery entrepreneur and the shy tale spinner whom he makes a star 
is humorous, nostalgic, educational, deeply moving. Clark's brisk direction and 
a first-rate cast show how imagination and reality can become inseparable over 
the airwaves and in our lives." 
</P>
<P>
From Kathleen O'Steen in Daily Variety: "Clark has carefully crafted a 
production that adheres to the spirit (of radio's early days), reaching out to 
its audiences through sterling character portrayals and moments of sentiment 
that never stray beyond endurable bounds. The unaffected manner in which the 
stories are told and overlap is to this show's credit." 
</P>
<P>
The Daily News' Tom Jacobs disagreed. "Olive delights us on occasion with some 
nice, poetic dialogue. But telling two equally balanced stories presents some 
problems he has not solved . . . In the hands of Clark, it comes across as an 
occasionally inspired, often banal play that is in need of some editing and 
reshaping." 
</P>
<P>
Noted Drama-Logue's Richard Scaffidi: " 'Voice' seems at first to be merely a 
pleasant little play, but gradually one becomes aware that a deeper chord is 
being touched. There is a metamorphosis from quaintness and cornfield humor 
into stirring folklore. It's the difference between hayseed caricatures and 
heartland characters, between a plot and a tale." 
</P>
<P>
And from Ed Kaufman in the Hollywood Reporter: " 'Voice of the Prairie' is a 
rare gem of a show, one that is touching and tender. It's also full of the awe 
and mystery of an early America that still had a sense of innocence and wonder 
about things . . . The entire cast is absolutely wonderful."

MAHLER: Symphony No. 5. Vienna Philharmonic, Lorin Maazel, conductor. CBS 
compact disc, MDK 44782. With the plethora of fine Mahler performances of the 
last 20 years, it is understandable that some have been overlooked. This should 
not be one of them. On this fully digital 1983 release, now on CBS' budget 
"Digital Masters" series, Maazel adopts deliberate tempos in the second and 
third movements, after a true funebre opening. There is no sense of bogging 
down, however; greater instrumental detail and structural insights are the 
listener's rewards. The Vienna Philharmonic is at its best, the engineering 
spacious and intimate, as appropriate. With 15 tracks indexed and the bargain 
price, this is highly recommended. GREG HETTMANSBERGER

RECORD RACK: THE JUDDS "RIVER OF TIME." RCA ** 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINE McKENNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Song selection is crucial for vocal stylists, and the Judds should have done a 
bit more shopping before making this album. The mother-daughter team scored one 
hit after another with their last LP, "Heartland," but "River of Time" might 
break that winning streak; that the record has problems can be seen in the fact 
that the most satisfying cut is a version of a chestnut by the Everly Brothers, 
"Sleepless Nights" (a fitting homage, because the Judds' vocal style is a dead 
ringer for the classic country-pop technique perfected by Don and Phil). The 
other standout cut is Dire Straits' "Water of Love," a haunting ballad stamped 
with Mark Knopfler's languid and lovely touch, while Naomi (the elder) Judd, 
who co-wrote three of the tunes, contributes an engaging barn burner titled 
"Cadillac Red." The album is fleshed out with four merely adequate numbers and 
two sugary tunes, "Young Love," and "Guardian Angel." "River of Time" isn't bad 
enough to make longtime Judds fans quit the fan club, but if you're not 
familiar with Naomi and Wynonna, any of their other LPs will serve as a better 
introduction. KRISTINE McKENNA

Here it is, folks: "The Traveling Wilburys, Volume Two." (a.k.a. Tom Petty's 
first so-called solo album, sans the full-time support of his Heartbreakers.) 
It's not so much the cast -- though Jeff Lynne carries a quite audible presence 
as co-producer, and both George Harrison and the late Roy Orbison show up among 
the support crew -- as the attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Petty contributed the jokiest material to the Wilburys' already wit-riddled 
platter, and "Full Moon Fever" is similarly, subtly light of lyric. Not to 
imply that Petty has turned class clown on us; only to reinforce that here he 
carries on the Travelers' trenchant penchant for telling a sad story with 
ridiculously trivial bits of detail. 
</P>
<P>
The ironic, bittersweet opening track, "Free Fallin'," is a most telling tale 
as Petty doth protest too much about how he doesn't miss the sweet young thing 
he deserted back in Reseda. "All the vampires walkin' through the Valley / Move 
west down Ventura Boulevard," he sings, and as he gets to that last phrase, a 
lush Lynne chorale of voices comes in to intone the name of that street of 
dreams, as if reinforcing an essential detail in a mythic country-Western song. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of this free-form collection is nearly as nifty, from the first 
single, "I Won't Back Down" (similar to the Heartbreakers' halting, synth-heavy 
"You Got Lucky"), to the knock-off version of the Byrds' "I'll Feel a Whole Lot 
Better," to the closing "Zombie Zoo" (a tribute to pale-faced trendiness). 
You'll find far less experimentation here than on, say, "Southern Accents," but 
Petty didn't make this album to break ground. He just wants to kick up a little 
dirt. CHRIS WILLMAN

RECORD RACK: W.A.S.P. "THE HEADLESS CHILDREN." CAPITOL ** 1/2

Singer Blackie Lawless and gang have ditched their lurid sex-and-violence motif 
and entered the world of social consciousness with no loss of power. In fact, 
without the crutch of its sensationalist trappings, W.A.S.P. has created its 
gutsiest record to date. Guest drummer Frankie Banali of Quiet Riot shines on 
this album's heavy territory and Uriah Heep's Ken Hensley adds '70s-style 
keyboards on several tracks. After being on the fringes of the metal scene for 
the better part of the '80s, W.A.S.P. is ready to be taken seriously. JANISS

INTRODUCING: STUFF FROM THE MIDLANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Band: The Wonder Stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Personnel: Martin Gilks, drums; Miles Hunt, vocals, guitar; Malcolm Treece, 
guitar, vocals; Rob Jones, bass. 
</P>
<P>
History: The Wonder Stuff hails from England's Midlands and never would have 
come into being if there had been "10 or 15 bands around that I felt I could be 
a fan of," according to Hunt. But there weren't -- at least not in April, 1986, 
when Hunt began writing songs with Treece, who brought along his friend Gilks. 
Soon Jones, an old pal of Hunt's, joined to fill out the quartet and the band 
was asked to play at a club in the West Midlands. That led to more club 
engagements, and in 1987 the group issued two singles, "Wonderful Day" and 
"Unbearable," on its own Far Out label. The latter was successful on England's 
independent charts and the band -- which had never sent out any tapes to record 
companies -- found itself being pursued by several major labels. Ultimately it 
signed with Polydor/Polygram, which released the debut album "The Eight-Legged 
Groove Machine" in January. 
</P>
<P>
Sound: The album's title is a fair description, as the Wonder Stuff sounds 
something like Robyn Hitchcock's little brother's garage band might. Never as 
delicate or deep as the Hitch often is, the Stuff's stuff is nonetheless 
tuneful, thoughtful, romping fun -- though occasionally the paeans to trippy 
roots get a little treacly. Topics tend to be a bit gloomy, ranging from greed 
to despair, yet all the while the suitably garagey guitars and Hunt's elastic 
everyman voice keep a sunny feeling. As Hunt said in the band's bio, "If you 
can't sing along with it, it's a load of bollocks."

RAP RETORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Judging from the opinions in many of the April 16 letters on rap, it seems 
there are a lot of people who view mainstream American rock as the only form of 
legitimate music. They declare that rap is simply not music because it does not 
contain any of the characteristics of mainstream rock (or, in the words of one 
reader, "real music"). 
</P>
<P>
There are many forms of music that do not require the use of a Gibson Les Paul 
or Pearl drum kit in order to legitimize themselves (Japan's Gagaku, Africa's 
Nyahbinghi, Java's Gamelan and, yes, America's rap). 
</P>
<P>
I have a hard time understanding why so many people can't accept the fact that 
they share a planet with a diverse range of cultures, some of which are right 
in their own backyards (or at least as nearby as Compton).

BLACKS AND MOVIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was devastating to again read the same old bromides about why black movie 
projects cannot get funding by major studios. 
</P>
<P>
The April 16 story was replete with shopworn excuses, such as the one that 
white audiences will not support pictures without a white leading character. 
</P>
<P>
Such justifications for not producing Afro-American projects is insulting to 
black Americans and all other thoughtful people. The great success of 
television's "Cosby" show would seem sufficient to put an end to that lie. 
</P>
<P>
White people, like any other people, will support any movie or television 
program that has a good story and characters and that is done well and properly 
promoted. (Remember "Roots"?) 
</P>
<P>
The problem lies in the fact that too many decision makers in the industry are 
young, white yuppies whose isolated upbringings in all-white neighborhoods and 
all-white schools and colleges has ill-prepared them for the role they have 
inherited.

Having read the letters by Weisbart and Hillman and coming to the belated

ghetto.

PICTURES AND WORDS, EUROPEAN STYLE

<P>
Re Charles Solomon's "The Comic Book Grows Up," April 16: 
</P>
<P>
Solomon writes that "graphic novels have been popular for decades . . . in 
Europe" (which is true), then adds: "In Paris, the rage for these florid 
fantasies has led book dealers in the swankiest arrondissements . . . to devote 
large sections to them. 
</P>
<P>
This is simply wrong. It evokes the superficial, shallow judgment of the Ugly 
American Abroad ("Look, Hon, they have McDonald's on the Champs-Elysees!") 
</P>
<P>
I am a Frenchman, and I did not grow up in a "swanky" arrondissement but in a 
series of unremarkable provincial towns. Yet I've always seen "graphic novels" 
in all bookstores, college or otherwise. They are not, as Mr. Solomon implies, 
the result of a "rage" limited to rich college kids or yuppies. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the first graphic novels published were the "Tintin" books in the 
1930s, which gained immediate acceptance for the genre. At first, graphic 
novels were considered to be primarily for children, but in the '60s people 
began to realize that adults were reading them too. (Gen. De Gaulle once 
jokingly complained that Tintin was more famous than he!) 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Solomon is also wrong when he describes our graphic novels as "florid 
fantasies." If I were to refer to your own "Peanuts" as a "torrid soap opera" 
or "Calvin &amp; Hobbes" as "thrilling exotic adventure," you'll have an idea 
of how accurate Mr. Solomon's opinion rings to me.

NEWSMAKERS: ON THIS DAY, THEY'D SOONER RUSH OUT FOR SOME LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE JOHNSON -- 30 -- 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 -- At the sound of a Colt pistol, 150 costumed Oklahomans on horseback and in 
wagons let out a yell and, with cowboy hats flying, made a frenzied half-mile 
dash to re-enact the 1889 rush for free land. This time around, there were no 
reports of any "Sooners" sneaking across the starting line before history buff 
Paul Ward, on horseback, started the race to commemorate the land run by more 
than 40,000 settlers. Winners got stakes like those their ancestors may have 
used to stake claims 100 years ago, when President Benjamin Harrison opened the 
2-million-acre Unassigned Lands and began the process that led to the state's 
creation. In other activities marking the April 22 anniversary, Gov. Henry 
Bellmon, also in Western wear, watched a ceremony issuing a commemorative 
postcard on the steps of Carnegie Library in Guthrie, the old territorial 
capital. The town's mayor, James Weems, later started off a parade for a 
cheering crowd of about 50,000. But not everyone was thrilled with the 
ceremonies. Although some Indian groups have participated, others have 
protested. "We're in the ghetto while the people who stole our land are 
enjoying prosperity," said Frances Wise, a member of the Tribal Voices 
coalition. She said that asking Indians to join in the activities is like 
"asking us to dance on the graves of our people." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Twins separated soon after their birth almost 35 years ago shed tears of 
joy when they were reunited at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. Susan 
Muchlenbruch of Northfield, Ill., had spent 10 years looking for the sister she 
never knew, and, with the help of the Salvation Army's missing persons service, 
she finally located Mary Ann McNew in a Seattle suburb. "You don't know how 
happy we are," Muchlenbruch said, crying and hugging her sister. "We're going 
to catch up on all we've lost, all the years we've missed together," said a 
tearful McNew. Debbie Felt of the Salvation Army's missing persons service 
said: "This one was a fluke case. We didn't have any leads except one, and we 
ended up sending just one letter." 
</P>
<P>
 -- A peerlessly puckered piece from the opera "Carmen" and the popular tune 
"The Entertainer" won the grand championship at the National Whistlers 
Convention for Sean Lomak, a Navy sailor stationed at Pearl Harbor. Yugo Conti 
of El Cerrito, Calif., won second place at the contest in Louisburg, N. C., by 
whistling a classical oboe concerto and "Sailing to Spain." Lomak is scheduled 
to appear May 5 on the "Tonight Show," hosted by Johnny Carson. DAVE JOHNSON --

IN THE BEGINNING: BUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By William Schneider, William Schneider is a contributing editor to Opinion. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Bush has been President of the United States for three months and he's 
still "out of the loop." Instead of dominating the national agenda like his 
predecessor, Bush seems to have trouble making the evening news. 
</P>
<P>
On April 30, Bush will complete 100 days in office. It seems appropriate to ask 
the usual questions at the end of the honeymoon. Was it good for us? And was it 
good for him? 
</P>
<P>
The answers are: It was pretty good for us. But it wasn't so good for him. 
</P>
<P>
Politically, Bush seems to have defined himself as a weak, almost passive 
President. The honeymoon is almost over and he hasn't won anything. Bush has 
had only two experiences on his honeymoon -- losing and compromising. He lost 
the big fight over the confirmation of John G. Tower, his first choice for 
secretary of defense. And he compromised at the outset on a whole range of 
issues: the federal budget, U.S. policy in Central America, gun control and the 
minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
In no instance has Bush taken a firm stand, rallied public support and gotten 
what he wants out of Congress. That was Ronald Reagan's style. Bush's style is 
to make a deal. He negotiates quietly, outside the glare of publicity and with 
as little rancor as possible. He then announces a compromise, shifts his 
position to accommodate the outcome and invites the country to applaud the 
spirit of bipartisanship and the new climate of cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
Being seen as a great compromiser tends to diminish a President's stature. He 
may be respected for his achievements but he loses his standing as a popular 
hero who inspires loyalty. It seems unlikely that people will say about Bush 
what one experienced observer said about Reagan. "Ronald Reagan was a 
successful candidate and an effective President above all else because he stood 
for a set of ideas," said this admirer. "He stated them in 1980 -- and it 
turned out that he meant them -- and he wrote most of them not only into public 
law, but into the national consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
That assessment was offered by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) on March 6 at 
Yale University. 
</P>
<P>
A deal-making President also runs the risk of weakening his base. Conservatives 
were delighted last year by Bush's hard-line, take-no-prisoners election 
campaign. The Reaganites concluded, "He's one of us." 
</P>
<P>
Now they're not so sure. He has let them down on "Star Wars," the Contras, the 
Palestine Liberation Organization, gun control and the minimum wage, and 
they're worried about his commitment on taxes and abortion. It cannot be said 
with any certainty that conservatives will be there for Bush when his back is 
to the wall -- as they were for Reagan during the 1982 recession and the 
Iran-Contra scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also risks losing his authority with Congress. The Tower affair proved 
that Congress is not afraid of Bush. They defied him with impunity. The 
President just turned the other cheek and nominated a defense secretary 
Congress had no quarrel with. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Bush has drawn the line on the minimum wage issue. He threatens to 
veto any increase he finds unacceptable. But listen to the way Rep. Austin J. 
Murphy (D-Pa.), chairman of the House labor standards subcommittee, answered 
the President's veto threat. "We will send you this bill," Murphy said last 
week, "and we will send you another bill and we will make you wish you did not 
have the power to veto." No member of Congress ever talked that way to Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
In short, Bush's approach to the presidency is determinedly unheroic, and he is 
paying the price. But it hasn't been so bad for the country. The Administration 
has made considerable progress on issues that seemed hopelessly stalemated 
during the Reagan years -- Contra aid, the savings-and-loan crisis, the Middle 
East and, not least important, the federal budget. Bush's "kinder, gentler" 
approach has paid off in a new spirit of partnership. Issues are being resolved 
and things are getting done without a lot of public fuss and name-calling. 
</P>
<P>
With Bush, we seem to get more policy progress but less presidential authority. 
You could see this in the two most important policy breakthroughs of the Bush 
Administration -- the budget deal and the Contra agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The "honeymoon ceremony" held on April 14 to announce a bipartisan budget 
agreement was a little embarrassing. The agreement was essentially a short-term 
fix. Rep. William H. Gray III (D-Pa.) described it as a "help me make it 
through the night" approach to budgeting. 
</P>
<P>
Congress and the President put together a package that reduces the 1990 deficit 
by $27 billion -- just enough to avoid the automatic cuts mandated by the 
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act. The deal includes a lot of accounting gimmicks, 
one-time-only savings, temporary expedients and optimistic assumptions about 
the economy. The tough choices were simply put off. 
</P>
<P>
The important thing is that the agreement happened at all. "This is a first, 
manageable step," Bush said, "and this budget agreement is the first such 
agreement reached ahead of schedule and not framed in the context of crisis." 
This year's agreement breaks the pattern of budget politics established during 
the Reagan years. That was an annual shoot-out. Reagan would threaten to veto 
taxing and spending bills he didn't like, and Congress would threaten to slash 
his military budget. 
</P>
<P>
Bush never went on TV to rally public support. Instead, he compromised. He gave 
up his campaign pledge to reduce the capital gains tax. He swallowed $10 
billion in defense cuts. And he agreed to $5.3 billion in new tax revenues from 
unspecified changes in the tax law -- but "no new taxes." In other words, the 
President weakened his position in order to avoid the gridlock of past budget 
years. That's not a bad trade-off. 
</P>
<P>
The Contra agreement approved by Congress this month represents a complete 
reversal of Reagan's Central America policy. Bush has abandoned any military 
solution. "We do not claim the right to order the politics of Nicaragua," Bush 
said. According to one conservative critic, what Bush meant was: "We've sold 
out the Contras." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement provides $49.7 million in non-military aid to the Contras until 
next February, when the Sandinista government is scheduled to hold free 
elections. In its most controversial provision, the agreement gives Democratic 
committee chairmen the power to veto any continued aid after November. 
</P>
<P>
The Contra agreement removes a major issue of contention between the President 
and Congress. To many conservatives, however, the agreement represents a 
betrayal of principle. The Bush Administration has repudiated the goal of 
overthrowing the Sandinista regime. Moreover, White House Counsel C. Boyden 
Gray questioned the constitutionality of the deal because it gives Congress 
veto power over the President. 
</P>
<P>
The Contra agreement acknowledges political reality. Neither Congress nor the 
U.S. public supports continued military aid. Five Central American governments 
have signed a peace accord that calls for disbanding the Contras. Reagan never 
accepted those realities, and so his Central American policies were 
self-defeating. On the other hand, Reagan never allowed his foreign-policy 
authority to be so deeply compromised. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is often accused of having no agenda. That is not quite true. Bush's 
agenda, in both domestic and foreign policy, is to de-ideologize U.S. politics. 
He wants to heal the poisonous divisions that have beset America since the 
1960s and return to a politics of compromise and consensus. 
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural address, Bush complained that "a certain divisiveness" has 
emerged in our political life "in which not each other's ideas are challenged 
but each other's motives." Bush traced this divisiveness back to the 1960s: "It 
has been this way since Vietnam. That war cleaves us still." 
</P>
<P>
The costs of that divisiveness were tragically apparent last week. Abbie 
Hoffman, the prototypical '60s radical, committed suicide. And in his summation 
to the jury, the prosecutor at Oliver L. North's trial said, "The tragedy of 
Oliver North is that a man who said he cared so much about freedom and 
democracy in Nicaragua forgot about the demands of freedom and democracy here 
at home." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan was a product of the 1960s. He was elected governor of California in 
1966 because of backlash against the violence in Watts and Berkeley. And when 
it suits him, Bush, too, can run to the right. In his inaugural address, 
however, Bush changed his tune, saying, "I yearn for a greater tolerance, an 
easy-goingness about each other's attitudes and way of life." 
</P>
<P>
So Bush practices a politics of compromise. Compromise is the antithesis of 
ideology. Ideologues like Reagan and North and Hoffman see politics as a 
conflict of values, not a conflict of interests. Interests can be compromised. 
Values cannot. How can you compromise on questions of right and wrong? 
</P>
<P>
Bush sees the President as the great facilitator, not the great communicator. 
His is an unheroic politics in which everything, or almost everything, is 
negotiable. Reagan believed that minimum wage laws are wrong, that Americans 
have an absolute right to bear arms and that the Sandinista government is an 
intolerable threat to U.S. security. Bush has been willing to compromise on all 
these points. 
</P>
<P>
In Bush's case, government by compromise is a necessity. Unlike Franklin D. 
Roosevelt in 1933 or Reagan in 1981, Bush does not assume the presidency at a 
time of crisis. The voters are not demanding bold action. Nor does Bush take 
office with a clear mandate for change. Unlike Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower, 
John F. Kennedy, Richard M. Nixon, Jimmy Carter and Reagan, Bush was elected to 
succeed a President from the same party. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Bush presides over a divided government. Both houses of Congress are 
controlled by the other party. As if to remind the President how vulnerable he 
is, the Democrats have won two House seats in special elections so far this 
year, and they may pick up a third next week in Wyoming. There is no way Bush 
can govern without the cooperation of the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Washington may be worried about a weak and ineffectual President, but the 
public is not. Bush's job approval rating is running more than 60%. 
Unemployment is at its lowest level in 15 years. Inflation seems to be under 
control. There is no foreign-policy crisis, and the only scandal in Washington 
involves the Democratic Speaker of the House. Maybe Bush isn't doing much. But 
the American people aren't demanding he do much. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's unheroic style seems fine -- for right now. But times keep changing. 
Does Bush change? The evidence on this, up until now, is mixed. 
</P>
<P>
During the last year alone, we have seen four different Bushes. During the 
primaries, we had Bush the Wimp. Then he became Bush the Tough Guy in the 
campaign against Michael S. Dukakis. Bush the Pro emerged during the transition 
-- reassuring, self-confident and thoroughly professional. Now we have Bush the 
Fixer, the man who can pull off a deal on the budget, a deal on the Contras, a 
deal on everything. Sort of a Bush for all seasons. Underlying all of those 
seasons, however, is a disturbing passivity. 
</P>
<P>
Bush waits for something to go wrong. Then he makes a deal to fix it. But 
sometimes you have to anticipate problems. And sometimes you have to take 
decisive action without making a deal or building a consensus. 
</P>
<P>
Twice during the honeymoon, the Bush Administration lost the initiative. The 
President refused to assert any compelling public interest in the Eastern 
Airlines strike. Now we are faced with the likely demise of a major air 
carrier. And after the Alaskan oil spill, Bush delayed authorizing federal 
participation in the cleanup. The results were catastrophic. 
</P>
<P>
The President would do well to heed the message of the oil spill: If you don't 
know where you're going, things can get sticky.

Nearly 150 years after Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels published "The Communist 
Manifesto," only 20 years after students preached revolution in the streets of 
America and Europe, the failure of Marxism-Leninism in the Soviet Union appears 
to have driven the final nails into the coffin of "the left." Glasnost and 
perestroika promise renewal for the Soviet Union but mark the end of the 
revolutionary socialist movement that threatened the status quo in the last 
half of the 19th Century and conquered half the globe in the first half of the 
20th. The specter of revolution -- or communist subversion, take your pick -- 
was the great fact of world politics for a century and a half. It is over. "The 
left" is dead. 
</P>
<P>
Of course leftists will insist this is news to them. Marxist-Leninists rule in 
Moscow, Beijing and a dozen other capitals. Almost every country has a 
Communist Party, many underground, and dozens of leftist revolutionary groups 
are plotting to seize power in the Third World. More important, democratic 
socialists have never ceded moral supremacy to the communist left and are far 
from moribund. 
</P>
<P>
But "the left" as a cultural fact, as a challenge to society's established 
order, as a locus of political discontent, as a promise or threat of radical 
upheaval -- the left, in short -- appears to have faded from the equation of 
world politics. Time was, not so long ago, when the left posed the first big 
question faced by every activist for whom politics was a passion before it 
became a profession -- yes or no, for or against, fellow traveler or principled 
opponent. The left was skilled at capturing the moral high ground -- as 
champion of the working class during the 20 years on either side of 1900, as 
the alternative to capitalism and fascism during the crisis of the 1930s, as 
the party of "peace" at the onset of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
The left was never monolithic: Marx himself, a polemicist without mercy or 
restraint, established the tradition of sectarian infighting among rival groups 
on the road to revolution. The Marxist left never won a free election. In 
Russia, as Vladimir I. Lenin said, power had been found lying in the streets 
after the czarist regime collapsed under the strain of World War I. The Soviet 
Red Army made the "revolutions" of Eastern Europe after 1945, and revolutions 
since -- in China, Cuba, Vietnam and Nicaragua -- were made by guerrilla armies 
and sustained by secret police. 
</P>
<P>
The political challenge posed by the left did not rely on the legitimacy of 
popular democratic support, but on other factors -- intellectual power, 
organizing skill, mastery of publicity and seizure of issues of transcending 
importance such as war and peace, poverty and social justice. For decades, 
leaders of the left understood better than ordinary politicians what they were 
doing, took the longest view, had the best writers, inspired lofty ideals, 
built formidable organizations, won the disciplined allegiance of able leaders, 
made the most noise and promised to make the biggest difference on issues that 
mattered. Above all, it offered a radical analysis of society -- tactical 
political maneuvering was always in the service of genuinely revolutionary 
ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
The Bolshevik success in Russia proved that "red revolution" was a real 
possibility. After Lenin established the Communist International (Comintern) in 
1919, the fear of militant Communism, supported on a global scale by Moscow, 
was a potent political factor everywhere. Twice the United States was swept by 
a "red scare" -- in the years after World War I and again after the World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
But that was the least of it. If the harsh victors' peace imposed on Germany in 
1918 was one great factor in the rise of Adolf Hitler, then fear of Bolshevism 
was the other -- and not just in Germany. The appeasement policies of Britain 
and France in the 1930s can be explained only partly by fear of another war, 
great as that was. Equally important was the panicky inability of allied 
leaders to see that fascism posed the greatest immediate danger to the 
stability of Europe, not Bolshevism. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, both the high-water mark of the left as a player on the world's 
stage and the fatal illness called "Stalinism" came in the 1930s. The twin 
crises of fascism and the Great Depression posed absolute challenges for which 
only the left seemed to offer an absolute solution. But in the emergency, the 
left swallowed Josef Stalin's lethal draught -- imposition of the world's least 
creative economic system, which made wartime austerity a fixture of Soviet 
society, and a purge that killed millions of Russians and forbade mourners to 
speak of it. No movement could survive failures so immense. 
</P>
<P>
But "fatally stricken" is not dead. Black crepe was not hung until Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev policies admitted the Soviet state's failure to provide for the 
safety and prosperity of its citizens. Fear of "red revolution" in the West did 
not survive the 1950s; now "world revolution" at the point of Soviet bayonets 
joins it in history's dustbin. Soviet analysts have conceded as much in the 
cautious language of bureaucrats walking the cat back. They will be explicit in 
time. 
</P>
<P>
It is often said that the cure for the ills of democracy is more democracy. The 
left might still have a few years to go if Gorbachev promised to cure Soviet 
ills with more Marxism or Leninism, but he does not. It is markets, not 
Marxism, he has chosen, and democracy, not Lenin's "democratic centralism." 
What may emerge from this is still to be seen, but the absolute solution of 
Marxism-Leninism is not even on the drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
The effect of the Soviet Union's agonizing reappraisal can be seen in every 
Marxist-Leninist state or party based on the Soviet model. Intransigence may be 
the order of the day in East Germany and Cuba, but the rigor and poverty of the 
system will be increasingly difficult to justify. As the Soviet Union 
surrenders its monolithic structure, however haltingly, its position as the 
moral center of gravity in the socialist camp will wither accordingly. A faith 
abandoned is a faith denied. One by one, the "fraternal states" will become 
less socialist, until no camp remains -- just a loose network of separate 
states with interests that change with the seasons. More important will be the 
effect on revolutionary movements still drawing up their own programs. It will 
be increasingly hard to pick Marxism-Leninism as a model demanding a detour 
through oppression and economic stagnation. Die-hards may insist they'll do it 
right this time, but as a rallying cry it sounds lame. 
</P>
<P>
None of this is meant to suggest that peace has arrived. The Soviet Union 
remains one of the world's great powers, a potent rival of the others and a 
potential threat to its neighbors. What is changing is the ideological cast to 
the conflict called the Cold War. The Soviet Union claimed, and other nations 
feared, that its own national interests came second to its role as champion of 
the left -- the immutable class war that promised revolutionary upheaval. The 
claim looked thin decades ago; now it's an embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Gorbachev may stumble. The recent Soviet elections tapped a vast 
reservoir of discontent and resentment; officials were stunned by crushing 
defeats in contests no amount of charity could call close. Fearing the 
whirlwind, the Soviet government may chuck Gorbachev and try to make some of it 
back. But no turning in the party line can redeem failures that have brought 
the world's first socialist revolution -- once Russia's proudest boast -- to 
the brink of moral, political and economic collapse. Desperate clinging to 
power is not the same as faith. The party, the army and the KGB may long for 
their eminence under Marxism-Leninism, but not even they believe in it. 
</P>
<P>
When the American journalist Lincoln Steffens returned from a visit to Russia 
in the early years of the revolution, he told reporters, "I have seen the 
future, and it works." He didn't mean the future of Russia, but of the world -- 
when it had been transformed by the left. The October Revolution made Russia 
the laboratory of the left, the "workers' homeland," the "vanguard of the 
revolution." Leftists may have privately agonized over the revolution's 
"excesses," but they stood fast -- explained away the horrors of 
collectivization and the purges, rallied in defense of Russia against Hitler, 
denounced U.S. imperialism and revised the history of the Cold War. But who 
defends the "workers' homeland" now? Who thinks there is one? 
</P>
<P>
The death of the left is a great cultural fact, signaling a change in the way 
the world talks to itself. Whatever else may be going on, "The Communist 
Manifesto" has moved from the streets to the libraries. Marx had his chance and 
the Soviet Union was it. Steffens was wrong: It didn't work. History does not 
pause for excuses. "Come the revolution" is an irony. 
</P>
<P>
But if the right may be forgiven a sigh of relief, it has no cause for 
rejoicing. Triumphant now, conservatives will soon feel their own cohesion 
slipping in the absence of the ancient enemy. Signs of political confusion can 
already be seen in Margaret Thatcher's Britain, Helmut Kohl's West Germany and 
George Bush's United States, as the old frontier between right and left loses 
definition. 
</P>
<P>
The death of the left has been a long time in coming and the inevitable 
realignment will not happen overnight. The Democrats in the United States are 
still bandaging the wounds of their failure in November; who would dare to 
predict what rallying cry might restore the sense of unity and purpose that 
made them unbeatable in the 1930s and 1940s? The left once offered a plausible 
alternative philosophy on how to organize a modern state. Until a new theory 
emerges, we are forced to tinker with what we have. Thatcherism and Reaganism 
tell us what to expect in the meantime, which is where we all live.

WEST BANK BODY COUNTS RISING EVEN AS WORLD PROSPECTS IMPROVE

<TEXT>
<P>
The Middle East holds more hope and more menace than it has for years. 
Important positive signs add touches of light. Yet bitter defense of the status 
quo, everyday violence and implacable suspicion make the outlook dark. A 
visitor this spring senses a witching hour in which events could move either 
way. 
</P>
<P>
The engine of change remains the intifada, the Palestinian uprising against 
Israeli occupation. After 16 months, the conflict is, if anything, more 
intense. On the Palestinian side, about 450 dead, many more injured, thousands 
in field prisons no better than concentration camps and curfews. Immobilizing 
villages has not broken resistance. The stone-throwing continues and all the 
heavy-handed measures of Israel's so-called civil administration (military 
personnel from top to bottom) only seem to compound the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The school system is shut down on the West Bank and children wander around with 
nothing to do except taunt the Israeli military patrols with stones and 
slingshots. (A 9-year-old can send a one-inch stone 100 yards and can really 
hurt someone at 60 feet.) 
</P>
<P>
The men and women of the United Nations' Relief and Works Agency, offering 
educational and health support to more than 800,000 refugees in the occupied 
territories, try to sustain local institutions. Yet Israeli authorities assert 
that schools are hotbeds of nationalism and violent opposition. They have also 
refused to allow children in the first three grades, just learning to read and 
write, to be taught at home by their parents under the guidance of visiting 
teachers. The Palestinians, hungry for learning, see this as a deliberate 
policy to condemn their children to illiteracy and they respond with 
incandescent hate. 
</P>
<P>
Economic pressure, harassment and humiliation are all-pervasive. A father 
wanting a birth certificate for a child must first apply at seven 
administrative offices for such things as a good conduct clearance. Exit fees 
for those permitted to travel abroad have gone up. The limit on money that may 
be brought into the capital-starved territories has gone down. Emergency 
regulations amount to martial law. A new ordinance restricts freedom of 
movement, requiring people to carry special identity cards. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1967, Israel has managed the economy of the occupied territories in the 
traditional mercantilist manner of a colonial power. In addition, it has seized 
much of the land and, more important, the water resources for its settlements. 
The West Bank and Gaza have been a captive market for Israeli consumer goods, a 
source of cheap labor and no competition. 
</P>
<P>
Until the intifada, occupation was a profitable enterprise for Israel. Now, 
Palestinians aim for a separate economy as a matter of liberation. The uprising 
has a Boston Tea Party aspect, along with the building of economic 
infrastructure and social self-help institutions. There is already a rather 
remarkable political cohesion. A revolving leadership withstands the Israeli 
security services' efforts to suppress it. And it appears to work by a popular 
consensus that the clumsy authorities are unable to co-opt. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's proposal for "democratic elections" is 
dismissed, even by Israelis in the peace camp, as a transparent play for time. 
Mohammed Milhem, one of the mayors elected in the last free election of 1976 
and then expelled by Israeli occupation forces in 1980, calls Shamir's 
suggestion a trick to identify and then expel Palestinian leaders. "A man will 
not be bitten twice by the same snake," he says. But he would consider a 
referendum, internationally supervised, on whether the people want the 
Palestine Liberation Organization to represent them. 
</P>
<P>
The intifada is a phenomenon. After erupting spontaneously, it has developed a 
program to justify the depth of the struggle -- a Palestinian state living in 
peace with Israel, arrived at through political settlement. The intifada has 
imposed this program on laggard leaders outside, specifically the PLO and Arab 
regimes that have spent decades ineffectually juggling the hot potato of 
Palestinian nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
Astonishingly, official Israel appears unaffected. The tired leaders of Labor 
and the jingoists of Likud have found no better common ground than Defense 
Minister Yitzhak Rabin's declared policy of "force, might and beatings." The 
casuality rate is as high as ever and one of the worst incidents occurred less 
than two weeks ago. Elias Freij, the Christian mayor of Bethlehem called it an 
unprovoked massacre -- at least five dead and dozens injured in one village. 
Chief among the perpetrators were Druze border police, known for brutality 
toward Palestinians and now employed in larger numbers at places previously 
patrolled by the Israeli army. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly ominous was an incident earlier in April when a man in Israeli 
army uniform turned a submachine gun on a group of Palestinians near the Jaffa 
Gate of old Jerusalem, killing one and wounding two. Telephone callers claimed 
responsibility in the name of the Sicarii. Sicarii, alluding to a dagger, was 
the name used by Zealot guerrillas who fought the Roman occupation in the time 
of Christ. In recent months, the modern Sicarii has been linked to acts of 
vandalism, fire bombing and vicious intimidation against men and women in the 
Israeli peace movement or deemed to be pro-Arab. Now observers think Sicarii 
may be setting out to kill Palestinians in a sort of counter-intifada. 
</P>
<P>
Israelis as well as Arabs think the binary tragedy, occupation-intifada, can 
continue for years despite the human and material costs. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the big political picture has improved in one essential aspect. Middle East 
battles are no longer amplified or exploited in the tensions and polarization 
of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and the Soviet Union urge compromise, a peace with Israel's 
security and Palestinian political rights in stable balance. As Washington has 
made contact with the PLO, Moscow has reached out to Israel (also to Egypt and 
Saudi Arabia). The Kremlin is telling Syria that there can be no military 
solution and no further deliveries of offensive weapons to pursue one. Syria's 
recent attack on a Soviet ship in the Mediterranean may be a kick in the shin 
for this, but Damascus has nowhere else to turn. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the tone if not the substance of the U.S.-Israeli 
relationship has changed. Impatience with the Likud government's inflexibility 
shows. Shamir's security argument, that once trumped all criticism, is less 
credible now. The threat has shrunk. Egypt has long since made peace with 
Israel; Jordan seeks it. 
</P>
<P>
Prospects for peaceful adjustment to new realities are not hopeless; but given 
the explosive alternative, the sooner the better.

BRAZIL TRIES TO STOP SLASH-AND-BURN DESTRUCTION OF RICH AMAZON FORESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By William R. Long, William R. Long is The Times' correspondent in Rio de 
Janeiro. 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
PORTO VELHO, BRAZIL 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here in the state of Rondonia on the southern flank of the great Amazon rain 
forest, a new frontier opened up in the late 1970s. Encouraged for a decade by 
the Brazilian government, hundreds of thousands of settlers came to help push 
back the wilderness and share the bounty. Rondonia was the land of opportunity, 
the Golden West of Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
Now the heady frontier spirit has faded and a new realism seems to be setting 
in. 
</P>
<P>
Slash-and-burn farming and ranching has stripped away as much as one-third of 
the forest that once protected Rondonia's soil from the baking sun and leaching 
rains. The state's jungle Indian population has dwindled from 40,000 to 5,000, 
according to a study by Brazilian anthropologist Cecilia Meireles. 
</P>
<P>
Small farmers who thought Rondonia promised an escape from poverty have failed 
to improve their lot. Malaria is a frequent visitor at makeshift rural homes. 
Porto Velho, the state capital, is crowded with slum dwellers who gave up on 
the land. Although the government spent hundreds of millions of dollars on a 
frontier development program called Polonoroeste, farmers have received little 
technical or financial aid. More than half the land they have cleared is 
uncultivated and has given way to a matted growth of secondary brush called 
capoeira. 
</P>
<P>
Like other areas on the Amazon frontier, Rondonia obviously hasn't turned out 
the way it was supposed to. Officials here don't need foreign conservationists 
to tell them that, but in the past year, European and American worries about 
destruction of the Amazon forest have poured down on Brazil like tropical rain. 
Perhaps because of the international pressure, perhaps because it makes sense, 
Brazilian authorities are adopting new policies aimed at slowing the 
destruction. Some conservationists are skeptical about the effectiveness of the 
policies, but at least on paper, preservation is becoming the new official 
watchword in the Amazon region of Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
President Jose Sarney has announced a series of protective measures in a 
program called "Our Nature." One new decree suspends official credits and tax 
breaks that had encouraged cattle ranchers to turn forest into pasture. The 
program also includes a zoning study that would put huge forest areas 
off-limits to ranchers, farmers, loggers and miners. 
</P>
<P>
The Rondonia state government already has its own zoning plan. Approved last 
June, it limits agricultural activities largely to central and southern areas 
of the state where most deforestation has taken place and where soils are 
richest. 
</P>
<P>
Vice Gov. Orestes Muniz, also Rondonia's planning secretary, says that by 
recovering millions of acres gone to capoeira, the state can save vast areas of 
virgin forest from the wasteful slash-and-burn cycle. Technicians are also 
experimenting with the use of capoeira as cover for crops that require shade, 
such as coffee and fruit trees. 
</P>
<P>
Muniz said the zoning plan sets aside about 60% of the state's territory as 
natural preserves. To enforce protective measures, the state police force has 
created a forest patrol unit that now employs 350 officers and eventually will 
have 1,000. A freeze on all deforestation is in effect, pending implementation 
of the plan. Thirty percent of the state is designated as extractive reserves 
and managed forests, where rubber, Brazil nuts, medicinal plants and selected 
hardwoods and other products can be harvested without deforestation. Officials 
say the potential for economic returns is great. Rondonia woodlands contain an 
estimated 40,000 plant species, only about a tenth of which have been 
classified and studied. Another 30% of preserved forest area includes natural 
parks and Indian lands. 
</P>
<P>
To implement the plan, the state is starting a program called Planafloro, with 
projects for education, technical aid and financing to help people to preserve 
the forest while exploiting its riches. 
</P>
<P>
"To the extent that the small producer gets income from the standing forest, he 
will not cut more down," said Teodorico Rocha, a federal official helping on 
the Planafloro. 
</P>
<P>
Planafloro will cost an estimated $213 million, and the national government is 
negotiating for a loan from the World Bank to cover part of the cost. Rocha 
said it is "absurd" for Brazil to increase the heavy burden of its $115 billion 
foreign debt, but the country cannot afford to pay for the conservation program 
by itself. 
</P>
<P>
"There is consciousness for preserving the environment in Rondonia," he said. 
"What is lacking are the means, financing." 
</P>
<P>
In an emotional speech this month, President Sarney appealed to foreigners who 
accuse Brazil of destroying the Amazon to help provide the means for preserving 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"Transfer technology to us without costs," Sarney said. "Help us to combat the 
burning with airplanes, with equipment, with products. Help us to reforest with 
material, scientific and human resources." 
</P>
<P>
Foreign aid alone cannot prevent further destruction in the Amazon by economic 
interests and ignorance, but Brazilians who want to save the forest need all 
the help they can get.

'THE OIL CONNECTIONS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial ("The Oil Connections," April 15) which called for the 
cancellation of federal plans to promote offshore oil drilling off the coast of 
Northern California was eloquent and timely, yet ironically deficient in its 
failure to focus on the threat to the coast of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Lease Sale 95 is a federal plan to lease 5 million acres extending from San 
Diego to San Luis Obispo. Southern Californians need to take a hard look at the 
costs and benefits of offshore oil drilling. 
</P>
<P>
The adverse environmental impacts of offshore oil development are substantial. 
On average, each drilling platform generates 75,000 to 100,000 tons of toxic 
waste which are dumped over the side into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
In one day, a single exploratory drill ship releases the smog-generating 
equivalent of 7,000 cars driving 50 miles. 
</P>
<P>
The editorial was on the mark by noting that the ability to contain and clean 
up spills must be a key consideration in whether to proceed with offshore oil 
drilling. According to the Department of the Interior, the probability of a 
large spill in California as a result of offshore oil drilling is 99%. Based on 
a Coast Guard analysis and our experience in Alaska, we know that on average, 
only 5% to 15% of a spill can be cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
The President's OCS task force will be holding public meetings in the San 
Diego/Los Angeles area the week of May 22, to hear citizens views on Lease Sale 
95. This is an opportunity for Southern California residents to say "no more 
Alaskas," and call for responsible development if there is to be any 
development at all. 
</P>
<P>
The American Oceans Conservation Committee is the political arm of the American 
Oceans Campaign. The AOCC is a broad-based coalition of elected officials and 
citizens opposed to Lease Sale 95, and committed to working with Congress for 
development of a national energy policy that minimizes the conflict with the 
environment. We have developed educational brochures on offshore oil drilling. 
</P>
<P>
We urge elected officials, business people and other citizens to take a hard 
look at the future, and evaluate whether we can actually afford offshore oil 
drilling. 
</P>
<P>
We hope that The Times will play a continuing role in the discussion of the 
pros and cons of Lease Sale 95.

LEBANON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lebanon erupts again, time to dig out the old inane cliches: Muslim-Christian 
civil war, Syrian President Hafez Assad's role as a power broker, Syria's 
peacekeeping role, etc. I wish to thank The Times and, especially, Robin Wright 
for rising above that level and above the rest of the press in an article about 
Lebanon (Part I, April 8). 
</P>
<P>
While the violence in Lebanon repeats itself, relations between forces and 
factions sometimes do change. Robin Wright went beyond artillery shells and 
told us about some of these changes: that not only the Christians resent 
Syria's presence, that (Christian) acting chief of state Michael Aoun wants 
reforms (but not under the Syrian gun), that the principal Muslim factions are 
on the sidelines in this latest round, etc. It was heartening to read "real" 
news about Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
It was also particularly interesting to read about the too often ignored Syrian 
role in Lebanon. The U.S. media at large have so far treated that role about 
the same way the Syrian-controlled press has. Is it sloppiness or is it Assad's 
long reach? I am not sure which is worse. 
</P>
<P>
Thank you again for "real" news about Lebanon's latest nightmare.

GUN CONTROL: 'GET IT DONE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dick Gregory said, "Hell hath no fury like a liberal scorned." Though still 
honored by the media, liberals have not thrived lately in the West, 
particularly in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
The liberal run amok is seen clearest in the orchestrated response to the 
Patrick Purdy killings in Stockton. By a precarious margin, a bill was rammed 
through the California Assembly banning "semiautomatic assault weapons." 
Ignored in all the screaming was any realistic definition. Dictated by common 
sense and protected by the Second Amendment of the Bill of Rights, I keep by my 
bed the service .45 I brought back from World War II. It's a semiautomatic 
weapon. I do not plan to surrender it. 
</P>
<P>
The irrationality of the clamor for anti-gun legislation is best demonstrated 
by considering the drug problem, which threatens to bring the nation to its 
knees. Dealing, use, or possession of drugs have long been felony offenses 
carrying the harshest penalties and condemned at every level of society. Yet 
all this legislation has hardly rippled the surface of the drug culture. We're 
now considering draconian enforcement, including the use of the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, American gun owners have historically been a majority in this 
country, overwhelmingly law-abiding. Since the failure of British efforts to 
confiscate the arms of American colonists before and during our Revolution, 
this right has been embedded in our Constitution. Efforts to dislodge it are 
unlikely to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
Drug users and dealers are criminals. Very few gun owners are. Purdy was one of 
them. Before his murderous rampage in Stockton, he'd been arrested seven times 
on charges ranging from armed robbery, firearms and narcotics violations, to 
sexual assault. His attorneys and the judicial system plea bargained his felony 
offenses down to misdemeanors, leaving no felony record. Purdy should've been 
in prison long before he slaughtered five children. It was not the lack of gun 
laws that kept him free, or killed those kids. 
</P>
<P>
Americans have forgotten the maxim, "If it is ain't broke, don't fix it." 
Fixing things has become a national passion. Out of several billion Chilean 
grapes, two grapes showed traces of cyanide, and fruit spray on apples seemed 
to cause cancer in mice . . . or was it the other way around? When the smoke 
cleared, the harvest of Chilean and American farmers was ruined by "fixing it." 
</P>
<P>
Edmund Burke, one of the architects of democracy, observed how ready men are to 
substitute emotion for reason "until past the time when reason can any longer 
serve." With Chilean grapes, American apples and American guns, let's hope 
reason can still serve.

GUN CONTROL: 'GET IT DONE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sixteen people killed in Soviet Georgia. Tanks and armed soldiers deployed to 
suppress people demonstrating for freedom and independence. Stiff prison 
sentences and heavy fines imposed upon anyone publishing or circulating 
literature which criticizes the government. Confiscation of previously 
registered firearms. 
</P>
<P>
And so much for glasnost. 
</P>
<P>
Americans would do well to learn from the example set by the Soviets that 
freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and other civil liberties are more 
easily destroyed after firearms are registered and banned from individual 
ownership. The Second Amendment to the Constitution protects and guarantees the 
longevity of the others. Some of our governing officials are aware of this 
fact. How they choose to act upon this knowledge will one way or another affect 
all of our lives in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who cherishes a particular constitutional right should think about this; 
if the Second Amendment goes, sooner or later all of them will go.

GINGRICH'S CORRUPTION ARGUMENT IS SO MUCH MALARKEY

We seem to reserve the accusations of unethical behavior for the simple, 
direct, everyday misdeeds. The hand in the till. The body in the wrong bed. 
Corruption. Drunkenness. Thou Shalt Not Steal. 
</P>
<P>
We are much slower to discuss, let alone decide, the ethics of governing and 
managing. What kind of ethics are behind the decisions to build bombers or 
housing? What value judgments can be made about the choice to develop land or 
conserve it? How do we decide which governments to back? How do we determine 
our Third World friends and enemies? 
</P>
<P>
These are harder and more divisive questions. We prefer to put them in the 
utilitarian realm of practical politics, to keep them out of heated atmosphere 
in which values are discussed. We risk being accused of naivete for questions 
that sound like cliches: How do you make a choice between swords and 
plowshares? Yet these are also in the realm of ethics. 
</P>
<P>
I am not suggesting that we turn down the concern over personal ethics, 
although at times it can be a distraction, even a cover. I think rather that we 
should expand the attention, the circle of light, to a much wider arena. We are 
comfortable talking about the ethics of politicians. We should be equally 
comfortable discussing the ethics of politics.

Jim Wright's downfall will be healthy if Congress's zeal for ethical witch 
hunts dies with his speakership. Yes, we should encourage high standards of 
personal ethics by those in government. But the way to get high standards is to 
get good people, and the present malicious mania for minutiae drives away from 
government the best of those we should strive to get into government. The best 
don't need a 6-foot shelf of law books to tell right from wrong. And their 
interest is in serious governance, not the politics of competitive sanctimony.

A TROUBLED CHINA NEEDS DEMOCRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HALL GARDNER, Hall Gardner is a visiting professor of American government 
and comparative politics at the Johns Hopkins-Nanjing Center for Chinese and 
American Studies at Nanjing University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NANJING, China 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Near the main gates of the Nanjing University campus, hundreds of people have 
crowded each day to read posters pasted over blackboards that normally announce 
the day's events. Since the death of Hu Yaobang, regarded by many as a 
spokesperson for democracy until his ouster from the Central Committee in 1987 
after student demonstrations, students throughout China have erected their own 
democracy walls. 
</P>
<P>
The posters, generally written in hasty Chinese calligraphy, express varying 
political sentiments. Some of the posters have altered the text of classical 
Chinese poetry, giving the words a more relevant meaning. Others rewrite 
political slogans: Sun Yat Sen's famous saying -- "If the revolution is not 
successful, we must struggle again!" -- has been transformed into "If the 
reforms are not successful, we must struggle again!" This refers to the fact 
that the Communist Party has begun to backtrack on the political reforms that 
it has implemented over the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Posters that criticize Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping have been quickly torn down 
by plainclothes public security agents. Some of the posters say that China 
needs more "openness," referring to glasnost and the reforms of Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev in the Soviet Union. Most of the posters call for more democracy: "Hu 
Yaobang is dead; but democracy is not"; "The Chinese do not fear to live, why 
should they fear to die?" and "We want democracy now!" 
</P>
<P>
China is in deep trouble. The Communist Party retrenchment is aimed at 
fostering centralization, controlling provincial governments, slowing down the 
overheated economy and squashing the demand for political reforms. Not enough 
progress has been made to release political prisoners, to compromise with the 
Dalai Lama over Tibetan autonomy and to end the state of animosity that exists 
between the mainland and Taiwan. There have been essentially two responses to 
China's crisis. One is called the "new authoritarianism." The other is the 
"pro-democracy" movement. 
</P>
<P>
New authoritarianism has been favored by Communist Party General Secretary Zhao 
Ziyang in his call for a "new authority" to get the country rolling again by 
establishing a pure market economy led by a new class of technocratic 
entrepreneurs. The new authoritarians argue that China should emulate countries 
such as South Korea, Brazil and, ironically, Taiwan to deal with China's 
tremendous problems: the inability to compete on the world market, its lack of 
advanced technology, its overpopulation, as well as the problems created by 
political and social dissent. The example countries, it is argued, were able to 
develop because of iron discipline and the repression of democratic sentiment. 
As uneducated peasants cannot comprehend the issues of population control or 
democracy, a strong, uncorruptable elite must bring the population bomb under 
control and make China capable of competing economically and militarily with 
the West and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the pro-democracy movement argues that the only way to 
resolve China's tremendous difficulties is to expand, not retract, steps toward 
freedom of speech and assembly, freedom of movement, accountability of 
government through open and free elections and the non-discriminatory 
implementation of laws through an independent judiciary and a system of checks 
and balances. China's severe population problems can be handled by mor 
intensive efforts in general and sex education. Its economic problems can be 
dealt with by greater economic liberalism, involving a mix of public managers, 
private entrepreneurs and worker's cooperatives with shared ownership and 
control. 
</P>
<P>
China does not need to militarize. As Fang Lizhi, the pro-democracy spokesman 
and astrophysicist, argues, China should call for the mutual renunciation of 
force as a means to settle its dispute with Taiwan. Additionally, China's claim 
to Taiwan, its naval and nuclear-weapons buildup and its arms sales abroad can 
only further militarize the situation in Asia, impelling Japan, India and other 
states to augment their naval and military capabilities -- a situation no one 
in Asia wants to see. 
</P>
<P>
The new authoritarian claim that China lacks a democratic tradition is 
historically inaccurate. The fledgling movement for democracy was initiated 
between 1905-14, but unfortunately failed as China went into the period of "war 
lords." While both the movement for democracy and the new authoritarians 
believe that the formation of a new middle and entrepreneurial class should be 
encouraged, such a class must not be able to take the law into its own hands, 
as implied by the new authoritarians. Thus, to prevent such a class from ruling 
"from above," the movement for democracy must carefully interact with and 
educate grass-roots Chinese society to understand the process, principles and 
structures of democracy. It should study the strides taken by Chinese democracy 
in the past, and attempt to enlarge upon some of those successes and, of 
course, seek to avoid similar mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
Without democratic accountability, the "new authoritarianism" differs very 
little from its Maoist predecessor. It's time to give Chinese democracy a 
chance.

GINGRICH'S CORRUPTION ARGUMENT IS SO MUCH MALARKEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID S. BRODER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) is not satisfied by the prospect of nailing Jim 
Wright's hide to the wall. In a succession of press sessions, he has been 
arguing that the scandal that has enveloped the highest elected Democrat in the 
land is just the tip of the iceberg. It's a symbol, Gingrich argues, of the 
"institutional corruption" that is endemic wherever Democrats have been in 
control for years -- whether in the House of Representatives or in city halls 
from New York City to Chicago to Jersey City. 
</P>
<P>
Like all conspiracy theories, this one works better as an outlet for 
frustration than it does as a tool of analysis. The same man who sees the 
Congress in which he serves as a cesspool of "institutional corruption and 
abuse of power" can find nothing "systemic" about the instances of illegality 
in the executive branch, whether it's the Pentagon procurement scandals or the 
Iran-Contra affair. 
</P>
<P>
But Gingrich has a problem in elementary logic. If the House has been as 
thoroughly debauched after 35 years of control by the same party as he asserts, 
it's hard to figure why the boss man of this corrupt institution is in such 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
If you're examining the record without the partisan, ideological blinders that 
Gingrich wears, the evidence suggests that the House has done a far better job 
of dealing with its bad actors than the White House and the executive branch 
have done in cleaning up their breaches of conduct. 
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 years, the House has moved to expel four members for misconduct. 
Three of them resigned to avoid that humiliation and the fourth was, in fact, 
expelled. It has formally censured four members. Reprimands or other forms of 
mild fault-finding were voted on another dozen members. That is hardly a 
pattern suggesting a calculated, callous indifference to the rules of conduct. 
</P>
<P>
It's politically tempting to say, based on the charges facing Wright, that the 
House is corrupt from top to bottom. But the record shows that the House has 
done a lot more to cleanse itself than the executive branch can claim. So spare 
us, please, this "institutional corruption" malarkey.

HISTORY LIVES AT WORLD'S BEST-KNOWN COURTHOUSE

<TEXT>
<P>
In the dim and deplorable past, a prisoner refused to plead guilty to murder at 
Old Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
An infuriated judge ordered: "He be laid on his back, that his arms be 
stretched with a cord, and in like manner his legs, and that upon his body 
shall be laid as much iron and stone as he can bear, and more, and this shall 
be his punishment until he die." 
</P>
<P>
The prisoner was thus tortured in the Press Yard of infamous Newgate Prison, 
then on the Old Bailey site. His friends added their own bodies to the weights 
to hasten his death and relieve him of his pain. 
</P>
<P>
That was England of the 17th Century, and such Draconian horrors were not 
unusual. Children were hanged for theft. One wretch received seven years' 
banishment to Africa for stealing a handkerchief. The accused were considered 
guilty until acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
Sentences included whipping, branding and jailing in appalling conditions -- 
starvation, crowding, filth, depravity and cold. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deadly for All 
</P>
<P>
To combat the stomach-wrenching stench, vinegar fumes were pumped into the 
court and the justices were issued nosegays. One outbreak of "gaol fever" 
(typhus) in 1750 took 50 lives, including the Lord Mayor, two judges and a 
sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
Old Bailey's real name is the Central Criminal Court of England. Old Bailey is 
its street. 
</P>
<P>
The original structure was replaced in 1423 but was destroyed by the Great Fire 
of 1666. Rebuilt, it continued to be a cesspool of filth and inhuman treatment. 
</P>
<P>
In 1774 the first proper courthouse was raised, and the oldest part of the 
present complex was dedicated by Edward VII in 1907. 
</P>
<P>
It is called The Bailey by almost everyone, and its senior chamber has become 
the most celebrated criminal courtroom in the world. The martyred Sir Thomas 
More was once its "governor." Here were tried Guy Fawkes, Daniel Defoe and 
William Penn. 
</P>
<P>
More recently it has staged the dramas surrounding Oscar Wilde, Lord Haw Haw 
and the Yorkshire Ripper. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traditional Garb 
</P>
<P>
The Bailey serves London and parts of neighboring counties, so on any day its 
19 courts are theaters wherein bewigged barristers and pin-striped solicitors 
debate the fates of accused murderers, rapists and thieves from a population of 
more than 8 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Bailey dominates its prosaic byway near the end of Fleet Street and almost 
in the shadow of St. Paul's Cathedral. The granite and stone courthouse might 
be any other office block at London's financial heart were it not for the dome 
atop its 1907 portion with its gilded statue of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
In this case the lady is not blindfolded, the British belief being that justice 
should have full sight. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath her feet lies the massively marbled hall of the older building, with 
its murals depicting milestones in jurisprudence such as Moses and the divine 
laws, Roman Law, King Alfred and the Magna Charta. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately across the street is the Magpie and Stump public house, which once 
charged hefty fees to watch public hangings from its upper windows. The last of 
these spectacles was in 1868. (Peers were strung up with a silver cord, 
commoners with plain rope.) 
</P>
<P>
Bailey regulars still frequent the pub for twilight refreshment and critiques. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Populated With Witnesses 
</P>
<P>
The Bailey is entered through an unadorned lower hall, populated like any other 
outer court with witnesses, attorneys and relatives of the accused. 
</P>
<P>
In the historic oak-paneled Number-One Court, the defendant sits in a 
glassed-in dock accompanied only by a prison officer. The wigged and 
black-gowned barristers speak for their clients; solicitors perform only in 
advisory capacities. 
</P>
<P>
The red-robed senior judge presides from a dais under a golden sword presented 
to the Lord Mayor by the Cutlers Co. in 1753. 
</P>
<P>
No one is armed at the Bailey except its undersheriff-administrator, who wears 
a sword during traditional morning ceremonies when the courts are opened. The 
cutlass is never carried in the afternoon, ever since a long-ago sheriff 
prodded a judge after lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Proceedings are subdued. One is struck by the civility, the frequency of such 
expressions as "May it please your lordship," and "If you will be so kind," 
often directed to the most unsavory ruffian in the dock. 
</P>
<P>
There are sections of the Bailey that the public rarely sees. Behind the courts 
is the sheriffs' hall with its tastefully appointed offices, rows of oil 
paintings and air of efficiency and courtesy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Holding Cells 
</P>
<P>
Two flights below is a less-hospitable scene: 70 holding cells to which 
defendants are taken to their trials from other confinement. A few of the 
cubicles have not been modernized, and remain coffin-like cavities with a 
single pallet. 
</P>
<P>
Here too is Dead Man's Walk, a dank and dark passageway along which thousands 
stumbled to the gallows. 
</P>
<P>
Today the Bailey is a 1980s temple of compassionate justice, its days of infamy 
living only in legend. 
</P>
<P>
At 1 p.m. the justices retire in their robes and wigs to sip a sociable glass 
of sherry or fruit juice and have lunch. The long room is warmly lighted, its 
walls lined with the escutcheons of past justices and signed portraits of the 
royal family. 
</P>
<P>
Talk is light and humor-tinged -- of cricket, travel, children, gardening and 
that mainstay of British conversation, the weather. 
</P>
<P>
There is scant mention of the grim business to which they will return, the 
enormous weight of the Bailey's drama, the lives that are hourly being ruined, 
revenged, reshaped or salvaged. 
</P>
<P>
On surrounding streets the city's ubiquitous snack bars do brisk business. Some 
of their customers nibbling submarine sandwiches wear the wigs of centuries of 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Spectator galleries at the Old Bailey are open to the public from 10 a.m. to 1 
p.m. and from 2 to 4 p.m. on a first-come basis. No children are admitted.

IN FOOTSTEPS OF JOHN WILKES BOOTH

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two strangers, one with a broken leg, arrived at the Maryland farmhouse of Dr. 
Samuel Mudd early on April 15, 1865. Dr. Mudd set the injured man's leg and 
afterward invited his patient and guest to rest in a spare bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
The patient was John Wilkes Booth, who hours earlier had fatally shot President 
Abraham Lincoln at Ford's Theater in Washington, D.C., about 30 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
For setting the leg of Lincoln's assassin, Dr. Mudd was tried and found guilty 
of conspiracy to murder Lincoln and sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Mudd's wood-frame house still stands, as does Ford's Theater and other 
major sites where Booth stopped on his escape from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fascinated by the Crime 
</P>
<P>
Because of so much interest in the crime the Surratt Society, a volunteer 
organization operating the Surratt Tavern, another Booth-related landmark, 
sponsors bus tours retracing Booth's steps from Ford's Theater to the site of 
Garrett's Farm, where Booth died. 
</P>
<P>
The John Wilkes Booth Escape Route Tour is offered twice a year, during April 
and September. Tours are generally booked far in advance, and third and fourth 
tours are sometimes scheduled to accommodate those on waiting lists. 
</P>
<P>
An alternative is to guide yourself through Booth's escape route. Many of the 
roads traveled by Booth still exist, and four buildings associated with the 
assassination are open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln went to Ford's Theater to see "Our American Cousin." Booth sneaked into 
the President's box and shot Lincoln in the back of the head. 
</P>
<P>
The assassination was part of a conspiracy. Initially, Booth and six others met 
in the Surratt Boarding House on H Street in Washington, and plotted to kidnap 
the President. 
</P>
<P>
One was John Surratt Jr., son of the owner of the house, Mary Surratt. 
</P>
<P>
After those plans went awry, three conspirators, including Surratt, bowed out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Plot Turned 
</P>
<P>
As the Civil War came to an end the plot turned from kidnaping to murder. Booth 
schemed to kill Lincoln while his compatriots would murder Vice President 
Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William Seward. Only Booth was 
successful, shooting Lincoln at 10:15 p.m. on April 14. 
</P>
<P>
Two months after the assassination, owner John T. Ford planned to reopen his 
theater, but an indignant public protested. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the brick showplace on 10th Street wasn't reopened as a theater 
until 1968. Thanks to a painstaking restoration during the 1960s, it looks as 
it did the night of April 14, 1865. 
</P>
<P>
Reproduction American flags drape the presidential box, where the President and 
Mary Lincoln sat with two guests. An original framed engraving of George 
Washington hangs from the box as it did that night. 
</P>
<P>
You can't enter the presidential box today but can peer inside through a glass 
panel. Crimson damask furniture, including an original sofa, set off the box. 
Lincoln sat in a rocker like the one near the door, within easy reach of 
Booth's outstretched arm. 
</P>
<P>
Booth escaped by jumping from the presidential box to the stage floor and 
running out a back door. 
</P>
<P>
Normally the 11-foot, 6-inch jump would have been easy for the agile Booth. But 
he caught a spur on a flag draping the box, lost his balance and broke the 
lower bone in his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
If you visit at the right time, take a seat in the balcony and listen to a 
National Park Service guide weave the tale of that infamous night and the 
idiosyncrasies of the theater that Booth knew so well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Grisly Relics 
</P>
<P>
The basement museum, however, is being refurbished and will not reopen until 
April of next year. All the grisly relics, such as Booth's single-shot 
derringer pistol and the suit Lincoln wore to the theater, are in storage. 
</P>
<P>
While Booth was riding horseback toward the Navy Yard Bridge and Maryland, the 
President was carried across the street to William Peterson's house, a narrow, 
red-brick structure typical of many in Washington at that time. 
</P>
<P>
After Lincoln died in a rear bedroom, Victorian era tourists continually 
paraded by, hoping for a peek inside. Finally, in 1880, Congress began efforts 
to memorialize it. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 years later the curious come for the same reason. What they see 
is a home that looks virtually as it did in 1865. 
</P>
<P>
In the bedroom where the President died the muted brownish wallpaper duplicates 
what was there in 1865. The furniture is of the same period, while the pillow, 
protected by a plastic cover, is the one on which Lincoln's head rested. 
</P>
<P>
Coats and a hat hang on hooks, and the rocking chair is similar to the one in 
which Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles sat for hours watching over the dying 
Chief Executive. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Lincoln spent a miserable night, grieving on the sofa in the front parlor. 
By midnight Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton began interviewing witnesses in 
the adjacent rear parlor. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time John Wilkes Booth and an accomplice, David Herold, were 
already 10 miles away in Surrattsville, now Clinton, Md., at the Surratt 
Tavern, picking up a carbine and field glasses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ran Boarding House 
</P>
<P>
The tavern was operated through a lease by Mary Surratt, the same woman who ran 
the H Street boarding house where the conspirators met. 
</P>
<P>
The tavern also served as a polling place and post office; original letters to 
Surrattsville are sorted and still waiting to be collected. 
</P>
<P>
But look in a small storage room over the kitchen and you'll see something a 
little more foreboding -- a carbine like the one Booth meant to take on his 
escape. 
</P>
<P>
Herold took a gun but Booth declined, claiming he couldn't carry one because of 
his broken leg, which forced him to stop at Dr. Mudd's house at about 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the staff at the Surratt Tavern, which takes no sides regarding the 
guilt or innocence of the conspirators, the Mudd Society offers tours of Dr. 
Mudd's Waldorf, Md., home from the premise that he was innocent. 
</P>
<P>
On the morning of April 15, 1865, after the doctor set Booth's leg on the 
velvet sofa in the parlor he sent him upstairs to rest in the spare bedroom now 
called the Booth Room. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Mudd should have been sent to prison is still being debated by 
historians. Booth apparently knew the doctor's name when he knocked on the door 
that April morning, and evidence shows that the two had met before. 
</P>
<P>
It is also known that Booth wore false whiskers when he arrived at the doctor's 
house after shooting Lincoln, and it is possible that Mudd didn't recognize 
Booth. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, after serving four years of a life term Mudd was pardoned by 
President Andrew Johnson in 1869. 
</P>
<P>
The law finally caught up with Booth at Garrett's Farm four miles outside Port 
Royal, Va. Herold surrendered, but Booth refused. Although some historians 
claim that he committed suicide, he most likely was shot and killed by Union 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
The only tangible evidence of Booth's Waterloo is a historic marker in the 
median strip of U.S. 301. It reads: 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the Garrett place where John Wilkes Booth, assassin of Lincoln, was 
cornered by Union soldiers and killed April 26, 1865. The house stood a short 
distance from this spot." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ford's Theater and the House Where Lincoln Died are open daily, except 
Christmas, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is free. For more information, contact 
the Site Manager, Ford's Theater, 511 10th St. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20004,

</P>
<P>

TRAVELER'S DIARY: HAVING A BALL AND COLLECTING CALORIES IN VIENNA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HORACE SUTTON, Sutton is a New York City syndicated travel columnist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Annamarie Victory, a tour guide, can have you eating bear's paw if you follow 
her to China on a gourmet tour of Cathay, or have you waltzing at the Imperial 
Ball if you follow her to Vienna for New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the Vienna tour is $5,800 for six days, flying Air France's 
Concorde both ways. 
</P>
<P>
As a warm-up to the Imperial Ball, the evening of Dec. 30, 1989 includes a 
string quartet concert in the crystal and marble fantasy of Pallavicini Palace, 
normally used for diplomatic functions. 
</P>
<P>
The palace has been in the family for 150 years. Hostess at cocktails and the 
dinner afterward will be the Countess Pallavicini, accompanied by American 
Ambassador and Mrs. Henry Grunwald. Grunwald is the former editor of Time 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the next evening at the Imperial Palace, waltz lessons are 
given in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
Those who already know how to waltz will be taken on a walking tour of old 
Vienna. Some tickets will be available for the performance of "Die Fledermaus," 
with opera-goers proceeding to the ball after the last curtain call. 
</P>
<P>
Victory's other tours include calorie-collecting jaunts to 
</P>
<P>
Belgium, France, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Portugal and, in the fall, China, 
Hong Kong and Bangkok. 
</P>
<P>
In France, Victory stops at the Le Bristol Hotel, at 112 Faubourg St. Honore, 
and takes tour participants dining at Taillevent. Then they catch the train for 
Vezelay and dine at L'Esperance, the 19th-Century villa of Marc Meneau. Both 
restaurants have been awarded Michelin's three stars. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, in Lyon, they will dine with Paul Bocuse. Then onward to Mionnay to 
eat with Alain Chapel, said to be the originator of nouvelle cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
Next is L'Oustau de Baumaniere, whose 88-year-old owner is still overseeing 
this restaurant in Provence. Afterward, there is a cooking lesson from the 
master, Roger Verge, at Mougins. 
</P>
<P>
Lunch the next day is served among the pigeons and paintings of La Colombe d'Or 
at St. Paul de Vence, high in the hills above the Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
If Victory visits Italy, she will cap a Tuscan tour (seven nights, $2,950 per 
person, $300 extra if you want a room to yourself) with an evening prepared by 
Ambroglio Folonari Ruffino, who helped Chianti wines to a classico designation. 
</P>
<P>
In Switzerland, tours get to Freddy Girardet's temple of gastronomy at 
Crissier. 
</P>
<P>
A trip to the Orient in the spring and another in the fall cost about $5,000 
per person, plus another $1,000 if you want a room of your own. 
</P>
<P>
Don't forget to add air fare. But tips for chambermaids and room tax are 
included. 
</P>
<P>
Victory takes her group to Hong Kong on Singapore Airlines, and registers them 
in the Regent Hotel that hangs over Hong Kong Harbor at Kowloon. A master eater 
named T. C. Lei, who wrote "Chinese Food for Thought," will lead the 
participants through goose hearts, duck webs, duck's tongue and the right paw 
(you don't eat the left one) of a Chinese bear. All this takes place at Fuk Lam 
Moon on Hong Kong Island. 
</P>
<P>
The next day it's off to Beijing and the Ching Juang hotel. At a dumpling bash, 
25 kinds are offered -- fried, steamed and baked -- an indulgence that requires 
three hours at the table. 
</P>
<P>
For more information, you can contact Annamarie Victory at 136 East 64th St., 
New York 10021, (212) 486-0353.

YOUTH BEAT: BUDGET PRICES IN JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON, Izon is a Canadian travel journalist covering youth budget 
routes. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's not always the inexpensive countries that attract the attention of budget 
travelers. Interest in Japan is high, despite its very high prices. If it costs 
at least $30 U.S. a day to survive in Europe, count on double that for Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the best values are Japan Rail Passes and Tokyo Youth Hostel 
Accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
Passes must be bought before arrival in Japan through Japan Air Lines or a 
travel agent. You don't get the pass until you arrive in Japan, where you are 
given a voucher that can be exchanged at the Japan Railways ticket counter in 
the airport when you arrive. 
</P>
<P>
The tickets are valid for unlimited rail travel, and are available for 
first-class and economy. A seven-day economy pass costs 27,000 yen (about $214 
U.S.), a 14-day ticket 43,000 yen ($340) and a 30-day ticket 55,000 yen ($435). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
View of the City 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo's Ichigaya Youth Hostel is on the 18th and 19th floors of an office 
building near the Shinjuku area of the city. 
</P>
<P>
It offers lodging in four-bed rooms, a terrace with a good view of the city, a 
helpful English-speaking staff and traditional Japanese-style black granite 
men's and women's baths. The price for bed, breakfast and dinner totals 3,690 
yen ($29). There's a 10:30 p.m. curfew. 
</P>
<P>
The hostel is at 1-6 Gobancho, Chyoda-ku, Tokyo 102. That's about a one-minute 
walk from the Ichigaya subway station. 
</P>
<P>
There are stories of extremely high wages paid to foreigners for teaching 
English in Japan. But the wages are set high to match the cost of living. 
</P>
<P>
If you are considering a trip to Japan, talk to as many people as you can who 
have firsthand knowledge of the teaching opportunities and living expenses 
there. You can probably find people with this experience through educational 
institutions and language-teaching companies. 
</P>
<P>
One source for background information is the third edition of the handbook 
"Jobs In Japan," by John Wharton, published by Global Press. It deals primarily 
with information for young travelers who hope to arrange temporary jobs 
teaching English and includes information on visas and a listing of 223 schools 
that hire foreign teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"Jobs In Japan" can be ordered for $13.95 (postpaid) from Global Press, 1510 
York St., No. 204, Denver, Colo. 80206. 
</P>
<P>
Want to be sure that you'll travel with others who are close to your own age? A 
variety of companies cater to travelers in a specific age group. 
</P>
<P>
STI, which designs programs for travelers from 18 to 30 years, is introducing a 
new Mayan Adventure tour this year. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-day adventure concentrates on sites of ancient Indian cultures. It 
begins in Mexico City and ends in Acapulco. 
</P>
<P>
The land price of $1,394 covers transportation, breakfasts, some lunches and 
dinners, accommodations in first-class and superior tourist-class hotels 
(except for camping on a river expedition segment), sightseeing with local 
guides and the services of a multilingual tour director. Departures are May 28, 
June 25 and July 16. 
</P>
<P>
STI also offers programs for this age group in China, Europe and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
More information and a 52-page brochure are available from STI, 8619 Reseda

THE MISSION THAT GAVE HIM SHELTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rev. Wayne Teuerle had worked in the rescue missions of downtown Los 
Angeles. He knew their image: smelly places with ragged furniture, gray 
linoleum and pale green walls. 
</P>
<P>
He wanted his Long Beach Rescue Mission to look more like a well-maintained 
apartment building than a homeless shelter. 
</P>
<P>
The result of that ambition is readily apparent at the earth-toned, two-story 
mission buildings on either side of Pacific Avenue, north of Anaheim Street. 
</P>
<P>
Both the two-story Samaritan House, a men's 100-bed facility with a chapel and 
dining hall, and Lydia House, a 33-bed temporary home for women and children, 
were built specifically as mission buildings. Teuerle said that allowed him to 
incorporate many of his ideas. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things we wanted to do was change the image," said Teuerle, who 
started the mission in 1972 with his wife, Janet. "You don't have to have a 
mission that looks like a mission." 
</P>
<P>
In the men's building, for instance, the walls are painted cheery shades of 
orange and baby blue. The bathrooms, dining areas and bedrooms appear as 
spotless as rooms in a well-maintained private house. The furniture is new. And 
the rooms are pleasant and airy, lacking the rank odor of disinfectant found in 
some downtown Los Angeles missions. 
</P>
<P>
The women's facility has private showers and a plush living-room-style lounge. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Teuerle said he helped design both the men's and women's quarters. "I got 
a little creative and I wanted to build something and decorate it," the 
49-year-old evangelical Christian minister said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike some of the missions in Los Angeles, the Long Beach facility was laid 
out so that the homeless and hungry would not have to loiter on the sidewalk to 
await the nightly meal and church service. Instead of waiting outside, the 
crowd comes inside to a large outdoor atrium or a waiting room lined with 
chairs. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach mission has been so successful that the Teuerles want to expand. 
They plan to raise about $500,000 for an addition that will include about 20 
new beds, more office space and two staff apartments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Began on Broadway 
</P>
<P>
Teuerle, a finance manager before becoming a minister, started the mission in 
an old building on Broadway in downtown Long Beach. He said they served 27 
meals the first day and 16 homeless people attended the church service and 
stayed the night. 
</P>
<P>
After a few years of seven-day weeks, the Teuerles built their new mission for 
men and the chapel in 1983. It was followed two years later by the women's 
facility. Wayne Teuerle said no one in need of a bed is ever turned away at the 
mission. On average, 68% of the beds are filled annually; the high was 82% one 
month. Nevertheless, he said the mission needs to expand to keep pace with its 
projected growth. The new beds and offices are needed "as a hedge for the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
Teuerle said the $440,000-a-year operation employs 14 paid staff members. It is 
self-supporting, depending entirely on contributions from individuals and 85 
churches. 
</P>
<P>
Although the mission served 107,000 meals last year, Teuerle said that total 
food costs ran about $400 -- mostly for spices. Virtually all of the food 
consumed at the mission is donated.

HIGH-TECH TEACHERS GET FELLOWSHIPS FOR USE OF COMPUTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Staring intently at the small computer screen, Adrian Monarrez, 16, put the 
finishing touches on the curved tail of a hideous-looking basilisk, a mythical 
monster that is hatched from an egg and turns people to stone with its icy 
stare. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some irregularities," the Bell High School junior said as he slowly 
rolled the computer's "mouse" remote device on the table, selected a mode on 
the computer's menu and began painting the basilisk's tail, dot by dot, until 
it curved evenly. 
</P>
<P>
A key stroke later, the snarling, salivating monster was "saved" on Monarrez's 
floppy disk, to be printed out later. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to use it as a logo on the top of . . . Dungeons and Dragons (game) 
instructions that we (he and his friends) are going to use," he said. "We're 
going to conquer an imaginary land. It's one way to get away from the real 
world." 
</P>
<P>
Monarrez, an aspiring mechanical engineer, is one of about 320 Bell High School 
students who each day pass through a photo laboratory/computer room designed 
and run by teachers Michael Goldberg and Bonnie Weddle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Honored by Foundation 
</P>
<P>
The teachers are one of two instructor teams in California -- both in the 
Southeast -- who were named Christa McAuliffe fellows two weeks ago by the 
Washington-based National Foundation for the Improvement of Education. 
</P>
<P>
The two other instructors teach elementary school in the Whittier City School 
District. Fifth-grade bilingual teacher Pam Kinnaman and sixth-grade 
multilingual teacher Bonnie L. Price will join Weddle and Goldberg at a 
three-day conference at Stanford University in July. 
</P>
<P>
The four were chosen to attend the conference from among 245 applicants across 
the country. The foundation picked 19 teacher teams from California, Michigan, 
Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to attend the conference, where they will 
gather to share the latest in teaching techniques. 
</P>
<P>
The Bell High School teachers were awarded the McAuliffe fellowship after 
describing in a long application how they developed a computer curriculum that 
melds high technology, artistic creativity and work experience into a classroom 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
In the Electronic Publishing and Instruction Center, Goldberg and Weddle have 
overcome the problems of teaching in overcrowded conditions by developing a 
self-paced, desktop publishing class. 
</P>
<P>
Students enrolled in the computer publishing and graphic design class use 20 
computers, which were provided last year by the Los Angeles Unified School 
District's adult and vocational education department, Weddle said. Students 
learn electronically to draw and perform word processing and other graphic 
design functions. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids really learn to express themselves creatively," said Weddle about 
the computer production class that she designed two years ago with her partner. 
</P>
<P>
The computer production class publishes a class newsletter as well as the 
BellTone, a monthly mailer sent to parents. 
</P>
<P>
The class has also designed forms, flyers and award certificates for the high 
school, drawn playbills for the drama class and created a menu for a local 
Mexican restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"They can do anything here," Goldberg said about her students. "Their 
imagination is the limit." 
</P>
<P>
Using computers as a teaching tool also earned honors for Whittier teachers 
Price and Kinnaman. Their winning proposal calls for a network in which 
children from across the country can communicate with each other with 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers have been experimenting with their proposal through a computer 
network for educators operated by the McGraw-Hill Co. During the last election 
season, Price's sixth-grade class at Wallen L. Andrews Elementary School was 
one of nine in the country that used the McGraw-Hill network to ask questions 
of presidential candidates George Bush and Michael S. Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Messages to Other States 
</P>
<P>
The children also exchanged computer messages with classrooms in other states, 
which Kinnaman said provided a real-life lesson in cultural diversity. 
</P>
<P>
"We've found that students in Nebraska have no concept of going to the mall or 
skateboarding, but we have no concept of getting the sleds out and going 
snow-sledding," said Kinnaman, who teaches a fifth-grade bilingual class at 
Orange Grove Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
"Children in the U.S. only see the culture they have around them," she said. 
"We want to broaden that." 
</P>
<P>
However, because it costs $150 a year, plus user fees of $7 an hour, to become 
a member of the McGraw-Hill network, the system has only about 3,900 U.S. 
members. 
</P>
<P>
McGraw-Hill Price and Kinnaman want to set up a free system, starting it in 
California and eventually including the entire United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Any teacher, any parent, any student will be able to connect into the system, 
as long as they have a computer and a modem," Kinnaman said. 
</P>
<P>
Price and Kinnaman will also be videotaping their students as they send and 
receive messages, "so children who don't have the opportunity to get on line 
can see how to do it," Kinnaman said. 
</P>
<P>
At Bell High School, students are getting more than an idea of what computers 
can do. They are getting hands-on, marketable experience, Goldberg and Weddle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Already, some students have been working part time in local print shops and 
graphic design businesses. Two seniors have landed full-time, after-school jobs 
designing ads with computers for a local weekly newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eye-Opener for Artist 
</P>
<P>
Marco Aguilera, 17, an artist who began drawing at 3, said he shunned high 
technology until he discovered the computer design class. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I wasn't too crazy about this thing," Aguilera said as he looked over 
the shoulder of a friend who was typesetting a newsletter, forming columns and 
outlining "windows" where photographs would be placed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an artist," Aguilera continued. "But when I saw what this thing could do, 
I decided I'm going to get into computer graphics." 
</P>
<P>
He is now looking for a college that will teach him the most advanced computer 
graphics technology: "I want to do animation stuff with the computers. That 
would be great."

<P>
FOR A FALLEN TRACK STAR, THE MOST OLYMPIAN STRUGGLE IS AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Alphonce Swai has known the best of times. He won a berth on the Tanzanian 
track team in a barefoot sprint as an unknown of 17. At 19, he lived for more 
than a year with Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young and his family. He competed in the 
1984 Olympics at 21. He became the cross-country star of Santa Monica College. 
</P>
<P>
And he has known the worst of times: His marriage dissolved and his track 
career evaporated into a stupor of alcoholism and drug peddling. 
</P>
<P>
In desperation, he sought help from the Long Beach Rescue Mission. At first, 
Swai, now 26, planned to stay just a few days. Instead, he entered the 
mission's program for recovering alcoholics and drug addicts. 
</P>
<P>
Ten months later, Swai has lost his drinker's paunch and regained his lean, 
athletic look. He has become a devout Christian. His bright brown eyes sparkle. 
He is cheerful and polite. 
</P>
<P>
Swai started running again this month. He puts in three hours of roadwork a day 
in morning and evening sessions. Most days, he racks up 18 to 20 miles. Swai's 
goal is to return to competition and earn enough prize money as a distance 
runner to buy a plane ticket home to Tanzania. And then, he said, he hopes to 
rejoin the Tanzanian team for the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels good to be back running," he said, adding that now "I'm not just 
running by myself. . . . Spiritually, I'm depending on somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Swai's father hails from the Chagga tribe and wanted his sons to stay on the 
family's 200-acre coffee plantation at the base of Mt. Kilimanjaro. His mother 
is a Mbulu, a tribe that believes in a formal education. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to school because I chose it," he said. "That's why I had trouble with 
my father. He wanted me to stay home and pick coffee (beans). My mom wanted me 
to go to school." 
</P>
<P>
The school was 10 miles away. Instead of walking, Swai ran. 
</P>
<P>
Swai graduated from high school and was working as a supervisor at a shoe 
factory when he entered a regional track meet in the capital of Dar es Salaam. 
</P>
<P>
"I just showed up from the middle of nowhere," he said. "I didn't know which 
event to enter. I just jumped in." 
</P>
<P>
The young tribesman chose the 1,500 meters. He ran barefoot, dressed in cut-off 
trousers, against a field that included two members of the Tanzanian national 
team, with their fancy running shoes and colorful jerseys. Swai won the heat, 
beating his country's best with a time of 3 minutes, 48 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian team's coach was impressed. "He said, 'Great race. What's your 
name?' " Swai recalled. "He knew a little Swahili, so I talked to him." 
</P>
<P>
Swai said he dreamed of going to college, but it was difficult coming from a 
modest family that lacked official connections. The national team offered a 
chance to travel to countries such as Mozambique and Zimbabwe. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started going out of the country, I thought I wanted to be a 
businessman, open a shop in my own country and help little kids to start 
running," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Caught Scout's Eye 
</P>
<P>
Swai attracted the attention of a U.S. college scout at the All-African Games 
in Nigeria. He left Africa in 1981 for the University of Oklahoma, but soon 
after his arrival, he said, the track coach departed amid a recruiting scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Swai said he and the other African athletes were told by a university official 
that they were considered visitors, rather than students. The athletes replied 
that they had come to enroll. Swai said they were given English competency 
tests, which none of the Africans could pass. 
</P>
<P>
"I contacted my embassy in Washington," he said. "The embassy knew me from my 
running. I told (an embassy official), 'Things aren't going well in this 
country. I want to go home.' " 
</P>
<P>
Rather than send Swai home, the official arranged for him to visit Mayor Young, 
who has invited foreign students to live with his family since his days as 
chief U.S. delegate to the United Nations under President Carter. 
</P>
<P>
Swai stayed with the Young family for almost two years. Young, he said, "helped 
me take some English classes at Georgia Tech. He said, 'If you want to go to a 
university, you have to improve your English a little bit.' " 
</P>
<P>
Young said by telephone that he admires Swai's tenacity. 
</P>
<P>
"I was impressed, because when he was living with us, he would get up and run 
10 miles or more before going to school," Young said. "And he would work out in 
the afternoon, as well. It was something about his character of being a 
long-distance runner." 
</P>
<P>
Swai left for Brevard Junior College in North Carolina, where he won the state 
community college cross-country championship in 1983, running five miles in 
less than 25 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
120 Miles a Week 
</P>
<P>
He dropped out to return to Tanzania to train for the 1984 Olympics in Los 
Angeles. In the shadow of Kilimanjaro, he ran 120 miles a week. 
</P>
<P>
Swai was disappointed with his performance at the Olympics, winning two heats 
but failing to advance beyond the semifinal. He said he squabbled with his 
coaches who, he said, had so overtrained the athletes that their muscles still 
ached when they stepped into the starting blocks for Olympic events. 
</P>
<P>
The Olympic semifinal heat "was the worst race of my life." he said of 
</P>
<P>
After a brief return to Atlanta, Swai came back to California, because the 
climate is akin to Tanzania's and because he considered it a better place to 
train. At 23, he became Santa Monica College's star distance runner. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica coach Tommie Smith, the record-setting sprinter of the 1960s, said 
in 1985 that he had high hopes for Swai at the state junior college 
cross-country meet in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd better win it all," Smith kidded. "He has no choice. I'm not going to 
Fresno for him to take second." 
</P>
<P>
True to Smith's expectations, Swai set a course record at the meet in November, 
1985: four miles in 19 minutes, 11 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Although successful on the track, Swai encountered increasing personal turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
"When I moved to California, my life started changing," he said. At first, he 
drank a few friendly beers with friends. Then he said he started packing his 
own refrigerator with beer, downing a six-pack a day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Corruptive Life' 
</P>
<P>
"It's the loneliness," he said. "In California, I have all these African 
friends, and they all drink. . . . (It's a) very corruptive life." 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the marriage. In 1987, Swai married a woman he had met at 
Georgia Tech. But he said he did not know her well enough; resulting 
difficulties only made matters worse. 
</P>
<P>
The heavy drinking made it hard for Swai to get up in the mornings. "You start 
hating life," he said. "You hate yourself when you get up and can't run. It 
caused great frustration." 
</P>
<P>
His track career fell apart. He lost a contract to wear a shoe manufacturer's 
products. 
</P>
<P>
Swai started dealing drugs, left his wife and lived with friends. 
</P>
<P>
One day he made a decision. He had to leave and start over. He had to seek 
treatment for his alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not what I came to this country for," he recalled thinking. He had hit 
bottom. 
</P>
<P>
He called Mayor Young for help, who contacted an aide to Los Angeles Mayor Tom 
Bradley. The aide told Swai about the Long Beach Rescue Mission. 
</P>
<P>
The mission, operated by the Rev. Wayne Teuerle and his wife, Janet, offers 
free meals, shelter and guidance to troubled or homeless individuals. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came here, I was still smelling of alcohol from the night before," said 
Swai, who enrolled in the mission's long-term New Life program. 
</P>
<P>
Although Swai intended to stay only briefly, mission counselors told him there 
was a solution, but that it required discipline, patience and faith. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Starting Anew 
</P>
<P>
"I drink too much and I want to continue my running, but I need to start my 
life again," Swai told his mission chaplain, the Rev. Jerome Hannaman. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'You need to get off your drinking and let God take care of your 
problem.' " 
</P>
<P>
Swai said it took three months before he could admit that he is an alcoholic. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he said, he has close fellowship with the dozen other men in his program. 
They depend on one another and pray together. 
</P>
<P>
He gets up at 6 a.m. and works several hours a day at the front desk, where he 
is in contact with other alcoholics in need of help. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't go out that much," he said. "Here, you're not just working for the 
mission. You're working for the Lord and on how to change your life." 
</P>
<P>
Swai said he does not consider himself too old to get back into athletic 
competition. Distance runners hit their peak from age 28 to 30, he said, which 
for Swai is still a couple years away. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to qualify for the Olympics for my country in 1992," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hannaman said Swai is a sharp young man but is not viewed as different from the 
many others who walk through the doors of the mission, despite his colorful 
background. 
</P>
<P>
"Our people are just people. Alphonce is just like anyone else," he said.

<P>
By a vote of 209 for and 216 against, the House rejected an amendment to freeze 
spending for the National Endowment for Democracy, blocking a proposed 58% 
budget hike. This left intact legislation to raise the endowment's 
$15.8-million budget to $25 million next year. The vote occurred as the House 
sent to the Senate a bill authorizing $4.9 billion for the State Department in 
fiscal 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The endowment sends federal appropriations to the Republican and Democratic 
parties, the AFL-CIO and the Chamber of Commerce, which use the money primarily 
to promote democratic reform around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to block a 58% spending increase for the National 
Endowment for Democracy.

FUNDING CURB

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By a vote of 209 for and 216 against, the House rejected an amendment to freeze 
spending for the National Endowment for Democracy, blocking a proposed 58% 
budget hike. This left intact legislation to raise the endowment's 
$15.8-million budget to $25 million next year. The vote occurred as the House 
sent to the Senate a bill authorizing $4.9 billion for the State Department in 
fiscal 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The endowment sends federal appropriations to the Republican and Democratic 
parties, the AFL-CIO and the Chamber of Commerce, which use the money primarily 
to promote democratic reform around the world. 
</P>
<P>
John Conyers (D-Mich.) said the endowment "has become a pseudo entity of the 
U.S. government . . . often embarrassing our government." 
</P>
<P>
Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) who opposed the amendment, said "anything that advances the 
cause of democracy in places that are inhospitable to democracy . . . is money 
well spent." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to block a 58% spending increase for the National 
Endowment for Democracy.

VINYL'S LAST STAND;

<P>
AT 'ALTERNATIVE' RECORD STORES, LPS' DAYS OF EXTENDED PLAY ARE SAFE FROM TIME 
AND TECHNOLOGY

The announcement came last month: 14 Music Plus stores in Southern California 
were pulling the records from their racks. A number of Wherehouse record stores 
revealed that they planned to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
Vinyl LPs simply aren't selling enough, they said. Records are wasting space 
that could be stocked with more popular cassette tapes and compact discs. The 
public, they said, has spoken. 
</P>
<P>
"The consumer, in a general way, has told us that he or she is interested in 
having their audio experience either on cassette or CD format," a Music Plus 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
But such words amount to blasphemy in certain circles. Dozens of small record 
shops across the city are refusing to submit to technological progress, digging 
themselves in as the last bastion of the LP. 
</P>
<P>
These places tend to be out-of-the-way storefronts where the guy behind the 
counter is the owner. There usually isn't much neon light or interior 
decoration, just wooden bins filled with used and hard-to-find records. An old 
Connie Francis album might cost a dime and a rare Elvis Presley single might 
fetch $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
Vinyl ranks as gold in these quarters. Some of the shops don't even sell 
cassettes or CDs. 
</P>
<P>
Such "alternative" record stores have spent years eking out a living. Now, with 
the imminent decline of the LP, they are hoping for a windfall. 
</P>
<P>
"People are going into chain stores looking for records and can't find them," 
said Ronn Jackson of Penny Lane in Venice. "Panic is being spread." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good time to be in this business," said Kip Brown, who recently opened 
Ear Candy in Van Nuys. "People come in here and say, 'Thank God you still sell 
records.' " 
</P>
<P>
It may be too early for record stores to count their profits, industry 
observers say. The Recording Industry Assn. of America reports that LPs 
represented only 15% of all 1987 music sales. At Music Plus' 59 stores, vinyl 
accounts for 4% of sales. 
</P>
<P>
Yet no one is ready to dismiss LPs outright, and hopes for big business among 
small shops are not unrealistic, said a National Assn. of Recording 
Merchandisers official. If nothing else, records should continue to sell for 
economic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"The CDs cost $15. It's too expensive," said Len Kundstadt, publisher of Record 
Research Magazine, a bimonthly New York publication. "Kids can go out and buy 
two or three LPs for the price of one CD." 
</P>
<P>
In the bargain bins at alternative shops -- where records go for 49 cents to $2 
-- they can buy even more music for the dollar. Or, at a place like Ear Candy, 
they can spend $15 on a rare Partridge Family album. 
</P>
<P>
"People laugh when the see that stuff," Brown said. "But the Partridge Family 
sells well." 
</P>
<P>
Ear Candy, like most alternative shops, specializes in pop and rock. It is a 
bright, airy room where the stereo plays loud and house plants sit atop the 
record bins. The store's more eccentric albums are displayed along the walls 
with accompanying notes of interest: 
</P>
<P>
"The Best of Michael Jackson" has a $100 price tag because of some scribbles 
across the jacket. "Autographed (pre nose-change)," the note says. "Try getting 
his autograph now." 
</P>
<P>
Billy Joel's "Cold Spring Harbor" sells for $30. The note reads: "Billy says 
about this album, 'Slow down your turntable because when I went from tape to 
acetate the machine that does that was screwed up, so it came out a quarter 
note higher than I recorded it.' And he's right, y'know. Sounds funny." 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Gordon's "Hog Fat," priced at $15, comes with this explanation: "This guy 
was in Derek &amp; the Dominos. He's now in jail for murdering his mom! Looks 
like the type, doesn't he?" 
</P>
<P>
Across town at the Record Collector in Hollywood, the atmosphere is musty and 
quiet -- no music playing. Fourteen-foot-tall bookcases line the walls in 
several rooms. Classical, opera, jazz and sound tracks are stored with only the 
spine of the record showing. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Sandy Chase says his shop "is like an old, rare bookstore where the owner 
knows every line ever written." 
</P>
<P>
"When you need to find a needle in the haystack," he said, "we can find that 
needle." 
</P>
<P>
The shop, like others of its kind, survives on a cadre of loyal customers. Only 
a few of Los Angeles' alternative record shops -- Rhino Records in Westwood, 
Aron's in Hollywood, Moby Disc in Sherman Oaks and Canoga Park -- are as 
well-known as the chain stores. 
</P>
<P>
The rest rely on word-of-mouth advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have the good music, they find out about you," said Dan Alvino, who has 
owned Music &amp; Memories in Sherman Oaks for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Located in a strip mall above a 7-Eleven, Music &amp; Memories specializes in 
sound tracks and bygone crooners. On a recent day, a teen-ager walked in, took 
one look at the place -- Sinatra movie posters on the walls, pictures of 
Marilyn and Bogart as well -- and left. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't get many kids in here," Alvino said. "I don't carry Bruce 
Springsteen." 
</P>
<P>
But he does offer a full complement of Steve and Eydie, "tons of" Judy Garland 
and a Sinatra section packed with 300 different albums. 
</P>
<P>
"I had Mel Torme come into the store. He looked under his own section and said, 
'You've got more of my records than I have,' " Alvino said. "He bought a 
couple." 
</P>
<P>
Alvino tests each record he buys, and he won't sell albums that are heavily 
worn or scratched. Some alternative stores will, usually in the bargain bins. 
Most let the customer listen to the record in the shop before buying it. 
</P>
<P>
Maintaining an inventory of exotic, or simply old, albums isn't easy. The work 
is best suited for avid music enthusiasts. Shop owners scour garage sales, swap 
meets, thrift shops and record conventions in search of merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be constantly on the go, trying to beat the other guy to records," 
said Ernie Leal, who owns Sweet &amp; Lowe Music in North Hollywood. "You 
always see people from other shops and you always say, 'Oh shoot, he beat me to 
it.' " 
</P>
<P>
During the 1967 Detroit riots, Bob Plotnik and a friend bought armfuls of rare 
jazz records that he feared would be lost in the fires and looting. 
</P>
<P>
"There we were, two white guys running around the neighborhood trying to save 
the records," said Plotnik, who recently opened a Melrose Avenue version of his 
Greenwich Village-based Bleecker Bob's Golden Oldies Record Shop. "When people 
asked us what we were doing, we told them, 'We're trying to save the sounds.' " 
</P>
<P>
The business is replete with such stories, and tales of fantastic finds. Alvino 
found a single of Frank Sinatra singing "High Hopes" with special lyrics 
written for John F. Kennedy's inauguration. He paid $1 for the record and sold 
it for $300. Brown, at Ear Candy, bought a 1963 RCA sampler for 25 cents and, 
upon returning to his shop, discovered that it included a rare Elvis Presley 
cut that was worth $800. 
</P>
<P>
"When you come across stuff like that," Brown said, "it makes it all 
worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
Shopping at alternative record stores can be just as arduous, or at least more 
difficult than dropping by a Sam Goody outlet to pick up Tiffany's latest. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I'll spend a couple hours looking to find what I want," said John 
Hydo, 22, a record collector who was browsing through Ear Candy. "It's kind of 
like a treasure hunt. I was at a store the other day and picked up the Beatles' 
first album on the original label for only 94 cents." 
</P>
<P>
The shop owner who sold that Beatles album must not have known that it was 
worth more, Hydo said. Such is the lure of alternative stores -- the promise of 
a bargain. Short of that, shoppers know they can find a wide selection. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I've ever come in here without buying something," said John 
Rowan of Huntington Beach, who is a regular at the Record Collector in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
And the other day at Music &amp; Memories, Alvino pointed to a customer named 
Chuck who was browsing through the bins. 
</P>
<P>
"He collects Sinatra . . . everything," Alvino said. "If Sinatra hums, he wants 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Chuck looked up and smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely."

SCIENTISTS GROW FRUSTRATED OVER FUSION CLAIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists at major research institutions throughout the country are growing 
increasingly frustrated over their inability to replicate a supposedly simple 
experiment that purportedly achieves nuclear fusion at room temperature. 
</P>
<P>
Although there have been scattered confirmations of parts of the experiment 
announced a month ago at the University of Utah, no U.S. laboratory has been 
able to verify the entire experiment. Not even one of the major research 
laboratories best equipped to repeat the experiment has succeeded. That 
includes national laboratories at Los Alamos, Brookhaven and Livermore that are 
in the forefront of energy research. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doubts Remain 
</P>
<P>
That track record is why many of the nation's top scientists remain doubtful 
that B. Stanley Pons of the University of Utah and Martin Fleischmann of the 
University of Southampton, England, really did achieve fusion in a flask, as 
they claimed on March 23. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, no matter which way it turns out, this scientific mystery will 
go down as one of the most unusual chapters in the history of science. 
</P>
<P>
Either Pons and Fleischmann, both of whom have solid reputations in the field 
of electrochemistry, have committed a blunder of extraordinary proportions, or 
the best and the brightest minds in energy research have been befuddled by an 
experiment that looks so simple it would not be a serious challenge for a 
freshman chemistry student. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, a team at Stanford University announced that it has detected excess 
heat that cannot be caused by a chemical reaction, and therefore is most likely 
nuclear in nature, and another team at the University of Florida has detected 
significant amounts of tritium, a hydrogen isotope that is produced in fusion 
reactions. 
</P>
<P>
But those claims of success only add to the frustration of other scientists who 
have been skunked in the race to repeat the experiment. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is that more apparent than at Caltech, where a multifaceted team of 
experts has labored in vain to come up with something that would either prove 
or disprove the Utah claim. Last Friday afternoon, a seminar on "cold fusion" 
had to be moved from a classroom to the campus' largest auditorium to 
accommodate a crowd of several hundred. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those who showed up rushed to the front rows of the auditorium, 
expecting to see a demonstration of the fusion experiment, but electrochemist 
Nathan Lewis shattered that dream in an instant. 
</P>
<P>
"Our results," he said as he faced the packed auditorium rather sheepishly, 
"are zero." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Continue Efforts 
</P>
<P>
Scientists there will continue their efforts, however. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the work at Caltech, which were disclosed at the seminar, are 
embargoed until the scientists publish reports in professional journals, but 
the human drama revealed at the session may be of greater interest anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers at Caltech began working on the problem within hours of the Salt 
Lake City press conference, and "we've been working pretty much around the 
clock ever since," Lewis told the seminar. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of experiments have been completed as the scientists there tried to 
guess exactly how the Utah group had set up the experiment. From the beginning, 
researchers have been hampered by a lack of details, a shortfall that grows 
more puzzling as time goes on. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the experiment) could easily be defined, but it hasn't," Lewis said. 
"We're frustrated about that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shows Exasperation 
</P>
<P>
At one point, he asked in exasperation why Pons has not taken one of his 
experiments to one of the major national laboratories and asked scientists 
there to test it with their sophisticated equipment. Why not, he asked, when 
"everybody knows they were first now." 
</P>
<P>
Pons could not be reached because even though he has used the media to stake 
his claim, he now declines interviews. 
</P>
<P>
While Pons has not taken one of his experiments to a major lab, his partner 
has. Fleischmann is a consultant to England's Harwell Laboratory, operated by 
that country's Atomic Energy Authority, and he has taken some of his own 
experiments there for further testing. However, Harwell officials have declined 
all comment until their research is completed, which could take at least 
another month. 
</P>
<P>
These days, as scientists who have grown weary from long nights in the 
laboratory try to explain their inability to replicate the experiment, touches 
of bitterness often surface. During the Caltech seminar, speakers were 
frequently interrupted by applause and cheers when they suggested repeatedly 
that Pons and Fleischmann were so eager to claim credit for their work that 
they made their announcement prematurely and that their work was seriously 
flawed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Answering Questions 
</P>
<P>
Much of the criticism stems from the fact that Utah researchers have still not 
answered some of the basic questions other scientists have been asking about 
the experiment. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone at the Caltech seminar was ready to write off Pons and 
Fleischmann, however. 
</P>
<P>
"What they are saying," one colleague muttered to another as they left the 
auditorium, "is if you guys are so smart, figure it out for yourselves." 
</P>
<P>
If other claims from reputable institutions are to be believed, some people 
have done just that. 
</P>
<P>
The most difficult research for the doubters to dismiss at this point comes 
from Stanford University. A seven-member team, led by materials science 
professor Robert A. Huggins, announced last Tuesday that a series of carefully 
controlled experiments there had confirmed that the Utah experiment does 
produce excess energy in the form of heat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Use 'Heavy Water' 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, only experiments that used "heavy water" that has the isotopes 
necessary for fusion produced the heat. Control experiments that used ordinary 
water produced no energy, thus ruling out the chance that the heat was caused 
by some form of chemical reaction. 
</P>
<P>
When Lewis was asked about the Stanford results in the Caltech seminar, he 
shrugged and said "he (Huggins) is a good guy." 
</P>
<P>
But he said he did not know enough about the Stanford work to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
The differences between Stanford and Caltech suggest that there is some little 
secret about the experiment that Stanford researchers have figured out. 
Otherwise, Stanford will join a list of institutions that have announced 
success and then had to back off. Both Texas A&amp;M and the Georgia Institute 
of Technology have had to bury their pride and admit that earlier claims of 
success were in error because of problems with equipment. 
</P>
<P>
That backpedaling illustrates one of the other frustrations of the project: 
While the experiment itself looks easy, detecting the results is extremely 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Devilish Bit of Irony 
</P>
<P>
And in that there is a devilish bit of irony. 
</P>
<P>
The laws of physics, as now understood, suggest that Pons and Fleischmann 
"would not have been around to hold their press conference" if they had 
achieved the level of nuclear fusion that they claimed, said Caltech physicist 
Charles Barnes. The experiment should have become so radioactive that it would 
have been lethal to anyone within about a mile unless properly shielded. 
</P>
<P>
However, the experiment produces so little radioactivity that it is not even 
necessary to shield it, and thus is very difficult to measure, according to the 
Utah scientists. 
</P>
<P>
And that, to physicists, is the biggest mystery of all. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists are still searching for a credible explanation of why the experiment 
suppresses the radioactivity that should be the "signature" of a fusion 
reaction. 
</P>
<P>
Pons and others have theorized that the energy produced by the reaction is 
absorbed in the apparatus and released as heat instead of high energy neutrons 
or gamma rays, but other scientists find that explanation difficult to accept. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Curious Event 
</P>
<P>
Another scientist at MIT came up with a theory similar to Pons', leading to one 
of the most curious events in the entire drama. 
</P>
<P>
Top scientists at MIT had announced a couple of weeks ago that they were 
abandoning their effort to replicate the experiment because they had been 
unable to validate any of the Utah claims. But when a colleague announced that 
he could explain how the experiment works, MIT did a back-flip and announced 
that it was going to patent the theory for a process that other MIT scientists 
had concluded doesn't even work. 
</P>
<P>
And so it has gone, week after week. 
</P>
<P>
It may be months before all the answers are known, although Pons is now working 
with a team of about 60 people at Los Alamos National Laboratory, offering some 
promise of an early resolution. Los Alamos, like just about everybody else, has 
been unsuccessful in its efforts to replicate the experiment on its own. 
</P>
<P>
But the scientist who is leading that team said the lack of success has not 
diminished the interest in the Pons-Fleischmann experiment. 
</P>
<P>
When Pons spoke there recently, about 700 people showed up to hear what he had 
to say. He told them they had been doing the experiments wrong and he will work 
with them in the days ahead.

SCHOOL CAFETERIAS FLUNK NUTRITION TEST, CRITICS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The apple sauce had been exonerated, and inside the Los Angeles Unified School 
District's food factory, the assembly lines were whipping out 160 lunch trays 
per minute, 85,000 meals per day. 
</P>
<P>
Dispensers squirted a rich red goo of strawberries and apple sauce into the 
appropriate tray compartments. Workers wearing hair nets placed green salad and 
chalupas in other sections. Chalupas, taco shell boats filled with spiced 
ground beef and piled with cheese, are preferred because tacos don't travel 
well in those little trays. 
</P>
<P>
"Food technology," a school nutritionist explained. 
</P>
<P>
All that cheese, so rich in fat and salt, is one reason some health authorities 
say school cafeterias deserve a D-minus for nutrition. School meals, critics 
complain, are being corrupted by special-interest politics and fast-food 
tastes. 
</P>
<P>
School nutritionists say it's a bum rap -- and, no, ketchup is not a vegetable. 
But, indeed, long before the Alar pesticide scare last month prompted many 
school districts to stop serving apple products -- a ban lifted after extensive 
testing -- debate has raged over school menus laden with items such as pizza, 
hot dogs, cheeseburgers and "pork choppettes." At most schools, students can 
wash this stuff down with chocolate milk. 
</P>
<P>
The story of school lunch is a saga of the American heartland and the American 
schoolyard, of America's diet and America's health, of the American Heart Assn. 
and processed American cheese. 
</P>
<P>
A 1987 federal report showed that the sedentary youngsters of today generally 
have more weight problems than previous generations. Another study found that 
25% of schoolchildren tested had unhealthy cholesterol counts. Are television 
and video games the only culprits? 
</P>
<P>
"Our diet is so rich in fats, half of us are going to die from it," said Dr. 
William Castelli, a Massachusetts heart researcher who maintains that the 
typical school lunch is more suitable for dogs than children. "We need to bring 
children into this campaign against cholesterol. When are we going to start? 
Shouldn't we help them develop good habits as children?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Politics Stirred In 
</P>
<P>
Critics complain that school meals are prepped more by Washington politics and 
economic policies than by nutritional concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to take care of a few thousand dairymen, they're loading up millions 
of little bodies with unnecessary fat," said Carol Tucker Foreman, an assistant 
agriculture secretary in the Carter Administration and now a Washington 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
But school nutritionists strongly defend the meals they serve. The school lunch 
is nutritionally superior to the typical sack lunch prepared by parents, the 
nutritionists say. That was the conclusion of a 1983 study sponsored by the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture, which provides a cash reimbursement to most 
American schools, as well as about 25% of their foodstuffs in the form of 
surplus flour, cheese, grains, meat, fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
This massive food distribution program reaches more than 24.2 million students. 
The smaller school breakfast program, targeted to low-income neighborhoods, 
serves 3.7 million students. 
</P>
<P>
For some schoolchildren, the question is not one of a high-fiber, low-fat diet, 
but of food itself. Some players in the food debate believe the federal 
government should do more to expand food programs in poor neighborhoods, where 
they can be the primary source of nutrition, according to Lynn Parker of the 
Food Research and Action Center in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quality Praised 
</P>
<P>
The quality of government surplus foods, such as ground beef that would qualify 
as lean at a supermarket, is "excellent," said Maria Balakshin, nutrition 
director for the California Department of Education. These foods are often 
funneled to processors who make prefab items such as pizza and burritos to 
school specifications. 
</P>
<P>
Think of the job of cafeteria managers as mass parenting. Like parents, they 
can't just shove tuna, fresh vegetables and nonfat milk down the kids' throats. 
So they try to serve meals that, first, will be eaten and, second, will be 
nutritious. 
</P>
<P>
Shyrl Dougherty, food service director of the Montebello Unified School 
District and immediate past president of the California Food Service Assn., 
said nutritionists have worked in recent years to reduce the fat, salt and 
sugar in their meals, while increasing fiber. 
</P>
<P>
In many California schools, french fries now are baked instead of deep-fried, 
lowering the fat content. Hot dogs made of turkey are often served for the same 
reason. Some districts use computers to monitor fat content in their meals, and 
some secondary schools offer salad bars. In 1987, Los Angeles Unified 
implemented a plan with such aims as increasing the consumption of wheat bread 
over white, decreasing the consumption of chocolate milk and promoting the use 
of fresh fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
Balakshin suggested that she is more concerned about the Alar scare than the 
chemical itself. Children "may be alarmed, (thinking) that it's not good for 
them to eat apples," she said. "But that's not true. It's very good for them to 
eat apples." 
</P>
<P>
Practices vary greatly from school to school and region to region. Authorities 
who have a national perspective say schools in health-conscious California 
generally have taken the lead in pushing for better nutritional standards. 
</P>
<P>
School officials find themselves operating in a gray area. The National Academy 
of Science has recommended dietary guidelines in which fat makes up no more 
than 30% of an adult's caloric intake, but there is still considerable 
disagreement over what levels are appropriate for children. 
</P>
<P>
"We've asked (the federal government) and the scientific community to put 
together a set of dietary guidelines that apply specifically to children. 
Amazingly, there is none," said Kevin Dando, a spokesman for the American 
School Food Service Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Still, many health authorities are perplexed that USDA school lunch nutrition 
standards have not changed since 1946, when Congress mandated the program. The 
standards call for a daily requirement of a half-pint of milk, two ounces of 
protein and three-quarter-cup servings of two or more vegetables or fruits, as 
well as eight servings of bread, grain or pasta per week. 
</P>
<P>
Foreman cites an example of special-interest food politics: As an official in 
the Carter Administration, she and many nutritionists advocated that schools 
shift from whole milk to low-fat milk. Over time, many schools did just that. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1986, Rep. Steve Gunderson (R-Wis.) pushed through a bill requiring 
schools to offer whole milk as well -- a move many nutritionists considered a 
step backward. USDA spokeswoman Maria Falcone said the agency is sometimes 
unfairly blamed for actions "by congressmen from states with a lot of cows." 
</P>
<P>
Dairy farmers liked Gunderson's bill because it encouraged not merely the 
consumption of milk, but milk fat. A dairy farmer whose cows produce a higher 
percentage of milk fat gets a higher price from processors because the fat can 
be used for solid products such as cheese, butter, sour cream and ice cream. 
Because there is a surplus of milk fat, they still want to sell all the whole 
milk they can. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Ziewacz, a lobbyist for the National Milk Producers Federation, says the 
debate over whole milk versus low-fat milk has been blown out proportion -- a 
difference of three grams of fat in a half-pint serving. (According to Los 
Angeles school nutritionists, the difference is four grams.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Little Frustrated 
</P>
<P>
Health crusaders have gone overboard, Ziewacz said. The American Heart Assn. 
has sent letters to congressmen that "make us sound like we're drug pushers," 
she said. "Like we're standing outside the playground -- 'Here, kid, eat cheese 
and die.' If you're a dairy farmer, you get a little frustrated with people 
telling you how milk isn't good for you." 
</P>
<P>
Another striking example of how agriculture policy influences school menus is 
the Dairy Termination Act of 1985. Enacted to curb the over-productive dairy 
industry, the law led to the slaughtering of 1.6 million cows to reduce the 
nation's dairy herds. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, schools were serving more hamburgers. Or probably cheeseburgers, 
because there was still plenty of cheese left. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the law is finally withering the mountainous surplus of processed American 
and Cheddar cheeses that piled up in the 1980s. (Butter is still given free to 
schools -- a fact that rankles both nutrition crusaders and margarine makers.) 
</P>
<P>
The cheese surplus was so great that the Reagan Administration in the early 
1980s literally gave it away, handing out truckloads in the nation's ghettos. 
Some of that cheese, for better or worse, also found its way into school 
cafeterias. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
School Lunch Act 
</P>
<P>
In fact, America's dairy policy and the school lunch have been entwined for 
decades. The lessons of World War II persuaded Congress to pass the National 
School Lunch Act in 1946 "to safeguard the health and well-being of the 
nation's children." The meals that are now widely regarded as a social program 
were advocated by military generals concerned that thousands of draftees had 
been rejected because of nutrition-related health problems. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan Administration, however, saw it as a bloated social program. Funding 
was cut by $1 billion, effectively slashing per-meal federal reimbursement 
rates. The budget-cutting finally caused an outcry when officials tried to 
reclassify ketchup and relish as vegetables and cookies as bread. Still unable 
to make ends meet, more than 2,000 schools stopped serving lunch to 2 million 
children, according to the Food Research and Action Center. 
</P>
<P>
For many school cafeterias facing tight economic times, the solution was 
cheese. 
</P>
<P>
The USDA had so much it decided the schools could have all they could eat, 
free. Normally, the department would allot a quota per district. For schools, 
the beauty of cheese was not merely its price, but the fact that it fulfills 
the meal's protein requirements. Like a family on a tight budget, schools 
started serving more macaroni and cheese and less beef and chicken. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spoiled by Cheese 
</P>
<P>
Now that the supply is running low, some fear another financial crisis. "This 
went on for such a long period of time that schools . . . started thinking of 
it as an integral part of their financing," Anita Cashman, a food services 
director in Utica, Mich., told the journal Education Week. 
</P>
<P>
Anita King, Los Angeles Unified's nutrition services manager, paused a moment 
when asked whether the cheese limits are good news or bad news. Used 
judiciously, she said, the virtues of cheese's protein, calcium, vitamins and 
taste outweigh the evil of its fat and salt. 
</P>
<P>
"All these things where people say something's good for you or something's bad 
for you -- well, you have to look at the whole picture," King said. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in her office at the district's Newman Nutrition Center in Boyle 
Heights, King spoke confidently of the meals being assembled on the factory 
floors below. More than anything else, the pervasive influence of the fast-food 
industry has changed the school lunch in recent years, she said. The Los 
Angeles district serves about 1 million burritos a month -- burritos, she 
hastens to add, that are nutritionally superior to those found in markets or 
taco joints because they are made to district specifications. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the Newman food factory makes 25,000 breakfasts and 60,000 lunches per 
day. They are trucked to scores of schools that lack full kitchen facilities. 
Even so, they represent but a fraction of Los Angeles Unified's massive 
operation, which serves 550,000 meals per day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Minding the Store 
</P>
<P>
At the Fletcher Drive Elementary School in the Glassell Park area, cafeteria 
manager Sigrid Sapone and her staff serve about 350 breakfasts and 650 lunches 
daily. It's not a wealthy neighborhood and school officials say a child 
sometimes may try to buy five cartons of milk at the subsidized price and sneak 
four home to mom. This violates the law. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very serious about that. . . . You have to be an old Scrooge 
sometimes," Principal Chris Christianson said with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to school lunches, principals have a lot of clout, and 
Christianson has his own set of rules. Chocolate milk, for example, is 
forbidden. The school district allows it as kind of a sweet bribe to get 
children the nutrients milk provides. But Christianson believes it "makes them 
hyper" and he is annoyed "by this thing where we have to cater to everybody's 
whims." 
</P>
<P>
Another rule of his: No raisins. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't eat them," Christianson explained. "They throw them. They get on 
the ground, you step on them and they get squished into the pavement. The 
custodian hates them."

ALASKAN SPRING A SEASON OF DEATH; 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK FOR RECOVERY FROM OIL SPILL UNCLEAR

VALDEZ, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They are beginning to talk about the dead in the midst of spring's unfolding. 
</P>
<P>
The dead loons, grebes and goldeneyes. The dead murres, murrelets and 
cormorants. The dead sea otters and bald eagles. 
</P>
<P>
They are talking about an experimental incinerator for these victims of the 
nation's largest marine oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point in time, they are in freezers. At this point in time we have no 
capability to burn them," said Bill Lomoreaux of the Alaska Department of 
Environmental Conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, this point in time is a season of rebirth and promise. 
</P>
<P>
Along the shallow shorelines and bays the turquoise waters are clouded with 
milky white patches of herring sperm, and Alaskans watch the horizon for the 
first signs of millions of migrating shore birds and waterfowl returning from 
warmer climes. 
</P>
<P>
All around Prince William Sound, the streams and petrified waterfalls shake off 
their icy paralysis, and blankets of snow are turned back to uncover tundra 
that yawns awake and stretches skyward. 
</P>
<P>
It is a place where the rugged Kenai Mountains rise vertically from flooded 
fiords and where nature displays its works on so grand a scale that the comings 
and goings of man would seem inconsequential. 
</P>
<P>
But man produced an oil spill to match these mountains. And his capacity for 
destruction, however accidental, has exceeded his capacity to restore. 
</P>
<P>
The season of life has become a season of dead zones. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in the wake of the March 24 spill of more than 10 million gallons of crude 
oil from the tanker Exxon Valdez, teams of biologists, pathologists, 
toxicologists, water quality experts and other scientists are descending on 
this wilderness outpost to begin assessing the environmental damage. 
</P>
<P>
Information is limited and preliminary assessments differ dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
"In two to three years -- maybe four -- you won't be able to tell it. The 
storms will clean up the shoreline," Hal Alabaster of the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration said of visible pollution on the shorelines. As for 
overall impacts, Jim Styers of the Marine Animal Training Center in Costa Mesa 
said: "I think what they'll find is it won't be nearly so bad . . . . Mother 
nature has a way of taking care of things." 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, are pessimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that that spill has the ingredients for being classified as a 
potentially major ecological disaster, with long-lasting adverse effects on the 
local environment in that region," said Jeffrey Hyland, a marine biologist at 
UC Santa Barbara's Marine Science Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Hyland's assessment is based on several factors: the size of the spill, the 
high toxicity of many of the 1,500 compounds in Prudhoe Bay crude compared to 
many other crudes, the fact that large quantities of oil washed up on fragile 
shorelines within confined areas and the fact that colder Alaskan temperatures 
will slow down the weathering or breakdown of the oil. 
</P>
<P>
The Exxon Valdez could not have run across Bligh Reef at a worse time. This is 
the most biologically sensitive season of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific herring are spawning and the salmon runs are about to begin. Ten 
million shore birds and a million waterfowl are due to pass through Prince 
William Sound any time on their way to breeding areas, temporarily adding their 
numbers to the 300,000 to 400,000 resident birds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Watching Birds Return 
</P>
<P>
"Spring is usually an exciting time a year for Alaskans. You watch the birds 
and all the animals come back, and this year you just wish spring wouldn't even 
come," said Sue Libenson, executive director of the Alaska Center for the 
Environment. 
</P>
<P>
The grim toll in the immediate aftermath became clear within days. So far, 
officials have counted nearly 500 dead sea otters, more than 2,800 dead birds, 
the cancellation of the $12.5-million, 11,000-ton herring season and a small 
shrimp harvest and hundreds of miles of oil-choked beaches, inlets and bays. Of 
the 8,000 to 10,000 otters that live in the sound, 2,500 are believed to be at 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
These numbers are believed to be only an indication of the true damage. The 
vast majority of fatalities will sink to the bottom or be washed out to sea 
without a trace. 
</P>
<P>
Several bald eagles, the national symbol, are turning up dead from eating the 
oiled carcasses of other birds. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have been startled by the immediate effects on otters. They expected 
the mammals to die of hypothermia. Oil on just 20% of their coats will double 
their metabolic rate as their bodies try in vain to maintain heat. 
</P>
<P>
But they were not prepared for the oil's toxic effects on internal organs, 
which they believe was caused by ingesting the oil as otters attempted to clean 
their luxuriant insulating coats, or by inhaling the fumes. 
</P>
<P>
Pathologists have found emphysema, lesions in lungs and liver damage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Otters Ingest Oil 
</P>
<P>
"They're curled up on the beaches and had the look and feel of crude oil coming 
out of the anus. They're ingesting the oil somehow and it must be wreaking 
havoc in the gastrointestinal tract," Ken Hill, a veterinarian involved in 
otter research, said. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw two cases of severe trauma -- chewing the skin right off their feet 
right down to the bone and rubbing the skin right off their ears. Those are two 
places where they don't have hair. It's possible that the chemicals were 
affecting those areas to such an extent they felt like grooming themselves," 
Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
Similar effects have been observed in birds. Alice Berkner of the 
Berkeley-based International Bird Rescue Center said she has seen rescued birds 
that appeared to be starving. "They cease normal behavior to constantly work on 
cleaning the feathers," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
A number of seals have been found exhibiting "unusual behavior." They are 
lethargic and people on boats are able to get much closer to them than they 
normally can. Their eyes have been damaged by the toxic water. 
</P>
<P>
Dramatic as the immediate effects have been, state and federal officials say 
the long-term effects, while not nearly as visible, could be equally as tragic. 
</P>
<P>
"We just don't know what's going to take place here, or how much they can 
tolerate. It's creating a dead zone in the middle of Prince William Sound," 
said Hill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some See Decades of Harm 
</P>
<P>
"A number of us see this as a very long-term situation, a matter of several 
decades," said Tom Williams, a veterinarian at the Monterey Bay Aquarium who 
flew here to assist in the otter rescue operation. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen research projects are being launched by the state over the next several 
years to find out the impact on salmon, herring, crab, shrimp, clam and 
rockfish fisheries. Water samples are also being gathered to measure 
concentrations of toxic compounds from the oil. 
</P>
<P>
"The body count is nowhere near what there is out there," Hill said. "Instead 
of hundreds of sea otters I would suspect you'll see a thousand or thousands of 
sea otters are going to die from this. Instead of thousands of birds you'll 
have ten thousands of birds." 
</P>
<P>
What is known leads scientists and others to both hope and despair. 
</P>
<P>
There is evidence that the kill-off of microscopic plant and animal plankton at 
the base of the food chain has been transitory. The ocean currents that sweep 
into Prince William Sound from the Gulf of Alaska are bringing with them new 
populations of plankton to replace those immediately killed by the spill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nature Helping Out 
</P>
<P>
So far, the black tide has been held back from invading the salmon hatcheries, 
and ocean currents have flushed all but an estimated 10% of the oil that 
remains on the water from the sound into the Gulf of Alaska. Indeed, nature 
seems to have done far more than man in speeding the recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Some studies, for example, have found that, although fish eggs in general are 
vulnerable to benzene and dissolved oil, salmon eggs are "extremely tolerant." 
</P>
<P>
Only very low concentrations of hydrocarbons have been detected in deep water. 
"Oil doesn't mix much down in the water," said Jerry Galt, an oceanographer 
with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
</P>
<P>
But he cautioned that biologically rich shoreline and intertidal areas are "a 
different story. We've got lots of oil there." 
</P>
<P>
The breakup of the oil has been slower than expected, probably because of the 
relatively cold water temperatures (about 30). 
</P>
<P>
The emulsion of oil and water continues to threaten shorelines and marine life 
wherever it is found. It has moved hundreds of miles beyond the site of the 
spill and jeopardizes the rich fisheries of Kodiak Island, Seward and Homer. 
Toxic compounds in a petroleum mousse whipped up by wave action can persist for 
up to 15 months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oil at Birth Sites 
</P>
<P>
Such sustained presence of the emulsion may not pose a hypothermia problem with 
seals, since they are insulated by blubber instead of hair. But there is great 
concern for newborn pups, because, although seals mate in the water, they give 
birth on land. There are disturbing indications that seals and sea lions are 
not abandoning their favorite "haul out" areas, despite the fact that the areas 
are coated with oil. 
</P>
<P>
The emulsion may also pose long-term threats to marine life that, if not 
lethal, could affect reproduction and lead to mutations. 
</P>
<P>
More than 654 million salmon are soon to be released from five hatcheries in 
the sound to begin their remarkble journey to the sea. Next month, adult salmon 
return home to oil-tainted waters after a one- to six-year odyssey at sea. 
</P>
<P>
"If the oil is right there in front of them, they have to go right through it 
or be feeding on plankton that has been affected. The results could be very 
injurious," Sheila Nickerson of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game said. 
</P>
<P>
Toxic compounds entrapped in organic matter that settles to the bottom could 
pose additional threats to crabs, lobsters and clams -- not to mention pink and 
chum salmon, which in their early life stages feed off tiny bottom-dwelling 
shrimp-like creatures and other crustaceans. In the case of sockeye salmon, the 
effects may not be known until they return in six years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chromosome Damage Feared 
</P>
<P>
There is evidence from previous spills that the oil results in damage to 
chromosomes or chromosome functions, resulting in mutations. 
</P>
<P>
Reproduction can be damaged as well. Petroleum compounds and whole oils are 
known to interfere with fish eggs at very low concentrations. The hatching of 
bird eggs is reduced, often when oil concentrations are very low. 
</P>
<P>
"Any small amount of oil in birds just before breeding will impair reproduction 
. . . . A small amount of oil will kill eggs," said Michael Fry, a pollution 
toxicologist at the UC Davis Department of Avian Sciences. He said a single 
drop of oil will penetrate the shell and kill the embryo. Stress responses will 
suppress reproduction as well. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to stave off an avian catastrophe, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service is drafting plans to scare off birds from favorite but heavily oiled 
rookeries. In non-oiled areas, pilots are being urged to fly above 1,000 feet 
in order not to disturb birds and scatter them to polluted areas. 
</P>
<P>
Delayed development of crab, lobster and shrimp and fish larvae has been noted 
when oil concentrations are as low as 1 microgram per liter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Various Effects on Life 
</P>
<P>
But the effects vary among living things and among the various stages of their 
development. Marine worms, snails and very small crustaceans seem to suffer no 
lasting damage, according to the National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
But corals, clams, oysters, crabs, lobsters and shrimp, for example, "can 
suffer marked and sometimes long-term (years) reproductive damage at oiled 
sites," the academy reported in its 1985 volume "Oil in the Sea: Inputs, Fates 
and Effects." 
</P>
<P>
After the Amoco Cadiz spill off the coast of Brittany in 1978, field studies 
turned up fin erosion in 80% of flatfish up to nine months after the spill, but 
this decreased to about 10% over the next 11 months. Abnormal growth of 
chloride cells in invertebrates was also observed. 
</P>
<P>
But the academy said that "mortalities among commercially important species 
were insignificant." 
</P>
<P>
Chronic pollution -- which is expected to occur in portions of Prince William 
Sound as oil trapped in the rocks and sediments slowly returns to the water -- 
will likely cause long-term problems. Oil has been found to have penetrated 
some shoreline beaches as deep as eight inches. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Birds Vulnerable 
</P>
<P>
"It is a long-term release of oil in low, chronic levels which will affect 
reproduction capabilities of benthic (bottom-living) organisms . . . . Otters 
may see some impact on reproduction because of ingestion of oil. Birds are 
particularly vulnerable," said Brad Hahn, a scientist with the Alaska 
Department of Environmental Conservation. 
</P>
<P>
During the Amoco Cadiz spill, numerous sub-tidal razor clams and heart urchins 
were killed in the first weeks. A year later, scientists followed the 
disappearance of bottom-dwelling crustaceans as the oil found its way into the 
sediments. 
</P>
<P>
In other oil spills, damage to clams, mussels, and other species that either 
live on the bottom or in intertidal areas, which are exposed to air during low 
tide, has been readily apparent. 
</P>
<P>
In the inlets and bays of Prince William Sound, as well as many of its islands, 
intertidal areas were covered with thick, mud-like oil from the Exxon Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
Oil concentrations as low as 1 part per million kill or result in mutations in 
50% of the herring stock affected, Alaska Fish and Game spokesman Jon Lyman 
said. Wild stocks of pink and chum salmon, as distinguished from hatchery 
stocks, spawn in the intertidal zones of freshwater streams, many of which have 
been overrun by oil. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Care Needed in Cleanup 
</P>
<P>
"That in itself is a concern as far as cleaning of beaches. We have to be very 
careful about what areas do get cleaned. We could lose significant numbers of 
wild stocks," Lyman said. 
</P>
<P>
Charles J. DiBona, president of the American Petroleum Institute, nevertheless 
remains hopeful. "The studies suggest that the longer-term impacts, the 
biological impacts, are very small," he said. Based on past spills, he said 
"long-term" could be defined as about a year. 
</P>
<P>
But Jay D. Hair, president of the National Wildlife Federation, compares the 
tragedy to the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident in the Soviet Union and 
the Union Carbide disaster at Bhopal, India, in which more than 2,000 were 
killed in December, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"We will never see Prince William Sound again as it was on March 23, 1989," 
Hair said of the day before the spill. "It's every bit as severe as Union 
Carbide's Bhopal or the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl. In terms of the 
long-term environmental ramifications, Prince William Sound ranks as one of the 
country's and world's worst environmental disasters." 
</P>
<P>
Scientists, however, say the jury is still out.

JORDAN UNREST SUBSIDES BUT PRESSURE ON HUSSEIN GROWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
AMMAN, Jordan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Political pressure mounted Saturday on King Hussein to dismiss his government 
and delay further IMF-mandated economic reforms following four days of bloody 
rioting over price increases. 
</P>
<P>
Although the capital has been relatively unaffected by the unrest, several 
thousand heavily armed troops remained deployed throughout Salt, 13 miles 
northwest of Amman, where rioting overnight left at least 21 people injured and 
caused widespread damage. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from a small and peaceful demonstration by university students in Amman, 
no further protests were reported Saturday, although the situation in Salt, 
Maan, Karak and several other riot-torn towns remained extremely tense. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation now, touch wood, is calm," Crown Prince Hassan, the king's 
brother, told a news conference at the royal palace. Hassan is acting as regent 
until the king returns from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The crown prince said the rioting, which began in the southern city of Maan on 
Tuesday and spread north through several towns along the Jordan River to Salt 
on Friday, left eight people dead and more than 100 injured. 
</P>
<P>
Hassan acknowledged that the rioting began as an apparently spontaneous protest 
over sudden increases of 20% to 50% in the prices of gasoline, milk powder, 
clarified butter and other imported commodities. 
</P>
<P>
Islamic fundamentalists and extreme leftists then sought to exploit it, and 
nearly 130 of the latter -- mostly members of Jordan's banned Communist Party 
-- were arrested, he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the prince only alluded to a more disturbing factor, which was the way 
the riots, edging their way up the Jordan Valley, quickly fused economic with 
social and political grievances and assumed, in the end, the dimensions of a 
violent referendum on the unpopularity of the government of Prime Minister Zaid 
Rifai. 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats in Amman said they thought that Hussein, who is to return 
home today, may eventually have to dismiss Rifai, who is widely seen as having 
mismanaged an economic crisis brought on by years of deficit spending, a 
precipitous drop in revenues and the ensuing collapse of Jordan's currency, the 
dinar. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the latest price increases was also badly handled, several 
analysts said, because they came during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, when 
food consumption and family entertainment expenses both rise as a result of the 
lavish Iftar feasts that begin at sunset after each day of fasting. 
</P>
<P>
"The way it was done, it almost appeared as if the government was trying to 
time the increases to have the worst possible impact," one diplomat said. "To 
most people, it was another example of the way this government doesn't seem to 
care about their problems," he added. 
</P>
<P>
That allegation was echoed in an extraordinary open letter that Jordan's 
professional associations sent to Hassan on Saturday, urging both restraint in 
dealing with the protesters and supporting their demands for Rifai's dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
"The high price paid by the nation in losses of government property is all the 
result of a failure to deal preventively with the problem at its roots," the 
signed letter said. 
</P>
<P>
Urging the prince "not to compound the error with more bloodshed," the letter 
recommended that troops be withdrawn from city centers in order to create "an 
atmosphere for dialogue with the brothers and sons who protested against the 
injustice and disdain of a government that the people had hoped would be 
replaced long ago." 
</P>
<P>
The letter was signed by the heads of 10 associations representing about 40,000 
engineers, doctors, dentists, lawyers, pharmacists, veterinarians, journalists, 
geologists and agricultural scientists. 
</P>
<P>
While the professionals, like the poorer protesters they sympathized with, were 
careful not to criticize Hussein personally, their letter hinted that the 
monarch could become the next target of the discontent unless he responds 
quickly and positively to the rioters' complaints. 
</P>
<P>
It said there is an urgent need for a new government that "would enjoy national 
credibility" and strongly implied that the continuation of the present 
government would erode the credibility of the monarchy itself. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said that the king is now clearly in a difficult position, for while 
he has escaped any personal blame for the economic crisis and the widespread 
discontent it has spawned, there now seems to be an equally widespread 
expectation that, when he returns from the United States, he will quickly set 
things right. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 'Very Difficult Situation' 
</P>
<P>
"He's in a very difficult situation, no doubt about it," one Western envoy 
said. "I think Rifai will have to go soon, although not immediately because 
that would look like capitulation." 
</P>
<P>
Dealing with the economic crisis will be more problematic, however. "Hussein 
can't rescind the price increases, but he may have to delay other increases and 
measures that were in the pipeline," even though this may create new 
difficulties with the International Monetary Fund on the rescheduling of 
Jordan's $6-billion debt, the diplomat added. 
</P>
<P>
Crown Prince Hassan told reporters that Jordan will "not be deterred by . . . 
violent pressures from obviating our economic problems." 
</P>
<P>
That his elder brother will be under great pressure to rescind, or at least 
postpone, some of the more austere economic reforms was clear from a visit to 
Salt, however. 
</P>
<P>
The twisted remains of overturned and burned-out cars and buses blocked a dozen 
squares and intersections, while the streets around them were a littered carpet 
of broken glass, stones, tear-gas canisters and spent shell casings. Gaping 
black holes marked the locations where four banks, a finance company and dozens 
of government-owned or -run stores had stood the night before. 
</P>
<P>
But the most frightening aspect of this scene were the sullen and unemployed 
young men who loitered amid the litter of the previous night's rampage, anger 
and frustration still plainly etched on their faces. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, King Hussein blamed the rioting at home on the failure of 
several Arab governments to honor their longstanding promises of financial aid 
to Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Asked in a Cable News Network interview to name the Arab states that had 
reneged on their promises, Hussein replied, "They range from Libya, Algeria, to 
Saudi Arabia and the (Persian) Gulf states as well as Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
Expounding on the rioting, Hussein said: 
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy for Jordanians. I am sad that these incidents have happened, but 
on the other hand, I am proud of the overall majority of people who have taken 
it as all of us are doing. . . . We are certainly determined to stand in the 
future and stand on our own feet."

PARADE LEADS OLD MAGNOLIA TO NEW HOME

<P>
In one of the more unlikely parades ever seen in these parts, a tree was moved 
in San Bernardino on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Led by a junior high school marching band, two huge cranes, a bulldozer and a 
police escort, a 6-story-tall, 100-year-old southern magnolia tree was 
transported 1 1/2 miles along downtown streets from a lot cleared for 
development to a new home in Seccombe Lake Park. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like King Kong coming down the street," said Woody Wood, a volunteer 
who helped guide the vehicles on their 1-m.p.h. journey along a route 
calculated to avoid power lines and building overhangs. 
</P>
<P>
Although heavily publicized, this particular parade came as a shock to many in 
town. 
</P>
<P>
"I was working on my day off and my son came in yelling, 'Dad, there's a parade 
outside and this big tree!' " said Dennis McGrath, 37, an account executive. "I 
said, 'On April 22? ' " 
</P>
<P>
Once outside, McGrath could scarcely believe his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"What is this? Where'd this tree come from? Who's paying for this?" he asked 
incredulously as the spectacle lumbered past City Hall. "I guess San Bernardino 
has finally made the big time." 
</P>
<P>
McGrath was one of more than 1,000 residents, elected officials and volunteers 
who witnessed the relocation of the 130-ton tree that for some has come to 
symbolize the cultural heritage of this rapidly changing community where few 
things more than 100 years old remain. But for others, including a mayoral 
hopeful, the whole thing was a big waste of money. 
</P>
<P>
"This magnificent tree has survived earthquakes, a severe flood, years of 
scorching summers and the smoke of a (nearby) foundry," said state Sen. Ruben 
Ayala (D-Chino), who helped organize the $25,000 project that was largely 
funded through donations ranging from the nickels and dimes of schoolchildren 
to a $10,000 grant from the Mervyn's department store chain. "Way back, it even 
shaded a Wells Fargo stage coach station." 
</P>
<P>
City officials plan to submit the effort to the Guinness Book of World Records 
as the heaviest tree ever moved. "Originally, the U.S. Air Force agreed to lend 
us a missile carrier to transport it, but the missile carrier could not handle 
a 130-ton load," said Sam Catalano, president of a group called the More 
Attractive Community Foundation. "So we went to the U.S. Marine Corps to borrow 
a tank carrier but they said the biggest tanks are only 20 to 80 tons." 
</P>
<P>
What they settled on was a specially outfitted flatbed trailer rig with 128 
wheels and two cranes, one of which was a 250-ton monster brought in from Long 
Beach by the Bragg Crane Service. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Garage-Sized Planter 
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the move, the tree was pruned and skirted with a planter box 
the size of a two-car garage and built with $12,000 worth of lumber donated by 
the John C. Morgan Production Framing Co. of San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
The event culminated a year-long struggle to spare the tree from the chain saws 
of developer Ken Bussey, who is building an industrial park. In a telephone 
interview, Bussey said although he is not personally attached to the tree, he 
agreed to delay demolition a year ago this week until others could find a way 
of saving it. 
</P>
<P>
Bussey said it is one of the ugliest trees he has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
For Dennis Mansfield, co-owner of Hydro-Gro Hydro-Seeding of San Bernardino, 
however, saving the tree became an obsession. 
</P>
<P>
"A year ago, my partner (Woody Wood) and I made a personal crusade out of 
calling people and knocking on doors asking for funds to save it," Mansfield 
said. "Suddenly, we had arborists calling us wanting to help." 
</P>
<P>
One of these experts was Todd Head, who along with a tree pathologist, examined 
the old magnolia a year ago and determined it was healthy and fit to move. 
</P>
<P>
"It was full of foliage and had nice new feeder roots," Head said. "But the key 
to the tree's health is that it sat directly on top of a water table 16 feet 
below the surface." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Up to 80 Feet Tall 
</P>
<P>
The southern magnolia, which bears the botanical name Magnolia grandiflora, is 
native to the southeastern swamplands of the United States. Under ideal 
conditions, the tree, which is characterized by its broad green leaves and 
fragrant flowers up to nine inches in diameter, grows 25 to 80 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
At 9:15 a.m., the two cranes shuddered and creaked as they lifted the tree with 
3-inch-thick cables attached to steel beams placed beneath the planter box. 
Moments later, the tree was carefully lowered onto the flatbed rig. 
</P>
<P>
"We have lift-off!" cried Mansfield as hundreds of others applauded, cheered 
and whistled. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, political hopefuls facing primary elections worked the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"This symbolizes that San Bernardino, for the first time in a long time, is 
interested in saving some of its history, " said San Bernardino Mayor Evlyn 
Wilcox. 
</P>
<P>
Her opponent, former mayor Bob Holcomb, strongly disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"There's some talk that there ought to be a society for the prevention of 
cruelty to trees," Holcomb said. "This is a political extravaganza at the 
taxpayers' expense."

KEEPING EMPLOYEES HAPPY;

<P>
SPORTSWEAR FIRM BEEFS UP BENEFITS TO BOOST WORKER CONTENTMENT

<P>
Being nice is just good business at sportswear maker Patagonia, where keeping 
workers happy is so important that an occasional "surf break" can replace the 
traditional coffee break. 
</P>
<P>
The brainchild of business rebel Yvon Chouinard, Patagonia broke ground in the 
1970s by thumbing its nose at fashion standards with an emphasis on function 
over style, as well as by nurturing employee contentment. 
</P>
<P>
Patagonia is part of a national trend that finds many companies beefing up 
benefits to recruit and retain employees. 
</P>
<P>
Patagonia's status as an industry rebel changed as its sturdy, brightly colored 
clothing became trendy and its corporate generosity helped turn the once-tiny 
venture into a multimillion-dollar international enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Its most prominent customer is President George Bush, who recently appeared on 
the cover of People magazine and was pictured in a two-page spread in Sports 
Illustrated wearing a Patagonia jacket. 
</P>
<P>
The company's customers range from Himalayan climbers and white-water kayakers 
to weekend campers and patrician horseshoe players like Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Another prominent customer is the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration, which outfits space shuttle astronauts in long underwear made 
of Patagonia's trademarked Capilene material, company spokeswoman Karen 
Frishman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Business Beginnings 
</P>
<P>
Chouinard, who entered business selling hand-forged mountain-climbing gear from 
the back of his pickup truck, has created such a nurturing and productive work 
environment that competitors routinely try to lure Patagonia workers away, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"You get out of benefits what you put into them," said Chouinard, 50, who 
founded the company on the Southern California coast to be close to its surfing 
beaches. 
</P>
<P>
"We have more benefits than just about any company around, and it pays off in 
terms of production." 
</P>
<P>
Perks include an on-site day-care center and school for children ranging in age 
from 8 weeks to 14 years, generous parental and health benefits, employee 
recognition programs, subsidized wilderness adventures and employee prices on 
company clothing 10% below wholesale. 
</P>
<P>
"The day-care center is a profit center in my mind," Chouinard said. "It keeps 
five to 10 people a year from having to quit. That saves us a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
Chouinard, who owns Patagonia's parent company, Lost Arrow Corp., outright, 
said it costs him up to $50,000 to bring a new worker to peak efficiency. Pay 
ranges from about $6 an hour for entry-level warehouse workers to between 
$50,000 and $100,000 for middle managers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paid Maternity Leave 
</P>
<P>
Working mothers, who get two months paid maternity leave, rave about the 
day-care center. 
</P>
<P>
"All three of my kids are here at some point in the day, so I am able to keep 
close tabs on them," said accountant Pat Haycox, whose youngsters range in age 
from 3 to 9. "They're much more relaxed being close by and I'm more relaxed 
too." 
</P>
<P>
"It's great," said new mother Dee-dee Locey, the company's payroll 
administrator who brings her 6-month-old daughter to the infant-care center. 
"I'm still nursing my baby, so I can keep on nursing and I don't have any 
anxieties about being away from her because she's right here at work." 
</P>
<P>
Women represent 60% of Patagonia's 450-member work force, a percentage that 
extends to upper management, making the state-licensed child-care facilities 
especially attractive benefits, administrative director Pam Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Employees are free to leave their desks and visit the children, and youngsters 
can use telephones to call working parents for a kind word. 
</P>
<P>
"They know that if they really need mom, she's there," said Anita Garaway, 
child-care coordinator. "Our kids consistently test higher than average when 
they leave for public school because what it all boils down to is that they 
feel good about themselves." 
</P>
<P>
The day-care center and after-school programs serve about 80 youngsters, 87% of 
whom are the children of company employees, Garaway said. 
</P>
<P>
Director of human resources Susan Greene, sweaty and still wearing a leotard 
and T-shirt after lunch-hour exercise, said having the day-care center nearby 
can also be a comfort to childless workers like her. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're having a bad day you can go down and finger-paint in chocolate 
pudding with the kids," Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
Patagonia encourages lunch-time exercise and allows occasional surf breaks as 
part of the company's focus on preventive measures to reduce major health 
claims, Frishman said. 
</P>
<P>
Company headquarters feature a sand volleyball court, showers and an 
inexpensive cafeteria offering a variety of health food. 
</P>
<P>
A morning aerobics exercise class runs on company premises and overweight 
workers can take part in an on-site Weight Watchers class. 
</P>
<P>
Another benefit is "flex-time" scheduling, allowing workers like two avid 
mountain climbers to fill the same position during alternating three-month 
periods of the year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Firms Taking Notice 
</P>
<P>
Other companies are recognizing the value of cultivating worker happiness, said 
Laraine Engel, research manager for the Merchants and Manufacturers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"They know they have to do something to keep good people around," Engel said, 
adding that medical benefits rose 33% nationwide in 1987 and 22% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Representing Lost Arrow's hiring priorities is chief executive officer Patrick 
O'Donnell, whose mountaineering resume, which includes a conquest of 
23,400-foot Nun Kun in India, is matched by professional exploits that include 
founding the Kirkwood ski area near Lake Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
The company is a successful mix of retail, mail-order and wholesale ventures, 
serving hundreds of wholesale customers while operating eight retail stores, 
including one in Chamonix, France. 
</P>
<P>
Its irreverent catalogue features tongue-in-cheek photos like one showing a man 
modeling a sports coat while covered head to toe in a blanket of dripping mud. 
</P>
<P>
Lost Arrow's worth is a poorly kept secret because although sales figures are 
not made public, it has a well-publicized program of donating 10% of its 
profits each year to organizations ranging from the United Way to the 
environmentally oriented Surfrider Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Donations to more than 200 groups amounted to more than $500,000 in 1988 and 
are expected to near $1 million in 1989, according to company literature. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its success, Patagonia isn't ready to stop trying to keep workers 
happy. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for new ways to move into the '90s," Murphy said. "We're seeing 
the worker pool diminishing, so we can't be static. What exists today might not 
be enough five years from now."

TIRED OF HAVING LITTLE SAY, TEACHERS PUSHING FOR SHARED AUTHORITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE WOO, Times Education Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At Jefferson High School in South-Central Los Angeles, Cathy Nadler and a small 
group of fellow teachers run a special program in which they devise the 
courses, write the curriculum, choose their own textbooks and directly control 
some money for books and supplies -- all without having an administrator 
peering over their shoulders every step of the way. 
</P>
<P>
"Teachers make all the decisions," Nadler, a 16-year veteran of the classroom, 
said with pride, "and administrators come in at the end." 
</P>
<P>
That may not sound like much to crow about. But for teachers, who have long 
complained about being treated like "tall children" by their bosses, such 
autonomy is all too rare. And that, say teachers and other education experts, 
is a big part of the problem facing public schools. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Held Accountable 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, teachers are left out of decisions about books, money, 
teaching methods, class schedules and course content but are held accountable 
-- by parents, the public and administrators -- when academic goals are not 
met. 
</P>
<P>
Tired of having little real authority to change what they think is wrong, 
teachers in Los Angeles and other districts throughout the country are 
pressuring their school boards and superintendents to share the reins of power 
with them. They talk of "teacher empowerment" and "shared decision-making" as 
the keystones of improving schools. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles school district, where labor negotiations between teachers 
and the administration have been deadlocked for months, the 22,000-member 
teachers union is making its strongest push ever to insert broader powers and 
professional rights for teachers into its contract. 
</P>
<P>
Some demands are not controversial, such as eliminating yard duty for 
elementary school teachers, while others, such as a union proposal to give 
those teachers at least one hourlong preparation period a week, have met with 
stubborn resistance from the administration. 
</P>
<P>
But the most contentious issue, aside from salary demands, centers on changing 
the system of school management. The district and the union have floated 
proposals to create school councils to make many decisions that traditionally 
have been the sole province of the principal, including budget allocations and 
scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
The union wants teachers to hold the balance of power on the councils, a 
stipulation strongly opposed by a Board of Education majority that, union 
officials say, favors administrators over teachers. 
</P>
<P>
As tension builds over a threatened teacher walkout May 30, union leaders hope 
that they can hold onto board member July Korenstein's seat in the June 6 
runoff election as well as pick up another supporter, Mark Slavkin. Korenstein 
faces Gerald E. Horowitz, principal of Richard E. Byrd Junior High School, and 
Slavkin is challenging board member Alan Gershman. 
</P>
<P>
"No one gives up power willingly," United Teachers-Los Angeles President Wayne 
Johnson said. "Administrators, particularly at the school site level, are 
really terrified that somehow their power and control is going to be 
dismantled, that teachers and parents will suddenly be running the schools and 
they are going to be gofers. The principals are the real obstructionists." 
</P>
<P>
Broad-scale experiments with new forms of school governance are under way in 
Dade County Public Schools in Florida and Rochester City Schools in New York, 
and smaller efforts are being made in places such as the Poway Unified School 
District in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
In Dade County, 96 of the 263 schools have signed up for school-based 
management, a term for the movement toward giving teachers more say in budgets, 
programs and curriculum. In the San Diego County city of Poway, a new panel 
dominated by teachers makes all decisions relating to training and hiring of 
new instructors. 
</P>
<P>
But no one has hard evidence that such radical restructuring of schools 
achieves the ultimate goal -- higher student achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Said Marc Tucker, president of the Rochester-based National Center on Education 
and the Economy, who helped draft an influential Carnegie Foundation report 
three years ago on the need to give teachers a stronger voice: "The object of 
the game is to produce big gains in student performance. In order to do that, 
you have to have in mind a very different way of managing the work of people 
not just in (individual) schools but in school districts. It takes a long time 
to carry out that kind of reorganization. I don't really think we have" 
definitive results yet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The Latest Panacea' 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, school-based management has become "the latest panacea for 
improving schools," said Gary Jerome, a legislative consultant to state Sen. 
Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach). Bergeson, a former teacher, is the author of 
one of five bills the state Legislature is considering this year that are aimed 
at shifting more decision-making power to individual schools and to teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Collins, principal of Grant High School in Van Nuys, where a form of 
shared decision-making has existed for three years, said principals are not 
fearful of losing power. In fact, he said, most principals he has talked to 
react favorably to the idea. But he acknowledges that sharing authority with 
teachers "changes the traditional relationship" between faculty and 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
"It involves a very close, trusting relationship," he said. "If the faculty is 
going to use it as a power play, then the program isn't going to work. If the 
principal is going to nix everything, that's not going to work either." 
</P>
<P>
At Grant, Collins said, major decisions are made through the consensus of a 
school council of teachers, administrators and students, the academic senate 
and himself. Theoretically, no decisions are made without the agreement of all 
three parties. Sometimes the process has resulted in actions that Collins 
initially opposed, such as last year when the faculty, concerned about student 
discipline problems, wanted the school to hire another dean. 
</P>
<P>
"I resisted it," the principal said. "I thought, 'Do I need another dean or 
another counselor?' They continued to press the issue, and I finally felt 
(their reasons) were convincing. Now we have three deans instead of two. It's 
worked out real well." 
</P>
<P>
Alan Ringer, who serves as Grant's faculty chairman and union representative, 
said the system more closely approximates "shared idea-making" than shared 
decision-making because the principal still has the final say in all matters. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, "it's better than not having anything at all," he said. "Teachers 
feel involved. They feel that somebody listens to them. And when we help make 
decisions, we're more apt to buy into them than if they're just foisted on us. 
There is more unity, and more things get done." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Have a Vested Interest' 
</P>
<P>
Jefferson High's Nadler agreed. "When workers have a vested interest in the 
company, the company is successful," she said. "The same goes for teachers and 
schools." 
</P>
<P>
Nadler is a participant in the teacher-run Humanitas Program, which promotes 
interdisciplinary learning. It operates in 17 Los Angeles district high 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers follow district and state requirements, but because the program is 
financed primarily by private foundations, they have an unusual degree of 
freedom. They decide what grade levels the program will reach, recruit the 
students, pick the themes they will weave through the courses, and choose their 
own books and materials. 
</P>
<P>
At Jefferson, for instance, the 10th-grade Humanitas staff decided to teach 
history, literature, science and art to show the development of Western 
civilization, said Nadler, who teaches social studies. 
</P>
<P>
"Teacher empowerment was the primary reason for starting the program," said 
Judy Johnson of the Los Angeles Educational Partnership, a nonprofit 
organization that raises money from corporations and foundations and 
administers the Humanitas Program. "We operate on the theory that the people 
who know best are the people who work with kids everyday in the classroom. They 
need the freedom to experiment . . . to get support from each other and make 
the curriculum richer." 
</P>
<P>
Educational Partnership also puts money directly into teachers' hands by 
providing small annual grants -- $1,000 for the program and an additional $200 
per teacher. This enables teachers to pay for extras, such as field trips or 
books that state monies will not cover, without digging into their own pockets 
or wading through district red tape. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers say that having the power to run their own program has led to big 
payoffs, beginning with enhanced job satisfaction. "This program blows teacher 
isolation out the window," said Phil Bliss, a 10th-grade biology teacher. 
"We're constantly talking to each other, coming up with new ideas. It's 
stimulating." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Seem More Enthusiastic' 
</P>
<P>
Students enrolled in the Humanitas program at Jefferson seem to notice the 
difference. "Our teachers seem more enthusiastic," said Portia Neal, 17. 
"They're always talking with each other, and they want to see how we're doing 
in all our classes." 
</P>
<P>
Nadler and other teachers say they have noticed that students try harder than 
they do in regular classes, improving in reading -- in some cases, by two or 
three grade levels -- and causing fewer discipline problems. 
</P>
<P>
But with the participation of only 116 of the district's 26,000 classroom 
teachers, the Humanitas program is a modest effort. "We're still stuck in a 
system that is very slow to change," Nadler said. "We're a very tiny piece of a 
big picture." 
</P>
<P>
In other districts, teachers and school boards are struggling to find a way to 
change the whole system, instead of just a few schools. 
</P>
<P>
In 37 of 153 schools in the San Diego Unified School District, the faculty and 
administration have volunteered to set up governing councils to reorganize 
their school. The changes range from reorganizing the way instruction is 
delivered to limited-English students to breaking large schools into smaller, 
more manageable clusters. 
</P>
<P>
In the Poway Unified School District, four experienced teachers were chosen 
last year to supervise and train new teachers. And a peer review board made up 
of three union members and two district representatives assesses new teachers 
and decides who will be retained. 
</P>
<P>
Dade County Public Schools, which include Miami, is experimenting with shared 
decision-making on the broadest scale of any district nationally. 
</P>
<P>
In 96 schools, the faculty and principal have agreed to form "cadres" that have 
the authority to make decisions involving nearly every aspect of school 
operations. Some schools have adopted peer review, said Assistant Supt. Gerald 
O. Dreyfuss. In other schools, the cadres have eliminated the assistant 
principal's job and changed the schedule to provide longer blocks of 
instruction time. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Tornillo, executive vice president of United Teachers of Dade, said it is 
too early to tell if the new system of school management is helping students 
learn. But he said it has changed the atmosphere of schools for the better. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to describe, but when you walk through the door, you know something 
different is going on," he said. "You talk to teachers and you talk to students 
and you get the feeling, 'My goodness, how can these people be so 
enthusiastic?' There's an electricity in the air. That's got to make a 
difference."

COLLECTION GIVES HIM A LOT TO SMILE ABOUT

<TEXT>
<P>
Now we know what became of all those sappy smiling yellow faces after they were 
abused out of circulation in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
They died and found a happy heaven in Bruce Woodbury's bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
Woodbury, 25, a San Francisco resident who is otherwise in control of his 
faculties, has a quirky ambition. He wants to be "the man of 1,000 faces." 
Literally. 
</P>
<P>
He has 750 artifacts of the smile that darkened as many moods as it brightened. 
He has a smiley-face cookie jar, cat dish, cuff links, playing cards, coffeepot 
and cups, coasters, clock and car mat. That is just the C's. 
</P>
<P>
In the B category, he has 300 different smiley-face buttons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Risky Business 
</P>
<P>
These he displays in his job as an auto parts salesman, although wearing a 
smiley-face button is risky in this line of work. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people do hate them," Woodbury admits, "but it's really a harmless thing. 
I get the connotation that people think it's tacky. But that's OK. I have a 
generally tacky personality." 
</P>
<P>
It takes something major to irritate Woodbury. Like a smiley face with a nose 
on it. "I draw the line at noses," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Another annoyance is the desecration of the symbol. Smiley-face T-shirts with 
bloody bullet holes and blown-out brains he can handle. "But the whole thing 
got overblown when they started putting smiley faces on toilet brushes," he 
says. "That was its downfall. People got sick of it." 
</P>
<P>
Woodbury first put on a happy face in 1982, a year after he graduated from high 
school. He bought a motor scooter and fancied himself a "mod," after the 
British subculture of the early '60s. 
</P>
<P>
In mod lingo, a "face" is someone cool. Thus evolved the Smiley Face Scooter 
Club. Riding two abreast, they cruised the streets of his native San Mateo, 
wearing mod suits highlighted by a yellow smiley button on each narrow lapel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gets a Lot of Ribbing 
</P>
<P>
"You get a lot of ribbing from people in four-wheel-drive trucks," he says. 
"Girls in Camaros aren't too impressed, either. So you delve into your group a 
little more." 
</P>
<P>
His parents, who operate a San Jose printing shop, have a better understanding. 
</P>
<P>
"Bruce collects things that nobody else wants," says his mother, Janet. "He 
doesn't mind being 10 or 15 years behind the times." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after founding the Smiley Face Scooter Club, the smiley man decided one 
button wasn't enough. He needed 100. That came easy, back in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Then he went for 200 buttons, and further into the smiley underworld of night 
lights and yo-yos, golf balls, key rings, pencil sharpeners, lunch bags, lamp 
shades and full breakfast sets. He had the market cornered and moved his bed 
into the dressing room to establish his bedroom as a smiley shrine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fad Has Resurfaced 
</P>
<P>
In late 1988, the fad resurfaced. A London nightclub movement called "acid 
house" adopted the insignia. It embodied the happy disposition of kids stoned 
to the rafters on the drug ecstasy, trance-dancing till dawn. T-shirts began 
appearing with the innocent face on the front and subtle messages on the back, 
such as "Have a Nice Trip." 
</P>
<P>
Woodbury doesn't mind being thought of as weird, but he would prefer that the 
drug culture stay away from his fetish. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it that the smiley faces are coming back," he says, "but it's sad that 
people think everyone who has a smiley face now is a drug addict." 
</P>
<P>
Now the market has tightened. An original smiley water glass has inflated from 
50 cents to $5, and a plastic garbage can is up from 69 cents to $25. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Smiley-Face Boutique 
</P>
<P>
Oversize pink smiley T-shirts, complete with shoulder pads, are now available 
in clothing stores at the Stonestown mall. There is a smiley-face boutique in 
Macy's New York, and the design has appeared in at least one back yard 
satellite dish. 
</P>
<P>
The symbol has attached itself to the '60s fashion revival. San Francisco 
button maker Mark Rodman produced the first smile button in 1968, but there is 
no hard evidence that any self-respecting hippie ever wore one before 1970. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, the '70s were just really boring, and the smiley face will be the 
most prominent representation of the decade," Woodbury says. "But the fad will 
die fairly quickly."

INDIAN WEAVERS OF VARANASI KEEP AGE-OLD CRAFT ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

VARANASI, India 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The loom's steady click filled the room as the weaver's deft hands pushed a 
shuttle between threads hanging from a machine that looked to be from medieval 
times. 
</P>
<P>
Connected to the stick was a fine thread, almost invisible. With a flick of his 
wrist and a push of the foot pedal, the weaver added it to hundreds of other 
threads as he practiced one of the world's great arts -- creating the finely 
woven silks of Varanasi, known as Benares silks for the city's pre-independence 
name. 
</P>
<P>
A Benares silk sari is to the Indian bride what the finest crystal or china is 
to Americans. It is a symbol of luxury and a thing of beauty, with glittering 
colors interlaced with delicately woven flowers or geometric patterns in silver 
or gold. In fashion-conscious New Delhi or Bombay, its shimmering folds catch 
even the most jaded eye. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High-Priced Works of Art 
</P>
<P>
As with other works of art, Benares silks are expensive. In a country where the 
average annual income is still about $200, the cost of even the simplest 
Benares hand-woven sari is $100 to $135, and fine ones can cost $260 to $325, a 
month's salary for a well-established middle-class Indian -- and much more than 
that for the average family. 
</P>
<P>
The average weaver, however, will earn only $2.50 or $3.50 a day for his 
labors. 
</P>
<P>
Here in India's heartland, in a city said to be the oldest inhabited religious 
center in the world, weaving is a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
Far from New Delhi's fine hotels and diplomatic receptions, thousands of 
Varanasi men sit at their old looms, their fingers moving swiftly between the 
wefts as their wives prepare silk threads and their sons watch and learn. The 
men, in dark, cramped rooms -- sweating in summer, freezing in winter -- do 
what their fathers and grandfathers and great-grandfathers did: craft fine 
silks that adorn the rich and famous of India. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Long History 
</P>
<P>
Four hundred years ago, powerful Mogul princes wore jackets woven of silk and 
gold by weavers here, while ladies in royal harems wrapped themselves in 
delicate, diaphanous brocades. And for centuries before the Moguls, wives of 
wealthy Hindu merchants provided a ready market for Benares silks. 
</P>
<P>
The financial demands and pressures of modern life have virtually destroyed 
traditional crafts in many countries, and even in tradition-bound India, many 
of the old crafts have only a few practitioners. Even for the silk weavers in 
Varanasi, much has changed. 
</P>
<P>
In the old days, a master craftsman was designer and creator, carrying in his 
head the tens of thousands of steps necessary to weave a single piece. 
</P>
<P>
Today, for most of the craftsmen, predesigned punch cards hooked to the top of 
the loom create the design, while the weaver brings only his weaving skills to 
the creation. The cards save time and allow specialization, but they also limit 
weaving techniques and designs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weaves a Small Version 
</P>
<P>
Jaafar Ali is a holdover from the old school, a man who sketches a fine design 
and then painstakingly weaves a small version to guide the weavers who will 
make the six-yard-long sari. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned from my grandfather, and he learned from those before," he said, as 
his two teen-age grandsons, Nasir Ahmad and Mohammed Arif, watched him work. 
The boys started with him when they were 12 or 13, and in four or five years 
will have learned enough to work on their own. 
</P>
<P>
The weaving community is a close one, and most of its members view modern 
concepts of schooling as unnecessary. Instead, as ancient guilds once did, the 
weavers teach their own. "We are weavers. We like to teach our children our 
craft. That is why they don't go to school. If they went to school, how could 
they have time to learn the craft?" Ali asked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeming Anomaly 
</P>
<P>
Ali, like most weavers here, is Muslim, a seeming anomaly in Varanasi, 
considered by Hindus to be their holiest city. But it is logical when viewed 
against the backdrop of Indian history. 
</P>
<P>
When the Moguls swept across India, they brought Islam with them. "The Mogul 
princes were the patrons, the people who bought the finely woven silks and 
brocades, so the weavers naturally became Muslims as well," said B. 
Chakravarty, a department head at the nearby government-run weavers' center. 
</P>
<P>
While some Varanasi weavers are now using more modern methods, efforts are 
being made at the weavers' center and other institutes to revive some ancient 
techniques all but lost. 
</P>
<P>
Traditions are being relearned in part because affluent Indians want to 
purchase items made by such methods, and the popular Festival of India that has 
traveled internationally to celebrate Indian culture has sparked interest in 
Indian silks in other countries as well.

RETIREMENT'S IMPACT ON MARRIAGE LIMITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Many people may dread or delay retiring because they fear ruining their 
marriage, but a recent study found that the husband's retirement does not 
create serious marital problems for most couples. 
</P>
<P>
In the three-year study of 92 couples, a majority -- 60% -- said the husband's 
retirement within the past year had meant a "somewhat better" or "much better" 
better quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
Only 10% of the couples reported their relationships had deteriorated since the 
retirement, and in most cases, that deterioration could be traced to other 
factors, such as an illness. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the couples said retirement had not changed their marriage, said 
Barbara Vinick, an assistant professor of social and behavioral medicine at 
Boston University School of Public Health. Vinick conducted the study with 
David Ekerdt of the University of Kansas Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a popular notion that retirement is going to have sometimes 
dire consequences for marriage. There's the old stereotype of the husband's 
being underfoot and the wife pulling her hair out because of the husband's 
getting in the way," said Vinick, who called the study the most comprehensive 
ever done on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the finding that would be the most important to get out to people is 
that retirement is not a crisis in the lives of people. Life is pretty much a 
continuation after retirement, as it is before retirement," said Vinick, also a 
sociologist at the Veterans Administration Outpatient Clinic in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the research indicated that the best way to predict whether retirement 
will adversely affect a marriage is to look at the marriage before retirement. 
If it is good, then it should be good afterward and vice versa, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our feeling is if a marriage is troubled before retirement it probably will be 
after retirement. The same issues will be there. Similarly, if a marriage has 
been meeting the needs of the partners, it probably will after retirement," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The average age of the men in the study was 62; the women averaged 60. The 
couples had been married for between 15 and 46 years. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers also compared the 92 couples in the study with 125 couples of 
about the same age in which the husband had not retired, and found no 
significant difference in how the the two groups rated their marriages, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Vinick noted that retirement did have some short-term negative effects on both 
the husband and the wife. She stressed, however, that in most cases the 
negative effects only lasted several weeks or months and then the couple 
adjusted. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the women in the study reported feelings of "impingement," that their 
husbands' presence in the house infringed on their privacy and disrupted their 
routines. 
</P>
<P>
"What had previously been a private household realm was now open to scrutiny," 
the researchers wrote in a report to be published in an upcoming issue of the 
journal Generations. "Husbands could overhear telephone conversations. They 
could monitor wives' daily routines. They were just there." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the husbands in the study went through a period the researchers dubbed 
"the second look," in which they often were "dismayed at their wives' humdrum 
routines" and "what they considered the inordinate amount of time spent on 
housework." 
</P>
<P>
But both husbands and wives eventually tended to find they appreciated the 
extra time retirement gave them to spend together, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
"In conclusion, none of the response patterns we have described supports the 
idea of retirement as a crisis in the lives of married couples.

FAMILY TRADITIONS, BANNING OF PILL HELP MAKE ABORTION ACCEPTED PRACTICE IN 
JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Abortion is an accepted birth control practice in Japan. The pill is banned 
because of what officials call uncertainties about its side effects. 
</P>
<P>
"Abortions are protected," said Dr. Kunio Kitamura, director of the Japan 
Family Planning Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Male dominance in Japanese society also comes into play. 
</P>
<P>
"Women tend to leave birth control to the husbands, but with the pill, what 
happens to the role of men?" Kitamura said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese are very conservative people," said Dr. Eikichi Matsuyama, a 
physician at Tokyo's Kosei Nenkin Hospital. "They won't use the pill because 
they think it is dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
A legislative effort in 1982 to tighten the law on who may receive abortions 
was hurriedly withdrawn after strong protests by women and doctors. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would have eliminated a provision allowing abortion on grounds of 
economic hardship, cited in at least 90% of abortion cases, Kitamura said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 1948 Eugenic Protection Law, abortion also is permitted to "prevent 
the increase of inferior descendants from the eugenic point of view," and to 
protect the life and health of the mother. 
</P>
<P>
The real reason for most abortions, Kitamura said, "is the lack of absolutely 
safe contraceptive methods." 
</P>
<P>
He said lack of sex information among teen-agers, who rely on friends and youth 
magazines for such knowledge, also leads to abortions. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a strong family sense of who belongs and who doesn't works against 
having an unwanted baby and then putting it up for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors say birth control is usually achieved through a combination of the 
condom and rhythm method and, as a last resort, abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The Health and Welfare Ministry says Japan had 17.8 registered abortions for 
every 1,000 women 15 to 49 years old in 1985. Many more go unreported, doctors 
say, adding that Japan's abortion rate might well exceed that in the United 
States, which had 24 terminated pregnancies for every 1,000 females of 
child-bearing age that same year. Nations with higher abortion rates are mostly 
Communist countries. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan needs a more reliable contraceptive method. Otherwise, the problem of 
induced abortions cannot be solved," Kitamura said. 
</P>
<P>
The Health and Welfare Ministry is expected to legalize contraceptive pills in 
the near future, but they might not become popular, some doctors suggest. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the pill, including some women's groups, have raised fears of 
possible side effects such as heart attacks and strokes. 
</P>
<P>
"The memory of the thalidomide disaster is still very much in the minds of the 
Japanese people," said Kitamura, referring to the widespread birth defects in 
the late 1950s traced to the tranquilizer. It is estimated that nearly 940 
babies were born deformed in Japan after their mothers took the drug while 
pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
"The memory will never be erased," Kitamura said. "Where contraception is 
concerned, Japan is still a developing country." 
</P>
<P>
As for adoption, "no one wants a child from outside," said Dr. Matsuyama. "They 
want their own." 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult for the adoption concept to catch on here because of the 
Japanese thinking about family and house," Kitamura said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Western nations, where religion often plays a major role against 
abortion, "religion is very weak in Japan," said Matsuyama. 
</P>
<P>
Buddhism and Shintoism, the two main religions, do not take a stand on 
abortion, and "they have no power," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's major anti-abortion group, Seichonoie, combines ideas from Buddhism, 
Shintoism and Christianity in its arguments, however. It was Seichonoie that 
pressed for changes in the abortion law in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, abortion has never carried any social stigma in Japan. Mabiki 
(weeding out), a euphemism for killing unwanted babies, was liberally used in 
ancient times to control population size.

Blue-and-white signs posted beside Oklahoma's highways inform motorists that a 
stretch of asphalt has been adopted by a fraternity, a humane society, a 
motorcycle club. 
</P>
<P>
The signs are part of an effort to involve everyday people in the unending task 
of keeping the roadsides from looking like garbage dumps, and officials say 
that, aside from some concern about safety, the adopt-a-highway idea is 
booming. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Community Competitions 
</P>
<P>
"It's going into beautification and really a pride of communities. . . . Not 
only that, but competition between communities, which adds even more emphasis," 
said Wayne Muri, chief engineer for the Missouri Highway and Transportation 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Nine hundred groups are participating in Missouri, and they have not only 
picked up trash, they have planted millions of daffodil bulbs. 
</P>
<P>
In Oklahoma, which began the program in 1987, Gov. Henry Bellmon joined 20,000 
volunteers April 8 in the state's first highway Trash-Off. In all, 1,000 groups 
have adopted a couple of miles of highway apiece and have their names on the 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Idea Started in Texas 
</P>
<P>
The birthplace of the notion was Texas, which had a problem that was, well, 
Texas-sized. The problem gave rise to a "Don't mess with Texas" celebrity ad 
campaign and the adopt-a-highway program, which now involves more than 3,250 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, more than 20 states have started adopt-a-highway programs. 
</P>
<P>
Texas highway officials, concerned about the state's liability for injuries to 
people picking up trash along the highways, decided on a one-year pilot program 
just around Tyler, but demand for the program mushroomed. 
</P>
<P>
"We bit the bullet and went with it," said Billy Black, a public affairs 
officer for the Texas Highway Department who was a co-developer of the program. 
"We're getting sued for something every day, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Some states, such as South Dakota, are still drawing up safety rules. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been very fortunate," Muri said in Missouri. "The folks out there have 
been very safety conscious." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Videotape Stresses Safety 
</P>
<P>
In Oklahoma, Joanne Orr, beautification director for the Department of 
Transportation, said the state has developed a videotape of instructions: wear 
gloves, clean one side of the road at a time and avoid picking up syringes or 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
The signs cost the highway departments about $35. Groups must pick up litter 
four times a year or their signs come down. Other expenses include trash bags 
and personnel to pick up the bagged litter. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say the expense is well worth it. "Oklahoma has 116,000 acres of 
roadside. That, in effect, is our front yard," Orr said.

DAUGHTERS DRAW LINE OVER ALAMO CONTROL 
</P>

<P>
More than 150 years ago, legend has it, William B. Travis, commander at the 
Alamo, drew a line across the grounds of the old Spanish mission. He asked his 
men to step over it and defend Texas against thousands of Mexican troops. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Daughters of the Republic of Texas, keepers of the Alamo for 84 
years, are emulating Travis' legendary gesture as they battle with legislators 
and Latino leaders who want to wrest control of the historic battle site from 
the 6,000-member group. 
</P>
<P>
Travis lost the battle with Gen. Santa Ana in March, 1836, but Texas troops 
rallied to the cry "Remember the Alamo!" as they continued to fight, later 
winning Texas' independence from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Now, critics of the Daughters of the Republic of Texas say the mission would be 
better run by a state agency accountable to the public, particularly in light 
of an audit that showed the Daughters' Alamo chapter with a budget surplus of 
nearly $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't hiding anything. Our books are open, and we are complying with the 
open records and open meetings laws," said Marjorie Hardy, a chapter 
chairwoman. Tourism officials estimate that chapter members usher close to 10 
million visitors a year through the mission in the heart of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Shifting control to the state, Hardy said, would cost taxpayers because state 
workers would have to be paid for duties that volunteers now perform. As for 
the surplus, she said it is being saved to build a larger theater in the 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very proud of what we have done with the Alamo, but we are not bragging 
about ourselves. Maybe we should," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Daughters are descendants of people who lived in Texas between 
1836 and 1845, when it was an independent republic not yet part of the United 
States. The Daughters received a state charter in 1905 to operate the Alamo. 
</P>
<P>
The complex includes a chapel with artifacts and flags, a souvenir shop and 
research library, a small building where documentary films are shown and 
enclosed grounds with several cannons on display. Admission is free and 
operating expenses are covered by souvenir sales profits. No state money is 
used. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Daughters asked Atty. Gen. Jim Mattox to clarify their legal 
status, and he said the group must comply with the state open-records law 
because it manages a state-owned property. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, state Rep. Ron Wilson has introduced legislation to transfer control 
of the Alamo from the Daughters to the Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife Department, 
which operates state parks and museums. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a historical structure, probably the most historical structure in the 
state, and for the state not to have control or management of it is a little 
absurd," Wilson said. A House committee is to consider the bill later this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jose Garcia de Lara, president of the League of United Latin 
American Citizens, criticizes the way the Alamo has been run. Garcia, who says 
he is descended from Bernardo Gutierrez de Lara, author of the Republic of 
Texas declaration of independence, says the Alamo is a symbol of oppression to 
Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
He said the League and the Daughters should work together to see that Latino 
heroes of the Alamo -- Mexicans who fought alongside the other defenders -- are 
afforded the same respect as Travis, James Bowie and Davy Crockett. 
</P>
<P>
"The DRT has a perception that they own the Alamo because they have managed it 
and handled it in a way that has excluded Hispanics from participating in 
historical activities," de Lara said. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the Daughters, including Mayor Henry Cisneros and state Rep. 
Orlando Garcia of San Antonio, say the group has done an admirable job of 
restoration and of telling the history of Texas accurately. 
</P>
<P>
"They are blood descendants of the heroes of the Alamo," Cisneros said. "No one 
else will treat either the building or the history of the period with the care 
and reverence they bring to the task."

LUXURY LINGERIE FEEDING MANILA'S POOR

Fidela Pizarra thinks she might make enough money to start rebuilding the home 
she lost in a typhoon. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Rodica no longer has to beg in the streets to feed her family. 
</P>
<P>
Their new opportunity comes from Marie de la Soudiere, a Frenchwoman who barks 
orders -- and word of encouragement -- to them in the small, second-story 
office of Thread of Hope for Economic Advancement, or THEA. 
</P>
<P>
They are two of 40 women from impoverished squatter settlements who are making 
nightgowns for boutiques in the United States and a half dozen other places in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
De la Soudiere brought the women together last year. 
</P>
<P>
THEA's goal is to support a decent livelihood for destitute women who cannot 
qualify for government jobs or who "fall through the cracks" of state welfare 
and assistance programs. 
</P>
<P>
It is one of hundreds of cooperatives, most supported by foreign and local 
charity organizations, that employ thousands of Filipinos who otherwise would 
live in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
De la Soudiere, who worked with international relief organizations in Southeast 
Asia for more than a decade, established THEA with $2,000 of her own and $500 
from a friend. 
</P>
<P>
After a year in operation, the cooperative is exporting nightgowns under its 
own label to boutiques in Canada, Japan, France, Hong Kong, Spain and 
Australia, as well as the United States. Plans call for expanding sales to 
Britain and New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
THEA sells the gowns to exporters for the equivalent of $12 to $30 apiece, 
depending on the difficulty of the design. The seamstresses receive $4 to $6 
for each garment they make. That's an improvement over the Philippines' minimum 
daily wage of $3. 
</P>
<P>
Money left over from buying materials and reimbursing de la Soudiere for her 
investment goes into a fund for community projects, such as artesian wells and 
a day-care center for children of cooperative employees. 
</P>
<P>
"With what I am earning here, I can start sending money to my husband in the 
province to buy materials to build our house, which was destroyed by a typhoon 
last year," said the 58-year-old Pizarra. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been sewing, on and off, for 16 years, but could not earn enough. Now I 
have a chance to earn more if I work a little bit harder." 
</P>
<P>
De la Soudiere, who is married to a U. N. official, said many such cooperatives 
fail because they do not produce quality products that fetch high prices in 
foreign markets. 
</P>
<P>
She said many cooperatives also rely too heavily on charity. When donations dry 
up, so do the cooperatives. 
</P>
<P>
"I really want to establish THEA as a very well-made brand of lingerie, like 
Dior," she said. "Why not? Let's dream." 
</P>
<P>
She sets high standards. She lectures cooperative members on the need for 
quality and sound business practices. Garments with loose stitching or poorly 
ironed creases are sent back to be done over. 
</P>
<P>
"It's her way of showing she cares," said Delia Calanno, 41, who supervises 
cutting and sewing. "She is teaching us the value of time and meeting 
deadlines." 
</P>
<P>
"She's a big help to us," added Rodica, 32, a mother of two. "She took me off 
begging in the streets. Now I can buy enough food for my family and medicine 
for my sick husband." 
</P>
<P>
De la Soudiere expects to leave the Philippines in about six months when her 
husband is transferred, but she is optimistic that the cooperative will survive 
under the management of the Filipinos she is training. 
</P>
<P>
She said the hardest part of her work has been to persuade the women that after 
generations of poverty, they can improve their lives through hard work. She 
encourages them to rely on themselves and not the government. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't allow themselves to dream yet," she said. "They cannot imagine that 
they can really get out of the squatter camp, but now they are beginning to 
produce more, so something is happening."

W. GERMAN YOUTH: NO TO MANUAL LABOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

KASSEL, West Germany

<TEXT>
<P>
Call it a reluctance to work on wind-swept rooftops, knead dough at four 
o'clock in the morning or get dirty installing furnaces. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reasons, West Germany is facing a serious shortage of young people 
interested in skilled manual labor. 
</P>
<P>
The situation has become so serious that the federal government in Bonn is 
calling on ethnic German immigrants and women to apply for the jobs. At the 
same time, it is urging some students to look to skilled manual labor instead 
of universities, which are overflowing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long-Range Effects 
</P>
<P>
At a recent manual labor trade fair in Kassel, about 110 miles north of 
Frankfurt, construction worker Friedrick Baum, 64, explained what the 
long-range effects of the trainee shortage might be in his trade. 
</P>
<P>
"Our generation was the one that rebuilt the country after the war," he said. 
"Sometimes when I look back I can't believe what we accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, with many of us getting ready to retire, and not enough apprentices to 
train, we're facing an experience gap that will get worse over the next 10 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Juergen Moellemann has proposed that the government increase 
its annual spending on the training of specialists in labor and technical 
fields by the equivalent of $216 million to $1.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl recently told the Rhineland Palatinate state Labor 
Chamber that it should fill the trainee gap with women or young ethnic German 
immigrants from countries in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"This would not only signal solidarity with our own people and help them," he 
said. "It can be an enrichment to take on these people, who often show an 
especially high motivation for work." 
</P>
<P>
Some old-timers in the country's 126 trades classified as manual labor say West 
German young people today want only white-collar jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Trainees 
</P>
<P>
Federal Labor Office figures for January indicated that 2.3 million West 
Germans were unemployed but that only 92,402 of the jobless were youths or new 
trainee prospects. 
</P>
<P>
With so few prospects, employers say that finding manual labor trainees is 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Helmut Gress, who runs a plumbing and heating company in Koenigstein, about 20 
miles north of Frankfurt, says he has been trying for two years to find an 
apprentice. 
</P>
<P>
"There just doesn't seem to be anyone interested," he said. "I think they see 
the work as too hard and sometimes dirty." 
</P>
<P>
Hannelore Eckes, 50, who with her husband Horst operates a bakery in the same 
town, said their search for a trainee has been fruitless. 
</P>
<P>
"We've tried to find either a young woman or man since the end of the last 
school year. But no one wants to do manual work anymore. Part of it is because 
our day starts at 4 a.m., and we work half-days on Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
At the Kassel trade fair, Guenter Griehs, a 65-year-old retired welder, manned 
a booth advertising for young people to get into the welding business. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like it was when I became an apprentice," he said. "In those days we 
were encouraged and proud to become master tradesmen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Parents, Schools at Fault' 
</P>
<P>
"Parents and schools are partly at fault because they push children to keep 
studying for office work and computers rather than work with their hands." 
</P>
<P>
He said industries, such as auto makers, hire away many young people with 
starting salaries as high as $550 a month, while most apprentices in manual 
trades average $190 to $375 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Karl Weinhold, 57, a senior construction worker at another booth at the fair, 
said the building industry has its own special problems that discourage youth. 
</P>
<P>
"When you move heavy stones around to build houses from age 16 on, by the time 
you're 45 your spine is so worn out you can't walk straight anymore. The young 
know this."

RECYCLE CARDBOARD FROM AUTO ASSEMBLY PLANT; 
</P>
<P>
HONDA WORKERS MAKE CASH FROM TRASH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Five employees of the Honda automobile plant who tackled a $500,000 annual 
waste problem say their biggest obstacle was to persuade management that they 
could do it. 
</P>
<P>
Now, after two years of meeting after hours and between shifts, talking to 
management, finding contractors, contacting fellow workers and working with 
Honda's legal department, the five have put their idea to work. 
</P>
<P>
And they thought it was such a simple thing: Save waste cardboard and sell it. 
</P>
<P>
They had watched for years as cardboard was compacted into trash trucks along 
with Styrofoam, plastic and floor sweepings and taken to a landfill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It Was a Shame' 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of us were talking one day about the tons of cardboard and Styrofoam 
being thrown away every day and we thought it was a shame," said Fred Farley, 
one of the five members of the Waste Watchers NH (New Honda) Circle. They are 
among about 400 workers in Honda's Material Service section that unpack car 
parts and see that they get onto conveyor belts to the assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
One of them wondered aloud if they could sell the trash. Several co-workers 
drank coffee over the idea a few times before forming an NH-Circle, one of 151 
such employee groups involving about 25% of the plant's 4,750 workers. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first started it was a big deal, and management was hesitant," said 
Don Ferguson, a Waste Watchers team member. "They wondered if we could handle 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Research shows that cardboard makes up 55% of the nearly 90 tons of trash that 
leave the auto assembly plant every working day. Nearly all parts for the cars, 
from ashtrays and seats to windshields and trunk lids, arrive in cardboard 
boxes. 
</P>
<P>
A little arithmetic helped the five conclude that the 50 tons of cardboard 
being trashed daily made recycling worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worth $159,000 
</P>
<P>
In the first 13 weeks it was worth $159,000 to Honda in trash sold for 
recycling and savings on the previous cost of having it hauled to a landfill. 
</P>
<P>
From conception to inception was a long, sometimes hard, road for Farley, of 
Bellefontaine; Larry Hannan, Ferguson, Caesar Chilton and Charles Jackson, all 
of Springfield. 
</P>
<P>
Their project was chosen by Honda as a winner among NH-Circles. The payoff was 
a trip to Japan for Farley, Hannan and Ferguson to tell a Honda world 
convention how they made the idea a reality. 
</P>
<P>
The NH-Circle is a throwback to the early industrial era, when employees worked 
out industry problems on the factory floor, and knew that management would 
listen to them. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the associates (Honda talk for employees) become involved, we let them 
run a project from start to finish," said Bill Hayes, assistant 
manager-administration for voluntary involvement programs. "We're strong on 
getting everyone involved." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Additional Manpower 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have any additional manpower to help us," Farley said, "no budget 
for people or equipment." 
</P>
<P>
They talked a Honda subsidiary, Honda International Trading Corp., into buying 
trash-compacting equipment, to be paid for with proceeds from the sale of waste 
cardboard. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten percent of the income is a brokerage fee and 90% is used to pay for the 
equipment," Ferguson said. "When it's paid for, that 90% will come back to our 
department as profit." 
</P>
<P>
Those involved agree that money is the main incentive, because Honda has an 
annual profit-sharing payout to its associates.

CARNEGIE COMMISSION HONORS THOSE WHO RISK THEIR LIVES; 
</P>
<P>
MORE THAN A MEDAL, HEROISM AWARD HELPS PAY BRAVERY'S COSTS

<TEXT>
<P>
When petite Gail Mazzetti Hooks saw two thugs beating a Houston police officer 
and going for his gun, she attacked with uncharacteristic fury -- scratching, 
kicking and punching -- until the two men fled. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought they were going to kill him," said Hooks, who had been watching from 
the restaurant where she worked as a waitress. "He had the prettiest face, but 
he was purple. I kept thinking, 'That could be my brother.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hooks ran after one of the bad guys until reality caught up with her on that 
warm, humid evening of April 20, 1986. Alone and shaking in an alley, she 
abandoned the chase, threw up in the bushes and hurried home to bed. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission proclaimed her a hero, and a 
forever-grateful Officer James Whitley sent her flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Hooks is one of 7,313 adults and children who have been honored by the 
commission since its founding in 1904 by industrialist Andrew Carnegie, who was 
moved by the bravery displayed following a mine explosion near Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cash and a Medal 
</P>
<P>
Carnegie heroes receive $2,500 and a bronze medal on which is inscribed the New 
Testament verse: "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his 
life for his friends." 
</P>
<P>
The self-effacing Hooks, who moved out of Texas shortly after the fracas 
because one of the attackers remained at large, says she is uncomfortable being 
called a hero. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the way I was brought up," said Hooks, now 31 and living in 
Charlotte, N. C. "If you saw someone who needed help, you just helped them. You 
don't think about it, you just do it." 
</P>
<P>
To Whitley, however, Hooks and another waitress who came to his rescue deserve 
the honor. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe they tried to help me like that, when they could have 
easily gotten killed or hurt," said Whitley, 28, who is still on the Houston 
police force. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably wouldn't be here today if not for them." 
</P>
<P>
In establishing the fund, which he endowed with $5 million, Carnegie said he 
wasn't trying to "create heroism . . . knowing well that heroic action is 
impulsive." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Insurance for Courage 
</P>
<P>
He also said he wanted to make sure heroes or their survivors would not "suffer 
pecuniarily" as a result of their deeds. 
</P>
<P>
Paying for pensions, scholarships and funeral expenses "is where Carnegie has 
its real punch," commission spokesman Walter Rutkowski said. 
</P>
<P>
In 85 years, more than 63,000 people have been nominated for heroism awards, 
but just 7,313 of them, or about 11%, were chosen to receive them. 
</P>
<P>
"We are up to our whatever in nominees," said Rutkowski, whose office in 
downtown Pittsburgh is watched over by a somber portrait of Carnegie. "We give 
away as many awards as we have cases that meet our requirements." 
</P>
<P>
Nominees are scrutinized by three investigators before the commission's 
21-member executive committee votes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Just the Facts 
</P>
<P>
Like Sgt. Joe Friday of "Dragnet," the Carnegie investigators want to know just 
the facts. 
</P>
<P>
"In a drowning case, we go for the water temperature, the distance of the swim, 
the current and the rescuer's swimming ability," Rutkowski said. "We don't get 
into a person's psyche. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot get emotionally tied up with these cases. You just don't have the 
capacity to see these cases other than clinically. It's like a doctor in the 
operating room. You don't want him to weep over the pain you're in." 
</P>
<P>
Candidates are excluded from consideration if they are obligated to act because 
of their occupation, such as lifeguard or firefighter. A rescue of a family 
member also is excluded, unless the rescuer was severely injured or killed. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, the saved person must have been in imminent danger of losing his 
life, and the hero must have risked his life in performing the rescue. Also, 
the deed must have taken place in the United States or Canada. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Posthumous Honors, Pensions 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,500 Carnegie heroes, or roughly 21%, died performing their rescues. 
Most of the heroic acts involve drownings or fires. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, perhaps, a nominee can still be chosen for the honor even if the 
life-saving attempt failed. 
</P>
<P>
"It may sound crass, but we're not interested in the victim so much as the 
rescuer," Rutkowski said. "We're not a lifesaving award. We give awards to 
those who risk their own lives to save others." 
</P>
<P>
Carnegie heroes range in age from 8 to 80 and 91% have been males. Most are 
modest people who are hard-pressed to explain what prompted their actions, the 
investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone can truthfully claim to understand why anyone stands by 
or gets involved," said Marlin Ross, a Carnegie investigator since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Acting by Instinct 
</P>
<P>
To Carnegie hero Robert Jameson, a heroic act is done by instinct. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't react immediately, you're going to be overwhelmed by what 
happens. You'll just freeze," said Jameson, 36, of Roebling, N. J., who last 
April saved a woman from a knife-wielding attacker. 
</P>
<P>
"It has nothing to do with bravery," said Andrew Mathieson, 60, of Pittsburgh, 
who was shot three times while defending his secretary, Jane Celender, on Feb. 
19, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"If you ask if I would attack a 210-pound man holding a gun, I would say, 'No, 
not consciously,' but if the circumstances would develop the same way again, I 
would probably do the same thing," he said. "I think the real brave people are 
those who have time to consider what they're going to do and still do it." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ann Anderson, whose father, John, died trying to save a boy from drowning 
in Lake Michigan on July 17, 1987, said she has met several Carnegie heroes and 
all share one trait. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concern for Others 
</P>
<P>
"They all have this fundamental concern for people, that what you do in life 
does matter and affect others," said Anderson, 24, of Baldwin, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone wants to believe the best of them will come out, but no one knows 
what you are going to do in a situation like that. You either panic or you do 
something. It's your inner soul taking over." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's death left not only an emotional void in his family's life but also 
a financial one. His three children were in college at the time, and there was 
little money to pay the bills. 
</P>
<P>
The Carnegie commission stepped in, paid the funeral expenses, set up a monthly 
stipend for Anderson's wife, Louise, and contributed scholarship money. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a blessing," said Louise Anderson, 42, a schoolteacher in Baldwin. 
"There were many bleak times when I didn't know if I was going to be able to 
make the bills." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 105 beneficiaries currently receiving pensions, Evelyn Sponsler of 
Everett, Pa., has been on the books the longest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pension Saved Family 
</P>
<P>
For 58 years she and her disabled daughter have been supported by a Carnegie 
pension awarded when her husband, Clarence, died trying to rescue a man who was 
overcome by fumes when he fell into a gasoline storage tank. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably would have had to live on welfare without it," said Sponsler, 82, 
who had three young children at the time her husband died. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the commission gave out $236,000 in pensions. About $372,000 went 
toward the $2,500 hero awards, funeral expenses and to 20 scholarship 
recipients. 
</P>
<P>
What the hero often does not receive is praise from the person saved, 
commission investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
Jameson said the woman he saved never thanked him, but he can understand why. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a very violent thing that happened to her," he said. "She just wants 
to put it in her past and forget about it." 
</P>
<P>
Jane Celender, 42, the Pittsburgh secretary who owes her life to Mathieson's 
quick actions, said that thanks seemed inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
"How can you say thank you for your life?" she asked.

JAMES KIRKWOOD; CO-WROTE 'CHORUS LINE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BAKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actor, novelist and playwright James Kirkwood, who won a Pulitzer Prize as 
co-author of "A Chorus Line," the longest-running musical in Broadway history, 
died of cancer at his Manhattan apartment, friends said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Kirkwood, 64, died Friday shortly after being released from a hospital stay in 
New York City, said Nicholas Dante, Kirkwood's partner on the famed musical. 
</P>
<P>
"A Chorus Line," presented in the form of a Broadway musical audition in which 
dancers are asked to tell something about themselves, garnered both a Tony 
Award and a Pulitzer Prize in drama in 1976 and became the longest-running 
Broadway show with its 3,389th performance. It is still running. 
</P>
<P>
Although Kirkwood generally said he was born in 1930, he had admitted to being 
born six years earlier. "As an actor, I got in the habit of lying about my 
age," he once explained. 
</P>
<P>
Dante said Kirkwood's death came as a shock "because it was so very quick. He 
will really be missed," Dante said. "He had a great life force and a great 
curiosity about everything." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Hollywood, Kirkwood was the son of actor James Kirkwood Sr. and silent 
picture star Lila Lee. 
</P>
<P>
His youth was spent on the move. By the time he was 17, Kirkwood had attended 
18 schools, including a one-room schoolhouse in Friant, Calif., a Catholic 
military academy, Beverly Hills High School and a New Hampshire prep school, 
which he later depicted in his novel "Good Times/Bad Times." 
</P>
<P>
A boyhood tragedy would eventually produce another novel. 
</P>
<P>
In 1936, when Kirkwood was 12 and living in one of Manhattan Beach's first 
cottages, his mother's boyfriend, Reid Russell, was shot to death on the home's 
garden swing. Young James discovered the body. Authorities never determined 
whether Russell's death was murder or suicide. 
</P>
<P>
In 1960 Kirkwood wrote about Russell's death and the difficulty he and his 
mother had coping with it. The novel, "There Must Be a Pony," was turned into a 
play in 1962 and a television movie in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
As an actor, Kirkwood performed on Broadway in "Welcome Darlings," "Panama 
Hattie" and "Wonderful Town," and had roles in the films "Mommie Dearest" and 
"Oh God, Book II." He also worked the nightclub circuit in a comedy team with 
Lee Goodman. 
</P>
<P>
Actress Tallulah Bankhead, who appeared with Kirkwood in "Welcome Darlings" and 
was entranced by his storytelling, urged him to try his hand at writing. 
</P>
<P>
He subsequently wrote the best-selling novel "P.S. Your Cat Is Dead!" and also 
wrote the novel "Hit Me With a Rainbow" and the nonfiction work "American 
Grotesque," about a conspiracy in the aftermath of President John F. Kennedy's 
assassination. 
</P>
<P>
Kirkwood was a late addition to the creative frustration that produced "A 
Chorus Line." 
</P>
<P>
The play had been conceived by director Michael Bennett, who tape-recorded some 
all-night talk sessions with a group of dancers. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett and Dante edited the tapes and then developed the play in a theater 
workshop. But they were not satisfied and brought in Kirkwood, whose appearance 
marked the beginning of several reworkings. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of sweat and work went into writing it, but we had a really wonderful 
time," Dante said several years ago. "It was the best time in my life and I 
know it was the best time in Jimmy's life too." 
</P>
<P>
Just before his death, Kirkwood wrote a nonfiction book, "Diary of a Mad 
Playwright," about his dealings with actress Mary Martin and Carol Channing in 
a play called "Legends." It was expected to be published by E. P. Dutton in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
Known for his bleak wit, Kirkwood once remarked: "Life has got to be one huge 
joke. To my knowledge, nobody has ever come up with a logical explanation that 
fits any other alternative. But as long as we've been placed on the joke-board, 
there's nothing to do but play along with as much humor as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Kirkwood is survived by a half-brother and a half-sister. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel in Manhattan, where the 
funeral is to be held, said arrangements were pending.

<TEXT>
<P>
A dozen of the 47 sailors killed in an explosion aboard the battleship Iowa 
have undergone pathology exams, and an official said four of them were dressed 
in full military uniform and sent to their hometowns Saturday for burial. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force spokesman Capt. Walter Thorp said Saturday it will take as long as 10 
days to complete the pathology process on the remaining 35 sailors who died 
when gunpowder exploded in the No. 2 turret of the Iowa on Wednesday, as the 
World War II-era battleship was conducting an exercise 200 miles northeast of 
Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
Although autopsies are not conducted at the base as a matter of policy, the 
Navy requested forensics exams for each of the sailors. 
</P>
<P>
As Navy officials continued their inquiry into the explosion, sailors aboard 
the Wisconsin, sister ship to the Iowa, opened their ship Saturday in Norfolk, 
Va., to talk about their pride in battleships and the sense of loss. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sailors Knew Victims 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing on our mind is the tragic loss of many of our ex-shipmates," 
said Capt. Jerry M. Blesch, commander of the Wisconsin. With only four 
battleships in the Navy, many aboard the Iowa once served on the Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Face Same Dangers' 
</P>
<P>
"These are all old ships," said Lt. Matt Schatzle, 25, of Gulfport, Miss., who 
commands the three 16-inch guns of the Wisconsin's turret No. 3. "The crews 
have a connection with all the old sailors who served on the same ships back in 
World War II. . . . They do the same jobs, they face the same dangers." 
</P>
<P>
Norfolk Naval Base prepared to welcome home the Iowa, which is expected to 
arrive at the world's largest naval station this afternoon, and local merchants 
offered free services to families of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Cmdr. Alan Dooley said a team of six investigators was aboard the ship, 
searching for clues to the blast. 
</P>
<P>
He said no cause of death has been announced for any sailors, but the 
Washington Post reported that seamen in the upper chambers of gun turret No. 2 
died instantly in the fiery explosion, whereas those in the lower levels were 
suffocated as the blast siphoned off their oxygen. Dooley refused to comment on 
the newspaper report.

'OCCUPATION' A MISNOMER, SHAMIR SAYS -- 'THIS COUNTRY BELONGS TO US' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has rejected the term occupation to 
describe his country's rule over the West Bank and Gaza Strip, saying that 
Israel is at home there. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, during Shamir's visit to Washington, President Bush said 
that the United States opposes "permanent occupation" of the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip by Israel. The proposal that Israel give up land seized in the 1967 
Six-Day War in return for peace with the Palestinians and neighboring Arab 
nations is a key element in the Bush Administration's Middle East peace 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not occupiers," Shamir asserts. "For us, it is not a foreign land. . . 
. We believe it is our country, and we are people of principles." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Published in Italy 
</P>
<P>
Shamir made these remarks in an interview published Saturday in four Italian 
newspapers. Italy's Prime Minister Ciriaco De Mita is scheduled to begin a 
three-day visit to Israel today to hear Shamir's proposals for Palestinian 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not withdraw from these territories which we believe belong to us," 
Shamir said. "We believe that all this country that is called Palestine -- or 
in the Bible is called the Land of Israel -- this country belongs to us, the 
Jewish people." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would consider withdrawal as the price of Arab peace with Israel, 
he told the Italian journalists: 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely not. You Europeans continue to fail to understand that for us these 
lands are not like Algeria for France or Libya for Italy 40 years ago. (They) 
are an integral part of our territory, and we are not prepared to lose them." 
</P>
<P>
Since his return from the United States on April 14, Shamir has gradually 
refined his plan for elections, which are designed to permit Palestinians to 
elect representatives to engage in peace talks. In Washington, Shamir had said 
that, regarding elections, "Everything is open to negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Topics to Be Limited 
</P>
<P>
However, he told the Italian reporters that Arabs elected from the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip would be prohibited from bringing up topics other than 
arrangements for self-administration under Israeli rule. 
</P>
<P>
"They will know they will have to negotiate only about defined subjects -- 
about an interim arrangement . . . of a kind of a self-rule. The subject of 
negotiation will not be the creation of a Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
"And if somebody of the elected people should try to do other things, we would 
not allow it," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Palestine Liberation Organization will not be permitted to 
participate, Shamir added. Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin declared last week 
that members of the PLO who tried to run would be thrown in jail. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, there is no question about it," Shamir concurred. "If he's a member 
of the PLO, it makes no difference if he is elected or not elected." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir opposes holding talks with the PLO or setting up an independent state in 
the West Bank and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
During the interview, Shamir denied that Bush had set a mid-summer deadline for 
getting the election proposal off the ground. "Shamir is immune from pressure," 
the Israeli leader said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Shamir explained to Israeli politicians that the elections are a 
means of reviving the Camp David formula for a settlement with the 
Palestinians. In line with that formula, the elected Palestinian 
representatives would negotiate terms of extending Israeli rule five years, 
after which a final settlement would be worked out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Nothing New in Proposals' 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing new in the elections proposals, because they exist in the 
Camp David Accords," he told a parliamentary committee on foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's election proposal has met resistance inside Israel from among members 
of his Likud Party. Several rightist politicians have warned that elections 
would be a step toward formation of a Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot accept a political process that will lead to an undesirable end," 
said Economics Minister Yitzhak Modai, a prominent member of Likud. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, some Likud members talk of a "Begin-ization of Shamir," a reference 
to former Prime Minister Menachem Begin, who, in the Camp David agreements with 
Egypt, surrendered the occupied Sinai peninsula after long refusing to consider 
giving it up. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir has sought to ease such concerns. "The government will make sure that 
Israel remains in complete control of developments," he assured the committee 
on foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli leader has yet to reveal details of how or when the vote would be 
carried out. He said the matter has to be discussed by his Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as the PLO, have 
rejected Shamir's plan. Informally, however, they have floated at least two 
counterproposals: that Israel withdraw from the occupied territories in advance 
of elections and that international supervisors oversee the vote.

ARMY BARS ISRAELI LEFTISTS FROM RAIDED VILLAGE

<P>
The army on Saturday barred Israeli leftists carrying black flags of mourning 
from entering the West Bank village of Nahhalin, the site of a bloody raid by 
border police that killed five people. 
</P>
<P>
Also Saturday, officials at Jerusalem's Mukassed Hospital said a Palestinian 
suspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities died Thursday of stab 
wounds. 
</P>
<P>
Arab reports identified the man as Musallam Mahmoud Shaheen, 40, and said 
masked youths broke into his West Bank home and attacked him because they 
suspected him of cooperating with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Another suspected collaborator, a 32-year-old Palestinian woman, was 
hospitalized with broken limbs after being beaten for at least two days by Arab 
militants, the army and Arab reports said. 
</P>
<P>
In the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, 16 Palestinians, including six 
children under the age of 15, were wounded in clashes with troops, Arab 
hospital officials said. An army official confirmed five wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the occupied lands, Palestinians observed a general strike called by 
the pro-PLO leaders of the uprising. 
</P>
<P>
Shops were shuttered and transportation came to a halt. In Gaza, activists 
blocked roads with stones to enforce the strike. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli legislator Yossi Sarid led a convoy of 20 cars draped with black flags 
to Nahhalin, but the group was stopped by troops a mile from the village. Sarid 
said soldiers told him the area was closed to civilians. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can't Block Message 
</P>
<P>
"It's possible to block our entrance, but they can't block our message of total 
opposition to the massacre that happened in the village," Sarid of the 
left-wing Citizens Rights Movement said. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results of an army investigation showed that border police fired 
indiscriminately during their April 13 search-and-arrest raid in the village. 
</P>
<P>
At Mukassed Hospital, 25-year-old Walid Mohammed Najadereh died late Friday of 
head wounds received in the raid, hospital officials said. His death brought 
the death toll in the raid to five. 
</P>
<P>
In the West Bank town of Ramallah, 32-year-old Sabah Kanaan was hospitalized 
with multiple fractures after being held by members of a so-called Palestinian 
strike force, army officials and Arab reporters said. 
</P>
<P>
The militants broke into Kanaan's home in the West Bank city of Nablus on 
Tuesday night and beat her with clubs and sticks because they believed she 
collaborated with Israel, said an Arab reporter, quoting neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"She was shouting, 'I'll stop, I'll stop!' " the reporter quoted the neighbors 
as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said Kanaan was held for three days.

U.N. RESTARTS RELIEF EFFORT IN SOUTHERN SUDAN

A C-130 cargo plane carrying 15 1/2 tons of corn landed in the southern 
Sudanese city of Torit as the United Nations started up relief operations after 
a bloody ambush caused a three-day delay. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Mitchell, a spokesman for the United Nations' Operation Lifeline Sudan, 
said the plane arrived in the beleaguered city Friday from Kampala, Uganda. He 
also said the C-130, leased from and operated by the Miami-based Southern Air 
Transport, will make three flights daily to Torit until it has delivered 1,100 
tons. 
</P>
<P>
The airlift and convoy are part of a massive, $132-million U.N. effort to stock 
more than 110,000 tons of food and supplies in war-torn southern Sudan before 
heavy seasonal rains begin in four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The first U.N. convoy in rebel-held southern Sudan was ambushed Tuesday as it 
traveled west to Torit from the Sudan People's Liberation Army base of Kapoeta. 
Eight rebel escorts were killed and the lead truck was destroyed. U.N. 
officials have not assessed blame, but suspicion fell on government troops.

DEMOLITION DRIVE TARGETS STREET HAWKERS, TOO;

KENYA CLEANUP STRIKES SQUATTERS

<TEXT>
<P>
When the bulldozers came to demolish her shack of cardboard and mud, it was all 
Grace Nduta could do to place a sheet of cellophane over her 8-month-old son 
before fleeing with him into the downpour outside. 
</P>
<P>
She and two other women found a night's refuge in a nearby nuns' residence 
before venturing out again to erect new shacks about 100 yards from the first. 
Then they went back to work, gathering scrap paper to be converted into 
newsprint and toilet paper. 
</P>
<P>
Consider Nduta and the other victims of this city's longstanding war between 
permanence and transience: The scene played out not long ago in the shanty 
village of Kanaro, a collection of huts and paper shacks deep within Nairobi's 
industrial district, has been repeated in dozens of places across town. 
</P>
<P>
Bulldozers have mounted lightning strikes not only on these shanties but on the 
tin-and-wood kiosks of tens of thousands of street hawkers. Around the time 
that Nduta was being evicted, about 4,000 hawkers were marching on City Hall to 
protest a 9 a.m. raid that had demolished dozens of open-air stalls located 
around the city's busiest intercity bus station. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the hawkers noted that they had been fixtures at the bus 
station for 20 years. "We have lost close to a million shillings (about 
$55,000) through these inhuman demolitions of our stands and the confiscation 
of timber, clothes and other merchandise." 
</P>
<P>
Squatters and street hawkers scarcely rank as the fringe of Nairobi's 
population. As many as 45% of the estimated 2 million people here live in 
illegal housing -- that is, homes that are substandard or erected on public 
land. 
</P>
<P>
About 40,000 hawkers ply their trade illicitly in a city where licenses are 
available for only 6,000. So the latest cleanup drive has further menaced the 
already precarious existence of hundreds of thousands of people. 
</P>
<P>
Like all the previous drives, moreover, this one is doomed to fail. Its victims 
are all part of the same phenomenon. Every year, in cities all across Africa -- 
whether Nairobi, or Lusaka, Zambia, or Kinshasa, Zaire -- the city's chimerical 
promise of jobs lures hundreds of thousands of people off the land and into the 
squatter villages. 
</P>
<P>
Kenya simply does not have the money to finance the construction of the 
hundreds of thousands of low-income housing units needed to accommodate its 
squatters. Also, attempts to regulate the hawkers -- providing centralized 
market centers or standardized stalls for them -- have foundered in the face of 
their numbers and unwillingness to subject themselves to the regulatory 
bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
"Again and again, it's the same phenomenon of trying to control that which you 
can't control," said Richard Martin, a housing and development consultant in 
Nairobi with the U.S. Agency for International Development. "Nairobi is a big 
city, and most people don't have the time or ability to go through proper 
channels." 
</P>
<P>
Many end up in a purgatory of unemployment and landlessness. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where I came from," says Lucy Nyoki, 23, who with Nduta found 
brief shelter in the local Roman Catholic residence, cradling her 2-month-old 
son. "But now I'm too old to return." 
</P>
<P>
The remark is as telling in a psychological sense as in a geographical sense, 
notes a Roman Catholic pastor whose church abuts the site of Kanaro, the shanty 
village. "They come here looking for work and stay on even if they find 
nothing," he said. "Meanwhile, back in their villages the family land's been 
sold, or cultivated. Their families have moved on. They couldn't go back even 
if they could find their old village." 
</P>
<P>
Nairobi's demolition drives are recurring events, often erupting when the city 
is putting on a grand event of one sort or another. A U.N. women's conference 
in 1985 and the 1983 annual meeting of the Organization of African Unity both 
brought on large-scale demolition. 
</P>
<P>
The latest sweep coincides with an unprecedented boom in commercial and 
high-grade residential construction in the city. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government has embarked on a cleanliness campaign 
connected with celebrations at the end of last year of the 25th anniversary of 
Kenya's independence and the 10th anniversary of President Daniel Arap Moi's 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal authorities often say they are clearing the land to make room for 
more-substantial housing, but the new structures are invariably too pricey for 
the dispossessed. 
</P>
<P>
"The high-rises that get built simply push these other groups farther out to 
the margin," said Ezra Mbogori, deputy director of the Undugu Society, which 
sponsors educational and shelter programs for slum youth. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, as in many African cities, the line between the temporary and the 
permanent is often a capricious one. Some illegal kiosks are sufficiently 
established to boast telephone service, which is often lacking in the newest 
and grandest office blocks and homes. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, some of Nairobi's largest and grittiest slums have achieved a sort 
of substantiality that belies their origins as agglomerations of mud and paper 
sheds. One of the largest, the Mathare Valley, was the target of repeated 
demolition assaults in the 1970s. In the end, officials gave up, and Mathare 
now supports a population that includes thousands of artisans.

FREER DEBATE, LESS CORRUPTION ASKED BY STUDENTS;

CHINA PROTESTERS SEEK WIDER LIMITS

A young woman copying poems at the Monument to the People's Heroes here the 
other day predicted fervently that a wave of student protests will promote 
democracy rather than provoke a backlash of tighter controls. 
</P>
<P>
"Our country is beginning to become more democratic," said the woman, who gave 
her name only as Zhu. "They cannot reverse course just because people express 
views this way. I don't think it will happen." 
</P>
<P>
A little more than two years ago, when a similar wave of pro-democracy student 
protests swept China, the immediate result was a hard-line ideological 
backlash. But by the end of 1987, more reformist elements within the Communist 
Party had gained the upper hand, and analysts could no longer so easily assert 
that the student protests of late 1986 and early 1987 had backfired. 
</P>
<P>
Most protesters last week -- while generally recognizing that a multi-party 
system and free elections will not come anytime soon to China -- appear to 
believe that their actions can widen the limits of political debate in this 
country, improve the pay and status of intellectuals and promote a fight 
against corruption. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Clear Split 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many Western analysts and journalists -- who often describe the Chinese 
leadership as split between reformist and conservative factions -- the 
demonstrators, like most Chinese, do not clearly divide their rulers into 
opposing groups. Most protesters thus do not fear that they will hurt those 
among the top leaders sympathetic to their cause by providing a pretext for 
action against them. 
</P>
<P>
"We should search for the truth, not Marxism," said a young man named Shi who 
was interviewed amid a crowd of demonstrators Friday. "We should follow 
science, democracy, independence and creativity." 
</P>
<P>
Another student said that most important are two reforms: "Ordinary people's 
views should reach the real decision-makers. And there should be public 
supervision of how policies are carried out. For this, we need press freedom." 
</P>
<P>
A male student named Li recalled how, when the late Chairman Mao Tse-tung 
launched the chaotic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, he labeled intellectuals the 
"stinking ninth category" of class enemies. 
</P>
<P>
This anti-intellectual bias of Chinese communism has yet to be fully reversed, 
Li said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Road of Protest' 
</P>
<P>
"Intellectuals' social status is the lowest. Their income is lowest. They have 
no opportunity to make money in black-market dealings," Li said. "Our leaders 
say the people must not copy Western consumerism. But they themselves ride in 
fancy foreign cars. I think intellectuals have no choice but to depend on their 
own strength and take the road of protest." 
</P>
<P>
The protests began a week ago as memorial activities for Hu Yaobang, who died 
April 15 of a heart attack at 73. Hu, widely viewed as the most liberal of 
China's top leaders, lost his position as head of the Communist Party in 
January, 1987, after being blamed for not suppressing the student 
demonstrations of that winter. He remained a member of the Politburo, however, 
until his death. 
</P>
<P>
While paying homage to Hu is partly a pretext for the demonstrations, there 
also is a strong element of respect and even love felt toward him. Thus the 
demonstrations cannot be considered purely anti-government, and many protesters 
think of themselves as a kind of loyal opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the country to be stronger, more prosperous and more democratic," said 
a woman student named Wang. "We can use this method to put pressure on the 
government to grant the people more freedom. But we oppose chaos. We know that 
with chaos, economic problems cannot be solved." 
</P>
<P>
Not all demonstrators -- numbering 30,000 or more on Friday evening, with tens 
of thousands of additional onlookers -- are so articulate. "It's interesting," 
said one student at a demonstration earlier in the week. "I don't think it will 
do any good. But it's interesting." 
</P>
<P>
Another protester expressed the hope that the demonstrations could make the 
country's leaders "a bit more clear-headed." 
</P>
<P>
This man said he believes that China must have a more democratic system. But at 
the same time, he charged that for most of his fellow demonstrators, "the kind 
of democracy they want is anarchy." 
</P>
<P>
Others standing nearby interrupted to protest that statement. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators share a strong strain of resentment against what is widely 
perceived as the luxurious life style of China's top leaders. Criticism on this 
issue, as well as that of political liberalization, reaches all the way to the 
country's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping. One of the students' demands has 
been that the income and wealth of Communist Party and government officials 
should be made public. 
</P>
<P>
"This should begin with the No. 1 person in China," said the young man named 
Shi. 
</P>
<P>
Protesters also see attempts to separate government functions from control of 
the economy -- which is part of China's current reform efforts -- as essential 
in the fight against corruption. 
</P>
<P>
Resentment against corruption is widespread in China, even as almost everyone 
who gets an opportunity tries to participate in it. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few middle-aged people in a crowd of several thousand protesters 
outside Communist Party and government headquarters Wednesday night praised the 
students as "very great" for being brave enough to demonstrate in this way. 
</P>
<P>
"The officials are corrupt," this man said. "The people are not satisfied with 
them. The people, especially the intellectuals, hate them. Everywhere there is 
corruption, a mess, confusion."

NATION IN TUG-OF-WAR WITH ISLAMIC HERITAGE;

TURKEY RESISTS RISE OF FUNDAMENTALISM

<TEXT>
<P>
Tuncay Gunc, who sells carpets at the Grand Bazaar here, is a thoroughly modern 
Turk. He is a businessman who looks west, and he is a Muslim. 
</P>
<P>
"I pray," Gunc said the other day, "but only on Fridays -- if I don't have a 
customer." 
</P>
<P>
Such religious pragmatism, more the rule than the exception in a Muslim nation 
that is also officially secular, is being challenged in Turkey today by small 
but growing numbers of Muslim fundamentalists, seemingly aided by Iran. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that in major cities throughout the rapidly modernizing country, 
new bouts are being fought in an old tug-of-war between a Middle Eastern 
heritage and official aspirations for a European future. 
</P>
<P>
For midday prayers Friday, the Muslim Sabbath, Gunc shuns the Beyazit Mosque, 
which is nearest his shop. Fundamentalist students from adjoining Istanbul 
University worship there, and of late they have clashed with the police 
following a court decision that forbade the use of traditional Muslim head 
scarfs by female students. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warning to Iran 
</P>
<P>
Last month, after small, countrywide demonstrations against the ban, Turkey 
formally warned Iran against meddling in Turkey's internal affairs. The dispute 
escalated as Turkey recalled its ambassador "for consultations." Foreign 
Ministry Undersecretary Nuzhet Kandemir charged "the state-controlled Iranian 
radio" and Iranian officials with "issuing provocative and inflammatory" 
statements against Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent Friday, a mild and smoggy spring day, prayers at Beyazit were 
uneventful. Lounging riot police officers seemed more interested in the flowing 
tresses and well-cut pants of secularly minded co-eds than in the illegal 
scarfs worn by a dowdy handful of female students making both a religious and a 
political statement. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, although they excite great debate at home and no doubt undercut the 
modern face that Turkey likes to show its Western allies, fundamentalist 
inroads are modest in the republic founded as determinedly secular by Kemal 
Ataturk in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
Binnaz Toprak, an Islamic specialist at Bosporus University here, said: 
"Fundamentalism poses no overt threat to Turkey's secular foundations today, 
but the intelligentsia and the military have always seen Islam as a danger. 
Sometimes it has been overstated, as perhaps it is again." 
</P>
<P>
Still, fundamentalist growth is manifest in Turkey today, and so are the 
alarmed shivers coursing through urban, Western-oriented Turks appalled by the 
results of a decade of religious extremism in next-door Iran. 
</P>
<P>
President Kenan Evren, a former general, has proclaimed fundamentalism a 
greater threat than communism for a North Atlantic Treaty Organization country 
that has a long land frontier with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Oktay Eksi, a columnist at Hurriyet, one of Turkey's largest newspapers, said: 
"The fundamentalists are dangerous. They are training their faithful to replace 
the secular system they oppose with sharia (Islamic law) without any separation 
of church and state." 
</P>
<P>
The current round of concern swirls in the aftermath of national municipal 
elections last month in which the fundamentalist Welfare Party, barred from 
local elections in 1984, won 10% of the vote, up from 7.5% in the general 
elections of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
More telling, in the judgment of Turkish commentators, was the impact of the 
fundamentalist issue on the ruling Motherland Party of Prime Minister Turgut 
Ozal. Motherland, an uneasy coalition of free-market liberals and Muslim 
conservatives, plummeted from 36% of the vote in 1987 to 21.5%. 
</P>
<P>
At the party's head, the 61-year-old Ozal, rotund and dynamic, is the Janus of 
modern Turkey. Ozal is a devout Muslim whose supporters voted in Parliament to 
allow head scarfs at state schools, and who now promises to secure a reversal 
of the court ban against them. 
</P>
<P>
He is also a reformer, who has overhauled a musty state-dominated economy in 
the name of liberal free enterprise, and who has formally applied for Turkish 
membership in the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
"Ozal's head is with the West but his heart is with the fundamentalists," 
columnist Eksi said in a conversation in his office. He and other Turkish 
analysts say Ozal was abandoned at the polls by liberals who reject his links 
with conservative Islam. 
</P>
<P>
Amid opposition calls for a prompt general election, the politically wounded 
Ozal recently named a new and generally more liberal Cabinet, though he 
retained Muslim conservatives in key ministries. 
</P>
<P>
Fundamentalists in the Welfare Party want no part of NATO, and they flatly 
reject Ozal's economic vision. They argue that even if a reluctant Europe could 
be persuaded to accept Turkey as a member of the Common Market, it would never 
be as a full partner. 
</P>
<P>
"Better at the head of an Islamic Common Market than at the bottom of a 
European one," said Bekir Sitki Albayrak, a bearded, 39-year-old architect who 
is deputy leader of the fundamentalist party in Istanbul. "We seek to recover 
the past glories of the days when Turkey was an imperial power." 
</P>
<P>
Creating a republic with a clear church-state separation from the shards of the 
Islamic Ottoman Empire, Ataturk warred on the symbols and the substance of 
state religion. Among other things, he banned the fez, Turkey's traditional 
Muslim hat, and scrapped the Arabic alphabet 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Ataturk, who remains Turkey's paramount national hero, borrowed 
from the Swiss civil code, the Italian penal code and the German commercial 
code to build a new legal system. It is illegal in Turkey today to call for the 
establishment of sharia, but the fundamentalists make no secret of their 
displeasure with the present system. 
</P>
<P>
"Turkey should be governed by a useful law," Albayrak said in an interview at 
his print shop in Istanbul. "Current laws borrowed from other places are not 
useful." 
</P>
<P>
A poll by an academic in Ankara found that 7% of the respondents favored 
restoration of Islamic law, even though saying so is against the law. 
</P>
<P>
What particularly alarms Turks wed to the West is the long-range potential of a 
dramatic increase in state-supported Islamic teacher training schools. In 740 
schools around the country, about 250,000 junior high and high school students 
are being trained to become Muslim imams -- religious leaders -- in a country 
with just 60,000 mosques. 
</P>
<P>
Critics note that only about a third of training school graduates actually 
become Islamic teachers. "In addition," Eksi said, "there are 70,000 youngsters 
living in fundamentalist boarding schools who are being taught that the secular 
state is wrong. The government has failed to control the fundamentalist 
movement." 
</P>
<P>
Eksi's concerns are common to commentators at all nine national secular 
newspapers in Turkey today. They are rebutted daily by three fundamentalist 
newspapers as part of a 60-year debate over the proper role of religion in 
Turkish society, a debate that shows no sign of abating.

DAUGHTER, 3 OTHERS HELD IN KILLING OF MAN

Last Sunday, Deborah Ann Werner, 40, frantically called Orange County sheriff's 
deputies, telling them her 72-year-old father had been murdered in his bed and 
their Mission Viejo home had been ransacked, apparently by burglars. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, however, deputies arrested Werner and three acquaintances on 
suspicion of plotting the murder so she could inherit "several hundred thousand 
dollars," a sheriff's spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, David Werner, a retired stockbroker and businessman, was found with 
a knife in his neck. An autopsy showed that he had been smothered before he had 
been stabbed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suspicions Raised 
</P>
<P>
The disarray in the house immediately raised suspicions that the scene had been 
faked, Sheriff's Lt. Richard Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
"It appeared the scene was made to look like a burglary scene," he said. "There 
was no sign of forced entry and nothing was missing." 
</P>
<P>
Inconsistencies in Deborah Werner's story focused suspicions on her, Olson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Also arrested late Friday and early Saturday were Carrie Mae Chidester, 20, of 
Huntington Beach, Charles L. Clemmons, 20, of Anaheim, and Miguel Ruiz, 21, of 
Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
The four were being held in Orange County Jail on suspicion of murder and 
conspiracy. Bail was set for each at $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Werner reportedly became acquainted with the other suspects through her 
daughter, who is a friend of Chidester. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Open Door 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Werner then allegedly hired Clemmons -- a construction worker who was 
Chidester's boyfriend -- along with Ruiz to kill her father. She left the 
home's sliding glass door unlocked so they could enter the house easily, Olson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After killing David Werner, the two men overturned some chairs and tables in 
the house to simulate a burglary, he said. 
</P>
<P>
All four suspects gathered later that night at a nearby convenience store, and 
a $3,000 check was given as payment for the killing, Olson said. An additional 
$1,000 in cash was promised but never delivered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Olson described Deborah Werner as a bookkeeper who worked as a liquor store 
clerk. Family acquaintances said she was divorced. 
</P>
<P>
After David Werner, a widower, had remarried and then filed for divorce, his 
daughter moved into his house to help him through the ordeal, a friend said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Daughter 'Supportive' 
</P>
<P>
"His daughter was very supportive," said Castas A. Ladikos of Brea, David 
Werner's divorce attorney. "She'd come to court with him. When I spoke to her 
about him, she was very supportive." 
</P>
<P>
Ladikos said she telephoned him after her father was killed, asking whether 
Ladikos would handle her father's will in probate. Ladikos referred her to 
another attorney, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"From what she told me, the will was in thirds. She and her two brothers would 
each get a third," Ladikos said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he would be "real surprised" if the estate amounted to "several hundred 
thousand dollars," as estimated by sheriff's investigators. "I handled his 
divorce. Unless he's got some life insurance, he just didn't have that kind of 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Another attorney who had counseled David Werner during business deals said he 
led a varied life that included work as a cattle rancher, appraiser, oil 
developer and stockbroker.

Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) employed unusual tactics, including a lawsuit, to 
fight attempts by federal auditors to review his 1984 campaign's financial 
records, government documents show. 
</P>
<P>
Gramm, who agreed to end the five-year dispute with the Federal Election 
Commission by paying a $30,000 fine, gave his version of the events last month 
in a move that preempted public release of documents in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Gramm released the settlement to news organizations on Friday night, after the 
FEC had closed and before the settlement was final. 
</P>
<P>
Gramm spokesman Larry Neal said the FEC had made the "final offer and it was 
ours to accept or reject. That was the final action as far as we were 
concerned." 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging errors and blaming them on the inexperience of volunteers, 
Gramm described them as technical reporting violations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Corporate Contributions 
</P>
<P>
Although many of the instances did involve reporting errors, an FEC audit also 
found that the campaign apparently accepted 151 separate contributions from 
corporations totaling $10,890. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate contributions to political campaigns are forbidden under Texas and 
federal laws. 
</P>
<P>
FEC documents in the case also reveal that the Friends of Phil Gramm committee 
fought the agency's investigation of federal campaign violations with tactics 
that included a lawsuit against the commission in U.S. District Court in Dallas 
and its members as individuals. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also questioned subpoenas issued by the FEC to obtain key papers. 
</P>
<P>
In one instance, the campaign committee insisted on a piece-by-piece inventory 
of more than 500,000 committee documents sought by the FEC. 
</P>
<P>
"This procedure would have been more expensive and time-consuming than the 
audit itself," a report by the FEC's general counsel said. 
</P>
<P>
Neal said disputes early in the auditing process were largely caused by "a 
bureaucratic procedure that the general counsel's office attempted to impose." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Challenged Agency 
</P>
<P>
He said the agency at one point sent a letter that simply said: " 'Please send 
half a million documents to Washington immediately. Thank you.' Obviously, we 
felt inventories were appropriate and necessary and challenged them on points 
such as that." 
</P>
<P>
In a written statement accompanying the release of the settlement, campaign 
treasurer Donald R. White said: "The campaign has made a consistent and very 
costly effort over five years to comply fully with the spirit and substance of 
the FEC's regulations." 
</P>
<P>
White said the crush of 70,000 individual contributions totaling $10 million 
"defeated the efforts of our volunteer campaign workers to adequately screen 
and process the incoming mail." 
</P>
<P>
FEC spokesman Scott Moxley described the fine as one of the largest ever in a 
congressional race. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 151 prohibited contributions, 127 appear not to have been refunded 
within 30 days, the FEC counsel's report said. 
</P>
<P>
Auditors said they found one instance in which the campaign committee "made a 
refund of an apparent corporate contribution, and voided this refund check when 
the contributor stated he had intended to write the check from a personal 
account rather than a corporate account."

Freshman state Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy on Saturday surprised political experts 
by declaring his interest in seeking reelection in Rhode Island rather than 
turning his sights on Congress when he reaches the minimum age of 25 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The son of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), who won his Rhode Island House 
seat in an expensive campaign last year, had been widely expected to challenge 
for one of the state's two Republican-held U.S. House seats.

NO OUTCRY FOR HOUSE MEMBERS TO PUNISH SPEAKER; 
</P>
<P>
PUBLIC LITTLE FAZED BY WRIGHT ETHICS CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

CEDAR FALLS, Iowa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Farmers began warily planting corn last week with one eye on the sky in hopes 
of finding dark clouds that will produce soaking rains for the state's rich but 
parched black earth. So far, however, the storm hasn't hit. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is there much of a storm here over House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.). The 
House Ethics Committee, with its report on its investigation of Wright's 
financial affairs, has planted some seeds of doubt, but they have not yet 
sprouted. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't heard a soul talk about Wright," said Keith Koger, acting manager of 
a farm cooperative in nearby Hudson. "I haven't been too worried about it 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Intense Pressure Seen 
</P>
<P>
Soundings here and in other congressional districts across the country indicate 
that Wright's House colleagues are under no intense pressure from home to 
punish the Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
And that is just fine with Rep. Dave R. Nagle, the second-term Democratic 
congressman from this Iowa district, who owes Wright a political debt for 
landing him a choice assignment to the House Agriculture Committee and joining 
him at a fund-raising steak fry in Waterloo last September. 
</P>
<P>
"It's survivable," Nagle said of Wright's plight while visiting here last week 
during the congressional Passover recess. 
</P>
<P>
That may or may not prove to be correct. Many of Nagle's Democratic colleagues 
were stunned by the depth and breadth of the charges brought against Wright 
last week by the Ethics Committee in a report that was the legislative 
equivalent of an indictment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chance to Answer Charges 
</P>
<P>
Wright will have an opportunity to answer the charges -- that he improperly 
accepted $145,000 worth of gifts from a Texas businessman and used sales of a 
book to evade limits on outside income -- before the committee decides whether 
to press ahead against him. 
</P>
<P>
Even Nagle, who was labeled a "Jim Wright Democrat" by his Republican opponent 
last fall, has concluded that Wright acted improperly in selling his book to 
special-interest groups instead of accepting fees from the groups for speeches. 
House rules limit speaking fees but not income from book sales. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he is going to have to give up on the book," Nagle told a Cedar Falls 
business executive. "If he broke the rules with the book and honoraria, he can 
pay it back -- the rules should apply to everybody alike." 
</P>
<P>
But Nagle said Wright may be able to avoid stepping down from his job. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Can't Find the Stampede' 
</P>
<P>
"The word 'allegations' has lost meaning," he said. "The philosophy of the 
public is that if he is accused, he must be guilty. There's clearly a press 
mentality operating to get Jim Wright, since the only time I can get quoted is 
when I say that he's wavering. But, in the House, I can't find the stampede 
against the Speaker that's been reported." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly there is no groundswell in the countryside. The offices of Democratic 
congressmen from coast to coast reported no public pressure to turn against the 
Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
In California, a spokeswoman for Rep. George E. Brown Jr. of Colton said the 
office had received only two phone calls about Wright. The hot topics, she 
said, are hang-gliding as it relates to land use and proposals to ban assault 
rifles in California. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Rep. Jim Moody of Wisconsin said the big issue in his district 
was not Wright but a court ruling that allows Indians to do unlimited spear 
fishing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Mail on Other Issues 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten a lot more mail on the Forest Service plan to close a canoeing 
area in our district than we have on Jim Wright," said Jim Berard, a spokesman 
for Rep. James L. Oberstar of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, in the South, a spokesman for Rep. Stephen L. Neal of North Carolina 
said: "We've had maybe three telephone calls on this, all of them pretty 
critical of the Speaker but nothing more than that. There's been so much talk 
about this in the media, I don't think folks know what to believe." 
</P>
<P>
Wright shows no signs of losing his popularity in his home state of Texas. In 
San Antonio, an aide to Rep. Albert G. Bustamante said the city is consumed by 
its annual two-week Fiesta. "People really want to wait and see on Wright," 
Sylvia Arriola said. "Besides, they're into two weeks of partying now." 
</P>
<P>
Here in Iowa, Nagle has to be particularly concerned about public opinion. He 
is the first Democrat in more than half a century to hold the 3rd District 
congressional seat, and he realizes that he could lose it if he bucked his 
constituents on the emotional Wright case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Voted for Nagle 
</P>
<P>
Paul Schoeman, a well-to-do farmer from New Hartford, is one voter he could 
lose. Chatting over coffee at Ingalls' Little House cafe, Schoeman said Nagle 
was the first Democrat he ever voted for in his life. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, Schoeman gibed at "Ft. Worthless," his name for Wright based on 
his hometown in Texas. "We're glad Nagle's defending him -- that will croak him 
(Nagle)," Schoeman said. "How would you like to defend Jim Wright?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Book Questioned 
</P>
<P>
Even James Saul, a Democrat and United Auto Workers member, acknowledged: 
"Wright's in pretty bad trouble. It sounds like he's pulled some shenanigans, 
especially that book he sold." 
</P>
<P>
Keith David, another regular at the Little House cafe who owns a car wash and a 
beauty shop in New Hartford, interjected: "If he got caught, he ought to be 
out." 
</P>
<P>
But for every voter who criticized Wright, there seemed to be another to 
express a lack of concern. A retired Navy man, Mike Shimp, said he was tired of 
personal attacks on public officials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Press Blows It Up' 
</P>
<P>
"Personal things are nit-picked," Shimp complained. "The press gets hold of it 
and blows it up. If a man's trying to do his job, I don't think they ought to 
rake him over the coals." 
</P>
<P>
And at Verdie's cafe in Waterloo, a machinery salesman paused from gnawing on 
barbecued beef ribs when he was asked if he felt Wright had done anything 
wrong. "They all do something wrong," he said, returning to the ribs. 
</P>
<P>
Another man chimed in: "I feel if Wright has been there 25 or 30 years, he 
can't be all bad." 
</P>
<P>
It may be bad news for Wright -- and for Nagle -- that the Speaker seems to be 
regarded more skeptically by Iowa's elite. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Lasting Damage 
</P>
<P>
When Nagle visited the Viking Pump Co. in Cedar Falls, Jack Johns, the 
company's president, questioned him closely about Wright's predicament. Nagle 
assured him that Wright would suffer no lasting damage because his Democratic 
supporters in the House would stand behind him. But Johns was not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's in deep trouble," Johns told a reporter. "The Republicans have a 
no-lose situation. He has to resign or, if he stays on the job, his credibility 
will be questioned and he won't be as effective. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Wright may be able to convince the congressmen of his innocence," Johns said. 
"But not the constituents of the congressmen."

More than 50 people have been arrested after violence sparked by high prices 
erupted at a rural market, the Algerian news agency APS reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
APS said shoppers went on a rampage, wrecking stalls, trampling produce, 
smashing utensils and damaging cars at the small farming town of Aflou, 200 
miles southwest of Algiers. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first report of violence since food prices in Algeria doubled or 
even tripled in the last two weeks. Shoppers have boycotted meat and vegetable 
sellers in Algiers and other towns like Oran and Tizi Ouzou. Consumer groups 
have threatened to stage a nationwide boycott. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said drought has decimated livestock and forced prices up. It blamed 
higher prices combined with what it called tragic unemployment for the Aflou 
outburst.

Three men were arrested on suspicion of trying to sell $100-million worth of 
fake art masterpieces by claiming the bogus Picassos and Rembrandts were 
purchased cheaply from an Arab sheik, the FBI said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The three were arrested after agents posing as art patrons negotiated to buy 
paintings from an inventory of fakes that also included purported works by 
Gauguin, Van Gogh, Degas, Renoir, Rubens and Chagall, said Chuck Latting, FBI 
supervising agent in San Francisco.

The men, Anthony Barreiro, Ernest Ray Parker Jr. and Jeff Jones, were taken 
into custody Friday at the home they share and were being held in the San

CONTROVERSY OFTEN FOLLOWS FAR EAST BANK CHIEF HWANG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Henry Hwang filed papers in Sacramento last month declaring his intent to 
run for California lieutenant governor in 1990, the flamboyant Republican 
banker was counting on quickly raising $1 million in political contributions 
and using his name recognition in the Asian community to bolster his first try 
for public office. 
</P>
<P>
Soliciting large sums of money would pose no problem for Hwang, the wealthy 
61-year-old founder and chairman of Far East National Bank who was thrust into 
the news recently because of his bank's association with Los Angeles Mayor Tom 
Bradley. But Hwang (pronounced Wong) did not anticipate that his candidacy 
would generate little excitement among a number of influential Chinatown 
business leaders and fellow Chinese bankers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surprise Political Bid 
</P>
<P>
"We were all shocked when he made that announcement," said one respected 
Chinese businessman, who like several others agreed to discuss Hwang's 
candidacy only on condition of anonymity. "He came to my office and asked for 
my support. I couldn't be very enthusiastic. I won't." 
</P>
<P>
Hwang's political aspirations were dealt another setback last month when it was 
widely reported that he employed Bradley last year as a paid special adviser at 
a time when Far East held more than $1.5 million in city deposits. Bradley 
returned the money last month. But the mayor, whose financial ties with private 
industry are under investigation by the city attorney, has partly blamed the 
extensive pre-election publicity surrounding his relationship with Far East for 
the narrow margin of his mayoral victory on April 11. He won reelection to a 
fifth term with 52% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Now Hwang, a longtime Bradley acquaintance and political supporter, has put his 
own campaign for lieutenant governor on hold and appears ready to drop out of 
the race as suddenly and mysteriously as he jumped in. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not the Right Year' 
</P>
<P>
"My understanding is that he is not interested in running for anything," said 
political consultant Ron Smith, who said he recently met with Hwang on six 
occasions to plot campaign strategy. "I think he took a look at what it would 
take to successfully run, and I think he decided this was not the right year 
for him." 
</P>
<P>
Until questions surfaced about business dealings between the mayor and Far 
East, Hwang had kept a relatively low profile as a leading Republican Party 
supporter in Los Angeles and a highly successful banker. But, according to 
public records and interviews with business associates, Hwang often has found 
himself in the middle of controversy since he opened his bank in 1974 on the 
edge of Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
Hwang, an accountant, reportedly wooed a successful female executive to help 
obtain his bank charter, then dismissed her shortly after Far East began 
operations. Hwang then fired two presidents within 18 months. In 1976, Hwang 
gave $300,000 of bank funds to a robber who kidnaped him and forced him to 
drink a substance that rendered him incoherent, he told police. And, with 
Bradley's help, Hwang pushed city officials in 1982 to award his bank a 
long-term lease at $9,000 per month under market rates. The City Council voted 
against the lease. 
</P>
<P>
Hwang has refused repeatedly over the last month to be interviewed about his 
political aspirations or his relationship with the mayor. He also declined to 
be interviewed for this story. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Yuan Hwang was born in Shanghai and attended Taiwan University. At 21, he 
came to the United States in 1948 as the Communists were preparing to overtake 
his native city. He attended USC as a business student between 1951 and 1956, 
but did not graduate, according to university records. While a student, Hwang 
met his wife, Dorothy, an accomplished pianist who teaches music at USC, 
friends said. 
</P>
<P>
The Hwangs have a son, David Henry, the playwright who last year became the 
first Asian-American to win a Tony Award for his Broadway play, "M. Butterfly," 
and two daughters -- Mimi, a professional cellist with the Franciscan String 
Quartet and Grace, an Alhambra elementary school teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Described by acquaintances as an outgoing, flashy entrepreneur who relishes the 
limelight and boasts of wearing $1,500 suits, Hwang drives a 1989 BMW 750 with 
personalized license plates "FENB" for Far East National Bank. His wife drives 
a 1986 Mercedes-Benz with license plates "MRS FENB." They live in Pasadena in a 
sprawling 4,700-square-foot home valued at about $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Success Story 
</P>
<P>
According to friends, Henry Hwang never tires of telling business associates 
and acquaintances how much he appreciates the opportunity to immigrate to the 
United States and become a successful businessman. His license plate frame says 
"I love USA" and his bank's current annual report is entitled "Fulfilling the 
American Dream." 
</P>
<P>
"Today, we thank our national America -- the land of freedom and opportunity 
for all. Let us not take her for granted," the annual report says. "More 
emphasis should be given to the red, white and blue without which we will be on 
a sunken ship." 
</P>
<P>
To further these ideals, Hwang decided to run for lieutenant governor. 
</P>
<P>
"Here he came to the United States without a penny, he has been successful and 
he thinks it is because of the American economic system," said Smith, the 
political consultant. "He wanted to give some of it back by serving in public 
office. I was a little skeptical when I first heard that. But I talked to him, 
went to his home, met his wife and family and I really came to believe that was 
absolutely his only purpose." 
</P>
<P>
While many Asian-Americans in California welcomed Hwang's candidacy, several 
prominent Chinese business leaders in Los Angeles who knew Hwang were less 
enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
They said that Hwang suddenly began soliciting political and financial support 
from members of Chinese business clubs whose memberships and meetings he had 
ignored for years. Hwang serves in many volunteer organizations, including the 
Greater Los Angeles Boy Scouts, Los Angeles Beautiful and the Claremont 
University Center Board of Fellows, but few are devoted exclusively to the 
Asian community. For example, Far East is the only local Chinese bank that did 
not support the 12th World Chinese Banking Amity Conference in Los Angeles last 
August and one of few that does not belong to the National Assn. of Chinese 
American Bankers, banking sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we have a unique situation and there is a special need for us to use 
our talents to help the Chinese community and help small businesses," said one 
Chinese business executive. "In certain ways, Henry has ostracized his 
colleagues." 
</P>
<P>
Hwang started in business by becoming a certified public accountant and opening 
a firm that catered to the growing Asian community in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1970s, Hwang became interested in opening a bank to better serve 
the growing Chinese community in Los Angeles. But Hwang had difficulty 
obtaining a California charter because state banking authorities believed that 
Chinatown had too many financial institutions, said Gerry Findley, dean of 
California banking consultants who joined Hwang to organize Far East. 
</P>
<P>
Findley said he and Hwang applied for a national bank charter and lobbied 
regulators by arguing that Far East would have a woman, Rosa Leong, as its 
chairman in a male-dominated field and that it would specialize in serving 
Mandarin-speaking customers. Hwang and Leong speak Mandarin. 
</P>
<P>
Within months of obtaining the charter, Hwang dismissed Leong and the bank 
never specialized in serving the Mandarin-speaking community, said Findley and 
other banking sources. Leong, who owns Wilshire Center Bank, confirmed the 
details of her dismissal, but declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'At an Angle' 
</P>
<P>
"I felt (Hwang) took unfair advantage of her," Findley said. "I've always said 
that, in my opinion, Henry is aggressive. He comes at you not straight on, but 
at an angle." 
</P>
<P>
Hwang in an interview for a story in The Times several years ago characterized 
Findley's role in the beginning phases of Far East as "unethical." 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, banking regulators and police investigators began looking into Hwang's 
role as a victim in the kidnap case he reported. 
</P>
<P>
Hwang told police that a man accosted him in his accounting office in El Sereno 
and took him at gunpoint to a hotel, where the man forced him to drink a 
substance from a glass that left him confused. Hwang said the man then forced 
him to call a bank cashier at Far East and tell him to get $300,000 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
The cashier reported handing the money to Hwang in the lobby of a downtown 
hotel, police said at the time. Hwang later told investigators at police 
headquarters that he could not recall giving the money to his abductor or 
anything else about the incident. The bank confirmed the cash was missing. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman said the episode remains 
as much a mystery today as it was 13 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The case was never solved," said Officer Don Laurence. "No suspect was ever 
identified, no suspect was located, and no suspect was interviewed." 
</P>
<P>
By the time of that incident, Hwang had developed a reputation in banking 
circles as a maverick. He had fired two presidents -- both professional bankers 
-- within two years of opening Far East. 
</P>
<P>
Asked at the time why he fired the presidents, Hwang said: "They were bankers. 
Isn't that enough? I don't like bankers. They tend to be snobby, and they're 
always playing games -- like bureaucrats." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Turned Bank Around 
</P>
<P>
Hwang was appointed president in April, 1976, and within two months Far East 
was operating in the black for the first time since the bank opened in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Hwang accomplished this turnaround by slashing expenses and offering exclusive 
services to his customers. At a time when "bankers' hours" meant short work 
days, Hwang kept Far East open on evenings and Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
"Henry doesn't become successful by imitating other people," said Glenn Yee, 
president of Eastern Savings in Alhambra and a former top executive at Far 
East. "He is an entrepreneur. Henry always believed in looking for a better way 
to serve the customer and in the same process make some money." 
</P>
<P>
Far East, which began in 1974 with deposits of $4.6 million, reported total 
earning assets of $176 million last year. It is one of several minority-owned 
banks that hold city deposits, in keeping with city policy. 
</P>
<P>
Hwang has become increasingly active in supporting candidates for political 
office while his bank has solicited deposits from local and federal 
governments, according to banking sources. 
</P>
<P>
Records show that Hwang has contributed generously to the campaigns of several 
politicians, including at least $16,000 to Mayor Bradley since 1980. With 
Bradley's help, Hwang tried unsuccessfully to secure a long-term property lease 
from the city in 1982 at favorable rates. 
</P>
<P>
For the first eight years, Far East paid between $220 and $440 per month -- 
amounts that were determined inadequate by a city attorney report -- for 
city-owned land in Chinatown at Sunset Boulevard and North Broadway. In 1982, 
Far East and the city's General Services Administration drafted an agreement 
for a 30-year lease at $3,500 a month, despite a Public Works Department 
appraisal that the fair market rent was $12,500. 
</P>
<P>
Records show that Bradley lobbied the City Council to approve the lower rent. 
The mayor wrote the council that he believed "the terms which have been 
negotiated are reasonable." But the proposal failed to win council approval. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time Bradley pushed the Far East proposal, the City Redevelopment 
Agency began depositing tax revenues from its Chinatown redevelopment project 
into Far East. The deposits gradually increased to $840,000 in 1986 and were at 
$525,000 a year ago when Bradley became the bank's paid special adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Bradley announced that he had returned $18,000 in advisory fees to 
Far East when he learned the city treasurer's office had put investments of $1 
million in the bank. The deposit was doubled to $2 million in March when 
Bradley -- after fielding a call from Hwang -- contacted the city treasurer and 
discussed the city's investment policy. Bradley said he called the treasurer to 
inquire whether the city had a relationship with Far East and not to pressure 
the city treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has said that he was unaware of both city deposits because he was 
assured by bank officials that Far East had no city business last year when he 
agreed to serve as a paid adviser.

PIG'S DEFENDERS TRYING TO BRING HOME THE BACON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Living on the sunny Palos Verdes Peninsula can be wonderful, unless you're a 
homeless pig named Grunt. 
</P>
<P>
Grunt was abandoned about three months ago, and since then residents, animal 
rights advocates and animal control officials have been unable to find him a 
new sty to call home. If he is not adopted from the Los Angeles County Animal 
Control Shelter in Carson within two weeks, Grunt may be put to death, shelter 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with finding someone to adopt Grunt is that most people are put off 
by his size. 
</P>
<P>
The porker is about five feet long, four feet tall and from 800 to 1,000 
pounds. One person who cared for Grunt compared him to a Volkswagen Bug. 
</P>
<P>
"They are cute when they're small, but they get big," said Leslie Mitchell, 
district supervisor for the Carson shelter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family Moved 
</P>
<P>
Grunt's sad tale began in a spacious home in Rolling Hills Estates, a 
semi-rural, well-to-do community on the peninsula where a family raised him 
from the time he was a piglet. 
</P>
<P>
In January, the family prepared to move away and decided it would be too 
difficult to take the portly pig along, Mitchell said. And the family's 
attempts to find him a new home were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Jerye Mooney, a representative of the Fund for Animals, a national animal 
rights group, said neighbors told her that the family finally turned Grunt over 
to its gardener for slaughtering. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neighbors Heard Squeals 
</P>
<P>
The neighbors saved Grunt. When the gardener and some friends tried to kill him 
in the back yard of the family's home by stabbing him in the neck, the pig's 
squeals caught their attention and they quickly called the sheriff's station in 
Lomita, Mooney said. 
</P>
<P>
As deputies rushed to the scene, the gardener and his associates fled. 
</P>
<P>
The rescuing deputies contacted animal control officials, who took Grunt to the 
Carson shelter, said Levonne Rodstein, a volunteer there. 
</P>
<P>
Grunt stayed at the shelter until March, when Dee Keese, a 4-H volunteer, 
offered to care for him and find him a new home. Keese took Grunt to her 
one-acre ranch in an unincorporated area near Rolling Hills Estates, where she 
keeps goats, horses, possums and llamas. 
</P>
<P>
Keese said she tried for more than a month to find Grunt a new home. She called 
such animal rights groups as Friends of Animals and Last Chance for Animals, 
but after seeing Grunt they all declined to take him. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though these people were nice to pigs, it was just too big," Keese said. 
"It's sad but I'm trying to keep a sense of humor about it." 
</P>
<P>
Grunt met with some more bad luck when one of Keese's neighbors complained to 
animal control officials that he might be dangerous to children if he ever 
broke out of his corral. In fact, Keese said, Grunt is tame and likes people. 
"I have pictures of my fourth-grader riding on his back," she said. But after 
looking into the complaint, shelter officials realized that his temperament was 
not the issue. It turned out that county zoning laws prohibit pigs in the area. 
</P>
<P>
So, last Thursday Grunt was loaded into a trailer and taken back to Carson. 
"Right now he's just kicking back at the shelter," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
Grunt, who is believed to be no more than 3 years old, gets along well with the 
dozen or so chickens and ducks that share his corral, his keepers said. The 
brown-and-black swine prefers slop over hay. His favorite food is a runny 
mixture of leftovers and dog food. 
</P>
<P>
When he is not eating, Grunt is usually lying in a mud hole in the corner of 
the corral. 
</P>
<P>
Grunt's admirers haven't given up their efforts to help him, but they realize 
that time is running out. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd just like to find it a home where it won't be turned into bacon," Mooney 
said.

CHRISTIAN STILL FEELS 'VINDICATED' DESPITE AWARD CUT IN HUDSON CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marc Christian said Saturday that despite a Superior Court judge's decision to 
reduce the award in his suit against Rock Hudson's estate to $5.5 million, he 
still feels "vindicated" by the award. 
</P>
<P>
A jury had awarded Christian, Hudson's former lover, $21.75 million in punitive 
and compensatory damages against Hudson's estate and Mark Miller, the late 
actor's personal secretary, deciding that Christian suffered extreme emotional 
distress after learning that Hudson had hidden the fact that he had AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Judge Bruce R. Geernaert reduced the award of compensatory damages 
from $14.5 million to $5 million, and the punitive damages from $7.25 million 
to $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased," Christian said Saturday. "The punitive award would have 
been nice if it stayed at $1 million. But I think the judge did us a big favor 
because it reduced the other side's causes for appeal." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the five-week trial in February, Christian said he brought the 
suit because people have a duty to tell their sexual partners that they have 
AIDS.

MOORPARK STUDENT WINS THE STATE'S FIRST CITIZEN BEE 
</P>

California's first Citizen Bee, matching 33 high school finalists in 
competition covering American history, geography, economics, politics, culture 
and current events, was won Saturday by an 11th grader from Ventura County -- 
on his 17th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanus Philip of Moorpark, a student at Chaminade College Preparatory, a 
private Roman Catholic school in the San Fernando Valley community of West 
Hills, was declared the state winner in the 27th round in head-on competition 
with Margaret Kuo, 17, of San Clemente High School. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanus, Margaret and third-place winner Ken Kuniyuki, an 11th grader from 
Torrance High School, now advance to national competition on June 17 in 
Washington, where they will face 73 other contestants from 28 states. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret, a 12th grader who was born in Taipei but has lived in the United 
States since she was 1 year old, is the first girl to reach the national finals 
in four years of Citizen Bee competition. Stephanus was declared the winner 
after he had correctly answered two questions in a row after a miss by 
Margaret. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to identify the name commonly given to laws passed by Southern 
legislatures after the Civil War to keep blacks from voting and to identify one 
such measure, Stephanus replied, "Black codes and literacy tests." He then 
correctly identified the Northeast as the region that lost the most seats in 
the House of Representatives after the 1980 census. 
</P>
<P>
The first five winners in Saturday's competition, patterned after a spelling 
bee, received cash awards. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Cardenas, a Garfield High senior, placed fifth and collected $250. David 
Lee, an 11th grader from Diamond Bar High School, won $500 for fourth. Ken 
Kuniyuki received $750 for third, and Stephanus Philip and Margaret Kuo each 
received $1,000.

Japanese news media reported that Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita received a 
$378,000 loan in 1987 from the company at the center of a growing bribery 
scandal. Takeshita, who heads the governing Liberal Democratic Party, received 
the loan from Recruit Co. and repaid it several months later, Kyodo News 
Service and the Japan Broadcasting Corp. said. Takeshita did not mention the 
loan when he told a Parliament panel April 11 that he had received more than $1 
million in political donations from Recruit between 1985 and 1987. Recruit, an 
information services company, is suspected of using political donations to gain 
favors.

Corporate watchdog Ralph Nader said in San Jose that the growing destruction of 
Earth's protective ozone layer is tantamount to "silent violence" by high-tech 
companies that continue to release ozone-attacking chemicals. Nader, speaking 
on the eve of the international "Earth Day '89," cited a report by Citizens for 
a Better Environment describing IBM's San Jose facility, which released 1.4 
million pounds of a chlorofluorocarbon into the atmosphere in 1987, as the 
world's worst offender.

Congress may be asked to bail out numerous corporations that will be forced 
into bankruptcy in the next recession because of excessive debt, the chairman 
of the Senate Finance Committee said. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) said a study 
that shows a dramatic increase in the amount of high-risk "junk bond" debt 
since 1980 makes him worry about the possibility of a taxpayer bailout similar 
to the multibillion-dollar rescue of the nation's troubled savings and loan 
institutions. Bentsen said the Library of Congress study "tells us that the 
amount of corporate debt is going through the roof and that the quality of 
corporate debt is going through the floor."

A former Zimbabwe government minister who ingested poison last week after being 
implicated in a corruption scandal died and will be buried at a shrine for 
revolutionary heroes today, officials said. Maurice Nyagumbo, 64, resigned as 
senior minister for political affairs last weekend after a presidential inquiry 
implicated him in black-market car deals. Nyagumbo died at Harare's main 
hospital Thursday night. Despite the scandal, officials said that Zimbabwe 
President Robert Mugabe declared Nyagumbo a national hero.

Solidarity leader Lech Walesa predicted that the newly legalized labor movement 
will dwindle as it gives rise to splinter groups during the growing political 
pluralism in Poland. Speaking at a Rome news conference at the end of a 
three-day visit to Italy, he also praised President Bush's proposed aid for 
Poland and voiced his support for economic reforms in the Soviet Union. "From 
Solidarity, other economic and political organizations will be born," said 
Walesa, a strong proponent of pluralism. "Solidarity for the moment is huge, 
but it will become smaller with the growth of other organizations."

A LAST HURRAH; 
</P>
<P>
FOR ABDUL-JABBAR, A SEASON OF FAREWELLS WILL BE CAPPED TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Philosopher Soren Kierkegaard 
</P>
<P>
Not known as a sentimentalist, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has mostly acted the part of 
courteous house guest while being treated as a visiting dignitary during a 
six-month farewell tour that has visited every sector of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Protocol has been strictly observed. Gifts have been given the retiring Laker 
center, platitudes exchanged, applause graciously accepted and, once in a 
while, emotions revealed. Except for truly touching moments in New York, his 
hometown, and Milwaukee, where he began his professional career, the tour has 
all been so nice and polite, so businesslike and structured. But Abdul-Jabbar 
is home now. The 24 tour stops are behind him. This afternoon, Abdul-Jabbar 
will play his final regular-season game in the National Basketball Assn. when 
the Lakers meet the Seattle SuperSonics at the Forum. Game time is 12:30, but 
the ceremony honoring Abdul-Jabbar will begin at 11:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe today, in a familiar and friendly setting, in front of fans who always 
have embraced him, Abdul-Jabbar will reveal some of his previously undisplayed 
feelings. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers have not announced details of today's ceremony. This being Los 
Angeles, though, it certainly figures to be a spectacle. But just Abdul-Jabbar 
and microphone at midcourt no doubt would be emotional and memorable. 
</P>
<P>
Will his goggles get misty? 
</P>
<P>
Will he be able make it through a speech that has taken him 20 seasons to 
write? 
</P>
<P>
Or will he, as usual, keep his emotions to himself? Abdul-Jabbar, quite 
naturally, said he does not know how he will react. It is not something he 
wants to predict or predetermine, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's going to be a tough one," Abdul-Jabbar said, evenly, when questioned 
about his farewell stop on the farewell tour. "Very tough. Probably, it will 
(be emotional). I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of (the acceptance speeches) have been extemporaneous. A few things come 
into my mind before I get up to speak, things I can relate to the city. But (in 
Los Angeles), I don't know. I'll probably write a few things down, just to 
remember people to thank." 
</P>
<P>
Teammate and friend Magic Johnson, however, said he will have a tough time 
controlling his emotions. He said he cannot imagine what Abdul-Jabbar's 
feelings will be. 
</P>
<P>
"These people know him and really, truly are saying goodby and thank you from 
their hearts," Johnson said. "Everybody else did it from their hearts, too, but 
our fans know Kareem. It's going to be powerful and emotional." 
</P>
<P>
This, of course, will not be his last game. The playoffs start this week and, 
when Abdul-Jabbar actually does play his final professional game -- as soon as 
early May or as late as June 20 -- it will be secondary to the Lakers' quest 
for a third consecutive championship. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's the best course of events that I'd be comfortable with," 
Abdul-Jabbar said. "That's what this whole season is all about, trying to play 
for the world championship. My last year is secondary." 
</P>
<P>
A player of Abdul-Jabbar's caliber, the NBA's all-time leading scorer and 
considered by some as its greatest player ever, should not be allowed to slip 
into retirement unnoticed. That was the motivation behind the farewell tour, 
proposed by the NBA office last summer and gladly accepted by Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
Several themes have emerged in Abdul-Jabbar's 20th, and final, season. But, 
essentially, the tour has fostered a better understanding between a 7-foot-2 
enigma and a public that seemingly had been puzzling to Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar has been quoted nationwide more in the last year than perhaps in 
his previous career, spanning from Power Memorial High School in New York to 
UCLA to the NBA. Most certainly, he has never heard as many cheers and so few 
heckles. 
</P>
<P>
And, rather than consider it a chore, Abdul-Jabbar said he viewed the tour as 
an opportunity to communicate. And, as a result, he will leave without rancor 
and even with a measure of affection for the fans. 
</P>
<P>
"My opinion (of the public) really hasn't changed that much from recent years," 
Abdul-Jabbar said. "There was just no vehicle by which I could express it 
before. I was expecting problems (on the tour). I didn't think I'd have enough 
time to do it. But it was always at a convenient time, and it hasn't been a 
disruption to the team." 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, Abdul-Jabbar also has acquired enough gifts to exceed a 
game-show host's wildest dreams, enough special moments and encounters to fill 
a book. Which, by the way, Abdul-Jabbar is writing. 
</P>
<P>
He has been kissed by singer Whitney Houston and the ubiquitous Morganna, 
serenaded by saxophonist Grover Washington Jr. and lauded by such diverse 
dignitaries as Julius Erving, Red Auerbach and Jesse Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
He has been given enough jazz compact discs to stock a record store, enough 
portraits of himself to have his own showing on New York's East side, two 
different modes of transportation -- a motorcycle and a sailboat -- and a wide 
assortment of knickknacks. The farewell tour, however, did hit a few obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
There was Abdul-Jabbar's poor play early in the season, during which two 
prominent Los Angeles columnists called for his early retirement. Abdul-Jabbar 
blamed it on poor off-season conditioning and an early-season knee injury, and 
it almost prompted Coach Pat Riley to bench a legend. 
</P>
<P>
There was the controversy over whether it was the right decision to add 
Abdul-Jabbar to the All-Star game when Magic Johnson suffered a torn hamstring. 
At about that same time, Denver Coach Doug Moe called Abdul-Jabbar a jerk and 
questioned the purpose of a farewell tour in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
There also was Abdul-Jabbar's conviction on two misdemeanor charges of assault 
stemming from a shoving incident at a Phoenix shopping mall a year ago. On 
sentencing day, half a dozen mini-cams taped Abdul-Jabbar's procession to and 
from the courtroom. "I don't think any of those things affected it," 
Abdul-Jabbar said when asked to sum up his season. "I didn't expect things to 
go without any bumps in the road. That's the way this game is." 
</P>
<P>
The game, nearly all observers agree, will not be the same without him. 
</P>
<P>
That is why, for the last six months, he has been honored from Charlotte to 
Seattle, Boston to Phoenix, all leading to this afternoon's ceremony in 
Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE LONG GOODBY 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe this will be the last time we shake hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe this will be the last time we make plans. 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever happens, Thank you from the bottom of my heart. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Abdul-Jabbar, quoting James Brown to fans at Madison Square Garden 
</P>
<P>
To Abdul-Jabbar, it sometimes must seem that the farewell tour has been the 
closest thing to being at his own funeral, what with the praise from close 
friends and admirers. Retirement, after all, has been called the little death 
that awaits all athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Viewed a different way, though, this also could be Abdul-Jabbar's graduation to 
the outside world after 33 years of organized basketball. Thus, the farewell 
tour has been his valediction. 
</P>
<P>
The routine has gone like this: 
</P>
<P>
The ceremonies have taken place either before the game's start or at halftime. 
A microphone has been put at midcourt, along with the gifts and the lineup of 
well-wishers. Newspaper photographers and television cameramen have formed a 
half-circle around the make-shift stage. Abdul-Jabbar either has waited with 
his Laker teammates until the kind words have been spoken and he has been 
summoned, or he has joined the master of ceremonies at the start. 
</P>
<P>
The requisite, yet not contrived, standing ovation usually has lasted about a 
minute, with Abdul-Jabbar shyly bobbing his bald head and giving an open-handed 
-- fingers spread out, thumb tucked in -- acknowledgement to the crowd. Then, 
it is Abdul-Jabbar's turn to speak. 
</P>
<P>
His speeches have had a distinct pattern. Abdul-Jabbar almost always has 
thanked the host city for its support of the NBA and helping it grow into a 
major sport. In sites where he has been particularly dominant figure, such as 
New York, Boston and Philadelphia, Abdul-Jabbar invariably has referred to 
himself as "the villain." In Utah, he used the cartoon variation, Snidely 
Whiplash. 
</P>
<P>
He has creatively found a way to personalize each stop. It is easier to 
excavate memories in some cities than others. In two cases, expansion cities 
Charlotte and Miami, there were no memories to relive. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Abdul-Jabbar's referances are obscure and date him. Some are stretches. 
But many are rare glimpses into Abdul-Jabbar's thoughts and feelings. 
</P>
<P>
A few of the highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 -- New York, Abdul-Jabbar's hometown, was the scene of the most emotional 
ceremony. Abdul-Jabbar's parents, Al and Cora Alcindor, were present, as were 
many friends and influences from Abdul-Jabbar's childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Philadelphia's 22-minute ceremony featured a nine-minute sax solo by 
Washington, who fittingly chose to play Duke Ellington's "In A Sentimental 
Mood." Julius Erving, a close friend of Abdul-Jabbar, served as master of 
ceremonies and called Abdul-Jabbar "the greatest player in NBA history." 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar thanked the fans by quoting Ellington: "I love you madly." 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Milwaukee, a photograph for eternity: Abdul-Jabbar astride a champagne 
gold motorcycle built at the Harley-Davidson plant there and presented to him 
after a sentimental look back on his tenure as a Buck. He sat there for a few 
moments, giving the OK sign to fan. Asked at every tour stop to name his 
favorite gift, Abdul-Jabbar would smile and unhesitatingly say, "It's hard to 
beat the Harley. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I had a Harley for a couple of years when I lived in Milwaukee, but 
when I went to L.A., I had to get rid of it. I was afraid I'd get killed riding 
it on the freeways." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The villain angle was never more apt than in Boston, where Abdul-Jabbar has 
been lustily booed over the years. Red Auerbach served as emcee and actually 
was civil to Abdul-Jabbar, whom Auerbach had criticized in one Boston paper 
that morning. 
</P>
<P>
"How can I get mad at him now?" Auerbach asked the crowd before presenting 
Abdul-Jabbar a mounted slab of the Boston Garden's parquet court. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar, who said the Lakers' championship victory in Boston in 1985 is 
his most memorable achievement, credited Auerbach and Bill Russell for his 
development as a player. "I didn't know anything about this game," Abdul-Jabbar 
told the crowd. "I used to watch the team wearing green and a guy on the team 
wearing No. 6. He taught me how to play the game. And they had a guy who smoked 
cigars. And I never would have learned how to play the game had it not been for 
the Celtic teams of the '50s and '60s." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Utah went with the Western theme. The Jazz gave Abdul-Jabbar an 1886 
commemorative Winchester rifle, custom-made rattlesnake boots, a rattlesnake 
belt with the state seal on the silver buckle, a leather jacket and made him an 
honorary deputy sheriff of Salt Lake County. 
</P>
<P>
A month later in Phoenix, he was sentenced for his misdemeanor convictions the 
morning after his tour stop at the Veterans Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing the fans, Abdul-Jabbar looked around at his gifts and said: "I was 
told there would be another gift here, a get-out-of-jail-free card." 
</P>
<P>
 -- A look of genuine surprise crossed Abdul-Jabbar's face during the Golden 
State Warriors' ceremony, when he was presented with a 24-foot sailboat, which 
was lowered from the ceiling. It was christened, Cap's Sky Hook. 
</P>
<P>
The most frequent gifts were jazz records. Abdul-Jabbar was literally given 
wheelbarrows full of CDs. It got to the point that Lorin Pullman, 
Abdul-Jabbar's personal publicist, discouraged teams from further supplementing 
his overflowing collection. "After about the seventh city with CDs, I did 
discourage it," she said. "Only because I think he has every CD in jazz ever 
made to this point. . . . But we'd never look a gift horse in the mouth, so to 
speak." 
</P>
<P>
A gift horse is about the only thing Abdul-Jabbar has not received. 
</P>
<P>
Gifts have appealed to Abdul-Jabbar as both the athlete and the aesthete. They 
have ranged from an African sculpture of an elephant -- the symbol of dignity, 
longevity and strength -- appraised at $10,000, to a portable telephone, to the 
obligatory rocking chair. He also has received golf clubs and a fishing rod 
with 10,000 hooks. As pastimes, golf and fishing rank with cleaning the rain 
gutters at Abdul-Jabbar's Bel-Air home. He graciously accepted them, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar, through corporate sponsorship by L.A. Gear, has donated $1,000 in 
each city to a charity of the host team's choice. 
</P>
<P>
But, what has Abdul-Jabbar done with all the gifts? 
</P>
<P>
"I've asked them to be shipped to our offices," Pullman said. "Or, if they are 
too big, they go to the Forum (and then) to Kareem's house. 
</P>
<P>
"The Harley is still at the dealership in L.A. The boat is in L.A., but it'll 
go to Kareem's place in Hawaii. I don't know how it'll get there, exactly." 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar says the gifts are not what he remembers most, though. 
</P>
<P>
"The gifts have been great," he said. "The appreciation has been great. That's 
really what it's all about. I really wasn't into getting all the gifts and 
stuff like that. That really wasn't the emphasis. I think sharing the moment 
with the fans and being able to share their appreciation one time. And I think 
I've gotten my message across." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MUCH TO DECLARE 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it's all right, Even if you're old and gray. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it's all right, You've still got something to say. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Traveling Wilburys 
</P>
<P>
By Abdul-Jabbar's admission, his humanization began in 1983 with the 
publication of his autobiography, "Giant Steps." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Abdul-Jabbar has opened up a bit. He has been candid and mostly 
cooperative during news conferences in every NBA city. 
</P>
<P>
Although sometimes he heads directly from the airport to a news conference at a 
hotel without even dropping his suitcase, Abdul-Jabbar answers questions 
thoughtfully, if not always enthusiastically. 
</P>
<P>
He has shared opinions on such diverse subjects as: 
</P>
<P>
 -- His public perception: "People resented me. I don't know why, but people 
have their ways. I was never what you'd call a popular person because of the 
fact I became a Muslim and I believed in black pride, and people seemed to 
think I had a chip on my shoulder. I didn't, but sometimes what you think is 
there can be a very formidable thing. I guess it soured my relationship with 
the press and made it very easy for them to attach any significance to what I 
was doing on the court." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On retiring with dignity: "I remember being in New York and watching Willie 
Mays at the end of his career, playing for the Mets. He wasn't playing well, 
and it made me feel bad, because I idolized him." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On the media: "I don't see strangers as attackers any longer, don't feel 
they're out to tear down what I've accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On living in Milwaukee: "I remember there was a window facing north in my 
apartment. I came home one night and pulled the curtains, and that window was 
just a solid sheet of ice. I said to myself, 'Oh, my goodness.' " 
</P>
<P>
 -- On agreeing to a farewell tour: "Five years ago, I couldn't have imagined 
doing this. I wasn't ready for it." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On playing with Oscar Robertson and Magic Johnson: "I was able to play with 
three of the top five playmakers in NBA history. Oscar, Guy Rodgers and Magic. 
I try to think of a good analogy for that -- like if you had a talent for 
electronics and got a chance to work with Thomas Edison. That's the way I 
feel." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On reminders of his age: "Coach Don Chaney (of the Houston Rockets) is a 
good friend of mine. His kids, I remember 12 years ago when he was with the 
Lakers. Now, one's in college. My friend Greg Smith (a former teammate with the 
Bucks), his son is the starting guard for Cal. And I'm still playing in the 
NBA." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On his most cherished memory as a professional: "Winning the world 
championship in Boston in 1985. That we were able to go up there and beat them 
in the Boston Garden was very special. 
</P>
<P>
"The Lakers had a long history of them kicking sand in our faces, dating back 
to the '50s. We'd won world championships, but we'd never beaten them. And we'd 
been characterized as a bunch of West Coast pansy-types playing sissy kind of 
basketball. . . . Winning that one, and being a key ingredient in doing that, 
being able to raise our hands underneath all those banners, that's something 
I'll always remember." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On how he would like to be remembered: "I hope they remember my consistency 
and the high level I played at. . . . I think people can now understand me and 
what I'm about. They can see I'm more or less a regular person." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE MEDIA MARRIAGE 
</P>
<P>
 It was a marriage composed of spats, mutual disappointments, and, toward the 
end, a mellowing hoard of shared memories. It fell into three stages, which may 
be termed Youth, Maturity, and Age; Thesis, Antithesis, and Synthesis; or 
Jason, Achilles, and Nestor. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Author John Updike on Ted Williams' last game 
</P>
<P>
Ted Williams, a baseball player Abdul-Jabbar followed while growing up, never 
made his peace with the media. In fact, in his farewell appearance at Fenway 
Park on Sept. 28, 1960, Williams began his speech by pointing to the press box 
and saying, "In spite of all the terrible things that have been said about me 
by the knights of the keyboard up there . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Had Abdul-Jabbar retired five years ago, he might have given a similar speech, 
providing he agreed to speak at all. He has battled long and fiercely with 
sportswriters and, in his book, questioned their intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, though, he has built a trust. Now, his relationship can be described 
as cordially professional. As Billie Jean King once said, "If you stay around 
long enough, they'll start to like you." 
</P>
<P>
Well, judging from the press clippings of the farewell tour, Abdul-Jabbar still 
is drawing mixed reviews. His talent and longevity have been duly recognized, 
his new openness praised. 
</P>
<P>
But many columnists seemingly cannot forget his years as a sullen public 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
After Abdul-Jabbar had played his last regular-season game against the 76ers, 
columnist Bill Conlin wrote in the Philadelphia Daily News: 
</P>
<P>
"Abdul-Jabbar is making one of those magical mystery tours that have become 
obligatory in sports when a legend comes limping down the homestretch. It is 
good business, I suppose, but isn't there something a tad hypocritical about 
giving a night to one of the guys we loved to hate above all others for two 
decades? 
</P>
<P>
"Grover Washington Jr. . . . saluted Abdul-Jabbar with a silky arrangement of 
"In A Sentimental Mood." "Mood Indigo" might have been a better summary of 
Kareem, however." 
</P>
<P>
Conlin was not alone. 
</P>
<P>
This from Buck Harvey of the San Antonio Light: 
</P>
<P>
"There is a big lie being told about the Big Fella, and it's that we are 
misty-eyed because he's hanging up his goggles. . . . Ask most fans, and they 
wouldn't pitch in to buy him a going-away stick of gum. . . . He's been cordial 
on the farewell tour, but that doesn't make up for two decades of being 
America's tallest, coldest fish. He summed up everything wrong about the NBA in 
the 1970s. He was too good, too big, too indifferent." 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, though, Abdul-Jabbar has won over reporters, who have dutifully paid 
tribute to his achievements and place in the game's history as well as noting 
his change in attitude. 
</P>
<P>
From Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post: 
</P>
<P>
"Kareem's personality has changed, too. For so much of his career, the brief 
eye contact he granted the public was remote and disdainful. He seems gentler, 
more approachable, even friendly. . . . Vulnerability is the only way a great 
center can be liked -- let alone loved." 
</P>
<P>
From Bill Lyon of the Philadelphia Inquirer: "Depending on your view, he is a 
relic, an anachronism, an institution, too lazy, too slow, too bored, too tall, 
too much. What he is, without question, is a certified geriatric marvel. . . . 
He has elevated those around him to a higher plane." 
</P>
<P>
So it seems that Abdul-Jabbar and the writers have reached a truce. 
</P>
<P>
Or, at least, some have. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

TOUR STOP 18A 
</P>
<P>
 I make my living off the evening news. 
</P>
<P>
 Just give me something, something I can use. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don Henley 
</P>
<P>
They lugged their mini-cams and microphones, note pads and zoom lenses, down 
the courthouse steps and through a well-lighted corridor in search of Room 17, 
Municipal Judge John L. Wiehn presiding. 
</P>
<P>
It was just before 8 on a Wednesday morning in late March, and every media 
outlet in Phoenix, plus a three-member crew from "Entertainment Tonight" and 
several reporters from Los Angeles, had gathered at the Phoenix Municipal Court 
for the sentencing phase of a trial that had drawn much attention in preceding 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
This was not a controversial decision on a heinous crime. It was the People vs. 
Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the month, the defendant had been convicted on two misdemeanor 
charges stemming from an altercation with an Italian tourist last April at a 
Phoenix shopping mall. The man, Fernando Nicolia, had been taping 
Abdul-Jabbar's movements with a home video camera when the Laker center knocked 
it away. The man suffered a scratched ear, and the video camera had been 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Because Abdul-Jabbar is who he is, and because the night before he had been 
honored by the Phoenix Suns as part of his farewell tour, this was a media 
event, a photo opportunity not to be missed. 
</P>
<P>
There were three entrances to Room 17, which would be closed to photographers 
and the mini-cams, but not to reporters, during the sentencing. So, to ensure 
maximum exposure of Abdul-Jabbar, who had not been present during the trial, 
all sectors were covered and any sightings were to be relayed. It apparently 
was an unspoken professional courtesy. 
</P>
<P>
One TV cameraman was standing on a chair awaiting Abdul-Jabbar's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm on the floor, he's so tall, I have to shoot upward and all I'd get 
would be his nostrils," the cameraman explained. "I don't want the nostril 
shot." 
</P>
<P>
Just before 8:30, when Abdul-Jabbar was scheduled to appear, the elevator doors 
opened. Lights from the mini-cams and flashes from cameras illuminated not 
Abdul-Jabbar and attorney but a court clerk carrying a file under her arm. 
</P>
<P>
When Abdul-Jabbar and entourage finally appeared, it was through a side door, 
not the elevator. At the first sighting, the shouts echoed through the hall, 
reminiscent of a scene from "The Front Page." 
</P>
<P>
Flanked by attorneys and escorted by two policemen, Abdul-Jabbar appeared in a 
dark blue suit with matching sunglasses. The cameras followed his every move. 
At one point, a backpedaling cameraman knocked over a metal trash can. 
Abdul-Jabbar briefly turned to see what the commotion was about. 
</P>
<P>
Once inside, Abdul-Jabbar removed his sunglasses. He rose when told to, 
answered a few questions from Judge Wiehn with one-word acknowledgements and 
approached the bench to sign a document after sentence was imposed. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar was fined $500 and told to pay $834.35 in restitution for the 
damaged camera. It was over in six minutes, less time than the farewell 
ceremony had taken at the Veterans Coliseum the previous evening. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar's exit from the courtroom to a waiting limousine was similar to 
his entrance. Only this time, reporters shouted requests for comments from 
Abdul-Jabbar, who ignored them. 
</P>
<P>
Making sure Abdul-Jabbar was seated in the limousine, attorney Leonard Armato 
spoke with the reporters. After a few minutes, the crowd had dispersed. 
</P>
<P>
Said one local reporter, "I guess it wouldn't have been a good time to ask for 
his autograph." 
</P>
<P>
Asked three weeks later about the courthouse scene, Abdul-Jabbar softly said, 
"There's nothing you can do about that." 
</P>
<P>
THE AFTER-LIFE 
</P>
<P>
If you make it to age 35 and your job still involves wearing a name tag, you've 
probably made a serious vocational error. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Comedian Dennis Miller 
</P>
<P>
In the blink of an eye, Abdul-Jabbar will be out of our lives. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, he still will be somewhat visible endorsing a shoe company. But, in terms 
of public viewing, his last playoff game this season probably will be the last 
time he will be seen for a while. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar has often talked about stretching out on a beach chair at his home 
in Hawaii with a tall, cool drink and an engrossing book, soaking in the sun 
and the restorative power of solitude. 
</P>
<P>
It figures to be a time for both reflection on his just-completed career and 
planning for the future. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar is vague about his plans. 
</P>
<P>
He said he wants to resume his fledgling acting career -- "I'd like to star in 
a movie with Meryl Streep; she is a fantastic actress," Abdul-Jabbar said -- 
and attempt to produce projects. He said he would like to do a film adaptation 
of "Bloods: An Oral History of the Vietnam War by Black Veterans." 
</P>
<P>
A book chronicling his final season, written with Mignon McCarthy, is scheduled 
to be published by Random House in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
And, Abdul-Jabbar said, he plans to work in public service to promote literacy 
among youth, and also wants to spend more time with his children. 
</P>
<P>
A career on the periphery of basketball apparently does not interest him at 
all. He said we won't -- for a while, at least -- see him coaching, in the 
broadcast booth and, definitely, not in old-timers' games. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar's lawsuit against Tom Collins, the former agent who Abdul-Jabbar 
claims bilked him out of most of his assets, still is pending but 
Abdul-Jabbar's advisers say he is solvent. Nancy Sarnoff, who handles 
Abdul-Jabbar's endorsements and marketing, said he has as many endorsements as, 
if not more than, most athletes. Plus, he earned $3 million from the Lakers 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
So, Abdul-Jabbar apparently will not be forced to exploit his fame to support 
himself, something he detests. 
</P>
<P>
"I've played organized basketball since I was in fourth grade," Abdul-Jabbar 
said. "That's 34 years. I think I've had enough competition. 
</P>
<P>
"It's possible that I might change my mind and want to be involved with the 
game again. Maybe after eight months or something, I might feel I have to be 
around it. That's what people tell me. I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
"I can say without hesitation that I have done everything I wanted to. I think 
I have had enough success to last me a couple of lifetimes, and I am thankful 
for that." 
</P>

BAD NEWS FOR KINGS: FLAMES TOO GOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Well, we've got bad news and we've got bad news. The Kings got beat. And they 
looked bad doing it. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, the Not Ready for Prime Ticket players did stage a comeback Saturday night, 
after two terrible periods of hockey, before succumbing to the Calgary Flames, 
5-2, in Game 3 of their all-over-but-the-shouting Smythe Division playoff 
series. 
</P>
<P>
There will be another game played here Monday night, and we suppose you could 
ask the old Al Michaels hockey question: "Do you believe in miracles?" We would 
like to think that the Kings think they still have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
Face it, though, friends. It's time to wait till next year. Calgary is just too 
good, and that's just too bad for Los Angeles. It doesn't mean that the Kings 
haven't done their best. It just means that their best just isn't good enough. 
</P>
<P>
"They're on Death Row," Calgary Coach Terry Crisp said. "They've got nothing 
left to lose. 
</P>
<P>
"The Kings will probably throw everything they've got at us Monday, but I don't 
know what more there is for them to try. They've tried to muscle us. They've 
tried to finesse us. (Wayne) Gretzky has logged 50 minutes a night. (Bernie) 
Nicholls has, too. What else can they do that they haven't done?" 
</P>
<P>
All you have to do is watch the Kings on a power play, dumping the puck into 
the Flames' end instead of carrying it in, because whenever anybody in an L.A. 
uniform approaches the blue line, some Flame is right in his face. There were 
several times Saturday when Calgary could have played an entire period 
short-handed and probably done all right. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing as how the Flames haven't lost four games in a row all season, we choose 
not to believe in miracles. But we thank the Kings for a nice try and are 
prepared to eat a puck if they come back and win this thing. 
</P>
<P>
In their 90th game of the season, the Kings tried to emphasize why they changed 
their colors to black and silver. They came out playing like the Raiders. Steve 
Duchesne decked Joe Mullen, Dean Kennedy sent Brian MacLellan into the glass 
and Ken Baumgartner put down Lanny McDonald, all in the first few minutes. They 
might as well have worn skulls and crossbones on their helmets. 
</P>
<P>
Then, late in the first period, Baumgartner came charging at Mullen like a 
runaway rhino. Picking on somebody nowhere near his own size, Baumgartner used 
his three-inch, 25-pound advantage to flatten Mullen with folded forearms, 
thrusting them into Mullen's jaw. Calgary's All-Star right wing -- who scored 
14 goals in eight games against the Kings this season -- had to be helped to 
the dressing room and was not quick to return. 
</P>
<P>
"It was definitely an elbow. You can see that in the replay," Mullen said 
later. 
</P>
<P>
A deliberate attempt to injure him? 
</P>
<P>
"You seen it," Mullen said. 
</P>
<P>
By this time, though, the Flames already were in front by two goals, the only 
goals of the first two relatively uneventful periods. Calgary's relentless 
defense kept the Kings looking as though they had forgotten to carry their 
sticks from the bench. Los Angeles got off only one shot in the last 13 minutes 
of the first period, and only seven shots in 33 minutes as the second period 
came to an end. 
</P>
<P>
They needed some help. 
</P>
<P>
They needed some luck. 
</P>
<P>
They needed somebody to do something. 
</P>
<P>
They needed divine intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 Paging Mr. Gretzky . . . paging Mr. Gretzky . . . please call your office. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally getting into the act, after a quiet couple of periods, the Great 
Western Gretzky helped put his team back in the ballgame, as it were. He made a 
snazzy pass to Tom Laidlaw, putting it right on his stick, and the King 
defenseman knew what to do with it. He might not have scored a goal from Jan. 
24 to April 9, but Laidlaw slipped the puck past Mike Vernon 47 seconds into 
the final period. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings were alive, if not well. A slapshot here, a tip-in there, any sort of 
score would bring them even. The breaks had not been going their way -- Bernie 
Nicholls hit the left post midway through the second period, and the puck slid 
right under the Calgary goalie, who was flat on his back -- but maybe, just 
maybe, their luck would change. 
</P>
<P>
It did. It got worse. 
</P>
<P>
Clank. A shot by John Tonelli off the post. Clank. A shot by Gretzky off the 
post. For close to 15 minutes of the third period, the Kings could not have 
played much better or tried much harder. Kelly Hrudey made one good save after 
another. All Los Angeles needed was to light that lamp. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Gilmour did it instead. He gave Calgary a 3-1 lead. Things looked bad. 
Then Steve Kasper answered for the Kings, scrambling and scratching in front of 
the net, poking it in, making it 3-2. There was still time. 
</P>
<P>
Time for Gilmour again. 
</P>
<P>
This guy has been a pain in L.A.'s side all series long. He missed much of the 
end of the regular season with an abscessed jaw, but you would never know it by 
the way he is playing now. Artist Gilmour made two pretty goals when they 
counted most, beating Hrudey with a nice move that made the score 4-2, and shot 
an arrow through the Kings' hearts. 
</P>
<P>
Mullen, of all people, sent the fans to the Forum exits. He got even with 
Baumgartner in the best way possible, scoring to make it 5-2, to put the game 
in the bag, and probably put Los Angeles down and out near Beverly Hills.

CALGARY TAKES 3-0 SERIES LEAD WITH 5-2 VICTORY 
</P>

<P>
After the way the Kings lost the third game of their best-of-seven Smythe 
Division playoff series Saturday night, getting bounced around to the tune that 
the Calgary Flames were calling, and finally losing, 5-2, to go down three 
games to none, there is not much reason to believe that they will make a 
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
To continue this first season of the Wayne Gretzky era, the Kings would have to 
win four straight, and two of those games would be played in Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the Kings came back and won three straight to beat the Edmonton Oilers in 
the last series. But this is different. 
</P>
<P>
A deserted locker room told the story of just how down the Kings were feeling 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky made a brief appearance, and while he didn't proclaim the Kings dead, 
he wasn't making any promises, either. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Calgary Coach Terry Crisp was playing it as cautiously as his team 
plays it on the ice. Crisp said: "There's still no comfort zone. The fourth 
game is the toughest one to win, and we've got our hands full trying to get 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Crisp reminded everyone that the Kings led the league in offense -- it was easy 
to forget that Saturday night -- and that they were coming off an emotional 
series against Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
The sellout crowd of 16,005 welcomed the Kings back with rousing ovations that 
started to swell as Warren Wiebe sang the final lines of "America the 
Beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
Seemingly undaunted by the fact that the Kings had dropped the first two games 
of the series at Calgary, the Los Angeles crowd was ready to roar. 
</P>
<P>
But their enthusiasm was soon squelched. 
</P>
<P>
It was a very subdued crowd that watched the Kings leave the ice after the 
first period, trailing, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
As King defenseman Ken Baumgartner noted: "The fans were waiting for any kind 
of spark, and we couldn't give it to them." 
</P>
<P>
There were some big moments for the Kings, but they were few. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Laidlaw fired a pass from Gretzky past Flame goalie Mike Vernon just 47 
seconds into the third period to pull the Kings within 2-1. And there were some 
exciting moments -- when Bernie Nicholls hit the post in the second period 
while it was 2-0, when Gretzky bounced a shot off the post on a breakaway and 
when John Tonelli bounced a shot off the post while the Kings were still within 
a goal in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the league's highest-scoring team has to take solace in shots that only 
come close. 
</P>
<P>
While the Kings were still looking for a scrap of good news, thinking that they 
might just rally, Doug Gilmour, who scored the Game 1 winner in overtime and 
got two early goals in the Game 2 blowout, scored the first of his two goals, 
threading a shot between King Jay Miller and Flame Lanny McDonald, who were 
screening King goalie Kelly Hrudey. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Coach Robbie Ftorek of the Kings went back to the ploy that he 
had used at the end of Game 3, going with four forwards and just one defenseman 
-- and it worked, for a while, as center Steve Kasper scored after center 
Nicholls had sent a pass to the front of the net for a shot by right wing Dave 
Taylor and the rebound goal by Kasper. 
</P>
<P>
The only other Kings on the ice at the time were left wing Luc Robitaille and 
high-scoring defenseman Steve Duchesne. 
</P>
<P>
That same line was on the ice, though, when Gilmour scored his second goal, 
breaking in on Hrudey at 16:27. 
</P>
<P>
Ftorek went back to two defensemen after the Gilmour goal, and Mullen scored at 
17:50 to make it 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
Then, for more than a minute during the final, desperate moments of the game, 
as the Kings tried to make up three goals, Ftorek pulled Hrudey and attacked 
with five forwards and Duchesne. 
</P>
<P>
Until the final seconds, that is, when he went after the Flames with tough guys 
Baumgartner, Marty McSorley and Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, frustration led to fisticuffs. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Jim Peplinski, who had riled McSorley in the opening minutes by 
ripping his stick out of his hands and tossing it aside, had just put McSorley 
on his hands and knees and then on the bench with a high stick to the face 
when, unencumbered, he picked up a rebound and swooped behind the Kings' net, 
from where he sent out the centering pass to defenseman Jamie Macoun for the 
goal that put the Flames ahead, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
Flame center Joel Otto made it 2-0 when he skated around King defenseman Jim 
Wiemer and banked a shot off the right post and over Hrudey, who had spread 
himself across the mouth of the goal as best he could. That was the fourth shot 
of the game for Mullen, who matched the Kings' total shots in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
Baumgartner made sure that Mullen didn't get another shot soon by clipping him 
on the chin and sending him to the dressing room with 3:25 to play in the 
period. Mullen didn't return until late in the third period, just in time to 
score the Flames' final goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings took just one shot in the final 13 minutes of the first period, and 
then only six shots in the second period. For the entire game, they had just 23 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings were not playing in the middle of the ice by choice. The Flames 
insisted that the game be played there as they employed an annoying game of 
bump and heckle. 
</P>
<P>
But the Kings solved that with the only sure cure -- a quick goal. 
</P>
<P>
Just 42 seconds into the third period, Gretzky sent a pass from the left boards 
out to defenseman Laidlaw, who put the puck into the back of the net and 
brought the fans back to life. 
</P>
<P>
Laidlaw's goal gave the Kings a little glimmer of hope and led to a flurry of 
goals -- but the Flames even had the edge in the flurry. 
</P>
<P>
Duchesne said: "The Flames play very well. They forecheck so well. The team 
that wins is the team that controls the puck, and they controlled the puck." 
</P>
<P>
McSorley concluded: "We've got to take charge. . . . We've had bad starts 
before, but we can't go out wanting not to make mistakes. Let's up the tempo of 
the game and make them skate with us. 
</P>
<P>
"We let them slow the game down. We can't do that." 
</P>
<P>
Or this series will end Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Game 4 will be played Monday night at the Forum at 7:30. . . . Wayne Gretzky 
needs one goal to become the NHL's all-time leading playoff goal scorer with 
86. He is tied with Mike Bossy at 85. . . . The Kings' record for least shots 
in a playoff game is 14, set against Edmonton in 1987. . . . The Kings went 
into Saturday night's game with six straight losses to the Flames, four in the 
regular season and two in the playoffs. The Kings have not beaten the Flames 
since Dec. 20.

DODGER RALLY FALLS SHORT AS MITCHELL LEADS GIANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON EDES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a tossup who was sickened more by Kevin Mitchell's ninth-inning, 
game-winning single Saturday night: The Dodgers, who lost to the Giants, 5-4, 
after spending the better part of the evening overcoming a 4-1 deficit, or 
Mitchell, who lost his lunch in left field after his tiebreaking hit off Jay 
Howell. 
</P>
<P>
Now, that must have been a pretty sight for the fans in the left-field 
pavilion, who otherwise were treated to a September-style spectacle in April, 
one that didn't end until Dodger-killer Craig Lefferts struck out Willie 
Randolph and Kirk Gibson with the tying run on base. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, however, was hardly worried about offending spectator sensibilities. 
To the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could have thrown up on them," said Mitchell, who has had the 
distinction of playing for what are arguably the Dodgers' three most hated 
rivals: the Giants, the Padres and the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
All three uniforms have been known to inspire some creative commentary from 
Dodger crowds. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the worst when I was with the Mets," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
For the Dodgers, Lefferts has been unbeatable regardless of the uniform. Like 
Mitchell, Lefferts is an ex-Padre -- he came to the Giants in the same deal -- 
and after his artful rescue of Atlee Hammaker Saturday night, he is 8-0 in his 
career against the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'd known that," Giant Manager Roger Craig said, "I would have started him 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, at least, put men on base against Lefferts, something no one else 
had been able to do this season. The left-hander had come into the game having 
retired the last 29 batters to face him, a streak that ended when he walked the 
first batter he faced in the eighth, John Shelby. 
</P>
<P>
That was right after pinch-hitter Rick Dempsey's ground-ball single off 
Hammaker had scored Eddie Murray with the tying run. Murray, who had doubled 
home a run in the sixth, hit a ground-rule double with two out in the eighth, 
then beat Candy Maldonado's throw to the plate on Dempsey's hit. 
</P>
<P>
Another Dodger pinch-hitter, Mickey Hatcher, had made it 4-3 in the seventh 
with a sacrifice fly after a single by Jeff Hamilton and a double by Alfredo 
Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton came up in the eighth with a chance to break the tie, and hit a shot 
off Lefferts, but Mitchell ran it down in left to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
In the bottom of the ninth, pinch-hitter Mariano Duncan hit a one-out single 
off Lefferts, but Randolph took a back-door slider for a called third strike, 
and Gibson, who had doubled home a run in the first and singled and scored in 
the sixth, went down swinging on another slider. 
</P>
<P>
While the Giants celebrated, Gibson reacted in the fashion for which he has 
become notorious. He flung his bat down, kicked it, threw his helmet against 
the dugout wall, then for good measure kicked the helmet, too. 
</P>
<P>
Someone asked Lefferts if he had noticed Gibson's reaction to the strikeout. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked mad," the pitcher said in classic understatement. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants looked vulnerable to be taken after building a 4-1 lead against 
Dodger starter Tim Leary with two runs in the first inning and Will Clark's 
two-run homer in the third. The Dodgers had eight base-runners in the last four 
innings, knocking Giant starter Scott Garrelts out in the seventh and then 
putting Hammaker on the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
But in the ninth, Ernest Riles hit a broken-bat single off Howell; Brett Butler 
sacrificed pinch-runner Donell Nixon to second, and after Howell induced Robby 
Thompson to pop to second, he issued an intentional walk to Clark. 
</P>
<P>
That brought up Mitchell, who entered the game with a league-leading 19 RBIs, a 
total he already had added to with a first-inning sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
"I get tired of them walking Will, too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't get much of the curveball that Howell threw him, but it was enough to 
bounce a ground ball through the middle. Shelby's throw from center field was 
way off line, and Nixon scored easily. 
</P>
<P>
"I still don't feel good," said Mitchell, who was bothered by a stomach virus. 
</P>
<P>
With Candy Maldonado still looking for his first home run, the Giants are 
depending heavily on Mitchell -- who already has five -- to provide some punch 
behind Clark. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not afraid of anything," Manager Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
Not even the fans in the pavilion.

<P>
EASY GOER'S 3-LENGTH VICTORY IS IMPRESSIVE BUT NOT SPECTACULAR

<P>
When Pat Day hops on the back of Easy Goer, the jockey's whip is excess 
baggage. 
</P>
<P>
The only whipping connected with Easy Goer Saturday was his annihilation of 
another group of horses as he won the $568,000 Wood Memorial by three lengths 
at Aqueduct. Easy Goer did not flirt with world records for a change but still 
added another chapter to a career that will be a disappointment if he doesn't 
win the Kentucky Derby and sweep the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer's luster has grown so much that Day, trainer Shug McGaughey and even 
other jockeys were apologizing for the 3-year-old Alydar colt's victory 
Saturday. Easy Goer didn't win the Wood by 13 lengths, which was the margin of 
his victory in the Gotham here two weeks ago, and his time Saturday for 1 1/8 
miles was not as astonishing as the mile in 1:32 2/5, which he ran in the 
previous race. 
</P>
<P>
That clocking was only a fifth of a second slower than Dr. Fager's world 
record. In the Wood, Easy Goer was timed in 1:50 3/5, which wasn't close to the 
track record of 1:47 set by Riva Ridge as a 4-year-old under 130 pounds in 
1973. Students of time were quick to point out, however, that Aqueduct was 
playing about two seconds faster than usual on Gotham day and about two seconds 
slower than normal Saturday, which makes Easy Goer's performance in the Wood 
considerably better than it seemed. 
</P>
<P>
The Wood was run on a fast track, but slow times were the order of the day. 
Texian won the race before the Wood, the six-furlong Best Turn Stakes for 3- 
year-olds, in 1:12 2/5, a time that wouldn't have been fast enough to beat 
maidens here two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Cordero, who finished last in the six-horse Wood with A.M. Swinger, 
congratulated Easy Goer's owner, 80-year-old Ogden Phipps, after the race and 
qualified the winner's time. 
</P>
<P>
"This was still a fast time," Cordero said. "It was a very good time, because 
of the track and because the wind was against us all the way down the 
backstretch." 
</P>
<P>
There was a headwind going down the backstretch and a crosswind working against 
the horses through the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer ran closer to the lead than he's been in most of his races. He was 
second, less than a length behind Diamond Donnie, in the early part of the run 
down the backstretch. With little urging from Day -- who has used the whip on 
Easy Goer only once in his nine races -- Easy Goer moved past Diamond Donnie 
just before the quarter pole. 
</P>
<P>
With Diamond Donnie dropping out of contention, there were horses on both sides 
of Easy Goer's flanks at the top of the stretch -- Rock Point on the outside 
and Triple Buck closer to the rail -- but Day only scrubbed his mount with the 
whip as they dismissed these faint-hearted challenges. 
</P>
<P>
The fractions were :48 3/5 for a half-mile, 1:13 2/5 for six furlongs and 1:38 
2/5 for the mile, which means that Easy Goer ran the last eighth of a mile in 
an excellent :12 1/5. Easy Goer will have to run an eighth of a mile farther on 
May 6 in the Kentucky Derby, carrying the same 126 pounds that he and the 
others carried Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Rock Point finished second, a head before Triple Buck, and then it was 11 1/2 
lengths back to the fourth-place finisher, Militron. Diamond Donnie and A.M. 
Swinger completed the order of finish. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the crowd of 21,170 came mainly to make a show bet on Easy Goer. Of the 
$894,000 bet to show on the race, all but $27,000 was wagered on Easy Goer. 
Aqueduct wound up paying a New York-record $181,000 out of its own coffers to 
guarantee show bettors a nickel profit on every dollar, the minimum required by 
state law. 
</P>
<P>
As the result of the show-pool imbalance, Easy Goer paid $2.20, $2.20 and 
$2.10, which was a dime more for win and place than he paid in the Gotham. Rock 
Point paid $3.60 and $2.10, and Triple Buck was $2.10 to show. Easy Goer earned 
$340,800 for his seventh win in nine starts, making last year's champion 
2-year-old colt a millionaire with a total of $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what some people are going to say," Day said. "They're going to say 
that the time wasn't so hot, that he didn't win by drawing off, and they're 
going to combine that with the two-turn thing and the Breeders' Cup. But I'm 
just as happy with this horse today as I was two weeks ago, even though he 
wasn't as explosive as he was in the Gotham. The only way I can describe him is 
unbelievable. I'll leave the rest of the adjectives up to those of you who do 
it for a living." 
</P>
<P>
In his only other race around two turns before Saturday, Easy Goer finished 
second to Is It True in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Churchill Downs last 
November. "This horse will like Churchill Downs (in the Derby) this time," 
McGaughey said. "I'm just glad this is over and we can move on to what we've 
been planning for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer will be flown to Louisville on Wednesday for his final Derby 
preparations. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything went perfectly today," McGaughey said after the Wood. "He handled 
two turns, he was laying close to the lead and leaving the eighth pole he took 
command. He had his ears pricked up and was just waiting for those other 
horses. And he didn't get tired. Pat said he was so full of run that he had to 
pull him up on the backside." 
</P>
<P>
One clocker caught Easy Goer galloping out 1 1/4 miles -- the Derby distance -- 
in 2:03 4/5. That's only two-fifths of a second slower than what it took 
Alysheba, running all out, to win the Derby two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Some of the horses behind Easy Goer still has respectable paydays. Rock Point 
earned $124,960 for running second and Triple Buck's third was worth $68,180. . 
. . A $2 exacta on Easy Goer and Rock Point paid $8.20. . . . Chris Antley won 
by a neck on Texian over Mr. Nickerson, and added a second victory in 
Saturday's last race, extending his New York record to 58 straight days with at 
least one win.

DANSIL HUGS RAIL TO BEAT CLEVER TREVOR

<P>
In races all week long, jockeys at Oaklawn Park avoided the rail. Until 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Brothers, trainer of Dansil, worked a couple of horses in the morning and 
passed the word to his rider, Larry Snyder, to hug the rail. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like the rail was pretty good, I don't know what the so-called experts 
think," Brothers said after Snyder followed the strategy and won the $400,000 
Arkansas Derby by three-quarters of a length over Clever Trevor. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think it was a disadvantage. When I walked across to saddle him, I 
kind of looked down and walked a few steps either way. I told him, 'Whatever 
you do, don't get off the rail; don't let the field swarm him where he loses 
his position." 
</P>
<P>
Brothers said he expected Dansil to be about fourth in the field of 11 
3-year-olds, but the complexion of the race changed when favored Manastash 
Ridge stumbled badly coming out of the gate -- and went on to finish ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Clever Trevor, winner of the Remington Park Derby, went to the front, and 
Dansil -- breaking from the No. 1 post position -- went with him. 
</P>
<P>
Clever Trevor, ridden by Don Pettinger, was a length in front of Dansil after a 
half-mile in a quick :45 3/5. Snyder, who has been among Oaklawn's leading 
riders for almost three decades, inched his horse along the rail and took a 
short lead as the field headed into the turn. 
</P>
<P>
Dansil led by more than a length in the stretch and then held off Clever 
Trevor. 
</P>
<P>
For Snyder, 46, it was his first Arkansas Derby victory. "I can't explain what 
it means," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dansil returned $20, $8.60 and $5.20 after running the 1 1/8 miles in 1:49 1/5. 
Clever Trevor paid $5.60 and $4.00, and Advocate Training's show price was 
$4.40.

ENDOW HOLDS ON FOR HALF-LENGTH WIN

Endow held off favored Flying Continental by a half-length to win Saturday's 
diamond jubilee running of the $250,000 California Derby at Golden Gate Fields. 
</P>
<P>
Endow took an early lead and nursed it throughout the 1 1/8-mile race, 
finishing in 1:49 2/5. The 3-year-old, ridden by Panamanian-born Amir Cedeno 
and carrying 119 pounds, earned $137,500 and paid $17.20, $4.80 and $3.60. 
</P>
<P>
Cedeno also rode Endow to victory earlier this month in the Sausalito Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
"So I have good luck," a smiling Cedeno said after the race. "My horse has 
speed, he likes to go head to head. Everything's coming like I think before the 
race." 
</P>
<P>
But trainer Laz Barrera, who watched Endow win the California Derby from Santa 
Anita, said he had no plans to take the Harbor View Farms colt to the Kentucky 
Derby May 6. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said he would concentrate on entering the California-bred son of 
Flying Paster and Kindheartedness in smaller races. 
</P>
<P>
Laffit Pincay Jr., said he lost too much ground going into the first turn with 
Flying Continental, who carried 117 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"That cost me the race," Pincay said. "They were going so slow that I would 
have had to strangle him to get him back. The way the race shaped up just 
wasn't for him, but that happens. He tried hard." 
</P>
<P>
The race marked the third loss by Flying Continental to Endow, who beat him 
twice when they were 2-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
Flying Continental is owned by Washington Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke and 
was bred at Elmendorf Farms in Lexington, Ky. The colt was nominated for the 
Kentucky Derby and needed a first or a strong second in the California Derby to 
enter. 
</P>
<P>
Flying Continental paid $2.60 and $2.20, while third-place finisher Briartic 
Chief paid $3.20 to show.

STRETCH CHARGE GIVES MAZILIER A TURF VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mazilier came from the back of the pack and took the lead down the stretch 
Saturday to win the $82,500 San Simeon Handicap at Santa Anita before a crowd 
of 40,629. 
</P>
<P>
Mazilier, ridden by Patrick Valenzuela, was timed in 1:15 4/5 for the 6 
1/2-furlong race for 4-year-olds and up on the hillside turf course. 
</P>
<P>
Owned by Juddmonte Farms and trained by Eddie Gregson, Mazilier beat Imperial 
Star by 1 1/4 lengths to earn $48,750 and pay $5.40, $3.80 and $3.00. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Star, ridden by Bill Shoemaker, paid $6.40 and $3.60. 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker was trying for his 1,000th stakes victory after scoring No. 999 
Thursday in the Montclair Handicap at Golden Gate Fields. The veteran rider has 
said he will retire at the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Caballo de Oro, ridden by Rafael Meza, was third by a head and paid $3.60. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky-bred Mazilier started slow in the field of eight and drew near the 
leaders at the halfway point before drifting wide in the turn to the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Five horses headed into the stretch side-by-side before Mazilier took control.

REDS END SCORELESS STREAK IN FOURTH INNING, SNAP LOSING STRING IN 10TH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Breaking their scoreless streak was relatively easy for the Reds Saturday at 
Cincinnati; ending their losing streak was a little more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
It took extra innings, but when Paul O'Neill singled home Kal Daniels in the 
10th, the Reds had a hard-earned, 5-4 victory over the Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds, shut out in three consecutive games, extended their string of 
scoreless innings to 30 before Eric Davis hit a sacrifice fly in the fourth 
inning. The major league record for consecutive scoreless innings is 48, set by 
the Philadelphia Athletics in 1906 and tied by Chicago Cubs in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of 31,073 gave the Reds a standing ovation when they finally scored. 
It had been 38 years since the Reds were shut out in three consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
Davis gave the Reds a 4-2 lead in the sixth inning with his fourth home run of 
the season. But reliever Kent Tekulve couldn't hold it, as the Astros tied it 
in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
In the 10th, the Reds loaded the bases on walks, two of them intentional. With 
one out, Daniels walked. Danny Darwin balked, and Davis was walked 
intentionally. After making a wild pitch, Darwin also walked Benzinger 
intentionally, bringing up O'Neill, who singled to left. 
</P>
<P>
"I balked," Darwin admitted. "There was no reason to balk, especially on a 
pitchout. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to strike out O'Neill. I guess he had a hit coming, because he 
had hit rifle shots for three outs." 
</P>
<P>
The Reds, who got six hits, have only 19 in their last 36 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
New York 3, Chicago 1 -- Sid Fernandez was so tired of hearing about being fat, 
he shed 20 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
If he had known how much it would improve his pitching, Fernandez, who improved 
to 2-0 with this victory at New York, would have trimmed down long ago. 
</P>
<P>
When Ryne Sandberg opened the ninth with a single, it was the fourth hit given 
up by Fernandez. Roger McDowell gave up another hit, but held on for the save. 
</P>
<P>
"The nagging was getting to me," said Fernandez, who now weighs about 230 
pounds. "I wasn't feeling good about myself. I didn't do anything drastic to 
knock off the pounds. I just ran a lot and rode the bicycle. Now, I'm going to 
keep it off. That gives me stamina." 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 4, Philadelphia 3 -- Plagued by injuries and lack of hitting, 
nothing comes easy for the Pirates these days. 
</P>
<P>
They had to call on workhorse Jeff Robinson again to get the victory. Robinson, 
formerly the setup man for Jim Gott, has been the finisher since Gott was 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson entered the game in the eighth. His first pitch was wild, allowing the 
go-ahead run to score. The Pirates scored two runs in the bottom of the eighth 
and staggered to the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson has two wins and four saves for a team that only has seven victories. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies had 14 hits, three by Tommy Herr, but left 15 runners on base. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 5, Montreal 2 -- Although three of their starters are on the disabled 
list, the Cardinals continue to get outstanding pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Terry gave up just five hits to improve his record to 2-1. Friday night, 
Jose DeLeon pitched a two-hitter in a 1-0 win over the Expos. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Pendleton drove in three runs for the Cardinals, and former Dodger Pedro 
Guerrero doubled in another. The 18th run batted in this month tied Guerrero's 
career high for a month. 
</P>
<P>
The Expos have lost their last five games at Busch Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 5, San Diego 1 -- John Smoltz got too pumped up at Atlanta and failed 
to complete his third victory in four decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Smoltz worked out of a jam in the eighth inning when Dion James made a leaping 
catch against the fence with two runners on. 
</P>
<P>
"Smoltz did a great job," Atlanta Manager Russ Nixon said. "He got so hyper in 
the eighth inning that we decided he'd had enough." DAN HAFNER

Mark Breland overcame a second-round knee injury and stopped Rafael Pineda with 
a quick three-punch flurry in the fifth round Saturday at Atlantic City, N.J., 
to retain his World Boxing Assn. welterweight title. 
</P>
<P>
Breland had trouble throwing his jab after he hurt his left knee while avoiding 
a punch. 
</P>
<P>
Breland, who improved his record to 24-1-1, used a big overhand right to stun 
Pineda in the fifth round and followed with a left uppercut and a right 
uppercut. Pineda, who is 20-1, turned his back on Breland and draped himself 
over the ropes. Breland hit him again in the back of the head, and referee Ted 
Pick stopped the fight at 1:14.

Although they failed to overtake the Lakers and win the Pacific Division title, 
the Phoenix Suns completed the greatest turnabout in National Basketball Assn. 
history with a 121-111 victory over the Spurs Saturday night at San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns were 28-54 last season, but with the additions of free-agent forward 
Tom Chambers, reserves Ty Corbin and Dan Majerle, plus the development of 
playmaker Kevin Johnson and the shooting of Eddie Johnson, they improved to 
55-27. 
</P>
<P>
Chambers rested a bruised hip Saturday night, but Corbin scored 25 points, and 
Johnson scored 12 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter to bring the Suns from 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
Miami 91, Houston 89 -- The Rockets followed their upset victory at Phoenix 
Friday night with this loss at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Edwards' driving layup with four seconds remaining climaxed an 18-7 run 
in the closing minutes that gave the Heat its 15th victory in 82 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Rockets led by nine points with 5:21 left, when the Heat started its run. 
</P>
<P>
New York Knicks 109, New Jersey 99 -- Mark Jackson scored 20 points, including 
a three-point basket that gave the Knicks the lead for good in the fourth 
quarter at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
The victory left the Knicks with a 35-6 record at home, tying the club's 
all-time mark set by the 1972-73 NBA championship team. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey finished by losing 20 of its last 23 games and its last 16 on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 117, Milwaukee 110 -- Reggie Miller scored 16 of his 28 points in the 
fourth quarter at Milwaukee as the Pacers outfought the Bucks down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
The upset prevented the Bucks from winning their 50th game. It was the first 
road victory for the Pacers in 14 games against Central Division competition. 
The Pacers, who played winning ball the last one-third of the season, finished 
28-54. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 111, Golden State 95 -- A late-season slump prevented the Warriors from 
staging a turnaround as big as the Suns'. This loss at Salt Lake City was their 
sixth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the slump down the stretch, the Warriors finished with a 43-39 record, 
an improvement of 23 games. 
</P>
<P>
Karl Malone missed another game with a sprained ankle but he is expected to 
play Thursday night when the Jazz play host to the Warriors in the opening game 
of the best-of-five first-round series. DAN HAFNER

The enforcement staff of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. maintains that 
Kentucky assistant basketball coach Dwayne Casey sent $1,000 to the father of a 
recruit last year, Casey's attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
"The enforcement staff has not changed its position," attorney Joe Bill 
Campbell said during a mid-afternoon break in the NCAA Committee on Infractions 
hearing. Casey has denied sending the money to Claud Mills, father of Chris 
Mills of L.A. Fairfax High School. Mills is a freshman at Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
Also, three charges were dropped, including one that alleged L.A. Fairfax 
recruit Sean Higgins, now attending Michigan, was offered money and was 
improperly recruited by Casey.

<P>
MULLEN, RUN OVER BY BAUMGARTNER, RETURNS TO LIGHT FLAMES IN THIRD PERIOD

<P>
For the longest time Saturday night, the Calgary Flames refused to say what was 
the matter with Joe Mullen, who was run over late in the first period by King 
defenseman Ken Baumgartner. 
</P>
<P>
Mullen provided the answer in the third period: Not much. 
</P>
<P>
Mullen, who spent the second period in the locker room, returned to assist on 
the fourth goal and score the fifth as the Flames withstood a late rally by the 
Kings to win, 5-2, at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
"I got my head back together and felt like I could contribute," said Mullen, 
who complained of dizziness and a sore jaw. 
</P>
<P>
Had Baumgartner deliberately tried to injure Mullen? "You seen it," he said. 
"What do you think?" 
</P>
<P>
Cliff Fletcher saw it, too, and didn't have any doubts. "It was a real cheap 
shot," said the Flames' general manager. "That's the way (Baumgartner) plays. 
He isn't good enough to play in the International League. I guess he did his 
job. He put a good hockey player out of the game for two periods. He gave him a 
stick right in the jaw and knocked him out." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Mullen said, "I don't think I was out, but I really don't remember 
the whole play." 
</P>
<P>
He returned to the bench midway through the third period. "The doctor said I 
know my body better than anybody else and that if I felt like I could go out 
and play, and I wasn't dizzy or off-balance or anything, I could go out and 
play," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His teammates applauded his grit. "He showed a lot of heart to come back," said 
Joel Otto, whose first-period goal gave the Flames a 2-0 lead a few minutes 
before Mullen was knocked out of the game. "He's got a lot of spunk." 
</P>
<P>
Mullen, who led the Flames and established a record for a U.S.-born player with 
110 points in the regular season, has had previous run-ins with Baumgartner 
this season. And with other so-called "enforcers." 
</P>
<P>
"Mullen is our Gretzky," Otto said. "He's a big part of our team and he's taken 
runs like that all season." 
</P>
<P>
Said Mullen, who had 21 points against the Kings in the regular season: "It's 
not like I don't expect it out there. You expect to get hit." 
</P>
<P>
But Baumgartner, the Flames suggested, went too far. "Is there any question 
whether it was a cheap shot?" Jim Peplinski asked a reporter. "In your mind, is 
there?" 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Buss took his regular seat in the upper deck behind the north goal 
Saturday night, seemingly portending doom for the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
According to Buss, they fare better when he stays away. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, when he still owned the team, Buss was on his way home, listening on 
the radio, when the Kings produced the still-ballyhooed "Miracle on 
Manchester," their magical rally from a 5-0 third-period deficit to a 6-5 
overtime playoff victory over the Edmonton Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
And then, last week, the owner of the Lakers and the Forum watched on 
television from a seat in the Forum Club as the Kings eliminated the Oilers 
from the playoffs and ended Edmonton's reign as Stanley Cup champions. 
</P>
<P>
"I missed them on purpose," Buss said of the two most memorable moments in the 
Kings' mostly forgettable history. "I'm very superstitious, just like the 
players who grow those beards in the playoffs. I have this feeling that if I'm 
outside of the building, or I'm not watching in person and we go ahead, I don't 
like to change my position." 
</P>
<P>
Buss, though, stayed put as the Flames jumped on the Kings early and took some 
of the life out of a sellout crowd of 16,005. 
</P>
<P>
And he was still in his seat as the Flames wrapped up a 5-2 win that gave them 
a 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven Smythe Division final. 
</P>
<P>
Buss was in the parking lot seven years ago when rookie Doug Smith scored on a 
rebound of a shot by Mark Hardy at 5 minutes 58 seconds of the third period, 
cutting the Kings' deficit against the Oilers to 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
"My driver said, 'Shall we go back?' " Buss recalled. "I said, 'No, that would 
jinx it. This is just absolutely perfect. Let's keep driving.' And then we 
scored the third goal and the fourth goal and the fifth goal and then (at 2:35 
of overtime) the sixth goal." 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Buss told a reporter: "I thought our only chance was if I left . . 
. I've watched every game to completion and I thought the one game I left would 
be the miracle of all time, but only if I left." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, he said Saturday, he was on his way to a banquet. 
</P>
<P>
His absence at such a critical juncture was often used as an example of his 
perceived disinterest in the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
But Buss, who sold the team to Bruce McNall 13 months ago, said the Kings' 
abysmal record was a source of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
Their success this season, he said, delighted him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm as excited as any other fan," he said. "Firstly, I think any sports owner 
is a fan of the game, and I'm still a fan. 
</P>
<P>
"When the 'Miracle on Manchester' came around, you could sense that if you ever 
gave the hockey fans something to cheer about, they would really come out in 
droves, as they are doing now."

PAYING ITS BILLS ON TIME IS NOT THE PENTAGON'S STRONG SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When defense experts debate critical issues of national security, the 
Pentagon's inability to pay small aerospace contractors on time seldom comes up 
-- even though some of them have been driven into virtual insolvency. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of this year, 12,000 Defense Department payments to small 
businesses in the West were late because of computer foul-ups, rapid employee 
turnover and the Pentagon's complex bureaucratic rules, among other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The computer software that the Defense Department uses to process contracts in 
a Los Angeles office, for example, is more than 20 years old. About 35% of the 
employees who use the computers leave government service every year. And 
contract regulations are so complex that many small firms hire consultants at 
government expense just to fill out government forms. 
</P>
<P>
The situation, which has driven some companies out of defense contracting, has 
prompted an uncharacteristically angry response by the defense industry. Two 
trade groups, representing larger contractors who have also had problems, have 
been formed to protest payment delays. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Verge of Breakdown' 
</P>
<P>
The problem has raised troubling questions of whether the entire structure of 
defense procurement -- writing contracts, handling paper work and issuing 
payments -- is in crisis. While the military services are pushing the limits of 
technology in weaponry, relatively simple matters -- like getting a check in 
the mail -- seem to be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
The payment snafus appear to reflect a larger Defense Department problem of 
attempting to do too much on a shrinking budget. The mismatch between the 
Pentagon's agenda and what it can realistically afford has led to such policies 
as forcing contractors to develop new weapons at a loss; program schedules 
being stretched out; and drastic reductions in quantities of weapons on order, 
which in turn drives up prices. 
</P>
<P>
"I worry that the whole procurement system is on the verge of a nervous 
breakdown," Rep. Les Aspin (D -- Wis.), who chairs the House Armed Services 
Committee, said in a recent interview. "If morale is low and people are 
unhappy, it is going to affect the quality of the products. Morale is terrible 
right now. Everybody is unhappy with the system." 
</P>
<P>
The longstanding problems in the Pentagon's business functions are finally 
getting some attention. The House Armed Services Committee last week launched 
an investigation into late payment problems at the Defense Contract 
Administration Service, the Pentagon agency that disburses $51 billion annually 
to contractors in the Western United States. 
</P>
<P>
Brig. Gen. John Serur, commander of the regional DCAS office, said in a recent 
interview that the worst of the immediate problems have been solved. Of the 
12,000 delinquent bills at the beginning of this year, he said, 3,330 remained 
at the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
"I know there is light at the end of the tunnel," he said. "Please don't 
misunderstand. We still have backlogs (of unpaid bills.) As long as we have 
those backlogs, we have contractors with complaints." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some contractors say they have detected little improvement in bill 
payments, and even when longstanding delinquent accounts are paid off, they 
add, they are left with bitter feelings about the experience. 
</P>
<P>
Sunrise Electronics of Glendora, for example, was unable to meet the payroll 
for its 10 employees last month when it failed to receive a check from DCAS for 
an invoice submitted in January. 
</P>
<P>
"You go down to the bank to borrow money and they don't understand," said Vice 
President Alan Carey about Sunrise's efforts to get bank credit. "It is beyond 
their comprehension." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the experience, Sunrise is refusing to accept any new contracts 
in which DCAS is the designated payment authority. The company recently struck 
an agreement with the Navy under which the service will pay it directly for a 
contract that would ordinarily be handled by DCAS. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Behind in Know-How 
</P>
<P>
"It is a sad situation over there at DCAS," Carey said. "The attitude of the 
people is dismal. If it weren't for a few caring civil servants, nothing would 
get done." 
</P>
<P>
Some defense experts, however, worry that persistent budget cutting, low 
federal pay and additional regulations will override even the best intentions 
of the "servants" in the government system. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to buy all these really fancy weapons and spend billions on new 
systems, but we don't have the money to make the system work from an 
administrative standpoint," said Michael Beltramo, a defense industry 
consultant. "We are making it so difficult to do business with the government 
that you have to ask yourself whether it is even worth the bother any more. The 
system is too awful to comprehend." 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, Beltramo and others are asking whether the Pentagon is capable of 
dealing with high technology such as the Star Wars missile defense shield when 
its business system is not up to 1960s levels of administrative know-how. 
</P>
<P>
"There is too much focus on the big picture and not enough on the things that 
make the system work," said Rep. David Dreier (R-La Verne), a member of the 
House Small Business Committee and one of a handful of Congress members who 
have been involved in helping small firms get paid by DCAS. 
</P>
<P>
"I have received a flow of letters from contractors," Dreier said. "These 
letters are going to be a major issue that we raise. This should not be 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
Although contractors have long complained about late payments by the DCAS 
office in Los Angeles, a series of problems late last year resulted in a new 
surge of delinquent payments. DCAS, in a letter to contractors in February, 
admitted to a "deterioration of operations." 
</P>
<P>
A sprinkler system had malfunctioned late last year and partially flooded a 
computer room in the agency's Los Angeles area office in El Segundo, Serur 
said. Also, a weather balloon had landed in a nearby power grid and caused an 
interruption of electricity to computers; that problem could have been avoided 
by a backup power supply system that had been forgone as an economy measure. 
Then there was new computer software that would not operate properly and caused 
a three-day shutdown, the general said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reluctance to Complain 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some contractors, such as Richard Puga, owner of Puga Engineering 
near Watts, were told that "the check is in the mail." But, all too often, the 
check was not in the mail and tempers continued to rise. 
</P>
<P>
Major prime contractors are just as angry but are more reluctant to make their 
feelings public. A vice president at one major Los Angeles defense firm said 
75% of its payments from DCAS are more than 30 days late and that the average 
invoice is still unpaid after 180 days. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some that were a year old," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal law, DCAS must pay interest to a contractor if it fails to pay a 
bill within 45 days. So far this fiscal year, the DCAS regional office has paid 
out $790,000 in interest, up from $417,000 during all of fiscal 1988, Serur 
said. The interest total would be even higher, but DCAS does not pay when it 
loses invoices or on certain types of disbursements known as progress payments. 
</P>
<P>
Even the military services are getting angry at DCAS. Both the Navy and the 
Army have complained that the agency is paying contractors out of the incorrect 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the U.S. Army Tank Automotive Command notified DCAS last month 
that it had paid bills to FMC Corp. in San Jose with funds belonging to the 
nation of Portugal in connection with foreign military sales, according to 
internal DCAS documents obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
A DCAS public affairs officer said, "People do make errors. It seems to happen 
because we have turnover of staff and we have borrowed staff. It has been 
happening, but not to a real large extent." 
</P>
<P>
While problems with computers can be fixed and accounting errors can be 
remedied, inadequate federal pay and the inability to retain workers is a 
longer-range problem. Many of the workers who process the millions of pages of 
defense paper work earn $12,000 to $14,000 a year, about half of what they 
would get in private industry and just at the poverty line for a family of 
four. 
</P>
<P>
Serur said DCAS has been forced to hire recent high school graduates to conduct 
voucher examinations, in which contractor billings must be verified against the 
terms of contracts. It is hardly work for inexperienced young people, 
especially because defense regulations have grown so complex in recent years, 
observed Beltramo, the consultant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bad Situation Inherited 
</P>
<P>
William Jenkins, a recently retired DCAS official responsible for personnel, 
said he is happy to be out of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't have the reputation I like," he said. "We couldn't hire good people. 
The people we trained would go to industry." 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins said Serur, who became head of DCAS' regional office in 1984, inherited 
a bad situation that had festered for years. "Of all the generals we have had 
there, he was the most approachable," Jenkins said. DCAS' workload has 
increased dramatically in recent years owing to Pentagon budget growth and to 
the increasing complexity of defense regulations. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the DCAS work force has grown more and more inexperienced. 
Serur said that 60% of his employees have less than two years' experience. 
</P>
<P>
In part because the government can no longer afford to pay its employees enough 
to live in Los Angeles, the Pentagon announced two months ago that it has 
decided to consolidate its nine regional DCAS payment offices around the 
country in Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
The hope is that the government will be able to attract a more stable work 
force in Columbus that will be able to live adequately on government salaries. 
The Defense Logistics Agency, DCAS' parent organization, is setting up its new 
finance center in a former Air Force-owned industrial plant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Move Could Worsen Things 
</P>
<P>
But the prospect of a monolithic federal bureaucracy handling $51 billion in 
payments annually has worried defense industry executives even more than the 
problems at DCAS' regional office. While Pentagon officials insist that the 
Columbus operation will provide a solution, congressional officials are not 
sure. 
</P>
<P>
"Our concern is that when they start the move from Los Angeles to Columbus this 
summer, things could get much worse," an investigator from the House Armed 
Services Committee said last week. "That's what we are hearing from some 
contractors." 
</P>
<P>
Some bankers are also worried that the selection of Columbus was 
ill-considered. When a contractor in Los Angeles receives a large payment, 
which can be in the tens of millions of dollars, a courier typically will pick 
up the check at DCAS' office in El Segundo and take it to the Federal Reserve 
Bank branch in downtown Los Angeles. Such handling reduces the time the 
contracting firm must wait to actually get the money credited to its account. 
</P>
<P>
There is no Federal Reserve Bank branch in Columbus, however, and contractors 
will have to have couriers take the checks to Cleveland to clear them. 
Otherwise, the checks will be mailed to the contractors, a prospect that could 
add several days to the payment cycle. On a $25-million payment, for example, 
that can cost more than $20,000 in additional interest on a three-day postal 
excursion. Such a loss of interest is not reimbursable under federal 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon is attempting to create the capability to transfer funds 
electronically, something private banks and major corporations have done for 
years. The capability is scheduled to be available this summer, William 
Cassell, comptroller of the Defense Logistics Agency, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
But one aerospace company vice president is skeptical. "Just knowing what it 
takes us to train our own people internally raises concerns that they will not 
be able to do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
James Southerland, president of Contract Advisory Services, a Torrance firm 
that helps small contractors with their paper work, said the government often 
compounds its late payment problems by taking discounts for prompt payment even 
when the payments are late. If contractors mischarged the government in such a 
fashion, Beltramo said, it is likely that they would be indicted for fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Aspin, the House Armed Services Committee chairman, has grown increasingly 
concerned about horror stories in the business functions of the procurement 
system. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a system that could freeze up on you," he said. "In the procurement 
area, one problem is the continual set of reforms that have gone into effect 
before the previous set has been digested. 
</P>
<P>
"These changes are coming too fast for the system. You have problems with 
people working under the old regulations and they don't even know about the new 
regulations."

STALL IN THE TRADE DEFICIT DECLINE SPELLS WOES FOR U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The outsized U.S. trade deficit, which declined smartly last year, is leveling 
off at an ominously high plateau. 
</P>
<P>
Even the most optimistic forecasts show it shrinking only marginally for the 
rest of this year, and some studies predict that it will soon start heading 
back up. 
</P>
<P>
"Some very disturbing trends already are in place," said William Cline of the 
Institute for International Economics. 
</P>
<P>
The causes are wide ranging: from the stubbornly strong dollar to the low U.S. 
saving rate, from American consumers' insatiable appetite for imports to 
American manufacturers' traditional reluctance to export. 
</P>
<P>
And the possible consequences are alarming: upward pressure on prices, new 
turmoil in financial markets and, ultimately, the end of the U.S. economic 
expansion, which is now in its seventh year. 
</P>
<P>
But the prescriptions for reducing the trade deficit further are not 
particularly appetizing either. The United States could push the dollar's value 
down further, which would increase the attractiveness abroad of U.S. products 
but would aggravate inflation. Or it could intentionally slow the economy 
enough to curb the appetite for imports. 
</P>
<P>
"The trade-offs now are all bad," said David D. Hale, chief economist of Kemper 
Financial Services in Chicago. "Anything that policy- makers do to deal with 
the problem is likely to be painful." 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, by contrast, the cure for the growing trade deficit seemed 
clear -- a cheaper dollar. The highly valued dollar had made imports cheap in 
the United States and U.S. goods expensive abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar began declining in 1985 and, after a longer-than-expected lag, the 
trade deficit finally shrank markedly in 1988 to $120 billion, down more than 
20% from the record $152 billion the year before. It was the smallest annual 
trade deficit since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Already, however, improvements in the trade deficit have stopped, and the 
monthly merchandise trade deficit has been stuck on a plateau for about six 
months. The Commerce Department reported recently that the trade deficit for 
February widened to $10.5 billion, up from $8.7 billion the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dollar Relatively Stable 
</P>
<P>
At the rate of the first two months of the year, the 1989 trade deficit will 
reach about $114 billion, only a slight improvement from 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The stall-out can be traced to a host of factors: 
</P>
<P>
Although the dollar's value has declined dramatically from its peak in early 
1985, it has remained relatively stable for the past 20 months. Thus, U.S. 
goods have gained no price advantage for that long in their competition with 
foreign products. 
</P>
<P>
Despite some recent signs of a slowdown in the economy, Americans are still 
consuming far more than they produce and relying on imports to make up the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
Many popular consumer items, such as videocassette recorders, are not made in 
the United States. Likewise, many of the capital goods that industry needs for 
expansion -- essential items such as machine tools and electronic equipment -- 
can only be purchased abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Many U.S. industries -- such as chemical producers and pulp and paper 
manufacturers -- are operating at flank speed and cannot move to boost 
production quickly enough to take advantage of export markets. Many U.S. firms 
have been reluctant to spend money to increase their production capacity until 
they become convinced that the overseas market will last. 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices are rising again, increasing the dollar value of the goods that the 
United States imports. Although the value of oil imports fell $3.4 billion in 
1988, it is expected to rise $10 billion this year and another $8 billion in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Americans are not saving enough to finance what the country needs to 
invest in new production facilities. As a result, America -- both the 
government and individuals as well -- must borrow the difference. And to be 
able to cash in their foreign money, they must use it to buy goods and services 
from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Any serious move to help bring the trade deficit down further is likely to 
spawn problems of its own. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fed May Push Rates Up 
</P>
<P>
Robert Z. Lawrence, an economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington, 
warns that pushing the dollar's value down much further would add to inflation 
by raising import prices significantly. And a cheaper dollar, he says, would 
make it even easier for foreign investors to buy U.S. firms and real estate at 
bargain prices. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Lawrence points out, a cheaper dollar would discourage 
foreign investments in U.S. stocks and bonds because their rates of return 
would decline with the dollar. That would deprive the U.S. economy of an 
important source of funds. 
</P>
<P>
To prevent the dollar from plummeting, the Federal Reserve might feel obliged 
to push interest rates up, even though that would slow the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
Another possible solution is to reduce the federal budget deficit. That would 
free up more domestic savings for more productive investments than Treasury 
securities and at the same time it would curb Americans' appetite for imports 
by having a depressing effect on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
But if imports fell too sharply, that could seriously hurt the economies of 
such U.S. allies as Taiwan and South Korea, which depend heavily on sales to 
the United States. That is why economists prefer to narrow the trade gap by 
raising exports rather than lowering imports. 
</P>
<P>
"We've essentially run out of options," Barry P. Bosworth, a Brookings 
Institution economist, said. 
</P>
<P>
Not all analysts find the long-term outlook so bleak. 
</P>
<P>
"While it is admittedly true that there has been a certain marking of time in 
the rate at which these external imbalances are being reduced, the basic trend 
remains one of encouraging improvement," said Satoshi Sumita, the governor of 
the Bank of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Paul R. Krugman, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist, believes 
that it is too early to tell whether the improvement in the trade deficit has 
stalled. He points out that the combination of the lower dollar and stable 
wages have made the United States an inexpensive place in which to produce, 
compared with most other industrial countries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Reindustrialization' 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what the econometric models say, it's hard to see why, given a 
little time, U.S. firms shouldn't shift their production facilities back to the 
United States," he said. "If they do that soon, over the long haul, you'd find 
that our exports would increase." 
</P>
<P>
Krugman already sees some evidence that the impact of the weaker dollar is 
slowly bringing about "a fundamental reindustrialization" in this country that 
eventually will see American firms moving back into industries they once 
abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is, the things you could do quickly in that line are pretty well 
exhausted," Krugman said. "You have to allow a five-year time horizon for any 
change. The dollar must stay where it is during that period, and people must be 
confident that it's going to stay." 
</P>
<P>
But many economists find little room for hope. Hale says the stall-out seems 
almost certain to push the dollar lower as currency investors lose confidence 
in the future of the U.S. economy. To prop up the dollar, he says, the Fed will 
raise interest rates here at home. 
</P>
<P>
That, he predicts, will "almost guarantee stagflation" -- the kind of slow 
growth and high inflation that characterized the 1970s. "There's no question," 
he says, "that the stall-out is here."

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / IRWIN L. KELLNER: SPRING FORWARD, DON'T FALL BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRWIN L. KELLNER, IRWIN L. KELLNER is chief economist at Manufacturers 
Hanover in New York.

<TEXT>
<P>
Southern Californians may not fully appreciate it, but April is a month of 
change. In most of the rest of the country, cold weather and gray skies give 
way to sunshine and warmth. Lawns, trees and bushes respond by greening up, 
while splashes of color dot the landscape, providing a picturesque setting for 
the return of migratory fowl. 
</P>
<P>
We mark the occasion by switching to daylight savings time. This way, the rest 
of the country gets to do what Southern Californians do practically all year 
around -- enjoy the great outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
To help us remember which way to move the clock, we are taught the phrase 
"spring forward, fall back." This might also be a good lesson for economists to 
learn, as they sift through each batch of statistics searching for clues 
regarding the direction of the economy and the financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
Too many economists these days seem to be falling back, rather than springing 
forward. They are worried too much about the past and not enough about the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
The current fixation with inflation is a good example of concentrating on the 
past; focusing on tight money and the growing possibility of recession 
constitutes looking ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Inflation is nothing new. We've had inflation every year in the postwar era 
except two -- 1949 and 1955. In the other years the price level went up, the 
only difference being the rate of rise. 
</P>
<P>
In some years, price inflation was moderate, while in others it was more 
severe. On three occasions, the rate of inflation reached double-digits (10% or 
more); these and five additional flare-ups led to our eight postwar recessions. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, however, we have managed to keep inflation fairly steady at 
moderate rates. As I observed in my last column, this can be traced to a rather 
unusual set of developments, ranging from the severity of the last recession, 
to the earlier rise in the dollar, to the fall in oil prices -- and to the 
stock market crash. 
</P>
<P>
This latter event, you will recall, persuaded labor and management not to raise 
prices because of the widespread fear that the stock crash was a prelude to a 
recession -- or worse. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, when a recession did not develop, the markets came to the 
conclusion that inflation was about to break out of its trend and worsen. Their 
reasoning was that any economy that could weather 1987's stock market crash 
must be strong enough to generate a new round of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Twisting around the words of the late Will Rogers, the markets from that point 
on never met a statistic they liked. Every number seemed to contain the seeds 
of inflation. As a result, the markets provoked the Federal Reserve into 
tightening money with a vengeance: 
</P>
<P>
Short-term interest rates shot up more than three percentage points during a 
year's time. 
</P>
<P>
This produced an inverted yield curve, where short-term rates rise above 
long-term rates -- a development that has appeared before every postwar 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
Bank reserves and the money supply have hardly grown at all for more than a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the expansion is beginning to show its age: 
</P>
<P>
Employment growth has slowed, while the number of hours in the average work 
week has begun to decline. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending has softened, with purchases of goods no higher than levels 
first reached 2 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
New car sales last month skidded to their lowest levels since November, 1987 -- 
right after the market's crash. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California notwithstanding, the residential real estate market has 
softened dramatically, as rising interest rates have kept an increasing number 
of families from buying homes. 
</P>
<P>
Factory output is declining, as are new orders, capacity use, imports and 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
Unsold goods are beginning to pile up. 
</P>
<P>
As plentiful as this evidence of a slower economy is, it is not sufficient for 
the inflation-conscious markets. They will not let the Federal Reserve take its 
foot off the monetary brake until they are certain that this slowdown is for 
real -- not just another false signal. 
</P>
<P>
This will also want to see signs that inflation is moderating. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is, by the time the markets are satisfied with the trend of 
inflation and the pace of economic activity, it may be too late. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, inflation usually does not respond immediately to a softening in 
the economy. The record shows that many times inflation has continued to worsen 
months after a slowdown -- or a recession -- has begun. 
</P>
<P>
The record also shows that once an economy loses forward momentum, it doesn't 
just stand still -- it slips backward. 
</P>
<P>
This is because inventories pile up, and as business try to reduce them, they 
wind up slashing orders, which in turn forces suppliers to cut output and 
employment, further depressing spending, which causes goods to pile up even 
more. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the problems peculiar to the current expansion. Besides its 
record length, these revolve mainly around the unprecedented debt burdens of 
consumers, business and the developing countries. Let us not forget the plight 
of the savings and loan firms and Washington's budget deficit, which would grow 
-- not contract -- in the event of a recession. 
</P>
<P>
It is to be hoped that April will turn out to have marked a change in the 
direction of interest rates, thus ensuring the continuation of the expansion, 
rather than a change from expansion to recession. Time will tell.

WALL STREET / JOHN CRUDELE: ON THE STREET, BEING HOT IS BETTER THAN BEING GOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Crudele, JOHN CRUDELE is a financial columnist for the New York Post. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wall Street has always liked winning streaks. Even though it spends a fortune 
to hire the brainiest people it can find, the financial community is still very 
partial to a hot hand. "I'd rather be hot than good," you could say, has always 
been its motto. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some of the people, concepts and things that are hot right now. Read 
them quickly, because sometimes the flame doesn't burn for very long. 
</P>
<P>
* Hottest Raider: Carl C. Icahn, the head of Trans World Airlines, is still the 
man to follow if you are looking to make money from corporate restructurings. 
Michael Lamb, president of Wealth Monitors in Kansas City, estimates that Icahn 
has made more than $700 million from his investment in Texaco (which he tried 
to take over); $300 million from his USX Corp. holdings (which he tried to take 
over), and he could reap a $400-million profit if he decides to sell his stake 
in TWA (which he took over). If you're looking for a hot hand to shake, Icahn's 
the one. 
</P>
<P>
* Hottest Mutual Fund Manager: David Alger, who runs the Alger Small 
Capitalization Portfolio, has seen the value of his fund's holdings appreciate 
20.21% so far this year. According to Lipper Analytical Services, which tracks 
these things, that's the best performance of any stock mutual fund so far this 
year. The Alger Small Cap fund was up 17.5% in 1988, which was slightly better 
than the market as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
* Economist on a Roll: David Bostian, head of Bostian Research Associates, New 
York, was the most accurate forecaster of U.S. economic growth and inflation in 
1988, says Robert J. Eggert of the Blue Chip Economic Index, Sedona, Ariz. 
Eggert surveys over 50 economists, and Bostian came the closest to predicting 
both the GNP and consumer price index. Bostian now says the economy is 
weakening, and the gross national product should grow at only 2.2% this year. 
Inflation isn't a big problem, and interest rates should come down, he says. 
</P>
<P>
* Matchmaker on Fire: While there aren't any official statistics, Wasserstein 
Perella Group, the 1-year-old private investment banking firm, seems to have 
been involved in the most new corporate mergers and restructuring transactions 
in the first three months of 1989. Wasserstein Perella counts 14 deals it began 
-- but hasn't necessarily completed yet -- in 1989, including involvement in 
the proposed merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications. 
</P>
<P>
* Analysts With the Midas Touch: Lawrence Harris of Bateman Eichler, Hill 
Richards in Los Angeles was right on the money in a report last month when he 
predicted that Lockheed Corp. would sell some assets and real estate and 
repurchase stock. His report came out weeks before Lockheed did just that. And 
Roger Redman, an analyst with Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood in Minneapolis, was 
on target when he predicted a restructuring at Control Data Corp. 
</P>
<P>
* Hottest Investment Concept: Yuppies apparently want to make sure they can 
afford to put their kids through college, so state bonds that help guarantee 
the little yups a higher education are very popular. More than a dozen states 
have already offered prepaid tuition plans or educational bonds, and another 
dozen are thinking of doing so. The federal government countered recently by 
making Series E savings bonds tax free, starting in 1989, for most people, if 
the money is used for education. 
</P>
<P>
* Explosive New Product: Of all the products put out by American corporations 
within the past year, one of the most popular has been RJR Nabisco's 
Teddygrahams, bite-sized cookies. Gorman's New Product News estimates that 
Teddygrahams are now the third-best-selling cookie in the country, selling 
about $120 million worth last year. 
</P>
<P>
* Most Popular Scam: Telemarketing scams are the hottest thing on the dark side 
of investing, according to Scott Stapf of the North American Securities 
Administrators Assn. And, he says, this season there are three new phone scams. 
In one, investors are sold precious metals that the scamster says will be 
stored in a well-known bank. But the gold never quite makes it to the bank, and 
the crook takes a hike. In the second, investors are sold interests in 
restaurants that don't exist. And in the third scam, the crook puts his victims 
into a family of scams. Stapf says this is being billed as a "hard-asset 
management program." 
</P>
<P>
* Most Surprising Company: Based on the last quarterly earnings it reported, 
Jacobson Stores Inc. gave Wall Street one of the biggest favorable surprises. 
According to the Institutional Brokers Estimate System, Jacobson reported 
profits of $1.31 a share for its fourth quarter that ended in January. Wall 
Street only expected $1.04. 
</P>
<P>
* Hottest Stock: Shares of Silicon Systems, a California electronic equipment 
manufacturer, have doubled to $20 from around $10 in the past few months. 
Knight-Ridder Tradecenter, which keeps tabs on unusual stock activity, says 
it's one of the hottest issues around. 
</P>
<P>
Let's say a guy goes to the doctor, worried that he has cancer and only has 
three months to live. "No," the doctor says, "you're all right. You've got 
heart disease and you'll be alive for at least another six months." 
</P>
<P>
"Thanks, doc," the relieved patient says, "that makes me feel a whole lot 
better." 
</P>
<P>
The stock market is the patient. And the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is the 
doctor, who, by disclosing last week that inflation in consumer goods and 
services was rising at just 6% a year, gave the patient a new lease on life. 
</P>
<P>
The only trouble is that the financial markets, in looking at the silver 
lining, failed to see the cloud. 
</P>
<P>
The official explanation of why stocks rallied brilliantly last week was that 
the government, when it reported that the nation's consumer price index rose 
0.5% in March, made Wall Street feel a little better than it had been feeling, 
although it didn't cure the disease. That, the stock market concluded, was 
worth a nearly 42-point jump in the Dow Jones industrial average on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
There are a lot experts who don't feel the same way about the latest inflation 
figures. Rising prices, they say, are still very troublesome, even if March's 
rate wasn't a blockbuster. And eventually, these experts predict, the financial 
markets will pay dearly. 
</P>
<P>
"The number released last week shows inflation rising at a rate of 6% in the 
first quarter," says Rudolf Thumberg, economist with Ried Thumberg, a Westport, 
Conn., financial research firm that tracks the Federal Reserve Board. "I would 
say (the Fed) is not thrilled and almost certainly worried" about the latest 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has expressed a dedication toward fighting 
inflation and has called 4.5% annual inflation unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the inflation situation even more troubling to some experts is the 
fact that March's number did not include a steep rise in the price of gasoline 
-- about 10 cents a gallon since late March. When gasoline prices start seeping 
into the consumer price index, the experts say inflation will certainly be 
aggravated. The higher inflation numbers that are expected in the months ahead 
could lead, the experts believe, to another boost in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
If you didn't have your ear to the ground last week, you never would have 
figured out why Vista Chemical Co. was one of the hottest stocks on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, Vista looked like any other company that trotted out its 
executives before a group of analysts to make some optimistic predictions. The 
only difference was that Vista's stock soared before and after the Tuesday 
meeting in New York, and the cause of the activity wasn't the record per-share 
profits that the company was predicting. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, analysts were chattering over the grapevine about how Vista, a 
Houston-based specialty chemical company that one follower said is "intensely 
worried about a takeover," was getting set to announce a special dividend. The 
rumor even had a price: $30 a share, or about half what the company's shares 
were selling for on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
Vista would only say that it wants to enhance shareholder values -- it calls it 
a mission -- but wouldn't be specific. 
</P>
<P>
What do analysts think about the talk of a windfall dividend? They wouldn't be 
surprised. Vista, they said, is intent on remaining independent and isn't 
afraid to borrow money toward that goal. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing in dispute, the analysts say, is when the company will take 
aggressive action such as a special dividend. Most say there isn't any hurry. 
</P>
<P>
A usually reliable Wall Street source says Pennzoil's stock portfolio these 
days includes big -- but not big enough to disclose -- stakes in Lubrizol 
Corp., Santa Fe Southern, Kerr-McGee Corp. and USX Corp. as well as Burlington 
Resources. Will any of these become the target of a takeover by Pennzoil? Who 
knows, the source says . . . 
</P>
<P>
Not all of America's foreign trading partners are in favor of higher interest 
rates. While the West Germans raised interest rates late last week, the 
Japanese are said to be afraid that higher rates in the U.S. will boost the 
value of the dollar. This, in turn, will increase America's trade deficit and 
cause a revival of protectionist trade legislation in Washington . 
</P>
<P>
Demand for chief executives rose sharply in the first quarter, according to 
Korn/Ferry International, the management search firm. It said demand for all 
executives was strongest on the East Coast, but hiring in the West and 
Southeast was down . . .

A HEARING FOR THE HAWK; 
</P>
<P>
MINDS AT WAR NUCLEAR REALITY AND THE INNER CONFLICTS OF DEFENSE POLICYMAKERS BY 
STEVEN KULL (BASIC BOOKS: $19.95; 341 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Andrew Bard Schmookler, Schmookler is the author of Out of Weakness: Healing 
the Wounds That Drive Us to War (Bantam Books). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The difficult challenges of the nuclear age have created deep divisions in 
America over how to protect our country. Hawks attack doves as naive and weak 
and are attacked in turn for playing macho games that could destroy the planet. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Kull has set out to bridge this gulf of mutual recrimination. In large 
measure, he has succeeded. Through a number of interviews, conducted with 
considerable intelligence and sensitivity, the author -- a dove -- has explored 
the thinking of hawkish nuclear policymakers. The result is a book that will 
teach hawks as well as doves a great deal. Kull himself, however, remaining too 
attached to his dovish preconceptions, has not learned all that his respondents 
had to teach him. 
</P>
<P>
Kull identifies two streams in contemporary military thinking. One, which he 
calls the "adaptive" stream, recognizes that nuclear weapons have wrought a 
profound change in the military relations between states. The other, the 
"traditional" stream, "resists the notion that the condition of mutual 
vulnerability implies a fundamental change in the way the United States relates 
to military force." 
</P>
<P>
To Kull, it is clear that the adaptive stream is "motivated by security 
interests." As for the traditional stream, however, "it is harder to understand 
how some persisting traditional policies serve security"; and this is just the 
mystery that Kull, in this impressive book, tries to solve: Why do many 
intelligent and humane people, entrusted with our national defense, formulate 
policies as if the atomic bomb were just another weapon? 
</P>
<P>
Do these policymakers simply not understand what Kull calls "nuclear reality"? 
No, he says: On one level at least, these people understand full well the ways 
that nuclear weapons cannot be used for self-protection like previous weapons. 
Yet, knowing this, they pretend not to know. With great lucidity, Kull 
discloses these "minds at war," investigating the meaning of the persistent 
contradictions in their thinking. 
</P>
<P>
One contradiction concerns their insistence on matching the Soviets at every 
level, even though they recognize that militarily there is such a thing as 
overkill. 
</P>
<P>
Another contradiction involves the idea of winning a nuclear war. Even though, 
when pressed, Kull's respondents often concede that victory in a nuclear 
exchange probably means nothing, they persist in making plans as if 
"advantageous termination" were possible. 
</P>
<P>
In each case, Kull's respondents "shifted back and forth between recognizing 
nuclear reality and supporting inconsistent policies with little apparent 
awareness of the inconsistency." 
</P>
<P>
Kull is certainly right that there is much irrationality in this. The theater 
of weaponry is sometimes used to enact dramas of self-reassurance unconnected 
with objective security needs. As one of the interviewees says, 
"Self-confidence comes from sources that are not wholly rational." So our sense 
of security may require weapons that are objectively unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
Another respondent admits that merely saying that we would "not lose wasn't 
strong enough" to make Americans feel a sense of competitive vigor. This 
contributed to policies for "prevailing" in a nuclear conflict. There is a 
strong temptation for military men to ignore nuclear reality: They don't like 
these weapons, says one, "because they prevent us from getting on our horses 
and shroving our lances and charging the enemy." 
</P>
<P>
The Star Wars program seems particularly founded upon irration-ality, denying 
the reality of our vulnerability. "Somewhere in the American viscera," a former 
Pentagon official tells Kull, "we don't want to believe that some 
son-of-a-bitch on the other side can destroy us." 
</P>
<P>
But Kull oversimplifies when he assumes all these contradictory policies to be 
maladaptive. The problem lies in his holding too simple a view of the nuclear 
reality, and thus of what it takes to adapt to it. 
</P>
<P>
Doves like to quote Einstein's statement that nuclear weapons have changed 
"everything but our way of thinking." But not everything has changed. Nations 
still confront each other, unprotected, in an anarchic system. Disputes are 
still resolved and vital interests still protected by the threat and use of raw 
power. 
</P>
<P>
The new weapons and the old struggle are both part of nuclear reality. One may 
not adapt to the one and disregard the other. The absolute importance of 
preventing total war between the superpowers is unprecedented. But there can be 
dovish as well as hawkish fallacies on how to keep the peace. 
</P>
<P>
What does it take to deter an adversary? This requires a psychological, not a 
purely logical, answer. Some doves talk of minimal deterrence, as if logic 
dictates that a certain number of warheads will deter attack. But for one 
adversary, one warhead might be enough, while another might attack in the face 
of a million. 
</P>
<P>
Our warriors have had to adapt to a situation fraught with contradictions. The 
Cold War required them to deter aggression. Deterrence has required them to 
threaten credibly to use weapons whose only rational use is as a bluff. 
Paradoxically, reason can require us to appear prepared to do the unreasonable, 
for what is rational about a nation in its death throes pulling its foe down 
with it into the grave? 
</P>
<P>
Acting "as if" we thought nuclear war could be won, the strategic community 
came to believe, "was necessary for our deterrent to attain its credibility." 
There is strategic value, Kull was told, "in being perceived by the adversary 
as not fully grasping the significance of nuclear reality." And conceivably, 
just pretending to believe what we know is not true may not be persuasive 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
The "mind at war" reflects two sides of nuclear reality: We can't use these 
weapons, and we have to appear not to know that. Thus, the contradictions to 
which Kull objects may be not a failure to adapt but a true adaptation to a 
reality fraught with paradox. 
</P>
<P>
Kull is thoroughly familiar with these arguments. But, strangely, he never 
refutes or even confronts them. His own assumptions about adaptation to nuclear 
reality seem to go unquestioned. That "these policies reflect resistance to 
fully addressing nuclear war and its fundamental implication" he never doubts. 
But, if making credible an incredible threat has been necessary, can we be sure 
that policies dictated wholly by what Kull calls "adaptive" thinking would have 
kept us secure? 
</P>
<P>
Of course, our cold warriors -- in their fearfulness and bellicosity -- may 
have exaggerated the requirements of a credible deterrent. I believe they have. 
But we are not justified in assuming, as Kull seems to, that the policies of 
traditionalists are dictated by motives in conflict with security. 
</P>
<P>
True empathy between hawks and doves requires that we acknowledge that, with so 
much uncertainty and so much at stake, it has been extraordinarily difficult to 
know what posture would protect our security best. 
</P>
<P>
The Cold War was surely dangerously maladaptive for humankind as a whole. But 
that does not prove that a more adaptive course was available to a single actor 
such as the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as the Soviet Union changes its posture, a deterrence based more on 
cooperation than threat may become possible. If American thinking on nuclear 
defense now becomes more "adaptive" and less "traditional," this would not 
necessarily be, as Kull assumes, the recognition of an unchanging "nuclear 
reality." Rather, the emergence of a new reality may allow better means of 
adaptation.

AMERICA AND RUSSIA: WHY HAVEN'T WE FOUGHT?; 
</P>
<P>
RETREAT FROM DOOMSDAY THE OBSOLESCENCE OF MAJOR WAR BY JOHN MUELLER (BASIC 
BOOKS:$20.95; 313 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Marvin Seid, Seid is a Times editorial writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
"On May 15, 1984, the major countries of the developed world had managed to 
remain at peace with each other for the longest continuous stretch of time 
since the days of the Roman Empire." The achievement of this happy and steadily 
extended record, writes John Mueller, was no mere matter of luck, nor was it 
the product of a restraint imposed by a balance of nuclear terror. Rather it 
marked another step in a historical process that began several centuries ago 
when lesser European powers like Holland, Sweden and Switzerland concluded that 
war was really a stupid, repulsive and futile enterprise, and determined to do 
their best not to have anything more to do with it. Since then the conviction 
seems to have spread among an increasing number of developed countries that, 
contrary to the general view of preceding millenniums, war isn't one of life's 
necessities. War certainly has not become obsolete or unthinkable. But for the 
developed nations that have the most to lose from war's destructiveness it has, 
argues Mueller, become "rationally unthinkable." 
</P>
<P>
The provocative idea that major war may increasingly be regarded as no less 
absurd and intolerable than dueling, slavery, bearbaiting or human sacrifice is 
enormously appealing. It's also a conclusion that would seem to be supported 
(if not proven) by the long peace that has prevailed among the major powers 
since the end of World War II. That war, Mueller believes, may in fact come to 
be seen as the war that ended wars, at least where the world's better-off 
countries are concerned. Since 1945 there have been no wars among the 44 
nations with the highest per capita wealth, with the single brief exception of 
the Soviet Union's invasion of Hungary in 1956. "Never before in history have 
so many well-armed, important countries spent so much time not using their arms 
against each other." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the United States and the Soviet Union have gone to war since 1945, 
not against each other, but with results that seem to have forced them to 
reassess their ideas about expansionism and containment, and about where 
national interests truly lie. The Korean War, launched nearly 40 years ago by 
the Communist north with the support of the Soviet Union and China, provoked a 
response that "ended any thought of flirting with . . . direct, over-the-border 
war as a method for advancing the international Communist cause." The bitter 
U.S. experience in Vietnam and the no less unhappy Soviet adventure in 
Afghanistan seem likely to keep the superpowers from intervening in the Third 
World for some time to come. 
</P>
<P>
The central question, though, is how the the United States and the Soviet Union 
have managed to steer clear of fighting each other despite the ample 
opportunities and provocations that have occurred since 1945, first over broken 
Soviet promises about the political future of Eastern Europe, later over 
Berlin, Korea, Cuba, the Middle East. The answer, says Mueller, is that 
well-publicized appearances to the contrary, the two countries have never been 
remotely close to direct conflict. Earlier international wars grew out of the 
conclusion of those who fought them that they were unavoidable and even 
desirable as a way to settle disputes. The United States and the Soviet Union, 
though, have simply never seen it in their interests to go to war. It didn't 
always seem that way at various times of crisis. Yet Mueller makes a plausible 
case for this conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
First, for all of Stalin's probing for Western weak spots and dedication to 
coercion and subversion, and for all of Khrushchev's bluster and 
missile-rattling, Soviet policy has consistently proven to be cautious and 
risk-averse. Even at the height of the Cuban missile crisis, for example, the 
Soviets avoided putting their armed forces on even a demonstration alert. Like 
the United States, the Soviets instead made plain they wanted to work out of 
the confrontation, not intensify it. Wars, says a military historian who has 
looked at every conflict since 1400, begin not by accident but because at least 
one side thinks it can gain something by fighting. That conclusion has been 
lacking in the U.S. -- Soviet confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
Mueller's provocative assessment is that nuclear weapons probably have had 
little to do with keeping the superpowers from direct conflict. Insofar as 
military deterrence has preserved the peace, he writes, the chief constraint 
has been the fear of escalation to the horribly destructive levels of World War 
I or World War II. As both wars showed, it doesn't require nuclear weapons to 
kill millions of people and reduce cities to rubble. The leaders of the Soviet 
Union, which suffered 20 million dead in World War II, can't be accused of 
always being peace-loving. But whatever the crises and bluster they have from 
time to time produced, they have been careful to act ultimately with prudence 
in their relations with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Is major war obsolescent, then? Mueller thinks the weight of evidence clearly 
points that way, although he stops short of saying such wars have become 
impossible. If, for example, Mikhail Gorbachev fails to get the Soviet economy 
working, it is not inconceivable that growing frustration could induce him or, 
more likely, his successors to turn to belligerency as a last resort. But that 
seems unlikely. The chief goal of most countries today is not to grab someone 
else's territory or reach for greater national glory, but to become more 
prosperous and raise living standards. War is now generally recognized in the 
developed world as an inefficient way to achieve prosperity. That, along with 
some promising signs of greater realism and mellowing in Gorbachev's Soviet 
Union, opens interesting prospects for arms control agreements and reduced 
military budgets. 
</P>
<P>
What is one to make of Mueller's analysis? It is self-evident that something 
has constrained the big powers from going to war with each other since 1945, 
despite plenty of chances to do so. Deducing just what considerations are 
responsible for that constraint must remain a matter of informed speculation, 
and all such speculation inevitably is open to argument. What can be said of 
"Retreat From Doomsday" is that Mueller argues his case very well indeed. 
Drawing on a vast literature, he has written a stimulating book, and a hopeful 
one.

RICHARD EDER: A MORRIS DANCE AT RUSSIAN EASTER; 
</P>
<P>
THE BEGINNING OF SPRING BY PENELOPE FITZGERALD (HENRY HOLT: $18.95; 183 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Richard Eder 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spring is most violent where winter is most implacable. The foreground of 
Penelope Fitzgerald's new novel, set in Russia in 1913, is the passage from a 
frozen March to the mud, snow-melt, prodigious budding and patchy blue of 
April. In the background is another changing weather: the erratic pulse of a 
revolution sprouting underneath the czarist ice. 
</P>
<P>
Between these two weathers wander Fitzgerald's comical innocents, an assortment 
of English expatriates living in St. Petersburg. Each has appropriated various 
bits of Russia and has got them, to various degrees, wrong. Their blithe myopia 
can't quite make out the unpredictable shifts of the Russians around them, 
caught in their tempestuous double equinox. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald is one of the most gifted and elusive of living English writers. She 
writes with humor and an apparently gentle absurdity; there is something grave 
behind. Her books are archaic smiles, the corners turned down, devoid neither 
of compassion nor of distance. 
</P>
<P>
Her theme is the English theme; which always and ever is that of a world in 
decline. Fitzgerald's decline lies not in politics, economics or morals, but in 
a dwindling sense of reality. She will place her English in houseboats, as in 
"Offshore," or abroad, as in this book and in "Innocents," set in Italy. They 
never quite touch ground. 
</P>
<P>
The Russians in "The Coming of Spring" move with a sense of incipient tragedy, 
though they can be very funny while doing it. The English interpret the ground 
tremors not as tragedy but as unreliability. 
</P>
<P>
The grave comedy of "Spring" centers around Frank Reid, the most innocent of 
the expatriates. He is a good and just man, but he is always catching up with 
what is going on. He is neither weak nor foolish; it's simply that the world at 
the turning of the seasons is moving faster and worse than he is. 
</P>
<P>
Everything eludes him. He comes home one day from the printing factory he 
inherited from his father to find a messenger sipping tea in his kitchen. The 
messenger has been summoned to pick up a letter for him from his wife, Nellie. 
Frank is told why a messenger is needed to deliver a letter within the same 
house. He gets a reasonable answer, but it is the reasonableness of "Alice in 
Wonderland." 
</P>
<P>
Nellie writes that she has left with their three children. A theatrical 
approach being expected by the servants, Frank makes a dramatic announcement of 
the news. Theatrically, they weep and exclaim, although they have just helped 
her pack. 
</P>
<P>
The following morning he gets a phone call from the station master, a friend. 
The three children have been sent back, along with a clothes basket. There is a 
note of reproach in the station-master's voice, also in the demeanor of the 
horse-cab driver whom Frank asks to wait at the station. Also in the attitude 
of Dolly, the oldest of the children. 
</P>
<P>
Annie, the youngest, had been impossibly restless on the train. It was hard on 
Nellie. "You shouldn't have expected her to manage by herself," Dolly scolds 
him. "She had to send her back; we weren't a comfort to her." It is another of 
Fitzgerald's odd and oddly intoxicating displacements. It is also intensely 
touching; a child who shifts the blame to her father because she trusts him. 
</P>
<P>
Why Nellie has left and where she has gone is a mystery until the end of the 
book. It is not a mystery anyone bothers much about; the real question is how 
Frank and the children will manage. The question serves to introduce an 
assortment of characters offering consolation or help. 
</P>
<P>
There is Selwyn, Frank's English assistant. He writes poetry, wears a Russian 
peasant blouse under his frock coat and is a disciple of Tolstoy. Tolstoy tells 
him he is boring but not to mind about it. 
</P>
<P>
Selwyn will go through various transformations; the lack of clarity about just 
what he is up to moves along the book's slender plot. He begins by telling 
Frank that his loss is a cause for rejoicing. "No it's not," Frank replies. 
"What a good man," one of the servants says of Selwyn afterwards. "Always on 
his way from one place to another searching out want and despair." 
</P>
<P>
Mystic Russia, courtesy of Selwyn, is one of Frank's crosses. Another is the 
hearty and marginally sincere embrace of Kuryatin, a friend and business 
associate. Kuryatin takes the children into his household but the arrangement 
lasts barely an afternoon. A pet bear is given vodka, smashes up the dining 
room and catches fire when a servant throws burning coals over him. 
</P>
<P>
Water would have been of no use, Ben, Frank's son, instructs his father as he 
is taken home. Bears like water, he explains; fire was necessary. Even his 
children are ahead of Frank. 
</P>
<P>
Another offer comes from the wife of the English chaplain. She has a spare 
governess who has fled the chaos of a Russian country estate. The woman is too 
depressing, though; the children will never accept her. 
</P>
<P>
"Miss Kinsman was dowdy," Fitzgerald writes, "another of the words that 
couldn't be translated into Russian, because there was no way of suggesting a 
dismal unfashionableness which was not intentional, not slovenly, not 
disreputable but simply Miss Kinsman's way of looking like herself." 
</P>
<P>
Selwyn produces Lisa, a young woman from the country whom he claims to have met 
weeping at the handkerchief counter of the local department store. Frank hires 
her as governess and falls in love. But she is connected with the underground; 
before long, she has to flee the country. Here as always, Selwyn's role is 
unfathomable. 
</P>
<P>
A whole tangle of elusive schemes and subplots takes shape around Frank. The 
secret police appear, the printing press is in danger, and spring advances more 
and more disruptively. 
</P>
<P>
Frank sees, but only dimly. He is not a dim man, though, in fact, he is a kind 
of patient hero. If his sight is fuzzy, it is a comic English fuzziness, but it 
is also something more. The world is shifting in its cloud of unreliability, 
and the dust gets in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald has written a lovely book; a comedy lit by writing so precise and 
lilting that it can make you shiver, and an elegy that nods at what passes 
without lamentation or indifference.

THE WOLF THAT ATE SAN FRANCISCO; 
</P>
<P>
WOLFGANG PUCK DOESN'T HAVE TO CALL ALICE WATERS LONG-DISTANCE ANYMORE

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Midnight and the bar is packed. Wolfgang Puck is drinking Champagne in his 
brand-new restaurant and looking around with a bemused smile. Isn't this the 
city that sleeps? Why aren't all these people in bed? Just then a man walks up, 
taps him on the shoulder and says: "I'm from L.A., but I've been living in San 
Francisco. I'm just so glad to finally see some L.A. style up here." 
</P>
<P>
But you don't have to be from L.A. to love Puck's new place. Postrio is the 
toast of the town. 
</P>
<P>
And everybody seems surprised. They shouldn't be: Puck hasn't missed yet. First 
Spago went global when it opened in Tokyo. Then Puck branched out and opened 
Chinois in Santa Monica. His assault on the supermarket came next as the 
Wolfgang Puck Food Co. started manufacturing frozen pizzas and desserts for 
home consumption. Puck's got cookbooks and videos, a regular slot on 
television's "Good Morning America" -- and two new restaurants in the works. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, Malibu residents will be able to stop commuting to Spago when 
Granita opens at the beach. He's even got the beer bunch in mind: Puck is a 
partner in the Los Angeles Brewing Co. which will open this fall in West Los 
Angeles. But all that's in the future: Right now Puck and his partners are 
pursuing San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was gonna have to beg people to come in," says Puck. "I thought 
we'd do about 50, 60 dinners to start. I was so apprehensive. You know how 
people in San Francisco hate Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, they hate it so much that at the ripe old age of one week Postrio was 
already being hailed in the San Francisco Chronicle as a "masterpiece." Hate it 
so much that Puck has become a local celebrity. Hate it so much that Postrio, 
in Puck's words, "is a nightmare. It's worse than Spago. It's already booked 
through June." 
</P>
<P>
What is going on here? San Franciscans have traditionally turned up their noses 
at Los Angeles. They think that everything about their city -- the air, the 
ambiance, the scenery -- is better than it is down south. And when it comes to 
food, Los Angeles can't touch San Francisco. Just ask any San Franciscan. So 
why is San Francisco eating up Puck's new restaurant? 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco restaurateurs would certainly like to know. "Why is it," asked 
one, "that some guy can blow in from out of town, open a place and get all the 
media attention and rave reviews right out of the box? Some of us have to work 
for years before we get any notice at all. What's Puck got that we haven't?" 
</P>
<P>
"Glitz," says San Francisco Chronicle food editor Michael Bauer. "People here 
are starved for that bit of glitz that Wolf is bringing with him." 
</P>
<P>
'I should have worn my gold lame," says one diner, looking wistfully at the 
impressive stairway by which Postrio's diners make their entrance. "I've never 
had a place to wear it before." She's got a place now -- and San Francisco 
residents are reveling in it. The stairway is a dramatic device that offers 
everybody the opportunity to be a star. People dress up just to come sweeping 
down the stairs, pausing in mid-flight to survey the room -- and let the room 
survey them. "Everybody in the restaurant looks like they came from L.A." is 
what people in San Francisco say. 
</P>
<P>
The glitz factor is shared by the room itself. And this despite the fact that 
it was not designed by Puck's wife, Barbara Lazaroff, but by San Francisco 
designer Pat Kuleto (who is also responsible for the Fog City Diner). He has 
employed a ribbon motif that threads its way through the rug, down the stairs 
and, without interruption, right onto the marble floor. Brass ribbons on the 
banisters and on the huge, luminous light fixtures pick up the theme. The room 
is so wrapped up in glittering ribbons that it looks like one great big 
birthday present to the city of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The art is pretty glitzy, too. This is not your ordinary restaurant mood stuff. 
A significant Sam Francis adorns one wall. An enormous Rauschenberg is splashed 
across the other. How did they come by such major works? "Oh," says Puck 
nonchalantly, "I called Bob (Rauschenberg) up and asked if he had something I 
could use for that wall. He said: 'You're a friend, I'll make something.' Now 
I'm afraid to call and find out what it costs." 
</P>
<P>
This is heady stuff for a town where people still strut around the streets in 
Birkenstocks. But Postrio isn't all glitz; the people who come here may dress 
like stars -- but their tastes are very down to earth. "People in San Francisco 
eat and drink a lot more than they do in L.A.," says Anne Gingrass, the former 
Spago chef who now shares the position of head chef at Postrio with her 
husband, David. "People sit down and eat all evening. Three- and four-course 
meals are common." They not only eat more -- they eat differently. "We sell 
things here," says David, "that you couldn't sell in L.A. to save your life." 
</P>
<P>
That may be, but if you've been to Spago, there's not much on this menu that 
will come as a surprise. Before the restaurant opened, Puck went around saying 
that the food at Postrio would be "updated San Francisco classics." He must 
have changed his mind, for this food is unadulterated L.A. -- pretty pure Spago 
with a pinch of Chinois thrown in for good measure. The biggest seller is the 
Chinese style duck; a spicy mango sauce barely differentiates it from the one 
that's served at Spago. The lobster with fried spinach leaves closely resembles 
a dish that's served at Chinois, and appetizers include a very familiar 
marinated tuna with avocado and a lime ginger vinaigrette. There are, of 
course, the designer pizzas, including Puck's signature "Jewish pizza" topped 
with smoked salmon, creme fraiche and golden caviar. San Franciscans like the 
pizzas so much that, despite the fact that they are sold only in the bar, they 
are selling at the rate of 200 a day. 
</P>
<P>
Sausages sell well too. Postrio makes lamb sausage for the pizzas, duck sausage 
with pistachios for a lunch entree, sweet herb sausage for pastas and 
home-cured salami for an appetizer plate. "We never sold much sausage at 
Spago," says David Gingrass, "people down there don't eat anything with 
saturated fat. But here we sell so much sausage that I had to hire one guy just 
to make it. Veal, on the other hand, which sells well in L.A., you can't sell 
at all in San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, though, it seems as if there is nothing that Wolfgang Puck can't 
sell to San Francisco. People are here at 7 a.m. gobbling up homemade corned 
beef hash, Hangtown Fry, buttermilk pancakes with blueberries. And they are 
still here at midnight eating desserts and pizzas. Is Puck really surprised? 
</P>
<P>
Probably not. Long before he even thought of opening a restaurant in San 
Francisco he said, "You know, sometimes publicists call up and want to know if 
I want them to work for me. I ask them how much they'll pay me. 'No,' they say, 
'you don't understand, you pay me.' I say, no they're the ones who don't 
understand. Think how good it would be for a publicist to say that he worked 
for us. It would make his business." Nobody understands the meaning of 
celebrity better than Wolfgang Puck. 
</P>
<P>
Now he says, "The thing about San Francisco is that they're more star-struck 
here than anywhere." Puck's genius lies in being the first to recognize this 
fact. Just as he was the first to recognize that people in Los Angeles were 
tired of stuffy French restaurants. When Puck opened Spago, he changed the way 
Los Angeles goes out to eat. And now he's out to do the same for San Francisco. 
"He's added a whole different personality to the San Francisco dining scene," 
says the Chronicle's Bauer, "and I think it's going to have a major effect 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Just now the restaurant is only a couple of weeks old. And at the moment 
Wolfgang Puck does not look like anybody who is anxious to have a major effect 
on anything. It is 1 a.m., he has been at the restaurant since 8 a.m. -- and he 
looks tired. "I must be getting old," he says, "I never used to get tired." He 
looks around the room, shakes his head -- and remembers that they start serving 
breakfast in six hours. "We even do a big breakfast business," he laments. 
</P>
<P>

S.F.? Pages 98, 99.

FILMING ON A KILLING GROUND;

<P>
'TRIUMPH OF THE SPIRIT' IS THE FIRST FILM TO BE SHOT ALMOST ENTIRELY AT THE 
AUSCHWITZ DEATH CAMP

AUSCHWITZ, Poland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Willem Dafoe is in the ring, sweating furiously, bleeding from a cut over his 
left eye, and trading real blows. He's facing a German fighter who's already 
sent him tumbling through the ropes and onto the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Determined, he climbs back in -- and retaliates. The furious exchange is capped 
off when Dafoe lets loose a knockout punch -- and the kiss-off line, "Auf 
Wiedersehen, (expletive)." 
</P>
<P>
At 145 pounds -- 10 pounds lighter than normal -- the 5-foot-9 actor is looking 
lean and mean. Because of his shaved head, his chiseled features are even more 
prominent than usual. 
</P>
<P>
He's been delivering -- and receiving -- punches in a smoky officers' club, 
where banners with swastikas and a large portrait of Adolf Hitler hang on the 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
Seated to one side of the ring is an audience of 14 SS officers, 4 
noncommissioned officers, 11 SS women, 90 German soldiers and 3 waiters. 
</P>
<P>
Like Dafoe and his "German opponent" -- actually fight trainer Teddy Atlas -- 
they've been here all morning, cheering and taunting the action in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
This scene completed, they briefly disassemble during a break. 
</P>
<P>
The next shot will be set up in the building that has been used as a storeroom 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, it was the laundry for Konzentrationslager Auschwitz -- Nazi 
Germany's largest concentration and extermination camp. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Outside, where it's rainy, gloomy and cold -- typical for Polish weather this 
time of year -- some SS soldiers are exchanging small talk as they clutch cups 
of gritty black coffee and await their call to the set. 
</P>
<P>
They draw stares from the occasional tourists who wander by. Some are so shaken 
by the sight of the uniformed men and women that they can't hide their anger. 
</P>
<P>
One East German Jew, wearing a yarmulka, is so distraught by the discovery of 
"Nazis" at Auschwitz, that he begins shouting in anger. Crew members rush to 
reassure him that this is only a movie. 
</P>
<P>
"Triumph of the Spirit" is the first major motion picture to film almost 
entirely on location at the infamous death camp. Access was made possible with 
the assistance of the government-owned Poltel (Polish Television). Shooting has 
been under way since February. 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks since, Auschwitz seems to have been temporarily transported back 
in time. 
</P>
<P>
There are "prisoners" in striped pants, jackets and caps lumbering along the 
road that leads into Auschwitz, and "SS men" strolling beneath the camp 
entrance, famed for its cynical proclamation, "Arbeit Macht Frei" (Work Makes 
You Free). 
</P>
<P>
Several laughing crew members related an incident involving two extras who wore 
their SS uniforms to a local bar one night and got drunk. The film company got 
a phone call from the police. The carousers were going to spend the night in 
jail; did the film people want to send someone over to pick up the uniforms? 
</P>
<P>
At the steps of the notorious Cell Block 11, shouts of "Sieg Heil!" can be 
heard from the laundry building-film set, located just 35 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
Cell Block 11 is where the gas, Cyclon B, was first "tested" on 850 Russian 
prisoners of war and ill inmates in September, 1941. The cell block also is 
fitted with underground suffocation and starvation cells. It adjoins what 
prisoners called the Wall of Death -- where some 20,000 executions took place. 
</P>
<P>
It was surreal to explore its rooms and cells at the same time as young 
uniformed SS men, actors with their hands tucked casually into the pockets of 
their tailored costumes. 
</P>
<P>
And to have lunch with the cast and crew at the neighboring death camp, 
Birkenau. 
</P>
<P>
Equally surreal: Poles -- most of whom lost ancestors at the camps -- are 
playing Germans. 
</P>
<P>
Looking down at her "SS woman" uniform, extra Dorota Biaty-Wieczorek (who is 
also a translator for the film), said that her mother-in-law and her husband's 
grandmother had been imprisoned at the camps. "I should be playing a prisoner," 
she said. "But, I am also an actress. So I must try to imagine what it would 
have been like to be on the other side." 
</P>
<P>
It was odd, too, to see Dafoe in the midst of a rigorous workout in the midst 
of the former concentration camp. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, boxing is a metaphor for this story of survival -- inspired by the 
real-life story of Salamo Arouch. 
</P>
<P>
A Jew from the Greek village of Salonika, Arouch was the middleweight boxing 
champion of the Balkans. Then the Nazis came to his village. And Arouch -- and 
his family and friends -- were sent to Auschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
When the SS learned who he was, they put him in the ring -- against other 
prisoners. Known for his footwork that garnered him the nickname, "The 
Ballerina," Arouch fought here -- and won -- 200 times. 
</P>
<P>
Arouch, who today owns a successful transport company in Israel, is a 
consultant for the movie and he has returned to the camp for the first time to 
work on it. 
</P>
<P>
Dafoe, who has been sticking to a strict training regimen, is playing Arouch. 
Robert Loggia plays his father, Poppa Arouch. Edward James Olmos is the Gypsy, 
a capo who cruelly assists the Nazis in keeping the prisoners in line. Wendy 
Gazelle is Allegra, the young Greek woman Arouch loves. Her story of survival 
in the camp will parallel his. 
</P>
<P>
Robert M. Young, who last did "Dominick and Eugene," is directing. Arnold 
Kopelson, who produced "Platoon" -- which also starred Dafoe -- is co-producing 
and also overseeing production. 
</P>
<P>
Kopelson admits he tried -- and failed -- to interest the major studios in the 
project. Independently financed, "Triumph" does not yet have a U.S. 
distributor. 
</P>
<P>
Kopelson doesn't appear to be worried. "Platoon" also had difficulties finding 
financing and distribution. 
</P>
<P>
"The studios didn't want that movie because they didn't think audiences wanted 
to see a story about Vietnam," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now they think audiences don't want to see a movie about the concentration 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is, the studios don't know what we're doing out here. They think 
we're making a movie about death. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't know that we're making a movie about life." 
</P>
<P>
Between 1940 and 1945, 4 million people from 24 countries perished at 
Auschwitz, the main camp, and Birkenau, located 3 kilometers away, also known 
as Auschwitz II and by its Polish name, Brzezinka. 
</P>
<P>
 But, insist the film makers, this is not a movie about the Holocaust. The 
setting will not envelop the story. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't dealing with the deaths of 11 million people (6 million of them 
Jews), we're dealing with the lives of a man, his family and the woman he 
loves," said Kopelson. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining that the film will not graphically detail the atrocities that 
occurred here, Kopelson added: "We are dealing with an incredibly fine line. We 
are dealing with the truth, yet not assaulting the truth." 
</P>
<P>
In the story line, Dafoe's boxing opponents face death in the gas chambers if 
they lose. 
</P>
<P>
"There are moral choices involved," said Young, who described "Triumph" as 
"kind of a pilgrim's progress. By that, I mean a journey that a man takes where 
he becomes a witness to the human spirit in torment -- where people become more 
than they ever were and people become less than they ever imagined they could 
be." 
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the characters have no control over where the fates have put 
them, Young described a scene of foreshadowing that he feels is a key to the 
movie: It's set in Greece, before the villagers have been sent to the camp. 
Arouch and Allegra have stolen away to be together at a movie theater. "And as 
they sit there, there's a newsreel going on with clips of the Third Reich. 
</P>
<P>
"These are two very attractive people we can identify with. But, the world 
won't leave them alone." 
</P>
<P>
If the cast and crew is determined to not allow their story to be dominated by 
Auschwitz, many have become deeply affected by the location. 
</P>
<P>
Young tells of walking through fields at Birkenau and coming upon thousands of 
victims' utensils on the ground. They had once been stored with the rest of the 
</P>
<P>
victims' belongings in what was known as the Canada Unit. "There were rusted 
plates and thousands of utensils. All these forks. . . . People came here 
thinking they were starting a new life, you know? 
</P>
<P>
"And these forks, this may sound melodramatic, but, they're all twisted and 
bent like ghosts in these gentle kinds of poses. They look like they're 
weeping." 
</P>
<P>
Olmos makes a near-daily pilgrimage to Birkenau -- sometimes by himself, 
sometimes with Israeli crew members. 
</P>
<P>
"We say prayers over the crematorium pits," he said, adding, "It's not 
difficult to come to this place. You come here to pay homage. It's like going 
to church." 
</P>
<P>
Loggia has been so moved by the experience that, in his hotel room in the 
neighboring city of Katowice, he's created a "sculpture" with burned barbed 
wire and rocks collected from near the crematorium. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been life-changing for me. I really don't what what I'll do after 
this. It's as if the whole course of my life is dammed up at the moment," said 
Loggia. 
</P>
<P>
"Being here is special," Dafoe admitted. "It gets you closer to the ghosts. 
They do creep up on you, I think." 
</P>
<P>
He recalled his first visit to Auschwitz: "I expected some sort of enormous 
emotional reaction. But instead, I was, frankly, quite numb. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just no way you can take it in when you first see it." 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Dafoe -- like many of his colleagues -- was immersing himself in 
the personal histories of survivors. "I'd read them before I went to bed at 
night. And somewhere between the depression of being in Poland -- which is a 
very gray place -- and the combination of the readings and my own imagination, 
I'd go to sleep and get everything mixed up. 
</P>
<P>
"Occasionally, I'd wake up in a cold sweat." 
</P>
<P>
Dafoe hastened to add that that was then. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, to some degree, you become familiar with it and it becomes where 
you work. It becomes a movie set." 
</P>
<P>
"This is above and beyond a film location," said Loggia. 
</P>
<P>
Scenes have been filmed of people lined up outside the gas chamber. The cameras 
have gone inside the crematorium. One snowy night at Birkenau, the cameras 
captured the arrival of a train bringing Arouch and his family to Auschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
Located in the village of Oswiecim (the Nazis changed the name to Auschwitz), 
just 34 miles west of Krakow, Auschwitz-Birkenau is today a state museum. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 600,000 visitors come here annually. 
</P>
<P>
Auschwitz has a visitor's center, exhibits in cell blocks -- including Cell 
Block 11 (the prison that existed within Auschwitz) -- a gas chamber and 
crematorium. 
</P>
<P>
At Birkenau -- which sprawls out over a staggering 10 square miles -- there are 
barracks, the ruins of four crematoria, cremation pyres, a pond containing the 
ashes of countless victims, the platform where deportees were subjected to 
"selektion" (selection), and the International Monument to the Victims of 
Fascism, which was built in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
A veritable death factory, Birkenau's crematoriums had a combined capacity of 
4,456 corpses daily. Because the gas chambers had an even greater killing 
capacity, corpses were also burned in pyres and buried in pits. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to find bone fragments in the fields of Birkenau. 
</P>
<P>
To make the movie "feel" as real as its austere and monumental setting, the 
production has employed a number of consultants, like Arouch, who still weeps 
when he vividly recounts experiences from his two-and-a-half years in the camp. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining that his wife, who is also an Auschwitz survivor, would not make the 
trip with him, Arouch said that he couldn't sleep for the first week after his 
return, "because everything came back." 
</P>
<P>
Survivor/consultant Tadeusz Sobolewicz today lives just 17 kilometers from the 
camp where he was interned for almost three years. Author of a book about his 
Auschwitz experiences, "Wytrzymalem Wiec Jestem" ("I'm Still Alive"), he said 
that for many years he "kept his distance" from Auschwitz. "With these hands, I 
took people -- dead people -- from the hospital to the crematorium . . . that 
is what I did with these hands." Now he works with the museum -- and wanders 
around the camp. 
</P>
<P>
Teddy Atlas, who worked with the late Cus D'Amato training Mike Tyson, was 
there for Dafoe. 
</P>
<P>
Surveying the nearby cell blocks, Atlas said, "This movie gets right down to 
the fact that life ain't fair. And this place -- this place was the most unfair 
of them all. 
</P>
<P>
"But in a ring, life is fair. It's man against man -- with rules. So this 
boxing is a little bit of fairness in an unfair world." 
</P>
<P>
Known for meticulously tackling his roles, Olmos worked with a group of gypsy 
consultants who helped him with a special song he performs in Romany, language 
of the gypsies. 
</P>
<P>
"All the gypsies of the world will understand what I'm singing," said Olmos, 
who revealed that the lyrics tell the Nazis "to go to hell, to rot and die -- 
and that sort of thing." But the Nazis don't know what he's singing, "because 
I'm doing the lines with a smile on my face." 
</P>
<P>
His is a colorful role -- involving theatrics on the stage of the SS officers' 
club. (Olmos implored a writer not to give away the details of his club act.) 
His character is also complex; he has chosen to work for the Nazis, in order to 
live. 
</P>
<P>
But, stressed Olmos, "This is not the story of a gypsy in a concentration camp. 
It's Salamo's story. So I've had to ask that some of my scenes be cut. 
</P>
<P>
"The challenge here is to not overdevelop the part. And to keep perspective on 
the story we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
Loggia described the filming of the train's arrival, that night in Birkenau: 
"It was snowing, there were hundreds and hundreds of extras. We had on frayed 
clothes and our Jewish stars and had to jump from the box cars. And we were 
freezing. 
</P>
<P>
"We re-created that scene -- we didn't act it." 
</P>
<P>
Added Loggia: "We have really bitten the bullet on this. Because with this 
movie, if you start to do any (expletive) acting out there, other than just 
dealing with the cold and the craziness of the situation, you're going to look 
phony. You'll be spotted as some fake by the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"The way (Bob) Young is making this movie, it's as if you're inside the vortex 
-- in the maelstrom. 
</P>
<P>
"This movie doesn't allow a German guy to smirk -- or do any of those numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the script originally depicted his character doing a Greek 
dance before being led to the gas chamber, Loggia said, "That scene would never 
work -- not the way we're doing this picture, now. I told them that's 'Zorba 
the Greek' time. That's Tony Quinn time. But it's not for me -- not here. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have a real Poppa in this picture." 
</P>
<P>
Kopelson first heard the story of Salamo Arouch in 1983. At that time, he 
declared, he made "an emotional commitment" to doing this picture. 
</P>
<P>
The project was brought to him by Shimon Arama, who has produced films in 
France and in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Arama, who researched and wrote the story that evolved into "Triumph," is 
co-producing with Kopelson. The $15-million production is the first film for 
Nova International Films -- of which Arama is president. 
</P>
<P>
Kopelson, who foresees a late-1989 release, refuses "to even think" that he 
might encounter problems finding a U.S. distributor. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you kidding? I'm looking at the dailies. I know what we've got. Listen, I 
have the same feeling with this film that I had with 'Platoon.' In fact, I have 
a greater feeling with this movie." 
</P>
<P>
"Platoon," the independently financed movie about Vietnam that the studios 
didn't think audiences would want to see, went on to win the 1986 Academy Award 
for best picture -- and to make about $250 million worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining that he once approached "Platoon" director Oliver Stone about doing 
this movie, Kopelson said, "In retrospect, while Oliver is brilliant, he's also 
very dark. He's gone through hell himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he'd have done the movie we're doing. 
</P>
<P>
"He might have been out there, bulldozing the bodies, going into those 
aspects." 
</P>
<P>
Under Young's direction, "Triumph" will not graphically explore "those aspects" 
of the concentration camps. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to hit viewers on the head," said Kopelson. 
</P>
<P>
But Kopelson is concerned about "whitewashing" the realities of Auschwitz. 
Especially the realities of the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
According to Kopelson, Sonderkommandos (the inmates who assisted in the camp 
killings) have described how the chambers were jammed so tight that naked 
inmates had to raise their hands. And then small children and babies were 
tossed in. 
</P>
<P>
The scenario has come to obsess Kopelson. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he wants it filmed. 
</P>
<P>
But Young -- whom Kopelson refers to as "Saint Bob" -- won't do it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to tell this story by staying very close to the characters and 
experiencing what happens to them. And then we lose them in the maze of people, 
then we find them again, then we lose them. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Added Young: "Think of Salamo as a cork bobbing on the surface of the sea in a 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
"The cork is covered with spume and it's tossed about. And once in a while it's 
tossed up in the air and, for a moment, you get in some awesome view of the 
sea. But you stay with the cork. 
</P>
<P>
"In this movie, Salamo comes into Auschwitz in a boxcar. The doors are opened. 
All of a sudden he's on a platform. People are pushing him here, there. It's 
like there are forces beyond his control. He's trapped in a whirlwind." 
</P>
<P>
During this entrapment, said Young, there will be peripheral glimpses of camp 
horrors. 
</P>
<P>
When Arouch and the rest of the camp laborers march out of Auschwitz, they will 
pass by the gallows where men are hanging. 
</P>
<P>
When Arouch's brother, Avram (played by Costa Mandelas) is summoned to work in 
the crematorium, the scene is shot so that the audience will know what he is 
seeing. This according to Young, who said somberly, "As he comes to the front 
of the crematorium, the light from the furnace hits him and it's red. And it 
comes into a close-up of his face. 
</P>
<P>
"And it's like he's being born into hell. . . . But he refuses to be born into 
hell. He refuses to work in the crematorium. " 
</P>
<P>
Admitting that he could not watch the TV mini-series "Holocaust," because "it 
was too relentless," Young added, "I believe a film has got to be an aesthetic 
experience -- because it's not reality. 
</P>
<P>
"I also think there are some things you don't deal with. I think it's like 
pornography. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I'm not going to turn this movie into a horror picture -- which is what 
it would become if I showed atrocities. This is not a movie about special 
effects." 
</P>
<P>
And so, said Young, he won't shoot the gas chamber sequence. "I don't want to 
psychologically experience that moment myself. 
</P>
<P>
"That scene also involves a child. Well, I'm not going to terrorize a child by 
subjecting him to something like that. I happen to have children." 
</P>
<P>
A former documentary film maker, Young is known for "small" feature films, 
modest in budget and scope, which deal carefully with complex issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Alambrista!" is about a Mexican national who is exploited when he comes to the 
United States illegally. "Short Eyes" is about a child molester who has been 
sent to prison. 
</P>
<P>
Told from differing points of view, "The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez" follows a 
posse's search for a Mexican (played by Olmos) who has killed a sheriff. Last 
year's "Dominick and Eugene," is about the relationship between two brothers -- 
one of whom is developmentally handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
The latter convinced Kopelson to go after Young for "Triumph." 
</P>
<P>
But at first Young turned the project down. "I didn't want to do it. I thought 
it was dangerous material," he said. "It was trying to tell how these people 
had suffered -- and how the audience, in turn, should feel. I didn't like that. 
I consider that sort of thing breast-beating." 
</P>
<P>
Kopelson wound up talking him into doing it. 
</P>
<P>
Young has since taken the script -- which has been through numerous revisions 
and bears numerous writers' names -- and reworked it. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he's rewriting daily -- often with Olmos and screenwriter Arthur 
Coburn. "Almost every night, I'm writing the scene for the next day," admitted 
Young. "I tell you, it's been very scary. There've been nights where I'm up 
until 4 in the morning because I'm having anxiety attacks." 
</P>
<P>
According to Young, the script's "whole structure is changing," with new scenes 
being added. 
</P>
<P>
"In many ways, the script needed to be done here, in Auschwitz. It needed the 
rawness and the reality of this," said Young, adding: "There are elements in 
this story that I'm just discovering." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier draft, there was an exchange of dialogue that found Salamo 
bragging to a German named Heinrich that he can assure his major he'll fight in 
the ring -- and win. 
</P>
<P>
"He can bet his life on it," said Salamo. 
</P>
<P>
"Not his life . . . yours," retorted Heinrich. 
</P>
<P>
Kopelson loved that line. 
</P>
<P>
"But then," he shrugged, "those guys talked Bob out of it." 
</P>
<P>
"Those guys" are Hartmut Becker and Burkhard Heyl -- the only Germans in the 
cast. 
</P>
<P>
Becker is playing SS Major Rauscher; Heyl is SS Lt. Heinrich. Both acknowledge 
that it has not been easy for them to be on this set, wearing SS uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
Both are working with Young to bring more insight to their supporting roles. 
</P>
<P>
According to Young, there are now subtle moments to show that the character of 
Rauscher -- who happens to be a former Olympian athlete -- identifies with 
Arouch. In a sense, he boxes vicariously, through him. 
</P>
<P>
Heinrich's character carries a volume of poetry by Rainer Maria Rilke. He is 
similar to Arouch's brother, Avram (who is put to death because he will not 
work in the crematorium), in the sense that he ultimately decides he cannot 
continue living -- because he cannot accept what he has done at Auschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
"These are not the German stereotypes," said Becker, adding, "We wanted to see 
a little opening door -- a little quality in these people. They are some sort 
of survivors, too." 
</P>
<P>
Explaining that his father was a German Army sergeant who was killed at 
Leningrad (when Becker was 3), he recalled: "The bullet that killed him went 
through a little book filled with family pictures. Later, the book was sent to 
us. As a boy, I used to sit and look through it. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Heyl's father was also in the German Army. Hospitalized for frostbite in 
Russia, he was asked to read poetry aloud to Russian officers. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that his character's interest in poetry might seem odd amidst the 
daily horrors of Auschwitz, Heyl said, "I'm not searching for sympathy. But -- 
I must play a person. I know that it is a perverse situation to be in Auschwitz 
and read poems. But poetry can be his mode of escape. It's a lie -- but, 
perhaps that's how he did it. Perhaps that's how he kept his sanity there." 
</P>
<P>
There were some jokes on the set the first day that Becker and Heyl appeared on 
the set in their SS uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
Becker and Heyl had anticipated them. (They'd conferred nervously among 
themselves, before making their "debut.") 
</P>
<P>
What Becker wasn't prepared for was an encounter with a group of tourists as he 
walked across the camp dressed like an SS major. 
</P>
<P>
"The looks in their faces. The looks. I could see that I hurt those people so 
much. 
</P>
<P>
"They hurt me, too." 
</P>
<P>
Admitting that if he had it to do over, he probably wouldn't have agreed to do 
this movie, Becker said: "I was not prepared for what I would feel when I got 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, when I was young, I saw the documentaries about the camps. And I 
have been to Dachau and to Buchenwald. 
</P>
<P>
"But this place . . . And Birkenau . . . When I saw it for the first time, 
well, it is so huge." 
</P>
<P>
Fingering the silver skull insignia emblazoned on the right collar of his 
jacket, he said, "Did you know that this is the designation for the death camp? 
</P>
<P>
"When I first saw this, I felt a kind of chill."

THE WANT MAKERS The World of Advertising: How They Make You Buy by Eric Clark 
(Viking: $19.95; 416 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
 We can believe British journalist Eric Clark when he claims to be 
"pro-advertising"; his interest in the trade, after all, was sparked when he 
helped launch a magazine for the industry. Like so many authors who have 
tackled this subject before, however, Clark ends up assuming a highly critical 
tone. This is, no doubt, unavoidable, for the basic premise of advertising -- 
evading our intellect (which might remind us that all soap is the same) in 
order to play upon subconscious desires (thus convincing us that the right kind 
of soap will purify us like an Irish spring) -- seems to offend our self-image 
as rational thinkers. 
</P>
<P>
In public, of course, advertisers insist that spots simply provide consumers 
with information. Clark's absorbing investigation, however, reveals that the 
reality is fundamentally different. American ad expenditures, for one, have 
soared so dramatically in the past two decades (General Motors and Ford spent 
nearly $1.4 billion each in their 1985 campaigns) that only the very largest 
corporations can afford to "inform." Thus our "free" market is often governed 
less by the survival of the fittest products than by the strategies of the 
richest companies. 
</P>
<P>
Straightforward information is also becoming harder to find as social 
scientists, Madison Avenue's new cognoscenti, probe "the inner world of 
imagination, private language and play" in order to wage increasingly 
sophisticated subliminal campaigns. In a play-acting research experiment, for 
example, one housewife approaches another, who is seated, only to be met with 
protests. "Go away, you rotter. You'll scratch me, upset me . . . Oooo! Ugh! 
It's like rape!" When a third housewife approaches, however, the seated woman 
says, "I want you. Mmm, lovely. Smooth me. Caress me." The seated woman, we 
learn, is playing a kitchen sink; the object of her lust is a new brand of 
kitchen cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
All of this is certainly as disturbing as it is amusing, of course, especially 
when one ponders the fact that these subliminal appeals are increasingly being 
used to sell presidents as well as soap. Unfortunately, though, Clark's 
account, while engaging, fails to break new ground. He sounds familiar 
warnings, but doesn't grapple with the more difficult issues of industry reform 
(Should we require independent consumers' unions to conduct the product 
comparisons quoted on TV?) or study advertising's changing role in culture. 
Many younger Americans, for example, have come to see TV's new, avant-garde 
spots as dramas in themselves, leading some ad directors to claim that their 
work is more expressive than older, now-floundering styles of visual art.

THE ROCKEFELLERS An American Dynasty by Peter Collier and David Horowitz 
(Summit Books: $14.95) 
</P>
<P>
 Collier and Horowitz are a rare subspecies of celebrity biographers: They 
write about families (the Kennedys, the Fords). "The Rockefellers," first 
published in 1978, recounts the familiar history of John D. Rockefeller Sr. 
(about whom it was said that, although he didn't break any laws, he was the 
cause of many laws being enacted), Standard Oil and perhaps the greatest 
American fortune. 
</P>
<P>
John D. Sr. passed his mantle to his son, John Jr., who set out, by acts of 
philanthropy, to repair the family reputation in the national consciousness. 
Successive heirs would govern states and vie for presidential office. 
</P>
<P>
The authors, having gained access to letters and documents and even gained the 
cooperation of family renegades, have done an admirable job of piercing the 
mystique and the mythology that surrounds the family. They manage to make the 
Rockefellers both human and in many cases sympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
And yet the book suffers from an accumulation of detail. The Rockefellers are 
less interesting as individuals than they are as embodiments of national myth.

THE ANIMAL ESTATE The English and Other Creatures of the Victorian Age by 
Harriet Ritvo (Harvard University Press: $12.95) 
</P>
<P>
The Victorian English believed not in Darwin's theory of evolution, but in an 
intrinsic moral hierarchy in the animal kingdom. Thus it was not monkeys or 
chimpanzees who were man's closest kin, but dogs. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was any doubt about which was the most intelligent animal, the dog 
was clearly the most sagacious," Harriet Ritvo writes. "Sagacity indicated not 
the ability to manipulate mechanical contraptions or solve logical problems, 
but . . . the ability to adapt to human surroundings and to please people." 
</P>
<P>
Ritvo's enlightening examination of Victorians and their pets exposes the 
prejudices and social underpinnings of English society. In "The Animal Estate," 
she presents a well-informed analysis of how Victorians' dealings with their 
pets, show horses, beasts of burden or sporting game marked social status in 
Victorian times. 
</P>
<P>
Breeding prize cattle was the dominion of the landed gentry. The urban middle 
class, on the other hand, were dog lovers. Fox hunting and zoo keeping, the 
hobbies of well-bred people, "celebrated Britain's imperial enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, the establishment of the Royal Society of the Prevention of 
Cruelty to Animals had nothing to do with anti-vivisectionism and everything to 
do with the containment of the working classes.

FLOATING A PLAY ABOUT SHIPBUILDING; 
</P>
<P>
'STEEL-BLUE WATER' GIVES VOICE TO WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clyde Flowers saw it coming. Watching America's shipbuilding industry collapse 
around him, watching too many friends, after years of service, laid off without 
notice, Flowers got out before it could happen to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to sit there, being on the bubble, waiting every day to see if I 
was the next to go. . . . I signed up for a paralegal class. They say it's a 
booming career. I hear people are starting off at 30 grand a year." 
</P>
<P>
These words are from Flowers' real world and from the stage production, 
"Steel-Blue Water: The Shipbuilders' Play." The 51-year-old former shipbuilder, 
who worked at Todd Pacific Shipyard in San Pedro for 12 years until a few 
months ago, is one of three characters (playing himself) in the docu-theater 
piece about life at Todd and the crisis in the shipbuilding industry. It 
premieres today at 2 p.m. at Shipbuilders Local 9 union hall, 340 N. Broad Ave. 
in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
"Steel-Blue" was conceived and produced by Susan Franklin Tanner. As 
producing-artistic director of TheatreWorkers Project, she has done similar 
dramas based on the lives of American industrial workers who help create the 
plays and perform them in place of professional actors. 
</P>
<P>
Tanner's first endeavor, "Lady Beth: The Steelworkers' Play" of 1986, starred 
six former steelworkers whose worlds crumbled when the Bethlehem Steel plant in 
Vernon closed. After showing the piece to Todd shipbuilders in 1987 -- and 
watching them identify with it strongly -- Tanner decided to embark on her 
current project. 
</P>
<P>
A victim of foreign competition, commercial shipbuilding in the United States 
has declined drastically, leaving the industry dependent on Navy contracts, 
said Flowers, former president of his union local. The Navy is maintaining a 
600-ship fleet, however, as ordered by the Reagan Administration. No new Navy 
contracts are being awarded and most of the country's shipyards have closed. 
</P>
<P>
From a peak work force of nearly 6,000 in 1983, Todd, which filed for 
bankruptcy in 1987, now employs about 1,000, company officials said. Todd is 
finishing its last U.S. Navy frigate and doing repair work. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly stripped of their jobs and identities, few endured the transition as 
well as Flowers. In the play, he briefly assumes the character of a colleague 
who "went nuts," from the ceaseless inner void and self-doubt suffered after 
giving 18 years -- more than half his lifetime -- to shipbuilding: "Next thing 
you know your wife is saying, 'Hey, honey, go do this. Hey, honey, go do that.' 
Next thing you know you're looking at the four walls, going crazy." 
</P>
<P>
"People I worked with had their hearts torn out," Flowers said in an interview. 
"Guys laid off with 17, 18 years. They don't have the flexibility or education 
I have (to forge a new career). They're extremely talented, but they can barely 
read." 
</P>
<P>
"Thousands of workers built this country," Tanner said. "They make what we use 
everyday, what we drive, what we walk on. But who they are and what they feel 
gets lost in the shuffle, particularly when their plants or factories or 
shipyards close. The lives of these men are worthy of documentation, of lifting 
out of the hold of a ship and putting on a stage so that people can see who it 
was that built America." 
</P>
<P>
As with "Lady Beth," two of the three men in the shipbuilders' play were among 
several who attended weeks of workshops led by Tanner in which they told about 
their lives at Todd, orally, and through poetry and prose. Playwright and 
director Rob Sullivan then crafted their testimonials into a script, much of 
which is direct quotes. 
</P>
<P>
The steelworkers and shipbuilders projects differ, however. The former was more 
like a eulogy, the latter more like a slice of life. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas Bethlehem Steel has permanently closed, Todd remains open and officials 
hope to contract enough repair work to stay open. And, while Flowers and cast 
member Ralph Moore have both recently left the yard, both were employed when 
production on "Steel-Blue" began last October and rehearsed this spring. 
</P>
<P>
"The steelworkers play was like a memory, a funeral," Tanner said. "This is in 
process. The end of the story wasn't known, it still isn't, and we wanted to 
shed light on the present, the vitality that was still there. What has come out 
is a mixed bag of memories and hopes and fantasies and fears and future plans." 
</P>
<P>
Pride in one's work is part of that mixed bag. Moore, who spent 13 years at 
Todd, Flowers, and cast member Ruben Guevara, a musician and performance 
artist, recently read an excerpt of the play to union officials at the 
shipbuilders union hall in Wilmington. The play, funded in part by the 
California Arts Council and the American Labor Relief Fund, is co-sponsored by 
the shipbuilders union. 
</P>
<P>
Listening intently, some of these union officials, all veteran shipbuilders, 
nodded and smiled proudly, as Moore read his poem titled "Pride." 
</P>
<P>
"When the job is done . . . there is a certain swelling in your guts and you 
want to shout for joy. . . . just before you walk away, you touch it slightly, 
just so slightly, as if it were a newborn baby, your very own creation." 
</P>
<P>
Moore's pride was particularly hard won. Chronic disease and death from 
exposure to poisonous chemicals, the constant, impending threat of cancer from 
breathing asbestos, back injuries from years of grueling physical labor and 
egregious accidents are part of the play's patchwork too. In 1986, Moore was 
trapped below deck in a gaseous explosion that scorched 60% of his body and 
kept him from working for nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on fire. Clothes burning. Meat falling off my neck," says Moe, the name 
Moore uses to play himself in the production. 
</P>
<P>
Other sights, sounds and smells of the sprawling 97-acre Todd shipyard, which 
has operated in Los Angeles Harbor since the mid-'40s, make up the "Steel-Blue" 
collage. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the yard is comparatively barren, still, quiet. Abandoned machines 
in huge, empty warehouses gather dust. Giant overhead cranes stand immobile 
like steel dinosaurs. But the place once hummed and throbbed like a small 
metropolis at rush hour, swarming with workers from around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
In percussive spurts, the men describe it all: "Banging, thumping, buzzing, 
cursing, crashes, hammer on steel . . . paint odors, dirty water, acid, 
stagnant water, foul dry dock, smelly clothes . . . Slavs, Thais, Mexicans, 
Poles . . . blue water . . . blue water . . . blue water." 
</P>
<P>
Also distinguishing the play from Tanner's other projects is a set, to be 
designed by Los Angeles-based artist May Sun. Sun's vision, in her words, 
includes a "backdrop that suggests the blue ocean, or a large blow-up of a 
(ship's) blueprint," and sculptural structures made of scrap metal that may 
double as chairs. I always thought of it in sculptural terms because of the 
materials (at the yard), the rusted steel, the scrap metal, the pipes." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, who has written four of Tanner's plays, said this script is the most 
poetic and non-linear, highlighting the contrasts of the shipyard. 
</P>
<P>
"On one hand, it has very lyrical passages and talks a lot about the beauty of 
the sea," he said, "counterpointed with rough,really metallic sequences about 
how rotten it is to work there. The dirt, the danger, the noise." 
</P>
<P>
Preserving the shipbuilders' points of view and natural speech patterns was 
paramount. The script is liberally peppered with profanity: "I wanted this to 
sound like they were sitting around talking in an office at the union hall." 
</P>
<P>
The three men in "Steel-Blue" had the best feel for acting among those he has 
worked with, Sullivan added. That's not too surprising. 
</P>
<P>
Although about 15 shipbuilders took part in Tanner's workshops, few wanted to 
bare their souls on stage. Therefore Guevara, who has never worked as a 
shipbuilder and has performed professionally since 1971, was hired to represent 
the yard's Latino presence. Flowers, who has just completed his first paralegal 
class, had done street theater for two years in the late '60s. A return to the 
limelight wasn't the main reason he volunteered for the project, however. It 
was the play's message. 
</P>
<P>
"What's happened in American industry since the late '70s is one of the 
biggest, misunderstood and under-publicized issues. I've driven through the 
Rust Belt in Pittsburgh. It was once a beautiful, thriving place. Now it's like 
a decimated wasteland. People have lost everything. Our union once had about 
400,000 workers (nationwide). Now It's down to 12,000. What happened to all 
those jobs, all that income? It's like the reversal of the American industrial 
revolution, yet it's the best-kept secret. Where's all the plays and poems and 
novels and paintings? Susan (Tanner) is one of the few people doing anything 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
"Steel-Blue Water: The Shipbuilders' Play" can be seen at 7 p.m. Tuesday, at 
IAM District 727, a machinists union hall at 2600 W. Victory Blvd., Burbank, 
and for 8 p.m., May 21, at Highways performance space, 1641-51 18th St., Santa 
Monica. Information: (213) 221-7672.

CHOREOGRAPHER IN THE SPOTLIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
DAVID PARSONS TAKES HIS COMPANY ON FIRST CALIFORNIA TRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS SADOWNICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Parsons is being watched. He knows it. And he seems to love it. 
</P>
<P>
He walks confidently through crowded downtown Manhattan streets toward his Soho 
studio while pedestrians virtually gawk at the 6-foot-1 dancer, with his 
corn-fed good looks, blond hair, steely smile and graceful turnout. 
</P>
<P>
At his studio, his six dancers listen to his easy-going choreographic 
suggestions with an attention bordering on infatuation. Later on, Parsons jokes 
easily with an onlooker, who had earlier been awed to be in the presence of one 
of Paul Taylor's most riveting dancers. But the scrutiny isn't always easy to 
handle. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since Parsons left the Taylor company in '87 and finally made the career 
shift from celebrated dancer to evolving choreographer, he says he's being 
"checked out" by the New York dance world "non-stop." 
</P>
<P>
"Some people who think that I've had it too easy, who don't like seeing my mug 
on the cover of Dance Magazine, have their nasty little eyes on me, waiting for 
me to have some kind of fall," he says one morning before rehearsal, with only 
a trace of anxiety in the slang-heavy speech that could pass for 
California-surfer lingo. 
</P>
<P>
"But I sure hope that when we go to L.A., there will be folks there just 
watching the moves and all, tuned into the very different dances for their own 
sake," he says, referring to his company's first California programs that will 
take place in Royce Hall, UCLA, on Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But Parsons also knows that there will be Taylor fans in L.A. who can't help 
but see in him the heart and soul of Taylor's "Arden Court," "Roses" and "Last 
Look." And Parsons has to admit that he is indeed "a Taylor creation," in the 
midst of a "painful process of struggling to become his own creation." 
</P>
<P>
As an unformed lad of 17 from Kansas City, Mo., Parsons fit perfectly into 
Taylor's rebellious notion of the male dancer: that he look like an American 
farmer and not a European prince, that he be a mover capable of brooding 
complexity and athletic lifts and bounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Taylor taught me every damn thing I know," Parsons confides, almost resigned 
to the implications that his apprenticeship as a dancer "somehow limits him" as 
a creator. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, I was a devout Taylor disciple," he confides. "I loved that man. We had 
a very special, almost collaborative, way of working together. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I had to excite him; that was all he wanted from a dancer, to risk, to 
fall flat on your face. I would do whatever the dance called for. I never once, 
in eight years, missed a rehearsal. That company was like a family to me. You 
can't tell your body to forget all that no matter what your mind wants." 
</P>
<P>
And Parsons says that when it was time for him to leave that family and follow 
his own creative calling, he felt as if he were "mourning for months and 
months" and even began to wear "only black" as a statement of his "own sense of 
loss and confusion." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Parsons believes that his own adoration of Taylor might account for 
some of the scrutiny he feels from various audience members and especially the 
press. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most modern dance choreographers, who base their styles on a violent 
rebellion against their predecessors, Parsons says he has no desire to reject 
what he considers "a good thing, a base from which to grow and get it 
together." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not into the revolting scene," he says with a smile. "I'm going to need 
more time before that." 
</P>
<P>
If anything, Parsons says he's more "interested in watching myself and in 
fighting myself and my instinct, than in worrying about 'being different' than 
Taylor." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the only differences Parsons says he cares about are the structural 
and choreographic ones he finds in his own works: 
</P>
<P>
"Envelope" comments ironically on "message" ballets and slick lighting effects; 
"Walk This Way" incorporates pedestrian walking and running; "Caught" combines 
fast spins with the pulse of a strobe light; "Brothers" is a physically charged 
duet (created collaboratively with Daniel Ezralow) that explores the 
relationship between two men. 
</P>
<P>
But the piece that seems unique to him is a dance he always ends his programs 
with: "Scrutiny." 
</P>
<P>
"(Characters) cover their eyes or stare down some of the dancers -- excluding 
some, including others -- finally figuring out how to dance without too much 
paranoia," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
Does he see any connection between the drama of that dance and his trauma to 
establish himself as a creator in his own right? 
</P>
<P>
"You bet," he replies, roaring. "People don't know where to peg me," he 
confesses. "And what really drives people so wild is that even though no one 
really knows who I am and what I stand for, my company is so far, knock wood, 
very successful," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
The company has toured extensively to Canada, Italy, Toronto and California 
this past year. 
</P>
<P>
Parsons has also created works for American Ballet Theatre, the Feld Ballet and 
Momix. Before his California engagement, he will have choreographed a work for 
the National Ballet of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
And in May, Parsons will appear with New York City Ballet as guest artist in 
Peter Martin's "Barber Violin Concerto." 
</P>
<P>
Parsons bristles at suggestions that this success has come easier to him than 
most choreographers of his caliber, because of the beefcake glamour status he's 
enjoyed as a Taylor figurehead. 
</P>
<P>
"This ain't Hollywood and I'm not running off to be in everyone's movies," he 
exclaims. "Everyone thinks this came easy to me . . . that I didn't dedicate my 
life to dance, like I make a lot of money trying to have a company, 
</P>
<P>
or like I don't have my doubts about how to keep us afloat, about how to make a 
good dance." 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the Taylor thing has opened doors, expensive and powerful doors," 
he agrees reluctantly. "But damn it, the work really does also speak for itself 
too. That's the good thing about my injury. People don't just want me, they 
want my dances."

Parson was referring to a bone he broke on the bottom of his foot five months 
ago, an injury that was exacerbated when he persisted in dancing. At UCLA, 
former Joffrey, Tharp and Broadway dancer Gary Chryst will take Parson's place, 
as he did last winter during a tour throughout Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a very hard year and this injury has got me down," Parsons admits. 
"I love dancing and will miss it in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
"But Gary (Chryst) is a great dancer and his taking my part has helped me to 
stand back from the work and analyze it as carefully as everyone else seems to. 
</P>
<P>
"And when presenters call up and ask if they can produce us, I feel good now, 
because I know that they believe the work has strength, integrity, value. I am 
proud of my company and how far my dancers have come. 
</P>
<P>
"There's both a sad thing and a proud thing in watching the company instead of 
dancing with them. In some ways it's easier to dance than to scrutinize."

They call him the Ironman. He eats barbed wire. He gargles gasoline. He's one 
tough character. 
</P>
<P>
So when Pete Townshend began producing his new concept album based on Ted 
Hughes' children's story, "Ironman," he knew there was only one singer whose 
voice could bring the title role to life: John Lee Hooker. 
</P>
<P>
"I always knew that the Who were A-one fans of mine," Hooker said recently, in 
his low growl. "But I didn't think Pete was fool enough to ask me to try 
singing something I was so unfamiliar with. 'Ironman' is not blues, it's what 
you might call pop. This is something Pete wrote. Something I would have never 
thought of." 
</P>
<P>
"Ironman," due out in June on Atlantic Records, is only the latest in a series 
of recent Hooker-related projects. The DCC label has just released the "John 
Lee Hooker 40th Anniversary Album," a set of 15 songs (12 of them previously 
unreleased) recorded between 1948 and '61. 
</P>
<P>
The King of the Boogie also has a new album in the can, featuring contributions 
from a stellar cast of contemporary heavies: Los Lobos, Robert Cray, Carlos 
Santana, Bonnie Raitt, George Thorogood, Charlie Musselwhite, Larry Taylor. 
Hooker's booking agent, Mike Kappus, is in the midst of negotiations with an 
independent label and predicts a summer release for Hooker's first new LP since 
1984's "Jealous." 
</P>
<P>
"I think the new album will make people more aware of how vital John Lee's 
talents are," said Kappus, head of the Rosebud Booking Agency. "Our intention 
was not to go all-out for star power, but to involve artists who really loved 
John, people who were essentially friends and fans. The result is a record 
which not only illustrates John's significant influence and stature within the 
music community, but it also demonstrates what an extremely sharp and active 
performer he still is." 
</P>
<P>
Produced by Delta blues aficionado Roy Rogers and tentatively titled "The 
Healer," it's Hooker's 110th album. 
</P>
<P>
Van Morrison was originally slated to produce the LP, but had to back out due 
to scheduling conflicts. "There is nobody even remotely like John," Morrison -- 
a lifelong Hooker fan and a close friend -- said during a phone interview from 
England. "The man is a real (one of a kind). He is a window into another age." 
</P>
<P>
Says Los Lobos' David Hidalgo: "The first time I heard him growl, my jaw hit 
the floor. All that power and emotion. That big old voice, man, it's 
unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
This powerful legend leads a quiet suburban life. He recently moved into a new 
two-story house here on a hilltop overlooking the San Francisco Bay. Except for 
a few vehicles in the driveway sporting license-plate inscriptions like "DOC 
HOOK" and "LES BOOGY," there are no signs that this is the residence of an 
international blues superstar. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't do nothin' real fast no more. Nothin' heavy," Hooker said. "Mostly, my 
daily life is about relaxin', like I'm doin' now. Just kickin' back in common 
clothes and bein' happy." 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a burgundy suit, black suspenders and a white polka-dot shirt, 
Hooker appeared relaxed and youthful. Cuing up a tape of "The Healer" on a 
ghetto blaster, he leaned back and pointed at the speaker. 
</P>
<P>
"My songs are like poetry. Some are pretty heavy -- so heavy I can hardly carry 
them," Hooker said. "Sometimes on stage, when I'm singing them, it gets so sad 
and deep and beautiful, I have to wear dark glasses to keep the people from 
seeing me crying. I'm not kidding. The tears just start running. With the words 
that I'm saying and the way I sing it, sometimes I give my own self the blues." 
</P>
<P>
Seemingly unaffected by his legendary status, Hooker laughed and joked 
throughout much of a two-hour interview. Clearly excited about his new work, he 
often stopped in mid-sentence to point out some subtle detail on the tape that 
still moved him. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I may not be too good at writing things down, but when it comes to 
creating a song from here" -- he pointed to his heart -- "and here" -- now to 
his head -- "nobody can beat me." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the three-minute psychodramas he has written over the past four decades 
are essential parts of the blues lexicon. Songs like "I Cover the Waterfront" 
and "Bad Like Jesse James" certainly expanded the parameters of blues subject 
matter. Sex, violence, guilt, revenge -- Hooker has written about it all. But 
the topic that stirs his interest the most is love. 
</P>
<P>
"Love does strange things to people," Hooker said. "It can get a hold on you 
and cause some serious damage. Like dope. Maybe even worse than dope. People 
talk about money, but money doesn't matter. You can have this room full of 
money, but that money cannot hug you at night. That money cannot talk to you or 
dress up and look good for you. You got to have love." 
</P>
<P>
A three-time divorce, the blues patriarch currently shares living quarters with 
members of his band. A satellite dish in the back yard and big-screen TV in the 
dining room help him keep tabs on world events and pop culture. Hooker is an 
avid Western movie buff and a big Michael Jackson fan. But his true love is 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does he catch every televised game he can, but Hooker also keeps 
multiple radio stations tuned in on separate receivers to monitor as many games 
as possible. 
</P>
<P>
But he doesn't enjoy staying cooped up for too long. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't hide out. I like to get out in the car and go," Hooker said. "To the 
store, to the little restaurants around here. Sometimes people who recognize me 
are shocked when they see me in these little places. They say like, 'What is he 
doin' here?' Well, I'm human, I like to eat." 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1917 in Mississippi's Coahoma County, Hooker developed his vocal style 
singing spirituals in his preacher father's Baptist church. When his parents 
divorced, he went to live with his mother and stepfather, a popular blues 
guitarist on the Delta named Will Moore. 
</P>
<P>
"The style that I'm playing now, my stepfather taught me when I was around the 
age of 12 years old," Hooker said. "No other guitar player sounded like him and 
because my style came from him, no other guitar player sounds like me." 
</P>
<P>
While still a teen-ager, Hooker left the Mississippi Delta and drifted north to 
Memphis and Cincinnati, finally settling down in Detroit in 1943. Working 
factory jobs by day and performing music at night, Hooker soon became a fixture 
at clubs on Detroit's famed Hastings Street. 
</P>
<P>
He acquired his first electric guitar in 1947, a pawn-shop gift from local 
legend T-Bone Walker. "T-Bone was the greatest on electric guitar," Hooker 
said. "I used to follow him around like a puppy." 
</P>
<P>
In 1948, he burst on the R&amp;B scene with his first big hit, "Boogie 
Chillen'." A one-man band, Hooker developed his trademark sound with a raunchy 
guitar and a stomping foot. His hypnotic rhythm patterns practically defined 
the classic bar-band idiom widely known now as boogie music. 
</P>
<P>
A string of hits on Modern and Vee-Jay Records followed. Songs like "I'm in the 
Mood," "Crawlin' King Snake" and "Hobo Blues" established Hooker's terse 
electric style. 
</P>
<P>
"What's really cool about John Lee is that when he tells a story, the lyrics 
dictate what he does with the music," young blues 
</P>
<P>
star Robert Cray observed. "Most blues artists tend to restrict themselves 
within a standard 12-bar structure. But with John Lee, there aren't any rules 
in music." 
</P>
<P>
During the '60s folk renaissance, Hooker introduced himself to the young, white 
audience when he began headlining coffeehouses and clubs. He also shared the 
spotlight at the Newport Folk Festival with a young singer named Bob Dylan. 
</P>
<P>
During this period, Hooker lived in London. Working with John Mayall's 
Bluesbreakers (featuring Eric Clapton and Peter Green on guitars) as a backup 
band, he toured Europe repeatedly. In those days, aspiring rockers like Pete 
Townshend and David Bowie were indefatigable followers. The Rolling Stones 
frequently opened his shows, and the Animals scored a hit with their remake of 
his "Boom Boom." 
</P>
<P>
On the road, Hooker prefers playing small bars and coffeehouses to big halls 
and outdoor arenas. "The reason why is because I can be right down with my 
people that love me. I'm playin' for them, face to face. After the show, if I 
want to have a beer with them, I can sit down anywhere and just talk." 
</P>
<P>
Understatement has always been John Lee Hooker's strongest card. To hear him 
tell it, the kind of blues he sings came into being long before there ever was 
a Detroit or a Chicago or a Mississippi Delta. They date back to the Garden of 
Eden. 
</P>
<P>
"When Adam and Eve first saw each other, that's when the blues started," Hooker 
said. "No matter what anybody says, it all comes down to the same thing: a man 
and a woman, a broken heart, a broken home. You know what I mean?"

NEWS NOTES: CBS has joined the roster of U.S. record companies providing 
material to the Personics system, which makes it possible for record-store 
shoppers to custom-design their own cassettes by choosing songs from a bank of 
more than 4,000 titles. The agreement with CBS means that five of the six major 
U.S. distribution giants are on board (RCA is the lone holdout). The first 
group of CBS selections will enter the Personics catalogue in May. Among the 
artists involved: Cyndi Lauper, the Bangles, Cheap Trick and REO Speedwagon. . 
. . "Bad English" is the name of the debut album by a new group of the same 
name featuring John Waite and his former Babys colleagues Jonathan Cain and 
Ricky Phillips, as well as Cain's former Journey mate Neal Schon. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Our Minneapolis spy reports that Prince has been testing the songs he's 
recorded for the upcoming movie "Batman" by checking audience reaction to them 
at First Avenue, the Minneapolis dance club where "Purple Rain" was filmed. . . 
. Carole Bayer Sager served as executive producer for June Pointer's first 
album for Columbia Records, due next month. Sager and Burt Bacharach also 
produced some tracks on the album, as did Phil Ramone and David Foster. But the 
album isn't all pop. Kashif, Rhett Lawrence and Narada Michael Walden also 
pitched in.

A new Gallup Poll finds as much support for an increase in the budget for 
Social Security (46%) as for maintaining the current spending level (47%) and 
very little backing (3%) for a decrease. Government programs for the elderly 
are similarly endorsed: 50% favor an increase, 45% would maintain the status 
quo and 3% favor cuts, the survey found. Fifty-six percent would oppose raising 
taxes on Social Security payments to the same rate as taxes on ordinary income, 
while the same percentage of respondents oppose limiting the amount Medicare 
pays for the elderly's annual health care bills. Almost as many (45%) are 
opposed to reducing cost-of-living increases for those on Social Security.

The foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq resumed direct peace talks, but they 
appeared no closer to a permanent truce than when negotiations began eight 
months ago. Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz, leaving after 2 1/2 hours of 
talks in Geneva with his Iranian counterpart, Ali Akbar Velayati, said the 
meeting brought only a reiteration of clashing positions. Progress continues to 
be stalled over Iran's demand for a full withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Iran 
and Iraq's insistence on early dredging of the Shatt al Arab waterway, its only 
outlet to the sea. The talks were chaired by U.N. Secretary General Javier 
Perez de Cuellar. Another session is planned for today.

DAVIS NEIGHBORS TEAR DOWN THEIR FENCES TO BUILD EXTENDED FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

DAVIS, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Frost wrote "good fences make good neighbors," but some neighbors in 
this agricultural university town beg to differ. 
</P>
<P>
They took out their saws and crowbars the other day and, board by board, tore 
down the 60 or so feet of fence they saw as not only separating their four 
homes but also blocking out fellowship, fun and neighborly assistance. 
</P>
<P>
"This is anathema to the guy who wants to define his territoriality," Larry 
Fisher said as he helped his friends tear down their fences. 
</P>
<P>
But, said Kevin Wolf, who owns one of the homes, "This allows for the 
modern-day convenience of privacy along with the need for an extended family." 
</P>
<P>
The neighbors plan to recycle the fence wood to build a chicken coop for the 
four households to share. 
</P>
<P>
The common back yard already has a garden full of strawberries, raspberries, 
chard, miner's lettuce, fruit trees, cilantro, parsley and garlic. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the yard is a giant playground to the three preschoolers living 
there and a spot to relax and socialize for the 14 adults. Two are married and 
"thirtysomething." The rest are single and mostly in their 20s or 30s. 
</P>
<P>
The four households -- made up of both homeowners and renters -- share a 
washing machine, a computer, a large bike rack and baby-sitting 
responsibilities. Eventually they want to buy a home together and make it a 
"common house" for the tiny community. 
</P>
<P>
The common house -- an idea taken from the newly published book "Cohousing: A 
Contemporary Approach to Housing Ourselves," by Kathryn McCamant and Charles 
Durrett of Berkeley -- would serve as a place where the neighbors could share 
community dinners, baby-sitting or sociability when they don't have a desire 
for privacy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'From the '60s' 
</P>
<P>
"It's a thing from the '60s, but it's not a commune. We all still have our 
individual house," Wolf says of the current arrangement. He and his wife, Linda 
Cloud, dreamed up the idea of sharing back yards in the community that is also 
home to UC Davis, about 15 miles west of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
They bought their former neighbors' home and rented out the one where they had 
been living to some friends. It has served as a cooperative household for 10 
years, having been mainly occupied by university students who have sought 
companionship in addition to a rented room. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Fury, who used to live in Wolf's house, now lives in Oakland. But she 
said she misses the cooperative household she left behind. "I have roommates 
but it's a real problem finding people who consider it more than just a 
stopping place." 
</P>
<P>
Cloud said that lack of privacy has never been a problem for her and her 
husband. They and their 7-month-old daughter live with two other adults. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing is just to have open communication," she said. "You have to 
tell people that wanting to be alone is OK. They don't have to feel gregarious 
all the time. You have to tell people when something's bothering you." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Have to Agree' 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing with cooperative households," Wolf said, "is that you have 
to agree to everything before you move in." 
</P>
<P>
He and his neighbors, for instance, have agreed that their life styles will be 
good for the environment. This was particularly important to Wolf and Cloud. 
Both work at Friends of the River, a Sacramento-based environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
The four households recycle most of their waste. They use their orange rinds, 
coffee grounds, banana peels and egg shells to make compost to fertilize their 
garden. They don't waste water. And, they take the wood that their carpenter 
and gardener friends are about to toss out and use it in their wood stoves to 
heat their homes, rarely using any electricity.

LONGSHOREMEN'S CLOUT EBBS AS PORT USE TAILS OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H. G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Vinole likes to use newsprint -- those giant rolls that end up on doorsteps 
as folded newspapers -- to explain why longshoremen's jobs are going the way of 
the ebbing tide on the San Diego waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-five years ago, longshoremen were required to go into a ship's hold and 
send individual rolls of newsprint up to the dock on a winch. The big cylinders 
were then rolled one-at-a-time down a ramp and loaded onto two-wheeled carts. 
</P>
<P>
One longshoreman then wheeled a 1,700-pound newsprint roll into a dockside 
warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
"Newsprint was hand-handled in those days. The only machine you had was your 
back," Vinole said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
16 Rolls at Once 
</P>
<P>
Today, a vacuum machine can go into a ship's hold and literally suck up 16 of 
the giant rolls at a time, lift them, and set them gingerly down on the dock. A 
smaller machine that also uses a vacuum process and is operated by a 
longshoreman picks up two rolls at once and wheels them into a warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
The modern process not only minimizes damage to the rolls, but, more important, 
cuts the shippers' and manufacturers' costs by maximizing the amount of work 
that fewer men can do. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems that, for every job we do these days, you need fewer and fewer men," 
said Vinole, 66 and a veteran of 37 years on the waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody denies that dockworkers' jobs are disappearing, but Vinole and other 
longshoremen say technology is not the only culprit. The Port of San Diego is 
equally to blame, they say, arguing that, rather than promoting shipping, the 
port has chosen to lease land to hotels, restaurants and tourist attractions 
along the waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
"The port would rather be a landlord and collect rent. . . . Why don't we have 
any work in this port? Why aren't there any cargo ships coming to San Diego?" 
asked Tim Chavez, president of the Longshoremen's &amp; Warehousemen's 
International Union, Local 29. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Ports Envied 
</P>
<P>
Chavez and his 78-member local look with envy up the coast to the bigger ports 
of Long Beach and Los Angeles, where longshoremen find work regularly. 
Comparisons with the two give a clear picture of San Diego's decline as a major 
West Coast port. 
</P>
<P>
* In 1988, 63.4 million metric tons of cargo passed through the Port of Long 
Beach on 5,483 ships. 
</P>
<P>
* During the same period, the Port of Los Angeles recorded 60.8 million metric 
tons of cargo from about 3,500 ships. 
</P>
<P>
* San Diego port officials said 1.3 million metric tons of cargo passed through 
the port in 1988 on about 350 ships, including passenger ships. Those figures 
are down from the 1.49 million metric tons reported for 1987. 
</P>
<P>
As if to underscore the lack of activity on the docks, a giant crane stands 
idle at the 24th Street Pier in National City. The crane, the only one of its 
kind on the San Diego waterfront, has not been used in almost two years. It was 
used to handle copper concentrate until the state Regional Water Quality 
Control Board charged that the copper was polluting the bay. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the Long Beach and Los Angeles ports each has dozens, if not 
hundreds, such cranes. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the union hall near the foot of Broadway, longshoremen gather early 
Monday mornings to inquire about available jobs. "Registered" union members, 
who make $19.83 an hour, have first pick, and any leftover jobs are offered to 
"casuals," or non-union members who patiently wait outside to be assigned to 
work gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"In the old days, the dispatcher assigned all the jobs. Now, registered members 
are allowed to pick the jobs they want. Casuals get what they're given," said 
J. R. (Chayo) Colmenero, secretary-treasurer and dispatcher for the local. 
</P>
<P>
Union regulations require longshoremen to work a minimum 800 hours a year to 
keep their health and welfare benefits. However, because of the shortage of 
cargo ships, the international union has classified San Diego as a "low 
work-opportunity" port and eased the number of hours that local members are 
required to work each year. 
</P>
<P>
"Thirty years ago, when we loaded and unloaded cotton, cement and other bulk 
goods, there was a lot of work and guys were dying to get a day off. Now, 
they're dying to work at least one day a week," Chavez said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Chavez, local longshoremen work an average of three days a week. 
</P>
<P>
Colmenero explained that the local's last registration for active membership 
occurred in 1969, when Local 29, which was chartered in 1937, had about 218 
members. Union membership has dwindled to 78, and today registration can be 
obtained only by a surviving son or daughter of a member who was working when 
he died. 
</P>

<P>
Used to Be 'King Cotton' 
</P>
<P>
Veteran longshoremen like Vinole remember the waterfront's heyday, particularly 
when the port was "King Cotton" on the West Coast. Until the mid-1960s, cotton 
from Mexico and the Imperial Valley was shipped out of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Every bale was loaded by hand. . . . We had so much cotton and so much work. 
Cotton bales were stacked on both sides of Harbor Drive," Vinole said. 
</P>
<P>
But, in the mid 1960s, two events had a dramatic impact on both longshoremen 
and the port. First, the Mexican government decreed that all Mexican cotton had 
to be shipped from Ensenada. 
</P>
<P>
Second, Imperial Valley growers began loading cotton bales in containers, 
sending them directly to port by rail. Unfortunately, because there was no 
direct rail connection to the port in San Diego, the cotton was sent to Long 
Beach, where it was shipped to points all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the beginning of the downslide," Chavez said. "After that, work got 
scarce. It seems like the port made no attempt to go after shipping. Instead, 
they went after restaurants, hotels and Seaport Village." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's Simply Not True' 
</P>
<P>
Bill Stonehouse, director of trade development for the San Diego Unified Port 
District, denies that the port is not interested in attracting shipping. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an old comment. It's simply not true that we don't want cargo. . . . 
Instead, we have to work on (attracting) specialized cargo. We have been 
working diligently to bring autos to San Diego. . . . But our biggest handicap 
is that the largest consuming area for autos is in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
He said port commissioners have been "realistic" in developing the waterfront, 
and that San Diego is not a major port because it is hampered by the absence of 
a direct rail link with the Midwest and East and Gulf coasts; the fact that San 
Diego is not a "hub" port and the absence of a deep-water port for container 
ships that are growing increasingly bigger. 
</P>
<P>
"The absence of a railroad line is the single most negative point we have when 
it comes to us being a container port," Stonehouse said. "We simply can't exist 
as a container port without a continental railroad line. That has never been 
viable in San Diego because of our geography and proximity to the Mexican 
border. . . . Plus, I don't think that the citizenry would stand for mile-long 
trains constantly making their way in and out of downtown." 
</P>
<P>
Much of today's cargo goods are shipped in giant metal containers that are 
stacked atop each other aboard ship. Container cargo is easier to ship and more 
cost-effective because it can be loaded and unloaded quickly by fewer men. 
</P>
<P>
Containerization, which became widespread in the mid-1970s, had a dramatic 
effect on the shipping industry, particularly in San Diego, Stonehouse said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Radical Change 
</P>
<P>
"Longshoremen are still thinking of the ships they used to unload before 
containerization. But containerization made a radical change in the business, 
which went from labor-intensive to capital-intensive." 
</P>
<P>
Before containerization, ships were smaller, and 16-man gangs, totaling five or 
six gangs, were commonly used to unload a ship, Stonehouse said. Today, six-man 
gangs, totaling only three to six gangs, are capable of handling cargo on the 
much bigger container ships, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For containerization to be productive, a ship must be able to unload its cargo 
and steam away with a new load. In addition, a port must have "an excellent 
railroad connection," Stonehouse said. 
</P>
<P>
"You also have to have a large consumer population. San Diego has neither," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The only container ship that now docks in San Diego regularly is the Moana 
Pacific, which brings canned tuna from American Samoa and departs with empty 
cans. The ship comes in once a month and is in port for a couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
Although the eventual demise of San Diego as a shipping port is frequently 
discussed, many of the older longshoremen discount that notion. 
</P>
<P>
"You stand on the dock and look around you. What do you see? Hotels and 
restaurants, but no ships," said Vince (Pelican) Torres, 73, the union's oldest 
active member. "But, as long as there is an ocean and ships, there will always 
be longshoremen in San Diego."

GROUP URGES PLAN TO KEEP MARINE BASE AS SPRAWL BARRIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CAMP PENDLETON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Southern California -- from Santa Barbara to the Mexican border -- continues 
to boom and sprawl, many San Diego residents look at Camp Pendleton as the last 
remaining open-space barrier against a future "San Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Now a well-known volunteer urban planning and environmental group in San Diego 
wants to make sure that the Marine Corps base's 125,000 acres (more than 195 
square miles) remain open and free from development if the base is ever closed. 
</P>
<P>
The group, called C-3, for Citizens Coordinate for Century 3, is urging U.S. 
Sens. Alan Cranston and Pete Wilson, as well as San Diego County's 
congressional delegation, to safeguard the area by introducing legislation this 
year that would convert the base to federal parkland if it is ever closed. 
</P>
<P>
The request was made in letters that arrived at most congressional offices 
earlier this month. At least two of the officials, Wilson and Rep. Jim Bates 
(D-San Diego), think the idea has merit and will consider seeking congressional 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Seems to Make Sense' 
</P>
<P>
"At first blush, we think it's a splendid idea that seems to make sense," said 
Wilson's spokesman, Otto Bos. He said Wilson's office will examine the proposal 
more closely, with the idea of introducing the necessary federal parkland 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is no indication whatsoever that the federal government plans to 
give up the base, home to about 38,000 troops, Bos said that "if some time down 
the road it were to be closed, we should probably have it so designated" as 
parkland. 
</P>
<P>
Bates called the proposal "a great idea" and said he will support it. Bates 
said he would defer to Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), whose district includes 
Camp Pendleton, to introduce a parkland-designation bill. But if Packard 
declines, "I will be glad to introduce such legislation," Bates said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Packard said his office is aware of the proposal, has talked 
briefly with Wilson's office about it and "we're interested in it." Packard 
will probably have a more specific response in the next few weeks, after he has 
studied the proposal, his spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Response from the Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton was noncommittal. Camp 
spokesman Lt. Col. John Shotwell said the Marines are also aware of the 
proposal. "We're currently studying it to see if it would be appropriate to 
take a stand on this issue if requested by congressional representatives." 
Shotwell said the Marines "don't envision a time in which Camp Pendleton, with 
its unique and ideal features for amphibious training, would not be vital to 
this nation's national defense as a Marine Corps base." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Support Use by Marines 
</P>
<P>
And that would be just fine with C-3 President Don Wood, who wrote the letters 
to the senators and congressmen asking for the parkland designation. Wood said 
he and C-3 support the use of Camp Pendleton by the Marines, as it ensures that 
urban sprawl will not spill over from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
It is precisely because the government has no plans to close Camp Pendleton 
that now is the best time to designate the property -- which contains 
environmentally sensitive lands and is home to much wildlife and endangered 
bird species -- as future federal parkland, Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't cost anyone anything right now. It's a painless thing. Developers 
don't have rights to it; there is no controversy about its development," Wood 
said. 
</P>
<P>
His organization points to the Presidio in San Francisco as an example of what 
can be done. Several years ago, members of the Bay Area congressional 
delegation introduced and helped pass a law to turn the Presidio, a historic 
Army base on spectacular ocean-side property adjacent to the Golden Gate 
Bridge, into parkland should the base ever close. 
</P>
<P>
"Now the people of the area can look forward to the base being redeveloped into 
public parkland," Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
C-3 members fear that forces spurring rampant growth are so great in Southern 
California that, in time, corridors between San Diego County and the counties 
of Riverside and Orange will be a continuous swath of housing tracts and 
commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we want to be an integrated suburb of Los Angeles in which we 
lose our identity as a separate community," Wood said. "Camp Pendleton provides 
the perfect buffer." 
</P>
<P>
What C-3 members fear is that unless Camp Pendleton is specifically protected 
it will go the way of many other former military bases in San Diego County, 
such as Camps Elliott, Kearny and Matthews. Those bases were turned into the 
vast housing tracts known as Mira Mesa, Scripps Ranch and Tierrasanta. 
</P>
<P>
Because of that, Wood said, C-3 believes that local politicians would not be 
able to resist the pressure to develop Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't trust local politicians to persevere against development pressures. 
I think the record is clear on that point. You can't depend on the free market 
to do it," Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
For many years, developers and others have attempted to make inroads at Camp 
Pendleton. The most recent proposal called for the construction of an airport 
capable of meeting the future needs of both San Diego and Los Angeles. Like 
most other plans for the Marine base, it quickly died. The Marines take such 
proposed encroachments seriously and have an officer whose full-time job is to 
counter such piecemeal efforts. 
</P>
<P>
C-3 officials said the group's proposal would give the Marines an important 
tool to fight off attempts to use the base for private development. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the only thing we have left of this magnitude," Wood said. "We'll 
never get anything like Camp Pendleton again."

DESIGN IS KEY TO NEW JAIL: DETENTION CENTER IN VISTA WINS PRAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it opened 14 years ago, the Vista detention center was a suburban branch 
jail for North County. But with the growth of North County came more crime -- 
and the need to house more criminal suspects. And no longer can the Vista 
detention center be considered a branch office in the administration of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
When the newly expanded Vista detention center reopens this summer, it will be 
the largest jail in San Diego County, larger even than the main jail in 
downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
By court order, the downtown jail is limited to 750 inmates. Its Vista 
counterpart, on the other hand, will house nearly 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Already Winning Praise 
</P>
<P>
Despite those projections -- double the number for which the jail was designed 
-- the facility already is winning praise from defense attorneys and others for 
the quality of life it will offer its inmates. 
</P>
<P>
As jails go, consider some of the amenities of the new Vista facility: 
</P>
<P>
* Windows in each cell so natural daylight can enter. 
</P>
<P>
* More exercise yards, including some indoors that can be used in bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
* More visiting areas, so inmates can spend up to four hours a week -- instead 
of the two hours that had been the regimen -- with family and friends. Visiting 
hours will be from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
* Multipurpose rooms in addition to the normal "day rooms" shared by blocks of 
inmates. These rooms might one day even feature video games and other 
attractions, financed through inmate entertainment funds. 
</P>
<P>
* The use of "mods" housing 32 inmates each, rather than larger dormitories, 
thereby making it easier to segregate into smaller groups inmates who might not 
otherwise get along, such as members of rival gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an exemplary facility compared to what exists today," defense attorney 
Brad Patton said after touring the jail. "It's certainly at the cutting edge of 
jail technology." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Year in the Making 
</P>
<P>
The jail expansion has been a year in the making, at a cost of $29 million. In 
the interim, the 583 inmates who were squeezed into the old Vista jail -- which 
was designed for an optimum population of 242 -- were relocated to the county's 
other jails in downtown San Diego, El Cajon and Santee. 
</P>
<P>
The old jail was renovated, and the add-on is virtually complete, giving the 
new facility a rating of 542 inmates -- one per cell. But most cells already 
are 
</P>
<P>
planned to have double bunks because of the county's jail shortage, resulting 
in a projected population at Vista of nearly 1,000 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
The county is not required by state law to limit inmates to one per cell, on 
which the 542-inmate rating is partially based, but officials acknowledge that 
by exceeding the state's rated capacity for the jail population, they expose 
themselves to a possible lawsuit based on overcrowded conditions and, thus, 
cruel and unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorneys say they are not overly concerned by the squeeze because 
the new facility's amenities should reduce the stress and tension of close 
living that have plagued the downtown jail. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to see how they handle it once they start moving inmates in, but 
I'm very impressed by how spacious the place is," said defense attorney John 
Emerson. "Even if they double-bunk (to bring the jail population to nearly 
1,000), I don't think it will be overcrowded." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Helps Jail Workers Too 
</P>
<P>
Jail officials say making life as pleasant as possible for the inmates will 
make their own jobs easier. 
</P>
<P>
"If you make it a better place for inmates, you consequently make it a better 
place for the deputies," said Capt. Jim Marmack, the jail commander. "I can't 
wait for the place to open." 
</P>
<P>
The new facility reflects newer thinking in jail design, including the 
positioning of six two-story mods, each housing 32 inmates, in a wheel 
configuration. Each mod -- and each cell within that mod -- can be monitored by 
a single guard station where a deputy has a 270-degree view from his hub 
position. 
</P>
<P>
Within his booth, the deputy has full electronic control over his mods, 
including the ability to eavesdrop electronically on conversations within the 
mods and to open single cells within particular mods to allow specific inmates 
to come and go. One deputy will always be in the control booth, and another 
will patrol the mods. 
</P>
<P>
In the old jail, deputy guards could look down hallways but not into all the 
cells. 
</P>
<P>
Each mod features 16 two-man cells, 10 feet by 7 feet, and a day room for 
eating, socializing and watching television. In addition, each group of three 
mods has an additional multipurpose room that is not yet equipped but may 
someday offer such diversions as table tennis and video games, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
A master control room will provide control over the entire facility, with the 
ability to override any individual mod control booth should it be taken over by 
inmates. 
</P>
<P>
Dormitory-style sleeping arrangements were maintained in the older section of 
the jail, but will be reserved for about 130 trusties -- inmates who during the 
day have greater freedom to move throughout the entire facility to tend to 
various chores. 
</P>
<P>
The new jail will also have an expanded law library to serve those inmates 
representing themselves in court, an expanded medical unit to house up to 30 
male and 10 female inmates, and three so-called "safety cells," or 
rubber-padded isolation units. 
</P>
<P>
With the expansion comes a new, on-site laundry room, to be staffed by female 
inmates, and a larger kitchen, staffed by male inmates. 
</P>
<P>
While a tunnel will connect the jail to the adjoining courthouse, inmates 
facing arraignment will not need to leave the building at all, and can simply 
stand before a video camera for their arraignment and appear live on a 
television monitor in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
About 75% of the inmates will either have been in custody awaiting arraignment 
or be awaiting sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the new technology -- including elaborate alarm systems to alert 
officials to fire or inmate unrest -- officials say they still will face 
age-old problems, including the sneaking of contraband into the jail. 
</P>
<P>
And not just drugs. The entire jail will be posted: No Smoking.

THE SILBERMAN SAGA RIVALS A TV THRILLER; 
</P>
<P>
ONCE STERLING IMAGE AS A SAN DIEGO MOVER AND SHAKER TARNISHED BY STRING OF 
CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN and RALPH FRAMMOLINO, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recounting one of "the great events of my life," Richard T. Silberman described 
the night that he and California Gov. Jerry Brown dined at Buckingham Palace: 
"We're just about to get out of this place and Prince Charles put his hand on 
my shoulder and says, 'Wouldn't it be bloody nice if he was President and I was 
king?' " 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, speaking at a 1987 college program about successful entrepreneurs, 
went on, "I think of all the things I've ever heard, this sort of just shook 
you up. There's no question in my mind who was going to be king." 
</P>
<P>
Until two weeks ago, there was no question in anybody's mind that Silberman was 
a man who hobnobbed at the level of presidents and kings. But then the man who 
had dined at Buckingham Palace was arrested by the FBI on charges that he had 
hatched a plan to launder drug money in meetings with a reputed mobster at a 
downtown Denny's. 
</P>
<P>
The circumstances that have kept his name in headlines shocked everyone who 
knew him or had heard of him. 
</P>
<P>
The son of an immigrant rag dealer, Silberman had parlayed the millions of 
dollars he made in the hamburger business and his success at political fund 
raising into a calling card that provided entree to elite social and political 
circles in San Diego, California and, at times, the world. 
</P>
<P>
Driven more by the thrill of high-powered deal-making than by ideology, 
Silberman rode his financial acumen and boundless energy to the rarefied air of 
multimillion-dollar business pacts and presidential politics. Though he 
displayed a chameleon-like tendency in his politics and occasionally trimmed 
ethical edges in business dealings, most simply saw those traits as evidence 
that Silberman, as one friend put it, "knows how to play big-league hardball." 
</P>
<P>
As a fast-food magnate, bank owner and state budget director under Gov. Edmund 
G. Brown Jr., Silberman, who turned 60 Saturday, gained a reputation as someone 
who could "make it happen." 
</P>
<P>
"To me, he seemed like a smaller-scale Donald Trump," one politically active 
lawyer said. "He was one of these guys who could get it done, whatever it was." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boasted of Deals Completed 
</P>
<P>
But, on the afternoon of April 7 in a San Diego hotel room, the FBI arrested 
Silberman, allegedly as he was negotiating to launder $1.1 million in what he 
was told was Colombian cocaine money. By that point, Silberman already had 
helped launder $300,000 in two earlier schemes, prosecutors allege in an 
indictment released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
According to an FBI transcript of taped conversations, Silberman counted 
reputed underworld figure Chris Petti among his longtime associates, boasted of 
ways to hide income overseas and talked comfortably about deals worth tens of 
thousands of dollars being transacted with shoe boxes and the need to bring in 
mob "muscle" when one transaction went sour. 
</P>
<P>
"Just for your background, this is not my first go-around, OK?" Silberman 
allegedly told an undercover FBI agent last November. "I've been here before." 
</P>
<P>
Silberman and his wife, San Diego County Board of Supervisors Chairman Susan 
Golding, have declared his innocence. But the accusations, backed up by a 
richly detailed federal affidavit quoting wiretap conversations of Silberman, 
prompted bewilderment from friends and enemies alike as they struggled to 
understand what could have happened to one of San Diego's most prominent and 
powerful businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
Since his arrest, San Diegans have wondered aloud whether Silberman could 
possibly have been involved in such activities for years, as suggested by his 
wiretapped boasts. 
</P>
<P>
Is it possible that Silberman, a man often reported to be worth $25 million and 
thought to have the Midas touch, was forced into a foolish caper under pressure 
from recent financial reverses? Or, as some of Silberman's defenders ask, could 
it be that he was the victim of government overzealousness? 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, the accusations were especially surprising to those who knew 
Silberman's early political work. 
</P>
<P>
As a young businessman, Silberman had backed a series of reform candidates who 
toppled C. Arnholt Smith, a San Diego financier later convicted of grand theft 
and income-tax evasion, from power in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'So Unexpected' 
</P>
<P>
"To me, he always had that air of integrity and honesty about him," said A. 
David Stutz, a deputy district attorney who has known Silberman for nearly two 
decades. "I could never conceive of him being other than honest and having 
integrity. That goes back 18 years. That's always been my impression . . . 
until I picked up the newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, Silberman is in jeopardy of joining Smith, J. David Dominelli 
and Roger Hedgecock on the roster of prominent San Diegans whose high esteem 
was transformed into ignominy through public or private transgressions. 
</P>
<P>
"This was so unexpected, so out of the blue, so out of character, that the 
shock was total," said Jack Canaan, a publicist who has known Silberman 20 
years. "This is like somebody telling me that Steve Garvey -- Mr. Clean, Mr. 
Nice Guy -- was going out and getting a bunch of girls pregnant. This is like 
the Steve Garvey of the political and business world." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 "We met people that he knew and, all of a sudden, I saw people in the world 
who did nothing but traded money. They didn't build amplifiers or TV sets. . . 
. In that process, LaMotte kind of opened my eyes to the world." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dick Silberman talking about business mentor and "second father," LaMotte 
T. Cohu, during a November, 1987, lecture given as part of a UC San Diego 
lecture series about entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 Dick Silberman was the son of two fathers. 
</P>
<P>
The first was Isadore Silberman, a Soviet immigrant who settled in San Diego in 
the late 1930s, collecting scraps of discarded clothing as rags for industrial 
use. 
</P>
<P>
Isadore Silberman inspired a special closeness with his only son. After 
Silberman separated from his first wife in 1973, he moved into an apartment 
down the hall from his father. For a vacation, Silberman once took his father 
on an excursion down the Yangtze River in China. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Michael Sternfield, who has known the Silberman family 16 years, said, 
"Dick treated his father with such tenderness and such respect, you don't 
forget something like this because you see it so rarely." 
</P>
<P>
Dick Silberman's second father inspired more awe than affection. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sold Newspapers 
</P>
<P>
LaMotte T. Cohu was a world-wise veteran of the corporate suites -- former 
president of American Airlines, TWA, General Dynamics Convair Division, and 
Northrup Aircraft. He smoked a pipe, wore fancy blue suits and introduced his 
protege to fast sports cars and high finance. 
</P>
<P>
The introduction to Cohu came during the mid-1950s, a time when Silberman had 
already cut his entrepreneurial teeth on a number of home-grown business 
ventures that centered on his fascination with electronics. 
</P>
<P>
As a Hoover High School student and valedictorian during the waning days of 
World War II, Silberman would sell newspapers at 5th and University avenues to 
buy radio parts to support his habit of tinkering with the sets. 
</P>
<P>
When the first television sets came out, he made a deal with a San Diego 
appliance dealer to demonstrate the novelty by driving around town in a truck 
equipped with an antenna. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman and a friend started a "video service club," which charged television 
owners a $10 membership fee for a maintenance contract on the new appliances. 
Silberman said his company sold 2,000 memberships in one week after advertising 
on San Diego's first television station. 
</P>
<P>
"That was one of the most important experiences of my life because I learned 
that, if you advertise something, there's a lot of people who believe it," 
Silberman said during the UCSD lecture. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Degree in Physics 
</P>
<P>
Silberman earned his physics degree from then-San Diego State College and took 
a job with General Dynamics Convair Division after he graduated in 1950. The 
Atlas missile program was beginning, and Silberman cashed in on the Cold War 
defense boom by manufacturing small parts for the missile program. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1950s Silberman met Cohu, who had moved to San Diego for a restless 
retirement. In Cohu, Silberman found a major backer for his firm, whose name 
was eventually changed to Cohu Electronics. He also found a man he would call 
his "second father." 
</P>
<P>
"LaMotte helped, I guess in ways I can't even describe, in sort of giving me a 
view of the world," Silberman said. "The fellow knew everybody, and I knew 
nobody." 
</P>
<P>
Cohu's world featured a network of businessmen who traded money -- buying 
companies, merging them with others, taking private firms public. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman's next move was further into that world. He left Cohu and started 
Electronic Capital Corp. with partner Charles Salik, an investment firm that 
was a precursor to today's venture capital funds. Silberman also established an 
offshore company for the purposes of investing in European electronics 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Though some of the investments made money, a series of losses prompted 
disgruntled board members to oust Silberman and Salik. 
</P>
<P>
The man who led the ouster was Jerome Kohlberg, who later became co-founder of 
the Kohlberg, Kravis &amp; Roberts buyout firm. Kohlberg said Friday that 
Silberman and Salik "milked" the companies by charging exorbitant management 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, he said, was "a very personable, bright, facile, articulate person. 
I trusted him in the beginning and would never trust him again." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Important Business Ally 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1960s, Silberman found his most important business ally in Robert 
O. Peterson, founder of the Jack in the Box hamburger chain. 
</P>
<P>
"Within about 33 seconds, when Bob asked me what I did and he was telling me 
what he did, we developed a very long and deep and probably the most 
significant business relationship I've ever had," Silberman said in his 
lecture. 
</P>
<P>
Before long, Silberman was working with Peterson to find the right financing 
for the chain of 15 fast-food restaurants. Silberman urged Peterson to talk to 
Wall Street brokers about making a public offering. The result: Peterson sold 
13% for $7.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I always used to describe Jack in the Box as a human vending machine," 
Silberman said in his lecture. "Basically, it allowed us to sell food for cash, 
have no accounts receivable and have no mechanical problems to fix with the 
vending machines because you have these humans there who are handing out the 
food." 
</P>
<P>
In 1968, Peterson and Silberman sold Jack in the Box to Ralston-Purina for $58 
million after the hamburger chain grew to more than 500 outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson and Silberman went on to engineer an unfriendly take-over of the 
Southern California First National Bank by acquiring a 22.8% controlling 
interest in stock. The coup was accomplished, in part, with the cooperation and 
money from banker C. Arnholt Smith, whose political lock on San Diego would 
later be broken by the pair. 
</P>
<P>
Their seven-year reign at the bank was marred by millions of dollars in bad 
loans. In the end, the banking venture wasn't the windfall that Jack in the Box 
had been; the pair basically broke even. 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators were displeased with how Silberman and Peterson handled the 
sale of their federally chartered bank to the Bank of Tokyo in 1975, the first 
such sale to the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called by Regulators 
</P>
<P>
To avoid the scrutiny of federal regulators, the pair merged the bank with a 
state-chartered financial institution owned by the Japanese buyers. That would 
make the sale exempt from federal regulation, prompting a call from Federal 
Reserve Board officials. 
</P>
<P>
"They called us in and said, 'You know, this isn't illegal, but it's improper,' 
" Silberman recounted in his UCSD lecture. Then, he added with a wave of his 
hand: "Well, we gave it a lot of thought, and we sold the bank." 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, Silberman struck a deal with the state to renovate a rundown motel on 
the state's Old Town park. He and interior decorator Diane Powers were the only 
bidders for concession rights on the structure. 
</P>
<P>
With Silberman's money and Powers' decorating know-how, the motel was 
transformed over a decade into the Bazaar del Mundo tourist attraction, four 
restaurants and 16 shops so popular that it surpassed the Hearst Castle in San 
Simeon as the state's most lucrative concession. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the lease remained tiny, only $3,600 a year, giving Silberman and Powers a 
windfall on a project that by 1979 grossed $10 million. To avoid a possible 
conflict, Silberman sold his interest in the Bazaar to Powers before going to 
Sacramento in 1977 to join Brown's cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
Powers retained Silberman as a consultant and continued to make installment 
payments to him for his share in the business, even when he served as state 
business and transportation secretary -- a post that gave him authority over 
the bazaar's four liquor licenses. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman failed to disclose his financial ties to Powers while lobbying state 
legislators on her behalf in mid-1981, after he left state employ. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an insult to me because he specifically told me . . . that he had no 
interest in this whatsoever," one lawmaker said. 
</P>
<P>
The state renegotiated Powers' lease so she would pay 4.5% of the Bazaar's 
gross, a figure that translated into more than $500,000 in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years it is not clear that Silberman has repeated his financial 
success of the 1960s and 1970s. His major venture has been Yuba Natural 
Resources, a gold-mining project in Marysville. Among the partners in the 
project were hotelier M. Larry Lawrence, former national Democratic Party 
Chairman Charles Manatt and J. David Dominelli, the La Jolla financier who was 
convicted of running a Ponzi scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Under Silberman's direction, Yuba has lost more than $6 million in the last 
five years. Federal securities reports and state court records show that Yuba 
faced lawsuits from creditors and a $515,000 judgment from the federal 
government for dredging for gold on land it did not own. In his scramble for 
new investors and capital, Silberman, one lawsuit alleges, raised money by 
selling off mining equipment that Yuba actually had leased from another 
company. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that you couldn't make a deal with the guy that was fair," said 
Herbert Caplan, president of U.S. Machinery Co., which owned the mining 
equipment. "He had to get that extra inch. He had to feel within himself that 
he had gotten the better of you." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Silberman and Golding disposed of much of their extensive real 
estate holdings. Moreover, with Golding seriously contemplating a campaign for 
lieutenant governor next year -- plans that most political observers now expect 
to be dropped -- Silberman faced the prospect of probably needing to raise or 
contribute several million dollars to that race. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like everything was closing in on the guy," publicist Canaan said. 
"He's got a mining operation that's like something out of Abbott and Costello, 
his wife wants to run for lieutenant governor, he's selling off his property. . 
. . And, all of a sudden, everything just blows up." 
</P>
<P>
"My life (has) given me a rare opportunity to manage $30 billion, and I really 
understand the arrogance of power. When I was the (state) director of finance, 
it was fabulous. . . . Being in government and signing off on $30-billion 
budgets and having discretionary accounts that you have to approve and being 
involved in negotiations with the federal government where you tell them you 
will or will not take their $2 billion -- the zeroes are fabulous! It's an 
incredible experience." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Richard Silberman, Nov. 12, 1987, lecture to UC San Diego program. 
</P>
<P>
If Silberman ended his most active political days marveling at the "zeroes" 
that he controlled with his pen, he was first drawn to politics for quite 
different reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, of the many ironies inherent in Silberman's current situation, perhaps 
none is greater than the fact that he entered politics as a good-government 
crusader determined to clean up local government and, as one associate put it, 
"sweep out the crooks." 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, Silberman and a handful of other prominent businessmen -- among them 
Peterson, who later would become the husband of San Diego Mayor Maureen 
O'Connor -- helped Edwin Miller Jr. win the district attorney's office in a 
bitter race that marked the beginning of the end for the old-boy network that 
for decades had controlled San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Expose It' 
</P>
<P>
Around the same time, Silberman and Peterson approached A. David Stutz, now a 
deputy district attorney and then a young Treasury agent, with an unusual 
proposal to leave his government post and become a San Diego "ombudsman" 
responsible for publicly exposing corruption. They offered to pay his salary, 
supply an office and a staff and guaranteed him the freedom to investigate even 
the most sacred cows of the San Diego Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
"What would happen if I found something about you two?" Stutz recalled asking. 
"Both of them, without hesitation, said, 'Expose it.' " 
</P>
<P>
That plan fizzled, but Silberman continued dabbling in local politics, backing 
candidates ranging from his good friend Jack Walsh to then-Democratic City 
Councilwoman O'Connor and Republican Mayor Pete Wilson. Silberman himself 
served in a variety of appointed positions in local government, including the 
city school board, the Stadium Authority, the downtown redevelopment board and 
the transit authority. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman became one of Wilson's closest confidants, forming, along with 
newspaper publisher Helen Copley, the triumvirate that sat atop San Diego's 
power structure. 
</P>
<P>
But in the mid-1970s, Silberman abruptly broke with Wilson to help Gov. Brown, 
whom Wilson hoped to unseat as governor in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
For Silberman, it was only one of several notable changes of political 
allegiance that led to inevitable questions about his motives. 
</P>
<P>
In one particularly messy shift that left hard feelings on all sides, Silberman 
pushed his political protege Lynn Schenk into a 1984 San Diego County 
supervisorial race, then married and bankrolled Schenk opponent Golding, whose 
campaign lambasted Schenk for having served under Brown -- ironically, in the 
position for which Silberman had recruited her. A slander lawsuit that Schenk 
filed shortly after Golding's victory was settled out of court last fall with 
Schenk agreeing to accept $150,000 from Golding's insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Glitzy Winners 
</P>
<P>
Though defenders saw the ease with which Silberman moved between parties and 
individuals as skillful political pragmatism, others viewed it as a lack of 
ideological commitment and loyalty, an interest more in being associated with 
glitzy winners than in their philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened with that Jerry Brown-Pete Wilson thing was that Dick simply 
decided that he'd rather have the governor of California as a friend than the 
mayor of San Diego," said former state Sen. President Pro Tem James Mills 
(D-San Diego). "He was a political celebrity freak to a certain extent. He 
wasn't very interested in helping anyone who wasn't a big fish. I think he 
approached those decisions, not out of principle, but in terms of what it meant 
for Dick Silberman." 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, the dark-haired, mustachioed Silberman moved quickly through a 
series of posts in the Brown Administration, where he came to be seen as an 
island of steady calm in a sea of chaos. 
</P>
<P>
"He brought a little sanity to the place," recalled B. T. Collins, himself one 
of Brown's top advisers. More importantly, no other adviser -- not Collins, not 
longtime chief of staff Gray Davis, not gubernatorial guru Jacques Barzaghi -- 
came close to performing the role for Brown that Silberman did. 
</P>
<P>
"Jerry was out of it concerning the way the world worked," remembered another 
confidant. "Dick was mature, sophisticated and could open major doors to the 
business community, which thought Jerry was from Mars." 
</P>
<P>
In Brown's eyes, Silberman represented something that he himself was not but 
very much needed: a trusted counselor who understood the concerns, needs and 
agendas of business people and -- equally important -- the nuts and bolts of 
how to make things work. As a bonus, Silberman also knew how to tap business 
for big bucks to finance political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman displayed those talents as the fund-raiser for Brown's belated 1976 
five-primary presidential campaign that, though quixotic from the start, threw 
a serious scare into Jimmy Carter's run for the White House. The week that 
Carter was inaugurated, Silberman assembled 35 major corporation executives in 
New York for a luncheon with Brown aimed at turning around his anti-business 
image. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Named Finance Director 
</P>
<P>
Sufficiently impressed, Brown asked Silberman -- then 48 years old -- to run 
the Business and Transportation Agency in early 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a little bit of senior gray hair in Dick that Jerry could bounce 
things off of, as opposed to the 'Brownies' who were young and inexperienced," 
one close aide recalled. 
</P>
<P>
After serving briefly as Brown's chief of staff during the governor's 
successful 1978 reelection campaign, Silberman was appointed state finance 
director, the person in charge of preparing the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
During his Senate confirmation hearings, Silberman weathered mild controversy 
stemming from his role in arranging contributions to the unsuccessful 1978 
reelection campaign of Lt. Gov. Mervyn Dymally from two men with alleged 
underworld links: $10,000 from Las Vegas casino owner Allen Glick, of La Jolla, 
and $5,000 from Irv Roston of the La Costa Land Co. 
</P>
<P>
Though Brown himself publicly chided Silberman for a lack of "prudence" in 
soliciting the donations, the controversy quickly dissipated and had been 
largely forgotten until the FBI affidavit alleged longtime ties to Petti. 
</P>
<P>
Petti's attorney, Oscar Goodman, describes his client's relationship with 
Silberman as "not as much a social friendship as a case of two guys sharing the 
same company frequently . . . in excess of 10 years." However, in more than a 
dozen interviews with people close to Silberman, none was aware that he even 
knew Petti. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the kind of thing I find it hard to believe you wouldn't have heard 
gossip about," said local banker Murray Galinson, a longtime political activist 
who was a top national staffer on Walter Mondale's 1984 presidential campaign. 
"But there was never a whisper, never a rumor." 
</P>
<P>
As often happens in the wake of such a stunning development, Silberman's 
political image already has undergone some preliminary historical revisionism. 
While claiming not to be trying to distance the party from Silberman, many 
Democrats nevertheless have gone to lengths to point out that the "major 
Democratic fund-raiser" description that usually preceded his name in news 
stories overlooks the fact that he also has been a prominent supporter of 
Republicans such as Wilson and Golding. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Selected Few 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought Dick Silberman was less of a major Democratic activist than 
he was an activist for a selected few candidates," said Phil Connor, former 
local Democratic Party chairman. "His style was to pick his horses carefully 
and then ride them." 
</P>
<P>
Silberman seldom contributed to the local and state Democratic candidates, and 
party leaders were privately chagrined that Silberman usually failed to do some 
of the perfunctory things expected of high-rollers, such as buying tables at 
party fund-raising functions. 
</P>
<P>
Just as Silberman found it difficult to duplicate his early business success, 
so too did his political star wane after he returned to San Diego in the early 
1980s. Other than lending $243,000 to Golding's 1984 campaign against Schenk -- 
nearly half of her total contributions -- Silberman has maintained a relatively 
low political profile over the past 6 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman provided perhaps the best description of his "life after Jerry 
Brown." 
</P>
<P>
"When you have been supposedly the czar of roads and S&amp;Ls and banks and 
corporations and houses, and you come back to earth and you come back home to 
San Diego, it's amazing how seldom your phone rings," Silberman said in his 
1987 UCSD lecture. "It's amazing how unimportant you are, and it's amazing how 
fast the reality hits you. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God, I generally look at life as something you should laugh (at), and 
for four or five or six months, I laughed about the reality that all of a 
sudden not being in Sacramento sort of took the veneer off. And I was back to 
who I was, and that did not involve all those zeroes." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the age of being careful of who you quote and what you say and where you 
went to school and who your father was, and whether you did or didn't work in 
the coal mine, one has to be particularly careful. I must say, I have a great 
deal of security in my past life because I love living in a country where the 
FBI can't find marijuana on Harvard's campus. I feel much safer now after the 
Ginsburg affair." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Silberman, UCSD lecture, speaking about U.S. Supreme Court nominee Douglas 
Ginsburg, whose 1987 nomination was withdrawn after it was learned that, while 
on the faculty of the Harvard Law School, he had smoked marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Ginsburg never lit up with an FBI agent in the room, which is 
tantamount to what Silberman allegedly did in the money-laundering case. 
</P>
<P>
According to the FBI, Silberman stumbled into an undercover sting set up during 
the latter stages of the agency's 2 1/2-year investigation into organized-crime 
operations in Southern California and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, Petti unknowingly approached an FBI informer and an undercover 
agent, telling them that he had a "wealthy associate" -- Silberman -- who 
perhaps could help launder money. Over the next six months, prosecutors allege 
that Silberman either used or discussed various methods -- among them, a stock 
swap involving a mining company he controlled, the purchase of U.S. Treasury 
bonds and wiring cash to foreign banks -- to launder money that he was told 
originated with Colombian cocaine dealers. 
</P>
<P>
In a 76-page affidavit, federal prosecutors portray Silberman's alleged role in 
those schemes with vivid details that sound as if they were drawn from a 
Hollywood script: cash stuffed in shoe boxes, Swiss accounts, clandestine 
meetings in hotels and restaurants, transactions recorded by concealed cameras, 
and threats of bringing in Petti's "muscle" when a deal went sour. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of this, believe it or not, is . . . as much for your protection as 
mine," Silberman said in one taped conversation, explaining why he preferred to 
use couriers to pick up the money. "There's no place I can walk and not believe 
that someone might recognize me. . . . As I say, I've done it 15 or 20 times, 
it works like absolute, clean, uninterrupted, greased lightning." 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit also alleges that undercover agents repeatedly talked about the 
source of the money being Colombian drug traffickers and that Silberman was 
uncomfortable when the words were used. "Let's not even, uh, use any of the 
words anymore, OK?" Silberman allegedly said at one point. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'You Always Wonder' 
</P>
<P>
Though Silberman's friends note that only one side of the story has been heard 
to date, even some of those closest to him admit that they are shocked by what 
the FBI tapes are reported to contain. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you always wonder about entrapment in a case like this," one lawyer 
said. "But the question in my mind is, even if that happened, why didn't he 
just walk away from the thing? Some of the most damning words come out of his 
own mouth." 
</P>
<P>
Were those the words of a man who, as one friend termed it, "put on moral 
blinders" because of dire financial difficulties? If so, was it an isolated 
misstep or simply the only one uncovered? 
</P>
<P>
"A shock like this forces you to reevaluate everything," said longtime 
political activist George Mitrovich. "Yesterday's truth becomes today's 
question mark. . . . Dick Silberman has done a lot of terrific things for this 
community. Even if any of this is true, that doesn't change. But it makes you 
wonder about things you didn't wonder about before."

The death toll from a hailstorm that ripped through southwest China's Sichuan 
province has reached 87, the official Xinhua News Agency said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
About 4,200 people in 10 cities were injured in Thursday's storm, which caused 
an estimated $40 million in damage in the hardest-hit city of Luzhou. 
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Sichuan officials as saying that 90,000 homes were damaged in 
Luzhou and that 40% of the windows and doors in high buildings were damaged. 
Fifty-two air force training aircraft stationed in Luzhou were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
More than 60,000 houses in Gulin County and 4,300 in Zigong City were 
destroyed, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The storm struck shortly after midnight and continued until 4 a.m. Thursday, 
pelting the area with hailstorms.

FOG HELPS CURB 160-ACRE FIRE NEAR ESCONDIDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 380 firefighters from the California Department of Forestry and local 
fire departments battled a brush fire Saturday that torched at least 160 acres 
in Harmony Grove, just west of Escondido, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze, which did not threaten any homes, began about 1:30 p.m. and was 
still burning late Saturday night, according to Audrey Hagan, a CDF 
spokeswoman. Authorities were expecting the fire to be contained by midnight. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze, which raged through Elfin Forest, was started by children playing 
with matches, fire investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Forestry Department firefighters were assisted by neighboring departments, 
including units from San Diego, Escondido, Vista, Fallbrook, Carlsbad and Camp 
Pendleton. No one was reported injured. 
</P>
<P>
Though the fire had not yet been extinguished, high humidity was reportedly 
slowing the fire's progress. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a fog bank rolling in and that's helping," Hagan said. "Now if we were 
in the middle of the summer and there was a Santa Ana wind blowing, we would be 
in big trouble."

Raul Espinoza works like a man possessed. The 42-year-old artist can be found 
at almost any hour of the day or night sitting at his enormous easel. Carefully 
poised in his right hand is the tool of his trade -- an airbrush. With the 
pencil-like brush that emits a fine stream of air and paint, Espinoza can 
create everything from a winged horse soaring through a cluster of clouds to a 
hamburger. Espinoza is the president and an instructor of the San Diego 
Airbrush Academy. In addition to teaching monthly classes there, he has a host 
of clients who enlist him to paint brochures and maps, touch up family 
photographs, and airbrush billowy clouds on ceilings and walls in their homes. 
Espinoza's work will be on display this weekend at his new downtown studio 
during ARTWALK. Times staff writer Caroline Lemke interviewed Espinoza at the 
airbrush academy and Don Bartletti photographed him.

I worked for different graphics companies. As I was working for these companies 
as an in-house designer or painter or sign artist, the thought behind my mind 
was, "Get out of here. You're only working for somebody else." I was thankful 
for the job and I did my best, but it wasn't really moving me. It wasn't the 
wheels I needed. So, when I started my own school, the response I got was 
tremendous, and I said, "I'm self-employed now. I have more freedom now." 
</P>
<P>
There was a very critical point where I almost dropped the whole thing. In the 
middle of this five-year span that I've been teaching at the airbrush academy, 
I almost fell apart because I wasn't getting enrollments, I was at a very low 
ebb in my life. Relationships weren't happening. I was as alone as you can get. 
But I believe in prayer and I would say in my mind, "OK, I'm going to drop the 
school. I'm going to forget it." What would happen the next month? Calls would 
come in saying "I want to take your class, I want to take your class!" And it 
would happen like that from month to month to month. 
</P>
<P>
Prayer doesn't give you one answer. The Lord sort of tests you along the way. 
"Do you really want this? What are you made out of? How much fiber do you 
have?" I was literally against the wall. But I'm flying now. It really feels 
good. Because I did keep getting enrollments I knew this was the right thing to 
do, because if it isn't, it's going to fall, it's going to fail. 
</P>
<P>
I was about 6 1/2 years old when I started drawing, and teachers along the way 
started realizing I could do things. Like, if I drew a train, all the wheels 
were on the track. If I drew horses, all the hoofs were there, drawn correctly, 
not accurately, but all the parts were there. So, I had a keen observing eye, 
and I feel that was given to me. 
</P>
<P>
If teachers along the way hadn't encouraged me to pursue art, I probably 
wouldn't have. It's frightening in the sense that if the educational system 
isn't there and keen enough to see young talent, I guess it could be dangerous 
because a lot of talent could go to the wayside. That's why, as a teacher, I 
also have to be enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
I love painting wildlife and nature. I am getting trained for my master's work 
and that means incorporating wildlife and aspects of the world we live in and 
introducing to it a little bit of the spiritual aspect of why we're here, and 
how we can relate to each other as human beings who have a certain amount of 
love and discretion, sensitivity for others as well as compassion. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the frustrations of being an artist are that you are alone a lot. Some 
people might say that's a blessing, but when you're alone a lot . . . I have 
learned to be my best friend. If I went out to a movie or dancing or something, 
I wouldn't get any work done. And in fact when I do go out and I have paintings 
in my mind, I'm not enjoying it because I'm not partying with friends. My mind 
is at work. 
</P>
<P>
When I have a show and people see my stuff and get inspired, that's the joy for 
me at that point. The crowd isn't enjoying it as I'm doing it, but they enjoy 
it afterward, when it's done.

HELP FOR THE POOR MOVES FARTHER AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These people, the homeless and poor, say they don't need more problems. 
</P>
<P>
Maeola Campbell, 39, who spends nights on a park bench at Long Beach City Hall, 
says it's tough enough to walk 19 blocks to the welfare office twice a month to 
keep her relief checks coming. 
</P>
<P>
Veronica Ruiz, 21, must gather up her four small children and trudge several 
blocks from a central city apartment to stake a place in line at the same 
office. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Has No Car 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Matson, a 31-year-old disabled welder, also has no car, so he walks to 
the crowded Long Beach Boulevard facility. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just too many problems already," an exasperated Matson said last week 
as he paced in front of the welfare office at 1917 Long Beach Blvd., one of 
four in the Long Beach and harbor areas to be moved this year into a single 
building near Compton. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now you can't survive on the $300 they give you, and now we'll have to 
find this other place," he said. "How much does the bus cost? A dollar?" 
</P>
<P>
It will cost $1.35, including one transfer, for Campbell, Ruiz, Matson and 
thousands of other welfare recipients without automobiles to reach the new 
office when it opens in December. And another $1.35 to get back to their 
low-income neighborhoods of Wilmington, San Pedro and central and downtown Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The county says the high-tech office -- planned at a former wheel-making plant 
on Santa Fe Avenue at the 91 Freeway -- will replace four shabby and cramped 
welfare offices that serve about 30,000 people who live from Torrance to the 
Orange County line. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be easier, more economical to do what we do at one place as opposed to 
four separate locations," John Zarcone, director of administrative services for 
the county Department of Public Social Services, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
In the new facility, the county plans to install "a brand-new modular furniture 
approach that will facilitate the use of computer terminals by the workers," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The consolidation will make services harder to reach for the needy, he 
acknowledged, "but service will be better when they get there." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
20% More Space 
</P>
<P>
The county expects no drop in the number of recipients reporting to the new 
office, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The new, 133,000-square-foot regional headquarters will have about 20% more 
space than the old offices combined. This means that poor people, whose numbers 
are steadily increasing in the area, will have a place to sit while they wait 
for hours for interviews and counseling, Zarcone said. At present, they often 
straggle onto the street at the large Long Beach Boulevard facility, angering 
auto dealers who are the closest neighbors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen administrative jobs and a few clerical positions will be eliminated as 
a work force of 660 is moved to a single location, saving more than $600,000 a 
year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Zarcone said, "in terms of actual money," the new building will cost 
more than the old ones: about $2 million a year to lease instead of $1.1 
million; or $1.29 a square foot, up from 82 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say that even if money is saved, the county's arguments for the 
consolidation are unconvincing. They maintain that people who desperately need 
help will not get it when the four local offices are closed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a disaster waiting to happen, because those people who can't get there 
will end up not having the benefits they need to survive. Those in the worst 
condition . . . will be least likely to get there," said Toby Rothschild, 
executive director of the Legal Aid Foundation of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The current offices -- in San Pedro, the Long Beach westside near Wilmington 
and in downtown and north Long Beach -- are probably as well-located as 
possible, Rothschild said. Welfare hotels, cheap housing and homeless shelters 
are near them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Distances Criticized 
</P>
<P>
But the new office is about eight miles from downtown Long Beach and 12 miles 
from central San Pedro. Rothschild said he can hardly imagine a worse site. 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Fe and the 91 Freeway is a long, long way from downtown Long Beach," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gertrude Kopczak, a longtime clerk supervisor at the San Pedro office, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the people who come to the small harbor-area office get there 
on foot, many referred by nearby detoxification and homeless shelters, she 
said. "This means that everybody from here to the far side of Long Beach will 
have to get to Compton the best way they can." 
</P>
<P>
Pointing to a faded Department of Public Social Services logo, she said, "That 
sign should say Department of Disservice, because we are not serving our 
clients." 
</P>
<P>
But county officials involved in the consolidation say it is justified and 
necessary, a goal they have pursued with the approval of the County Board of 
Supervisors since 1986. It is part of a policy to combine county facilities 
that has reduced the number of welfare offices overseeing general relief and 
dependent-children cases from 30 to 15 in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Other factors also argued for a single office in the southern part of the 
county, they said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the lease at the 10,000-square-foot San Pedro office is retained 
only month-to-month because its owner, the Port of Los Angeles, wants the site 
for construction, county leasing official Claus Marx said. 
</P>
<P>
"Trying to relocate something like that in San Pedro is a little tough," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The lease on the Long Beach westside office expires in about a year and the 
city Redevelopment Agency is interested in the property, Marx said. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Poe, area aide to Supervisor Deane Dana, said crowding at the Long Beach 
Boulevard office and at a nearby Department of Children's Services center has 
been a problem for years. Since both need more space, welfare will move out of 
its 70,000-square-foot office and children's services will move in. 
</P>
<P>
That way, Poe said, the county will keep its bargain, 50-cents-a-square-foot 
lease on the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Recent history also argues against assertions that the needy will not find 
their way to less convenient offices, said Zarcone. The number of recipients 
has not dropped as the county eliminated half its general relief offices, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But those statistics may be of little comfort to Maeola Campbell, who said of 
the new office one recent early morning, "I won't have no way to get there."

FRONT-YARD PARKING A LITTLE CLOSER; 
</P>
<P>
LAWNDALE OFFICIALS BUCK WARNING OF 'DOG PATCH' IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BAIRD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In spite of warnings that Lawndale will resemble Li'l Abner's hillbilly 
hometown, "Dog Patch," if front-yard parking is permitted, the City Council has 
taken a stand in favor of it. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 3 to 2 Thursday to ask the Planning Commission to review a 
proposed ordinance loosening city restrictions on front-yard parking. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion on the ordinance is vehemently divided in Lawndale, with some 
residents, such as Randy Brendia, raising the specter of "Dog Patch" and 
warning that front-yard parking could hurt local property values. 
</P>
<P>
A former Midwesterner, he noted that front-yard parking in East St. Louis, 
Ill., created "a trashy appearance" that led to substantially lower property 
values than in the neighboring community of St. Louis, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Favor Plan 
</P>
<P>
"This ordinance is an attack on every single person's property values in this 
city," Brendia said. 
</P>
<P>
But other residents favor the plan. Several, including Steve Mino, have lobbied 
loudly for an ordinance that would let them widen their driveways to provide an 
extra parking space on the front lawn. Front-yard parking is needed for older 
properties that do not provide adequate parking, Mino said. 
</P>
<P>
In March, four council members, including Mayor Sarann Kruse, said they would 
vote in favor of such an ordinance. It would help solve the city's chronic 
parking shortage by getting residents' cars onto their own properties and 
freeing parking spaces on the street, the council majority said. 
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's meeting, three of the four council members held to that view. But 
Kruse reversed herself, saying that when news of the proposed ordinance was 
published in The Times a few weeks ago, she received more than 200 calls from 
residents who object to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adopted in 1984 
</P>
<P>
The city's current restrictions against front-yard parking were adopted by the 
council in 1984. Then-Councilman Jim Ramsey hailed the legislation as a way to 
"get rid of the Billy Goat Acres Syndrome" in Lawndale. 
</P>
<P>
Planners generally view front-yard parking as an eyesore in residential 
neighborhoods, said Mark Winogrond, a former Lawndale planning director who now 
heads West Hollywood's Planning Department. 
</P>
<P>
Council opinion has shifted since the 1984 regulations were adopted. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, council members Larry Rudolph, Harold E. Hofmann and Carol Norman 
voted to send the ordinance allowing front-yard parking to the Planning 
Commission for review. 
</P>
<P>
They directed that front-yard parking spaces should be permitted alongside 
driveways rather than parallel to the street, as the staff had proposed. 
</P>
<P>
Kruse voted against the ordinance Thursday, as did Councilman Dan McKenzie, a 
longtime opponent of lawn parking.

TAKING PAGE FROM CAPISTRANO, COLLEGE IS NOW FOR BIRDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 800 cliff swallows returning from South America to roost at College of 
the Canyons got a royal welcome Saturday from a community that once tried to 
drive them off with gooey repellents, sonic beepers and high-powered water 
hoses. 
</P>
<P>
Now their presence is regarded as a feather in the cap of the school, although 
sidewalks, windows, building facades -- and passers-by -- are still fair game 
for their droppings. 
</P>
<P>
"They're beautiful birds, and we've decided to make the most of them," said 
Dianne Van Hook, the college's president. "It's very special that they come 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Van Hook was a victim of a passing swallow during her first day on campus in 
July, she said. Her tan suit had to be dry-cleaned, but the incident did not 
turn her against the birds, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the swallows are now viewed as an asset to the otherwise nondescript 
community college, just as they are to Mission San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Welcoming Ceremony 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, about 200 people attended what officials hope will become an 
annual event to welcome the birds, which form colonies and make their nests in 
groups of hundreds along the ledges of concrete campus buildings. They will lay 
their eggs and tend their young until August, when they begin the 6,000-mile 
return to South America. 
</P>
<P>
While ornithology professors gave tours of the bird colony, members of the 
campus biology club did brisk business selling T-shirts emblazoned with 
pictures of the swallows and the logo, "Even Swallows Come Home to Valencia." 
Proceeds from the sales will help fund a three-year research project to study 
the birds' nesting behavior, migration, mating rituals and social behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Biology instructor Betty Rose said researchers hope to publish the results of 
studies as early as next year. 
</P>
<P>
A Yale University professor and his wife have been researching cliff swallows 
for nearly a decade, studying such subjects as what factors cause animals to 
form colonies, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great educational experience, but you need an umbrella to protect you 
from the guano," said Gale Hutchins, a biology student who spent last summer 
observing the birds and helping to band them for identification. 
</P>
<P>
College officials did not always regard the birds so kindly. For 12 years, they 
tried devices such as beepers, stuffed owls and chemical repellents to 
discourage the birds from building their nests, which resemble mud igloos. One 
season they even used high-powered water hoses to wash down the nests every day 
in an effort to drive the birds away. 
</P>
<P>
None of the methods worked well, and some were lethal to the birds, which are 
protected by federal law. In 1985, the president of the college had to pay a 
$500 federal fine after 12 birds died when their wings became glued together 
with a substance that had been spread on building ledges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$600 Window 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the school put 2-by-10-foot panels of nylon parachute cloth along the 
eaves, hoping that panels flapping in the wind would force the birds to go 
elsewhere to build nests. When a bird got tangled in the fabric, maintenance 
workers had to break a $600 window to save the bird. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, officials decided to leave the birds alone and start the research 
project, Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally, we're proud of them," Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
So proud, in fact, that flyers promoting Saturday's event included a poem 
written specially for the swallows by Dan Jacobs, a biology student at the 
school: 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that I 
</P>
<P>
 Shall never see 
</P>
<P>
 More beauty -- 
</P>
<P>
 Than, in the swallows -- at C.O.C." 
</P>

MORE PEOPLE ARE PAYING TO JUMP INTO HOT WATER BUT ARE SPAS WORTH IT?

SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bobbing in the big, old-fashioned tub, toes hooked over a water spout to keep 
from capsizing as tiny bubbles effervesce up the length of a sore spine, it's 
hard to worry whether this is just what the doctor ordered. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't have anything wrong with you, if you lead a strenuous life, it's 
just for relaxation," said bathhouse attendant Gertrude Zorn. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, said Zorn, who for 15 years has been drawing the water for the tub 
and returning to wrap the client in a hot sheet when it's time to get out, the 
bubbly float on naturally carbonated water is good for arthritis, rheumatism 
and bad backs. 
</P>
<P>
The bathhouses -- with their white tile walls, ceiling fans and small 
individual suites with giant tubs -- look as though they haven't changed from 
the 1930s, when the state decided the area's carbonated waters were a natural 
resource. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing trendy here, especially the price: $8.75 for the soak, room and 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
But elsewhere, spas are an old-fashioned idea gone yuppie -- and a 
multimillion-dollar business. For many, the spa is the chrome-and-glass spot 
where you ride exercise machines in a fuchsia leotard. It can mean being 
floated in a seawater tub or swathed in an herbal wrap. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bookings Triple 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Joseph, a New York entrepreneur who jumped in just as the water was 
heating up, said his travel agency has tripled in both staff and bookings since 
he began specializing in spa vacations a year and a half ago. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph, owner of Spa-Finders Travel Arrangements Ltd., estimates that in five 
years, the number of spas in this country has increased from 30 to 150 and is 
still growing. 
</P>
<P>
About 1.2 million Americans spend $700 million to $800 million annually going 
to spas, Joseph estimated. The majority of his clients, who spend about $1,000 
for a week's retreat, are low-level female executives in their 30s. 
</P>
<P>
Is the new emphasis on physical conditioning simply a fad, or is it really good 
for one's health? 
</P>
<P>
Are you ready for this? Spending $1,000 to $3,500 week at a spa can be as 
healthful as sitting at home in your rocker or taking a hot shower, according 
to both a cardiologist and a sports psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
"Does it feel good to go sit in a whirlpool or a hot mineral bath? Of course it 
feels good," said psychologist Eric Margenau of New York City. 
</P>
<P>
"Does it serve a medicinal purpose? I haven't seen any evidence of that." 
</P>
<P>
What about stress management? That's the new buzz word, Joseph said. 
</P>
<P>
The experts say any form of relaxation and exercise will do if you plan for it 
and do it regularly. If you go off once a year, expecting an expensive vacation 
to be your lifeline for the next 12 months, you're in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"I like spas, they're great. But I've been to great dude ranches that I've come 
back from just as refreshed," said Margenau, author of a new book called 
"Sports Without Pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. James M. Rippe, the cardiologist who heads the Exercise Physiology 
Laboratory at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, 
echoed that. He said people must not delude themselves that "they can go twice 
a year and make up for the excesses of the rest of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph, whose agency has sent nearly 4,000 clients to spas around the world 
since March 1987, said the better resorts work on behavior modification. In 
other words, they don't just put a client in an aerobics class or on a diet, 
"they have a whole program on stress management and healthy living, things to 
take home with you." 
</P>
<P>
Spas as places to take mineral waters go back at least as far as the Romans. 
</P>
<P>
In Europe and Japan, people have been spa-minded for centuries. One town in 
Japan -- Beppu, known for boiling ponds that shoot mud into the air -- gets 12 
million visitors each year, Joseph said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Granddaddy of Spas 
</P>
<P>
In this country, traditional spas with a chic clientele were booming before the 
turn of the century, places like Mineral Wells, Tex.; Hot Springs, Ark.; White 
Sulphur Springs, W. Va., and Calistoga, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Saratoga, the granddaddy of American spas whose medicinal springs were 
discovered in the late 18th Century, was long a social hot spot with its added 
cache of a thoroughbred racing season. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, Margenau sees the proliferation of spas as part of a burgeoning 
"stress industry." 
</P>
<P>
"The whole business is blown up way out of proportion. There is a whole economy 
built up around stress reduction, the new American fads: spas, contraptions, a 
$1,000 worth of vitamins." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of those remedies, he recommends altering day-to-day patterns to defuse 
pressure. Slow down, he said, take a longer lunch, schedule exercise. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, stress exists. It always has. But most of the stresses are very easily 
remedied." 
</P>

"Every man's spa is his shower," said Rippe, the author of many medical and 
fitness books. 
</P>
<P>
The medical school professor cites his own studies and those of colleagues that 
indicate that showers and sitting in a recliner can reduce tension and anxiety 
and that blood pressure is reduced by regular programs of walking. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Sloan, a confirmed spa-goer, isn't interested in hearing that she could 
have stayed home and taken a shower. 
</P>
<P>
"It was wonderful," she said of a posh Florida spa. "A massage was part of 
every day. The food, absolutely out of this world." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph's catalogue says a week at the resort Sloan visited also included greens 
fees, herbal wrap, salt-glo loofa scrub, hairdo, makeup, manicure, pedicure and 
lectures -- all for $1,970. 
</P>
<P>
"A spa," said Sloan, president of a New Jersey public relations firm, "means 
attention and luxury. 
</P>
<P>
"Plush towels, beautiful locker rooms, pampering. If you have to wait for a 
massage appointment, they give you a cup of bouillon," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine it was not good for you."

A COORDINATED BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Santa Ana and Anaheim, church and state are not as separate as they used to 
be, and the result, without compromising any bedrock Constitutional concepts, 
promises to produce a healthier, more livable and crime-free community. 
</P>
<P>
In a coordinated effort prompted by a mutual concern over the growing drug 
problem and local government's failure to adequately address the issue, members 
of 15 churches in Santa Ana and Anaheim have successfully banded together to 
secure a commitment from the Anaheim and Santa Ana city councils that they 
would launch a coordinated effort to help eradicate drugs. That effort will 
include police, prosecutors, judges and city and school officials, among 
others. 
</P>
<P>
The approach is not new. It was used more than 10 years ago when priests from 
Northern California came into Santa Ana to teach barrio residents how to 
organize and get action rather than lip service from government officials. 
</P>
<P>
But this is the most widespread use of the church-oriented program in the 
county thus far, involving hundreds of members of 15 churches and synagogues in 
an ecumenical approach that seeks to prompt local government to use its powers 
and resources to adequately address the community concerns raised by the 
congregations. 
</P>
<P>
It is a tool that has proven effective. And it has drawn the interest of U.S. 
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), who is scheduled to meet this week with the 
group that has adopted the formal name of Orange County Congregation-Community 
Organizations. The interfaith group, after deciding to zero in on the "drug 
epidemic," studied the problem for 6 months and concluded that local agencies 
are not coordinating effective programs, that too few police officers and 
prosecutors are assigned to the problem, that there are too few detoxification 
beds and jail cells, and that not enough money is being spent on anti-drug 
programs in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
The approach taken by the 15 congregations in Anaheim and Santa Ana in 
targeting a specific issue, starting at the grass-roots level where it has the 
best chance of success, and concentrating on nonsectarian stands that solely 
seek to improve community life, is a realistic and effective way for 
congregations to get involved.

OTHERS' OBITUARIES COMMEMORATE LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marti Parker's letter of April 9 is correct. The media shouldn't intrude on a 
family's grief. 
</P>
<P>
I have the story about Nadia Puente's funeral and others like it. I have kept 
them for a special reason. Last year, a friend died. I never got to say goodby. 
That wasn't a word in the vocabulary of this friend's family. Words of hope and 
cheer were, although we all knew what the outcome would be when the disease ran 
its course. 
</P>
<P>
After my friend's death, there was no obituary, no funeral, no burial, no 
memorial. That is why I collect obituaries and articles on death and dying. I 
keep a scrapbook with the obits and articles on death and dying. I keep a 
scrapbook with the obits and stories of funerals and memorial services for the 
friend who had none of these. 
</P>
<P>
To some, this may seem odd, but I've never before faced such a thing. Deaths, 
yes. Funerals, yes. But never such silence and never such aloneness. There may 
be grief groups for parents who lose children, families whose loss was through 
violence, for widows and widowers, but there is no group for people who lose 
friends. Or is there?

LEGACY OF STATE'S COASTAL ACT CAN BE SEEN BY WHAT'S NOT THERE NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY B. ROSENER, Judy B. Rosener is a former member of the California 
Coastal Commission and a faculty member of the UC Irvine Graduate School of 
Management. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As spades begin to turn over dirt on the majestic coastal lands between Corona 
del Mar and Laguna Beach, it seems appropriate to think about what might have 
been had there been no Coastal Act. 
</P>
<P>
It is no accident that those who use Coast Highway have a glorious view of the 
Pacific Ocean for a 3-mile stretch along the Irvine Coast. It is no accident 
that the public now has access to the beaches that hug the bluffs that line the 
water's edge. It is no accident that when development takes place on the inland 
side of the Irvine downcoast property, wildlife habitats will be protected, the 
watershed will remain, the effects of traffic and air pollution will be 
minimized, and both the public and the landowner will benefit. 
</P>
<P>
The present Irvine development plan is no accident because the Coastal Act 
forced discussions among the Irvine Co., government agencies and 
environmentalists who together shaped the company's plans. Had there been no 
Coastal Act, chances are there would now be fewer views, limited public access, 
fewer wildlife habitats and watersheds preserved, and more intense development. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to suggest that the Irvine Co. has no social conscience nor concern 
for environmental quality. However, the goal of a landowner is to develop land 
to its highest and best use. This does not always generate views available to 
the public, access and environmental quality. Therefore, it is the role of 
government to see that a given development does not adversely affect the 
quality of the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Monitoring development along the coast is the task that was given to the 
Coastal Commission by the 1972 Coastal Act, and monitor it does! Yet for a 
variety of reasons, most residents have little awareness of the connection 
between the California Coastal Act and the coastal landscape in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Coast development plan is but one example of the monitoring process. 
Other examples abound. Before the Coastal Act was passed, the Avco property in 
Laguna Niguel (part of which is home to the Ritz-Carlton hotel) was planned for 
much more intense private development. The original Avco plans called for a 
commercial strip along Coast Highway, a private golf course that would not 
extend to the sea, and building that would make the sticks and stucco in the 
area there today seem insignificant. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal commissioners and their staff spent years working with Avco to change 
the company's blueprints. And although there are still pockets of opposition to 
what is being built, the Laguna Niguel development today shows far more 
sensitivity to environmental concerns than the one proposed before there was a 
Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Crescent Bay Park in Laguna Beach is another example of the work of the Coastal 
Commission. Each year thousands of people visit the park to revitalize their 
spirits or watch the start of the Ensenada Race or even exchange their marriage 
vows. This beautiful vista point exists because the Coastal Commission, under a 
provision of the Coastal Act, was able to deny the building permits for two 
large homes that would have blocked the view of the famous sea lion playground. 
By denying the permits, the Laguna Beach and the county were able to purchase 
the land for public enjoyment. 
</P>
<P>
The Balboa Pavilion site, which boasts of eating places, boat rentals, clothing 
shops, a merry-go-round and Ferris wheel, is another example. Newport Beach had 
rezoned the area from commercial to residential and approved a proposed 
development for locked-gate condominiums on the site. The Coastal Commission 
denied the permit. Had that not happened, the Balboa Ferry today would be 
transporting condo owners instead of families and bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
In Huntington Beach, the degraded Bolsa Chica wetlands now have a chance for 
restoration because of the combined efforts of the Bolsa Chica Amigos and the 
Coastal Commission. These wetlands -- which serve as open space, flood control, 
a toxics filter, a fish nursery and a bird sanctuary -- were destined to become 
a massive commercial yacht harbor. 
</P>
<P>
It was predicted that the proposed harbor could have resulted in destruction of 
valuable beachfront, would have necessitated the moving of Pacific Coast 
Highway and would have cost the taxpayers millions of dollars. Coastal 
wetlands, a public resource, have been devoured by private developers up and 
down the coast, and local government officials now acknowledge that the Bolsa 
Chica wetlands need to be protected. 
</P>
<P>
These are a few of the major accomplishments of the Coastal Commission in 
Orange County over the last 15 years. If colored pins were to be stuck in the 
places along the coast to indicate where development plans were denied or 
improved, where beach access was obtained, where coastal bluffs were retained, 
where wildlife and marine life were protected, and where the attitudes of local 
officials toward environmental issues were changed, Californians would quickly 
see that indeed coastal resources are being protected -- albeit not as well as 
some would like. 
</P>
<P>
The legacy of the Coastal Act is not easy to assess. It is as much measured in 
the development you don't see as in the quality of development you do see. It 
is as much measured in the views and public access you enjoy as in the citizen 
participation that made the views and access possible. It is as much measured 
in changed attitudes about protecting the environment as in seeing how 
public-private partnerships have been forged to protect coastal resources. 
</P>
<P>
As we anticipate the reaction that will come when the hotels, roads and houses 
begin to sprout along the Irvine coast, we should remind ourselves of what 
might have been!

THE LICENSING OF CHILD-CARE HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was deeply disappointed in the irresponsible reporting regarding 
irresponsible people that provide unlicensed child care (April 11): "Child 
Care, It's Seller's Market." In my opinion, there is no excuse for caring for 
children without a license. 
</P>
<P>
I have been a licensed family day-care provider of quality child care for 7 
years. Through my experience as a provider and family day-care consultant, I 
know of only three reasons why a person like Sorenson stays unlicensed: 
</P>
<P>
* A rare case of exemption, i.e. caring for family members. 
</P>
<P>
* The unlicensed provider does not want to conform to the vary basic health and 
safety codes that a license should bring, i.e. acknowledging the child-to-adult 
ratios that exist for the children's safety. 
</P>
<P>
* Complete irresponsibility. 
</P>
<P>
If an unlicensed provider is not going to recognize and comply with these basic 
safety codes, then what can a parent expect from this person in the way of 
providing a rich, responsive environment for their children? Unfortunately, the 
child suffers from inconsistent and below-standard care. 
</P>
<P>
However, Orange County parents can not continue to depend on the Department of 
Social Services to do their work. Parents have the power to demand licensed 
child care for their children. Naturally, it may take time and effort on their 
part to find a space. More than likely they will have to put their child's name 
on a waiting list. But, for the sake of their children, they do not have to 
accept this "so, nobody can stop me" attitude that many of these unlicensed 
providers so proudly proclaim. 
</P>
<P>
Parents should look at their child-care expenditures as an investment. Not just 
as a monetary investment, but as an investment in the future of their children. 
Sometimes an investment will cost a parent . . . an extra $20 a week. But the 
return on that investment will be invaluable. 
</P>
<P>
So why throw money away with a person who does not have the fortitude to get a 
simple operating license. If you are a parent who has their child in unlicensed 
child care, demand that your provider meet the bare minimum requirements and 
get licensed. If they refuse, start looking for licensed care by calling the 
local referral services weekly until you find the situation that meets your 
needs. Sadly, I can think of three families who wished they had. 
</P>
<P>
Take the time and make the effort for children. They deserve it.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POLICE OFFICER'S FIRING UPHELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Torrance Civil Service Commission has upheld the dismissal of Timothy 
Thornton, the police officer fired last year for allegedly lying about the 
accidental shooting of an unarmed man. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton is expected to appeal the decision to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the three-day Civil Service Commission hearing, which ended last 
week, are not available because Thornton's hearing was closed to the public and 
to the press. In the past, disciplinary hearings concerning all city employees 
have been held in public. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton's firing stemmed from the shooting last May 9 of construction worker 
Patrick Coyle by Officer Timothy Pappas. 
</P>
<P>
Pappas accidentally shot Coyle and then lied to superiors to make it appear 
that Coyle provoked the shooting when he moved suddenly on his motorcycle, 
according to court papers filed in a related criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton and Officer Mark Holden, who arrived just before the shooting, joined 
in the lie to protect Pappas, the district attorney has charged. Holden and 
Pappas face a preliminary hearing on criminal conspiracy charges May 11 in Los 
Angeles Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton is expected to receive a grant of immunity in exchange for testifying 
against the other two, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher Darden. 
</P>
<P>
All three officers were fired by the Torrance Police Department after Thornton 
revealed the alleged cover-up.

WESTMINSTER VIETNAMESE AND FORMER CIA CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading "Ex-CIA Chief Defends Role of Vietnamese in Little Saigon" (April 
17), and not exactly being an admirer of William Colby, I resent Colby's 
reference to the attitude toward the Vietnamese mirroring the one toward 
Italian immigrants. There is no comparison between the Vietnamese and the 
Italians. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, an Italian discovered America -- not a Vietnamese -- and the Italian 
has a greater right to be in this country. What have the Vietnamese contributed 
to the United States? 
</P>
<P>
Their presence is a constant reminder of a very dark page in American history 
when our young men died needlessly so some Vietnamese can immigrate here and 
proceed to satisfy his greed for wealth. 
</P>
<P>
The inscription at the foot of the Statue of Liberty reads "Give me your poor, 
your hungry . . . yearning to be free" and not "yearning to get rich." These 
people will never be accepted by the rest of us who worked so hard to make this 
country what it is today.

HOSPICE CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for your editorial supporting the conclusions of the Orange County 
Grand Jury report that recommends the establishment of hospice care in Orange 
County. The need is immediate and will increase substantially over the next 
decade. It now costs $150 per day per patient in a hospice facility, as opposed 
to $1,200 per day in an intensive care hospital unit. 
</P>
<P>
Our Hospice Orange County steering committee is building an organization to 
fund and operate a facility that will provide quality, compassionate care for 
terminally ill patients and give comfort and financial relief to their 
families. We are now evaluating business plan proposals from Coopers &amp; 
Lybrand, Ernst &amp; Whinney and a San Diego-based health care consulting firm. 
United Way has provided an office for us, and we have obtained a California 
Community Foundation Grant. 
</P>
<P>
Our broad-based committee has benefited from the generous participation of 
advisers, such as Corrine Bayley, vice president, St. Joseph Health System; Dr. 
Rex Ehling, county health officer; Penny Weismuller, AIDS coordinator of the 
county Health Care Agency, and many others knowledgeable in this field. 
</P>
<P>
We appreciate the efforts of the grand jury and its human services committee 
for bringing the critical issue of hospice care to the attention of the Board 
of Supervisors.

ASSESSING BLAME IN FREEWAY CRASHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Morning and night as we go to and from work, traffic radio alerts are the 
expected rather than the exception. 
</P>
<P>
On March 18 as we traveled north on the Ventura Freeway, we passed an accident 
scene in the south lanes. Tow trucks were positioning themselves to remove two 
automobiles. We measured the mileage of backed up traffic to be in excess of 5 
miles. The occupants of roughly 5,000 automobiles, with further ripple effect 
on thousands more, were the unwitting victims of that accident. 
</P>
<P>
In November of 1988, on the southbound San Diego Freeway near Westminster, an 
18-wheel rig overturned, blocking all the lanes on the freeway. Traffic backed 
up for 10 to 12 miles. Surface streets and adjacent freeways were clogged. The 
hour was 9 a.m. For hours there was no escape in any direction. What was the 
social and economic impact of that accident? 
</P>
<P>
On April 1, a tragic accident backed up traffic for 18 miles on Interstate 5 
near Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
On that same freeway near Westminster on Easter Sunday evening, the freeway was 
closed to northbound traffic due to a driver shearing off guy lines supporting 
high-tension poles. Live wires dangled on the freeway until the electricity 
could be turned off. Again, traffic was backed up for many miles and for many 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
We propose a law aimed at special handling of participants in freeway accidents 
that cause the terrible delays resulting in wasted man-hours, economic losses 
in businesses and industry and incalculable physical distress. 
</P>
<P>
The law would provide for a special hearing on the causes of every freeway 
accident that, in the opinion of the chief peace officer investigating the 
accident, has caused substantial delay. The judgment in such a hearing would 
run against the offending party. The state would be the beneficiary of such 
judgment -- required to be published as a notice to the world of the 
consequences of careless freeway driving. 
</P>
<P>
The measure of social and economic loss would be produced through expert 
testimony of traffic engineers supported by facts supplied by witnesses to the 
event of which there would be a ready multitude. 
</P>
<P>
Such damages could be monumental, probably not covered by insurance as it is 
currently structured, but would, nevertheless, be a shrieking warning to drive 
more carefully on the freeway.

I was deeply incensed by Councilman Frank Fry's remark about the South 
Vietnamese. The cultural diversity that surrounds me in Orange County is 
something that I cherish. I live next to Little Saigon and I delight in its 
differentness, just as I do in other areas of the county that house other races 
and ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
When I am allowed to participate in a ceremony or event such as the Tet 
Festival, which I enjoyed, I am given the chance to glimpse a part of our large 
world. Fry's desire for a community of homogenized clones would lead to a 
bleak, monotonous life.

WESTMINSTER VIETNAMESE AND FORMER CIA CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding "Ex-CIA Chief Defends Role of Vietnamese in Little Saigon" (April 
17): I could not care less about how William Colby feels about the Vietnamese, 
and if I hear one more time that "the Vietnamese community in Orange County is 
known worldwide as the capital of the Vietnamese overseas," I will just scream! 
</P>
<P>
Why Orange County? With 49 other states to choose from, why settle in Orange 
County, in the Westminster, Garden Grove area? And then proceed to build 
garish, urban blight-type buildings here? How would the Vietnamese like it if 
an invader took over their country? How do they think we feel about them taking 
over our neighborhoods? 
</P>
<P>
For 15 years we have had to put up with more and more people moving into an 
area already heavily impacted. Just what have the Vietnamese immigrants 
contributed to this county and country other than more traffic, kids, crime and 
traffic congestion? I couldn't care less about how hard they work. We work hard 
or even harder than they do. And what do we get? An environment that is choking 
us by the presence of more Vietnamese.

RPV LIMITS HOUSING TRACT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rancho Palos Verdes City Council will limit to 43 houses a subdivision 
being planned by Watt Palos Verdes along Palos Verdes Drive South. 
</P>
<P>
The council also set guidelines for the development, which has gone through 
numerous revisions since it was first proposed two years ago for land 
overlooking the old Marineland site. The guidelines restrict the size of the 
houses, limit removal of fill to 250,000 cubic yards, and require the 64-acre 
subdivision to have privately maintained streets. 
</P>
<P>
The developer had originally asked to build as many as 64 houses. The Planning 
Commission recently cut that number to 58. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Schmidt, a spokesman for Watt Palos Verdes, said the company will 
evaluate the guidelines and see if the project is still economically viable. 
</P>
<P>
The council made its decision at a public hearing Tuesday, which will be 
continued May 2. The city must approve or disapprove a final proposal on that 
day -- two years after the project was first proposed -- or by state law it is 
automatically approved. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's session, the council accepted the project's environmental impact 
report but denied Watt's appeal of Planning Commission conditions for the 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Watt representatives are expected to meet with city staff during the next 10 
days to formulate the final development proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors have opposed the development, fearing landslides, but city geologists 
have found the property stable.

COURAGEOUS SUPPORT FOR DRUG CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Council candidate Lyle Hall showed courage and wisdom by standing up in 
support of the Nancy Reagan Center plans to locate in Lake View Terrace (March 
14). The drug abuse rehabilitation center is sorely needed in the north Valley. 
</P>
<P>
What astonishes me is the ignorance of those who are resisting the project. 
Practicing drug users and pushers are living on our streets (next door?). How 
can anyone oppose a facility that exists to help non-using ex-addicts learn to 
live clean, productive and fulfilling lives? Where have all our values gone? 
Property values most certainly take a plunge when there's a "rock house" in the 
neighborhood. I can't buy the notion that a drug abuse rehabilitation and 
research facility will threaten the life style of Lake View Terrace. Drugs and 
gangs are the threat! 
</P>
<P>
I salute Lyle Hall, whose leadership qualities are rare indeed among today's 
politicians, for giving our kids and adults hope for the future and inspiration 
that life can be honest, good and better than it is today by supporting efforts 
that help our community to become free from drugs and crime.

CSUN GRADUATION IN HOLLYWOOD BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My sympathy goes out to the Cal State Northridge graduates being shuffled about 
in such a cavalier manner. 
</P>
<P>
I believe that the arrogant selection of Hollywood Bowl and the stipulation 
that students be allowed to bring only three guests is a brazen stomping of the 
sensibilities of graduating students who have been supposedly exposed to four 
years of higher learning. Above all else, college is supposed to send young men 
and women out into the world with heightened sensitivity, a sense of fairness, 
a pride in being accepted into a community appreciative of and hopeful for 
their enlightened contribution to society. 
</P>
<P>
What sort of message do they receive from an administration that so treats this 
vitally important achievement in their lives and in the lives of supportive 
parents, grandparents, friends and other family members? Three guests only, 
indeed! Right on, students! Don't let yourself be stomped on!

WEREN'T TRAFFIC PROBLEMS FORESEEN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gabe Fuentes' article, "Some Businesses Face Problems as Nordhoff St. 
Straightens Out" (March 13) made me wonder why both the city in this case and 
the state in the case of the Simi Valley Freeway are so shortsighted when it 
comes to metropolitan transit. 
</P>
<P>
According to Fuentes, the city has had rights to build the Nordhoff road 
connection for 20 years. The problem cited for this lack of action was 
insufficient funding. Now that funding has become available, construction has 
begun, with a project completion date of sometime next summer. The city feels 
that this will relieve traffic in the future, but for now inconvenience reigns 
for area shoppers and residents. Something should have been done long ago, 
before the problem arose! 
</P>
<P>
Now direct your attention to the Simi Valley Freeway. At present, each 
direction has three lanes, with the eastbound side allowing driving on the 
inside shoulder during peak morning hours. It should be obvious to the state, 
especially after underestimating traffic flow on both the San Diego Freeway and 
the Ventura Freeway, that a freeway capable of handling more volume is 
necessary to allow for future growth, without construction. 
</P>
<P>
With Simi Valley's population of more than 100,000, it's obvious that expansion 
is required, causing an inconvenience for thousands of motorists daily. Cost, 
time and motorist inconvenience could be greatly cut if both the state and city 
organizations looked a little bit more into the future.

BARRING TRADES, SIGNS POINT OLIVER TO CHARGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN HEWITT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The perfect draft for the Chargers would have been UCLA quarterback Troy 
Aikman. But they ruined that scenario by winning four of their final six games 
last season. Their 6-10 record earned them the eighth pick in today's first 
round of the 54th annual NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas wound up with the worst record in the league and the rights to Aikman. 
The Cowboys signed him Thursday to a six-year contract for $11.2 million. Green 
Bay will almost certainly use the second pick to choose Michigan State tackle 
Tony Mandarich. 
</P>
<P>
After that, the fun will begin. 
</P>
<P>
"The perfect draft for the Chargers would be Tony Mandarich," said Steve 
Ortmayer, the Chargers director of football operations, between meetings 
Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Translation: Aikman signed. And as of late Saturday, Mandarich hadn't. 
</P>
<P>
But the best the Chargers can realistically hope for now is a deal that would 
move them up to the No. 3 spot in the first round. They would use that 
selection to grab Florida State cornerback Deion Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
And that sound you would hear in the Chargers' draft room would be the corks 
popping off the champagne bottles. Sanders alone is reason enough to christen 
anybody's secondary. 
</P>
<P>
But Detroit, which owns the third pick, apparently has backed itself into a 
public relations corner by selling Oklahoma State running back Barry Sanders to 
its fans, billing him as the next Billy Sims. 
</P>
<P>
And Kansas City, choosing fourth, will surprise everybody if it doesn't go for 
Derrick Thomas, a cruiserweight linebacker from Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta, Tampa Bay and Pittsburgh -- the three teams that follow Kansas City 
and precede the Chargers in the first round -- finished 25th, 12th and 21st in 
NFL pass defense last year. Deion Sanders would be as valuable to any of those 
teams as he would be to the Chargers, who finished 26th in pass defense. 
</P>
<P>
So the likelihood of them collectively passing on Sanders is nil. The 
likelihood of the Chargers trading up with Atlanta, Tampa Bay or Pittsburgh to 
get Deion Sanders is only an outside possibility. 
</P>
<P>
After Aikman and Mandarich, Deion Sanders would have been the perfect draft for 
the Chargers. Detroit really needs Deion Sanders more than anybody. The Lions 
allowed more passing yards last year than any other team. But Deion Sanders 
says he doesn't want to play in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, don't despair for the Chargers. If they sit tight at No. 8, they 
will get a defensive player who will help immediately. And if they trade down, 
they may get a quarterback -- USC's Rodney Peete perhaps -- who is good enough 
to start for them immediately. Or they could get Burt Grossman, a highly 
regarded defensive lineman from Pitt. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe 50-50," Ortmayer said when asked about the chances of trading down in 
the first round. "In order to get us to move down from the eighth pick, it 
would take something (players already in the league) that we could plug into 
our team now or selections that we have projected would be players that we 
could plug into our team. In others words it would take immediate help." 
</P>
<P>
And if they don't trade down? 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, a team that didn't get a sack from a starting linebacker until 
the 10th game of 1988, have hoped all along that Nebraska linebacker Broderick 
Thomas, a fierce pass-rusher, might slip to the eighth spot. They will probably 
take him if he does. If not, that leaves Florida free safety Louis Oliver and 
LSU linebacker Eric Hill as the likely choices at No. 8. 
</P>
<P>
And this is where Dwight Adams, a florid-faced ex-Marine with a barrel chest, 
enters the picture. Adams is the Chargers' scout in the Southeastern 
Conference. He served in Korea. He once coached high school football in 
Smackover, Ark. He has fingers that look like smoked sausages, knuckles that 
resemble pine knots and a voice that's a cross between Wilford Brimley and Slim 
Pickens. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Hill is 6-1, 252 pounds with above average speed and quickness. "He's a 
man," Adams says. "He's a damn man." 
</P>
<P>
Adams on Oliver: "Now then, he is measured and weighed as a verified six feet, 
two and two-eighths inches and 225 pounds. He looks like Tarzan. 
</P>
<P>
"Gentlemen, this guy has got it all, starting right here (tapping his head). 
He's got the gray matter. 
</P>
<P>
"He has intelligence, he's got instincts, he's got change of direction, he has 
toughness and he has his degree. He's an unusual cat. He's a good, solid, high 
character, goal-oriented person. Plus he's got every athletic attribute. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy would come in here, and you wouldn't believe it. I'm talking about 
arms and a chest on him -- a high-cut guy with good definition up and down -- a 
clean-faced, clean-shaven guy. He'd come in, and you'd love him." 
</P>
<P>
Adams isn't the only critic in Oliver's corner. Baltimore draft expert Mel 
Kiper Jr. rates Oliver the sixth-best player available. Oliver went to Florida 
on an academic scholarship. Brown University of the Ivy League recruited him 
out of high school. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver is unpretentious (his answering machine greets callers with an airy "Yo, 
this is Lou."). And his agent says he has gained 10 pounds since the combine 
workouts in January. Which means the Chargers could plug him in at free safety, 
strong safety or outside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
"Speed on the defensive perimeter," was Charger Coach Dan Henning's answer at 
the recent NFL owners' meetings when asked to identify his team's primary need. 
Louis Oliver has run a 4.37-second 40-yard dash. Oliver is speed on the 
perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
And for the Chargers, Louis Oliver is the realistic perfect draft. 
</P>
<P>
They can improve upon that perfection if they can pinpoint which team wants 
Peete badly enough to take him on the first round. Here's how that works: 
</P>
<P>
Let's say, for example, the Chargers determine that Phoenix will take Peete 
with the 17th pick of the first round. As soon as they select Oliver, the 
Chargers get on the phone with New England, the team that picks 16th. They 
start making offers to the Patriots. Maybe a second-rounder and a player. Maybe 
a second- and third-rounder and a player. But if they give up their 1990 No. 1 
to New England for the Peete pick, that is too much. 
</P>
<P>
Let's say they lose their second (37th overall) and third (64th overall) and a 
player to the Patriots for Peete. That would leave them with one pick in each 
of the remaining rounds except the sixth (which they lost in the 1987 Barry 
Redden trade) and the seventh (where they have three choices from trades that 
sent Thomas Benson to New England and Wes Chandler to San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
Another player the Chargers might trade down for is Clemson cornerback Donnell 
Woolford. But they had better do it before Chicago Bears, who own the 11th and 
12th picks, get a shot at him. 
</P>
<P>
If the Chargers keep their second-round pick, they will jump for joy if North 
Carolina Central cornerback Robert Massey is still available. Massey looked 
good in postseason all-star play. But he is raw. So is his agent, a 22-year-old 
college student named Drew Rosenhaus who wears an earring in his left ear. 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer has said he wants five or six players from this draft to make the 
Chargers' regular season roster. That will be difficult. There are probably 
only 100 players in the draft good enough to play regularly next year. 
</P>
<P>
The perfect draft, like the perfect wave, is an elusive goal. But if you're a 
surfer, you know almost immediately when you've discovered the perfect wave. If 
you're a general manager or a head coach, you don't really know how you did in 
the draft until the next season, at the earliest. So many late-round selections 
arrive as development projects that it sometimes takes years to fully assess a 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Steve Ortmayer, the Chargers' director of football operations, said Saturday 
that talks between Atlanta, Washington and the Chargers are continuing. 
Ortmayer wouldn't discusss specifics. But published reports on the proposed 
deal have Falcon running back Gerald Riggs going to the Chargers in exchange 
for their first-round pick. The Chargers would then ship Riggs to Washington 
for one of two backup quarterbacks -- Stan Humphries or Mark Rypien -- and a 
reserve offensive lineman and a second-round pick in this draft.

WHAT IS IN A NAME? JUST ASK BILLY RIPKEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LITTWIN, The Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Billy Ripken is introduced, and mixed among the cheers are a smattering of 
boos, the only boos any Baltimore Oriole will hear that night. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, in a recent magazine poll asking readers to name their favorite 
Oriole, Ripken finished second to big brother Cal. 
</P>
<P>
"People seem to either love me or hate me," Billy Ripken says. "There's no 
middle ground with me." 
</P>
<P>
Not unlike many of his teammates, the younger Ripken is a struggling player 
with some potential who's trying to shape a major-league career that may or may 
not be there. 
</P>
<P>
In two years in the big leagues, he has had some good moments and bad, but 
none, except a certain episode with an obscene word on a baseball card, to 
engender either particular hostility or affection. Still, both are evident. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Because of a few famous relatives. Because he's a Ripken in an 
organization where the name has magic. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always figured that was the reason," Ripken says. "The thing I hear a lot 
is, 'You'll never be as good as your brother.' No joke. That's not debatable. 
That's like the worst line ever. It just makes me laugh. I know I'm not as good 
as my brother. Everyone on this planet knows it. But they still say it." 
</P>
<P>
Billy is not exercised over the question. He got past that long ago, which is a 
good thing, because the problem is not going away. You have only to listen to 
sports radio call-in shows -- bad advice, by the way, for any ballplayer who 
values his sanity -- to understand there is in Baltimore a Billy Ripken factor. 
</P>
<P>
"Even before he got here, everyone was asking, 'Is he going to be as good as 
Cal?' " says his manager, Frank Robinson. "Cal sent a standard here, and people 
were excited about having another Ripken on the club. When Billy came up, he 
did nothing to change that. In fact, he enhanced it. 
</P>
<P>
"But when he went into a slump last year, a lot of people said he was playing 
because of favoritism. Well, his father only managed six games, and I know that 
wasn't true on my part. The half-year he had in '87 earned him a chance to be 
out there in '88." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the concept of Billy getting a break because he's a Ripken began in 
1987, when he was hitting over .300, playing for his father. It continued last 
year, even though his father was fired, and it hasn't stopped. 
</P>
<P>
"It won't stop," Robinson says, "as long as he's in Baltimore. He better get 
used to it." 
</P>
<P>
Brother Cal understands the problem, having lived through something like it 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"When I signed, it was normal to hear, 'You're only here because of your name,' 
" Cal Ripken says. "I even heard it from other players' wives. I'd be leading 
the team in hits, runs, everything else and still hear the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Billy's had a tougher road than I did. He had my dad and he had me in front of 
him. That put a little extra pressure on him. But you don't get to the big 
leagues unless you have ability. You can't get there on your name. It hasn't 
ever happened. It won't happen." 
</P>
<P>
Having considered this phenomenon before, Cal has developed a theory to explain 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people parallel a Little League scenario to a big league scenario," he 
says. "Everyone played on a little league team where the dad is the coach, and 
he bats his kid fourth even though he can't hit. And maybe his kid plays the 
most. I guess you can get by in the Little League like that, but it just can't 
happen in the big leagues." 
</P>
<P>
Billy's status in the big leagues is problematic. As a second baseman, he has 
few peers defensively. He plays the game with what you might call enthusiasm, 
if running through walls is enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
And maybe he struts a bit, but he plays hard, too. But after hitting .308 in 
1987, he slipped to .207 last year, the lowest average for anyone having played 
150 or more games since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Answer this: If Ripken doesn't play second, who does? When Billy broke his 
finger in spring training, the job went to Rene Gonzales, another good-field, 
not-much-hit player, who's hitting .194. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Stanicek was expected to get a shot at second, but he has spent his entire 
spring in the whirlpool nursing one in a series of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"Billy doesn't have a stranglehold on the job," Robinson says. "Everyone is 
going to play this year. Gonzo has done a good job, but he isn't exactly 
ripping it up. What do I say to Billy, 'You have to sit when the other guy is 
doing the things you can do'? 
</P>
<P>
"Billy has the potential to have a good career. If he hits behind the runner, 
bunts a runner over, gets a few hits, he can be an effective player. You know 
how well he plays second. When Billy is in the field, you don't have to hold 
your breath and wonder if he's going to make the play. You know he'll make it. 
He's going to play. Gonzo is going to play second and some third. It will all 
work out in the end." 
</P>
<P>
Billy says he's trying to do what the manager wants him to do and hopes that 
last season is just a bad memory. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, in '88, all the fans forgot about 1987," Billy says. "Well, I can 
forget about '88 as fast as they forgot about '87." 
</P>
<P>
But whatever happens this season, the one thing nobody will forget is his last 
name.

1983 STANDS OUT AS THE BEST DRAFT OF THE '80S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By BARRY WILNER, Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If only it was 1983 again. 
</P>
<P>
That's how just about every NFL general manager and director of personnel feels 
about the draft in the last decade. If every crop of available college players 
was as talented and deep as it was in 1983, they might not have to spend every 
waking minute breaking down film, making personal scouting trips or checking 
out tips. 
</P>
<P>
"The '83 was a very deep draft," says Dick Steinberg, player development 
director for the Patriots. "Not only the quarterbacks (six went on the first 
round). Curt Warner and Eric Dickerson were in that draft, too." 
</P>
<P>
Adds Jim Finks, now general manager of the Saints but, six years ago, the 
Chicago Bears' team president: 
</P>
<P>
"One year that jumps out at me is 1983. As an idea of the quality of player, 
Buffalo got Jim Kelly; Chicago, we got Jimbo Covert and Willie Gault. 
Cincinnati got Dave Rimington. Denver got Chris Hinton and Baltimore took John 
Elway and they made the trade of two quality players. 
</P>
<P>
"Detroit got James Jones, who is still very productive. Houston got Bruce 
Matthews, a guard from Southern Cal. The Rams got Eric Dickerson, and Miami got 
Dan Marino. New England got Tony Eason, and the Jets got Ken O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, that draft stands out. A couple of those guys look to me as if they 
have a good opportunity to wind up in Canton, Ohio." 
</P>
<P>
If there was a Hall of Fame for drafts, 1983 certainly would be in it. Elway, 
Marino, Eason, O'Brien, Kelly and Todd Blackledge -- how did he get in there? 
-- were selected on a first round. Elway was the top pick, followed by Warner, 
Dickerson and Hinton. Darrell Green, Billy Ray Smith and Joey Browner also were 
first-rounders. 
</P>
<P>
But you don't measure the strength of a draft solely by the top 28 picks. Down 
in the eighth round, the Bears found Richard Dent. Cincinnati came up with Tim 
Krumrie in 10th and Denver discovered Karl Mecklenburg on the 12th and final 
round. All three have been All-Pros. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone prospered in '83. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh's first choice was Gabe Rivera, a massive defensive tackle from 
Texas A&amp;M who was paralyzed in an auto accident and never played for the 
Steelers. Pittsburgh got virtually nothing from that draft. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City, needing a passer, went for Blackledge of national champion Penn 
State when Marino, Kelly, Eason and O'Brien were around. Blackledge was a bust. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, however, no group in this decade compares with '83. 
</P>
<P>
"We can only dream of coming up with another group like that one," says Mike 
Hickey, who handles the draft for the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
Hickey and the Jets were thrilled by last year's grab bag, even though it was 
considered to lack substance beyond the first 50 players. If any team proved 
that wrong, it was the Jets, who got safety Erik McMillan, the defensive rookie 
of the year, and James Hasty, who could be just as good on the corner, in the 
third round. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of times, too much focus is put on the No. 1s," Jets coach Joe Walton 
says. "The most important picks are the mid-rounds, when you can get some darn 
good football players, like we did last year. 
</P>
<P>
"If we come out of this one with what we got last year, we'll be smiling." 
</P>
<P>
A lot of folks were smiling coming out of the 1984 draft. In the second round, 
Cincinnati grabbed Boomer Esiason and Atlanta got Scott Case. Both went to this 
year's Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
So have Fredd Young, whom Seattle drafted on the third round; Michael Carter, 
taken on the fifth by San Francisco; and Earnest Byner, a bargain basement pick 
for Cleveland on Round 10. 
</P>
<P>
"Since 1984, none of them have been that strong," Steinberg says. "I know that 
there's been a smaller college-age population, which has affected a lot of 
industries, not only football. There's also been a lot of injuries, not only in 
the pros but in college. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of football types are playing basketball, defensive ends and tight ends, 
because of the exposure basketball gets. 
</P>
<P>
"Proposition 48 is a factor. ... Instead of practicing and working and 
developing for five years and playing for four, they're only developing for 
three years. That's two years lost. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that drugs and steroids are taking their toll, too." 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the 80s, drugs and steroids weren't nearly as big an issue 
in football. But they have changed the complexion of the draft, Hickey says. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't afford to take a steroid-type," Hickey says. "If he is (using) and 
gets caught, you've blown it. He could be lost to the team for some time and, 
when he gets off it, he's a different guy." 
</P>
<P>
While the GMs and personnel people might yearn for the simpler days of earlier 
decades, they also keep in mind that it matters little how good an entire crop 
is as long as they pick the best of it. 
</P>
<P>
"What turned out good for the New Orleans Saints," Finks says of 1986, 
"particularly in the second and third rounds (Dalton Hilliard, Rueben Mayes and 
Pat Swilling), did not necessarily fall well for the other clubs. The one thing 
I have learned in the few campaigns I have been around is that none of them are 
a sure thing." 
</P>
<P>
Not even the Class of '83. 
</P>
<P>
But it was close.

MAGIC STILL REIGNS AS BEST PLAYER IN NBA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID ALDRIDGE, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's the time of year to chime in with one more uneducated opinion on the NBA's 
Best and Worst for Fiscal Season 1988-89. The envelopes, please. 
</P>
<P>
Most Valuable Player: Magic Johnson, Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
No one is better at the end of a game. No one has gotten so much out of one 
team, especially one that's had such a long run of success. No one is a better 
motivator of men. No one keeps his teammates happier. No one is as complete a 
basketball player. Plus, you have to love a guy who handles the ball as much as 
Magic does and shoots 91 percent from the foul line. 
</P>
<P>
Another Good Choice: Karl Malone, Utah. The Jordan contingent is going crazy. 
But Malone is as close to unstoppable as there is in an NBA front court. 
</P>
<P>
And unstoppable front-court players, generally, go a lot longer in the playoffs 
than unstoppable back-court players. True, John Stockton makes Malone a 
finisher an awful lot of times rather than a creator. But Malone is also a 
ferocious rebounder. 
</P>
<P>
And you could make an argument for: Michael Jordan, Chicago; Charles Barkley, 
Philadelphia; Pat Ewing, New York. 
</P>
<P>
Coach of the Year: Don Nelson, Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson heads a very distinguished list of finalists for what he's been able to 
do with a team that, except for Manute Bol, is Washington Bullets West. True, 
the Warriors have gotten huge seasons from Chris Mullin and Mitch Richmond, but 
it is Nelson who installed the pop-a-shot offense (116.6 points per game) in 
which the duo has thrived. All this while Ralph Sampson, to quote a current 
president, has been out of the loop. All this despite frequently starting a 
lineup in which no one is taller than 6 feet 8. 
</P>
<P>
Another Good Choice: Cotton Fitzsimmons, Phoenix. True, he had good talent to 
work with, but he's brought it all together in one season to where the Suns are 
all-timers for turnaround seasons and can't be beat by the Western Conference 
at home. And do you notice how no one's calling Tom Chambers a malcontent 
anymore? 
</P>
<P>
Rookie of the Year: Mitch Richmond, Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
This one was easy. Richmond has been a fearless player. He leads rookies in 
scoring (22.3 ppg) and is the only first-year player in the top 20 overall, 
helping lead the Golden State renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
Pencil him in for a few future all-star appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Best Sixth Man: Dennis Rodman, Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
He's annoying. He's occasionally dirty. He takes those ridiculous-looking 
charges where he slides nine feet. But he gives you three elements off the 
bench: clinging defense, tenacious rebounding, and accurate, if infrequent, 
shooting. That's Rodman who leads the league in field-goal percentage. 
</P>
<P>
Another Good Choice: John Williams, Washington. He doesn't have the numbers you 
might expect from a sixth man, but look at them across the board: 13.5 points, 
seven rebounds, 4.3 assists, 137 steals. You can at least speculate that one 
(or more) of those categories would be higher if Williams were put in one 
position. But he plays in the post on defense and brings up the ball on 
offense. He plays shooting guard. He plays power forward. No one player does 
more for his team in a reserve role. 
</P>
<P>
Best Defensive Player: Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Rodman tops is his ability for individual defense, which is what 
wins games in the playoffs. Playoff offense (and defense) comes down to 
individual matchups much more so than the regular season. He can shut down the 
hot man, be he guard or forward. And, unlike others, he not only can make a man 
miss, he can go get the rebound as well. 
</P>
<P>
Another Good Choice: Mark Eaton, Utah. He wrecks entire offensive schemes with 
his 7-4 bulk and shot-blocking skills (3.9 per game). He is the major reason 
the Jazz is holding opponents to 43 percent shooting, the lowest percentage in 
more than a decade, and why it has held opponents under 100 points an amazing 
42 times this season. And you could make an argument for Ewing; Bol; Jordan; 
Akeem Olajuwon, Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Most Improved Player: Mullin. 
</P>
<P>
What Mullin has done with his personal life is admirable and inspiring. That 
shouldn't be confused with the fact that he's made himself a much better 
basketball player as well. Part of that has to do with Nelson's moving him from 
guard to forward, where he doesn't have to cover some of the quicksilver two 
men in the league. But Mullin has raised his scoring average, become a 
game-breaking shooter and is second on the team in rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
Another Good Choice: Larry Krystkowiak, Milwaukee. Here's a guy who wasn't 
known for doing much of anything, but who is the Bucks' choice for defensive 
stopper. His play has allowed Terry Cummings more rom inside, he's solidified 
the Milwaukee front court and he's averaged 12.5 points on 47 percent shooting. 
And you could make an argument for Reggie Lewis, Boston; Darrell Griffith, 
Utah; Ron Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
All-NBA First Team: Johnson, Jordan, Karl Malone, Barkley, Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
What's the difference between Mullin and Barkley? Not much, but Barkley's got 
series-winning capability. Essentially a coin flip. Ewing allows the Knicks to 
press with impunity, plus he scores. And he's the ultimate competitor. 
</P>
<P>
Second team: Stockton; Dale Ellis, Seattle; Mullin; Chambers; Olajuwon. 
</P>
<P>
Third team: Kevin Johnson, Phoenix; Isiah Thomas, Detroit; Bernard King, 
Washington; Dominique Wilkins, Atlanta; Robert Parish, Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
All-Unappreciated: Terry Porter, Portland; Jeff Malone, Washington; A.C. Green, 
Lakers; Otis Thorpe, Houston; Mike Gminski, Philadelphia.

EUROPEAN GOVERNMENT SEEKING TO GIVE SOCCER PLAYERS MORE FREEDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
BRUSSELS, Belgium 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the European public complains about the salaries of high-paid soccer 
stars, politicians are trying to help the players at the bottom of the pay 
scale by creating an open market. 
</P>
<P>
Parliamentarians of the 12-nation European Economic Community recently called 
soccer's trading system, where clubs "own" players and get huge sums for their 
transfers, "a latter-day version of the slave trade." 
</P>
<P>
The EEC wants to create an open market where players from within the community 
are free to play anywhere in the community without transfer fees. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't look at a handful of soccer millionaires but at all the players who 
hover around the minimum income," said Dutch Europarliamentarian James Janssen 
Van Raay, who helped push the soccer transfer report through the EEC parliament 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
"They have the problems," he said. "If these 80% play no more soccer, then 
there are no more leagues." 
</P>
<P>
Without these players, who rarely make the headlines, "it is all finished," Van 
Raay said. 
</P>
<P>
The parliament said soccer players are held hostage by clubs who can decide 
their future even after contracts expire. The clubs can refuse a transfer to 
another team, where a player might find better wages or working conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"What is incredible is that we see that some clubs maintain they are the owners 
of players," said Belgian parliamentarian Roger Blanpain. "Now, property of 
players is a form of slavery that should have been abolished long ago," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling body of European soccer, UEFA, wants to keep Europe's most popular 
sport as it is currently played, limiting foreigners in national leagues and 
giving clubs extensive powers to decide the career of their players beyond the 
duration of contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to protect our capital. And that, after all, is the players," said 
Michel Verschueren, manager of Anderlecht, one of Belgium's and Europe's top 
teams, in a recent article to argue for extensive club interference. 
</P>
<P>
"Once a contract has expired, then there is no reason whatsover why a club 
should should still have rights to a player," Blanpain countered. 
</P>
<P>
A change in the transfer rules would affect the game from the lowest level of 
professional play to the reaches of Dutchmen Ruud Gullit and Marco Van Basten, 
who were voted the best players at last year's European Championships. 
</P>
<P>
UEFA contends it would upset the way business is done and wreak havoc in the 
clubs' balance sheets. It says teams would no longer want to invest time and 
money in youngsters since they would no longer control their future. 
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament would like to abolish the current transfer system, with 
financial guarantees for clubs training young players. 
</P>
<P>
Since the parliament has few powers, it asked the EEC's executive Commission 
April 11 to take action against the current transfer system. The Commission 
prefers a cautious approach and only a gradual change. 
</P>
<P>
UEFA says the EEC rules do not apply to the Bern-based organization, which has 
34 members throughout Europe, since Switzerland is not part of the trade bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Until the EEC and Uefa discuss the situation, van Raay said, players continue 
to suffer and are subject to the whims of autocratic club presidents. 
</P>
<P>
For many of the top stars, however, life is very different. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the foreign stars playing in Milan and northern Italy live a life of 
luxury in villas overlooking the lakes of Como and Varese. Gullit can make up 
to $900,000 a year and Van Basten slightly less, depending on their performance 
bonuses. Leading stars in Spain and West Germany are almost as opulent. 
</P>
<P>
"The world only writes about the prima donnas, not about the choir singers," 
Van Raay said.

NBA NOTES; 
</P>
<P>
FOR ONCE, LAKERS HAVE FIGHT ON THEIR HANDS IN DIVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM LAYDEN, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let's get one thing straight right away. The Forum in Los Angeles is Wayne 
Gretzky's new home, but he's still renting the joint -- the Lakers own it. 
</P>
<P>
They need it, too. Desperately. Not since 1981, when they last failed to win 
the Pacific Division, have the Lakers had to play so deep into the regular 
season to keep their home-court advantage at least through the NBA playoff 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't catch Detroit, we know that," Lakers Coach Pat Riley said last week. 
"But we really want to have the best record in the Western Conference." 
</P>
<P>
With four days left in the regular season, the Lakers have come 
eyeball-to-eyeball with three realities: 1. Phoenix is capable of reaching the 
finals; 2. Utah hasn't gotten any weaker since taking the Lakers to seven games 
last spring; 3. Everybody grows old, and consecutive championships seem to make 
an 82-game season last about five years. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers are on the cusp of passing from now into then, but they still are 
capable of mounting one more run. Their chances of success, however, would be 
vastly diminished if they had to play two series without the home court. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring the Lakers won three seven-game series: against Utah, Dallas and 
Detroit. In each case, the deciding game was played at the Forum. The Lakers 
were 3-7 on the road in the playoffs. They are 33-6 at home this season. They 
beat Phoenix three times in Los Angeles, but lost three in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
But that's just arithmetic. Teams around the NBA understand the Lakers possess 
something more, and that something is multiplied at home. 
</P>
<P>
"Their credibility is unbelievable," said Jazz President Frank Layden, who was 
the Jazz's coach last spring. "A lot of teams in the league hold the Lakers in 
awe. And when you go into the Forum, that goes along with referees, too. You're 
always playing them (at the Forum) with the idea that if you're 10 points 
ahead, they're going to come up with a 10-point play." 
</P>
<P>
That mystique becomes more valuable when the Lakers have been playing poorly. 
You can draw any conclusion from their 142-118 blowout of the Nuggets Tuesday 
night at the Forum, a performance that prompted Magic Johnson to do a Pat 
Riley: predict a title. "This team is going to come through," he said. Denver, 
however, is fading fast -- it has five straight losses -- and that game is not 
a fair barometer. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers chugged into April, winning just 6 of 11 games before beating up on 
the Nuggets. They lost to the Clippers and Warriors on the road, and to the 
Jazz at home in a 99-97 bare-knuckle fight. 
</P>
<P>
"From watching us play, it looks like we've been struggling and that's hard to 
understand," Lakers General Manager Jerry West said. "Last year at this time we 
were getting better, and right now we're standing still. That's hard to 
understand." 
</P>
<P>
The Suns' win over Miami Wednesday night moved them within half a game of the 
Lakers, but because tie-breakers favor the Lakers, the Suns must win their last 
two games and the Lakers must lose two of their last three (Thursday at home 
against Sacramento, Friday night in Portland, Sunday at home against Seattle) 
for Phoenix to win the division. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers would become the last team to clinch, when they customarily are the 
first. It is a tribute to the Suns, who have been better than anyone imagined. 
"We've never figured we were in the race," Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons said. 
</P>
<P>
"What matters," Suns General Manager Jerry Colangelo said, "is that we're hot 
going into the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
The hit of the Orlando Classic, that annual meat market for college seniors and 
draft-eligibles, was Randy White, a 6-8, 240-pound power forward from Louisiana 
Tech. "He's pushing the first five picks right now," Colangelo said. 
</P>
<P>
Stu Inman, player personnel director for the Heat, said, "Absolutely will go in 
the first 10 picks." 
</P>
<P>
Others who improved their standing were point guard Pooh Richardson of UCLA, 
guard Tim Hardaway of UTEP and center Gary Leonard of Missouri. All likely will 
be first-round picks. Leonard, a 7-foot center, might go as high as the first 
eight picks. Two who slipped: Dyron Nix of Tennessee and Todd Lichti of 
Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the elite players skip postseason tournaments; one who took a gamble on 
upping his value was Stacey King of Oklahoma, and it may have cost him. 
</P>
<P>
"He was horrendous for two days," said one NBA team official. In the last game, 
however, King scored 40 points and had 13 rebounds, a performance that might 
preserve his spot in the top five of the draft. Nobody displaced the likely top 
two: Duke's Danny Ferry and Arizona's Sean Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing to do Friday night? Try going to Charlotte for the Hornets' last 
regular-season home game. In celebration of winning the NBA attendance title -- 
a first by an expansion team -- the Hornets will have a massive tailgate party, 
give T-shirts and gym shorts to all fans and players' game jerseys to 12 fans. 
One fan will win a car, and there will be a post-game concert. "We might try to 
fit in a game somewhere, if we have time," General Manager Carl Scheer said. 
</P>
<P>
More practically, Scheer marveled at the accomplishment in a region many 
thought too saturated with college basketball to support an NBA team. "I'd like 
to say I knew it was going to happen," Scheer said. "But it surprised even me." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore: 
</P>
<P>
 -- After shooting 3 for 19 on three-pointers against the Bulls Monday night, 
the Knicks are 14 for 55 in their last four games and 45 for 150 in their last 
10; they're shooting 34.7 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Robert Reid of Charlotte scored his 10,000th career point Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Magic Johnson's triple-double against Denver (32 points, 17 rebounds, 17 
assists) was his 17th of the season, a league high. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Milwaukee's Jack Sikma had played 283 consecutive games before sitting out 
with an ankle injury Tuesday night against Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hot teams going into the playoffs: Phoenix (nine consecutive wins) and 
Atlanta (eight straight). Cold teams: Denver (five consecutive losses), 
Milwaukee (5-9 in its last 14 games) and Golden State (four consecutive 
losses). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reggie Williams, the former Georgetown star who was drafted in the first 
round in 1987, was suspended by the Clippers for the rest of the season for 
refusing to go into Monday night's game against Utah. "They just won't let me 
play my game," Williams said. "They haven't since they drafted me." 
</P>
<P>
Expect to see him playing it somewhere else next season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Seattle, which needs one win to finish fourth in the Western Conference, 
has won 6 of 7 since Xavier McDaniel became a starter; X-man is averaging 29.3 
points a game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Golden State's Mitch Richmond has cooled off along with his teammates, 
making only eight of his last 34 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Seattle's Dale Ellis has made 17 of his last 28 three-point attempts. ... 
Cleveland is 15-12 since the end of February. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Phoenix led Sacramento by 60 in the fourth quarter Monday night before 
winning by 55. 
</P>
<P>
Exclamation point: Charles Barkley, who scored 34 points in 33 minutes against 
Milwaukee Tuesday night after it was suggested that the Bucks' Larry 
Krystkowiak could stop him: "That's very humorous. I don't think anybody on 
this planet can stop me."

MARYLAND IS LETTING WADE TWIST IN THE WIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN STEADMAN, The Baltimore Evening Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's not heaven, hell or purgatory. The status is limbo, which is where 
Maryland basketball coach Bob Wade is right now. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't make for a pretty picture. He's left swinging in the breeze. When is 
all the torment going to end? The unfortunate thing is it didn't have to be 
handled this way. After all, the discussion is about a basketball coach at the 
University of Maryland and not a common criminal. 
</P>
<P>
Are Wade's days numbered? If so, Athletic Director Lew Perkins doesn't want to 
be the one to fire him because then the university would be obligated to pay 
the two remaining years on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
Wade may not have been thrown to the wolves, but certainly there's no evidence 
of anyone in an official capacity running to his rescue to drive the hungry 
pack away. 
</P>
<P>
There has yet to be even a mild vote of confidence from those in command. 
Perkins hasn't come to Wade's defense. The current investigation by the 
National Collegiate Athletic Association, if any wrongdoing is found, will give 
the university just reason to terminate his services and tell Wade to clean out 
his desk. 
</P>
<P>
If it happens that way, Maryland gets off the hook for any unfulfilled salary 
obligation because Wade will have violated the basic rules of his employment. 
So the NCAA, a responsible organization that does a commendable job under 
difficult circumstances, would ostensibly be doing the dirty work for Perkins. 
</P>
<P>
Perkins could step aside and say he had nothing to do with firing Wade and be 
literally correct, but the record also would show he never came to his aid. He 
just let him dangle. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the new university president, Dr. William Kirwan, hasn't done 
anything to clarify the matter. This is terribly disappointing. Kirwan ought to 
be exerting more leadership, unless he's trying to act the part of a wimp. What 
he is doing, inadvertently, is helping Perkins turn Wade into a martyr. 
</P>
<P>
The day he got the job, Kirwan should have moved to the fore, and as one of his 
first official acts of business, he should have told Wade and Perkins he wanted 
to see them. It was urgent, a top priority. He could have informed them in 
graphic terms that what's happening isn't in the best interests of the school. 
</P>
<P>
He could have said that Perkins and Wade should immediately resolve any 
personal problems, if indeed any existed between them, and either admit, or 
deny, publicly that rules had been broken in regard to recruiting. But Kirwan 
has been mute. Is this the way for the chief executive officer of a state's 
most important educational institution to operate? He ought to be out front 
clearing the issues. 
</P>
<P>
There are worse things than firing the basketball coach, even if his name is 
Bob Wade. Kirwan was in lock step formation with chancellor John Slaughter when 
Wade was hired from Dunbar High School in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of Maryland's faculty, the black membership, came out with a 
statement in support of Wade. That was most unusual. It sounded as if it were 
becoming a black-white issue. Kirwan is the one who should have asserted 
himself, but he elected not to get involved. 
</P>
<P>
Around the country, sportswriters are telling each other they hear Wade is 
going to get the gate. It wouldn't be surprising if the coach has heard similar 
conjecture himself. Maryland said two months ago it was initiating its own 
investigation of reports that assistant coaches, serving under Wade, had 
transported former player Rudy Archer to classes at a junior college. Because 
Archer, sitting out the year for failing to meet academic requirements, still 
has eligibility remaining, he is considered a recruitable athlete by NCAA 
rules. Therefore, providing free transportation for him violates NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
That was on Feb. 20. By now, you would expect Wade to be either indicted or 
acquitted. But no verdict has been handed down. Then on March 13, another 
announcement was made that an NCAA investigating team was looking into any 
possible improprieties. More cloak and dagger. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Hood, who transferred from Maryland to James Madison University, was 
quoted as saying he had been interviewed by NCAA investigators and said he 
believed, from his own assessment of how certain questions were asked, that the 
NCAA may have found more than expected. That leaves open the question of 
whether the investigation is broadening.

GOING FROM MR. RIGHT TO MR. WRONG

<P>
They come out of college football with impeccable credentials, proudly labeled 
"can't miss" players. They are All-This and All-That, equipped with all the 
tools they need to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
They are probed and picked at by the scouts, twisted and turned every which 
way, like so many laboratory specimens. Then the glowing reports are delivered 
to the clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Great hands. Great speed. Great prospect. But that's all they are -- prospects. 
And sometimes, great expectations turn into sour reality. It happened more than 
once in the '80s and it will happen again today when the NFL conducts its 
annual draft. The trick for each of the 28 clubs is to make sure it doesn't 
happen to them. 
</P>
<P>
The spectre of washout picks hangs over the clubs like a bad dream. You feel 
sorry for the other guy when a pick goes south, but at the same time, you're 
grateful that it didn't happen to you. 
</P>
<P>
Personnel people still talk about the great quarterback draft of 1983, when the 
clubs found a bumper crop of signal callers waiting for them. The first one to 
go, the No. 1 pick in that draft, was John Elway of Stanford. No miss there. 
</P>
<P>
Five non-quarterback picks later, it was Kansas City's turn. The Chiefs used 
the seventh choice in the draft to select passer Todd Blackledge of Penn State. 
To say that selection didn't quite work out would be, well, putting it mildly. 
</P>
<P>
By picking Blackledge, KC left behind Jim Kelly, scooped up by Buffalo, Ken 
O'Brien, taken by the New York Jets, Tony Eason, chosen by New England and -- 
perhaps most significantly -- Dan Marino, who went to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Elway, Eason and Marino have taken their teams to the Super Bowl. Kelly had the 
Bills in the AFC championship game last season. O'Brien remains the Jets' 
starter. After five disappointing years in Kansas City, Blackledge was 
dispatched to Pittsburgh, where he remains a backup to Bubby Brister, a 
less-heralded 1986 third round choice of the Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
There are other examples. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, New Orleans turned to the wrong Carolina for the draft's No. 1 pick. 
With North Carolina linebacker Lawrence Taylor on the board, the Saints went 
instead to South Carolina for running back George Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers won a rushing title but played just four years with New Orleans before 
being traded to Washington and then drifting out of football. Taylor, drafted 
by the New York Giants, became the anchor of their defense and the NFL's MVP in 
1986. He remains one of the league's impact players. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the Cardinals, then in St. Louis, were shopping for speed and used 
their No. 1 pick, the 17th selection overall, to pick wide receiver Clyde 
Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
Duncan had speed, all right, but bad hands to go with it. He was cut -- not 
only by the Cardinals, but even by one of the 1987 strike replacement teams, 
difficult to do since those clubs were accepting just about anyone who knew how 
to put on pads and a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
How does that happen? How does a high pick that seems so right turn out to be 
so wrong? Gil Brandt, vice president for player personnel of the Dallas Cowboys 
who has been in the business of evaluating football players for more than 30 
years, chuckled at the question. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, teams draft to fill a position," he said. "They'll say, 'If we 
don't draft him in the first round, he won't be there in the second.' Some 
positions are hard to find." 
</P>
<P>
So, when Denver was determined to get a nose tackle last year, it went sight 
unseen for Ted Gregory of Syracuse -- ignoring his slow recovery from knee 
problems and his lack of size. He reported late to training camp and left 
early, traded by the disappointed Broncos to New Orleans for Shawn Knight, 
another failed No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the Broncos decided to take no chances and, like most other teams, 
got up close and personal examinations and evaluations of their draft 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you reach for something that's not there," Brandt said. "You pass on 
a better player to fill a need and you can get burned. We've done the same 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Which may explain why the Cowboys have the No. 1 pick today. 
</P>
<P>
The draft is now a high tech operation that Brandt compares with the difference 
between "flying DC3s and Convairs with 747s."

HIT AND MISS;

<P>
SOMETIMES, THE BIG NAMES WERE THE LAST NAMES TAKEN IN THE DRAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The year was 1977. The NFL draft was winding to a close. At the central command 
post of the then-Oakland Raiders, a lot of head scratching was going on. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders had one last pick, the 317th of the draft. But who? Close your eyes 
and stick a pin in a list of names? Go for the meanest looking guy? Grab a 
phone book? 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Madden had a better idea. 
</P>
<P>
He called his boyhood friend, USC Coach John Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"Is there anybody we should be talking to?" Madden asked. "You guys have to 
have second stringers who are better than some of the guys left." 
</P>
<P>
Responded Robinson, "Has Rod Martin been taken? I'm sure he can play in the 
NFL." 
</P>
<P>
He could, he did and he still is playing. Martin has played linebacker for the 
Raiders for 13 years, twice making the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Madden had tripped over another diamond in the rough. So much for the science 
of drafting, for the scouts and the performance charts and the stopwatches and 
the physicals. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes you get lucky. It happens. Not that often. Not nearly as much as it 
used to, but it happens. Some of the biggest names in pro football history were 
some of the last names taken in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Berry, perhaps the premier receiver of his day for the Baltimore Colts, 
lasted until the 20th round in 1954 after a career at SMU. 
</P>
<P>
And what about his partner in one of football's all-time passing combinations, 
quarterback John Unitas? He was drafted in the ninth round by the Pittsburgh 
Steelers out of Louisville in 1955, was cut and wound up playing for the 
Bloomfield Rams, a Pittsburgh area semipro team, for $6 a game. It was there 
that the Colts found him. 
</P>
<P>
So within the span of two years, the Colts took a sandlot player and a 
20th-round pick who formed the backbone of a championship team. 
</P>
<P>
There are many such success stories in the NFL and here are just some of them, 
with apologies to those we've left out: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bart Starr, Green Bay Packer quarterback during the dynasty years of the 
60s, was a 17th-round from Alabama in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Deacon Jones, a pillar of the Rams' Fearsome Foursome defensive line, was a 
14th-round selection from South Carolina State in 1961. That same year, the 
Rams found offensive lineman Charlie Cowan of New Mexico Highlands in the 21st 
round and he went on to play for them for 15 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Rams drafted lineman Larry Brooks, who played for them for a decade, 
from Virginia State in the 14th round in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Drew Hill of Georgia Tech, now a star receiver for the Houston Oilers, was 
a last-round pick in 1979, the 328th man selected. The Rams drafted Hill, then 
traded him to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Karl Mecklenburg, the linebacker who anchors the Denver Broncos' defense, 
was a final-round pick from Minnesota in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Roosevelt Brown, lineman from Morgan State, was drafted in the 27th round 
in 1953 by the New York Giants, for whom he played 13 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don Nottingham of Kent State was the last guy taken in the entire 1971 
draft, yet he became an excellent short-yardage ballcarrier for Baltimore, 
earning the nickname the Human Bowling Ball. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A lot of clubs said thanks, but no thanks to Roger Staubach, the Heisman 
Trophy winning quarterback from Navy, but a man with a long-term service 
commitment upon graduation. Set at quarterback with Don Meredith, the Cowboys 
figured he was worth the wait. So in 1964, they picked Staubach in the 10th 
round. Four Super Bowls later, who can argue? 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Raiders were looking at several receivers at San Jose State. Mervyn 
Fernandez was not one of them, but when they saw what he could do, they took a 
chance, drafting him in the 10th round in 1983, although he was destined for 
the Canadian Football League. Five years later, though, Fernandez is wearing 
silver and black. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And just three years ago, the Raiders took a shot in the seventh round, 
grabbing Heisman Trophy-winning running back Bo Jackson of Auburn, even though 
he had insisted that his future was in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most predictable cliches in the draft, any draft, any sport, comes 
out of the mouths of coaches and general managers with increasing frequency as 
the day wears on. 
</P>
<P>
"We just couldn't believe (fill in the name) would still be available," they'll 
say. "This is the guy we wanted all along." 
</P>
<P>
The inference is that their guy is going to be a lot faster, a lot stronger, a 
lot better than anybody dreamed. 
</P>
<P>
These days, it is the club official who think he's going to find some unknown 
phenom who is the dreamer. If you'll notice, few of the above success stories 
happened in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really hard to find diamonds in the rough now," said Dick Steinberg, 
director of player development for the New England Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that the draft is held in April, everybody has time to catch up. Back when 
the draft was held in January, or even November, those teams that really worked 
at evaluating players were rewarded. Now, if there's a guy you heard about in 
the fall, you have a chance to get your coaches caught up. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really the Rams who started it all in the '50s, extensively scouting 
players. Dallas seemed to have a bigger group than anybody else scouting and 
more information in the '60s. The Raiders have always done a good job because 
they do a lot of scratching around, a lot of mailings, dealing with high 
schools." 
</P>
<P>
Another difference is the sheer numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"We draft 12 rounds now," said Raider official Al LoCasale. "We used to draft 
17 rounds, down to the guys who are free agents today. You are drafting 140 
fewer people." 
</P>
<P>
Now, all but three clubs -- the Raiders, Broncos and San Francisco 49ers -- 
belong to scouting combines that share information, further limiting the 
potential for finding unheralded stars on your own. And in February, the top 
350 college stars are invited to a camp where everybody is thoroughly examined 
by football people and doctors alike. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg said: "The way it is now, in the later rounds, you don't have 
somebody drafted where everybody on the other clubs will pop up and say, 'Who 
the hell is he?' You bring in 350 guys, you pretty much take care of 
everybody." 
</P>
<P>
All this has worked against a club like the Raiders, operating outside the 
combine. 
</P>
<P>
"When the draft was in November, December, January, there was not as much time 
for evaluation camps," LoCasale said. "You had just completed your season and 
you were in the draft. That could be a real plus for clubs like ours. Now, with 
the extra three to four months to bring in players for physicals and work them 
out, it works to the disadvantage of teams like the Raiders and Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
"In the old days, there was a lot of rumor to live with. Such and such might 
have started a rumor to try and stash a guy. With the camp in Indianapolis, 
though, you're dealing with more fact than conjecture. Everybody is screened." 
</P>
<P>
It may be a new game now, but, LoCasale says, the Raiders will continue to play 
with their own ball. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not in the scouting pool because we have guys that we have a lot of 
faith in," he said. "There may be 28 scouts who have seen a player and 27 who 
liked him. The other one will bite his tongue and go along, figuring, if they 
are wrong, they'll all be wrong. Our guys say what they think." 
</P>
<P>
Although a member of the scouting combine, the Cowboys are another organization 
averse to the herd mentality. 
</P>
<P>
"We found a lot of bargains in the small colleges," said Dallas' Gil Brandt, a 
pioneer in ferreting out hidden talent. "We found Rayfield Wright at Ft. Valley 
State, Cliff Harris at Ouachita, Pettis Norman at J. C. Smith, and Jethro Pugh 
at Elizabeth City State. 
</P>
<P>
"We entered the league without a draft choice. At the end of the first year, 
Tex (Schramm, general manager), Tom (Landry, coach) and I sat down and planned 
how we were going to be competitive. Tex allocated the money we needed for 
scouting. We had Dick Mansperger in charge of just the small black schools." 
</P>
<P>
Said Joel Buchsbaum of Pro Football Weekly: "When the Cowboys drafted Pugh and 
Wright, half the clubs in the league didn't even know who they were. Everybody 
has the same information now. It's just a matter of seeing how they fit in to 
your club. There are very few sleepers anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Brandt figures even his own methods are no longer operable. 
</P>
<P>
"We really did well at the small schools," he said. "But I think the small 
schools are no longer as productive as they once were because the UCLAs and the 
Iowas do a much better job of recruiting. They no longer just take players 
recommended by their barbers or their friends. 
</P>
<P>
"Then too, with integration, black players have gone to schools all over the 
country. A black player from North Carolina might go to a Minnesota. And with 
the scouting combines today, if there's a player at, say, Helena, Mont., 
everybody knows him." 
</P>
<P>
That's not to say all the fun has gone out of the draft. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing to like a guy and another to know what round to spend a pick 
on," Steinberg said. "That's the secret to putting a draft together. If you 
wait a round on a guy, you may wait too long." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, insisted Buchsbaum, it will always be a guessing game to some extent. 
</P>
<P>
"Because you're dealing with human beings, you can never be sure," he said. 
"Anytime you're dealing with the human element, that is the case. You might 
have a doctor rejected by all the medical schools. But he'll go outside the 
country and become great. Or you have a guy go to Harvard and become a lousy 
doctor. You can't predict human behavior to that degree. 
</P>
<P>
"Larry Brooks was someone everybody knew about. But he had the all-time bad 
body ever seen in college. Boy, was he out of shape! Once he got into shape, he 
became a hell of a player." 
</P>
<P>
Even when you make the right choice, you can't be sure. In 1970, the Raiders 
made tight end Raymond Chester their top pick. 
</P>
<P>
Madden then got a call from another coach who told him, "We've got 300 names on 
a board here and Chester is not one of them. Who is this guy?" 
</P>
<P>
In 1965, the Cowboys and the San Diego Chargers, then in separate leagues, were 
going head to head over an Arizona State running back named Gene Foster. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys finally dropped out and Foster went on to play six years for the 
Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
A Cowboy official later told Sid Gillman, then the Charger coach, that Dallas 
had dropped out because the club's sophisticated computer system had indicated 
Foster wouldn't have much of a chance of making it. 
</P>
<P>
"On third and three, I give the ball to Foster and he gets me a first down," 
Gillman replied. "What can that . . . computer do for you?"

CSUN'S SPELLMAN STAYS FOR THE SHOW IN 11-INNING WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM COLEMAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They held a magic show at Cal State Northridge on Saturday that even Doug 
Henning would have admired. 
</P>
<P>
As the stunned Cal State Sacramento players watched, the amazing Bill Kernen, 
coach of the Matadors, pulled not one, but two rabbits out of his hat. 
</P>
<P>
The first, freshman Eric Spellman, who had pitched 8 2/3 innings all season, 
went the distance in Northridge's 2-1, 11-inning victory over Sacramento, 
ranked third in NCAA Division II. 
</P>
<P>
The second, junior Greg Hansen, in his fifth at-bat of the season, powered the 
game-winning home run over the left-field wall in the 11th. 
</P>
<P>
"Unbelievable," Kernen said after Northridge improved to 22-14-1 with the 
nonconference win. "If anybody can ever figure this game out, he'll be the 
first guy." 
</P>
<P>
It was, indeed, a day of intangibles. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento (29-13), runner-up in the Division II College World Series last 
season, sent its ace, junior right-hander Erik Bennett, against the Matadors. 
Bennett had struck out 104 batters in 78 2/3 innings and had an earned-run 
average of 1.49. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, short on healthy hurlers, countered with Spellman, a walk-on from 
Royal High who had not pitched since Feb. 17 and who had an ERA of 4.15. 
</P>
<P>
So what happens? Bennett pitches six innings of two-hit ball before tiring and 
leaving with the score tied, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Spellman (2-0), relying primarily on a hard slider and off-speed pitch, 
shackled the usually hard-hitting Hornets, limiting them to seven singles and a 
bloop double. He struck out two and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know I was starting until I read the paper today (Saturday). I went 
'Whoa,' " Spellman said. "So I came down here and put it on the line." 
</P>
<P>
Said Sacramento Coach John Smith: "Whatever he was throwing was dancing around 
the plate and we couldn't hit it. He showed a lot of courage staying out there 
for 11 innings." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge took a 1-0 lead in the first inning. Craig Clayton led off with a 
single and Mike Solar followed with a walk. Chae-Ho Chong grounded to third 
baseman Shawn Blankenship, who bobbled the potential double-play ball and 
settled for a force at second. 
</P>
<P>
Anton Siegl followed with a sacrifice fly to right-center. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento tied the score in the fifth. Ryan Kato led off with a single and 
took second on a sacrifice bunt by Blankenship. Kato moved to third on a ground 
out, then scored on a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams had a chance to win in the ninth. The Hornets had three hits in the 
inning, but catcher Rusty McLain threw out pinch-runner Steve Furchner at 
second, and Denny Vigo turned Quinn Gregory's hard smash into a double play to 
turn Sacramento away. 
</P>
<P>
Siegl led off the Matador ninth with a double but was unable to advance as 
reliever Bob Blankenship (4-2) shut Northridge down. 
</P>
<P>
But Hansen, who entered the game as a pinch-runner in the ninth, ended it in 
the 11th by driving a Blankenship fastball over the wall in left.

PROFESSIONAL BOXING TRIPLETS TROY, LLOYD AND FLOYD WEAVER ALIGNED IN BODY AND 
SPIRIT IN PURSUIT OF MIDDLEWEIGHT TITLES

You're a professional fighter. It's one hour before your bout and you're 
sitting in your dressing room, trying to shake loose the butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, you think you see your opponent shadowbox his way down the hall. He 
returns a half-hour later, bruised and with blood on his trunks. 
</P>
<P>
Several minutes later, you think you see him come shadowboxing down the hall 
again. But now, the bruises have mysteriously disappeared. So has the blood. 
</P>
<P>
What's going on? 
</P>
<P>
Again a half-hour goes by. Again he returns, showing the effects of having been 
in a fight. 
</P>
<P>
By now, you are totally confused. But you march out to the ring for your 
scheduled match. And there he is again. Looks like the same guy, appearing as 
fresh as if he hadn't been in a fight. 
</P>
<P>
Are you losing your mind? Taken too many punches? 
</P>
<P>
Nothing of the sort. You have just been exposed to boxing's newest phenomenon, 
the Weaver triplets. 
</P>
<P>
Meet Troy, Lloyd and Floyd, 25-year-old identical Eddie Murphy look-alikes 
currently training at the Ten Goose Boxing Club of North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The differences are slight, the similarities about what you'd expect for 
triplets. 
</P>
<P>
Introducing: 
</P>
<P>
Troy: 5-feet-11, 168 pounds, super middleweight, 7-2-2 record and seven 
knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd: 5-10, 159, middleweight, 6-1 and four knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd: 5-9, 154, junior middleweight, 9-1-1 and seven knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
"It is sort of amazing," said trainer Joe Goossen, who is working with the 
triplets. "One or the other of them might have greater strength, more 
quickness, faster feet, but they have so many similarities in tactics and style 
that only their mother can tell the difference. They all have their moments. In 
a sparring session, you might say, 'Troy looks better', or 'Lloyd looks 
better,' or 'Floyd looks better.' They take turns, but it all balances out." 
</P>
<P>
The first time Goossen met the triplets, he didn't know quite what to think. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in Las Vegas for a Michael Nunn fight," Goossen said, "and I saw them 
in the lobby of a hotel in identical outfits. Your first reaction is, you might 
think this is a tightrope act. But once you see them in their tank tops and see 
them in the ring, you know how serious they are. Plus, they are classy kids." 
</P>
<P>
It was a seriousness bred at an early age. Three of nine brothers, the triplets 
literally grew up in the ring, watching first their father, Ardane, fight as an 
amateur, and then their big brother, Mike, who went on to win the World Boxing 
Assn. heavyweight title. 
</P>
<P>
But before dedicating themselves to boxing, the Weaver trio caused havoc in 
other sports. At Edgewood High in West Covina, they played football and ran 
track. They formed three-quarters of a relay team. And drove many a defender 
crazy as football's only true triple threat. 
</P>
<P>
"It kind of intimidated a defensive back to see the three of us coming down the 
field, going out for a pass. They didn't know which way to go," Floyd said. 
</P>
<P>
Or was it Lloyd? Or Troy? 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes it's all three. Ask a question of one and the other two often join in 
to complete the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
As amateur boxers, the Weavers were as close in skills as ever. Floyd was 25-7, 
Lloyd 28-7, Troy 21-4. One fighter saw all of them fight in one day but did not 
realize he was watching triplets. He approached one of them, scratching his 
head in wonder. 
</P>
<P>
"You fought three times," the stunned onlooker said. "You bad!!!" 
</P>
<P>
In those days, the Weavers admit, they were not above switching places. 
</P>
<P>
"Troy, who was born first, was always the biggest and hit the hardest," Lloyd 
said. "So if I had to face a big guy, I might have him take my place. Or I 
might do the same thing for Floyd." 
</P>
<P>
But asked if they would now, as pros, rather switch than fight, three heads 
shook no in unison. 
</P>
<P>
Nor did they ever switch places as high school athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted," Troy said, "for girls to recognize me for me." 
</P>
<P>
The Weavers have moved to Canoga Park and fight regularly at The Country Club 
in Reseda. Floyd will fight in Monday night's main event against Nate Dryer 
(10-5, five knockouts) of Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
The Weavers are also beginning to venture into other fields. They played clones 
on a Star Trek episode and are currently featured on a billboard and in 
magazines in national ads for a clothing store. 
</P>
<P>
Modeling and acting are possible careers down the line, but all three insist 
the immediate goal is a title for each. They'll stay in separate weight 
divisions because they feel comfortable where they are and because they never 
want to be in a position of having to fight each other. 
</P>
<P>
Watching the trio at the Country Club, where all have fought on the same card 
several times, it is sometimes difficult to ascertain who is fighting. While 
one of them is in the ring, the other two are crouched in a corner, bobbing, 
weaving and throwing phantom punches at the opponent while seemingly feeling 
the pain of every punch thrown at their brother. 
</P>
<P>
"When one of my brothers is tired, I'm tired," Troy said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always a lot of pressure when we all fight," Lloyd said, "because when 
one of us loses, it seems like we all lost. We are a unit." 
</P>
<P>
Like no other.

ST. BERNARD WIN DROPS BOSCO OUT OF CAMINO REAL TIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY GONZALEZ

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bosco Tech Tigers suffered a slow, painful defeat to the St. Bernard 
Vikings on Saturday at St. Bernard's Father Dunphy Field, 13-3. 
</P>
<P>
Before this weekend's games, the Tigers were ranked No. 9 in the CIF 2-A poll 
and were in a first-place tie with El Segundo and St. Bernard in the Camino 
Real League. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard took advantage of seven Bosco errors to record an easy victory in 
the three-hour game. St. Bernard, 13-3 overall, and El Segundo are tied for the 
league lead with 7-1 records. Bosco now holds second place at 6-2 -- both 
losses coming to St. Bernard -- and has a 10-6 overall mark. 
</P>
<P>
"Our kids do not know how to be successful," said Bosco Coach Al Cone. "It's 
the first time the program has been in a playoff hunt, and we aren't playing 
well. (Dan) Melendez did what he wanted with us for the second straight time." 
</P>
<P>
Melendez improved his record to 6-0 and struck out 11 Tigers before leaving the 
mound in the sixth inning. He shut out Bosco, 3-0, the last time the teams met. 
But he lost his shutout Saturday on the second pitch he threw. Bosco shortstop 
Javier Ramirez led off the game with a home run to left field. Ramirez provided 
all the Bosco offense, going 4 for 4 with a double and scoring all three runs. 
</P>
<P>
Melendez had little trouble with anyone else. He also hit his ninth homer of 
the year, giving him 28 in his career, four shy of the CIF Southern Section 
record. 
</P>
<P>
In the bottom of the second inning, the Vikings tied the score on a one-out RBI 
single by Grant Hohman. Then Phil Ruhl reached base on a sure double play ball 
that was muffed by shorstop Ramirez. St. Bernard left fielder Bobby Waller was 
hit by losing pitcher Genaro Esparza, loading the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Hohman scored on a bunt that was dropped by third baseman Jason Armendarez. 
Jeff Richardson slapped a single to right field that rolled through the legs of 
Bobby Saetia for a two-base error, making the score 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings added two runs in the third inning, three in the fourth -- 
including Melendez's solo homer -- and a three-run homer by Al Ibarra in the 
fifth. Bosco Tech scored one run in the third and one in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard, ranked No. 4 in the CIF 2-A, appears headed to a showdown with No. 
2 ranked-El Segundo, whose only league loss is to Bosco Tech.

NOTRE DAME ADVANCES ON RATLIFF'S BLAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Senior shortstop Chad Ratliff lined a two-run home run with two out in the top 
of the eighth inning to lead Notre Dame High past North Torrance, 8-4, in a 
championship semifinal game of the Redondo-Palos Verdes tournament Saturday at 
North Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Ratliff's first home run of the season broke a 4-4 tie and sparked what would 
become a four-run rally. 
</P>
<P>
Ratliff, who led the team in hitting last season with a .442 average but has 
fallen to .260 this year, may be getting back on track. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real nice to see him back in the groove," Notre Dame Coach Bob Mandeville 
said. "We can use his stick." 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame (17-3) will play for the title Saturday at 7 p.m. at Redondo High 
against Lakewood, a 1-0 winner over Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore right-hander Steve Colella (5-3), who relieved starter Cary Wichmann 
in the sixth, pitched three innings of scoreless relief, striking out four and 
walking none. 
</P>
<P>
"That was one of Colella's best outings in a long time," Mandeville said. 
</P>
<P>
Senior catcher Bobby Hughes was three for three with two doubles, Chris Lohman 
was three for five and Kevin Milligan was two for three with two runs batted in 
for Notre Dame, which had 15 hits and stranded 13 runners. 
</P>
<P>
In other Redondo-Palos Verdes tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
Westchester 7, Royal 6 -- Host Westchester (8-11) used a four-run third inning 
and a controversial call in the fifth to win the consolation game. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 7-5, in the fifth inning, Royal (9-14) was in the midst of a rally 
when Will Egan's run was disallowed because he removed his helmet while running 
from third to home. The Highlanders gave up three of Westchester's four 
third-inning runs on two errors. 
</P>
<P>
Royal's Jason Jones was four for four with two home runs a triple and four 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Naranjo was two for four with an RBI and Sean Mitchell was two for four 
with a run scored for the Highlanders. 
</P>
<P>
Culver City 7, Alemany 3 -- Alemany had 11 hits, but stranded 10 runners in a 
fourth-round consolation bracket game at Alemany. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Beauchemin was three for four and Joey Rosselli was two for four with a 
home run for Alemany (13-10). John Lite pitched three scoreless innings of 
relief for Alemany, allowing only two hits. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi 11, Leuzinger 10 -- Crespi scored five runs on four hits and two errors 
in the fourth inning and weathered the Olympians' three-run seventh in a 
consolation semifinal game at Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher John Dempsey ended Leuzinger's late rally by picking off a runner at 
first base. 
</P>
<P>
Dempsey and Chris Romero each had two hits and two RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Chad Nichols (2-3) got the win for the Celts (8-11-2), who used four pitchers 
and three catchers. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks 19, West Torrance 5 -- Lance Martin had a three-run home run in 
the fifth and knocked in five runs to lead the Lancers in a consolation bracket 
game at West Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Christenson hit a three-run home run in the sixth for Thousand Oaks 
(10-7), which used six pitchers who combined to throw a four-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Haffner was four for five with three RBIs for Thousand Oaks, which jumped 
to a 5-0 lead in the first and led, 17-3, after six. 
</P>
<P>
HERITAGE LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
Ribet Academy 12, L. A. Lutheran 7 -- Ribet Academy scored 10 unearned runs at 
L. A. Lutheran. Jim Brown had three hits and Travis Canel and Don Phillips each 
had two for L.A. Lutheran.

NICKOLAI'S BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION ENDS UNHAPPILY AT SAUGUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Nickolai of Simi Valley had everything going for him -- the lead in the 
Street Stock standings, a trophy-dash victory and the pole position for 
Saturday night's 25-lap main event -- all on his 36th birthday -- before a 
crowd of 3,594 at Saugus Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, after the race -- in which he finished last -- an angered Nickolai 
practically crushed an aluminum can in his fist. 
</P>
<P>
Nickolai was black-flagged twice, the second on Lap 15, forcing him from the 
race, as fellow Simi Valley resident Dale White Jr., took the checkered flag. 
</P>
<P>
A jubilant White, who established a track-oval qualifying record of 18.69 
seconds, credited the win to his pit crew. 
</P>
<P>
"Just a bunch of enthusiastic buddies," said White, who began the evening fifth 
in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
Nickolai was waved to the pits during the race's only yellow flag on Lap 10 
because of a fluid leak. He was flagged the second time for a driving 
violation, after which he spun into the infield and parked it. 
</P>
<P>
"They said it was a fuel leak," Nickolai said, referring to track officials. "I 
get in the pits, check the car -- there's not a drop." 
</P>
<P>
White contended that track officials played no part in the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have run him til his tires got hot and gotten under him," White said. 
"I was just waiting." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Phipps of Simi Valley, the three-time defending Sportsman champion, won 
that division's 40-lap main event to pick up his first win of the new season. 
Phipps, who began the evening fifth in the points standings, started the race 
on the pole and led the entire way. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Crowe of Canyon Country won the 15-lap Street Stock figure 8 main event. 
For Crowe, sixth in the standings, the win was his second of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Herb Hill of Simi Valley won the 12-lap Sportsman semi-main event and Dale 
Petty of Agoura won the Street Stock oval main event. 
</P>
<P>
Eight-lap Sportsman heat race winners included Rusty Parr of Newhall, Arlyn 
Olson of Chatsworth and Ace Bennett of Monrovia. Eight-lap Street Stock oval 
heat race winners included John Schwetz and Jim Marlewski, both of Simi Valley, 
Rip Michaels of Arleta and Burt Tester of Canoga Park.

CONSULTANT HAS TIMELY SOLUTION TO PRESSING NEEDS FOR EMPLOYEE LEAVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD E. ROEL, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is not often a brainstorm hits someone while he is watching television, but 
it happened one night to William Kaufman. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Kaufman, an employee-benefits consultant, was viewing a segment of 
"20-20," ABC's weekly news magazine program. The program dealt with 100 
California lottery employees who donated more than 900 hours of their own 
vacation and overtime pay to a popular co-worker suffering from AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"It hit me like a bolt of lightning," Kaufman said. "If you could give time 
when somebody got sick, why couldn't you give time -- and save it -- before 
anybody got sick?" That is when Kaufman, a Woodmere, Long Island, pension and 
financial-planning consultant, created the concept of an employee "time bank." 
</P>
<P>
Such a bank would accrue time donated by employees in the form of unused 
vacation days or sick days, personal time or overtime. They would be converted 
to money (the value of the employees' time) and then be given to co-workers who 
needed extra time off at full pay because of dire personal circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
While the federal government and a few states, such as California and Arizona, 
have initiated similar "job-leave" programs for public employees, experts say 
that Kaufman's time bank appears to be the nation's first such employee-benefit 
program for the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
It is an employee benefit whose time has come, Kaufman said. "There are so many 
catastrophic situations not covered by insurance," he said. These circumstances 
often involve chronic illnesses, but also could include unforeseen personal 
problems, such as painful divorces that require time off to reassemble 
fractured lives. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts say time banks might benefit employers as well. Such plans may 
"reduce absenteeism by encouraging employees to donate (unused) sick days, 
instead of taking them just because they're entitled to," said Robert F. 
Morano, a New York attorney specializing in business law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Common Design Shared 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman added that time banks should appeal to businesses concerned with 
spiraling employee health insurance costs. "Companies are looking for low-cost 
benefits that really deliver," Kaufman said. Time banks would require little 
additional cost for most companies -- Kaufman's consulting fee for setting up 
such a bank ranges from $1.50 to $10 per employee, depending on company size, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
While Kaufman's plans might differ from company to company, his time banks 
share a common design: 
</P>
<P>
First, employees donate time to the bank -- overtime, vacation days, personal 
days, unused sick days -- all according to individual preference and company 
policy. It is all voluntary, like giving to a blood bank, but employees could 
donate one or two days a year, or a few hours a month, Kaufman said. 
</P>
<P>
Next, the company converts the value of the donated time to money in the bank, 
prorating it according to each employee's pay. Then a committee overseeing the 
time bank -- generally three employees and two managers -- reviews applications 
and decides which employees should get time off with pay. An employee doesn't 
have to donate time to be eligible, but that's a factor committees might 
consider, Kaufman said. 
</P>
<P>
When a time bank is established, an initial reserve can be built up, and as 
time is used, it can be replenished by periodic employee contributions. Still, 
a time bank committee should be careful "not to give out time too loosely," 
Kaufman said. A committee can give time in small increments or can choose to 
give only partial salary payments if an employee's financial need is not dire, 
he said.

RANDY LEWIS: PUTTING A FINGER ON THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY;

Harry Connick Jr. is making a lot of people upset. He's upsetting a lot of jazz 
fans for turning his back on the musical developments of the last 40 years and 
championing the early piano styles of Earl (Fatha) Hines, Fats Waller, Art 
Tatum and Duke Ellington. 
</P>
<P>
Connick, who pleaded his musical case last week at the Coach House in San Juan 
Capistrano, also is upsetting a lot of jazz critics for putting more energy 
into his increasingly Hollywood-ized stage act than into his piano playing or 
singing. 
</P>
<P>
And all this brouhaha is upsetting his rapidly growing following, which is 
angry with those close-minded critics and snooty aficionados for suggesting 
that this would-be Emperor of Jazz has nothing going for him except those 
stylish new clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there is far more to the canonization of Connick than his musical 
talent. The fact is that he wouldn't have one-tenth of the copy flowing out of 
writers' pens if he wasn't so young (21), so Southern-gentlemanly affable and 
so gosh-darn handsome. James Booker was a great piano player too, but a 
one-eyed black one with an odd walk and a foul mouth. You hardly heard anything 
about him. 
</P>
<P>
I had gotten a little touch of Harry on his home turf at the New Orleans Jazz 
&amp; Heritage Festival last year, but the Coach House show was the first full 
performance I had seen. I wanted to like him a lot, because I agree with what 
Connick told the audience Tuesday night: that once upon a time, jazz was both 
great music and great fun. 
</P>
<P>
Much criticism of Connick centers on his outgoing personality and will to 
entertain -- two things that have seemed anathema to jazz in the post-War era, 
as the notion that jazz is indeed An Art Form has gone to the musicians' heads. 
</P>
<P>
Experimentalists from Charlie Parker and Thelonious Monk to Ornette Coleman and 
Charles Mingus developed a new vocabulary. But they also turned jazz into 
something more for musicians themselves than for audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Stereotypically, post-bop jazz must be musically complex, intellectually 
demanding and personally remote. It's as though musicians would taint The Form 
by so much as acknowledging the audience. 
</P>
<P>
It's kind of like the Middle Ages, when a select circle of monks guarded all 
knowledge, reserving wisdom to themselves lest the lowly masses soil it with 
their grubby fingers. It's an attitude that irritated me through college, when 
I played in jazz big bands and often ran into other musicians who looked down 
their noses at anything as populist and accessible as rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
While instrumental proficiency has grown exponentially, the modern jazz 
musician, as well as many critics, seems to prize technique over all else. Last 
year one of this paper's critics panned classical clarinetist Richard Stoltzman 
when he fronted the Woody Herman band at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint was that Stoltzman, whose reputation was built on his Beethoven 
and Mozart and not on his Benny and Woody, didn't have the chops of any number 
of competent jazz reed men. True enough. But for my money, his fluid and 
melodic soloing had far more heart. 
</P>
<P>
So, for a variety of reasons, it was encouraging to hear Connick talk about his 
love for an earlier generation of musicians who played music that could appeal 
to the listener emotionally as well as intellectually. 
</P>
<P>
The reviews? 
</P>
<P>
"Columbia Records is doing for Harry Connick Jr. what it did for Wynton 
Marsalis in 1982. The difference between the two, however, is that Marsalis had 
the talent to warrant the hype; Connick, as indicated during his hourlong 
opening set, does not," wrote Times critic A. James Liska about Connick's 
performance at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill in L.A. earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Daily News music critic Richard S. Ginell wrote that in a 1987 performance at 
the Roxy, Connick left the impression "of a fumbling, heavy-handed pianist who 
couldn't swing to save his life. Now," Ginell wrote, "it is astonishing to see 
that Connick has become some kind of media idol . . . pursued by Hollywood, 
accompanied by hurrahs from reviewers and other media nabobs who perhaps don't 
know any better." The Connick who returned to Southern California this month, 
Ginell said, "was pretty much the same performer we saw at the Roxy -- only 
slicker and more personable." 
</P>
<P>
Connick addressed the critical fusillade at the Coach House on Tuesday, saying 
he would rather win over 500 regular people than 5 critics. The audience ate it 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Truth be told, those reviewers did go too far. His runs and flourishes weren't 
always metronomically precise, and he never approached the wizardry of Tatum or 
the other greats he idolizes. But he played energetically, with a particularly 
strong left hand, and at times engaged in stimulating exchanges with bassist 
Ben Wolfe that represented the best of symbiosis. Other times, though, he 
restricted his keyboard efforts to pointless noodling, and his singing was 
rarely more than pleasantly forgettable. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest question raised by his performance, though, is why he seems 
interested in being a devil-may-care raconteur who shows everyone a great time 
rather than a musician who touches everyone with great music. Connick's real 
problem isn't the critical barbs; it's that in rebelling against the somberness 
of most jazz, he has swung too far the other way. 
</P>
<P>
By succumbing to the accolades at such an early point in his career, Connick 
may be giving short shrift to what could be a big talent. Remember what 
happened when Elvis decided to be a superstar instead of just a great rock 'n' 
roll singer? Connick isn't the Elvis of jazz, though some of the hype might 
lead you to think so. 
</P>
<P>
Saving graces are that he is young enough to grow out of his adolescent 
reaction to stardom, and that he does have a great sense of history, evident in 
a repertoire that includes standards such as "Let's Call the Whole Thing Off," 
"The Sunny Side of the Street" and "Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone." 
</P>
<P>
At least Connick is on the right track. A shot in the arm, or perhaps a kick in 
the pants, is just what jazz needs to get it off its smug keister. 
</P>
<P>
But in his zeal to get audiences humming "I'm Just Wild About Harry," Connick 
shouldn't forget that when it comes to his music, it's gotta be "All or Nothing 
at All."

RECORDING THE EXOTIC; 
</P>
<P>
VISUAL ANTHROPOLOGY HAS COME A LONG WAY SINCE THE FILMING OF 'NANOOK OF THE 
NORTH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Timothy Asch, director of USC's Center for Visual Anthropology, sees a 
not-too-distant day when new anthropological research will be published 
complete with accompanying films, stored on a 3-inch videodisc in a pocket 
inside the book jacket. 
</P>
<P>
Asch, who co-produced with anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon a series of 
ground-breaking films on the fierce Yanomamo Indians of South America, sees a 
number of ways in which his science will benefit from the explosion of video 
technology, which puts ever-more-sophisticated cameras into ever-smaller and 
easier-to-use packages. 
</P>
<P>
"The type of knowledge and expertise that anthropologists have could, in 
collaboration with ethnographic film makers, turn into a tremendous resource," 
Asch told an audience at the 12th annual Symposium of Man held recently at Cal 
State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The use of film to record non-Western cultures is nothing new, stretching back 
at least to "Nanook of the North," Robert Flaherty's famed 1921 docudrama about 
an Eskimo family. Since the '20s, cultural anthropologists have often turned to 
film as a way to record the people and cultures they study. 
</P>
<P>
But sound synchronization in the field was not practical until about 1960, and 
film equipment has until recently been cumbersome and difficult to use under 
the often-trying conditions that greet anthropologists. Advances in film and 
especially video technology, developed primarily for the entertainment 
industry, have revolutionized ethnographic film making, Asch said. 
</P>
<P>
As director of the USC master's degree program in visual anthropology, Asch is 
training film makers who will collaborate with field anthropologists to record 
data that was once the exclusive domain of notebook and sketch pad. 
</P>
<P>
One advantage to recording a culture on film or video is that several 
scientists can view the same piece of data, rather than having to rely on one 
person's observations, according to noted ethnographic film maker Patsy Asch, 
Timothy's wife. In some instances, the ability to repeatedly view a film is 
another advantage, as in the case of dance kinesics or studying intricate 
rituals. 
</P>
<P>
But most importantly, the films often serve as a final record of many tribal 
cultures that are being decimated by the destruction of tropical forests and by 
other encroachments of civilization. 
</P>
<P>
"The tribal world is disappearing at a staggeringly high rate, one that is 
accelerating on a day-by-day basis," said Chagnon, another of the panelists. A 
professor at UC Santa Barbara since 1984, Chagnon's 25 years of studying the 
Yanomamo has formed the basis of one of the best-known case studies in cultural 
anthropology, one that is found in most introductory textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
Chagnon, who concentrates on Yanomamo tribes in southern Venezuela, said he has 
seen changes in the culture each time he returns (13 visits, totaling 50 
months). The Yanomamo of northern Brazil, meanwhile, have been virtually wiped 
out in recent years, since the discovery of gold on their land in 1987 
attracted more than 40,000 prospectors virtually overnight. 
</P>
<P>
The Yanomamo of southern Venezuela, meanwhile, may have a better chance of 
survival precisely because the films of Tim Asch and Chagnon have given them a 
place in the public consciousness, Chagnon believes. 
</P>
<P>
"There are groups like the Yanomamo and the bushmen (of southwest Africa's 
Kalahari Desert) who have become very, very significant in the minds of lots 
and lots of people," Chagnon said. "Because they have been documented in a very 
positivistic, straightforward, scientific way, (that) can now be used to help 
them to survive the destruction that is going on. . . . They have become 
symbols. They represent the tragedy of all other tribal people in all places on 
Earth." 
</P>
<P>
Apart from Chagnon's assertions on the potential political uses of ethnographic 
film, other panelists raised doubts about its scientific importance. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that technology is going to save us," said Jay Ruby, an 
anthropology professor at Temple University in Philadelphia and editor of the 
journal, Visual Anthropology. "CD ROMs and 8-mm video and high-resolution 
television are not going to help us think." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than training more people to make movies, Ruby suggested teaching 
students how to analyze and interpret filmed data. "I think we're drowning in a 
sea of images, and I'd like to argue that we take fewer pictures and start 
thinking more, because I'm very bored with continually seeing basically the 
same lame ideas on the screen," Ruby said. 
</P>
<P>
"I work with some students who are just technological wizards but don't have a 
single thing to say," Ruby said. "They're all dressed up with nowhere to go." 
</P>
<P>
One panelist, John Homiak, is an archivist with the Human Studies Film Archives 
at the Smithsonian Institution. More than 5 million feet of film and video are 
stored in the archives, Homiak said, but he thinks the resource is woefully 
under-utilized. 
</P>
<P>
That is largely because most anthropologists want to make their name with their 
own field research, Tim Asch said, rather than by studying the research of 
other anthropologists. But, he added, the collected films and videos will take 
on more importance as time goes on and the tribal cultures recorded for 
posterity continue to be diluted and sometimes obliterated. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine, he said, if there existed a film record of an Aztec sacrifice, or of a 
vintage performance of Shakespeare's "King Lear" at the Globe Theatre. It may 
be 100 or 200 years before the archives are truly utilized. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to go for the long term," Asch argued. "It's important to take visual 
anthropology seriously."

ANAHEIM ORDINANCE; 
</P>
<P>
SPRINKLER LAWS IGNITE DEBATE OVER COST, SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONN JOHNSTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Anaheim last week became one of the few cities in the country to require 
sprinklers in all new homes, it took sides in a growing nationwide debate over 
whether sprinklers save thousands of lives or simply add thousands of dollars 
to the price of every new house. 
</P>
<P>
The emerging battle over mandatory fire sprinklers pits two familiar foes 
against each other: firefighters who argue that the devices can prevent deaths 
and millions of dollars in losses, and building industry officials who say 
those claims are exaggerated and that the price of sprinklers -- about $2,000 
per home -- will further discourage home buyers in an already expensive market. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 communities in the United States now require sprinklers for 
single-family homes, apartments and condominiums, contrasted with only half a 
dozen in 1981, according to Operation Life Safety in Washington, an affiliate 
of the International Assn. of Fire Chiefs. Orange County led the country in 
1980, when San Clemente became the first city to require sprinklers in new 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an encouraging thing that has started to spread," said Harvey Seymour, 
spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute. "Up until now, the best 
ammunition was smoke detectors. But nothing works as well as sprinklers." 
</P>
<P>
Smoke detectors, now installed in three-fourths of America's homes, are 
credited with saving up to 1,000 lives a year, according to the Insurance 
Information Institute in New York City. Sprinklers can save more lives, 
firefighters say. 
</P>
<P>
A 1988 report by the National Bureau of Standards estimated that adding 
sprinklers to one- and two-family homes could reduce fire deaths by as much as 
60% to 70% a year, "a savings of about 2,500 lives a year." 
</P>
<P>
Of 55 fires involving residential sprinkler systems studied by Life Safety 
since 1986, the devices saved 44 lives and millions of dollars in property, 
said director Jim Dalton. "And there has never been a multiple loss of life in 
a fully sprinkled building," Dalton added. 
</P>
<P>
In Georgia, Cobb County Fire Chief David Hilton credits a 1981 ordinance with 
saving at least 18 lives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Less Than 1% of Homes 
</P>
<P>
Yet because sprinklers exist in less than 1% of American homes, reliable data 
about them is scarce and often incomplete. Most of the information is 
anecdotal, as in a recent Napa, Calif., fire in which a sprinkler extinguished 
flames on a baby's quilt and saved the child, said Orange County Fire Capt. 
Hank Raymond. 
</P>
<P>
But laws requiring the sprinkler systems will not come easily. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a serious affordable-housing problem," said John Withers, spokesman 
for the Orange County chapter of the Building Industry Assn. of Southern 
California. "To rush ahead and require sprinklers on a mandatory basis is 
ill-advised, given the tremendous costs involved and the marginal benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Opposing mandatory sprinklers can be about as popular as opposing apple pie and 
baseball, builders battling the ordinances concede. But they say consumers 
don't want sprinklers, that the systems cost too much when home prices are 
already steep, and that insurance savings and safety claims by sprinkler 
proponents are unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
"Houses today are safer than they have ever been," Withers said. "Virtually all 
fire fatalities are in structures more than 20 years old. If you want to be 
totally safe, let's go back to adobe huts. How far do you go, and at what 
cost?" 
</P>
<P>
And building industry officials contend that sprinkler systems may not be as 
reliable as proponents maintain. Mechanical problems, human error and tampering 
may cause them to fail. Withers said sprinklers can malfunction. He cited the 
system that flooded a Los Alamitos warehouse when the 1987 Whittier earthquake 
shook the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concerned With Liability 
</P>
<P>
Withers said his concern is liability. He wonders who would be accountable if 
the system fails in a fire: builders, the subcontractors that install the 
systems, or the sprinkler's manufacturer? 
</P>
<P>
Sprinkler technology, itself, is simple. Each sprinkler head, typically 
installed in the ceiling, is soldered to hold back the water until it is 
needed. When there is a fire, heat melts the solder on the head and releases 
the water automatically. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond, of the Orange County Fire Department, said he has heard complaints 
from homeowners that the sprinklers keep running after being triggered, 
flooding a room. 
</P>
<P>
But the damage is usually confined to one room because a single sprinkler head 
usually contains a fire there, he said. Rarely are two heads triggered. And 
sprinklers extinguish the fire 97% of the time before firefighters arrive, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Quick-response sprinklers release from 13 to 25 gallons of water a minute," 
Raymond said. "Compare that to the 125 to 250 gallons a minute from a 
firefighter's hose, and you're looking at a dramatic difference in water 
damage." 
</P>
<P>
Spurred by safety concerns and tighter firefighting budgets, more and more 
cities are adopting sprinkler ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fewer Fire Stations 
</P>
<P>
In San Clemente, city officials trimmed from nine to five the number of future 
fire stations in their long-range plans. And fire hydrants, which cost $2,500 
apiece, now are spaced 400 feet apart in new neighborhoods, contrasted with 250 
feet in older areas, said Fire Capt. Edward P. Harrod. 
</P>
<P>
Studies also show that sprinklers reduce property loss in fires, typically by 
as much as 80%. 
</P>
<P>
Those kinds of bottom-line figures may eventually bring America's insurance 
industry to the home sprinkler battle. 
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly something the insurance industry generally supports," said 
George Tye, spokesman for the Assn. of California Insurance Cos. "Any kinds of 
loss mitigation are generally encouraged. But it's not really been an issue 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
For now, few insurance companies in Southern California offer discounts to 
homeowners with sprinklers, in large part because so little data is available, 
industry officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no base to study in California until there is a widespread demand," 
said John Millen, spokesman for the Farmers Insurance Group Cos., which write 
about 700,000 homeowner policies in Southern California. "We're studying it 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
Allstate Insurance Co. just began offering a 10% discount last May to 
homeowners with central sprinkler systems, said Moira Uhl, a company 
spokeswoman in Los Angeles. She said the average Allstate homeowner's annual 
premium in Orange County is $408, less about $41 for homeowners with 
sprinklers. But that does not go very far in covering the cost of a sprinkler 
system, now about $1 per square foot of floor space. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leaving Out Amenities 
</P>
<P>
Until the cost of sprinklers drops, the home-building industry will oppose 
them, said Withers of the BIA. If the devices are forced on the industry, 
builders will simply reduce their construction costs by leaving some amenities 
out of condominiums, apartments and homes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that sprinklers will eventually be incorporated into housing," 
Withers said. "But not until you have enough of them out there, with the right 
technology and mass produced." 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Council, California deputy state fire marshal, hopes that sprinklers will 
follow the pattern of smoke detectors, once priced at $70 apiece and now 
available for as little as $10. 
</P>
<P>
"Cost-wise, the more of these things that are out there and the more that are 
put in, the more prices will go down," Council said. "That will stimulate 
different manufacturers. And we will see a dramatic saving of lives."

VIETNAMESE COMMUNITY DROPS PLANS FOR PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE FRANK and DAVID REYES, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vietnamese leaders in Westminster have dropped plans to hold a controversial 
parade to honor slain South Vietnamese soldiers, possibly ending a furor that 
has raged for more than a week over the racially charged remarks of a 
Westminster city councilman in voting against a parade permit. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam veteran Chuyen V. Nguyen, a spokesman for the Vietnamese community in 
Westminster, said Saturday that about two dozen representatives decided late 
Friday night to cancel any plans to hold a parade this year because there is 
not enough time to properly prepare. 
</P>
<P>
The parade was planned for June as part of a Vietnamese holiday and intended to 
honor all soldiers who died fighting Communists in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"We hate to see so much publicity surrounding this parade and then not be 
completely prepared," Nguyen said. "We are afraid of making mistakes and then 
looking bad." 
</P>
<P>
The uproar began last week when the South Vietnamese Armed Forces Day committee 
was denied a parade permit on a 4-1 vote of the Westminster City Council. At a 
meeting televised on a local cable channel, Councilman Frank Fry Jr. told the 
veterans that they should commemorate their war dead on a U.S. holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to be South Vietnamese," the councilman had said, "go back to 
South Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
Fry apologized for his remarks. He said he did not intend to "belittle . . . 
the sacrifice made by our allies, the South Vietnamese, during the Vietnam War. 
. . . I would like to apologize for my statements that have caused this 
outcry." 
</P>
<P>
Fry said Saturday that he planned to meet with members of the Vietnamese 
community soon. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen said Fry contacted the group Friday and wanted to meet to "clear up all 
misunderstandings and promote better harmony in the future, and he wants to 
show he is sincere in his apology. And we want to show the councilman we are 
sincere in our position." 
</P>
<P>
The earlier remarks by Fry prompted a recall campaign that was initiated by an 
ad hoc committee representing about 30 Vietnamese organizations. But the 
campaign was called off after Fry apologized. More than 5,000 flyers and 500 
posters critical of Fry had been printed in Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, Nguyen said, they were considering applying for a parade 
permit in Santa Ana, where several city officials voiced approval in 
preliminary discussions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a touchy situation for us," Nguyen said. "If we go to Santa Ana, it would 
mean we kind of had to get out of town to find help." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Reconsider 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Westminster Mayor Charles V. Smith and several City Council members 
have said they would consider the veterans' parade application again. 
</P>
<P>
Tien Nguyen, a spokesman for the South Vietnamese Armed Forces Day committee, 
said Friday that Fry had telephoned and asked to meet with him to cement his 
previously stated apology. 
</P>
<P>
"We will contact Mr. Fry, we will shake his hand," said Tien Nguyen. "And I 
hope we will work together in the future on this issue." 
</P>
<P>
Chuyen Nguyen said: "We will write a letter of gratitude to the Santa Ana City 
Council for their generous offer to let us hold the parade in their city. We 
respect the decision of the City Council of Westminster not to give us a permit 
for the parade because we are law-biding citizens." 
</P>
<P>
He said memorial services will be conducted as usual on June 17 at Melrose 
Abbey in Anaheim.

BICYCLIST, 41, INJURED BY HIT-RUN CAR IN ANAHEIM 
</P>

A 41-year-old bicyclist was critically injured Saturday when he was struck by a 
speeding automobile near the intersection of State College Boulevard and 
Cerritos Avenue in Anaheim. The automobile, described by witnesses as small and 
gray or off-white, went north on State College after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim police said the injured man, Michael Joseph McClary, 41, of Anaheim, 
was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange with multiple head injuries. McClary 
was listed as in critical condition late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said McClary was riding his 10-speed bicycle north in the 1500 block 
of State College when he was struck from the rear by the car. The victim was 
found by police and paramedics in the left-hand turn lane at Cerritos Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, the hit-and-run vehicle was driven by a man. 
</P>
<P>
Officers requested that anyone with information about the accident call the 
Anaheim Police Department.

NEWPORT COUNCIL TO CONSIDER 10 P.M. CURFEW AT BEACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Newport Beach City Council on Monday night will consider setting a 10 p.m. 
curfew at city beaches in an effort to reduce late-night revelry that 
oceanfront residents say invades their privacy and keeps them awake. 
</P>
<P>
City beaches, which stretch from the Santa Ana River south to the Wedge at the 
Newport Harbor entrance, now close at midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach, San Clemente and Seal Beach have midnight curfews; Laguna 
Beach essentially has none. Some state beaches, such as the Newport 
Beach-operated Corona del Mar State Beach, close at 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Because their front yards are shared by the public, Newport residents living on 
the water's edge say they are continually subjected to traffic and noisy 
beach-goers long past midnight. So they have banded together in asking the City 
Council to adopt what they say is a fair compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just virtual prisoners," said Dayna Pettit, president of the Balboa 
Peninsula Point Assn., one of three homeowner groups lobbying for the early 
beach closure. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not against partying," Pettit said. "But there has to be a time when the 
city effects measures that balance the rights of the tourists and property 
owners." 
</P>
<P>
To avoid a legal fight over that balance, Chief of Police Arb Campbell and 
Newport Beach City Manager Robert L. Wynn and his staff are urging the City 
Council to reject the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Wynn and Campbell are recommending the installation of lights facing 
the shoreline on the beach flanking the Balboa and Newport Beach piers to 
discourage lawlessness and signal the beaches' closing. 
</P>
<P>
"Our objection is twofold," Wynn said. An earlier curfew "means even a resident 
could not go along the beach" after 10 p.m. Also, Wynn said, the noise and 
traffic problems from late night beach-goers are concentrated around the two 
piers, so early closing of beaches for the entire 5.8 miles may be overkill. 
</P>
<P>
Pettit and the presidents of two other large homeowner associations lobbying 
for earlier beach closure think lights may not be enough. 
</P>
<P>
In an April 16 letter to city officials, Pettit and her association also 
suggested that at 10 p.m., police could sweep the beach area in a helicopter 
and make loudspeaker announcements that the beach is closed. 
</P>
<P>
"And residents would not object at 10 p.m. as they did at midnight." 
</P>
<P>
Pettit's group, the Central Newport Beach Community Assn. and the West Newport 
Beach Assn., which together represent several hundred property owners along the 
beach, argue that the early beach closure would help police enforce the 
citywide 10 p.m. curfew for minors. Also, they say, there is a shortage of 
officers at beach closing time because shifts change at midnight. 
</P>
<P>
But they favor allowing the beach near the Balboa Pier to remain open until 
midnight because it is the only spot with fire rings. 
</P>
<P>
In opposing the earlier beach closure, however, Police Chief Campbell said more 
people would need to be "ushered" from the beach at 10 p.m. than at midnight. 
"This would result in a significant enforcement problem for the Police 
Department." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Officers Needed 
</P>
<P>
At least three new officers and two four-wheel-drive vehicles would be needed, 
he said. He urged the lighting approach, which he estimated would cost about 
$30,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Gold has lived with his wife, Helen, on the Balboa Peninsula beachfront 
for 22 years. He supports closing the beach at 10 p.m. but admits "there really 
aren't that many people out there after 10." 
</P>
<P>
But those that do stay late can be downright obnoxious, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been out here before when a guy is out 10 feet from my wall making out 
with his girlfriend and a guy is urinating in my front yard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He wouldn't mind announcements by helicopter loudspeaker, but "the lights I'm 
against. That's stupid. Any encroachments like that I'm against." 
</P>
<P>
The 172 residents who responded to questionnaires from the Balboa Peninsula 
Point Assn. shared many of Gold's complaints. Pettit said all but 12 
respondents favored closing the beach at 10 p.m. The few who opposed the idea 
echoed the following sentiment: 
</P>
<P>
"I'd hate to get in trouble with the law should I decide on taking a midnight 
stroll," one man wrote. "This is not something we do but once in a while. I 
just would like to have that option open."

PREPS: INEVITABLE DELAYED, BUT SINGBANDITH WINS TRIPLE JUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Phouphet Singbandith of Magnolia High School arrived at Mt. San Antonio College 
at 8 a.m. Saturday expecting to begin triple-jumping as scheduled at noon. 
</P>
<P>
But the Turner Broadcasting System, the cable TV network that was televising 
the Mt. SAC Relays, had other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
The network asked for, and got, a late scheduling change, which pushed back the 
start of the boys' invitational triple jump to about 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
So while the fans watched Larry Myricks win the open long jump, held at noon, 
in a wind-aided 28-feet 5-inches, Singbandith found himself with time on his 
hands. And, to make matters worse, Singbandith had injured his left knee 
slightly in a dual meet Thursday and wore a brace for support. 
</P>
<P>
It was hardly the best of circumstances for Singbandith, who was intent on 
breaking the Orange County record of 50-3 1/2, set by Ken Williams of Troy in 
1982. He came into the meet with a best of 50-3, the second-best jump by a 
county athlete ever. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Singbandith is as unflappable as he is good at hopping, 
skipping and jumping. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't get the record, but he won the event by jumping 49-10 1/2. Lenny 
McGill of Orange Glen was second with a mark of 49-2 1/2. Russell White of 
Crespi, the all-time state career rushing leader, was third with a 47-7 1/2 
jump. 
</P>
<P>
Singbandith said neither the time delay nor the sore knee bothered him. 
</P>
<P>
"Waiting was probably better for me," he said "I got a chance to rest my knee." 
</P>
<P>
And even if he did break Williams' record, the wind would have been over the 
allowable 2.0 meters per second. It was 2.47 meters per second on his winning 
jump. 
</P>
<P>
Singbandith said he was just happy to win. 
</P>
<P>
He was the only Orange County athlete to win an event in the two-day high 
school portion of the meet. 
</P>
<P>
Others came close, but none closer than Eddie Lavelle of Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
With 500 meters left in the boys' invitational 1,500 meters, Lavelle began 
moving toward the front of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
The leaders had gone through the 400 in a swift 61.1 seconds and the 800 in 
2:06.4 and Lavelle, who had been running not-so-comfortably in the pack, 
figured it was time to head into the lead. 
</P>
<P>
He was passed shortly thereafter by Louie Quintena of Arroyo Grande, but got 
back into the lead and looked strong going into the final 100 meters. 
</P>
<P>
But Francis O'Neill of San Pasqual, who had led for the first half of the race, 
rocketed past in the final 60 meters for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill's winning time of 3:53.78 is the best in the nation this season. 
Lavelle, who finished second, ran 3:54.27, the No. 2 time in the country this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to hold on as long as I could," Lavelle said. "O'Neill had a good kick 
today." 
</P>
<P>
It was a personal best for Lavelle, who rebounded from a seventh-place finish 
in the 3,000 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't run too well last night," he said. "I'm more happy with how I reacted 
to the competition today." 
</P>
<P>
That didn't include dodging other runners in the close pack early in the race, 
however. Lavelle had two spike wounds, one on each shin, to show for his time 
spent in the pack. 
</P>
<P>
"War wounds," he called them. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Nichols of Edison found the going equally as difficult in the boys' 
invitational 800. 
</P>
<P>
He ran most of the first lap, covered in 54.96 by Mike McLean of Edmonton, 
Canada, out in the third lane. 
</P>
<P>
He settled into position on the second lap and finished third behind McLean and 
Arturo Espejel of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
McLean ran 1:52.34 and Espejel and Nichols were each timed in 1:52.54. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols' time is the best in the state this season. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for a guy who ran just his fourth 800 on Saturday. Nichols had been a 
400 runner until moving up in distance this season. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. SAC Notes 
</P>
<P>
Brent Noon of Fallbrook won the shotput with a throw of 66-feet-3 1/2 inches. 
Among those Noon -- the national leader this season with a throw of 68-1 3/4 -- 
defeated was Greg Thurston of Edison, who threw 55-9 1/2 for fourth place. 
Jerry Gillespie of Westminster was fifth with a toss of 54-10. . . . Eric 
Whitcomb of Valencia, who had competed in a number of relay events Friday at 
Mt. SAC, took third in the pole vault Saturday with a leap of 14-6. Jason 
Henlon of Lynwood was the winner, going 15-0. . . . Walnut, aided by a strong 
1,600-meter leg by Scott Hempel, won the distance medley relay in 10:19.3. San 
Pasqual, with Francis O'Neill anchoring, was second in 10:25.0. El Modena, with 
Joe Komarinski running the final leg, was third in 10:26.6. . . . Corona del 
Mar was third in its heat of the shuttle hurdles relay. . . . Dariel Whipple of 
Western was fourth in the long jump with a leap of 20-11. Robert Anderson of 
L.A. Jordan won by jumping 22-0 3/4. . . . Edison finished fourth in the 4 x 
800 relay in 8:00.69. Eisenhower won in a swift 7:49.37. . . . Canyon was third 
in the 4 x 200 relay with a time of 1:31.58.

UC IRVINE'S STIRLING RUNS HER RACE AND QUALIFIES FOR NCAA MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brigid Stirling of UC Irvine did precisely what she had to do Saturday night at 
the Mt. San Antonio College Relays in order to qualify for the National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. meet in the 3,000 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Stirling, a junior, stayed well behind the early leaders and ran steady 
75-second laps for the 7 1/2-lap race. Her conservative strategy paid off in a 
personal-best time of 9 minutes 23.8 seconds, just under the NCAA qualifying 
time of 9:25. 
</P>
<P>
Trina Leopold of Team Nike won the race in commanding fashion in 9:09.97, the 
fastest time by an American this year. Stirling was 11th. 
</P>
<P>
"She (Stirling) stayed out of the fast stuff," UC Irvine Coach Vince O'Boyle 
said. "We wanted her to come by at 5 minutes and she was at 4:57. Almost every 
lap was at 75. Only one was at 76." 
</P>
<P>
Stirling was the Big West Conference cross-country champion last fall, but this 
was her first important track meet for Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
While at Claremont-McKenna, Stirling had been a Division III All-American with 
a 3,000 best of 9:28. She transfered to Irvine last fall. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big debut for her," O'Boyle said. 
</P>
<P>
But not nearly as big as the NCAA meet, which will be in Provo, Utah in early 
June. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's Beth McGrann also qualified for the NCAA meet by running 33:07 in the 
10,000 meters. It also was a personal best for McGrann, who was All-American in 
the event last year. Monica Joyce of Ireland won the race in an unofficial time 
of 32:21.14, a meet record. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine finished fifth in the men's distance medley relay with a time of 
9:56.97, but O'Boyle was encouraged by the performance of Jim Geerlings. 
Geerlings, a freshman from Newport Harbor High School, ran 3:01 on the opening, 
1,200-meter leg. 
</P>
<P>
Like Stirling, Geerlings ran a steady pace. He passed the 400 mark in 60 
seconds and the 800 in 2:00. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Shaben ran 48.5 for the 400 leg, then passed the baton to Kevin Harris, 
who ran 1:54.4 for the 800. Irvine was in second place at that point, trailing 
the Atlantic Coast Club, the eventual winner in 9:51.37. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Houlgate ran 4:12.4 on the 1,600 anchor leg, but it wasn't enough as 
Irvine fell to fifth.

FAGER'S JUMP GETS IT STARTED FOR MISSION VIEJO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Lisa Fager set the tone for Mission Viejo High School with one of the state's 
best girls' triple jumps of the year, 39-11 1/2, at the Orange County Girls' 
Track and Field Championships at Rancho Santiago College Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The jump passed the meet record set in 1986 of 38-3 1/2 by Debbie Orr of Ocean 
View. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I was going to jump that far," said Fager, a junior who was 
named field athlete of the meet. "I was just hoping to break the meet record. 
I'm not trying to be first in the state, I'm just trying to improve myself." 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo won the championship with 84 points, 36 from the jumps. Edison 
finished second with 48, and Woodbridge was third with 38. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited by (Fager's) mark, but not surprised," said John Hattrup, Mission 
Viejo's jump coach. "She's got the potential to go farther." 
</P>
<P>
Canyon's Allison Franke, the field athlete of the meet the past two years, 
finished second in the triple jump (38-1 1/4), broke her meet record in the 
discus with a throw of 155-5 and won the 100-meter hurdles in 14.91. 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge's Kaci Keffer was named sprinter of the meet after victories in the 
400 meters (59.96) and 300 hurdles (45.39). Distance runner of the meet was 
Edison freshman Shelley Taylor, who won the 1,500 in 4:43.93 and placed second 
in the 800 in 2:19.44, behind Capistrano Valley's Laurinda Malhaupt (2:16.38).
