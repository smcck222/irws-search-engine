THEY WIN BY A WHISKER IN HAIR-RAISING CONTEST; 
</P>
<P>
THOUSAND OAKS: TO PREPARE FOR THE ANNUAL CONEJO VALLEY DAYS JUDGING OF BEARDS 
AND MUSTACHES ONE CONTESTANT LOADED UP ON CLAMS AND SCALLOPS; ANOTHER RUBBED IN 
FABRIC SOFTENER.

<P>
Thirty-one bewhiskered men, some armed with hair spray, and others au naturel, 
competed Sunday in the "Whiskeroo" contest to win acclaim for their facial 
hair. 
</P>
<P>
The categories in the contest -- held as part of the Conejo Valley Days 
celebration in Thousand Oaks -- included the softest beard, fullest beard, best 
beard, "most unique" mustache, best mustache and even the "scroungiest" beard. 
</P>
<P>
Each man came determined to win. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Meade, a landscape contractor from Thousand Oaks who competed in the 
"most unique" mustache contest, said the secret to keeping his large, bristly 
mustache strong and healthy is eating clams and scallops. 
</P>
<P>
How many? "As much as I can eat," said Meade, who won the best mustache contest 
in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Norman (Dallas) Wright, a welder and "Thousand Oakie since 1967," said that to 
prepare for the softest beard contest he rubbed fabric softener into his 
whiskers. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes my beard snuggly soft," said Wright, who won the best beard contest 
in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The contest was judged by 10 beauty pageant winners wearing silver crowns, 
including Miss Teen Conejo Valley, Miss Conejo Valley, and Miss Mom and 
Daughter Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
And they, like the competitors, took the contest seriously. Amy Kester, who 
</P>
<P>
wore a sash that read "Miss Teen Conejo Valley Princess," said she judged the 
contestants' whiskers on "form, texture and cleanliness." 
</P>
<P>
Missie Kelber, Miss Conejo Valley, said she judged the "most unique" mustache 
contest by looking for "something you don't see every day." 
</P>
<P>
To judge the softest beard contest, each beauty pageant winner stroked the 
contestants' beards with the palms and backs of her hands. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Erickson, chairman of the "Whiskeroo" committee and a four-time winner of 
the best beard competition, said the contest has been held every year since 
1968. 
</P>
<P>
But he said he is not sure how the competition originated. "I guess it just 
seemed like something that goes with the Conejo Valley Days," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson said it is always difficult to guess how the judges will make their 
decisions. "One year they may like a big, long beard, and the next they like a 
small, short beard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When the contest was over, Wright and his fabric-softener-laced beard had lost 
out in the softest beard competition to Robert Nobbs, a milkman from Thousand 
Oaks, who said he did nothing special to prepare his beard for the contest. 
</P>
<P>
The fullest beard contest was won by Ernie Roberts, a landscape architect from 
Agoura Hills, who sported a frizzy, Adam's-apple-length strawberry-blond beard. 
Roberts, who said he has competed in the contest for the last three years but 
has never won, also said he did nothing special to prepare his beard for the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just its natural state," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The best beard contest was won by Rick Beal, a 20-year resident of Thousand 
Oaks, who sported a short, gray, well-trimmed beard and mustache that would 
have looked at home in an executive boardroom. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Mitchell, a construction worker from Santa Clarita who wore a mustache 
that stretched down to his jaw and curled upward, won the "most unique" 
mustache contest. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said he used hair spray, rather than wax, to shape his whiskers. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Ruhman, who works at an auto dealership in Thousand Oaks, beat Meade to 
win the best mustache contest. Ruhman said he won because he keeps his mustache 
short and well groomed. 
</P>
<P>
"Girls like small, well-trimmed mustaches that are bushy just enough to tickle 
them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the highlight of the afternoon was the "scroungiest" beard competition won 
by Paul Kunzler, an unemployed Thousand Oaks resident. Kunzler said he 
preferred to be called "Golden Nugget Gus." 
</P>
<P>
Although Gus' beard was a bit shaggy and unkempt, his overall appearance seemed 
to have played a bigger role in the judges' eyes. Gus strolled on stage wearing 
red long underwear, a floppy brown hat, a holster and a pair of cowboy boots. 
</P>
<P>
Gus said he prepared for the competition by drinking a few beers. 
</P>
<P>
"It helped to bring out my good, clean, salty nature," he said.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: PARALLEL BETWEEN HEDGECOCK AND AN EARLIER CONVICTED MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Parallel 
</P>
<P>
It is suggested that ex-Mayor Roger Hedgecock retains a grip on the public 
despite his criminal conviction and a reputation in some quarters as an 
unrepentant scoundrel. 
</P>
<P>
If so, it's all happened before. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego historian Henry Schwartz notes the parallels between Hedgecock and 
Billy Carlson, the "Boy Mayor" who served at City Hall from 1893 to 1897 and at 
the McNeil Island federal prison from 1918 to 1920. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz also sees a physical similarity: the lean face, the prominent Adam's 
apple, the glint in the eye. He's got a chapter on Carlson in his new book 
"Madam Ida &amp; Other Gaslamp Tales," which serves as my text. 
</P>
<P>
Like Hedgecock, Carlson was a precocious real estate investor. He bought 600 
acres at age 23 in 1887 and called it Ocean Beach. 
</P>
<P>
His vision frequently outpaced his finances. He gathered investors for a 
railroad from San Diego to Chicago; when the plan collapsed, there were nasty 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
He was attacked by the San Diego Union as "half fool, half fraud." The feud 
raged for years. 
</P>
<P>
He turned the paper's animosity to his advantage and was elected mayor at age 
29 with golden oratory and a glittery promise to make San Diego one of the 
world's great cities. He was popular and easily reelected to a second two-year 
term. 
</P>
<P>
Then he lost a race for Congress and founded the Consolidated Bank of Los 
Angeles. He sold lots in Imperial Valley, promising 25% annual appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
After a run, the bank was found to be what we now call a Ponzi scheme. Carlson 
was sent to prison and boldly asked President Wilson for a pardon. 
</P>
<P>
After his release, he again ventured into real estate, finding no shortage of 
investors. Later he was reduced to begging futilely for a city job during the 
Depression. 
</P>
<P>
The latter part of Carlson's saga, of course, is wholly different than 
Hedgecock. So is Schwartz's description of his temperament: 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't get his goat, as he never lost his temper. Billy was a hard man 
to despise." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Battle Over Wet T-Shirts 
</P>
<P>
Light and heat. 
</P>
<P>
* Homeowners at the Sea Point condominium project in La Costa are hopping mad 
at the developer and threatening a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
An owners' meeting called for a nearby community center was packed. So packed 
that the Fire Department shut it down, and the 200 owners had to caravan back 
to Sea Point to continue their angry discussion. 
</P>
<P>
After several hours a vote was taken about assessing each owner $1,000 to begin 
the legal fight. But the counting of secret ballots had to be halted midway, to 
much chagrin. 
</P>
<P>
It was 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
That's when the lights automatically shut off on the tennis court where the 
meeting was taking place. 
</P>
<P>
* The latest controversy to hit The Flame, the lively Hillcrest bar catering to 
homosexual women, is over its Wednesday night wet T-shirt contests. 
</P>
<P>
The Lesbian Therapists Assn., which uses the spelling "wimmin" to make a 
political statement, blasted the wet T-shirt idea in a letter to Bravo, a San 
Diego gay weekly: 
</P>
<P>
"These contests treat wimmin and their bodies as objects, pieces of meat to be 
ogled. They come from the worst part of male culture." 
</P>
<P>
Doug Snyder, manager of The Flame, says the contests are just clean fun on what 
is otherwise a slow night. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that sex sells," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswomen says the therapists' association is plotting its next move and 
not yet ready to go public. Some months ago the same group tried physically to 
bar men from The Flame. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What Price Circulation? 
</P>
<P>
Words, words, words. 
</P>
<P>
* More proof that reclusive novelist Thomas Pynchon is hiding out locally. 
</P>
<P>
A character in "Vineland" is described as "at large." A very disreputable 
character. 
</P>
<P>
* The North County Blade-Citizen has dropped its newsstand price to 10 cents, 
down from 25 cents. Competitors are unsure if the move is brilliant or 
foolhardy.

PUBLIC HEARINGS OPEN TODAY ON UTILITY MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's been 17 months since Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; 
Electric agreed to merge and create the nation's largest gas and electric 
utility with more than 4.8 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
The utilities and groups that oppose the $2.4-billion stock swap merger have 
deluged the state Public Utilities Commission, which must approve the proposed 
merger, with thousands of pages of technical testimony about the proposed deal. 
</P>
<P>
But today's 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. public hearings in San Diego mark the first time 
that the PUC has opened its ongoing review directly to Southern Californians, 
who each month send utility bills to the two companies. During coming weeks, 
the PUC will host 13 public hearings in cities that would be affected by the 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
The public hearings are being run in tandem with a lengthy series of 
evidentiary hearings, highly complex proceedings that are designed to help the 
PUC determine whether the merger will produce the long-term customer benefits 
claimed by the utilities. 
</P>
<P>
The utilities believe that the merger will produce $1.7 billion in savings 
during the 1990s. Company executives argue that the plan will reduce electric 
rates and improve service for customers of both companies. They also maintain 
that the merger will improve air quality in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents, however, seriously doubt that the merger will produce long-term 
benefits for Edison and SDG&amp;E customers. They have maintained that the 
merger will damage air quality in both Greater Los Angeles and San Diego 
County. And, they believe that creating the nation's largest gas and electric 
would end what little utility competition exists in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Among opponents to the merger are the PUC's Division of Ratepayer Advocates, a 
staff group that represents utility customers in PUC proceedings, and John Van 
de Kamp, the state attorney general. The merger also has drawn opposition from 
several municipally owned utilities in Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside 
counties that must use Edison's transmission lines to carry electric power into 
their service territories. 
</P>
<P>
The PUC isn't scheduled to make a final decision on the merger until late this 
year or early in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The utilities and their opponents will use the evidentiary proceedings to make 
their cases, but the public hearings that begin today in San Diego "are the 
only opportunity that the public will have to speak face-to-face with a 
commissioner," said Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumers 
Action Network, a San Diego-based consumer group. "The commissioners want to 
get a feeling for what San Diegans expect will happen if this merger occurs. 
They want to know why they are opposed to it or favor it." 
</P>
<P>
UCAN is one of several San Diego-based organizations, including the Sierra Club 
and the Chamber of Commerce, that oppose the merger. UCAN has joined forces 
with the San Diego-based Coalition for Local Control, an organization that 
includes representatives from civic, labor, business and citizen action groups. 
</P>
<P>
While commissioners will use the ongoing evidentiary proceedings to determine 
whether the merger will produce any benefits for ratepayers, they will use 
testimony gathered during the public hearings "to determine what the 'public 
interest' in this merger actually is," Shames said. 
</P>
<P>
That input will be important, he said, because the PUC needs to determine how 
to best serve the public interest. "Maybe rates wouldn't go down (after the 
merger) but service would be improved," Shames said. "Or, they might have to 
decide what to do if (the evidence suggests) that rates will go down slightly 
but service won't be improved. The public hearings will help them determine the 
public interest." 
</P>
<P>
Merger proponents and opponents tend to agree that San Diegans have the most at 
stake in the proposed merger, if only because it stands to lose SDG&amp;E, 
which is one of the county's few remaining large, publicly owned companies. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who has adamantly opposed the merger, has 
described the merger as the most important issue of her political career. The 
City of San Diego already has agreed to spend $2.5 million to oppose the merger 
in evidentiary proceedings both at the PUC and the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in Southern California, interest in the merger has been spotty. 
</P>
<P>
In Edison's service territory, "many people don't recognize the enormity of 
this proposal," said Sigrid Hawkes, an organizer for TURN, a Northern 
California-based consumer group that is expanding its membership in Southern 
California. "We're trying to educate people about the issue and get them to the 
public hearings. Many of them don't understand that this (hearing schedule) is 
their chance to say something." 
</P>
<P>
But interest has remained relatively strong in San Diego. Already, 246 San 
Diegans have written to the PUC's Public Advisor's Office expressing support or 
objection to the merger. About 40 San Diegans have expressed interest in going 
beyond merely attending the public hearings and becoming intervenors in the 
complex case. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a huge number for a utility proceeding," Shames said. "That's the 
largest number of people that I've ever heard of. It's an astounding number, a 
graphic example of how people are interested in this merger." 
</P>
<P>
Will anything new be heard during the hearings? 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is that, yes, something new will surface," Shames said. "It's been my 
experience that we get exposed to the 'popular wisdom' that eludes (utility 
industry observers)," Shames said. "I always learn a lot at public hearings." 
</P>
<P>
"It will be interesting," said Robert Hudson, executive director of the 
Coalition for Local Control. "And the PUC will listen. Remember the $4.80 
service charge that was repealed (after a public hearing in San Diego several 
years ago)? That's the most obvious example of . . . the PUC listening to the 
public." 
</P>
<P>
"This is the only chance for San Diegans to express themselves on this merger," 
Hudson said. "There's not going to be any binding vote (taken) on it." 
</P>
<P>
"The PUC runs an honest game," said Larry O'Donnell, founder of San Diegans for 
the Merger, a group that is funded in part by the utilities. "The hearings are 
designed so the . . . commissioners can have some feeling of what public 
sentiment is in the service territories, and we've asked our 2,000 members to 
make their views known." 
</P>
<P>
O'Donnell said his group today will give the PUC "tens of thousands" of names 
on petitions gathered in San Diego. The petitions urge the PUC to allow Edison 
to follow through with its promise of a 10% residential electric rate reduction 
if the merger is approved. Opponents have maintained that the PUC would not 
allow Edison to institute rate reductions in San Diego that weren't matched 
elsewhere in its vast service territory.

EARTH DAY 1990; 
</P>
<P>
OVER 50,000 PACK PARK AT EARTHFAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An eclectic alliance of earth's citizens -- from big business to Hare Krishnas, 
from new-age musicians and a British choral group to "cosmic comic" Timothy 
Leary, from 6,000 participants in a 5-K run to 800 children in a downtown 
parade -- celebrated Earth Day Sunday in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
EarthFair at Balboa Park attracted more than 50,000 persons -- if not tens of 
thousands more, organizers said, and if it was a celebration, it was also part 
swap meet -- with home-made jewelry and crafts being hawked, part zoo -- with 
traffic and parking headaches, and part trade-show, with private companies 
selling their services and wares to save the earth. 
</P>
<P>
In all, there were over 220 booths and stands where representatives of various 
organizations and businesses held forth. 
</P>
<P>
It was both high-tech -- with companies selling alternative energy and water 
conservation devices -- and deja vu original Earth Day 1970, right down to the 
tie-dye T-shirts and at least one booth warning young people to be wary of the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
And it was undisputably a success, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people said this couldn't be done, that we wouldn't be able to get 
this many people interested in Earth Day," said Carolyn Chase, director of San 
Diego Earth Day 1990 and whose husband, Chris Klein, served as production 
manager for the EarthFair. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted people to leave with a new experience, of how diverse people are who 
have to get along on this planet, that somehow we all have to share this 
planet. And I think we showed a mandate to our political leaders that yes, 
people will vote to solve our environmental problems," Chase said. 
</P>
<P>
The event involved the work of 400 volunteers and cost $40,000 to stage, and 
organizers hoped they would recoup that through T-shirt sales and fees paid by 
exhibitors, ranging from $35 from the most benign nonprofit group to $300 for 
the largest commercial business. 
</P>
<P>
Chase said organizers caught some flak from the strictest environmental groups 
because some businesses not perceived to be environmental champions shared the 
same exhibit areas as traditional and sometime militant environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
"But some of the people who cause the problems are going to have to be the ones 
who help solve them," she said. "So we wanted them here, too." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, dichotomy and irony were evident throughout, all in the name of Earth. 
</P>
<P>
A number of animal protection organizations shared the same sidewalk as the 
food vendor grilling up fresh hamburgers; San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. gave 
away 10,000 free pine trees -- all it had on hand -- by 1:20 p.m., while just 
50 feet way, UCAN (Utility Consumers Action Network) displayed an amended 
SDG&amp;E logo, "SD Gags on Edison." 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Herpetological Society set up a booth to promote the virtues of 
amphibians and snakes -- just a few feet removed from the America Rat, Mouse 
&amp; Hamster Society. But the rats, mice and hamsters were safe in their 
cages, and the only snake in evidence was an intimidatingly large boa that had 
wrapped itself around the neck of a bare-chested man who was strutting around 
the grounds as if he were Father Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Exhibit booths proclaimed, "Save our Ocean," "Save our Wilderness," "Save the 
Dolphin," "Save the Wolf," "Save the Children" and "Save the toner cartridge" 
-- a spiel by more than one exhibitor to recycle photocopier toner cartridges 
rather than buy new ones. 
</P>
<P>
"It's stupid to throw out five pounds of plastic when you can recharge the 
toner cartridge for your copier," said John Buzzard, handing out his brochures 
to passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, just about any business that could work an Earth angle seemed to have 
set up shop at Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
There was, for instance, Executive Images, a firm that consults executive women 
on their most flattering colors. "Earth tones aren't any more popular than the 
other colors," said a smartly-dressed woman in black and fuchsia. "What's 
important to our customers is that we don't use animals in our testing." 
</P>
<P>
Say what? 
</P>
<P>
A termite control company pitched that it doesn't use pesticides to kill the 
pesky bug. It freezes them. Hey, man, that's cool. 
</P>
<P>
Around one booth, half-a-dozen people sat quietly in folding chairs, eyes 
closed, as they received free therapy massage from assistants who held their 
shoulders, their heads, their chests, their necks and their backs. "Reiki 
Universal Life Energy," said the banner. People were signing up for their free 
massage. More people just stood and watched. 
</P>
<P>
A few booths over, Terrence C. Burns was selling portfolios featuring mutual 
bond investments in environmentally conscious companies. "You can talk all you 
want about the environment," he said, "But it's money that's going to make it 
happen. "A lot of money. A lot of investments. But maybe you can make some 
money, too." 
</P>
<P>
Sign up here. 
</P>
<P>
One exhibitor sold "hologram earth watches" and yes, some watch faces depicted 
globes. Others had a single, large eyeball, and others featured the classic 
peace symbol of the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
Vendors sold Dove Bars and Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream novelties -- some of 
them which, on Sunday, were renamed "Peace Pops." One food booth featured 
Cosmic Veggie Dogs and BBQ Earth Balls. 
</P>
<P>
There were Democratic Party and Republican Party booths, and one to help create 
a "Green Party" in California. 
</P>
<P>
One exhibit was for the "Project on Youth and non-military opportunities," 
which admonished young people to "check out the facts about military life . . . 
before you sign up." 
</P>
<P>
Save the earth by riding trolleys? Visit the booth staffed by the Citizen's 
Light Rail Committee. Insist on still driving your car? Visit the Bureau of 
Automotive Repair booth, a few feet away. 
</P>
<P>
Who were the single most interesting characters of the day? The couple dressed 
up as Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd? Or the three young men, naked except for 
some very short grass skirts? ("Fronds of the earth," Chris Klein quipped.) Was 
it the man wearing the gas mask and carrying the placard, "Ugly Smelly Air"? Or 
was it Captain Healthy, dressed in black leotards, black tights, gold lame cape 
and the black Zorro mask? (He was Maurice Luten, Smokey to his friends, 
drumming up some business for his weight control center.) 
</P>
<P>
At the Organ Pavilion, Robert Plimpton put the organ's pipes through their 
paces, playing pieces such as "Seventh Dance of Creation." "I didn't find any 
music inspired by smog," he said, "and I didn't find any music inspired by acid 
rain." 
</P>
<P>
Across the park, a 1960s folk group was singing "Sixteen Tons," their music 
amplified through speakers powered by solar-energized batteries. 
</P>
<P>
Next to the reflecting pool -- not far from the Toastmasters booth and the La 
Jolla Republicans booth, Cynthia Lynn Douglass produced celestial sounds on her 
Celtic harp. Donations appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
And bongo drums were everywhere. Dogs, too. Bongo drums and big dogs, meeting 
nose-to-nose, as friendly as could be like maybe this was Dog Day. 
</P>
<P>
A mounted San Diego police officer sat proud on his non-polluting horse, posing 
for pictures for kids visiting the park for the first time. "Stay clear of the 
rear," he advised them, as one youngster yanked on the horse's tail. A hundred 
yards away, a utility truck ran a mechanical snake through an overflowing 
sewage drain. "Too many people using the restrooms," a worker sighed. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, Earth Day at the park. 
</P>
<P>
There were performing cats taught to teeter on basketball-size globes, and 
face-painting opportunities, and a place you could paint the burlap or canvas 
bags you bought on the other side of the park ($16.95 plus tax, shipping and 
handling) so you wouldn't have to answer, "Paper or plastic?" 
</P>
<P>
T-shirt booths did brisk business. There was the souvenir edition, "Think 
Globally, Act Locally," that pitched Earth Day 1990 -- San Diego. Then there 
was the keepsake version for tourists: "Earth Day on the Bay," featuring a 
silhouette of tall sailing ship and of the Hotel del Coronado, to take back 
home to Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
Maureen Colt, 28, of El Cajon, bought 14 -- count 'em, 14 -- Earth Day T-shirts 
and sweat shirts. "This is something I want my children and nephews and nieces 
to remember," she said. "We all need to learn what we can do as individuals to 
help the earth. If every individual did just one thing, then as a whole we can 
contribute what we've learned to save the earth. And these T-shirts will be a 
reminder." 
</P>
<P>
Other souvenirs would come in the form of reborn commitments to be lived out. 
</P>
<P>
"I was raising my children during the first Earth Day," said 47-year-old Bonnie 
Brennan of Clairemont. "Now I find myself much more involved. Now I know that 
my own little world is global. I missed out 20 years ago, but now I know things 
I can do." Among them, she said, was to set up an ongoing Earth Day Committee 
at Sharp Memorial Hospital, where she is a nurse, to better recycle paper, cans 
and other material. "I don't want Earth Day to be a one-day celebration," she 
said. "I want it to go on from here." 
</P>
<P>
Matthew Kalnik, 27, of Mira Mesa, was cooling off from his 5-K run earlier in 
the day and reflected on what lessons he had learned. "I'm a lot more aware of 
how I've got to separate toxics, like paint cans and pesticide containers, from 
my garbage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Younger people -- including some not even born by the first Earth Day -- said 
they learned their lessons too. Nineteen-year-old Janae Green said she learned 
just how low San Diego's water supply is, and of how people waste it. 
</P>
<P>
There was some cynicism during the day, too. "I'm afraid a lot of this is going 
to wash off people in a few days," worried Tom Smith, 26, of Rancho Bernardo. 
Kody Peterson, 22, of La Jolla, griped: "A lot of companies are here, like 
they're big environmentalists, but all they are are hypocrites." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most affected by the day were Mike and Kathy Schearing -- who, nine 
months ago, made plans to get married at Balboa Park's Cafe del Rey Moro on 
April 22, and not realizing until last week that they'd be battling with 
EarthFair. 
</P>
<P>
"They only reason we could get the limo in here was because my sister knew the 
police officer," said the bride, resplendent in her white gown as thousands of 
casually dressed people walked by, gawking at the stretch limousine that maybe 
was carrying Mother Earth herself. "A bunch of our friends never got here for 
the reception. They didn't want to fight the traffic." 
</P>
<P>
Added the groom, "We'll never forget Earth Day. We sent out a few invitations 
and instead, we got the world."

Moorpark is considering raising the cost of renting Moorpark Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
Current rates range from $6 to $26, said Phil Newhouse, city director of 
community services. 
</P>
<P>
But he estimated that the actual cost of operating the larger of the two rooms 
the city rents is $70 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"It's being subsidized to a certain point -- we made a proposal to increase the 
fees to make it self-sustaining," Newhouse said. 
</P>
<P>
Newhouse said the city charges less than nearby cities, such as Thousand Oaks, 
Simi Valley and Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
A City Council committee is scheduled to advise the council May 16 on the 
issue. "I believe we should be trying to recoup the costs of the opening of the 
center," said Councilwoman Eloise Brown, a committee member. "If it's a 
community event, open to the whole community, that's a different story." KIM

<P>
SWEET ALICE HARRIS of Parents of Watts was asked by The Times to comment on 
breaking the cycle of child neglect and failure in the schools. Some of her 
views: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
I think we should be focusing on elementary education, because if you get a 
good background, if they have a good foundation, you wouldn't have the problems 
you have now. 
</P>
<P>
You have a problem in junior high and high school when you test a student and 
he tests as a third- and fourth-grade reader . . . 
</P>
<P>
I think the problem is everybody's, the community, the parents, the churches, 
the organizations, the schools. We all ought to focus on early childhood 
education. 
</P>
<P>
We (the Parents of Watts) have a school next door, and that comes from us doing 
this. In the afternoon we have tutors. We have young people coming here in the 
afternoon to do their homework. The teachers are from the the school district, 
from John Locke Adult School. 
</P>
<P>
The students that stay in the tutoring class are the ones that we have in 
college. We should have tutoring in the afternoon in the churches. Every church 
in the area should be open, with a teacher. The school district should send a 
teacher to help them get their homework, because if the parent in the home is 
on a fixed income, on welfare, on drugs, whatever the reason, it's not the 
child's fault. But that's who suffers, because then we say, 'Well, they have a 
parent, let them do it.' And because the parent doesn't do it, the child 
becomes neglected. And then when they get to be teen-agers, they can fight out 
against (the neglect), then we say, 'What's gonna happen to our teen-agers?' 
Because we didn't take care of them when they were in elementary school.

U.S. NEEDS SELF-SUFFICIENCY OF ITS TECHNOLOGICAL FABRIC; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: AMERICA IS FAST BECOMING A SECOND-RATE POWER, IMPORTING INDUSTRIAL 
GOODS AND SELLING ITS RESOURCES AND ASSETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Intel Corp.

<TEXT>
<P>
The great changes sweeping the East Bloc augur major cuts in U.S. defense 
spending. But before we rush to spend the peace dividend, we should rename the 
defense budget the "strategic security budget." This would help us think of it 
as the pot of money we use to defend ourselves against any external force that, 
left unchecked, would lead to the subjugation of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The forces likely to undermine our independence and security today are 
different from those of the past. The military danger is diminished, but the 
technological and economic threat has never been greater. How ironic it would 
be if the United States goes down in history as the country that succeeded in 
casting a protective military net over the Free World, only to lose its own 
economic freedom to the very nations it shielded. 
</P>
<P>
For those of us who earn our living fighting foreign competitors, it is 
painfully evident that the United States is losing its leadership in one 
industry after another. American companies must contend with an unusual trinity 
of forces. Our most ferocious foreign competitors are frequently subsidized and 
steered toward markets in which the U.S. edge is slipping. We face trade 
barriers that limit our penetration of foreign markets. Finally, we work with 
an Administration whose laissez-faire view of the world makes it ill-suited to 
cope effectively with the new realities of international trade. 
</P>
<P>
It is instructive to re-examine some of the changes that occurred in the 1980s. 
In the electronics industry, for example, there is trouble up and down the 
industry's food chain. In 1980, there were several American suppliers of the 
silicon wafers used to make chips. Today, there are none. Ten years ago, U.S. 
semiconductor manufacturers controlled 57% of the world semiconductor market. 
Today, their market share is 35%. 
</P>
<P>
Even more alarming is what's happening to our customers. In 1980, U.S.-based 
electronics companies consumed 42% of the world's semiconductors. The number 
today is 32%. There is practically no consumer electronics industry in this 
country. The computer industry, I'm afraid, is next to go. 
</P>
<P>
Projecting these and other trends onto the '90s, the United States emerges as a 
second-rate economic power importing most of its industrial goods and paying 
for them by selling its natural resources and dwindling corporate assets. That 
sounds a lot like the definition of a colony. It is difficult to imagine a 
military action by the Soviet Union, short of a nuclear strike, that could 
achieve a more damaging blow to the well-being of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
To reverse these trends, we should aim to make America technologically 
self-sufficient by the end of the decade. A first step would be for the 
President to acknowledge that the deterioration of our industrial fabric is a 
threat to our strategic security. This may seem trivial, but for the current 
Administration it would be a major step. 
</P>
<P>
We must also conceive of solutions that have measurable effects before the 
targeted problem becomes unmanageable. If we experience another decade like the 
'80s, it will be all over. So we can't rely on solutions that take longer than 
10 years to work. For example, one of the most frequently mentioned -- and 
certainly worthwhile -- cures for what ails industrial America is to improve 
our education system. The benefits, however, would not begin to be evident 
until the next century. 
</P>
<P>
Long before then, we need to inject funds into our industrial infrastructure to 
keep it alive and well. We need to make sure that companies like Intel, its 
U.S.-based suppliers and its customers will be around to employ the graduates 
of the improved education system. 
</P>
<P>
So let's declare technological self-sufficiency the top priority of our 
strategic security spending. Then let's redeploy our current "defense" spending 
to achieve it. And let's hope we're not too late.

CALIFORNIA'S MANY CLOGGED ARTERIES; 
</P>
<P>
PROPOSITION 111 WOULD HELP CLEAN UP TRAFFIC CONGESTION IN OUR COMMUNITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pity the morning commuter grinding his teeth at one of those cursed stretches 
where the Antelope Valley Freeway narrows from three lanes to two. And then he 
hears on the radio that the valley's population may soar from 150,000 now to 
half a million in 20 years. Gridlock hell. Only yesterday, it seems, Palmdale 
and Lancaster were hinterlands for a few aerospace workers and desert rats. 
</P>
<P>
But suddenly there is hope for the harassed freeway crawler. If California 
voters approve Proposition 111 on the June 5 primary ballot, the state will 
have for the first time a comprehensive program for managing and even reducing 
congestion. At the least, the program should absorb growth without allowing 
traffic to deteriorate. But if local governments carry out the planning process 
as they should, Proposition 111's landmark congestion-management element should 
lead to a smoother flow of cars and trucks on many streets and highways. 
</P>
<P>
The focus so far has been on the proposed doubling of the gasoline tax, raising 
$18.5 billion and getting the state's highway construction program rolling 
again. But Proposition 111 would do more. The unique congestion-management 
program would link transportation for the first time with land-use planning and 
environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
Passage of the ballot measure would require local governments to develop their 
own congestion-management plans before they could qualify for any of the $3 
billion in local assistance provided by Proposition 111. They could use the 
money for virtually any project as long as it reduced congestion, offset the 
traffic impact of new development and met air quality standards. 
</P>
<P>
In the Antelope Valley, housing contractors and local government would have to 
mitigate the effects of dumping additional commuters onto the Antelope Valley 
Freeway headed for jobs in San Fernando or even downtown Los Angeles. This 
could be done through creation of park-and-ride lots, van pools, financing of 
public transit systems and the like. Also, local projects that reduce 
congestion from present base-line levels would get top priority for further 
billions under Proposition 111. And cities no longer could lure tax-rich 
developments while dumping traffic headaches off on their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
For decades, local government has been seeking greater flexibility from the 
state in the spending of transportation dollars. Proposition 111 would provide 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 111 is not just another freeway program, but a sound strategy for 
giving California a truly comprehensive, workable transportation system.

</P>
<P>
Did he write these words 40 years ago, when communism was the enemy? No, he 
wrote them within the last year or so, to call for a remorseless struggle 
against drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Since Nixon knows a good deal about China, perhaps he remembers what "total war 
against drugs" meant in that country, after Chairman Mao took over in 1949. It 
meant that dope dealers were summarily executed. Users were hauled off to 
"re-education camps," where they faced the tender mercies of merciless cadres 
who were both militant and puritanical. It worked; China was made free of 
drugs. But it also was made free of a great many other valuable things, such as 
personal liberty. 
</P>
<P>
How, then, can we fight drugs? I don't know. I don't think anyone knows. It's 
not a problem like sending men to the moon, where if you do certain technical 
things correctly, you will succeed. But I do know that it is much easier to 
snuff out liberty in a country than to snuff out drug use. When Nixon condemns 
his adversaries for "intellectual arrogance," perhaps he should look in the 
mirror.

Nixon's analysis of our options for lasting strength and peace as the Cold War 
winds down was brilliant, if cold-hearted and realistic. It was the missing 
link in comprehending some of Gorbachev's real options. 
</P>
<P>
Thankfully, Nixon did not dredge up the inflammatory language of the Cold War 
that has forced the U.S. into inflexible strategies with peace as a peripheral 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, like the memory of the thief who picked Nixon's pocket in the Times Square 
celebration after World War II, the memory of a single phrase from his analysis 
nags at me. Nixon talked of Gorbachev's popularity being greater than that of 
our President in Europe and "among Americans with graduate degrees" -- a nice 
back-handed slap that gives us non-graduate-degree Americans someone to hate. 
</P>
<P>
You can always count on that from Dick Nixon. In the midst of his most 
brilliant evaluation of foreign realities, he will insert his gross insecurity 
and petty contempt like knives into his own country, which is crying for 
leadership that will unify its people. To this day, he doesn't understand that 
his biggest crime against this country was that he took the presidency -- one 
of the few unifying institutions we had left in America -- and squandered the 
investment of trust we had placed in it. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's why we need Nixon's voice on our Opinion pages, so we can lay 
aside our naivete and play tough-minded geopolitical hardball. But here in 
America, we're still waiting for someone who can heal our wounds.

Nixon (April 15) makes a mockery of the profound transformation inside the 
Kremlin, and his argument that Mikhail Gorbachev is willing to pay a 
"geopolitical price" (loss of Eastern Europe) to get Western technology is 
pathetic. Gorbachev countenanced the East Bloc upheaval not because it is a 
gritty price he has to pay, but because he respects truth -- something his 
predecessors smothered. 
</P>
<P>
This unprecedented grappling with truth has led directly to perestroika, a 
world vision that excludes class struggle, and yes, the crumbling of 
neighboring communism. 
</P>
<P>
There is no grand, cryptic strategy in Moscow -- only in Nixon's hawkish 
imagination. The reality is that Nixon is a blind, old man determined to save 
the Cold War which validated his existence in American politics. Who else could 
say, "Its (Soviet) leaders are committed to an ideology diametrically opposed 
to ours" when these leaders have instituted market reforms and laid the 
groundwork for political pluralism? Who else could carry on as the great 
spokesperson for democratic ideals while sporting a garish Watergate tattoo?

San Diego police were investigating the death of an unidentified teen-ager who 
witnesses say was pushed out of a moving vehicle Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, a Latina about 11 to 12 years old, was reportedly shoved out of a 
car traveling north on Interstate 5 near Old Town about 1:30 a.m., Deputy 
Coroner Jerry Hillbrand said. 
</P>
<P>
The girl, who was found alive by paramedics, died of her injuries at 2:07 a.m. 
near the roadside where she was found, Hillbrand said. 
</P>
<P>
She was described as 5 feet tall, 119 pounds, with black hair and brown eyes. 
She was wearing a gray and black, heavy wool sweater, jeans and white sandals.

<P>
A 23-year-old Michigan man was arrested on suspicion of driving a stolen 
vehicle after he lost control of a 1984 Chevrolet Corvette on California 52 
just east of Interstate 5, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Officer Jeffrey Newsome said the driver, identified as Robert L. Fischer, 
was spotted driving a suspected stolen vehicle by a San Diego police officer, 
who followed him east on 52 but was waiting for another officer to join him for 
a traffic stop. 
</P>
<P>
Fischer apparently saw that he was being followed and pulled onto the highway 
median to pass slower traffic in front of him, Newsome said. Fischer hit the 
center guardrail and pulled back into the fast lane, sideswiping a car, which 
in turn was pushed into another car, he said. 
</P>
<P>
All three vehicles spun out. Fischer received moderate injuries, and the driver 
and two occupants of the third car received lesser injuries. All four were 
taken to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, where Fischer was arrested on 
suspicion of driving a stolen vehicle and of evading arrest.

HAS OPPRESSION KILLED THE DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT? DESPITE SURFACE SIGNS OF ITS 
DEMISE, IT IS ALIVE AND STRONG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTE BAO LORD, Bette Bao Lord's latest book, Legacies, A Chinese Mosaic has 
just been published by Alfred A. Knopf. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Foreigners, whose unenviable task it is to fathom China, are reduced to 
studying what they see and hear, without means to gauge the true feelings of 
the people, who even on the sunniest days resort to rituals and masks. 
</P>
<P>
And nowadays, the skies over Beijing are dark indeed. The square is empty. The 
voices are silenced. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 outpourings of citizens in the Communist world occurred first in Tian 
An Men Square, then spread, toppling one dominion after another, reaching 
toward the heart of the Soviet Union, stirring even Mongolia. Similar forces 
were at work: Communism's endemic failure to meet either material or spiritual 
needs; wanton corruption; economic woes; the devastating contrasts with lives 
in the Free World; a stultifying atmosphere where the party, right and wrong, 
knows best. 
</P>
<P>
Why, then, has China remained a country apart? 
</P>
<P>
For Confucian ages, Chinese were taught to kowtow publicly to elders and 
authority, however unreasonable. For Maoist decades, individuals had to submit 
meekly to the will of the party or they and their clansmen suffered dire 
reprisals. Throughout the vast, populous and poor land, harmony was exalted 
above equity. Thus the students sought to work within the system, petitioning 
for dialogue and respect as patriots. Also, unlike their foreign counterparts, 
the spontaneous Chinese demonstrators lacked experience, organization, unified 
tactics or popular leaders like Lech Walesa or Vaclav Havel. 
</P>
<P>
Why then did the demands of the Chinese students -- infinitely more modest than 
the radical ones of East Europeans -- elicit such a brutal response? 
</P>
<P>
Not as well-educated or informed as Mikhail S. Gorbachev and others, China's 
first-generation rulers were Long Marchers whose political instincts were akin 
to those of Mao and Stalin. They played on traditional Chinese fears of chaos. 
They painted hunger strikers, who harmed only their own health, with the 
terrifying images of youthful Red Guards who overturned heaven and earth during 
the Cultural Revolution. They called in extensive debts of personal loyalty 
owed by a legion of underlings. They drew on credits earned through a decade of 
bold economic reforms and relative openness. 
</P>
<P>
As the demonstrations persisted and amassed broad support, Party Secretary Zhao 
Ziyang, as well as others in high places, urged moderation. Some key generals 
petitioned for nonviolence. But the feudal patriarchs, fearing even modest 
gestures would thrust them on a slippery slide out of power, ordered the 
People's Army to shoot at its own people. Blinded by pride and ignorance, they 
underestimated reactions at home and abroad to the indelible image of one lone 
man braving tanks. 
</P>
<P>
This mistake only intensified their paranoia. Ever since, they have reverted to 
Maoist tactics that can only destroy the road to modernization they themselves 
had so arduously paved. 
</P>
<P>
Has oppression killed the democracy movement? 
</P>
<P>
Despite surface signs of its demise, it is alive and strong. The Chinese people 
recognize the Big Lie and know that the bloody climax last spring was hardly 
inevitable. It took Deng Xiaoping seven weeks to marshal sufficient consensus 
to unleash the soldiers. Splits that opened in the political and military ranks 
then are widening still. Many party and provincial officials defy or dilute 
directives from the Politburo. Many in the army are shamed by its inglorious 
role and resent elevating politics over professionalism. The regime, clearly 
uncertain about the loyalties of even the police, recently replaced their top 
leaders. An underground that protects political fugitives and allows them to 
flee can only exist with the connivance of authorities and popular support. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring's demonstrations, the largest in China's history, broke out in 
virtually every major city in the nation. Students led, but intellectuals, 
workers, entrepreneurs, ordinary citizens, government and party officials 
followed. The myriad economic pressures that fueled discontent multiply as 
austerity measures have smothered growth and spread unemployment, raising the 
specter of larger numbers of workers joining the ranks of the disaffected. Much 
of the opposition, once willing to settle for gradual change, has been 
radicalized. 
</P>
<P>
Though China appears tranquil today, it is seething with anger, cynicism and 
passive resistance. People lie in wait. They know that octogenarian patriarchs 
must soon leave the stage. They ask: If the legendary Mao failed to anoint a 
successor, how could lesser men succeed? No longer do Chinese regard their 
leaders as the keepers of an unerring faith, but as wardens of temporal powers 
shorn of ideals. Even the despicable Gang of Four in 1976 only sprayed water, 
not bullets, at Tian An Men crowds wishing them ill. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, while public obeisance continues, it is forced and does not reflect 
legitimacy. The elders know this, too. So they have forbidden citizens to 
stroll in the square, have even outlawed black armbands and white flowers to 
commemorate the dead, any dead, on the day marked by the ancients for mourning. 
</P>
<P>
But anniversaries abound. And derisive laughter is more infectious than tears. 
A leadership that fears above all its own people cannot last. 
</P>
<P>
In this era, sooner or later, through takeover by reformers at the top or new 
demonstrations from below or both, the global winds of change that first gusted 
in China will return ever stronger to Tian An Men Square.

TILL '92, JAPAN CAN SAY YES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENICHI TAKEMURA, Kenichi Takemura is the author of The Law of History: Why 
Japan Should Say Yes. This article is excerpted from Sankei Shimbun. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japan has not simply traded places with the Soviet Union as Enemy No. 1. It has 
also bruised U.S. pride. Americans think Japan knocked them off the top rung of 
the economic ladder. 
</P>
<P>
The media in both countries are having a field day reporting the salvos of 
contentious statements and accusations crisscrossing the Pacific. Author 
Shintaro Ishihara is right when he argues that trade friction between the two 
countries is Americans' fault and that they should put their own house in order 
before criticizing Japan. I understand Ishihara's indignation. 
</P>
<P>
But Japan should be conciliatory, at least through the 1992 presidential 
election in the United States, when George Bush might encounter pressure to 
become a Tokyo-basher. 
</P>
<P>
Postwar Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida was right when he said, "Japan prospered 
as long as it worked hand-in-hand with the Anglo-Saxons." It is in Japan's best 
interests to remain friendly with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Some Japanese will say this is weak-kneed diplomacy and kowtowing to foreign 
pressure, an unpopular position in Japan. Historically, the Japanese have been 
hard on yes-men who seemed soft on other countries. 
</P>
<P>
But concession and compromise are essential for Japan's prosperity into the 
21st Century. We must remove structural impediments to trade, give Americans 
less reason to complain and wait patiently for the storm to blow over.

<P>
On the eve of Sunday's sixth La Jolla Grand Prix cycling races, Chris Huber was 
concerned not with winning but with whether he would be able to ride at all. 
</P>
<P>
Huber, a 28-year-old member of the Coors Light team from Campbell, could barely 
walk Friday. 
</P>
<P>
How could Huber have pondered sprinting away from the pack of 125 with two laps 
left, opening a lead of about six seconds and holding on to win the 40-mile, 
66-lap men's race? But that's exactly what he did. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't even lift my right leg Friday," Huber said. 
</P>
<P>
Huber said he thought he pulled a muscle when he turned up lame. But when 
volunteer chiropractors assisting the racers examined him, they discovered he 
was suffering from a muscle spasm in his abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
Huber didn't come into the race as his team's hottest cyclist. Teammates 
Michael Zanoli and Roberto Gaggioli finished first and second in a Tempe, 
Ariz., criterium the previous week. Huber wasn't a factor in that race. He had 
the flu. 
</P>
<P>
But when the 63rd lap of the men's pro/am rolled around Sunday, Huber, who had 
led only three times before, found an unusual lull in an otherwise blistering 
pace and three teammates trying to help set him up for a breakaway. Huber's leg 
felt fine, he felt strong, and he sensed it was time to make a sprint for the 
finish with 1.2 miles to go. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times (the pace slows) when teams are organizing themselves (to 
spring one racer for a dash to the finish)," Huber said. "My team was in 
perfect position, and it was a perfect setup for me." 
</P>
<P>
Huber made his move on the first turn, and by the end of the lap led by what 
looked to be 50 yards. He held on to beat Gaggioli, who closed the gap to 
finish second. Huber earned $3,000, Gaggioli $2,000. Jonas Carney of the 
Subaru/Montgomery team finished third and claimed $1,000 from the $20,000 
purse. 
</P>
<P>
Encinitas' Marianne Berglund won the 20-mile, 33-lap women's race for the third 
consecutive year and the fourth time in five years, winning $1,250. Berglund, 
who has become a crowd favorite, called this victory her most challenging 
because she raced without a team. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're by yourself, you have to be up there (with the leaders) and cover 
everything," she said. "I trained really hard and peaked for this race. I had 
the most wonderful support." 
</P>
<P>
Reno's Inga Thompson, the only other woman to win this race in the past five 
years, was riding fifth, two places behind Berglund, with two laps to go but 
fell in a mysterious pileup on Lap 32. Her Michelin racing team had Marion 
Clignet and Jessica Grieco running first and second with a lap to go, but 
Clignet was also lost in the crash, leaving only Grieco to contend with 
Berglund. 
</P>
<P>
"I was racing to win," said Thompson, whose entire left side was scraped. "I 
actually thought I had it won, and I went into the turn accelerating. . . . I'm 
still trying to find out how I went down." 
</P>
<P>
Berglund bolted past Grieco at the finish. Linda Brenneman finished third. 
</P>
<P>
In the five-lap wheelchair criterium, Jim Knaub defeated Craig Blanchette by a 
chair length and won a total of $2,550.

POPE SUMMONS ALL OF EUROPE'S BISHOPS TO SYNOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sounding a call for continental unity, Pope John Paul II on Sunday summoned an 
unprecedented all-European congress of Roman Catholic bishops to chart common 
action made possible by the collapse of communism. 
</P>
<P>
"Never in the history of the church has there been such a continental meeting. 
To my mind, the agenda will be huge," papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro said. 
</P>
<P>
The public papal summons for a synod of bishops from two dozen European 
countries came after a Mass here before an onion-domed 17th-Century basilica 
that is a Czechoslovakian national landmark. 
</P>
<P>
For the second day Sunday, John Paul drew gigantic crowds for outdoor Masses in 
a country where a peaceful revolution last winter ended four decades of 
Communist rule -- and with it, the repression of religion. The Vatican says 
that at least half of Czechoslovakia's 15 million people are Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
Even after 40 muzzled years, everybody in the giant crowd here, old and young 
alike, knew the words to ancient and bittersweet hymns that echoed through the 
rain-soaked countryside Sunday in John Paul's wake. 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of worshipers, many in local dress harking back to the Middle 
Ages and all waving yellow and white paper roses, defied glowering skies and 
fresh mud for the Mass here, which also drew Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki 
from neighboring Poland. 
</P>
<P>
At an afternoon Mass in the Slovakian capital of Bratislava, John Paul's last 
appearance before returning Sunday night to Rome, the turnout was even bigger. 
Local sources estimated the crowd at about 400,000. 
</P>
<P>
Citing Europe's "vital transformations," John Paul said he is summoning the 
synod to give his bishops "the opportunity to reflect more attentively on the 
importance of this historic moment for Europe and the church." 
</P>
<P>
The synod could be expected to address issues ranging from the church's role in 
German unification to social concerns such as migration and the problems of 
ethnic minorities, Navarro said. About 1,000 of the world's 3,000 Catholic 
bishops are in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Where and when they will meet is still to be determined, although in his 
announcement, which came as news to European clerics, John Paul called for a 
meeting "in the not-too-distant future." 
</P>
<P>
Synods, as papal-initiated deliberative meetings of Catholic prelates are 
called, are held regularly on an international level to discuss normal matters 
of concern to the church. Each country also has a conference of bishops to air 
national concerns, but never have the bishops of one continent met, although an 
African synod is slowly being organized. 
</P>
<P>
"Europe is unique because it is a continent with a shared Christian heritage," 
Navarro said. "Since 1981, the Holy Father has been talking about a common 
European home from the Urals to the Atlantic. Now events make it possible to 
put his idea into practice." 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Europe's new breed of democrats count the Pope as a valuable ally whose 
support for human rights aided their suddenly successful struggle against 
long-lived Communist governments. 
</P>
<P>
His satisfaction with the rise of democratic governments and a conviction that 
a new Europe could consolidate its gains in unity emerged as the principal 
themes of John Paul's triumphant Czechoslovak visit, made at the invitation of 
political dissident-turned-President Vaclav Havel. 
</P>
<P>
At his farewell in Bratislava on Sunday, John Paul spoke about all of the 
nations of Europe, saying: "After the upheavals of two wars which prostrated 
them materially and morally, after a period of 40 years during which an 
erroneous ideology forced them into separate and hostile blocs, now a new 
historical course makes them feel a nostalgia for agreement and understanding, 
with respect for the legitimate aspirations of each one of them. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my hope that, overcoming all difficulties, the peoples of Europe will 
unite their efforts in order to strengthen mutual solidarity, effective 
cooperation and true peace in freedom and justice." 
</P>

LITHUANIA RETALIATES, HALTS GAS SUPPLY TO SOVIET BASES 
</P>

VILNIUS, Soviet Union 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lithuanian government, in a rebellious tit-for-tat gesture, announced 
Sunday that it is ending all gasoline supplies to Soviet military bases in the 
republic and blocking the international export of goods produced by Soviet-run 
factories in Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
Officials also said they are eliminating some local bus and streetcar routes to 
conserve gasoline, and the republic's president appealed to citizens to 
demonstrate their fortitude as the Kremlin seeks to isolate them economically. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government sent a high-level delegation to Moscow to seek 
a political solution with Soviet leaders. However, the delegation, headed by 
Lithuanian Vice President Bronius Kuzmickas, did not have an appointment with 
any Soviet official when it left Vilnius on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
"The pressure is growing for all the people of Lithuania," President Vytautas 
Landsbergis said on Lithuanian television. "Sometimes you cannot believe that 
big Russia can do such things to little Lithuania. Lithuania hasn't committed 
any crime against the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he urged the Lithuanian people to persevere. "You must try to 
stand the economic blockade as long as you can. Time will show that our people 
can survive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In response to Moscow's decision to dry up gasoline pipes running into the 
republic, Lithuanian leaders said they were eliminating all gasoline supplies 
that go to Soviet military bases in the republic. It is expected, however, that 
those bases will continue to receive gasoline from Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
In another step likely to anger Moscow, officials blocked the export by sea to 
other countries of goods produced by Lithuanian factories that are run by the 
Soviet Union. The Lithuanian leaders argued that they did not want any of the 
foreign currency earned from those products to go to the Soviet government. 
</P>
<P>
And in a telegram sent to Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, the 
Lithuanian government said it has been forced by the blockade of some raw 
materials to stop exporting to the Soviet Union a number of items produced in 
the republic, including electric motors, television receivers and textiles. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union began late Wednesday to impose economic sanctions against the 
republic. Moscow confirmed it has cut off all oil supplies and about 84% of 
natural gas supplies. Lithuanian leaders further charge that other goods are 
being blocked, ranging from wood and metals to fish and sugar. 
</P>
<P>
That was denied Sunday by Andrei Girenko, a secretary in the Communist Party 
Central Committee. Girenko, in Vilnius to attend a meeting of the pro-Moscow 
faction of the Lithuanian Communist Party, told a news conference that although 
Moscow has cut oil and gas supplies to Lithuania, other goods are still flowing 
to the republic. 
</P>
<P>
"Plans for a total economic blockade do not exist," Girenko said. "The measures 
which are being undertaken in accordance with the decisions of the president 
(Mikhail S. Gorbachev) can in no way be considered as a blockade of Lithuania. 
They cover only a small part of the production that was supplied and continues 
to be supplied to Lithuania." 
</P>
<P>
The economic sanctions began after Lithuania defied an ultimatum from 
Gorbachev, who gave them an Easter weekend deadline to rescind legislation 
bolstering their unprecedented March 11 declaration of independence from the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian leadership has offered to negotiate the legislation and all 
other issues except the sovereignty declaration itself. But that has not 
satisfied Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Girenko, the highest-ranking Soviet official to visit Lithuania since the 
independence declaration, also said he will not meet with members of the 
Lithuanian government during his stay in the republic. He repeated Moscow's 
insistence that Lithuania first withdraw what the Soviets consider to be an 
unconstitutional sovereignty declaration. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that in the end, good sense will prevail," Girenko said. "There are 
forces in the republic that understand what could happen and what a catastrophe 
it could lead to." 
</P>
<P>
A participant in the congress of the pro-Moscow faction of the Lithuanian 
Communist Party attended by Girenko, meanwhile, complained in an interview with 
the daily Sovietskaya Rossiya that his homeland has become "captive to a 
nationalistic euphoria." 
</P>
<P>
Reactionary nationalists, said Mykolas Burokyanvichus, are "leading Soviet 
Lithuania to a political dead end and the people to tragedy." His viewpoint, 
however, is mirrored by only about 10% of the republic's population, according 
to a recent poll. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuanian officials have warned that the republic cannot survive for long 
under an economic blockade. 
</P>
<P>

journalist, from Vilnius.

FOR FAMILIES, JUBILATION AND FRUSTRATION

It was the moment Ruth Polhill had waited on, prayed for, dreamed about since 
that terrible day in 1987 when her son was taken hostage by Islamic terrorists. 
But when it finally came Sunday, she was not quite sure she could trust her 
senses. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't believe it. I couldn't believe it. I had to see it," she said from 
her apartment in Fishkill, N.Y., shortly after watching television broadcasts 
of hostage Robert Polhill's emancipation after more than three years of 
captivity in Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
The elderly widow's jubilation at her son's release was shared by other 
relatives as well as countless supporters and sympathizers, including the 
families of fellow hostages Jesse (Jon) Turner and Alann Steen. 
</P>
<P>
But all three families also shared disappointment and frustration over the 
realization that Turner, Steen and five other American hostages in Lebanon will 
remain in captivity with no assurance of eventual release. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last three years, the families have grown close, speaking to each 
other regularly by telephone. When Turner's Lebanese wife, Badr, gave birth to 
a daughter several months after his capture, he was not able to share the 
event, but she sent videotapes of the child to the families of the other 
hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Polhill, Turner, Steen and Mithileshwar Singh were abducted at gunpoint from 
the campus of Beirut University College on Jan. 24, 1987. Singh was released in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Until Polhill's actual release, it was not clear which of the three would be 
set free. Many people -- including Ruth Polhill -- initially speculated that it 
would be Turner, because the kidnapers had released his picture last Wednesday 
when they announced they would be setting one of their prisoners free. 
</P>
<P>
When Ruth Polhill saw that it instead was her son, "I was speechless," she said 
in a telephone interview Sunday afternoon, her voice weary but patient. "It was 
like a numb sensation, just seeing it and wondering if I was dreaming." 
</P>
<P>
As soon as she convinced herself it was for real, she began worrying about her 
son's health. Polhill, a diabetic who requires daily injections of insulin, 
appeared drawn and pale in a televised interview recorded as he was being 
transported by car from Lebanon to Syria and in a later press conference in 
Damascus. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked so different to me. Thin, and he talked so slowly. I just wondered 
how well he was," she said. "But he's out, and he's got spirit in him, I know 
that." 
</P>
<P>
She said she had not yet spoken with her son but received a call from President 
Bush, one of many people who called to congratulate her. She said she will not 
be able to travel overseas and planned instead to greet him in Washington upon 
his return. 
</P>
<P>
Polhill's Lebanese wife, Firyal, traveled to Damascus last week in case her 
husband was released by his captors, members of a radical group known as the 
Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
His two sons from his first marriage, Brian and Stephen Polhill, who share an 
apartment in Queens, N.Y., will travel to West Germany soon to be reunited with 
him, Ruth Polhill said. 
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by United Press International, Stephen, 26, said Sunday: "It's not 
a feeling I can describe, I'm very elated. I'm a little concerned for the 
families of Jesse Turner and Alann Steen." 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Polhill said that his father "looked a lot better than I would have 
ever imagined. We've seen pictures over the last few years; they've looked very 
bad. It looks like he needs a well-cooked meal." 
</P>
<P>
UPI reported that Brian Polhill, 23, was equally jubilant. "I got a piece of 
pizza in one hand and a glass of champagne in the other," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After learning that her son had been released, Ruth Polhill celebrated in her 
apartment with a few family members and friends. She gave an interview through 
the window of her apartment to half a dozen reporters who had waited outside 
and talked to dozens more over the constantly ringing telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout her son's captivity, Ruth Polhill said she has been concerned about 
the state of his health and his access to insulin. No family members have had 
any contact with him since his abduction, she said, and they had no way to 
determine how he was bearing up. "I thought with all of the bombs bursting . . 
. there could be a slip-up with getting his insulin to him," she said. "He had 
to get that insulin every day." 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Polhill, who last saw her son during the Christmas holidays in 1985, said 
she has been told by State Department officials that he will be kept under 
observation for some time to ensure that he is in good health. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that after a week or two in the hospital, he'll be back to, maybe not 
normal health, but he'll be himself again," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For the families of the two hostages left behind, it was a fateful decision. 
</P>
<P>
In Boise, Ida., as the news trickled in over television that it was Polhill 
that had been released, Turner's mother, Estelle Ronneburg, struggled to 
maintain her composure. 
</P>
<P>
"It can't help but hurt a little bit, because I had hopes that it would be 
Jon," Ronneburg, 68, said softly. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy for Mrs. Polhill because I know she's been very worried about him 
because of his diabetes. I hope maybe they'll release another hostage." 
</P>
<P>
Ronneburg, surrounded in her small living room by reporters and television 
cameras, watched solemnly as the first interview with Polhill came across the 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
When reporters asked if she would prefer that they leave and allow her to be 
alone, she replied: "No. I need people around me. I'm kind of numb right now." 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Ronneburg said the news that his stepson, Turner, had not been released 
actually did not come as a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"We really didn't believe it would be Jon," he said. "We both knew down really 
deep that it would be an older one. It isn't something we haven't thought about 
or realized. So we're really happy for her (Polhill's mother). Estelle and I 
learned long ago not to get too excited." 
</P>
<P>
In the days preceding the release, Estelle Ronneburg, a bank accounting clerk, 
had said repeatedly that she was trying to hold her emotions in check. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been down this road before," she said, alluding to the 1988 release of 
Singh and the numerous false reports that her son was about to be freed. "It's 
difficult to come back from that kind of letdown." 
</P>
<P>
Ronneburg said she remains optimistic. "I know I'm going to get him back," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In Clark Lake, Mich., Virginia Steen spoke to reporters in front of her 
parents' small, lake-front home. Sunday was her husband's 55th birthday, but it 
was a difficult one to celebrate.

<P>
"It's wonderful," Virginia Steen said of Polhill's release. "I hope he'll bring 
news of Alann, and I hope that this will be the first of others to be 
released." 
</P>
<P>
She said she wants to speak with Polhill to find out as much as she can about 
her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to talk to Robert after he gets his strength up," she said. "I hope to 
talk to him since they were all held together."

SOVIETS MARK $26 BILLION FOR CHERNOBYL AID 
</P>

<P>
The Soviet government, allocating $26 billion in additional funds to help the 
victims of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster four years ago, acknowledged on 
Sunday that thousands upon thousands of people are still living in areas 
dangerously contaminated by radioactive fallout, and even more are eating food 
grown in those areas. 
</P>
<P>
Acting amid mounting criticism that it was doing too little too late and thus 
compounding the Chernobyl tragedy, the Soviet Council of Ministers approved an 
emergency program focused on protecting the safety and health of those in the 
affected areas, as many as 3 million to 4 million people, the official news 
agency Tass reported. 
</P>
<P>
The new program provides for the urgent resettlement of some of those living in 
contaminated areas, improved medical care for those suffering from radiation 
illnesses, provision of "clean" food to replace that still being grown in the 
radiation zone and greater welfare benefits to the Chernobyl victims, 
particularly children and the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, which was approved by the Council of Ministers over the 
weekend and is scheduled to be submitted this week to the Supreme Soviet, the 
country's legislature, a major effort will be made to improve medical services 
throughout the affected area and combine them with advanced research on the 
treatment of radiation sickness. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100,000 people have been resettled as a result of the radiation and the 
fallout from the April 26, 1986, explosion. However, many more still live in 
the contaminated areas, including 118 villages where radiation levels are eight 
times or more greater than the level defined as acceptable by the Soviet 
government and some so dangerous that livestock, trees and plants have been 
grossly deformed. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to growing criticism here over its estimation -- now regarded as 
shockingly low -- of the danger posed by Chernobyl, the world's worst nuclear 
disaster, the government has also ordered that a comprehensive set of plans be 
drawn up by Soviet and foreign specialists for dealing with the accident's 
aftermath. The areas include the Ukraine, Byelorussia and neighboring parts of 
the Russian republic, according to Tass. 
</P>
<P>
Although larger than anything the government has undertaken since the rescue 
and cleanup operation that immediately followed the disaster, the new program 
falls far short of what Soviet environmentalists believe is required. 
</P>
<P>
As if to underscore that point, tens of thousands of Ukrainians marched through 
the republic's capital of Kiev on Sunday demanding greater efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Speakers at a closing rally called for Ukrainian officials to be put on trial, 
including Valentina Shevchenko, now the republic's president and its deputy 
premier four years ago, for failing to tell people of the danger and for 
failing to take broader emergency actions that both Soviet and foreign 
radiation specialists are said to have recommended. 
</P>
<P>
But the march and rally, which drew an estimated 50,000 to 70,000 people, 
quickly became an expression of resurgent Ukrainian nationalism. Protesters 
demanded independence for the republic, chanting "Down with Bolshevism!" and 
"Down with Leninism!" and singing the anthem of the Ukrainian forces, which 
were defeated by the Bolsheviks in 1920 in the wake of the Russian Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Further demonstrations are planned for Thursday, the fourth anniversary of the 
Chernobyl accident, and a nationally televised charity appeal is planned for 
the day to raise funds for its victims. 
</P>
<P>
Concern is growing here that the contamination from Chernobyl is spreading -- 
with radioactive particles of metal, of dirt, of debris carried by wind, 
through the region's rivers and lakes, even through the food chain. 
</P>
<P>
"Radiation struck everything -- food, water, the forests," Alexander Yablokov, 
a deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet's ecology commission, said after 
hearings last week on the aftermath of Chernobyl. 
</P>
<P>
Winds spread the radioactive dust, as did forest fires, he added. Migrating 
birds and wildlife carried the radiation and radiation-generated diseases even 
farther. 
</P>
<P>
The government's maps of the fallout areas, showing concentrations of strontium 
90 and cesium 137, proved inaccurate, Yablokov said, but the real problem was 
simply that each element had the rather long half-life, or period of decay, of 
about 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Yuri Shcherbak, another vice chairman of the Supreme Soviet's environmental 
commission, estimated earlier this month that more than 4 million people still 
live in dangerously contaminated areas and that a 10-year program of medical 
care for them, rehabilitation of the environment and further decontamination 
would cost a total of $320 billion. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 children are also believed to be living in seriously affected 
areas, according to medical officials, and their fate is an increasing worry 
for the central government, which fears for the future of the Soviet Union as a 
Slavic nation. In March, 51 Ukrainian children were sent to Israel for 
treatment of radiation sickness, and more are scheduled to go as part of the 
new campaign to focus on the children affected by the fallout. 
</P>
<P>
But the number of people affected is far greater than originally estimated, and 
that worries officials attempting to cope with the aftermath and ecologists who 
fear even greater damage to the environmental system than now seen. 
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, 31 people died as a result of an explosion and 
fire at the Chernobyl Atomic Energy Station in the Ukraine in the first few 
hours after the blast. But some Soviet officials have suggested that the number 
of dead is now more than 250, though this estimate has not been verified by 
pathologists. 
</P>
<P>
In Byelorussia, an estimated 118,000 more people must be evacuated from 
contaminated areas, according to governmental officials there, and 17,000 
should be moved immediately. Only 25,000 people have been resettled since the 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Lev Maksimov, the ambassador of the Byelorussian republic to the United 
Nations, said earlier this month that $28 billion is needed urgently to help an 
estimated 2.2 million people in Byelorussia who were directly affected by 
Chernobyl's fallout. The Ukrainian government, in a similar appeal for 
international assistance, said that 1,614 settlements on its territory should 
be evacuated and the residents resettled because of the large concentrations of 
radionuclides that have been found in the soil. 
</P>
<P>
According to Shcherbak of the environmental commission, an estimated 1.5 
million people, including 160,000 children, received large doses of radon 
likely to affect their thyroid glands. Also, there was a sharp increase in 
cases of fibrosis, bloated thyroids, cancer of the thyroid and leukemia. And an 
immunity deficiency similar to AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) has 
been found in recent months.

NEW ENVIRONMENT: When President Bush chose him to head the Environmental 
Protection Agency, William K. Reilly was considered a nonpartisan, patrician 
defender of the earth and all its creatures. Conservatives viewed him 
suspiciously. 
</P>
<P>
No more. Now Reilly is giving sharply partisan stump speeches, winning cheers 
from audiences, such as the recent Southern Republican Leadership Conference in 
Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic criticisms, Reilly thundered, are "the actions of a party that 
doesn't expect to be back in power anytime soon." Bush, he said, is "taking 
back the issue of the environment and he's driving some Democrats crazy." 
</P>
<P>
QUORUM CALL: Congress can't seem to act on the Administration's $300-million 
aid request to help Nicaragua's spring planting. But it's sending the next best 
thing -- lots of congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
When Violetta Chamorro is inaugurated Tuesday as Nicaragua's new President, at 
least 25 members of Congress, a half-dozen sub-Cabinet members and dozens of 
other officials will fly down from Washington, all led by Vice President Dan 
Quayle. "The limiting factor turned out to be how many people we could fit on 
Quayle's plane," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a certain irony" in the failure to pass the aid, a State Department 
official noted. "Of course, we are confident that Congress will do the right 
thing . . . eventually, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
BETTER READ THAN RED? Rita Klimova, ambassador of the newly democratic 
Czechoslovakian government, sends out letters on old embassy letterhead 
emblazoned: "The Ambassador of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic" -- with the 
word "Socialist" crossed out by hand. 
</P>
<P>
YEN TO TRAVEL: President Bush's incessant travels are causing some changes in 
the White House press corps. With Bush traveling about one day in three, 
newspapers with only one White House correspondent are having trouble keeping 
up. Moreover, as the newspaper industry struggles with sharp declines in 
advertising revenue, many have decided full-time coverage of the President is 
simply too expensive. Besides, many of Bush's trips simply do not produce any 
news. 
</P>
<P>
The net result: roughly a 30% decline in the number of reporters following Bush 
over the last year. But as American reporters drop off the presidential press 
plane, some are being replaced by correspondents for Japanese papers: At least 
three now cover Bush full time. 
</P>
<P>
DELUGE: Unhappy with some details of a new Democratic spending blueprint during 
a House Budget Committee hearing, Rep. Jack Buechner (R-Mo.) sought to drive 
home his point by recalling the biblical story of Noah's Ark, in which all the 
animals went aboard Noah's vessel two-by-two, including a pair of skunks. 
</P>
<P>
"There may be a couple of skunks in this ark," Buechner declared, "but our job 
is to get it to float. You guys got your way of launching the ark, and we got 
ours, but the important thing is that the ship of state remain afloat."

BUSH CALLS RELEASE OF 1 A 'MISSION UNCOMPLETED'; 
</P>
<P>
HOSTAGES: HE THANKS SYRIA AND IRAN FOR THEIR ROLE IN FREEING POLHILL. BUT HE 
SAYS HE CAN'T FORGIVE THE CAPTORS TILL ALL AMERICANS ARE FREED.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush praised the role of Syria and Iran in gaining the release of 
Robert Polhill from his Lebanese captors on Sunday, but he called for the 
"immediate and unconditional release" of the remaining American and other 
foreign hostages. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a mission uncompleted. There are other Americans held against their 
will," Bush said. "I will carry the burden of the other hostages with me until 
every single one of them is free. And I mean it. . . . We say prayers about 
them every single night." 
</P>
<P>
Bush learned of Polhill's freedom while fishing off the Florida Keys. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said "there were no deals, no 
negotiations, with the hostage takers" to secure the release. He also said 
there has been no direct U.S. contact with the hostage takers. 
</P>
<P>
And Bush added, "We're not going to trade" to obtain the freedom of the other 
hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Polhill's release by the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine provided 
the first step toward what could lead to improved relations with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, Bush carefully paid tribute to the shadowy, uncertain role 
of Iran in obtaining Polhill's freedom, as well as to the more obvious role of 
Syria. 
</P>
<P>
"We . . . wish to thank those who had a hand in the release, particularly the 
governments of Syria and Iran, whose efforts have contributed to the release of 
this hostage," the President said in a written statement issued by the White 
House in Islamorada, about 80 miles north of Key West, before Bush returned 
from his daylong fishing expedition. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the nod to Iran, Fitzwater said the U.S. contacts had been strictly 
through the Syrian government, and another Administration official said that 
Syria was 85% responsible for obtaining Polhill's freedom. 
</P>
<P>
But, while the White House emphasized Syria's role, ranking State Department 
officials stressed Iran's pivotal influence. 
</P>
<P>
"Iran has always been the only party with sufficient influence over the 
Lebanese groups to be able to end this thing," a State Department analyst said. 
"Syria was clearly the facilitator on this one. It has presence in Lebanon, but 
it doesn't have the clout. We've always known it would take Tehran's 
intervention to get things moving." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a leading Iranian official indicated Sunday that other hostages may 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
"We are really hopeful that this process would be sped up and more hostages 
would be released," Kamal Kharrazi, the Iranian ambassador to the United 
Nations, said on CBS' "Face the Nation." 
</P>
<P>
But Kharrazi added, "To speed up this process, you know, every party has to 
become more involved and do something on behalf of Muslim people of Lebanon." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said it is "far too soon" to speculate about whether the release 
signaled a change in U.S. relations with Iran, which soured when the Shah 
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi was overthrown by Islamic fundamentalists in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a number of difficulties with Iran and with the terrorists, certainly, 
who took these captives in the first place," said Fitzwater. "It is far too 
soon to speculate on any possible changes in our relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Another U.S. official said that before any goodwill gestures by the United 
States, the remaining seven Americans held hostage in Lebanon will have to be 
released. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a cruel process," Bush tolds reporters. "You see pictures flash, loved 
ones getting their hopes up, and then some hopes are dashed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have forgiveness in my heart as long as one American is held against 
his will and as long as one family has a broken heart." 
</P>
<P>
The President headed out onto the flats of the Florida Bay early Sunday 
morning, on what has become an annual fishing weekend stalking bonefish, 
accompanied by Brent Scowcroft, his national security adviser and several 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said Scowcroft, taking advantage of "excellent" shore-to-ship 
communications aboard a small skiff, notified Bush of the impending release. 
Word had been relayed to Scowcroft from the White House Situation Room, 
Fitzwater said, and the presidential adviser was "able to monitor this 
situation on a continuing basis." 
</P>
<P>
After returning to shore, the President spoke by telephone with Polhill, with 
the freed hostage's wife and with Polhill's mother. 
</P>
<P>
"I said I could hardly hear him, and he said that his voice was a little weak," 
Bush said. He said he told the Polhills that the Administration is not going to 
forget the other hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said he had no indication that Polhill was given any message by his 
captors to deliver to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The presidential spokesman added that the Administration has no way of knowing 
what specifically motivated the hostage holders to release Polhill. 
</P>
<P>
Also, U.S. officials had no explanation for why Polhill was selected as the 
first of the three held by Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine to be 
freed, except for the fact that he is a diabetic and needs daily medication. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's primary goal appears to be gaining financial credits and access to 
Western technology to rebuild after eight years of war with Iraq and 11 years 
of revolution, during which major development projects have been put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
"The cost of holding hostages any longer began to work against Tehran," 
explained a U.S. analyst on Iran. "It was time to begin ending it."

ABDUCTION OF 4 PROFESSORS WAS AUDACIOUS, BIZARRE; 
</P>
<P>
LEBANON: AN ELABORATE CHARADE FOOLED THE ACADEMICS AND THEIR SECURITY GUARDS AS 
WELL.

<P>
With his hands bound and a gun pointed at his head, Alann Steen turned to his 
wife and said, "Don't worry darling, it's only a demonstration." 
</P>
<P>
They were the last words Virginia Steen heard from her husband on the day, more 
than three years ago, that he was abducted from the campus of Beirut University 
College along with three fellow academics, Americans Robert Polhill, Jesse 
Turner and Indian-born U.S. resident Mithileshwar Singh, who was later freed. 
</P>
<P>
Polhill's release Sunday left seven Americans, including Steen and Turner, 
still in captivity in Lebanon. Journalist Terry A. Anderson, the longest held 
of the hostages, marked his fifth anniversary in captivity March 16. 
</P>
<P>
Polhill, Steen and Turner were not the first Americans to be kidnaped in 
Lebanon, nor would they be the last. But their abduction on Jan. 24, 1987, 
stood apart from Lebanon's other kidnapings, both for its sheer audacity and 
for the bizarre manner in which it dramatized, more than any similar incident 
before or since, the full extent of the lawlessness then prevailing in Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
In an elaborate charade that fooled both the victims and their security guards, 
gunmen dressed as members of Lebanon's Internal Security Force seized the four 
professors from their Beirut campus after luring them to a meeting to discuss 
arrangements for their safety. 
</P>
<P>
The kidnapers themselves were such convincing actors that, even after being 
handcuffed, Steen, a journalism professor originally from Arcata, Calif., 
thought it was all a joke, according to accounts provided by witnesses. Not 
until the hostages were bundled into the gunmen's police car and spirited off 
campus did the terrifying truth of what had happened become apparent. 
</P>
<P>
The abduction stood apart for another reason. Islamic Jihad for the Liberation 
of Palestine, the name used by the professors' kidnapers, surfaced for the 
first time with their abduction. The group has not, at least under that name, 
kidnaped anyone since. 
</P>
<P>
Terrorism experts have different theories, but many believe that the Islamic 
Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine (IJLP) is a terrorist hybrid -- its 
members drawn from the older and more active Lebanese Shiite organization 
Islamic Jihad and from the ranks of radical Palestinian splinter groups. It is 
also thought to have links to Hezbollah, the Iranian-organized umbrella group 
for Shiite radicals in Lebanon, and through that connection, to have loose ties 
to Iran itself. 
</P>
<P>
One theory holds that Islamic Jihad and most of the other Shiite groups under 
the Hezbollah umbrella are in fact a single, if highly amorphous, entity 
operating under the deliberate confusion of different names. However, there 
also are indications that the links between some of the groups have grown 
tenuous, reflecting divisions that have emerged between radical and more 
moderate political factions in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the audacious manner in which IJLP members kidnaped Polhill, a 
business professor from Beacon, N.Y., and the other three professors suggested 
both a high degree of training and preliminary intelligence work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STRUCTURE OF TERROR IN LEBANON 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in 1984, scores of foreigners from 18 nations have been abducted by 
a dozen different terrorist factions, most of them pro-Iranian Shiite Muslim 
extremists. Here are some of those factions. 
</P>
<P>
HEZBOLLAH: Also called Party of God, it is best-known Shiite group; 
intelligence analysts believe all Shiite terrorist factions fall under 
Hezbollah umbrella. Movement was born in Lebanon under guidance of Iranian 
Revolutionary Guards to help Lebanese Muslims and Palestinians resist 1982 
Israeli invasion. Leaders: Sheiks Hussein Moussawi, Abdel Karim Obeid, Sobhi 
Tufaili. Spiritual leader: Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah. 
</P>
<P>
ISLAMIC JIHAD: First of many Hezbollah cells to gain world attention, Islamic 
Jihad (Islamic Holy War) holds American hostages Terry A. Anderson and Thomas 
Sutherland and reportedly killed British hostage Denis Hill in 1985; 
responsible for 1983 bombing of U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut and bombings of 
U.S. Embassy in Beirut in 1983 and 1984, with more than 300 killed; also began 
cycle of kidnaping Americans in Lebanon with abduction of Frank Regier in 1984. 
It demands release of 15 Lebanese and Iraqis imprisoned in Kuwait for terrorist 
bombings; one prisoner is brother-in-law of Islamic Jihad's leader, Imad 
Mughniyah. 
</P>
<P>
ORGANIZATION OF THE OPPRESSED ON EARTH: Claimed responsibility last July for 
killing U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, a member of U.N. observer unit 
kidnaped in southern Lebanon in 1988. The group first surfaced in 1986 when it 
reported kidnaping and executing several Lebanese Jews; it gained notoriety in 
1987 when it seized two West German businessmen in retaliation for Bonn's 
arrest of Mohammed Ali Hamadi, a leader of 1985 hijacking of TWA flight in 
which a U.S. sailor was murdered. 
</P>
<P>
ISLAMIC JIHAD FOR THE LIBERATION OF PALESTINE: It claims to still hold two 
American hostages, Alann Steen and Jesse Turner. The two men and newly released 
hostage Robert Polhill were all employees of Beirut University College when 
they were abducted in January, 1987. Polhill is the first American hostage to 
be set free since November, 1986. Leaders: Unknown. 
</P>
<P>
REVOLUTIONARY JUSTICE ORGANIZATION: Claims to hold two American hostages, 
Joseph J. Ciccipio, controller at American University of Beirut, and Edward A. 
Tracy, author and illustrator. A pro-Iranian Shiite group, it may be Islamic 
Jihad under another name, some analysts believe. It claimed responsibility for 
kidnaping and later releasing a number of French citizens in 1986 and 1987. 
Leaders: Unknown. 
</P>
<P>
ARAB REVOLUTIONARY CELLS-OMAR MOUKHTAR FORCES: A pro-Libyan group that claims 
to hold American Frank H. Reed, director of a private Beirut school who was 
abducted in September, 1986. Leaders: Unknown. 
</P>
<P>
REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATION OF SOCIALIST MUSLIMS: Claimed responsibility for 
1985 abduction of Briton Alec Collett, a U.N. aid worker, and hanging him the 
following year. Leaders: Unknown.

The Tehran Times called today for the release of a second U.S. hostage in 
Lebanon after Robert Polhill was freed by pro-Iranian captors Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, which is close to President Hashemi Rafsanjani, said that "to 
contribute to the establishment of a general atmosphere of trust, the Lebanese 
groups should release another American hostage." 
</P>
<P>
"By so doing, they once more prove their goodwill and preparedness for the 
settlement of the issue." 
</P>
<P>
An informed Iranian source said that he expects another American to be freed by 
Friday. The source, who asked not to be identified, said this should be 
followed by the release by Israel of Shiite Muslim cleric Abdel Karim Obeid, 
abducted by Israeli commandos from southern Lebanon last year. 
</P>
<P>
Obeid is a senior member of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, an 
umbrella group for various extremist organizations believed to be holding seven 
Americans and other Westerners in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, Israel declined to comment Sunday on whether the release of 
Polhill was part of a larger deal to free Israeli-held Arab prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Yossi Olmert, the Government Press Office director, said, "We have no comment 
on this, no comment at all."

A Polish investigative journalist who received death threats after writing 
articles about the secret police narrowly escaped from a mysterious fire Sunday 
that killed his wife, his newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman at Gazeta Wyborcza, the Solidarity union daily, said Jerzy 
Jachowicz's wife was killed and his 15-year-old daughter badly injured when all 
three leaped from their second-floor apartment to escape the fire. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Jachowicz, who was in shock, blames arsonists for the 
fire at his home near Warsaw. But police authorities said they suspect the fire 
was caused by an electrical fault. 
</P>
<P>
Jachowicz, one of the few investigative journalists in Poland, has written 
several articles about the Interior Ministry and the secret police. One of his 
reports was considered instrumental in the disbanding earlier this year of a 
paramilitary group consisting of former police officers.

POPE PLANS LONG-AWAITED VISIT TO CUBA 
</P>

<P>
Pope John Paul II will make a long-awaited pastoral visit to Cuba later this 
year, the Vatican announced Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement triggered speculation in the papal party, not confirmed by the 
Vatican, that Cuba became an added starter to the Pope's crowded 1990 travel 
schedule to take advantage of international momentum for democratic change 
begun with the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The pontiff, who repeatedly applauded what he called East Europe's return to 
"freedom's road" on his two-day Czechoslovak visit, had not been expected to 
travel to Cuba until some time in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting with reporters while the Pope celebrated Mass here, his spokesman, 
Joaquin Navarro, said that the visit will come before Christmas and probably 
will last five or six days. Navarro said that John Paul was formally invited to 
make the visit by Cuba's Roman Catholic bishops and by the Cuban government. 
</P>
<P>
The Polish-born John Paul is applauded throughout Eastern Europe as a symbol of 
the human rights struggle and an important catalyst for change. 
</P>
<P>
Fidel Castro, Cuba's Marxist president, has adamantly rejected perestroika in 
the Soviet Union that has made change possible in East Europe, but of late, he 
has muted a longstanding antagonism toward religion. 
</P>
<P>
Precise dates and details for the Cuba trip are still being worked out, Navarro 
said, but the Vatican expects that the pontiff will arrive in Havana around 
Dec. 9. He is expected to travel throughout the country, visiting each of the 
seven Cuban dioceses. 
</P>
<P>
If he follows his usual pattern, the Pope will also meet privately with Castro, 
with Cuban intellectuals, with the diplomatic corps and with leaders of other 
churches. 
</P>
<P>
Under Communist rule since 1959, Cuba is the largest Roman Catholic country and 
the last major Western Hemisphere country that has yet to be host to a visit 
from John Paul. 
</P>
<P>
The 69-year-old John Paul, in the 11th year of his papacy, usually makes four 
foreign trips each year. The addition of Cuba makes six for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
In January, the Pope visited five Sahel countries in West Africa. After his 
Czechoslovakia visit, he will begin a new round of visits to Latin American 
countries in Mexico on May 6. At the end of May, he goes to Malta, and in 
September he returns to Africa, before completing his busiest travel year with 
the Cuban visit.

NIGERIA TROOPS STOP REBEL OFFICERS IN COUP ATTEMPT;

AFRICA: PRESIDENT BABANGIDA SAYS INSURGENTS HAVE BEEN CAPTURED. THE UPRISING IS 
BLAMED ON MUSLIM-CHRISTIAN TENSIONS.

<P>
A group of obscure mid-level officers staged a coup attempt Sunday against the 
military government of Nigeria, but government troops appeared to have quashed 
the attempt after half a day of heavy fighting in the capital, Lagos. 
</P>
<P>
If successful, the coup would have been the seventh in the contentious 
country's 30 years of independence. Nigeria, which with more than 110 million 
people is the most populous country in Africa, has often been roiled by tribal 
disputes and by a religious division that pits the Muslims in the north, who 
hold a slight numerical superiority, against Christians in the south. 
</P>
<P>
Although for most of the day the whereabouts and condition of President Ibrahim 
Babangida were unknown, he surfaced late Sunday to talk with reporters, the 
official News Agency of Nigeria reported. 
</P>
<P>
"The unfortunate situation in Lagos this morning has been brought under 
control," he said, adding that his military aide, Lt. Col. U. K. Bello, had 
been among the loyalists slain in the fighting. Most of the rebel leaders have 
been captured and will be tried, he said. There was no other word on 
casualties. 
</P>
<P>
The coup plotters evidently harbored grievances against what they perceived to 
be the Babangida government's increasing favoritism toward the Muslim north. 
Early Sunday morning, after rebel troops had seized control of Radio Nigeria 
headquarters in Lagos, a man identifying himself as Maj. Gideon Oguaza Oka 
announced over the air that, on behalf of the Christian regions of the "middle 
belt and southern parts of this country, I wish to happily inform you of the 
successful ousting of the dictatorial, corrupt, drug-baronish, inhumane, 
sadistic, deceitful, homosexually centered and unpatriotic administration of 
Gen. Ibrahim Babangida." 
</P>
<P>
Oka said the northern states of Borno, Bauchi, Kano, Katsina and Sokoto -- all 
almost entirely Muslim -- would be excised from the country and not allowed to 
rejoin the 21-state federation until they proved their loyalty to the new 
regime. Northerners working in the south would be forced to return to their 
homes, he added. 
</P>
<P>
By noon local time, however, the radio station had been retaken by government 
troops, and a military leader said the coup had been crushed. There was 
sporadic fighting in Lagos, but it appeared to have ended by nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the coup attempt, the military government moved quickly to allay 
fears that the plot's most significant casualty might be Babangida's plan to 
return power to civilian control on Oct. 1, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"No amount of threat or blackmail will distract the government's attention in 
this regard," said Sanni Abacha, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, in a 
radio address. "We are set to hand over (power) to a democratically elected 
government in 1992." 
</P>
<P>
Like his seven predecessors as leaders of independent Nigeria, Babangida, 49, 
is Muslim. But over his five years of power, he has shown such finesse at 
balancing the country's contentious political and religious interests that an 
admiring domestic press has dubbed him "the Maradona of politics," a reference 
to the wily Argentine soccer player, Diego Maradona. 
</P>
<P>
His broad popular support, enforced by occasional strong-arm tactics, enabled 
him to impose a harsh economic adjustment program on the spendthrift and 
heavily indebted country, which is a major oil exporter. 
</P>
<P>
But the economic strictures have reduced the standard of living so much that 
Babangida's political support has been draining away.

'HERE WE ARE AGAIN!' -- CREW OF DISCOVERY READY FOR LAUNCH

The shuttle Discovery's crew flew back to Florida on Sunday for blastoff 
Tuesday on a critical flight to carry the $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope 
into orbit, 14 days late because of hydraulic problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, here we are again!" Discovery skipper Loren J. Shriver said shortly 
after the crew arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel very confident that things are going to go well this time." 
</P>
<P>
Air Force meteorologists predicted a 70% chance of good weather at launch time 
Tuesday, although an approaching frontal system could cause problems should it 
slow down or stall today as it moves through the area. 
</P>
<P>
With Discovery's countdown ticking smoothly toward a second launch attempt, 
engineers Sunday hauled another shuttle, Columbia, from the cavernous Vehicle 
Assembly Building to pad 39A for liftoff May 16 to ferry a battery of more 
modest telescopes into space. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery is making its 10th flight. If all goes well, Shriver, 45; co-pilot 
Charles F. Bolden, 43; Steven A. Hawley, 38; Bruce McCandless, 52, and Kathryn 
D. Sullivan, 38, will blast off on the 35th shuttle mission at 5:31 a.m. PDT 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle, chairman of the National Space Council, may attend 
the launching if his schedule permits, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery's first launch try was called off just four minutes prior to liftoff 
April 10 after one of three auxiliary power units, or APUs, malfunctioned. The 
APUs pressurize the shuttle's hydraulic system for steering during launch and 
their operation is crucial for a safe flight. 
</P>
<P>
The crew is scheduled to deploy the Hubble Space Telescope on Wednesday. Once 
the instrument is checked out and operating on its own, the astronauts will 
devote the remainder of their five-day mission to a series of relatively minor 
experiments before gliding to a touchdown at Edwards Air Force Base on Sunday.

MAN KILLED, ANOTHER WOUNDED IN SHOOTING NEAR GLASSELL PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One man was shot to death and another was critically wounded when an argument 
involving as many as 15 people erupted in gunfire in the Glassell Park area 
early Sunday morning, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses reported hearing a loud argument before the 4 a.m. shooting on Drew 
Street, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
"They observed a fight and heard gunshots and saw a male chasing the two 
victims down the street," Lt. Ron Young said. 
</P>
<P>
A 22-year-old man was found lying in the street on Avenue 32 near Chapman 
Street, with a gunshot wound in the upper body. He was pronounced dead at the 
scene, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A 21-year-old man, found nearby with a gunshot wound to the chest, was in 
critical condition at County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The victims' names were withheld pending notification of relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they have no motive for the argument or the shootings and no 
arrests have been made.

FEINSTEIN SUPPORTS RIVAL'S 'BIG GREEN' INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dianne Feinstein used the Earth Day stage to 
proclaim her support of the so-called "Big Green" environmental protection 
initiative co-sponsored by her rival, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's announcement, during remarks at a Santa Monica beach celebration 
and later at Exposition Park, was an abrupt departure from her longstanding 
refusal to announce her position on the initiative until it qualified for the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
In endorsing it, Feinstein said it didn't matter that her opponent was a major 
sponsor of the measure. "I think it's the right way to go for the state," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters have collected more than 600,000 signatures in support of placing 
Big Green on the November ballot, well over the 375,000 valid signatures 
needed. Proponents have until Friday to turn their petitions in to the 
secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
The former San Francisco mayor's decision to endorse the measure ended a 
difficult political conflict for her. Under vocal pressure from Van de Kamp and 
environmentalists to back it, she also has been pressed by her supporters in 
the Central Valley to oppose the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Central Valley farming interests have charged that the initiative's ban on 23 
pesticides would decimate the state's agriculture industry. As recently as 
Thursday, Feinstein said she was troubled by Big Green's pesticide 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Feinstein said she had satisfied herself that the measure would not 
place too much of a burden on California agriculture. She said the measure 
allowed for a three-year delay in banning some pesticides if no safe 
alternatives were available. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if the initiative passes, the next governor has to put the state on a 
fast track to come up with real, integrated pest management (alternatives)," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
In their battle for the party's gubernatorial nomination in the June 5 primary, 
Van de Kamp has made the sweeping Big Green initiative his environmental 
platform. Feinstein, in contrast, has offered a more cautious agenda, free of 
the specifics and restrictions laid out in the initiative.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / INSURANCE COMMISSIONER;

<P>
GOP'S LINK TO INDUSTRY MAY KILL CHANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In contrast to the intense and expensive battle for the Democratic nomination 
for insurance commissioner, the contest among five contenders on the Republican 
side is poorly financed and well out of the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
Focus group interviews conducted by a GOP political consultant in Sacramento 
have given as strong an indication as any that the Republican candidates in the 
state's first election for insurance commissioner have only a slim chance of 
victory in the November general election. 
</P>
<P>
According to consultant Sal Russo, the chief finding from eight focus groups in 
Los Angeles, Orange County, the Bay Area and Sacramento is that "clearly, 
voters weren't looking for somebody who was from the insurance industry, and 
they didn't see a big distinction between agents and brokers and other 
insurance people." 
</P>
<P>
This is bad news for the Republican field, because four of the five candidates 
are insurance people of one kind or another, and the other has insurance 
associations. 
</P>
<P>
Focus groups are panels of various segments of the electorate -- of 10 to 12 
people each -- who are interviewed in-depth on their views. They are often used 
by market researchers and political strategists to closely examine what 
advertising sales pitches, products or candidates will go over best with the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
The findings of the Russo focus groups have been cited in recent campaign 
appearances by Thomas A. Skornia, one of the GOP candidates, to argue that the 
other four GOP candidates would not be as strong in the general election as he 
would be because they all are insurance men. 
</P>
<P>
But until recently, Skornia was an official of the Assn. of California Tort 
Reform, a group regarded in political circles as so close to the insurance 
industry that its endorsement for the Democratic nomination was repudiated last 
week by a candidate concerned that he would be tainted by its insurance 
associations. 
</P>
<P>
Skornia has been one of the top two candidates in most polls of the race for 
the Republican nomination. The other, Wes Bannister, decided to call himself a 
"small business owner" on the ballot. The small business he owns is a 
Huntington Beach insurance agency. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent appearance by three of the GOP candidates before a Republican 
women's group in Anaheim, Bannister contended that being part of the insurance 
industry would not necessarily be a handicap in the race because, in the end, 
voters might want a regulator who fully understood the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why he had taken steps to conceal his occupation on the ballot, Bannister 
smiled and said, "I figure, why take a chance?" 
</P>
<P>
Bannister has been the best financed of the Republican candidates. But he 
conceded recently that his contributions have been so slim that he had to 
dismiss his campaign consultant and is trying to rely on volunteers. "I am 
usually traveling and working alone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, at least three Democrats have several hundred thousand dollars in 
contributions thus far. 
</P>
<P>
Russo said his focus groups indicated that voters "wanted somebody who was 
knowledgeable or understanding of the insurance industry, but someone who had 
some distance -- maybe a CEO (chief executive officer) -- who got fed up and 
quit and is now working for a public interest group. 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't looking for anyone to bash the companies, necessarily, but they 
wanted a consumer tilt, somebody who could make sure that everybody was playing 
fair. The name that came up most was Peter Ueberroth." 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth, former president of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee and 
former commissioner of baseball, never showed an interest in running for 
insurance commissioner and filing for the position has closed. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Bannister and Skornia, the other GOP candidates are insurance 
adjuster/investigator John L. (Jack) Hardin, claims consultant Joseph D. 
Dunlop, and lawyer/insurance broker John S. Perise. 
</P>
<P>
Hardin and Dunlop have sided with the industry in recent campaign speeches. 
Hardin's chief campaign plank has been a promise to crack down on those making 
fraudulent insurance claims. 
</P>
<P>
Perise is the only GOP candidate to take the trial lawyers' side of the 
insurance issue and oppose no-fault insurance. He defends the industry in many 
instances, however. 
</P>
<P>
Russo said the focus groups indicated that the right kind of Republican could 
have stood a chance in the race. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a little higher comfort level with a Democrat than a Republican, in 
general," he said. "But it was not so pronounced that I thought it was a bar. A 
Republican who didn't look like he was in the industry's pocket could 
definitely win." 
</P>
<P>
However, he said, none of the five contenders would seem to fit that 
description.

U.S. MAY NOT CITE JAPAN FOR UNFAIR PRACTICES; 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration is rapidly moving toward a decision not to cite Japan 
for alleged unfair trade practices this year -- a move certain to spark a 
backlash in Congress, which enacted the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act expressly for 
that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, described by key officials as all but made, is being held up 
pending final resolution by Tokyo of a number of narrower-interest trade 
disputes -- primarily a 1989 case involving Japanese barriers to U.S. wood 
products. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on the wood products issue are scheduled to resume in Tokyo this 
week. Although prospects for a settlement still are touch and go, U.S. 
negotiators are reasonably confident that Japan will make serious concessions. 
</P>
<P>
If the lumber talks result in an accord, the decision not to cite Japan with a 
new round of trade cases is expected to be affirmed formally at a Cabinet 
meeting on Friday or next Monday. The move has the support of virtually all the 
Administration's top economic policy-makers. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, U.S. officials say if the White House does not formally cite Japan 
this year, it probably will not launch any new unfair-trade-practices 
proceedings -- even against India and Brazil, which were included with Japan on 
last year's list. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials concede that if the decision is made as anticipated, 
it could create a firestorm in Congress, which has been growing increasingly 
resentful of what lawmakers perceive as Japanese intransigence. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bush Administration officials hope to assuage legislators by citing 
concessions that Tokyo has made in the Structural Impediments Initiative -- a 
broad economic pact that the White House just reached with Japan -- they 
concede the risk of a backlash is high. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John C. Danforth (R-Mo.), one of the most outspoken trade hawks in 
Congress, recently wrote President Bush that failure to target Japan again 
would "seriously jeopardize" the credibility of U.S. trade policy. 
</P>
<P>
Danforth also warned that "the executive branch may be falling into a pattern 
of sidestepping U.S. trade law" by seeking to avoid the retaliation that the 
1988 trade act makes possible. The push within the Administration to avoid 
filing unfair-trade-practices cases this year -- known to top policy-makers as 
the "zero option" proposal -- reflects several factors: 
</P>
<P>
Bush is known to feel strongly that the United States should give Japan a break 
because Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu spent a lot of political capital 
pushing through major concessions for Washington in the SII talks that are just 
now ending. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials believe that if the Administration does not cite Japan, it would 
look foolish launching unfair-trade-practices proceedings against smaller 
countries. The main reason it targeted Brazil and India last year was to avoid 
seeming to single out Japan alone. 
</P>
<P>
Some policy-makers believe that the United States will risk losing support for 
broader U.S. trade goals in the Uruguay Round -- the global 
trade-liberalization talks now going on in Geneva -- if it again targets other 
countries as allegedly unfair traders. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the White House has almost run out of potential 
unfair-trade-practices cases involving Japan. One possible candidate -- Tokyo's 
recalcitrance in granting a U.S. firm a patent for a high-tech metal alloy -- 
was removed last week when Japan agreed to hold separate talks. 
</P>
<P>
On another, involving Japanese refusal to protect U.S.-made sound recordings 
adequately from possible piracy, negotiators say Tokyo is on the verge of 
making significant concessions. A third, Japan's refusal to buy U.S.-made auto 
parts, involves quality questions. 
</P>
<P>
Although U.S. officials say the current dispute over wood products remains the 
primary obstacle to carrying out the zero option approach, they concede that 
they also are waiting to see how Tokyo handles the sound-recordings issue and a 
complaint over medical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
According to Administration officials, the prime movers in pushing for the zero 
option strategy are Budget Director Richard G. Darman and White House National 
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft. Only Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher 
wants to cite Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say the decision probably will be made directly by Bush.

SECRETARIES: A SNAPSHOT OF THE PROFESSOR

<P>
You should be especially nice to your secretary this week. And not just because 
this happens to be Professional Secretaries Week but also because secretaries 
are already in short supply and demand for their services is growing. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 16.9% increase in 
secretarial jobs nationwide by the year 2000. In Southern California, demand is 
even stronger. The state Employment Development Department estimates that in 
just five years -- from 1987 to 1992 -- the number of openings for secretaries 
in Los Angeles County will increase by 15.3%, to 144,580. (Orange County, over 
the same period, is expected to show an 8.3% rise, to 31,510 openings.) 
</P>
<P>
Professional Secretaries Week was established in 1952 as an effort by 
Professional Secretaries International to upgrade the image of the profession. 
</P>
<P>
Strictly secretarial job classifications, which the government reports under 
three occupational employment statistics codes, have been used for the 
accompanying statistics. Classifications include medical and legal secretaries 
but exclude such general office occupations as clerks, receptionists, typists 
and stenographers.

Amgen to Sell Drug in Japan: Amgen Inc., a Thousand Oaks biotechnology concern, 
said its Japanese partner received government approval to sell Amgen's 
anti-anemia drug in Japan to patients with kidney problems. Kirin Brewery Co. 
will sell the drug, erythropoietin, under the trade name Espo in Japan where 
about 80,000 people suffer from anemia due to kidney failure, Amgen said. Amgen 
began selling the drug in the United States last June but is locked in a 
dispute with competitor Genetics Institute over U.S. marketing rights for the 
drug.

Keating Insurance Hearing: After hearing lawyers' arguments in Los Angeles, 
U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson asked for more information before he rules 
on whether an insurance firm must defend Charles H. Keating Jr., chairman of 
American Continental Corp., against bondholders' lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
National Union Fire Insurance Co. of Pittsburgh argued that Keating's policy 
does not cover the suits by bondholders who bought $200 million in uninsured, 
now-worthless junk bonds. Keating and several executives sued the insurance 
company to force it to defend them. (Filed Sept. 7, 1989. Case Nos. CV89-5354; 
CV89-6799)

New York Business Travel Is Costly: New York was the nation's most expensive 
city for business travelers in 1989, with an average daily tab of $312.01, 
according to a survey by Corporate Travel magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The average daily cost of a hotel room, three meals and a car rental in 
America's 100 most expensive cities for business travelers was $159.42, 
virtually the same as in 1988, the magazine said. Chicago was second at 
$255.77, followed by Boston, $251.87; Washington, $226.16, and Newark, N.J., 
$218.39. Rounding out the top 10 were San Francisco, $207.22; Los Angeles, 
$192.42; Dallas, $190.91; Baltimore, $185.84, and Detroit, $185.40. The least 
expensive city cited was Tallahassee, Fla., at $115.56.

What do baseball and bankruptcy investing have in common? Easy. They're both 
wonderful spectator sports, provided you know how the game is played. And in 
both sports, you are constantly reminded that no matter how good a team's 
players are or how rich the owner is, no one wins them all. 
</P>
<P>
Today's example involves Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., perhaps the classiest 
investment banking firm in the country, if not the world, and the thrashing it 
received when it tried to take control of the bankruptcy of Wheeling-Pittsburgh 
Steel Corp. Goldman is rich, powerful and smart. It even plans for the long 
term, which is not only admirable, but almost unheard of among securities firms 
these days. But Goldman isn't infallible, despite what many of its partners 
would like the world to think. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman decided in early 1989 to invest $15 million in the common stock of 
Wheeling Pitt, which had been operating under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code 
since 1985. Why buy stock in a bankrupt company, paying the seller something 
like 150 times what he had paid for his shares? Because Goldman was convinced 
that it could use that stock to influence the course of the bankruptcy, making 
a ton of money for itself. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, Goldman would show the masses that Wall Street aristocrats can 
outfight the junkyard dogs of bankruptcy investing. Bankruptcy investors, in 
case you've never met one, are a particularly fierce, smart, proud and hungry 
crew. They love making money, humiliating opponents, beating each other up--and 
eating outsiders for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of showing the commoners how it's done, Goldman showed everyone how 
it shouldn't be done. Goldman has finally given up the fight, and is in the 
process of departing the field of battle, having left behind a bit of its money 
and a good hunk of its reputation for shrewd investing. 
</P>
<P>
Making things even worse--or better, if you're one of Goldman's competitors--is 
the fact that Goldman couldn't have picked a more inconvenient time to take its 
bath in Wheeling Pitt. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Because Goldman is in the midst of trying to round up $400 million 
(minimum investment: $5 million) for a fund that will invest in securities of 
bankrupt and near-bankrupt companies. Goldman is throwing in $100 million of 
its own capital, making the fund's potential size a cool half billion dollars. 
The fund is designed not only to buy securities of bankrupts and 
near-bankrupts, but to influence the course of bankruptcies and corporate 
reorganizations. Which is why Wheeling Pitt isn't a small pimple, but a running 
sore. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Goldman's sales materials for the fund show the firm to have a good 
record in playing bankrupt securities, the one thing they always ask on Wall 
Street is, 'What have you done lately?' And lately, unfortunately, Goldman has 
Wheeling Pitt. 
</P>
<P>
To understand what happened, you have to remember that in a bankruptcy, you 
turn the normal world on its head. Under normal circumstances, a company's 
common shareholders control the show, and the only right that creditors have is 
to be paid on time and in full. But in a bankruptcy, unless there are very 
unusual circumstances, the power lies with the company's creditors. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Wheeling Pitt, partnerships run by Ronald LaBow, a veteran 
bankruptcy investor, seemed to have enough pieces of the right kind of paper to 
control the outcome of the bankruptcy. Though Goldman isn't talking about this, 
it's clear that the firm thought that LaBow's paper was vulnerable to attack. 
Goldman also thought that this was a bankruptcy in which power lay with holders 
of common stock. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, well. After 14 months of sparring with LaBow and various other players, and 
spending millions on legal fees--thank you, Goldman, for helping put more 
lawyers' children through college--Goldman decided to throw in with LaBow's 
plan rather than to keep letting its money and prestige continue going down the 
drain. 
</P>
<P>
'The mistake they made was thinking they could control the bankruptcy by buying 
common stock,' LaBow says. 
</P>
<P>
While the success of LaBow's plan isn't assured--in bankruptcy investing, you 
shouldn't count your profit until your securities have been sold and the check 
has cleared the bank--the defeat of Goldman is certain, absent a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman paid $8 a share for its Wheeling stock, more than any bankruptcy player 
was willing to pay. As this is being written, Wheeling stock is below $8, and 
seems to be headed downward. By some analysis, the LaBow plan values Wheeling 
stock at $6 or less. But even if Wheeling stock goes above $8, Goldman is still 
out a bunch of money, given legal fees and other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman says that instead of harping on Wheeling Pittsburgh, we should look at 
the profits the firm stands to make on its investment in Penrod Drilling. In 
the Penrod bankruptcy, a group that includes Goldman, Texas investor Richard 
Rainwater and a company that he controls are duking it out with Loews Corp. But 
that paper profit isn't in the bank. And it's far from clear that is a Goldman 
show rather than a Rainwater show. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman, being full of smart people, may well end up doing a great job of 
playing Bankruptcy Hardball. But so far, the score is Junkyard Dogs 1, Goldman 
0. Best of three, anyone?

IN O.C., A DAY OF CELEBRATION, NOT PROTEST

<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty years ago on the first Earth Day, Robert Wilson was ankle deep in muck, 
supervising a tree-clearing effort in the rainy upper reaches of an Oregon 
forest. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a logger, and I remember how the crew joked about hippies celebrating 
Earth Day," Wilson recalled of the April, 1970, rallies and protests about the 
environment's demise. Retired and now living in Santa Ana, he just shook his 
head Sunday thinking about his foresting days. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize now I was the crazy one. . . . Thank God I came to my senses." 
</P>
<P>
To show his "green attitude," Wilson joined thousands of other Orange County 
residents who took to the outdoors Sunday from La Habra to Dana Point to plant 
trees, remove garbage and attend rallies marking the 20th anniversary of Earth 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
The mood Sunday was one of celebration, not protest, and there were bittersweet 
reminders of the initial Earth Day as 1960s-era folk tunes and rhetoric filled 
the air. Pamphlets on water conservation, how to eat organic and shop 
"environmentally smarter" were distributed by the hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
And exhibitors gave it their best environmental pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"Bees are going to be our saviors" proclaimed David Marder, operator of a 
bee-removal service known as "Bee Busters," one of 50 vendors and groups at 
Santa Ana's Centennial Park. As he talked about the insects' pollinating 
virtues, about 5,000 bees swarmed inside an enclosed hive on his display table. 
"They have so much energy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A few feet away, people fed aluminum cans into a machine known as the "munch 
monster" that crushed the cans for recycling. 
</P>
<P>
In Laguna Niguel, a health-food booth at the city's ecology fair was jammed as 
activists bought meatless chili dogs known as "tofu pups" and leafed through 
copies of "Cruelty-Free Shopping Guide," a book about companies that test new 
products on animals. 
</P>
<P>
At the Santa Ana Zoo, retired schoolteacher Betty Tobey slowly cooked hot dogs 
in a solar oven, hoping to give passers-by some samples. Only one hitch: The 
clouds kept blocking the sun, so the oven never got hot. 
</P>
<P>
And in Huntington Beach, one enterprising teen-ager was selling for $2.50 each 
vials of sand he said had been contaminated by oil from the 394,000-gallon 
spill in early February. He called his product "Oil of L.A." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone, however, was on the environmental bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
In Irvine, a pair of protesters with the group Young Americans for Freedom 
carried signs accusing that city's activist Mayor Larry Agran of being an 
"Eviro-alarmist" and an "Environmental Chicken Little" for helping pass 
restrictions on the use of chlorofluorocarbons by Irvine businesses, a law some 
say is not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Even as Earth Day unfolded, environmentalists worried that Earth Day 1990 would 
prove to be anticlimactic after weeks of headlines and buildup. 
</P>
<P>
"I am anxious to have all this falderal over," said Jean H. Watt, a Newport 
Beach councilwoman and longtime activist. "All the attention has been so 
concentrated that I am worried that people may get turned off." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, organizers of the county's single largest Earth Day event, 
"Earthfestival" at Centennial Park, had hoped to attract up to 10,000 people, 
but less than a third that many attended. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 people did walk nearly seven miles from the park early Sunday along 
the Santa Ana River to the ocean near Newport Beach. Wearing green ribbons, the 
marchers tried to draw attention to ocean pollution and the need to develop 
more parks and greenbelts along the channelized river which cuts through some 
of the county's most populated neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"There's some sort of crazy idea that Orange County doesn't have any 
environment, that it is already lost," said Wilfred Donaldson, a 55-year-old 
Placentia aerospace engineer who marched with his three teen-age sons. "That's 
bunk. It's still here. We've just got to recapture it." 
</P>
<P>
But Brenda de Jong was pessimistic about Mother Nature's chances of recovering 
from decades of dirty air, tainted water and overdevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like this is a wake for the demise of an old friend," she said as she 
helped her 2-year-old son fly a kite at Laguna Niguel's Earth Day event. "I'm 
still hopeful, but I'm not sure if we as a human race can do anything at this 
point." 
</P>
<P>
The message was far different at South Coast Plaza, where several hundred 
shoppers, many of them children, crowded around a makeshift stage and lined 
escalators to view a children's play, "Clean Up Your Act." Performed by seven 
trash-covered children, the short musical was about the need to recycle 
newspapers, cans and glass bottles. 
</P>
<P>
"This is most likely the least green place in Southern California," said Diane 
Doyle, the play's author, who is director of the Young Conservatory at South 
Coast Repertory theater company. The group chose the shopping mall to present 
the play, hoping to persuade at least a few people to sort their trash and 
recycle. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing our little part" she said. "You can't do the whole globe. We got 
South Coast Plaza." 
</P>
<P>
Lona Eid, a 19-year-old Fullerton College student, passed up a day at the beach 
to staff several informational booths at the Earthfestival. Some 
environmentalists, wary of all the corporate hype associated with this year's 
Earth Day, have expressed concern that once Earth Day ends, so, too, will much 
of the newly generated interest in the movement. 
</P>
<P>
Eid said she is involved for the long haul, but she is uncertain about others. 
"I hope to God they remember this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some, like Kevin Smith, said they never even knew Sunday was Earth Day. 
</P>
<P>
As he does almost every Sunday, Smith showed up at the Centennial Park pond 
just beyond the Earthfestival to race his radio-controlled, gas-powered boat 
with several buddies. At times, the loud reverberating sound of the model 
engines drowned out the festival music. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard something about Earth Day on the news," said Smith, a 27-year-old 
construction worker. "But really I don't know anything about it. We just come 
here to race our boats." 
</P>

Penner, Shannon Sands and Leon Teeboom contributed to this report.

FORECAST: Housing prices are driving out the county's workers, bad news for 
local employers, according to conventional wisdom. . . . Not so, according to 
the latest from Martin Brower, publisher of Orange County Report. . . . In the 
'90s workers will move to less costly Riverside and San Bernardino counties but 
still hold jobs in Orange County, raising employment twice as fast as 
population, says the report. . . . Orange County will become the economic 
center of the region extending from Carlsbad to the South Bay and 50 miles 
inland. David Reyes and Steve Emmons

A PLUM: Why did Gov. Deukmejian assign Orange County's brand new senator to 
carry his mandatory earthquake insurance bill, one of the biggest bills of the 
session? . . . According to one Sacramento insider, it's an effort to help 
Republican Frank Hill get a strong foothold in the upper chamber. . . . Hill, a 
four-term assemblyman before election to the Senate, is close to Deukmejian, 
and carrying the bill is bound to make points for Hill in his new district, 
which includes Whittier, site of the destructive 1987 quake. David Reyes and

Argentina has suspended work on its program to build the controversial

that the project, which is being developed jointly with Egypt, "is not going 
ahead because a political decision was taken and also because we have neither

The British government has blocked a bid by the Northern Ireland families of 
three IRA guerrillas shot to death by British commandos in Gibraltar two years 
ago to take legal action over the killings. The relatives had sought to claim 
damages from the British Defense Ministry for what they said were unlawful 
killings of the three Irish Republican Army activists. The three were slain in 
March, 1988, by British commandos who believed they were about to set off a car 
bomb.

The shuttle Discovery's crew flew back to Kennedy Space Center, Fla., for 
blastoff on a critical flight to carry the $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope 
into orbit. The Tuesday launch is 14 days late because of hydraulic problems. 
Air Force meteorologists predicted a 70% chance of good weather at launch time, 
although an approaching frontal system could cause problems should it slow down 
or stall today.

<TEXT>
<P>
When SuEllen Munoz went looking for a job last year, she worried about more 
than just whether she would qualify for the position: 
</P>
<P>
Where would she find suitable clothes and shoes? If she did find the clothes, 
how would she keep them clean? How would she keep herself clean and 
presentable? 
</P>
<P>
The concerns, minor worries for most job seekers, loom like major hurdles when 
you are, like Munoz, homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it is mental," she said recently, tired at the end of a day that had 
begun at 5 a.m. "You say to yourself, 'I don't look like someone they would 
want to hire anyway, so what's the use.' When you are homeless, you wonder how 
people are looking at you." 
</P>
<P>
Many homeless people like Munoz are trapped by a cruel Catch-22 of homeless 
life: when you are homeless it is nearly impossible to get a meaningful job. 
Yet without a job and a steady paycheck one can hardly afford a home. 
</P>
<P>
It is a dilemma that social welfare officials have been unable to solve through 
traditional job counseling programs. 
</P>
<P>
But several Orange County homeless people who participated in an innovative 
winter shelter program have been able to overcome the odds, not only finding 
employment but saving enough money to get off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning last November and ending earlier this month, the program used about 
two dozen churches around the county whose congregations agreed to shelter up 
to 12 homeless people for rotating two-week periods. 
</P>
<P>
A March survey indicated that about 65% of the nearly 70 participants had found 
permanent employment and about 50% had found permanent housing, figures that 
are expected to rise after the program's last round of participants are 
surveyed, said coordinators. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsors say the program has been successful because it has served not only as 
an emergency shelter but as a cushion for people who need a relatively short 
period of time to get on their feet again. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a program that serves a specific niche of the homeless population," said 
Susan Oakson, a coordinator with the Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force. 
"These are adults who need about 60 days of respite, if you will, to get into a 
more stable situation." 
</P>
<P>
The lack of stability in the lives of the homeless is a major deterrent to 
finding employment, according to directors of several local employment 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"Having a home is not a requirement to be able to do a job; however, I do 
believe it is a concern with an employer," said Barbara Sneve, a counselor with 
Jobs Plus, the county's job-training agency. 
</P>
<P>
Employers "would be concerned about an individual's ability to commit to and 
make it to a job on time. To be homeless is a type of instability," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Many employers might be unwilling to take a chance on such a person, especially 
for a permanent position, said Lila Zavetsky, co-owner of Tempaid, an 
Anaheim-based employment agency. 
</P>
<P>
Zavetsky is especially sensitive to the issue because her congregation at Our 
Redeemer Lutheran Church in Garden Grove was involved in the winter shelter 
program. She offered to help find jobs for many of those who sheltered at the 
church and ended up hiring SuEllen Munoz as an office manager. 
</P>
<P>
"I said I needed a typist and she said she typed," Zavetsky said of Munoz. "She 
turned out to be a godsend, and now she's running my office. If you give people 
a chance they will prove themselves." 
</P>
<P>
For Munoz, 40, and her husband Rolando, 33, the job offer could not have come 
at a better time. She had been a supervisor at a large department store but was 
laid off after suffering a serious leg injury. 
</P>
<P>
Although she received $448 monthly in disability, the couple could not afford 
to keep their Costa Mesa apartment. Rolando was also unemployed. Trained as an 
architect in his native Bolivia, he has been forced to accept on-again, 
off-again construction work because he does not have the credentials to 
practice his profession in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The couple stayed in shelters and motels for several weeks before entering the 
interfaith shelter network program last December, with exactly $7.19 in their 
pockets. 
</P>
<P>
While in the program, they were offered job skills counseling and were expected 
to look for work and establish a savings plan to cover deposits that would be 
necessary for an apartment or house. 
</P>
<P>
Munoz's job search -- which would have been difficult anyway because of her 
disability -- was made even harder, she said, because she did not have the 
resources that most people can call on, like a closet full of clothes or a 
bathroom and kitchen steps away. 
</P>
<P>
That put her at a disadvantage in vying for positions for which she was 
qualified -- in areas such as sales, computer work and personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"The types of jobs I was looking for you need a new suit, shoes, even a brief 
case," she said. "You can't go in tennis shoes and torn jeans." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, clerical positions are a "hard place" for homeless job applicants, 
Zavetsky said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's because you need the right clothes and a certain appearance," she 
explained. "But some areas, like industrial labor and construction, are much 
easier, especially for permanent placement." 
</P>
<P>
Zavetsky estimated that 5% to 10% of the job applicants who come to her firm 
are homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest problems they face are transportation, obtaining clean clothes and 
work shoes, and keeping themselves presentable while living in often unhygienic 
surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
Zavetsky said her company supplies its homeless clients with bus tokens and 
proper clothes and shoes. The company also keep lists of shelters -- so clients 
won't have to spend a night on the streets -- and of volunteers who will 
provide showers. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I got involved I had no idea there were so many homeless people in 
Orange County," Zavetsky said. "These are people who are trying to get started 
or are knocked off their feet, and they need a helping hand." 
</P>
<P>
For Rolando and SuEllen Munoz, the shelter program has provided a springboard. 
They have been able to save more than $4,500, said SuEllen, who proudly pointed 
out the entry in a savings account book. 
</P>
<P>
"We came in with no wings, and now they have grown back," said Rolando Munoz, 
helped along by the kindness and generosity of shelter program volunteers who 
had initially been strangers to them. 
</P>
<P>
At the Community United Methodist Church in Huntington Beach, the last stop in 
the program, the couple showed off the boxes of clothing, furniture, dishes, 
and other items that have been donated to them during the stay. 
</P>
<P>
They were planning to spend about 45 days in a hotel -- courtesy of one of 
Rolando's previous employers -- before moving into their new apartment. Once 
settled, they plan to become involved as volunteers in next year's shelter 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"The program has taught us that we still love ourselves and that we can give of 
ourselves," SuEllen said.

Little more than 24 hours after a teen-ager was shot to death by suspected gang 
members at a party, a 15-year-old boy attending another party a few blocks away 
was fatally shot and his companion wounded in a drive-by attack Sunday that 
police say also had gang ties. 
</P>
<P>
Youths identified by family members as Cesar Salgado, 15, and companion Javier 
Torres, 18, were shot about 12:50 a.m. near a birthday party they were 
attending in the 600 block of East Walnut Street. 
</P>
<P>
One or more people in a passing vehicle opened fire on the two as they walked 
on a sidewalk in the 100 block of South Hickory Street, Police Sgt. Randy 
Eldridge said. Salgado, shot three times in the side, was pronounced dead at 
UCI Medical Center in Orange at 3:10 a.m. Sunday. Torres, shot once in the 
back, was in stable condition Sunday at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, 17-year-old Roger Ochoa died after being shot four times in the 
back during a fight with suspected gang members at a party in the 1200 block of 
East 3rd Street, about nine blocks away from the Sunday morning shooting site. 
</P>
<P>
While investigators tried to determine whether there were any links between the 
two shootings, residents of the crime-ridden barrio neighborhoods where the 
parties took place decried the continuing gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not an uncommon thing to hear that another young person has been shot or 
killed," said Yolanda Gaodamez, 43, Ochoa's aunt. "It's getting worse every 
day. It is senseless." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Daniel H. Young repeated his concern Sunday over continuing gang violence 
in Santa Ana, and called on parents to try to help steer their children away 
from gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to let them know (that) the consequences of allowing their son or 
daughter to be involved in a gang is to be killed," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor added that he was not surprised to hear of one gang-related shooting 
in Santa Ana following another so closely. 
</P>
<P>
"When the shooting starts, it sets off a chain reaction," Young said. "Our 
experience is that one shooting leads to a number of shootings because it's 
gangs retaliating against one another." 
</P>
<P>
The motive for the Sunday morning attack remained under investigation Sunday. 
Eldridge said detectives were looking at all possibilities, including any 
connection to Friday's attack. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no rhyme or reason to these shootings," said Mike Alvarado, a 
detective at the scene of Sunday's attack. "Anybody can drive through here and 
start shooting." 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the shots were fired from a blue van containing several people. 
Police recovered an abandoned vehicle matching the description of the van but 
have not identified any suspects, Eldridge said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers Saturday had arrested three suspected gang members in connection with 
Friday's shooting. In a separate gang-related incident early Saturday in 
Anaheim, police were still looking Sunday for suspects in a knifing attack on 
three young men. 
</P>
<P>
One of the wounded men in that incident was airlifted to Long Beach Memorial 
Medical Center, and the others were taken to the UCI Medical Center, a fire 
department spokeswoman said. Police have declined to give names of the victims 
or update their conditions. Police said the men were stabbed when a 
gang-related fight broke out between separate groups of young men at a party. 
</P>
<P>
The Sunday shooting took place in a neighborhood known by police and residents 
as territory controlled by the Lopers street gang. Friday's shooting occurred 
in what Gaodamez and other residents described as Eastside gang territory. 
</P>
<P>
The Lopers have had running feuds with the Eastside gang, as well as other 
Santa Ana gangs, said Jose Munoz, 26, a longtime resident of East Walnut Street 
in the Lopers' neighborhood. The Sunday birthday party was held behind an 
apartment complex by members of the Lopers, Munoz said. Several Lopers 
interviewed said they had no idea who was behind the Sunday attack. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time we have a party, we get shot at," said one professed Lopers member 
who spoke on condition of anonymity. "We don't ever start fights. We just kick 
back, and they come and shoot us. We don't even have guns. We'd rather settle 
things with our fists." 
</P>
<P>
The gang member, along with two other professed Lopers who also did not want to 
be named, identified Torres as a longtime Lopers member whose gang name is 
"Shorty." Salgado, whose street name is "Night Owl," was a member of the nearby 
Middleside gang and was invited to the party along with a group of other 
Middleside gang members, the three Lopers said. 
</P>
<P>
Salgado and Torres had stepped away from the party for a walk when the shooting 
started. Neighbors reported hearing from five to 10 shots, possibly from two 
pistols. Angel Barrios, 13, who also attended the party, said the van was 
driving west on East Walnut Street when the shots rang out. 
</P>
<P>
The people in the van "didn't say nothing," Barrios said. "They just drove 
away."

STREET SMART: INCOMPATIBLE SIGNALS CREATE BOTTLENECK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY

<TEXT>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
There is a traffic snafu on Paularino Avenue and Bear Street just north of the 
Corona del Mar Freeway in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
When the left-turn light on Paularino westbound turns green to allow traffic to 
head south onto Bear, a signal light just a hundred or so feet down Bear turns 
red. This light controls traffic getting onto and off the northbound Corona del 
Mar Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The result of the behavior by these two lights is that traffic backs up to 
Paularino, creating a real gridlock situation. I think if they synchronized the 
lights a little better, we wouldn't have these problems. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Niemiec 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
The trouble here is just a simple lack of communication -- between some traffic 
signals. 
</P>
<P>
That turn signal at Paularino Avenue is controlled by the city of Costa Mesa. 
The uncooperative signal light that meters traffic at the intersection of Bear 
Street and the freeway's on- and off-ramps is the property of the California 
Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
William Morris, Costa Mesa director of public services, said the switching 
mechanisms at the two intersections are not mechanically compatible. The result 
is a situation where the signals "do not talk that well with each other," he 
said, producing a synchronization problem and the daily gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
There's hope. Morris said plans are in the works to upgrade the Caltrans signal 
so it will work better with the light at Paularino Avenue. However, the new 
signal, which may cost as much as $20,000, is "a good year away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
In February, I was pulled over and issued a citation. The law I violated was 
one prohibiting altered license plates. What I had done was put a hyphen 
between the characters, thus altering my personalized license plates from their 
original form. 
</P>
<P>
I corrected the problem by removing the hyphen and went to the nearest police 
station to have this citation signed off. The police told me that I would have 
to appear in court and that they could not just sign this type of violation 
off. 
</P>
<P>
I am employed as a paralegal, and as such I went to work to find what this 
certain code section entailed. Much to my amazement, this violation is 
punishable as a misdemeanor and, at times, as a felony -- what the courts call 
a "wobbler." 
</P>
<P>
At my arraignment, the judge refused to dismiss the violation, leaving me 
little choice but to plead not guilty to this violation. To make a long story 
short, I was finally able to have this case dismissed in the interest of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I know some of your readers are also in violation of the vehicle code 
section. I see license plates in the likes of "TOM'S CAR" and "MR. BIG" with 
punctuation marks painted or otherwise placed on the plates. 
</P>
<P>
The moral of my story is this: Never alter your license plates in any way, 
shape or form. What I thought to be an infraction turned out to be more than I 
bargained for. So unless your readers are prepared to sit countless hours in a 
courtroom, miss untold hours of work and possibly be threatened with the 
thought of jail if the judge doesn't like you, they should never, never alter 
their license plates. 
</P>
<P>
Larry H. Corbett Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
You certainly know your license plate law. 
</P>
<P>
And any motorists who think they can get away with a slyly placed hyphen or 
comma better think twice. Last year, the California Highway Patrol issued 205 
tickets to motorists in the state for altered license plates, said Steve 
Kohler, an agency spokesman. That doesn't even include the tickets issued by 
the various municipal police forces around the state. 
</P>
<P>
There is, of course, a reason for the law. "It's a legibility matter," said 
Kohler. "It could confuse someone if a car is involved in a hit-and-run 
accident or some other type of incident in which the vehicle needed to be 
identified."

EMINENT DOMAIN IS BUYING ILL WILL; 
</P>
<P>
LAND-USE: SOME SAY LAGUNA BEACH HAS STEPPED TOO FAR IN ITS EFFORTS FOR OPEN 
SPACE.

LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a city flexes its legislative muscle, forcing a property owner to sell 
land to the government, it's usually to make way for a school, road or other 
public construction project. 
</P>
<P>
Not so in this quaint, seaside community where city officials' greatest concern 
is the feverish residential development raging at its borders. Here, the City 
Council recently began using eminent domain -- the government's authority to 
purchase land from unwilling sellers -- to prevent anyone from ever building on 
it. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, Laguna Beach is in the process of buying up about 500 acres of 
privately owned, canyon countryside from three different owners, apparently the 
first city in Orange County to use eminent domain as a tool for preserving open 
space. 
</P>
<P>
With $10 million of state money at its disposal to acquire natural parkland, 
the city has set its sights on padding the "greenbelt," a natural buffer of 
rugged terrain that isolates the village community from its neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Alarmed by the massive, 20,000-home Aliso Viejo development springing up next 
door and a 3,200-home Irvine Co. project proposed for Laguna Canyon, 
environmentalists believe that the small-town atmosphere of Laguna Beach is 
under siege. 
</P>
<P>
"When people see what happens out there," City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said, 
referring to the 6,600-acre Aliso Viejo development, "they're going to thank 
God for all this open space." The development is expected to house 50,000 
residents by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
While environmentalists countywide have applauded the city's unusual efforts to 
stem the tide of development enveloping Orange County, others have criticized 
the practice as a backdoor approach to promoting slow-growth policies. 
</P>
<P>
John DeWitt, a San Gabriel Valley oil dealer who was recently forced to sell 
200 acres and a small home in picturesque Laguna Canyon, is one such critic. 
DeWitt offered to sell for $2.5 million, but the city appraised his land at $1 
million. Since the two sides have been unable to reach an agreement, the fair 
market value will be determined in court. Meanwhile, the city put down a 
$1-million deposit and officially took possession of the property last month. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach officials have invited the public to a May 6 hike across DeWitt's 
former property for a firsthand look at the city's new purchase. 
</P>
<P>
"They're gloating over it already," said a bitter DeWitt."I have dealt with a 
lot of regulators, environmental and others, but I have never had this 
experience in my life." 
</P>
<P>
DeWitt, who bought the property off Laguna Canyon Road 15 years ago as an 
investment, calls $1 million for the land a "gift." He co-owns the land with 
Alice Platz of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone in the city is saying that we'll get paid what it's worth, but 
they're not willing to pay what my partner and I think it's worth," DeWitt 
said. "They (officials) call Laguna Canyon the Yosemite of Laguna, but I think 
it's more the pull-up-the-drawbridge approach. We got ours and now no one else 
is going to get theirs." 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Frank disagrees. "We have had a long history of negotiating the 
sale with the owners and not having to use eminent domain," he said. "But this 
time they (the owners) were basing their selling price on zoning that isn't and 
won't ever be on that property." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the DeWitt property, the city recently used eminent domain to take nine 
acres off Laguna Canyon Road owned by Leisure World developer Ross Cortese. The 
city has also begun proceedings to acquire 235 acres in Hobo Canyon in South 
Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike affluent Laguna Beach, many cities cannot afford to buy open space. They 
extract what open areas they can from developers in exchange for permission to 
build in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach however, was awarded $10 million last year through Proposition 70, 
a $776-million bond issue for parkland and wildlife protection. Last year, the 
city spent $4 million on nearly 471 acres in Laguna Beach Heights, then set 
about identifying open areas along Laguna Canyon Road for purchase. 
</P>
<P>
The Constitution gives government the authority to take property under private 
ownership for public use provided that the owner is given just compensation. 
However, there is some debate over whether open space justifies the taking of 
private property. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a question of open space being regarded as a critical enough public 
purpose worthy of resorting to eminent domain," said Irvine Mayor Larry Agran. 
"It certainly is." 
</P>
<P>
Adds slow-growth activist Tom Rogers: "I'm trying to think who else in the 
world would care about such a thing. With many of the other cities, the reverse 
is true: They're trying to give away open space to the developers." 
</P>
<P>
Yet opponents describe Laguna's use of eminent domain as stripping a property 
owner of his rights for no good reason. 
</P>
<P>
"You're talking about a situation where, arguably, there is no public use 
benefit except aesthetics," said Daniel R. Wildish, an Orange attorney. "It may 
be a situation where they are really, in a backdoor way, trying to enact 
slow-growth or no-growth policies." 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Lucas, president of the Laguna Canyon Homeowners Assn., is one of the few 
who sees both sides. Lucas generally supports the city's use of eminent domain 
to acquire open space but believes that DeWitt was treated unfairly. After 
negotiating with the association, Lucas said, DeWitt had offered to give the 
city about 170 acres along the ridgeline in exchange for permission to develop 
the lower portion of his land. 
</P>
<P>
"We could have had it for free. Instead, we paid $1 million," Lucas said. "I 
think if we don't start making a way for open space and green areas, we're not 
going to have anything left. But people have rights, too."

million it was appraised at. MARK BOSTER / Los Angeles Times

PROGRAM LAUNCHED TO COMBAT CAR THEFT

<TEXT>
<P>
In response to a burgeoning auto theft problem, the Police Department has 
launched an innovative new program that calls on residents to give officers 
permission to stop their cars if they are spotted on the road during early 
morning hours. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Richard Tefank said the program is intended for people who do not 
usually drive their cars between 1 and 5 a.m. He said participants in the 
program will be given a small bumper sticker as a signal to patrol officers 
that the vehicle should not normally be operating during that period. 
</P>
<P>
The participants will also be required to sign a form authorizing police to 
stop their vehicles if they are spotted on the road during those hours. 
</P>
<P>
Operation CAT, which stands for Combat Auto Theft, is also being conducted in 
Huntington Beach. It was unveiled by Buena Park police last week. 
</P>
<P>
The program is aimed primarily at personal vehicles, but Tefank said the police 
hope to eventually include business cars or trucks and heavy equipment. 
</P>
<P>
According to police statistics, the number of auto thefts in Buena Park has 
increased from 702 in 1986 to 1,024 in 1989. Tefank said one of the reasons 
that the statistics are getting worse is victim apathy. 
</P>
<P>
If their car is stolen, people think "I get a new car," Tefank said. 
</P>
<P>
Operation CAT is being operated in association with the Automobile Club of 
Southern California, which is providing the bumper stickers. Representatives 
from the Automobile Club said their auto insurance services paid about $13 
million in claims on stolen cars in Southern California last year. 
</P>
<P>
People interested in signing up for the program must bring their car and 
registration to the Police Department. LYNDA NATALI

CITY WIDENS POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN

<P>
The City Council has given initial approval to extending the city's ability to 
acquire property in a Beach Boulevard redevelopment area. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance would allow the city to use its power of eminent domain on 26 
parcels along a one-mile stretch of Beach Boulevard from the Riverside Freeway 
to La Palma Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The original ordinance allowed the city to use eminent domain on only six 
parcels in the area known as the Entertainment Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
Sally Wachi, whose mother owns an International House of Pancakes restaurant in 
the area, asked the council to remember the business owners. 
</P>
<P>
"This piece of property is her sole source of income," Wachi said. "What is 
going to happen?" 
</P>
<P>
Officials assured Wachi that merchants would be treated fairly. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to start condemning property at 8 o'clock in the morning," 
Mayor Donald L. Bone said. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for the property have not even been considered, said May Hui of the 
Economic Development Department. "We just wanted to make that tool available," 
Hui said. 
</P>
<P>
Under eminent domain, public agencies may buy property at fair market value 
without consent of the owners. If fair market value is disputed, the matter is 
settled in the courts. LYNDA NATALI

TRUCK-THEFT SUSPECT RAMS CAR IN CHASE

<P>
A motorist being pursued by police on Saturday night crashed a stolen pickup 
truck after ramming a patrol car and driving through a fence, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The motorist, James Scott Blazevich, 27, identified by police as a transient 
formerly of Garden Grove, was held in Cypress City Jail on suspicion of felony 
assault of a police officer, possession of stolen property and reckless 
evading. 
</P>
<P>
His bail was set at $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
The chase started about 9:25 p.m. Saturday when Patrolman Tom Bruce spotted the 
suspect driving erratically in a 1980 Toyota pickup truck near the intersection 
of Knott and Cerritos avenues, Cypress Police Sgt. John Avila said. The suspect 
speeded up as Bruce tried to pull him over. 
</P>
<P>
During a brief but wild chase, Avila said, the suspect rammed an Orange County 
sheriff's vehicle assisting in the pursuit and drove through a railroad 
retaining fence. The chase ended when the suspect crashed the truck into a tree 
on Katella Avenue east of Beach Boulevard, Avila said. JIM CARLTON

Oscar Taylor is a downtown property owner and a lifelong Huntington Beach 
resident, but he is a stubborn opponent of the city's plan to revamp his aging 
block with a $1.2-million redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm kind of an anarchist," said Taylor, 69. 
</P>
<P>
"I think anything to do with government is a bunch of nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
But Taylor and another resistant property owner, once part of an indignant 
front opposing the city's efforts, now find themselves in the minority. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Redevelopment Agency has persuaded all of the other 10 property 
owners in the area to participate in the improvement project after nearly two 
decades of feuds and ever-changing plans to revitalize the area. 
</P>
<P>
Those who participate are eligible to receive grants of $20,000 to $100,000 to 
spruce up their buildings and make them structurally sound. Some of the owners 
plan to give their properties a new facade. Many plan to use the money to 
overhaul their buildings, said Keith Bohr, the agency's project manager. The 
project is bounded by Main and 5th streets and Olive and Walnut avenues. 
</P>
<P>
But to receive a grant, owners are required to make improvements that conform 
to the agency's guidelines. The agency determines the new color and style of 
the buildings, how they will be maintained, the size and type of signs used and 
what types of businesses can be tenants there. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor and Douglas Langevin, the other owner who has rejected the city's 
offers, argue that the compromises they would be required to make under the 
program are unreasonable. 
</P>
<P>
"The city can make any color changes they want and can do other things that are 
very, very restrictive," Langevin said. "The only options left for us are how 
to collect rent and pay taxes." JOHN PENNER

MIKE PENNER: DECENT DRAFT STILL A BIG DEAL TO THE RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rams always traded better than they drafted, a double-edged sword that came 
back to wound and then suture on Sunday, all within the span of a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
For the first three rounds of the 1990 NFL draft, Coach John Robinson announced 
his team's selections with all the enthusiasm of a man required to tell his 
family he'd just been transferred to Yuma. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson on No. 1 pick, Washington center Bern Brostek: "We chose him because 
we felt like he was the best offensive lineman there." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson on No. 2 pick, Notre Dame safety Pat Terrell: "We did not feel there 
were any corners worthy to be picked there." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson on No. 3 pick, Oregon running back Latin Berry: "We're going to use 
him as a kick returner and a defensive corner. . . . We're taking a risk. We're 
giving him a year to learn a new position. It could be a reach, but with that 
kind of speed and that kind of person, it's worth the risk." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson didn't size up the draft so much as sighs it up. He had reason to be 
underwhelmed. Two out of three selections were gambles and the last time the 
Rams rolled the dice without a safety net -- also known as Draft Choices for 
Dickerson -- they came up snake eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Schad and Donald Evans. 
</P>
<P>
Brostek flunked more than one pre-draft physical because of a congenital back 
condition that left him with three defective disks at the base of the spine. 
</P>
<P>
Berry, an undersized running back with great speed and no moves, is the kind of 
project not often found in altitudes as high as the third round. In asking him 
to convert to cornerback, the Rams are asking Berry to learn a position he has 
never played. 
</P>
<P>
Only Terrell could be termed an impact player. Of course, for most of Sunday, 
his impact was the latest postponement of the Jerry Gray-to-free-safety move, a 
grand plan that may never get off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"An hour ago, Jerry Gray was a safety-corner," Robinson said as he announced 
the drafting of Terrell. "Now, he's back to corner-safety." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson lamented his inability to draft or trade for a competent cornerback. 
"Ongoing," is how he described the talent search. "I don't have much confidence 
that it's going to happen on draft day. It might go into training camp." 
</P>
<P>
Or at least into Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Two hours later, Robinson sauntered into the press room at Rams Park, beaming. 
"We've just traded our fifth-rounder to the New York Jets for Bobby Humphery," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson grinned again. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a left corner." 
</P>
<P>
And a good one. Humphery, a six-year veteran, started every game for the Jets 
the past two seasons. Ram defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur said the coaching 
staff reviewed film of 13 NFL cornerbacks -- affordable cornerbacks in the 
mid-size price and talent range -- and claimed Humphery was the top of the 
crop. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives us the experience that we want," Robinson said. "He's the corner 
that fits us. This is a great deal for us." 
</P>
<P>
And for the cost of a fifth-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was asked if the price was right. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson simply grinned that burglar's grin of his. 
</P>
<P>
Enough said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the trade that saved the day. With Humphery pairing with Darryl Henley 
at cornerback, Gray can resume Operation Safety, returning to his natural 
position, the position that made him All-American at the University of Texas. 
At the same time, Terrell and Berry can learn their wares in reserve roles. 
Berry, particularly, will need the time. 
</P>
<P>
The trade also frees up Greg Bell, the two-time 1,000-yard rusher who had been 
the team's primary trade enticement in the cornerback market. Now, Bell can be 
used elsewhere, perhaps in exchange for a 1991 draft choice or packaged for 
some pass-rush assistance, something the Rams ignored in Sunday's first three 
rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, though, the trade salvaged the draft. Before Humphery, the media 
knives were poised to slice again. 
</P>
<P>
On draft day, these guys love the long ball. Just close your eyes and air it 
out. Maybe our side will catch it. 
</P>
<P>
Supposedly, Pete Rose is the one with the gambling disorder. What, then, is the 
word for the Rams' affliction? While the draft clock ticks away, you can't keep 
the Rams away from the blackjack table -- and, worse yet, you can't keep them 
from hitting 17. 
</P>
<P>
The reason the Eric Dickerson trade was so great for the Rams was that it gave 
them the wherewithal -- six extra choices -- to sate their whims and fancies. 
Waste a No. 1 on Gaston Green? No problem. Just circle back a few slots later 
and scoop up Aaron Cox. 
</P>
<P>
But they squared their account with the Colts last year, meaning they would 
have to enter this draft alone. No more insurance policy. No second chances 
permitted. 
</P>
<P>
So the Rams went about their business their traditional way, flailing away, and 
still might live to tell about it. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, it was Houston and Jim Everett. In 1987, it was Indianapolis and the 
draft-choice giveaway. And in 1990, it's the New York Jets and Bobby Humphery. 
</P>
<P>
By now, it's no trade secret. The Rams always have survived and thrived on the 
kindness of strangers.

TITAN LINEUP CHANGE PAYS OFF IN SERIES SWEEP OVER UNLV

<P>
Moving to the top of the Cal State Fullerton baseball lineup has been a step up 
for Phil Nevin and the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
Nevin hit two home runs from the leadoff spot to lead Cal State Fullerton to a 
6-1 victory over Nevada Las Vegas in a Big West Conference baseball game 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Nevin was moved from the No. 3 spot to the leadoff spot March 22 against 
Illinois, and he is intent on staying there. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it a lot," he said. "You get to see a lot more pitches, because 
pitchers don't pitch around you -- they don't want to put the leadoff batter on 
base. When a pitcher gets behind you in the count, you see a lot of fastballs." 
</P>
<P>
You also get to see a lot of curveballs, which Nevin saw Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Nevin's first home run led off the third inning to give Fullerton a 2-1 lead. 
The second was a wind-aided fly ball that cleared the center-field fence and 
gave Fullerton a 4-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave the Titans (25-16, 8-1) a three-game sweep of the series and 
extended their winning streak to seven games. 
</P>
<P>
"No doubt, we're playing the best ball of the year," Fullerton Coach Larry 
Cochell said. "We got off to a bad start by anybody's standards, but we're 
finally getting good defense and timely hitting at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton had 11 hits, including a solo home run by Frank Charles and three 
singles by Mate Borgogno. Nevin replaced Borgogno in the leadoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
Huck Flener (7-1) pitched a five-hitter. And although the Titans made two 
errors, Flener was helped by a diving catch by right fielder David Ayala in the 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Jarolimek took the loss, allowing six runs and seven hits in 5 2/3 
innings for Las Vegas (24-18, 5-6). 
</P>
<P>
In another Big West Conference baseball game: 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine 12, Cal State Long Beach 11 (11 innings) -- Host Irvine rallied twice 
and ended its three-game losing streak. The Anteaters trailed, 10-2, entering 
the bottom of the seventh inning and, 11-10, in the 11th. UCI (27-20, 5-7) 
scored three in the seventh and five in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Combs led off the ninth inning with a home run. Irvine pulled to within 
one when Ed Luna, drove in two runs with a single and Chris Gallego doubled in 
a run. Combs' sacrifice fly scored Gallego to tie the score, 10-10. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach (29-18, 6-6) scored a run in the 11th inning, but Billy Bardens 
drove in Jon Skaggs on a single to tie the score again and Gallego's sacrifice 
fly scored Bardens.

SECTION GETS POINT, DROPS RATING SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern Section administrators have eliminated the power-rating point system 
used last season to select at-large teams for the section's boys' and girls' 
basketball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the point system, the Southern Section now will have at-large 
candidates for its 10 boys' and girls' divisions play each other for the 
remaining spots. The boys' teams will play on the Tuesday after the regular 
season ends and the girls will play Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Our tournament is like Indiana's now," said Dean Crowley, associate section 
commissioner. "We're an open tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"The point system was just not workable. We (the advisory committee) decided 
that the best way to determine things is on the basketball court." 
</P>
<P>
The top three teams from each league receive automatic playoff berths. The rest 
of the brackets are filled by at-large teams. 
</P>
<P>
Under the point system, at-large teams were selected on the following criteria: 
</P>
<P>
 -- One point for scheduling any team above a school's division. For example, 
if a team such as Laguna Beach (2-A) plays in a league of 3-A and 4-A teams, 
Laguna Beach will receive a point for playing each game. The school also would 
receive points for scheduling nonleague games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One point for defeating any team in a higher division. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One point for defeating an eventual league champion or co-champion, 
regardless of division. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One point for winning a non-league tournament championship. 
</P>
<P>
The system was used for the first time in last season's playoffs and created 
several problems. 
</P>
<P>
Teams such as Mayfair (0-22), La Quinta (2-20) and Costa Mesa (2-19) were among 
the 285 teams who made the playoffs. Loara (15-7), which finished fourth in the 
Empire League, was left out of the 4-AA division. Meanwhile, Cypress (7-15), 
which finished last in the Empire League and lost twice to Loara, earned an 
at-large bid in the 4-A division. 
</P>
<P>
Loara Coach Jerry Halpin worked with the Southern Section advisory committee 
that proposed the format change. He said the open format will be fair to all 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
"Because the Southern Section classifications are tied to state enrollment, we 
had to do something to open the tournament up," Halpin said. "It will be only 
one more game for each team. A lot of people asked why should we have a regular 
season if we have an open tournament? I think people need to get used to it. A 
few years ago everyone was complaining about the three-point shot." 
</P>
<P>
Under the point system, Loara received only nine points despite winning the 
Garden Grove and Pacifica tournaments. Ventura (8-17), the last team admitted 
to the 4-AA playoffs, had 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
"The league games kept us out," Halpin said. "The 4-AA teams that made it in 
ahead of us played in leagues against bigger schools. We only got one point for 
winning each of the tournaments, and we beat teams like (3-AA champion) 
Estancia and Western." 
</P>
<P>
Crowley said awarding points to schools for scheduling games against larger 
schools wasn't fair. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always said these things should be decided on the court," Crowley said. 
"Laguna Beach was a great team and (it) made the playoffs. But suppose Laguna 
Beach hadn't won a game this year; it would have had a lot of points because it 
plays larger schools in the Pacific Coast League. The system just wasn't 
totally equitable to everyone involved." 
</P>
<P>
Crowley said the Southern Section will rename its 10 divisions to match the 
state tournament's format. In the past, the largest Southern Section division 
was 5-AA, and the state tournament's largest one was Division I. The largest 
Southern Section division will now be named I-AA, followed by I-A, II-AA, etc. 
</P>
<P>
Go figure: Is Cal State Fullerton recruiting Mater Dei guard Jason Quinn? It 
depends on who you're talking to. 
</P>
<P>
Said Mater Dei Coach Gary McKnight: "Cal State Fullerton was looking at him and 
so was Southern California College. I think he can rule Fullerton out. There's 
a miscommunication there. A lot of Division II schools talked to him and 
Fullerton was looking at him." 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton Coach John Sneed said: "I don't know why Gary keeps telling 
the press that Jason Quinn is going to Fullerton. We're not recruiting him. 
I've never talked to him and he's never visited our school." 
</P>
<P>
Other Mater Dei news: McKnight said guard David Boyle has been offered a 
scholarship by Chapman College and also visited UC Davis and Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo. Forward Andy Karich signed with Santa Clara, center Derek Stone with 
Boise State and forward Charlie Andres is walking on at California, McKnight 
said. Reserve Paul Nolan announced that he will play at Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Dreibelbis was surprised when he learned Katella junior Kevin Carlson tied 
his county high jump record Thursday with a leap of 6 feet 11 3/4 inches in a 
dual meet against Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
"I was amazed," Dreibelbis said. "No one ever goes for that height in a meet." 
</P>
<P>
Most high jumpers go for the magical 7-foot mark, which is what Dreibelbis did 
seven years ago when he competed for Foothill at the Mt. San Antonio College 
Relays. 
</P>
<P>
"I was up against a guy from the Australian national high school team," 
Dreibelbis said. "I tried twice at 7 feet and missed, and he missed three 
times. Then I made it on my third jump, but I just nicked the bar. When the 
officials remeasured it after my jump, it was only 6-11 3/4." 
</P>
<P>
Dreibelbis went on to clear 7 feet at UC Santa Barbara. He was a two-time PCAA 
champion, clearing 7- 3/4 as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
Dreibelbis, now a laboratory engineer in Tustin, said his share of the record 
probably won't last much longer. 
</P>
<P>
"Carlson's only a junior?" Dreibelbis asked. "He'll probably break the record 
by the end of the year." 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta baseball Coach Dave Demarest gained his 300th career victory 
Wednesday when the Aztecs defeated visiting Garden Grove, 6-1, in a Garden 
Grove League game. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even know how many wins I had until a couple of weeks ago," said 
Demarest, who has compiled a 301-120 record in 17 years at La Quinta. "I was 
filling out forms for the Far West Classic (tournament) and the questionnaire 
asked what the coach's career record was. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to look back through old programs. I saw that I was 286-114. We went 
13-6 in the tournament. I didn't even tell the team about the (career) record." 
</P>
<P>
Demarest averaged nearly 18 victories a season with teams rarely larger than 13 
players. 
</P>
<P>
Gonna fly now: In Thursday's Century League swim meet between Villa Park and El 
Modena, John Clearly swam the butterfly during the 200 freestyle. He finished 
second (2:04.88) to teammate Josh Woolery (1:54.31). 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park Coach Jeff Ehrlich said Clearly's change in stroke was legal. 
</P>
<P>
"High school meets don't have a 200 butterfly and John wanted to get a time in 
the event because he may swim it in college," Ehrlich said. "This was his 
chance to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Surprise, surprise: No one gave Newport Harbor's baseball team much of a chance 
when the Sailors played Tustin, the county's top-ranked team, in a Sea View 
League game last week. The unranked Sailors were only 5-14 overall and 3-4 in 
the league, and Tustin was 15-2, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
But Newport Harbor pitcher Bob Sliker had other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Sliker pitched a three-hitter in a 4-0 victory at Newport Harbor. Sliker (4-3) 
also was three for three as the Sailors had nine hits off Tustin starter Danny 
Baker. 
</P>
<P>
But Tustin had all the hitting two days later, with 19 hits in a 22-0 victory.

<P>
'ARDEN' -- A COLORFUL SUBJECT, A BLAND PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One can see the attraction. 
</P>
<P>
A play about one of Orange County's famous and colorful residents had to be 
alluring to Orange County's top theater. With its sparse but witty zingers, 
Richard Hellesen's "Once in Arden" probably read beautifully on the page. And 
typically, South Coast Repertory has spared no technical blandishment to bring 
it to the stage. 
</P>
<P>
But theater can be perverse. Despite eloquent sets by Deborah Raymond and 
Dorian Vernacchio, elegant costumes by Dwight Richard Odle, splendid Chopin 
renditions (by Paderewski?) bridging the scene changes, and effort by director 
Martin Benson to huff and puff some life into the piece, "Once in Arden" just 
lies there, stillborn. 
</P>
<P>
It is from the outset a linear biography. That is to say, it embroiders on 
certain facts in the career and existence of Polish actress Helena Modjeska, 
who settled in the then-German community of Anaheim in 1876, making her 
English-speaking debut a year later in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Additional facts are these: In 1883, Modjeska bought a ranch in Santiago Canyon 
near Santa Ana (later renamed Modjeska Canyon in her honor). With her husband, 
Count Karol (Charlie) Bozenta Chlapowski, a some-time politician and critic, 
she continued to tour successfully -- and to make and spend several fortunes, 
eventually falling on hard times. Modjeska had helped to encourage and launch 
the concert career of Polish pianist Ignacy Paderewski, who presumably repaid 
the gesture by arranging a testimonial (read benefit) for her at the Met in 
1905 -- four years before her death at 69. 
</P>
<P>
Hellesen builds his play around that testimonial, using it as the basis for a 
great deal of talk about art versus commerce, integrity versus compromise. It 
is triggered (at least here) by a lucrative offer from one J. T. Liddell. He 
wants Modjeska, a class act, to appear on the vaudeville circuit somewhere 
between the trained monkeys and the circus dogs. ("Shakespeare by the piece -- 
like chicken?" she sniffs, disdainfully.) 
</P>
<P>
Doing vaudeville is something her sparring partner at the testimonial -- the 
celebrated James O'Neill, father of Eugene -- has no trouble with. But Modjeska 
-- the classical actress, the dedicated artist, the noble soul -- is somewhat 
hypocritically torn asunder. It strikes her as too blatant, too much of a 
come-down, though the money would be nice. And we gather that she had fewer 
compunctions endorsing certain products for money, which, as the wily and 
pragmatic Liddell points out, was not any less commercial an undertaking. 
Liddell's pressure is far more convincing than her resistance to it. 
</P>
<P>
Does she or doesn't she in the end? For all the talk we never quite find out. 
So "Once in Arden's" only big decision is never adequately explored. The play 
lacks tensile strength. Everything in it is too soft and predictable. Hellesen 
writes around his subject rather than to it, endlessly circling his prey but 
never coming in for the kill. Here and there he strikes pay dirt with a 
one-liner ("I used to think the worst thing was missing an entrance," says 
Modjeska, keenly aware of her mortality. "Now I think it is missing an exit"). 
But one-liners do not a play make. 
</P>
<P>
Nan Martin, a consummate actress, is rather lost as Modjeska, never finding a 
balance between the woman's true or assumed nobility -- or, for that matter, 
between talking straight American (as when she recites Lady Macbeth's speeches) 
or conversing in some strange accent that doesn't even sound Polish. One or the 
other, please, but not both. 
</P>
<P>
Hellesen has wanted to paint Modjeska as a person of principle torn by need, 
but in the end he succeeds only in showing us a human being who says one thing 
while doing (or potentially doing) another. It would have been healthier for 
the play if he had scuttled the reverential stance for an approach as 
ruthlessly honest as Liddell's. Perhaps then we would have had the much more 
complex motivations of arrogance and vanity rationalizing need, which might 
have made for a livelier play. This probably explains why Liddell is the truest 
character in this piece, though the fact that he happens to be performed by Ron 
Boussom is a potent other factor; Boussom remains one of South Coast's most 
versatile and valuable actors in virtually any role. 
</P>
<P>
For the rest, Charles Hallahan delivers a blustery, chivalrous and aptly 
stentorian O'Neill and Kay E. Kuter an absent-minded professor type as husband 
Charlie. But Patrick Husted, as the vaguely defined Paderewski, only looks 
cross and preoccupied. Henry Leyva is fine as a stage assistant. But the play 
is a yawn. 
</P>

Missing Lines -- In Sylvie Drake's Monday review of "Once in Arden" at South 
Coast Repertory, some lines were omitted. Writing of the predicament faced by 
the protagonist Helena Modjeska as to whether to appear in vaudeville, Drake 
wrote: 
</P>
<P>
Does she or doesn't she in the end? For all the talk we never quite find out. 
So "Once in Arden's" only big decision is never adequately explored. The play 
lacks tensile strength. Everything in it is too soft and predictable. Hellesen 
writes around his subject rather than to it, endlessly circling his prey but 
never coming in for the kill. . . .

A Tomorrow for 'Today's' Norville: Deborah Norville will remain the host of the 
"Today" show, NBC officials said, denying a published report that the network 
has considered moving her to the weekend evening news. New York Newsday 
reported in its Saturday editions that NBC's top executives were planning to 
make the change because of the show's poor ratings and network affiliates' 
dissatisfaction with Norville's performance. NBC news officials blamed the 
report on rumors and speculation. GREG BRAXTON

Final Act for Whole Theater: It's curtains for the Whole Theater, which rose to 
national prominence with a push from its co-founder, Olympia Dukakis. The board 
of trustees for the Montclair, N.J., theater said the building will have to be 
sold to pay off debts of about $450,000. Officials said the theater's 
association with Dukakis, who won a supporting actress Oscar in 1988 for 
"Moonstruck," may have lulled would-be donors into believing it was financially 
sound. GREG BRAXTON

Inner-City Theater, Jazz Classes: CalArts, Plaza de la Raza and the Watts 
Towers Arts Center will collaborate on two yearlong pilot programs this fall in 
an instructional program of theater and jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Funded by a $40,000 grant from Arco, the two programs will send CalArts theater 
and jazz instructors to the inner city. The Plaza program will culminate with a 
bilingual production of Thornton Wilder's "Our Town" called "Nuestro Barrio" 
next spring. CalArts jazz instructors and master students will work with eight 
high schools in the Watts Towers area to eventually present two jazz concerts 
next spring and possibly form a high school jazz band. GREG BRAXTON

Tell Me, Kate: Acting legend Katharine Hepburn's memoirs are coming out next 
year, according to the Alfred A. Knopf publishing house. The four-time best 
acting Oscar winner and star of the "Philadelphia Story" and "The African 
Queen" -- and other classics -- will reflect on her childhood and family, her 
early days in New York, her long on- and off-screen association with Spencer 
Tracy and working with the leading actors, directors and producers of the past 
50 years. Describing her decision to write the book now, the 80-year-old 
Hepburn said: "It's later than you think!" GREG BRAXTON

POTENT DRAMAS BY MALASHOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>

LA JOLLA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a moment in several John Malashock dance dramas when people grab their 
upturned arms or wrists as if checking an alarming pulse -- afraid that the 
force of unbearable pain might burst out of their bodies at any instant. 
</P>
<P>
And of course it does -- in dancing of the deepest, rawest emotion, dancing in 
which Malashock's cast and audience are swept into the same vortex. Four years 
after forming his own San Diego-based company, this former Tharp dancer is 
becoming a leader in the trend toward pure feeling in choreography, the use of 
movement as an outlet rather than a symbol. You can't think your way through 
his pieces or decode them; you either empathize or you're lost. 
</P>
<P>
At the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art on Friday, Malashock placed the 
four-member Mark Attebery Ensemble on a platform over the last three rows of 
seats in Sherwood Auditorium and also had enormous loudspeakers flanking the 
proscenium. The audience thus sat in a virtual force-field, watching the stage 
but bombarded from all sides by Attebery's score for "Stan's Retreat," a score 
that not only accompanied the dancing but also helped give it a distinctive 
'40s flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Suggested by characters in Carson McCullers' novel "The Heart Is a Lonely 
Hunter," this new, one-act exploration of relationships featured a pair of 
stifled women (the tough, assertive Maj Xander, the yearning, resigned Debi 
Toth) who sometimes resembled Antony Tudor's Hagar and Agnes de Mille's Lizzie 
in their needs and gestural rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
Like Tudor and De Mille, Malashock used lyrical lovers (Bill Doolin and Loni 
Palladino) to highlight the torment of his protagonists. And he himself played 
the catalyst: an outsider desperately searching for love and acceptance. 
Malashock never sentimentalized this search nor let his duets become swoony 
display vehicles. Instead, they remained deliberately abortive, rough-hewn, 
primal -- and unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, Malashock's dances all took place in an engulfing eternal present; 
here, however, his '40s characters actually grew. And their growth was 
expressed not through conventional dance-mime or playacting but by exchanges of 
weight, degrees of synchrony and shared vocabularies: dance values honed by 
Malashock's generation to convey nuance directly, through physical 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
If "Stan's Retreat" represented a major advance for Malashock thematically, his 
new "Take This Waltz" showcased a greatly increased surety of means. His 
sharper compositional sense proved especially inventive in the finale, with one 
couple kneeling in the foreground, gesturally reflecting the surging, 
whole-body statements of two dancers further upstage. Through this unusual 
juxtaposition, Malashock made his ideas doubly potent. 
</P>
<P>
Set to four songs by Leonard Cohen, this study of manipulation kept the 
figures-of-control enigmatic, as is usual with Malashock. Sometimes they seemed 
oppressive (blocking, trapping, forcing participation), but elsewhere benign 
(protecting and guiding someone dangerously out of control). 
</P>
<P>
His familiar "Departure of the Youngsters" (on the same program) depicted 
manipulation as central to an obsessive, inescapable human power struggle: the 
helpless victimized by those In Charge. "Take This Waltz," however, showed how 
people shape others to their needs -- and, in the process, teach them, change 
them and, in turn, are taught and changed. 
</P>
<P>
Malashock's choreography has always focused on the abrasions of relationships, 
but his two premieres on Friday suggested a new sensitivity toward possible 
gains as well as losses. This is a dynamic young artist changing as fast as his 
characters, yet always exciting for the commitment and immediacy of his work. 
</P>
<P>
His dancers and the Attebery musicians are scheduled to repeat this ambitious 
and often powerful program at the Japan America Theatre on May 11 and 12 -- but 
not necessarily with surround sound.

MUSEUMS' MISUNDERSTOOD WORKS;

WHEN CATALOGUES ARE GOOD, THEY CAN BE EXPLANATORY, INSIGHTFUL AND HISTORICAL.

You just saw the exhibit, and now you pop into the bookshop -- to pick up a 
post card of a favorite work of art, maybe, or to browse the magazines or ogle 
the jewelry. But have you considered buying the exhibit catalogue? 
</P>
<P>
Poor things, those exhibition catalogues are possibly the most misunderstood 
and overlooked items museum bookstores stock. To be sure, many are not 
particularly easy to read. Some don't have good illustrations. And the ones 
that aren't printed in soft-bound editions tend to be on the pricey side. 
</P>
<P>
Yet catalogues are perhaps the most important product a museum has to offer. 
Years after a show has come and gone, the catalogue remains to testify to its 
existence and to the reasons it was created in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
One major role of art museums is to interpret art -- to explain what it says 
about the person or culture that made it, to help us appreciate what's there 
and understand what isn't. This is the sort of information that's too bulky and 
distracting to pack into a label on the wall, too complex to be scanned by a 
footsore viewer. 
</P>
<P>
So catalogues are where a museum gets to rack up points for scholarship. The 
curator explains the train of thought that led to selecting particular pieces 
for the show. Essays reinterpret works of art in light of newly discovered 
information, new theories are proposed, and long-held beliefs about the art in 
question are held up to the light to see if they still make sense. 
</P>
<P>
And there's more. A good catalogue for a historical show will include relevant 
essays on the period as a whole. (What was the political situation? How was the 
economy doing? What was playing at the theater? What kind of furniture did 
people have?) 
</P>
<P>
A substantial catalogue about the work of a particular artist will include a 
biographical essay that traces the points at which everyday life and the making 
of art intersected. (Was it easier to work once she moved to the country? Did 
he keep painting his ex-wife's face after the divorce?) 
</P>
<P>
You find out what works of art the artist saw, which other artists he knew and 
how they mayhave influenced -- or hindered -- his work. Although these 
influential works probably aren't includedin the exhibit itself -- because 
they're scattered in collections all over the world, or have been lost or 
destroyed -- they are apt to be illustrated in the catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
In this frantic age, when there are never enough hours in the day to do it all, 
catalogues also serve as substitutes for shows you never got to see, whether 
they opened 3,000 miles away or in your own city. Although you've missed the 
visceral experience of standing in front of the actual work, you do get an idea 
of what it looks like, along with useful information you can browse at your 
leisure. 
</P>
<P>
Living artists benefit from catalogues for obvious reasons: Their work is 
fussed over in print and immortalized in photographs. Collectors not only 
become aware of the breadth of the artist's work -- they also are likely to be 
impressed by seeing it between two covers. ("If the X museum went to the 
trouble to put out a book about it, this work must be good.") 
</P>
<P>
Collectors who already own work by the artist stand to gain by having the piece 
reproduced in a museum catalogue. Again, the piece gains prestige by being 
singled out by the museum, which is likely to be translated into a more 
advantageous price if the collector chooses to sell. 
</P>
<P>
One potentially smarmy side effect, however, is that collectors sometimes offer 
to pay for catalogue reproductions of works of art they own. The museum gets 
the expensive color plate it might not have been able to afford, the argument 
goes, and the collector can add a notch to his belt by having the work 
published under the museum's aegis. The problem is that the particular work may 
not be of top quality, and the odor of payoff subverts the tradition of 
disinterested scholarship. If a collector pays for a reproduction, can an 
essayist still feel free to criticize the work or demote it to a lower rank in 
the artist's oeuvre? 
</P>
<P>
Other problems with catalogues are much more clear-cut and involve no moral 
dilemmas, only failures of nerve, resources or energy. 
</P>
<P>
Catalogues about a single artist sometimes sink to the level of panegyric. 
Everything this person did was great, according to the slobbering essayist. He 
or she would have you believe that the artist single-handedly maintained the 
level of art of his time, never had a bad day (much less a bad decade), and 
continues to produce brilliant work -- even if, in fact, he's really doing 
tired knock-offs of the stuff that initially made him famous. 
</P>
<P>
And then there are shows that don't have catalogues at all. "We have no money!" 
cry the sponsoring institutions. But not every catalogue has to be a flashy 
number printed on expensive coated stock and crammed with color photos. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly at college and university galleries, the most important goal is to 
introduce the work in a meaningful way. A stapled handout run off on a copy 
machine can be a useful tool, anticipating the curious student's questions and 
instilling the idea that art is just as rich and complex a subject as history 
or psychology. These days, when too many people have come to equate art with 
fancy price tags, even the humblest catalogue has yeoman work to do.

MASTER CHORALE CLOSES ITS SEASON AT PAVILION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE BURROUGHS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Master Chorale closed its 1989-90 season Saturday night in the 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion by demonstrating in nearly equal measure its greatest 
virtue (elegant massed choral singing in major works) and most regrettable 
weaknesses (giving over big program segments of important music to overparted 
vocal soloists; fiddling with insubstantial new repertory of doubtful value). 
</P>
<P>
The equivocal impression left by the group's recent work now becomes its 
temporary legacy; its loyal constituency deserves better. 
</P>
<P>
For this valedictory, director John Currie surrounded the world premiere of 
Gordon Getty's "Annabel Lee" with Bernstein's "Chichester Psalms," Schubert's 
Mass in E-flat and three great Mozart concert arias for soprano. 
</P>
<P>
On any occasion, Chorale and Currie could vanquish skepticism by doing 
everything on the level of the Bernstein and Schubert they gave here. 
</P>
<P>
From the longest, softest legato lines to the crispest staccato syncopations, 
this was a colorfully sung, scrupulously musical, firmly led "Psalms" that 
obeyed its own Hebrew enjoinder: "Make a joyful noise!" Boy soprano Jason 
Domantay acquitted himself pitch-perfectly. In the Mass, sopranos and tenors 
sustained the Schubertian tessitura with admirable ease and security, and tenor 
Agostino Castagnola was standout quartet soloist. 
</P>
<P>
Getty's attractively orchestrated setting of Poe, for male voices only, follows 
speech rhythm relentlessly. The sweet, accessible melodic line doesn't stretch 
single syllables over many notes, or soar with emotion or color. A whopping, 
self-indulgent exercise in overkill might have gotten nearer the hyper-Romantic 
tone of the poetry than this tepid solecism. 
</P>
<P>
Soprano Patrice Michaels Bedi ventured Mozart's "Vado, ma dove?" (K. 583), 
"Bella mia fiamma, addio!" (K. 528), and "Ah se in ciel" (K. 538) in a mere 
peep of a voice. Poise, musicianship and impressive fioritura didn't produce 
drama or pathos. She could not sustain her highest pitches and everything in 
her lower octave was covered by the orchestra. And reading the score enhanced 
neither spontaneity of utterance nor communication with her hearers. BRUCE

ZUKERMAN/KARR/LEWIS ENSEMBLE AT SOUTH BAY CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A little excitement materialized at the end of the Friday concert by the trio 
of flutist Eugenia Zukerman, contrabassist Gary Karr and pianist Harmon Lewis 
in Marsee Auditorium at the South Bay Center for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
Genuine musical competition and technical risk-taking occupied the stage then, 
as Zukerman and Karr edgily and enthusiastically alternated virtuoso solos in 
Giovanni Bottesini's Fantasy on themes from "La Sonnambula." 
</P>
<P>
Adrenaline flowed, and not only on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
But the remainder of the trio's El Camino College appearance, though smoothly 
performed, emerged forgettable. 
</P>
<P>
Zukerman and Karr, of course, are celebrated soloists on their respective 
instruments; during the course of this program they demonstrated their 
achievements. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, the keyboardist who might be the catalyst in this threesome, sparking 
his colleagues to greater feats and higher energy, apparently does the 
opposite: With a reliable and steady musical presence, he keeps them calm. But 
how many thrills are there in calm? 
</P>
<P>
Flutist Zukerman gave stylish attention to a solo sonata by C.P.E. Bach and, 
with Lewis a bland partner, to the pungent Sonata of Francis Poulenc. And, near 
the end of the evening, bassist Karr started to lift himself out of lethargy in 
some showy playing of pieces by Rossini and Paganini. But too late. 
</P>
<P>
In works by Corelli, Haydn and Kohler, the trio revealed why their partnership 
seems to wallow in innocuousness: They were clearly not born to be together.

As toddlers struggle toward the ability to speak, the first lessons are as much 
physical as intellectual. Breathing, positioning of tongue, teeth and lips, 
rhythm -- these naturally occurring linguistic skills make the sounds that 
later will form words. 
</P>
<P>
It is a sort of programming that carries over when a person learns a second 
language, and the result is an accent: speaking one language with the traits of 
another. Native English-speakers, for instance, must work to move their tongue 
to trill the "r" when learning Spanish, just as Chinese speakers struggle with 
the English "z" sound. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California, with its rich ethnic diversity, is something of a test 
ground for accommodating accents. While thick accents enhance the region's 
cosmopolitan flavor, they also can be perceived as an encumbrance, a roadblock 
to career advancement, an easy target for those who would ridicule or 
discriminate. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though we are a melting pot, and we welcome everyone from all walks of 
life, if someone cannot make himself understood, that breeds prejudice," said 
Lillian Glass, a speech and communication specialist who practices in Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Examples abound. A Chinese-born accountant for a federal agency is told the way 
she speaks English is difficult to understand and will limit her professional 
opportunities. A Mexican-born salesman for a soft drink bottler is hired to 
court Spanish-speaking clients, but then believes he cannot move up in the 
company because of his accent. For a study, people posing as job seekers with 
foreign accents answer help-wanted ads by telephone but are told the posts are 
already filled; when unaccented English speakers call, they are invited for job 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Many people, rather than endure the frustration, take specialized classes to 
soften or eliminate their accents and dialects -- a field of speech instruction 
that has evolved into a fast-growing industry. Doctors, business executives and 
performers throughout Southern California spend hours with coaches to polish 
their locution. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the issue of accents in the workplace became more complicated. The 
U.S. Supreme Court let stand a ruling that allows an employer to deny a job or 
promotion to someone whose accent significantly interferes with his or her 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
In the case, a 66-year-old Filipino was denied a job with the Hawaii Department 
of Motor Vehicles because, in the opinion of his interviewers, his heavily 
accented English was difficult to understand. 
</P>
<P>
By refusing to hear the man's appeal, the Supreme Court let stand a lower 
court's ruling that said the DMV's actions did not violate the 1964 Civil 
Rights Act, which outlaws job discrimination on the basis of national origin, 
race, sex or religion. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court decision raised many questions: How strong of an accent is 
considered detrimental to the performance of a job? Who can set an objective 
standard for how a person's English should sound? 
</P>
<P>
Immigrant-rights advocates decried the Supreme Court action, saying it gives 
employers subjective leeway to deny someone a job and then blame it on his or 
her accent. An employer could all too easily maintain that someone's English is 
incomprehensible merely as a cover for more entrenched discrimination, the 
advocates say. 
</P>
<P>
The danger, said the critics, is that employers might use accents as a 
screening mechanism: They'll simply refuse to hire people with accents they 
don't like. 
</P>
<P>
"Employers will see this as a green light to discriminate," said Linda E. 
Mitchell of the Coalition for Humane Immigration Rights of Los Angeles. "We are 
legitimizing discrimination in our society." 
</P>
<P>
Accents, of course, are not limited to the foreign-born. Regions of the 
country, such as the New York area or the South, have distinctive accents. 
Blacks and U.S.-born Chicanos may speak with certain accents or favor 
particular dialects. But most problems seem to involve immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
A 33-year-old Upland woman who was born in China and moved to California in 
1970 said in an interview that she fears her job is in jeopardy because of a 
supervisor's reaction to her accent. She has worked as an accountant and 
auditor for a federal regulatory agency -- a job that requires oral 
presentations to managerial groups -- during the last 4 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
After several positive evaluations, she said, she is now being denied a 
promised promotion. Her supervisor has blamed the "impact" of her accent on her 
communications skills. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came here (to the United States), I did not speak a word of English," 
she said. "I worked doubly hard, I learned doubly hard. . . . I do have an 
accent; I never denied that. (But) if they felt I had such a problem, why was 
it never put as an issue? . . . I never had a complaint." 
</P>
<P>
The woman, who speaks with a thick accent but is generally intelligible, asked 
that her name not be published because she is in a legal battle with the 
federal agency. A grievance filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission was rejected, but she is appealing. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart Kwoh, executive director of the Asian Pacific American Legal Center, 
said his organization has received similar, informal complaints from several 
Chinese-born engineers who work at some of Southern California's aerospace 
firms and believe their accents are being used to relegate them to mid-level 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
"Our concern is that anytime a person has an accent, an employer can use that 
to deny a promotion or a job," Kwoh said. "Los Angeles has so many different 
groups and is so diverse now that if we play favorites, if we start choosing 
the accent we like as the standard, . . . it gets very dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, of the rights coalition, is counseling a Mexican-born salesman for a 
major soft drink company. Hired in part because he spoke Spanish and could work 
with Spanish-speaking businesses, he now feels his accent is being used to deny 
him advancement in the company, Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
In a study conducted last year by the Humane Immigration Rights coalition and 
the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, five pairs of people posing as job 
applicants answered help-wanted ads placed in local newspapers. In each pair, a 
person speaking English with a Spanish accent answered the ad first, followed 
by the partner, a less-qualified applicant who spoke unaccented English. 
</P>
<P>
According to the study, 20% of the accented callers were not considered for the 
job, but their less-qualified unaccented partners were. In several cases, the 
accented applicant was told the job was filled but the unaccented applicant, 
calling later, was told the job was available. 
</P>
<P>
In nearly one-third of the cases, the accented speaker was treated less 
favorably, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
In California, numerous large companies and government agencies said that while 
they do not consider national origin or ethnic background when examining a job 
applicant, they do make it clear that the applicants' "ability to communicate" 
is a factor in whether they get hired -- especially when the position is one 
that requires talking to the public. 
</P>
<P>
"What we look at is (the applicant's) knowledge, skill and ability to do that 
job," said Kathleen Flynn, a spokeswoman for Pacific Bell. "Part of that 
ability is to be understood by our customers." 
</P>
<P>
At a state bureaucracy like the Department of Motor Vehicles, hiring someone 
for a front-office job who could not communicate clearly "would cause more 
problems than the hiring would be worth," DMV spokesman Bill Gengler said. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to have people who can communicate clearly with the public," he said. 
"Vehicle registration and licensing . . . are a very serious thing. If the 
employee cannot communicate with the public, then the public is going to be 
shortchanged." 
</P>
<P>
At Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Fontana, administrators offer special 
"accent-reduction" tutoring to foreign-born physicians as a way to help them 
communicate better with their patients. 
</P>
<P>
About 45 doctors have passed through the program in the last four years, 
spokeswoman Gail Henderson-Peter said. 
</P>
<P>
In one session last week, an internist born in Bangkok diligently practiced the 
"th" sound, repeating, "the, this, them." He stumbled later over the word 
"tests," the juxtaposition of two "S's" and a "T" posing something of a 
tongue-twister. 
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance of speech specialist Ruth Forman, the Thai doctor, who has 
lived in California for 13 years, was taught to speak more slowly, enunciate 
more clearly and project his words, even his own name. 
</P>
<P>
Forman, director of the Sherman Oaks-based Communication Enhancement Inc., said 
many of the difficulties in communication are directly tied to cultural 
differences, such as eye contact and projection. 
</P>
<P>
She said in some Asian cultures it is considered impolite "to open (the lips) 
and project." In contrast, others, such as Russians and Germans, sometimes 
project so forcefully that they must be toned down, she said. 
</P>
<P>
At the session at Kaiser, some of Forman's students seemed to have special 
trouble with one word in particular: "physician." 
</P>
<P>
One of the Taiwanese doctors, who has lived in Los Angeles for 10 years, said 
the coaching has made him more confident. "I (seem) more sincere to my 
patients," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Forman says the goal of her program is not to rob the foreign-born of their 
culture, nor to eliminate accents in an effort to homogenize the way Southern 
California speaks. 
</P>
<P>
"In reality, you don't ever get rid of the accent," she said. "What this 
program does is reduce the accent so that communication is not a problem. . . . 
Each culture brings something special to this country. I hope that never 
fades."

HOLOCAUST: IN AUSCHWITZ IN 1944, A MAN RISKED EVERYTHING TO DEFY THE NAZIS AND 
SAVE A PAIR OF PRISONERS FROM ANNIHILATION. SUNDAY HE WAS INCLUDED AMONG THE 
RIGHTEOUS.

<P>
The two Jews were young and daring but they had nothing to lose. One of them 
had already stood at the gas chamber's door, only to be spared by the wife of a 
Nazi commandant who took pity on him when he helped free her skirt from an iron 
gate. 
</P>
<P>
The Pole, on the other hand, had everything to lose. He knew, having overhead 
the conversation of two SS officers, that the Germans were preparing to 
annihilate the remaining Jews at the extermination camp known as Auschwitz III. 
</P>
<P>
He knew as well that under Nazi law, to collaborate with a Jew could mean death 
for not only himself, but his entire family. But he also knew there was a 
higher law, the law of a man's own morals. 
</P>
<P>
And so it was that in September, 1944, Jozef Wrona offered to help Max Drimmer 
and Herman Shine escape from Auschwitz, a feat Holocaust scholars say was often 
tried, but rarely with success. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, after 46 years, the three men were reunited in San Francisco, where 
Shine and Drimmer now make their homes. And on Sunday, they came to the Simon 
Wiesenthal Center in West Los Angeles, where an official of Yad Vashem, 
Israel's national Holocaust museum, bestowed Wrona with its highest honor, the 
title of "Righteous Among the Nations." 
</P>
<P>
In a simple speech in Polish, Wrona -- a thinning, bespectacled man of 68 -- 
marveled that he would be singled out "for feeling just a human obligation." 
Through a translator, he said he was "deeply touched" by the ceremony, which 
coincided with the center's annual Yom Hashoah -- Day of Remembrance -- 
celebration, in which Jews worldwide recall the horrors of the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
Theirs was not the only such historical recollection that took place Sunday. At 
the Glendale High School football stadium, about 2,000 Armenian-Americans 
gathered to mark the 75th anniversary of the slaying of 1.5 million Armenians, 
allegedly by the orders of Ottoman Turks. 
</P>
<P>
And about 350 people attended solemn mass at our Lady of the Bright Mountain 
Polish Roman Catholic Church in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the 
Katyn Forest massacre, in which some 4,400 Polish prisoners-of-war were 
executed by Russian soldiers during their 1939 invasion of Poland. 
</P>
<P>
At the Wiesenthal Center, speakers exhorted the crowd to remember not only Nazi 
atrocities, but also -- in the words of Mordechai Paldiel, who presented 
Wrona's award -- "those who held the torch of humanity aloft during history's 
darkest period." 
</P>
<P>
Wrona, for his part, seemed reluctant to recount his remarkable tale of 
heroism. But Shine and Drimmer were eager to do it for him. 
</P>
<P>
"We want our story to be told to as many people as possible," Shine said. "We 
are the last of the survivors and our story, we know, is so extremely unusual . 
. . Jozef not only risked his life -- our lives were worth nothing anyway -- 
but he risked the lives of his entire family and his entire village." 
</P>
<P>
Shine and Drimmer, boyhood friends who grew up in Berlin, were arrested by the 
Nazis in 1939. They eventually wound up together at Auschwitz III, a part of 
the Auschwitz complex for prisoners who were healthy enough to work. Shine was 
put to work as a roofer. Drimmer was forced to work at a nearby factory owned 
by I. G. Farben, a company that manufactured the infamous Zyklon B gas that was 
used in the Nazi gas chambers. 
</P>
<P>
Wrona worked in the factory as a civilian employee. The young Polish Catholic 
had witnessed the extermination of his village's Jewish ghetto -- 800 people 
died. And his father had been arrested by the Nazis for helping Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Wrona and Drimmer soon became friends, engaging in furtive conversation. When 
he could, Wrona slipped Drimmer a cigarette or a slice of bread. And when he 
knew death was imminent for the Jews at Auschwitz, he offered to plot this 
escape: 
</P>
<P>
He would dig a hole in a warehouse shed on the Farben factory property. Drimmer 
and Shine would hide in the hole and he would cover them with fiberglass 
insulation material. At night -- they picked a night when they knew the moon 
would not shine -- they would slip away from the factory and meet resistance 
leaders, who would take them to their freedom. 
</P>
<P>
It worked almost according to plan, except the resistance fighters never 
showed. Instead, Shine and Drimmer went into hiding in the barn behind Wrona's 
home in the small village of Nowa Wies, 18 kilometers from Auschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
There they remained for four months, during which Drimmer wrote a letter to a 
girl named Herta whom he had known in Berlin. The correspondence almost proved 
to be their undoing; Herta was arrested by the Nazis, who found the letter and 
stormed Wrona's home, demanding to know where the Jews were hidden. 
</P>
<P>
But the Wrona family stood fast; they denied Drimmer and Shine were there. The 
two Jews, however, knew they would have to flee and sought refuge in the home 
of a young woman named Marianne, whom Shine had met on a road near Auschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
The two found shelter in her family's apartment. At the war's end, in a joyous 
double marriage ceremony in Berlin, Max married Herta and Herman married 
Marianne. 
</P>
<P>
The two couples soon emigrated to the United States. Shine made his career as a 
roofer; Drimmer became a plumbing contractor. Over the years, they said, they 
often thought about the man who saved their lives. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, they set out for Poland to find him. Although unsuccessful, their plea 
reached a newspaper reporter who tracked down Wrona. Soon afterward, they 
nominated him for the righteous conduct award. 
</P>
<P>
Wrona expects to stay with Shine and Drimmer for at least a month, but is 
looking forward to returing to Kenty, his village in Poland. The village, he 
said, has a schoolhouse with a room dedicated to the Holocaust. He intends to 
give the school the certificate and the medal he received at Sunday's ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
"After I die," he explained, "this will be hanging there. Maybe my example 
would help some other person in life to make a right decision."

<P>
Wheeling a shopping cart into a Long Beach supermarket one recent day, Barbara 
Sparks could have been mistaken for a grandmother running her usual errands. 
Her face framed by bifocals, pearl earrings and graying curls, she headed 
straight for the meat counter, pausing to test packages of boneless rump roast, 
kielbasa, ground sirloin and salt pork like any choosy shopper. 
</P>
<P>
But in her basket, Sparks, 60, toted a set of precision weights, a 
battery-powered digital scale accurate to 1/100th of an ounce and a pad of 
yellow violation notices that she would soon dish out. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks, an investigator for the Los Angeles County Department of Weights and 
Measures, zeroed in on a honey-cured smoked turkey. The bird, advertised as 
3.99 pounds, actually weighed in at just 3.90. Five others also came up short. 
Sparks slapped the meat manager with a citation and ordered him to correct the 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
Total overcharges: $2.27. 
</P>
<P>
In a world of violence, gangs and drugs, Sparks and the county's 45 other 
weights investigators keep consumers from being nickeled-and-dimed to death. "I 
know short-weight meat doesn't compare with murder on 2nd Street," said Sparks, 
back behind the wheel of her car and off to another market. "But somebody has 
to protect the consumer. It all adds up, you know." 
</P>
<P>
She and her colleagues hit the streets every day to ensure that a 16-ounce loaf 
of bread always equals a pound, that a gallon of gas isn't an ounce less and 
that foot-long wieners truly measure up. 
</P>
<P>
Rarely are weights violations today as flagrant as those depicted in the 1937 
film "Great Guy" -- a favorite at weights and measures conventions -- in which 
James Cagney played a crusading inspector who busts a butcher for selling 
chickens with pieces of lead slipped inside. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles County's burgeoning population and commercial growth has 
produced an unprecedented number of packages to weigh, depths to gauge and 
sizes to measure. The effects of even minor, unintentional discrepancies -- 
such as the price of the underweight turkeys -- can quickly multiply. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, weights officials estimate, they saved consumers at least $9 million 
in overcharges. They inspected 19,862 commercial scales, 25,711 retail gas 
pumps, 1,734 taxi meters and 4,268,448 packaged items. And they handed out 
1,510 citations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just too bad that the majority of the public doesn't realize what we do," 
said Nahan H. Gluck, deputy director of the department and its $1.6-million 
budget. "We don't have any funds for PR people, or pet projects, or literature, 
or pamphlets." 
</P>
<P>
Lest he despair, Gluck can look to the poster hanging on his office wall for 
inspiration: "A false balance is an abomination to the Lord," reads the 
biblical passage, "but a just weight is His delight." 
</P>
<P>
To large retailers, supermarkets and gas stations, the weights and measures 
inspectors are something of a necessary evil. While few are thrilled by 
violation notices, businesses generally say they appreciate the opportunity to 
correct their mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes us aware of the need to be careful," said Steve Koff, president of 
Southern California Grocers Assn., which represents 1,200 stores from 
Bakersfield to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Yet since few violations are intentional -- county officials estimate that 95% 
stem from human error -- merchants sometimes complain that inspectors are too 
picky and unforgiving. 
</P>
<P>
Take the case of Teresa Baker, a 36-year-old bakery manager snared last year 
for selling lemon-poppyseed muffins at less than the advertised weight. 
According to Baker, who was then working at a Ralphs in Santa Fe Springs, she 
placed the muffins in packs of four, each of which cost $2.59 and was listed at 
18 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
But an inspector visiting the store last August discovered 41 containers 
weighing an average of 16 ounces. The total overcharges were $12.08. 
</P>
<P>
Baker argued that even at the light weight, the four-packs still were cheaper 
than buying muffins individually at 69 cents apiece. A Whittier Municipal Court 
judge, however, slapped her with two years of summary probation and fined the 
store $235. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to be very conscientious," said Baker, who now works at a Ralphs in 
Cerritos. "I wouldn't sell something to the customer that I wouldn't buy 
myself. Now this is on my record. It just seems unfair." 
</P>
<P>
Although inspectors don't have to prove that a violation is intentional -- 
evidence of the error is enough -- there are cases where inaccuracies are so 
egregious or far-reaching that prosecutors take the step of filing civil 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1989, the district attorney's office won one of its biggest such 
cases, a $450,457 judgment against the Kmart Corp. for consistently 
overcharging at its check stands. Of the 358 products purchased by undercover 
agents at Kmart stores in Los Angeles, Kern and Kings counties, 103 were 
incorrectly rung up, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The average overcharge was 11.3%. 
</P>
<P>
In another case several years ago, the Coleman Co., based in Wichita, Kan., was 
fined $37,125 for selling 4,008 short sleeping bags at Los Angeles stores. 
Although the discrepancies were minute -- most bags were little more than an 
inch short -- prosecutors said those bags were the firm's biggest sellers and 
they gave Coleman an unfair competitive edge. 
</P>
<P>
"When you see a pattern of negligence like that it raises questions," said 
Michael Delaney, head of the district attorney's consumer protection division. 
"As a prosecutor I tend to get cynical when they say it's an accident. For some 
reason, their accidents usually seem to favor the business, not the consumer." 
</P>
<P>
For years, the weights and measures department, founded in 1915, was able to 
inspect every commercial scale in the county. When officials found bogus 
devices, they routinely smashed them with sledgehammers and hurled them off of 
the Santa Monica Pier. 
</P>
<P>
Today, with more than 20,000 businesses and 7 billion packaged items consumed 
annually in the county, inspectors say they are barely able to scratch the 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say they target stores and service stations that have a history of 
problems. "We always try to zero in on the places where we're going to have the 
highest impact," said Gluck, whose department merged six years ago with the 
office of the county agricultural commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Pity the business that challenges evidence collected by a weights and measures 
inspector -- for the firm soon finds itself up against the relentlessly precise 
world of metrology. 
</P>
<P>
The weights department's nerve center is an atmospherically controlled 
laboratory in South Gate. Under lock and key is a highly polished, 
stainless-steel cylinder that weighs 1 kilogram and is known as Los Angeles 
County No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Every time an inspector hands out a citation, the suspected product ultimately 
is compared against that kilogram, which is the standard by which all weights 
in the county are measured. One kilogram is equal to 2.2046 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The laboratory that contains Los Angeles County No. 1 has steel walls and its 
own foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Due in part to the needs of the aerospace industry, which relies on precise 
weight measurements to calculate the thrust of rockets and airplanes, Los 
Angeles is the only county in the country to have a kilogram directly modeled 
after the U.S. standard, known as Prototype Kilogram No. 20. It is held at the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Md., and used 
as the country's standard for all weights for the last 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
Even the Los Angeles and Gaithersburg kilograms are mere approximations of the 
world's standard of a true kilogram, which is held in a vault in Sevres, 
France.

Inspectors have their scales calibrated to the county standard every six 
months. Yet despite such precision, their jobs always come down to questions of 
judgment.

After totaling up the violations in the meat department of the Long Beach store 
she was casing, inspector Barbara Sparks wheeled her cart over to the store's 
bakery and began weighing loaves of oat-bran bread, hot cross buns, egg bagels 
and apricot muffins. 
</P>
<P>
This time, it was a gooey hot fudge sundae cake that caught her eye. The 
chocolate dessert, it turned out, was advertised at 20 ounces, but weighed in 
at 19.4. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so close that I won't take the time to write this one up," Sparks told a 
visibly tense bakery manager. "But if you make some more tomorrow, maybe you 
ought to put on just a little bit more icing."

Men who frequently sunbathe nude using ultraviolet lamps substantially increase 
their risk of developing a rare and potentially fatal genital cancer, according 
to a new study published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine. The 
study shows that the penis is particularly susceptible to the carcinogenic 
effects of sunlight, and it advised men who are frequently exposed to 
ultraviolet radiation in tanning salons, on the beach, or for therapeutic 
purposes to protect themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Occasional sun exposure carries little risk. We are talking about people who 
like to tan all over and do it year in and year out and are using a variety of 
ultraviolet light devices," said Dr. Robert Stern, a dermatologist at Harvard 
Medical School, who led the study. 
</P>
<P>
Excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation is estimated to cause some 90% of 
the 500,000 cases of skin cancer in the United States each year. 
</P>
<P>
The study reviewed a group of 892 men who, over a 12-year period, received high 
doses of ultraviolet light and chemicals called psoralens for the treatment of 
psoriasis, a commonly used therapy for severe cases of the skin disease. The 
incidence of cancer of the penis and scrotum was nearly 300 times higher in 
these men than in the general population.

Scientists at Hammsmith Hospital in London say they have been able to select 
3-day-old test-tube embryos that are destined to become girls and implant them 
in women, including two who are expecting twins this summer. Further research 
might provide a way to screen out embryos that would be expected to develop 
serious genetic diseases, removing the prospect of abortions in those cases, 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
The study was aimed at producing female babies in cases where a male could 
inherit one of the 200 serious genetic diseases that affect only males, said 
researcher Alan Handyside. 
</P>
<P>
The embryo analysis involves collecting eggs from a woman, fertilizing them in 
a test tube and letting them grow to eight-cell embryos. A single cell is 
removed from each embryo to see if it contains a bit of genetic material that 
indicates the presence of a Y chromosome, which would mean the embryo is 
destined to become a boy.

<P>
BROSTEK'S BACK X-RAYS DON'T SCARE OFF RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While others turned their backs on Bern Brostek and his back, the Rams shunned 
some medical-report gossip Sunday and drafted with their own hearts and charts, 
selecting the University of Washington center with the 23rd pick on the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
Brostek, the heir apparent to 33-year-old Pro Bowl center Doug Smith, admits to 
having a congenital spinal defect, an interesting problem facing a youngster 
entering a professional career of hunching and squatting. Brostek flunked a 
Buffalo Bills' physical recently, and a few other teams passed on him, too. 
</P>
<P>
To which the native Hawaiian, Brostek, a 300-pound bundle of poi (one of his 
favorite snacks), remarked, "I guess some of the X-rays kind of blew their 
minds." 
</P>
<P>
 The X-rays blew their minds? 
</P>
<P>
 No worries, Brostek claims. 
</P>
<P>
"It's never bothered me," he said of his back. "It's something I've had from 
birth. It's called a congenital defect. My last two or three disks are kind of 
defective, but what's happened is the muscles in my back all these years have 
compensated, the muscle is just stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Brostek's back requires no special treatment or therapy. In fact, it only 
bothers him when people broach the subject. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' medical team tweaked and twisted Brostek's back and reached the 
following conclusion: 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big one," Coach John Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Any concerns about it lasting? 
</P>
<P>
"None," Robinson added. 
</P>
<P>
That question aside, Brostek was just what the Rams had in mind, a bruising 
interior linemen who can play guard until Smith retires in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't a reach, by any means, on the scale of plucking first-round tackle 
Mike Schad from Queen's University, Canada, in 1986. Brostek was a consensus 
late-round pick and fell into line, right on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams only wavered on Brostek while Georgia defensive back, Ben Smith, 
remained on the board after 21 picks. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know who we would have picked had we had them both," Robinson 
remarked. "We just sat and waited to see." 
</P>
<P>
When the Philadelphia Eagles took Smith at 22, the Rams' decision was made. 
</P>
<P>
Hudson Houck, the Rams' offensive line coach, worked Brostek out personally in 
Hawaii and returned with glowing reports. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a mystery whether he's a player or not," Houck said. "Or whether 
we're going on potential. He can play football. He's already shown he can do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
And if this man has a back problem, how did he manage to start 41 of the last 
42 games at Washington? 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't missed a day of practice, I don't think, in three years," Robinson 
continued. "So he may have a bad back, but it's usually at night and in the 
morning, but never in the afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
Brostek, for one, was overjoyed to be joining a line long noted for sending 
players to his home state, Hawaii, each season for the annual Pro Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
Brostek wants to continue the tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"A free trip home at the end of January, that sounds good," he said. "If it's 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
Brostek grew up on the island of Oahu, not far from the University of Hawaii. 
He said his dad encouraged him to play his collegiate ball on the mainland, so 
Brostek landed in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of taking a chance on a marginal cornerback in the second round (49th 
overall), the Rams opted for Pat Terrell of Notre Dame, a player most rated 
among the top safety prospects in the draft. If Terrell proves to be that good, 
it gives Jerry Gray the flexibility to remain at corner or play safety. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson: "We did not feel there was any corner there worthy of being picked in 
that area. You'd have to say that Jerry Gray, instead of safety/corner, which 
he was an hour ago, is now a corner/safety, which is fine with us. We will 
still have Jerry play both in training camp." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, those plans might change again with the late-day acquisition of New 
York Jet cornerback Bobby Humphery. 
</P>
<P>
Terrell, about 6-0 and 195, is projected at free safety for the Rams, who are 
impressed with his range, his smarts -- Terrell graduates next month with a 
degree in business/marketing -- and his 4.5 speed in the 40-yard dash. 
</P>
<P>
Terrell last summer interned with IBM. 
</P>
<P>
"They're really interested in my career," Terrell said. "But they do know I 
play football." 
</P>
<P>
Terrell was disappointed he wasn't chosen sooner, since draft slots equate 
directly to dollars, but admits a future with the Rams isn't bad, particularly 
since he'll be reunited with former Notre Dame teammate Frank Stams. 
</P>
<P>
How badly did the Rams want Terrell? 
</P>
<P>
"We were sweating out the last four picks, holding our breath, hoping he'd get 
through," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
In the third round, with the 78th choice, the Rams took fullback Latin Berry of 
Oregon (5-9, 196). In an admitted risk, the Rams are planning to use Berry as a 
kick returner to replace Ron Brown while they convert him to cornerback over 
the next year. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to take the risk and give him a year to learn," said Robinson, who 
has compared Berry's toughness to ex-Ram Charles White. While Berry has 4.4 
speed in the 40, most felt he wasn't elusive enough to shake tacklers in the 
NFL as a runner. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams decided on Berry after two preferred choices were taken just prior to 
this pick. Linebacker Bobby Houston of North Carolina State went to Green Bay 
with the 22nd pick, and Brigham Young guard Mohammed Elewonibi was taken with 
the 23rd pick. The Rams selected 25th.

UNSER KEEPS FITTIPALDI BEHIND HIM THIS TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The hurt of losing the Indianapolis 500 on the next-to-last lap never will be 
totally erased, but Al Unser Jr. scrubbed away a little of it Sunday when he 
held off Emerson Fittipaldi -- the man who beat him at Indy -- to win the 
Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
A record crowd of 86,500 watched a nose-to-tail race between the youthful Unser 
and the veteran Fittipaldi over the final 20 laps of the 95-lap race on the 
seashore streets of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
For a time, it appeared as if Long Beach could have the same scenario as 
Indianapolis a year ago as Fittipaldi, the 43-year-old former world Formula One 
champion in the red and white No. 1 Penske-Chevy, pulled within striking 
distance of Unser, 28, in the red, white and blue No. 5 Lola-Chevy. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely saw a red and white car behind me," Unser said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
But this time there was no last-minute attempt to pass, as there was last May 
when Fittipaldi survived a bumping incident to win the Indianapolis 500 as 
Unser spun into the wall. 
</P>
<P>
"After the last stop, I drove as fast as I could, but he was faster than I was 
-- that was the problem," Fittipaldi said. 
</P>
<P>
The victory, worth $143,908 to Unser, was his third in a row in the Long Beach 
street race. 
</P>
<P>
Fittipaldi's Marlboro Penske teammate, Danny Sullivan, finished third, just 
ahead of fast-closing Michael Andretti's Newman-Haas Lola-Chevy. 
</P>
<P>
What excitement there was in the first 70 laps came when Sullivan and Andretti 
had to charge through the 25-car field after an altercation on the first turn 
of the second lap. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan was third -- close behind Fittipaldi -- when he failed to brake in 
time and banged into the rear of Fittipaldi's car. Sullivan spun in the middle 
of the turn. Andretti, fourth in the pack, locked up his brakes to avoid 
Sullivan and stalled his engine. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, who admitted fault, was able to spin his car around and return to the 
race in 12th place. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't even thinking of passing Emerson," Sullivan said. "I just screwed up. 
I came down into the corner and just rolled on the brakes with him, and I 
didn't anticipate him braking quite as much. I was still rolling in when he was 
stopping a little faster than I thought. I jumped on the brakes and tapped his 
rear and spun around." 
</P>
<P>
Andretti was not as fortunate as Sullivan. He had to wait for the field to pass 
so course workers could push-start his car. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a shame," Andretti said. "It made every lap like qualifying after that. 
It was the only thing I could do. I was hoping for a yellow flag, which we 
finally got, but it was too late for me to catch Sully." 
</P>
<P>
The lone caution flag of the race, caused when Scott Goodyear and Dean Hall 
spun in Turn 9, a 90-degree corner off Seaside Way, came on Lap 66 and lasted 
five laps. 
</P>
<P>
It enabled the field, which had been straggling behind Unser, to bunch close 
for a 25-lap dash to the checkered flag. Unser, who had held leads of as much 
as eight seconds, never could shake Fittipaldi but also never let him get close 
enough to attempt a pass. 
</P>
<P>
"On the last 10 laps, I was very lucky in traffic," Unser said. "I caught up 
(to slower cars) at just the right place, and when they saw me in their 
mirrors, they moved aside. They were very professional. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good day all around. Most of my success came in the pits. I had super 
pit stops. Those guys (the crew) worked their tails off." 
</P>
<P>
Unser led 91 of the 95 tours around the 11-turn, 1.67-mile circuit. The only 
time he gave up the front position was during his first pit stop. Mario 
Andretti held the lead for four laps, pitting later than Unser. 
</P>
<P>
Unser and Fittipaldi both said neither thought of their tense struggle at 
Indianapolis during their equally tense duel Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"You're concentrating so hard -- or at least you'd better be -- that you don't 
have any time to think about things like that," Unser said. "There are cement 
walls out there, and if you let your mind wander, they'll bite you." 
</P>
<P>
Fittipaldi: "No, thoughts about the 500 never came to mind. I was too busy 
trying to find a chance to catch Al. Every time I thought I had a chance, he 
would go a little faster. Very frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said he was thinking about it, though, as he followed them from a 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
"All I kept thinking about at the end of the race was Indianapolis last year," 
Sullivan said. "There was Little Al and Emmo again, and I thought, 'boy, this 
will be good.' " 
</P>
<P>
After passing everyone but Unser and Fittipaldi, Sullivan and Michael Andretti 
waged a tense duel over the final laps. 
</P>
<P>
"Another lap in traffic and maybe I'd have had a chance," Andretti said. "I 
couldn't seem to put the power down like I wanted to. I guess, considering what 
happened at the start, I should be satisfied with fourth." 
</P>
<P>
Unser's victory, his 10th on road or street courses -- without a win on an oval 
in his eight-year Indy car career -- enabled him to pass Mario Andretti as the 
biggest money maker in road races. Unser has earned $2,153,793 to $2,082,684 
for the elder Andretti. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Andretti finished fifth, just behind son Michael, after having 
turbocharger problems that turned into a brake problem. 
</P>
<P>
"For some reason, which I don't know, the (turbocharger popoff) valve that I 
had been using all weekend went bad," Mario said. "I had to dial the boost all 
the way back and the valve would blow. At the end of the straightaway, I 
couldn't take advantage of what I had working for me. 
</P>
<P>
"As a result, I started working the brakes hard and cooked them. The brakes got 
so they wouldn't recover, so I had my brake foot to the bulkhead." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Mears, the runaway winner at Phoenix two weeks ago, finished sixth, a lap 
behind Unser. 
</P>
<P>
"The car just never handled right," Mears said. "We had a push in the corners 
and it was loose coming out. With that kind of inconsistency, you can't do 
anything about it."

MIKE DOWNEY: CENTENNIAL HIGHLIGHTS OFFER INSPIRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the course of 100 years, a lot of Dodgers have come and gone. There was 
Zack Wheat, who played in 2,322 Dodger games, and there was John Tudor, who 
played in a couple. There was Jackie Robinson, who broke the color barrier, and 
Rick Sutcliffe, who broke his manager's furniture. There was Casey Stengel, who 
didn't only manage the Yankees and Mets, you know, and there was Babe Ruth, who 
coached first base. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers have played Shirley and Fairly, they have been Grim and Leary, they 
have utilized Podres and Brewers, and they have had Wills to Wynn. You could 
look it up. 
</P>
<P>
Once upon a time, Wee Willie Keeler was saying "hit 'em where they ain't" to 
the gentlemen of the press. Saturday, in a television special commemorating a 
century of Dodger baseball, Mickey Hatcher was interviewed by Susan Anton. Hey, 
things change. 
</P>
<P>
Some things never change, however, and that includes the Dodgers' searching for 
exactly the right lineup that will win them a pennant for the 22nd time. When 
you consider some of the communities that have never been witness to even one 
World Series -- Anaheim, Atlanta, Montreal, Seattle, Toronto, suburban Texas -- 
or the ones that haven't won one for what seems an eternity -- Boston, Chicago, 
Cleveland, Milwaukee -- the mind boggles at the Dodgers' success even more. 
</P>
<P>
"I was watching those highlight films yesterday -- you know, from the first 100 
years," third baseman Lenny Harris said Sunday, after helping the second 
century along by driving in both Dodger runs in a 2-0 win over Houston. "And I 
kind of pictured myself up there on the screen, jumping up and down, 
celebrating a championship. 
</P>
<P>
"It kind of sends a shock through your system. A guy like me'd like to know 
what that feels like." 
</P>
<P>
So, how about it? How about the second hundred years of Dodger baseball? 
</P>
<P>
Is there a 1990 flag in Chavez Ravine's future, or are the Cincinnati Reds 
going to run off and hide? Does the latest effort of Ramon Martinez mean that 
the Dodgers have more than enough pitching to get through the summer, or do the 
continued failures of Fernando Valenzuela balance the scale? Is Juan Samuel the 
real leadoff man, Harris the real third baseman, Kal Daniels the real No. 3 
hitter? Is Jay Howell the true stopper . . . or is Don Aase, of all people? 
</P>
<P>
Tom Lasorda sounds happy and unconcerned. Then again, Tom Lasorda was born 
sounding happy and unconcerned. He is the original happy camper. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the way the team's playing," the Dodger manager said. "One outstanding 
quality that I see in this team was something I noticed in San Diego. We were 
four runs behind, but fought back and got the winning run up at the plate in 
Jeff Hamilton. A team has to maintain that feeling of never being out of any 
game, of believing that you can always come back and win the damn thing." 
</P>
<P>
Was that something lacking in the Dodgers last season? 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't that that was lacking," Lasorda said. "What was lacking was an 
outfield (Kirk Gibson, John Shelby and Mike Marshall) that went from 220 runs 
batted in to 84. That's what was lacking." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers took the field Sunday with an all-new outfield. In center and right 
field were newcomers Samuel and Hubie Brooks, both of whom already have made 
major donations to the Dodger cause. These guys have pop in their bats, and 
Samuel has speed. If they can field, they will be great, great guys to have 
around. 
</P>
<P>
In left field was Chris Gwynn, who is trying to do more than just mark time 
while waiting for Daniels to reclaim his position. The Dodgers are in a 
no-Gwynn situation. If Daniels or Gibson can play, Gwynn can't. But Chris 
considers himself too good a hitter to linger and rot on anybody's bench. He 
has tried to make the most of Daniels' absence, but has yet to do anything 
dazzling, except in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn needs more chances, and not just the kind he's been getting. At San 
Francisco, on a frigid day, Mike Munoz took a strike at the plate, whereupon 
Lasorda turned to Gwynn and said: "Get ready. If Munoz gets two strikes, you're 
going up there to pinch-hit." 
</P>
<P>
Before Lasorda's last word to Gwynn was spoken, they heard the umpire shout 
out: "Steeee-rike two!" 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn unbundled, peeling off several layers of warmups and shirts. He stepped 
to the plate as rusty as the Tin Man and ended up fanning. Yet on another, 
similar occasion at San Francisco, he delivered a big single against Dan 
Quisenberry, driving in a run. The kid can hit; he just needs at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the Dodger infield is pretty much set, but much depends on Harris and 
how he handles his responsibilities as injured Jeff Hamilton's replacement. 
Harris would prefer to think the assignment is permanent. He isn't eager to 
hand Hamilton his job back, or to see Brooks taking grounders there during 
infield practice. Harris wants to stay and play. 
</P>
<P>
"Tommy's giving me a chance, and I'm not going to let him down," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe he knows that 78 people, from Dick Gray to Jim Gilliam to even Steve 
Garvey and Eddie Murray, have occupied third base for the Dodgers, just in the 
time that the team has been located in Los Angeles. Lenny Harris doesn't figure 
to appear in as many games as Zack Wheat. He just hopes to still be appearing 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe 200 years from now," Harris said, "somebody can see a highlight film of 
me."

MORNING BRIEFING: AUERBACH DROVE HIM OUT OF TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By HARLEY TINKHAM

<TEXT>
<P>
It was tough year for Bill Fitch in New Jersey, but the coach of the Nets said 
he's a survivor. 
</P>
<P>
When the Nets last played in Boston, Fitch recalled his years as coach of the 
Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
"Four years of cigar smoke nine hours a day, and I'm alive," he told the 
Providence Journal. 
</P>
<P>
"And I rode around this town for four years with one of the worst drivers in 
the world, and I survived." 
</P>
<P>
The cigar smoker, obviously, was Red Auerbach, president of the Celtics. But 
who was the driver? 
</P>
<P>
"Auerbach!" Fitch said. "Why, the kamikaze pilots in World War II took lessons 
from him." 
</P>
<P>
Today's quiz: Q. When Atlanta Brave Manager Russ Nixon said, "This is by far 
the best team I've ever managed," how is it that the city didn't applaud? 
</P>
<P>
A. Because Nixon has managed four teams, two at Cincinnati, two at Atlanta, and 
all four finished last. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: When Tom Niedenfuer delivered the fatal pitch to Jack Clark, what 
was the count? 
</P>
<P>
Would-you-believe-it Dept.: Tracy Ringolsby of the Dallas Morning News came up 
with this statistic: The last four opening-game starters for the Chicago White 
Sox were traded before the season ended. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Seaver (1986) went to Boston, Richard Dotson (1987) to the New York 
Yankees, Ricky Horton (1988) to the Dodgers, and Jerry Reuss (1989) to 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
This year's opening-game starter was Melido Perez. 
</P>
<P>
Stop the presses: From the Akron Beacon Journal: "The Atlanta Hawks suspended 
mascot Harry the Hawk for a game when he dumped water on some fans who were 
cheering for Charlotte. Meanwhile, in Charlotte, Hugo the Hornet quit in a 
dispute with owner George Shinn." 
</P>
<P>
Now-it-can-be-told Dept.: From Pittsburgh Pirate outfielder John Cangelosi, 
recalling his struggle to make the club in spring training: "I was signing 
autographs, and some guy said, 'If you don't make the team, can I have your 
cap?' That's the coldest thing I've ever heard." 
</P>
<P>
No tears: From Oakland Athletic pitcher Dave Stewart, applauding the city's 
decision to pull out of the Raider deal: "I'm a die-hard Raider fan, don't get 
me wrong, but I remember 1982, when Al Davis packed up shop and took off. Let 
him go to Sacramento or even Baltimore." 
</P>
<P>
Making his mark: Gary Player, on U.S. Amateur golf champion Chris Patton, who 
weighs over 300 pounds: "That's the only player I ever saw who takes a divot 
just standing there." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: It was the first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Reliever Dan Quisenberry, on his contract with the San Francisco 
Giants: "It has options through the year 2020 or until the last 'Rocky' movie 
is made." HARLEY TINKHAM

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It doesn't look as though the Kings are going to get much more ice time at the 
Forum this season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
What a difference a year doesn't make -- shock the defending Stanley Cup 
champion in the first round and then collapse in the second round. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The key to Game 3 Sunday night came early in the second period when King 
defenseman Marty McSorley committed a foolish roughing penalty after Edmonton 
forward Martin Gelinas had been cited for tripping. Instead of the Kings having 
a power play, the sides were even. Edmonton scored a minute later and by the 
end of the period had turned a 3-1 deficit into a 5-3 advantage. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Don Casey deserved a better fate. It was the injuries to Ron Harper and Gary 
Grant -- not Casey's coaching -- that kept the Clippers out of the playoffs 
again. . . . 
</P>
<P>
With Andre Ware and Barry Sanders in the backfield, the Detroit Lions might 
become the most exciting team in the NFL. . . . 
</P>
<P>
USC can tell the Raiders about the benefits of picking someone named Smith from 
the University of Arizona. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Rams might need help in the secondary, but it's no surprise when John 
Robinson tries to maintain the superiority of his offensive line by selecting a 
center first. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific 10 Conference led the nation with six players taken in the first 
round. The Big Eight -- remember Oklahoma and Nebraska? -- was blanked in the 
first round and only guard Keith Sims of Iowa State (39th overall) was taken in 
the second round. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tony Bennett was drafted by that city by the bay -- Green Bay. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The last time USC had as many as two players selected among the first six was 
in 1977 when tailback Ricky Bell was taken first by Tampa Bay, tackle Marvin 
Powell fourth by the New York Jets and defensive tackle Gary Jeter fifth by the 
New York Giants. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It can't be long before ESPN televises the Rotisserie League draft. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If you don't think drafting is an inexact science, try sampling expert opinion 
on first pick Jeff George. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I always get loads of insight from Beano Cook's interview with a loudmouth in 
the gallery wearing a New York Jet jersey. . . . 
</P>
<P>
On television Saturday, Arkansas Derby winner Silver Ending looked like a 
better Kentucky Derby prospect than Wood Memorial winner Thirty Six Red. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Gary Stevens would have a pretty nice Derby mount in Silver Ending if he 
weren't riding Mister Frisky instead. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If he really wanted to make a statement against fighting, NBA Commissioner 
David Stern would have suspended Bill Laimbeer and Charles Barkley from a 
playoff game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Think the absence of Barkley and Larry Bird from the 76er-Celtic game Sunday 
cost CBS a few rating points?. . . . 
</P>
<P>
News item: The Athletics Congress suspends long jumper Larry Myricks and 
hurdler Greg Foster three months each for taking over-the-counter cold tablets. 
Reaction: That will teach 'em. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If it's possible for a 24-hour television show to move right along, the Channel 
11 special on the 100 years of Dodger baseball did. Well, at least the parts I 
saw. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Hatcher gave national anthem singer Susan Anton his bat before the 
Dodger-Houston game Saturday night, explaining, "It hasn't been doing me any 
good." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Ramon Martinez will make a fortune on his changeup. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A guy holding up a sign outside Dodger Stadium Sunday was trying to scalp 
tickets -- for Tuesday's Kings-Edmonton game at the Forum. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If you're an Oakland fan, would you have cheered Ken Phelps' home run that 
broke up Brian Holman's perfect game with two outs in the ninth inning Friday 
and merely cut Seattle's advantage over the Athletics to 6-1? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Boston and the Chicago Cubs have new road uniforms. It's about time the Dodgers 
changed the lettering on their drab traveling grays to "Los Angeles." . . . 
</P>
<P>
To bar Pete Rose from the 10th anniversary celebration of the Philadelphia 
Phillies' last pennant is crazy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The WBC super-bantam- 
</P>
<P>
weight title rematch between champion Daniel Zaragoza and Paul Banke tonight at 
the Forum figures to be one of the best of the recent flurry of world title 
bouts. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Lightweight Jesus Pimentel Jr., son of the former bantamweight contender, will 
make his pro debut Sunday on a card promoted by Don Chargin in Sacramento. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Nunn gets most of the attention, but Mike McCallum might be the best 
middleweight champion. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Just once, I'd like to hear an NFL executive say after drafting a player, "We 
knew he'd still be around when our turn came."

WHO WERE THOSE, UH, MASKED LAKERS?; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: RILEY SITS JOHNSON, WORTHY AND THOMPSON, AND L.A. IS BEATEN BY 
A CLUB-RECORD 42 POINTS IN PORTLAND.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doing his part on Earth Day, Laker Coach Pat Riley implemented his own form of 
energy conservation by sitting out most of his starters in Sunday night's final 
regular-season game against the Portland Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
Riley's preplayoff move, not unprecedented for him, resulted in the worst loss 
in the franchise's history. The Lakers were pounded by the Portland Trail 
Blazers, 130-88, a 42-point deficit that eclipsed their previous mark for 
futility. 
</P>
<P>
In 1966, the Lakers lost by 39 points to the San Francisco Warriors. The 
circumstances were different. It was played in November and, presumably, all 
the Laker players who were able to play did. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time Riley has rested starters heading into the playoffs. 
At the end of the 1984-85 season, Riley left Magic Johnson and Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar in Los Angeles when the Lakers traveled to Kansas City to end the 
regular season. For that, the Lakers were fined by the NBA because they did not 
suit up non-injured players and gave no legitimate reason for leaving them 
home. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Riley had Johnson, James Worthy and Mychal Thompson dressed and 
taped and ready. But they did not leave the bench. Along with Byron Scott, back 
in Los Angeles nursing his sprained left ankle, Riley said he did not want to 
risk another injury to a significant player before Friday night's first-round 
playoff opener against the Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
"It really was an insignificant game for us," Riley said. "I do want to 
apologize to the Portland fans. They paid their money to see us play. But this 
game was bigger than that for us. I had a gut feeling that we might get 
(injuries) if we played our guys. It's always a war up here." 
</P>
<P>
Although Trail Blazer Coach Rick Adelman said he understood Riley's motives, 
team president Harry Glickman told the Portland Oregonian he planned to call 
the NBA office to complain about Riley's action. 
</P>
<P>
"If I told you what I think of it, it wouldn't be quotable in a family 
newspaper," Glickman said. "Any game in this league you play, even though it's 
meaningless, you have an obligation to try to win." 
</P>
<P>
Portland forward Buck Williams said the Lakers might have been avoiding another 
confrontation. Portland won the season series, three games to two. 
</P>
<P>
"(Riley) accepts the fact we've arrived," Williams told Portland writers. "He 
did not want to gamble psychologically about getting into a war with us and 
losing. It's just easier not to show up." 
</P>
<P>
Winning obviously was not the Laker priority Sunday. They had already secured 
the franchise's third-best record ever -- 63 victories -- after beating the 
Clippers on Saturday night. In the Clipper game, Johnson played 35 minutes; 
Worthy 38. 
</P>
<P>
"I made my decision (Saturday) night," Riley said. "We found out last year that 
injuries are a big thing. I just didn't want to push it. That is my privilege." 
</P>
<P>
When Riley was asked whether he might be fined for resting three starters, he 
said: "I tell you what, I did it (benched starters) for disciplinary reasons. 
The reason was that we had the league's best record." 
</P>
<P>
Adelman said he understood Riley's thinking and might have done something 
similar had he been in such a situation. He also said he was proud of the Trail 
Blazers for playing hard anyway and achieving a franchise record of 59 
victories in a season. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised (Riley) didn't play all of those guys," Adelman said. "I was 
sure he'd cut down the minutes those guys would play. But I don't have a 
problem with it, because it's his decision as a coach. We were still trying to 
play for something." 
</P>
<P>
Portland fans, however, were not so understanding. They booed the Lakers 
throughout the game -- even afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Laker players held out of the lineup were supportive of Riley and happy to be 
given the night off. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people who understand basketball and its strategy at this important 
time in the season understand why we did it," Worthy said. "Those who are upset 
don't understand. They don't see the whole picture. We wanted to stay healthy." 
</P>
<P>
Added Johnson: "We've always done this as a precaution. . . . (Riley) did the 
right thing. We have to look ahead to the playoffs. That's the way it goes. We 
saw Byron fall (to a sprained ankle a week ago), and we didn't want it to 
happen again." 
</P>
<P>
Told that this was the franchise's most lopsided loss ever, Johnson said: "We 
can live with that. It's over now until Friday." 
</P>
<P>
With Scott out and three other starters resting, the starting lineup for the 
Lakers: Vlade Divac at center, Larry Drew and Jay Vincent at guards, Orlando 
Woolridge and A.C. Green at forwards. 
</P>
<P>
Green was the only regular Laker starter to put in his normal time. As 
indestructible as plastic, Green has played 321 consecutive regular-season 
games, among the NBA active leaders in consecutive games played. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the Lakers were blown out as they have never been blown out 
before. They trailed by 25 at halftime, and then it got really ugly.

MURPHY HOMERS AS BRAVES STOP REDS, 3-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For the past two seasons, Cincinnati Reds left-hander Tom Browning has started 
more games than any other pitcher in the National League. He has also served up 
more home run balls. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday at Cincinnati, Browning gave up a home run that ended the Reds' 
nine-game winning streak to start the season. After Atlanta's Jeff Blauser and 
Jim Presley singled to start the game, Dale Murphy hit a homer off Browning and 
the Braves ended their seven-game losing streak, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Glavine and Mike Stanton combined on a seven-hitter against the Reds, who 
entered the game with a team average of .337. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds chased Glavine (1-2) in the eighth and had two runners on with two 
out. Stanton walked the first batter he faced before challenging the hottest 
hitter in baseball -- Barry Larkin. 
</P>
<P>
But Stanton got Larkin to ground out for his second save. It was Larkin's first 
hitless game. 
</P>
<P>
"Holding them to one run, I thought Glavine and Stanton were excellent," Murphy 
said. "Our pitchers did an excellent job of keeping their guys off of base." 
</P>
<P>
Last season Browning had 37 starts and allowed 31 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy was batting .206 when he hit the homer, his second of the season. 
Murphy's first homer was also off Browning, who has yielded three in 23 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time this season the Reds did not score first. 
</P>
<P>
Glavine is 5-2 lifetime against the Reds. He was 14-8 for the Braves last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we wouldn't win them all," Red third baseman Chris Sabo said. "Glavine 
is tough. He always pitches well against us." 
</P>
<P>
Manager Lou Piniella lost for the first time with Cincinnati. The Reds' winning 
streak, which included four victories over Atlanta, was their longest since 
1975, when they won the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 3, San Diego 1 -- Steve Bedrosian has been pitching with a heavy 
heart since it was learned that his youngest son, Cody, has leukemia, but he's 
still getting hitters out. 
</P>
<P>
Given inspiration in a note from his wife, Bedrosian picked up his second save 
in two games at San Diego. He retired all six men he faced in the two games. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife, Tammy, inspired me with a note she put in my bag before we left on 
the trip," Bedrosian said. "Basically, she was reassuring us that we would beat 
this thing." 
</P>
<P>
Atlee Hammaker held the Padres to three hits until he walked the leadoff man in 
the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Bass hit a two-run homer for the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
New York 5, Montreal 0 -- Sid Fernandez had a 14-5 record last season and was 
probably the Mets' best pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
But there was real concern when the left-hander pitched poorly in his first two 
starts this season. 
</P>
<P>
All was forgotten after this performance at New York. Fernandez gave up only 
two hits, both singles by Tim Raines, and romped to his first victory. 
</P>
<P>
"In his other two starts," Manager Davey Johnson said, "he had no command of 
his pitches. He was going to throw 115 pitches today, but he only needed 110." 
</P>
<P>
Keith Miller gave Fernandez all the offense he needed with a two-run homer in 
the third. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 3, Chicago 2 -- Left-hander Neal Heaton, who was struggling to stay 
in the majors in July, is currently one of the hottest pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
He started last season 1-7, but won his last five decisions. 
</P>
<P>
He gave up five hits and two runs in six innings at Chicago to improve his 
record to 3-0 and increase his two-season winning streak to eight games. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Bonilla doubled home two runs in a three-run rally in the fourth. Bonilla 
leads the NL with 16 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates, who finished fifth last season, lead the East. The Cubs have lost 
four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 5, St. Louis 3 -- Randy Ready hit a two-run home run and drove in 
three runs as the Phillies swept the three-game series. 
</P>
<P>
Ozzie Smith returned and had two hits and drove in a run, but couldn't stop the 
Cardinals from losing their fourth consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time since June 27-29, 1986, that the Phillies swept the 
Cardinals at Busch Stadium. St. Louis has lost five consecutive home games. DAN

Ryne Sandberg set a major league record for second basemen with his 480th 
consecutive errorless play Sunday for the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
Sandberg caught a throw from third baseman Luis Salazar in the fifth inning, 
forcing Pittsburgh's Wally Backman at second. 
</P>
<P>
Sandberg broke the previous mark of 479 chances set by Philadelphia's Manny 
Trillo from April 8 to July 31, 1982. Trillo's stretch extended over 89 games, 
plus two partial games. The game, won by Pittsburgh, 3-2, was Sandberg's 102nd 
in a row without an error.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
MARINERS HOLD OFF ATHLETICS, 5-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Seattle Mariners came out of spring training believing they were a better 
team than the one that finished sixth in the American League West last season. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't expect to challenge the Oakland Athletics, but they did expect to 
improve on 73-89. 
</P>
<P>
After opening with a victory over the Angels, they lost eight of nine games. 
</P>
<P>
But on Sunday, Jeffrey Leonard and Ken Griffey Jr. each drove in two runs and 
Erik Hanson gave up six hits and struck out seven in 6 2/3 innings as the 
Mariners beat the A's, 5-2. The victory gave Seattle a split of the four-game 
series. 
</P>
<P>
Griffey, batting .373, went five for eight with a homer and six RBIs the past 
two games against Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to go out and forget about last year," said Griffey, who was 
three for 20 against Oakland last season and two for 15 against the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle's victory came against an Oakland lineup filled with reserves. Regulars 
Rickey Henderson, Mark McGwire and Dave Henderson all got the day off. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't have their starting nine out there," Hanson said, "but everybody 
here's a big leaguer, so it doesn't matter who they send up. They're all in the 
big leagues." 
</P>
<P>
Oakland Manager Tony La Russa, whose club was nearly no-hit two nights ago by 
Brian Holman, left the series impressed by the Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to be tough; they've got a good thing going," La Russa said. 
"Hanson's got a good fastball. He was able to get strikeouts. He's got a good 
changeup, but he didn't have to use it much." 
</P>
<P>
Texas 10, New York 4 -- The final score doesn't show it, but former Dodger Tim 
Leary turned in another solid performance for the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Leary's own error with two out in the first inning at Arlington, Tex., allowed 
Harold Baines to come to the plate and the designated hitter socked a three-run 
home run. 
</P>
<P>
Leary, who struck out eight, allowed only one other hit until he was removed 
after Gary Pettis singled with two out in the seventh and Texas leading, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers scored two in the seventh and Mike Stanley hit a three-run homer in 
the eighth to make it a rout. Rafael Palmeiro also homered in the eighth, both 
of the home runs coming off bullpen ace Dave Righetti. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees, after winning four of five, have lost five in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Although he gave up 11 hits in 7 1/3 innings, Kevin Brown joined teammate Nolan 
Ryan with a 3-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 5, Chicago 2 -- Cory Snyder hit a two-run home run in the fifth 
inning at Cleveland, but that was not the big news. 
</P>
<P>
Indian shortstop Felix Fermin, in his 655th at-bat, finally hit his first home 
run. It came off relief pitcher Donn Pall for the final run in the seventh 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
Bud Black gave up five hits, but just one earned run before needing help in the 
ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 7, Toronto 1 -- Most pitchers don't enjoy facing the talent-laden 
Blue Jays, but Kansas City right-hander Tom Gordon is making a habit of beating 
them. 
</P>
<P>
With Bo Jackson hitting his first home run, a two-run smash in the first 
inning, Gordon improved his record to 4-0 against the Blue Jays. He gave up 
five hits and struck out nine in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I just concentrate more when I face these guys," Gordon said. "They've 
got such a strong lineup. If there's one guy on their team who gives me 
trouble, it would be George Bell." 
</P>
<P>
Bell hit his fourth home run for the Toronto run in the sixth. He has hit 17 
home runs against the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 3, Detroit 2 -- Detroit pitchers issued 12 walks in this 12-inning 
game at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
The last, by bullpen ace Mike Henneman, came with the bases loaded and nobody 
out to force in the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Worthington's double, an intentional walk and a bunt single loaded the 
bases against Henneman. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 4, Milwaukee 2 -- The Brewers' club-record string of 31 consecutive 
scoreless innings ended in the third inning at Milwaukee and they lost in the 
11th on a two-out, two-run single by Jody Reed. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis Burks singled in the run in the third that ended the Red Sox scoreless 
string at 22 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Smith pitched three scoreless innings to get the victory for the Red Sox, 
who tied it in the eighth on Dwight Evans' second home run of the season. DAN

<P>
Rick Leach and Jim Pugh strengthened their Davis Cup credentials Sunday with a 
7-6 (8-6), 4-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 victory over Ken Flach and Robert Seguso in the 
$300,000 WCT World Doubles Championship in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Leach and Pugh, ranked No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, in the world in men's 
doubles, received the $100,000 first prize. 
</P>
<P>
Flach and Seguso, who were displaced as U.S. Davis Cup doubles regulars last 
year by Leach and Pugh, received $60,000. It was only their third tournament 
together in five months, and the only one in which they won a match. 
</P>
<P>
Flach and Seguso failed to capitalize on eight set points in the first set, 
four on Pugh's serve at 4-5 and four in the tiebreak, which they led 6-2. Leach 
and Pugh won six points in a row to take that tiebreak 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
After Flach and Seguso tied the match at one set apiece, Leach and Pugh 
captured the critical third-set tiebreak 7-4. Leach hit back-to-back pinpoint 
placements in the breaker for a 5-2 lead, and Seguso missed a volley on set 
point. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Monica Seles of Yugoslavia needed only 54 minutes to beat Katerina 
Maleeva of Bulgaria, 6-1, 6-0, in the final of a $250,000 tournament at Largo, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Seles, who has won three consecutive tournaments and 15 consecutive matches, 
dominated from the baseline, hitting 32 winners to Maleeva's nine. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't missing too many balls," said Seles, who is ranked third in the 
world. "I know I have been saying all week that I wasn't playing well. If I 
said that today, I would be lying." 
</P>
<P>
Seles allowed Maleeva no points on her serve during the first set and only six 
in the second. She broke Maleeva's serve six of seven times and faced only one 
break point, which she saved with a backhand winner. 
</P>
<P>
In the doubles final, the top-seeded team of Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and 
Mercedes Paz defeated Sandra Cecchini and Laura Gildemeister, 6-2, 6-0. Sanchez 
Vicario and Paz have played together for only two tournaments, winning both. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Aguilera of Spain rallied to beat Guy Forget of France, 2-6, 6-3, 6-4, to 
win a $260,000 tournament at Nice, France. 
</P>
<P>
Aguilera earned $32,400 for his fourth singles title and Forget got $19,820. 
</P>
<P>
Aguilera was ranked as high as No. 7 in the world in 1984. However, he has 
reached only six career finals. 
</P>
<P>
Currently No. 51 in the world, he was the highest-ranked player left after the 
tournament lost all eight seeded players before the semifinals. Forget is No. 
71.

Brett Bodine earned his first Winston Cup victory in 79 career starts on Sunday 
by holding off Darrell Waltrip at the First Union 400 NASCAR stock car race at 
North Wilkesboro, N.C., Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
Bodine beat Waltrip to the checkered flag by less than a second to win $50,682. 
</P>
<P>
The finish was controversial. Bodine was designated the leader following the 
final caution flag, although he had pitted and leaders Waltrip and Dale 
Earnhardt stayed on the track. 
</P>
<P>
Following the delay, the pace car picked up Earnhardt's Chevrolet. But NASCAR 
officials directed it to pick up Bodine's car instead.

17-1 CHOICE DELEGANT OVERCOMES VALDALI TO WIN SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another San Juan Capistrano. Another victory for Whittingham. 
</P>
<P>
Ho, hum, you say. Well, actually, the 51st running of Santa Anita's longest 
race Sunday was anything but routine. 
</P>
<P>
Where father Charlie had stood 14 times before, Michael Whittingham was the 
trainer in the winner's circle this time after Delegant's improbable 17-1 upset 
victory in the $500,000 Grade I race. 
</P>
<P>
Running the race of his life, the 6-year-old son of Grey Dawn II closed to beat 
another 17-1 shot, Valdali, a length and three quarters in 2:46 3/5 for the 
mile and three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
What was a memorable Capistrano for Michael Whittingham was one Charlie 
Whittingham would just as soon forget. 
</P>
<P>
Live The Dream, one of his two entries, was sixth at 21-1. The only horse he 
finished in front of was Frankly Perfect, who broke down in the stretch and 
whose racing days are over. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkster, the 6-5 favorite, was third, a half-length behind Valdali. Allowed to 
roll on the lead in his two previous tries over the course, the Silver Hawk 
colt seemed to resent being restrained and it didn't help that he was joined 
down the backside by Santangelo, the longest shot in the race at 45-1. 
</P>
<P>
El Senor, the 2-1 second choice, was fourth, almost 3 1/2 lengths behind 
Hawkster. He never really ignited as he had when winning last month's San Luis 
Rey. 
</P>
<P>
In scoring the largest upset in San Juan history -- in terms of odds, anyway -- 
Delegant provided Kent Desormeaux with his biggest victory and Mike Whittingham 
with his biggest since Skywalker took the 1986 Breeders' Cup Classic. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels good because he's a barn favorite," Whittingham said. "He's just a 
character. He's got a lot of personality. 
</P>
<P>
"Plus, I love this race. It's my favorite race to watch. Delegant deteriorated 
a little last year, but he's really come around since he came back to 
California. He ran well when he was in Chicago, but he didn't have his usual 
kick. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected him to run well, but he ran better than I expected. I felt the 
further he went, the better he'd run. He came up to the race well, and we had 
pointed him for this race. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he could win, but I never could have expected him to win so easy. 
When I saw him coming, it wasn't registering, but he just pulled away from 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Although Whittingham said Delegant had flourished since returning to Southern 
California, there was no reason to believe he could win the San Juan. 
</P>
<P>
He had just finished fifth of six in the San Luis Rey, his ninth consecutive 
defeat. The son of the brilliant mare Dahlia hadn't won since Sept. 4 at 
Arlington Park. 
</P>
<P>
In receipt of nine pounds from Frankly Perfect, eight from Hawkster and six 
from El Senor, Delegant picked the right time to collect his seventh victory 31 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
"It was tight quarters leaving there and coming off the hill," Desormeaux said. 
"Nobody figured where we'd be plodding around there for the first mile. I 
thought El Senor would be the main threat. I thought if I could stay a length 
ahead of him, he would push me home. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the richest race I've won and my first Grade I. Everyone said you had 
to come to California to win the biggest races, and I guess they were right." 
</P>
<P>
Second in the San Luis Rey and and winner of the Oak Tree Invitational in his 
two previous appearances on the Santa Anita turf, Hawkster's biggest problem 
Sunday, according to Pat Valenzuela, was Santangelo. 
</P>
<P>
"I was happy with the way things were going until Robbie (Davis on Santangelo) 
came up at the five-eighths pole riding his horse. I couldn't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
"Robbie said his trainer (Gedaliah Goodman) told him to ride like that. 
Hawkster was relaxed until that point. I think (Hawkster's) goal in the race 
was to get me beat and that's what he did." 
</P>
<P>
A multiple-stakes winner owned by Bruce McNall, Wayne Gretzky and Jerry Buss -- 
who recently purchased an interest -- Frankly Perfect apparently stepped in a 
hole. Whittingham thought he had fractured a cannon bone and X-rays will be 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
"Chris (McCarron) said he had a handful of horse and he hit a hole," said 
Charlie Whittingham. "He said it was all he could do to pull him to keep him 
from falling." 
</P>
<P>
A horse a lot of people felt would have won the San Juan Capistrano made his 
U.S. debut earlier in the program. 
</P>
<P>
Golden Pheasant, a 4-year-old son of Caro owned by McNall and Gretzky and 
trained by Charlie Whittingham, rallied from last to beat his nine outclassed 
allowance rivals in a swift 1:45 4/5 for the 1 1/8 miles. 
</P>
<P>
First or second in five of his six starts in Europe, including a Group II 
victory and a near-miss in a Group I race, Golden Pheasant was hand-ridden to 
the wire by McCarron, beating Fly Till Dawn. 
</P>
<P>
The 90-day Santa Anita meeting concludes today with the $113,400 San Jacinto 
Handicap at 1 1/4 miles on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
A restricted race, the San Jacinto attracted 11 entrants, topped by Royal 
Reach, Wretham and Just As Lucky. 
</P>
<P>
A reformed claimer, Royal Reach is vastly improved for trainer David Hofmans 
and was second in the San Marino and Santa Gertudes behind Super Ready and 
Super May, respectively. Previously, he had won an allowance race Feb. 11 by 
four lengths. 
</P>
<P>
Trained by Neil Drysdale, Wretham was fourth in the San Luis Obispo despite a 
wide trip, and earlier he scored a 10-1 upset in the San Gabriel Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Overmatched in the San Luis Rey, Just As Lucky was third in the San Luis 
Obispo, and he has placed in 10 of 15 turf starts. 
</P>
<P>
Others in the field include Crimson Slew, who will race coupled with Royal 
Reach; Master Treaty, who hasn't won since he captured the San Jacinto last 
year; Kaboi, Glaros, Payant, Dream Of Fame, Silent Prince and Charlatan. 
</P>
<P>
For the final program, there is a Pick Six carryover of more than $169,000.

JACK SMITH: BALL, BOOK AND BLACK TIE: AN OPPORTUNITY TO READ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As one who attends a good many black-tie banquets, I was delighted recently to 
receive an invitation to "The Stay Home and Read a Book Ball." 
</P>
<P>
This "novel event," as they called it, is sponsored by the Los Angeles Library 
Assn. (LALA), which has supported the Los Angeles Public Library since 1872. 
The invitation requested "the pleasure of your company . . . Thursday, the 26th 
of April, at any time o'clock wherever you are." 
</P>
<P>
In a separate letter I was invited to autograph two of my books to be used as 
door prizes. I didn't know how there could be door prizes to an event that had 
no door, but I complied. 
</P>
<P>
One of the signatories of the letter was Nancy Dannevik, liaison for LALA's 
authors advisory committee. I phoned her and asked her how the ball worked. 
</P>
<P>
She explained, quite accurately, that when you go to a real ball you have to 
"wear a tuxedo and uncomfortable shoes and eat rubber chicken." And you spend a 
lot of money, most of which goes for food and valet parking and a ballroom and 
table service. Not a lot gets through to the cause. This way, she pointed out, 
your contribution goes directly to the cause, with a minimum of overhead, and 
you stay home in comfort and read a book. 
</P>
<P>
She said the Writers Guild was cooperating by giving LALA its mailing list. 
"After all," she said, "movies are very popular, and where do the writers go to 
get ideas for their scripts? Books." 
</P>
<P>
She couldn't be more right. Think of the wonderful movies that have come 
directly from books. "The Bible," for one. What screenwriter could have turned 
that one out without divine assistance? What about "The Ten Commandments"? We'd 
never have seen Charlton Heston part the Red Sea if it hadn't been for Exodus. 
Even such pseudo-historical movies as "Gone With the Wind" have come from 
books, and such science-fiction classics as "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea." And 
don't forget "Les Miserables." 
</P>
<P>
The Stay at Home and Read a Book Ball will give many of us a chance to read 
those books we've always meant to read but never had the time for. I may take 
another crack at "A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes" by 
Stephen Hawking, which is supposed to be accessible to the layman, but which I 
found rather intimidating the first time out. 
</P>
<P>
Also standing patiently on my shelf -- put there with the most honorable of 
intentions -- are "The Blind Watchmaker: Why the evidence of evolution reveals 
a universe without design" by Richard Dawkins, and "Infinite in All Directions" 
by Freeman Dyson. I have made several passes as these books, but somehow I 
always end up reading a detective novel by Robert B. Parker or Elmore Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
I think I'm pretty well up on Jane Austen. I try to read one of her books every 
year. There is something very modern about Jane. She is a true progenitor of 
Jacqueline Briskin and other contemporary women authors. On the other hand, I 
may read one of the classics that I missed as a boy: perhaps "The Last of the 
Mohicans" by James Fenimore Cooper. What a chance to fill in a blank spot in my 
education! 
</P>
<P>
The other night we saw a movie on TV called "Major League," about a baseball 
player who was getting his second chance in the majors. But he had lost his 
girlfriend because she was a librarian and he had never even read "Moby Dick." 
We see him on the team plane reading "Moby Dick." So it's only a comic book 
version. At least it's a book. (He gets the girl back.) 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing to keep one from rereading an old favorite. A really good book 
is better the second time. I may have a second go at Fitzgerald's "This Side of 
Paradise," which I liked much better than Hemingway's "The Sun Also Rises." Or 
I might go back to one of Peter De Vries' comic classics, like "Comfort Me With 
Apples."

PROSPECTS BRIGHTENING FOR DANCE FACILITY

"Go check out how long it took to build the Parthenon," said Barbara Bain, the 
actress who is president of the board of trustees of the Dance Gallery. "I'm 
serious." 
</P>
<P>
The Dance Gallery's prospects have sounded like a Greek tragedy at times, but 
at its ninth annual membership luncheon Thursday at the Bel Age Hotel, 
supporters of the Dance Gallery Guild heard the news they've waited nine years 
to hear: Their 1,000-seat dance performance facility is really going to be 
built. 
</P>
<P>
When? Well, no one said exactly, but a new location has been found on the 
California Plaza at 4th and Olive streets, a major triumph in itself. "The 
amount of paper to write down the issues involved would fill four ballrooms," 
Bain said with a sigh. The project was derailed two years ago when supporters 
failed to come up with the funds to begin construction at another location. Now 
new funding is being sought through a bond issue, said Arline Chambers, Dance 
Gallery executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Bunker Hill Associates, developers of California Plaza, announced it was 
kicking in $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley, an early Dance Gallery booster, donned a purple tie for the 
luncheon, which honored the tall, elegant Judith Jamison, appointed artistic 
director of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater last December. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a white Donna Karan pantsuit over a leotard, Jamison the complex 
"looks like it's really happening. The vibes are fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
Among those attending were the late Alvin Ailey's mother, Lula Cooper, and 
dancer Fayard Nicholas, who appears with his brother Harold in Janet Jackson's 
new video, "Rhythm Nation."

ONE FAMILY THAT'S A FLOCK OF FUN;

As "To the Birdhouse" opens, Alice Brody is a happy woman. She has just married 
Peter Eiger, a rare bird of solitary habits who makes his living doing baseball 
statistics. Alice's brother, young Willie, is still in his bachelor stage, 
about midway through a string of ethnically variegated girlfriends, the current 
one a Japanese sociologist named Yuki. Alice's father has flown from the family 
nest and married again, but the rest of the relatives -- Alice's relentlessly 
eccentric grandma and an assortment of aunts and great-aunts -- make up a 
friendly, nurturing flock. 
</P>
<P>
Only Brenda, Alice's mother, seems unhappy. A kind and beautiful dove, she has 
somehow gotten mixed up with Louie Scifo, a kind of immigrant Italian carrion 
crow. Louie deals in stolen goods and secondhand furniture. He wears gabardine 
leisure suits and butts in where he's not wanted. He's an embarrassment, a 
disaster, and although Alice -- as a newly married woman -- wishes domestic 
contentment on everyone she knows, she draws the line at Louie. He's a curse. 
</P>
<P>
Brenda soon finds this out for herself. She breaks up with Louie, but he will 
have none of it. His heart (if he has a heart) is broken. In a string of 
bizarre incidents, Louie begins the secondary courtship of the already rejected 
lover: He bashes in Brenda's windows, puts black widow spiders under her 
pillow, makes crank phone calls to her and her extended family at all hours of 
the day and night. Finally, he hauls out his binoculars and begins watching the 
Brody family. Alice can't look out of a window into a tree without seeing a 
ClamberingLouie, his binoculars trained on her. 
</P>
<P>
For Alice, this is particularly disconcerting. She is a bird watcher by trade, 
putting out a newsletter for New York Birders. The morning after her wedding 
night, she rises early to take the subway to Prospect Park, all for the sake of 
a Bullock's Oriole, blown in from the Rockies on the mighty wings of a winter 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
The story of Alice's first year of married life, then, is punctuated by typed 
lists of birds she spots: On Sept. 15, at the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge: "1. 
2 Pied-Billed Grebes, 2. 14 double-crested cormorants, 3. 2 great blue herons," 
and so on. When Alice is happy, she sees a lot (this particular list runs to 53 
items). When she's sad, or tormented by Louie, she finds only: "1. 67 Cicada 
shells." 
</P>
<P>
By now, the family has moved to Brenda's summer home in Westport, Conn. Louie 
has gotten himself hired as a gardener by the woman next door and runs a power 
mower back and forth across their yard, howling, "Brenda! Brenda!" Things have 
gotten out of hand, and Alice must devise a strategy to drive the Clambering 
Louie out of their collective lives. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, this book is not for everyone. You have to buy into the idea that 
all of us are terminally weird and driven by behavior patterns that are best 
described as birdbrained. Ethically, I must disclose my own bias here: This 
review was written on a day when seven California Jays, two pairs of nesting 
doves, one pair of nesting quail, eight house finches, one towhee and one 
red-shafted flicker flew through our patio. (But no Clambering Louies, thank 
God.)

CINCINNATI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One hundred and fifty years ago, aristocrat Nicholas Longworth of this city 
commissioned a marble sculpture of Eve, standing naked in the Garden of Eden. 
</P>
<P>
The local art critics insisted that it be covered with a calico dress. 
</P>
<P>
Art appreciation in Cincinnati has not changed much in a century and a half. 
Two weeks ago a county grand jury indicted the Contemporary Arts Center of 
Cincinnati and its director, Dennis Barrie, on obscenity charges for displaying 
the works of photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit, "Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment," consists of 175 
portraits, nudes and still lifes by the late photographer. The grand jury, 
prodded by a sheriff and a prosecutor with national anti-pornography 
reputations, objected to seven of the pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the shots show homoerotic images. Each of those pictures resulted in a 
separate charge of pandering. The other two pictures named in the indictment 
are shots of nude children. Those pictures resulted in charges of "using a 
minor in nudity oriented material," a 5-year-old Ohio law that the Supreme 
Court of the United States held to be constitutional last week. 
</P>
<P>
Barrie and the arts center are scheduled to appear before Hamilton County 
Municipal Judge David Albanese for a pre-trial hearing April 30. It is 
conceivable, though unlikely, that the case could be tried and settled before 
the show's scheduled close May 26. 
</P>
<P>
But even if the show ends before the trial begins the case cannot be made moot, 
said Asst. Cincinnati Solicitor Karl Kadon. The prosecutors can, and they have 
indicated that they will, seek a conviction after Mapplethorpe's pictures are 
only a memory in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, thanks to an order from a federal judge at the behest of the 
museum, the police are prevented from seizing any of the photos or interfering 
with the operation of the exhibit. The pictures remain on the walls of the 
gallery and the crowds keep lining up to see them in record numbers. 
</P>
<P>
The only interruption of the show came the day the indictments were handed 
down, and the Cincinnati police closed the gallery for about an hour while they 
videotaped the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
To outsiders, the televised sight of police officers with drawn billy clubs 
clearing out an art gallery may have seemed surreal. To those who have lived in 
Cincinnati, it seemed like business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
Last year members of the city's vice squad sat through a performance of "Equus" 
at the local playhouse, just to see if the award-winning play violated 
community standards. 
</P>
<P>
There is no red light district in this city of 369,000. There are no adult book 
stores or movie theaters. The local video stores do not carry X-rated tapes. 
</P>
<P>
It used to be said that Cincinnatians went across the Ohio River to wide-open 
Newport, Ky., for their sin. 
</P>
<P>
But even Newport's sordid charms are fading. There are still assorted burlesque 
clubs on Monmouth Street, but repeated reform movements have had a cumulative 
effect during the last 20 years, and now the gambling is underground and the 
performers have to keep their G-strings and tassels in place. 
</P>
<P>
To find out why Cincinnati and its environs have come to be known as the 
bluenosed bastion of morality you have to go back to the 19th Century, 
according to Allen Brown, former counsel to the Cincinnati chapter of the 
American Civil Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been over 100 years since there was a significant foreign immigration 
wave into Cincinnati. There has been very little new cultural stock that would 
force any cultural diversity," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
"The single biggest virtue of Cincinnati is its serene conformity and its ease 
of livability," he said. But that tranquillity is combined with an almost total 
countywide domination by the Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
"That total domination makes it so that the leaders look for problems that 
offer no resistance. That way they can look effective and please the little old 
ladies who dominate the ballot box," said Brown. In his view, pornography 
became a straw man, a villain on which society's ills could be blamed, with no 
noticeable backlash. 
</P>
<P>
The issue moved from one that may have been genuinely held by a core group of 
activists, to an issue that is now politically expedient for everyone, said 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
The active public policy that resulted in charges against an art museum and its 
director began in the late 1950s and early 1960s with the anti-pornography 
movements of Charles Keating. Keating, the same man now enmeshed in the Lincoln 
Savings and Loan scandal, was then a young Cincinnati attorney full of 
religious zeal and a hate for "smut peddlers." 
</P>
<P>
He founded Citizens for Decent Literature, later called Citizens for Decency 
Through Law. He used the organization to wield a combination of legal and 
economic pressure against theater owners and bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
By 1970, the group claimed to have 275 chapters nationwide and others abroad. 
By then Keating was nationally recognized as an anti-porn crusader. In 1969, 
then-President Richard Nixon appointed Keating to sit on the Federal Commission 
on Obscenity and Pornography. 
</P>
<P>
When the commission issued its report in 1970, a majority of the 21 members 
recommended the repeal of most anti-pornography laws dealing with acts between 
consenting adults, and Keating blasted the report as "a Magna Carta for the 
pornographer" and issued a minority report that said the commission was 
enthralled by the ACLU. 
</P>
<P>
Keating convened the leadership of the Citizens for Decency Through Law in 
Cincinnati to critique the commission's majority report. CDL announced its 
readiness to offer legal and financial assistance to private citizens wanting 
to fight pornography. 
</P>
<P>
Such a legal attack followed in 1972 when Keating filed a civil suit against 
the Cinema X Theater in Cincinnati, which specialized in sexually explicit 
films. Keating persuaded the judge that the films violated Ohio obscenity 
standards and the judge ordered the theater closed until it changed its fare. 
The theater went out of business. 
</P>
<P>
Overt activities by Citizens for Decency Through Law seemed to fade a short 
time later, however. Eventually Keating left Cincinnati to pursue his business 
ventures in Arizona and California, but by then a new porn fighter had begun to 
dominate the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Simon L. Leis Jr., former Marine, a former assistant federal prosecutor and son 
of a local judge, was elected Hamilton County prosecutor in 1971. By the time 
he resigned in 1983 to become a judge, Leis could boast of having run virtually 
every X-rated operation in town out of business. 
</P>
<P>
Leis served one term as a Common Pleas Court judge before resigning from the 
bench in 1987 to run for county sheriff. He said at the time that he missed the 
front-line action of law enforcement. As sheriff he has technical authority 
over the whole county, although as a practical matter law enforcement in 
Cincinnati is generally left to the city Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
But last month, when an anti-pornography group known as Citizens for Community 
Values complained that the Mapplethorpe exhibit was coming to town, Leis 
publicly announced that if the Cincinnati cops wouldn't do their duty on the 
exhibit, he would. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Lawrence Whalen, unwilling to cede any authority to the sheriff's 
deputies, ordered his men to move on the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
As prosecutor, Leis has taken on Hustler magazine and its publisher Larry 
Flynt. The 1977 trial drew national attention because Leis used Ohio's 
organized crime statute to raise a misdemeanor complaint of pandering to a 
felony charge that could have resulted in a 25-year jail term. 
</P>
<P>
Leis won the case at trial, but it was overturned on appeal and ordered retried 
as a misdemeanor. In November, 1985, Leis' successor, Arthur Ney, agreed to a 
settlement in which the charges were dropped but Flynt agreed to pay more than 
$6,000 in court costs, which was more than the maximum fine the misdemeanor 
carried. 
</P>
<P>
But there was one other result from the Hustler case. Newsstands in Hamilton 
County do not carry the magazine as an act of self-censorship that keeps them 
from being drawn into any future organized-crime cases that the prosecutor 
might file. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of economic enforcement is what ultimately forced most of the X-rated 
movies and bookstores out of town, said attorney Brown. 
</P>
<P>
"The secret of Leis' success was ignoring the law and pressing bad cases. The 
mere act of prosecution brings unbearable economic pressure on marginal 
businesses," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Acting as the sword arm of Leis was Lt. Harold Mills, commander of the 
Cincinnati Police Vice Squad. By the time he retired in 1986, Mills had become 
a local cult figure. 
</P>
<P>
"Cincinnati is not vice free, but I think things really are different here than 
they are in other cities. It's the people. They make the difference because 
they support the enforcement actions," Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
Mills took over the vice squad after a 1975 police scandal in which the police 
chief and several other high-ranking officers lost their jobs. It was Leis who 
prosecuted the cops for a series of corruptions that included perjury, 
obstruction of justice and consorting with prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
"The scandal in '75 damn near toppled the Police Department," said Mills. 
"After that, nobody wanted to be seen as soft and we went after vice 100%. 
</P>
<P>
"Our attitude was, 'if it's a violation, we're going to arrest, and we're going 
to take it to court. And we had a prosecutor that was willing to go all the way 
with it," Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
That meant the hookers lolling around the statue of William Henry Harrison on 
Vine Street across from the public library had to move on. It meant full-time 
stakeouts on after-hours bars and dozens of arrests of ordinary people trying 
to save a few bucks by buying their liquor across the river in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
"You move them. That's the strategy. You can't eliminate vice, you can just 
make it move some place else. We made most of it move out of the downtown area 
and a lot of it moved clean out of the county," Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
The Royal Theater at 7th and Vine was one such target of Mills' interest. For 
years the theater had shown soft-core movies for an over-18 audience. The 
theater operators voluntarily cut the most explicit scenes from the films 
before the projectors ever got turned on, but that didn't stop the police from 
putting pressure on the business. 
</P>
<P>
"We never busted the theater itself, but we must have made a hundred arrests of 
customers in there for public indecency and stuff like that." The attention was 
so concentrated that it was almost impossible for a patron to go to the 
lavatories without bumping into someone from the vice squad. "They gave up and 
finally turned the place into a parking lot," Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
Mills, who retired in 1986, said he supported vigorous vice control because he 
believed prostitution, pornography and the like attracted other, more serious 
criminal activity. But, looking back, he says now that some of the enforcement 
action may have gotten ahead of what the community really wanted, or needed. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that people don't like stuff out in the open," Mills said. 
"Getting bookstores and movie theaters and prostitutes wasn't that hard, but it 
got tougher with the magazines. People don't like being told what they can read 
in their own home." 
</P>
<P>
The bust and prosecution of the art exhibit remind Mills of why he is glad he 
has retired. "It's not a good case. It will be harder than hell to prove it in 
court, and they aren't going to go out of business. 
</P>
<P>
"My philosophy was get the cases into court and let the jury decide. If the 
people on the jury come back and say it's OK, then it's time to quit doing 
something about it."

LIVE CREW'S 'NASTY' MAY BE CINCINNATI'S NEXT TARGET

The Hamilton County Sheriff's Department in Cincinnati has initiated an 
investigation to determine whether "As Nasty as They Want to Be," a sexually 
explicit album by the Miami-based rap group 2 Live Crew, violates obscenity 
codes in Ohio. The investigation was prompted by a complaint from Florida 
anti-obscenity crusader Jack Thompson, who faxed a transcription of six 2 Live 
Crew songs to Hamilton County Sheriff Simon Leis and to city police stations in 
Cincinnati and Dayton on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can say is that the matter is under investigation," said Frank Wiekel, 
director of relations for the Sheriff's Department. "The vice squad is looking 
into it and I would think that sometime (this) week we should be able to 
provide some sort of determination on it." 
</P>
<P>
The rap group's "Nasty" album has been declared obscene in four judicial 
circuits encompassing 13 counties in the state of Florida. The sexually 
explicit record has been deemed to violate obscenity codes in some counties in 
Indiana and Tennessee, while authorities in Pennsylvania and Washington have 
issued opinions declaring "Nasty" harmful to minors. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Assn. of Art Museum Directors, which represents 153 of the 
nation's largest art exhibition centers, will hold an emergency meeting of its 
board of directors at Cincinnati's Contemporary Arts Center today. The New 
York-based group said it would issue a statement after the special meeting, at 
which Dennis Barrie, the local center's director, is to appear as an invited 
guest. 
</P>
<P>
The association is headed by John Walsh, director of the J. Paul Getty Museum 
in Malibu, and was among the first establishment arts groups to take a strong 
position opposing restrictions on artistic freedom when last year's crisis over 
National Endowment for the Arts funding of controversial exhibits began. Walsh 
said the emergency board meeting had been called to "discuss what action should 
be taken by the directors of the nation's museums to defend First Amendment 
rights." CHUCK PHILIPS and ALLAN PARACHINI

LI PENG IN MOSCOW TO RELIEVE TENSIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng arrived today for the first visit in 26 years by a 
Chinese head of government to the Soviet Union, China's longtime rival for 
leadership of the Communist world. 
</P>
<P>
The four-day trip is to promote normal relations and ease border tensions at a 
time when both countries are confronted with serious domestic problems. 
</P>
<P>
The 61-year-old premier was expected to hold at least two rounds of talks with 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who last May went to China in the first visit 
by a Soviet leader in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
"Li's visit to the U.S.S.R. underscores the importance of continuing the 
Sino-Soviet dialogue at the summit level, which began a year ago and signaled 
the normalization of relations," Tass press agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Li was met at the airport by Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and Foreign Minister 
Eduard A. Shevardnadze. 
</P>
<P>
"I will be exchanging views with President Gorbachev, Chairman Ryzhkov and 
other comrades from the Soviet leadership on matters concerning bilateral 
relations and on major international issues of common concern," Li said at the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said Ryzhkov and Peng began meeting today but did not report what they 
were discussing. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's historic visit to China was overshadowed by student-led 
pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing, which ended weeks later when Li and 
other Chinese leaders sent in troops to crush the movement. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Gorbachev is contending with the crisis in Lithuania, which declared 
independence March 11. 
</P>
<P>
The official Chinese press, before Li's departure, said his trip would have 
"profound significance" on peace in Asia and the world.

For the third straight night gunfire from suspected gang members ripped through 
a Santa Ana neighborhood Sunday, striking a young boy in the back as he watched 
television and a woman who was sleeping in the next room, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Alvarez, 8, of Santa Ana was in serious condition at UCI Medical Center 
today with a single gunshot wound. The same bullet, police said, also grazed 
30-year-old Oselia Rojas, who was treated at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting was the latest in a wave of gang-related violence in Santa Ana 
that has left two teen-agers dead and three people wounded since Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's incident occurred around 10:45 p.m. as Carlos was watching television 
in his living room in the 2700 block of West Lingan Lane. 
</P>
<P>
Antonio Torres, a family friend who lives at the house, said a bullet burst 
through the wall, penetrated the boy's chair, tore through his upper back and 
exited his stomach. 
</P>
<P>
The same bullet, Torres said, then ripped through another wall before striking 
Rojas. 
</P>
<P>
"If my head had been moved over another inch, I would have been dead," Rojas 
said today during an interview at the Lingan Lane house. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth drive-by shooting at the house in three years, Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said investigators have not 
determined a motive for the attack, but Torres said it could have been aimed at 
another nephew who previously lived at the house and is a reputed gang member. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said police are trying to determine if the shooting is connected to two 
others that claimed the lives of two teen-agers over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, 17-year-old Roger Ochoa died after being shot four times in 
the back during a fight at a birthday party with suspected gang members. And 
15-year-old Cesar Salgado was gunned down early Sunday as he and a friend were 
walking away from another party, about nine blocks away from Friday's shooting. 
He died at UCI Medical Center.

A man suspected of beating his wife held deputies at bay in Orange for nearly 
two hours before he walked out of his home, yelled out his wife's name, put a 
gun to his head and killed himself, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Phillips, 57, died of a single gunshot to the head at the front door of 
his home in the 9300 block of Batavia Street, Lt. Richard Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began about 8:45 p.m. Sunday when Phillips' wife, whose name was 
not released, fled the home, called deputies and reported that her husband had 
beaten her, Lt. Larry Richey said. 
</P>
<P>
"We went to the house with the knowledge that he had been drinking and had a 
gun in his possession," Richey said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies telephoned the man and told him to come out of the house and 
surrender, but he refused, Richey said. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, about 10:21 p.m., he came the front door, yelled his wife's name and put 
the handgun to his head and fired one shot, killing himself," Richey said.

Two minor earthquakes one minute apart rattled a remote desert area near Joshua 
Tree National Monument early today, but there were no reports of damage or 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 people telephoned the San Bernardino Sheriff's Department at Joshua 
Tree asking if there had been a quake, a dispatcher said. No one reported any 
damage or injury. 
</P>
<P>
A quake measuring 2.6 struck at 2:29 a.m., and it was followed by a 3.0 temblor 
at 2:30 a.m., said Robert Finn of Caltech in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The epicenter was 18 miles northeast of Palm Springs and 120 miles east of Los 
Angeles. The quakes weren't related to a rash of temblors throughout the state 
last week.

A U.S. judge came under a blistering attack today for saying AIDS victims who 
spread the disease should be exiled to Australia. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Court Judge Robert Potter was criticized by Australian groups set 
up to combat the deadly virus and callers to radio talks shows, who described 
the remarks to students at a Charlotte, N.C., college as "frightening." 
</P>
<P>
Potter, nicknamed "Maximum Bob" for his tough sentences, told students at 
Belmont Abbey College on Thursday that airplanes carrying drugs from Colombia 
should be shot down and that AIDS patients who spread their disease should be 
sent to Australia. 
</P>
<P>
The judge's comments were published Friday in the Charlotte Observer. The 
afternoon tabloid, the Daily Mirror, spread the judge's comments across the 
front page, followed by a hard-hitting editorial and a six-column cartoon 
showing the judge with a large foot in his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
The editorial was titled, "Ugly Idea From Ugly American."

Realizing that they underestimated the extent of the Chernobyl accident, Soviet 
authorities will evacuate 14,000 more people this year from the site of the 
world's worst nuclear disaster, Pravda said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party daily indicated that more work is needed to limit the 
damage from the April 26, 1986, explosion and fire at the nuclear power reactor 
that killed 31 people according to official figures. 
</P>
<P>
Pravda said radioactive dust that has piled up in the 20-mile danger zone 
around the plant will take decades to remove and will have to be processed by a 
special, as yet unbuilt, complex. 
</P>
<P>
The continued evacuations are the result of belated recognition by authorities 
that the accident spread more radioactivity over a wider area than at first 
thought. (Story, A1)

TRIAL OKD IN SPERM DONOR'S PARENTING SUIT

An Oregon woman who does not want to share parenting rights with the California 
man who donated his sperm for her artificial insemination lost a Supreme Court 
appeal today. 
</P>
<P>
The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that Kevin McIntyre is entitled 
to a trial in seeking to prove he donated sperm only after Linden Crouch said 
she would let him help raise the child. 
</P>
<P>
Crouch said no such agreement was made. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, more than 20,000 children are born each year through artificial 
insemination, the court was told. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, women are inseminated with sperm obtained through a sperm bank 
from donors who remain anonymous to them. But McIntyre, of Moraga, Calif., has 
known Crouch of Ashland, Ore., for more than 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
Crouch gave birth to a daughter, Glenellen Susan, on Nov. 24, 1986, after being 
artificially impregnated with sperm she had asked McIntyre to donate. 
</P>
<P>
He said Crouch told him before he agreed to donate his sperm that she wanted 
him to share parenting with her. He said she also agreed to his request for 
visitation rights. 
</P>
<P>
In other action today, the high court: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Agreed to use the case of a Mississippi Death Row inmate to provide new 
guidelines for police questioning of suspects. 
</P>
<P>
The court said it will hear an appeal by Robert S. Minnick, a convicted 
murderer who said his confession was unlawful because he was denied his right 
to have a lawyer present. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Refused to reinstate the California murder conviction of a Black Panther 
Party member who was shackled during his 17-month trial. 
</P>
<P>
The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the shackling at Johnny 
Spain's trial violated his rights. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rejected an appeal by a Utah city accused of unlawfully promoting religion 
by subsidizing the Mormon Church and by putting a church symbol on city 
property. 
</P>
<P>
The court, over one dissenting vote, refused to kill a lawsuit that says the 
city violated the constitutionally required separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Refused to give new life to a copyright lawsuit over actress Shirley 
MacLaine's 1983 best-selling book, "Out on a Limb." 
</P>
<P>
The court, without comment, let stand rulings that MacLaine's book about 
reincarnation and other spiritual subjects did not infringe on the copyright of 
a 1977 book written by Charles Silva. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rejected an appeal by a former member of the Church of Scientology of 
California who wanted the church declared a phony religion. 
</P>
<P>
The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Larry Wollersheim of Aspen, 
Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Still pending before the justices is an appeal by the Church of Scientology of 
California aimed at overturning a $2.5-million "emotional distress" award won 
by Wollersheim. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rejected a chemical company's challenge to federal standards for clean 
water. 
</P>
<P>
The court, without comment, left intact rules that govern more than 1,000 
factories producing organic chemicals, plastics and synthetic fibers.

JUDGE ORDERS PSYCHIATRIC EXAM FOR HARRY HELMSLEY IN TAX CASE 
</P>

<P>
A judge today ordered aging hotel magnate Harry Helmsley to undergo a 
psychiatric test to see if he is competent to stand trial for tax evasion 
despite defense claims that the stress of an exam could kill him. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling by Justice John Bradley at state Supreme Court came after 
prosecutors revealed that Helmsley, 81, and his wife, Leona, 70, recently 
jetted off for a Florida vacation at one of their hotels. 
</P>
<P>
"On April 5, Harry Helmsley flies to Florida, to Sarasota, with his wife, to 
one of their hotels for a vacation. It was our information that he did not go 
by ambulance or on a stretcher," remarked state Assistant Atty. Gen. Alfredo 
Mendez. 
</P>
<P>
Mendez said defense lawyers had ignored an earlier order to undergo a mental 
exam by court-appointed psychiatrists and said he was too ill to leave his 
apartment at the Park Lane Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing before Bradley was to determine whether Helmsley, who last month 
fell headfirst down a flight of stairs and was knocked unconscious, was 
physically fit to undergo the mental competence exam. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing Monday, he ordered Helmsley to be examined May 9 and to 
return to court for a hearing on the findings May 23. 
</P>
<P>
The Helmsleys are accused of cheating the state out of $1 million in taxes. 
They also are accused of disguising millions of dollars in renovations at their 
Greenwich, Conn., mansion as business expenses of their hotel empire. 
</P>
<P>
Leona Helmsley was convicted of similar charges in federal court and has been 
sentenced to four years in prison. She is free pending her appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband was deemed incompetent to stand trial with her last summer in U.S. 
District Court. However, in the wake of that ruling, the New York Post reported 
that Helsmley was actively participating in his wife's defense. 
</P>
<P>
Mendez said that in recent months Helmsley has apparently been capable of 
seeking documents and making huge financial transactions. He noted that 
Helmsley submitted an affidavit in February demanding documents from the 
attorney general's office. He also noted that Forbes Magazine reported recently 
that Helmsley completed a $50-million transaction.

Time Warner Inc. said today that five of its six operating units posted 
record-high income in the first quarter but that the costs of buying Warner 
Communications Inc. created a loss. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it lost $51 million, or $3.25 per share, in the first quarter

period a year ago, assuming that the acquisition of Warner had been completed

Time Warner, the world's largest media company, holds $10.6 billion in debt 
from its acquisition of Warner in January and will have payments of $1.2 
billion to service its debt this year.

POWER-SHY MANILA ON 4-DAY WORK WEEK

Government offices and about 300 private companies went on a forced holiday 
today at the start of a four-day work week program to conserve energy in the 
capital, which has been hit by the worst power shortage in two decades. 
</P>
<P>
The four-day work week will be in effect for five weeks and was designed by 
businessmen who objected to having periodic blackouts throughout the week. 
</P>
<P>
By taking a holiday on Mondays, the offices were assured by the National Power 
Corp. of uninterrupted power supply for the rest of the week. 
</P>
<P>
Although only government offices and 309 private buildings are covered by the 
program, activities in most commercial establishments, including five-star 
hotels, ground to a halt as four-hour power shutdowns took effect in the midst 
of a prolonged dry spell. 
</P>
<P>
Filipinos left without air conditioners or electric fans grumbled about the 
sweltering heat, and President Corazon Aquino was criticized for failing to 
anticipate power shortages. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino mothballed the 620-megawatt Westinghouse nuclear plant on Bataan 
province across Manila Bay for safety reasons after she attained power in 1986. 
Officials said it would cost several billion dollars to meet safety 
requirements and start operations at the plant, which has never been used. 
</P>
<P>
Power officials said that they made recommendations on how to compensate for 
the closure of the $2.1-billion nuclear plant but that Aquino did not act on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Observers fear the power shortage -- the worst since an energy crisis in the 
1970s -- will affect the nation's economic performance this year and scare away 
foreign investors.

155 SEIZED IN 'GREEN' PROTEST ON WALL STREET

At least 155 demonstrators were arrested this morning outside the New York 
Stock Exchange as several hundred people assembled in a post-Earth Day protest 
against U.S. companies they branded as polluters. 
</P>
<P>
Banner-waving protesters chanted and danced up and down Exchange Place near the 
world's biggest stock market, but the gathering was calm and trading was not 
interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely normal," NYSE spokeswoman Sharon Gamsin said. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokeswoman said 500 officers had been assigned to the area, 
outnumbering the roughly 400 demonstrators, in an effort to keep protesters 
away from the NYSE building on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
The early morning protest in the heart of the nation's financial district was 
organized by a number of "green" political groups from New York to Quebec and 
followed the observance of Earth Day 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators called in a handbill for people to gather to "shut down Wall 
Street" in a nonviolent civil disobedience action. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Steve Davis, a New York Police Department spokesman, said most were 
arrested on charges of disorderly conduct, blocking traffic and throwing 
garbage. "Most who were arrested wanted to be," a police sergeant said. 
</P>
<P>
Police cordoned off Wall Street and Broad Street outside the exchange, allowing 
traders and other Wall Street officials to pass through and enter the exchange 
and other buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Men in pin-striped suits scurried up and down Wall Street, newspapers under 
their arms and briefcases in hand, largely ignoring occasional heckling by 
demonstrators, some of whom pleaded with the financiers to "take the day off". 
</P>
<P>
"Fine with me," retorted one man in his early 30s, without breaking stride 
toward his office doorway.

Eurotunnel said today it will raise up to $4.1 billion more from its banks and 
shareholders to finish its rail tunnel under the English Channel. 
</P>
<P>
The Anglo-French consortium said the cost of the 31-mile tunnel has risen to up 
to $12.4 billion because of soaring construction and borrowing costs. 
</P>
<P>
Only half the boring has been completed, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, it said the project would cost $11.4 billion, and three years ago 
the price tag was said to be $7.93 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it will sell up to $815 million worth of new shares to its 
existing shareholders after it completes talks with its bankers about expanding 
credit facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Eurotunnel said it expects to increase funds available to the project up to 
$13.8 billion from $11 billion.

<P>
The appearance of Marla Maples -- the former girlfriend of Donald Trump -- on 
"PrimeTime Live" Thursday night turned out to be something of a ratings 
success. 
</P>
<P>
The interview, by ABC'S Diane Sawyer, wound up with a 14.2 national Nielsen 
rating and a 25% audience share. 
</P>
<P>
That's the highest ever for the program -- the previous best was a 12.6 
rating-22% share on Oct. 19 following the San Francisco earthquake -- and it 
enabled "PrimeTime Live" to win the 10-to-11 time period for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Maples' appearance in the last half hour of the program jumped "PrimeTime's" 
ratings in New York, where she has been in tabloid heaven for weeks, to a 
23.4-37 from a 21.3-31 in the first 30 minutes.

MEHTA, ISRAEL PHILHARMONIC TO EMBARK ON SOVIET TOUR

<P>
Conductor Zubin Mehta this month breaks the sound barrier in Israeli-Soviet 
relations, proving that music is a language that knows no boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Mehta, music director of the Israel Philharmonic for 21 years, is taking the 
orchestra on its first tour of Moscow, Riga and Leningrad despite the absence 
of diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union over the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. 
</P>
<P>
"You know we can't change boundaries. Musicians can't talk about that. But we 
can make people smile at each other and today, God knows, that's important," 
said the 54-year-old conductor. 
</P>
<P>
It will be a remarkable return engagement. A fourth of the 110 musicians are 
former Soviet citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The tour, featuring violin soloist Itzhak Perlman, runs from Thursday to May 3. 
</P>
<P>
Mehta, a native of India and outgoing music director of the New York 
Philharmonic, began his association with the Israeli orchestra by accident 29 
years ago when, at 25, he stood in for an ailing conductor. 
</P>
<P>
He has now been music director of the Israel Philharmonic for 21 years and says 
the Soviet tour will fulfill the first of his three dreams for the orchestra. 
The other two -- trips to Egypt and India -- seem more remote because of 
diplomatic complications. 
</P>
<P>
Mehta said he pleaded in vain with former Prime Minister Menachem Begin to send 
the Philharmonic to Egypt as a goodwill gesture after the signing of the 1978 
Camp David peace accords. 
</P>
<P>
As for India, despite an Israeli interest section in Mehta's hometown of 
Bombay, relations are cold and prospects bleak. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic relations with Moscow, still only a hope because of differences over 
peace with the Palestinians, have inched closer under Soviet President Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Soviet Union have increased cultural, scientific and sports 
links since exchanging exploratory consular missions three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, an influx of Soviet Jews has bolstered many sectors of Israeli 
society, including the orchestra. Mehta said the Philharmonic is unable to 
absorb all the applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Married to an American, Mehta lives in Los Angeles, devoting four months each 
year to the Israel Philharmonic and five to the New York orchestra.

Goldie Hawn, the go-go dancer who turned a wide-eyed dumb blonde routine into a 
string of hit movies in the 1970s, is hoping to revitalize her career in the 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't become a movie star because I made people cry or because I had some 
incredible romantic persona," Hawn said in an interview in the May issue of 
Fame magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"I came on the scene with an effervescence and a lightness and an ability to 
elevate spirits, which, by the way, I do not sell short." 
</P>
<P>
After success with "Cactus Flower," "Shampoo," "Butterflies Are Free" and 
"Private Benjamin," she starred in a series of movies -- "Swing Shift," 
"Overboard" and others -- that she admits were disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
But Hawn, 44, has a slew of projects in the works, including a comedy with Mel 
Gibson, "Bird on a Wire," which opens next month, and a seven-film deal with 
Disney's Hollywood Pictures.

LIZ SMITH: WILL GARBO EX-PAL SAM GREEN PLEASE STAND UP? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIZ SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THIS COLUMN has been trying to find Garbo's former pal Sam Green. They were 
very close until the actress discovered that Sam had been taping their 
conversations. Sam, if you read this, give a call. 
</P>
<P>
R. G. Friedman of Brooklyn asks: "How did Garbo manage to live comfortably 
without doing any kind of work, no movies in nearly 50 years?" Good question. 
Well, Garbo was notoriously close with a dollar. There are no notable acts of 
charity or generosity in her life. She herself lived rather simply. She often 
visited and traveled as "the world's guest," notably aboard the yacht of her 
friend, the Baroness Cecile de Rothschild. (She is now very ill in Paris.) 
</P>
<P>
A typical Garbo incident occurred in Greece when the star was visiting a member 
of the Calliga shipping family. After a long stay, she left behind a rueful 
maid who had attended her. The maid liked to show off the old straw hat with 
its holes and frayed edges, saying, "Garbo gave me this; it was her tip!" 
</P>
<P>
Garbo invested early in the 1930s in valuable Los Angeles real estate, which 
has only gone up and up ever since. She has likely left a sizable fortune. 
</P>
<P>
THE MANNER in which ABC's "PrimeTime" offered up its background to the Marla 
Maples interview -- why, my, my -- out there in TV-land, I'm sure the public 
got the idea that the New York Post was the newspaper that scooped and covered 
the big story of the Ivana-Donald Trump split. Diane Sawyer's producers didn't 
even bother to show you the New York Daily News front page that busted this one 
wide open. 
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON has always been such a "company town" its business is "government" 
and "gossip." So public figures in D.C. always concentrate a lot on image. 
</P>
<P>
But the TV age has now arrived with such a vengeance that every congressman, 
senator and Cabinet member knows enough to want a good makeup before going on 
the air. Some now arrive at studios with makeup charts, outlining their 
best/worst features, numbers and brand names of foundation bases, etc. One of 
the most dedicated is West Virginia's Sen. Jay Rockefeller. 
</P>
<P>
ANYBODY AROUND here care that Eddie Murphy's enormous exclusive contract with 
Paramount has ended? Every studio has, of course, offered him a blank check to 
relocate. But Eddie says he needs to take some time off. He is spending it in a 
very Bill Cosby-ish way, with his new baby daughter at his house in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
NOW THAT David Geffen has bought the nine-acre Jack Warner estate in Beverly 
Hills for a record $47.5 million, let's note he also bought a screenplay by 
Shane "Lethal Weapon" Black for a record $1.75 million. "The Last Boy Scout" 
was a sizzling property, the center of an auction frenzy by the majors. 
</P>
<P>
Geffen, with his $500-million profits from the sale of his record company to 
MCA safely tucked away, is also ready to bring the Broadway musical 
"Dreamgirls" to the screen. 
</P>
<P>
There is continuing speculation that Spike Lee will direct.

Danica McKellar, Winnie Cooper on ABC's "Wonder Years," is a polite 15-year-old 
who gets A's in school. Perfect casting, right? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not Winnie," Danica said in the April 28 issue of TV Guide. 
</P>
<P>
"Winnie is perfect. She has no faults. And she does what the script says." 
</P>
<P>
Danica was cast as the potential love interest of series star Fred Savage just 
days before "The Wonder Years" started shooting. It came down to two 
candidates, Danica and her 13-year-old sister, Crystal. 
</P>
<P>
"It was practically a tossup," said casting head Mary Buck. "But finally they 
picked Danica." 
</P>
<P>
Crystal has appeared on the show as Winnie's rival, Becky. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't compete," Danica said. "We each give a performance and do the best we 
can, and it's up to the producers."

Marc Henry of Silsbee, Tex., proved himself to be the world's strongest 
teen-ager Sunday when he shattered a handful of records. 
</P>
<P>
Henry, who weighs 390 pounds and stands 6-foot-4, set teen-age world lifting 
records in the squats (832 pounds) and total (2,033). 
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old high school senior made the lifts as he breezed to the 
superheavyweight championship in the National High School Powerlifting 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
The former records of 761 in the squats and 1,973 total had been set in 1981 by 
George Hechter. 
</P>
<P>
The 2,033-pound total not only won the national title but was the eighth-best 
lift in the world, regardless of age group. 
</P>
<P>
Henry set national records in all four powerlifting categories -- squats, bench 
press (501 pounds), dead lift (700 pounds) and total poundage.

RULE CHANGE WOULD HAVE GIVEN WINS TO 5 PITCHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Baseball's decision not to adopt a temporary rule change allowing starting 
pitchers to pick up a victory after going just three innings instead of five in 
the first two weeks of the season cost several pitchers a victory. But there 
will be no asterisks attached to their statistics this year. 
</P>
<P>
The great debate started last month when the official rules-makers briefly 
considered a change. Oakland manager Tony La Russa was among those who liked 
the idea and its intent to protect pitchers who didn't work much during the 
lockout-abbreviated spring training. 
</P>
<P>
The decision not to change the rule cost Frank Tanana, Eric King, Walt Terrell, 
Jaime Navarro and Roy Smith one victory each. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't bother me," Tanana said. "I'm fine either way." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the rule had been adopted, it would have ended Sunday. It would not 
have made much of a difference, either. 
</P>
<P>
In a grand total of five games, a starting pitcher who went fewer than five 
innings would have gotten a victory. 
</P>
<P>
On the second day of the season, King pitched four innings and was relieved 
with the Chicago White Sox leading Milwaukee 1-0. Chicago wound up winning 5-3, 
and the victory went to King's successor, Scott Radinsky, who pitched 1 1/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
King, still without a decision, is to start Tuesday night at Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't really against the rule or for it," King said. "It seemed like that 
would be a pretty easy win." 
</P>
<P>
Tanana thought he was headed toward a victory when Detroit took an early 8-2 
lead against Boston on April 12. He left after 4 2/3 innings after giving up 
three more runs, and reliever Urbano Lugo got credit for the win as the Tigers 
held on 11-7. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't do the job, and that's the way it goes," Tanana said. "I was capable 
of going five, and I didn't do it. I didn't get the one key out." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Navarro, Smith nor Terrell has a victory yet. If any of them wind up 
with 19 wins, they can blame the three-inning rule for costing them No. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, Milwaukee gave Navarro a 9-2 lead. But he left after allowing 
nine hits in four innings, and Tony Fossas got the victory as the Brewers beat 
Texas 11-6. 
</P>
<P>
The same day, Smith lasted 4 2/3 innings and was relieved with Minnesota ahead 
of Seattle. The Twins held on, and Terry Leach got the win. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Terrell pitched 4 1/3 innings and left with Pittsburgh leading 
Chicago. The Pirates won 9-4, and the victory went to Scott Roesler, who 
pitched only one inning.

FRATELLO ENDS POOR SEASON BY RESIGNING;

BASKETBALL: COACH WAS UNDER FIRE BECAUSE ATLANTA HAWKS FAILED TO MAKE THE NBA 
PLAYOFFS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Fratello, under fire because his team failed to make the NBA playoffs, 
resigned today as coach of the Atlanta Hawks after seven seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"For the best interests of the Atlanta Hawks and in my best interests, it's 
probably best for both of us if we part ways at this time," Fratello said at a 
news conference with Hawks' officials. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks, plagued by injuries and internal bickering this season, finished 
41-41 despite winning six of their last seven games. They failed to make the 
playoffs for only the second time in Fratello's seven seasons and for the first 
time in five years. 
</P>
<P>
"Today is not a sad day," Fratello, with a career record of 324-250, said. 
"This is a day of moving on for the two sides." 
</P>
<P>
The news conference followed the team's end-of-the-season meeting at the Omni. 
There had been speculation that Fratello would be fired, but Hawks President 
Stan Kasten said the departure was Fratello's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike came to the realization that this would be good for him," Kasten said. "I 
support that decision; I agree with him." 
</P>
<P>
Kasten said no decision has been made about a new coach. Fratello's contract 
expired when the Hawks ended their season Saturday night with a 130-109 victory 
over Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"No question this is my most disappointing season," Kasten said after the Miami 
game. "That this team is not going to be in the playoffs is unbelievable. I'm 
really having a difficult time with that. 
</P>
<P>
"To think that Cleveland and Milwaukee are in the playoffs with a much worse 
injury situation than we had, and we're finished tonight. It's very distressing 
to me." 
</P>
<P>
Dominique Wilkins said a slow start was Atlanta's downfall. 
</P>
<P>
"No doubt in my mind if we played all season the way we played the last two 
weeks, we'd be in the playoffs. If we'd play two more games at any point in the 
season, we'd be in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
In the last two weeks, he said, "we played to our potential. We played hard, 
and we played together. We passed the ball and played defense like we all knew 
we could, like everybody thought we could." 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins finished with a 26.7-point average, half a point better than the 
previous year but his second-lowest in six years.

MELVIN DURSLAG: HERE'S HALL OF FAME VOTE FOR PETE ROSE -- DESPITE HIS BETTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN DURSLAG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How the judge decides the Pete Rose issue is one thing. And how those who vote 
for baseball's Hall of Fame decide it is another. 
</P>
<P>
As one granted a Hall of Fame vote, we are going to cast it in favor of Pete, 
but it will be accompanied by no lobbying, no missionary work, no tender pleas 
for clemency. 
</P>
<P>
Nor are we going to listen to sermonizing from any Holy Joes who vote, 
impressing us with the morality of their judgments against Pete. 
</P>
<P>
What you have here, in other words, is a case that can be voted either way, 
depending upon your outlook, with no one having to add apologetic footnotes. 
</P>
<P>
It states, in the Hall of Fame election rules, that "voting shall be based upon 
the player's record, playing ability, integrity, sportsmanship, character, 
contribution to his team, or teams." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, Pete Rose qualifies for his playing record, his ability, his 
contribution to his teams and for his sportsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
Over 24 years, Pete hit safely 4,256 times. He performed faithfully and hard. 
As an offering to his teams, he performed at four positions -- first, second, 
third and outfield -- even though the switches posed a problem for him. 
</P>
<P>
And, on the field, Pete was a sportsman. His play rarely created an enemy. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who doesn't agree to the foregoing should be making buttonholes, not 
voting for the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
The debatable issues are those involving "integrity" and "character." 
</P>
<P>
Did the gambling by Rose, and his subsequent run-in with the government over 
taxes, offset his 24 years of dedication on the field? 
</P>
<P>
Should Hall of Fame voters be guided by the ruling of the judge? If the judge 
puts Pete in jail, should the Hall of Fame vote automatically go against him? 
</P>
<P>
If the judge decides on a fine and probation, does this call for leniency by 
Hall of Fame voters? 
</P>
<P>
Is the judge's decision irrelevant as far as Hall of Fame is concerned? 
</P>
<P>
Judges, you must remember, do not rule uniformly. One will give a murderer 
three years. Another will give a preacher who robs parishioners 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose is claiming, in effect, temporary insanity, ascribing his tax 
cheating to a gambling habit he couldn't control. 
</P>
<P>
You can arch an eyebrow at such a claim or, if you are familiar with gamblers, 
you can testify they are, indeed, crazy, foaming-at-the-mouth mad. In their 
frame of mind, they lie, forge, steal and do countless other things of an 
antisocial nature. Upstairs, they are out of it. 
</P>
<P>
The Hall of Fame voter, like the judge, must decide whether he buys Pete's 
story. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, Joe Louis didn't cheat on his income tax. All Joe did was spend 
money that belonged to the government. 
</P>
<P>
Joe gambled heavily at golf. He lived high. He was bereft of fiscal 
responsibility, explaining to IRS he didn't mean to blow his tax money, but it 
just vanished. 
</P>
<P>
Joe was a sweet guy. It was impossible to dislike him. He owed the government 
so much that it would have been impossible, in his lifetime, to make good the 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
IRS washed it, and Joe would be accepted by the populace as a hero and a 
respected citizen, and a stadium would be named for him in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
And, in boxing's Hall of Fame, Joe Louis stands in the forefront. 
</P>
<P>
Cassius Clay ducked the draft. At a time kids were going to Vietnam, he got a 
field commission as a Muslim minister, claiming exemption on the grounds of 
religion. He changed his name to Muhammad Ali. 
</P>
<P>
Patriotic people in the country hated him. He walked the ledge of jail, barred 
from boxing. 
</P>
<P>
But he, too, would emerge as a hero of sorts, one for whom streets, clubs and 
playgrounds are named. He strolls the world today as a figure immensely liked, 
a prominent member of boxing's Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
We recall a headline one day in the Wall Street Journal. It read: 
</P>
<P>
"George Steinbrenner, Hit by Nixon Scandal, Barely Misses a Stride." 
</P>
<P>
It would then be explained that George's conviction for a felony didn't, in any 
way, water down his social and business functions . . . that he had returned to 
the scene like a circus horse that smells the sawdust. 
</P>
<P>
And George's rap? He had given bonuses to employees, with instructions that 
they donate them to the Richard Nixon campaign fund. 
</P>
<P>
Informed that this was highly illegal, George registered shock. He said he 
couldn't picture such a law. Fined $15,000, he was told to try escaping the 
slammer. 
</P>
<P>
But society would quickly accept him. Around the republic, he has been 
decorated countless times and he even has been named an officer of the U.S. 
Olympic Committee, one of our holiest bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Others voting on the baseball Hall of Fame needn't be influenced even remotely 
by our attitude on Pete Rose, but we see him as one who went out of his head on 
gambling, as guys have on booze and on drugs, and we don't care, in this case, 
to finger-wag. 
</P>
<P>
He isn't presented here as an American god -- just as one who served his 
profession as few others have. He never committed the ultimate sin -- betting 
against his own team -- and, irrespective of how he is judged in court, he is 
going to get at least one Hall of Fame vote. 
</P>
<P>
Do you know why? When he says he was nuts, we believe it.

BETTING THE SYSTEMS; 
</P>
<P>
'MUSIC MAN' PLAYS ON A CONSENSUS INSTRUMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The "Music Man" marches to his own tune. Late at night he plays in a jazz band 
in a restaurant in Hollywood and in the morning he is a custodian for an office 
building in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Since he doesn't require a lot of sleep, he goes to the track during the 
afternoon and mingles with his cronies, who discuss the horses and music while 
waiting between races. 
</P>
<P>
If his friends should ask, the Music Man will tell them that he has been 
playing the horses for the past 30 years and has experimented with every system 
imaginable. 
</P>
<P>
Also, he has followed the touts who sell their selections outside the tracks 
and has followed the various professional handicappers who select horses for 
the local newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he has discovered that neither the touts nor the newspaper 
handicappers really are winners. Some get hot at various times during a season, 
but overall they're not much better at picking winners than, say, people who 
bet on favorites that win about 33% of the races. 
</P>
<P>
But the Music Man never gives up. He is always seeking that one system that 
will make him rich and give him the life of luxury he has always sought. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, after discarding 30 years worth of systems -- some valid, some 
interesting, some legitimate, some laughable and some sheer lunacy -- he has 
devised a method of playing the horses that has at least resulted in his 
winning more money than he has lost. 
</P>
<P>
What the Music Man does is bet the top Consensus horse in the Los Angeles Times 
Sports section or in the Racing Form. In addition to betting the Consensus nag, 
he uses a money management system. To end up with a profit during the day's 
nine-horse card, the Music Man maintains that he needs only one winner. 
</P>
<P>
Once he achieves that winner, he leaves the track and goes home. If he feels 
extremely lucky and the winner comes early in the day, he might stick around 
and start his betting system over again. Most of the time, however, he'll take 
his winnings and run. 
</P>
<P>
On March 8, 1990, at Santa Anita, the Consensus in The Times came up with one 
winner. In the fifth race, a seven-furlong sprint for 4-year-olds and up, the 
lineup with odds to

The idea was to kidnap John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in Texas filming 'The Alamo.' One day at lunch I made the suggestion 
to a bunch of the Mexican extras working in the picture as Santa Anna's troops. 
I didn't tell them I was kidding. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Look. Texas belonged to Mexico. It was literally stolen from us. What 
I'm going to propose to you is dangerous, so if you want to forget it, OK. . . 
.' 
</P>
<P>
" 'I can get live ammunition. . . .' At this point, everyone became very tense. 
I told them: 'We get this tall guy -- what's his name? Win? Wino? We kidnap him 
and contact Washington. We'll give him back if the United States will give us 
Texas back.' 
</P>
<P>
"One colonel said he had a family to think of. Another said the U.S. Army was 
only two hours away and, 'They'll wipe us out.' I said, 'Yes. But we'll die as 
heroes.' The next day I had lunch alone." 
</P>
<P>
The speaker was Ruben Dario Padilla Colon y Magallanes, a longtime San Diegan 
reminiscing about a kaleidoscopic and sometimes fascinating life on both sides 
of the U.S.-Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
An interview related to Padilla's 80th birthday evoked memories of those deeds 
that have entertained him, from his career in the film industry to wearing 
pistol and badge as police chief of Texcoco, to working in tourism and politics 
and publicity in San Diego and Baja California Norte, and more. 
</P>
<P>
In his milieu, it seems that everyone knows Padilla and he knows everyone. He 
is one of those binationals common along the border, but nothing is common 
about him. Padilla is a gregarious, knowledgeable, humorous character, quick 
with a joke, a fact or a connection, a man known to be able to get the job done 
or send you to someone who can. He can even get you out of jail with a phone 
call, two at the most (Tijuana or Mexicali only). 
</P>
<P>
In "The Alamo," Padilla portrays Gen. Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, leading his 
soldiers at San Antonio against defenders holed up in the old mission called 
The Alamo. It was filmed in 1959 near Brackettville, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have many lines," Padilla said, "but Santa Anna is referred to all 
the way through, so he's a major character." 
</P>
<P>
And of course he had to ride a white horse, as was Santa Anna's custom. Former 
Texas Gov. Price Daniels provided his horse, White Cloud. Padilla had never 
ridden. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment Santa Anna was to appear at the head of his troops, Michael 
Wayne, the actor's son, told Padilla, who was wearing an authentic 1836 Mexican 
army uniform: "You'd better mount." 
</P>
<P>
"Mount what?" Padilla asked. "I've never ridden before." 
</P>
<P>
"You'd better tell Dad." 
</P>
<P>
Padilla said, "You tell him." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Padilla learned to manage on horseback, although once during a 
charge he fell. 
</P>
<P>
"All I heard was, 'Cut, cut, cut,' " Padilla said. "And I never heard so much 
cussing (from John Wayne) in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Much of Padilla's life has revolved around filmmaking and bullfighting. Friends 
in one field often led him to the other in a glamorous and pleasant ricochet. 
The pattern for this life may have been cut by Padilla's father, Dario, a 
Mexican importer-exporter who was a friend of the first great Mexican 
bullfighter, Rodolfo Gaona. 
</P>
<P>
However, for Ruben Padilla, born in Guadalajara on Feb. 16, 1910, the first 
personal step was his fast friendship with another star matador, Silverio 
Perez, whom he met in the early 1940s at Mexicali, where Silverio -- 
immortalized in song and politics as well as in the taurine world -- was 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Padilla lived across the border in Calexico, where the family had moved in 1923 
after spending four years in San Francisco to avoid the terrors and confusions 
of the Mexican Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Later, at Hotel Caesar in Tijuana after a bullfight in the early 1940s, Padilla 
introduced Perez and other matadors to producer-director Budd Boetticher. 
</P>
<P>
"Budd had a script, "Torero," which became "The Bullfighter and the Lady," 
Padilla said. 'Wayne had just finished 'Sands of Iwo Jima' and had quite a bit 
of money. Budd contacted him about financing the movie, and Wayne was 
interested. He called me at Calexico (to arrange for bullfighters). He was very 
concerned about how much the matadors would have to be paid. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Yes, Mr. Wayne?' " And in that slow resonant voice, Wayne told 
Padilla: "My friends call me Duke." And that started a friendship that ended 
only with Wayne's death in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Padilla arranged for the matadors. And so Wayne financed "The Bullfighter and 
the Lady" with a $450,000 budget ("A lot of money then," Padilla said). Padilla 
portrayed the impresario in a cast that included Robert Stack, Gilbert Roland, 
Katy Jurado and Virginia Grey. It was filmed in Mexico City. Naturally, there 
was an occasional party. 
</P>
<P>
"Stack liked the sauce made from maguey worms until we told him what it was." 
</P>
<P>
Padilla portrayed Pedro in Boetticher's film "Wings of the Hawk," starring Van 
Heflin; was adviser for the bullfight sequence in "Mexican Hayride" with Abbott 
and Costello; was assistant to the producer in "The War Wagon," filmed in 
Mexico with Kirk Douglas; was in Boetticher's documentary "Arruza," narrated by 
Anthony Quinn, whom Padilla met at Hotel Caesar, naturally, "in the early 
1940s," and enjoyed his most important role as the detective in the 
Mexican-Italian movie "Bus Ride." 
</P>
<P>
Padilla enjoyed a brief taurine career as bullring judge at Mexicali and 
Tijuana, twice having matadors arrested for allowing picadors to abuse bulls. 
And, in the 1950s, at San Diego's Balboa Stadium, he staged what was probably 
the first bloodless bullfight in California. 
</P>
<P>
For a six-year term starting in 1953, when Baja California Norte became a 
state, Padilla was the first state tourism director. In that capacity, he often 
arranged front-row bullfight seats for Quinn, Orson Welles and other Hollywood 
personalities. Simultaneously, Padilla was secretary general of the 
"middle-class" sector for Mexico's ruling political party. 
</P>
<P>
Now he lives in Mission Hills, directs U.S. publicity for the Tijuana 
bullfights and keeps in touch with his family, including brother Oscar, well 
known in local politics and in the insurance business; son Ruben Jr., also an 
insurance executive; son Marco Antonio, a U.S. Customs inspector; and two 
granddaughters and three grandsons, including Ruben, a magician. 
</P>
<P>
Padilla, who retained his Mexican citizenship, critically observes activities 
major and minor on both sides of the border. For instance, on the future of 
Tijuana: 
</P>
<P>
"There is really a new Tijuana now. Tourists should feel no qualms about 
visiting. . . . The main problem is lack of water." 
</P>
<P>
And he denigrates use of the words "Hispanic" and "Chicano" to describe 
Mexicans or Mexican-Americans -- Hispanic because it belongs rightly to 
Spaniards only, he says, the other because it is recently coined and of 
uncertain origin. He is a Mexican, he will tell you, descended from Spaniards 
and Indians.

FRANK LAUSCHE; OHIO GOVERNOR, SENATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frank J. Lausche, the son of Slovakian immigrants who emerged from the ethnic 
neighborhoods of Cleveland to become a dominant and durable figure on the 
political scene for 40 years, died Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The conservative Democrat who served as a judge and mayor in his native city 
before becoming a five-term Ohio governor and two-term U.S. senator was 94. 
</P>
<P>
He died at the Slovene Home for the Aged in Cleveland where he had been 
admitted two months ago, said his sister-in-law, Antonia Lausche. 
</P>
<P>
One of 10 children of a steel worker father who died when he was only 13, young 
Lausche earned his first pennies lighting gas street lamps and acting as a 
court interpreter for his fellow Slovenians who came from a land now part of 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
He studied for a career in law, received a degree in 1920 from John Marshall 
School of Law -- where he ranked second in his class -- and quickly became 
known as one of Cleveland's better trial lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Lausche's courtroom popularity encouraged him to make his first political race, 
an unsuccessful bid for the Ohio House in 1922 and then a second losing 
campaign for the Ohio Senate two years later. 
</P>
<P>
In 1932 he was appointed judge of the Cleveland Municipal Court and in 1941 
became mayor of that city, a position he held until his election in 1944 to the 
first of five terms as governor. 
</P>
<P>
He was the only governor in Ohio's history to be elected that many times. 
</P>
<P>
As mayor he was credited with establishing Cleveland's city-owned transit 
system and setting up committees that dealt with labor, health, transportation 
and Cleveland's growing racial problems. 
</P>
<P>
Although a Democrat, Lausche earned a reputation as an independent who often 
ignored party positions and consistently proved popular among independents and 
Republican voters. 
</P>
<P>
He was called a "sturdy independent" who favored right-to-work legislation and 
sponsored a $336-million turnpike across Ohio while creating a resources 
department that directed the planting of 27 million trees. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a new Ohio law that prevented any governor from serving more than 
two successive terms, Lausche turned to the U.S. Senate where he was elected in 
1956 and reelected in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
He served on the Senate Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee, the Foreign 
Relations Committee and as chairman of the Far Eastern Affairs subcommittee of 
the Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Lausche's lengthy political career ended in 1968 with his defeat -- due mostly 
to a long-running feud with organized labor -- in the Democratic primary for 
reelection to a third term in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a beautiful, wonderful life. We're sorry he didn't live long enough to 
see Slovenia become an independent country," said his sister-in-law. "They're 
part of Yugoslavia right now, but they're fighting for independence." 
</P>
<P>
Lausche is survived by a sister, Josephine Lausche Welf, 95, who also lives at 
the Slovene Home, and three sisters-in-law. His wife, Jane, died in 1981.

<P>
Former Parliament leader Horst Sindermann, a powerful East German Communist 
official ousted in last year's pro-democracy revolt, has died, the ADN news 
agency said Saturday. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
Sindermann died Friday after suffering a heart attack, the East German news 
service quoted family members as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Sindermann was a member of the ruling party Politburo and president of the 
Communist-dominated Parliament until November, after mass demonstrations 
toppled the Stalinist leaders who had ruled the country for four decades. 
</P>
<P>
He was the first of the aging hard-line Communists to die since last year's 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Sindermann rose through the Communist Party ranks after spending a decade in 
prison for party activities under the old Nazi regime. 
</P>
<P>
The son of a Dresden book printer, he joined a Communist youth group and was 
jailed for eight months in 1933. He was convicted of high treason in 1935 and 
spent the next decade in Nazi prison camps until the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
After the Germanys were divided by the Allies, Sindermann became editor of 
various Communist Party newspapers and held regional party posts before being 
named to the Politburo in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
He became president of Parliament and a member of the former council of state 
in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Massive demonstrations in October toppled former party leader Erich Honecker. 
Communist leaders who replaced him purged many members of the old guard, and 
Sindermann was stripped of power and party membership in November. 
</P>
<P>
A judicial inquiry into whether he should be charged with crimes against the 
nation began in January but it was dropped in February because of Sindermann's 
failing health. 
</P>
<P>
A Communist caretaker government allowed free elections on March 18 and a 
democratic government was elected.

AT HOME WITH 'PAPA G' -- BASKETBALL STARS, ESTRANGED SONS

Sam Gilbert seemed to derive his greatest pleasure in life from his association 
with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Walton, Jamaal Wilkes, Sidney Wicks, Marques 
Johnson and other UCLA basketball stars. 
</P>
<P>
The gates to his luxurious Pacific Palisades estate were always open to UCLA 
athletes, who would gather on weekends for a "Jewish soul food buffet" and a 
dip in the 50-foot swimming pool. At their home away from home, the players 
would get counseling from the godfather they called "Papa G" and tutoring from 
"Mama G," high school English teacher Rose Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
Former UCLA star Lucius Allen, in a 1982 interview, recalled Gilbert's 
influence on him. 
</P>
<P>
"There were two people I listened to," Allen said. "Coach (John) Wooden as long 
as we were between the lines. Outside the court -- Sam Gilbert." 
</P>
<P>
While Gilbert loved his UCLA basketball players like family, relations with his 
two sons were not so affectionate. 
</P>
<P>
One son, Robert, rebelled against his father and the other, Michael, was so 
fearful of him that as an adult he would hide in the stairwell of their office 
building, said Hubert R. Sommers, Sam Gilbert's friend and attorney for 20 
years. He said the Gilbert family was not close because Sam, the self-made 
millionaire, spent most of his time at the office concentrating on business. 
</P>
<P>
"Sam just browbeat Michael," said Michael Pasano, the Florida attorney who 
represents Michael Gilbert. "Theirs wasn't a normal father-son relationship. It 
was more like master-slave. Sam seemed to dote more on his basketball players 
than any of his two sons." 
</P>
<P>
It was only toward the end of Gilbert's life that he and Michael grew close 
while Robert "tolerated" his father, Sommers said. Michael is president of Sam 
Gilbert &amp; Associates and Robert served as director of operations at the 
Bicycle Club casino in Bell Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert died in 1987 at age 74. 
</P>
<P>
Born to Lithuanian immigrants, Gilbert was a multitalented man who claimed to 
speak French, Russian and German fluently and served in the OSS during World 
War II. In one interview, he admitted to being a "mediocre" middleweight boxer 
as a youth. 
</P>
<P>
He worked in a film lab and developed inventions, including metal studs and a 
door lock that made him wealthy. The door-lock business introduced him to the 
construction industry, and he began building homes and then multistory 
commercial offices in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Gilbert's greatest skill was his ability to make a deal, whether it was 
negotiating Abdul-Jabbar's first professional contract or completing the 
financial details to build the world's largest card casino in Bell Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
He had a violent temper and frequently told adversaries "not to cross me." He 
threatened more than one sportswriter with bodily harm. 
</P>
<P>
"If he liked you, he would do anything for you," Sommers said. "If you didn't 
have dreams, he would create them and then make them come true. If he didn't 
like you, he would drown you right into the gutter. It had to be Sam's way. I 
think that is what made him successful." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert attended UCLA before dropping out for economic reasons. His wife, Rose, 
was a Phi Beta Kappa at the university and his daughter, Margaret, attended law 
school there. 
</P>
<P>
His extraordinary support of UCLA athletes was praised in the mid-1970s by 
school officials. Wooden once called Gilbert a "good Samaritan" and athletic 
director J. D. Morgan referred to him as "a humanitarian." 
</P>
<P>
But some UCLA basketball coaches privately resented Gilbert's involvement with 
the players. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no fear of Sam, but I didn't like the dealings with him," former coach 
Gene Bartow said in a recent interview. "I didn't agree with what he was doing 
with players in the program." 
</P>
<P>
Neither did the NCAA. When the UCLA basketball program was put on probation for 
two years in 1981, the NCAA ordered the university to disassociate Gilbert from 
recruiting practices. Gilbert, who openly defied the NCAA at times, denied any 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
At his funeral, Sommers noted that Gilbert always attracted controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"There were many of us who loved Sam, some who scorned him and some who hated 
him," Sommers said. "But no one could ignore him." 
</P>

<P>
Robert Polhill knew that his mother was worried about his living in the 
war-torn Middle East, and in his letters, he tried to reassure her. 
</P>
<P>
Polhill made the campus of Beirut University College sound like a fortress. 
</P>
<P>
"He was telling me how very safe they were -- two gates, with security guards, 
and all that," Ruth Polhill recalled in an interview over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, mothers know very little," added the retired school librarian. Indeed, 
to other associates, Polhill had complained that security was not as good as it 
could have been. 
</P>
<P>
She said her son had only two weeks left on his teaching contract at Beirut 
University College, where he taught business and accounting, when terrorists 
wearing the uniforms of Lebanon's security police abducted him and three other 
faculty members from the campus. 
</P>
<P>
Although his favorite song was "My Way," Polhill, 55, had never seemed the 
adventurous type to those who knew him. 
</P>
<P>
He was born and grew up in one place -- Beacon, N.Y., a small town near 
Fishkill, where his mother now lives. His father, Milton, the manager of a 
local car dealership, died when Polhill was a senior in high school. 
</P>
<P>
Polhill originally had launched a career in hotel management, but two years of 
studies in the subject at Cornell University persuaded him that he wanted to do 
something else. 
</P>
<P>
He switched to accounting -- "devoured it," his mother said -- and finished his 
studies at New York University, commuting more than 50 miles between Beacon and 
New York City. 
</P>
<P>
After college, Polhill took a job with a major New York accounting firm. He 
married and had two sons, Brian and Stephen, who are now in their 20s and share 
an apartment in the New York City borough of Queens. 
</P>
<P>
Polhill, whose first marriage ended in divorce, later made several trips to 
Cyprus, where he trained new employees for the firm. It was there that he met 
his second wife, Firyal, who had been the head of an accounting firm in Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
The couple lived for a while in New York City and often journeyed on weekends 
back to Polhill's hometown in the Hudson River Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, he accepted a teaching stint in Beirut. Firyal's family was there, and 
Polhill was excited about the chance to teach in a region that badly needs 
technical skills, his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
What worried the family most while Polhill was in captivity was his ability to 
manage his diabetic condition. His wife ran ads in Middle Eastern newspapers 
specifying the dosage of insulin he needs and how it should be administered. 
</P>
<P>
The family was somewhat reassured when one of the four abducted faculty 
members, Mithileshwar Singh, was released in 1988. He told the family that 
Polhill was receiving seven syringes a week.
