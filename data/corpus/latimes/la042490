FILMS' PAULETTE GODDARD; WAS SAUCY STAR OF 1930S AND '40S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Paulette Goddard, the gamin star of more than 40 films of the 1930s and '40s, 
died Monday at her home in southern Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
Probably best known for her appearances opposite Charlie Chaplin in "Modern 
Times" and "The Great Dictator," she was believed to be 84 but reports of her 
age varied by as much as 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Any woman who would tell her age would tell anything," she said as long ago as 
1936. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of death has not yet been determined, said Pia DellaMora, a municipal 
employee in Ronco, Switzerland, where the actress had her villa. A household 
member told the Associated Press that Miss Goddard had been ill briefly but 
offered no specifics. 
</P>
<P>
Her husbands included a wealthy lumber industrialist, and actors Chaplin 
(although their secretive, puzzling 1936 marriage in China was revealed only at 
their 1942 divorce hearing in Mexico) and Burgess Meredith. Her last marriage 
was to novelist Erich Maria Remarque who died in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
She had lived almost exclusively in Europe in luxurious retirement since her 
1958 marriage to Remarque, author of "All Quiet on the Western Front," 
returning only occasionally to the United States for a small TV role in the 
1970s and to promote her husband's last novel, "Shadows in Paradise," published 
after his death. 
</P>
<P>
Born Marion Levee in Whitestone, N.Y., she began her career in a Florenz 
Ziegfeld revue because her uncle prevailed on his friend Ziegfeld to try her in 
a small role in "Rio Rita." 
</P>
<P>
She married industrialist Edgar James while supposedly still in her teens but 
went to Reno in 1931 to divorce him, and continued West to Hollywood where she 
was cast as a Goldwyn Girl in "The Kid From Spain." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most film stars of the day, Miss Goddard was tanned and athletic -- 
addicted to tennis and long walks. She was viewed by her fans as saucy and 
mischievous but by Hollywood executives as a hard-boiled business woman who 
carefully invested her film earnings. 
</P>
<P>
In 1940, her father sued her, complaining the $300 a month support she gave him 
was inadequate. In his suit, he claimed she had $5,000 a week to spend on 
"whims." 
</P>
<P>
Miss Goddard responded that it was because he had failed to keep up the $10 
weekly alimony awarded her mother after her parents' divorce that she was 
forced to go to work at such an early age. 
</P>
<P>
She developed a penchant for expensive gems (most of them gifts from the men in 
her life) which she supposedly kept in an old cigar box. In 1947, she insured 
her diamonds, emeralds and rubies for $500,000, an extraordinary figure for 
that time. 
</P>
<P>
(Some of her jewels, including a necklace with 50 diamonds, are being sold this 
week by Sotheby's, said a spokeswoman for the New York City auction house. In 
1979, she sold for $3.1 million her collection of 30 Cezanne, Renoir and Monet 
paintings.) 
</P>
<P>
Over the years Miss Goddard appeared in such movies as Cecil B. De Mille's 
"Northwest Mounted Police," in which she played a tempestuous half-breed siren, 
and in his "Unconquered," in which she bathed in a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
She also starred in "The Women," "Hold Back the Dawn," "Reap the Wild Wind," 
"Star Spangled Rhythm," "So Proudly We Hail," "Kitty," "Duffy's Tavern," "Diary 
of a Chambermaid" and "Suddenly It's Spring." 
</P>
<P>
She was reported to be a leading candidate for the role of Scarlett O'Hara in 
"Gone With the Wind" but the part eventually went to Vivien Leigh. 
</P>
<P>
Her last screen role was as Claudia Cardinale's mother in the 1964 Italian film 
"Time of Indifference."

RICHARD DELAUER; OUTSPOKEN EX-DEFENSE AIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard DeLauer, the courageously candid former undersecretary of defense who 
disagreed with his President and his immediate boss over weapons and contracts, 
died Sunday of leukemia in Los Angeles. He was 71 and more recently was board 
chairman and chief executive officer of Fairchild Space &amp; Defense Corp. 
</P>
<P>
From 1981 through 1984, when he left government service to spend more time with 
his family, the 1940 Stanford graduate was the defense undersecretary for 
research and engineering during Ronald Reagan's first term. 
</P>
<P>
At the Pentagon he was known as a government official who answered his own 
phone, spoke his own mind and disagreed with Defense Secretary Caspar W. 
Weinberger's attempt to freeze spending on the controversial Sgt. York 
antiaircraft gun and with Reagan himself on weapons procurement policies. 
</P>
<P>
But he agreed with Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, the so-called Star 
Wars program. He became chief architect of a controversial plan to speed up 
Star Wars weapons development by eliminating many of the time-consuming tests 
traditionally performed at each step of production. 
</P>
<P>
DeLauer, who received his doctorate degree from Caltech in 1953, was an 
aeronautical engineering officer in the Navy from 1943 to 1958 and worked in 
nuclear rocket propulsion development. He became an executive vice president 
and a director of TRW Inc. after his service years. 
</P>
<P>
Before joining Fairchild, a Maryland-based corporation, in 1989, DeLauer had 
his own defense consulting firm, the Orion Group. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Ann, a son, two brothers and two grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
The family suggests donations to a Richard DeLauer Memorial Fund at Stanford 
University.

SACRAMENTO FILE: TORRES PROPOSES STATE-RUN AIRLINE TO FIGHT HIGH FARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jerry Gillam, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unhappy with intrastate air fares? Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) has 
introduced a bill that would create a state-run airline to provide low-cost 
competition for the private air carriers. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said his bill (SB 2900) is a response to consumer complaints about high 
airline fares between such cities as Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco and 
Sacramento. He called it an outrage that, for example, air travelers between 
Los Angeles and Sacramento -- of whom Torres is one -- have to pay up to $576 
for a round-trip ticket. 
</P>
<P>
"This fare-gouging inhibits the natural flow of commerce and tourist travel and 
presents barriers to citizen participation in government," the Senator said. 
</P>
<P>
His measure would establish a nonprofit state corporation financed by revenues 
from transporting passengers, baggage and freight between major California 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
The legislative analyst's office has been asked to prepare a detailed report on 
a proposed state-run airline by July 1.

Floor Action 
</P>
<P>
Telephones: Passed 50-14 and sent to the Senate a bill (AB 2889) by 
Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles) that would prevent telephone companies 
from raising the cost of calls within communities where phone service areas are 
divided by the addition of new area codes. "A local call before the area code 
split will remain a local call after the area code split," Moore said. She said 
the measure was prompted by the creation of a new area code -- 310 -- in the 
Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Sales Tax: Passed 44-27 and sent to the Senate a bill (AB 3670) by Assemblyman 
Sam Farr (D-Carmel) to permit counties to impose a 1/2-cent sales tax increase 
with voter approval of only a simple majority rather than a two-thirds 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
More Taxes: Passed and sent to the Senate on a 61-2 vote a constitutional 
amendment (ACA 3) by Assemblyman Dave Elder (D-Long Beach) to allow the 
Legislature to increase the homeowners' property tax exemption from $7,000 
upwards on a sliding scale basis for home buyers who change homes, depending on 
when the home was purchased. 
</P>
<P>
Women: Passed and sent to the Senate on a 45-26 vote a bill (AB 2678) by 
Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) declaring it to be official state 
policy that the percentage of women on appointed boards and commissions 
accurately reflects the percentage of women in the state's population. 
</P>
<P>
Parks: Passed and returned to the Senate for concurrence in Assembly amendments 
on a 64-0 vote a bill (SB 752) by Sen. Dan McCorquodale (D-San Jose) asking for 
a state study on allowing people over 62 years old to obtain park use passes at 
a reduced cost. 
</P>
<P>
Police: Passed and sent to the Senate on a 53-0 vote a bill (AB 2692) by

shows an official badge.

ONLY IN L.A. PEOPLE AND EVENTS

Since World War II, kooky TV car dealers from Madman Muntz and Ralph ("Hi 
Friends") Williams to Cal Worthington have become show biz celebrities of a 
sort. But they were amateur actors, at least in the eyes of the Screen Actors 
Guild. 
</P>
<P>
Now, a local dealership is looking for professionals. Drama-Logue, a weekly 
casting publication, recently carried an ad with the headline: "Glamorous 
Ladies Needed to Sell Glamorous Cars." 
</P>
<P>
The firm LA Cars informed out-of-work actresses that it "needs your talent to 
sell classic and exotic cars at our prime Sunset location." 
</P>
<P>
And you needn't worry about getting that big, unexpected call from your agent 
on the morning that you're supposed to go out and pound some fenders. 
</P>
<P>
LA Cars promised "flexible hours to accommodate your audition schedule." 
</P>
<P>
It was a typical movie premiere, except that spectators were advised to bring 
their own chairs. And the screen was set up on Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The film, "Just Another California Day," covered the 1978 Manhattan Open, which 
is considered the Wimbledon of Volleyball. Many of the 2,000 people who 
attended the free showing strained to see themselves in the crowd scenes. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to show it on the location where it was filmed," producer Terry 
Spragg said. "And I think it made Manhattan Beach feel good about itself. It 
was a happening." 
</P>
<P>
The movie, which was compared to surfing's "Endless Summer" by Volleyball 
Monthly, sat on the shelf for years. But Spragg, who is looking for a 
distributor, feels that interest in beach volleyball is at its highest now that 
ESPN covers it and that a fictional film on the sport ("Sideout") was just 
released. 
</P>
<P>
Spragg isn't sitting still, though. He's planning a second project that may 
prove to be even more difficult than dealing with Hollywood: He wants to tow an 
iceberg from the Antarctic to Southern California. He says he has the backing. 
</P>
<P>
And might he also film the event? 
</P>
<P>
"Definitely," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For that premiere, maybe he could put the screen on a barge. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Strech heard it at a park in Long Beach: A little girl on a swing was 
trying to persuade her father to push her. Finally, she pleaded: "Please, Daddy 
-- with sugar on top?" Then, apparently realizing she had said something 
terrible, she quickly added: "No, no. I mean: No sugar, no salt." 
</P>
<P>
Soon after hiring on as a copy boy at an L.A. newspaper, Herb Krauch saw the 
managing editor and a reporter punch it out in the city room. "He decided then 
that newspaper work would be an exciting way of life," says his son, Bob, who 
also became a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
That was 78 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Krauch, 93, rose to the editorship of the Herald Express and, later, the Herald 
Examiner. He'll be honored Wednesday night at the L.A. Press Club's 
headquarters at the Burbank Equestrian Center. 
</P>
<P>
As boss, Krauch maintained his cool during the bedlam that characterized the 
old Herald papers: The city room wedding of a reporter whose nickname was "On 
the Juice;" the party that featured a band, comedian Red Skelton and city 
officials to honor the renovation of the newspaper's bathrooms, and outbursts 
like that of Aggie Underwood, who tried (unsuccessfully) to skull an editor 
with a large fish when she thought she was getting lousy assignments. 
</P>
<P>
A pretty exciting way of life it was. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LAny:

The blinking red light that tops the stylus-shaped Capitol Records Tower spells 
out "HOLLYWOOD" in Morse Code. So far no one has altered that message.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: NATIONAL CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A robbery suspect was arrested Monday after an attempt to steal a car outside a 
doughnut shop failed. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Merrell Davis of the National City Police Department said a man armed with 
a .45-caliber handgun approached another man in the 1500 block of Highland 
Avenue about 6:15 p.m. and demanded his car keys. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman grabbed the man's keys and jumped in his car. But the would-be thief 
was unable to take the car because the steering wheel had an anti-theft device 
on it, Davis said. While the gunman was attempting to steal the car, a witness 
called National City police. 
</P>
<P>
When two officers and a police dog arrived, the thief fled. The police dog 
chased the suspect and bit him a couple of times, forcing him to drop his 
weapon, Davis said. The dog was called back by its handler and the chase 
continued several blocks toward Plaza Boulevard. Officer Lynn Martinez and 
Detective Mark Musgrove caught the man on Plaza Boulevard. Glenn James, 21, was 
arrested on suspicion of attempted auto theft, armed robbery and resisting 
arrest.

CENTER FOR DAY HIRES TO OPEN; 
</P>
<P>
SUN VALLEY: IT WILL OFFER FREE COFFEE, MEXICAN SWEET BREAD AND ENGLISH CLASSES 
TO ABOUT 200 LABORERS. IT WILL COST LOS ANGELES $3,500 A MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The city of Los Angeles will open a hiring center for day laborers in Sun 
Valley within weeks, the first such center to open in the San Fernando Valley, 
the coordinator for the city day labor program said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The city is moving ahead despite a small decline in participation at its hiring 
center in Harbor City, the first of seven centers to be established in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Cervantes of the day labor program said the city wants to locate the new 
center in the Sun Valley Recreation Center, 8133 Vineland Ave. 
</P>
<P>
If the city Recreation and Parks Department rejects the request, she said, the 
program would be established on an empty Department of Water and Power lot on 
Sherman Way between Radford and Hinds avenues. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Magnana, a field deputy for Councilman Ernani Bernardi, said a center at 
either site would serve 150 to 200 laborers, mostly from Mexico and Central 
America, who wait for jobs on Lankershim Boulevard between Strathern and 
Saticoy streets. 
</P>
<P>
"Some businessmen feel that laborers congregating near their businesses prevent 
customers from going into their establishments," Magnana said. "The hiring 
center will not impede existing businesses. It is a controllable area and is 
near employers who want workers and workers who want to be employed." 
</P>
<P>
The center will be operated by two supervisors out of a trailer on the site. 
While the workers wait for jobs, they will have access to portable toilets. 
They can also drink coffee, eat Mexican sweet bread and learn English in 
classes -- all free. The operation will cost the city about $3,500 a month, 
Cervantes said. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be safer for workers and prevent them from running into traffic and 
getting injured while they try to jump into employers' trucks," Magnana said. 
"It's a reasonable, humanitarian way of dealing with the different interests." 
</P>
<P>
The center will be the second to open under the city program, approved by the 
City Council in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported last week that some laborers had abandoned the Harbor City 
center, which opened in October, to return to an intersection popular among 
workers. Their presence at that intersection led to complaints of loitering and 
prompted officials to create the Harbor Regional Park center. 
</P>
<P>
The men said they left the center 
</P>
<P>
because there is not enough work to go around. City figures indicate that about 
18% of the laborers who come to find work can expect to take home a paycheck on 
any given day. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the project still attracts between 125 and 200 men daily, and 
many laborers and some city officials see the program as successful. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes said growing numbers of immigrants have increased the numbers of 
those standing on the corners. 
</P>
<P>
"You judge the success not by the elimination of the corner but by the 
reduction of numbers of people standing there," she said. "Instead of 180 at 
the old corner, we now have 30 or 40 maximum." 
</P>
<P>
A similar effort in the city of Glendale ended last September when the Catholic 
Youth Organization decided it could no longer allow day laborers to gather in 
its parking lot while waiting for employment. A CYO spokesman said enrollment 
in the organization's day care program had dropped more than 50% because 
parents feared leaving their children while dozens of workers waited outside. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Constine, a spokeswoman for Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who sponsored 
the Los Angeles hiring center proposal, said the city must convince employers 
to use the hiring centers. 
</P>
<P>
"If employers continue to pick them up at the corners, then day laborers will 
continue to congregate there," she said. "If the employers use the hiring site, 
then the laborers will go to the site. It's simple supply and demand."

Though important to the Navy, San Diego will not be exempt from proposed budget 
cuts facing the military, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a San Diego press conference, Cheney also put the kibosh on a 
controversial plan to alter Miramar Naval Air Station for use as a civilian 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, we have no plans to transform Miramar or to close down Miramar. 
I won't say we won't listen to proposals from the community -- obviously we 
will," Cheney said. "But I haven't seen anything yet that, as defense 
secretary, I find attractive enough in terms of saying: 'OK, we're going to 
close Miramar and take our business elsewhere.' " 
</P>
<P>
While in San Diego for the day, Cheney viewed Navy patrol boat units, a SEAL 
squad and parachute jump teams at the Naval Amphibious Base, and he addressed a 
crew of the amphibious assault ship Tarawa at the 32nd Street Naval Station. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney also sought time with enlisted personnel and officers to learn about 
their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"It's useful to get out of Washington once in a while to find out what real 
folks are thinking about," Cheney said. Most sailors were concerned about their 
future in the Navy while relations among many countries are thawing and some 
members of Congress are pressing for significant military reductions in 
spending, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney sought to allay some of those concerns, saying that he would not 
sacrifice readiness and quality of life while budgets are chopped. 
</P>
<P>
"I am committed -- so is the President -- to trying to protect the quality of 
life for military personnel," Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
"We (are) prepared to take the force down to whatever size the American people 
will support. But, when we get it down to that level, we want it to be the best 
we can make it. That you've got the best people . . . that they've got the best 
training and equipment they need to do the job we ask them to do. We don't want 
to go back to hollow forces that we had in the late '70s after Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney also sought to reassure city business leaders that San Diego will 
continue to play an important role as host to a significant military presence, 
though it will not be exempt from budget cuts. Although he declined to spell 
out how severely the city might be hit by force reductions, Cheney said: "San 
Diego has been, is now, and will continue to be an absolutely crucial part of 
U.S. naval posture and our military establishment. And that's not going to 
change." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney also spoke to a packed crowd at the San Diego Marriott Hotel celebrating 
the Chamber of Commerce's 120th anniversary. At the luncheon, the chamber's 
annual "Spirit of San Diego" award was given to Thomas W. Sefton, president of 
San Diego Trust &amp; Savings Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Questioned by the crowd after his speech and by reporters during a press 
conference about the Pentagon's position concerning Miramar, Cheney slapped 
down the idea of using the sprawling air station to help ease traffic at 
civilian Lindbergh Field.

PEOPLE: ARTIST FINANCES HER 'REAL' WORK BY PAINTING TIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carol Kredenser Goldmark earned a master's degree in art from Columbia 
University, so you might wonder why she spends so much of her time painting 
neckties. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm waiting to be discovered" is her simple answer. "I'm what's called an 
emerging artist," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But behind those statements is the automobile accident that nearly claimed her 
life four years ago. It "made me focus, made me realize what was most important 
to me. Besides my family, it was art," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Goldmark said, "the accident made me understand . . . that my art was 
a life-and-death issue that I didn't realize until I came home from the 
hospital and saw it on the easel. In a way, the accident was a blessing." 
</P>
<P>
Goldmark, 47, a sporadic artist for 30 years, also discovered that "time is 
passing quickly. Art was always important," she said, "but I tended to put it 
aside to take care of other things." 
</P>
<P>
So two years ago, the mother of two sons and wife of Rabbi Larry Goldmark of 
Temple Beth Ohr in La Mirada moved from her cramped art workroom in their Buena 
Park home to a rented art studio snuggled between a couple of car repair shops 
in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
She set out to make a name for herself in the art world and began painting 
eight hours a day, five days a week. She says her paintings illustrate "forms 
from the natural world," which include clouds, flowers and plants. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to show that the cycle of life is fleeting," said Goldmark, 
daughter of noted Boston artist Nathan Kredenser. 
</P>
<P>
But, as it is with many "struggling" artists, the rent on the art studio had to 
be paid. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed to make money, and after teaching art for 30 years, I didn't want to 
go back to that, so I started to sell my painted ties," said Goldmark, who uses 
live flowers as models for the floral ties, which are for both men and women. 
</P>
<P>
The tie business surfaced accidentally. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago, I needed something fabulous to wear at an important art show, 
so I painted flowers on one of my husband's solid-color silk ties and wore it," 
she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
It was an immediate hit. 
</P>
<P>
"That night, several people asked where I got the tie, and when I told them, 
they wanted to know how they could buy one," she said. "It started to take off 
fast." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, her ties were featured at a special showing at Nordstrom in South 
Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa. The store bought three dozen of them. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like the ties to be successful, but I don't want them to be so successful 
that it stands in the way of my real goal," Goldmark said. 
</P>
<P>
That goal is recognition from a major fine arts gallery and, most of all, to be 
exhibited. 
</P>
<P>
But until then, Goldmark will push ahead with her hand-painted silk ties made 
with acrylics and fabric paint. 
</P>
<P>
"The ties are natural extensions of my other work on canvas and paper," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She also plans to market other accessories, such as painted evening bags, hats, 
shoes, blouses and jackets. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the growing demand for her novel work on cloth, "I wouldn't like it to 
get too big," she said. "I have other goals that are more important to me." 
</P>
<P>
After winning an all-expenses-paid, seven-day vacation for two to anywhere in 
the world by raising $5,000 for the March of Dimes in last year's WalkAmerica 
in Orange County, Premier Homes Inc., of Corona, decided to donate it back. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County chapter of the March of Dimes then gave it to 19-year-old 
Eric Swanson, born with a spinal defect, who has been a March of Dimes 
volunteer for the past eight years, talking about his defect to others who are 
physically challenged. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson, of Yorba Linda, decided to spend the week in Orlando, Fla., and give 
the other ticket to his mother, Jean Anderson, also of Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>

What I cannot understand is your fascination with these simplistic street 
hoodlums. 
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks you have had at least three features on this subject. 
Your idealization of this costly, destructive and malicious act serves only as 
an ego-booster for the publicity-hungry gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing their accomplishments written up in a major newspaper serves only to 
propel them on to bigger and better acts of crime and mayhem.

IN LOS ANGELES, A MEXICAN BATTLE ROYAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Boxing is a big spectator sport in Mexico, so folks there are well aware of the 
old ring maxim that to beat the champ it's not good enough to fight him to a 
draw; you have to knock him out. Mexico's two biggest heavyweights -- President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari and former state Gov. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, leader of 
the main opposition party -- went a few rounds in Los Angeles Monday. Nobody 
scored a knockout, so the champ -- Salinas -- is still ahead on points. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas was in town for a speech to the American Newspaper Publishers' Assn. 
Though Cardenas' aides emphasized that his visit was planned some time ago, the 
timing was more than a coincidence. Salinas defeated Cardenas in Mexico's 1988 
presidential election by the narrowest margin in recent Mexican history. Ever 
since then Cardenas has dogged Salinas. In Los Angeles both men took their 
political messages to receptive audiences. President Salinas' speech to ANPA 
was well-received, particularly his prescription for what ails the Mexican 
economy: free trade and open markets on both sides of the border. Salinas 
doesn't like being called the Mexican Margaret Thatcher, but what else do you 
call someone who sells off state-owned companies, imposes austerity to reduce 
foreign debt and insists Mexican business learn to compete in the world? 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas spoke before the liberal Americans for Democratic Action, telling them 
that he has grave doubts about Salinas' latest plan for modernizing the Mexican 
economy -- a free trade pact with the U.S. Like many other traditional Mexican 
politicos, Cardenas worries that his country is so underdeveloped compared to 
its powerful northern neighbor that it would end up a weak sister, exploited 
solely for its cheap labor and natural resources. Such criticism may not play 
well here, but it might in Mexico, where Cardenas hopes to run for president 
again in 1994. (Salinas is limited to one 6-year term.) 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the great debate over Mexico's political and economic future was not 
resolved here, but it did make for great spectator sport. And it was a useful 
reminder for all of us in Los Angeles that, with almost 3 million people of 
Mexican descent living around here, not only is Mexico very important to this 
city, but this city is very important to Mexico.

IT'S BEST TO SAY: THE DEAL IS 'NO DEALS'; 
</P>
<P>
PRESIDENT BUSH IS PLAYING HIS HOSTAGE HAND JUST ABOUT RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A pale and malnourished Robert Polhill had barely ended his 1,183 days as a 
captive of Lebanese Shiite militants before word came that those who had a hand 
in his release -- including Iran and Syria -- now expect some tangible gesture 
of U.S. reciprocity in exchange for what Polhill's kidnapers had the effrontery 
to call their "humanitarian" action. 
</P>
<P>
Reciprocity? For what? For finally taking the minimally decent step of freeing 
one of eight innocent Americans from prolonged, cruel and utterly inexcusable 
imprisonment? By this twisted standard of obligation, a mugger who leaves his 
bloodied victim with bus fare to the hospital has a moral right to demand 
gratitude for his kindness. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush put it bluntly and correctly on Sunday when news came that 
Polhill had been let go: The United States won't trade for hostages, period. It 
detracts nothing from this principled stance to note that it is further 
buttressed by anxious political memories of the fiasco the Reagan 
Administration committed when it naively tried to swap arms to Iran for 
hostages from Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"No deals" should remain the U.S. position, without apology. The White House 
insisted again yesterday that all American hostages must be released 
unconditionally, the clear message being that, until this happens, Iran can 
expect no real improvement in its relations with the United States. Already, 
some voices are being heard decrying the inflexibility of that position, 
arguing as they have before that "moderate" forces in Tehran -- remember them? 
-- need the kind of support and encouragement that only a visible U.S. payoff 
can provide. This siren song once before lured American policy onto the shoals 
of international political humiliation. Let's hope the dark and bitter lesson 
that there can be no concessions to the sponsors of terrorism has been fully 
absorbed. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, there's little if anything the United States can do to influence 
factional power struggles in Iran. Terry Anderson, who has been held prisoner 
for more than five years, and the other six American hostages will be returned 
to freedom when the Tehran regime decides to order or force its ideological 
allies and agents in Lebanon to let them go, after calculating that Iran's 
national interests require nothing less. At this point, despite much 
speculation, there's no clear evidence that such a calculation has in fact been 
made. 
</P>
<P>
In time, it will have to be. For it should be clear by now, even to the most 
fanatical and obtuse of Shiite militants, that the hostages in Lebanon have 
long since lost whatever extortion value they were once believed to have. 
Tehran, increasingly desperate for Western help to rebuild its war-shattered 
economy, can only come to see that the hostages have become not just a depleted 
asset but an impediment to improving Iran's national fortunes. Doling out 
hostages one at a time, over long intervals, won't remove that impediment. The 
Bush Administration seems determined to avoid sending any signal that would 
suggest otherwise. It's doing the right thing, and in the right way.

UNITED STATES' ROLE IN TERRORISM BY GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kenneth Freed's article "Killing Fields of Guatemala Persist Despite U.S. 
Effort" (April 14) was gratifying for one reason: the fact that it appeared at 
all. Some 100,000 Guatemalans dead and 40,000 disappeared in 26 years is indeed 
staggering. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the story continues to go largely unreported in the U.S. press. 
</P>
<P>
Surprising? It shouldn't be. The CIA helped overthrow Arbenz's democratically 
elected government in 1954 for advocating land reform and human rights (a fact 
omitted from Freed's otherwise good piece). Since then U.S. tax dollars have 
paid for death-squad thugs to "disappear," torture and murder anyone they deem 
"dissident." 
</P>
<P>
The ambivalence of the U.S. Embassy official quoted on whether human-rights 
progress is "still a requirement of U.S. aid" to Guatemala belies our foreign 
policy's double standard: We champion popular movements that overturn "hostile" 
communist tyrants, but criticize rebellion against "friendly," right-wing 
butchers and murderers.

<P>
I am sorry that these children feel compelled to leave their mark on the world 
by destroying property that belongs to others, but truthfully, I neither asked 
for nor wanted their "autographs." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, as the article notes, attempts to stem the tide of graffiti are 
inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it is time to increase the fines attached to the crime to an amount 
that will cover the court and repainting costs. Or the violation should become 
a felony. Others have suggested adding a tax to marking pens and spray paint to 
be used for painting over the graffiti. Finally, the workers usually working 
off court-ordered community service could repaint the defaced freeway walls. 
</P>
<P>
All of these suggestions simply treat the symptoms and are Band-Aid measures at 
best, but in lieu of measures to treat the problem and in view of the immediate 
need for action, they seem reasonable.

RONALD REAGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A letter writer discusses our trade policies and talks about the total mess 
left us by Ronnie and his Wall Street buddies (letter, April 16). Hardly a week 
goes by that The Times doesn't print some letter that still takes a swipe at 
Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
I don't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican, liberal or conservative, one 
thing is a fact: By every unit used to measure government, be it inflation, 
gross national product, employment, whatever, Reagan gave us the best eight 
years we have ever had. That's not my opinion, the facts are there. Now the 
political analysts are giving him credit for eliminating Soviet Unionas a 
threat to the world. If that's true, the accomplishments of Washington and 
Lincoln pale by comparison.

to mention that it was the CIA that overthrew this fledgling democracy. Its 
president, Jacobo Arbenz, was implementing desperately needed agrarian reform 
(something like 2% of the population own 70% of the land), and in 1954 that 
sounded too much like communism. 
</P>
<P>
This snuffing out of agrarian reform coupled with the continuing fight against 
so-called international communism has brought about the near-genocide of the 
Mayan people who comprise two-thirds of the Guatemalan population. The Mayans 
are inheritors of a rich civilization that goes back more than 3,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
Since the military assumed power in 1954, they have brutally killed and 
massacred more than a 100,000 Indians who live in the Highlands where the 
insurgents make their camps; 440 Mayan villages have been destroyed while many 
others are in ruins without potable water; 50% of Mayan children die before 
they reach 5 years old; 150,000 refugees live in United Nations camps across 
the border. Disappearances continue, and death squads operate with impunity. 
Torture is practiced as a profession in the military. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. should discontinue all military aid to Guatemala, which is conducting 
a war against its own indigenous people. In Guatemala, communism and drugs are 
not the enemy, poverty is.

NO NIGHTINGALE ON PICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA BLANDFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hans Christian Andersen's emperor, it will be remembered, turned away from his 
tiny nightingale to a jeweled imitation, and his soul languished. It is a fairy 
tale for our time. 
</P>
<P>
Many years ago, in Beltzy, a village in Moldavia by the Russian-Romanian 
border, a boy spent his days catching birds in the park. In his aviary at home, 
the boy had about a hundred birds -- brilliant and singing birds, celebrating 
life in his colorless days. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, the Union Pawnshop on Pico Boulevard, resembles an aviary. The screen 
over the door gives an impression of beings fluttering and caged within. The 
customers have ornately beaded hair, expressive faces and voices, scarlet and 
royal blue silks. Others, in plainer, washed-out clothes, come with children 
who scamper and hide. 
</P>
<P>
Many of them know David Zinberg, the pawnbroker. He is a tall, loose-limbed man 
in white sweats and running shoes. He has large, kind hands and as he takes the 
rings, necklaces and crosses from their owners, he is gentle with them. It is 
not hard at such moments, to see the small boy who once cradled golden finches 
and ran home with them from the park in Beltzy. In his pocket is a palm-sized 
pistol. Loaded. There were shadows then; there are shadows now. 
</P>
<P>
He was 16 when his family finally left Russia. He had grown up fast and knew 
only one way of being -- working hard and getting on. "Success," he likes to 
say "is not a final destination. You've got to do it every day." He left school 
at 15, sold shoes for a few years, made porcelain crowns in a dental lab for a 
few more. He is 32 now, married for five years, owner of the pawnshop for 15 
months. "Dentists are a sorrowful bunch," he says. "This -- this is life." 
</P>
<P>
He bought the shop from an old man whose eyes were failing. He loves that old 
man, who owns the building still and comes in to shout at him and berate his 
new ways. The old man's shop was empty: In 15 months, Zinberg has $300,000 in 
loans out on the street. He stores the pledges carefully in the back. The shop 
itself is a jumble of unredeemed collateral put up for sale, merchandise owners 
could not -- or did not bother -- to collect. 
</P>
<P>
Electric guitars worth hundreds, stereo equipment worth thousands, VCRs, 
microwave ovens, computers and typewriters still in boxes, televisions, 
cameras, silver flutes, a violin. Who could have walked away from these, the 
symbols of our riches? How can we have turned everything into trash and 
trinkets? 
</P>
<P>
Three cases are full of jewelry trays: great rings embossed as lions' heads, a 
map of Africa encrusted with diamonds, watches like gold sculptures, chains as 
heavy as bricks, all thrown into pawn. Easy come, easy go. Against these, the 
other trays have a touching pathos: fine chains, crosses, wedding rings, 
engagement and eternity bands, the stuff of life, not of deals. "No, I don't 
listen to the stories," says Zinberg. "Not anymore. Most of them are lies. No 
matter if your mother died an hour ago, it's the same loan. For me, it's not a 
melodrama." 
</P>
<P>
He weighs the gold, tests the diamonds but mostly trusts his own eye. His eye 
and his word: It is still an ancient and old-fashioned business. An $800 
engagement ring? Thirty years of life in a worn wedding band? To him, it is $7 
of gold, a $25 loan. "Coins, silver, jewelry: garbage for me, pieces of metal," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
Electric items have their own problems: Beta is finished, records are obsolete. 
"Can I eat 60 turntables?" On the other wall are the good loans: guns. Guns 
never go out of fashion. Pistols, shotguns, automatic weapons. "We're ready if 
war comes." Is this why he left his country, struggled for years, to be a gun 
dealer? "I'm not a judge or a jury -- I don't make assumptions about people. I 
do everything legal with the Justice Department. That's America." Who did the 
guns belong to, that they were left as forfeit: heavy military revolvers for 
$499, a handy Mom-sized pistol for $69? And in the midst of families worrying 
about $10 for a bracelet, $25 for a ring, there is the chilling spectacle of 
customers toying with a stereo, toying with a gun, as if both were mere 
shopping and pretty much interchangeable. 
</P>
<P>
"People in this business are very, very tough," Zinberg says. He means other 
people. Does it worry him that in a business with 95% black or Latino 
customers, that he stands before them the Jew of myth, the pawnbroker of old? 
Four months to pay, 10 days' notice before forfeit, 40% annual interest: "A 
pawnshop is a bank for the small person. How come when a business person gets a 
$1-million loan, everyone thinks he's so clever, and when a person comes in 
here for $100, then I'm a disease? I'm an honest man, I owe no one, I sleep 
very well." 
</P>
<P>
He talks as if he has not been altered by the way he lives, six days a week, 
pistol always ready, alert every second for the step, the enemy at the gate. 
</P>
<P>
In the blare of stereos being tested, of keyboards being tried, one listens in 
vain for the innocent voice of the bird who once sang: the emperor's 
nightingale.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Allan Malamud 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pat Riley should not have to apologize to anyone for resting Magic Johnson, 
James Worthy and Mychal Thompson the final night of the regular season in 
Portland. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It was the wise and proper thing to do. The game was meaningless. Byron Scott 
already was hurting. Why risk further injuries five days before the start of 
the playoffs? . . . 
</P>
<P>
The guy stirring up the fuss, Trail Blazer President Harry Glickman, may be 
using this as a psychological ploy. Just a little something more to arouse the 
Portland fans should the Lakers and Blazers meet in the playoffs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If the Lakers beat the Blazers by 29 points -- as they did March 31 at the 
Forum -- will Glickman accuse Riley of pouring it on? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Maybe King Coach Tom Webster should have put Mario Gosselin, not Ron Scott, in 
the nets at 0:00 of the first period instead of 12:13 of the second period 
Sunday night at the Forum. . . . 
</P>
<P>
But the real difference in this series is in the other net. Bill Ranford 
continues to sizzle for Edmonton. He gave up four goals in Game 3, but 
prevented so many others that he was voted first star. . . . 
</P>
<P>
How important is a hot goaltender at playoff time? Well, just imagine the 
Dodgers being able to start Orel Hershiser every night in the National League 
Championship Series and World Series. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Ranford never has been compared to the all-time greats. The Oilers' injured 
goalie, Grant Fuhr, has. But Ranford has been to his team the last few games 
what Richard Brodeur was to the Vancouver Canucks when they reached the Stanley 
Cup finals in 1982. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the Kings have missed the steady, grinding play of Dave Taylor. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Regular King goaltender Kelly Hrudey is 0-6-2 against the Oilers this season. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky earned his pay in Game 3, playing courageously and effectively 
after reinjuring his back. . . . 
</P>
<P>
However, the Great One and Bruce McNall would just as soon forget Sunday. A 
couple of hours before the Kings took the Forum ice, Frankly Perfect -- the 
stakes runner co-owned by McNall, Gretzky and Jerry Buss -- stepped in a hole 
and was injured during the San Juan Capistrano Handicap at Santa Anita. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If Clipper owner Donald Sterling expects to sign a big-name coach to succeed 
Don Casey, he's going to have to pay big time for it. Hubie Brown, among 
others, has turned down the job in the past because of meager contract offers. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers are about to make their 13th coaching change since 1970. During 
the same period, the Angels have made 11 such changes, the Kings 11, the Lakers 
five, the Rams four, the Raiders three and the Dodgers one. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Utah (55-27) vs. Phoenix (54-28) is the most attractive first-round matchup 
since the NBA went to the 16-team playoff format. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Funny how often Jose Canseco gets misquoted out of context -- or at least 
claims he does. . . . With their thin bullpen, Jay Howell is the player could 
least afford to lose. However, Jeff Hamilton's injury may prove to be a 
blessing to the Dodgers because it has given Lenny Harris a chance to play at 
least against right-handed pitching. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Premiere Handicap, which has been changed to the Shoemaker Handicap and 
will be run Sunday at Hollywood Park, was the only race in which Citation ever 
finished out of the money. Big Cy either won, placed or showed in each of his 
45 career starts except for the 1951 Premiere, in which he finished fifth. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
George Foreman, the 1968 heavyweight boxing gold medalist, has been nominated 
for the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Among the highlights of the USC-UCLA track and field meet Saturday at the 
Coliseum will be the Legends' eight-man, 800-meter relay. UCLA will feature 
four former NCAA champions -- Warren Edmonson, John Smith, Milan Tiff and Benny 
Brown. The USC lineup will include two former world record-holders and Olympic 
Games champions -- Rex Cawley and Don Quarrie. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Who do you like in the MISL playoffs? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Either the Rams made a great deal when they traded a fifth-round draft choice 
for New York Jet starting cornerback Bobby Humphery or Humphery is no good. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
The Herschel Walker trade made it possible for the Rams to draft Bern Brostek 
in the first round. If Minnesota hadn't sent its first pick to Dallas, the 
Vikings most likely would have taken the University of Washington center. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Idaho quarterback John Friesz was the Rodney Peete of this draft. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Falcons must think more of Chris Hinton than Eric Dickerson does. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Don't tell Joe Montana that defense is what wins championships. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I wonder if Al Unser Jr. has ever gotten a speeding ticket in Long Beach.

BRUINS BEAT CANADIENS, 6-3, NEAR SWEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It hasn't happened in 61 years, but the Boston Bruins are on the verge of 
sweeping the Montreal Canadiens in the NHL playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, with two goals from John Carter, beat the Canadiens, 6-3, Monday 
night at Montreal to take a 3-0 lead in their best-of-seven Adams Division 
championship series. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins' only other sweep of the Canadiens was in a best-of-five series in 
1929, their teams' initial playoff meeting. The Bruins can advance to the Wales 
Conference final with a victory at Montreal Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't that sure about (winning) it before tonight, but we are now," 
Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
Only two teams in NHL playoff history, the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1942 and the 
New York Islanders in 1975, have rebounded from 3-0 deficits to win. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been done in the past, not often, but what better place to start than 
with the 20 guys in this room," Montreal center Brian Skrudland said. "We've 
just got to go out and win the next game and take it from there." 
</P>
<P>
Carter broke a 2-2 tie at 5:30 of the second period when he beat Patrick Roy 
with a high wrist shot from the lower right circle for his second goal of the 
game and third of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Propp made it 4-2 at 6:58, beating Roy from in front for his third goal 
of the playoffs. Roy, the NHL's top regular-season goaltender, was lifted in 
favor of Brian Hayward. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 7, New York Rangers 1 -- John Druce scored eight goals for the 
Capitals in 45 regular-season games, but he continued his offensive binge in 
the playoffs, scoring two goals during a four-goal first period at Landover, 
Md., as the Capitals took a 2-1 lead in the Patrick Division finals. 
</P>
<P>
Druce scored his eighth and ninth goals of the playoffs by twice stuffing in 
his own rebound. He also assisted on Geoff Courtnall's goals in the first and 
third periods. 
</P>
<P>
The Capitals, who took a team playoff-record 49 shots, had their victory 
tempered somewhat by the loss of goalie Don Beaupre, who left the game after 
suffering a groin pull at 3:16 of the first period. His status for the rest of 
the series was not known.

THE PREPS: WITH INJURED HAMSTRING HEALED, YENDORK IS AGAIN JUMPING FOR JOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Juliana Yendork of Walnut had reason to smile after picking up her award as the 
top high school girl in the field events at the Mt. San Antonio College Relays 
last Saturday afternoon. She had won the girls' invitational long jump with a 
leap of 18 feet 10 3/4 inches, after having won the triple jump Friday night 
with a mark of 41-10 1/2, which broke her own meet record. 
</P>
<P>
And projecting future efforts made her even happier. 
</P>
<P>
For weeks before the Mt. SAC meet, Yendork had been hampered by a right 
hamstring injury, which caused her to miss several meets and practice time. Now 
she can look ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"My injury really set me back," Yendork said. "If I had not gotten hurt, I 
would be (triple) jumping 44 feet right now." 
</P>
<P>
Yendork, a junior, is already well known locally. Among her accomplishments: 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1989 state titles in the long jump and triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A national indoor record in the triple jump of 42-5 1/2, set at the 
national interscholastic championships in Syracuse last month. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The sophomore national triple jump record of 42-6 3/4, which made her the 
No. 3 all-time prep performer. 
</P>
<P>
However, Yendork's greatest feat might have been competing in the long jump in 
the 1988 Seoul Olympics for her native country, Ghana, when she was 15. 
</P>
<P>
Yendork left Ghana when she was 6 and lived in Houston until 1985, when her 
father, Charles, took a job as men's and women's track coach at Paul Quinn 
College in Waco, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I started competing, we would send updates on my performances back to 
Ghana," Yendork said. "Because they knew about my dad and were kept up to date 
on me, they sent for me to compete in the African Games in Algiers." 
</P>
<P>
Yendork made the most of that opportunity by winning the long jump with a 
then-personal best leap of 18-8 1/2, which opened the door for her to make the 
Ghana Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
"When I went to Seoul, I was excited more or less just to be there," Yendork 
said. "My mind was not into the competition because I was so young. I wasn't 
thinking about my future then." 
</P>
<P>
She failed to qualify for the finals in the long jump, finishing 16th in the 
preliminaries. 
</P>
<P>
After the Olympics, Charles Yendork realized that Juliana had outstripped her 
competition and needed a better place to train, so he resigned from Paul Quinn 
and checked with friends about moving to California. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a high-risk move for me to leave a full-time job to come out here," he 
said. "But the situation was much better for her here." 
</P>
<P>
Yendork found work as assistant track coach at Walnut High -- he has since 
moved to coach the jumpers at Mt. SAC -- and Juliana, who had set a national 
Junior Olympic triple jump record at 40-10 while living in Waco, quickly made 
her presence felt, becoming one of the country's best jumpers last spring. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not have any real problems adjusting to our move out here," Yendork 
said, who became a U.S. citizen in December. "I was able to start training more 
seriously on my technique and emphasize on the little things." 
</P>
<P>
With her father as her coach, Yendork improved her triple jump by nearly two 
feet last season. Now she has set her sights on the national prep record of 
42-10 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year I have been able to improve by two feet on my triple jump, but my 
injury slowed me down so far this season," said Yendork, who also is a fine 
sprinter. "But now I am almost 100% and my goal is reach 45 feet and to compete 
in the World Junior championships." 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday night, standout sprinter Inger Miller of Pasadena Muir announced 
her decision to attend USC next fall, following in the footsteps of her father, 
Dr. Lennox Miller, who was a sprint star at USC and won Olympic silver and 
bronze medals in the 100-meter dash in 1968 and 1972. 
</P>
<P>
"My father and I went over the pros and cons of every school I was 
considering," said Miller, whose final college choices were USC, California, 
Brown and Texas. "It came down that I wanted a small-school situation."

INTEREST RATE JITTERS SEND DOW DOWN 29

<P>
The stock market lost another round in its battle with higher interest rates 
Monday, sliding for the fourth straight session as bond yields continued to 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrial stocks dropped 29.28 to 2,666.67, 
extending its loss since last Tuesday to 99.10 points. 
</P>
<P>
In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advances by nearly 4 to 1 
in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 328 up, 
1,229 down and 425 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume retreated to 136.15 million shares, from Friday's 174.26 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said fears of rising interest rates kept a dominant influence on the 
mood of investors. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell steeply last week -- pushing their yields to the highest 
levels in a year -- on worries of rising inflation and talk that Japanese 
investors were big sellers of U.S. bonds. As bond prices fall, their yields 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
The selloff in bonds has pummeled stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson heightened concerns when he 
said inflation remains a problem here and abroad. Traders interpreted his 
remarks to mean the Fed may tighten credit, forcing rates higher still in an 
effort to choke off inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Among individual stocks, Time Warner, which posted a first-quarter loss, 
slipped 1 3/4 to 92 5/8. King World Productions slumped 1 3/4 to 35 1/2, which 
some traders attributed to disappointment that takeover rumors surrounding the 
stock haven't panned out. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas, which reported disappointing first-quarter results after the 
close Friday, slid 3 7/8 to 51 1/4. A number of analysts cut earnings 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange also closed lower Monday in dull trading. 
The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues fell 156.37 points to close 29,679.07. 
</P>

In Frankfurt, the DAX index plunged 2.5% to 1,837.50, in part a reaction to 
growing militancy on the part of the country's largest union, traders said. 
Share prices were also lower on London's Stock Exchange amid worries over 
interest rates. The Financial Times 100-share index fell 27.9 points to end the 
day at 2,159.2.

Bond Prices Drop in Cautious Trading 
</P>
<P>
In the credit markets, bond prices slipped in light trading, echoing declines 
overseas as the market awaited economic reports due later this week. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 7/32 point, or about $2.19 per 
$1,000 face amount. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, rose to 8.96% from 
8.94% Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the yield on the 30-year bond was as high was last May 11, when 
it stood at 9.07%. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year bond has plunged more than $41 per $1,000 over the past seven 
trading days in response to signs of increasing inflation, a stronger economy 
and worries about upcoming bond issues, including the Treasury's quarterly 
refunding set for next month. 
</P>
<P>
There were few forces acting on the bond market Monday except for a softness in 
prices in overseas trading before U.S. trading began, said William V. Sullivan, 
director of money market research for Dean Witter Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the government is scheduled to release reports on durable goods orders 
for March and the employment-cost index for the first quarter, while the first 
report on the gross national product for 1990 is set to be announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.188%, unchanged from Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Climbs as Mark Heads Lower 
</P>
<P>
In foreign exchange trading, the dollar rose against most major currencies, 
benefiting from the West German mark's weakness. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation that U.S. interest rates will continue to move higher as the 
economy continues to expand also encouraged dollar buying, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices were mixed, rising in New York after falling in some overseas 
markets. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for April delivery 
settled at $378.90 an ounce, $2.30 higher than Friday's close. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Holzer, chief currency dealer at Harris Trust in Chicago, said the mark 
was sold heavily amid worries about the consequences of planned German 
unification. 
</P>
<P>
The governments of East and West Germany have said they will merge their 
economies on July 1 as a prelude to full unification, expected next year. But 
the governments haven't reached a final pact on linking their currencies. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 157.55 Japanese yen from 157.60 yen at 
Friday's close. Later, in London, it was unchanged. In New York, the dollar 
settled at 157.55 yen, up from 157.50 yen on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The British pound rose to $1.6365 in London from $1.6357 late Friday. Later in 
New York, sterling dipped to $1.63565 from Friday's $1.6388. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Pork Bellies Rise the Trading Limit 
</P>
<P>
Prices of most pork belly futures contracts surged the permitted daily limit of 
2 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange after an Agriculture 
Department report showed smaller supplies than traders had anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, hog futures rallied while cattle futures were 
mixed; orange juice futures fell sharply; oil futures advanced; cotton was up; 
precious metals were mixed, and grain and soybean futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Frozen pork belly futures settled 1.1 to 2 cents higher, with the contract for 
delivery in May up 2 cents at 64.32 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
The run-up in the belly market had been expected since late Friday, when the 
USDA released a monthly report showing 97.5 million pounds of the raw bacon 
meat in the nation's commercial freezers at the end of March.

Beckman Instruments Inc.: The Fullerton company reported first-quarter profit 
of $8 million, down 25% from the same period in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Sales for the quarter were $185.5 million, a decrease of 7% from the year 
before. The decrease was blamed on a reduction in government funding for 
biological research, unusually large shipments in the 1989 quarter, a movement 
by customers toward operating leases instead of purchases and an increase in 
research and development expenses. Beckman develops and manufactures automated 
systems and supplies used in biological research laboratories.

CalFed Inc.: The Los Angeles parent of California Federal Bank said 
first-quarter net income rose 8% to $18.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
Net interest income in the financial services segment, the primary source of 
earnings, grew 28% to $128.5 million. CalFed's results benefited from a 
$1.3-million net gain on the sale of its London-based Anglo American Insurance 
Co. unit. California Federal Bank's interest rate spread at March 31 was 2.24%, 
compared to 1.47% a year before.

TROUBLED TANDON POSTS GAIN FOR QUARTER; 
</P>
<P>
TURNAROUND: AN UPDATED LINE OF PERSONAL COMPUTERS HELPS BOOST SALES BY THE 
MOORPARK MANUFACTURER TO $105 MILLION, AS ITS FOUNDER DENIES RUMORS HE'S TRYING 
TO SELL THE COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MEDEARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tandon Corp., a Moorpark computer company that has managed only one full year 
profit since 1985, reported dramatically improved results in the first quarter 
of 1990, buoyed by sales of its personal computers in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Tandon's profit for the first quarter that ended March 31 was $7 million, 
compared to a loss of $9.86 million for the first quarter of 1989. The 
company's sales jumped 13% to $105 million in the first quarter, from $92.7 
million a year before. 
</P>
<P>
The company's founder, Sirjang Lal Tandon, attributed the improved sales in 
part to a new line of personal computers that use a faster type of 
microprocessor made by Intel Corp. Microprocessors, which are the parts of 
computers that read and carry out instructions, help determine how well and how 
fast a particular personal computer performs. 
</P>
<P>
Tandon, who also goes by the first name of Jugi, countered speculation that 
Tandon Corp. is hanging out a for sale sign. "Everything in the world is for 
sale," Tandon said. "But I'm not looking for a buyer at this point." 
</P>
<P>
Last August, Tandon Corp. announced that it had retained investment banker 
Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. to help it explore financial options, but Jugi Tandon 
said the idea was simply to have underwriters "on board." 
</P>
<P>
The improved results could mark the beginning of an important turnaround for 
Tandon Corp. The company made its mark by selling computer data storage devices 
called disk drives. For a while, the company and its founder flourished, with 
Tandon Corp.'s stock trading as high as $34.25 per share in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
But the disk drive business was battered by Japanese competition, and Tandon 
Corp. retreated from that market and sold most of its disk drive business two 
years ago. The company remade itself as a producer of personal computers, 
largely for the European market, which now accounts for about 90% of Tandon's 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
But the strategy did not pay off immediately. Tandon Corp. racked up losses 
totaling about $199 million from 1985 through 1989, reporting a year-end profit 
only once -- of $23.5 million in 1987. Meanwhile, the company's stock 
collapsed, trading as low as 50 cents a share last fall. 
</P>
<P>
As the stock sank, so did Jugi Tandon's personal fortune. He was listed in 
Forbes magazine in 1983 as one of the 400 richest individuals in the United 
States, with his 11% stake in the company then worth an estimated $150 million. 
By last fall, Jugi Tandon's 7.3% stake in the company had a paper value of only 
about $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
But the stock market seemed pleased by the latest quarterly results, which were 
released last Thursday. Tandon Corp. stock closed at $2.25 on Friday, up 25 
cents since Wednesday, boosting Jugi Tandon's stake to a value of about $10 
million. 
</P>
<P>
There were other signs of recovery. The company's cash reserves, which had 
dipped as low as $7.1 million as of Sept. 30, 1989, soared to $32.1 million by 
March 31. 
</P>
<P>
But the better results have not come without pain. Tandon Corp. last year laid 
off about 240 workers, or about 25% of its employees.

ERMA BOMBECK: FOR EVERY KID WHO DROPS OUT, SCORES DROP IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's 1990. Do you know where your children are? 
</P>
<P>
What a question! Of course you know where they are. You read the newspaper and 
watch television. Some of them are making touchdowns, winning spelling bees and 
earning scholarships. The rest of them? They're doing drugs, getting pregnant, 
cruising, skipping school, running away from home, stealing cars, playing with 
guns and traveling in gangs. 
</P>
<P>
If that's what you think, you need to be enlightened. There's a huge segment of 
the teen-age community that rarely makes it to the pages of the newspaper or on 
"film at 11." 
</P>
<P>
By news standards, they're not doing anything that dramatic or that 
spectacular. They're just washing cars to earn money for a child's liver 
transplant, delivering flowers to nursing homes and hospital patients, reading 
to the blind and dishing up food for the homeless on a Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
They're hugging the Special Olympians who cross the finish line, picking up 
trash from our roadsides, and recycling bottles and cans. They're climbing 
mountains to benefit kids with cancer and teaching water safety at parks and 
recreation programs. 
</P>
<P>
Some of them are in the counseling business, manning crisis hot-lines for their 
contemporaries who are deep into drugs and alcohol and are contemplating 
suicide. They're filling out the ranks of the Red Cross and United Way, working 
at food banks and Ronald McDonald Houses, and giving aid to police programs. 
</P>
<P>
For every kid who "drops out" of school, there are scores of teen-agers who 
"drop in" to tutor a sick child. In fact, according to a Gallup Poll, 50% of 
all American teen-agers volunteer on the average of five hours a week! 
</P>
<P>
Every year in my city, young people dump thousands of little rubber ducks (at 
$5 a shot) in a canal to stage the Great American Duck Race. It's their way of 
showing their involvement against drug abuse. Recently, a high school class 
threw a prom for the residents of a home for the elderly. (They actually did 
get good media coverage on this.) 
</P>
<P>
Too often, adults don't bother to look beyond the stone-washed jeans, the punk 
haircuts, the giddiness, the vocabulary and the culture of youth. But 
compassion comes wrapped in many packages. What is perceived as the "Gimme 
Generation" contributed heavily last year to the number of Americans who 
volunteered $150 billion worth of their time. 
</P>
<P>
In a world where "troubled teens" is a redundancy, it's good to know one out of 
every two of our kids has discovered the meaning of life: Find a greater need 
than your own and serve it.

FESTIVAL TO OFFER A MARATHON OF PLEASURES FOR CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Youngsters will discover a kaleidoscope of entertainment -- music, dance, 
comedy, storytelling, puppetry and much more -- at the "Second Annual 
International Children's Festival" at Mission Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday through Sunday, 12 groups will perform 81 shows on three stages, 
while strolling minstrels please the ear, face-painters ply their brushes, and 
a Saturday dance marathon offers festival-goers a chance to shake a leg. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego performers, many of whom are festival veterans, include the event's 
artistic director, singer-songwriter Nels Lund, with his "Peanut Butter Cookies 
Band"; folklorist and musical storyteller Sam Hinton; the Trio Flamenco, with 
Gypsy dances of Spain, and storytellers Harlynne Geisler and David Novak. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Speach's "Bubble Mania" will allow audience members to find out what 
it's like to be inside a bubble -- a big bubble. 
</P>
<P>
Trekking from Northern California to perform are Diane Ferlatte, with African, 
Southern and African-American stories, and the nationally known Magical 
Moonshine musical puppet troupe. Also from the north, Canada's Al Simmons will 
be back with his zany "Creative Comedy Galore." 
</P>
<P>
Three Los Angeles companies making the trip include the Jim Gamble Puppets. 
Internationally known Gamble -- who has appeared at Japan's World Puppet 
Festival -- designs his colorful marionettes, hand and rod puppets, and has 
performed with them for more than 35 years. His troupe will present "The 
Greatest Little Show on Earth," an upbeat, circus theme show for all ages. 
</P>
<P>
Two first-time Los Angeles participants are Parachute Express and J. P. 
Nightingale. 
</P>
<P>
Parachute Express, the hot musical trio that has been packing in children age 
18 months and up -- and their parents -- will perform "Bouncin' to the Beat," a 
slick mix of jazz, doo-wop and R&amp;B. 
</P>
<P>
J. P. Nightingale, veterans of the children's theater scene, will bring their 
signature musical story theater geared to preschool to sixth-graders. The 
multitalented trio -- John and Pam Wood and Joe Tripoli -- act, sing and play 
guitar, flute, synthesizers, kazoo and spoons, and maintain a humorous dialogue 
with their audience. 
</P>
<P>
John, whose offbeat sense of humor always lurks close to the surface, and Pam, 
who has a gentle, sisterly appeal and a big, melodic voice, have been 
performing together for 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
They tour Southland schools, host the Hollywood Bowl's open-house summer 
program and work hard as the creative force behind an annual, two-day 
children's theater festival in Agoura Hills. They're also parents of 8-year-old 
Andy. 
</P>
<P>
And, just so they don't find time on their hands, they teach creative drama to 
teachers two days a week. 
</P>
<P>
John Wood, 40, estimated they have done about 6,500 shows. He said they keep 
the performances fresh by "finding wonder in a child's response . . . looking 
at faces that are absolutely absorbed in what they're seeing. They help us give 
a better performance; it's like a partnership." 
</P>
<P>
He also reflected on the value of the group's comfortable, 
just-like-old-friends performance. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is so media-oriented today," he said. "The pace is so frenetic -- 
quick-cut, quick-edit. So many times you don't really have to listen -- you get 
the beat, not the words. A live performance allows a child to enjoy the moment, 
lets them participate, observe and listen. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a lot of messages in our shows," he added. "Just basics, like 
the value of the written word, the similarities between people from different 
backgrounds and self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
"Three people cooperating and having a good time, that's really the essence of 
our show," Wood said. "It has a comfortable feel that comes out in the way we 
work together and have for so long. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter if anybody comes to see us," he said. "We'll still have 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
 The festival will be held in Mission Bay at Mariner's Point, on West Mission 
Bay Drive across from the Bahia Resort Hotel, Wednesday through Sunday, with 
performances on Wednesday through Friday from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.; Saturday, 
10:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. (Dance-a-Thon fund-raiser 8:30 to 10:30 a.m.) and 
Sunday, 11:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets are $3 per child; $2 for adults, with a $10 maximum per family. Each 
ticket allows admission to all shows and activities. Refreshments and picnic 
areas are available. For information, call the festival's hot line, (619)

LENINGRAD BALLET PERFORMANCE IN S.D. CANCELED

The May 12 performance by the Leningrad State Ballet has been canceled by its 
sponsor, the California Ballet, because of a continuing dispute over the 
ownership of works created by the Soviet company's late founder Leonid 
Jakobson. 
</P>
<P>
The company, under the direction of former Kirov Ballet dancer Askold Makarov 
since Jakobson's death in 1975, is battling with Jakobson's widow and son over 
copyrights to more than 100 Jakobson works, including the "Choreographic 
Miniatures," which were to have been performed in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute involves international copyright laws, but also Irina Jakobson's 
displeasure with her husband's successor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a question of copyrights," said California Ballet director Maxine Mahon. 
"The Leningrad Ballet owns the rights, according to Soviet law. But Jakobson's 
widow filed copyright papers with the American copyright office March 30, and 
we don't want to put the California Ballet in jeopardy by going ahead with the 
concert." 
</P>
<P>
Mahon said she received a fax message from a Soviet agency Friday, advising her 
not to present the Jakobson works by the Leningrad company. 
</P>
<P>
M. J. Bogatin, a San Francisco attorney representing the Jakobson family, 
discounted Mahon's claim. 
</P>
<P>
"She's wrong. The copyrights are absolutely the property of the widow, and the 
Leningrad State Ballet has no claim of rights whatsoever of ownership to these 
copyrights," he said. "They are entitled to perform them in the Soviet Union 
under compulsory rights, but not in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The local performance would have been the company's U. S. debut. A six-city 
East Coast tour is still scheduled for late May, although the company will not 
perform any Jakobson works, according to producer Lev Eynisfeld. Mahon said 
California Ballet would not present the Leningrad company in a program without 
works by Jakobson, "because that's what we've been promoting for a year and a 
half. We had made a commitment and felt we would take it in the chops if we 
delivered something else." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Epstein, a lawyer with the New York firm of Proskauer, Rose Goetz &amp; 
Mendelsohn, has also been retained by the Jakobson family. He confirmed that 
American copyrights were filed "recently" and said the choreographer's widow, 
Irina Jakobson, who is now a teacher at the San Francisco Ballet, has 
"presumptive ownership in this country." 
</P>
<P>
Bogatin added that Jakobson's widow "has always been amenable to the licensing 
of the choreography to the California Ballet, but through her own sanctioned 
instructors and performers. She would welcome the opportunity for more 
exposure, but can't sit idly by while unsanctioned performances take place." 
</P>
<P>
In March, Jakobson told The Times that Makarov is not maintaining her husband's 
work properly. She cited this as the reason that she and her son don't want 
California Ballet learning the works from Makarov and his dancers. 
</P>
<P>
Makarov has been in residency at the San Diego-based company to set the 
Jakobson pieces on the local dancers. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll stay on for several weeks," said Mahon, "and he'll be teaching the 
dancers other (non-Jakobson) works. Fortunately, the dancers haven't (left) 
Leningrad yet, so we just decided to cancel before they had to leave." 
</P>
<P>
Mahon estimates that about 50% of the tickets had been sold to the performance 
in the 3,000-seat Civic Theatre and said cash refunds will be available to all 
ticket holders.

Garbo a Paul Lynde Fan?: What did Greta Garbo do while she was alone all that 
time? She watched a lot of TV, according to People magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Although the reclusive star collected valuable art and antiques (her will named 
her niece as sole beneficiary), her taste in television was rather pedestrian. 
Raymond Daum, a friend of the actress, told the magazine that Garbo once said, 
"If a program is advertised as experimental, I never turn it on." Kenny 
Kingston, a psychic whom Garbo consulted, says she was especially enthralled by 
"Hollywood Squares": "She adored Paul Lynde. I think she even wrote him a fan 
letter." GREG BRAXTON

Leningrad Ballet Bows Out: The Leningrad State Ballet has canceled its May 12 
performance in San Diego because of an ongoing dispute over the ownership of 
ballets created by the company's late founder Leonid Jakobson. Since Jakobson's 
death in 1975, the company has been directed by Askold Makarov, a former 
leading dancer with the Kirov Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Irina Jakobson, widow of the company's founder, has claimed that the heirs, and 
not the company, are the legal owners of the ballets. The performance was being 
sponsored by the San Diego-based California Ballet whose director, Maxine 
Mahon, said, "We don't want to put the California Ballet in jeopardy by going 
ahead with the concert." The performance would have been the Leningrad State 
Ballet's U.S. debut. The company has also canceled its six-week residency in 
San Diego, although Makarov will still work with the California Ballet. GREG

"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" continues to dominate the box office. With 
weekend ticket sales of $9.7 million, New Line Cinema's PG-rated turtle tale 
has now grossed $89 million. 
</P>
<P>
Touchstone Pictures' R-rated romance, "Pretty Woman," also continues its 
winning streak. Weekend ticket sales of $8.3 million bring its grosses to $71.7 
million. Meanwhile, with receipts of $3.5 million -- and grosses of $95 million 
-- Paramount Pictures' "The Hunt for Red October" is now cruising toward the 
prestigious $100-million mark. 
</P>
<P>
Among new titles, only Orion Pictures' "Miami Blues" placed in the Top Five. 
The black and blue (and blood-red) comedy-drama, about the exploits of a 
sometimes-likable sociopath (Alec Baldwin), earned about $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
* MGM/UA's just-out "Lisa," about a terrorized teen-ager, grossed $1.1 million 
in limited release at 287 theaters, for a solid per-screen average of $3,902.

Stations Smoke Out Anti-Smoking Ads: Three television stations -- KABC in Los 
Angeles, KGO in San Francisco and KFSN in Fresno -- won't run one of the 
state's new anti-smoking commercials, saying the spot "trashes" the tobacco 
industry. The disputed commercial shows tobacco executives fretting about 
replacing the thousands of smokers who quit or die or each day. Officials for 
Capital Cities/ABC, the parent company of the TV stations, said the commercials 
implies that the tobacco industry wants to kill people by encouraging them to 
smoke. GREG BRAXTON

<TEXT>
<P>
Projecting vivid commitment and avid inner joy, Kathak dancer Anjani Ambegaokar 
led members of her Sundar Lala Kendra school -- including her daughter Amrapali 
Ambegaokar -- in a riveting yet informal program Friday at the Forum Theater in 
Yorba Linda (repeated Saturday night in Beckman Auditorium at Caltech in 
Pasadena). 
</P>
<P>
In examples of pure dance technique, Anjani expresses her uniqueness in the way 
she transmits the shuddering energy of rapid foot beats upward through a strong 
but pliant torso; amplifies and modulates it into a centrifugal force unfolded 
in superbly articulated arms and hands, then finally explodes that power 
outwards from long, aristocratic fingers as she snaps into final position. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the coyness and flirtation of a woman trying to hold back her 
lover in "Gazal" suited her less than the violent rage of the unworshiped Lord 
Indra and the transcendent benevolence of Lord Krishna in "Goverdhan Leela" 
(both examples of the dance-drama aspects of Kathak). 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the high point of the program proved a series of playful, 
intricately matched, improvised rhythmic challenges between her and master 
tabla player, Ustad Sattar Tari, who also offered a virtuosic solo. 
</P>
<P>
Whether in following Anjani's lead or re-creating village festival life on 
their own, Ambegaokar's (six) young students looked accomplished and promising. 
</P>
<P>
Mala Ganguly provided sweet-toned vocalism. Scott Marcus was the minimalist 
sitarist. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, none of the dancers appeared to be fazed by the persistent flash 
photos taken by their fans, seemingly oblivious to the blinding hazards they 
were offering the objects of their devotion. CHRIS PASLES

</P>

<P>
The most striking of Graciela Iturbide's photographs are the oddball ones, in 
which peculiar details of dress or stylized gestures take center stage, 
enveloped by the rich blacks of the silver gelatin print. 
</P>
<P>
Like the shot of child from Juchitan, Oaxaca, with a comb casually stuck on the 
back of her long wet hair like a festive ornament. Or the image of a stately 
man in a long flowered dress who holds a small mirror reflecting the other side 
of his sexually ambivalent face. Or the tight closeup of impassive young women 
from East Los Angeles in their skimpy white tops who demonstrate the sign 
language of their gang. 
</P>
<P>
Yet a survey at the Cal State Long Beach Art Museum of Iturbide's work from the 
past 17 years (to June 1) ultimately displays the photographer's old-fashioned 
decorum and aesthetic sensibility. Born into an upper-middle-class home in 
Mexico City in 1942, Iturbide ventures into the worlds of her subjects with a 
pilgrim's devout fascination and an aesthete's concern for niceties of 
composition and lighting. 
</P>
<P>
Her lens doesn't pry; it ennobles and sympathizes. Even the curious or 
outlandish sitter is viewed from a respectful distance and set within a 
carefully stage-managed composition alive with subtle gradations of blacks and 
grays. A former student and assistant of Manuel Alvarez Bravo, Iturbide comes 
honestly by her interest in the ritual aspects of everyday life in rural Mexico 
and her penchant for isolating single figures against swaths of empty sky or 
cracked and splattered old walls. 
</P>
<P>
Death and festivity appear to be the two constants of Iturbide's sitters, 
mostly small town folk from various regions. The proud, fleshy middle-aged 
women who sell food, swig beer or clasp each other in friendship wither into 
crones and anguished mourners. Even the children have a memento mori aura about 
them. Unsmiling, often seen in fiesta costume as virgins or angels, these 
little girls are reminiscent of the grave fancy-dress subjects of 
literary-minded Victorian photographers. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, Iturbide stands at a respectful remove to photograph a Juchitec 
teen-aged bride-to-be lying under a sheet with scattered flowers and splattered 
chicken blood after a ritual sexual assault by her fiance. Darkness seeps in on 
all sides, isolating the girl in a victim's cage of fear and loneliness. In 
select images like this one, tact, sympathy and finely calibrated lighting give 
a "documentary" scene a symbolic charge and quietly feminist perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Gormley's Vision: British artist Antony Gormley is best known for life-sized, 
lead-covered plaster figures that stand, sit or recline alone or in coolly 
conjoined pairs. Seams demarcate these smoothly generalized bodies into 
strictly symmetrical portions, calling attention to the "piece of work" that is 
man -- the rational, twinned nature of body parts as well as the human duality 
of spirit and matter. Although the "skins" of these figures are mapped 
territories, their interior lives remain aloof and unknowable. 
</P>
<P>
The 12 ink drawings in Gormley's "Bearing Light" series represent an extreme 
reduction and condensation of his sculptural concerns, including his recent 
treatment of man-as-architecture in a concrete "room" with tiny orifices sited 
on the Australian desert and the hooded heads of pairs of figures commissioned 
for the political battleground of Londonderry in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
In the drawings, simple black silhouettes evoke various sights: the bulk of a 
head, shoulders and upper torso; a slim, tall archway; narrowed eyes; a head on 
its side with oddly truncated ears. An infant on its stomach, like a specimen 
frog, is a study in doubles: curled fists, ears, knees, halved rump. A 
post-and-lintel arrangement can be read as a the lower half of a human figure. 
Intersecting black discs suggest the monocular vision of someone peering down a 
gun sight. 
</P>
<P>
Seen as a group, the images -- which also include an irregular, slightly 
chewed-looking cross -- might be an elliptical shorthand for the watchers and 
the watched, the victims and the perpetrators in Britain's long-standing civil 
war. Yet Gormley's overriding vision extends beyond any specific state of 
events to the underlying dichotomies and betrayals of mind and body.

Jiri Goes to Sea: During the past decade, Czech-born Jiri Georg Dokoupil has 
moved from one international capital to another while picking up and discarding 
various approaches to art. He made flashily dislocated Neo-Expressionist 
paintings, assembled a goofy series of sculptures out of the names of corporate 
entities, turned out faux-naive, antic drawings of children. 
</P>
<P>
His latest enterprise, "Marina," offers a deadpan twist on traditional 
seascapes and Impressionist harbor images. His models are banal images cut out 
of boating magazines and projected on a screen. Suspending a gessoed canvas 
horizontally from the ceiling, he copies the image with soot from a burning 
candle. The soft black rings create a kind of exaggerated pointillist effect. 
Ocean liners, yachts, tiny human figures, churning water, humps of land -- all 
are reduced to the same insubstantial, loopy black script. 
</P>
<P>
Reducing images of the world to black smudges on a white ground has its 
parallels in photography (and its precursors in blurry, photo-like paintings by 
Gerhard Richter). But Dokoupil takes the idea a step further. His process 
translates the notion of the painter's personal "touch" into a mere 
will-o'-the-wisp -- or a soiled byproduct of the light of reason -- that is 
ready to be blown off the canvas by the next strong wind of a new art movement. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, a fixative is applied to these canvas in deference to potential 
buyers' worries about permanence. So much for the purity of an idea. Dokoupil 
has used the soot technique before, in a series of media-derived images of 
gilt-edged art auctions. His dust-to-dust look at art production ultimately 
seems better suited to events that equate art with monstrous sums of money. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart Regen Gallery, 619 N. Almont, to May 26. 
</P>
<P>
Art as Product: "Frontier Tales" at Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (to 
May 20) is steeped in the wishful belief that somewhere, somehow, there are 
artists creating interesting stuff in ultra-commercial, unschooled or 
ultra-private formats. It isn't too surprising to discover that the "finds" on 
view are pretty lame. The commercial product (Clive Barker's "Pinhead" doll, 
film poster, etc.) seems undistinguishable from than zillions of other such 
cult-consumer items. The rag-tag homemade work is longwinded and tedious at 
worst, cute at best (Russell Crotty's wall of tiny surfer images that read as a 
huge abstract design from afar.) 
</P>
<P>
And yet a deliciously batty portion of an installation by Joan Mahony does make 
a case for art that's part window-dressing, part scavenger hunt.

A RARE 'RICHARD II' AT POWERHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER At 3116 2nd St., Santa Monica, Tuesdays, 8 p.m., through May 
15. $9; (213) 660-7237.

<TEXT>
<P>
"Richard II" is infrequently staged. The Angel City Repertory production, 
directed by Randall Sommer at the Powerhouse, makes one wonder why. 
</P>
<P>
Shakespeare's tragic history of incompetence and ambition did not amuse his 
regal patrons. His Richard is utterly over his head, unable to squelch his 
court's internal quarreling, which breaks out into an open rebellion led by 
Henry Bolingbroke. 
</P>
<P>
"Richard II" is that rare drama that details how a king falls and another -- 
Bolingbroke, becoming Henry IV -- assumes power. Characters define the action, 
so Sommer has designed a basic, actors' theater style to support the text. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the six-member cast (all in black, changing costumes on stage between 
scenes) play multiple roles, crossing age and gender. These are young actors, 
and no matter how stooped-over Timothy Earle tries to be, his John of Gaunt is 
unfortunately silly. Sheffield Chastain plays Bolingbroke as a California 
rebel, but his reading lacks his colleagues' clarity. 
</P>
<P>
Clarity is the least attribute of Dov Bierman's Richard. His king is 
interestingly tempted and repelled by power, an internal division given added 
weight by Bierman's uncharismatic appearance. He makes the inevitable royal 
collapse a hard one on the soul, a sad figure miscast by life's hazard. ROBERT

CBS' 'MALCOLM TAKES A SHOT' SCORES SOME SERIOUS POINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unusually fine cast and a few glimpses of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (as himself) 
fire up today's serious "CBS Schoolbreak Special," "Malcolm Takes a Shot" 
(Channels 2 and 8 at 3 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
(The show was originally scheduled to air in March, but CBS postponed it 
because its plot is disturbingly close to events surrounding the death of 
Loyola Marymount basketball star Hank Gathers, who collapsed on the court just 
two days before the program was to air.) 
</P>
<P>
John Clair is Malcolm, the hotshot of the high school basketball team, whose 
celebrity status makes him slight the importance of schoolwork and teamwork. 
His waking thoughts are all for basketball, and he's confident of an athletic 
scholarship, even though he's letting his class work slide. At night he dreams 
of going one-on-one with Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
When he suffers an epileptic seizure during a game, his dream becomes a 
nightmare. He is withdrawn and angry, until a friend (Gregory (Mars) Martin, in 
an especially nice turn) helps him reassess his priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Lending weight to the proceedings are Tony Lo Bianco as the concerned coach, 
Susan Ruttan as a dedicated teacher, Mario Van Peebles (who also directed) as a 
doctor who dispenses information about epilepsy, and Margaret Avery as 
Malcolm's mother. 
</P>
<P>
Clair is more than just a handsome young face; he's believable as a teen who's 
baffled and angry at what life has dealt him, then finds his real strength. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Gookin's script and Van Peebles' direction give events a natural feel, even 
though, as usual in these afternoon, youth-targeted message shows, everything 
is tied up neatly at the end of the hour.

COUNSELOR PLEADS INNOCENT IN BATTERY

<TEXT>
<P>
A former Oxnard high school counselor who is accused of spanking female 
students had his attorney enter a not guilty plea for him Monday to four counts 
of battery in Ventura County Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Stephen L. Mitnick entered the plea on behalf of Robert 
Bradley, 36, of Camarillo, a former counselor at Santa Clara High School in 
Oxnard, who did not appear at his own arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley was fired in January from the private Catholic school because of 
allegations that he had spanked students and shown "inappropriate physical 
affection," according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael K. Frawley. Frawley would 
not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley had worked at the school for 13 years as a counselor, teacher and coach 
for the girls' sports teams. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley could not be reached for comment at his home Monday, and a woman who 
identified herself as his wife said, "We have no comment." 
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, school administrators sent letters to the parents of each 
of the more than 300 girls who attend Santa Clara High. The letter said if 
Bradley "engaged in any acts of physical discipline, including spanking or 
inappropriate displays of physical affection with you or someone you know 
about, it is important that you contact the District Attorney's Office 
immediately." 
</P>
<P>
Each count of misdemeanor battery carries a maximum penalty of six months in 
prison and a $2,000 fine. Bradley's jury trial in Municipal Court is set for 
May 15. MACK REED

AMBULANCE FIRM TO OPEN STATION

<P>
Months after Moorpark officials criticized the slow response of emergency 
crews, a Thousand Oaks ambulance company is planning to open a new station as 
early as mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
A temporary station for Pruner Ambulance will be set up at the old Sheriff's 
Department station on Olsen Road between Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley, Ventura 
County Emergency Medical Services Administrator Barbara Brodfuehrer said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Brodfuehrer said a new radio communications system will be installed at the 
station. The addition of a new station closer to Moorpark is expected to cut 
down response times, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark residents and City Council members have increasingly complained over 
the past year about ambulance crews taking up to half an hour to respond to 
emergency calls. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Paul Lawrason said the station may open as early as mid-May and will be 
staffed with paramedics. Although the station will be set up for 90 days, the 
city will pursue plans for a permanent station, Lawrason said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials believe the new station will help reduce response times of 
ambulances and paramedics, cutting down the average to about eight minutes, he 
said. Previously, ambulances on average had been responding to emergencies 
within 11 minutes, according to county emergency medical service reports.

COUNCIL ALLOCATES $805,000 FOR WELLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura City Council, moving to alleviate the city's water shortage, 
approved funds Monday to increase the capacity of some of its wells and to 
continue construction of another. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted unanimously and without comment to allocate $805,000 toward 
installing two deep-well pumps and other improvements at the Golf Course Wells 
near the Buenaventura Golf course. 
</P>
<P>
The improvements will increase the wells' pumping capacity by 2 million gallons 
a day, Public Works director Shelley Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
The council also voted unanimously to spend $25,000 on construction of a well 
in Saticoy. The city had already invested $14,500 in this project, and about 
$60,000 more will be needed to complete the project, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
The funds for both projects will come from the city's capital improvement fund, 
he said.

DOWNTOWN PARK TO GET A NAME AT LAST

<TEXT>
<P>
A contest to name Fillmore's downtown park on Central Avenue comes to a close 
tonight, as the City Council is set to chose among four finalists. 
</P>
<P>
The park has existed as long as the town itself, but has never had a name, 
according to City Clerk Noreen Withers. 
</P>
<P>
Withers said about 36 residents have entered the contest. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore's Parks and Recreation Commission selected four finalists: "Freedom 
Park", "Patriots Park", "Fillmore Central Park" and "Railroad Park." 
</P>
<P>
The park covers two city blocks along the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks, and 
includes a gazebo and a cannon donated by a veterans' organization in 1937, 
according to Dorothy Haase, unofficial town historian and curator of Fillmore's 
Historical Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Placed facing the street, the antique gun is an eye-catching feature, and 
"Cannon Park" has been used by some residents as an unofficial name. The cannon 
itself made history 25 years ago, when Haase said it was kidnaped by a 
not-so-sober citizen and trundled down the street. 
</P>
<P>
The park is leased from Southern Pacific for a token $5 per year by the Chamber 
of Commerce. According to Chamber manager Marge Halter, the park is in constant 
use by the community for events ranging from art shows and barbecues to high 
school rallies and diaper derbies. 
</P>
<P>
The person whose winning name is chosen by the council tonight will receive a 
$50 U.S. Savings Bond. JANET BERGAMO

SURVEY SAYS DRUG PROGRAMS NEEDED

<P>
More facilities are needed to treat chemically addicted pregnant women, adults 
and youths in the county, according to an informal survey of area residents 
conducted by the Ventura County Health Care Agency. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of forums held since February throughout the county, residents said 
that gaps in county services force many addicted adults and youths to fend for 
themselves, said Stephen Kaplan, Health Care Agency administrator of Alcohol 
and Drug Programs. 
</P>
<P>
While county officials are unsure of the actual number of residents who need 
drug and alcohol recovery services, it is clear that many simply aren't getting 
the help they need, Kaplan said. 
</P>
<P>
"Currently, if you are a male in this county with no or limited medical 
insurance and you want to get into a residential recovery unit, you're 
basically out of luck," Kaplan said. 
</P>
<P>
Women under the age of 18 who want to recover from drug or alcohol addiction 
have access to a six-bed facility in Ventura, but a similar county-run 
residential program for males does not exist, Kaplan said. 
</P>
<P>
Several area hospitals offer residential treatment programs, "but they are out 
of reach of anybody who has a limited income and no medical insurance," Kaplan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from increasing the number of treatment facilities, residents have also 
called for more programs to prevent troubled youth from becoming addicted to 
alcohol and drugs and better outreach to the Spanish-speaking community, Kaplan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Forums are scheduled at 7 p.m. Wednesday at the Simi Valley Library, 2969 Tapo 
Canyon Road; the Oxnard Community Center, 200 E. Bard Road, on May 23 and the 
East Valley Area Sheriff's Station, 2101 E. Olsen Road, Thousand Oaks, on June

CENTER WHERE DAY LABORERS CAN FIND WORK TO OPEN IN SUN VALLEY; 
</P>
<P>
TRAILER: PROGRAM WILL OFFER FREE COFFEE, MEXICAN SWEET BREAD AND ENGLISH 
CLASSES TO ABOUT 200 WORKERS. IT WILL COST LOS ANGELES $3,500 A MONTH.

<P>
The city of Los Angeles will open a hiring center for day laborers in Sun 
Valley within weeks, the first such center to open in the San Fernando Valley, 
the coordinator for the city day labor program said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The city is moving ahead despite a small decline in participation at its hiring 
center in Harbor City, the first of seven centers to be established in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Cervantes of the day labor program said the city wants to locate the new 
center in the Sun Valley Recreation Center, 8133 Vineland Ave. 
</P>
<P>
If the city Recreation and Parks Department rejects the request, she said, the 
program would be established on an empty Department of Water and Power lot on 
Sherman Way between Radford and Hinds avenues. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Magnana, a field deputy for Councilman Ernani Bernardi, said a center at 
either site would serve 150 to 200 laborers, mostly from Mexico and Central 
America, who wait for jobs on Lankershim Boulevard between Strathern and 
Saticoy streets. 
</P>
<P>
"Some businessmen feel that laborers congregating near their businesses prevent 
customers from going into their establishments," Magnana said. "The hiring 
center will not impede existing businesses. It is a controllable area and is 
near employers who want workers and workers who want to be employed." 
</P>
<P>
The center will be operated by two supervisors out of a trailer on the site. 
While the workers wait for jobs, they will have access to portable toilets. 
They can also drink coffee, eat Mexican sweet bread and learn English in 
classes -- all free. The operation will cost the city about $3,500 a month, 
Cervantes said. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be safer for workers and prevent them from running into traffic and 
getting injured while they try to jump into employers' trucks," Magnana said. 
"It's a reasonable, humanitarian way of dealing with the different interests." 
</P>
<P>
The center will be the second to open under the city program, approved by the 
City Council in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported last week that some laborers had abandoned the Harbor City 
center, which opened in October, to return to an intersection popular among 
workers. Their presence at that intersection led to complaints of loitering and 
prompted officials to create the Harbor Regional Park center. 
</P>
<P>
The men said they left the center because there is not enough work to go 
around. City figures indicate that about 18% of the laborers who come to find 
work can expect to take home a paycheck on any given day. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the project still attracts between 125 and 200 men daily, and 
many laborers and some city officials see the program as successful. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes said growing numbers of immigrants have increased the numbers of 
those standing on the corners. 
</P>
<P>
"You judge the success not by the elimination of the corner but by the 
reduction of numbers of people standing there," she said. "Instead of 180 at 
the old corner, we now have 30 or 40 maximum." 
</P>
<P>
A similar effort in the city of Glendale ended last September when the Catholic 
Youth Organization decided it could no longer allow day laborers to gather in 
its parking lot while waiting for employment. A CYO spokesman said enrollment 
in the organization's day care program had dropped more than 50% because 
parents feared leaving their children while dozens of workers waited outside. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Constine, a spokeswoman for Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who sponsored 
the Los Angeles hiring center proposal, said the city must convince employers 
to use the hiring centers. 
</P>
<P>
"If employers continue to pick them up at the corners, then day laborers will 
continue to congregate there," she said. "If the employers use the hiring site, 
then the laborers will go to the site. It's simple supply and demand."

L'ITALO-AMERICANO, THE VOICE OF IMMIGRANTS IN THE SOUTHLAND SINCE 1908 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In San Francisco, New York, Chicago and elsewhere, Italian-Americans who live 
in the comfortable anonymity of the suburbs can return to their roots in the 
remnants of old Italian neighborhoods, where the language and culture have 
withstood change. 
</P>
<P>
Although Los Angeles has the fourth-largest Italian-American population in the 
country, it has no such urban enclave serving as a symbolic cultural hub. But 
Los Angeles does have L'Italo-Americano, a bilingual weekly newspaper published 
in the San Fernando Valley and distributed statewide. It is the voice of the 
Italian language and immigrant experience in California. 
</P>
<P>
"The neighborhoods are gone, but something else has replaced them," said 
Kenneth Scambray, a literature professor and writer at the University of La 
Verne, and L'Italo-Americano's book critic. "The newspaper is an extremely 
valuable instrument for maintaining communication between groups as they spread 
out." 
</P>
<P>
L'Italo-Americano (The Italian-American) was founded in 1908 and has been 
published since 1971 at Villa Scalabrini, a Valley retirement home run by an 
order of priests serving Italian immigrants worldwide, the Scalabrini Fathers. 
The newspaper has grown from a two-page local paper published exclusively in 
Italian and dominated by Cleto Baroni, a Florentine immigrant and editor for 
almost 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 15 years, the paper has added a section covering the San Francisco 
Bay Area and an English-language section. Because of its dispersed and diverse 
audience, L'Italo-Americano plays several roles simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a segment of our readers for whom our newspaper is the main, if not 
the only, avenue of information," said Father Mario Trecco, editor since 1971. 
"We are here to please a variety of different tastes. Some people may come to 
it because of the recipes and find cultural news. Some may look at the cultural 
and discover social events. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
About 1.1 million people of Italian descent live in California, according to 
government studies, nearly half of them in Southern California. But there are 
only a few outposts in the Los Angeles area where Italian-Americans can make 
pilgrimages to their roots. 
</P>
<P>
The Casa Italiana cultural center and adjoining St. Peter's Church in Chinatown 
are solitary vestiges of a former Little Italy nearby, on North Broadway. There 
are scattered social clubs, stores and restaurants in San Pedro, Alhambra, 
Arcadia, Eagle Rock. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California and elsewhere, language and urban geography are no 
longer the pillars of ethnic identity. The fluid nature of society in 
California speeded the process by which immigrants became assimilated, 
dispersed and "upraised," the term used by historian Andrew Rolle in his book 
about Italian immigration in the West. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are looking at is simply the fact that Italian-Americans have gone on 
to another level of the pluralism in American society," Scambray said. 
</P>
<P>
Trecco and assistant editor Luigi Smaldino produce the newspaper for an 
estimated 35,000 readers from basement offices in Villa Scalabrini. Up-to-the 
minute news and soccer results come from the Italian news wire, ANSA. 
Correspondents contribute from overseas and around the state. 
</P>
<P>
L'Italo-Americano is "two papers in one," Trecco said. The Italian-language 
section presents news from Italy and the world on the front pages, followed by 
U.S. and California news focused on Italian people and events. 
</P>
<P>
Columnists include Hollywood chronicler Argentina Brunetti and "Donna 
Carlotta," a mysterious gossip columnist whose targets have included Zsa Zsa 
Gabor and comedian Billy Crystal, the latter for a joke he made alluding to 
organized crime while hosting the Oscar ceremonies. The statement was condemned 
by Italian-American groups. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Carlotta's identity remains top secret despite insistent inquiries by 
readers such as Carlo Rambaldi, the Oscar-winning special effects craftsman, 
Smaldino said. 
</P>
<P>
The front section attracts immigrants who prefer to read and speak Italian, 
even if they have been here for decades. Jenny De Santis, 88, is among older 
women who follow weekly excerpts from a historical novel about Sicily. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy reading Italian," she said in Italian during a telephone interview. 
She said she has lived in this country 66 years. "I've learned to speak 
American, but to write," she said, switching to English, "for-getabout." 
</P>
<P>
Advertisers target readers for groceries, legal and medical services, 
mortuaries, travel agencies. Trecco said the response shows that an enduring 
consumer population prefers to do business in Italian. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes advertising becomes for a lot of Italians a recommendation," Trecco 
said. "If they are served badly they hold us responsible. We have to be 
careful." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, in the years after the paper's acquisition and switch to nonprofit 
status, which prohibits political involvement, readers called in asking for the 
political endorsements they had followed during Baroni's time. 
</P>
<P>
Other readers say they want to learn or keep in touch with the language. 
Students in Italian classes, such as those of UCLA professor Althea 
Caravacci-Reynolds, subscribe at a discount. "It is a good vehicle for 
promoting the study of Italian," Caravacci-Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Fabiani, Mayor Tom Bradley's chief of staff, counts himself among 
subscribers who struggle through the paper in hopes of improving the Italian 
they never quite learned. 
</P>
<P>
"I can read a little bit," said Fabiani, 32. He is the grandson of southern 
Italian immigrants and grew up in Pennsylvania. "I do my best every week." 
</P>
<P>
Fabiani then turns to the English-language section, which makes up one-third of 
the paper and is geared to younger readers and others looking for information 
about community and culture. 
</P>
<P>
Trecco writes an overview in English of Italian politics and prints excerpts of 
books on travel and history. Topics range from the government crisis generated 
by the kidnap-murder of Prime Minister Aldo Moro in the 1970s, to a local 
Sicilian cultural festival, to a film project about the architect of the Watts 
Towers, Simon Rodia. 
</P>
<P>
Readership increased with the addition of English, Trecco said, although the 
language division is the subject of contention. 
</P>
<P>
One disgruntled former subscriber is Tom Ruatta. He gathers with other senior 
citizens of northern Italian origins for bocce matches in the festive, spacious 
clubhouse of the Garibaldina M.B. Society in Highland Park, where Italian and 
English echo in unison. 
</P>
<P>
Ruatta canceled his subscription because of the predominance of Italian pages. 
He thinks the newspaper should bow to the inevitable, switch to English and 
appeal to the bulk of the ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the reason I quit," he said. "How many of us read Italian? I don't have 
time to sit there and try to read it." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, Secondo Actis demurred. The retired businessman and his wife divide 
their time between their native Turin and "Il Vallone," as he calls the San 
Fernando Valley. Actis said the paper will not be Italian if it loses the 
language. 
</P>
<P>
But he predicted that the language and groups like the Garibaldina, a mutual 
benefit society-turned social club with 900 members, are doomed because young 
people are not interested. 
</P>
<P>
"We are too spread out," he said in Italian. "In 20, 25 years, when the people 
in this place have died, these things will disappear." 
</P>
<P>
This debate about the future of the Italian-American press and community has 
taken place around the country. 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago, for example, a city with a more numerous and visible 
Italian-American community than Los Angeles, the Fra Noi monthly is thick and 
thriving. But it has traditionally devoted only a few pages to Italian and many 
pages in English to columns by local politicians. 
</P>
<P>
On the opposite extreme, readers around New York still support an 
Italian-language daily, America Oggi. 
</P>
<P>
Caravacci-Reynolds and Scambray said the Los Angeles paper will endure in its 
current form because the study of Italian is increasing, spurred by the efforts 
of Italian-American organizations and interest on the part of Italians and 
non-Italians. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the underlying connection has to be made through the language," 
Scambray said. "We must continue to put pressure on people to read the 
language." 
</P>
<P>
Trecco said he sees his mission as fomenting love of the language, but not 
necessarily as protecting its survival. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's destined to disappear as a living language used for everyday 
communication in this country," he said. "However I see an increasing need in 
the second and third generation of pursuing the study of the language for 
cultural reasons."

Japan's justice minister ordered the extradition of a Chinese hijacker who said 
he commandeered a passenger jet to escape political persecution for his role in 
last June's pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tian An Men Square. 
Justice Minister Shin Hasegawa ordered prosecutors to turn Zhang Zhenhai, 36, 
over to Chinese authorities by May 23 to stand trial for hijacking an Air China 
Boeing 747 with 233 people aboard last Dec. 16. Human rights activists 
protested the decision, saying Zhang is sure to be tortured and possibly 
executed in China.

The Cypriot government approved continuation of its spring hunting season, the 
last in Europe, despite strong opposition from environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the season, which began Sunday, Interior Ministry game department 
chief Costas Papamichael rejected charges that the season amounts to a 
slaughter. He insisted that hunters "are very lucky if they get two birds and 
are normally quite satisfied with that." Environmental groups oppose the spring 
hunting because it falls during the breeding season of migratory birds.

A massive "glacier" of molten rock from erupting Kilauea Volcano destroyed 
three more homes in a rural housing area near Kalapana, Hawaii, civil defense 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The lava flow from the volcano has destroyed 10 homes in four days. The flow 
has halted no more than 40 feet away from another dwelling, following its 
pattern of spending long periods reinflating and then suddenly surging forward 
to engulf more land. "It's stopped, but it's still hot underneath. We don't 
know where it will break out yet," said a civil defense worker.

TRAFFIC SLOWS FOR HARBOR FREEWAY PROJECT; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: THERE WERE NO MAJOR TIE-UPS DUE TO START OF CONSTRUCTION FOR 
BUS AND VAN DECK. BUT AN AFTERNOON ACCIDENT AND DRIZZLE FOULED THINGS UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD B. TAYLOR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Traffic on the Harbor Freeway was turned into a commuter's nightmare Monday 
afternoon by an injury accident and the start of construction on a $55-million 
overhead deck for the crowded roadway. 
</P>
<P>
All morning, northbound traffic was slow-and-go because the heavy construction 
work in the freeway's median, between Slauson Avenue and Martin Luther King 
Boulevard, was attracting gawkers, but there were no major tie-ups, as had been 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Then -- as a giant crane began lowering a 70-ton steel casing into the first 
foundation hole near 51st Street -- it started to drizzle, slowing northbound 
traffic even more. 
</P>
<P>
By 2 p.m., traffic on the southbound lanes also had slowed to a crawl through 
the construction area because of an unrelated major injury accident near 
Manchester Avenue, two miles south of the construction site. 
</P>
<P>
It took nearly an hour for the crane to lift the 80-foot-long steel cage into 
vertical position and drop it down the eight-foot-wide foundation hole. During 
this time, traffic inched past, but once the cage was out of sight, things 
returned to slow-and-go. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the afternoon's congestion, California Department of Transportation 
officials were pleased that the first day of work on the Harbor Transitway 
Project had gone so smoothly. It will take several months to erect the 50 huge 
Y-shaped pillars that will support the elevated bus and van pool transitway, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Caltrans' own engineers had recommended against attempting to work 
during daylight because moving the huge steel casings and the reinforcing steel 
cages would "create havoc with the freeway traffic" and present a safety hazard 
if one of the giant steel cages broke loose and fell across traffic lanes. 
</P>
<P>
But top Caltrans officials rejected that recommendation and announced that the 
contractor would be allowed to work during the day. They said the California 
Highway Patrol would run traffic breaks whenever there was a chance that the 
work could endanger motorists. 
</P>
<P>
The original start date for the 2.6-mile decking phase of the project had been 
April 16. But irate transportation experts from the city of Los Angeles, Mayor 
Tom Bradley and Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) vigorously 
protested the idea of shutting down the freeway at any time during daylight 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans junked the traffic break idea and decided to go ahead without stopping 
traffic during the daytime. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first real work in the median and we had some concerns about 
working in such a tight area," said Dan Goble, Caltrans construction chief. 
"The goal is to do the work without disrupting traffic too much . . . (and) 
this morning's operation went smoothly." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Conner, assistant general manager of the city transportation department, 
agreed that traffic seemed to flow as well as could be expected Monday. There 
seemed to be no extra cars on the nearby city streets, he said.

MEXICAN PRESIDENT BLASTS ABDUCTION OF DRUG SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari charged Monday that the apparent 
abduction of a Guadalajara physician to Los Angeles to face drug-related 
charges threatens the war on drugs, telling a gathering of newspaper publishers 
here that the United States cannot eliminate "one illegality with another 
illegality." 
</P>
<P>
Salinas told a luncheon at the 104th annual convention of the American 
Newspaper Publishers Assn. -- meeting this week in Century City -- that the 
apparent role of U.S. drug agents in the reported kidnaping April 3 of Dr. 
Humberto Alvarez Machain undermines efforts to stop the flow of narcotics from 
Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
"The battle against narcotics traffickers requires unprecedented international 
cooperation," Salinas said, delivering his remarks in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
"But that cooperation, in order to be effective and real, has to be 
accomplished with the strictest international respect and no unilateral actions 
against the law and rights of other nations. It is not with abritrary acts by 
the pursuers that we are going to combat the illegality of the narcotics 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
"This runs the risk of creating illegal habits among those who have the 
obligation of defending the law and could create a problem much larger than the 
one we are trying to combat." 
</P>
<P>
The speech came during a hectic schedule for the Mexican president at the 
Century Plaza Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, he presided over a ceremony in which Mexico, for the first 
time, agreed to extend medical benefits to the families of Mexican citizens 
working outside of the country. Under the historic agreement, eligible members 
of the United Farm Workers Union of America would pay between $160 and $200 a 
year for comprehensive health care for immediate family members back in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas also met separately with Mexican-American businessmen and Chicano 
activists before returning to Mexico City late in the day. 
</P>
<P>
The role of agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in the Alvarez 
affair has created an uproar in Mexico, where government officials claimed the 
United States violated Mexican sovereignty and interests. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican authorities have charged that DEA agents offered as much as $100,000 
for the abduction of Alvarez, who U.S. authorities believe was present during 
the torture of slain DEA agent Enrique Camarena in 1985. Mexican authorities 
believe Alvarez was forcibly removed from his home in Guadalajara and flown to 
El Paso, Tex., where he was arrested by U.S. officials. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez is now in Los Angeles, facing drug-related charges in connection with 
Camarena's death. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles federal judge has asked U.S. officials to explain Alvarez's 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the chief spokesman for U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said he 
could not foresee any circumstances under which Alvarez might be returned to 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Salinas said Mexico is doing its share to combat the trafficking 
of illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"The street value of the 43 tons of pure cocaine that we have seized during the 
(last) 16 months . . . is equivalent to the total amount of our foreign debt," 
Salinas said. 
</P>
<P>
While the publishers politely applauded Salinas' remarks, the president and 
Cesar Chavez, head of the UFW, were showered with shouts of "Viva Mexico" and 
rhythmic handclapping from more than 100 local activists and UFW members as 
they took part in a ceremony extending the medical benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez said Salinas was the first Mexican president in nearly three decades to 
understand the UFW's desire to help families left behind by workers who come to 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"It has not been possible for the union to protect members' families in Mexico 
with the union's medical plan here," the labor leader said. "Our joint efforts 
began a creative type of binational pact which gives concrete expression to the 
solidarity and brotherhood of the Mexican people here and in Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
Chavez claimed that as many as 100,000 UFW members were covered by the 
agreement, under which the union would pay their health premiums to the Mexican 
Institute for Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
But not all Mexican politicians agreed with Chavez's assessment. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican opposition leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who was winding up a three-day 
visit to Los Angeles on Monday, told supporters in Chinatown that the agreement 
would have "little impact," saying as few as 15,000 agriculture workers might 
be covered by the pact. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just not enough," said Cardenas, who pointed out that as many as 2 
million Mexican workers -- illegally or otherwise -- are in California. 
</P>
<P>
Many of Cardenas' supporters in Los Angeles urged Chavez not to appear with 
Salinas, reiterating allegations that Salinas' party, known as PRI, stole the 
1988 presidential election from Cardenas, the son of a revered former 
president.

64 SCHOOLS ELECT TO GO YEAR-ROUND BY SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sixty-four schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District plan to switch to 
multi-track, year-round operation beginning this summer, and almost 40 more 
expect to move portable classrooms onto their playgrounds this fall to help 
relieve overcrowding in the district. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the schools are among 109 ordered by the school board in February to 
increase their capacity by 23% this year to accommodate exploding enrollment 
growth. The school plan was submitted to board members Monday and a vote is 
expected next week. 
</P>
<P>
The district already has 102 schools operating on multi-track year-round 
schedules, which allow a campus to accommodate up to one-third more pupils by 
dividing the student body into several groups that attend school on staggered 
schedules, with one group on vacation at all times. 
</P>
<P>
Still, schools in some areas are so crowded they are forced to send children to 
less crowded campuses up to an hour away. A record 25,000 students are being 
bused away from their neighborhood schools this year because of overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
The plans will create more than 20,000 classroom seats throughout the district 
this fall, allowing about 5,000 of the 17,500 elementary school students now 
being bused to return to their home campuses. 
</P>
<P>
But it is not clear whether the additional space will give the district much 
breathing room. More than 10,000 new elementary students are expected to enroll 
next fall, and similar increases are expected for the following few years. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether we're standing still or making progress has yet to be determined," 
said Roberta Weintraub, who represents the East San Fernando Valley, which will 
have a large proportion of the year-round schools. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next three years, the remainder of the district's 600 schools will 
have to find ways to increase space for students by 23%. Parents and staff at 
each school will be allowed to vote to select from among four options to create 
the needed space. 
</P>
<P>
The options include adding bungalow classrooms, putting two more children in 
each classroom, going multi-track year-round, or cooperating with nearby 
schools to transfer entire grade levels there. For instance, an elementary 
school could send sixth-graders to a neighboring junior high if space permits. 
</P>
<P>
Because of restrictions on the number of portable classrooms a school may use, 
many schools will have no choice but to go multi-track year-round -- as was the 
case with 61 of the 64 schools opting for year-round this year. 
</P>
<P>
It will cost the district almost $500,000 to finance conversion of the 64 
schools to year-round, not including additional operating and maintenance 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
The money will pay for such things as additional teacher and clerical time to 
organize students and teachers into separate groups or "tracks," and storage 
cabinets to hold materials for "roving" teachers who will have to change 
classrooms every few months. 
</P>
<P>
The district also will spend $12.2 million to purchase and install 123 portable 
classrooms at schools selecting that option, and about $45,000 to convert 
office space to classrooms at other schools. 
</P>
<P>
But district officials estimate they will save $7 million in transportation 
costs if 5,000 fewer students are bused next year. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, multi-track year-round schools in the district have received up to 
$150 additionally per student from the state as part of an incentive program to 
encourage districts to go year-round. 
</P>
<P>
But Gov. George Deukmejian has proposed changing the formula to give less money 
to large districts such as Los Angeles, and the state's independent legislative 
analyst recommended Monday that the state end the incentive program altogether, 
saying it costs too much and has had little effect on whether districts go 
year-round. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CHANGES TO INCREASE CAPACITY AT L.A. SCHOOLS 
</P>
<P>
 Under a school board mandate to increase capacity by 23%, 63 elementary 
schools and one junior high in the Los Angeles Unified School District will 
convert to multi-track, year-round operation this summer. Others schools have 
chosen to add portable classrooms, increase the size of classes, convert 
administrative space or reconfigure to create additional space.

SPORTS BAR IN HOLLYWOOD IS SHUT BY STATE AFTER SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State officials temporarily closed a Hollywood bar on Monday after a deadly 
shoot-out there Friday that renewed concerns that the popular Latino sports bar 
had become a magnet for crime and the state had done little to control it. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control announced it was shutting 
down the La Iguerita sports bar for 45 days because the club sold alcohol to 
intoxicated patrons on two occasions in January. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the shutdown was "purely coincidental" and unrelated to a brawl 
Friday night in which one man was killed and at least three others wounded, 
said Dan Toomey, ABC enforcement supervisor for the Los Angeles/Wilshire 
District. 
</P>
<P>
Toomey also said ABC officials had scheduled a meeting Thursday with the owners 
of the bar to discuss the revocation of their liquor license. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Ivar Hawks Neighborhood Watch group picketed outside the Yucca 
Street bar Monday, charging that the ABC had failed to do its job despite 
repeated requests that the bar be shut down. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tragic that (someone) had to die to get the ABC to act," said Hawks 
spokesman Joseph Shea. "Bloodshed and violence have been the history of this 
bar. Only a highly publicized death . . . moved the wheels of bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
No suspects have been identified in the shooting, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Shea said that his organization had lobbied the state for more than one year to 
close the bar but that officials were unresponsive. 
</P>
<P>
Bar manager Floyd Castaneda would not comment on the shutdown, but said 
problems in the neighborhood were not caused by patrons in the bar. The bar's 
two owners, identified in state documents as Cruz Antonio Guevara and Ramon 
Valenzuela, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Toomey said his agency would have acted sooner to close the bar but that the 
ABC "has its hands tied" by a legal system through which bar owners can drag 
out the closure process for more than three years while appealing their cases. 
Bars are permitted to stay open during appeal, pending decisions by 
administrative law judges. 
</P>
<P>
The ABC sought to get the bar's license revoked last November, but instead 
allowed it to stay open and on probation for three years with the stipulation 
that any violations could result in the revocation of its license. 
</P>
<P>
Although two such violations occurred in January, when the bar was alleged to 
have served alcohol to intoxicated patrons, no such action was taken, Toomey 
said. "We felt we didn't have a good enough case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The reason the ABC finally decided to seek a permanent shutdown of La Iguerita 
this week, Toomey said, was because of more violations uncovered by 
investigators during undercover visits to the bar in February. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation pending in Sacramento, he said, would allow ABC officials to shut 
down a bar through a court injunction rather than through the lengthy 
administrative hearing process. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had that bill, we would have been able to address this problem earlier," 
Toomey said. 
</P>
<P>
Toomey said his staff of 13 enforcers has to watch over 9,000 licensees within 
the district.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RUNOFF CANDIDATE SUES OPPONENT FOR $6 
MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Long Beach City Council candidate Jim Serles has filed a $6-million libel suit 
against opponent Doug Drummond, claiming Drummond defamed him with claims that 
Serles struck "back room deals" and "sold his vote" while he was chairman of 
the city's Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is campaign literature circulated by Drummond before the April 10 
election, which Serles was heavily favored to win. Drummond forced Serles into 
a June runoff. 
</P>
<P>
The literature depicted a newspaper clipping saying that Serles was under 
investigation by the state Fair Political Practices Commission, when no such 
article existed, the suit said. The literature also included a photo of Serles 
emblazoned with the words "For Sale."

THE AGING LAKERS; 
</P>
<P>
THEY HAVE BUILT FOR THE PRESENT, MAKING THEM ONE OF THE NBA'S OLDEST TEAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One day, the Lakers will awaken, look in the bathroom mirror and see that they 
have grown old. 
</P>
<P>
They will notice crow's feet, receding hairlines, expanded waistlines. Arteries 
will have hardened, muscle mass softened. Denture paste will stand next to the 
cologne on the sink top. 
</P>
<P>
That day, obviously, is not here yet. The Lakers remain their robust selves, 
heading into the first round of the playoffs against the Houston Rockets with 
the NBA's best record. Clearly, it is not time to put them on high-fiber diets, 
send them to Florida for the winter or explore hair-coloring endorsement 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
But, in their current alignment, the Lakers must soon face the sobering 
prospect of growing old together. They have seven players 30 or older, among 
them starters Magic Johnson and Mychal Thompson. James Worthy and Byron Scott 
are 29 and nursing chronic injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Even after the retirement of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar last season at 42, and the 
unexpected addition of 22-year-old Yugoslav center Vlade Divac, the Lakers 
still are among the league's oldest teams. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' average age is 29 years 4 months -- one year and four months 
younger than last season's team, which had Abdul-Jabbar. In the last 10 
seasons, the oldest team to have won an NBA championship was the 1987-88 
Lakers, with an average age of 29 years 1 month. But that Laker team had only 
four players 30 or older. No championship team in the '80s had more than four 
30-something players. 
</P>
<P>
If it is at all consoling to the Lakers, they are not alone among the 
successful aged. The Pistons, whose average age was 28 years 4 months when they 
won the title last season, now average 30 years 3 months and have six players 
30 or older. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers are not at all concerned about growing old and say they can win with 
their current group for three more seasons. That would be until the end of the 
1992-93 season, when Johnson says he will retire. 
</P>
<P>
So, the Laker thinking is win now and worry about rebuilding -- or even just 
staying reasonably young -- later. 
</P>
<P>
"(Laker owner) Jerry Buss is very comfortable with this team as it is, and he 
thinks it can win for several more years," said Jerry West, the Lakers' general 
manager. "I think (Buss) realizes it's a risky thing. But I don't think there's 
any question this team, right now, can win it." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Pat Riley was even more blunt. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, it's win now," Riley said. "It's all win now. We're not trying to win in 
1995. We want to win this year. We're going to put the best, most experienced 
team we can on the floor. Maybe (age) could be a problem. We got lucky with 
Vlade. He's young. A.C. (Green) is still young (26). But we definitely are a 
team that is seasoned." 
</P>
<P>
Riley, who prefers coaching veteran players, said the Lakers have deliberately 
sought experienced players to surround Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we'll have this much experience for the next two or three years," he 
said. "We've got to do everything we can do, while (Johnson) is still healthy 
and vital, to win championships. Because, when Earvin retires, it'll be very 
hard. We'll have to rebuild anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the '80s, however, the Lakers always took measures to avoid turning 
into doddering geezers in shorts and sneakers. They successfully combined youth 
and experience. The 1979-80 Laker championship team had an average age of 25 
years 8 months. Even the 1984-85 Lakers, said by many to be the developmental 
team of the '80s, averaged only 27 years 9 months. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers have such a rich history you would think it was West or Bill 
Sharman, not Branch Rickey, who said, "It's better to trade a player a year too 
early than a year too late." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers were able to build a solid talent base by using acquired draft 
choices to select Johnson and Worthy, as well as West's own eye for talent in 
selecting Green with the last pick in the first round in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
But the Lakers also consciously made moves to stay young. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, they traded shooting guard Norm Nixon, then 26 and seemingly still in 
his prime, to the Clippers for draft rights to Scott, then 22, and Swen Nater. 
Nixon's only physical problem then was tendinitis in his knees, but the Lakers 
liked Scott's youth and shooting ability. When the Lakers lost to the Celtics 
in the NBA finals that season, some criticized trading Nixon. No complaints 
have been heard since, though. 
</P>
<P>
After winning the championship in 1984-85, the Lakers waived Jamaal Wilkes, who 
had just turned 33, and chose not to offer Bob McAdoo, then 34, a new contract. 
Both had been key figures, but Wilkes was coming off a knee injury and McAdoo 
was expendable. 
</P>
<P>
And, after winning consecutive championships in 1987 and '88, the Lakers chose 
not to re-sign Kurt Rambis, who had turned 30. They had committed to Green, 
younger and stronger, by that time, and Rambis wanted more playing time. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the Lakers got a lot younger after last season. Abdul-Jabbar, at 
last, had retired and the Lakers drafted Divac in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
But then they chose not to re-sign Tony Campbell, 26, and signed Larry Drew, 
32, and, two months into the season, Jay Vincent, 30. In addition, Johnson, 
Orlando Woolridge and Mark McNamara all turned 30 within the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Initially unsure about Divac and convinced they needed another big man, the 
Lakers tried to trade first-round draft picks and McNamara to Minnesota for 
another over-30 player, Rick Mahorn, but were rebuffed. 
</P>
<P>
Outside forces may now prevent the Lakers from getting older. 
</P>
<P>
Burned in the past, teams are not so willing to trade with the Lakers anymore. 
Other owners, besides Buss, now are willing to pay extravagantly for free 
agents. Teams, too, are stockpiling draft choices instead of readily swapping 
them for talented, but aging, veterans. 
</P>
<P>
And the Lakers seem to have altered their philosophy. They no longer see 
anything wrong with keeping players well into their 30s. The Lakers ate 
$860,000 when they waived Wilkes, $922,000 when McAdoo left. They wanted new 
blood. 
</P>
<P>
Now, they have Thompson, 35, and Michael Cooper, 34, under contract for next 
season and say they have no intention of letting either go. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have the opportunities to do things, first off," West said. "Also, 
you have to be willing to take the risk. We know what we have for players now, 
and we're happy with it. "No question about it, we have to look to the future. 
We have to say to ourselves, 'What do we have to do to make over this team but 
still keep it attractive?' Jerry Buss knows we're (getting older), but you 
don't always get into a position to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
"We have explored a number of things before the draft to get younger -- and 
before the (Feb. 22) trading deadline -- but it's tough to get teams to deal 
with you. It's the price you pay for winning. If we can risk-take and not 
destroy the team we have now, we'll make a deal. Before (in the early '80s), we 
haven't had to give up anything to get a number of our players. That's 
changed." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' core players -- Johnson, Worthy and Scott -- say they like having 
veteran teammates. And, as might be expected, they are a tad sensitive about 
being called old. They prefer such euphemisms as mature, seasoned, even 
wizened. 
</P>
<P>
They no longer worry about building for the future because, well, they won't be 
a part of it. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to take advantage of this situation," Scott said. "We've got six or 
seven guys 30 and over, and myself and James are 29, so you try to be as good 
as you can while the going is good and while you have that team intact. We've 
got the team to win now. We want to win now." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson compares the Lakers to football's San Francisco 49ers, a talent-laden 
team that simply adds experienced accessories every season. 
</P>
<P>
"You can never worry about rebuilding," Johnson said. "What's that going to do 
for you? The philosophy is to win every year, right now. You add the players as 
you go on. 
</P>
<P>
"You want the experience and the hunger of guys that have played and haven't 
tasted it before. It's like the 49ers. They bring in a few veterans that 
haven't won. I think our franchises are the same. We look to win now and not 
worry about tomorrow. With the free-agency situation and the draft, you always 
have a chance to be young." 
</P>
<P>
But doesn't Johnson fear growing old together, as many say the Celtics have 
done? "It could be, but we're not an old team, like in the upper 30s," Johnson 
said. "We're a mature team. We still got a few more years. 
</P>
<P>
"When we started off, we were real young. But that doesn't help you win 
championships. You don't want to have a lot of guys that have never really been 
(through the pressure of a playoff), because you may have to count on guys that 
haven't gone through it. Now, we got Larry and Jay. They've been there. That's 
what's going to help you." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson and Cooper, the two Lakers in their mid 30s, stay in good condition 
and have yet to show serious decline in the quality of play. Thompson has been 
nagged by heel and knee injuries, but he had chronic injuries in his younger 
days. Cooper's shooting percentage has fallen off in recent seasons, but he 
still is a defensive demon against guards and small forwards. "Age is just a 
number, baby, ask George Burns," Thompson said. "I'm in my best physical 
condition since I came into the league. There's no doubt I'm getting old. (But) 
I take care of myself. I eat the right foods. I do my weightlifting. Get the 
proper rest. Coop may have his ginseng, but I'm taking these natural herbs and 
vitamins. I feel great." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper celebrated his 34th birthday two weeks ago and, unwilling to accept 
advancing age, refused to shake a well wisher's hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I may be old, age-wise," Cooper said, "but I feel in my 20s. I'm taking it a 
year at a time. I can play longer than next season. It depends on my ability to 
defend (against) smaller guys. The only thing I can't do as well as when I was 
younger is jump." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper weighs 177 pounds, one more than in 1978-79, his rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper laughed when it was suggested the Lakers are on their last legs. 
</P>
<P>
"They were saying that seven years ago, when we had Kareem, Jamaal and McAdoo," 
Cooper said. "It's happening again. But it's not to the point where we are old. 
Thirty is not old." 
</P>
<P>
Worthy and Scott will not reach 30 until next season, but both could be 
classified as well seasoned. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy left North Carolina after his junior season and has played in the NBA 
eight seasons. Except for a broken leg late in his rookie season, 1982-83, he 
has had no debilitating injuries. He has, however, been bothered by chronic 
tendinitis in his knees. And this season alone, he has had a sore foot, sore 
shoulder, back spasms and a periodic flare-ups in his knees. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, he missed only two games and has been as productive as ever. 
</P>
<P>
But Riley wonders whether the beating Worthy routinely takes in the low post 
will ultimately slow him. 
</P>
<P>
"James is a warrior," Riley said. "He plays hard, takes a beating every night. 
There's a point of diminishing return where he might lose something. 
</P>
<P>
"He's like a great running back. He reminds me of the Eric Dickersons and 
Walter Paytons and Jim Browns. He's taking a lot of banging. He's getting 
banged by screeners, getting banged by defensive men. He's got to fight and 
fend before he gets the ball. Then, when he gets the ball, he's got to fight 
and fend some more. I think that takes its toll." 
</P>
<P>
Worthy says he does not consider himself an old 29. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I'm a young 29," Worthy said. "I don't have anything that any other player 
is not suffering. Everybody has nagging injury. That's just the way it's 
evolved over the years. You have to go through a lot of barriers and banging to 
get the balls. A lot of times I don't get bumped at all. So, I'm a young 29. 
I'm definitely a young 29." 
</P>
<P>
Scott, the Lakers' other 29-year-old, has been unable to fully recover from a 
torn left hamstring that kept him out of the NBA finals last season. 
</P>
<P>
And now he's hobbled by a sprained left ankle, but that is not expected to 
prevent his playing Friday. 
</P>
<P>
As for the hamstring, Scott said, "I don't think it'll slow me down much now 
(in games). But it might end (my career) a year or two sooner than expected. 
I'm not going to worry about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to leave this game and 10 years from now be crippled, you know. 
But, right now, (the hamstring) seems like it's getting back to this plateau of 
being stronger. You don't want to think the worst, but you have to keep your 
career in perspective." 
</P>
<P>
Said Riley of Scott: "It doesn't mean he should be less productive. He might 
not be as spectacular. He may not elevate as much, but you can always make up 
for a loss of physical skills with wisdom, experience. I think Byron is there 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson seems as strong now as when he was 22. Now, though, he has experience 
and leadership qualities he did not have then. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's just say Earvin is getting his second wind at 30," Riley said. "He's 
talking about quitting in three years. I don't think it has much to do with 
money. But if he's playing like he is now three or four years from now -- and I 
don't think there's any reason why he can't -- he can still play like this. I 
think Kareem's 20 years has changed the mind set about longevity in the 
league." 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar's unprecedented 20 NBA seasons also might have changed Riley's 
handling of, ahem, mature players. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar often sat out practice in his last few seasons, especially on days 
after games. Riley has extended that policy this season to Johnson and Worthy. 
Also, there was a three-month stretch earlier in the season when Thompson 
seldom practiced, and Scott periodically sits to rest his hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to walk around on egg shells," Riley said. "We've got guys who 
are hurt -- not injured, just playing hurt. They aren't incapacitated. I think 
I've been very conscious of our older guys and key guys. Earvin and James never 
practice the day after a game anymore. Never. Our practices are always very 
light the day after a game." 
</P>
<P>
As much a preservationist as coach, perhaps, Riley said he realizes that 
someday -- sooner probably than later -- the Lakers will simply be too old and 
will have to rebuild. "We'll keep looking for young players, and maybe getting 
rid of Tony Campbell was a mistake," Riley said. "But we will continue to find 
players with experience, veterans who know how to win, to go with Earvin and 
James. As long as (Johnson and Worthy) are in their early 30s, we're not in a 
rebuilding process yet." 
</P>
<P>
Riley is justifiably proud of the Lakers' staying power. 
</P>
<P>
"This team has spanned all our contenders," Riley said. "What I mean is, you 
play against the Dr. J's, the Birds -- all these teams with great guys -- and 
then their championship years have gone and they've rebuilt. Now, we're almost 
at the point where that new team the franchises have will grow old and be gone. 
</P>
<P>
"For instance, if Magic goes another three of four more years, the Stocktons 
and Karl Malones will have been around eight or nine years and you have spanned 
the entire development of that (Utah Jazz) franchise. I think that's the 
uniqueness of this (Laker) team." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the Lakers acknowledge that, eventually, their dominance will end. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we can win for another two or three years," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Thompson: "We're all going out when Magic goes out. So, we've got three 
years to live. The mirror doesn't lie, baby."

JIM MURRAY: ENJOYING THE VIEW FROM THE FRONT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I've finally figured out what they're going to put on my epitaph. Are you ready 
for this? 
</P>
<P>
"He Led the Long Beach Grand Prix for a Lap and a Half." 
</P>
<P>
You heard me. I was in front of the pole sitter and all 25 drivers in that 
sucker. I had an Unser, an Andretti, Fittipaldi eating my dust. I had Johnny 
Rutherford shaking his fist at me. 
</P>
<P>
Lots of guys have led the Long Beach Grand Prix at the start. But how many of 
them did it riding backward? I expect the Guinness Book of World Records to be 
calling any minute. 
</P>
<P>
Look! I never hit a Koufax fastball, hit a Raider line, served to Rod Laver or 
aimed a punch at Muhammad Ali. But I kept Danny Sullivan in my rear-view 
mirror, I went into the corners ahead of Rick Mears, I kept A.J. Foyt in my 
slipstream. 
</P>
<P>
Was it a dream? No, not exactly. 
</P>
<P>
What it was, I have to tell you, was, I was in the PPG pace car. Well, pace 
truck would be more like it. I sat in the back facing the field. Patty Moise 
was the driver. Patty Moise, in case you never heard of her, is the driver who 
holds the woman's world speed record of 217.498 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
We didn't go quite that fast Sunday but, as I looked back, there was young 
Unser, Emmo, Sully, all those legends dialing in their tires with zigzag 
movements so you had to ask yourself, how many guys in racing history could 
look back and see drivers like that slipping and sliding around the race track 
and not gaining an inch? 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure Patty hankers to lead that bunch in a Lola-Cosworth or its equivalent 
someday, the way she streaked down the straights and slammed into the corners. 
We periodically lost Johnny Rutherford, another pace car driver, in the corners 
and John has won, count 'em, three Indy 500s. It was the fastest I've gone at 
sea level since Eddie Sachs took me around the Indy Speedway back in the '60s. 
That was my last white knuckler because Patty, unlike Eddie, did not talk with 
her hands all the way around the track. Eddie only grabbed the wheel as sparks 
were flying off the hubcaps. 
</P>
<P>
It's a great way to see the Long Beach Grand Prix, even though the tall 
buildings seemed to be wheeling through the air as we slammed into the corners 
or went shrieking down Shoreline Drive, Long Beach's equivalent of the Mulsanne 
Straight. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach Grand Prix is less a sporting event than an institution. It is 
perfectly astonishing the way it has worked its way into the fabric of the 
Southern California sports scene. I wasn't around to see the formation of the 
Rose Bowl and Parade or the early SC Trojan and Coliseum events. But I was on 
hand at the genesis of the LBGP. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't give it a chance. 
</P>
<P>
I had noted in print in my free-swinging, take-no-prisoners days of sports 
columning that Long Beach was a community sinking several inches a year under 
the skeletal work of its infrastructure and slant-drilling oil wells and the 
only reason to go to Long Beach was to see if it was still there. 
</P>
<P>
Then it became the permanent home of an ocean liner that would never sail and a 
cargo plane that would never fly. 
</P>
<P>
I, and thousands like me, thought the LBGP would never fly, either. 
</P>
<P>
You have to remember 40 miles to the east a gaudy, flossy, state-of-the-art 
race track in Ontario was busy going broke at the time and millions had been 
sunk into making it the Taj Mahal of auto racing. 
</P>
<P>
So, how could a bunch of cars tooling around the streets of Long Beach at 90 
m.p.h. be deemed a tourist attraction in a community that had traffic like any 
midnight on the Pomona freeway? If it was auto crashes you craved, you could 
get your fill on Mulholland Drive at no charge. The downtown interchange was a 
permanent Grand Prix. You didn't need to import cars or drivers. You had the 
added excitement of not knowing which in the field were sober. 
</P>
<P>
There have been some great winners at Long Beach. Clay Regazzoni, Niki Lauda, 
Nelson Piquet in its Formula One phase. Mario Andretti, four times. Now, young 
Al Unser, three. 
</P>
<P>
But the big winner at Long Beach has been a guy who never got a checkered flag 
in his life and never drives in anything that doesn't have a stereo, car phone 
and back-seat bar in it. 
</P>
<P>
The first time I saw Christopher Pook, he was this curious freebooter who had 
this English accent, where they say "chube" for the subway and what was 
required of one was a "jooty," and he had this perfectly outlandish idea of 
running race cars through the streets of Long Beach. "Long Beach is just where 
they drop off the imported cars and off-load the oil," he was told. "No one 
goes there." 
</P>
<P>
Well, Pook, who had dabbled in race driving in Europe till he found he was 
never going to be another Stirling Moss, bargained for his road course in 
downtown Long Beach anyway and brought in the Continental sporty-type set, 
monocles and all, to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
None of them had ever been east of the Beverly Hills Hotel before and they 
thought L.A. was a series of sound stages surrounded by Indians. Long Beach 
never had so many diamond tiaras in its history before. Prior to that, its most 
exciting event had been the annual Iowa picnic. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Formula One cars were supposed to race through the streets of Monte 
Carlo before ex-crowned heads of Europe driven by guys trailing white scarfs 
and World War I goggles and not through the streets of Long Beach in front of a 
whole bunch of retired people or under the noses of the oil scows and the 
horses-head oil wells nodding in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
But, Long Beach had lost Disneyland to Anaheim and Marineland to Palos Verdes 
and was in the mood to try something devilish. Pook was able to enlist the 
community into a Committee of 300, an invaluable cadre of volunteer workers who 
comprised the intellectual and social elite of the area. 
</P>
<P>
"We borrowed the idea from the Tournament of Roses," admits Pook. "We were not 
terribly inventive." 
</P>
<P>
Nor terribly successful. At first. The checks didn't exactly bounce. But 
sometimes the money was coming in the back door as the checks arrived at the 
front. 
</P>
<P>
It took some time for the suspicious natives to realize that Pook was really a 
patriotic Long Beacher and not in cahoots with the international racing 
federation, which claimed some 40% of almost all the proceeds from the event 
for the use of its drivers and "Grand Prix" label. 
</P>
<P>
"You listened to Chris Pook for a while and you knew where England got that 
empire," one journalist was to observe. 
</P>
<P>
Pook eventually came to the conclusion he didn't need the European sporty car 
set to put his race over and, in 1984, he switched to CART Indy cars and 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach proved to prefer them to the race car royalty. Attendance dipped the 
first year, from 75,000 to 56,000, but shot back up within three years to 
85,000. Over this last weekend, 195,000 attended the races and festivities for 
the three days of the fete. Pook estimates the Grand Prix brings $50 to $100 
million in business to the harbor city. 
</P>
<P>
Other North American cities have borrowed the Long Beach idea and have street 
races of their own -- Detroit, Cleveland, Denver, and Vancouver. Pook's company 
has a new 10-year agreement with Long Beach. It's an American fixture, like the 
Boston Marathon, New Orleans Mardi Gras, the Masters or the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Little Al Unser won it Sunday, if you're into trivia. But, of course, I was off 
the track by then.

RELIEVER HOWELL UNDERGOES KNEE SURGERY; 
</P>
<P>
DODGERS: TORN CARTILAGE WILL SIDELINE THE BULLPEN ACE FOR AT LEAST THREE WEEKS. 
DODGERS OPEN SERIES WITH THE CARDINALS TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Dodgers bullpen lost its heart and saves Monday with the announcement that 
relief pitcher Jay Howell will miss at least three weeks because of 
arthroscopic knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Howell, who recorded 78% of the team's saves last season with a club-record 28, 
was diagnosed as having a partial tear in cartilage in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
He will undergo surgery this morning and has been placed on the 21-day disabled 
list, although he could be out longer. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't be surprised to see him pitch within a month," said Dr. Frank Jobe, 
Dodger medical director. "It's not a real bad problem. It's not the whole 
cartilage, just a little tear. We can cut it back and he can come back and not 
even know anything had ever happen." 
</P>
<P>
Tennis star Ivan Lendl had similar surgery and was back on the court within 
three weeks, according to Jobe. 
</P>
<P>
However, the injury is serious for a pitcher because of the use of the legs in 
delivering the pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Howell, who said the knee had been bothering him late last season, was given a 
cortisone shot in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
But the knee did not respond. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday morning, the team's first off day this season, he underwent a 
Magnetic Resonancy Imaging exam that revealed the tear. 
</P>
<P>
"The knee does not affect me pitching-wise," Howell said Sunday afternoon 
before the exam, even though he had allowed two runs in the ninth inning that 
cost the Dodgers a lead and thegame Saturday night against Houston. 
</P>
<P>
"But it hurts all the time, and I can't do any conditioning exercises," Howell 
added. "It's been bothering me long enough (to) where I want to get it fixed." 
</P>
<P>
According to the Dodgers, Howell was unavailable for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
He is 1-1 with a 4.50 ERA in three appearances this season after missing the 
first week with shoulder stiffness. 
</P>
<P>
To replace Howell, the Dodgers will recall a player to be announced today from 
triple-A Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
He may not be a pitcher. The Dodgers already have 11 pitchers due to rosters 
being expanded to 27 players because of the spring training lockout. A better 
guess might be middle infielder Jose Vizcaino. 
</P>
<P>
Howell's loss leaves the bullpen, which has already contributed to half of the 
team's six losses, with the following: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two rookies, Mike Munoz and Mike Hartley, who have yet to record a 
big-league save. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Three veterans, Tim Crews, Ray Searage and Don Aase, who entered this year 
with a combined three saves in the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One starting pitcher, John Wetteland, who has one career save and a 12.46 
ERA in four games this season. 
</P>
<P>
Which will take Howell's place? The Dodgers don't know any more than you. 
</P>
<P>
The answer could be Jim Gott. 
</P>
<P>
"Gott's role could be a significant one," said Fred Claire, Dodger executive 
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Gott's surgically repaired right elbow is nearly ready to allow him to join the 
active roster. 
</P>
<P>
He will pitch his third simulated game either Wednesday or Thursday, and if he 
is ready he likely will be sent to Class-A Bakersfield team for one or two 
relief appearances. 
</P>
<P>
That process could cover the next 10 days, during which the Dodgers will 
probably attempt to work the hard-throwing Wetteland into the stopper role, 
with help from Aase, who has one save this year. 
</P>
<P>
After about 10 days, sources say, the Dodgers will examine Howell's recovery 
and Gott's rehabilitation and determine their next move. 
</P>
<P>
Only as a last resort will that move involve trading for a front-line relief 
pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be looking, but a closer is not easy to find, and market price is high," 
Claire said. "I don't know if you can find more capable people than somebody 
like Jim Gott, if he is healthy. Gott could make a very timely contribution." 
</P>
<P>
Another club source put it differently. 
</P>
<P>
"If we tried to get a stopper now, everyone would put a gun to our head. They 
would all ask for Ramon Martinez and John Wetteland and (minor league 
shortstop) Jose Offerman," said the source. "If this had happened in late 
August and we were in a pennant race, it might be worth it. But right now, we 
have time to let the smoke clear." 
</P>
<P>
It's not a pretty picture for Howell, who at age 34 already has suffered 
through elbow surgery and tendinitis in his forearm and, most recently, a stiff 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, the surgery will cut down on the Dodgers' frequent use of 
Howell, who, because of his effectiveness, appeared in 56 games last season -- 
most since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the causes of this is age," Jobe said. "As you get older, the cartilage 
gets more brittle. The more you push down on the knee, the more likely it is 
that something will get affected." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Lasorda, Dodger manager, also was unavailable for comment.

TITLE GOES TO BANKE THIS TIME; 
</P>
<P>
BOXING: HE STOPS ZARAGOZA IN THE NINTH ROUND TO TAKE THE WBC SUPER-BANTAMWEIGHT 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Banke, the little rock-fisted fighter from Quail Valley, has been called a 
crowd-pleaser, a brawler and a slugger. Now, call him a champion. 
</P>
<P>
That's what he became at the Forum Monday night, when, behind on points, he 
stopped Mexico's Daniel Zaragoza in the ninth round and earned the World Boxing 
Council super-bantamweight championship. 
</P>
<P>
Banke (19-4), 26, began the ninth trailing substantially on all three judges' 
cards, 78-75, 78-74 and 79-73. After he decked Zaragoza twice in that round, 
the champion rose both times. But when Zaragoza climbed shakily off the mat the 
second time, referee John Thomas waved him off and Banke leaped into the arms 
of his cornermen. 
</P>
<P>
It was a rousing battle, one that had both men near exhaustion after six rounds 
in a rematch of their exciting fight last June, when Zaragoza won a split 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
This was the sixth time that Zaragoza (39-5-1), 29, was defending his 
championship. Both fighters weighed the super-bantam limit, 122 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
And this time, Banke was not to be denied. Last time, he clowned, mugged and 
made faces at the champion and frittered away the early rounds. This time, it 
seemed, he won it on heart. And why not? He fights for Bob Richardson's All 
Heart Boxing Club of Quail Valley, in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
These two put a fight-of-the year candidate on the boards. They had the crowd 
of 5,937 on its feet, cheering throughout. Time after time, Banke seemed ready 
to take out the weakening champion, who bled throughout from numerous facial 
cuts. But each time Banke seemed to have Zaragoza ready to go, usually on the 
ropes, Zaragoza not only countered his way out of trouble, he often rocked 
Banke back on his heels. 
</P>
<P>
Zaragoza's manager thought his fighter got caught in Banke's game, trading 
bombs all too frequently rather than moving and showing his craftsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
"He fought with his heart, not with his head," manager Rafael Mendoza said. 
</P>
<P>
Banke paid tribute Zaragoza. 
</P>
<P>
"He was tougher than the last time," Banke said. "But tonight I was more 
relaxed. I concentrated (after the first knockdown) on keeping pressure on him, 
on not letting him off the hook, like I did the last time. He's a great 
fighter, he was throwing bombs from left field and landing them." 
</P>
<P>
Banke, who earned $15,000 to Zaragoza's $50,000, inherits a mandatory title 
defense against South Korean slugger Moon Sung-Kil, in June. Forum matchmaker 
Tony Curtis has a 10 a.m. meeting today with Moon's promoter, trying to place a 
June 18 Banke-Moon fight in the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
But win or lose against Moon, it's a good bet that Curtis will want to put 
together a Banke-Zaragoza rubber match. 
</P>
<P>
On the undercard, ex-WBC super-flyweight champion Gilberto Roman beat Mike 
Phelps on nine-round technical decision, after Roman suffered a deep eye cut 
when butted by Phelps.

NEWSWIRE: FRATELLO RESIGNS AS HAWK COACH AFTER FAILING TO MAKE PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Fratello resigned Monday as coach of the Atlanta Hawks after the team 
failed to qualify for the NBA playoffs for the first time in five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking at the situation, and to be honest to myself, I feel comfortable in 
saying that for the best interests of the Atlanta Hawks and in my best 
interests, it's probably best for both of us if we part ways at this time," 
Fratello said at a news conference with Hawk President Stan Kasten and General 
Manager Pete Babcock. 
</P>
<P>
Fratello, in the last year of a four-year contract, was under pressure as the 
Hawks, plagued by injuries and internal bickering, played sub-.500 basketball 
most of the season. 
</P>
<P>
He had a record of 323-251 with the Hawks and was the second-winningest coach 
in Atlanta history. Only Richie Guerin outranks him, with 327 victories. 
</P>
<P>
There had been speculation that Fratello would be fired, but Kasten said the 
departure was Fratello's decision. He said no decision has been made about a 
new coach.

The Boston Celtics announced they will not add guard Brian Shaw to their roster 
for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics, who open a best-of-five series with the New York Knicks Thursday 
at the Boston Garden, had until Monday to decide whether to add Shaw, who 
jumped from the NBA just before training camp to play for Il Messaggero Roma of 
the Italian League. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics announced Feb. 27 that they had reached agreement with the 6-foot-6 
guard on a multiyear contract beginning next season. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw, of UC Santa Barbara and the Celtics' top 1988 draft pick, averaged 8.6 
points in his rookie season. In Italy, he and former Duke forward Danny Ferry 
are teammates.

PROTESTS HIT WALL STREET; HUNDREDS ARE ARRESTED; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: DEMONSTRATORS ALSO GATHER IN SAN FRANCISCO, COMPLAINING THAT 
CORPORATIONS CO-OPTED EARTH DAY.

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 250 people were arrested Monday during environmental protests on Wall 
Street and in the financial district of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
At least 11 people, including seven police officers, received minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of demonstrators converged on the New York Stock Exchange and the 
Pacific Stock Exchange chanting slogans such as "Wall Street kills," and 
complaining that corporations had turned Earth Day into a marketing tool 
without doing enough to protect the environment. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations were organized by a nationwide coalition of environmental 
organizations, including Earth First!, the Clamshell Alliance and the Youth 
Greens. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, police at the Pacific Stock Exchange were pelted with rocks, 
eggs, golf balls and sharpened pieces of metal, San Francisco Police spokesman 
David Ambrose said. 
</P>
<P>
A scuffle ensued when police tried to make arrests. The windshield of a police 
car was broken and several people were arrested on charges of assaulting a 
police officer. The protesters then marched through the financial district, 
smashing windows at the Bank of America and turning over several news racks. 
</P>
<P>
The New York protest sparked no major violence, although some protesters 
overturned trash bins. A spokesman for Earth Day Wall Street Action said one 
protester's arm was broken, although this could not be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the number of protesters, which reached at least 700 in New York and 
500 in San Francisco, securities trading was not affected. Groups in both 
cities had vowed to close the financial centers. 
</P>
<P>
"Except for arriving at work at little early, it was a normal day inside the 
building," said Richard S. Torrenzano, senior vice president of the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Hawkins, a member of Clamshell Alliance and the Left Green Network, said 
the protests were meant to counter what he called the corporate co-opting of 
Earth Day, the worldwide environmental celebration held on Sunday. Many 
corporations helped sponsor events. 
</P>
<P>
"What (corporations) are doing is using the environmental (movement) as a 
marketing tool," Hawkins said. "Earth Day missed the boat. The system has got 
to be changed fundamentally." 
</P>
<P>
"Any improvements (corporations have) made, they've been dragged kicking and 
screaming," said Stephen Dunifer, an organizer for Earth Day Action Coalition 
in San Francisco. "They assume we have infinite resources and we can expand the 
economy infinitely without regard for the Earth's limits." 
</P>
<P>
The protesters said financial institutions share the blame for doing business 
with corporate polluters. "Wall Street is the symbolic center for an economy 
based on limitless greed and speculation," declared a protest pamphlet here. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, 49 demonstrators were arrested and two police officers were 
treated for minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Nine minor injuries, including five to police officers, were reported in New 
York. Up to 500 police officers on foot, horseback and motorcycle arrested 204 
demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations took on a carnival atmosphere at times as some protesters 
marched in costumes: a clown, Moses, bears and "mutants" covered with toxic 
waste or aerosol cans. Walking through the concrete canyons of the Wall Street 
district, they chanted "corporate greed has to go," "people over profits" and 
"Wall Street kills." 
</P>
<P>
Both actions began at about 6:30 a.m. in their respective time zones. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, the protest kicked off with about 100 people trying to block 
entrance to the Pacific Stock Exchange. The confrontation turned to violence 
when some people started throwing objects at police after refusing to disperse. 
</P>
<P>
Several people were arrested after they allegedly tried to prevent police from 
making arrests and then attempted to free a demonstrator from the police, 
police spokesman Ambrose said. 
</P>
<P>
Dunifer and other organizers criticized the use of violence by some protesters. 
The crowd rallied peacefully at Justin Herman Plaza, Ambrose said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the New York arrests occurred in the morning when protesters staged 
several sit-ins. Others were taken into custody for blocking traffic on 
Broadway and Wall Street after a noon rally on the steps of the Federal Hall 
National Memorial. The demonstration ended by about 4 p.m.

TRUSTEE SAYS BUYERS ARE INTERESTED IN EASTERN; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: MARTIN SHUGRUE FIRES THE CARRIER'S CHIEF LABOR NEGOTIATOR, EXTENDING 
AN OLIVE BRANCH TO UNIONS.

<P>
The trustee appointed last week by a bankruptcy court judge to take charge of 
troubled Eastern Airlines said Monday that there have been "expressions of 
interest from a number of parties" about buying the airline. 
</P>
<P>
Martin R. Shugrue Jr. vowed that Eastern will not be cut up and disposed of in 
pieces but did not rule out a sale of the airline as a whole. "This trustee is 
not a liquidator," he added forcefully. "I came here to stem the financial 
losses and make Eastern economically viable." 
</P>
<P>
But he conceded that the airline's financial situation will have to be 
radically improved before any serious offers can be expected. He declined to 
identify any of those who have "shown interest in this enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
Shugrue, in his first public appearance since his appointment by U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court Judge Burton R. Lifland in New York last Wednesday night, also 
struck a conciliatory note toward Eastern's labor unions. He said a dialogue 
must be established immediately with the machinists, who have been on strike 
for more than a year and whose walkout triggered the airline's bankruptcy 
filing. He said preliminary talks have already taken place. 
</P>
<P>
He said there has been "a lot of blood spilled" in Eastern's dealings with 
labor and urged that any talks with the unions be conducted "on a less 
hysterical plane." 
</P>
<P>
"My immediate agenda calls for toning down the noise and rhetoric which have 
undermined the confidence of our passengers and shippers," he said. "We need a 
period of normalcy during which Eastern can stay off the front pages and 
evening newscasts. I'd certainly like to harmonize labor relations." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly extending an olive branch to the unions, Shugrue said one of his first 
official acts had been to fire Thomas Matthews, Eastern's senior vice president 
for human resources and the airline's chief labor negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
But Shugrue also vowed that Eastern would not become a patsy to the unions. 
"Talking with the unions by no means implies a simple caving-in to their 
demands," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said there is no "artificially imposed deadline from the judge or the 
creditors' committee" on a timetable for a turnaround, the filing of a new 
reorganization plan or the airline's emergence from bankruptcy. In answer to a 
question, he said the size of his compensation as trustee had not yet been 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
The trustee was once vice chairman of Pan Am Corp. and is a former president of 
Continental Airlines, which, along with Eastern, is owned by Texas Air Corp. of 
Houston. He appeared confident during the 45-minute news conference at 
Eastern's Miami headquarters that he will be able to bring the airline back to 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe Eastern can achieve a financial turnaround," he said. "I believe 
Eastern has basic strengths which can be revitalized. I believe Eastern can be 
a profitable airline." 
</P>
<P>
The 49-year-old former naval aviator said his "immediate priorities are to 
increase revenues and re-establish consumer confidence." He added that the 
airline will soon initiate an aggressive marketing campaign designed to lure 
business travelers. At the same time, he said, the airline would not abandon 
its discount fares for leisure travel.

SACHS TO QUIT COLUMBIA S&amp;L; INVOLVED IN PROBE OF MILKEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A top Columbia Savings executive who had been granted immunity from prosecution 
in exchange for his cooperation in the government's investigation of former 
Drexel Burnham Lambert junk-bond chief Michael Milken is resigning. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation of David A. Sachs, 30, as chief financial officer of the 
troubled Beverly Hills thrift is effective May 11. Sachs held the post only 
three months after the thrift's previous chief financial officer left. His 
principal job at Columbia has been executive vice president of investment 
management, including the thrift's huge portfolio of risky, high-yield junk 
bonds, now valued at about $3.38 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation came a day before Milken is expected to plead guilty in New 
York to six felonies and agree to pay $600 million in penalties, but the timing 
of the resignation is coincidental, sources said. Milken's decision to plead 
guilty came last Friday as prosecutors were threatening to file expanded 
charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Columbia nor any of its executives were expected to be named in the 
expanded Milken indictment. But prosecutors were expected to allege that Milken 
helped arrange tax law violations by Columbia. No charges have been filed 
against Columbia or any of its executives. 
</P>
<P>
Sachs, through a Columbia lawyer, declined comment, but his resignation is no 
surprise, although it did come sooner than expected. Columbia was effectively 
forced out of the junk bond business by last year's federal thrift legislation. 
And the plunge in junk bond prices the past few months rendered it insolvent, 
putting it in danger of being seized by regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia said Sachs is leaving for other unspecified business opportunities. He 
is the fourth top Columbia executive to resign since last fall. The other three 
are former Columbia President Lawrence K. Fish, former Chief Financial Officer 
James A. D'Aquila and Thomas Spiegel, the thrift's former chief executive and 
architect of Columbia's venture into junk bonds in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Edward G. Harshfield, Columbia's new chief executive, will serve as acting 
chief financial officer until a successor for Sachs is found. JAMES BATES

Firestone Extends Truck Tire Recall: Firestone extended its recall of tubeless 
over-the-road truck tires announced earlier this year by an additional 89,500 
units to include all tubeless tires produced between mid-1987 and late 1989 in 
Bilbao, Spain, and imported into the United States. Firestone had announced an 
earlier recall of 86,000 of these tires on Jan. 4. The tires being recalled 
bear a serial number beginning with "VT" and ending in digits ranging from 
"277" through "439."

Santa Fe Will Lay Off 850: Santa Fe Railway said it plans to lay off about 850 
people by May 15 because of a slump in business. 
</P>
<P>
About 125 jobs will be eliminated at a locomotive repair shop in San 
Bernardino, the company said. In all, 439 people are employed at that facility. 
The layoffs, which include about 100 management positions, are similar to 
seasonal job cuts in previous years, but "are deeper," the company said.

Court Backs State in Mission Case: The California Supreme Court ordered an 
appellate court to review its decision blocking collection by the state of 
about $300 million. The case involves reinsurance payments that the Department 
of Insurance maintains are owed to defunct Mission Insurance Cos., a former 
writer of workers compensation insurance. The money is due, said Insurance 
Commissioner Roxani M. Gillespie, from reinsurance companies that shared in 
insurance premiums collected by L.A.-based Mission in exchange for sharing the 
potential risk.

MAXICARE TO DISCUSS BUYOUT PROPOSAL WITH PACIFICARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Managers of Maxicare Health Plans have agreed to meet today with officials of 
PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. to hear more about PacifiCare's plan to make a 
bid for the Los Angeles-based health maintenance organization, which is 
currently operating under federal Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting is to "explore their intentions," Maxicare attorney Peter J. 
Wolfson said Monday during a U.S. Bankruptcy Court hearing in Santa Ana on 
Maxicare's disclosure statement and plan of reorganization to emerge from 
Chapter 11. Although the company agreed to talk to PacifiCare, it doesn't 
intend to let that delay Maxicare's plan to emerge from Chapter 11 as soon as 
possible, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare believes that it is essential that the bankruptcy proceedings be 
concluded at least by June 25, Wolfson said. Maxicare, which has lost 
substantial membership since its March, 1989, bankruptcy court filing, is 
seeking to be out of bankruptcy court before the next period when major 
employers choose the health plans they will offer to employees. 
</P>
<P>
In a surprise move last week, Cypress-based PacifiCare said it would make a bid 
to acquire Maxicare -- a move that would boost PacifiCare's membership by about 
50% -- but disclosed no details of a proposed buyout. Maxicare officials said 
the company is not for sale and the announcement came just days before a 
critical phase of the bankruptcy proceedings was to begin. 
</P>
<P>
In a packed courtroom Monday, U.S. District Court Judge John J. Wilson began to 
hear objections to Maxicare's amended plan filed with the court. The hearing 
will continue on May 7. 
</P>
<P>
On an issue that has plagued Maxicare since its bankruptcy filing, Wolfson said 
the company has agreed to settle with providers who are successful in getting 
relief from the court injunction that currently prevents the providers from 
directly billing Maxicare members for services provided.

Sweaters made of man-made fibers in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan, 
representing more than a third of the U.S. market, are being sold at less than 
their fair market value, the Commerce Department said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The National Knitwear &amp; Sportswear Assn. had filed complaints against the 
sweater manufacturers last September. 
</P>
<P>
It said that the imports, made predominantly of acrylic fiber, represent 72% of 
the $1.3-billion U.S. market and that the three countries represent 55% of the 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said the value of the sweaters imported from Hong Kong 
in 1989 was $208.8 million; from South Korea, $476.1 million, and from Taiwan, 
$485.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The department's finding was preliminary. A final determination is due by July 
5, it said.

Chaotic street battles pitting supporters of Nepal's ousted hard-line regime 
against police and bands of vigilantes left at least 18 people dead and 
prompted orders for army troops to kill violators of an all-night curfew. Prime 
Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai and King Birendra discussed the situation, 
but their talks were inconclusive, government sources said. Pro-democracy 
protests, in which at least 100 people were killed, brought a government of 
liberals, Communists and human rights activists to office late last week.

YOUTH GANGS OF CENTRAL AMERICANS IN L.A. ON RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Upheaval in Central America is transplanting itself in the barrios of Los 
Angeles, where the influx of refugees into some of the city's most troubled 
neighborhoods has led to the rise of a new generation of youth gangs, 
authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
Gangs of young men with roots in El Salvador, Guatemala and other Central 
American nations make up about 5% of the city's estimated 300 youth gangs, Los 
Angeles police say. But the influence of these Central American gangs is 
growing as they carve out niches in the San Fernando Valley and in the inner 
city, according to police and other gang experts. 
</P>
<P>
Mara Salvatrucha, a Salvadoran gang that came into existence only six years 
ago, has grown to 500 members, making it as large as entrenched 
Mexican-American gangs, authorities say. Members of Mara Salvatrucha and Crazy 
Riders, another gang with largely Central American membership, have been linked 
by police -- either as victims or suspects -- to five murders. Authorities say, 
however, they suspect that the gangs are involved in many other killings. 
</P>
<P>
"They're on the increase, and they're making a name for themselves," Detective 
Robert Contreras, of the Los Angeles Police Department's Gang Information 
Section, said of the city's Central American gangs. 
</P>
<P>
The proliferation of Central American gangs is especially troubling because 
members have a greater tendency to react with violence, police say. Authorities 
attribute this to the horrors that many Central Americans have witnessed back 
home, such as seeing family members executed by Salvadoran death squads. 
</P>
<P>
"In their countries, they're used to bombs and decapitated bodies," said Manuel 
Velasquez, a spokesman for the city's Community Youth Gang Services agency in 
the San Fernando Valley. "They laugh at drive-by shootings." 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested two alleged members of the Crazy Riders on Nov. 10 in 
connection with the drive-by shooting in Van Nuys of Walter Adama, 17, killed 
while standing in front of his home on Fulton Avenue. Police also suspect these 
gangs of involvement in a rash of car thefts several months ago in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The Crazy Riders also was implicated in a major turf battle with another Latino 
gang near MacArthur Park, in which two people were killed and six were injured. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very concerned because they don't hesitate to exert influence on other 
gangs," said Detective Cliff Ruff of the Police Department's Foothill Division 
in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, hard times and war have brought as many as 500,000 refugees to 
the Los Angeles area from Guatemala and El Salvador alone, according to the 
Central American Refugee Center, which helps refugees obtain asylum in the 
United States. Others have come from Nicaragua, but the vast majority have come 
from El Salvador, which is in the midst of a decade-long civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Haydee Sanchez, a spokeswoman for El Rescate, which provides legal and social 
services to refugees, said the long war has taken a toll on Salvadoran 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"Little kids, at the beginning of the war, were scared when they saw bodies in 
the streets," said Sanchez, who is from El Salvador. "Later, they didn't care 
anymore. I have a lot of cases of boys who saw relatives killed. Later on, 
these kids are doing the same thing to others" on the streets of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning of the migration that began in the late 1970s, Central 
American youths joined traditional Mexican-American gangs, experts say. In 
recent years, however, such youths have broken away from the traditional gangs 
and formed rival organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Mara Salvatrucha, the best-known Central American gang, originated in the 
downtown Los Angeles area several years ago but has spread to other areas of 
the city. Gang services workers say Mara Salvatrucha is the most difficult gang 
to work with. Its chapters are nomadic, fading out of one area and into 
another, they say. 
</P>
<P>
There are smaller bands of Nicaraguans, Hondurans and Guatemalans sprinkled 
around the city. Members include recent immigrants and those whose families 
migrated to the United States as long as a decade ago, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
The territory being claimed by these gangs includes central Van Nuys and 
streets with deteriorating apartment buildings near MacArthur Park. Central 
American gang graffiti -- "MS," for Mara Salvatrucha (which, roughly 
translated, means "tough Salvadorans,") and "CRS" for Crazy Riders -- are 
frequently seen on downtown Los Angeles buildings and is increasingly spotted 
in the Valley, police and community experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Mara Salvatrucha members have shown up at Grant High School in Van Nuys, where 
students are bused from the downtown Los Angeles area, said Fran Ramirez, an 
assistant principal. She said they have been involved in several beatings at 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
"They all fit into the big puzzle" in the Valley, Velasquez said of the Central 
American gangs. 
</P>
<P>
A 14-year-old Salvadoran boy nicknamed Little Cobra, declaring that he has quit 
Mara Salvatrucha, said violence has escalated lately in areas frequented by 
Central American gangs. "Everybody's getting killed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a four-month period late last year, said John Garcia, a downtown Community 
Youth Gang Services worker, five members of the well-known 18th Street gang, 
whose membership is predominantly Mexican-American, were killed. The Crazy 
Riders gang is feuding with the 18th Street gang. 
</P>
<P>
While authorities say the Central American gangs are growing in size and 
influence, they also argue that the percentage of immigrant youths choosing a 
gang lifestyle is small. "Like anything else, it's only the few who cause the 
problems," said Jerry Greenfield, a gang expert in the Police Department's 
Rampart Division downtown, where many of the gang members live. 
</P>
<P>
Although the various chapters of Mara Salvatrucha are involved in the same type 
of criminal activity as traditional Mexican-American gangs, there are 
differences in style, experts say. Central American gang members often dress in 
Iron Maiden T-shirts and listen to heavy metal music, while many 
Mexican-American gang members prefer the cholo look and listen to rock 'n' roll 
oldies. 
</P>
<P>
Rolando Mora, 20, a Salvadoran whose nickname is "Micho," said he joined Mara 
Salvatrucha for protection. Mora, who has been in the United States for three 
years, said he also joined because of racism in traditional gangs against 
people who are not of Mexican descent. 
</P>
<P>
Velasquez said some traditional Latino gangs look down on recent immigrants. 
Eddie Vega, Valesquez's colleague downtown, said that when the Central 
Americans first arrived, Mexican-American gang members "pushed them around. So 
they formed their own gangs." 
</P>
<P>
In working with the Central Americans, Vega tries to show them that there is 
enough freedom in the United States for an immigrant to make his own way. "This 
isn't El Salvador -- you can live a normal life and make honest money here," 
Vega said he tells them. 
</P>
<P>
But Sanchez said staying away from gangs is hard for recent immigrants of 
war-torn countries, who often are friendless and have lost parents. In other 
cases, say experts, Central American immigrant parents come to the United 
States first, then send for their children, sometimes years later. This can 
create alienation in the home that leads some youths to seek comfort in the 
gangs, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of them tell me they become a member of the gangs because it's the only 
way to survive in the U. S," Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
She recalled a boy named Edwin who saw his father murdered by Salvadoran 
political extremists when he was 14. He and his mother packed and headed to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
But when he settled in Los Angeles, the timid boy from San Salvador encountered 
a different kind of urban terror -- youth gangs. They whistled and called for 
him outside his apartment in a crime-ridden, drug-infested neighborhood and 
sometimes prevented him from going to school. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me, 'I don't know what to do,' " Sanchez said. "He said, 'I want to be 
good.' " 
</P>
<P>
Edwin's battle for independence from the gangs ended last year when he was 
arrested for car theft after joining a gang. While he was in Juvenile Hall in 
San Fernando, his mother died of an untreated case of pneumonia, leaving behind 
an angry young man who is almost unrecognizable as the earnest boy who wanted 
to study and do well in America, Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
Armando Morales, a clinical social worker in the Department of Psychiatry and 
Biobehavioral Sciences at UCLA, said theories tend to support police and 
community gang experts' assertions that the violence to which such gang members 
were exposed back home makes them more likely to lash out in America. 
</P>
<P>
"They have been desensitized to the value of human life," Morales said. 
</P>
<P>
Many members of Central American gangs are in the United States illegally, 
police say. They complain of the difficulty of deporting gang members who are 
not legal residents. But Bob Moschorak, acting director of the Los Angeles 
district office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said taking 
action against criminal illegal immigrants is a top priority of the agency. In 
November, the INS deported 1,069 illegal immigrants identified as criminals. He 
said that was the largest number in recent years.

THE 'ART MALL' BLOSSOMS IN SANTA MONICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When art librarian Annette Masling was in Southern California recently, her 
must-see list included a light-industrial mall in the 900 block of Colorado 
Avenue in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
She didn't go there to have her car repaired, despite the plethora of body 
shops in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Masling, who directs the library at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, 
N.Y. -- one of the oldest modern art museums in the country -- headed for 
Colorado Avenue to check out the latest offerings at what has become the center 
of the West Coast's contemporary art gallery scene. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the hub," said Christopher Ford, director of the Pence Gallery, one of 
six modern art venues in what many observers refer to as Santa Monica's "art 
mall." 
</P>
<P>
Ford was interviewed recently by Art &amp; Auction magazine, one of the leading 
gallery trade journals, about the contemporary art scene in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years ago, it all started in West Hollywood," he said. "Now that's 
dying. By moving into new spaces in Santa Monica, people can reinvent 
themselves, which is really what Los Angeles is all about." 
</P>
<P>
Art dealer James Corcoran moved to 5th Street in Santa Monica in 1986 after 
more than a decade in West Hollywood, pioneering the local modern art gallery 
boom. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the decision by Irving Blum to open a gallery on Colorado Avenue 
later that year that really ignited the current explosion. Blum's BlumHelman 
Gallery (co-owned by Joseph Helman), the Pence Gallery and Fred Hoffman, all of 
which opened in December, 1986, were the original tenants of the art mall. 
</P>
<P>
"Blum coming after Corcoran was really the snowball beginning to roll 
downhill," said Henry Korn, Santa Monica's arts administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Blum is a legend among contemporary art dealers. He was one of the owners of 
Los Angeles' Ferus Gallery, which gave its imprimatur in the 1950s and '60s to 
new artists such as Andy Warhol. After the Ferus closed in 1967, Blum ran his 
own gallery in West Hollywood until he moved to Manhattan in 1973. Blum's 
decision to return to the West Coast in 1986 is seen by many as a turning point 
in Los Angeles' recent ascent to major art-city status. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah McLeod, director of the BlumHelman Gallery, said Blum originally 
scouted for gallery space on La Brea and Melrose avenues but rejected them 
because of sky-high rentals and lack of parking. 
</P>
<P>
Blum decided to look in Santa Monica because it "was the pleasantest place 
around here," McLeod said. 
</P>
<P>
While hunting, the art dealer discovered a recently built light-industrial mall 
on Colorado whose tenants included a swimwear manufacturer. Blum peered in a 
window, McLeod said, and saw a 15-foot ceiling, poured concrete floors and a 
roll-up door in the rear that facilitated unpacking goods from the alley. 
</P>
<P>
Ford remembers being tipped off early in 1986 that Blum was considering moving 
into the Colorado Avenue complex. Ford had come from New York to open a gallery 
and had already signed up for space on La Brea. He drove around until he 
finally found the unglamorous 900 block of Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Ford couldn't believe that this was where an art dealer of Blum's stature was 
going to settle. "I looked around, and I said: 'Irving Blum has a major gallery 
on 57th Street. He's not going to open next to a Shakey's Pizza and a 
Laundromat.' Then I told myself to stop thinking like a New Yorker." 
</P>
<P>
Once Ford had chastised himself, he saw what Blum had seen -- a new building 
with interior space that could be shaped according to the tenant's needs, an 
abundance of parking and a freeway-close location. In short, he saw a great 
place for an art gallery in a city that, unlike New York, is dominated by the 
automobile. 
</P>
<P>
The opening of BlumHelman, the Pence Gallery and Fred Hoffman "was very 
propitious time-wise," Ford said. The gallery debuts coincided with the opening 
of the Museum of Contemporary Art's Grand Avenue building, the opening of the 
modern Anderson wing of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the first Los 
Angeles Art Fair. 
</P>
<P>
The art mall was an instant hit. Ford said the gallery soon had 500 visitors or 
more on a good day. 
</P>
<P>
McLeod said the key to its success was that "it's easy. You fall off the 
freeway and you're here, which makes it different from Venice." Parking is a 
cinch, especially on Saturdays, a big gallery day when most of the non-art 
businesses in the complex are closed. 
</P>
<P>
The gallery group also benefits from its relative isolation from other retail 
businesses, McLeod said. "Every person who comes to the gallery came to come to 
the gallery. They aren't someone who was next door buying an ice cream cone or 
shoelaces." 
</P>
<P>
Most of her visitors, McLeod said, are people who keep up with contemporary 
art, regulars who go from gallery to gallery and "make a half-day of it." 
</P>
<P>
The only time she recalls being inundated with what she called "non-art people" 
was during the gallery's recent show of photographs by the late, controversial 
Robert Mapplethorpe. "I found it unmanageable," she said. "Generally we have a 
highly filtered group of visitors. They are respectful of and knowledgeable 
about art and a pleasure to work with." 
</P>
<P>
Visitors can park their cars once and walk to nine different galleries, 
including four in industrial-style spaces across the street from the mall. 
Gallery owners often coordinate their openings. 
</P>
<P>
On opening nights, patrons, many wearing running shoes, wander from show to 
show, carrying bottles of Corona beer or plastic glasses of the Soave Bolla and 
Australian wine so many of the galleries serve. Some wear costumes. Some carry 
babies. 
</P>
<P>
On rare occasions, a stray homeless person wanders into one of the galleries 
from elsewhere in Santa Monica. One gallery staffer remembers being visited by 
an addled, barefoot man with a valise on his head. The man was assured that he 
was welcome to look at the show but then would have to leave or "I'll have to 
pick up Mr. Telephone." 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Goldeen, who opened her gallery across from the mall at 9th and 
Colorado in the fall of 1987, said she moved from San Francisco to Santa Monica 
because "I thought the future for the contemporary art world on the West Coast 
would be here." 
</P>
<P>
She still does. Goldeen said the unlikely, heavy-duty look of the gallery 
neighborhood is part of its charm. "It's a wonderful world to discover -- 
you're not aware of it until you find it. That sense of discovery is part of 
the excitement." 
</P>
<P>
After four years in West Hollywood, Richard Kuhlenschmidt opened his gallery in 
February at 1634 17th St., half a block south of Colorado. A major impetus was 
the difficulty of parking in West Hollywood. "People would get tickets, and 
that was very uncomfortable for me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhlenschmidt and other gallery owners in the area are hoping the 17th Street 
complex will grow into another art mall and become a regular stop on the 
Saturday circuit.

PHONE FINALLY RINGS FOR VOORHEES; CSUN LINEMAN DRAFTED BY GIANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The phone call Barry Voorhees had waited the better part of a lifetime to 
answer came Monday at 9:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Giants had made the 6-foot-5, 302-pound Cal State Northridge 
offensive guard an eighth-round selection in Monday's National Football League 
draft. A staffer from the team's player personnel department was on the line 
waiting to tell him about it. 
</P>
<P>
So where was Voorhees? 
</P>
<P>
Asleep in his room. 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't slept much all night and when I finally did, that's when the call 
came," Voorhees said. "My mom had to wake me up." 
</P>
<P>
There were 217 players picked ahead of Voorhees, 33 of whom were offensive 
linemen. But that mattered little when the call finally came. He was the only 
offensive lineman chosen by the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, it's the start of something," said Voorhees, who was scheduled to 
fly out of Santa Barbara this morning headed for a two-day mini-camp in New 
Jersey. "I went a little later than I expected. I thought maybe the fourth 
through sixth round, but I'm just happy that it happened." 
</P>
<P>
In all, five players with ties to the region were selected in the 12-round 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
Indianapolis, the team which had shown the most pre-draft interest in Voorhees, 
picked two former local standouts in the fourth round. Bill Schultz, a guard 
from Kennedy High and USC, was taken 94th overall and defensive back Alan 
Grant, from St. Francis High and Stanford, went eight players later with a 
choice the Colts obtained in a trade with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Michael Pringle, of Kennedy High and Cal State Fullerton, was 
taken by Atlanta in the sixth round. Former Montclair Prep standout Tim 
Stallworth, a wide receiver from Washington State, went to the Rams later in 
the same round. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Whitney, a 6-3, 300-pound offensive lineman from Cal Lutheran, was not 
selected but he has drawn interest as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
Whitney will work out with Raiders today, and the Rams and Saints have 
expressed interest, Whitney's agent said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the players Voorhees was chosen ahead of were quarterback Major Harris of 
West Virginia, a Heisman Trophy finalist; Brad Leggett, a starting guard for 
USC; and Texas A&amp;I running back Johnny Bailey, a three-time winner of the 
Harlon Hill Award as the nation's top Division II player. 
</P>
<P>
However, Voorhees does not hold the distinction of being the only Northridge 
player ever drafted, as was previously reported. 
</P>
<P>
After six months of saying Voorhees could become the first, the school 
discovered Monday that there was predecessor. In 1973, defensive back Doug 
Jones was a sixth-round choice of the Kansas City Chiefs.

DIGEST: 4 COMMIT TO CAL LUTHERAN FOR BASKETBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four players have given verbal commitments to join the Cal Lutheran basketball 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Ernie Bray said he is transferring from Whittier, where he played nine games 
last season, to Cal Lutheran. Bray, a 6-foot-2 guard and a 1989 graduate of 
Porterville High, said he will redshirt and have three years of college 
eligibility remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Brannon Hays, a 6-4 forward, played 1 1/2 seasons at Southwestern College and 
said he will have two years of eligibility for the Kingsmen. He attended Marian 
High in Imperial Beach. 
</P>
<P>
John Pletsch, a 6-7 center from Antelope Valley High, said he will attend Cal 
Lutheran. Pletsch averaged 10 points and 8.8 rebounds a game for the Antelopes, 
which won Golden League titles each of the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Cantwell, a 6-4 San Diegan from St. Augustine High, has also committed to 
Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
Tressie Millender, a sophomore from the College of the Canyons women's 
basketball team, signed a letted of intent Monday to play at Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Millender, a 5-10 forward, averaged 19.7 points and was selected the Western 
State Conference player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Today's West Valley League baseball game between El Camino Real and Chatsworth 
highs has been moved to Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
The 3 p.m. game, originally scheduled at Chatsworth, was moved because of a 
construction project at El Camino Real. An electric scoreboard is being 
installed in center field. 
</P>
<P>
The teams also will play at Chatsworth on Thursday at 3. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay Orton, a 12-year-old gymnast from Sunland, finished eighth in the 
all-around competition at the Regional Gymnastics Level 10 meet Sunday in 
Phoenix and will advance to the national meet, to be held May 4-6 in Colorado 
Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Orton is the state champion for girls age 12-14 in the vault, balance beam and 
floor exercise and is the only Californian to qualify for the national 
championships.

SOCKERS BRING IN HATTRUP OF AISA FOR TRYOUT

Peter Hattrup, a 26-year-old forward who recently finished a season with the 
Atlanta Attack of the American Indoor Soccer Assn., will try out with the 
Sockers today. 
</P>
<P>
Because forward Steve Zungul (arthritic hips) and defender Don Cogsville (knee 
surgery) were placed on the disabled list Friday, Major Indoor Soccer League 
rules allow the Sockers to sign one field player to a 15-day contract. 
</P>
<P>
Socker President Ron Cady said Hattrup would have to be obtained on loan since 
he is still under contract with Atlanta. Hattrup will be given a physical and 
then will practice with the Sockers for the remainder of the week. Coach Ron 
Newman said Hattrup would be signed in the event of further injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just protecting ourselves," Newman said. "It's a security move." 
</P>
<P>
Hattrup, one of the AISA's leading scorers, caught Newman's eye while trying 
out in the preseason for the Tacoma Stars, who eventually cut him. 
</P>
<P>
"I was quite impressed with the lad," Newman said. "I was a little surprised 
Tacoma cut him. I thought I'd keep track of his progress." 
</P>
<P>
Hattrup, Newman said, is quick, has an accurate shot and good touch with the 
ball. He scored one goal in 11 games with Tacoma during his only MISL seasons, 
1986-87 and 1987-88. 
</P>
<P>
Cady said the Sockers may give tryouts to two more AISA players later this 
week. DON PATTERSON

CRITIC AT LARGE: PAULETTE GODDARD -- AN AMERICAN BEAUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The deaths, in a matter of days, of Greta Garbo and Paulette Goddard (who died 
Monday in Switzerland at the age of 78) is among other things a reminder of the 
amazing range of charismatic men and women Hollywood found to play in its films 
during its great, golden years that stretched from its earliest hand-cranked 
times to the mid-1940s, when television changed everything. 
</P>
<P>
It would be hard to imagine two public personas much more different than 
Goddard was from Garbo. And yet, long after either had made a film, both 
continued to excite the imagination and command the interest of millions of us 
who had seen them on the large screen or the small. They attest to the 
immortality that the motion pictures grant to those who have been seen in them. 
</P>
<P>
What the two women shared was that they had had to go to work very young, Garbo 
lathering the customers in a barber shop, Goddard dancing in Florenz Ziegfeld's 
chorus line, both girls only 14. 
</P>
<P>
Both were uncommonly beautiful, in quite different ways, Garbo beautiful in a 
classical, patrician, almost aloof way, yet with that wonderful throaty voice 
which declared without saying so that where there was ice there was fire, and 
sailor beware. 
</P>
<P>
Goddard's beauty was as domestic, as thoroughly American, as Garbo's was 
foreign and exotic. Goddard was perky and pretty, sexy and saucy. Hers was the 
vitality that suggested (if you were casting the part) that she was not 
destined to stay anonymous in the chorus line very long. 
</P>
<P>
It's another instance of the richness that Hollywood lured to citrusland that 
Goddard and Lucille Ball were both handmaidens to Eddie Cantor at the start of 
their film careers -- Goddard in a small role in "The Kid from Spain," Ball in 
"Roman Scandals." 
</P>
<P>
Goddard's great break was catching the eye of Charlie Chaplin, and her poignant 
performance in "Modern Times" was, in a sense, a Valentine opportunity from a 
lover, which she made the most of. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, her filmography for the most part reveals as much about the 
Hollywood studio system as it does about her acting ability, and she lent her 
vivacious glamour to quite a list of unmemorable works. Yet her best vehicles, 
like "The Cat and the Canary," which Elliott Nugent directed and in which she 
co-starred with Bob Hope in his first major role, are still fun to see. 
</P>
<P>
It remains true that those we anoint as stars are, one way or another, 
projections of our fantasies, people we would like to know if not to be. Stars, 
like fingerprints and snowflakes, are each unique, however much they may share 
a starry glamour. Paulette Goddard was her own blend of beauty, a lively 
intelligence and what the viewer could perceive as an independent spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Like the great progression of stars from Chaplin and Pickford forward, she was 
part of our lives and our dreams, and whether she was a favorite or simply one 
of the pantheon, it's impossible not to feel a sense of loss and a nudging 
reminder of our own mortality.

A MUSICAL LOOK AT OTHER SIDE OF ANDY WARHOL; 
</P>
<P>
ALBUM: LOU REED AND JOHN CALE, PARTNERS IN VELVET UNDERGROUND, COLLABORATE 
AGAIN TO REPAY A DEBT IN A 15-SONG BIOGRAPHY OF THEIR MENTOR. 
</P>

<P>
The late Andy Warhol, who prospered in part by creating portraits of the 
famous, is now on the receiving end. The medium is music, and the artists are 
two essential rock figures whose careers Warhol helped launch 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The work is "Songs for Drella," a 15-song biography of the Pop Art icon that 
marks the first collaboration by Lou Reed and John Cale since their stormy 
partnership in the Velvet Underground, the band that Warhol shepherded into 
rock legend in the swinging '60s. 
</P>
<P>
"Drella," which is due in stores today, is a historical and psychological study 
of theartist from his childhood to his death at age 58 in 1987. It chronicles 
Warhol's ascent in the art world, outlines his aesthetic philosophy, captures 
his personal quirks, world view and deadpan tone, and makes chillingly palpable 
the isolation and uncertainty that descended on him after he was shot by a 
deranged hanger-on in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Reed sees the album as an antidote to what he calls calls "the spate of 
opportunistic, negative, vile books about Andy." 
</P>
<P>
During a recent interview in the Burbank offices of Warner Bros. Records, Reed, 
46, explained the motivation: "It doesn't seem the general public is being 
given any information to counteract this by someone who knew him and cared 
about him, so we decided we should do that. To give another point, another look 
at him." 
</P>
<P>
Cale, 49, and Reed had already gotten together to play informally when the idea 
for the Warhol project evolved from a friend's suggestion that Cale write a 
Mass for their friend. After determining the chronological structure and seven 
thematic areas, the two acquired backing from two New York organizations -- the 
Arts at St. Ann's and the Brooklyn Academy of Music -- and dug in. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really hard, rewriting it," said Reed. "Like, what is the song really 
about? How do you really feel about it? How far do you want to go with this? 
</P>
<P>
"It was really interesting for me. I found out more than I cared to know. But 
in another way it was kind of nice. I closed the door on certain things. Of 
course, I didn't get to talk to Andy, because he went and died. That's the 
crux. The record still can't do that, that I know about. And I'll never get a 
chance to say thank you." 
</P>
<P>
Reed's estrangement from Warhol is depicted unflinchingly on the record, and 
the singer expresses his profound regret in "Hello It's Me," a soul-baring 
valediction that ends the album. But in person, Reed proved capable of avoiding 
some topics as tenaciously as he dug into others. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, that's in the album," he said of his break with Warhol. "I can't talk 
about that. It's personal stuff. I figured out just how far I wanted to go, and 
that's in the album." 
</P>
<P>
The roots of the Reed-Cale-Warhol relationship go back to November of 1965, 
when Warhol went to a Greenwich Village tourist dive called the Cafe Bizarre to 
see a quartet called the Velvet Underground, which played five or six sets a 
night of edgy, dark-themed music. The artist invited the band to join him at 
his upcoming appearance at the old Cinematheque in New York. They could play 
and he'd project his films on them. Before long, Warhol was the Velvets' 
manager and producer. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way we could get hired was through Andy," Reed recalled. "We were a 
zero, we were non-existent. The only jobs we had were playing art festivals 
with Andy. They were always calling Andy to do an art festival and show his 
films, and instead of doing that he would show up with the films and us. He 
wanted to get into rock 'n' roll, and we were perfect for him." 
</P>
<P>
Reed wasn't crazy about Warhol's installation of the German model Nico as lead 
singer, but he gives him full credit for establishing the band as a major, 
lasting influence in rock. 
</P>
<P>
"He had this amazing ability to make things happen. He also protected us. He 
made it possible for that first Velvet Underground record to come out as a 
Velvet Underground record, not changed around by outside forces. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because he was Andy and he said, 'Oh, that's great,' these other people 
would leave the tape alone. And that set kind of a standard for Velvet 
Underground records after that. He was like this umbrella. It kept other people 
from tampering with the thing." 
</P>
<P>
The "Drella" album is a major shift of gears for Reed, who's coming off his 
most critically acclaimed and commercially successful LP in years, "New York." 
In contrast to that hard-rocking opus, "Drella" is just Reed and Cale, sawing 
and hammering on keyboards, guitars and viola. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very important that it be John and I and nobody else," said Reed. "I 
want you to hear clearly without anything getting in the way of it. 'Cause 
that's what's unique about it. It's me playing with John Cale, and bringing in 
anything else makes it less clear and harder to hear. For better or for worse, 
this is what we sound like playing together and talking about Andy. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a record can bring you closer than possibly anything. I always picture 
someone listening to it alone at night. And if you do that then it's like a 
story is being told to you with music illustrating it. You can get deeper and 
deeper into this person. I wanted you to come away feeling you met somebody."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: TRAIL OF ABUSE IN THE 'HILARY' CUSTODY CASE; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: TONIGHT'S 'FRONTLINE' PRESENTS AN UPDATED BBC PROGRAM THAT USES 
SENSATIONALISM IN ADVANCING THE CLAIMS OF THE MOTHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Morgan-Foretich child custody war may be the most stunning case of abuse in 
America these days. Abuse by the media. 
</P>
<P>
It continues tonight on the PBS program "Frontline," which is presenting an 
updated version of a sometimes irresponsible BBC documentary already shown in 
England and four times this month on Lifetime cable. Airing at 9 on Channels 28 
and 15, and 10 on Channel 50, it's titled "Hilary in Hiding." 
</P>
<P>
The "Hilary" is 7-year-old Hilary Foretich, a victim if there ever was one. 
When it comes to media coverage, in fact, both she and her father are 
casualties. 
</P>
<P>
Hilary's divorced parents are plastic surgeon Elizabeth Morgan and oral surgeon 
Eric Foretich. Morgan was released last year after spending 25 months in a 
Washington, D.C., jail for hiding her daughter rather than obeying a judge's 
order to allow Foretich unsupervised visits with Hilary. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan claims that Foretich began sexually abusing Hilary when she was 2 1/2, a 
charge that Foretich strenuously denies and that no court has upheld. Foretich 
accuses his ex-wife of being insane and has claimed that she sexually abused 
Hilary. 
</P>
<P>
In February, Hilary was discovered living with her maternal grandparents in 
Christchurch, New Zealand. Morgan has joined her there, and the case is now in 
New Zealand courts. 
</P>
<P>
Foretich obtained an order from U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin on April 6 
stopping Lifetime from showing the BBC program on grounds that portions would 
cause Hilary "irreparable harm." But that order was overturned by a U.S. Court 
of Appeals, which ruled that the order would amount to "prior restraint" of 
media. 
</P>
<P>
The BBC-produced program recounts the ugly battle over Hilary and, appallingly, 
includes footage of her at age 4, graphically using anatomically correct dolls 
in conversation with her mother (Morgan: "Tell me where he puts it") to show 
how she was allegedly molested by her father (Hilary: "The daddy took off the 
pants . . ."). 
</P>
<P>
In other words, what we have here, with the obvious blessing of her mother -- 
who supplied the tape -- is a child now presenting almost five minutes of TV 
show-and-tell about something so private that she insisted at the time (this is 
also on camera) that two therapists working on behalf of her mother leave the 
room. 
</P>
<P>
Now, thanks to TV, the world is in the room. 
</P>
<P>
After strenuous lobbying by Foretich's attorney, Elaine J. Mittleman, executive 
producer David Fanning said Friday that "Frontline" would shorten the 
anatomical doll section and in some instances substitute paraphrasing for 
actual language. He added: "It's a very hard decision to balance the evidence 
with the rights of the child." 
</P>
<P>
What evidence? A child saying things in a camera session arranged by her mother 
after Hilary had been mostly under Morgan's control during a hateful custody 
battle is evidence? 
</P>
<P>
Here's another opinion: That Morgan would allow this tape to be released -- and 
that the BBC, Lifetime and PBS would show any part of it -- is a disgrace and 
an invasion of Hilary's privacy, which even now at age 7 she is too young to 
comprehend. Just because her mother approved showing the tape to the world 
doesn't make it right. 
</P>
<P>
In granting the restraining order that was later reversed on a constitutional 
issue, Judge Sporkin used strong words, wondering why "something as private as 
this was turned over to the media." Was it, he asked, "to make a circus of this 
thing?" You wonder. 
</P>
<P>
Sporkin likened supplying Hilary's footage to the media to the way a "child 
pornographer . . . goes out and abuses a little child." 
</P>
<P>
Something else about the footage -- the BBC's fuzzing over of Hilary's face, as 
if her manipulation of the dolls were some kind of X-rated adult video -- also 
understandably disturbed Sporkin. 
</P>
<P>
Why else, but for titillation, is her face obscured? It can't be to protect 
her, for her face is clearly shown elsewhere on the program, and a glossy 
photograph of her accompanies the "Hilary in Hiding" publicity packet sent to 
the press. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time that a videotape of Hilary made by Morgan or her 
supporters -- and obviously intended to damage Foretich -- has surfaced on 
national TV. 
</P>
<P>
On CBS not long ago, "Saturday Night With Connie Chung" aired a story about the 
case that included a 1986 home video of Hilary becoming hysterical when 
Foretich showed up for his court-authorized, unsupervised visitation. 
</P>
<P>
After being barred from entering the house by Morgan and Morgan's father, 
Foretich was shown angrily pushing his way in as Morgan -- quite 
melodramatically and mindful of the camera, it seemed -- continually implored 
him to leave for Hilary's sake. He did leave -- and without Hilary. 
</P>
<P>
Although the footage made Hilary appear terrified of a ranting invader, it was 
evidence of nothing, for Hilary just as easily could have been reacting to 
something her mother told her about her father as to something he actually did. 
</P>
<P>
TV brutalizes both Hilary and Foretich, although in different ways. 
</P>
<P>
Coming May 20 is the CBS movie "In the Best Interest of the Child," which is 
about a woman jailed after heroically fleeing with her small daughter and 
hiding her to save her from being molested by her ex-husband, who has been 
granted unsupervised visitation. Although the father is not portrayed as an 
ogre, the only logical conclusion from seeing the movie is that he molested his 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Although its parallels to the Morgan-Foretich case are striking and the movie's 
executive producer, Robert Papazian, met with Morgan while she was in jail, the 
story "is not based" on the Morgan-Foretich case, CBS and the producers insist. 
</P>
<P>
Who are they kidding? 
</P>
<P>
The CBS movie undoubtedly will be viewed as an endorsement of Morgan and an 
indictment of Foretich, as will another movie from ABC ratifying Morgan's 
charge that Foretich raped Hilary. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan sold her movie rights to producer Linda Otto. Otto, however, will make 
"The Elizabeth Morgan Story" for ABC "without Elizabeth's participation," the 
producer said Monday. "No. 1, she's not here and, No. 2, she's under a gag 
order in New Zealand." She said that she was negotiating with a "secondary 
source" whom she declined to name. 
</P>
<P>
Otto said that she is determined to protect Hilary. But won't a movie rehashing 
the case ultimately cause the child more harm than good? "I don't know the 
answer to that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Morgan being at least temporarily excluded, the movie will still tell 
"Elizabeth's story" and give the impression that Foretich sexually abused the 
child without actually showing molestation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Elizabeth and I spent a lot of time together, and I will honor what I believe 
to be our agreement," she said. "But I will document everything. Nothing about 
this movie will be contestable." 
</P>
<P>
However, she has no plans to ask Foretich for his account. "I've been around 
this issue a number of years," said Otto, a child-molestation victim herself 
who has focused her producing career on documentaries and stories about 
children as victims, including the influential NBC docudrama "Adam" and 
"Unspeakable Acts," a recent CBS docudrama about a sexual-abuse scandal at a 
Florida day care center. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of evidence (against Foretich)," she said. "I am going to 
reveal the truth." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan's "truth," that is -- the one that no court has accepted. 
</P>
<P>
This is an old story for Foretich. Although no one knows which parent is 
telling the truth, it's Morgan who has been portrayed in the media mostly as a 
courageous, suffering, Madonna-like heroine and Foretich mostly as villainous. 
</P>
<P>
This is a case where the court of public opinion may also have been shaped by 
TV performance. Morgan is telegenic, usually appearing wounded, vulnerable and 
on the verge of motherly tears. Foretich, who says he began accepting TV 
interviews only in response to his ex-wife's many interviews from her jail 
cell, is a disaster on camera, often tending to stutter and flash anger when 
goaded by the kind of aggressive questions that Morgan rarely seems to get. 
</P>
<P>
Judged on their TV appearances alone, Morgan is the protective mother, Foretich 
the crazed father. But TV appearances may have no bearing on facts.

A BARITONE WHO SPEAKS HIS MIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Baritone Thomas Hampson has become the darling of the public and the critics. 
The 34-year-old Spokane native, who sings a recital tonight at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa and on Thursday at Ambassador 
Auditorium in Pasadena, has made a meteoric rise to success ever since local 
audiences and press spotted him in the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, Hampson is the first to downplay his stardom status and the cult 
of personality arising around him. 
</P>
<P>
"Somehow I feel we've gotten off the track and have started to become voice 
fanatics," Hampson said in a recent phone interview from New York, where he was 
singing Dr. Falke in Johann Strauss' "Die Fledermaus" at the Metropolitan 
Opera. 
</P>
<P>
"In and of itself, that is fun and exciting, but the notion of singing is much 
more than a human voice in a costume. It should be a very personal experience. 
That's my definition." 
</P>
<P>
Hampson has succeeded in making it a personal experience whether singing opera 
or lieder, and he rebels against the idea that a singer must chose between one 
form or the other. 
</P>
<P>
"The business of singing lieder should not preclude the business of singing 
opera, and vice versa," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"What I think has happened and is happening in the business of music -- which 
is a business -- is the specialization or the compartmentalization of singers. 
I just don't want to be classified, and singers should not be. They should not 
become a commodity or a product." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles audiences have heard Hampson in a number of recitals, but haven't 
seen him on the stage of the Music Center Opera since he sang Marcello in 
Puccini's "La Boheme" there in 1987. An account of professional disagreements 
between Hampson and LAMCO general director Peter Hemmings recently surfaced in 
the press. 
</P>
<P>
"That's almost getting blown out of proportion," Hampson countered. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is, folks, Los Angeles (Music) Opera Company has a repertory 
and Mr. Hemmings has got the right to run an opera company as he wants to run 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, it's not unusual, it's not possible to come every year to Los Angeles, 
even if I had the desire to. I don't want to throw a bowl of water in Mr. 
Hemming's face. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"No, I haven't been invited back. Were there differences? Apparently so. Are 
there hard feelings? Apparently so. Not on my side. I would very much like to 
sing opera in Los Angeles, as much as anywhere else. But I don't want to make 
it an issue." 
</P>
<P>
Hemmings did not return repeated phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the downsides of this fast-track and great rise -- I hate that -- to 
some stature is that there is a great deal of shuffling and rescheduling. San 
Francisco Opera, thank goodness, saw that and were very good at that." 
</P>
<P>
One can see how Hampson might run into conflicts with certain opera directors 
and producers, especially those producers whom he describes as having "mainly 
theater backgrounds (who) are amused by opera and want to show us how drama 
works. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that theater is illusion," Hampson said. 
</P>
<P>
"The notion of realism in theater sometimes gets confused with the basic art 
form, which is the creating of illusion. The creeping into realism -- which is 
a direct influence from TV and films, less so from the theater -- will probably 
always be the big problem of opera. You must be able to express vocally the 
essence of the piece, which sometimes is incongruous with what a person looks 
like." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, no one has ever complained about what the strappingly handsome 
Hampson looks like. But Hampson deflects attention from such superficialities. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that I'm in the best position to speak honestly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If I do not get any farther in the music business, if the flavor of the month 
turns to be something -- someone -- else, not me, as it inevitably will, I will 
be very happy. 
</P>
<P>
"American singers have nothing to be ashamed of," he added. "This crisis we 
keep hearing about in the musical world -- where are the great singers? -- 
simply reflects the world in general. 
</P>
<P>
"Where are the great personalities? Where are the great thinkers? Is mediocrity 
becoming the great king? Is getting along more important than striving for 
something? Those are the great questions. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Still, were there no personal sacrifices on the road to fame? 
</P>
<P>
"I was married," he said. "I am divorced. One, I don't want to talk about it. 
Two, I don't want to blame that on my career. Not at all. 
</P>
<P>
"(My career) has not taken a (personal) toll. Quite the contrary, it has opened 
my life and soul. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I'm a better person. I feel that everything that has happened -- and is 
happening -- to me personally -- the deeper I go into repertory, into more 
singing, research, programming -- is really an inner path of opening and 
awareness to myself.

KOHL OFFERS 1 TO 1 EXCHANGE RATE FOR E. GERMAN MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TYLER MARSHALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WEST BERLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bowing to political pressure, the West German government Monday proposed that 
East German wages and pensions be exchanged into deutschemarks at a highly 
favorable 1-to-1 exchange rate as part of a German currency union planned in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate, which effectively will determine the wealth of individual 
East Germans, has become the first major potential flash point between the two 
Germanys as they move toward unification. 
</P>
<P>
The West German Bundesbank had proposed changing East Germany's overvalued 
ostmarks for deutschemarks at a 2-to-1 rate, except for small savers and 
pensioners. 
</P>
<P>
The decision would appear to meet most basic demands of the newly elected East 
Berlin government and the hundreds of thousands of East Germans who took to the 
streets to protest in favor of a 1-to-1 rate after the Bundesbank's 
recommendation was leaked to the press earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
The West German government's proposal also offered 1-to-1 exchange rates on 
savings of up to $2,500 per person, twice the level recommended by the 
Bundesbank. 
</P>
<P>
All other East German savings, credits, debts or other monetary assets would be 
exchanged at a 2-to-1 rate, according to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The 1-to-1 rate will give East German wage earners and pensioners an effective 
increase of around 500%, if compared with current black market exchange rates 
of around 5 ostmarks for one deutschemark. 
</P>
<P>
But more than that, it will give them the freedom for the first time to shop 
without restrictions with a hard, Western currency. 
</P>
<P>
Like all former Communist Bloc currencies, the East German ostmark is neither 
wanted nor freely convertible in the West. 
</P>
<P>
However, attempts to slow the exodus of East Germans to West Germany and to 
meet expectations for a 1-to-1 rate awakened by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's 
campaign rhetoric before last month's East German national election apparently 
led to Bonn's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a historic offer for the people of the German Democratic Republic (East 
Germany)," said Volker Ruehe, chairman of Kohl's Christian Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing German inflation, European financial markets reacted negatively to the 
news, with German stocks, bonds and the deutschemark itself all declining in 
value. 
</P>
<P>
In East Berlin, the proposal was greeted cautiously. A government spokesman 
described it as "an interesting negotiating offer." 
</P>
<P>
Helga Mausch, the leader of the powerful East German FDGB trade union, told 
United Press International that the proposal was an acceptable place to begin 
negotiations, but she said East Germans will need additional breaks to offset 
the loss of subsidies and the introduction of price reforms. 
</P>
<P>
But Wolfgang Ullmann, a vice president of the East German Parliament and a 
leader of the Democracy Now movement, said the West German offer fails to 
consider a large portion of what East Germans had saved. 
</P>
<P>
"If this is the final decision, there should be sharp protest because a large 
part of savings will not be considered here," UPI quoted him as saying. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany's new prime minister, Lothar de Maiziere, meets with Kohl today in 
Bonn to discuss the currency union and other key elements of the planned state 
treaty that will be the cornerstone of German unity. 
</P>
<P>
It is the first summit of two democratically elected German leaders and is 
expected to be a private meeting, without aides. 
</P>
<P>
Both leaders have said they want to have the state treaty in force by early 
July, a timetable that means agreement on its component parts -- the social, 
economic and currency union -- must be reached within the next 3 to 4 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
While East Germans seemed generally pleased with the 1-to-1 exchange offer, 
Western economists questioned how long this pleasure would last. 
</P>
<P>
They predicted that a 1-to-1 rate on wages would likely break far more of East 
Germany's already weak, obsolete industries as they try to compete with the 
West. The 2-to-1 rate would have given East German industry more competitive 
wage levels, they noted. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's decision marked the second time in two months that the Kohl government 
has rejected the Bundesbank's advice in connection with the planned monetary 
union. 
</P>
<P>
In February, Kohl came out in favor of a currency union with East Germany on 
the same day that Bundesbank president Karl-Otto Poehl advised against such a 
move. 
</P>
<P>
The two incidents severely dent the Bundesbank's once-powerful reputation as 
the premier example of a central bank's success in resisting political 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
According to news agency reports, West German government spokesman Dieter Vogel 
said that the government-run Bundesbank accepted the proposal without dispute. 
He said the proposal was motivated by the needs of the "economic and social 
development in both parts of Germany and the stability of the German mark." 
</P>
<P>
"The Bundesbank has also accepted that the economically prettiest solution 
cannot always be taken," he added.

was greeted cautiously, a soldier pushes a cart loaded with bags of East German

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, warned by conservatives that he was 
risking social upheaval of revolutionary proportions with plans for radical 
economic reforms, is slowing the pace of change but maintaining his goal of 
establishing a "regulated market economy," his spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the reforms, including sharp increases in consumer prices and extensive 
privatization of the Soviet Union's state-owned industry, will be deferred 
until next year, presidential press secretary Arkady A. Maslennikov said, and 
then undertaken only when low- and middle-income families have been protected 
from sharp drops in their standard of living. 
</P>
<P>
Top Soviet officials, including Gorbachev's senior economic advisers, had said 
the first steps would be taken by May 1 and that quick, sharp moves were 
necessary. But Maslennikov told a Kremlin briefing that the government will 
concentrate this year on reducing inflation and the economy's chronic shortages 
and use the additional time to develop the reform program. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, we shall aim to stabilize the market, and 1991 will be the year of 
the beginning of reform," Maslennikov said. "It is unrealistic to say that all 
our problems can be resolved in the year and a half to the end of 1991, but we 
should have our parameters worked out by then." 
</P>
<P>
Plans presented to the new Presidential Council at two meetings this month 
called for the whole reform program to be presented to the Supreme Soviet, the 
country's legislature, on Wednesday, with initial moves to be made next week. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the measures were to come into effect on July 1, and the economic 
transition was to be complete by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
"These shocks are unacceptable because the situation in the country is 
difficult, if not to say tough," Maslennikov said, acknowledging that the 
government retreated from the timetable when it reassessed its high social 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
"To ask people to make such serious sacrifices would not only be morally wrong 
but also unwise from every standpoint, including the political one." 
</P>
<P>
The government's stabilization effort this year will attempt to withdraw 
surplus money from the economy by selling shares of stock in state enterprises, 
issuing high-interest bonds, selling apartments and construction materials for 
new housing and related measures. 
</P>
<P>
But there apparently was so much dispute over the other measures that the 
balance of the program, including the timetable, remains unsettled, and most of 
the necessary legislation, perhaps as many as 18 new laws, will not be 
introduced until the autumn. 
</P>
<P>
Radical reformers, including Nikolai Y. Petrakov, Gorbachev's own economic 
adviser, and Stanislav S. Shatalin, a member of the Presidential Council, had 
argued for bold and immediate action, criticizing the measures of the past five 
years as so timid that they only worsened the situation. 
</P>
<P>
With this approach in mind, a team of 60 economists and other social scientists 
has been preparing a comprehensive set of reforms, most of which require 
legislative action but some of which Gorbachev could implement by presidential 
decree. Most these will now be put off until Gorbachev can win support for them 
within the party at its July congress and among the people. 
</P>
<P>
"No one had set a fixed period of weeks or months for this program," 
Maslennikov said, ignoring the timetables laid out publicly by senior 
government economists over the past two months. 
</P>
<P>
From Maslennikov's remarks and those of leading party and government officials, 
the radical reformers appear to have suffered serious reversals in the intense 
politicking now under way over the future of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Vadim A. Medvedev, the party secretary for ideology, told a conference of other 
party ideologists Monday that, despite the trend away from Marxism-Leninism and 
communism as the country's theoretical underpinning, ideology remains decisive 
and should not abandoned or ignored. 
</P>
<P>
He called on the ideologists to halt the growing panic within the party's ranks 
and to fight efforts to divide it. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, meeting with worker representatives from the 
Tyumen oil fields in western Siberia, harshly criticized the government 
bureaucracy for failing to supply the region with sufficient food and consumer 
goods and to improve living conditions there. 
</P>
<P>
Promises had been made in March to avert what would have been a crippling 
strike, one that would shake the whole economy and perhaps the country's 
stability, Ryzhkov reminded officials, and these commitments were not being 
met. 
</P>
<P>
For the past two months, the Communist Party's resurgent conservative wing, 
citing such worker unrest, has been warning that the sharp departures from 
traditional Marxism entailed in the planned move to a market economy would 
split the party on the eve of a pivotal congress, which opens here on July 2, 
and thus undermine the broader reform effort. 
</P>
<P>
As the full impact of the reforms became clear -- consumer prices doubling and 
trebling, unemployment running into tens of millions with plant closings, a new 
property-owning, entrepreneurial class emerging -- more dire warnings came of 
possible, even probable worker revolts and widespread social upheavals. 
</P>
<P>
"They approached the edge, looked over and were horrified by what they saw," a 
senior Soviet editor said of the intense government debate over the reforms 
during the past three weeks. "They did not pull back in a panic but out of a 
real fear of what could happen. 
</P>
<P>
"The anger, the frustration are already there, and a few sparks could set 
quickly off the proverbial 'prairie fire' in this revolutionary tinder. . . . 
Well, carrying out these reforms in a quick shock would be like turning a 
blow-torch on." 
</P>
<P>
Maslennikov said that, while the government remains committed to accelerating 
and broadening its economic reforms, there will be no "shock therapy" despite 
the published outlines for a program similar to that undertaken by Poland's 
Solidarity-led government to establish a market economy there. 
</P>
<P>
After much debate, the government had concluded that the economic 
transformation has to be carried out without "large social shocks," Maslennikov 
said. 
</P>
<P>
High levels of unemployment are "unacceptable to socialism," he continued, and 
steps to bring Soviet prices into line with real production costs and 
international prices, thus ending the heavy subsidies for many consumer goods, 
have to be "coupled with measures that guarantee the social security of the 
population." 
</P>
<P>
"The principle of 'Let the strongest survive' is not acceptable to us," 
Maslennikov said, "but we do need to rid ourselves of the mentality of social 
dependency, which it has a very negative impact." 
</P>
<P>
The planned economic transformation must take the country's present 
administrative system into account, Maslennikov said, dissociating Gorbachev 
from radical reformers who hoped that the new measures would bring a complete 
and immediate break. 
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to get rid of it, but it is not good sense and even dangerous 
to ignore it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's resolve to proceed to bolder reforms may also have been weakened by 
the country's deteriorating economic performance and the contention by some 
that this must be reversed before proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet gross national product, the value of all the goods and services 
here, dropped by 1% and industrial output by 1.2% in the first quarter of this 
year, compared to the same period in 1989, according to government figures. 
</P>
<P>
The national income, the best overall indicator in a socialist economy, shrank 
by 2%, and labor productivity, another critical measure, dropped by 2.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Inflation has continued to soar. While officially estimated at 8%, it probably 
is far higher -- the gap between the country's declining output and increasing 
incomes jumped 14% in the first quarter of the year, and the State Bank issued 
26% more money than it did in the first three months of 1989.

MOSCOW OFFERS NEW TERMS FOR LITHUANIA TALKS

The Kremlin, seeking an end to a damaging six-week-old political standoff with 
Lithuania, has offered to accept the republic's declaration of independence as 
long as Lithuania suspends for two years all measures leading to its 
implementation, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin offer, presented to reporters in Moscow by Gorbachev's spokesman, 
Arkady A. Maslennikov, also called for the Baltic republic to reaccept the 
authority of the Soviet constitution, which its legislature has ruled invalid. 
Then, Maslennikov said, Moscow likely would agree to open negotiations with 
Lithuanian leaders. 
</P>
<P>
But Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis unequivocally rejected the 
Kremlin suggestions, saying: "This is a proposal which could lead us back to 
the cage." 
</P>
<P>
The Moscow proposal for a way out of the deadlock appeared aimed at defusing 
the Lithuanian crisis before Gorbachev meets President Bush next month in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The Baltic republic, forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940, 
declared its independence on March 11. Since then, it has been engaged in a war 
of wills with Moscow that has prompted concern and some criticism of the 
Kremlin from Western leaders, including Bush. 
</P>
<P>
In an apparent attempt at compromise, Maslennikov said Moscow no longer 
requires that Lithuania rescind legislation bolstering the independence 
declaration. Earlier, this requirement had been voiced by Gorbachev himself, 
and the Lithuanian legislature's refusal to comply led to Moscow's imposition 
of economic sanctions, including a cutoff of oil and a drastic reduction of 
natural gas supplies. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not trying to bring anyone to his knees," Maslennikov said. "It is 
secondary in which way they (Lithuanians) come back to the Soviet constitution 
-- by rescinding the independence laws or by freezing the laws. If Lithuanians 
want them to stand for history, then that is OK. That is their business." 
</P>
<P>
In a further sign of conciliation, Maslennikov said that if Lithuania, even 
while continuing to declare its independence, approaches Moscow "with a freeze 
and is ready to stop producing unconstitutional laws, this may provide a basis 
for negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Moscow has refused repeated requests by Lithuanian leaders to open 
negotiations. Gorbachev has said that bargaining with Lithuania would be 
tantamount to recognizing the republic as an independent country and that it 
must first renounce its sovereignty declaration. 
</P>
<P>
But Landsbergis, speaking to a news conference in the Lithuanian capital of 
Vilnius, said that agreeing to negotiate with Moscow under the conditions 
outlined by Maslennikov "would be like acting as though the prison sentence 
which we have received, which we know is unjustified, were just. . . . Even 
Franz Kafka (the late surrealist writer) couldn't have thought of such a thing. 
</P>
<P>
"The proposal just to go back and obey the constitution of the U.S.S.R. as if 
it were in force in Lithuania is completely illogical," he added. 
</P>
<P>
In a defiant gesture, according to Soviet television, the republic's government 
ordered the 15 deputies who are members of the national Supreme Soviet, or 
legislature, to resign their posts in that assembly, saying Lithuanians could 
no longer participate in the legislative bodies of other countries. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that today marks a kind of breakthrough. We are coming into a period 
of active defense," Deputy Prime Minister Romualdas Ozolas said of the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
Before the resignation of the deputies was announced, Maslennikov sounded a 
stern warning about the possible consequences if Moscow's offer is ignored. 
</P>
<P>
"The more rational redistribution of the oil and gas to satisfy other republics 
was a strong signal to Lithuania that there cannot be a free-for-all with this 
question," Maslennikov said, referring to Moscow's moves last week to cut off 
oil supplies to the republic and reduce natural gas supplies by about 84%. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the spokesman indicated that Moscow would try to prevent Lithuania 
from replacing the energy resources with imports from the West, saying: 
"Lithuania is still a part of the Soviet Union, and what can be imported or 
delivered is a question for the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet action forced Lithuania to begin closing down its only oil refinery 
Monday due to a lack of supplies. Officials at the Mazeikiai plant, which 
normally refines 37,000 tons of crude oil a day and has an annual production of 
11.5 million tons, said they planned to use the next few days to overhaul 
installations. But it was then likely the plant's 3,000 workers would be laid 
off, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene said the United 
States has refused her a visa to visit the country next month, saying she could 
come only in June. Washington apparently did not want her in the country during 
the Bush-Gorbachev summit, scheduled for May 30-June 3, she told reporters at 
the airport in Moscow before traveling on to Vilnius after a weeklong trip to 
Norway, Denmark and Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, officials at both the White House and the State Department said 
they have no record of having received a request for a visa from her. 
</P>
<P>
Prunskiene also said she opened a Swedish bank account Monday for Western 
contributions to the republic. She said two donations already had been 
received, including one for $100,000. She declined to identify the donor. 
</P>
<P>
But she said the political support she felt from her trip was as important to 
her as any financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
"We came back feeling that we were not alone, contrary to the wishes of 
somebody who would like to see us frightened," Prunskiene said at a news 
conference. 
</P>

journalist, from Vilnius.

ELECTIONS: IMPEACHED FORMER GOV. EVAN MECHAM IS RUNNING AGAIN. AT THE SAME

<P>
It is politics as usual in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Barnes, a conservative Republican running for governor, has challenged his 
counterparts to submit to lie-detector tests on a variety of unsubstantiated 
items he regularly alleges -- ties to organized crime and dishonesty the most 
discreet among them. He offered to recommend good polygraph examiners. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Steiger, a one-time horse-trader and five-time congressman with a fondness 
for red suspenders, is billing his gubernatorial campaign as "old Sam's last 
roundup" and seriously downplaying his past, which includes an overturned 
conviction for theft by extortion and the controversial shooting of two burros. 
</P>
<P>
Former Gov. Evan Mecham, impeached in 1988 halfway through his first term, is 
running again, still blaming unnamed "power brokers" for his unprecedented fall 
from office and vowing that 10,000 members of a conservative "Mecham Militia" 
will march him to the governor's chair. 
</P>
<P>
And Fife Symington, a wealthy real estate developer, has dispensed with party 
unity and declared war on Mecham -- with the approval of former Sen. Barry 
Goldwater Sr., the legendary conservative who by today's Arizona standards 
would be a pretty fair moderate. 
</P>
<P>
With a flair that is becoming almost predictable, Arizona Republicans are 
celebrating what they call diversity and what gleeful Democrats call 
fratricide. In a state that is frequently -- and erroneously -- thought of as a 
Republican stronghold, the 1990 elections are promising to be as subtle as a 
shoot-out here on high-rise-lined Central Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to make us out as idiots and ready for the fruit farm," Mecham's 
longtime aide Max Hawkins groused recently. 
</P>
<P>
But if Arizona politics is in part an exercise in chaos, it is also a 
demonstration of the changing interests of a maturing Sun Belt state. 
</P>
<P>
A new generation of politicians is hoping to appeal to swarms of young 
high-tech professionals. In contrast to the perception of conservatism and the 
growth-at-any-cost imperative of past years, Arizonans are rallying around the 
complex issues of the environment, transportation woes and struggling schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We're starting to realize -- no offense -- that we don't want to be another 
Los Angeles," said Michael C. Crusa, state director for U.S. Sen. Dennis 
DeConcini (D-Ariz.) 
</P>
<P>
There is also a bipartisan urge to salve the wounds of the last several years 
-- and there are many. 
</P>
<P>
A years-long economic slump has battered the state's ego and threatens to dry 
up its bank accounts. A series of political misfortunes have tarnished its 
image: There was Mecham's impeachment, and the nationally aired debate over his 
cancellation of a paid holiday honoring civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther 
King Jr. Then came the collapse of the savings and loan empire of Phoenix-based 
Charles Keating and allegations that the state's two senators pressured federal 
regulators to go easy on Keating. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a black eye and a bloody nose," said pollster Earl de Berge, whose 
surveys have found widespread dissatisfaction with the state's political 
leadership. "Our image has gone right into the toilet." 
</P>
<P>
While they rank well behind Republicans in voter registration, Democrats here 
are more optimistic than they have been in years -- and the stakes this year 
are higher than they have been in a decade. Arizona stands to gain one and 
perhaps two congressional seats in 1992, and the party that emerges the victor 
this year will be able to draw the boundary lines of those and other seats. 
National party leaders from both sides have promised to make Arizona a 
well-financed battleground. 
</P>
<P>
Ask most Arizona politicians and they swear they would rather trudge through a 
low-key contest. "The passion this year clearly is to stop having Arizona be a 
subject for one-liners on the Carson show," said former Phoenix Mayor Terry 
Goddard, the leading Democratic candidate for governor. 
</P>
<P>
But spice appears to be a perennial ingredient in the mix, a reflection in part 
of the independent streak the state has long cultivated. Where else could a man 
who was impeached by a Legislature led by his own party run again and have a 
better-than-long-shot chance of winning the nomination? 
</P>
<P>
There is, regularly, an almost purposeful contrariness. For example, while 
other states are clamping down on gun ownership, Arizona's Legislature is 
considering loosening restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that binds everyone in Arizona is independent Western thought 
-- you can't tell me not to buy a gun, you can't tell me how to drive a car," 
said Crusa. 
</P>
<P>
The recent right-wing bent to the state's politics, however, seems to have 
arisen more because of the silence of more moderate voices than an actual 
increase in conservatives. Pollster De Berge said that a recent survey 
indicated that fewer Arizonans consider themselves ultra-conservative since the 
Mecham tumult. 
</P>
<P>
This year, following a pattern established throughout the 1980s, Arizona will 
grow at a rate more than double that of the nation as a whole -- faster even 
than California. According to statistics gathered by Arizona-based Valley 
National Bank, more than 800,000 people moved to Arizona between 1980 and 1985; 
by the end of this year, the population is expected to reach 3.7 million. Once 
here, new residents have been extremely mobile and apolitical, denying 
themselves roots and denying politicians any strong sense of where they want to 
be led. 
</P>
<P>
But many civic leaders argue that they see the hastening of a progressive 
movement in the state, with the first signs an increased interest in the 
environment and in activist neighborhood organizations. Hence, the candidates 
for governor are playing to such attitudes and deliberately focusing on 
Arizona's future, not its recent past. 
</P>
<P>
All but one, that is -- Mecham, predictably. Hip-deep in the hubbub again, 
making his sixth run at the governorship, the slightly built, bespectacled 
former car dealer betrays no sense of calamity. Traveling from the piney 
reaches of northern Arizona to the desert towns of the south, he is following 
the same path he did four years ago when he won the governorship by mounting a 
low-key campaign while other candidates slammed each other mercilessly. 
</P>
<P>
Mecham was removed from office in April, 1988, on grounds of misusing public 
funds and obstructing justice. Later, he was acquitted of a separate criminal 
charge of failing to disclose a $350,000 campaign loan. His departure turned 
the state over to then-Secretary of State Rose Mofford, a Democrat who earlier 
this year decided not to run for a full term. 
</P>
<P>
Most times, Mecham, 65, keeps to his major campaign themes -- no new taxes, 
cuts in state spending, strict anti-drug laws, and an emphasis on conservative 
"family issues." But his mix of bite and bitterness is never far from the 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I'm not a perfect candidate," he told several dozen Republicans the 
other day at a noontime lunch forum. "I'm not perfect and when I was in the 
ring with all of the detractors from the outside throwing rocks, it was easy to 
see that Mecham wasn't perfect. 
</P>
<P>
"But golly, it's fun now," he said, his face losing its smile. "It's just real, 
real comfortable to have half a dozen more people in the ring now, and guess 
what? There are no perfect candidates! And I'll be darned if the majority isn't 
going to say, well, old Mecham is perfecter than the others and I'm going to 
win this election." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his efforts, the kinds of comments that marked his abbreviated tenure 
as governor occasionally arise -- most recently when a small Phoenix newspaper 
quoted Mecham as saying that the state's attorney general and a long-time 
nemesis, Bob Corbin, was "one of" Arizona's drug lords. Though Mecham denied 
using those words, Corbin threatened to sue. "A font of endless shame and 
embarrassment," the Arizona Republic called Mecham. 
</P>
<P>
But Mecham has continued to find some success running as a populist against 
insiders and, at least for the primary in September, Mecham is not out of the 
race by any means. Polls show him with the support of 12% to 14% of the 
electorate, but most experts believe him to be twice as strong. And with five 
Republican candidates running, it might not take much more to win. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a good hold on 20%," said pollster De Berge. "There are enough people 
in the Republican primary that 20% to 25% can win." 
</P>
<P>
But few other than Mecham and his supporters give the former governor any 
chance of winning a general election. 
</P>
<P>
Republican Symington and Democrat Goddard are two candidates in the race 
reflective of the new breed of politicians rising here. Generationally and 
stylistically, they are far removed from the Mecham-inspired image of the last 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
Symington, 44, is a political novice and ideological moderate whose career as a 
developer is already being used against him by Democrats playing to 
environmentally conscious voters. He has been running for a year, has won the 
endorsement of Goldwater and wants to help Republican Party politics recover 
from what he calls "a total loss of dignity." 
</P>
<P>
Goddard, a year younger, won election to his fourth term as mayor of largely 
Republican Phoenix last October and is running in the first partisan race of 
his career. In a state where rural and urban friction is widespread, his 
challenge will be to overturn suspicions about him in areas outside his Phoenix 
base, political experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than enunciate specifics, Goddard has spent much of his time traveling 
areas of the state where he is not well known, seeking advice from local 
representatives. It is not always successful; at a recent Flagstaff forum he 
appeared unfamiliar with two of the first issues brought up by questioners. 
</P>
<P>
Both candidates have struck moderate tones, decrying the controversies of the 
Mecham years. 
</P>
<P>
Goddard, at present, has no serious opposition. But besides Mecham, Symington 
faces a troublesome challenge from Steiger, whose curmudgeonly image is far 
from Symington's slick and upper-class persona. 
</P>
<P>
Steiger, who ran for governor in 1982 as a Libertarian, has vulnerabilities 
that in a less-forgiving state would have knocked him from contention. While 
serving as a congressman in 1975, for example, he shot and killed two burros he 
claimed had attacked him. More than a few eyebrows were raised when it was 
learned he had shot the animals in the rear. 
</P>
<P>
He was convicted seven years later for abusive language toward a patrolman who 
stopped him for speeding twice in three days. And, most recently, a conviction 
for theft by extortion -- arising from an alleged threat to a parole board 
member -- was overturned by the Arizona Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
"Colorful is the kindest adjective," he said of himself. 
</P>
<P>
But he remains a winsome and witty campaigner who says his motivation is to run 
against the political consultants and image-makers who have come to dominate 
politics, an approach that some politicians believe could be attractive. 
</P>

With divisive issues such as abortion yet to be thoroughly debated, Republicans

"If we've learned anything in the past half-dozen years," said Goddard,

LIGHT RAIN CREATES HAVOC ON FREEWAYS

A misty shower extended its gentle embrace over the Los Angeles area Monday, 
slowing traffic to a crawl, causing scores of accidents and bringing wind gusts 
to canyons and deserts. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol said its officers were "extremely busy" with 
between 75 and 100 accidents -- about twice as many as normal -- on area 
freeways by early evening. 
</P>
<P>
"There haven't been any fatalities, but there have been several with injuries," 
said CHP Officer Harold Daily. "Almost all of the freeways are affected. 
Traffic has been either stopped, or it has slowed below 30 m.p.h." 
</P>
<P>
As badly as Southern California needs rain, forecasters said Monday's drizzle 
would amount to no more than two-tenths of an inch -- hardly enough to proclaim 
an end to the drought. 
</P>
<P>
Some showers will persist through this afternoon before skies begin clearing, 
said Steve Burback, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which provides 
forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
For all the havoc the rains played with Southland freeways, winds threatened to 
compound motorists' misery with gusts ranging from 30 m.p.h. to 45 m.p.h. in 
canyons and below mountain passes. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service issued a wind advisory for Monday night and today 
in the upper deserts, where gusts are expected to reach 35 m.p.h. with some 
blowing dust and sand. 
</P>
<P>
Visibility will be as low as 200 to 300 feet on occasion, and drivers on 
Interstate 15 to Las Vegas or Interstate 40 to Needles should use caution 
because the winds will affect both highways, the Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's rain, which began about 1 p.m., came compliments of a cold front 
sweeping down from Central California and a developing storm system in the 
upper atmosphere, Burback said. 
</P>
<P>
As the showers move east today, a warming trend will begin, he said.

CHRISTIAN SITES TO CLOSE IN 1-DAY ISRAEL PROTEST

Christian leaders Monday ordered all their holy sites in Israel closed for one 
day Friday to protest Israel's support for a new Jewish settlement in the 
Christian Quarter of Jerusalem's Old City. 
</P>
<P>
"This action endangers the survival of all Christian communities in the Holy 
City," said a statement signed by 10 leaders who represent the major Christian 
sects in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Anger at the April 11 takeover of the building owned by the Greek Orthodox 
Church, in the midst of Easter-week celebrations, was heightened by the 
government's admission Sunday that it paid $1.8 million to help pay for leasing 
the building. 
</P>
<P>
"On Friday, April 27, all Christian holy places in Jerusalem, Nazareth, 
Bethlehem and elsewhere in the Holy Land will close their doors as of 9 a.m. 
and will not reopen until the following day," the church leaders wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Anglican Bishop Samir Kafiti of Jerusalem said he believes the protest will 
mark the first time that all the Christian holy places have been closed. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the State Department said Israel's backing of the new Jewish 
settlement is "deeply disturbing." Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler 
called the settlement "an insensitive and provocative action." 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the U.S. criticism, Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yosef Amihud 
said in a statement: "It is the right of Jews to live in any place and to 
acquire or rent property anywhere in the land of Israel and especially in 
Jerusalem." 
</P>
<P>
The sprawling Hospice of St. John, occupied by 150 Jewish settlers, is next 
door to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, located on the site where Christians 
believe Jesus was entombed and resurrected. 
</P>
<P>
Israel's Housing Ministry said Sunday that it paid $1.8 million to cover 40% of 
the cost of a lease on the building. 
</P>
<P>
The church last week won a court order to evict the settlers, but it has not 
been enforced. The bailiff's office Monday gave the settlers 48 hours' notice 
of eviction at the request of the church, but security sources said the 
settlers could appeal.

NAMIBIA JOINS THE U.N. AS 160TH MEMBER STATE; 
</P>
<P>
THIRD WORLD: THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY SESSION WILL CONCENTRATE ON THE PLIGHT OF 
POOR NATIONS.

Namibia joined the United Nations on Monday as its 160th member state and 
promised, as a small nation, to do "do our little bit" toward maintaining world 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
The admission of the former German colony, ruled by South Africa for the past 
75 years, coincided with the opening of a five-day special session of the 
General Assembly called to seek ways to lift the burden of poverty and a 
$1.3-trillion debt from the developing world. 
</P>
<P>
As the blue, red and green Namibian flag rose between those of Nicaragua and 
New Zealand, the new country's prime minister, Hage G. Geingob, received 
congratulations from Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar and other 
officials of the world organization, which for four decades has been the chief 
advocate of Namibian independence. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference later, Geingob cited his country's place in the ranks of 
the Third World. He said that, while it is better off than many of its African 
neighbors, it will begin its independence with an inherited deficit of $192 
million. He said trade with South Africa will have to continue in spite of 
Namibia's disapproval of its former ruler's system of apartheid but that 
full-fledged diplomatic ties between the two cannot come until apartheid ends. 
</P>
<P>
"Even our food, at the moment, comes from South Africa," Geingob said. 
</P>
<P>
Geingob said he hopes that an international oil embargo applied to Namibia as 
part of South Africa will be lifted soon. Doubt remains about this, however, 
because all ocean shipments must come through Walvis Bay, a deep-water port 
that South Africa has retained in the face of Namibia's claim to the facility. 
</P>
<P>
As debate began on the special session's theme of "revitalization of economic 
growth" of the world's poor nations, an unspoken fear among them was that the 
task of rebuilding Eastern Europe dominates the West's attention today, at the 
expense of the Third World. West German Minister for Economic Cooperation 
Juergen Warnke sought to reassure the latter. 
</P>
<P>
"The upswing that Eastern Europe will experience with the reintroduction of 
market economies will bring demand for goods from the Third World," Warnke 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
The presence here together of Warnke and his East German counterpart, Hans 
Wilhelm Ebeling, was seen as an indication of growing cooperation between the 
two Germanys. The two ministers traveled here on a West German air force plane 
and paid a joint visit to Perez de Cuellar.

WHITE HOUSE WELCOMES SOVIET FLEXIBILITY ON LITHUANIA; 
</P>
<P>
FOREIGN POLICY: BUSH MAY STILL IMPOSE SOME SANCTIONS. BUT A CONFRONTATION IS 
LESS LIKELY.

<P>
The White House on Monday greeted Moscow's latest statements on Lithuania as a 
"welcome sign" of "flexibility" as President Bush considered whether to impose 
limited trade sanctions to punish the Soviets for their oil and gas embargoes 
against the rebellious Baltic republic. 
</P>
<P>
White House officials indicated that Bush will probably make his decision on 
sanctions today as he sorts through a list of options that aides have 
developed. Although all of those options are limited, any step would represent 
the Administration's first direct slap at Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, Bush appeared headed toward imposing some punitive steps to 
protest the Soviet embargo despite the Administration's reluctance to allow 
Lithuania to disturb U.S.-Soviet relations. But on Monday, the latest Soviet 
statements seemed to give Bush an opening to avoid a confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet offer -- to negotiate and to allow Lithuania to keep its declaration 
of independence if it suspends for two years actual steps toward independence 
-- does "appear to show some flexibility," White House spokesman Marlin 
Fitzwater said. "We are hopeful that is the case." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who plans to discuss Lithuania this morning with congressional leaders, 
faces a deadline of sorts because U.S. and Soviet representatives are scheduled 
to begin talks today in Paris on trade and economic cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
"I would anticipate you would be hearing from us very soon," Secretary of State 
James A. Baker III said in a brief press conference Monday after meeting with 
European foreign ministers. "The consultations with allies and Congress will be 
completed very soon." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's National Security Council staff was continuing to analyze what steps he 
might take, and Monday's Soviet statements "will be factored in," a White House 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration appears to be backing away from a confrontation with Moscow 
over Lithuania, Stasy Lozoraitis, Lithuania's representative in Washington, 
said after meeting with State Department officials. "I'm not so sure anything 
will happen," he said. Maybe they will wait for another two or three days. I'm 
very pessimistic about the situation." 
</P>
<P>
Bush already has ruled out the most dramatic steps he could take against the 
Soviets, such as canceling the May 30-June 3 summit meeting with Gorbachev or 
today's round of trade talks or other U.S.-Soviet negotiations on arms control. 
Those sorts of steps, Bush and his aides say, would hurt U.S. interests as much 
as they would hurt the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
What remains are mostly steps to delay progress toward new actions the Soviets 
would like. The most likely candidate for a delay would be the expected move to 
grant "most favored nation" trade status to the Soviets, which makes available 
to them the most favorable trade terms available to any country. Planned 
improvements in airline travel between the two countries and a proposed tax 
treaty could also be slowed. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the White House announced that Soviet Politburo member and key 
Gorbachev ally Alexander Yakovlev had canceled a planned trip to the United 
States. The trip was to have included a previously unannounced meeting Monday 
with Bush. The fact the meeting had been scheduled became public only after a 
reference to it inadvertently was placed on a public schedule. Officials 
declined to explain why the meeting had been kept secret.

SOVIETS SAY CIA OVERESTIMATES SIZE OF THEIR ECONOMY; 
</P>
<P>
FOREIGN AFFAIRS: THE U.S. VIEW OF GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT IS ROSY COMPARED TO 
REALITY, PANEL ASSERTS.

<P>
A panel of high-ranking Soviet economists contended Monday that the CIA has 
consistently overestimated the size of the Soviet economy -- possibly by a 
factor of three -- and has underestimated the proportion that Moscow devotes to 
military spending. 
</P>
<P>
Several members of the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies, the Soviet 
Parliament, were among the group that painted a picture of the Soviet economy 
that was decidedly more bearish than the one that the CIA made public last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The panel, which just completed a four-day seminar with CIA Sovietologists, 
asserted that the Soviet economy is actually only 14% to 28% as large as that 
of the United States, rather than half as large as the U.S. economy, as the CIA 
has estimated for the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
It also said that Soviet military outlays amount to about 25% of the country's 
total output, not the 15% to 17% that the CIA has calculated. By contrast, the 
United States spends only about 5% of its gross national product on defense. 
</P>
<P>
The irony was not lost on the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
"A strange thing is happening here," Grigory Khanin, one of the Soviet 
economists, said with obvious bemusement. "According to the CIA estimates, we 
are in much better shape. So how come we do not recognize our achievement?" 
</P>
<P>
The CIA, however, stood behind its estimates. An agency spokesman noted that 
"there were great differences" at the conference "in the conceptual approach to 
measuring GNP." 
</P>
<P>
One U.S. official familiar with the dispute dismissed the estimate that the 
Soviet economy is only 14% the size of the United States' as "ridiculously 
low." 
</P>
<P>
The meetings marked the first time that CIA analysts and high-ranking Soviet 
economists had met to exchange views on the makeup of and outlook for the 
Soviet economy. The conference was organized by the American Enterprise 
Institute, a conservative think tank. 
</P>
<P>
"Even two years ago, a meeting of this kind would have been unthinkable," 
Nicholas Eberstadt, an institute researcher who served as chairman of the 
meeting, told a press conference. About 17 Soviet economists and economics 
writers attended the session. 
</P>
<P>
Oleg Bogomolov, director of the Institute of Economics of World Socialist 
Systems, agreed. Bogomolov credited glasnost in the Soviet Union for the new 
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"We are more frank that we used to be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet economists on the panel offered these new assessments: 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet economy ranks seventh- or eighth-largest in the world -- behind 
Britain and Italy -- rather than second, as the CIA has argued, according to 
Victor Belkin, economist at the Soviet Commission for Studies of Productive 
Forces and Natural Resources. 
</P>
<P>
Living standards in the Soviet Union were only about one-fifth as high as those 
in the United States in 1985 -- lower than they were in Brazil -- while Soviets 
consume an average one-third as much as Americans, said Yuri Dykhanov, a 
researcher at the Soviet Institute of Economics. 
</P>
<P>
Because of waste and inefficiency, the Soviet Union is losing as much as half 
its industrial output each year and at least 40% of its total agricultural 
production -- and these losses are increasing almost daily, Belkin asserted. 
</P>
<P>
The market for consumer goods already has collapsed, leaving Soviet citizens 
unable to buy even the most basic household items, from sugar and soap to 
appliances. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet delegation offered several possible reasons that the CIA may have 
been overstating the size of the Soviet economy -- mainly that U.S. 
intelligence analysts may not have taken adequate account of how much much 
lower quality standards and productivity are in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the same number of people working as the United States, and our 
educational level is not much lower, so they (the CIA) thought it was simply 
not possible (that the Soviet Union's GNP could be) less than 50% of that of 
the United States," Belkin said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the CIA also failed to take into account such factors as the purchasing 
power of the Soviet ruble and the fact that the Soviet economy is primarily 
based on manufacturing rather than services, which are the major component of 
the U.S. economy.

East Germany is giving money for the first time to assist survivors of the 
Holocaust in which the Nazis murdered 6 million Jews during World War II, the 
official ADN news agency reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
It said the new East German government, reversing 40 years of Communist 
opposition to such gestures, will give $3.65 million to an Israeli foundation 
that helps ease survivors' psychological and physical suffering. 
</P>
<P>
An additional $59,000 will be given to a branch of the foundation that is being 
set up in East Germany, the agency quoted government officials as telling a 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, West Germany has paid over $47 billion in reparations to Israel 
and Jewish survivors of Hitler's drive to erase European Jewry. 
</P>
<P>
Although tiny by comparison and not officially termed reparations, East 
Germany's contribution from its precious hard currency reserves has tremendous 
symbolic value. 
</P>
<P>
The hard-line Communist regime, ousted last year, maintained that it had 
fulfilled its war reparations obligations and had no responsibility for the 
Nazis' persecution of the Jews. 
</P>
<P>
It agreed in November, 1988, to look at humanitarian aid for Holocaust 
survivors but never got as far as agreeing on the sum with the World Jewish 
Congress and other Jewish representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Signaling a change of tack, the newly elected East German Parliament said April 
12 that the country accepts joint moral responsibility and seeks the 
forgiveness of Israel and the world's Jews. 
</P>
<P>
It also offered to find ways to pay compensation to Holocaust survivors. 
</P>
<P>
There are 400 Jews living in East Germany and registered with Jewish 
communities.

This decision adds a new wrinkle to the developing law on artificial 
insemination. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, an estimated 20,000 children a year are born through artificial 
insemination. At least 28 states, including California, have enacted laws 
stating that sperm donors, other than husbands, have no legal rights to a child 
produced through artificial insemination. 
</P>
<P>
But under past high court rulings, unwed fathers who had an extended 
relationship with a woman were deemed to have a constitutional right to claim 
fatherhood of any child that is produced. These rulings involved children 
conceived through sexual intercourse, but the Oregon courts said the same 
principles apply to artificial insemination. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, involving an unmarried Oregon woman and a California man, the 
Oregon state courts said the man had a constitutional right to establish his 
paternity in court because of their long-term friendship. 
</P>
<P>
Without comment Monday, the justices refused to hear the woman's challenge to 
this ruling. 
</P>
<P>
This decision, even if applied nationwide, will likely affect only a small 
percentage of children conceived through artificial insemination. Of the 
estimated 20,000 children born each year through that technique, only about 
1,500 involve unmarried women, according to a study cited in court briefs. And 
the vast majority of these inseminations are arranged through doctor-supervised 
sperm banks where the donors are anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin McIntyre, a community college instructor from Moraga, Calif., said he 
knew Linden Crouch of Ashland, Ore., for 13 years. For several years, he had 
tried unsuccessfully to adopt a child. In 1985, he agreed to donate sperm so 
that Crouch could bear a child. According to McIntyre, he and Crouch talked 
about the baby at length and agreed that he would play an active role in the 
child's life. But Crouch, who says she is a lesbian, denies she made any such 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
After the 1986 birth of Crouch's daughter, McIntyre was cut off from 
establishing any relationship with her. He filed suit in an Oregon court 
seeking to have his paternity established, but a trial judge threw out the 
suit, citing the state's artificial insemination law. It states: "Such donor 
shall have no right, obligation or interest with respect to a child born as a 
result of the artificial insemination." 
</P>
<P>
On a 2-1 vote, an Oregon appeals court reversed that decision and ruled that 
McIntyre had a constitutional right to claim fatherhood. Now, he is entitled to 
a hearing before the trial judge to attempt to prove that he and Crouch agreed 
he would get to see the child regularly. Both the Oregon Supreme Court and now 
the U.S. Supreme Court refused to disturb that ruling. (Crouch vs. McIntyre, 
89-1424.) 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Fontana, a Portland attorney who represented McIntyre, said the Oregon 
law on artificial insemination "was intended to deal with anonymous donors and 
(said) that they had no rights as fathers. It was not intended to deal with a 
situation where two unmarried people get together and agree to have a child." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the California state courts issued a somewhat similar ruling. Though 
the state law said sperm donors do not have paternity rights, the state courts 
said this law covered only artificial insemination supervised by a doctor. 
Therefore, a man who agreed to help a woman become impregnated without a 
doctor's involvement retained the right to seek paternity in court. 
</P>
<P>
In other actions, the court: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rejected an appeal from a former scientologist who said the Church of 
Scientology should be declared a "religious front." This appeal grew out of a 
Los Angeles case in which Larry Wollersheim, the former scientologist, won a 
$2.5-million judgment against the church. The justices are still considering 
the church's appeal of that judgment. (Wollersheim vs. Church of Scientology of 
California, 89-1367.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ordered the Minnesota Supreme Court to reconsider a ruling which said the 
Amish drivers of horse-drawn buggies may not be required to display a bright 
yellow-orange symbol to warn other drivers. The state ruling said such a 
requirement would violate the religious freedom rights of the Amish. But last 
week, the high court said states need not provide religious exemptions to 
general state laws. (Minnesota vs. Hershberger, 89-804.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- Let stand a ruling that could allow as many as 600,000 owners of 1981-85 
General Motors cars with diesel engines to sue the manufacturer. Under federal 
law, the warranties on autos and other consumer products are only good for as 
long as stated in the contract. 
</P>
<P>
Based on that understanding, a federal judge in South Carolina dismissed a 
nationwide class-action suit against GM because the engine problems arose after 
the 24-month or 36-month warranty had expired. But last year, the appeals court 
in Richmond reinstated the suit by ruling that GM appeared to know of the 
problems in advance but kept this information from buyers. Without comment, the 
justices refused to hear GM's appeal. (GMC vs. Carlson, 89-1164.)

BAY AREA HOUSING COSTS HIT POOR HARD, REPORT FINDS; 
</P>
<P>
SHELTER: EXPENSE LEAVES THEM WITH LITTLE FOR OTHER NEEDS. THOUSANDS MORE ARE 
'WORKING POOR' AT RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS.

<P>
The San Francisco-Oakland area may be the worst place in the nation for poor 
people to live because of its high housing costs, according to a report 
released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The high costs are forcing poor households to spend excessive amounts of their 
limited incomes for shelter, the Washington, D.C.-based Center on Budget and 
Policy Priorities said. This forces the poor to divert money from other 
pressing needs, such as food, clothing and health care. 
</P>
<P>
"For poor households, affordable housing has become nearly non-existent in the 
San Francisco-Oakland area," said Ed Lazere, a housing analyst who wrote the 
report. "Extremely high housing costs have left poor renters and homeowners 
with little income for other basic needs." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley and Richmond already have large homeless 
populations on the streets or in temporary shelters. 
</P>
<P>
But the report said there also are many poor Bay Area residents who are "near 
homeless" or at risk of being homeless. These are the "working poor" -- people 
who have part-time or entry-level jobs that allow them to barely make ends 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are a poor family that spends nearly all of your money on housing and 
there is a disruption (in income) such as a layoff or a medical problem, you 
are at risk of becoming homeless," Lazere said. 
</P>
<P>
Bay Area public officials welcomed the release of the report, but said its 
conclusions were not surprising. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been dealing with these problems for 15 years," said Brad Paul, San 
Francisco's deputy mayor of housing. "I think this (report) puts a new 
perspective on the housing issue. Most people don't realize that if you have an 
entry-level job in a fast-food place, you may only be able to afford to live in 
your car." 
</P>
<P>
Alameda County Supervisor Don Perata said the problem has "been pretty obvious 
to a lot of people for a long time. It accounts for our high rate of 
homelessness." 
</P>
<P>
Although affordable housing is needed in the urban core areas of Oakland, 
Berkeley and Alameda, most new housing is built in the suburbs far from job 
centers, Perata said. Also, most construction in the inner cities has merely 
"gentrified" low-income neighborhoods and chased out longtime residents, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The report, based on 1985 government statistics -- the most recent available -- 
concludes: 
</P>
<P>
61% of all poor renter households -- or 39,900 households -- spent at least 70% 
of income on housing costs. 
</P>
<P>
82% of poor homeowners spent at least 30% of their income on housing, which is 
the federal maximum for affordability, while nearly 50% of them spent at least 
70% of their incomes on housing. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the area's 101,700 poor households are either in San Francisco or 
Oakland, with the remainder in other parts of Alameda County and Contra Costa, 
San Mateo or Marin counties. 
</P>
<P>
Latino and black communities, on average, paid a higher percentage of their 
income for housing than white residents. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's 1990 "fair market rent" 
for a two-bedroom apartment in San Francisco and San Mateo and Marin counties 
was $887 a month, the highest in the nation, the report noted. 
</P>
<P>
The "fair market rent" in Alameda and Contra Costa counties was $736 a month, 
the 10th highest for U.S. metropolitan areas. 
</P>
<P>
Government assistance through subsidized housing programs is not available for 
most eligible people, with some 56,000 households on waiting lists as of last 
November, the report stated. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall's Loma Prieta earthquake exacerbated the problem, destroying or 
damaging at least 5,000 units of low- and moderate-income housing and leaving 
8,000 people in the area without homes. In Oakland and Berkeley, many 
residential hotels have not been reopened. In San Francisco, officials said the 
city has made substantial progress keeping residential hotels open. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's report did not include the San Jose area or Santa Clara County, which 
were addressed in an earlier report by the same group. That report, released in 
1988, said the housing woes of low-income people in San Jose were nearly as bad 
as in the San Francisco -- Oakland area. 
</P>
<P>
"While the housing crisis is national in scope, it is particularly bad in the 
Bay Area," Lazere said.

LIZ TAYLOR PUT ON VENTILATOR AFTER BIOPSY FOR PNEUMONIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Elizabeth Taylor is breathing with the assistance of a ventilator after 
undergoing surgery aimed at determining the cause of pneumonia that has kept 
her hospitalized for three weeks, her physicians said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Academy Award-winning actress was admitted to St. John's Hospital in Santa 
Monica last week for treatment of the pneumonia, and was listed in serious 
condition in the hospital's intensive-care unit on Monday, her doctors said in 
a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
"She is seriously ill and on Sunday underwent a lung biopsy to further 
determine the cause of her pneumonia," the physicians' statement said. "After 
surgery, her breathing is now being assisted by a ventilator. 
</P>
<P>
"Her condition is presently stabilizing, and her physicians are pleased with 
her progress." 
</P>
<P>
The statement provided no additional details of Taylor's condition, and 
hospital officials declined to comment beyond the statement. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa del Favero, a New York City publicist for Taylor, said the actress is 
"seriously ill, but she's not on her deathbed. We're not talking about anything 
terminal." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's doctors expect to have results of the biopsy by Thursday, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Del Favero said Taylor's four children -- Maria Burton-Carson, Liza Todd-Tivey 
and Christopher and Michael Wilding -- were with her at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Taking a biopsy on the actress is called Sutton's law in medicine, after 
legendary holdup man Willie (the Actor) Sutton who said he robbed banks 
"because that's where the money is," said Dr. John G. Mohler, a pulmonary 
disease specialist at the USC School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't know what the trouble is, you grab a biopsy and study it, because 
that's where the problem is," Mohler explained. "The problem is not easily 
found another way. 
</P>
<P>
"You study the biopsy because that will dictate your therapy. If they (took a 
biopsy), I'm sure she was not responding to antibiotics." 
</P>
<P>
Mohler said Taylor's doctors are taking a prudent course by placing her on a 
ventilator. 
</P>
<P>
She suffered a near-fatal bout of pneumonia in 1961, and Mohler said "it would 
seem that there is something basically wrong with her lung structure or 
function. When she gets pneumonia, apparently it's more severe." 
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing that he has no personal familiarity with the actress's case, Mohler 
said he does not "blame her doctors for being conservative. Placing her on a 
ventilator would be a prudent and conservative thing to do, even if she didn't 
have any difficulty. It may just be a precautionary step in this case." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 58, entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital in Marina del Rey on April 
10 suffering what her publicist then described as a "severe sinus infection." 
She was transferred to St. John's April 16 when her condition worsened. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Patricia Murray, an infectious disease specialist, said in a statement last 
week that Taylor had pneumonia and was "being treated intravenously with 
antibiotics and will remain hospitalized (indefinitely)." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor has been plagued with health problems for years, particularly recurring 
back troubles that began with a fall from a horse during filming of the 1945 
movie "National Velvet." 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, she acknowledged a 35-year addiction to sleeping pills and painkillers 
prescribed for a wide range of health problems. Taylor has been treated for 
alcohol and drug abuse problems at the Betty Ford Clinic.

ATTACK WAS 5TH ON HOUSEHOLD IN SANTA ANA

Eight-year-old Carlos Alvarez lay in a narrow hospital bed Monday, alongside 
other children in the pediatric intensive care unit at UCI Medical Center. He 
had IV needles in both arms and bandages over his chest and stomach. His hands 
were tied down so he wouldn't move and possibly injure himself. 
</P>
<P>
He slept soundly, only a few hours after doctors performed surgery to determine 
if a bullet from a drive-by shooting Sunday night had damaged his lungs and 
stomach. 
</P>
<P>
Reina Alvarez of Santa Ana, mother of the boy they call Carlitos, said that 
when he came out of surgery she almost broke down at the sight of her son. 
</P>
<P>
"Mijito (my little son), I told him, I am here. You are not alone," she said, 
her eyes growing moist again as she recalled the scene. "I told him all the 
things a mother can say. The nurse told me that even though he could not 
respond, he understood me anyway." 
</P>
<P>
The boy's injuries are the last straw for the Alvarez family, who have been 
victims of violence, apparently gang-related, five times during the past 13 
months. Each time, said Reina Alvarez, police had told them there was little 
that could be done except for the family to move. 
</P>
<P>
The night had been a long one for Alvarez, who only seven days before had given 
birth through Cesarean section to her fourth child. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday night, she had been lying in her bed at the sprawling house where she, 
her husband and four children live with other relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos, her oldest child, was watching television with his grandmother and 
others in the living room. Then, the calm of the night was shattered when a 
bullet pierced the walls of the house. In seconds, those in the living room 
were on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Reina and the others who had been in the other parts of the house ran into the 
living room and saw Carlos on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics came within about half an hour, family members said, and began 
working on the child. Alvarez herself began hemorrhaging and her relatives 
would not allow her to accompany her son to UCI Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
But after a sleepless night, she went to the hospital at 7 a.m. Doctors 
operated on Carlos, she said, to examine whether the bullet had done any damage 
to his lungs, his stomach or any other organs. 
</P>
<P>
"They said he will be fine," she said. "But he won't be fine. He was already 
traumatized, and I'm afraid he will be even worse now." 
</P>
<P>
Carlos had been troubled by the four other violent incidents directed at the 
family home since March of last year. 
</P>
<P>
In the first incident, Reina's brother, Carlos, was shot in the arm outside the 
house. In April, 1989, Reina's nephew was shot in the chest. Later that year, 
someone hurled a homemade bomb into a sleeping girl's bedroom at the house. The 
bomb did not explode, but sparked a fire. Then, on Dec. 23, shots were fired 
into the house, smashing several windows but not hitting anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Young Carlos had been frightened by the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
"He is afraid to go into some of the rooms by himself," his mother said. "He 
won't go to the bathroom alone. He sleeps in the same room as my mother, and if 
she is not ready to go to bed, he will not go in there alone either." 
</P>
<P>
The house is owned by Reina's brother Carlos and his wife, Ana Maria, who have 
lived in Santa Ana 11 years. Ana Maria said her husband is in jail right now, 
accused of selling drugs, although she contends that it was a case of mistaken 
identity. 
</P>
<P>
Family members say they have never seen the faces of those who have shot at 
them or committed other acts of violence against them. 
</P>
<P>
Antonio Torres, 29, a resident of the house and friend of Reina Alvarez, said 
the house is apparently being singled out because members of the Middleside 
gang "hang out" both in front and behind the residence at night. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said his 15-year-old nephew is also a member of the gang, but is no 
longer living at home because he was taken to Orange County Juvenile Hall 
several weeks ago on suspicion of a gang-related homicide. The case against the 
youth is pending. Police said the youth is charged in connection with the death 
of a rival Lopers gang member. 
</P>
<P>
The injured boy has only been in this country two years, emigrating from Mexico 
City with his grandparents to join his parents and other family members. They 
live together to save money, Reina said. Now, the family will have to separate, 
she said, and it will probably mean leaving Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter where you go in this city, there are gangs," Reina said.

Police said Monday that the gang halted the train in a Marseilles suburb by 
placing concrete blocks across the tracks. The train, heading for the 
southwestern city of Montpellier, was moving slowly when the driver saw the 
barrier.

<P>
CRIME: TWO MEN CONVICTED IN TWO PARTICULARLY BRUTAL MURDER CASES IN 1973 ARE UP 
FOR PAROLE MAY 17. OFFICIALS ARGUE THAT NEITHER SHOULD BE RELEASED.

<P>
The two killers came from different backgrounds, but their paths to crime bore 
striking similarities, and the murders they committed one day apart in 1973 are 
still considered among the most vicious in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Michael Sesma, an enforcer for a drug syndicate, was sentenced to life 
in prison for beating one man to death and fatally shooting another as he 
begged for his life. 
</P>
<P>
John Benjamin Tidwell, a pimp and bounty hunter from Ohio, robbed an Orange 
County teen-ager, then took him to a remote canyon area and shot him twice in 
the back with a sawed-off shotgun. The youth, mortally wounded by the 
double-ought buckshot, bled to death on the side of the road. Tidwell was also 
sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Now, seventeen years later, Sesma and Tidwell are both scheduled for parole 
hearings May 17. 
</P>
<P>
Both men, who have been turned down for parole before, say they have been 
rehabilitated and are ready for life on the outside. Orange County Sheriff Brad 
Gates and other law enforcement officials, however, are pleading with state 
prison officials not to release them. 
</P>
<P>
"Both of these crimes were very blatant, and to release these convicted 
murderers on parole would certainly create a danger to the citizens of the 
county," Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
"We vehemently oppose their parole," said Jay Moseley, an Orange County deputy 
district attorney who represents the district attorney's office at state parole 
hearings. "I think they are extremely dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Sesma, 38, formerly of Albuquerque, N.M., first became eligible for parole in 
1981. He has been turned down in seven previous hearings before the state Board 
of Prison Terms. Tidwell, 41, formerly of Warren, Ohio, became eligible in 1984 
and has been turned down twice. 
</P>
<P>
Both have pleaded passionately for their release from the California Men's 
Colony East at San Luis Obispo. Coincidentally, officials say, both have 
trained as jewelers and hope to pursue that profession if released. 
</P>
<P>
"What I need is that one chance to prove to you, my family and most of all to 
me that I can be a productive human being in the community," Tidwell wrote in a 
July 21, 1989, letter to Walter W. Charamza, the Orange County Superior Court 
judge who sentenced him for the Dec. 13, 1973, murder of Harold Reinhart, 18, 
of Midway City. 
</P>
<P>
But Charamza, now retired, has recommended that Tidwell remain incarcerated 
indefinitely, saying in a letter to prison officials: "The murder for which he 
was convicted was planned, committed in cold blood and done in the commission 
of a robbery." 
</P>
<P>
In statements to prison psychiatrists, Sesma has said he regrets the murders of 
Vaudra Dewey Nunley, 28, and Rue Eugene Steele, 29, on Dec. 12, 1973, and that 
he believes he can safely be returned to society. 
</P>
<P>
"He views himself as someone who got involved with the wrong people," an Orange 
County Probation Department official wrote in a pre-sentencing report in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
However, James K. Turner, the Orange County Superior Court sentencing judge, 
has asked that Sesma never be released. 
</P>
<P>
"These were brutal and horrible killings," Turner, also now retired, wrote 
after sentencing Sesma in 1976. "I sentenced this defendant . . . so that he 
will be incarcerated as long as possible." 
</P>
<P>
The lives of Tidwell and Sesma, both of whom declined interviews, took many 
similar turns, according to Orange County Superior Court records. Both were 
U.S. Marines who saw combat duty in Vietnam during the late 1960s. Both grew up 
in working-class families. And both fell in with criminal elements during the 
early 1970s when the drug subculture was flourishing. 
</P>
<P>
Their crimes also had similarities. Tidwell's victim was a burglary suspect who 
was high on drugs the last night of his life, court records show. Sesma's two 
victims were drug dealers who were part of an Orange County-based marijuana 
syndicate. 
</P>
<P>
Sesma was paid $2,000 for his role in the killings. Tidwell was to be paid half 
the $35,000 he took from his victim. However, Tidwell kept all the money that 
Reinhart, his victim, had taken in a burglary. 
</P>
<P>
Court evidence would show that Reinhart was a "naive and vulnerable" young man 
who fell into a trap set by a woman he had begun living with three weeks before 
his death. The woman arranged for Tidwell to rob Reinhart of his share of the 
money from a recent burglary in Oregon, court records show. Reinhart and two 
female accomplices had taken a total of $98,000 hidden in the freezer of a 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Tidwell by that time was a seasoned criminal. He was under investigation in 
Warren, Ohio, for the July, 1973, shooting deaths of wealthy industrialist 
Walter Holmquist, 78, and his wife Dorothy, 77, during a burglary at their 
home. Tidwell was convicted five years later in the case. He killed Dorothy 
Holmquist first, then fatally shot her husband, who was crippled and walked 
with a cane. 
</P>
<P>
Tidwell was living in Las Vegas and working as a bounty hunter when the woman 
enlisted his help in robbing Reinhart. Tidwell rented a car under an assumed 
name, drove to Orange County and met with the woman and Reinhart at her Midway 
City home. 
</P>
<P>
The woman had told Reinhart that Tidwell was a "fence" who would launder 
Reinhart's stolen money. Instead, Tidwell pulled a sawed-off 12-gauge shotgun 
and demanded all the money. Then he drove Reinhart to a remote spot in Santiago 
Canyon, forced him to his knees and shot him twice in the back, court records 
show. An autopsy showed that Reinhart bled to death from his wounds. Tidwell 
returned to Las Vegas and eventually to Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Ohio, Tidwell kidnaped a 19-year-old woman in May, 1974, and forced her 
into his prostitution business. He was convicted a few months later of assault 
with intent to commit rapes in the case and sentenced to Ohio state prison for 
five to 15 years. While in prison, he confided to a cellmate about the Reinhart 
murder in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Those admissions led to his arrest and conviction in 1978 of Reinhart's murder. 
He was convicted a short time afterward of the Ohio double murders. His life 
sentence for that crime runs concurrently with the California sentence. With 
credit for time served in California, Tidwell also will be eligible for parole 
if returned to Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
In a pre-sentencing report in 1978, an Orange County probation officer wrote 
that Tidwell exhibited "a pattern of violent conduct representing a serious 
danger to society. If not imprisoned, the defendant would be a danger to others 
within the community." 
</P>
<P>
Prison psychiatrists have labeled Tidwell a sociopath with "a severe antisocial 
behavior disorder." But in a 1989 evaluation, prison staff psychologist Robert 
K. Bolin described Tidwell as "bright and friendly" and said he exhibited no 
further evidence of a psychological disorder. Bolin said Tidwell had done 
"well" in the prison system and that he seemed psychologically fit. Tidwell is 
engaged to be married a third time. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that I am 41 years old, getting married to a wonderful woman who is 
very respectable in the community, my showing of maturity and growth over the 
years of my rehabilitation and having been in prison for 15 straight years, 
should all add up to something worthwhile," Tidwell wrote in his appeal to 
Charamza. 
</P>
<P>
Sesma had been serving as an enforcer and distributor for Orange County 
marijuana kingpin John Solis in 1973 when Solis ordered him and an accomplice 
to "hold" Nunley, a fellow drug ring member who purportedly was planning to 
kidnap Solis and his family. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors later discovered that Sesma's accomplice, Michael L. Thompson, had 
fabricated the kidnap threat. Thompson had wanted to get Nunley out of the way 
so that he could be with Nunley's wife. 
</P>
<P>
On the day of the murders, Sesma and Thompson confronted at gunpoint Nunley and 
Steele, a reputed drug dealer from Boston who happened to be in the wrong place 
at the wrong time. Nunley and Steele were tied up at Solis' house and viciously 
beaten. Steele died during the beating. Nunley was presumed dead when he and 
Steele tossed him into the trunk of a car and drove him to a Tustin residence 
to bury him. When they opened the trunk, however, the men discovered that 
Nunley was still alive. 
</P>
<P>
Sesma took a .22-caliber pistol and aimed it at Nunley. Randall Pierce, who had 
been commissioned to dig a grave for the victims, later testified in court that 
Nunley "raised his hands to shield his face and simply said, 'I don't want to 
die.' Sesma said only, 'Close your eyes, man,' then shot him in the forehead." 
</P>
<P>
The bodies were buried in a grave behind the Tustin home. The murders did not 
come to light until nearly a year later, when an informant tipped off police. 
In 1975, Sesma, Thompson and Solis were convicted of murder and other charges 
in a six-month trial that at the time ranked as Orange County's longest 
criminal proceeding. Only Solis has since been paroled. 
</P>
<P>
Turner, the judge who sentenced Sesma, said he regretted not being able to send 
Sesma to the gas chamber. The death penalty had not yet been reinstituted. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought I would see the day when I was sorry I could not sentence 
someone to death," Turner told Sesma. 
</P>
<P>
In court testimony and later interviews with psychiatrists, Sesma claimed that 
Thompson committed the killings and that he was an unwilling participant. He 
said he fell in with the drug crowd because he needed money to support a wife 
and infant daughter. Sesma called his involvement with Solis' organization "the 
biggest mistake" in his life. 
</P>
<P>
Sesma's parents and siblings in New Mexico say they believe that he has been 
punished enough. 
</P>
<P>
"We want him back home," Sesma's sister, Roberta Sesma, said in a recent 
telephone interview from her home in Albuquerque. "He's in our prayers every 
night. He's a very good person. He's a loving person. Every chance we get we go 
to see him." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors describe Sesma as "cold-blooded" and find it difficult to believe 
that he is rehabilitated. 
</P>
<P>
Robert D. Chatterton, now an Orange County criminal defense attorney, 
prosecuted the case against Sesma and the others. Chatterton said that although 
Sesma says he regrets the killings, his refusal to admit that he committed them 
is a sign that he is not ready to be released. 
</P>
<P>
"That to me is one of the crucial things he must come to grips with," 
Chatterton said. "He was the one who personally killed both of the men." 
</P>

Criminal history: In 1971, Tidwell pleaded guilty to using a stolen credit card 
in Garden Grove and was sentenced to one year's informal probation. Two years 
later in Ohio, he was convicted of attempted rape and sentenced to state 
prison. He was charged in the 1973 double murder of a wealthy Ohio 
industrialist and his wife, but his 1974 trial ended in a hung jury. While he 
was in an Ohio prison serving time for the attempted rape conviction, law 
enforcement authorities learned of his involvement in the 1973 killing of an 
18-year-old Midway City man. Orange County prosecutors filed murder charges in 
the case in 1977, 
</P>
<P>
and Tidwell was convicted of the killing by a jury on Oct. 5, 1978. He was then 
retried and convicted of the double murder in Ohio.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; 
</P>
<P>
GIRL, 9, GETS AWARD FOR ACTIONS IN FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON TEEBOOM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 9-year-old Costa Mesa girl who saved her mother's life by calling 911 as a 
fire was raging through their house was recognized as a heroine Monday by the 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
April Thousand was presented with the Recognition of Valor, the first such 
award the department has given, in a ceremony in which Costa Mesa Police 
Officers Bill Adams and Ron Tuso received Medals of Valor for their efforts in 
the rescue. April's mother, Linda Thousand, was sound asleep on the ground 
floor of their two-story home when the fire broke out about 10:30 p.m., on Feb. 
20, and she did not awaken when her daughter called to her from upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that the award will be given to people whose actions merit them and 
that there is no set schedule for them. 
</P>
<P>
April described the night of the fire in an interview Sunday night. She said 
that she had awakened in her second-story bedroom that night around 10:30 and 
had gotten out of bed and switched on the television. Then she noticed that the 
hall light, usually on all night, seemed to be off. 
</P>
<P>
And then she smelled smoke. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to get down the staircase, but it was hot," April said. "I tried to 
call Mom, but she wouldn't wake up." 
</P>
<P>
She ran to a phone upstairs and dialed 911. 
</P>
<P>
"The operator told me to get out of the house, but I said, 'I can't; I'm 
upstairs.' " Choking, she raced to a window, flung it open and began gasping 
for air. A neighbor who had jumped over the fence began yelling at her to jump. 
"I thought there was going to be a net, but there wasn't," April said. 
</P>
<P>
She waited at the window until another neighbor got a ladder and leaned it 
against the house. Then she climbed down. She ran to a neighbor's house to call 
her father, who lives two blocks away. "I couldn't believe how black she was," 
Don Thousand recalled. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, police officers Adams and Tuso, who were the first to arrive 
on the scene, kicked in the front door and crawled into the house, police said. 
Adams made his way into Linda Thousand's bedroom, where he found her asleep. 
She was awakened, and the officers took her outside. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen firefighters arrived at 10:42, fire officials said. The fire began with 
a pot that had been left on the stove, and it gutted the kitchen and caused 
smoke damage throughout the house. 
</P>
<P>
April's mother, who said she had stressed calling 911 and remaining calm in a 
fire, said she was pleased with her daughter's conduct: "It's a great thing she 
did." LEON TEEBOOM

OFFICIALS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS ABOUT FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
City officials will meet tonight with residents concerned that the Fire 
Department took too long to arrive at a St. Patrick's Day fire that killed a 
woman and severely burned her boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the residents have alleged that the Fire Department took more than 20 
minutes to arrive at the early-morning fire at a 13th Street duplex that killed 
Gay Kenyon, 24, and injured Ralph Royston, 35. However, city records show that 
only four minutes elapsed between the fire's being reported and firefighters' 
arrival on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Area residents have also complained that the 911 emergency telephone number was 
busy and that the firefighters' efforts were hampered because they did not have 
the proper equipment to attach their hoses to fire hydrants. 
</P>
<P>
In response to these complaints, City Manager Robert Nelson is scheduled to 
meet with residents at 7:30 p.m. in the City Council chambers. Officials from 
the Fire and Police departments as well as the City Council and city 
administration are expected to attend the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said that there is no evidence in city records of inadequate performance 
by the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
But one resident, Paula Weber, said she has spent many hours investigating the 
complaints and believes that the Fire Department's response was inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
"I have called so many people -- hundreds," Weber said. "I have been on the 
phone nonstop for a week calling clerks, computer operators, managers, 
hospitals, the Fire Department, the city manager . . . just trying to find out 
what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Fire Battalion Commander Mike McCoy, who directed the department's response to 
the March 17 fire, said it is not uncommon for witnesses to be confused about 
the amount of time elapsed during an emergency. The fire station is about five 
blocks from the site of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really stressful watching a house burn up," he said. "I'm sure time seems 
like it's just dragging by, but that's just perception. The people who are 
alleging that it took us an inordinate amount of time to get to the fire are 
simply misinformed." 
</P>
<P>
McCoy said he will attend the meeting to discuss the department's operation, 
its 911 emergency telephone number and residents' other concerns about the 
fire. MICHELLE NICOLOSI

TOY POLICE CAR TO AID IN ANTI-DRUG EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Police Department will add a miniature, remote-controlled police car to its 
arsenal to help spread an anti-drug message to young students. 
</P>
<P>
The four-foot-long police car has a two-way transmitter that allows the car to 
seemingly talk and listen to students while an officer operates the car from a 
short distance away. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council unanimously agreed to buy the robotic car using $6,550 in 
community donations earmarked for it. The department expects to receive the new 
car in about a week. 
</P>
<P>
"It really is an attention-getter," Sgt. Joe Klein said. The operator can drive 
the car around, make it do wheelies and even make it dance to music, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The car will be a tool for police officers to spread an anti-drug message to 
students from kindergarten through fourth grades, Klein said. The department 
might also use the car to break the ice with young crime victims, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Little kids will feel more comfortable talking to a robot or a little car like 
this" rather than an adult police officer, he said.

YOUTH EVENT BENEFITS CITY HOMELESS

<P>
Holly Reed could have been mistaken for a department store salesgirl as she 
held up a sweater and enthusiastically explained to a skeptical woman how 
flattering the color would look on her. 
</P>
<P>
But Reed, a junior at Kennedy High School in La Palma, was not working at a 
women's apparel counter. She was one of 15 students at the Civic Center Plaza 
on Monday handing out sack lunches, toothbrushes, new socks and used clothing 
to about 175 homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
The event was sponsored by the Youth Volunteer Council of Orange County and the 
United Way Youth Organization, whose members are high school students 
interested in community service. The students held a car wash last month and 
raised $500 to buy food and other items for the giveaway. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good feeling to be able to give a helping hand to people. It's 
important," said Reed, 17, as she cheerfully handed out clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Organizer Sean Todd said the occasion was meant to coincide with National Youth 
Service Day this Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Events like this put them more in touch with the community," Todd said. 
"Education is not just sitting in the classroom, it's being out here, seeing 
what's going on, and trying to help out." 
</P>
<P>
The lesson was not lost on Lydia Puente, a 16-year-old junior from Saddleback 
High School in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like they need our help," Puente said. "People ignore the homeless and 
don't pay attention to them except for on Christmas and Thanksgiving. They are 
homeless all year." 
</P>
<P>
Yeon Ko, a junior at University High School in Irvine, was busy placing ham and 
cheese sandwiches inside paper bags and said it felt great to be helping out. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that what we're doing today won't make a big difference but maybe 
it'll encourage other kids to get involved on a regular basis, then we could 
really help a lot," said Ko, 17. 
</P>
<P>
For many of the homeless people who waited in line under a slight drizzle, the 
goods came as a welcome surprise. 
</P>
<P>
George Ellithorpe, 61, is known as "Grandpa" on the streets, where he has lived 
for six years. He said he was impressed by the students' effort. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the biggest events we've had out here in quite some time," 
Ellithorpe said as he held a sack lunch in one hand and a new pair of socks in 
the other. "It looks like the young people are finally getting wise to what's 
going on. It all helps, believe me. Everyone who is on the street needs help 
and we all appreciate these young people. Things like this help us to survive."

ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WINS $1,600 AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new program to encourage academic achievement recently brought Handy 
Elementary School a $1,600 grant from the California Educational Initiatives 
Fund. The school was one of 13 in the region to receive awards for innovative 
educational programs.

Under Handy's new program, first- through sixth-graders don't have to be 
straight-A students to earn a "varsity letter" in academics. Doing homework and 
reading extra books can earn them the 100 points they need to receive a Handy 
varsity letter -- a red-and-white H -- for academic achievement. 
</P>
<P>
The first winners will receive their letters and a certificate of merit at a 
special assembly at the end of the school year. Students who continue to 
fulfill requirements will win a gold bar for each year, Principal Andrew Fisher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Not everyone can throw a touchdown pass and not everyone can get all A's, but 
everyone can read 50 books if they put their minds to it," Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
The award is part of $780,000 to be distributed statewide this year by the 
California Educational Initiatives Fund. Awards for innovative programs were 
distributed to schools in Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties.

MAN SHOOTS, KILLS HIMSELF IN STANDOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a 95-minute standoff with sheriff's deputies, a man shot and killed 
himself, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Leon Phillips, 57, died of a self-inflicted gunshot to the head outside 
the front door of his house in the 9300 block of Batavia Street, Sheriff's 
Department Lt. Richard J. Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began about 8:45 p.m. Sunday when Phillips' wife went to police to 
complain that her husband had beaten her, was emotionally unstable and had been 
drinking, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Phillips walked out of the garage door but went back inside the 
house after he saw that deputies had surrounded his home, the lieutenant said. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with deputies, Phillips said he had a gun, was not 
coming out and challenged them to come and get him, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
After the standoff with deputies, Phillips walked out of the house, shouted his 
wife's name, placed the gun to the side of his head and fired one round, Olson 
said.

ARSON ARREST MADE AFTER 2 HOUSE FIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man was arrested on suspicion of arson Monday after firefighters put out two 
small house fires that authorities believe were started by Molotov cocktails. 
</P>
<P>
David Lopez, 20, of Orange allegedly threw glass containers with flammable 
liquid at occupied houses in the 400 and 500 block of North Lemon Street about 
2 a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Police Sgt. Robert Gustafson said none of the occupants of the houses were 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
Damage was estimated at $5,000 to one of the houses, and at $150 to the other. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Lopez about two hours after the fires, using a description of 
the getaway vehicle provided by a witness, Gustafson said. Lopez was being held 
in Orange County Jail on suspicion of arson of inhabited structures, Gustafson 
said. His bail was set at $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Gustafson said no motive has been established. The police investigation is 
continuing.

RUNOFF CANDIDATE SUES FOE FOR $6 MILLION

Council candidate Jim Serles has filed a $6-million libel suit against opponent 
Doug Drummond, claiming Drummond defamed him with claims that Serles struck 
"back room deals" and "sold his vote" while he was chairman of the city's 
Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is campaign literature circulated by Drummond before the April 10 
election, which Serles was heavily favored to win. Drummond forced Serles into 
a June runoff. 
</P>
<P>
The literature depicted a newspaper clipping saying that Serles was under 
investigation by the state Fair Political Practices Commission, when no such 
article existed, the suit said. The literature also included a photo of Serles 
emblazoned with the words "For Sale."

Sixteen-year-old Tammy Fisher doesn't know how she will get through this 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
One way or another, the Woodbridge High School sophomore figures she will be 
traumatized when she confronts "the list" -- the feared, revered, dreaded list 
that will reveal who has been chosen for the cheerleading squad next fall. 
</P>
<P>
"If I don't make it I'm going to cry, cry, cry," Fisher said. "I'm an emotional 
person, and I cry a lot anyway, but I will cry this time." 
</P>
<P>
In the high school order of things, being selected as a cheerleader or song 
leader ranks with making the football team or winning a student body election. 
Its importance to students and sometimes parents was illustrated this month 
when a set of Woodbridge High parents challenged the school policy that 
prevented their daughter, a two-year co-captain of the cheerleading squad, from 
auditioning again this year. That policy prohibits students who receive an F in 
any class from being cheerleaders. The same standard does not apply to football 
players or other athletes. 
</P>
<P>
The parents' challenge has persuaded the school board to reconsider the "no F 
rule," as it is called, at its next general meeting May 1. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, the important thing for the group of girls at Woodbridge is the 
posting of the list, the result of Monday's tryouts before a team of hired 
judges from the National Cheerleading Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"Some guys will show up with cameras just to catch your reaction," said Vicky 
Biggs, 16, a junior. "They post it in three different places around school 
because the crowd gets to be so big you have to jump to be able to see 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Cops, the principal at Woodbridge High School, has tried to soften the 
blow by using numbers instead of names. 
</P>
<P>
"We now post it by numbers and do it later in the afternoon so we don't have 
everyone running out of class straight to the list," Cops said. 
</P>
<P>
Even the parents share in the ordeal, beyond the $700 to $1,000 it takes to 
sponsor a cheerleader for a year. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot understand what this means to the kids unless you're a parent," 
said Janna Hobbs, an Irvine mother of a current cheerleader. "During this time 
of year, every time they walk by a mirror, or a window, they'll check 
themselves out on a routine. They practice in their bedrooms, in the living 
rooms. Our society has created this image of a cheerleader and for the kids, it 
takes over their lives." 
</P>
<P>
"At best, it's traumatic," said Peter Jacobs, another parent. "Nothing else 
matters right now." 
</P>
<P>
Most parents seem to agree that regardless of how the students react to the 
pressure, it's a learning experience. 
</P>
<P>
Cheerleading "certainly is a big thing for the kids, but it's the same whether 
it's cheerleading, whether it's high school athletics, or whether it's being 
chosen for the school play," said Leonard Taub, another Irvine parent whose 
daughter is a cheerleader. "There's going to be some of this in life no matter 
where you go. It's OK to take some lumps in competition. That's the way life 
is."

COUNTY IS AWASH IN EMERGENCIES; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: A SERIES OF CRISES HAS HAD OFFICIALS DECLARING STATES OF EMERGENCY 
ONE RIGHT ON TOP OF ANOTHER. THREE WERE SIMULTANEOUSLY IN EFFECT LAST WEEK. 
</P>

<P>
If it sometimes seems that Orange County is bouncing from one emergency to the 
next, that's because it's true -- at least on paper. 
</P>
<P>
The past six months have featured an unusual string of emergency declarations 
by the county government, culminating in a brief moment last week when the 
county had three such declarations in place at the same time. Even among 
longtime county leaders, it was an occasion for pause. 
</P>
<P>
"These things sure are coming fast," said Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, who has 
spent 16 years on the board and could not recall a previous time when the 
county had three officially declared emergencies overlapping. "I don't think 
there's much we can do about it. I mean, we can't stop emergencies from 
happening," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The recent flurry started last fall when the Mediterranean fruit fly came to 
the county. Once the bug showed up in county fruit, the Board of Supervisors 
quickly approved a state of emergency to protect the county against lawsuits 
that might result from the aerial spraying of malathion. 
</P>
<P>
Then, with that infestation still in full swing, an oil tanker ran over its own 
anchor and leaked 394,000 gallons of Alaskan crude oil on the Orange County 
shore. 
</P>
<P>
And just as the oil spill emergency waned last week, a persistent measles 
epidemic pushed health experts to take action. County Health Officer L. Rex 
Ehling declared the emergency on the morning of April 16, about 24 hours before 
supervisors voted to end the oil spill emergency. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been with the county for about seven years, and I don't recall anything 
like it," said Marilee Miller, senior emergency management coordinator for the 
county. "It's pretty unusual, that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
Why the county finds itself in the midst of so many emergencies is a matter of 
some disagreement, though all parties agree that the biggest reason is simply a 
run of bad luck. In addition to the emergencies themselves, however, the 
process for formally declaring them has become more widely used in recent 
years, making them a more common occurrence than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"People are becoming more aware of what the emergency declaration provides," 
said Christine Boyd, manager of the county's Emergency Management Division. 
"When you get people who are more aware of the process, you get more people 
making use of it." 
</P>
<P>
A litigation-prone public also makes county officials more wary about doing 
anything that might increase the county's legal liability, Riley added, so the 
thought of refusing a request for an emergency declaration rarely crosses the 
supervisors' minds. 
</P>
<P>
The formal emergency declaration provides several things to governments that 
turn to it. First, as Riley noted, it limits liability for actions taken in 
combatting an emergency: In the case of the Medfly, for instance, the county's 
declaration makes it less likely to be sued successfully by residents 
complaining of the effects of malathion, which is toxic to some animals but 
which state experts say is safe to humans. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the declaration marks the first step toward letting residents and 
others get access to state and federal money available for combatting certain 
problems. Without the measles emergency declaration, the county could not apply 
for a state grant to fight the epidemic; if the supervisors vote today to 
reaffirm the health officer's declaration, as they are expected to, the health 
office plans to apply for $304,424 in aid. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a declaration gives the county extraordinary powers that it would not 
be able to command under ordinary circumstances. During the oil spill, for 
instance, declaring a state of emergency let county officials close otherwise 
public beaches. 
</P>
<P>
"They can do anything from imposing martial law to confiscating property," 
Miller said. "The whole gamut of activities that you need to deal with an 
emergency becomes possible when you issue the declaration." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Orange County has always stopped well short of imposing martial law, 
and, for the most part, its states of emergency have been relatively 
short-lived. Most last no more than a few weeks or months, and they have to be 
reaffirmed every two weeks by the board, a cumbersome political process that 
supervisors sometimes resent but are obliged to go through under state law. 
</P>
<P>
The reaffirmations have become politically painful on the Medfly issue in 
particular because supervisors dislike having to continually cast votes on 
malathion, a decidedly controversial topic. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors, bureaucrats and residents agree, however, that the most annoying 
thing about the emergencies is that you never know where or when the next one's 
going to hit. 
</P>
<P>
"It may seem like a lot right now, but there can always be more," said Al 
Villere, senior planner with the Los Angeles branch of the state Office of 
Emergency Services. "After all, all it takes is an earthquake, and they'd be 
looking at four emergencies instead of three."

CHAVEZ PLAYS PATIENT GAME WITH SIXTH-ROUND KNOCKOUT

Ernie Chavez figured he would have plenty of time to get a knockout in his 
fight with Juan Alonzo Villa in the main event Monday night at the Irvine 
Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez seemed content to just throw a right jab here and a left hook there 
until the sixth round. At that point, Chavez landed a pair of impressive lefts, 
one to the body then another to the head, and Villa backed up to the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez followed with some inside combinations and referee Ernie Swanks stopped 
the fight at the 1-minute 48-second mark, which brought mostly cheers from the 
crowd of 1,056. 
</P>
<P>
"I got him with the left a few times earlier but I wasn't following up," Chavez 
said. "I just felt confident that I would get him. I knew I had 10 rounds to do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Chavez, who is 10-0 with six knockouts, including three in a row, dominated the 
fight. He was more aggressive from the outset, and punished Villa with mostly 
hard lefts and solid combinations. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez jabbed Villa's chin almost at will. 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth round, Villa of Los Angeles countered with a strong right that cut 
Chavez's left eyelid. 
</P>
<P>
Villa's best blow came in the third round, when he stunned Chavez with an 
accidental head butt. 
</P>
<P>
"It caught me right between the eyes and sort of stunned me," Chavez said. "He 
hit me with a couple of good shots also, but nothing that made me see stars. 
Mostly it (being hit) just made me mad." 
</P>
<P>
An otherwise poor undercard was saved by an action-filled four-round fight 
between Jose Castro of Westminster and Antonio Gonzales of Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
Castro and Gonzales, who both weigh 132 pounds, punched wildly for four rounds. 
After the fight, which was a draw, fans threw several bills, including at least 
one $50 and a couple of $20 bills, into the ring.

UC IRVINE GUARD PLANS TRANSFER TO LSU

<TEXT>
<P>
Justin Anderson, a 6-foot-5 junior guard from UC Irvine, has asked for and been 
given his release from the school. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who averaged 8.1 points and started 13 games for the Anteaters last 
season, told Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan he plans to transfer to Louisiana 
State. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Brown, LSU coach, recruited Anderson when the guard was at Valley City 
High School in North Dakota. As a senior, Anderson averaged 22 points and 10 
rebounds and was named the state's player of the year. Brown and Anderson's 
father, Darrell, played one season together at Minot State. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really happy for him," Mulligan said. "I was surprised. I thought he was 
more into academics than basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, an engineering and psychology major, will redshirt the 1990-91 season 
and have one year of eligibility remaining at LSU. 
</P>
<P>
Last season at Irvine, Anderson's playing time decreased as freshman Dylan 
Rigdon emerged as the Anteaters's top outside shooter. ELLIOTT TEAFORD

SINGBANDITH SIGNS WITH NEBRASKA

<P>
Phouphet Singbandith of Magnolia High School, the Orange County record-holder 
in the triple jump, signed a national letter of intent Sunday to attend 
Nebraska, Nebraska Coach Gary Pepin said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Singbandith is the national prep leader in the triple jump this season with his 
leap of 50-feet 3/4 inches at the Arcadia Invitational earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
"We've really been recruiting him, mail-wise, since last year," Pepin said. "I 
think he's got a lot of potential and, on top of that, he's a real good student 
and a very humble young man. He's a good little technician for a high school 
jumper." 
</P>
<P>
Singbandith, a native of Laos, is a two-time defending county champion in the 
triple jump and long jump. Saturday, he won the triple jump at the Mt. San 
Antonio College Relays for the second consecutive year. Last year after 
finishing second in both jumps at the Southern Section 2-A finals, Singbandith, 
plagued by knee and ankle injuries, placed seventh in the state meet. 
</P>
<P>
Singbandith, who will study engineering at Nebraska, has not visited the 
Cornhusker campus, but plans to in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska has won six of the last 10 Big Eight championships in men's track and 
field, including the 1989 indoor and outdoor titles. 
</P>
<P>
Singbandith's signing marks the second county track and field athlete to commit 
to a Big Eight Conference school in the last two weeks. Last week, Mission 
Viejo's Lisa Fager, the county record-holder in the girls' triple jump, signed 
with Kansas State. BARBIE LUDOVISE

WAX WONDER: PLAN READY FOR LIFE OF CHRIST MUSEUM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In Christian circles, the Crystal Cathedral put Orange County on the map. A 
flock of popular televangelists have helped spread the word. 
</P>
<P>
And now a local amusement industry figure wants to build another kind of shrine 
-- a wax museum that would depict the life of Jesus Christ. 
</P>
<P>
Allen Parkinson, the founder of Movieland Wax Museum in Buena Park, wants to 
convert an industrial building here into "The Life of Christ Historical Wax 
Museum," along with a separate gallery featuring Latino history and a souvenir 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a lot better than people imagine," said the 58-year-old 
Parkinson, who also founded the Japanese Village and Deer Park in Buena Park. 
Movieland is still open but the Japanese Village has closed. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, however, it may take a few miracles to raise the roof. 
</P>
<P>
First, there's the matter of money. Parkinson said that, since issuing a 
prospectus for limited partnership two months ago, he has raised only about 
$100,000 of the $6 million he needs. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the location. Parkinson said that while he has a building picked 
out on Kraemer Boulevard, he does not plan to try to lease it until he raises 
the financing. 
</P>
<P>
Lastly, there is his last project -- which created controversy and never got 
off the ground. Two years ago, he proposed a "War and Peace Wax Museum," 
including a section on the life of Christ. That wax gallery would have 
displayed Nazi military leaders of World War II, scenes of Adolf Hitler's 
suicide and a concentration camp complete with a soundtrack of moans of dying 
Jews. Parkinson dropped plans for the museum after local Jewish leaders 
objected. 
</P>
<P>
But Parkinson, who sold Movieland and the Japanese Village to Six Flags in 
1970, dismisses the non-believers and is convinced that the Life of Christ wax 
museum is a winner. 
</P>
<P>
Featuring almost 350 figures, the new attraction would be the largest wax 
museum in the world, he said. While the Life of Christ wax figures will be 
stationary, he said the project will include such special effects as water 
changing into wine, a thunder and lightning storm, and the sight of Jesus 
walking on water. 
</P>
<P>
Parkinson emphasizes that the new museum will be an historical account of the 
life of Christ, rather than religious. He said he plans to make it 
nonsectarian. 
</P>
<P>
Parkinson said he has put 250 figures for the museum in storage until he can 
raise enough money by selling limited partnerships to go ahead with the 
project. With the money in hand, he said he can open the museum in six to seven 
months. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Kraemer Boulevard site is centrally located near the Orange and 
Riverside freeways, about 20 minutes from Disneyland. While Movieland draws 
almost entirely from tourists nowadays, Parkinson said that with the new museum 
he would try to appeal to locals as well. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the market for such a museum, Parkinson said the churches are 
filled on Sundays and the Crystal Cathedral, the massive, glass-walled church 
built by the Rev. Robert H. Schuller in Garden Grove, packs its pews with 
hundreds of thousands who turn out for the annual Christmas and Easter series 
of shows at $10 to $25 a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
"Very few people know the life of Christ," said Parkinson, a non-practicing 
Mormon who said he is developing the museum for investment purposes rather than 
out of any religious conviction. "I don't think anyone knows the chronological 
life of Christ." 
</P>
<P>
To help them along, Parkinson said he plans to sell "The Book of Scenes" in the 
gift shop that describes each of the 58 wax scenes at the museum. The book, he 
said, would be easier to read and understand than the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
The gift shop itself would be something of a showplace, he said, with 
chandeliers and marble floors. 
</P>
<P>
For his latest undertaking, Parkinson said he hopes to capitalize on the Latino 
market by building the Latin Historical Wax Museum adjoining the Life of Christ 
galleries. He said that museum would be advertised in the Spanish media only 
and would feature figures ranging from Mexican hero Benito Juarez to Our Lady 
of Guadalupe. 
</P>
<P>
Movieland owner Ronald M. Fong said he admires Parkinson's fertile imagination 
and added that he does not believe a Life of Christ museum would cut into 
Movieland's patronage. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is two completely different markets," he said. "Some people want to 
see movie stars and others want to see religious (figures)." 
</P>
<P>
He said he believes the Life of Christ museum could be successful. "It's the 
closest thing to being in church without being in church," he said.

DESPERATE EECO INC. CONSIDERING SALE OF ASSETS 
</P>

<P>
EECO Inc., struggling to stave off bankruptcy, said Monday that its deal to 
sell its computer keyboard subsidiary to an unnamed buyer has fallen through 
and that it is now considering selling all other assets of the company. 
</P>
<P>
EECO Chairman Robert B. Bonney said the sale of its Maxi-Switch keyboard unit 
was abandoned because EECO's lender, Sanwa Bank in Los Angeles, rejected terms 
of the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Bonney declined to identify the potential buyer. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll listen to any reasonable offer, but we don't have anything to announce 
right now. The last thing we want to do is shut down," Bonney said. "We can't 
go on like this much longer, but we don't have any drop-dead date at the 
moment." 
</P>
<P>
Bonney said EECO is discussing selling the keyboard unit to two other potential 
buyers. He said the company is also considering selling all or part of its 
other assets. 
</P>
<P>
Maxi-Switch makes computer keyboards in Tucson, Ariz., and Sonora, Mexico; 
operates an electronic components division and a hotel computer division in 
Santa Ana, a key-pad division in Phoenix and a keyboard and switches division 
in Scotland. The company owes Sanwa Bank $10 million, and its credit agreement 
expired on March 31. The bank told the company that it will not extend any 
further advances to the company, but it has not yet declared the loan in 
default. 
</P>
<P>
A default declaration would have a materially adverse effect on company 
operations, the company said, possibly forcing it to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
"If the bank is not going to let them sell the company, there aren't too many 
options besides Chapter 11," said James Magid, analyst with Needham &amp; Co. 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, EECO reported a loss of $10.3 million on revenue of $63 million for 
its fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 1989. The company attributed the loss to costs 
related to the closing and sale of its computer keyboard and hotel computer 
operations units, as well as a $6.7-million loss from continuing operations.

MAIL FRAUD COUNTS FILED AGAINST BREA MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Brea man defrauded investors of $2 million through a bogus oil and gas 
exploration scheme, federal prosecutors charged Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Terree A. Bowers said the two counts of mail fraud filed in U.S. District Court 
in Los Angeles against Thomas J. Neavitt Sr. are part of an extensive 
investigation by the U.S. attorney's office and the U.S. Postal Inspection 
Service into gas and oil investment fraud through telemarketing. 
</P>
<P>
Neavitt, who used several phone marketing companies to sell his investment 
program between August, 1984, and April, 1986, "failed to disclose to investors 
that as much as 50% of their investment went to pay commission at the 
telemarketing firms," Bowers said. 
</P>
<P>
By not telling investors about the telemarketing commissions, Neavitt, 59, was 
"concealing relevant information" that the investors had a right to know, 
Bowers said. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of investors from throughout the nation each gave Neavitt's company, 
Red Bird Petroleum Corp., which had offices in Anaheim and Placentia, about 
$3,500 to finance drilling in Kentucky, Bowers said. The investors were then 
asked to give an additional $1,100 for each well that produced marketable 
amounts of oil. 
</P>
<P>
"Most investors were told that at least one of their wells had 'hit,' and most 
paid the additional completion costs," according to a press release by the U.S. 
attorney's office. "In truth and fact, however, some of the wells were never 
drilled as promised, and some of those that were did not produce oil in 
commercially salable amounts," the release says. 
</P>
<P>
Bowers declined to comment on whether charges will be filed against the 
telemarketing firms used to sell Neavitt's investment program. 
</P>
<P>
Neavitt could not be reached for comment Monday.

<P>
As part of a consolidation with a recently acquired sister company, Emerson 
Computer Power, a maker of power supply equipment, began laying off 100 of its 
580 employees in the past month, the company confirmed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Emerson Computer Power, a subsidiary of St. Louis-based Emerson Electric Co., 
makes uninterruptible power supplies, or devices that protect electronic 
equipment from sudden power surges or power outages. 
</P>
<P>
The unit has been located in Santa Ana since 1963. 
</P>
<P>
"The 100 layoffs relate to a reorganization combining field management, inside 
sales and administrative staff with the Liebert division in Columbus, Ohio," 
said Jim Orso, a spokesman for Emerson Electric in St. Louis. "The employees 
were informed in March and (the layoffs) will be completed by mid-May." 
</P>
<P>
Emerson Electric, a $7.1-billion diversified electronic-components firm, bought 
Liebert Corp., maker of computer cooling systems, in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In the consolidation, part of the computer power division has been transferred 
to the parent company's industrial controls division in Grand Island, N.Y., and 
a manufacturing line has been moved to another Emerson Computer unit in Irvine.

<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge here has granted a motion by federal prosecutors to forgo a 
second trial to see if convicted thrift consultant Janet Faye McKinzie must 
relinquish millions of dollars in assets. 
</P>
<P>
McKinzie was convicted last month of looting the now-defunct North America 
Savings &amp; Loan in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
She was the beneficiary of a $10-million life insurance policy held by the 
thrift's chairman, Duayne D. Christensen, who died in a mysterious car crash 
just nine hours before regulators seized the thrift in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its decision to drop the forfeiture hearing, the federal government is 
expected to go after McKinzie assets when she is sentenced in July by asking 
for heavy fines and restitution. 
</P>
<P>
McKinzie, 40, and her assets are also the target of a civil lawsuit filed by 
the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.

<P>
Mariachi Uclatlan, a mariachi band based in Orange, has been added to the 
growing list of groups and artists from Orange County to participate in 
September's Los Angeles Festival of the arts. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-member band, which regularly performs at El Mariachi restaurant in 
Orange, is scheduled to play at a gathering "of the best mariachi in the 
greater Los Angeles area," said Judy Mitoma, festival co-curator. 
</P>
<P>
Other recently confirmed festival participants from Orange County are San Juan 
Capistrano photographer Mihoko Yamagata, to be featured in a solo exhibit, and 
Florinda Mintz, a writer from Santa Ana who is co-organizing a mini-festival of 
poets from Latin America and Canada. Mintz said Pablo Antonio Cuadra, one of 
Nicaragua's leading poets and director of the newspaper La Prensa, will be 
among those reading their work. 
</P>
<P>
The mariachi gathering, the Yamagata exhibit and the poetry mini-festival all 
will be subsidized by the festival. An "open" segment of the festival will 
feature other artists, including several from Orange County, who will pay to 
present their work. All events will take place throughout Los Angeles County.

When "A Day in the Death of Joe Egg" first appeared in 1967, it came as a 
shock. Here was a play in which a mother and father make sick jokes about their 
handicapped 10-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Father, impersonating a German doctor: You vont a vord for her? You can say she 
iss a spastic vis a damaged cerebral cortex, multiplegic, epileptic. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Mother: That is a long word. 
</P>
<P>
Father: Which iss vy I prefer wegetable. 
</P>
<P>
One might have expected that sort of black comedy from Lenny Bruce. But from a 
British playwright who revealed that "Joe Egg" was autobiographical, that the 
title character was based on his own barely sentient daughter? 
</P>
<P>
We are talking about Peter Nichols, the author of nearly a dozen mordantly 
funny plays from "The National Health" (about death and disease) to "Privates 
on Parade" (about sex and the army) to "Passion Play" (about marriage and 
adultery). 
</P>
<P>
Like the schoolteacher father in "Joe Egg," who claims that "every cloud has a 
jet-black lining," Nichols is not big on moral uplift. The idea of small 
victories over great afflictions does not apply. "If ever there was a case for 
euthanasia it was our daughter," he said after her natural death at age 11 in 
1971. 
</P>
<P>
The revival of "Joe Egg" that opens Friday at the Alternative Repertory Theatre 
in Santa Ana uses a life-size doll rather than an actor in the title role. 
"It's been done that way before," said director Joel T. Cotter during a recent 
interview at Cal State Fullerton, where he heads the drama department's scene 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
An actor in the role, Cotter said, would have distracted an audience in the 
small confines of a 61-seat storefront theater, particularly when the script 
calls for Joe to have epileptic seizures and spastic convulsions. Further, a 
life-size doll fits the format of a sometimes surreal drama filled with 
satirical sketches, comic parodies and monologues frequently directed to the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the real message of the play to come across," Cotter said. "I don't 
want the focus drawn away from the other characters. 'Joe Egg' is not really 
about Joe. That's what makes it so interesting. But it will be a warts-and-all 
presentation. I don't think the audience will leave whistling." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, "Joe Egg" focuses on the strains in the marital relationship between 
Joe's father and mother after 10 years of trying to cope with their biological 
disaster. They survive on daily fantasies of murder and guilt. The certainty 
that Josephine will never be more than a "living parsnip" in a wheelchair, much 
less a Christy Brown, keeps the sick jokes flowing. ("A useful anesthetic," 
allows one of the couple's offended friends.) 
</P>
<P>
What drew Cotter to Nichols' play was not only the subject matter but also its 
British texture. "I have a real fondness for British things," he said. "I just 
love their film and drama. It's very different from what the Americans do. I 
find most, though not all, British writers to be more substantial." 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, the 35-year-old director gives an American Gothic impression 
himself. In his bushy beard, faded blue overalls and yellow T-shirt, he could 
pass for a tall, hefty dirt farmer just finished with chores at the barn. The 
impression is dispelled, however, by his soft-spoken theatrical concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the audience will go into this play with a clean slate," he said. "I 
want them to make up their own minds about what happens to the people. I'm not 
trying to prod them one way or the other." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, theatergoers will be offered something quite different from the 
touching heroics provided by dramatizations of the handicapped in such movies 
and plays as "My Left Foot," "The Elephant Man" and "Children of a Lesser God." 
</P>
<P>
"Joe Egg" will be Cotter's third outing as a director at ART. Earlier this 
season, he staged a reading of Truman Capote's "A Christmas Memory" and, last 
season, a production of Arthur Kopit's comedy "End of the World." 
</P>
<P>
A native of North Attleboro, Mass., Cotter said that for three years before 
coming to Cal State Fullerton in 1984 he ran the scene shop at the Actors 
Theater of Louisville in Kentucky, one of the nation's leading resident 
theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Day in the Death of Joe Egg" opens Friday at the Alternative Repertory 
Theatre, 1636 S. Grand Ave., Santa Ana., and continues Thursdays through 
Saturdays at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 7 p.m. through June 16. Tickets: $10-$12

Missing Lines -- In Sylvie Drake's Monday review of "Once in Arden" at South 
Coast Repertory, some lines were omitted. 
</P>
<P>
Writing of the predicament faced by the protagonist Helena Modjeska as to 
whether to appear in vaudeville, Drake wrote: 
</P>
<P>
Does she or doesn't she in the end? For all the talk we never quite find out. 
So "Once in Arden's" only big decision is never adequately explored. The play 
lacks tensile strength. Everything in it is too soft and predictable. Hellesen 
writes around his subject rather than to it, endlessly circling his prey but 
never coming in for the kill. . . .

FULLERTON ART EXHIBIT DROPS NUDE PHOTO OF JOHN LENNON

<P>
A well-known photograph depicting former Beatles' star John Lennon in the nude 
embracing a fully clothed Yoko Ono has been removed from an art exhibit at the 
Muckenthaler Cultural Center in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The portrait by Annie Leibovitz was pulled from the exhibit "Heroes, Heroines, 
Idols and Icons," which opened Saturday, after objections from several members 
of the center's board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints were reportedly raised over the photograph's appropriateness to the 
show's theme and not over the nudity. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't express 'hero,' it expresses 'anti-hero,' " Gunter said. "To me, to 
fit the hero show, something about the work should be somehow a character 
strength," said Beverly Gunter, chairwoman of the Muckenthaler board. 
</P>
<P>
Another Leibovitz photograph that remains in the exhibit shows the late artist 
Keith Haring, nude but covered with body paint. 
</P>
<P>
Taken the same day Lennon was shot to death Dec. 8, 1980, the photograph shows 
Lennon in a fetal position, embracing a reclining Ono. His buttocks are visible 
in profile. 
</P>
<P>
The photograph raised some controversy when it ran on the cover of the Jan. 22, 
1981, edition of Rolling Stone magazine, when several Southern California 
supermarket chains refused to carry it.

A child was killed and her parents were injured when their car crashed into a 
tree and flipped over, Anaheim police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Elena Tavares, believed to be about 2 or 3 years old, was pronounced dead at 
UCI Medical Center in Orange shortly after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the girl suffered massive head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred about 4:45 p.m. Monday in a light rain. The child's 
father, 23-year-old Rene Cuellar Tavares of Anaheim, was driving the family's 
car south on Haster Street near Orangewood Avenue. Anaheim Sgt. Richard 
Zschoche said Tavares crossed into opposing lanes and ran up a curb before 
ramming a tree in Ponderosa Park and rolled over. 
</P>
<P>
Both Tavares and his wife, Sonia, received several facial cuts. They are listed 
in stable condition at hospitals in Santa Ana and Garden Grove.

VIETNAM VETERAN KILLS WIFE, MAN HE MISTOOK AS LOVER, POLICE SAY

A distraught Vietnam veteran, wearing combat camouflage and armed with three 
guns, fatally shot his estranged wife and a man he apparently mistook as her 
lover in San Pedro today, detectives and neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers from the Los Angeles Police Department's Harbor Division said Robert 
Dils Jr., 46, who has been separated from his 44-year-old wife, Diana, since 
December, 1988, marched into her home in the 2000 block of South Leland Street 
shortly after 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's 18-year-old son, Robbie, and 20-year-old daughter, Shannon, told 
neighbors that they fled from the house before Robert Dils opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
Shannon Dils said her father mistakenly shot her boyfriend, Salvatore Sabella, 
24, as he sat in a chair in the living room. Dils then cornered his wife in a 
back bedroom and shot her, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie and Shannon Dils ran to the home of a neighbor, who called police. 
Officers said Robert Dils, a mechanic in a nearby service station, surrendered 
at the home without incident and was booked at the Harbor Station on suspicion 
of murder.

POLHILL, OTHER AMERICANS IN 1 ROOM; 
</P>
<P>
EX-HOSTAGE: FREED PROFESSOR, JOINED BY FAMILY, SAYS FELLOW WESTERN CAPTIVES 
WERE PROBABLY IN SAME BUILDING.

<P>
Freed American hostage Robert Polhill spent most of his captivity in the same 
room as two fellow hostages and probably in the same building as other Western 
captives, U.S. officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
Some details of Polhill's captivity emerged as a special team of U.S. 
investigators began questioning him today about what he knows of other captives 
in Lebanon and the Shiite Muslim militants who hold them. 
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old business professor was reunited with his two sons today for the 
first time in more than three years. They shared a lunch of spare ribs and were 
serenaded by a German accordionist, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Polhill, a New Yorker, has been staying in a VIP suite at the U.S. Air Force 
Hospital in Wiesbaden with his wife, Feryal. His sons, Stephen, 26, and Brian, 
23, arrived this morning from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Polhill was held in 
the same room with American educators Jesse Turner, 42, of Boise, Ida., and 
Alann Steen, 51, a Boston native. All three were seized on Jan. 24, 1987, from 
the American University in Beirut campus, where they had taught. 
</P>
<P>
Indian-born U.S. resident Mitheleshwar Singh, who was also kidnaped from the 
campus with the three professors, shared the room until his release on Oct. 3, 
1988, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a possibility he (Polhill) was held in the same building with other 
hostages," one U.S. official said. "We're fairly certain of that." 
</P>
<P>
The official said he did not know which of the 17 Westerners still in captivity 
might have also been held in the building. Seven Americans are among those 
held. 
</P>
<P>
"We know from various sources where the hostages have been held," the U.S. 
official said, explaining that they are moved regularly. 
</P>
<P>
At the base hospital, doctors said Polhill appeared to be in good shape for a 
man who had been in captivity for more than three years, but he was 
malnourished, mildly dehydrated and quite tired. 
</P>
<P>
Polhill's diabetes, which he has had for 25 years, "is well under control," the 
hospital said in a statement today. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital's medical director, Col. Dr. Kenneth R. Koskinen, said Polhill 
suffered "muscle wasting" in captivity. He added that Polhill is eating four 
meals a day to combat his malnutrition and "emptying our kitchen." 
</P>
<P>
He added, however, "He is intellectually very sharp, has a great sense of humor 
and, considering his ordeal, has a reasonably positive mental status." 
</P>
<P>
Polhill, an avid sports fan, has asked a lot of questions about the World 
Series and Super Bowl, U.S. officials said. During his captivity he had only 
sporadic reading material. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Polhill ever felt there was a moment he would be killed, one U.S. 
official said: "My understanding is that he never felt that." 
</P>
<P>
Polhill will spend several more days at Wiesbaden before returning to the 
United States, Koskinen said.

Israel's Holocaust Museum, rebutting a common belief, said today that the Nazis 
never made soap from human fat of murdered Jews during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"Historians have concluded that soap was not made from human fat. When so many 
people deny the Holocaust ever happened, why give them something to use against 
the truth?" said Shmuel Krakoski, archives director at the Yad Vashem Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli Holocaust historian Yehuda Bauer said there is no evidence that Nazi 
Germany had used corpses for soap although some Nazis did use skin to make 
lampshades and hair to fill mattresses.

A member of the legendary gang that carried out Britain's Great Train Robbery 
of 1963 was shot to death in this Costa del Sol resort, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe the killing of Charles Wilson, 58, may have been 
drug-related, a Marbella police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
A gunmen opened fire Monday afternoon on Wilson after calling at the door of 
the Briton's apartment, the spokesman said. Neighbors told police they spotted 
a young man in a track suit fleeing on a bicycle shortly after they heard the 
gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson and 14 other members of a gang took part in the Great Train Robbery on 
Aug. 8, 1963, when they held up the Glasgow-to-London mail train. 
</P>
<P>
They stole 2.6 million pounds, then worth $7.2 million, in cash. At the time, 
it was the biggest robbery in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Police recovered less than $966,000, but Wilson and most of the other gang 
members were captured and jailed. Wilson was sentenced to 30 years in prison in 
1964 and released in 1978.

The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee said today that Congress must craft 
its own 1991 budget because the Bush Administration isn't giving it serious 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.) told the committee that he hopes to draft a 
$1.2-trillion budget by having members consider at least three alternatives 
with deficit reductions ranging from $50 billion to $37 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the senior Republican on the panel, 
promised to cooperate but said he doesn't think Sasser's strategy will work. 
</P>
<P>
"The missing link is the President of the United States," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Sasser said, "At this point, at least, the Administration isn't serious" 
about the budget. "I have very severe doubts that negotiations with the White 
House are the way to go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Before today's meeting, Sasser had worked for weeks without success to find a 
consensus among the 10 Republicans and 13 Democrats on the committee for a 
deficit-reduction plan.

WAGES, BENEFITS RISE 5.5%, BIGGEST INCREASE IN 6 YEARS

<P>
Wages, salaries and other benefits paid to American workers shot up 5.5% over 
the last year, the largest jump in six years, the government reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department attributed much of the increase in its employment cost 
index, one of the best measures of wage inflation, to the continued soaring 
cost of health insurance and other benefits, plus a rise in Social Security 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Health insurance alone increased 12.1% for the year ending in March, following 
the 13.4% rise registered for the 12-month period ending in March, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The 5.5% rise in overall employment costs was the largest 12-month surge since 
March, 1984, when wages, benefits and salaries increased by 5.9%, the 
government said. A year ago, employment costs had gone up 4.8% for the same 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Economists have been concerned that tight labor markets are pushing labor costs 
higher and worsening the nation's inflation problems. Last month, the nation's 
already relatively low unemployment rate fell a notch to 5.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co., called the report a "big 
negative on the inflation outlook." 
</P>
<P>
"It shows that we have a rock-hard high employment cost lump facing American 
business that is being passed on at the retail level," Sinai said. 
</P>
<P>
Today's report showed that wages and salaries rose 4.2% over the year ending in 
March, the same as the increase from a year earlier, while benefit costs jumped 
7.2%, compared with a 5.4% rise a year before. 
</P>
<P>
The jump in benefit costs was blamed on higher health insurance and an increase 
in Social Security taxes, up from 7.51% to 7.65%. 
</P>
<P>
Private industry workers in the Northeast fared the best in terms of wage and 
salary gains. Workers in that region saw their wages and salaries increase by 
5.4%, compared to a 3.5% rise for workers in the Midwest and a 3.4% gain for 
those in the West. Southern workers enjoyed gains of 4.3%.

Ames Department Stores Inc. has hired a bankruptcy specialist from a prominent

<P>
A story in today's editions of the Hartford Courant said Ames has hired Michael 
Cook of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom to begin preparing paper work

trying to work out a plan to repay its debts.

Ames, which has been suffering from major losses and cash flow shortages since 
its 1988 acquisition of the Zayre discount chain, has been trying for weeks to 
negotiate new financing with its bankers. Most of its stores are in the 
Northeast, where the retail environment is sluggish.

both categories despite a net loss.

<P>
The food-and-tobacco giant, taken private last year by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts

first-quarter operating income was up 43% to $754 million, from $526 million a 
year earlier.

<P>
The company, which reports its results because of publicly traded high-yield,

net loss of $222 million for the quarter, compared to a loss of $239 million a 
year earlier.

Quaker Oats Co. said today that it will spin off its troubled Fisher-Price toy 
division to Quaker shareholders, leaving the parent company free to concentrate 
on its food business. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher-Price, whose durable toys once dominated the infant and preschool 
categories, has struggled against fierce competition in recent years.

Quaker Chairman William D. Smithburg said Fisher-Price should fare better as an 
independent, publicly owned company.

The decision to spin off the toy subsidiary did not come as a complete 
surprise. Smithburg, at a meeting with securities analysts in February, had 
indicated that a sale of Fisher-Price was possible, although he said nothing 
was imminent at that time. 
</P>
<P>
The Fisher-Price unit, based in East Aurora, N.Y., posted an 11% decline in 
operating income in fiscal 1989 and last month closed a manufacturing plant. 
The plant closing in East Aurora affected 450 of the division's about 7,400 
employees.

Elizabeth Taylor, battling her second serious bout with pneumonia in 30 years, 
was improving today at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica but breathing with 
the help of a ventilator after surgery to determine the cause of her illness. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctors said this morning they are more optimistic about her. We are all 
very happy about that," said Lisa Del Favaro of Chen Sam &amp; Associates 
public relations in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Del Favaro's reports have been upbeat throughout Taylor's three weeks of 
hospitalization, however. The 58-year-old Oscar-winning actress' condition has 
deteriorated markedly since what was initially described as a sinus infection.

Spanish film director Pedro Almodovar lost a bid today to lift an X rating the 
Motion Picture Assn. of America gave his latest film, "Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down." 
</P>
<P>
The MPAA's appeals board voted 6-6 to sustain the rating despite an impassioned 
plea by civil rights lawyer William Kunstler. A rating can be overturned only 
with a two-thirds majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
At issue was a sex scene in Almodovar's film, "Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down," a black 
comedy about an escaped mental patient who kidnaps a porn actress and then gets 
her to fall in love with him by tying her up. The X rating restricts audiences 
to age 17 and older.

LIZ SMITH: TRUMPS' RECONCILIATION AGAIN A WAR OF WORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EASTER WEEKEND, Donald and Ivana Trump were hand-holding, having lunch with 
their kids, taking in a movie in Connecticut. People were talking 
"reconciliation." 
</P>
<P>
As Earth Day weekend ended, the battling Trumps were in a no-reconciliation 
mode. After Donald's appearance on "The Larry King Show" on CNN and Marla 
Maples' exclusive on ABC's "PrimeTime Live," Ivana's attorney, Michael Kennedy, 
made two rare public statements. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said: "Donald Trump is 'the Master Manipulator.' But he has become 
bankrupt in all ways except financially." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy was also derisive over Donald's charges that Ivana had tried to get 
many lawyers to take her case and been refused. Kennedy said: "There is not a 
lawyer in this country who wouldn't drop his briefs for this case!" (Ivana 
Trump remarked the day after she returned from the Aspen incident meeting Marla 
with Donald on the slopes that she went immediately to Kennedy. The reason? "He 
can't be bought by Donald. He can be trusted. And he has known the family for 
13 years and he always represents the powerless against the powerful.") 
</P>
<P>
I asked Kennedy many questions, but he declined to say more or to comment on 
the merits of the case. (Donald Trump responds: "Kennedy's words on moral 
bankruptcy are actionable.") 
</P>
<P>
IVANA'S PALS had much to say about what happened on TV last week. They've 
observed Ivana waver from angry resolution to a heart-melting susceptibility. 
Now intimates hope that "The Week of TV" will firm up her resolve. One 
commented: "The problem is that Donald appeared to be the soul of reason with 
Larry King, who put him on for a full hour with no annoying call-ins. King 
treated Trump like a pussycat. Then, although Marla may have reaped a TV 
ratings whirlwind, especially in New York, aside from revelations that she's in 
love with Donald and has never taken money from him, the interview rated a zero 
for content." 
</P>
<P>
From Ivana's side comes an amalgam of "reliable sources," remarking on both TV 
shows. These speakers insist they can't be identified for fear of "reprisals" 
from Donald. 
</P>
<P>
1. Donald says he is a family man. Reality: He carries on an adulterous affair 
for years. (Donald denies this.) 
</P>
<P>
2. Donald says the family is the most important thing to him. Reality: His true 
sensitivity to his family is shown in that he walked out on them. He then hired 
a self-acclaimed "killer who rips the flesh from witnesses" (lawyer Jay 
Goldberg) to defend himself against his wife and children. And Trump is 
reported having angrily fired his brother, Robert, from the Taj Mahal, although 
Robert is still in the Trump organization. (Donald says he did not fire 
Robert.) 
</P>
<P>
3. Donald says Ivana is getting $25 million and the house in Connecticut from 
the nuptial agreement. Reality: If the Trumps divorce, Ivana gets $10 million 
only, and the house. 
</P>
<P>
4. Ivana is said to have been disturbed by remarks her husband made on the King 
show to the effect that their children are "great," newspapers are kept from 
them, they are "insulated." Reality: Ivana's intimates say the children are 
"devastated," back in school in N.Y.C. and not "insulated" from comments by 
their chums. (Donald says: "It is disgraceful that Ivana and her 
representatives are playing the children for sympathy. I have assured the 
children no matter what happens to the marriage, I will continue to be their 
father and to provide moral support, love and affection and our relationship 
will in no way change. " 
</P>
<P>
5. On the King show, Donald restated his idea that "people grow apart." This 
was also repeated by Marla to Diane Sawyer. One intimate of both Trumps says, 
"Growing apart is one thing. Lying and cheating are another." This source 
insists that Marla wasn't truthful in the matter of money from Donald. "He has 
been supporting her for years." (Donald denies this.)

NHL SCORES IN ITS GOAL TO CUT FIGHTS; 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: THE DROP IN BRAWLS IS DUE TO CLOSER SUPERVISION BY OFFICIALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN KREISER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The NHL is taking a lot of the fight out of this year's playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the last few years, when some teams tried to brawl their way to 
the Stanley Cup, this year's postseason has been remarkably tame. 
</P>
<P>
That's not to say they haven't been physical. Aside from a game-ending brawl in 
the opener of the New York Islanders-New York Rangers series, there has been 
little fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Some fist-throwing, stick-swinging and shoving, but not much fighting. 
</P>
<P>
NHL Executive Vice President Brian O'Neill, the man in charge of discipline, 
said the drop in fighting is due to closer supervision by officials and an 
effort to cut down on pileups in front of the net that often lead to brawls. 
</P>
<P>
"We've instructed our officials to move in a little quicker to break up the 
scrums in front of the net," he said. "Each playoff series has a supervisor who 
meets with the officials the day of the game, just as kind of a refresher. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to have the officials get in quickly to break up the scrums. We 
know we can prevent a lot of fights by getting in to stop them." 
</P>
<P>
The contrast has been startling. Two years ago, there were 105 major penalties 
for fighting in the first round alone. Last year, that number dropped to 61 and 
this year, it was 24 -- six of which took place in the Islanders-Rangers fight 
after Game 1. The NHL suspended Islanders winger Mick Vukota for 10 games and 
defenseman Ken Baumgartner for one game for their roles in starting the brawl. 
There were no other fights in that series. 
</P>
<P>
Two other first-round series -- Buffalo-Montreal and Los Angeles-Calgary -- 
were also played without a fight. 
</P>
<P>
Through three games in each of the four second-round series, there were 15 
fighting majors, one less than last year. Eight of the 15 came in Monday 
night's Capitals-Rangers game. There has been none in the Boston-Montreal 
series and only two each in the St. Louis-Chicago and Los Angeles-Edmonton 
series. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the drop in fights is that officials have been more liberal 
in handing out misconduct penalties. Misconducts in the first round were up 
from 56 to 86 -- nearly mirroring the drop in fights -- and are up from eight 
to 11 in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
In Game 5 of the Toronto-St. Louis series, referee Andy van Hellemond handed 
out 10 misconducts after one second-period incident, banishing every skater on 
the ice. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of fighting doesn't mean that there's any less hitting. 
</P>
<P>
"The games are very physical," O'Neill said. "But with so much at stake, the 
players have to learn not to retaliate when they're hit. The game are so close, 
no one wants to be the one to wear the goat horns."

HOCKEY PULLOUT THREATENED FOR '92 GAMES

Hockey could pull out of the 1992 Winter Olympics if a controversy over playing 
facilities is not settled with the French organizers, the International Ice 
Hockey Federation said today. 
</P>
<P>
"It's possible that we won't take part in the Olympic tournament," Gunther 
Sabetzki, president of the IIHF, told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not prepared to have the Olympic tournament played in one place." 
</P>
<P>
The organizers at Albertville, a French Alpine resort, at first promised to 
build two arenas for the Olympic tournament. 
</P>
<P>
But they said last September that they wanted to hold the games only in an 
existing arena in neighboring Meribel and use a small arena in Courchevel, 
another Alpine resort, only for practice. 
</P>
<P>
"To organize an Olympic tournament in one arena in 12 days is impossible," said 
Miroslav Subrt, a IIHF council member. "We would have to play six games daily." 
</P>
<P>
Also, he said that going from the main arena to practice in Courchevel, 25 
miles away on winter roads, would be difficult, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Subrt said another potential problem is the altitude difference between Meribel 
and Courchevel; Courchevel is higher by about a quarter of a mile. 
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we have asked our medical committee to study this situation, 
whether it's physically possible for the players," Subrt said. 
</P>
<P>
The French organizers have proposed a compromise, building an Olympic village 
for the hockey players between Meribel and Courchevel. 
</P>
<P>
The IIHF also is unhappy with the small arena at Meribel. It seats about 6,000. 
The 1988 Olympic tournament was played at the Saddledome in Calgary, which 
seats some 20,000 fans. 
</P>
<P>
Hockey, one of the best draws in the Winter Olympics, is not a popular sport in 
France.

The International Olympic Committee reaffirmed its ban on South Africa today, 
despite recent liberalization by the country's white government. 
</P>
<P>
The IOC's executive committee opened four days of meetings by deciding that 
because apartheid still exists in South Africa, there will be no change in 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
Michele Verdier, the IOC spokeswoman, said the board also reaffirmed a decision 
against having team events in rhythmic gymnastics, table tennis and archery at 
the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, the board will hear progress reports on attempts to reduce 
the size of the Summer Olympics, which the IOC is committed to doing for the 
1996 Games. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the IOC's medical commission will make its first report on its inquiry 
into boxing, which could eventually lead to boxing's being banned from the 
Games.

TEAMMATES DON'T TRY HARD ENOUGH, PASCUAL PEREZ SAYS

After two weeks with the New York Yankees, Pascual Perez has concluded that 
some of his teammates aren't trying hard enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really like what I see so far," Perez said in today's editions of the 
New York Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it's still early, but I don't like what I see." 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees (4-6) have lost five straight and are last in the American League 
East, three games behind the division-leading Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm not pitching, I'm on the bench and I'm getting ready to pinch-run," 
Perez said. "I'm ready to do anything. I like to do that. That's part of my 
job. But I don't see that here. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some guys who should be getting ready to pinch-hit and pinch-run in 
the sixth, seventh or eighth, and they just sit there. You have to know when 
you're gonna pinch-hit. You have to stretch, you have to get ready. You don't 
be sitting down on the bench. You have to prepare yourself mentally." 
</P>
<P>
Perez (1-1) hasn't allowed an earned run in 11 innings. He's given up five 
hits, struck out 10 and walked three. 
</P>
<P>
Perez is known as a free spirit who once got lost on his way to the ballpark in 
Atlanta. But he thinks the attitude of the Yankees is too loose. 
</P>
<P>
"There's too many jokes during the game in the dugout," he said. "Too many 
funny things. Sure, this is a game, but you shouldn't be having fun if you've 
lost five in a row. Bull on the bench is no good, especially if you're losing. 
I watch everything. I see. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, now it doesn't seem like a big deal. But late in the season you 
think about the games you lost early."

The Norwegian Parliament approved plans costing an estimated $1.1 billion today 
for the construction of facilities for the 1994 Olympic Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
The amount planned for building Olympic facilities equals the amount Norway 
allocated this year for foreign aid to Third World countries. When Norway 
applied two years ago for the games, it estimated the cost at $312.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
A solid majority of three non-socialist government parties and the opposition 
Labor Party approved sites for arenas at Lillehammer and other locations around 
Lake Mjoesa. The games are intended to be compact, with the Feb. 12-27, 1994, 
events taking place as close to one another as possible.

Give Los Angeles Raiders boss Al Davis the starring role in this version of 
"Back To The Future III." 
</P>
<P>
Trying to revive the mean-streets traditions of the Silver-and-Black, Davis 
tried to move the franchise back to Oakland. That was an apparent failure. 
Oakland doesn't want them. 
</P>
<P>
A month ago, they signed former Raider Lyle Alzado to a player-coach contract 
even though he is 41 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's moves were Raider-like and risky. They drafted Arizona defensive end 
Anthony Smith and Texas A&amp;M linebacker Aaron Wallace with their first two 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace was a top-five choice who dropped to the second round because of bad 
work habits. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, admittedly is a reformed thug. 
</P>
<P>
Al, what are you doing? This was a rich draft filled with safer alternatives. 
Why gamble on two of the riskiest players in the draft? 
</P>
<P>
In his recommitment to Raider tradition, he might have grabbed the ultimate 
Raider in Smith. Here is a guy who spent two years in a drug alcohol treatment 
center. He's been arrested 14 or 15 times, mostly for theft and muggings. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost got framed in an armed robbery," Smith said. "They were going to take 
the money themselves and leave. They were holding a lady at gunpoint, She had a 
heart attack and died." 
</P>
<P>
For a while, he ran with the Black Spades gang. Sensing his need for a family 
life during a Christmas, his friends in the gang broke into Macy's and stole a 
train set for him. 
</P>
<P>
As for the drug rehab, Smith said, "The serious time was when they put me in 
the jackets and in the soft room when I was 14. It was a serious, serious 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Just your typical Raider. But the Raiders might end up with a big zero if 
Smith, a pass-rusher, and Wallace, a talented blitzing linebacker, fail. They 
also might end up with two potential Pro Bowlers. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there were safer picks that could have pushed the Raiders back to the 
playoffs, so the Raiders might have had the strangest draft Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The big winner, though, was the Atlanta Falcons franchise. By sticking the 
Indianapolis Colts with quarterback Jeff George, the man some consider the 
$15-million Tony Eason, the Falcons gained Pro Bowl tackle Chris Hinton, 
potential Pro Bowl receiver Andre Rison and a first-round choice next year. 
They also drafted the perfect run-and-shoot halfback, Steve Broussard, and top 
possible starters for their defense -- linebacker Darion Conner and defensive 
end Oliver Barnett. 
</P>
<P>
By trading up to get defensive tackle Cortez Kennedy, the Seattle Seahawks drew 
positive grades. They also added two other starters to their defense -- 
linebacker Terry Wooden and strong safety Robert Blackmon. 
</P>
<P>
The AFC West as a whole improved defensively. The San Diego Chargers plan to 
use USC's Junior Seau as an inside linebacker on a defense that features three 
of the best pass-rushers in football -- Burt Grossman, Leslie O'Neal and Lee 
Williams. The Kansas City Chiefs grabbed solid inside linebacker Percy Snow. 
Denver Broncos Coach Dan Reeves was relatively silent, but he revamped his 
defense last season. 
</P>
<P>
Other winners were the New England Patriots, who drafted two defensive starters 
-- linebacker Chris Singleton and defensive tackle Ray Agnew -- and some 
offensive help -- quarterback Tommy Hodson and wide receiver Greg McMurtry. The 
New York Jets improved their offense with halfback Blair Thomas and wide 
receiver Reggie Rembert. 
</P>
<P>
Good grades also go to the Dallas Cowboys, Cincinnati Bengals, New York Giants, 
Detroit Lions and Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh Steelers Coach Chuck Noll, following a couple of impressive drafts, 
reached for three choices that made him Sunday's second worst selector. In the 
first round, he selected a tight end, Eric Green, for an offense that ignores 
the position. And where did he come up with defensive end Kenny Davidson and 
quarterback Neil O'Donnell? 
</P>
<P>
Tampa Bay Buccaneers Coach Ray Perkins gambled his staff's future on two risky 
players -- linebacker Keith McCants and halfback Reggie Cobb. McCants will need 
knee surgery next week, but he is expected to be ready for training camp. Cobb 
had drug problems at Tennessee but might be the best back in this draft. 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay Packers General Manager Tom Braatz took two second-round players with 
his two first-round choices -- running back Darrell Thompson and linebacker 
Tony Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Bears had a strange draft. They made the sixth choice the cheapest 
player they could find. They took USC safety Mark Carrier because he agreed to 
play for the same contract given to the sixth choice in last year's draft. 
Coach Mike Ditka said the Bears decided last week to draft a player they could 
sign. 
</P>
<P>
But the goat of his draft was Indianapolis Colts General Manager Jimmy Irsay. 
Irsay robbed two starters on his offense for George. Then, instead of repairing 
his weak offensive line in the second round, he drafted fullback Anthony 
Johnson of Notre Dame, which should push halfback Eric Dickerson into the 
Turner Broadcasting System analyst chair. 
</P>
<P>
Give the Colts a few months and fans will start wearing bags on their head 
again. The Dolts are back.

The Supreme Court refused to give new life to a copyright lawsuit over actress 
Shirley MacLaine's 1983 best-selling book, "Out on a Limb." 
</P>
<P>
The court, without comment Monday, let stand rulings that MacLaine's book about 
reincarnation and other spiritual subjects did not infringe the copyright of a 
1977 book written by Charles Silva. Silva's suit sought monetary damages from 
MacLaine and the American Broadcasting Companies Inc., which in 1987 made a 
television movie based on the book. Silva, from Peru, authored "Date With the 
Gods" in 1977 and sent a copy to MacLaine. She later discussed it with him and 
eventually traveled with him to areas of Peru described in his book.

Moaning merchants and gawking passers-by greeted Hollywood's arrival in the 
Bronx for filming of "The Bonfire of the Vanities," starring Tom Hanks as a 
bond dealer brought low by the Big Apple. 
</P>
<P>
There were cranes, trucks, traffic jams and plenty of stars Monday during 
filming at the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
The movie is based on Tom Wolfe's best-selling novel of avarice, ego and 
corruption. And the flames of discontent did leap Monday as a 200-person movie 
crew worked. 
</P>
<P>
"It's making everybody's life miserable," groused Nick Kavalos as movie trucks 
jammed the street outside his delicatessen. "The bread guy had to park two 
blocks away and carry in my delivery." 
</P>
<P>
The courthouse and its players take a prominent role in the book, Wolfe's 
depiction of New York's lowlifes and high brows. Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman 
and Melanie Griffith are also in the movie.

China's Premier Li Peng, who is now in Moscow, is expected to reach agreement 
with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other Soviet leaders on troop 
reductions along the Sino-Soviet border and expanded economic ties. 
</P>
<P>
Li's visit, which runs through Thursday, is an outgrowth of Gorbachev's visit 
to Beijing last May, which ended 30 years of Chinese-Soviet estrangement. 
</P>
<P>
Although still ideological foes, both sides need better relations. China lost 
international trade after the Tian An Men massacre last June. And the Soviets 
are eager to demobilize tens of thousands of men on the Chinese border and put 
them to work as Gorbachev rebuilds his economy.

NICARAGUA'S SANDINISTAS, WHO ONCE TOPPLED A DICTATOR, NOW MUST ADJUST TO 
ELECTORAL DEFEAT. THEY VOW TO REGAIN POWER -- THE QUESTION IS HOW. 
</P>

MANAGUA, Nicaragua 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A day after conceding defeat in Nicaragua's first democratic elections, 
President Daniel Ortega faced 5,000 defiant Sandinistas in Managua's Revolution 
Plaza. Stunned and angry, many in the crowd refused to believe that their 
party, which a decade ago had toppled the Somoza dictatorship after an 18-year 
guerrilla struggle, was leaving the government. "Don't give up power!" they 
demanded, raising fists in the gathering dusk. "We've got the guns!" 
</P>
<P>
The scene was a haunting reminder of the Sandinista National Liberation Front's 
guerrilla legacy, so threatening that supporters of President-elect Violeta 
Barrios de Chamorro, who takes office Wednesday, have yet to hold a public 
celebration of her victory two months ago. In the tumultuous days that 
followed, throngs of belligerent young Sandinistas, many of them armed, seemed 
to own the streets. In one provincial capital they burned the headquarters of 
Chamorro's pro-American coalition. In another, a Sandinista helicopter blasted 
a coalition leader's home with a grenade. 
</P>
<P>
Sandinista officers, alarmed by desertions from their army after the Feb. 25 
election, handed out rifles to thousands of loyal civilians. Party leaders now 
admit that scores of Sandinista combat veterans formed an illicit underground 
network to resist the Chamorro government. "Companero, when are we going back 
to the mountains?" a security guard at the Foreign Ministry asked an official 
there. "I'm ready." 
</P>
<P>
These fitful bursts of Sandinista hostility pose a major challenge not only to 
Chamorro as she tries to govern a war-divided, economically crippled Nicaragua, 
but also to Ortega as he tries to transform his revolutionary vanguard movement 
into a legal opposition. In the hot, dusty plaza that day, he used a mix of 
tough and conciliatory rhetoric, trying at once to whip up the party's defeated 
spirit and to quiet its simmering rage. 
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to contribute to peace and stability as long as the people are 
respected and not threatened, because the people have enough power to crush 
anyone who comes intent on revenge," he declared. "The great winner of these 
elections is the Sandinista Front because we brought democracy here. . . . The 
day will come when we will return (through elections) to govern this country. 
In the meantime," he added, "we will govern from below." 
</P>
<P>
Can Ortega transform a party that never formally abandoned its commitment to 
armed struggle as a means of achieving social change? Will Chamorro's 
free-market advisers be able to dismantle the Sandinistas' state-owned 
enterprises without a violent backlash? Will anything of the Sandinista 
revolution survive in a democracy? Can the party remain united enough to defend 
its programs, or will it fall apart in defeat? 
</P>
<P>
In recent interviews, 16 Sandinista leaders -- from comandantes to neighborhood 
cadres -- said that their party had mellowed, irreversibly, during its decade 
in government. They expressed the unanimous view that a return to clandestine 
resistance after their electoral defeat would have brought a Panama-style U.S. 
invasion and finished their movement. The constitutional route, they said, is 
now the way to defend their revolution and regain power in the next elections, 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if there is another example in the world of a revolutionary party 
that comes to power by force of arms and passes peacefully to the opposition," 
Vice President Sergio Ramirez said with a mixture of pride and resignation now 
echoed at all levels of the party. "For this country, that's an immense step 
forward." 
</P>
<P>
But the Sandinista promise of peaceful politics is still fragile; it depends on 
good behavior by about 8,000 U.S.-backed Contras and, say some party activists, 
by the Bush Administration. Many are skeptical that the rebels, who signed a 
definitive cease-fire last Thursday after eight years of fighting the 
Sandinista-led army, will fulfill their pact to disarm and disband by June 10. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Contras don't disarm, then we have to disarm them," said Ramon 
Cabrales, the outgoing vice minister of economy, who has kept a rifle since his 
days as a guerrilla commander. "To refuse to hand over the government would be 
to commit mass suicide. But it's healthy, mentally, to keep open the armed 
option, as long as there are Contras, as long as the U.S. government is going 
to have more influence, more presence, in our society." 
</P>
<P>
Even with peace, the Sandinista opposition that Chamorro could face during her 
six-year term is daunting. 
</P>
<P>
Still stronger than any of the 14 parties in her broad but fractious coalition, 
which won 55% of the vote, the Sandinistas, who got 40%, are well positioned to 
"govern from below." They will control the Supreme Court until 1993. They hold 
a large enough minority in the new National Assembly to block changes in a 
Sandinista-drafted Constitution that enshrines such revolutionary tenets as 
state control of all banking and foreign trade. They own two newspapers and 
several radio stations. They have better-organized support among farmers, urban 
wage earners, women's groups, war veterans and students than does the Chamorro 
coalition. 
</P>
<P>
The lame-duck legislature dominated by Sandinistas has scrambled in recent 
weeks to bolster their party for life as the opposition. Party members were 
given permanent titles to the homes they confiscated and immunity from 
prosecution for any crimes. Universities, Sandinista strongholds, won autonomy 
from the state. Opposition groups were finally allowed to own television 
stations, and labor unions won the right to engage in collective bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
Sandinista leaders insist that their political clout is enough to defend their 
revolution -- a socialist-inspired order that provided land to 120,000 peasant 
families, free universal health care and education, scholarships abroad for 
8,000 students each year and worker participation in the management of 
state-owned companies. 
</P>
<P>
With the economy battered by war and U.S. economic sanctions, the Sandinistas 
saw those benefits erode. Now they are warning Chamorro, a conservative 
newspaper publisher, that her mandate is simply to disarm the Contras and 
unlock American aid; to revive the revolution with cash, not reverse it with 
free-market ideology. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sandinista Front is ready to cooperate with the new government on matters 
having to do with the people and their conquests," said Comandante Jaime 
Wheelock of the party's nine-man National Directorate. "The people did not vote 
against the Sandinista project. They voted for peace and economic security." 
</P>
<P>
At the Sandinistas' elite cadres school outside Managua, law has replaced 
economics as the dominant curriculum as the party moves from managing a mixed 
economy to defending the workers' stake in a business-oriented regime. The 
sharpest clashes will come if the purest of free-market advocates around 
Chamorro win her approval to sell the state's 518 companies, which include the 
grain monopoly, confiscated sugar mills, textile plants, coffee and banana 
plantations, and seafood processors. 
</P>
<P>
The Sandinista Workers Central and the Farm Workers Assn., which represent 
nearly all 60,000 workers in those enterprises, stand firmly against 
privatization. They fear the loss of such revolutionary gains as equal pay for 
women, day care centers, workers' housing and lunchrooms, as well as their 
voice in running the companies. Arguing that money-losing state farms and 
factories must be given time to profit in peacetime, the unions have threatened 
to seize control of any company that is sold and lock out the new management. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of former owners have returned to demand their companies back," said 
Bernicia Sanders, a Sandinista leader of the textile workers' union. "They have 
to come down to earth and realize that the rules are not the same as before 
(the revolution). The workers are not robots any more." 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro's advisers must also tread carefully as they whittle away the 
70,000-member Sandinista army and the 60,000-strong government bureaucracy. And 
as they struggle to tame Nicaragua's 1,700% annual inflation within a 
campaign-promised deadline of 100 days, they will face an explosion of pent-up 
wage demands that cannot be restrained. 
</P>
<P>
In an apparent warning to Chamorro of their clout, Sandinista unions that 
rarely went on strike against their own leaders have in the past week halted 
mail delivery, disrupted international telephone service, shut down the banking 
system and threatened to disrupt electricity, water and health services. "The 
Sandinistas have all the tools to paralyze the country," said Emilio Alvarez 
Montalban, a Chamorro aide. To keep social peace, admits Alfredo Cesar, another 
of her key advisers, "there will be a permanent process of negotiation." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the Sandinista leadership has shown more willingness to deal than to 
destabilize. It agreed in transition talks to accept civilian control of a 
smaller, non-political military and to disarm their paramilitary followers as 
long as Chamorro leaves the hierarchy of the mostly-Sandinista officer corps 
intact. Gen. Humberto Ortega, the president's brother, worked closely with 
Chamorro's transition team to achieve last week's armistice with the Contras. 
One Sandinista leader spoke of the need for a "secret coalition" and 
"underground understandings" with the new government "to get the country 
producing." 
</P>
<P>
But a split between Sandinista moderates and radicals surfaced during a bitter 
debate in the closing weeks of the old Assembly. A hard-line minority pushed 
unsuccessfully for a huge minimum wage hike against moderates intent on 
cooperating with Chamorro's forces. "We've had a win-or-die mentality. Now 
we're looking for something in the middle," explained Foreign Ministry official 
Alejandro Bendana. 
</P>
<P>
Amid their tentative shifts toward a conventional opposition role, the 
Sandinistas are debating an invitation to join the Socialist International, an 
organization of mainstream socialist and social democratic parties around the 
world. The issue is controversial because staunch Marxist-Leninists in the 
Sandinista Front want to stay closely allied with Communists in such countries 
as Cuba and North Korea, while moderates fear being isolated by the demise of 
Soviet Bloc parties elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Even the harshest critics, those who claim that its socialist ideals are 
bankrupt, recognize the Sandinista Front as an indigenous political force that 
will not disintegrate like the Moscow-imposed Communist parties in East Germany 
and Hungary. But the Sandinistas' clout will depend on their ability to stay 
united, learn from defeat and democratize their Stalinist party structures, 
many members say. None of this will be easy. 
</P>
<P>
The radical faction is close to Interior Minister Tomas Borge, the party's lone 
surviving founder. He has been heard complaining that the Ortegas blew the 
election by ignoring his advice to end the unpopular military draft. Another 
comandante, Henry Ruiz, who still uses the nom de guerre Modesto, has 
reportedly blamed corruption in state enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
Sidestepping such recriminations, the party leadership delayed a formal 
finger-pointing analysis of the election loss to give its displaced members 
time to clean out their files and find new jobs. Vanesa Castro, a party 
official, estimates that 300 to 400 Sandinistas will lose government posts. The 
party can offer them little, she says, because its own 2,000-member payroll 
must be slashed by 20% to 30% to compensate for lost government revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Some outsiders believe that the party will be crippled by the loss of patronage 
and damaged by the unromantic spectacle of comandantes lingering on in mansions 
confiscated from the old order. "A tremendous number of opportunists, probably 
a majority of Sandinistas, will abandon the party when they can no longer 
benefit from being in power," said Moises Hassan, a prominent former 
Sandinista. "The party will break into pieces." 
</P>
<P>
But no such doubts assail the Sandinista leadership, which remembers the trials 
of clandestine struggle as far tougher. By easing membership requirements, the 
party is moving to strengthen its clout as Nicaragua's largest party. As a 
"party of cadres," the Sandinista Front numbered about 40,000 militantes, or 
full-fledged members, at the time of the election. Now party officials have 
launched a campaign to recruit all of the nearly 580,000 Nicaraguans who voted 
for Ortega. 
</P>
<P>
A more important shift is quietly under way in Managua, where some 200 open 
assemblies of Sandinista militants have replaced the elitist "base committee" 
cells appointed from above. Soon the assemblies will elect coordinators, who in 
turn will choose new party leaders for the capital. Carlos Carrion, the Managua 
party chief, said the election process "must go all the way to the top," a 
controversial idea not yet approved by the party's self-designated National 
Directorate. 
</P>
<P>
If the new grass-roots democracy takes hold, it could correct one fault that 
many Sandinistas say distanced them from voters and cost the election -- a 
tendency to impose party leaders from one city or neighborhood on another. 
"We're going to have six long years to build a vanguard that truly rises from 
the community," said Edgar Paladino, a Sandinista combat veteran and 
neighborhood leader in Managua. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the changes in the party leadership, Daniel Ortega is expected to 
remain on top. He has declined to take the seat he won in the new National 
Assembly, chosing instead to work on holding the party together and 
strengthening its alliances abroad. Despite his failed candidacy, the 
44-year-old comandante appears to have grown in stature among his peers on the 
National Directorate and his countrymen as well. 
</P>
<P>
"There was Daniel, two days after the election, up on the stand, speaking to 
the cadres, trying to turn defeat into victory," said a veteran South American 
ambassador. "He wasn't talking like a revolutionary but like a politician, an 
important politician who has a good chance to come back and knows it." 
</P>
<P>
Steps Toward Peace 
</P>
<P>
The Contras and the outgoing Sandanistas government have agreed that the rebels 
will gather within rural demilitarized zones -- scattered around the country 
and totaling about 1,150 square miles -- by Wednesday. Violeta Barrios de 
Chamorro's inauguration day. They will also start disarming immediately after 
she is sworn in. The accords are to be supervised by Venezuelan troops, part of 
a U.N. peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
Pitfalls for Chamorro 
</P>
<P>
Contras -- The U.S.-backed rebels have agreed to a definitive cease-fire and 
pledged to disarm by June 10. They still want Chamorro to purge the army of 
senior Sandanista commanders, but she has yet to agree. She could face a 
violent Sandanista backlash if she retires too many commanders but risks a 
breakdown of the peace agreement if she leaves the army intact. 
</P>
<P>
Inflation -- Prices rose nearly 1,700% last year. To stabilize the economy and 
pull it out of a six-year-old recession, Chamorro needs to disarm the Contras, 
secure U.S. congressional approval of a proposed $300-million U.S. aid package, 
get quick aid to farmers to help them plant grain next month, gain business 
confidence and win a truce with Sandanista-led unions. 
</P>
<P>
Property Disputes -- 
</P>
<P>
Free-market advocates in Chamorro's coalition want to sell of most of the 518 
state-owned companies, some of them confiscated by the Sandanistas and many of 
them losing money. They could meet resistance from Sandanista unions 
representing 60,000 workers who fear the loss of social benefits. Violence 
could result if former owners of confiscated homes or land try to retrieve 
their property. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega's Economic Legacy 
</P>
<P>
When she takes over leadership of Nicaragua from President Daniel Ortega on 
Wednesday, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro inherits an economy battered by war, 
U.S. economic sanctions and what her allies call 10 years of mismanagement by 
Ortega's Sandanista Front. Here are some of the measures of Nicaragua's 
economic health after a decade of Sandanista rule: 
</P>
<P>
Inflation Rate: Drained by war, Nicaragua say inflation begin taking off at end 
of 1987. Through 1988 prices soared, fed by high spending, declining government 
income and collapse of public confidence. Austerity measures cut inflation 
somewhat last year. 
</P>

<P>
Trade Balance: Nicaragua's export-import figures over eight years reflect the 
country's cooling of ties with Washington and its increasing reliance on 
Moscow.

Israeli politicians are approaching a make-or-break point in their attempts to 
form a new government. Thursday is the deadline that President Chaim Herzog has 
given Labor Party leader Shimon Peres to find the 61 votes he needs to build a 
majority in the Knesset, Israel's Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The preceding week was marked by a frenzied round of deal-making and -breaking, 
death threats and a tear-gas grenade attack on a religious party's meeting 
site. 
</P>
<P>
If Peres succeeds, Israel is expected to move toward talks with Palestinians. 
If not, Herzog may allow caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir another shot 
at forming a government -- and the deal-making will begin anew.

If the coffee shop is the sole dominion of the male in Egypt, it is not because 
women are confined to home -- at least, not always. 
</P>
<P>
While her husband sips and smokes at the corner cafe, the modern Egyptian 
professional woman is likely to be lunching with her girlfriends at a five-star 
hotel or meeting her sister downtown for a pastry and a cup of tea. 
</P>
<P>
After hours, the more westernized Egyptian woman can be spotted at nightclubs 
and discotheques all over the city, dancing to Madonna and Prince in skirts 
hiked up to there. But only in the company of her husband or boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional Egyptians still frown on Muslim women prancing around town 
unescorted, and the typical social setting for most women remains the home, 
sharing coffee and gossip with friends or relatives, or calling, with their 
husbands and children, on family for Friday afternoon lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Even in cosmopolitan Cairo, women from the most traditional families never 
emerge from the house unveiled and are seldom seen in the family reception room 
when their husbands are dining with male friends. 
</P>
<P>
Only during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan can women be seen venturing 
across the hallowed threshold of a coffee shop -- and then, for the most part, 
only safely in the company of a husband or brother. 
</P>
<P>
But Egypt, with its reputation as the sin center of the Middle East, is if 
anything less restrictive than most other Arab countries, where segregation of 
the sexes, at least in public and most especially in the coffee shop, is most 
often the rule. 
</P>
<P>
Tunisian and Algerian coffee shops are constantly bubbling over with scores of 
rowdy young men, and in Saudi Arabia, women seldom venture into restaurants 
with men -- even their husbands -- let alone the sacred dens where Saudis drink 
their coffee. KIM MURPHY

"This is indeed a funny country," French novelist Gustave Flaubert wrote home 
from Egypt to announce, surveying the scene in the coffee shop around him 
where, in one corner, a donkey brayed, while in the other, a swarthy Egyptian 
quietly relieved himself. 
</P>
<P>
"No one finds that odd," he told his mother. "No one says anything. Sometimes a 
man will get up and begin to say his prayers, with great bowings and 
exclaimings, as though he were quite alone. No one even turns his head to look, 
it is all so natural. Can you imagine someone suddenly saying grace in the Cafe 
de Paris?" 
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian coffee shop, 140 years later, remains a celebration of the 
unexpected and a refuge for the preposterous, a barometer of day-to-day life 
and a haven of quiet in a madcap city of 14 million where, as a rule, anything 
can happen. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is there an institution so uniquely Arab as the place where an Arab 
goes to sip his coffee, and nowhere has the leisurely art of enjoying a drink 
and a smoke been refined as it has by the Egyptians. There is on every Cairo 
street corner, or just a few doors away, a casually assembled collection of 
round tables and cane-backed chairs, dominoes and waterpipes, backgammon boards 
and tin teapots, that provide every known accoutrement known to be necessary 
for the continued dissemination of a civilization that spans 7,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
It remains an exclusively male domain in a country where women have become, to 
some minds, too restless at home and too apparent in the workplace, a place 
where thick, sweet tobacco too strong for feminine tongues can be gurgled 
through a sheesha waterpipe and where mud-thick coffee -- ordered mazbut, of 
course, with the "correct" amount of sugar -- can be savored blocks away from 
the chaos of the living room. 
</P>
<P>
"You go to the coffee shop to meet your friends, you can have a cup of tea for 
15 or 20 piasters, you can smell the air and you can stay the whole night for 
those two drinks," explains Osama Bahrawi. "Nobody will tell you, 'You don't 
want anything else? Then go.' " 
</P>
<P>
There are, in Cairo, coffee shops for intellectuals. A coffee shop where 
out-of-work actors go to be hired as movie extras. A coffee shop for the deaf, 
where the enthusiastic slapping of hands on backs is the only sound to be heard 
(although singers from the cheap nightclubs nearby have started frequenting it 
in recent months, and it's getting noisier). A coffee shop for the camel 
traders, a coffee shop for taxi drivers, a coffee shop for limericists, and one 
for poets. There is the coffee shop downtown, closed only about a month ago, 
where Gamal Abdel Nasser and his fellow officers plotted the 1952 revolution. 
</P>
<P>
The bakers were thrown out of their coffee shop in Cairo's Shubra district two 
weeks ago for constantly brawling and have started hanging out at the 
construction worker's coffee shop down the street. A near-fight broke out the 
following Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Down the street is the coffee shop where Azziz, the 85-year-old wedding broker, 
goes for his morning tea. 
</P>
<P>
"That man is very well known," a patron inside explained, nodding sagely. "If I 
have a daughter, and this daughter is getting old a little and I want her to 
get married, I come to Azziz and I tell him, 'I have a daughter.' He says, 'How 
old is she? Does she have education? Is she pretty?' And he tries to find a man 
who wants to get married. After that, he brings the man to the father of the 
girl, and they sit there and they start to talk, and if they did the agreement, 
he takes the money from both. Fifty pounds." 
</P>
<P>
Inside, Kamil Abdel Mellik has just arrived to meet his two friends, Safir 
Shanuda and Wahib Helayn Naash, and is preparing to find out what kind of a 
price Naash will give him to paint his house, inside and out. They have been 
meeting here every morning for the last 10 years, but of course it is only this 
morning that Mellik decided to paint his house. The bargaining will span two 
cups of tea, and some sheesha. 
</P>
<P>
Down the street, Khalid Rashwan was waiting at the Dar es Salaam (Peace House) 
for a shy friend who had fallen in love with a girl who passed by his house 
every day. "He will come here and talk to me -- what's he supposed to do with 
this girl?" Rashwan said. "I don't have experience, but I'm going to help him 
-- give him some nice words to say to her." 
</P>
<P>
Sabr Miligi Hassan, the proprietor, presides imperially over the coffee maker, 
his head wrapped in a tall white turban and his blue djellaba stretching to the 
floor. The Dar es Salaam is 55 years old, run by Hassan's father before him, 
whose own father also ran a coffee shop. "A good coffee shop has to be clean," 
he said. "And honest. Dignity. Polite. You have to be in good communication 
with the customers. Everybody loves me." 
</P>
<P>
At Cairo's famous Khan al Khalili bazaar, centuries-old coffee shops have 
stayed open late into the night for the holy month of Ramadan this month, 
dispensing a sweet, warm milk concoction known as sahlab and hibiscus-red 
karkade to revelers before the pre-dawn prayer calls the faithful back to the 
daylight fast. 
</P>
<P>
Across from the sacred Mosque of Hussein nearby, two sheiks, Muslim holy men, 
were chatting quietly last week and fondling their walking sticks in the night 
breeze. Neither man frequents coffee shops, being usually too occupied with 
more serious pursuits, but on this night they found themselves consumed with a 
debate over the Prophet Mohammed's last teaching, a dispute that quickly 
required a cup of tea. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, the last verse that came to the Prophet was, 'Today I have completed 
your religion for you,' " recounted Sheik Mohammed Ahmed abu Hassan. "I 
responded by saying, 'No, the last verse is the Victory' (the Koranic verse 
that begins, 'When Allah's succour and the triumph cometh, and thou seest 
mankind entering the religion of Allah in troops, then hymn the praises of thy 
Lord, and seek forgiveness of him. . . . '). When we went to the Koran, we 
found the truth," he said triumphantly. "It was the Victory." 
</P>
<P>
Only a few yards from the mosque commence the narrow, twisting back alleys of 
Old Cairo, where coffee shops are likely to be dispensing hashish in the 
sheesha and tough young men hawk heroin and cocaine from dark alcoves. 
</P>
<P>
Here, Mahmoud Yassin, eyes glazed, had been smoking for most of the evening in 
the farthest corner of a lonely coffee shop. He comes here every night, he 
said, to get away from his wife and two noisy babies -- started coming here, in 
fact, shortly after he was married 15 years ago and said goodbye to the woman 
he loved. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a love story," he said gravely, pressed to talk. The woman was named 
Sonia, a neighbor of his who loved him, too. Yassin came from the same class, 
but because he had not yet established himself as a brassworker, Sonia's 
brothers forbade their wedding. Sonia became ill and died. Yassin eventually 
married someone else. That, he says, is the end of the story. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think of her, although I'm married," he said, the hashish smoke 
winding lazily around his head and reddening his brown eyes. "I remember it 
when I'm here."

SAVORING VICTORY IN THEIR CAMPAIGN AGAINST U.S. TUNA CANNERS, ENVIRONMENTALISTS 
ARE MOBILIZING ON NEW FRONTS. DRIFT NETS AND THE EUROPEAN MARKET ARE THE NEXT 
TARGETS.

The 20-year campaign to rescue the dolphins is far from over. 
</P>
<P>
In the most significant step since passage of the Marine Mammal Protection Act 
of 1972, the three major U.S. tuna canners, led by StarKist Seafood Co., have 
vowed to stop buying tuna that environmentalists consider "tainted" by any of 
several fishing techniques that collectively drown an estimated 100,000 
dolphins a year. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a shot heard round the world," said a gratified David Phillips, 
director of Earth Island Institute. Any country encouraging its fishing fleet 
to use such methods, said Phillips, "just saw the market drop out from under 
them, saw the biggest company in the world close the market to them. . . . It 
really has created a whole new ball game." 
</P>
<P>
But while environmentalists savor their victory, they are also nailing down the 
details of the tuna packers' pledge and laying plans for new fishing-related 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
"The battle moves now to the drift net, which is a major, global issue . . . 
much bigger than the connection to the tuna industry," said Barbara Britten 
after a recent meeting in Washington of the Dolphin Coalition, an ad hoc group 
of more than 30 conservation organizations. Britten is Washington 
representative of the oldest dolphin and whale conservation group in the world, 
the San Pedro-based American Cetacean Society. 
</P>
<P>
Drift nets are a form of gill net -- monofilament webs that snag fish by the 
gills. The drift nets are transparent, free-floating curtains that can stretch 
for 30 miles, entangling dolphins, whales, turtles, birds and non-food fish as 
well as the squid, swordfish and other marketable species that the fishermen 
seek. Environmentalists consider this the most destructive fishing technique 
ever invented. They commonly term it strip-mining of the sea. According to some 
estimates, from 50% to 70% of the animals killed in drift nets are simply 
thrown back into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Marine biologists say they have no idea how many dolphins drown in high-seas 
drift nets, but Robert L. Brownell Jr., chief of the marine mammals section of 
the National Ecology Research Center at San Simeon, said that the number 
"batted around" is 50,000 to 100,000. About the same number, he adds, are 
thought to be killed annually in gill nets set in coastal waters. 
</P>
<P>
StarKist has long refused to buy tuna known to have been caught in drift and 
gill nets. Its recent announcement was to extend that voluntary ban to include 
fish caught in giant purse-seine nets in the Eastern Tropical Pacific. For 
reasons scientists can't explain, dolphins often swim over schools of 
particularly large tuna in that specific area. Fishermen look for dolphin to 
signal the presence of tuna below, then surround the fish with these nets, 
which resemble upside-down lampshades. As the net is cinched closed at the 
bottom to bring the fish to the surface, the air-breathing dolphin often become 
snared as well, drowning after only about four minutes trapped underwater. 
Others are injured and killed in the rigging and gears used to pull in the net. 
</P>
<P>
The battle to stop this practice of "fishing on dolphin" will now move to 
Europe, second-largest canned tuna market after the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The work (immediately) ahead of us," said Lesley Scheele, international 
dolphin coordinator for Greenpeace, "is ensuring that we don't simply create a 
dolphin-safe market in the United States, only to see dolphin-tainted tuna 
flooding the market in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Gloomy U.S. tuna fishermen, who have depended on purse-seine nets, predict that 
foreign boats will move in on the waters vacated by the American fleet and 
concentrate on selling their catch to the European market. 
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace will try to marshal the same kind of international consumer pressure 
that brought U.S. tuna canners to heel, using its 20 offices and some 1.5 
million supporters who are already at work in Europe. Greenpeace is also 
targeting Australia and other lesser markets for consumer-education efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Barbara Britten and other members of the Dolphin Coalition think the 
StarKist pledge will help their principal campaign -- support for pending 
federal legislation, introduced by California Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Millbrae) 
and Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), to require "dolphin-safe" and 
"dolphin-unsafe" labels on tuna sold in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Although pleased by the StarKist plan, in which the company will apply its own 
dolphin-safe label, the coalition prefers a mandatory program over a voluntary 
plan "which may not be enforceable," said Britten. 
</P>
<P>
Other environmentalists are more optimistic about voluntary efforts. "At this 
point, we think (the StarKist plan) will be enforceable," said Scheele of 
Greenpeace. 
</P>
<P>
A highly regulated tuna-tracking system is already in place, mandated by the 
Marine Mammal Protection Act and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in case 
a batch of tuna need ever be recalled. In many cases, it's possible to trace 
the contents of a can back to the specific vessel that caught the fish, using 
identification numbers on every container. 
</P>
<P>
The system of requiring onboard observers to report dolphin deaths came in for 
criticism following reports of harassment by boat crews and bribery to falsify 
records. But there have been reforms of the system -- which covers all U.S. 
tuna boats and about 30% of the foreign fleet -- and most environmental groups 
say they seem to be working. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the observers are either U.S., or U.S.-trained by the National Marine 
Fisheries Service," said Britten. 
</P>
<P>
Just to be on the safe side, the Redondo Beach-based Sea Shepherd Society 
intends to offer a $5,000 reward to any fisherman who documents that a 
colleague used questionable fishing methods for tuna that ends up in any can 
marketed by StarKist or the other major U.S. canners that joined its pledge -- 
Bumble Bee and Chicken of the Sea. The group plans to advertise the reward in 
publications in San Diego and Costa Rica and is trying to buy a boat to observe 
fishing in the Eastern Tropical Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
In June, Sea Shepherd will sail the group's existing vessel, a former fishing 
trawler, into the North Pacific, to protest drift-net fishing. The group will 
either sink or "confiscate" any nets they find, according to Scott Triminham, 
Sea Shepherd president, on grounds that their use allegedly violates 
international fishing treaties. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, the United Nations resolved to beef up studies of the impact of 
drift nets on the world's oceans, to curtail use in some places, and to impose 
a moratorium beginning in 1992 unless "effective conservation and management 
measures" were taken.

"Our fear is that in some places, drift nets have been so destructive already 
that there are no more animals to study," said Nancy Daves Hicks, director of 
government affairs for the Animal Protection Institute, headquartered in 
Sacramento. Hicks and others wanted to see a more vigorous stand by the U.N. 
"Our position is that effective conservation measures is stopping the use of 
drift nets." 
</P>
<P>
New Zealand, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Maldives, Fiji and other 
oceanic nations aren't waiting for more study. They've already banned drift 
nets from their territorial waters. A 1987 U.S. law only requires that the 
impact of drift-net fishing be assessed and that U.S. agencies try to negotiate 
bans and observation programs with other nations. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese, who annually harpoon almost 40,000 of a particularly endangered 
type of dolphin called Dall's porpoise, have announced that they will continue 
fishing with drift nets, and both South Korea and Taiwan also have large 
drift-net fleets. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal gill nets wreak havoc on dolphins worldwide, but particularly in the 
Sea of Cortez, in Mexico, and off Sri Lanka. Gill nets are now banned along the 
Pacific coast from the Alaskan-Canadian border to the middle of California, as 
well as in New York, Texas, and such Great Lakes states as Minnesota, Michigan 
and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
The last stretch of California coastline would join the ban under a proposed 
initiative for the November ballot sponsored by Assemblywoman Doris Allen 
(R-Cypress).

<TEXT>
<P>
A government organization chart will tell you Horst Teltschik is a civil 
servant, one of 128 in the West German buraucracy with the title "ministerial 
director." 
</P>
<P>
The truth about Mr. Teltschik, however, extends beyond the organization chart. 
Far beyond. 
</P>
<P>
Bright, ambitious and controversial, the 49-year-old bureaucrat is both 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's main foreign policy adviser and a man who, after 18 
years of working for Kohl in various capacities, has become one of his closest, 
most trusted aides. 
</P>
<P>
The combination has made Teltschik a player in German foreign policy as the 
process of German unity begins to alter the political map of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"Seldom, if ever, has an official in the chancellery had so much influence in 
foreign affairs as Teltschik," summed up the prestigious Frankfurter 
Allegemeine Zeitung newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
While Bonn political pundits like to describe Teltschik as Kohl's Henry 
Kissinger -- a reference to Kissinger's years as the national security adviser 
in the Nixon White House -- such a comparison is almost certainly overdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
Although respected for his knowledge on security and foreign policy matters, 
Teltschik lacks the stature and accumulated depth of inside vision and 
scholarship that Kissinger brought to Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the roles are similar. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the few real conceptual thinkers in German foreign policy," noted 
a respected political analyst here. "He's the one who can put the detail into 
the larger framework." 
</P>
<P>
Hans Joerg Sottorf, who has covered the chancellor for several years as a 
correspondent for the Duesseldorf economic daily Handelsblatt, puts it 
differently: 
</P>
<P>
"They (Kohl and Teltschik) fit so well together because they are so different," 
he said. "Kohl has the political instincts of what is possible, but Teltschik 
is the idea man, the strategist who can package the concept.' 
</P>
<P>
Teltschik, for example, authored Kohl's famous 10-point program last November 
that became the first clear blueprint for German unity within a more unified 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
That speech cast German unification for the first time as a near-term issue and 
proposed a confederated relationship between the two Germanys as an interim 
step toward eventual unity. 
</P>
<P>
"With that speech the chancellor took the lead on the issue of unification -- 
domestically and internationally," Teltschik said during an hourlong interview 
in his chancellery office. "We were heavily attacked for it (domestically), but 
internationally, it couldn't have surprised France or others. They've known for 
years the chancellor has been for reunification. What we tried to do is 
elaborate a concept of how to manage it." 
</P>
<P>
When Kohl travels abroad, Teltschik is rarely far away. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow last February, he drafted the chancellor's statement welcoming Soviet 
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's green light on unity. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, he was the lone policy adviser to accompany Kohl for a weekend 
meeting with President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III at Camp 
David, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Teltschik was born in the Sudetenland in 1940, in what is now Czechoslovakia, 
and his family became part of the wave of German refugees forced to flee west 
in the wake of the Nazi collapse. 
</P>
<P>
He studied political science, contemporary history and civil law at the Free 
University in Berlin before heading a Christian Democrat working group on 
inner-German and foreign policy matters. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl picked him out of the party apparatus in 1972 to write speeches and run 
his office as premier of the West German state of Rhineland Palatinate. 
</P>
<P>
The two have been together since. 
</P>
<P>
When Kohl became chancellor in October, 1982, his inexperience in foreign 
affairs and an alleged mistrust of the Foreign Ministry led him to break with a 
long-held tradition that the Foreign Ministry supplied the chancellory's 
foreign affairs adviser. 
</P>
<P>
He brought Teltschik instead. 
</P>
<P>
Those who know them both say Teltschik fashioned a Kohl foreign policy from a 
few general concepts that Kohl inherited mainly from the country's first 
Christian Democratic chancellor, Konrad Adenauer: strong relationships with 
France and the United States, commitments to the European Community and the 
Atlantic Alliance and reconciliation with old enemies. 
</P>
<P>
The work provided Kohl with enough to keep abreast of his highly experienced 
Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher. 
</P>
<P>
But as is true with the man he serves, hard-edged comments occasionally land 
Teltschik in controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of Genscher's Free Democrats, who are the junior partners in 
Kohl's ruling coalition, recently demanded Teltschik's head for what they 
perceived as his slight of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. 
Responding to the Soviet official's prediction that Germany unity would 
probably take years to achieve, Teltschik quipped publicly that Shevardnadze 
would be surprised how fast unity comes. 
</P>
<P>
"I was attacked that I can't speak in such a way to a foreign minister like 
Schevardnadze," Teltschik said, "but that's crazy, because I'm sure he's heard 
much worse things." 
</P>
<P>
He was also accused of attempting to destabilize East Germany on the eve of its 
first free elections last month after being widely quoted as saying the country 
was effectively bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
"Teltschik will say things that Kohl doesn't dare," commented Josef Thesing, 
head of the international department at the Konrad Adenauer Institute, a 
Christian Democratic Union think tank. 
</P>
<P>
A family man who enjoys tennis and likes to work late and sleep late, Teltschik 
has a relaxed, informal manner and quick smile that puts visitors quickly at 
ease in either English or German. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got the charm and humility of a young man," noted a colleague who once 
worked with him. "He doesn't try to impress people, but he's tough. He's easily 
underestimated." 
</P>
<P>
His easygoing manner has enabled him to cultivate a prickly Bonn press corps 
and at least partly offset the impact of Kohl's own stiff, combative encounters 
with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
This role, coupled with his direct, open manner, has helped make him a 
personality in a country where government servants seem collectively allergic 
to publicity. 
</P>
<P>
The West German press gleefully catalogues his alleged run-ins with the Foreign 
Ministry, and magazines feel compelled to inform readers of his favorite color, 
personal motto, literary heroes and political villains. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry officials decline to comment publicly on their alleged 
differences with Teltschik. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not obligated to talk about a civil servant in the federal 
chancellery," said a ministry spokesman. "We never respond to Teltschik." 
</P>
<P>
Privately, however, there is frequent sniping and complaints of rough-edged, 
ill-considered comments. 
</P>
<P>
He has been blamed for the 1985 fiasco that led President Ronald Reagan to lay 
a wreath at a German war cemetery in the small town of Bitburg that contained 
graves of Hitler's SS troops and for a similar reconciliation gesture that went 
awry during Kohl's November visit to Poland. 
</P>
<P>
When, during a magazine interview, Teltschik listed the Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini of Iran along with Hitler and Stalin as his three most despised 
leaders, Foreign Ministry officials complained to reporters that he was 
damaging already touchy German-Iranian relations. 
</P>
<P>
Teltschik claims that the chancellery's differences with Genscher are often 
overplayed by the press, and political observers agree the clashes are usually 
more personal than policy-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure there are differences, but we have to cooperate," said Teltschik. 
"Sometimes we do it in a brilliant way, sometimes in not-so-brilliant way." 
</P>
<P>
If differences exist between Teltschik and Kohl, they rarely surface, even in 
private discussions with third parties, according to those who know them both. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of an interview, Teltschik made these points: 
</P>
<P>
* The Germans would be the first to lose if the North Atlatnic Treaty 
Organization were dissolved, he said, but he stressed that arms control 
agreements and an overhaul of existing strategies will radically diminish 
NATO's military character. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the NATO from yesterday or today, but the NATO of tomorrow we are 
discussing, and that will be much easier for (a united) Germany to be a 
member," Teltschik said. 
</P>
<P>
* The George Bush presidency is "a stroke of luck for us, because he supports 
German policy completely and unconditionally." 
</P>
<P>
* The East Germans, not the West German chancellery, have set the pace of 
German unity. 
</P>
<P>
"When it is said in the United States that unity is like a steamroller, there's 
only one such steamroller, and that is the people of the GDR (German Democratic 
Republic -- East Germany). They are forcing the pace of unity; they determine 
the tempo, not us." 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, Teltschik is a contradiction -- an unquestionably bright, 
politically ambitious man who has chosen to serve rather than lead. 
</P>
<P>
Acquaintainces say he has frequently considered leaving and at one point was on 
the verge of seeking a parliamentary seat in Bavaria, where he grew up. But 
Kohl refused to let him go. 
</P>
<P>
Teltschik himself tends to fend off questions of his personal future. 
</P>
<P>
"There might come a time when I've decided I've had enough, but it's not so 
easy, you know," he said with a smile. "I'm a civil servant, and if I quit my 
job, I lose all my benefits." 
</P>

GARBO: A VEIL LIFTS; 
</P>
<P>
NOW THAT SHE'S DEAD, DETAILS OF HER RECLUSIVE LIFE ARE EMERGING

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the best of times, she played "damn good" tennis, snacked on brown beans 
and Triscuits, owned Renoirs and pricey real estate on Rodeo Drive and spent a 
day running the elevators in her Manhattan apartment building when the staff 
went out on strike. 
</P>
<P>
During the worst of times, she was a brooding old woman beset with health 
problems, living a ghostly existence, shuttling between her home and the 
hospital and bidding farewell to close friends as she neared death. 
</P>
<P>
But only now, one week after her cremation, is the 50-year cloak of mystery 
that shrouded Greta Garbo in reclusion being lifted for a curious world. 
</P>
<P>
So good at keeping her secrets while she was alive, Garbo's friends now feel 
somewhat freer to talk about the woman they loved. 
</P>
<P>
Mimi Pollack, an 87-year-old Swedish actress who had a 70-year correspondence 
with Garbo, says she received a despondent goodby letter from "The Devine" two 
years ago. "She told me she wouldn't write any more because she was ill," 
Pollack recalls sadly. 
</P>
<P>
Just two weeks before Garbo died on April 15 at age 84, her one-time friend and 
walking companion Raymond Daum said he stopped by her apartment during a trip 
to Manhattan. Daum, curator of the Gloria Swanson Archives at the University of 
Texas in Austin, hadn't seen her in some time because she had been "retreating 
more and more," he says. "She didn't see many people, and I was worried about 
her." 
</P>
<P>
Garbo's doorman recognized Daum and told him the star wasn't well enough to 
receive him. Disappointed, Daum scribbled a chatty note to Garbo. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me take it up to her right away," Daum says the doorman told him. "She's 
had a bad day." 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult to search below the surface of the sensational headlines of the 
tabloid press and the relentless fawning by film reviewers to find the truth 
about this star who had a knack for public solitude. 
</P>
<P>
Publishers are racing to the presses with unauthorized biographies and 
previously unknown interviews of the late star, including one memoir -- 
purported to be told in her own words -- that sat in a locked vault for 14 
years and was disparaged by Garbo as a hoax. 
</P>
<P>
In Sweden, a previously unknown Garbo heir has suddenly surfaced. And, 
strangest of all, are the flurry of close encounters with Garbo suddenly being 
disclosed, some from the most unlikeliest of sources such as political 
commentator Daniel Schorr and newspaper columnist William Safire. 
</P>
<P>
"It's as if, with her death, a veil has been lifted," explains Bengt Forslund, 
artistic director of the Swedish Film Institute in Stockholm. "The problem now 
will be to separate the fact from the fiction." 
</P>
<P>
Even now, details about her final resting place are still sketchy, though a 
spokesman for the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel in Manhattan, where private 
funeral services were held a week ago, disclosed that Garbo's ashes might be 
buried in a family grave in Stockholm. Swedish journalist Sven Broman, who 
interviewed the actress and wrote a book about her, quotes Garbo's niece, Grae 
Reisfeld, as saying it was her aunt's wish to be buried in Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
Garbo's friends say Reisfeld, the wife of a Passaic, N.J., gynecologist and 
daughter of Garbo's brother Sven Gustafsson, is the heir to the actress' 
immense estate, valued by insiders at $50 million in stocks, real estate, art 
and antiques. Also expected to receive a bequest is Garbo's aide of 31 years, 
Claire Koger, who has denied tabloid reports that Garbo adopted her. "Never, 
never, it is silly talking," the New York Post quoted her as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Garbo friends dismiss rumors that she left her fortune to Sweden's 13-year-old 
Princess Victoria, eldest child of King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia and 
first in line to the Swedish throne. 
</P>
<P>
"That was written up in the scandal press two years ago, and denied at the 
time. I've heard nothing about it now," says Forslund. "My understanding is 
that she left it to her relative in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Reisfeld had been staying in Manhattan for months to be near her sick aunt, 
insiders say, and was at Garbo's bedside when she died. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, however, the respected Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported 
that Gustafsson also had an illegitimate son who no one knew about, not even 
Garbo. The man, identified as 64-year-old Oalken Frederickson living in the 
small town of Oxelosund, has not yet indicated whether he plans to lay claim to 
any part of Garbo's fortune. 
</P>
<P>
Garbo's death from heart and kidney failure caught many by surprise. Only 
Garbo's closest friends knew she was receiving dialysis treatments for six 
hours three times a week -- Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays -- at New York 
Hospital's Rogosin Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Daum says that Garbo also suffered from gastrointestinal and periodontal 
ailments. One photograph showed Garbo on her way to the hospital walking with a 
sturdy cane and holding Koger's arm. Pollack explains that Garbo had blood 
circulation problems that prevented her from walking by herself. 
</P>
<P>
"She smoked too much," says Pollack, who sent Garbo a letter last month in 
which "I told her she mustn't smoke anymore. But I'm very sorry to say that I 
was the one who taught her to smoke when we were young girls. I thought it was 
a wonderful thing to smoke. I didn't know about the dangers then." 
</P>
<P>
Insiders vehemently deny published reports that Garbo had become a heavy 
drinker in the months preceding her death. (The New York Daily News, in a story 
headlined, "Garbo's Booze, Butts, Hazy Nights," quoted unnamed sources as 
saying she required one bottle of Stolichnaya and two bottles of Cutty Sark 
each week during the final months of her life.) 
</P>
<P>
"She absolutely has not been a drinker," Forslund states. 
</P>
<P>
Daum notes that after one of their long walks, he and Garbo would sit down 
together and have a drink. "She would drink Scotch or vodka, but she could 
check herself. She knew when to stop," he insists. 
</P>
<P>
And Pollack, asked whether Garbo had a drinking problem, responds angrily, 
"That's not true. She wasn't drinking much. She was drinking like you and me." 
</P>
<P>
Before her illness, Garbo spent four decades on the streets of New York in the 
most ordinary of pursuits -- walking up to 11 miles a day, window shopping in 
neighborhood stores and patronizing Madison Avenue art galleries and 
Manhattan's many museums, friends say. 
</P>
<P>
She always took in the city sights with a brisk stride, athletic air and erect 
posture, wrapped in mannish pants and unadorned cloth coats, shod in flat 
loafers, and hidden by a fedora and sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, New Yorkers left her alone, except for the occasional prying 
photographer or startled tourist or "kook," as she put it. When strangers would 
ask, "Are you who I think you are," she would reply simply, "No," or put her 
index finger to her mouth and say, "Shhh." 
</P>
<P>
And around her unprepossessing apartment building at 450 E. 52nd St., where she 
occupied the entire fifth floor (her seven-room home overlooked the United 
Nations and East River), an unwritten rule developed whereby neighbors would 
avert their eyes whenever they encountered "The Face." 
</P>
<P>
The only people able to bring her out of her self-imposed hiding were her 
friends and her former countrymen (Garbo became an U. S. citizen in 1951). 
Though she would refuse invitations to the White House, she agreed in 1983 to 
receive the Swedish Order of the North Star in a ceremony at the New York home 
of a friend. But every time Sweden's Consul General in New York tried to throw 
her a birthday party, she refused. Instead, the diplomats always sent flowers. 
</P>
<P>
But for her friends, she seemed to make time. Daum met her in 1963 while 
working as a film and television producer for the United Nations. Invited to a 
New Year's Day party at actor Zachary Scott's apartment, Daum spotted Garbo 
sitting alone on an ottoman and talking to George Schlee, a millionaire 
investor and Garbo's business manager. Schlee was reputed to be Garbo's lover 
(Schlee's wife, Valentina, was a famous society fashion designer who dressed 
Garbo). 
</P>
<P>
"The theater crowd was scared to death to approach her and say hello, but I 
asked Schlee to make introductions," Daum recalls. "For some reason we hit it 
off perfectly. She asked 'Schleeski' to fetch her a glass of vodka and we 
talked until late in the evening." 
</P>
<P>
The pair discovered that they were neighbors, and soon they became walking 
partners. The result is "Walking With Garbo," a collections of conversations 
"recorded" by Daum (he scribbled down notes after their conversations, he 
says), which was sold to Harper &amp; Row for a six-figure advance. 
</P>
<P>
One publishing house editor who chose not to bid on the book criticized Daum's 
material on Garbo as full of "the most inane little things. She didn't come off 
well. She sounded like a ditz." 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Kot, senior editor at Harper &amp; Row, defends the project. "We 
felt completely opposite. It's an affectionate portrait of a friend by a 
friend." 
</P>
<P>
Daum stayed friendly with Garbo until the early 1970s when he decided to leave 
Manhattan after being mugged. "She was on the phone to me in the hospital every 
day. She couldn't have been sweeter," Daum recalls. After he left town, he saw 
her only infrequently. "She always said that when people moved out of her 
neighborhood, it was as if they had died," Daum recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their friendship, Daum says Garbo was impossible to get to know well. 
"She told you what she wanted to tell you. She kept us all in compartments." 
</P>
<P>
And when Daum would urge her to socialize more, he says she would tell him, "I 
want to do more with people, but I can't. I can't help it. I was born that 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Daum believes Garbo's ways stemmed from her need for quiet. "Noise bothered 
her. She didn't like loudness or excitement. She liked things quiet," he says. 
Even the sounds of a person humming or the traffic from nearby FDR Drive 
wafting up to her apartment were noxious to her. 
</P>
<P>
During their time together, Daum says, Garbo "could outwalk me" and play 
strenuous tennis at the home of a friend in Greenwich, Conn. She was "damn 
good," Daum recalls. 
</P>
<P>
But she also worried that "the human beings" in New York were getting killed 
off by air pollution because they were "looking so pale and putty." She often 
said how she felt sorry for the "poor little people." 
</P>
<P>
Hopeless at cooking -- she made coffee in a casserole dish -- Garbo preferred 
to buy delicacies from gourmet groceries. She was especially fond of take-out 
food from the Swedish deli Nyborg &amp; Nelson in her neighborhood -- cheese, 
Triscuits and brown beans. "We would often have these little meals on tray 
tables in her apartment," Daum recalls. But for most of her life, she followed 
the diet advice of her former lover, the late California nutritionist Gayelord 
Hauser. 
</P>
<P>
Daum maintains that Garbo knew he was writing a book about her (the manuscript 
will be delivered to the publisher this summer and excerpts were published last 
year in Life magazine). "I sent her pages. She read them and she did not 
protest." 
</P>
<P>
But Garbo did protest an alleged "authorized biography" that Simon &amp; 
Schuster has just announced will be released in a matter of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The biography, titled "Garbo" and written by the late Polish emigre author 
Antoni Gronowicz, had been held back from publication and kept in a locked 
vault after being acquired in 1976 on the understanding that it would not be 
published during the actress' lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
Gronowicz, who died in 1985, claimed to have met Garbo in Geneva in 1938 and 
been an intimate friend more than 20 years. But in 1978, Garbo emerged from her 
reclusion to issue a sworn affidavit through her lawyer saying that "I have 
never at any time entertained any type of human relationship whether of 
friendship, acquaintance or otherwise" with Gronowicz," or authorized or 
collaborated with Gronowicz on the account of her life. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Gronowicz maintained that she didn't want the book published out 
of fear it would damage her reputation because it contained details of her 
sexual encounters with some of the world's most famous personalities. "She is 
trying to destroy me," the writer declared. 
</P>
<P>
Besides describing her affairs with her discoverer Mauritz Stiller, co-star 
John Gilbert and conductor Leopold Stokowski, "Gronowicz also recalls Miss 
Garbo talking about the often-rumored fact that 'women pursued (her) more often 
and more persistently' than did men," Simon &amp; Schuster announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred A. Knopf also is readying what it calls a "full-scale" biography by 
Barry Paris who wrote about silent screen star and author Louise Brooks last 
year. The book won't reach bookstores for another year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
One memoir that won't be released, however, is Mimi Pollack's, Garbo's 
classmate at the Royal Dramatic Theater school in Stockholm. Pollack was 18 and 
Garbo 17 when they met. When Garbo moved to Hollywood, the two women began 
their correspondence. Garbo was godmother to Pollack's son. 
</P>
<P>
Still working in the Stockholm theater, Pollack pledges she will never publish 
her letters from Garbo. "She didn't even know that I kept all the letters." 
</P>
<P>
Garbo's friends also helped her amass her immense wealth. 
</P>
<P>
Garbo became a millionaire by age 26 by asking for an unprecedented $350,000 a 
picture, and Schlee put together a "fabulous" portfolio of stocks for her over 
the years. Hauser invested in property on Rodeo Drive before it became one of 
the most sought-after streets in the nation with Garbo as his silent partner, 
according to Daum. 
</P>
<P>
Daum also recalls seeing at least one Renoir in Garbo's apartment. "She loved 
Impressionists and 18th-Century French furniture," Daum recalls. "She was 
always on the lookout for art and antiques. I remember her secretary would 
scold her, 'My God, you're spending that much,' or 'We're spending a lot of 
money this week.' And Garbo would look sheepish." 
</P>
<P>
Baroness Cecile de Rothschild, whom Garbo "adored because she was a lot of fun 
and full of life," helped Garbo assemble her art collection. International art 
dealer Richard Feigen recalls a time in 1966 when Rothschild brought Garbo to 
his offices to look at some paintings by Soviet artist Alexei Jawlensky. "I 
don't know who's idea that was. Garbo just sat there and had a cup of tea and 
didn't say anything," Feigen says. "I didn't sell them anything that day." 
</P>
<P>
Garbo also traveled with Rothschild to Paris, Athens and even the Manhattan 
restaurant Mortimer's, a haunt of New York society, where Garbo would insist on 
one of the "worst" tables in the rear room near the kitchen door. 
</P>
<P>
And it was through Rothschild that Garbo found her beloved second home in 
Klosters, Switzerland (which she traveled to under aliases such as Harriet 
Brown, an homage to her favorite director Clarence Brown). 
</P>
<P>
But Garbo never let wealth affect her, Daum says. Indeed, she remained a 
paradox to the very end. Every Christmas she gave a $25 tip to the doormen at 
her apartment building -- cheap by anyone's standards. Even Garbo's.

BASKETBALL: HIS PERSONALITY WAS OVERSHADOWED BY THAT OF HIS FAMOUS FRIEND --

<P>
After Loyola Marymount's NCAA basketball tournament run ended recently, Bo 
Kimble was cruising on Wilshire Boulevard in the Beverly Hills area. At a 
stoplight, a car pulled up. The driver did a double-take and rolled down his 
window. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo?" he inquired. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble nodded. 
</P>
<P>
The guy hollered, "I love you, man. I just wanted you to know that." 
</P>
<P>
Kimble related the story with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
"White guy, too," he added. "Not that it matters. I have far more fans now, and 
not (just) basketball people. People from all over. Very few athletes in 
college have an opportunity for America to see their personality. It means a 
lot to me." 
</P>
<P>
The love affair between the public and Kimble is relatively new. People didn't 
always love him. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, when Loyola Marymount was winning its first West Coast 
Conference tournament, an opposing coach came through the press room fuming 
that the Lions, led by sophomore stars Hank Gathers and Bo Kimble, were guilty 
of numerous cheap shots and unsportsmanlike conduct. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got a nice team, and those guys are good players," the coach grumbled. 
"It's too bad they've got to pull that low-class stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Now, it's hard to find anyone who uses the term low-class in the same sentence 
with Kimble. 
</P>
<P>
He has been a very good player for a long time, and proved it when he was 
physically sound for a full season after two years of nagging knee problems. He 
led the nation in scoring and the Lions into the final eight of the NCAA. 
Scouts project him as a probable lottery pick in the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
But Kimble drew the nation's attention for what he did after his boyhood 
friend, Gathers, died six weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, Kimble became the Lions' spokesman and symbol -- first for 
the team's pain, then for its resilience. He never made a wrong move. He never 
said the wrong thing. His words and deeds took on an eloquence that drew a 
nationwide response. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers died on Sunday night, March 4. The next morning, at a news conference, 
a bleary-eyed Kimble broke down as he said, "Hank, I miss you so much." 
</P>
<P>
It was a genuine emotion and was televised on virtually every news program that 
night. A half hour later, he was talking calmly to the press and vowing to 
carry on for his friend. 
</P>
<P>
At a memorial Mass in the school's Gersten Pavilion the next day, he again made 
the perfect gesture, asking the overflow crowd for "one final ovation for Hank 
in his house." 
</P>
<P>
As the gym shook, he was embraced by the Gathers family, and he left the 
service with an arm around Gathers' mother, Lucille. Again, Kimble was shown on 
most network news highlights. 
</P>
<P>
In the NCAA tournament, he again came up with the appropriate touch: Gathers, 
who had problems shooting free throws, had shot them left-handed this season, 
so Kimble would shoot the first free throw of each game left-handed. 
</P>
<P>
The first opportunity presented itself in Long Beach, during the second half of 
an emotional game against New Mexico State. Swish. 
</P>
<P>
In the tournament, he went on to make all three left-handed free throws. 
</P>
<P>
All the while, Kimble was talking to anyone and everyone, endearing himself to 
the media and fans in a whirlwind series of interviews and pep talks. 
</P>
<P>
The word inspirational may be overused in sports, but Loyola's spirit clearly 
inspired imaginations, with Kimble viewed as the leader. Kimble had become a 
bigger-than-basketball hero. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots (of people) have come up to me and complimented our team," Kimble said. 
"They really appreciate how I showed leadership. They say the message was an 
inspiration to everyone -- it was not about winning and losing but how you play 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
In the eyes of those close to him, a more mature, thoughtful Kimble has 
emerged. Kimble said it was there all the time, waiting to be discovered. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've always been mature," he said. "To people (watching), this brought 
it to the forefront." 
</P>
<P>
Said Loyola Coach Paul Westhead: "His greatest achievement after Hank's death 
-- he had his arms around Lucille Gathers and the family, helping them. Three 
hours later, he had his arms around his teammates, helping them." 
</P>
<P>
David Spencer, the former USC assistant coach who recruited Kimble and Gathers, 
and who now represents Kimble for the Management Plus agency, said the new 
perception of Kimble is "on the money." 
</P>
<P>
Spencer said that at Orlando, Fla., recently, where college seniors gathered 
for a series of all-star games, the hotel manager told him Kimble was "the most 
delightful player" there, and commented on how Kimble signed autographs for 
lines of kids and seemed to attract fans. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't surprise me in the least," Spencer said. "He's always been a 
sweetheart kid. He always had that kind of stuff. Unfortunately, it took a 
tragic occurrence to bring that out. I was proud of him and pleased for him, 
but I wasn't surprised. I would've been surprised if he fell apart. 
Fortunately, (until recently) he was allowed to just be a normal college kid. 
The last six weeks, he was not." 
</P>
<P>
While in Orlando, Kimble accepted the Pete Maravich Award on Gathers' behalf 
and was asked to speak at halftime of an Orlando Magic game. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like I'm the spokesman for Loyola and the Gathers family," he said. 
"Everyone wants to hear what I say. It's amazing how 17,000 people go silent. 
People want to hear." 
</P>
<P>
Kimble said he has "learned a lot about myself as a person" from the ordeal and 
thinks he has managed to put the last six weeks in perspective. And the 
cheerful side he has shown, he said, has not been forced. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I am when I'm speaking is the way I really am," he said. "The only 
time I was really bothered was the first press conference. I think my habits 
are a little more similar now to Hank's. He was the outgoing one, so when I was 
around him, I was always more quiet. Now I feel myself being more aggressive, 
going out of my way to do some of the duties I've been asked. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm surprised at all, I'm surprised at the strength part of it, how I'm 
keeping myself upbeat. But when I remember Hank, that's how I always think of 
him, laughing and getting on everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Kimble finds that, at odd moments, he flashes on a memory of Gathers. He had 
such an occurrence a few days ago, he said, when he visited KTLA-TV, where they 
had been interns and used to race each other back to campus. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked in the rear-view mirror for him and he wasn't there," said Kimble. "I 
looked and I remembered . . . That was the closest (moment) to the normal life 
I was living, and he's not there. That was my first taste that he wasn't there. 
I'm sure there (will) be many others." 
</P>
<P>
The left-handed free throw took on such a life of its own that Kimble said he 
may retire it, or try his first NBA foul shot lefty and leave it at that. 
</P>
<P>
In Loyola's last game against eventual NCAA champion Nevada Las Vegas, Rebel 
center David Butler told Kimble he was rooting for him to make the free throw. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me, 'When you made it, I was clapping.' It's amazing how everyone 
wants me to shoot it," Kimble said. "Everyone wants to see it. Obviously, it 
meant a lot to a lot of people, including myself. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'm going to continue to do that. That was special for me, I was 
three for three, and that was college basketball. I don't want to spoil a good 
moment. It won't have the same effect for the fans and for me. I think I'll 
just wear a patch or put his number on my sneaks." 
</P>
<P>
A strange twist to Kimble's odyssey is that dealing with his best friend's 
death has probably enhanced his standing in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's any question," Spencer said. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble said: "My agent said a couple of scouting reports said I was the 
strongest person in the draft as a human being. That made me feel good." 
</P>
<P>
Kimble will graduate May 12 -- his family will come from Philadelphia to attend 
-- then will work out while anticipating the draft. Given the chance, he would 
like to stay in Los Angeles. He has also been contacted by Italian teams -- an 
interesting option, he said, but only as a backup. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo doesn't want to go to Italy," he said. "My whole career has been geared 
toward going to the NBA, not Europe." 
</P>
<P>
The NBA scouts' -- and the public's -- impression of Kimble is a decided 
improvement over that opposing coach's early opinion, in which Kimble came off 
as a bit of a punk. 
</P>
<P>
"Hank and myself were good people, and I want people to see that," Kimble said. 
"You can't dribble the ball forever, (but) I think I'll always be the same 
person I am right now." 
</P>
