Vice President Dan Quayle told a Chicago audience that the principal job of his 
wife, Marilyn, is to take care of him. Last week, in an interview with The 
Times, Mrs. Quayle, 39, who is a lawyer, had suggested that she was considering 
returning to work or becoming involved in some sort of cause. "I haven't ruled 
it out," she told The Times. "I think we are moving to a place where the 
question shouldn't ever cross anyone's mind, 'Why should the Second Lady work?' 
I think I've been given talents I should use." But when asked at the annual 
meeting of the Associated Press whether his wife might soon espouse some new 
cause or interest, Quayle seemed to throw cold water on the idea. "She has a 
very major cause, and a very major interest that is a very complex and 
consuming issue with her," the vice president replied with a smile. "And that's 
me." The Quayles have three children aged 14, 12 and 10. Mrs. Quayle practiced 
law in Huntington, Ind., until 1976, when her husband was elected to Congress.

 -- After 100 years as an all-male bastion, members of the Players Club in New 
York City decided they wanted some female companionship. So, on its 100th 
anniversary, the club founded by celebrated Shakespearean actor Edwin Booth 
inducted 30 women, including actress Helen Hayes. Previously, women had been 
permitted into the club only on April 23, William Shakespeare's birthday. The 
1,000-member club for actors, performers and writers also gave Hayes the first 
Edwin Booth Award for her lifetime achievement in theater. Also inducted were 
Eudora Welty, Lauren Bacall, Carol Burnett, Mary Tyler Moore, Agnes de Mille, 
Colleen Dewhurst, Lillian Gish, Angela Lansbury, Toni Morrison, Dina Merrill 
and Kitty Carlisle Hart.

 -- Ohio Gov. Richard F. Celeste drew upon his sense of humor during a 
"portrait" competition at a ceremony opening a new pressroom. Kirk Walters of 
the Toledo Blade, whose drawings of Celeste as a modern-day King Louis XIV of 
France -- with over-the-shoulder curls and spectacles -- won first place in the 
competition judged by reporters in Columbus. "If you have a good chin, you 
might as well use it," said Celeste, who has a jutting chin. Walters said 
Celeste has a profile "that is easy to draw . . . a half-moon face." The news 
conference room is in a new state office building, across the street from the 
Statehouse. Celeste moved his office to the new building weeks ago. SHIRLEY

EGYPT JAILS 1,500 MILITANTS

In a nationwide crackdown on extremist agitation, Egyptian security authorities 
have reportedly arrested about 1,500 alleged Muslim militants in the last two 
weeks. The arrests followed an April 7 clash between Muslim zealots and police 
in the town of Fayoum, southwest of Cairo, that left eight people wounded, 
officials said. Maj. Gen. Zaki Badr, Cairo's interior minister, said he has 
ordered a probe to determine whether there was foreign involvement in a recent 
wave of anti-government activity. Badr, whose remarks were carried by the 
Middle East News Agency, did not elaborate. Muslim militants have been 
campaigning for years for an Egyptian society based on Islamic law.

Four people were arrested in Berkeley after they chained themselves to a 
concrete slab poured over the weekend in an effort to build a permanent toilet 
on University of California-owned People's Park. The protesters were cited on 
misdemeanor charges of entering property with the intent to cause damage, said 
university police. Campus workers later tore up the slab and carted it away. 
There was no resistance by those arrested, although police said officers had to 
use bolt cutters to remove them. On Thursday, 50 people commemorating the 20th 
anniversary of the founding of the park started building the toilet, only to 
have it torn up the next morning by campus workers and police. They returned 
over the weekend. The park had its beginning on April 20, 1969, when activists 
began occupying the empty 2.3-acre lot, which had been bought by the university 
10 months earlier.

Israelis rampaged through the West Bank city of Hebron, witnesses said, 
smashing shop and car windows after Palestinians stoned their tour buses. 
Elsewhere in the occupied territories, Arab hospitals said that Israeli troops 
shot and wounded 19 Palestinians on the third successive day of heavy 
casualties. The rampage in Hebron, a stronghold of hard-line Jewish settlers, 
was the second incident in three days in which Jews were accused of retaliating 
against Palestinians who stoned their vehicles. Israeli troops broke up the 
confrontation with tear gas and shots in the air, news agencies said. No 
injuries were reported.

Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, starting a European tour, said in Paris 
that he wants Europe to help his country normalize its ties with the United 
States. During lunch with Francois Mitterrand, Ortega asked the French 
president to intercede for Nicaragua when he meets President Bush next month in 
Washington. Later, in Brussels, Ortega asked President Jacques Delors of the 
European Community for a substantial increase in European aid to his country.

Social Security trustees pronounced the program financially sound well into the 
next century, able to pay benefits for the next 57 years. An annual report to 
Congress by the Social Security trustees projected that income to the Old Age 
and Survivors and Disability Insurance Trust Funds will exceed benefits paid 
out for the next three decades. After that, the combined trust funds will run a 
deficit until funds are exhausted in 2046. "However, the expected accumulation 
of the trust funds during the next 20 to 30 years provides ample time to 
monitor the financial status of the program and to take corrective action at 
some time in the future," the report said.

Jury selection began in federal court in Seattle in the case of a woman who 
says drinking during pregnancy caused birth defects in her son. Candace and 
Harold Thorp filed suit against the makers of Jim Beam bourbon for not putting 
warning labels on its bottles. The couple's 4-year-old son, Michael, was born 
mentally retarded, neurologically impaired, developmentally stunted, with 
facial and other body malformations, according to the lawsuit. The Thorps sued 
the James B. Beam Distillery Co. of Deerfield, Ill., claiming it should have 
provided labels warning that alcohol can cause birth defects. Twenty-nine 
potential jurors were called. Mrs. Thorp said in court documents she drank up 
to a half a fifth per day of Jim Beam bourbon while she was pregnant and did 
not know her drinking would damage her child.

RULES BAR SHIPS FROM DUMPING PLASTIC 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The federal government barred ships from dumping plastic garbage into the 
ocean, saying hundreds of thousands of birds, marine mammals and turtles die 
each year after eating or becoming entangled in the debris. In announcing the 
new regulations, Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner said plastic debris 
accounted for 4% of all refuse that is tossed into the ocean each year and its 
resistance to natural breakdown means it can persist in the environment for 
long periods of time. The Coast Guard rules comply with an international 
agreement known as the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution 
from Ships. The regulations apply to U.S. flag vessels anywhere in the world 
and to foreign ships within 200 miles of the U.S. coast.

JUDGE BOWS OUT, CITES OLD TIES TO SILBERMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U. S. District Judge John S. Rhoades on Monday removed himself from the 
money-laundering case of Richard T. Silberman, several hours after revealing in 
court that he had represented Silberman in lawsuits and may have donated money 
to the political campaign of Silberman's wife, San Diego County Supervisor 
Susan Golding. 
</P>
<P>
The case has been reassigned to U. S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving. 
</P>
<P>
Rhoades said at a hearing Monday morning that he had no plans to step down and 
felt "comfortable" staying on the case. However, he changed his mind Monday 
afternoon and informed lawyers in the case that it will be transferred. Rhoades 
is expected to issue a written order on the matter today. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, a powerful political fund-raiser and former top aide to Gov. Edmund 
G. Brown Jr., was arraigned Friday, along with the three alleged accomplices, 
on two charges of laundering $300,000 in funds portrayed to him by an 
undercover FBI agent as profits from Colombian cocaine trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
They also are charged with one count of conspiring to launder money and avoid 
federal laws requiring the reporting of transactions involving cash sums of 
$10,000 or more. The alleged accomplices are Chris Petti of San Diego and 
Darryl Nakatsuka and Jack Norman Myers of Los Angeles. All but Petti are free 
on bond. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Case Continued 
</P>
<P>
The four appeared before Rhoades for the first time Monday morning for the 
first of what are likely to be numerous pretrial sessions. The case was 
continued for a week because only Petti has retained a lawyer, Oscar Goodman of 
Las Vegas. Silberman was represented at the hearing by San Diego lawyer Milton 
J. Silverman, who said later that no decision has been made regarding whether 
he will continue to represent Silberman. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Rhoades approved a request that the Federal Defenders Office 
be appointed to represent Nakatsuka, who allegedly was a courier in the 
money-laundering scheme. 
</P>
<P>
When the hearing began Monday morning, Rhoades said that, in "about 1960," 
while he was in private practice, he represented Silberman and another man in a 
zoning variation case involving the city of San Diego. He said he represented 
Silberman again in 1973 or 1974 in a civil case in which Silberman and several 
others were defendants. That case was closed and settled in 1975, Rhoades said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was at (Silberman's) house, as were many others, for something concerned 
with politics in the 1970s," Rhoades added. "And my wife and I may have, I'm 
not sure, made a small political contribution to (Golding's) campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Rhoades had said early Monday that the lawyers could file motions asking him to 
remove himself from the case. "I, of course, will make my own individual 
determination as to whether I should or should not recuse myself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U. S. Atty. Charles Gorder, who is prosecuting the case, said later 
that the situation is unusual and that he had planned to consult with his 
superiors in the Justice Department about whether to file a motion asking 
Rhoades to step down.

SUIT SETTLED IN INS SEIZURE OF DOCUMENTS; 
</P>
<P>
AGENCY WILL REPLACE PAPERS, EXTEND DEADLINE FOR AMNESTY SEEKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

The U. S. Immigration and Naturalization Service agreed to a settlement Monday 
in a lawsuit filed against border inspectors who illegally seized documents 
from migrant farm workers who had applied for amnesty under a special provision 
of the 1986 Immigration Reform Act. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the settlement, announced in federal court Monday, the INS 
will provide replacement documents to the farm workers and will extend the 
deadlines for completion of amnesty applications and appeals. 
</P>
<P>
At issue in the case was whether immigration inspectors at border checkpoints 
could confiscate documents from workers whom they believed, after quick 
inspection, had committed fraud in their applications for amnesty, said Betty 
Wheeler, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
California and Texas 
</P>
<P>
All of the more than 700 workers involved in the class action suit had applied 
for amnesty under the farm workers program, Wheeler said. Their amnesty 
documents were seized as they were preparing to cross the border into 
California or Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Under the special agricultural-worker provisions of the 1986 law, migrant 
workers who could prove they had done at least 90 days of agricultural work in 
the United States between May 1, 1985, and May 1, 1986, could apply to become 
permanent residents and eventually U. S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The case was filed on behalf of the workers by the ACLU in conjunction with 
California Rural Legal Assistance and the California Rural Legal Assistance 
Foundation, both advocacy groups. The suit alleged that the practices of 
confiscating "amnesty" cards, "abusively interrogating" amnesty applicants and 
deporting or threatening to deport the applicants were violations of due 
process as well as the provisions of the 1986 legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Under the consent decree announced Monday, the INS must identify all amnesty 
applicants whose documents were confiscated and notify them of their right to a 
replacement card, which gives them the right to work in the United States and 
to travel abroad. Workers whose amnesty applications were denied by the INS in 
administrative hearings after their cards were confiscated will be allowed to 
file another appeal and will receive replacement cards. 
</P>
<P>
Applicants who received 90-day permits allowing them to enter the United States 
to gather documents to support their amnesty applications, but had their 
permits confiscated at the border, will receive new permits and will be allowed 
to complete their applications. 
</P>
<P>
Several issues remain unresolved, including whether the INS must expunge from 
its records the "confessions" made by applicants during questioning at the 
border. The lawsuit alleges that those statements were coerced by border 
inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing on the remaining issues will be held next week before U. S. District 
Judge J. Lawrence Irving.

San Diego's children fear for their safety and want a city with more parks, 
trees and playgrounds, according to a survey released Monday by a nonprofit 
child advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
KidsPlace, which is dedicated to raising the community's awareness of 
youngsters' needs, also found a high level of concern about homeless people 
downtown and a desire for cleaner streets among the nearly 10,000 children, 
ages 7 to 18, who completed its survey. 
</P>
<P>
The priority list was compiled from the schoolchildren's answers to the request 
that they "describe the kind of neighborhood that you would build for kids to 
live in if they lived downtown." The youngsters also answered 22 other 
questions on child care, transportation, living arrangements, community 
planning and leisure activities. 
</P>
<P>
"The clearest directive KidsPlace has gotten from our young people in the 1989 
survey is that we need to continue and expand this process of community 
involvement in the consideration of development issues," the survey report 
states. The questionnaire was the second administered by the organization.

'Mayor for a Day' 
</P>
<P>
Sabina Sood, an 11-year-old Mira Mesa girl whose essay was judged the best 
response to the question, won the opportunity to serve as "mayor for a day" 
Monday. She met with top city officials, presented an award to author Theodor 
Geisel -- also known as Dr. Seuss -- and presided over a meeting of the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
In a news conference in Mayor Maureen O'Connor's office, Sabina echoed the 
survey results. "Most kids are inside watching TV and there aren't many parks," 
she said. "So I would say: 'Build more parks and activity centers.' " 
</P>
<P>
The council spent its afternoon hearing proposals from high school students on 
possible solutions to problems facing their neighborhoods and the city. The day 
comes in the middle of KidsWeek, a festival of 200 events scheduled by 50 
organizations from April 22-30. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, who has declared 1989 "The Year of the Child," is devising a series 
of recreational and educational programs for children.

CORRECTION IN MEDICARE COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) is moving quickly to reduce the tax surcharge 
covering the expansion of Medicare coverage. That is the right thing to do if, 
as he argues, an immense surplus is certain. But new doubts have been expressed 
by both President Bush and Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), chairman of the 
House Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
All three are resisting pressure to change the basic financing of the new 
program, and we commend them for that. It will be important, in working out any 
reductions, to preserve the basic concept of the program that makes it the 
first element of health insurance for those 65 and older that is self-funded, 
with seniors bearing costs proportionate to their incomes. 
</P>
<P>
The income-tax surcharge that finances the expanded program applies to about 
40% of Medicare beneficiaries. Bentsen now calculates that it can be reduced by 
at least 16%, becauseprojections now indicate a surplus of as much as $4.2 
billion over the next five years. The surplus developed because those who wrote 
the law underestimated the number of higher income older Americans subject to 
the surcharge. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, supported by Rostenkowski, is opposed to any "tinkering" at 
this time. The disagreements could invite a harsh confrontation. Better, it 
seems to us, would be an agreement to let the Medicare balance sheet settle the 
dispute, and to err on the side of going slowly if there are serious doubts. 
</P>
<P>
The refusal of these leaders to yield to pressure to abandon the surtax and to 
dip into general budget or other tax funds is welcome. Despite all the 
misunderstandings and controversy, the Medicare extension is a good program and 
a health insurance bargain even for those paying the maximum surcharge.

LOS ANGELES ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The disgracefully low turnout (25% or less) for the Los Angeles elections may 
be more a result of the apathy and stupidity of the bureaucracy already in 
place than any alleged apathy on the part of the people (Part I, April 12). 
</P>
<P>
Does anyone recall a campaign? What were the issues? What candidate made a 
public statement? When? Where? 
</P>
<P>
After receiving my voter registration card (dated March 2, effective for 
elections on or after April 4), I received three official sample ballots, sent 
for an absentee ballot, and received a letter April 6 asking me to verify my 
change of address, which I returned promptly. I still have not received my 
absentee ballot, and, like many, was unable to go to my polling place. 
</P>
<P>
Given the previously low election turnout, why didn't Los Angeles City Clerk 
Elias Martinez insist on mandatory absentee ballots? If the current do-nothing 
city government would encourage, or at least allow us to vote, we would vote 
them out of office.

approximately 2,000 items, is in the possession of the Library of Congress.

OLVERA STREET UPGRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because Olvera Street in Los Angeles is the birthplace of the state's biggest 
city, people care about preserving it. Recently the parties most directly 
involved negotiated a tenuous compromise that could start the process of 
preservation -- if the agreement doesn't break down first. 
</P>
<P>
Under the compromise, city officials would grant Olvera Street's 77 small 
businesses the right to purchase up to 50% interest in any private project to 
rehabilitate the area. The merchants, some of whose families have been on the 
street since it was made into a tourist attraction in 1929, have been fearful 
that development could result in their replacement by an "overly commercialized 
Mexican Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Richard Alatorre played a pivotal role in the compromise. Most 
of the property around Olvera Street is controlled by the city, and Alatorre 
represents the area. In the debate over Olvera Street's future, Alatorre has 
been critical of some of the demands made by the merchants. Many of the 
merchants, in turn, are suspicious of Alatorre. The potential problems that 
could scuttle the compromise stem from that estrangement. Some merchants want 
to control the entire Olvera Street development project,while Alatorre insists 
they should be content with 50%. The councilman also questions whether they can 
legally bid for full control of the project under the terms of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office studied Alatorre's question, and concluded that 
there is no legal reason to bar the merchants from bidding for the entire 
project. But Alatorre has raised a valid point, nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the merchants can come up with the financial and technical wherewithal 
to oversee the Plaza's development -- a big assumption -- fairness dictates 
that the project be open to bid by all interested parties. If the merchants 
have the best bid, fine. If not, they must be willing take "no" for an answer. 
After all, with an offer of 50% control, they would have more say on the 
Plaza's future than they had when the negotiating began. 
</P>
<P>
More compromises are going to be necessary before Olvera Street is spruced up. 
For example, preservationists insist that special care is needed if the old 
buildings there are to be refurbished with historic accuracy. Their concerns 
must also be taken into account. They will be if everyone who cares about 
Olvera Street is willing to compromise even further.

These days voting sites are difficult to obtain. I wish other businesses would

There is a dire need for workers on Election Day. Young people and men in

<P>
On Los Angeles Election Day, four of us slaved away for 13 hours at a polling 
place here in Cheviot Hills to achieve about 50% vote from our local citizens. 
But in many areas turnout amounted to only 15% or 25% of the registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Mayor Tom Bradley, Council members Joy Picus, Zev Yaroslavsky, 
Michael Woo, Joan Flores, Marvin Braude, et al were reelected. Yes, it seems 
that incumbents have the advantages, almost insurmountable, to achieve 
reelection as mayor, council member, governor, senator, representative, et al 
in local, statewide, and national elections. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, they have the backing of "emotionally informed" voters. They have 
financial backing -- salaries, perks, "dis-honorariums," campaign donations; 
bureaucratic backing and yes, incumbents enjoy almost "monopoly" backing from 
the media in the political process in the liberal camps for almost sure-fire 
reelection!

JURY DEADLOCKED IN EARLIER TRIAL; 
</P>
<P>
D.A. TO RETRY MAN ACCUSED IN AMBUSH KILLING OF OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office has decided to retry a Los 
Angeles man whose murder trial in the ambush slaying of a police officer ended 
in a mistrial, a prosecutor said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard L. Jenkins asked a Van Nuys Superior Court judge to 
set a new trial date for Duane Moody, 30, on charges of first-degree murder. 
Moody is accused of supplying the weapon used to gun down Los Angeles Police 
Detective Thomas C. Williams, 40, on Halloween, 1985, as he picked up his young 
son at a Canoga Park church school. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Kathryne Ann Stoltz scheduled a tentative trial date of July 17. At the 
same time, Stoltz agreed to hear a defense motion to dismiss the charge against 
Moody on May 11. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Atty. James Epstein said he will, among other things, ask Jenkins to 
provide the court with new evidence that might warrant a retrial. Jenkins said 
he believes that he has enough evidence for a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
Stoltz declared a mistrial on the murder charge against Moody on March 20 after 
jurors said they were deadlocked on the verdict. The jury on March 15 had 
acquitted Moody on a charge of conspiracy to commit murder. 
</P>
<P>
Moody was one of five men charged with first-degree murder in the Williams 
slaying. The same jury that deadlocked on the murder charge against Moody 
convicted Voltaire Williams, 26, of conspiracy to commit murder in February but 
acquitted him of murder. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, that jury acquitted Reecy Clem Cooper, 34, of both charges. 
</P>
<P>
Two other men, Daniel Jenkins, 33, and Rubin Antonio Moss, 26, were convicted 
of murder in a separate trial last year. In October, Daniel Jenkins was 
sentenced to die in the gas chamber, and two months later, Moss received a 
sentence of life imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
Moody admitted furnishing the automatic assault weapon used to kill the 
detective and was accused of helping to hide the gun. Epstein said Moody gave 
the gun to Daniel Jenkins because he was intimidated by him. However, he said 
his client had put glue in the gun's safety in an effort to render it 
inoperable. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Epstein had said to retry his client would be "a waste of taxpayers' 
money."

CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS BACKTRACK ON BIAS CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two civil rights groups conceded Monday night that they may have acted hastily 
by publicly demanding that Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich 
apologize for racist remarks allegedly made by members of his staff. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and 
the American Civil Liberties Union said they had taken the word of one or two 
people and had not checked with others present at a meeting where the alleged 
remarks were made. 
</P>
<P>
The Antonovich aides were accused of saying that a beer permit should not be 
granted for a Cinco de Mayo festival in Sylmar next month because Mexicans 
could not hold their liquor. 
</P>
<P>
The two organizations joined in a press conference Monday morning to demand an 
apology. They changed their position later in the day when told that four 
people who attended the meeting told The Times that they heard no such remarks. 
</P>
<P>
"If, in fact, it didn't happen, then you know we're wrong in calling for an 
apology." said Jose Garza, a MALDEF vice president. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Beer Permit Opposed 
</P>
<P>
The alleged remarks were made Thursday at a meeting about a decision by 
Antonovich's office to block the beer permit because of opposition by Los 
Angeles police. Spanish-language radio station KTNQ and promoter Richard 
Vasquez requested a permit for the festival, to be held in the county's El 
Cariso Park. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez charged that at the meeting, Antonovich aide Bill Garcia said Mexicans 
"could not control their drinking" and would sneak in alcohol in baby 
carriages. He said another Antonovich aide, Leeta Pistone, claimed that beer 
was a problem because the event was targeted at Mexican-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, who is Mexican-American, and Pistone said Monday that they were talking 
about anyone who attended the event and were not directing their remarks at 
Latinos. Los Angeles Police Sgt. Ed Arambula and county regional park manager 
Julio Guevara, who attended the meeting, told The Times that they could 
remember no derogatory remarks about people of Mexican descent. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi was also present and did 
not recall such remarks, said David Mays, the councilman's chief deputy. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez and Arturo Gonzalez, news director of KTNQ, maintained that racist 
remarks were made and that public officials naturally would deny them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Antonovich in China 
</P>
<P>
Told about the denials by others, however, MALDEF and the ACLU withdrew their 
calls for an apology. Antonovich is in China on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
"The only people we talked to were the radio station and Mr. Vasquez," Garza 
said. Before pressing further for an apology, "I'd want some confirmation that 
that happened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
ACLU spokesman Joe Hicks said: "If MALDEF is backing away from it, I see no 
reason why we would continue to push independently for an apology." 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez said he is being paid a fee for the festival, which is expected to draw 
as many as 10,000 people, and will not lose money if not allowed to serve beer.

LOTTO WINNER WANTS SHOES FOR CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Canoga Park mother of six said Monday that she wants to buy a house and 
Reeboks for the children but otherwise hasn't decided what to do with her 
winnings from her $6.38-million Lotto jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a lot of confusion," said Carol Andrisano, 42. "It's been a real 
shock. We're trying to get used to the idea." 
</P>
<P>
Her children, who range in age from 10 to 22, have deluged her with requests, 
she said. "Kids are kids; they say, 'Can I go buy a car tomorrow?' " 
</P>
<P>
Now that she's got $255,200 a year coming for the next 20 years, Andrisano said 
she and her family will move out of the one-story yellow stucco house that she 
rents in a cul de sac on Keokuk Avenue. But she said it's too early to say 
where they will go. 
</P>
<P>
She beat odds of 1 in 13.98 million, with six winning numbers on a ticket 
bought at a 7-Eleven store at Hubbard Avenue and 2nd Street in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
Andrisano, who is divorced, said she buys five tickets for each Lotto drawing 
but had never been to that store before. 
</P>
<P>
As she customarily does, she bought "quick pick" tickets. "I usually get five 
quick picks -- I don't like standing there picking numbers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday about midnight, she said, she stopped at a 7-Eleven store in Canoga 
Park to get a list of the winning numbers and couldn't believe her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran around like a lunatic, and nobody wanted to come near me. I went to a 
couple of stores because I didn't know what to do, how to go about winning like 
that." She guarded the ticket until Monday morning, when she turned it in. 
</P>
<P>
She also stopped in to tell the news at Harpi's Sandwich Shop in Canoga Park, 
where she has been working part time. "I feel she really deserves what's coming 
to her," said manager Stephen Iozzia. 
</P>
<P>
And she bought an answering machine. "At least I can screen my phone calls. I 
guess there's going to be a lot of people calling."

HEARING SCHEDULED ON CHARGES AGAINST ANTI-ABORTIONISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge in Los Angeles on Monday set a June 6 hearing to determine why 
anti-abortion activists should not be held in contempt for violating a court 
order that forbade them from closing abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
In a declaration to Judge A. Wallace Tashima, the American Civil Liberties 
Union named 20 alleged participants in abortion-clinic blockades in addition to 
the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue. The ACLU has filed for the contempt 
proceedings on behalf of medical facilities that perform abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Two of those listed in the complaint are Will Lehman of Vista and Connie 
Youngkin of Poway. The respondents have until May 15 to file written 
declarations of their defense, said Betty Wheeler, legal director of the ACLU 
Foundation of San Diego and Imperial counties. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who does not file a written declaration will not be permitted to 
testify at the evidentiary hearing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler said that, if the ACLU can show that damage was caused to either a 
clinic or an individual, the court could order the respondents to pay 
restitution. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU will be submitting more contempt-of-court proceedings against those 
who participated in the April 8 blockade of a Hillcrest doctor's office, 
Wheeler said, as well as those who participate in blockades scheduled for the 
"National Day of Rescue" on Saturday.

EQUESTRIAN CENTER; 
</P>
<P>
L.A. APPROVES RATE HIKE FOR STALL RENTALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Recreation and Parks Commissioners on Monday approved 
a controversial boost in the rental rates for horse stalls at the debt-ridden 
Los Angeles Equestrian Center in Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
The increases, which board members said are needed to help ease the center's 
financial burdens, will be as high as $36 a month for some stalls and are 
effective immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Some horse boarders had opposed the increases at previous board meetings, 
saying they were being "priced out" of the center and were being unfairly 
singled out to help the facility become profitable. 
</P>
<P>
However, just before the board's vote, many boarders said they favor the 
increase as long as the center continues operating. 
</P>
<P>
Richard J. Riordan, vice president of the five-member board, said the increases 
are essential to keep the center running until another operator can take over. 
"This will help make it a viable center for the next five years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Run by Creditor 
</P>
<P>
The center is being run by Gibraltar Savings of Beverly Hills, which plans to 
sell the facility within four months. Gibraltar, the center's largest creditor, 
took over the center in April, 1988, after it foreclosed on J. Albert Garcia, 
the previous operator. 
</P>
<P>
The 73-acre complex, most of which is in Los Angeles but whose entrance is in 
Burbank, is more than $2 million in debt. Dean W. Harrison, general counsel for 
Gibraltar, said the center is losing from $80,000 to $100,000 a month. He said 
stall rates had not gone up in two years. 
</P>
<P>
The rental rates on fully outfitted barn stalls will go from $320 to $356 a 
month. The rates on polo horse stalls will go from $250 to $275 a month and on 
open-air stalls from $240 to $260 a month. 
</P>
<P>
The increases were slightly less than Gibraltar requested in December when it 
first brought the proposal before the board. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Firm on Increases 
</P>
<P>
After complaints from horse boarders, the board told Gibraltar to come back 
with alternatives to the increases. But Gibraltar maintained Monday that raises 
are still necessary. 
</P>
<P>
To further ease the burden, the board approved an amendment to Gibraltar's 
contract that will decrease the rental payments that the operators are required 
to pay the city of Los Angeles, which owns the land. Instead of monthly 
payments that could reach $50,000 based on a percentage of the center's 
revenues, the operators will only have to pay a yearly rental fee of $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Garcia and his financial backers filed a $200-million 
lawsuit against the board, the city of Los Angeles and other Los Angeles 
officials in Glendale Superior Court. The suit accuses the city of ruining 
Garcia's plans to make the center profitable. 
</P>
<P>
The city backed out of an agreement in which he would be allowed to convert 
rental stalls into "horse condos," Garcia said. Under that plan, horse owners 
would have bought the stalls, but the city said it would be improper to sell 
park property.

The Los Angeles Department of Animal Regulation said Monday that it is 
investigating the deaths of two horses during a polo match at the Los Angeles 
Equestrian Center in Griffith Park last month. 
</P>
<P>
Robert I. Rush, department general manager, said investigators will try to 
determine whether those horses and others used for polo matches have been 
mistreated or poorly trained at the facility. He said criminal charges could be 
filed against officials at the center. 
</P>
<P>
But the center's trainers and officials called the horses' deaths "an 
unfortunate fluke" and denied any mistreatment. 
</P>
<P>
The horses, both thoroughbreds, each broke a leg during the first few minutes 
of a March 11 polo match and had to be destroyed, said Vincent Azzaro, the 
center's director of polo. 
</P>
<P>
"It's extremely rare that something like that happens," Azzaro said. "They both 
took a bad step in the first minutes. That kind of thing never happens. I mean, 
accidents happen, but unfortunately we had two in one night." 
</P>
<P>
However, Rush said he had received information about other incidents at the 
center. He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
John Alexander, a spectator at the March 11 match, wrote a letter to several 
city officials saying he had attended matches at the center's Equidome on a 
"few occasions" and "each time I have been there, a horse has been killed." 
</P>
<P>
"Arena polo is an especially cruel and deadly variation in what is already a 
dangerous and injury-plagued sport," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The letter continued: "Polo ponies are . . . trusting of their riders. They 
attempt to make incredible high-speed turns in a jumble of mallets and other 
horses' legs, which all too often leads to injury and death for the horses." 
</P>
<P>
Horse boarders at the center, who asked not to be identified, said they had 
seen polo ponies with large open sores being ridden during the matches. 
</P>
<P>
However, Azzaro insisted that polo ponies are properly trained, treated and fed 
at the center. He said the recent deaths of the polo ponies have been the only 
ones at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
"We make sure they're fit and kept in shape," he said. "I don't know what these 
people are talking about."

CHURCH SEEKS MORE ROOM; 
</P>
<P>
ZONING DISPUTE STALLS PLAN TO SELL THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
A religious group's plan to sell a landmark theater-in-the-round to an 
apartment builder was stalled Monday by a dispute over the Woodland Hills 
site's zoning. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles officials said confusion over the correct land-use designation for 
the 8.3 acres around the defunct 2,865-seat Valley Music Theater could take a 
formal city zoning change -- and as long as two years -- to settle. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley Circuit of the Jehovah's Witnesses owns the dome-shaped theater and 
uses it as a meeting hall. Church officials say they need to sell it and move 
because they have run out of parking space around the circular building. 
</P>
<P>
The developer of a neighboring apartment complex has offered to buy the 
property, but only if he can build up to 350 apartment units on the site. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dispute Over Zoning 
</P>
<P>
Church leaders contend that the longtime zoning of the theater land should 
allow such a project. City planners have disagreed, arguing that the apartment 
proposal would not fit in with a recent citywide rezoning effort that included 
the theater site. 
</P>
<P>
The confusing zoning dispute was debated during a two-hour Planning Department 
hearing before about 25 Woodland Hills residents who met in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
"The property owners are in limbo. They're stuck," hearing examiner Anne V. 
Howell said. She said she will issue a recommendation to city planning 
commissioners on how the dispute should be handled before the panel meets May 
11. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is how the theater parcel is divided with "parking," "commercial" and 
"residential" zoning designations. No construction would be allowed in a 
parking zone, and no apartment development would be allowed in a commercial 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Map Criticized 
</P>
<P>
Private land-use consultants hired by the church sought to convince Howell that 
city planners erred two years ago when they drew a new zoning map for the 
property as part of a court-ordered effort to make zoning consistent with 
actual land use in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Consultant Dwight Steinert charged that officials mistakenly thought that the 
theater property was farther west than it actually is. "They placed our 
property in the wrong location," consultant Karen Blackwell said. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners complained to Howell that the city has made a series of errors 
involving zoning and development issues in the vicinity of the defunct music 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
"There should be a moratorium on mistakes," said homeowner Sid Perry, who 
charged that the city "has rubberized drawings that stretch and bend" to 
benefit developers. 
</P>
<P>
Sierra Club representative Jill Swift suggested that an effort be made to 
salvage the old theater so it can be put to use in "the cultural renaissance" 
that has taken place since the theater stopped housing Broadway shows and other 
public events about 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be unfortunate to tear this down," Swift said. "It is not in the best 
planning process to do that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demolition Rights 
</P>
<P>
Howell said church officials already have the right to tear down the circular 
concrete building if they want to, however. 
</P>
<P>
Church elder Lloyd Harding suggested that that is not on the horizon -- at 
least as long as the church needs to use the theater for weekly meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Harding said the church only uses about 1,500 of the theater's seats because of 
the parking problem. If the church is unable to sell it and use the proceeds to 
buy a new and larger location, it will consider staying and building an 
enclosed parking garage for worshipers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Elder Jim Lacher said the parcel's selling price will depend upon the ultimate 
zoning, which will determine how many dwelling units can be built. 
</P>
<P>
Lacher said negotiations to sell the theater site are continuing with the 
next-door developer, Jay Wilton. But even though "we have a general agreement 
with him," the site has not yet been sold as Wilton reported last week, Lacher 
said.

STUDIO CITY GROUP PRESENTS 2 RADAR GUNS TO L.A. POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three Studio City children Monday presented Los Angeles police with two 
gift-wrapped radar guns, purchased with some loose change from the youngsters' 
allowances and nearly $1,600 from residents concerned about speeding motorists 
in their hillside neighborhood, organizers of the event said. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph T. Rinella said he got the idea for the gift because speeding cars made 
it unsafe for his son, Ryan, 8, to ride a bicycle on neighborhood streets. Ryan 
Rinella donated two weeks' worth of allowances -- totaling $10 -- to help pay 
for the guns, his father said. Two other children, Matthew Schofield, 8, and 
Tiffany Shields, 14, also contributed their allowances and joined Ryan Rinella 
in presenting the guns to police. 
</P>
<P>
The guns are designed for hand-held use by motorcycle officers, Rinella said. 
</P>
<P>
Rinella, chairman of the traffic and safety committee of the Studio City 
Residents' Assn., said he decided last week to ask friends and neighbors to 
help pay for the guns. Rinella said it took five hours of phone calls to raise 
the money. The donations averaged $10 to $20, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police Capt. Bruce W. Mitchell said that before the donation, the department 
had 17 radar guns for the 205 traffic officers assigned to the San Fernando 
Valley. He said one of the guns will be used to check speeds of cars near 
schools in the Studio City area and the other will be used in residential 
areas.

CHARGERS' TOP PICK TESTED POSITIVE FOR STEROIDS 
</P>

<P>
The Chargers confirmed Monday a Pittsburgh Press newspaper report that Burt 
Grossman, their first-round selection in Sunday's National Football League 
draft, tested positive for steroids at the January scouting combine workouts in 
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
The Monday report said Tom Ricketts, an offensive lineman at Pitt and former 
college roommate of Grossman, also tested positive. The paper quoted Pittsburgh 
Steelers Coach Chuck Noll as saying the Steelers were aware of Ricketts' 
positive test even before they made him the 24th player selected in the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
Noll said it was his understanding that Ricketts' steroid use was small in 
dosage and only for the purpose of healing a sprained arch. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that's exactly the story with Grossman," said Steve Ortmayer, the 
Chargers director of football operations. "It (the steroid use) was to help his 
injury heal." 
</P>
<P>
Grossman suffered through much of the 1988 season with a sprained ankle. 
According to new NFL steroid guidelines, Grossman could be subject to weekly 
steroid tests for up to two years. 
</P>
<P>
"Our guys are not worried about it," Ortmayer said. "We are not at all 
concerned." 
</P>
<P>
The testing ends as soon as the traces of steroids clear the body. 
</P>
<P>
Monday was Billy Joe Tolliver's first chance to meet the local media. And Texas 
Tech quarterback, the Chargers' second-round draft pick, lived up to his 
Texas-style name. 
</P>
<P>
He said he grew up in the tiny town of Boyd, Tex. (population 800), about 35 
miles northwest of Fort Worth. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me tell what an adjustment this is for me being in San Diego," Tolliver 
said. "I can remember when I was about 4 or 5 years old, we lived out in the 
country. We didn't have a lot of money and it didn't take much to get by. 
</P>
<P>
"One day, my dad just decided he was gonna take me and my mom down into Fort 
Worth to let her window shop. My mom didn't get to do much (in Boyd). 
</P>
<P>
"We get into Fort Worth and we go into this big ol' store, glass on the outside 
and everything, and we walk inside and my dad tells my mom, just go on and look 
at all the stuff she wants to see and we'll just stand here and wait for her. 
</P>
<P>
"So we're just sitting there in the lobby and my mom, she's just having a day 
out there. Now I look down the hall and there's these two big silver doors. I 
asked my dad, I said, 'Pop, what are those down there?' And he said, 'I don't 
know. Let's go look at it and find out.' So we walked down. 
</P>
<P>
"I can remember looking at these doors and my pop standing there checking them 
out. And all of a sudden they open up and we're just standing there amazed. And 
this lady walks up and she had to be the ugliest woman I'd ever seen in my 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"I was only 4 at the time, but she was really ugly. 
</P>
<P>
"She walked inside those doors in that little closet and then all of a sudden 
they closed up and I'm looking at it and I see numbers flashing -- 2-3-4-5-6. 
And then it stops. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking at my dad and he's looking at the numbers. Then all of a sudden it 
goes 5-4-3-2-1. And the doors open up and the best looking woman you've ever 
seen in your life stepped out of that thing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking at my dad and I said, "Pop, what is that? How'd that happen?' He 
goes: 'I don't know, boy. But you need to go get your momma. We'll run her 
through it a couple of times. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how small a town we are." 
</P>
<P>
The rest of Monday was devoted to announcements of the Chargers' late-round 
picks. They started in the seventh round by selecting Florida State's Marion 
Butts, a 6-foot-1, 248-pound fullback. According to Seminole offensive 
coordinator Wayne McDuffie, Butts is "John Dillinger in head gear." The 
Chargers were especially impressed with Butts' special teams' play. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the same round, they chose Tulane quarterback Terrence Jones. Henning 
compared Jones to Miami utility back Jim Jensen, who can line up at wide 
receiver, running back or quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers' eighth-round pick was Nebraska wide receiver Dana Brinson, who is 
only 5-9 but an excellent punt returner. In the ninth round, they opted for 
Syracuse tight end Pat Davis. In the next round, they got Ricky Andrews, an 
inside linebacker from Washington. And their last selection of the day was 
Florida State running back Victor Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers traded their 12th-round choice to Washington for the Redskins' 
12th-round selection in 1990.

MORNING BRIEFING: IF ONE GAME HAS YOU DOWN, YOU MIGHT AS WELL PLAY TWO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since he wasn't drafted until the sixth round, there must have been some 
question whether USC football-baseball star Rodney Peete could throw the long 
ball as well as he could hit it. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Alderson, vice president of baseball operations for the Oakland 
Athletics, said he thinks major league teams would still leave the light on in 
the dugout if Peete decided to play baseball. Maybe Peete could play both 
sports, Alderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Is this another Bo Jackson story? 
</P>
<P>
"Could be, but we're talking about different levels of magnitude," Alderson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Translation: Bo is better. In any event, the A's drafted Peete, but their 
rights to sign him have run out and Peete will go back into the draft pool in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
"We could consider re-drafting him," Alderson said. "We felt real strongly he'd 
be an outstanding prospect." 
</P>
<P>
Re-Peete: Peete skipped baseball at USC this spring to show the National 
Football League scouts he was serious about football. Peete, who hit .340 with 
12 home runs for the Trojans in 1988, said after the Detroit Lions had drafted 
him that he isn't thinking about baseball right now. 
</P>
<P>
No, and he probably wasn't thinking about being chosen the 141st player in the 
NFL draft, either. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia Quiz: What is green, never needs mowing and is celebrating its 25th 
birthday? 
</P>
<P>
Beat the Heat: In its first year of existence, it was easy. The Miami Heat was 
truly lukewarm. 
</P>
<P>
How bad was the Heat? Well, the team finished at 15-67 in the first season of 
the National Basketball Assn. franchise, which meant Miami fell only two 
victories shy of the Clippers' record in the franchise's 17th year, when they 
were 17-65 in 1987-88. 
</P>
<P>
Said Miami guard Rory Sparrow: "It's been very frustrating to lose like we 
have. You like to walk away with the girl every now and then. You don't just 
want to dance with her." 
</P>
<P>
So that was the problem. They thought they were supposed to be dancing. 
</P>
<P>
How does Round Mound sound? Maureen Barkley has her own pet name for her 
6-foot-6, 263-pound, Philadelphia 76ers husband, Charles. 
</P>
<P>
Love Buttercup. 
</P>
<P>
Wonder if Rick Mahorn knows that. 
</P>
<P>
Blockhead: He's at the head of the class right now, but one of Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar's records that may go first is his total of 3,189 blocked shots. 
Mark Eaton, who out-blocked Abdul-Jabbar, 315-85, this season, is only 798 
behind Abdul-Jabbar after averaging 3.84 blocks a game. 
</P>
<P>
If Eaton maintains his average, he will pass Abdul-Jabbar early in the 1991-92 
season, which is probably about the same time Kareem will have to take his 
Rolls in for service. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia Answer: AstroTurf. 
</P>
<P>
Want to play 21? Wide receiver Andre Rison of Michigan State was not real happy 
about being bypassed by 21 teams before Indianapolis drafted him with the 22nd 
pick in the first round. The voice of Rison: "I just can't wait to play against 
the teams who passed me by. I hope I get a chance to play every last one of 
them." 
</P>

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a post-crash high last week, 
confirming new highs recorded previously by the transportation average and the 
NASDAQ composite, according to Irving Katz, director of research for Thomas 
Green/San Diego Securities. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten of the 68 San Diego stocks we chart joined in the celebration and made new 
highs," Katz said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Those new highs were by Humphrey, at $6, up from $3.25 at year's-end; 
Christiana Cos., at $10.625, up from $6.35; Home Fed Corp., at $39, up from 
$24.875; BSD Bancorp, at $6.375, up from $3.875; Southwest Bancorp, $6.125, up 
from $3.875; Beeba's Creations, $10.75, up from $7.375; DH Technology, $9.625, 
up from $5.625; Medical Imaging Centers, $8.75, up from $5.25; Psicor, $10.75, 
up from $8.75, and Oak Industries, $1.375, up from $1. 
</P>
<P>
Four of those gains were the result of last week's announcement of excellent 
first-quarter earnings, Katz said. Humphrey reported earnings of $.21 versus a 
$.02 loss a year earlier. BSD Bancorp reported earnings of $.21 versus $.14 the 
year before. Home Fed reported $1.31 versus $1.07, DH Technology had earnings 
of $.25 versus $.04, and Southwest Bancorp reported $.08 versus a 10-cent loss. 
Most of Southwest's movement, however, was driven by its proposed merger with 
Security Pacific at $6 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Oak Industries' move was evidently related to the anticipated proxy fight to 
unseat five of the eight board members at its June 6 annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The largest percentage drop of the week was registered by Cousin's Home 
Furnishings, whose stock finally reflected continuing annual losses, as the 
stock dropped $.625 to close at $.875. 
</P>
<P>
Yuba Natural Resources continues to remain unchanged despite former chairman 
Richard Silberman's legal difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric rose $.625, to $37.875, as its proposed merger 
with Southern California Edison was approved by both companies' shareholders.

VALLEY EARNINGS: 4TH-QUARTER PROFIT FALLS 22% FOR NATIONAL TECHNICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
National Technical Systems in Calabasas said its fiscal fourth-quarter profit 
fell 22% from a year earlier on a 21% decline in sales. 
</P>
<P>
NTS, which provides testing and engineering services, said net income in the 
quarter that ended Jan. 31 dropped to $257,000 from $328,000, while sales fell 
to $7.23 million from $9.11 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company noted that its latest net income was hindered in part by higher 
interest costs and income taxes compared with a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
For its full fiscal year, NTS profit slipped 3%, to $1.15 million from $1.19 
million in fiscal 1988, and its sales rose 6% to $30.9 million from $29.1

VALLEY EARNINGS: FORTUNE PETROLEUM SHOWS $125,000 LOSS FOR YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fortune Petroleum Corp., a small oil and gas company based in Agoura Hills, 
said it lost $125,000 in the year that ended Dec. 31 on revenue of $798,000. 
</P>
<P>
There are no comparable year-earlier figures for the company, which was founded 
in July, 1987, although Fortune's loss for all of 1988 was less than what it 
was in the five months that it operated during 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Fortune said the price paid for its crude oil has climbed, along with oil 
prices nationwide, to more than $18.50 a barrel from $13.13 a barrel in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The company said that if oil prices remain at that level or continue rising, it 
should be profitable by the end of the year.

LUCRATIVE LULLABIES; 
</P>
<P>
DISCOVERY MUSIC WAKING UP MARKET FOR NEWBORN LISTENERS AND THEIR PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the "thirtysomething" era of aerobics videos for kids, fetal phones to talk 
to the not-yet-born and gourmet baby food, it seems inevitable that someone 
would produce music for infants. 
</P>
<P>
Fivesomething years ago, record industry veteran Ellen Wohlstadter, 35, was 
searching for music to play for her newborn son, Jason. Finding nothing she 
liked, she and her husband, David, 36, produced their own cassette with a 
variety of traditional lullabies such as "Rock-A-Bye-Baby," with ballads they 
grew up listening to written by the Beatles and other artists. Selling for 
nearly $10, primarily in baby furniture stores, the cassette was a hit. 
</P>
<P>
So with about $30,000, the couple started their own firm, called Discovery 
Music, a specialty music company that is becoming to infant music what the 
K-Tel label is to oldies and Windham Hill is to New Age music. 
</P>
<P>
From their comfortable, white-fenced home in Sherman Oaks, the Wohlstadters 
have released five cassettes of music for infants since starting their company 
in October, 1985. They include two anthologies of lullabies, one tape of songs 
with morning themes such as "O, What a Beautiful Morning," a cassette of silly 
songs and another tape of travel songs such as "Side by Side" to play in a car. 
Planned for release this year is a bathing cassette featuring "Splish Splash" 
and other songs. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery Music is still in the infant stage itself -- the Wohlstadters have 
only five employees -- but the couple closely guard their sales figures, citing 
competitive reasons. The Wohlstadters say that sales jumped 85% in 1988 and 
that they sell tapes in about 5,000 stores. Music industry executives say the 
market for music aimed at children under age 3 probably has grown from 
virtually nothing five years ago to $5 million to $10 million today. Some 
believe that Discovery may have as much as half of that market. 
</P>
<P>
As silly as it may seem to some, music for infants has become one of the 
hottest areas of children's music, which overall is a nearly 
$200-million-a-year business. Nashville music producer J. Aaron Brown, who 
sells a Grammy-nominated recording of original lullabies written by his 
in-house songwriters, said he sold 300,000 cassettes last year. Most were sold 
in gift shops, he said, which sell the tapes for $12.95. 
</P>
<P>
The business is starting to attract big-name companies, posing a threat to tiny 
Discovery. Walt Disney Records in Burbank earlier this year released "Disney's 
Lullaby Favorites," which includes a folk version of "When You Wish Upon a 
Star" sung by rocker Stephen Bishop, whose hits include "On and On" and "It 
Might Be You." 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Wohlstadter said she is nervous that large companies such as Disney are 
entering the market. "People say competition is good, but they have a lot of 
money behind them. They can do a lot of advertising and other things we can't 
do at this point," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Other major record labels are also considering whether to produce lullaby 
tapes. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's a very fertile market," said Mark Jaffe, director of childrens 
marketing for A &amp; M Records. Jaffe said A &amp; M has yet to release a 
lullaby tape, mainly because it is searching for a singer the label believes 
can be marketed well. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the lullaby cassettes' success comes because the tapes aren't sold so 
much for infants, who most likely are indifferent to the music they hear, as 
they are marketed to parents in their late 20s and 30s to listen to while 
trying to soothe crying babies or put them to bed. 
</P>
<P>
That explains why one Discovery lullaby tape includes a cover version of Elvis 
Presley's 1950s hit "Love Me Tender" on the same cassette with the traditional 
"German Lullaby." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nightly Music 
</P>
<P>
Still, some parents believe that their babies enjoy the music. Rosine 
Hermodson-Olsen, a mother in Frederick, S.D., said she is a strong believer in 
playing music for infants and went so far as to play music for her 7-month-old 
son, Joseph, while he was still in the womb. She said she plays Discovery tapes 
for him almost every night. 
</P>
<P>
"I play it if he's a little antsy or if his teeth hurt. I think it relaxes 
him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Pediatricians interviewed said they see no harm in playing music for infants, 
adding that it is unlikely that children will develop Pavlov-type conditioning 
in which they must hear music to fall asleep. Pediatricians said their main 
concern is that some parents might be tempted to use music too often as a 
convenient baby-sitter, depriving the child of important human contact. 
</P>
<P>
"Music is all right, but it doesn't replace people," said Dr. T. Berry 
Brazelton, a clinical professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and one 
of the nation's leading child-care experts. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the Discovery sales pitch is that music helps babies, although limited 
research has been done. One Discovery package says, "Research has proven 
parents who lullaby their babies promote bonding, infant development and 
speech." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Question of Research 
</P>
<P>
But Dr. Esther Wender, a pediatrician at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center 
who heads the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on early childhood, said 
she is unaware of any such research on the effect of lullabies. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of anybody who has studied it," said Wender, who added that she 
doesn't believe that listening to music would hurt a baby. 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Wohlstadter said she informally gathered research on the subject. One 
Swedish study she said she found concluded that it was important to sing to a 
baby, even if it is off-key. A news article, she said, told of a Japanese study 
that showed that babies were soothed more by lullabies than rock 'n' roll. 
Despite the statements on the packages, she said, Discovery does not emphasize 
psychological benefits of the music in selling it. "We promote it more as 
entertainment," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery is based in the downstairs part of the couple's spacious home in the 
foothills. One room is an office, where orders are taken, publicity is planned 
and accounting work is done. The Wohlstadters, who share the title of 
president, also share an office in what used to be their bedroom, which has the 
guts of a new $40,000 computer in the closet. Discovery's shipping department 
is in a guest house in the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TV Sports Producer 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Wohlstadter formerly worked in production and distribution for RSO 
Records, the New York record label owned by Australian Robert Stigwood that 
scored one of the industry's biggest hits in the late 1970s with the "Saturday 
Night Fever" movie sound track. David Wohlstadter is a television sports 
producer who does free-lance work on weekends for the ESPN sports channel. 
</P>
<P>
To produce a cassette, the Wohlstadters select a theme, such as travel or 
lullabies, and listen to hundreds of songs. A royalty of 5.25% is paid to the 
songs' owners. They also make frequent use of traditional songs in the public 
domain, which don't require royalties. 
</P>
<P>
Once songs are selected, singer Joanie Bartels, who was selected from a group 
of singers who auditioned for the job, records the songs, with cassettes 
duplicated at a plant owned by Warner Communications. Instrumental versions are 
usually recorded on the flip side of each cassette, with lyrics enclosed so 
parents can sing their own version of the songs. 
</P>
<P>
Selecting songs can be a sensitive job. One parent wrote to criticize the use 
of the traditional "Rock-A-Bye-Baby" because, the parent said, the song is 
excessively violent. The reason was that the song contains the lines: "When the 
bough breaks, the cradle will fall, and down will come baby, cradle and all." 
</P>
<P>
Another angry parent called Discovery at 9 p.m. a few weeks ago to complain 
about a 1986 tape that used a version of the Cat Stevens hit "Morning Has 
Broken." The call came after the former pop singer, who has changed his name to 
Yusuf Islam and become a strict Muslim, endorsed the Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini's death threat against Salman Rushdie, author of "The Satanic Verses." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rejecting Tunes 
</P>
<P>
A large number of songs ultimately are rejected. For Discovery's latest tape on 
silly songs, a popular children's song called "Animal Fair" was nixed after it 
was recorded. The Wohlstadters were reluctant to issue the song because it 
refers to a monkey who gets drunk, sits on an elephant's trunk and ends up 
flattened. But, they said, most songs are rejected because they have some kind 
of romantic lyrics that parents might find objectionable. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for Discovery's growth isn't so much the music as the 
Wohlstadters' decision to initially sell the cassettes through distributors to 
children's furniture stores and later to toy stores, children's book stores, 
children's clothing stores and department stores. The cassettes are usually 
hung on a stand that is placed on a store's front counter. 
</P>
<P>
Had they tried to sell the tapes to record stores, they said, the cassettes 
most likely would have been lost among popular adult albums more actively 
pushed by the record stores. Baby furniture stores made more sense. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New-Mother Market 
</P>
<P>
"That's where the mother goes when she is pregnant. The new mother is the 
market we wanted to get, and the new mother does not go into record stores," 
Ellen Wohlstadter said. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery Music is starting to feel growing pains. The Wohlstadters expect to 
have to move to proper offices next year. In addition, an $80,000 advertising 
campaign, their first, is being launched in magazines for new parents. And they 
are considering whether to expand into such areas as compact discs and 
videocassettes. 
</P>
<P>
Still, she and others in the business believe that baby tapes won't be a 
thirtysomething-type fad. 
</P>
<P>
"People used to sing a lot to their children. People don't have the time today 
and often don't know the lyrics. You can say it's a fad, but if it was, people 
wouldn't be buying it as much as they are," she said.

</P>
<P>
The Sherman Oaks company, which sells blood products and provides blood 
banking, said its revenue rose 19% to $1.3 million. The company's earnings rose 
mainly because of a big jump in providing hemapheresis, or blood treatment 
services, in the Los Angeles area.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: HOH'S TRADING SYMBOL REVISED OVER FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOH Water Technology in Newbury Park said its stock trading symbol was changed 
by the National Assn. of Securities Dealers to indicate that HOH fails to meet 
the NASD's minimum capital requirements. 
</P>
<P>
HOH's securities trade on the over-the-counter market, which is governed by the 
NASD. 
</P>
<P>
But HOH, which is developing a water-filtration system for the housing and 
industrial markets, said it will again meet the NASD's conditions because the 
Economic Development Bank for Puerto Rico recently approved a $2-million 
financing plan for it. The company's main factory is planned to open in Puerto 
Rico. 
</P>
<P>
The change resulted in the NASD adding a "C" to HOH's trading symbols. Its 
common stock's symbol is HOHIC. HOH's units, which consist of common shares and 
warrants, have the new symbol HOHUC, and the warrants alone are HOHWC. 
</P>
<P>
The "C" indicates that the NASD believes that the company's capital might soon 
be increased to the NASD's minimum requirements and that the NASD has granted 
HOH an exemption from its typical practice of dropping an under-capitalized 
stock from its listings.

DINNER OF CENTURY AT L'HERMITAGE; 
</P>
<P>
PRE-REVOLUTIONARY TEASER FOR JULY 16 BENEFIT PICNIC, FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The evening began with the French way of greeting, hellos followed by a flurry 
of kisses on both sides of the cheeks. The French also have their way of 
putting on a dinner party, which was really what Sunday night's festivities 
were all about. 
</P>
<P>
The dinner laid to rest the theory that too many cooks spoil the consomme. 
Michel Richard of Citrus, Jean-Claude Bourlier of Le Dome, Patrick Healy from 
Champagne, Claude Alrivy from Le Chardonnay and Michel Blanchet from L'Ermitage 
toiled together in Blanchet's kitchen preparing a five-course meal -- the 
caloric count of which, one guest pointed out, was "off the wall." 
</P>
<P>
As the evening's hostess, Dora Fourcade, the glamorous 30-year-old 
Tahitian-French owner of L'Ermitage restaurant put it, "the French love to have 
fun and they love to throw an elegant fete and any excuse is good." 
</P>
<P>
Her excuse is good: The upcoming bicentennial of the French Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Richard's Brainchild 
</P>
<P>
It was actually the brainchild of Citrus' Richard to gather some of Los 
Angeles' top French chefs to create a sort of three-star picnic and fair on 
July 16. (The fair will be held at Hollywood Park and is open to the public.) 
So the July 16th Committee was born, chaired by Fourcade and including on the 
committee Patrick Terrail of Ma Maison, Madeleine Don Salat of Le Cellier, 
Pierre and Esther Pelech of Pierre's Los Feliz Inn and Robert Robaire of 
Robaire's. The restaurateurs agreed that any proceeds of the July 16 
celebrations would go to the Pro Musicis Foundation, supporting young musicians 
in France and the United States, and another yet-to-be-determined children's 
charity. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday night's "Diner Grand Siecle" at L'Ermitage was the pre-revolutionary 
teaser, as it were, setting the mood in all its extravagance for what will 
follow. Taittinger Champagne flowed like, well, water from a garden hose before 
a drought. Strains of lute music filled the air. Decorator Claude Lecourt piled 
the restaurant with antiques -- paintings, vases and the most precious pieces, 
a pair of 18th-Century girandoles, which he admitted were not exactly French. 
"They are Hungarian," Lecourt said, "but they are period." 
</P>
<P>
Guests were also encouraged to dress in period, which a few actually attempted. 
Artist Andre Miripolsky in a Napoleonic blue velvet frock coat (and psychedelic 
painted shoes) noted that the "major advantage of living in the 18th Century 
was wig wearing." He allowed that his own hair, beneath the dense brown 
ponytail, was "sparse." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Candidate for Guillotine 
</P>
<P>
Wearing an elaborate court dress, Marceline A. de la Poterie, president of the 
Club Culturel Francais, volunteered that she felt very much at home. "I come 
from a very distinguished French family. We were landowners, and I'm sure in 
another life I was at the court. I'm not kidding," she said intently. "But on 
the 14th of July (Bastille Day) I will be guillotinee," she added giggling. 
</P>
<P>
Fourcade admitted that the wardrobe she found at Western Costume for herself 
and the restaurant's entire staff was a bit of a geographical stretch: 
"Everyone is in costumes from 'Amadeus,' " she shrugged, as she and her skirt 
swished through the room. 
</P>
<P>
The meal was also period, or as period as possible, starting with appetizers of 
crepes filled with celery root and caviar ("they used to eat a lot of root 
veggies," Richard said), followed by consomme, duck pate, salmon, venison and a 
trio of desserts. "When you look at those old cookbooks, they used to eat 14 
courses -- it was endless," noted Francine Bardo, general manager of the Hermes 
shop on Rodeo Drive. "This is meant to be a representation. They couldn't put 
us through that." 
</P>
<P>
Richard denied that there was a clash of egos -- or recipes -- in the kitchen, 
and just to make sure, he insisted that the menu (replete with spelling errors) 
listed courses without the names of the corresponding chefs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Kick-off Dinner 
</P>
<P>
Yet another kick-off dinner will be held June 3, headed by Jennifer Grant, who 
was at the party wearing a non-revolutionary gown by Christian Dior. The 
daughter of the late Cary Grant will set sail for Paris this fall to study 
French cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining why he was "gung-ho" on the upcoming salute to the revolution, 
honorary co-chair actor John Forsythe, who as vice president of Hollywood Park 
arranged for the race track's cooperation, said: "We are recognizing one of the 
great human events of our time. The French gave us Marquis de Lafayette, 
Brigitte Bardot, crepes suzette, Monet, Manet, Degas, Debussy -- why shouldn't 
we recognize them?" 
</P>
<P>
Celebrations on July 16 will include a re-created French street, regional 
foods, jugglers, fire-eaters and musicians, the special $100,000 Bastille 
Stakes horse race and a French village ball in the evening. Admission will be 
$7 at the gate, children under 12 free, or $5 if purchased in advance at 
participating French restaurants.

ART BUCHWALD: RISKY BUSINESS WITH AN ARMS DEALER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Buchwald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I live in a beautiful, but not very forgiving, neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
When Adnan Khashoggi was arrested and detained in Switzerland for extradition 
to the United States, the residents of Wesley Heights were in an uproar. The 
reason for this is that, just up the street from us, at American University, 
there is a large building named the Adnan Khashoggi Sports and Convocation 
Center. It was donated by the zillionaire arms dealer who is wanted by the U.S. 
for racketeering, fraud and obstruction of justice, and the people in my area 
are afraid that real estate values will fall if his name stays on this 
building. 
</P>
<P>
Feelings are so strong that, as I was coming home the other night, I saw Jim 
Lawson backing his bulldozer out of the garage. 
</P>
<P>
"Where are you going?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm driving up to American U. to knock down that Khashoggi monument before 
Wesley Heights becomes the laughingstock of the Western world," Lawson told me. 
</P>
<P>
"You're jumping to conclusions. It's true that the man has been arrested, but 
people don't knock down a brand-new building just because the person who paid 
for it is accused of a crime. If we destroyed every edifice donated to a 
university by a white-collar criminal, the college campuses of America would 
look like the Arctic Circle. American U. accepted Khashoggi's money in good 
faith, and you can't expect the school to turn its back on him just because he 
has allegedly been playing 'spin the bottle' with Mr. and Mrs. Ferdinand 
Marcos." 
</P>
<P>
"Even though the guy was in on every arms deal in the world?" Lawson yelled. 
"How does a school know where to draw the line when it comes to deciding which 
money is clean and which is dirty?" 
</P>
<P>
"The line is so fine that only presidents of universities can see it. Their 
problem is not the fact that they accept the money, it's having to explain to 
faculty and students why they put the scoundrel's name on the building." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I am going to pulverize the Khashoggi Center anyway. If he turns out to 
be innocent, I'll apologize to him. Why would American U. take money from a 
notorious arms dealer in the first place?" 
</P>
<P>
"The kids had to have a place to play basketball. Long after Khashoggi does 
time, and I'm not saying he will, the cheers of students will be resounding 
from the rafters of the AU Sports Center. We should not concern ourselves with 
Khashoggi's guilt or innocence, but rather be happy about the Olympic-sized 
pool he left behind." 
</P>
<P>
"Can we at least tape over his name on the building while the jury is still 
out?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, it would suggest that AU is making a judgment on the case, which the 
university never does to one of its white-collar givers." 
</P>
<P>
"Until Khashoggi is judged by 12 of his peers, is there any action we can 
take?" 
</P>
<P>
"We must strike while he's reeling, and ask him to provide the funds for 
another building on campus to match the first one. People in trouble with the 
law are always anxious to perform good deeds to make amends for their bad ones. 
I know of one white-collar criminal who beat a million-dollar embezzlement rap 
because the sentencing judge found out that the man had given his Jaguar to a 
women's volleyball team." 
</P>
<P>
"If you won't let me bulldoze the building, will you allow me to rename it the 
Michael Milken School of Business?" Lawson pleaded. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too risky. The way things are right now, today's financial heroes could 
easily wind up as tomorrow's license-plate makers."

GAPS IN TALE OF HUMAN BEGINNINGS

<TEXT>
<P>
In the Age of Mankind: A Smithsonian Book of Human Evolution by Roger Lewin 
(Smithsonian Institution Press; $37.50; 256 pages; illustrated) 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to say that human beings evolved from lower animals and very hard to 
say exactly how it happened. As in most areas of knowledge, the closer you look 
at the details, the fuzzier they get. 
</P>
<P>
At every stage in the story of human evolution there are puzzles and scholarly 
debates. The evidence -- some of it very sketchy -- can be read in many 
different ways, and each way has its adherents. Very little is settled. 
</P>
<P>
"Archeology is a detective story in which all the principal characters are 
absent and only a few broken fragments of their possessions remain," says 
Richard Leakey, one of the foremost practitioners in the field. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Lewin, a science writer and biochemist with a special interest in 
evolution, explores the questions, the controversies and the evidence 
surrounding the origins of the human race in "In the Age of Mankind," a 
lavishly illustrated survey of current knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Origin of Language 
</P>
<P>
He masterfully traces the coming of human beings biologically and culturally, 
paying as much attention to the origin of language and of cities as to the 
descent from the trees. Though the book is somewhat dryly written, the content 
of the prose makes up for what it lacks in style. 
</P>
<P>
The amazing part of the story is how much of it remains a mystery; 130 years 
after Charles Darwin published his "Origin of Species," it is still not clear 
at what point our ancestors stopped being apelike and started being humanlike. 
It is not even clear what the criteria are for making that judgment. What is 
clear, Lewin says, is that humans are different in degree but not in kind from 
the animals that preceded us. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, human behavior was ascribed to our hominid ancestors at a 
fairly early stage in their development. The tide of expert opinion on this 
subject has now shifted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Primitive Versions 
</P>
<P>
"Our ancestors now appear to be more like apes than like primitive versions of 
ourselves," Lewin writes. 
</P>
<P>
Stone tools began to be used about 2.5 million years ago, but it was not until 
Homo erectus came along nearly a million years later that something different 
happened. He "was the first to use his environment as a modern hunter-gatherer 
does, and the first whose anatomy speaks of a humanlike social structure," 
Lewin says. "For the first time, the Age of Mankind seemed at hand. Before 
then, however, the menagerie of hominid species inhabiting various parts of 
Africa lived the lives of intelligent, large-bodied, terrestrial primates, some 
of whom made and used stone tools." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crossed the Bridge 
</P>
<P>
Still, modern humans did not arise until somewhere between 200,000 and 150,000 
years ago, and they did not leave Africa until between 100,000 and 35,000 years 
ago. When they crossed the then-existent land bridge between Asia and North 
America remains unknown. 
</P>
<P>
When did they begin to speak? When did they develop consciousness? When did the 
hunter-gatherers settle down and turn to agriculture? No one knows. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is it clear, as long thought, that language was developed for the purpose 
of hunting. It now appears that the spur to communication was the need for 
social organization. This helps to explain why humans have to be so much 
cleverer than animals, who, after all, manage to make a living in their 
environments with much less brain power. 
</P>
<P>
"While primates' subsistence environment may be no more complex than that of 
other mammals, their social environment is much more demanding," Lewin writes. 
"More and more, language is coming to be seen as a tool of consciousness: a way 
of thinking better, a way of more effectively reconstructing a picture of our 
social world in our heads." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Organized Cities 
</P>
<P>
Finally, social organization led to cities, which began in Mesopotamia only 
6,000 years ago. Civilization and modern society began in the city of Uruk 
between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. 
</P>
<P>
"At Uruk, to a degree unimagined in earlier phases of human history, there 
emerged the need for control of uncertainty; control not only over the physical 
elements of nature but over fellow human beings," Lewin says. "Once you had 
Uruk, New York was probably inevitable: The true city, once formed, generates a 
whole new array of social and technological selection pressures that set a new 
trajectory in human history." 
</P>
<P>
But how all this happened is a matter of great controversy. There is no 
clear-cut distinction between causes and effects. Different stories can be put 
together from the same sketchy facts. 
</P>
<P>
Lewin's book is an up-to-the-minute presentation of those stories that 
underscores what is known, what is unknown and what is guessed at. We still 
have a long way to go before we can answer humanity's age-old question: Where 
did we come from and how did we get here?

EXERCISE PREVENTS BONE LOSS -- IF ESTROGEN REMAINS NORMAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I am confused about the value of exercise in preventing bone loss for 
women in their 20s and 30s. I must have read a thousand times that exercise can 
help prevent bone loss. But I met a young woman who is in her late 20s who is a 
marathoner, and she says that she's been told by her doctor that her bones are 
getting thinner, and that she should consider cutting back on the amount of 
running she does. How can exercise be both good and bad in relation to bone 
loss? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: In general, exercise is beneficial in helping prevent osteoporosis 
(bone loss). However, young women who engage in very strenuous exercise 
sometimes stop having their menstrual periods, and their estrogen levels are 
low. These women may have a low bone density, which is probably associated with 
their lower estrogen levels. Nevertheless, they generally have a higher bone 
density than women who don't exercise and who don't have their periods.

'Konitz: Portrait of the Artist as a Saxophonist' 
</P>
<P>
Canada, 1988, 83 minutes 
</P>
<P>
6:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The music, by "cool" school alto saxophonist Lee Konitz -- a member of Lennie 
Tristano's group and a major presence on the Miles Davis-Gil Evans 1950 
trail-blazer, "Birth of the Cool" -- is fine, and so is Konitz's company; he is 
a self-effacing guy with an occasional dry wit and an air of sweet, pleasant 
gravity. (His accompanist, pianist Harold Danko is a dark, intense fireball.) 
But Robert Daudelin's documentary is visually flat, cinematically bland; its 
only strategy is to ease us into the jazz and the anecdotes, which, thankfully, 
are sometimes enough. MICHAEL WILMINGTON

Some 18,000 British Broadcasting Corp. workers went on strike Monday for higher 
pay, leaving viewers to watch the "Flintstones" cartoon characters, a film 
about Evel Knievel and other fill-in morning programs, while radio listeners 
were greeted with silence. The 24-hour walkout, which began at midnight, forced 
nearly all live programs on the corporation's two television channels and four 
national radio networks to be canceled or shortened. Journalists joined 
technicians on picket lines in London and demonstrations were planned for 
Glasgow, Belfast, Manchester, Birmingham and other major cities. Striking 
workers are demanding a 16% pay increase that would bring salaries in line with 
those in commercial broadcasting. The BBC, which employs about 25,000 people, 
has offered an average 7% increase. ALEENE MacMINN

<P>
South Africa/Australia/Great Britain, 1988, 106 minutes 
</P>
<P>
6:40 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
A taught, affecting drama about a man caught between two cultures, both of 
which reject him: Panic (Thomas Mogotlane), a black petty con man, is dismissed 
by the men and women involved in the anti-apartheid struggle as a traitor and 
thug; the brutal police officers who want to use him as an informer despise 
him. Director and co-writer Oliver Schmitz makes the cruel, amoral Panic seem 
comprehensible, if not sympathetic, by exposing the social conditions that 
produced him. "Mapantsula" ("thief" in Zulu) has been banned in South Africa.

</P>
<P>
 Based on an appalling real-life episode -- the brutal mistreatment of 40 
illegal Dominican emigrants to the United States on the ship that was 
transporting them -- director Agilberto Melendez's film slowly builds up an 
atmosphere of grim, low-key realism. Melendez doesn't go for knockout blows; 
his film seems initially ordinary as he mounts his case, sketching in several 
dozen participants, showing us the grimy mechanics of corruption and 
destruction. Where life is cheap and only money talks, the film quietly states, 
lives are not only cheapened, but expendable.

POP CAPSULES : BOHEMIAN GROOVE FROM WASHINGTON SQUARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Holy anachronisms, Batman! Phrases like "the upper class oppressing the lower 
classes" and "with Bush in the White House, we need all the beats we can get" 
(preceding a folk eulogy for Neal Cassady) actually came up over the course of 
the Washington Squares' first set Saturday at the Palace Court, no sniggers 
attached. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Squares first showed on the NYC acoustic circuit a few years back, 
folk truebloods have debated whether these two guys and a gal are serious about 
their new bohemianism, and if so, whether maybe they shouldn't be. How, it's 
asked, can the same amplified-acoustic trio that sings a way-cool pop version 
of Leonard Cohen's riotously cynical "Everybody Knows" also croon apparently 
guileless original lyrics like "Love and understanding covered with dust / It's 
time for direction, caring and trust / Be on the lookout for a new generation"? 
</P>
<P>
But while '80s fatalism and '60s idealism may be strange bedfellows to 
consummate in the Squares' bedframe of reference, should their ingenuous 
light-shining seem any harder to swallow than "Talkin' 'Bout a Revolution"? 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the folk-raucous Squares -- and a loud drummer -- stretched the 
jazz-oriented Palace Court's sound system well beyond its apparent capacity. 
Which somehow added to the charm. They have a major Peter, Paul &amp; Mary 
complex, and harmonies to make it work, but imagine PP&amp;M cranked up to 11, 
rocking out on "Greenback Dollar" with an extended guitar solo. Dig. CHRIS

POP CAPSULES : SIMPLY RED CONCERT CAN'T DO HUCKNALL VOICE JUSTICE 
</P>

Simply Red's Mick Hucknall was buried Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
The English singer has a fairly delicate, soulful tenor that's elegantly 
showcased on the band's albums, particularly on songs like the Harold Melvin 
oldie "If You Don't Know Me by Now" and Simply Red's biggest hit, the ballad 
"Holding Back the Years." 
</P>
<P>
But if you went to the Roxy to savor the subtleties of Hucknall's voice, you 
were out of luck. The six instrumentalists of the English white-soul band, 
concluding a sold-out, four-night run, simply overwhelmed lead singer Hucknall. 
The musicians were so intent on showing off their slick, James Brown-influenced 
soul-revue style that Hucknall's vocals often were lost in their clamorous 
funk. In concert, Hucknall needs softer, less flashy accompaniment. He had to 
push his voice beyond its limits Sunday, forcing himself to shriek -- which he 
doesn't do well. DENNIS HUNT

'ROAD RAIDERS': DERIVATIVE LOOK AT WAR AS FUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Never mind this "MASH" and "Tour of Duty" and "China Beach" malarkey. Remember 
when war was fun? 
</P>
<P>
No? Well, the two-hour made-for-TV movie/series pilot "The Road Raiders," a 
World War II action-comedy (tonight at 8 on Channels 2 and 8), will do its 
horn-tootinest best to remind you of the days when men were men, gals were 
compliant and the Japanese were to be greeted with lead, not real-estate bills 
of sale. Forget all that war-is-hell revisionism. "Road Raiders" brings back 
the happy-go-lucky fantasy days of yore when war was all about raising hell. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it seems like a creaky artifact from 15 or 20 years ago, back when 
Hollywood was busily churning out nostalgic product about the "good" wars to 
take our minds off the not-so-great one. The only updated element marking "Road 
Raiders" as distinctly a product of the 1980s is the strangely familiar modern 
costume worn by hero Bruce Boxleitner -- a white jacket over a white T-shirt, 
along with a 6 o'clock shadow. Well, it was shot in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Florida is doubling here for the Philippines, where Boxleitner -- as Capt. 
Rhodes, an irreverent ex-officer on the run after being unjustly accused of 
being a traitor -- is trying to cajole his way out of that no-man's-land during 
the Japanese invasion. Impersonating the recently deceased officer who was 
trying to haul him in, he accidentally finds himself in command of a ragtag 
bunch of military "oddballs, castoffs and misfits" -- who will, inevitably, end 
up effectively saving the allied forces. 
</P>
<P>
The chief perpetrator here is executive producer Glen A. Larson, who also came 
up with the derivative story, co-wrote the derivative teleplay and even 
co-wrote the derivative theme music, which sounds like a bad dream John 
Williams would try to shake off. Richard Lang directed in the most perfunctory 
fashion. Our suggestion: A fall season in the brig for the whole lot of them.

PROPOSED $1.8-BILLION SELLOFF WOULD SHRINK EASTERN A THIRD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Eastern Airlines, bankrupt and strikebound, proposed Monday to shrink itself by 
more than one-third in a drastic selloff of assets that it declared would lead 
it out of bankruptcy by Sept. 1 and back to profitability next year. 
</P>
<P>
Unveiling its financial plan to creditors, the airline called for big cutbacks 
in its fleet, employment and the roster of cities it serves. Eastern proposed 
to sell off $1.8 billion in assets, about one-third of the total, and to repay 
more than one-third of its debt. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate response from creditors. But proposals to buy Eastern 
continued to surface, prompting bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland to postpone 
until May 3 a hearing on a suit seeking to force an auction of the airline. 
</P>
<P>
David I. Shapiro, a court-appointed examiner, asked for the delay because there 
are as many as five "credible" potential bidders for Eastern. They include 
Chicago hotelier Jay Pritzker, TWA chairman Carl C. Icahn and three others whom 
Shapiro would not identify. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern has been virtually grounded since a strike March 4 by the airline's 
machinists, pilots and flight attendants unions. It sought the protection of 
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code five days later. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern spelled out its proposed cutbacks to the 15-member creditors committee 
in a meeting at the swank Plaza Hotel with Phil Bakes, president of the 
airline; Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern and its parent, Texas Air Corp., 
and other Eastern executives. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, none of the creditors would comment about the proposal, citing a 
letter of confidentiality each had to sign before entering the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the reception of the plan, Bakes said: "They did not throw us out 
and they did not applaud afterwards. My sense is that they were pleased with 
the direction (of the plan) and were quite interested." 
</P>
<P>
But Louis Marckesano, an airline analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott in 
Philadelphia, expressed skepticism about Eastern's plan: "I'd be leery of it if 
I were a creditor. . . . It's very difficult in the airline business to shrink 
to profitability." 
</P>
<P>
Highlights of the Eastern plan: 
</P>
<P>
* A reduction of its fleet to 157 aircraft versus a pre-strike total of 255. 
Bakes said deals have already been struck to sell 98 of the planes. 
</P>
<P>
* A cutback in the number of cities Eastern serves to 77 from the pre-strike 
102. The Atlanta hub would be expanded. Overall, Eastern would keep 164 of its 
281 domestic gates and sell or lease the rest. 
</P>
<P>
* A reduction of the work force to 17,000 people compared to 30,000 before the 
strike began. There would be 1,700 pilots, down from 3,600. 
</P>
<P>
* Repayment of $914 million of the airline's $2.4 billion in debt, which Bakes 
said will "drastically reduce future interest expenses and depreciation and 
make the company significantly stronger financially and operationally." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No 'Switch to Click' 
</P>
<P>
Bakes said the airline would pay off its creditors and emerge from bankruptcy 
no later than Sept. 1. He said he hoped that the airline would complete its 
reorganization plan with its creditors within a few weeks and be a profitable 
airline sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
"It is no longer a realistic option for Eastern -- wish that it were but it is 
not -- for us to click a switch and have Eastern grow back to its pre-strike 
size," Bakes told reporters. Bakes declined to identify the cities where 
service would be cut, nor would he reveal what assets would be sold. 
</P>
<P>
He did say American Airlines, which has publicly stated its interest in 
Eastern's lucrative Latin American routes, is not the only potential buyer for 
the routes. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern's financial plan must be approved by the creditors and by Judge 
Lifland. 
</P>
<P>
Any plan to return Eastern to the air hinges on attracting and training pilots, 
a task the airline suggested won't be too difficult but that the striking 
pilots maintain is all but impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan would welcome many of our striking employees to come back to work," 
Bakes said. "But is is not dependent on any of them to come back to work. The 
5,000 people who are working (for Eastern) today will be the core that will 
rebuild the airline." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Shortage of Pilots 
</P>
<P>
Joe Leonard, a vice president of Eastern, said the airline was not having any 
trouble attracting pilots to take the place of the pilots who have refused to 
cross the picket lines of striking machinists. He said there had been 2,100 
applications, of which 1,300 meet Eastern's requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"The notion that there is a shortage of pilots is like saying there is a 
shortage of ice in Alaska," Bakes said. 
</P>
<P>
But Ron Cole, a spokesman for the pilots union, accused Eastern of waging "a 
media blitz to try to coerce and intimidate pilots back off the picket line. . 
. . I think the creditors committee and the court will see through it as being 
smoke and mirrors." 
</P>
<P>
Cole said there is "nothing new or unexpected" in the airline's plan, and that 
Eastern's effort to get pilots back into the cockpit is "something we don't 
believe he can accomplish in timely enough fashion to satisfy the creditors and 
the bankruptcy court." 
</P>
<P>
A machinists union source characterized Eastern's plan as "a partial 
liquidation to lull the creditors to sleep. It basically is a Continental 
protection plan," he said, referring to Texas Air's non-union airline.

HOFFMANN-LA ROCHE MAPS SEVERAL CHANGES

Swiss drug manufacturing giant F. Hoffmann-La Roche &amp; Co. said Monday that 
it will modernize its share structure and reorganize its corporate framework. 
</P>
<P>
The changes would make it easier to invest in the company and conform to 
pending changes in Swiss corporate law. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffmann-La Roche failed in a takeover bid for Sterling Drug Inc. last year, 
and the streamlining could help the company in other U.S. takeover attempts, 
some analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The company's U.S. operations, which accounted for $1.9 billion in revenue out 
of the parent's $6 billion, are based in Nutley, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
One school of thought holds that a global consolidation in the pharmaceutical 
business is inevitable. SmithKline Beckman Corp. of Philadelphia and Beecham 
Group PLC of London have merger plans, and Monsanto Co. of St. Louis bought G. 
D. Searle in 1985. Eastman Kodak Co. took steps in January, 1988, to thwart 
Hoffmann-La Roche's designs on Sterling. 
</P>
<P>
The move would make it easier to exchange stock for shares in another company 
Hoffmann may seek to acquire, said Louis C. Webb, an analyst at Advest Group 
Inc. in Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Attractive' 
</P>
<P>
"Drug makers are very attractive for acquisition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The changes also could help pave the way for Hoffmann-La Roche to list its 
stock on U.S. exchanges, said Michael Martorelli, an analyst at Janney 
Montgomery Scott Inc. of Philadelphia. It trades only in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
"Does it make it easier to list? Probably," he said. "Will they list? That's a 
different story." 
</P>
<P>
Hoffmann-La Roche's chairman, Fritz Gerber, declined Monday to comment on 
whether the changes would ease the way for a takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
The new structure, to be proposed at the company's annual meeting May 31 in 
Basel, Switzerland, would eliminate the automatic dual ownership of stock in 
both Swiss-based Roche Group and Sapac Corp. Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 50-year-old arrangement, Sapac, incorporated in New Brunswick, 
Canada, was the holding company for subsidiaries in North and South America, 
Asia, Australia, the United Kingdom and part of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Sapac would become a subsidiary of Roche Group, in which shareholders 
would own stock. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the company would form Roche Holding Ltd., to become a parent of F. 
Hoffmann-La Roche, which would assume control of operations and liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
The holding company arrangement "makes the corporation more transparent to the 
outside world," the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Hoffmann-La Roche said it would reorganize its shares to enlarge the 
stock base.

The U.S. government is gearing up to prevent Japan from dominating yet another 
segment of the high-technology industry, the small but strategic field of 
supercomputers. 
</P>
<P>
Supercomputers are used for the most complex computing jobs such as determining 
air flow over an airplane wing, designing new weapons systems, cracking 
military codes or mapping the human body's genes. 
</P>
<P>
Priced at $20 million apiece, the machines' processing speed is so great it is 
measured in billions of computing operations per second. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials are talking of increased funding, congressional hearings, 
interagency studies and a possible industry consortium to prevent major U.S. 
research and development work from depending on foreign models. 
</P>
<P>
But scientists who do that research are less concerned about Japanese dominance 
of the field than by the possibility that the United States may keep them from 
buying the best machines available. 
</P>
<P>
"The real economic impact of supercomputers is not on the industry that makes 
them, it's the industries that use them -- aerospace, automobiles, oil," said 
Sydney Karin, director of the San Diego Supercomputing Center. "We must be 
careful about any efforts to restrict the optimal supercomputers for these 
users." 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials are more circumspect. High-performance computing is obviously 
critical to science and engineering, which must not depend on outmoded 
technology, said William Wulf, assistant director of computing and information 
sciences for the National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
But Wulf added: "We must be careful to balance the need for cost-effective 
computing and having a vigorous indigenous supercomputer industry." 
</P>
<P>
The nation's supercomputer makers have attracted attention after two disturbing 
announcements for the U.S. industry this month: NEC Corp. of Japan now claims 
to have the world's fastest computer, while Control Data Corp. said it would 
shut down its supercomputer business, leaving only Cray Research Inc. in the 
domestic field. 
</P>
<P>
NEC's news had been expected for some time, but Control Data's pullout -- part 
of a $490-million restructuring to revive sluggish earnings -- surprised 
government and industry alike. 
</P>
<P>
The House Science, Space and Technology Committee was "shocked" by Control 
Data's decision to close ETA Systems Inc., said Executive Director Harold 
Hansen. 
</P>
<P>
"ETA assured us just a month ago that this wouldn't happen," said Hansen, who 
has called for congressional hearings to solve what he called a serious threat 
to the economy's long-term health. 
</P>
<P>
The supercomputer market is miniscule, compared to Japanese strongholds such as 
memory chips, television sets or video cassette recorders. Only 410 
supercomputers are installed worldwide, and sales were about $1.8 billion last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
But industry experts view supercomputers as one of high technology's most 
critical segments, due to their key role in the most advanced research and 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Minneapolis-based Cray, whose founder Seymour Cray invented the first 
supercomputer, is the world's largest manufacturer, while the Japanese -- with 
NEC, Fujitsu Ltd. and Hitachi Ltd. -- have captured only 5% of the market 
outside Japan in their five years in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
But experts say Japanese vendors have grabbed 29% of the global market by 
locking up their home country -- a source of trade friction between Tokyo and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's Ministry of Trade and Industry has poured money into supercomputing 
since 1983, but the progress of U.S. companies has slowed. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's price/performance curve for supercomputing speed has slowed 
tremendously since 1984, found a recent survey sponsored by the National 
Research Council. 
</P>
<P>
"This country is spending lots of money buying supercomputers but they are not 
supporting supercomputing research and development," said David Kuck, director 
of the University of Illinois's supercomputer center.

Firm to Restructure Bond Debt: New Visions Entertainment, a Century City-based 
independent film producer, said it is negotiating to restructure its $16 
million in bond debt, but that it does not expect to make its $500,000 interest 
payment during the 30-day grace period ending April 30. The 15-month-old 
company's first movie release, "Rooftops," flopped at the box office last 
month. The firm originated in the merger of New Century Entertainment with 
producer-director Taylor Hackford's New Visions Inc.

SEARS REPORTS 63.7% DROP IN NET INCOME

<P>
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. Monday reported a 63.7% drop in its first-quarter net 
income but the retailing giant said the results were distorted by an accounting 
change that inflated last year's earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding the $544.2-million credit Sears gained in the first quarter of 1988 
with a new accounting method, the company's net income rose 56.3% in the first 
quarter of 1989, Sears said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
Sears reported net income of $257.7 million, or 70 cents a share, for the first 
three months of this year. The figure compared to $709.1 million, or $1.87 a 
share, for the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
First-quarter revenue rose 10.9% to $12.16 billion, compared to $10.96 billion 
in 1988's first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Edward A. Brennan said all Sears' business groups reported record-high 
quarterly revenue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Delighted' With Response 
</P>
<P>
Sales of the Sears Merchandise Group, the retailing division, rose 11.9% to 
$6.76 billion during the first quarter from $6.04 billion a year earlier. The 
division's revenue jumped 16.4% in March following the introduction of a new 
low pricing policy. 
</P>
<P>
"We are delighted with consumer response," Brennan said. "The results confirmed 
our belief that everyday low pricing is an idea whose time has come." 
</P>
<P>
Sears also owns Allstate Insurance, Dean Witter Financial Services and Coldwell 
Banker Real Estate.

DREXEL WORKERS SUE FIRM OVER SALE PLAN; 
</P>

BROKERS CLAIM DIVESTITURE OF RETAIL UNIT WILL COST THEM MILLIONS

<P>
Three Drexel Burnham Lambert employees are suing the investment banking firm 
over its plans to sell its retail brokerage business. 
</P>
<P>
In a class-action suit filed Monday in New York State Supreme Court in 
Manhattan, the three workers charge Drexel's top managers with breach of 
contract and violations of their fiduciary duties because of the planned 
divestiture. 
</P>
<P>
The suit contends that the sale of the unit will cost the brokers millions of 
dollars because they will be forced to sell their Drexel stock for far below 
its true value. The price of the stock is based on book value, which the suit 
did not disclose. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concentrate on Core Business 
</P>
<P>
According to the suit, Drexel has understated the book value of its assets, 
including warrants and options it has received in some deals in lieu of partial 
payment of fees. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder told the New York Times that the firm had not 
studied the suit and had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
Last week -- just days after Drexel announced a settlement on charges of 
securities fraud with the Securities and Exchange Commission -- the firm 
announced plans to sell its retail business, which sells stocks and other 
securities to individuals. The move is designed to let Drexel concentrate on 
its core businesses of investment banking and high-yield "junk bonds," a 
business directed out of the firm's Beverly Hills office. It also would cut 
about one-third of Drexel's work force. 
</P>
<P>
Late Monday, Drexel was said to be close to reaching an agreement to divide up 
and sell its retail operation to Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. and at 
least one other securities concern. Sources said Smith Barney, a unit of 
Primerica Corp., will buy some of Drexel's 42 retail offices. 
</P>
<P>
Prudential-Bache Securities and Dean Witter Reynolds were among the firms also 
rumored to be bidding for some of Drexel's offices.

BRUCE HOROVITZ / MARKETING: SOME TOP AGENCY PROS PICK ADS THEY ADMIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It takes a lot to get Phil Dusenberry excited about a TV commercial. After all, 
the New York ad agency chief probably sees more commercials than Dodger slugger 
Kirk Gibson sees curve balls. 
</P>
<P>
But one recent evening, while Dusenberry was home with his wife watching 
television, a commercial suddenly had both of them vying to be the first to 
blurt out what the ad was about. The rather simple commercial features an 
orchestra conductor who walks into a room, stands on his head, and begins 
conducting the orchestra with his feet. 
</P>
<P>
While Dusenberry and his wife began shouting out words like "music" and 
"orchestra," the commercial suddenly switched to a picture of the NYNEX (New 
York/New England) Yellow Pages. The phone book opens up and the camera zooms to 
the listing, "Conductive Shoes." That's right, "conductive shoes," is an 
honest-to-gosh listing in the Yellow Pages in all seven states served by NYNEX. 
</P>
<P>
Dusenberry's agency, BBDO Worldwide, is best known for its Pepsi ads. Although 
BBDO didn't create this ad campaign of visual puns, he wishes it had. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the best campaign out there right now," said Dusenberry of the ad created 
by the New York office of the Venice ad firm, Chiat/Day. And many of Madison 
Avenue's top ad executives are in full agreement with Dusenberry. 
</P>
<P>
Ten executives from some of New York's biggest ad firms were asked to name 
their favorite commercial campaigns over the past year -- excluding those 
created by their own agencies. Eight of those executives picked NYNEX. The 
campaign includes a dozen commercials that are all visual puns. 
</P>
<P>
Most Los Angeles area residents will probably never see these NYNEX 
commercials, because the ads are only aired in New England and in New York 
state. But advertising executives also picked some very familiar commercials as 
close seconds to the NYNEX spots, including ads for Oldsmobile, Pepsi, Subaru 
and Reebok. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, their favorite print campaign -- hands down -- is the one for 
American Express. It features portraits of famous celebrities by photographer 
Annie Leibovitz. The celebrities reveal how long they've carried the credit 
card. The ads, which include entertainers ranging from Luciano Pavarotti to 
Ella Fitzgerald, were created by the ad firm Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been the best print campaign for the past six years," said Richard J. 
Lord, chairman of the ad agency Lord Einstein O'Neil &amp; Partners, which 
creates ads for Saab. "It's terrific stuff, with clarity and purpose." 
</P>
<P>
Overall, however, executives said that the quality of advertising may be at an 
all-time low. "These days, every time the client sneezes, the ad agency wipes 
its nose," said Robert H. Schmidt, president and chief executive of the New 
York ad firm Levine, Huntley, Schmidt &amp; Beaver Inc. "That is not a way to 
create great advertising." 
</P>
<P>
But the NYNEX campaign is great advertising, said Schmidt, whose agency creates 
ads for Subaru and Maidenform. "It draws attention in a very charming and 
memorable way to a very dull product." 
</P>
<P>
The NYNEX ads were specifically created to get attention, said Jane Newman, 
president of the New York office of Chiat/Day. "Everyone takes the Yellow Pages 
for granted," said Newman. "That's because they're given to you free, kind of 
like water. Of course, eventually you get a bill for the water." So, two years 
ago, the agency decided it could generate more interest in the NYNEX Yellow 
Pages with ads that feature people playing charades that spell out listings in 
the Yellow Pages. 
</P>
<P>
In one ad, a handful of gruff-looking train engineers sit on fine furniture 
while drinking tea and discussing things like interior design. The Yellow Page 
heading to that ad: civil engineers. Yet another ad, which is set to the music 
from "The Stripper," features a stuffed chair that seems to be stripping itself 
of arm covers, cushions and even coils -- all in rhythm to the music. The phone 
book category for that ad: furniture stripping. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from NYNEX, most executives agreed that Oldsmobile's "New Generation of 
Olds" ads rank among the best. The ads feature well-known celebrities and their 
offspring -- such as former astronaut Scott Carpenter and his son, Jay. "In a 
believable way, the campaign brings them into the '90s," said James B. 
Patterson, chief executive of the New York office of J. Walter Thompson, which 
creates ads for Ford. "But the product still has to live up to the 
advertising," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Oldsmobile campaign also gets thumbs up from another top executive at J. 
Walter Thompson, William M. Lane, who is executive vice president of the New 
York office. "I admire advertising when you can't substitute someone else's 
product for it," he said. "You couldn't substitute the line 'This is not your 
father's Buick' for the line 'This is not your father's Oldsmobile.' " 
</P>
<P>
Pepsi's advertising is also highly regarded by many ad executives. Most were 
particularly impressed with the ads featuring actor Michael J. Fox -- including 
one where Fox and his girlfriend try to snatch a Pepsi from a soda machine 
while a growling dog is at their feet. "The ad is an absolute stunner," said 
Norman Berry, chairman and chief executive of the New York office of the ad 
firm Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide. "What's more, it has a relevance to its 
audience. This is the sort of thing that happens to 16-year-olds." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there are also some 16-year-olds who would drive a Subaru through a 
rainstorm to see each other. And an ad with that scenario -- created by Levine, 
Huntley, Schmidt &amp; Beaver -- is one of Newman's favorites. "You can't help 
but like the people in that ad," said the Chiat/Day president. 
</P>
<P>
But executives were harshly divided over the almost surrealistic ad campaign 
that Chiat/Day created last year for athletic shoe maker Reebok. The campaign, 
which has since been killed, featured the slogan, "Reebok Lets U.B.U." The ads 
positioned Reebok shoes as fashion statements, and the people who wore them 
were clearly making statements. One commercial, for example, featured a fairy 
tale-like princess exiting a busy New York subway station while wearing 
Reeboks. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a brave and interesting attempt to try and stand out," said Louise 
McNamee, president of the ad firm Della Femina, McNamee WCRS, which created the 
Joe Isuzu "liar" ads. "I liked its irreverence. But most of all, I liked that 
it didn't look like anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Others say U.B.U was D.O.A. "I think they lost a lot more customers then they 
gained with that campaign," said Patterson of J. Walter Thompson. "A lot of 
people just looked at the ads and said: What the hell is this?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Steamy Billboards Generate Some Heat 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, those racy billboards for Johnnie Walker Scotch are bringing a 
lot of business to the phone company. 
</P>
<P>
The billboards, which feature suggestive photos of male and female models in 
swimsuits, all list local phone numbers along with the headline: "And I drink 
Johnnie Walker Scotch." During the past month, 37 of these billboards have 
appeared along freeways in Los Angeles and San Francisco. While executives at 
New York-based Johnnie Walker have yet to measure how the $3-million campaign 
has affected sales, the company reports that more than 40,000 phone calls had 
been placed as of April 15. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ad firm that created the campaign has received some calls, too. 
"Some people have written or called us to accuse us of being sexist," said Leo 
Greenland, chairman and chief executive of the New York ad firm that created 
the campaign, Smith/Greenland Inc. "But that was not our intention." Greenland 
said he has received about a dozen complaints -- all of them from women. 
</P>
<P>
"There are men in this world, there are women in this world, and there is sex 
in this world," said Greenland, whose agency also creates ads for Penthouse 
magazine. "We certainly haven't introduced sex to advertising." 
</P>
<P>
Some have objected that Johnnie Walker is using a form of "phone sex" as an 
attention-getter. "This isn't phone sex," said Greenland. "It's more a spoof on 
phone sex than anything." Those who dial the number in Los Angeles, are greeted 
by the voice of a sexy woman -- or man -- who talks about all the fun things 
they like to do in Los Angeles -- then pitches Johnnie Walker. 
</P>
<P>
In July, the campaign will begin to appear in a number of other cities, 
including Denver, Boston and New York. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, some ad executives have voiced opposition to the campaign. 
"This is advertising that appeals to the most base human emotions," said 
William M. Lane, executive vice president of the New York office at the ad firm 
J. Walter Thompson. "It's easy advertising that any of us could do, but that 
few of us would."

Salomon Inc.: The New York-based firm said it lost $28 million in the first 
quarter, with profits in the company's energy division partially compensating 
for $150 million in losses by the company's securities and commodities arms. 
The loss was the latest in a series of gloomy reports by Wall Street firms 
attributed to a sluggish securities business. Salomon, the parent of Salomon 
Bros., said the loss compared to a year earlier profit of $173 million. Revenue 
declined 4.3% to $1.54 billion. The firm said a $72-million pretax loss was 
reduced by a $44-million income tax benefit.

Fireman's Fund Corp. : The Novato, Calif., insurance firm reported 
first-quarter net income of $36.5 million, down 43% from a year ago. Revenue 
slipped 15.7% to $830.7 million. The company attributed the revenue drop to its 
attempts to hold the line on prices while commercial insurance rates weaken 
throughout the industry. But despite the attempts, the company's underwriting 
ratio, which measures the cost of insurance compared to revenue from premiums, 
rose to 113.6% from 107.5% in the year-earlier quarter.

Capital Cities-ABC Inc.: The New York entertainment firm said its first-quarter 
earnings rose 18% to $82.8 million even as revenue tumbled 13% to $1.12 billion 
from a strong period a year ago, when ABC telecast the 1988 Super Bowl game and 
the Winter Olympics. The results include interest income of $25.5 million, up 
six times from a year earlier. The company said its operating income slipped 2% 
to $163.8 million as its operating profit from broadcasting operations fell 
while income from publishing operations held steady.

JAPANESE FIRM PLANS TO BUILD TERMINAL AT PORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley announced Monday that a major Japanese shipping firm has 
agreed to build a container terminal at the Port of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, who is on an 11-day trade mission in the Far East, met Monday in Tokyo 
with Kimio Miyaoka, president of Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line) and reached a 
basic agreement for the construction of the terminal for NYK's exclusive use at 
the port. 
</P>
<P>
The new facility, which will be NYK's first exclusive-use terminal in America, 
is scheduled to be completed in 1991 on a 100-acre site at Terminal Island. 
</P>
<P>
It is expected to be the largest such terminal operated by a Japanese firm in 
the United States and will be designed with a state-of-the-art computer, which 
NYK said would enable it to improve the quality of its service to the United 
States.

JIM MURRAY: ALMOST LIKE PICKING FROM A CATALOGUE

How would you like to own a business in which your material, already partially 
refined, is delivered to you at no charge, no shipping cost, no labor cost, no 
developmental cost, no promotional, publicity or advertising fees? It's all 
yours. No strings attached. 
</P>
<P>
Let's face it. If you're in the steel business, you have to go out and buy the 
iron mine, steam-shovel the ore out, put it on an ore boat, ship it to the 
mills, refine it, fabricate it -- and only then do you get to go out and sell 
it to the public. 
</P>
<P>
If you have a suit business, you have to buy the land, put the sheep on it, 
shear the sheep, weave the wool, cut the cloth, design the style -- and then 
ship it to markets and split the profit. 
</P>
<P>
The owners in the National Football League are the luckiest tycoons in the 
world. Every business in the country has to envy them. 
</P>
<P>
Watching the NFL draft Sunday, I was struck anew at how fortunate they were. 
Here they were, wallowing in the biggest pool of natural talent, the great glut 
of material for their business -- and all they had to do was buy it uniforms 
and give it a football. They didn't even have the Japanese to worry about. The 
rest of corporate America must be gnashing its teeth. 
</P>
<P>
Their business is athletics and selling tickets -- and shaving cream and beer 
-- and here was a ready-made pool of the year's greatest athletes handed to 
them on a silver platter, fully publicized and advertised -- to the point where 
a cable network could spend three hours at the suspenseful drama of where a 
5-foot-8, 195-pound college junior was going to be working for the next 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
It's the most felicitous business arrangement in the free world. There isn't 
even any middleman. 
</P>
<P>
Their deal contravenes whole sections of the U.S Constitution. It was not a 
right given over to pro football by any particular legislation, it was a 
privilege it just arrogated in a more innocent past. Today, it survives as part 
of a union agreement between management and players. Except there's no union 
agreement currently. And hardly any union, whose only hope is in the courts, 
not the bargaining table. 
</P>
<P>
Basketball enjoys somewhat the same arrangement as pro football but hardly any 
other sports -- or businesses -- do. Baseball must maintain an extensive and 
costly minor league system to develop its raw material. Football leaves this to 
the taxpayers of the state institutions and/or the eternal sophomore alumni who 
endow things like a permanent punting scholarship so they can walk around town 
with "Go Big Blue!" painted on their hats. 
</P>
<P>
The pro draft is a felicitous arrangement for all concerned. The colleges, 
after all, get the kids to play for nothing by dangling the prospect of a 
multimillion-dollar pro career in front of them. It behooves a college to put 
as many players in the pros as it can. It improves its image as a pipeline to 
the pros, a triple-A franchise in the farm system of big-time sports. 
</P>
<P>
Colleges were not always that enthusiastic. I can remember a time when Tex 
Schramm, then publicity director for the Rams, told me how the team had to get 
office secretaries to address the envelopes of letters to draft prospects and 
then douse the letter in perfume to deceive the athletic departments into 
thinking they were love letters, otherwise they might not get delivered. 
</P>
<P>
Another time, the Rams were so desperate for draft information that the late 
Dan Reeves, former team owner, proposed that the magazine I worked for get film 
on prospects under the guise of needing it for selection of an All-American 
team, whereupon I was to turn the clips over to the Rams. They would give me an 
All-American team and their scouting department a title team. 
</P>
<P>
You don't need these subterfuges anymore. The colleges and the pros are locked 
in a mutually beneficial loop. Something for everybody. 
</P>
<P>
The pros need prime material now more than ever. In an attempt to get the hot 
breath of the federal courts off their necks, they have cut loose great chunks 
of their player pool. There never was a better chance for a rookie class than 
this year of Our Lord in the pros. There are holes in nearly every franchise, 
caused by the picking-over of quality free agents. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the new draftees are proven ticket-sellers -- Heisman Trophy 
winners, Outland Trophy winners, All-Americans, Rose Bowl veterans, the pros 
take no chances. Even with nothing to lose, they stage a kind of complicated 
audition for the class of 1989 at Indianapolis where they measure the trade for 
ability to jump, speed and strength as well as for personal habits and 
predilections. They not only look gift horses in the mouth, they make them jump 
fences. 
</P>
<P>
Still, they make mistakes. So, it is the policy herewith to cut down on these 
with a little helpful advice for the owners who already get everything else 
they need free. 
</P>
<P>
1. Don't be too sure the No. 1 pick will be a big star. Roger Staubach was 
chosen in the 10th round. Norm Van Brocklin was chosen in the fourth. Bob Hayes 
was chosen in the seventh. John Unitas was chosen in the ninth, then cut and 
had to come back to the NFL as a free agent off the sandlots. 
</P>
<P>
2. Don't go after the running back. If Earl Campbell or O.J. Simpson can't get 
you into a Super Bowl, no one can. If Gale Sayers can't win you a championship, 
who will? The Dallas Cowboys finished last with a Heisman Trophy winner in the 
backfield last year. The Raiders had two. 
</P>
<P>
3. Don't bother with the Ivy League. An occasional Calvin Hill or Gary Fencik 
may come from Yale, an Ed Marinaro from Cornell, but skip the Fight Fiercelies. 
Harvard is totally out of the question and Princeton is, too. 
</P>
<P>
4. Get the quarterback. Joe Montana was a third-round choice by the San 
Francisco 49ers. Warren Moon wasn't drafted at all. It's inconceivable that 
Rodney Peete wouldn't be drafted for five rounds. Give Barry Sanders the 
Heisman Trophy. But give Rodney Peete the football. 
</P>
<P>
5. Get a kicker. About 70% of NFL games are won by field goals, one way or 
another. Most of the points in the NFL are scored by kickers. Isn't that the 
bottom line? 
</P>
<P>
6. Get the defense. The greatest single draft choice in the history of the NFL 
might have been Bob Lilly by the Cowboys in 1961. Or Merlin Olsen by the Rams 
in 1962. The greatest 14th-round pick of all time was Deacon Jones by the Rams 
in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
7. Get the coach. Coaches win even more games than kickers. It's their game. 
Does anybody seriously doubt that a Vince Lombardi would have the Atlanta 
Falcons in the Super Bowl in three years? Maybe two.

WHY THE NFL KEPT PEETE HANGING ON; 
</P>
<P>
AND ON THE SECOND DAY OF DRAFT, EX-TROJAN QB TURNS UP AS A LION 
</P>

<P>
It was a long wait for Rodney Peete, but he landed on his feet. 
</P>
<P>
The two-time Rose Bowl quarterback from USC will be playing this year for the 
team that can give him his best chance to succeed in the National Football 
League. 
</P>
<P>
Or so it seemed Monday when, as the second player chosen on the second day of 
the draft, Peete went to the NFL's only run 'n' shoot team, the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll be a real good one in that offense," Gil Brandt, the Dallas Cowboys' 
chief scout, said after Detroit picked Peete in the sixth round. 
</P>
<P>
"We're sure glad to have him," said Mouse Davis, Detroit's passing coach and 
the inventor of the run 'n' shoot offense. 
</P>
<P>
"Rodney is a quarterback who has everything -- everything to play well in the 
NFL, enough size, the foot speed, the intelligence and the charisma to lead -- 
provided his arm is strong enough. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the big if. We think he has an arm -- but it's an if. The arm explains 
why he didn't go in the first five rounds (Sunday)." 
</P>
<P>
In Detroit, Peete will join another rookie, running back Barry Sanders, to give 
Coach Wayne Fontes' team what could be a faster, younger look this year. 
</P>
<P>
For in the most recent Heisman Trophy voting, Sanders and Peete, two small, 
unusual players who have rare speed for the positions they play, finished 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
It was chance that gave Detroit a shot at the Trojan quarterback, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
"Rodney had a bad day at the Indianapolis roundup," he said, referring to the 
scouts' convention in February, when the nation's top 300 college prospects 
were all on view. 
</P>
<P>
"He had hurt his shoulder in an all-star game after the Rose Bowl, and he 
didn't have much velocity at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that scared everybody off. It scared us off for a few rounds, and it's 
still a concern. But Rodney had thrown hard enough during the season -- and he 
has so much talent -- that we decided to go for him right off (Monday) 
morning." 
</P>
<P>
Others have suggested that it was racial bias that ruined Peete's Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Hogwash," said Davis, commenting on wire-service stories out of Green Bay, 
Wis., where Peete's father, Willie -- an assistant Packer coach -- discussed 
the possibility of prejudice against his son, a black quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
In the discussion with Wisconsin reporters, Willie Peete was answering 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if racial bias might have been involved, he said: "I hope not, not in 
1989. If there is, it's too bad. We're in real bad trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Then he said: "I have some questions. I have some real hard questions that I 
don't know if anyone can answer." 
</P>
<P>
But when he asked them, none had racial implications. 
</P>
<P>
Nor does the league see any. 
</P>
<P>
David Cornwell, the league's director of minority relations, identified last 
year's three black NFL starters -- Doug Williams, Randall Cunningham and Warren 
Moon -- and said: 
</P>
<P>
"A decade ago, I think you could say (there was prejudice), but I don't think 
it's the case now. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to a lot of black personnel people, and the feeling was that (Peete) 
wasn't rated as highly as a lot of people thought he was." 
</P>
<P>
The ratings were based largely on Peete's regular-season performance before he 
was injured in two of his last three games. 
</P>
<P>
First, against Notre Dame in late November, he played gamely in the second half 
after separating his left shoulder when tackled in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Next, at the Hula Bowl in January, a similar injury to the other shoulder 
knocked him out of the game, and kept him out of the Shrine game at Stanford a 
week later. 
</P>
<P>
"People began to worry about Peete's durability," said Sid Gillman, the Hall of 
Fame coach who was a scout last season for the Kansas City Chiefs. "And I think 
there's good reason to worry about his size. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the smallest quarterback drafted this year, and I think that's why he 
didn't go until (Monday)." 
</P>
<P>
Most scouts have measured Peete at 6 feet 1/2 inch, and most list him at 195 
pounds. Gillman said he's closer to 190. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Elkins of Wake Forest, the second quarterback drafted Sunday, stands 6-3 
and weighs 222, about the size of top pick Troy Aikman of UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth-round quarterback drafted by the Rams, Jeff Carlson of Weber State, 
goes 6-3 and 210. 
</P>
<P>
"More than ever today, they're looking for quarterbacks with size," Gillman 
said. "We had some little quarterbacks in former years -- but that was when the 
defensive players were smaller, too. 
</P>
<P>
"The game has changed. Defensive linemen have changed. Linebackers have changed 
-- they line up as down linemen today and take dead aim on the passer. The 
defensive premium is on the pass rush now -- and if the passer isn't a big, 
strong guy, he's going to get hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"Peete simply isn't big enough to play on most NFL teams today, and that's why 
nobody took him (Sunday)." 
</P>
<P>
Detroit's offense is different, and so is San Francisco's. These, Gillman said, 
are the only two pro clubs that could accommodate Peete, and the 49ers seem 
satisfied with the two quarterbacks they have, Joe Montana and Steve Young. 
</P>
<P>
"Peete might be big enough for the run 'n' shoot," Gillman said. "And he was 
the fastest quarterback drafted this year. That means something. 
</P>
<P>
"He's also the best running quarterback I've ever seen -- the best at throwing 
on the run. He can hit you in the ear running full speed, and that's what you 
want in the Detroit offense." 
</P>
<P>
Peete will arrive in Detroit just in time to participate with Sanders in the 
first full-blown run 'n' shoot try by an NFL club. 
</P>
<P>
This was the system that Davis used at Houston to make Jim Kelly a famous 
quarterback in the days of the United States Football League, but most NFL 
coaches and scouts say it won't work in this league, largely because run 'n' 
shoot teams line up without a tight end. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, there are four wide receivers at all times, along with one running 
back. On a typical play, the back carries the ball only if the quarterback, as 
he sprints along behind the line of scrimmage, finds that the defense has 
doubled all of his potential catchers. 
</P>
<P>
It's a system that sounds as if it might have been designed for Peete and 
Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
"On sprint-out plays, Peete has the perfect vision that you want in a run 'n' 
shoot passer," Gillman said. "Barry Sanders is another little guy who looks 
just right for the run 'n' shoot because of his quickness." 
</P>
<P>
The Lions' returning running backs are Gary James and James Jones, who at first 
will start ahead of Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
They have three other quarterbacks -- Chuck Long, Rusty Hilger and Eric Hipple 
-- but Long had postseason elbow surgery, and the Lions say he won't be ready 
for a while. Hilger and Hipple have run the Lions, who haven't been dominant 
with either. 
</P>
<P>
With Peete, who knows? Does he have the arm, or are the other 27 teams right 
about him? Will the run 'n' shoot run in the NFL, or are the 27 other teams 
right about that, too? This is wait-and-see time.

OLD SHOE KEEPS PENGUINS IN STEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Talking to Gene Ubriaco these days, you get the feeling that he still doesn't 
realize where he is, even after an entire season as a coach in the National 
Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
Ubriaco coaches the Pittsburgh Penguins, who are tied, 2-2, in the Patrick 
Division final series with Philadelphia after a 4-1 loss to the Flyers Sunday 
night at the Spectrum. The Penguins go back to Pittsburgh tonight for Game 5 of 
the best-of-seven series. 
</P>
<P>
Coaching the Penguins puts Ubriaco in hockey's big time, all right, but "Ubie" 
-- that's what he was known as when he was coach of the Baltimore Skipjacks of 
the American Hockey League for the last five years -- doesn't seem to 
understand that. 
</P>
<P>
He is the same old shoe as when he suffered the indignities of the American 
Hockey League, the worst of them last year. 
</P>
<P>
After coaching in the minor leagues for 14 years, Ubriaco is not about to 
change. He is still the smiling, down-to-earth guy he's always been. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday night at the Spectrum -- where, even at a $39 top price, every seat was 
sold out for the Penguins-Flyers game -- he was classic Ubriaco. 
</P>
<P>
The Penguins arrived at the arena two hours before the faceoff; Ubriaco's 
players filed solemnly into the visitors' dressing room. They looked so young. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the second youngest team in the National Hockey League," Ubriaco said 
proudly. 
</P>
<P>
"Which team is the youngest?" he was asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," he said. "They keep telling me we're the second youngest." 
</P>
<P>
One of Ubriaco's young players is Mario Lemieux, 23. For the second straight 
year, he led the NHL in scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Is Lemieux better than Wayne Gretzky? 
</P>
<P>
"He is in many ways," said Ubriaco. "Gretzky is like a water bug. He darts here 
and there. 
</P>
<P>
"Mario is big, 6-4, 210. He's a thinking man. He knows where everyone on the 
ice is. He knows where everyone is supposed to be. That's very unusual for a 
player his age." 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux is, of course, the principal reason the Penguins are where they are. He 
led the NHL in goals, points, power-play goals and short-handed goals. Of the 
Penguins' 347 goals this year, he scored or assisted on 199 - 57.3%, the 
highest percentage in league history. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Pittsburgh is in the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time 
since the 1981-82 season and for only the 10th time in the team's 22-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia, by contrast, has been in the playoffs 17 straight years and 20 
times in 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
How did Lemieux respond to Ubriaco who, the year before, had won only 13 games 
with an AHL club? 
</P>
<P>
"The first day of practice at training camp," said Ubriaco, "when I blew the 
whistle to call the players together, Mario skated right up to me. That sent a 
message. That showed the other players the new coach had his attention." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday evening Lemieux dressed quietly as Ubriaco spoke. The players talked 
very little as game time approached. 
</P>
<P>
"The game is so much faster up here in the NHL," said Ubriaco, 50. "Everything 
is faster. All the players are a step faster. Two steps. A coach in this league 
has to be more alert. Way more alert." 
</P>
<P>
This is a whole new way of life for Ubriaco, who thought that he would spend 
the rest of his career coaching in the minors. Then-General Manager Tony 
Esposito hired him last summer. 
</P>
<P>
"You live better up here," Ubriaco said. "You have a bigger support staff. 
People in the front office take care of things like marketing, which I had to 
do in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still tough, though. When I was hired, some people cried cronyism. I'm 
from the same town in Canada, Sault Ste. Marie, as Tony Esposito, even though I 
knew his brother Phil better. 
</P>
<P>
"The media up here expects you to win every game. We had great guys covering 
the Skipjacks in Baltimore -- George Taylor, Jim Jackson. Before that Lou 
Hatter. You're under a microscope in this league. Up here, behind the bench is 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
What Ubriaco set out to do this year, he says, was build relationships and make 
the talented Penguins into a team. He is the 11th coach this team has had. 
</P>
<P>
"Mario Lemieux and Paul Coffey are big stars in this league," Ubriaco said, 
"but they're not interested in individual goals. They want to win, and they 
know the only way you can do that is with everybody pulling together as a team. 
</P>
<P>
"I've asked Mario to become a leader. Up to now, he was too young for that. Now 
he's been in the league five years. He's a leader on this team." 
</P>
<P>
The leader had a rough time of it in the Spectrum Sunday night. In the first 
period he injured a knee. In the third, he collided with his own teammate, 
Randy Cunneyworth, and went down. He was dazed and lay there motionless for a 
few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Mario'll be all right for the next game (Tuesday) night," Ubriaco said. 
"Tonight, we just couldn't get our rhythm. We couldn't stop the Flyers' power 
play." 
</P>
<P>
Ubriaco was not upset after Sunday night's loss. He takes the long-range view 
of the series. "It's best two-out-of-three now," he said. "With two of those 
games at home, we'll be all right." 
</P>
<P>
Home. Home in Pittsburgh for Ubriaco is an apartment near the Civic Arena. He 
lives there alone. His wife of 27 years, Nella, and their son, Gene Jr., still 
live in Maryland. The Ubriacos have a married daughter who traveled to 
Philadelphia over the weekend to see the Penguins split two games with the 
Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
"Being up in Pittsburgh by myself has been the hard part," Ubriaco said. "It's 
been like being on retreat. Hockey retreat." 
</P>
<P>
You might think that Ubriaco would relish life in the big leagues after all 
those years in the minors, that he'd be trying to forget last year in 
Baltimore. He doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not at all sorry I did what I did last year in Baltimore, as difficult as 
it was," he said. "I learned a lot from that experience. I learned to 
appreciate some things." 
</P>
<P>
And he'd like to keep appreciating the playoffs for a while longer.

38-1 LONGSHOT WINS THE SAN JACINTO HANDICAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY HOVDEY, Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Anita's controversial season of fitful grass racing came to an end on 
Monday afternoon with longshot Master Treaty scoring an appropriate 38-1 upset 
in the featured $111,450 San Jacinto Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
An hour later, the heavy machinery was on the move, scraping the much-maligned 
course to its base in preparation for a front-lawn project you wouldn't wish on 
your worst neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
In the next three months, Santa Anita will spend more than $3 million on 30,000 
tons of sand, 7,500 tons of gravel and 10 acres of United States Golf 
Assn.-approved Bermuda tiff green sod to end the nightmare of the 1989 meeting, 
when major grass racing became a little too much of an adventure. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Vienna, trainer of the Canadian-bred gelding Master Treaty, is equally 
glad the '89 meeting is history. The San Jacinto was Vienna's last opportunity 
to salvage a crumb from the rich stakes schedule, and even he gave his horse a 
slim chance to win. 
</P>
<P>
"What a surprise," Vienna said after Master Treaty's half-length victory over 
Silent Prince. "I really didn't have very high hopes going in." 
</P>
<P>
Three days before the race, Vienna didn't even have a rider. 
</P>
<P>
"They aren't exactly lining up for him," Vienna said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure they are," countered Vienna's assistant, Greg Otteson. "I heard a couple 
guys got in a fight over him." 
</P>
<P>
Not likely. In his two California appearances, the son of English star Master 
Willie was beaten more than 33 lengths. His San Jacinto opposition included 
such proven stakes runners as The Medic, Delighter, Vallotton and Wait Till 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
By process of elimination, Robbie Davis got the mount and made the most of a 
fast pace and a choppy, tiring course. The winner came from a distant last to 
win going away. 
</P>
<P>
"That's fun, a surprise like that," said Davis, who came to California in 
February to pick up the pieces of his career. Davis was aboard the horse that 
trampled New York jockey Mike Venezia to death last November at Belmont Park. 
He stayed away from the track for about four months, and for a time considered 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Making a fresh start in California, Davis won 28 races at the Santa Anita 
meeting, good enough for 11th place in the standings behind champion Laffit 
Pincay, who won 110 to take his 13th local title. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tickled to death," Davis said of his success. "I didn't come here with the 
intention to ride that many horses. I really thought I'd be scraping to get 
mounts." 
</P>
<P>
Vienna had a respectable 19 winners, although the San Jacinto was his first 
stakes victory at Santa Anita in more than 15 months. He finished nine 
victories behind the meet's leading trainer, Gary Jones. 
</P>
<P>
"You would not believe how many horses I've had get sick or injured here," 
Vienna said. "As for Master Treaty, he bled significantly in his last race, so 
he got Lasix (a permitted diuretic) today and I'm sure that made most of the 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
Master Treaty, owned by Thomas and Cathryn Joy of Pasadena and Austin Taylor of 
Toronto, ran the 1 1/4 miles in 2:01 3/5 to give Vienna his third San Jacinto 
victory. He paid $79.40, $23.40 and $7.40, and triggered a $1,425.50 exacta to 
runner-up Silent Prince, a New Zealander making his first North American start. 
The Medic, who won the race last year and was favored at 11-10, finished third. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 31,595 was on hand for the last Santa Anita program, boosting the 
final on-site average attendance for the 91-day meeting to 25,463. That figure 
was 6.8% below last year's average. 
</P>
<P>
Betting was up, but only by 2%. The average daily take -- which includes eight 
off-track sites -- was $7,267,533. A total of $654,077,964 was bet during the 
meet, a California record. 
</P>
<P>
The handle -- and Santa Anita's prestige -- suffered considerably during a 
siege of cold, wet January weather when the grass course became unusable. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem was drainage," said plant superintendent Clint Granath. "The water 
would not penetrate far enough into the sand base, and the grass would only 
take root as far as the water went." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Notes 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Thad Ackel reports that Great Communicator emerged unscathed from his 
disappointing sixth in Sunday's San Juan Capistrano. "He acted just like he did 
after his bad race in the Arlington Million last year," Ackel said Monday. "It 
was as if he never ran at all." . . . Bill Shoemaker did not have a mount in 
the San Jacinto, so he will take up his pursuit of stakes win No. 1,000 on 
Wednesday at Hollywood Park when he rides Basic Exchange in the Debonair Stakes 
. . . First post for Hollywood's opener Wednesday is 1:30 p.m.

A STREAK HITTER; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER SUSPENSION FOR DRUGS, CHRIS ANTLEY HAS A RUN OF SUCCESS AT AQUEDUCT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
LEXINGTON, Ky. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's dollars to doughnuts that Chris Antley won't ride a winner at Aqueduct 
today. 
</P>
<P>
It's impossible for Antley to win a race in New York because he is at 
Keeneland, to ride Dispersal in the $100,000 Lexington Stakes, and Aqueduct 
isn't open today. 
</P>
<P>
But then again, Antley has been doing the impossible for 10 weeks, winning at 
least one race a day at Aqueduct for the last 60 days he has ridden there. 
Footnotes are needed to qualify this unprecedented streak but by any standard, 
Antley is giving New Yorkers the most extraordinary stretch of race riding 
since teen-aged Steve Cauthen was clicking off winners there 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
And what makes the streak more exceptional is that it started on Feb. 8, two 
weeks after Antley's return from serving a two-month suspension for drug use. 
Antley, 23, tested positive for cocaine at Aqueduct late in November -- his 
third violation for drugs or alcohol in about two years -- and spent a month in 
a rehabilitation program before track stewards lifted the suspension. 
</P>
<P>
Antley immediately began winning races in clusters, in a fashion that reminded 
California stewards of Pat Valenzuela, another troubled jockey who has 
repeatedly been able to quickly resume winning after prolonged absences. 
</P>
<P>
His second day back, in late January, Antley won two races. He had several good 
days after that, but starting on Feb. 8, when he rode the entire nine-race card 
at Aqueduct and won twice, he has been unstoppable. 
</P>
<P>
Antley has ridden out of town four times -- without winning -- during the 
streak, occasions when he's involved in stakes races and doesn't get as many 
mounts as he usually would in New York. The astonishing part about the streak 
is the number of multiple-win days Antley has had. On only 13 days has he won 
just one race. He has had one five-win day, eight days with four wins, 16 
three-win days and 19 two-win days. 
</P>
<P>
In a sport that considers .200 an exceptional average, Antley has won with 141 
of 450 mounts for a .319 average. Antley's lifetime winning percentage was .184 
going into this year. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is no real basis for comparison, when the streak reached 56 days 
last week, it was compared with Joe DiMaggio's record 56-game hitting streak in 
1941, and New York officials even put a Yankee cap on Antley's head in the 
winner's circle. But there is one valid parallel -- DiMaggio, like Antley, 
didn't just coast along in 1941. He had lots of multiple-hit games during his 
streak and wound up batting .357 that season. 
</P>
<P>
"When I hit 56, I thought I might meet Joe DiMaggio," Antley said. Born about 
15 years after the Yankee Clipper's career ended, Antley thought that DiMaggio 
was a long-ago jockey until the ballplayer was identified to him a few weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Wiley Antley, who was born in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., and began riding at 
unrecognized bush tracks in South Carolina in his teens, has always been a 
streaky jockey. He was 17 when he rode his first winner at Pimlico in the 
summer of 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland trainers saw that Antley could ride, and he graduated to the tougher 
New Jersey circuit after a couple of years. Then he moved to New York at the 
end of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Antley was the national leader in races won with 469. That was the 
year he won eight races in one day, five at Monmouth Park in the afternoon and 
three at Garden State Park at night. In 1987, Antley became the only jockey to 
win nine times in a day, doing a four-win matinee at Aqueduct and winning five 
more at New Jersey's Meadowlands that night. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some said Antley lacked consistency. He occasionally rode prominent 
horses, such as Lady's Secret and Bet Twice, but never regularly. 
</P>
<P>
He got his biggest opportunity for national attention when he rode Private 
Terms in the Kentucky Derby. Private Terms won the Wood Memorial and went into 
the Derby undefeated in seven races. Sent off a slight 3-1 favorite over the 
eventual winner, Winning Colors, Private Terms finished a badly beaten ninth. 
He bled internally after the Preakness two weeks later, and Antley suspects 
that the bleeding problem might have started in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Antley didn't expect to get a Derby mount. Trainers haven't been 
known to reserve emerging 3-year-olds for jockeys with drug problems. Early 
last week, Antley said he would be spending Derby day -- May 6 -- at Aqueduct, 
riding On the Line, a crack sprinter, in the Carter Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
But Bud Delp, who trains Dispersal, was unhappy with Jose Santos' ride on the 
second-place finisher in the Blue Grass at Keeneland, and contacted Drew 
Mollica, Antley's agent. If Dispersal runs well here today, he and Antley will 
be in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Franklin, who won the Derby and Preakness for Delp on Spectacular Bid in 
1979, also developed a cocaine habit. In fact, Franklin said he was introduced 
to the drug at a party a few hours after Spectacular Bid's Preakness. Franklin 
is trying to put his life and career back together in Maryland, where he still 
rides a few horses for Delp. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Hernandez, the first baseman who almost wrecked his career because of a 
cocaine habit while he was with the St. Louis Cardinals, referred to the drug 
as the devil. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Antley agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the devil," he said. "My agent and I call it a monster. It's a 
world-wide problem. It's a national crisis. It's something that can get a hold 
of anybody, millionaires or just people up the street." 
</P>
<P>
Antley was a drinker and a marijuana smoker before he tried cocaine for the 
first time. He was 18 and, like Franklin, first used it at a party. 
</P>
<P>
"It plays with your mind," Antley said. "I never used it every day. I might use 
it for two or three weeks, then I'd quit for five months, but I'd keep coming 
back to it. All it takes is one time." 
</P>
<P>
There were rumors that Antley was a user, but he never tested positive. As in 
California, there is random testing of jockeys in New Jersey and New York, with 
the stewards asking for a urine sample if there is "reasonable cause" that a 
rider might be using. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes 48 to 72 hours to get clean, so you know that you can't take a test 
that close to the time you've used it," Antley said. "But when you start doing 
that, you're only fooling yourself." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Antley failed a Breathalyzer test for alcohol just before he was 
supposed to ride one night at the Meadowlands. He said he had been drinking 
beer that afternoon at a college football game at Giants Stadium, which is part 
of the race track complex. 
</P>
<P>
Antley was fined $250. In February of 1988, he tested positive for marijuana at 
Aqueduct. Antley promised racing officials that he would stay clean and was 
allowed to resume riding. 
</P>
<P>
He says he has never ridden under the influence. 
</P>
<P>
On Thanksgiving last year, Antley was suspended indefinitely for failing his 
second drug test. He told Susan Finley, a free-lance writer, that he had 
considered suicide, but about 10 days later he enrolled in a rehabilitation 
program.

NEWSWIRE: ROSE BET ABOUT $1 MILLION, BOOKMAKER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Ohio bookmaker, Ronald Peters, told prosecutors he took as much as $1 
million in bets from Pete Rose, according to a federal transcript made public 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
It was also learned that a letter from baseball Commissioner Bart Giamatti 
states that the commissioner believes the bookmaker's testimony was truthful. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing in the 13-page transcript indicates Rose bet on baseball games. 
However, Alan J. Statman, Peters' lawyer, has said his client had information 
linking the manager of the Cincinnati Reds to baseball betting. 
</P>
<P>
During a pre-sentencing conference at Cincinnati last Friday in the Peters 
case, Robert C. Brichler, assistant U.S. attorney, said: "Mr. Peters has 
indicated to us that he took bets over a period of two years that could very 
well amount to in excess of a million dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti's letter April 18 to Judge Carl B. Rubin, released by the 
commissioner's office, said Peters "provided critical sworn testimony about Mr. 
Rose and his associates." 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Peters has provided probative documentary evidence to support his 
testimony and the testimony of others," Giamatti wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin will sentence Peters on felonies of cocaine trafficking and tax evasion. 
Peters could receive up to 23 years in prison and be fined $1.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin, according to the transcript, was surprised and disturbed by Giamatti's 
unsolicited letter. 
</P>
<P>
"There is evidence here, in my opinion, of a vendetta against Pete Rose," the 
judge said. "Again, I don't care, but it seems to me that whatever cooperation 
Mr. Peters gave them on their investigation is totally and thoroughly 
irrelevant to any charges against Peters, and the idea of confusing the two of 
them I find very offensive."

SCOTT OSTLER: LAS VEGAS MAKES SAFE BET BY CLOSING THE BOOKS ON ROSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Ostler 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What are the odds that you couldn't get a bet down in Las Vegas on an important 
sporting event? 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the event is the Pete Rose Derby. The big question of the 
baseball season is what fate will befall Rose after the inquisition into his 
alleged gambling. Will Pete be cleared of all charges, or will the evidence 
dictate that he be fungoed out of baseball forever? 
</P>
<P>
In Nevada, where prostitution, nuclear testing and riding motorcycles through 
the air over fountains are all legally encouraged activities, the gaming 
commission won't allow the sports books to take bets on Rose. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't take action on anything that can't be proven on the field of play," 
says Russ Culver of the Golden Nugget Sports Book. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, you can't bet on anything involving voters or judges. You can't 
lay money on who might win the Cy Young Award or the Oscar for best actor, or 
on whether or not Pete Rose will fry like a Chicken McNugget. 
</P>
<P>
You can only bet on legit sporting events, such as Robbie Knievel's motorcycle 
jump. 
</P>
<P>
One Las Vegas sports book posted a betting line on the Knievel jump: "4 1/2 
broken bones." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, under the posted line was the disclaimer: "For entertainment only." 
</P>
<P>
A little Las Vegas humor. 
</P>
<P>
Now we know why the Angels didn't win a pennant in the last seven seasons. 
Catcher Bob Boone wouldn't let the Angel pitchers throw inside. 
</P>
<P>
It's a tribute to the character of the pitching staff that the fellows could 
allow their careers to be threatened by this questionable strategy and not say 
one word to the press or teammates. Seven years of silence. Ghandi could have 
taken inner-peace lessons from these guys. 
</P>
<P>
Burning question: What was Gene Mauch doing all that time? Was the Little 
General sitting on the bench thinking, "Gosh, maybe I should say something to 
Bob about how he's destroying our ballclub."? 
</P>
<P>
If you subscribe to the Boone theory of Angel failure, you probably save your 
empties for the Beer Can Fairy. 
</P>
<P>
I'm really trying to understand, and cultivate an appreciation for, the new 
athlete, but Tony Mandarich is going to take some work. 
</P>
<P>
Mandarich is the 6-foot-6, 315-pound Michigan State offensive lineman just 
drafted No. 2 overall by Green Bay. Based on what's being written about him, 
Mandarich makes the Boz look like Gregory Peck. 
</P>
<P>
The most endearing thing I've read about Mandarich is that he and his 
weight-training partner do squats until they regurgitate, striking a blow for 
the work ethic. Of course, the 19 zillion milligrams of caffeine Tony ingests 
before each workout, in liquid and tablet form, may contribute to the upset 
tummy. 
</P>
<P>
Tony vehemently denies using steroids, but then one symptom of steroid use is 
vehemence. Regarding future steroid use, though, Mandarich told Sports 
Illustrated, "I might." 
</P>
<P>
But not with lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Are L.A. sports fans getting out of hand? 
</P>
<P>
The Forum hockey fans are gaining fame as the loudest in the National Hockey 
League. At Sunday's Laker game, a policeman told me during the first quarter 
that he and his boys had already broken up several fights in the stands. "We 
usually only get fighting like this at hockey games," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And now the Dodger crowds. Last Saturday, Kevin Mitchell of the San Francisco 
Giants got what proved to be the game-winning hit at the Stadium. Then, 
slightly ill, he jogged to his position in left field and lost his lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Asked later if this might have surprised the fans in left field, Mitchell said, 
"I wish I could've thrown up on them." 
</P>
<P>
All Mitchell needs is a few training sessions with Tony Mandarich. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of new trends, yet another beefy male athlete has been accused of 
punching a female's lights out. Georgia Tech linebacker Kevin Salisbury 
allegedly broke a woman's nose with a haymaker during a restaurant fight. 
</P>
<P>
Remember the good old days, when men were men, and men punched men? What a 
bunch of chauvinistic pigs we were, but gee, I miss those days. 
</P>
<P>
I knew there was a reason I like hockey. 
</P>
<P>
Glad to see the Dodgers are going to honor Pedro Guerrero before the game next 
time the St. Louis Cardinals are in town. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly what they're honoring him for, I'm not sure. Maybe for the contribution 
he made toward last season's World Series championship by leaving town. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro has already served warning that he is writing a tell-all book about his 
days laboring in the Dodgers sweatshop. He'll probably go into gruesome detail 
about the time the Dodgers asked him to please report to spring training when 
the rest of the team did, or the time they asked him to please get in shape, or 
the time they asked him to please play third base. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it will be hats off to Petey, and has anyone seen my squat rack?

U.S. REJECTS BONN'S APPEAL FOR EARLY TALKS ON MISSILES

The Bush Administration on Monday rebuffed West Germany's appeal for early 
East-West negotiations on limiting short-range nuclear weapons, apparently 
setting the stage for a showdown on the subject next month at a summit meeting 
of North Atlantic Treaty Organization leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"They explained their positions. . . . We explained our position," Secretary of 
State James A. Baker III said in a chilly statement. "As a result, we 
understand their position better and they understand ours better." 
</P>
<P>
State Department officials said later that the unusually blunt language 
signified an impasse that almost four hours of talks did nothing to break. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute has its origins in West Germany's domestic politics. Unless it is 
resolved soon, it could drive a wedge between the United States and NATO's most 
influential European member. 
</P>
<P>
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, faced with plummeting popularity going into 
national elections scheduled for late next year, sent Foreign Minister 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg on a hastily 
scheduled trip to Washington to press Bonn's demand for U.S.-Soviet talks about 
limits on battlefield nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Bonn is seeking movement on the issue before NATO decides whether it will 
modernize the Western alliance's existing arsenal. The modernization decision 
is now scheduled for 1991. 
</P>
<P>
By taking a firm stand against the short-range missiles, Kohl and his coalition 
government apparently hope to defuse the appeal of the more dovish Social 
Democratic Party and the anti-NATO Greens party. 
</P>
<P>
The weapons are very unpopular in West Germany because most of them are stored 
on German territory and, with ranges of less than 300 miles, could be expected 
to do most of their damage in Germany in the event of war between NATO and the 
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
The failure of the Washington meeting, attended by Baker, Defense Secretary 
Dick Cheney, White House National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, Genscher 
and Stoltenberg, to paper over the U.S-West German differences pushes the 
dispute into the NATO summit meeting scheduled May 29-30 in Brussels. President 
Bush, Kohl and other heads of government of the 16-nation alliance are expected 
to attend. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said that Bush had hoped for a harmonious NATO summit that would 
dramatize Western unity and set the stage for later arms control talks with 
Moscow. For this reason, the Administration wanted to smooth over the dispute 
before the Brussels meeting, but the U.S. side was unwilling to make 
substantial concessions to narrow the gap between the two positions. Talking to 
reporters aboard Air Force One on the flight to Norfolk, Va., where he attended 
a memorial service for the sailors killed on the battleship Iowa, President 
Bush struck a conciliatory tone. 
</P>
<P>
"My appeal to the Germans has been that we keep NATO together, to stay 
together," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
But Baker, Cheney and Scowcroft refused to soften the U.S. position. The United 
States, strongly supported by Britain, opposes any reduction in battlefield 
nuclear weapons before a comprehensive East-West pact to reduce conventional 
arms in Europe. The reasoning in Washington and London is that the nuclear 
weapons are needed to offset a Warsaw Pact advantage in tanks, artillery and 
other non-nuclear arms. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney left the talks briefly for a previously scheduled speech at the National 
Defense University. Answering questions after the speech, he made it clear that 
he is not persuaded by the West German presentation. 
</P>
<P>
"We now find ourselves where there are a number of people who would like to 
move fairly rapidly to negotiate (limits on) short-range nuclear forces," he 
said. "I think that would be a mistake for several reasons. . . . We need to 
remind ourselves that the situation on the ground, in Europe, is overwhelming 
Soviet conventional superiority. 
</P>
<P>
"We dealt with that for nearly 40 years by having deployed in Europe tactical 
nuclear weapons, short-range nuclear weapons and that for the foreseeable 
future, certainly as long as there is overwhelming Soviet conventional 
superiority, there's absolutely no rationale at all for us to talk about 
eliminating or significantly reducing those short-range forces," Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls in West Germany indicate that the public there is persuaded that 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will not launch a war in Europe, a view 
that seriously erodes support for NATO as a defense against a Soviet attack. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany won a partial victory last week when NATO defense ministers, 
meeting in Brussels, agreed to postpone until 1991 the decision on whether to 
go ahead with U.S. plans to modernize and increase the range of the Lance 
missiles now stationed in West Germany. In effect, the decision was pushed back 
until after the West German election to avoid political embarrassment to Kohl 
and his political allies. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials were taken aback when Kohl sought to build on his success by 
demanding East-West negotiations that could outlaw short-range nuclear systems 
before agreement is reached on conventional arms. 
</P>
<P>
"Secretary Baker has said on a number of occasions that we should make an 
effort to work this out through negotiations with the Federal Republic and our 
allies before the summit," State Department spokesman Margaret Tutwiler said. 
</P>
<P>
"Secretary Baker has said many times that it would be preferable if we could 
move to modernize our short-range nuclear weapons, although we understand the 
Federal Republic's problem regarding the timing of any such decision," she 
added. "And he has said that we think it would be a mistake to engage in 
negotiations on (short-range nuclear forces)." 
</P>
<P>
Genscher and Stoltenberg left for home shortly after the meeting ended in 
mid-afternoon. According to British newspaper accounts, the two ministers 
canceled a scheduled stop in London for talks with Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher, who could have been expected to underline the message delivered by 
Baker, Cheney and Scowcroft.

GAS KILLED SOME IN SOVIET GEORGIA, PARTY CHIEF SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Communist Party leader in the southern Soviet republic of Georgia said 
Monday that some of the 20 civilians who died this month in a clash between 
nationalist demonstrators and soldiers were victims of a gas used by the 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
Givi G. Gumbaridze, the new first secretary of the Georgian Communist Party, 
told Western journalists in Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, that some of the 
deaths resulted from a stronger, potentially lethal gas used in addition to 
tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
"That gases were used is the truth," Gumbaridze said, "and, yes, some people 
died from poisoning." 
</P>
<P>
Gumbaridze's comments, after two weeks of charges and official denials that a 
kind of nerve gas had been used, were the first clear, high-level 
acknowledgement that troops had used a potentially lethal gas in dispersing a 
nationalist demonstration in Tbilisi on April 9 and that some of the deaths 
resulted directly from it. 
</P>
<P>
But confusion persists over what type of gas was used, what its ingredients 
were, how many died from it and who ordered its use. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still seeking answers to these questions," Gumbaridze told a group of 
Western journalists taken to Tbilisi by the Soviet Foreign Ministry. "There can 
be no justification for the tragedy that occurred. You cannot talk to people 
from a position of force." 
</P>
<P>
Members of a public commission formed by the government to investigate the 
incident said the gas appeared to induce skin rashes, nausea, vomiting, severe 
headache and memory loss. In some victims, the symptoms have persisted for two 
weeks, physicians said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
60 Still Hospitalized 
</P>
<P>
Specialists brought from Moscow and Leningrad had been unable to identify the 
gas, they said, and consequently were struggling to treat 60 gas poisoning 
victims who were still hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Georgian physicians have complained repeatedly that they are handicapped in 
treating the injured because military authorities, perhaps fearing a public 
outcry over the use of chemical weapons against largely peaceful demonstrators, 
have refused to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
Malkhaz M. Zaalishvili, a molecular biologist at the Georgian Academy of 
Sciences and a member of the commission, told the journalists that the gas 
"causes paralysis of the nervous system." 
</P>
<P>
"We do not know its chemical composition," he said, "and (the military 
authorities) have refused to tell us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concentrated Tear Gas 
</P>
<P>
Zaalishvili said that in addition to the poisonous gas, tear gas -- while not 
normally fatal -- also may have been used in much larger concentrations than 
usual, and "in bigger concentrations it becomes very poisonous." 
</P>
<P>
Commission members told the Western journalists, the first permitted into 
Georgia since the incident, that they were writing President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev asking that the military be ordered to identify the chemical agents 
used and to cooperate in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
After repeated denials that anything other than normal tear gas was used, and 
then only sparingly in two places, the Soviet Defense Ministry newspaper Red 
Star quoted a senior officer on Saturday as saying that another chemical 
incapacitating agent, called cheremukha, had been used. 
</P>
<P>
Its main ingredient is chloroacetophenone, the paper said, and Western military 
attaches said it appeared to be similar to tear gas but stronger. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Irakly Menagarishvili, the Georgian health minister, had told the 
government newspaper Izvestia that senior Soviet toxicologists investigating 
the poisoning had found that the chemical substance used had "an irritating and 
atropine-like effect," suggesting that it was a combat weapon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paralysis and Delirium 
</P>
<P>
Atropine is a poisonous crystalline alkaloid that in large doses can induce 
nerve paralysis and delirium and can cause death through combined cardiac and 
respiratory failure. 
</P>
<P>
Other commission members said there was incontrovertible evidence now that the 
troops had beaten and hacked demonstrators with sharpened shovels normally used 
for digging foxholes and trenches. Of the 700 people treated in Tbilisi 
hospitals, many had wounds inflicted by blades, they said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the changing official accounts of the incident, Interior Ministry 
troops and regular army units, supported by tanks and armored cars, moved into 
the square in front of the principal government buildings in Tbilisi before 
dawn on Sunday, April 9, to disperse an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 nationalist 
demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers used staves, shovels and, it has now been confirmed, gas to break 
up the crowd. Nineteen people, most of them women and some as old as 70, were 
killed in the melee, according to official accounts, and one man was shot later 
that day as a curfew violator. Dissidents put the number of dead and missing at 
more than 50. 
</P>
<P>
Although the all-night rally had been peaceful, Georgian authorities explained 
later that they were afraid that those calling for the republic's secession 
from the Soviet Union and the establishment of an independent government might 
storm the government offices. 
</P>
<P>
Georgian nationalists, who noted that the protest was one of a series organized 
by dissident groups in recent weeks and that all have been peaceful, have 
described the action as "an unprovoked attack" and "a heinous crime." 
</P>
<P>
Gumbaridze, 44, elected first secretary to replace Dzhumber I. Patiashvili, who 
accepted responsibility for what is now known as "the tragedy of Tbilisi," said 
that a small group within the Georgian party leadership made the decision 
without consultation to send troops into the square. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a very serious mistake," he said. "Not everyone participated in this 
decision. The law should be enforced, but it should be enforced without 
victims." 
</P>
<P>
Although he headed the KGB, the Soviet security police, in Georgia, Gumbaridze 
said that he knew of the decision to send troops into the square only moments 
before they entered and when it was too late to recall them. 
</P>
<P>
Although Tbilisi is now quiet and tension is diminishing, the situation remains 
difficult, Gumbaridze said. "There was a crisis of confidence in the party, and 
we do not think that crisis is over," he said. "There is still a deficit of 
trust by the people -- this is in no doubt." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the continuing controversy over what happened and fears of a 
cover-up, the 40-member commission said it will also ask Gorbachev to bring the 
International Committee of the Red Cross into the investigation to ensure its 
thoroughness and honesty. 
</P>
<P>
At Gorbachev's urging, the Communist Party's ruling Politburo last week ordered 
a criminal investigation by the central government of the incident to prevent 
any cover-up or appearance of one. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people are now maintaining a 24-hour vigil at the scene of the 
clash, and participants said they will remain for 40 days in keeping with 
Georgian tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives of the dead are standing on the steps of the government headquarters, 
surrounded by wreaths and black-ribboned pictures of the victims. The sidewalk 
is covered with flowers. Along the road, young men hold aloft black flags. At 
night, the whole scene is illuminated by thousands of candles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Victims of Genocide' 
</P>
<P>
In neighboring Armenia on Monday, hundreds of thousands of people commemorated 
the 1915 massacre of Armenians in Turkey as "the victims of genocide" in the 
first such official observance there. 
</P>
<P>
Long lines of men, women and children made their way in processions through 
Yerevan, the Armenian capital, to a hill outside the city to place flowers at a 
monument commemorating the massacre and other tragedies of the Armenian people 
and their nation's rebirth. 
</P>
<P>
But some combined the memorial service with protests against the continued 
detention of 14 leaders of a nationalist Armenian group, the Karabakh 
Committee, and gathered in crowds outside government and party office buildings 
to chant, "Liberation, liberation!"

BUSH TRIBUTE HAILS 'THE MEN BEHIND GUNS' 
</P>

<P>
A day after the stricken battleship Iowa glided silently into its home port, 
the families and shipmates of 47 sailors killed in last week's gun turret 
explosion bade a solemn goodby to the sailors President Bush hailed as "the men 
behind the guns." 
</P>
<P>
In an emotional tribute, President Bush told mourners gathered in a cavernous 
hangar at Norfolk Naval Air Station: "I can only offer the gratitude of a 
nation, for your loved one served his country with distinction and honor. 
</P>
<P>
"We join today in mourning for the 47 who perished, and, in fact, for the 11 
who survived," Bush said. "They all were, in the words of a poet, 'the men 
behind the guns.' 
</P>
<P>
"They came to the Navy as strangers, served the Navy as shipmates and friends, 
and left the Navy as brothers in eternity. In the finest Navy tradition, they 
served proudly on a great battleship, the USS Iowa." 
</P>
<P>
To the 1,453 Iowa crew members who returned from last week's ill-fated gunnery 
exercise, Bush offered a poignant moment of camaraderie and an assurance of a 
full investigation. "I understand your grief," said Bush, a Navy combat flier 
in World War II. "I promise you today, we will find out 'why'. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"But in a larger sense, there will never be answers to the questions that haunt 
us," Bush said. "We will not -- cannot, as long as we live -- know why God has 
called them home." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Console Families 
</P>
<P>
To the mournful strains of the Navy Hymn, the President and his wife, Barbara, 
consoled the families of the fallen seamen, as many in the crowd of 6,000 
inside the hangar and 2,000 outside it hugged and sobbed quietly. The President 
smiled nervously as he shook hands with relatives of victims, moving briskly 
along the rows of folding chairs. 
</P>
<P>
Some showed Bush pictures of their lost ones. "This was our only son, this was 
our only boy," one couple told the President. Several women stopped him for 
comforting hugs. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters later as he flew to Chicago, the President said that he 
found it difficult to console the victims' families. "I did choke up at the 
end," he said, but "I felt I had to represent our country. You've got to deal 
with it, you've got to show them concern. This one was tough." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Advice From Reagan 
</P>
<P>
He said that he had called former President Ronald Reagan to ask for advice 
before he came here. "I asked him, 'How do you do this?' " Bush said. Reagan 
told him, he said, that "you puddle up once in a while." 
</P>
<P>
h Middle Gun Lowered 
</P>
<P>
Monday's memorial came a day after the Iowa had docked at Pier 5, the middle 
gun of the No. 2 turret sagging lower than the two barrels that flanked it. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath its lowered barrel, a basket of flowers and a single cross of 
chrysanthemums lay as a reminder of one of the nation's greatest recent 
peacetime naval disasters. As a naval investigative team, led by Rear Adm. 
Richard D. Milligan, worked to determine the cause of last Wednesday's 
disaster, Navy engineers pondered whether the damaged gun could be repaired, as 
well as whether the 16-inch guns aboard the nation's four battleships can be 
used safely. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy has placed a moratorium on firing the 16-inch guns until the cause of 
the fiery explosion is determined. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iowa crew members wearing black armbands gave their own accounts of 
the accident. Iowa Capt. Fred P. Moosally said that the 47 men killed in the 
blast probably died in the first of three explosions, which rocked the ship 
with what one crew member called "a dull, flat sound -- not the sharp crack of 
a rifle." 
</P>
<P>
Moosally said that the crew of the Iowa's turret No. 2 was the most highly 
trained and best led on the ship. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Testing of Gun 'Normal' 
</P>
<P>
"That was my best crew," he said, adding that when he brought visiting 
dignitaries aboard, he always showed them the turret in which the disaster 
struck. Cmdr. Robert J. Kissinger, the ship's weapons officer, added that a 
90-minute check of the gun's systems had been conducted the morning of the 
disaster. Both the maintenance and the loading of the gun had been "completely 
normal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials here said that the technical state of the gun, as well as the crew's 
adherence to strict procedures for loading and firing it, will be a major focus 
of the Navy investigation. "There was no indication we had problems," Moosally 
said. "That was one of the safest places we could go." 
</P>
<P>
The seaman in charge of turret No. 2 -- 39-year old Reginald O. Ziegler, who 
died in the blast -- was the ship's highest-rated petty officer, Moosally said. 
The ship's skipper added that from the lowest level of the seven-story turret, 
the resounding crack of the Navy's most powerful guns firing from above was 
muffled. 
</P>
<P>
That fact led 21-year-old gunner's mate Kendall L. Truitt, overseeing a crew of 
seven ammunition handlers at the base of the turret, to believe that he had 
heard the turret's first shot when 550 pounds of explosive powder ignited, 
apparently while it was being loaded into the breech of the 16-inch gun. 
</P>
<P>
When Truitt and his men called the compartment above on the radio and got no 
answer, he said, they suspected that something was wrong. It was not until the 
team opened a hatch and felt heat and smelled smoke that they realized what had 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew something was drastically wrong," said Truitt, who was among those who 
crawled through an escape hatch to safety. Clearly shaken by the disaster, 
Truitt, one of 11 who survived inside the turret, said: "Some people, they're 
not over it yet. I'm working on it. But I'll be back in the turret." 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to try to keep the pride going," Moosally said. "Yes, 47 shipmates 
died, but God gave birth to 500 heroes that day," he added, referring to the 
Iowa's firefighting team. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy investigative team rooted through the debris aboard the Iowa Monday. 
Officials acknowledged that they have few eyewitnesses to shed light on the 
cause of the incident. Investigators will rely heavily on crew members' 
recollections of radio communications between the crew of turret No. 2 and the 
rest of the ship, officials said. They added that a videotape of the explosion, 
taken by a crewman, may provide further clues.

FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES FACE U.S. HEALTH SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT STEINBROOK, Times Medical Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The financial difficulties gripping Maxicare Health Plans and some other large 
prepaid health plans are dwarfed by more fundamental challenges facing the 
entire American health care system -- skyrocketing costs and the millions of 
people who have little or no insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Unrelenting economic pressures have greatly narrowed the differences between 
conventional fee-for-service health insurance and health maintenance 
organizations. They have also triggered an intensive search for novel methods 
of delivering medical care. 
</P>
<P>
Most industry officials believe that unrestricted fee-for-service health 
insurance, to which many Americans are accustomed, is dying. 
</P>
<P>
To control costs, fee-for-service plans are adopting cost-cutting tactics 
pioneered by HMOs. These include restricted panels of physicians and hospitals, 
and curbs on hospital admissions and referrals to specialists. 
</P>
<P>
To attract more subscribers, including people who have been reluctant to join 
prepaid health plans, some HMOs are adopting characteristics of fee-for-service 
plans, such as the option to receive care from non-HMO physicians. 
</P>
<P>
But health policy experts warn that patchwork changes may not be enough. In 
large part, this is because the cost and utilization of medical services -- 
particularly services provided outside the hospital -- continue to increase 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
"The system (in the United States) is headed for enormous problems; it is an 
utter failure," said Paul E. Starr, a professor of sociology at Princeton 
University and the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning 1982 book, "The Social 
Transformation of American Medicine." New forms of HMOs and changes in 
conventional fee-for-service health insurance are "having a very small effect 
on the overall picture," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We spend about 11.5% of the gross national product on health care, much more 
than any other country, . . . yet roughly 35 million Americans have no 
financial protection from medical expenses," Alain Enthoven and Richard Kronick 
of Stanford University wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine in January. 
They termed the situation "a paradox of excess and deprivation." 
</P>
<P>
If present trends continue, health care spending will reach 15% of the GNP by 
the year 2000, according to federal projections. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Consensus Apparent 
</P>
<P>
There is little consensus on how to reverse these trends. An important reason 
is that the goal of wider access to affordable care for routine medical 
problems may conflict with demands for increased availability of new services 
and technologies, ranging from organ transplants to genetically engineered 
drugs and sophisticated radiology equipment. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the goal of maximizing consumer choices may conflict with the 
goals of assuring quality and curbing costs. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford's Enthoven, a leading health care economist, said in a recent 
interview that in his opinion, only a small number of organizations "have 
figured out how to do a pretty good job" of organizing medical care for quality 
and economy. 
</P>
<P>
The examples Enthoven cited included the Mayo Clinic of Rochester, Minn., a 
large nonprofit multi-specialty group practice which has opened branches in 
Jacksonville, Fla., and Scottsdale, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
Enthoven also cited large well-established nonprofit HMOs such as Group Health 
Cooperative of Puget Sound in Seattle, the Harvard Community Health Plan in 
Massachusetts, the Henry Ford Health Care Corp. in Detroit, and Kaiser 
Foundation Health Plans. Many independent health policy experts give such plans 
high marks for financial stability and for their commitment to quality medical 
care -- although they caution that the experience of individual patients and 
HMO physicians may vary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Various Paths Debated 
</P>
<P>
Government officials, health insurance industry officials and physicians are 
debating whether to emulate such existing institutions or experiment with novel 
medical care arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of traditional HMOs hark back to the consumer-oriented philosophy of 
the early prepaid group health plans. They argue that the best HMOs already 
provide the sort of quality, cost-effective medical services that are desired 
for the nation as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the active opposition of organized medicine, HMO pioneers such as Drs. 
Donald Ross and H. Clifford Loos in Los Angeles and Dr. Sidney Garfield in the 
Mojave Desert set out in the 1930s to demonstrate that they could practice a 
better style of medicine than their private competitors. 
</P>
<P>
EARLY HMOs 
</P>
<P>
The early plans, such as the Ross-Loos Health Plan and Kaiser Permanente, in 
which Garfield played a key role, were "not set up with the idea of saving 
money but to provide more comprehensive medical care and better financial 
protection for their subscribers," according to Starr. "It just turned out that 
they hospitalized (patients) less and were less costly as a result." 
</P>
<P>
Prepaid group health plans became known as HMOs in the early 1970s, at about 
the time that President Richard M. Nixon advocated them as the centerpiece of a 
"new national health strategy." HMOs combine financing and medical services in 
one organization. Their goal is to change the behavior of patients and 
physicians, and thereby encourage preventive and continuing care while 
discouraging unnecessary appointments, hospitalizations or tests. 
</P>
<P>
In return for prepaid fees, the plans accept responsibility for the delivery of 
needed medical care and medications to their enrollees. Traditional HMOs 
generally have full-time salaried physicians and their own pharmacies; many own 
their hospital and laboratory facilities. 
</P>
<P>
HOW EFFECTIVE? 
</P>
<P>
Over the last decade, numerous research studies have shown that traditional 
HMOs were capable of providing as good care as private physicians. But in 
practice, many HMOs, like many private doctors and hospitals, may not be as 
effective or efficient as they could be. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is pretty much a wash between (traditional) HMOs and the 
fee-for-service system," said Dr. Robert H. Brook of the UCLA Medical Center 
and the Santa Monica-based RAND Corp., a principal author of many of the 
quality-of-care studies. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of traditional HMOs object to the restrictions they may impose on the 
choice of doctors and services. Some patients also object to excessive waits 
for routine but necessary appointments and bureaucratic inefficiencies that are 
characteristic of many large health care organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"The quality of care may be absolutely the same . . . but the satisfaction is 
certainly greater when I feel I have more control in reaching my doctor," Brook 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Public opinion surveys have shown that most people who join HMOs like them, 
according to Robert J. Blendon, chairman of the department of health policy and 
management at the Harvard University School of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
But others, such as many elderly, often want nothing to do with them, primarily 
because of limitations on access. Many non-HMO members say they would rather 
pay more for their health care than be required to join an HMO. 
</P>
<P>
"HMOs are like Volvos," Blendon said. "They appeal to certain people. They have 
all sorts of positive attributes. But most Americans still don't want to drive 
a Volvo." 
</P>
<P>
As of the end of 1988, 32.6 million Americans, including about 18% of those who 
obtained health insurance through their employers and about 2 million Medicare 
beneficiaries, were enrolled in HMOs, according to InterStudy, an HMO research 
organization in Excelsior, Minn., and the Group Health Assn. of America, an HMO 
industry organization in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
While the number of HMO members has doubled since 1984, HMOs have captured more 
than 25% of the health care market in only two states -- California and 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
NEW AND NOVEL FORMS 
</P>
<P>
In addition, many of the recently established HMOs bear little resemblance to 
traditional prepaid health plans. An increasing number are organized as 
profit-making corporations. (Maxicare is the largest among them.) These 
for-profit HMOs enroll about half of all HMO members. 
</P>
<P>
The novel HMOs include loosely organized plans called "networks" or 
"independent practice associations" where most physicians practice in their 
personal offices, and "open-ended" plans that allow enrollees who are willing 
to pay higher charges to see non-HMO physicians. 
</P>
<P>
Patients typically must select a primary care provider, usually an internist, 
family practitioner or pediatrician. This physician acts as a gatekeeper. 
Referrals to surgeons or medical specialists such as allergists, cardiologists 
or neurologists are usually only covered if they are initiated by the primary 
care doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the physicians who participate in these plans continue to see large 
numbers of non-HMO members. They may receive payments based on the number of 
enrollees they are responsible for or bill the plan, as in private practice, on 
a fee-for-service basis. 
</P>
<P>
Some novel HMO-like arrangements are being established by large insurers, such 
as Blue Cross or the Prudential Insurance Co. of America; others by small 
groups of investors who may do little more than rent an office, buy a computer, 
employ a few managers and start signing up physicians and patients. 
</P>
<P>
"The term HMO is losing its meaning," said Dr. Donald M. Berwick, vice 
president for quality of care measurement at the Harvard Community Health Plan. 
"For practically any combination of variables, you can find an organization 
that is giving it a try." 
</P>
<P>
The newer varieties of HMOs have expanded rapidly; they added more than 10 
million members nationwide between 1984 and 1988. "Plans that offer prepaid, 
comprehensive health care are currently overshadowed by plans that resemble 
HMOs, but include more characteristics of insurance plans such as larger 
co-payments, deductibles and co-insurance," according to a 1988 InterStudy 
report. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of such new arrangements say they attract many patients and 
physicians who have been reluctant to join traditional HMOs. For example, some 
organizations may sign up a majority of the physicians in a given area, so that 
many patients who join can continue to see their personal physician. 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, there is little reliable information about whether the newer 
HMOs, on average, provide as good medical care as traditional HMOs or whether 
such flexible, loosely structured organizations can be as successful in 
controlling costs. 
</P>
<P>
There is also little information on whether gatekeeper physicians in the new 
HMOs provide an equal standard of care to their HMO and non-HMO patients. A 
non-HMO patient, for example, may have wider access to specialists or newer 
medical technologies than an HMO patient. 
</P>
<P>
Harold S. Luft of UC San Francisco's Institute for Health Policy Studies 
explained that as the health care marketplace has become more competitive, many 
organizations "have become unwilling to release data that might be sensitive 
and non-complimentary." 
</P>
<P>
Luft, who has studied HMOs extensively, said such data, on issues such as 
waiting times, costs, quality and patient complaints, are precisely the types 
of information that are needed to make valid comparisons between organizations 
or between the care physicians offer to their HMO and non-HMO patients. 
</P>
<P>
THE PROFIT MOTIVE 
</P>
<P>
One widely expressed concern is that many newer HMOs lack the consumer 
commitment on which the older HMOs were founded. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps the greatest menace to the ethical legitimacy of HMOs comes from the 
achievements in reducing the costs of health care delivery," Dr. Gail Povar and 
Jonathan Moreno of the George Washington University School of Medicine wrote in 
the Annals of Internal Medicine last September. 
</P>
<P>
"For-profit enterprises are rapidly entering the HMO industry. . . . One must 
be concerned about the potential for confusion between a form of organization 
that began with an ethic of cost-savings on beneficent ethical grounds and a 
form of organization that saves money to pay dividends." 
</P>
<P>
For example, an HMO physician might limit on economic grounds the diagnostic 
studies and treatment for an elderly patient with cancer. Or an HMO manager 
might insist on arbitrary changes -- such as restricted access to expensive new 
therapies for AIDS, cancer or heart attacks -- designed simply to save money. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a physician in private practice might be more likely to err 
on the side of excess in performing lucrative procedures, such as coronary 
angioplasties, the dilation of blocked heart arteries with a balloon-tipped 
catheter, or gastrointestinal endoscopy, an examination of the stomach and 
small intestine with a fiberoptic tube. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Precautions Suggested 
</P>
<P>
To guard against the abuses to which HMOs seem most prone, the George 
Washington University researchers recommended that prepaid health plans "make a 
specific effort to identify underservice" and "to become particularly 
aggressive in evaluating and promoting the competency of the gatekeeper 
physicians." 
</P>
<P>
Others have suggested that HMO physicians and managers be required to clearly 
inform HMO members of referral restrictions and specific financial incentives 
to limit care, as well as the appeals procedures that are available. 
</P>
<P>
Another option, the open-ended HMO, allows enrollees to choose whether to see 
an HMO physician or, for substantial additional payments, a physician of their 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
As of last June, 48 of the nation's 643 HMOs offered such plans, according to 
an InterStudy report. The majority of the approximately 500,000 enrollees were 
in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area, where the option was first developed. 
Variants of the open-ended HMO are being offered by Kaiser Permanente (in the 
Bakersfield area), CIGNA Healthplans and Prudential. 
</P>
<P>
In theory, open-ended plans conflict with the concept of a prepaid health plan. 
In addition, their ability to control costs and maintain quality is not known. 
But open-ended plans may allow HMOs to attract new members, while preserving 
their traditional structure, according to Roger Feldman, a health economist at 
the University of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
"The experience so far is that not many people use the option (to seek care 
outside of their HMO)," Feldman said. But "it gives people a strong sense of 
security and control to have the option to go down to (the Mayo Clinic)." 
</P>
<P>
A CALL FOR REFORM 
</P>
<P>
Over the next several years, the competition between HMOs and conventional 
insurance plans with HMO features is likely to intensify against the backdrop 
of increasing calls for comprehensive national reform of American health care. 
</P>
<P>
A recent three-nation poll, conducted by Louis Harris &amp; Associates in 
conjunction with the Harvard University School of Public Health, showed that 
only 10% of Americans believe the American health care system works reasonably 
well, while 89% think that fundamental changes are needed. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, respondents in Britain and Canada, nations with much lower per 
capita health care expenditures, expressed substantially less dissatisfaction 
with their health care systems. 
</P>
<P>
For the United States, "nothing short of a comprehensive plan, which includes 
improved technology assessment and malpractice reform. . . is likely to achieve 
the goals of universal access, cost containment, and preservation of quality 
that everyone seems to want," according to a January editorial by Dr. Arnold S. 
Relman, the editor of the New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Berwick, of the Harvard Community Heath Plan, said that increasing frustration 
with the unresolved cost problem "is draining the real inventive resources of 
the health care system." Without far-reaching constructive interventions, he 
predicted that "we really could end up in 10 years with a health care system 
far worse than what we have . . . a cheaper system that is not worthy of us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

MILESTONES IN THE GROWTH OF HMOs 
</P>
<P>
1929: In Los Angeles, Drs. Donald Ross and H. Clifford Loos establish a prepaid 
program to provide medical coverage to employees of the Los Angeles Department 
of Water and Power and their families. 
</P>
<P>
1933: Dr. Sidney Garfield begins to care for construction workers in the Mojave 
Desert on a prepaid basis -- 5 cents per worker per day. 
</P>
<P>
1935: Ross-Loos Clinic, one of the first prepaid group health plans, 
established in Los Angeles. In the 1980s absorbed into CIGNA Healthplans. 
</P>
<P>
1937: Henry J. Kaiser asks Garfield to establish a health insurance program for 
workers and their families at the construction site of the Grand Coulee Dam in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
1940s: Garfield's health care program is offered to Kaiser shipyard workers in 
the San Francisco area. Later it is offered to the community at large, leading 
to the establishment of the Kaiser Foundation Health Plans. 
</P>
<P>
1970: Dr. Paul M. Ellwood Jr., a Minneapolis physician who is one of the 
champions of prepaid group health plans, coins the term health maintenance 
organization, or HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
1971: President Richard M. Nixon endorses HMOs as a new national health 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
1973: Passage of a federal HMO act provides an initial stimulus for growth, 
including seed money, encouragements to employers to offer HMOs and a federal 
qualification process to maintain quality. 
</P>
<P>
1978: Kaiser Foundation Health Plans have 3.5 million enrollees, mostly in 
California, or almost 50% of total HMO enrollment in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
1988: HMO Act amendments update the 1973 HMO law to provide greater flexibility 
in how rates are set and plans structured.

SPEAKER CALLS FOR DEMOCRATIC UNITY IN GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</P>

<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, predicting that Republican Sen. Pete Wilson 
would win the California governor's race if it were held today, called on 
Democratic leaders Monday to return to the days of back-room politics and unite 
behind a single candidate. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party's standard-bearer should be chosen sometime this year -- 
well in advance of the primary election in June, 1990 -- by top Democratic 
officeholders, party officials and labor leaders, among others, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
And the San Francisco Democrat called on Sen. Alan Cranston, California's 
leading Democratic politician, to begin the brokering process by bringing 
together the state's top Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be undemocratic but it sure is a practical way to make sure we have a 
better chance of winning," said Brown, who is visiting Washington this week 
with a delegation of California legislators. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston, however, quickly splashed cold water on Brown's plan. 
</P>
<P>
"As desirable as it would be to have only one major Democratic candidate in the 
primary, I don't foresee it happening," the senator said in a statement issued 
by his office. 
</P>
<P>
Added Cranston spokesman Murray Flander: "He (Cranston) certainly would not 
take the lead as Willie proposes." 
</P>
<P>
Brown's proposal, which he floated to reporters at a luncheon session, 
illustrates the disarray in which the Democratic Party finds itself as it heads 
toward the 1990 elections. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Republicans, who have a proven vote-getter in Wilson, the Democrats 
are divided among three candidates: Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, former San 
Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein and State Controller Gray Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"Our Democratic candidates are not as strong," Brown said. "We're not as 
unified. Pete Wilson has made few mistakes and he is a U.S. senator. Pete 
Wilson at this moment would have to be considered the favorite if you were 
trying to handicap the race." 
</P>
<P>
If all three Democratic candidates remain in the race through the primary, 
Brown said, new fund-raising rules that took effect with the passage of 
Proposition 73 will make it even tougher on the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
That is because the winner of the primary, who presumably would have little 
money left over, would have to raise vast sums between June and November 
without exceeding contributions limits that range from $1,000 to $5,000. By the 
same logic, if Wilson avoids a bruising primary as expected, he can save his 
money and have far more to spend in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
Brown predicted that Wilson would spend as much as $30 million to win the 
governor's race. Last year, Wilson spent more than $15 million to win election 
to a second term in the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly Speaker said he has not decided whom he would support in a 
Democratic primary. "I don't have a candidate for governor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But in all likelihood, his plan to broker the nomination would most help Van de 
Kamp, who is the candidate favored by much of the Democratic political 
Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Speaker's proposal, Democratic leaders such as Cranston, Lt. Gov. Leo 
T. McCarthy, Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), party 
chairman Edmund G. Brown Jr., as well as leaders of such Democratic 
constituencies as organized labor and environmental groups, would attempt to 
select the nominee. 
</P>
<P>
The Speaker also suggested that any candidate who has not managed to raise $2 
million by September should back out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
"Our candidates literally need to have somebody pull together an operation that 
convinces at least two of them to drop out," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston, in his statement, reiterated his proposal that the Democratic 
candidates adhere to a voluntary spending limit in the primary so that they can 
save some of their cash for the general election. 
</P>
<P>
"I share Willie Brown's concern that Democrats be unified and should husband 
their resources for the governor's race against the Republican nominee," 
Cranston said. "It is extremely important that we win in November. . . . But a 
brokered pre-primary is a totally different matter." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Brown's attempt to keep Wilson out of the governor's office, the 
Speaker said the former San Diego mayor would compare favorably to the current 
occupant, Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson would be more flexible than Deukmejian and more in tune with some 
Democratic positions, such as opposing offshore oil drilling, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"He would be far better to get along with, and probably a bit more practical," 
Brown said. "Pete Wilson clearly is not inflexible."

GUN REGISTRATION PROVISION CONCERNS GOVERNOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian said Monday that he is concerned that a gun registration 
provision in legislation to ban assault weapons could subject law-abiding 
Californians to prosecution as felons. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly don't think that a law-abiding citizen who may neglect or choose 
not to register the gun should be found guilty or subject to a felony 
prosecution," Deukmejian said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time he has spelled out why he asked last Wednesday that 
expected final passage of the controversial bill be held up. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after a speech to the San Diego Chamber of Commerce, 
Deukmejian insisted that he has not contracted a case of cold feet and still 
will sign such a bill provided that it is clear and separates military-style 
semiautomatic assault weapons from traditional hunting and sporting firearms. 
</P>
<P>
He asked Senate leader David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), author of the measure, 
to delay a Senate vote so he can study its contents. Roberti agreed. The Senate 
leader says the proposal may come for the expected final vote next week. 
</P>
<P>
In California, registration of firearms historically has been considered 
tantamount to confiscation by many gun owners. Handguns, technically, have been 
registered with the state for years. 
</P>
<P>
The assault gun ban, basically, would outlaw the manufacture, sale and, for the 
most part, civilian possession of about 60 semiautomatic rifles, pistols and 
shotguns effective Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian told reporters Monday that registration of assault weapons by owners 
who obtain them legally by June 1 "is one of the problems." 
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, illegal possession effective next Jan. 1 would be punishable 
either as a misdemeanor with up to one year in jail or as a felony carrying a 
longer sentence in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to register the guns proposed to be outlawed would be considered 
illegal possession. Owners of assault weapons could keep them if they 
registered the firearms with the state Department of Justice by Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said that the legal owner of such a weapon, "someone who has never 
done anything wrong," should not be faced with prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea behind any legislation like this is to get at the criminal and not 
the law-abiding citizen," Deukmejian said. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, who cleared the path for a ban on assault weapons in January two 
days after the slayings of five Stockton schoolchildren by a demented drifter 
armed with an AK-47 assault rifle, said he has other concerns about the two 
nearly identical bills by Roberti and Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
In less specific terms, the governor said he is troubled by provisions of the 
legislation that would seek to outlaw the manufacture of guns that were 
cosmetic imitations of those that would be outlawed. He said these features are 
"subject to some different interpretations." 
</P>
<P>
On a separate subject, Deukmejian told the Chamber of Commerce that if U.S. 
Sen. Pete Wilson wins the 1990 race for governor, he has no plans to seek to 
replace Wilson in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
If Wilson wins the governor's race, he would be empowered to appoint his 
successor in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
But Deukmejian, as he has before, said he has no interest in replacing Wilson 
and added, "My intention now is I'm going to get away from public life and into 
the private sector." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Deukmejian said Armenian-Americans have a "special obligation" to inform 
other Americans of the Armenian genocide that occurred in 1915 when about 1.5 
million Armenians perished at the hands of the Ottoman Turks.

In remarks during a Martyrs Day commemorative ceremony, Deukmejian, the 
nation's foremost officeholder of Armenian ancestry, charged that the continued 
denial of the massacres and the "obliteration of Armenian cultural landmarks 
demonstrates the lengths to which Turkey is willing to go to rid itself of 
anything having to do with the Armenian people." 
</P>
<P>
"As descendants of a people who suffered terrible injustice and also as 
citizens of this great land of liberty, we have a special obligation to inform 
our fellow countrymen of what can happen when freedom is abridged and tyranny 
imposed," Deukmejian said.

HIGH COURT RULES MARCOS HAS NO LEGAL IMMUNITY, PAVING WAY FOR PAIR'S TRIALS

<P>
The Supreme Court said Monday that former Philippines President Ferdinand E. 
Marcos has no legal immunity from prosecution in U.S. courts, clearing the way 
for legal action against Marcos and his wife, Imelda, in Los Angeles and New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
The high court action leaves intact court orders freezing an estimated $1.5 
billion in assets controlled by the ailing Marcos and his wife while two 
massive lawsuits against them proceed. Also, it resolves legal questions over 
whether U.S. courts have the authority to rule on actions taken by foreign 
leaders in their official capacities. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the justices refused to revive an environmentalists' lawsuit seeking 
a ban on the chemical Alar. The high court action, in a jurisdictional dispute, 
leaves the matter where it began: with the Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seek Court Directive 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the National Resources Defense Council and several public interest law 
firms filed suit against the EPA after it dropped a proposal to ban Alar. The 
groups contended that the agency should be compelled to take action because the 
chemical, used to promote ripening and uniform color in apples, had 
demonstrated adverse health effects. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the high court declined to intervene in the dispute (Nader vs. EPA, 
88-1146). But two months ago, the EPA announced that it would move for a 
complete ban on Alar in July, 1990, if new studies confirm that it has 
cancer-causing properties, so the case may well become moot. Several months 
ago, a public awareness campaign launched by the resources defense council 
triggered nationwide concern over Alar, prompting the Los Angeles school 
district and others to briefly ban the sales of apples. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes consumer pressure works a lot faster than government or the courts," 
Albert H. Meyerhoff, a lawyer for the council in San Francisco, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The legal actions on Marcos have been moving through the courts since shortly 
after he was deposed and moved to the United States in February, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wife to Face Trial 
</P>
<P>
U.S. attorneys in New York have charged Marcos and his wife with an array of 
criminal violations, alleging that they stole funds from their homeland and 
invested them secretly in the United States and elsewhere. Although the ailing 
former ruler cannot travel, a trial will proceed against his wife. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, lawyers representing the current Philippines government are 
pursuing a civil case in a federal court in Los Angeles seeking recovery of 
money that was transferred to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Marcos contended that U.S. judges have no authority to "pass 
judgment on the acts of a foreign sovereign" in his handling of foreign funds. 
Citing high court rulings from the 19th Century, they said that it is 
well-established legal doctrine that officials of other nations cannot be 
dragged into a U.S. court to answer for their actions. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel, in a 2-1 vote, agreed. 
However, the full 9th Circuit Court in California decided to reconsider and 
overruled the three-judge panel in December. Judge John Noonan, writing for the 
majority in the 9-2 decision, said that there is no legal doctrine preventing 
former officials from being brought into U.S. courts. Rather, only "practical" 
considerations about U.S. foreign policy must be taken into account. 
</P>
<P>
Without comment or dissent, the justices denied Marcos' appeal of that ruling 
(Marcos vs. Philippines, 88-1431). 
</P>
<P>
In other actions, the court: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Agreed to decide whether a judge as part of a desegregation decree can 
force a school district to double its property taxes to improve its schools 
(Missouri vs. Jenkins, 88-1150). The ruling came in Kansas City, Mo., where 
U.S. District Judge Russell Clark said that the city schools must be upgraded 
to match those of its suburbs. To pay for nearly $300 million in improvements, 
Clark ordered the property tax hike. Lawyers for the state, calling Clark's 
order unprecedented, appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Agreed to decide whether Congress can turn abandoned railroad lines into 
nature trails (Preseault vs. ICC, 88-1076). Owners whose land was bisected by 
abandoned rail lines say that the property should revert to them. A government 
order taking it away without payment violates their constitutional rights, they 
argue. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Refused to overturn a $15-million jury award stemming from the takeover of 
a California manufacturer of semiconductor test equipment (Eaton Corp. vs. the 
PKL Companies, 87-1354). Without comment, the court rejected an appeal by Eaton 
Corp. of Cleveland, which was ordered to pay the money as punitive damages to 
PKL Companies Inc., of New York City. 
</P>
<P>
The case had its origins in the mid-1970s when a company called Cutler-Hammer 
Inc. sought to acquire the stock of Macrodata Corp., which made semiconductor 
test equipment in California.

MAYOR DALEY, THE SON, VOWS HARMONY IN CHICAGO

Richard M. Daley was sworn in as 45th mayor on Monday -- his 47th birthday -- 
and promised he would be a conductor who would orchestrate harmony in the city 
his father led for 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The old ways of doing things simply aren't adequate to cope with the new 
challenges we face," said Daley, whose victory over two black opponents earlier 
this year split the vote sharply along racial lines. 
</P>
<P>
Daley used Orchestra Hall, site of the ceremony, as a theme for his speech. He 
said the patchwork of a city is like a collection of instruments that can make 
beautiful music only when they work together. 
</P>
<P>
"Today I have been handed the conductor's baton, and to the people of Chicago, 
wherever you live, let me assure you that your voices will be heard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Daley was sworn in by Senior U.S. District Judge Abraham Lincoln Marovitz, who 
performed the service for Richard J. Daley six times before the elder Daley 
died in office in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Daley, a Democrat, later received a congratulatory call from 
President Bush, who was here to address the annual meeting of the Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
With Daley in office, Chicago became the largest U.S. city in which voters have 
replaced a black mayor with a white one. 
</P>
<P>
Daley was elected April 4 to serve the last two years of the second term of 
Harold Washington, the city's first black mayor, who died 17 months ago. Daley 
succeeds Eugene Sawyer, the acting mayor named by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Sawyer, who is black, lost to Daley in the Democratic primary Feb. 28. In 
April, Daley easily defeated third-party candidate Timothy Evans, also black, 
and Democrat-turned-Republican Edward R. Vrdolyak. 
</P>
<P>
Daley's father ran a political machine fueled by Democratic patronage, but 
Daley said those days are gone. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't hand down policies from generation to generation," he said, but he 
said he did share with his father "a love for our city and a zest for public 
service." 
</P>
<P>
Daley served three terms in the Illinois Senate and was elected to a third term 
as Cook County state's attorney last year.

15-YEAR-OLD KILLED IN KABUL BY REBEL ROCKETS; 
</P>
<P>
SORROWING AFGHANS BURY 'MARTYR'

KABUL, Afghanistan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They buried Temur Shah on Monday in the Cemetery of Five Hundred Families. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of the 15-year-old boy's neighbors in the suburb of Khai Khanna came 
to the cemetery in tears. They wept for him, they said, and also for relatives 
lost over the years. 
</P>
<P>
And they wept, they said, for their country, which like the boy Shah has been 
ripped to pieces by 10 years of war. 
</P>
<P>
The mourners called Shah the "martyr of the bread lines," because he had spent 
hours each day waiting in long lines for his family's bread ration. He was 
killed Sunday by one of the rockets fired into Kabul by rebel forces. 
</P>
<P>
Bread lines have formed every day for weeks, since the rebel forces, the 
moujahedeen, cut the supply routes into the city. On Sunday, as he has for 
weeks, Shah had waited in line for more than three hours. It was nearly 3 p.m. 
when he finally paid his 30 afghanis -- about 30 cents -- for the family's five 
pieces of nan and started home. 
</P>
<P>
He was a few hundred feet from his destination when the rocket exploded in the 
street. The blast blew out windows in nearby houses and ripped a taxicab to 
shreds. And it killed Temur Shah, a 9th-grade student whose knowledge of the 
war did not go beyond what he heard on the government-controlled radio. 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows why these rockets fall on us?" Mohammed Arif, 14, Shah's friend, 
neighbor and classmate, said Monday as he stood on the spot where Shah had been 
killed. "All I know is that it is the enemy." 
</P>
<P>
The rockets have become a daily occurrence in Kabul. The rebels, supplied by 
the United States, have intensified the pressure on Kabul, the seat of 
President Najibullah's Soviet-supported government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anniversary of Revolution 
</P>
<P>
Thursday will be the 11th anniversary of the start of the leftist revolution 
that brought Najibullah's party to power, and, as a diplomatic source observed, 
"The moujahedeen are trying to spoil the government's party." 
</P>
<P>
But most of the rockets seem to be falling on Khai Khanna, a poor residential 
section of about 450,000 people that consists largely of mud-walled houses. 
Military analysts say it just happens to be situated between the rebel bases 
and their principal target, Kabul's international airport. 
</P>
<P>
The government confirmed Monday that a dozen rockets had fallen on Khai Khanna 
the day before, killing at least 12 people. The rebels, a government spokesman 
said, appeared to be aiming at a power substation but were killing only 
civilians. So far, he said, "they have not hit a single military or economic 
target." 
</P>
<P>
People in Khai Khanna are confused by the rockets. 
</P>
<P>
"Who can tell why these rockets are coming?" a local official, Mohammed Yussef, 
asked a couple of American reporters. He said he is neither pro-government nor 
pro-rebel, adding: "What do we have here in Khai Khanna? We have nothing. You 
can see how we live. You see the hole in my window blown out by this rocket; I 
cannot afford the glass to replace it. You see how cold it is here in my house; 
I have no fuel for heat. I cannot even offer you food, and for an Afghan this 
is a terrible thing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Why Send Us Rockets' 
</P>
<P>
Yussef directed the reporters' attention to a young man standing beside him and 
said: "You see this boy. What does he have that anyone would want? He has one 
less in his family, that is all. This is the brother of Temur Shah. Now tell 
me, please, why does your country send these rockets to us?" 
</P>
<P>
Like most of the people in his neighborhood, Yussef knows that the rockets the 
rebels use were made by China and purchased for the moujahedeen by the United 
States -- part of the $2 billion worth of arms the United States supplied after 
the Soviets sent troops here in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets pulled out the last of their troops two months ago, and Yussef and 
others wonder why the American-supplied rockets are still falling on them. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Russians left here, we were all happy," Yussef said. "I am an Afghan. 
I don't want this kind of help from others. We want our freedom. We are happy 
the Russians have left, but the Americans are still sending us their rockets. 
Why? The great nations of the world should just leave us alone to settle our 
own problems, and we will solve them our way." 
</P>
<P>
Except for his front window, Yussef and his family have been spared by the 
rockets, which have killed scores of people just in Khai Khanna. But he has 
suffered in other ways, he said. He asked his son to pull back a soiled sheet 
covering a wall of his sitting room, and behind it was a collection of musical 
instruments, a sitar, a harmonium and a drum. Yussef explained that he is a 
musician, a player of ghayals, religious songs. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not played these for four years," he said. "I cannot concentrate with 
all the rockets. I cannot even read a book. I have decided that I will not play 
these again until the governments of Russia, America, China, Pakistan and the 
other big countries can hear our music, until they hear our appeal that all we 
want is peace." 
</P>
<P>
Yussef said that when Temur Shah was killed, his mother "said something 
important." He said she had told neighbors: "I want all the mothers of the 
world to know this is what is happening to us. My child is dead, but he is the 
child of all the mothers of the world. And I speak for all those mothers when I 
ask the world to please send us only peace." 
</P>
<P>
But even after they buried Temur Shah, not far from the graves of the rocket's 
other victims, explosions could be heard in other parts of the city. And more 
funerals were being scheduled for today.

BEIJING STUDENTS STAGE RALLIES, SEEK TO SPREAD PROTESTS

<P>
Political activity engulfed a dozen or more university campuses here Monday as 
tens of thousands of students continued to boycott classes and tried to spread 
their pro-democracy protests. 
</P>
<P>
An afternoon rally at Beijing University broke up in disorganization, however, 
after student leaders got into disputes among themselves. In another setback 
for students' hopes, there was no immediate evidence of any major spread of the 
boycott movement to campuses in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
The current wave of demonstrations began a week ago in the form of memorials to 
the reformist Hu Yaobang, former Communist Party head who died of a heart 
attack April 15. 
</P>
<P>
But the protests, which have broken out in at least six cities, have developed 
into a broad drive to pressure the government to speed up political reform. 
Students are demanding freedom of speech and press, higher pay for 
intellectuals, more money for education and an attack on corruption. 
</P>
<P>
The official newspaper People's Daily, in a front-page commentary Monday that 
responded to the protests without describing them, warned that "social turmoil 
can only do good to an extremely small number of people with ulterior motives, 
and do harm to China's modernization." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5,000 Students at Rally 
</P>
<P>
The afternoon rally at Beijing University, which drew about 5,000 students from 
a student body of 15,000, was called primarily to promote the creation of a 
student association free of control by university or Communist Party officials. 
But in less than an hour it degenerated into disputes between student leaders 
over tactics and personalities. 
</P>
<P>
A student organizer named Zhang Zhiyou called for wisdom and restraint in 
making the transition from street demonstrations to a new stage of class 
boycotts. He was immediately accused by other leaders of being tainted by 
previous membership in an officially sponsored student association, and of 
trying to infiltrate the new organizing committee. Other leaders said they had 
expelled Zhang from the committee. 
</P>
<P>
The committee then announced it would hold a Monday evening press conference on 
campus. The event was intended primarily for foreign reporters, as severe 
restrictions prevent the official Chinese media from full reporting of 
demonstrators' activities. But when the time came, a student leader appeared 
and said the conference had been canceled because the committee was not ready. 
He denied the change resulted from pressure from school authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Students sought other methods to spread their protest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Practical Advice on Mailing 
</P>
<P>
A speaker at a Monday morning gathering at Beijing University, which drew about 
1,500 students, urged listeners to write letters spreading word of the boycotts 
and demonstrations throughout China and the world. He issued several practical 
warnings, however, about mailing such letters. 
</P>
<P>
"The post office has great experience in opening mail," he said. "So don't mail 
letters from post offices on or near the campus. Don't write 'Beijing 
University' as the return address. And remember to use the new zip codes." 
</P>
<P>
Qinghua University, Beijing Teachers University and the Beijing Foreign 
Languages Institute were among the other institutions where large percentages 
of students boycotted classes Monday. 
</P>
<P>
At Qinghua University, rallying students applauded Chen Mingyuan, a philosopher 
from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, when he said that the Chinese 
constitution guarantees freedom of speech, press and association and the right 
to demonstrate. 
</P>
<P>
"They (China's leaders) have trampled on the constitution," Chen declared. "We 
are defending it." 
</P>
<P>
Groups of students from Beijing Teachers University solicited contributions 
from pedestrians near their school in an attempt to strengthen their 
organization and broaden their support. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to buy printing equipment, and we want to buy things like medicine for 
students who were injured by the police," said a student holding a white 
cardboard donation box. 
</P>
<P>
Although the police generally showed restraint in confronting demonstrators 
last week, foreign reporters observed a few cases in which protesters were 
manhandled or beaten. Students contend that dozens of people were injured when 
police broke up a pre-dawn protest Thursday outside Communist Party and 
government headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The student holding the donation box said money is not the main point of the 
solicitations. "The point," he said, "is to spread the word, to let the masses 
know what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Chinese print and broadcast media, which are tightly controlled and censored by 
the government and the Communist Party, have imposed a virtual blackout on the 
pro-democracy aspects of the student protests. There has been some mention of 
major demonstrations, but they have been portrayed either as straightforward 
memorials for Hu or as reactionary confrontations with police. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Terse Report 
</P>
<P>
The official New China News Agency covered the student boycotts Monday with a 
terse four-paragraph report that "students at a number of colleges" were 
striking but that "authorities say that teaching and studying at most of the 
city's colleges and universities remained normal." 
</P>
<P>
This report charged that striking students at Beijing University and Beijing 
Teachers University "stopped other students from attending classes" and that 
"at the China University of Political Science and Law, some students were 
prevented by protesters from taking examinations." 
</P>
<P>
After what were reported as fierce internal arguments, the relatively liberal 
Beijing-based Science and Technology Daily came out Sunday with a delayed 
edition that carried many, but not all, of the facts about a massive student 
rally Saturday in Tian An Men Square. It was the first newspaper to carry 
photographs of the rally, which drew at least 60,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Even this article did not make clear the degree to which the rally was a 
pro-democracy protest. But on Monday, students -- who were delighted at even 
moderately objective coverage -- posted copies of the report and photographs on 
walls on and near campuses. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear how the nation's top leaders were reacting to the student 
protests. But an appearance of normalcy has continued. Communist Party General 
Secretary Zhao Ziyang left Beijing by train Sunday and arrived in the North 
Korean capital of Pyongyang on Monday for a long-scheduled official visit.

KREMLIN MEETING TO FOCUS ON REFORMS, AILING ECONOMY

<P>
The Soviet Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee will meet today 
for what could prove to be a major review of its political and economic course 
amid mounting difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the party's general secretary, is expected to 
open the meeting with a speech appraising the country's severe economic 
problems and the resulting loss of confidence in the ability of his reform 
program, known as perestroika, to raise living standards. 
</P>
<P>
Although Gorbachev is receiving sharply conflicting advice in the wide-open 
debate in the Soviet press between the party's conservative and progressive 
wings on what action to take, virtually all commentators are agreed that he 
must take decisive, bold steps now to preserve popular confidence and save the 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev is confronted, on one hand, by rising anger over the shortages of 
food and consumer goods of all sorts and by the insistence of many liberal 
economists, sociologists and political scientists that this problem receive 
priority attention, whatever the cost, to underwrite the whole reform program. 
</P>
<P>
But he is cautioned, on the other hand, by conservatives opposed to a headlong 
plunge into market economics, who see in further liberalization a loss of the 
party's control of Soviet society and who fear that a multi-party system is the 
logical outcome of further political reforms. 
</P>
<P>
However far apart on solutions, the debate has focused attention on a growing 
concern that the country is not being governed, that its components are being 
managed with varying degrees of competency but without a unifying strategy. 
Gorbachev is even implicitly criticized for generally seeking the middle 
course, and he is being told this time that he must be bold. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, who himself has spoken out in the debate several times recently, may 
feel compelled against the background of last month's parliamentary elections 
-- in which scores of senior party officials were defeated by young reformers, 
also party members but not apparatchiks -- to reassert his leadership and to 
restate his vision of the country's future. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov provided no details of the 
agenda in announcing the Central Committee session, except to say that a 
further meeting on ethnic issues is still planned for this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet political observers said they think that the most likely agenda for this 
meeting are the election results, the political and economic background to them 
and a series of decisions to move the country toward fundamental reform and, at 
the same time, to recover some of the lost enthusiasm for perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's opening speech is likely to be followed by one day and possibly two 
of political debate, all behind closed doors, and then the adoption of a series 
of decisions or perhaps simply a communique. 
</P>
<P>
Vadim A. Medvedev, the party secretary for ideology and a member of the ruling 
Politburo, set the tone for the meeting as he reviewed the country's problems 
in a policy speech last week. 
</P>
<P>
Despite four years of reforms, he said, "until now no tangible results in 
meeting the everyday needs of the people have been achieved." 
</P>
<P>
Without going into details, Medvedev suggested that the leadership will seek 
approval for a series of major economic reforms. These would include a 
redefinition of what constitutes property and ownership rights -- a fundamental 
change for Soviet socialism to allow private enterprise -- and the "vigorous 
use" of market forces within what will remain a planned economy. 
</P>
<P>
While most political observers believe that these policy questions will be the 
focus of the meeting, it could also become a forum for high-stakes Kremlin 
politics in another showdown between party liberals and conservatives.

TWO MAINTENANCE WORKERS KILLED IN TUNNEL BLAST AT FORD COMPLEX

Divers located the bodies of two maintenance workers killed Monday when an 
early morning explosion rumbled through the underpinnings of Ford Motor Co.'s 
Rouge complex. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were identified as Billy Stiener, 27, of Redford and John L. Hatch, 
in his early 50s, of Detroit, Ford spokesman John Spelich said. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies were located at 7:30 p.m. Monday in a half-mile-long portion of a 
utility tunnel that carries electric, water, steam and compressed air services 
to several buildings at the 1,100-acre facility. The tunnel, seven to eight 
feet in diameter, was flooded with four to six feet of water after the blast 
apparently ruptured a water pipe, Spelich said. 
</P>
<P>
"For the moment, our No. 1 priority is to find out what caused the accident," 
said Alexander J. Trotman, who will become executive vice president for Ford's 
North American operations on May 1. 
</P>
<P>
The blast tore holes in parking lots, flipped cars, blew windows from a 
three-story power substation and forced the company to shut down a number of 
operations, including the Mustang automobile assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
John Schultz, a driver for a bus company Ford contracts to carry people around 
the huge complex, said he saw "flames shooting 300 to 500 feet into the air for 
a short period of time" shortly after the 6:20 a.m. blast. 
</P>
<P>
Spelich said the two victims were employed by Doetsch Industrial Services Inc. 
of Detroit. A woman answering the Doetsch telephone, who refused to give her 
name, said the company has done maintenance work at the Rouge complex for 
years.

1988 LEGISLATIVE RACES: $40.4-MILLION SPENDING SPREE 
</P>

<P>
Candidates for the state Legislature spent $40.45 million during last year's 
general election cycle, almost a 26% increase over the 1986 general election 
figure, the Fair Political Practices Commission reported on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The FPPC report showed Assembly candidates in 80 races raised $24.71 million 
and spent $30.33 million. Senate candidates vying for 20 upper house seats 
raised $8.38 million and spent $9.88 million. As these figures suggest, many 
candidates must continue fund-raising after election day to pay off sizable 
campaign debts. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Cecil N. Green (D-Norwalk) and Republican Don Knabe, a former Cerritos 
city councilman and chief of staff for Los Angeles County Supervisor Deane 
Dana, waged the most expensive fall campaign, spending a total of $2.35 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The incumbent successfully defended a Senate seat that he won in an expensive 
special election only a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) reported spending 
$1.9 million, most it to help other Democrats get elected. Roberti gave Green 
$600,000. 
</P>
<P>
On the Assembly side, the most expensive race was the $1.85-million contest 
between Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg (D-Sacramento) and losing Republican 
challenger Larry Bowler, a Sacramento County sheriff's lieutenant. 
</P>
<P>
Next in line was a $1.81-million campaign between Republican Curt Pringle, a 
Garden Grove planning commissioner, and Democrat Christian F. (Rick) Thierbach, 
a Riverside County prosecutor who lives in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle won the contest to replace the late Assemblyman Richard Longshore 
(R-Anaheim), who died the day after he won the GOP primary nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) reported spending $2.74 
million, but he also transferred most of his money to other Democratic 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 73, a campaign financing initiative approved by the voters last 
year, prohibits the transfer of funds by legislative leaders to their 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
It also limits contributions by individuals and businesses to $1,000 each 
fiscal year, political action committees with two or members to $2,500, and 
broad-based political action committees that have been in existence for more 
than six months and have 100 or more members to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Senate leader Roberti and Speaker Brown have filed lawsuits contending that 
Proposition 73 is unconstitutional.

A Swiss pilot landed his helium-filled balloon Monday outside a small town in 
Montana to become the apparent winner of the Gordon Bennett distance race. 
</P>
<P>
Karl Spenger of Switzerland and his son-in-law and co-pilot, Ronald Schuler, 
safely touched down in their balloon, Jura, at 1:45 p.m., a mile west of 
Ashland in southeastern Montana, about 40 miles north of the Wyoming state 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Townspeople welcomed the crew, which had to attend to their balloon themselves 
because they brought no support crew with them. 
</P>
<P>
Race officials were calculating how far the Jura traveled from Palm Springs 
before declaring Spenger the winner. The landing site was about 800 miles 
northeast of Palm Springs.

<P>
Caroline Coleman, board president of the Inglewood Unified School District, 
died Saturday at her home in Inglewood after what her family said was a long 
illness. She was 51. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Coleman, who was also a county probation officer, was appointed to the 
Inglewood school board in 1979 and won election to the board twice. At the time 
of her death, she was seeking a third term and had won 44% of the vote in a 
primary election April 4. She was facing a runoff election in June. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, she won dismissal in Superior Court of embezzlement charges brought in 
connection with expense accounts filed as a school board member. Born in 
Cleveland and educated at Findlay College in Ohio and Chapman College in Los 
Angeles, Mrs. Coleman was active in Inglewood politics and was a member of the 
Inglewood Democratic Club. 
</P>
<P>
She leaves three children, Dean, Lisa and Keely. Funeral services were

PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR HIRED IN LONG BEACH POLICE PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A private investigator has been hired to check out allegations of misconduct in 
the Long Beach Police Department, city officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell said the investigation involved employees "pretty 
high up" in the department, but he would not name them or say what actions are 
under review. The investigator, Leslie (Pete) Norregard of Irvine, will report 
directly to City Manager James C. Hankla, according to a Police Department 
memo. 
</P>
<P>
One police officer who confirmed that he was interviewed by Norregard said he 
was asked whether Deputy Chief David Dusenbury was involved in any misconduct, 
including an incident three years ago in which Dusenbury allegedly hired as his 
secretary a woman with misdemeanor arrest record of prostitution and petty 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
The officer, Jack O'Neil Jr., said he was asked similar questions in December 
by a deputy police chief who oversees the department's internal affairs 
section. 
</P>
<P>
Dusenbury, who once headed the department's vice squad and had a reputation for 
being tough on prostitution, refused to comment. He referred questions to 
Police Chief Lawrence L. Binkley, who also said he could not to comment. 
</P>
<P>
One former police official, retired Deputy Chief William Stovall, said Monday 
that he raised questions about Dusenbury's choice of a secretary with 
then-Chief Charles B. Ussery. Dusenbury told him he knew of the woman's 
criminal past and promised to fire her if she got in trouble again, Stovall 
said. But Stovall said he was worried because the woman had access to police 
computer records. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary worked for the police force for only a month, Stovall said. He 
did not know why she left. 
</P>
<P>
Before he retired in August, 1987, Stovall said, he also told the new Police 
Chief Binkley about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
The current investigation was disclosed recently in a memorandum to the city's 
650 police officers. In it, Binkley asked that all department employees 
cooperate with Norregard in an inquiry that is "being conducted under and 
directly for" Hankla. 
</P>
<P>
Kell said the hiring of a private detective was unusual but may become more 
commonplace to lend credibility to investigations of alleged police misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't worked too well having the police investigate the police," the mayor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Three plans to create a police review board or have an independent investigator 
are being reviewed by the Long Beach City Council. The proposals are an 
outgrowth of the Jan. 14 confrontation between a white Long Beach police 
officer and Don Jackson, a black Hawthorne police sergeant who conducted a 
secretly videotaped "sting" in the city to demonstrate what he said was racism 
and brutality by police there. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was arrested after a traffic stop, but the case against him was dropped 
and the officer himself charged for allegedly using excessive force and filing 
a false police report.

KARAJAN RESIGNS BERLIN PHILHARMONIC POST; 
</P>
<P>
81-YEAR-OLD 'CONDUCTOR FOR LIFE' OF RENOWNED ORCHESTRA CITES ILL HEALTH

<P>
Herbert von Karajan, the colorful and controversial conductor, stepped down 
Monday as director of the celebrated Berlin Philharmonic, which many consider 
the world's best. 
</P>
<P>
Karajan, an 81-year-old autocratic Austrian, handed a letter of resignation to 
the West Berlin senator for cultural affairs in Salzburg, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
The senator, Anke Martiny, said that Karajan referred in his letter to his 
increasing spinal disability, declaring: 
</P>
<P>
"The results of the medical examinations I have been undergoing for several 
weeks indicate that I am not in the position to fulfill my duties as I 
understand them." 
</P>
<P>
The German music world has been expecting Karajan's retirement after 34 years 
with the Berlin orchestra, partly because of his health problems -- he has had 
a stroke and three spinal operations and must be helped to the podium -- and 
partly because of a dispute with the Philharmonic management. 
</P>
<P>
West Berlin officials reportedly told Karajan in March that he had violated his 
contract by refusing to give more than six concerts a year in the city, while 
appearing abroad with other orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, he has often appeared with the rival Vienna Philharmonic, which 
he directed in New York's Carnegie Hall in February, leading the New York Times 
to comment: "This was a concert that one will tell the grandchildren about." 
</P>
<P>
But, as the Berlin Philharmonic's conductor-for-life, Karajan has insisted that 
he could not be fired. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as my arm can hold a baton, you won't get rid of me," he has said. "As 
long as I live, there won't be talk about a new chief conductor." 
</P>
<P>
More recently, he put it: "Discussions about my successor can begin the day 
after my death." 
</P>
<P>
In West Berlin, the new left-wing coalition government said that a search for a 
successor was under way. Among those mentioned as possibilities were James 
Levine, music director of the Metropolitan Opera in New York; Bernard Haitink, 
music director of the Royal Opera, Covent Garden, in Britain; Riccardo Muti, 
music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra and the Teatro alla Scala in 
Milan, Italy; and Simon Rattle, the British conductor of the City of Birmingham 
Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Karajan's favorites are said to be Seiji Ozawa of Japan and Semyon 
Bychkov of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Whoever replaces Karajan will conduct concerts in Philharmonic Hall, an 
auditorium specially designed to the maestro's specifications, with the 
orchestra surrounded by the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Karajan left the board of directors of the Salzburg Music Festival in August, 
and he has reduced his commitments there and elsewhere. On New Year's Day, he 
decided not to make his annual appearance playing light Viennese music with the 
Vienna Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
Karajan was supposed to conduct the Philharmonic in West Berlin on May 8 and 9 
and play in East Berlin for the first time on May 30. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Berlin system, the 121 members of the orchestra will, at least in 
theory, freely elect a new conductor. 
</P>
<P>
During this year's argument with the new West Berlin government, the members of 
the orchestra found themselves divided: Most believed that Karajan should give 
more performances with them, but nevertheless all have benefited financially 
from the large number of records they made under his tutelage. More than 900 
recordings bear Karajan's name. 
</P>
<P>
As one member put it: "Rehearsals for our concerts were actually well-paid 
recording sessions -- it was a wonderful life." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Salzburg on April 5, 1908, Karajan had a meteoric career as a musician, 
but he was to admit that, during the Hitler era, he had joined the Nazi Party 
to retain his conducting posts. 
</P>
<P>
After the war, the Allies barred Karajan from conducting for two years, but he 
quickly became one of the world's premier conductors and succeeded Wilhelm 
Furtwangler at the Berlin Philharmonic in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
He was well-known for developing proteges, like German violinist Anne-Sophie 
Mutter, whom he first presented at the age of 13. 
</P>
<P>
His imperious style, however, resulted in a near-strike by the Berlin 
Philharmonic when Karajan insisted that another female protegee, Sabine Meyer, 
be made first clarinetist over the objections of the orchestra. In the end, the 
players won out. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to a busy schedule of worldwide appearances, Karajan was an active 
sportsman and a major European celebrity -- the subject of hundreds of 
articles, pictured on the ski slopes and in his yacht and plane and on his 
motorcycle, as well as on the podium. 
</P>
<P>
He and his French wife, Eliette, have two daughters.

WHO PROMISES TO TURN DOWN THE VOLUME ON REUNION TOUR 
</P>

<P>
The three surviving members of the legendary Who said Monday they're reuniting 
this summer for a 25-city, 25th anniversary North American tour -- one that 
could feature kinder, gentler-to-the-ears rock concerts. 
</P>
<P>
The reason: ear damage to Who guitarist Peter Townshend caused by years of 
loud, explosive, high-decibel rock that made the Who what some critics call one 
of the half-dozen most influential bands in rock history. 
</P>
<P>
The concern is how to perform "without creating further damage to my hearing," 
Townshend told a Radio City Music Hall news conference attended by about 70 
reporters and photographers and seven TV news crews. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll manage somehow," he added, then joked: "We'll play very, very, 
very quietly." 
</P>
<P>
The tour, which opens June 24 in Toronto, is to play Jack Murphy Stadium in San 
Diego on Aug. 22, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Aug. 26, and close in 
Oakland Coliseum Stadium on Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing with singer Roger Daltrey and bassist John Entwistle, Townshend spoke 
bluntly, almost wistfully, about his problem during the kickoff of the latest 
instance of British lords of middle-aged rock again preparing to go forth and 
boogie. 
</P>
<P>
The Rolling Stones, who like the Who now are in their 40s, also are due to 
start a North American tour, possibly around Labor Day, with a guarantee 
reported at between $65 million and $70 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Who, which broke up after its last tour in 1982, but got together for the 
"Live Aid" concert in England in 1985, will have drummer Simon Phillips on the 
tour, succeeding Kenney Jones, who had joined the band after the death of 
drummer Keith Moon in 1978. The group also will include keyboardist John 
Bundrick, horns, percussion and three back-up singers. 
</P>
<P>
The tour is expected to gross about $35 million before expenses and promoters' 
fees, according to a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Townshend called the tour a special-occasion-only "25th birthday party" that 
will play three Canadian and 22 U.S. cities, all in outdoor stadiums, with an 
average ticket price, the spokesman said, of $22.50. 
</P>
<P>
It also will play, for charities for children and young people, two full 
performances of its rock opera, "Tommy." The first set for June 27 at Radio 
City Music Hall, the second for Los Angeles late in the tour. No Los Angeles 
location has been set, but sources said chances are it will be the 6,600-seat 
Universal Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the coming Stones trip, which will follow the release of a new album, no 
album has been recorded to coincide with the Who tour. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't trying to resurrect the band," Daltrey, at 45 the oldest Who, told 
reporters at the 35-minute news conference, aired live by the Westwood One 
radio network. 
</P>
<P>
One reason the band stopped touring, he said, is that it tired of the 
"tour-album-tour rat race." 
</P>
<P>
The band is doing this tour, he said, only as a 25th-anniversary "celebration 
of the music, and an album might come and might not . . . if we do it, we'll do 
it because it's fun." 
</P>
<P>
Townshend, 43, a rock-guitar virtuoso whose early years in the band including 
smashing his guitars to signal a concert's finale, has publicly spoken before 
of his rock-damaged hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The matter arose again Monday when he was asked if there will be a second 
guitarist playing with the Who on this tour. Yes, he said, but didn't identify 
the musician. 
</P>
<P>
Then, sounding what seemed a cautionary note, he said that his own hearing 
problem is diagnosed as tinnitus, a ringing in the ears and pain when exposed 
to loud music. He wryly noted that many young rockers like to listen to rock 
through their earphones, drink whiskey and play loud guitar. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I liked to do, and I've shot my hearing," he said, joking that on 
the tour he's "going to play a bit like John Denver." 
</P>
<P>
Later, when asked if he'd been reluctant to do the tour, he said no, that in 
fact he'd been the prime mover of it, but "the problem has been the worry about 
the hearing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"You have to realize that I'm somebody who's actually disabled. I've actually 
disabled myself doing my job."

children from 11 Los Angeles-area school districts is being shipped to Beijing 
for an exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (Chinese children who see the exhibit) are gonna say 'oooh' and then 
'I want to draw one of those,' " said 8-year-old Christine Tate, whose 
self-portrait is part of the exhibit of art from programs developed by the 
Getty Institute for Educators on the Visual Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The Getty-developed programs -- called discipline-based art education -- aim to 
establish art as a regular course of study in elementary schools, and to place 
emphasis on sequential activities that enable students to develop their 
abilities for making art, examining art and reading and talking about art. The 
program, which is taught in 21 area school districts (in kindergarten through 
secondary school classrooms) centers around aesthetics, art criticism, art 
history and art production. The Getty Institute holds staff development 
programs to train both teachers and administrators in discipline-based art 
education, and provides set curricula to help school districts establish the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"Discipline-based art education has changed the look of our school and the look 
of our classrooms," said Bev Pyott, a fifth-grade teacher at Torrance's Anza 
School, during a weekend reception for the student artists and their parents 
and teachers. "But the production part, having them put the concepts to work, 
is just a small part." 
</P>
<P>
The teachers and administrators interviewed at the reception had nothing but 
praise for the Getty-developed programs, and they aren't the only ones to laud 
it. In fact, the collection was formed because of the enthusiasm of a visiting 
high school art teacher from Beijing, Hou Ling, who suggested that such an 
exhibition would help Chinese art educators learn more about the theory and 
practices of discipline-based art education programs in American schools. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea (of putting together an exhibition to be sent to China) was to share 
not only the imagery, but the students' philosophy behind this way of 
teaching," said Steven Mark Dobbs, senior program officer for the Getty, who 
has been negotiating with Ling on the logistics of the exhibition since the 
summer of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations and preparations now nearing completion have been a lengthy 
process, Dobbs said, because language barriers force all correspondence between 
himself and Ling to be translated from one language to another, and because the 
Chinese government has several agencies that must give their approval before 
the exhibit can be sent to China. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Dobbs said, the Getty Institute has had no confirmation on where 
the artworks will be displayed once they reach Beijing. Dobbs added, however, 
that the exhibition is being sent as a permanent gift to the Chinese, and the 
Getty hopes that "once it reaches China, it will be circulated widely by the 
Ministry of Culture." 
</P>
<P>
"We have no confirmation of the exhibit even going elsewhere," Dobbs said, "but 
my feeling is that it will. . . . We hope that it will become a resource for 
Chinese educators to learn from." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition consists of 27 pieces of student art work (including adept 
attempts at impressionism, pointillism, and abstractionism; life-like 
renditions of lobsters, birds and other forms of animal life; fairly 
sophisticated landscapes and seascapes and collages, and several 
self-portraits), samples of writing by students about the art they have 
studied, and calligraphic explanations (in both Chinese and English) about the 
philosophy of discipline-based art education. The student artists range in age 
from 5 to 13. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the youngsters at the reception could manage only shy nods when asked 
about the exhibition and their drawings. But their teachers and parents were 
more than happy to talk about the excitement of the exhibit and the 
Getty-developed art program. 
</P>
<P>
"We're so thrilled about this," said Alicia Larson, the mother of 7-year-old 
abstractionist Ronnie. "And (in the program) they take the time for individual 
little things like field trips to museums -- Ronnie (an ardent fan of the 
"Pinkie" and "Blue Boy" paintings) had never been before." 
</P>
<P>
Said Mary Norton, the mother of 9-year-old Jennie (who rendered a monkey in the 
style of Georges Seurat): "I'm excited about this whole concept and the concept 
of this exchange. We don't usually do things like this -- it's usually done on 
an adult level." 
</P>
<P>
The Getty is hoping that the exhibition will do more than just provide them 
with an opportunity to show off the results of their program. "In China the 
philosophy and emphasis of art education is to encounter discipline . . . and 
mastery," Dobbs said. "There really is more at stake (with sending this 
exhibition) than just looking at pretty and naive images that kids have drawn 
on the other side of the Pacific. There's an opportunity for penetration of 
intercultural (philosophies)." 
</P>
<P>
But to 12-year-old Antonio Uzeta, an aspiring animation artist for Walt Disney 
whose collage of a fish is being sent in the collection, the exhibition has a 
much simpler meaning. "It will be real neat for everyone to see it up there (in 
China) -- to see what we do here," he said.

South Korean riot police fired tear gas Monday to disperse thousands of workers 
who took to the streets of the southeastern city of Masan after an 
anti-government rally, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters were among more than 10,000 workers who crowded a plaza in the 
city to demand higher wages and an end to what they called government 
repression of labor. 
</P>
<P>
In nearby Changwon, about 2,000 strikers from consumer electronics giant 
Goldstar, some of them rolling gasoline-filled drums, marched in the streets 
but were dispersed by riot police firing tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials say the export-led South Korean economy faces a crisis 
because of labor disputes. Stoppages affected 322 companies in the first three 
months of 1989, at a cost of $2.37 billion in lost production and $642 million 
in exports, according to Trade Ministry figures.

About 300,000 dockworkers returned to work Monday at India's 10 major ports 
after a successful six-day strike for higher wages, union leaders said. The 
strike had cut India's imports to a trickle and virtually paralyzed exports. A 
five-year wage accord between five dockworkers' unions and the government 
provides for increases ranging from $20 to $53 a month, effective next Jan. 1.

TWO WORKERS MISSING AFTER BLAST RIPS SUBSTATION IN FORD COMPLEX

Divers were searching through piles of debris and water-filled tunnels Monday 
for two maintenance workers missing after a massive explosion rocked a power 
substation at Ford Motor Co.'s Rouge complex. 
</P>
<P>
The underground blast ripped holes in two employee parking lots and temporarily 
shut down much of the facility. Thousands of afternoon and night shift workers 
were told not to report for their shifts. 
</P>
<P>
The two missing workers, employed by Doetsch Industrial Services Co. of 
Detroit, were working in the immediate area of the blast. 
</P>
<P>
Two other people in one parking lot were slightly injured in the blast, Ford 
spokesman Bill Carroll said. They were treated at a hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
"For the moment, our No. 1 priority is to find out what caused the accident and 
to locate the two missing people," said Alexander J. Trotman, who will become 
executive vice president for Ford's North American operations on May 1. 
</P>
<P>
The substation supplies steam power and compressed air to the massive complex, 
which produces steel, glass and stampings for the nation's No. 2 auto maker. 
</P>
<P>
Trotman said the divers were looking for the missing men in seven- to 
eight-foot-high tunnels connecting two power substations. Crews were attempting 
to pump four to six feet of water from the tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
Asbestos pipe wrapping was blown into the area during the explosion, Trotman 
said. Ford crews watered down the entire area to minimize exposure to the 
cancer-causing substance, he said.

Twenty years after ROTC was pressured to leave the Harvard University campus, 
the student council has voted to bring it back. 
</P>
<P>
In a 41-24 vote Sunday, the Undergraduate Council asked the university to 
negotiate with the military to bring back Reserve Officers' Training Corps 
programs. In 1969, the university withdrew academic credit for ROTC, an edict 
that followed a student strike that paralyzed the school.

BOYFRIEND ARRESTED AS AN ACCOMPLICE IN DENISE DUERR DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU and LUCILLE RENWICK, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Clyde Spontak wept openly last week as he talked with police 
investigators and reporters about the brutal killing of his girlfriend, Denise 
Marie Duerr of Garden Grove -- "the sweetest woman that ever lived." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the 22-year-old Garden Grove man sat in the Riverside County Jail, 
accused of acting in concert with a high school friend to stab the 21-year-old 
Duerr 20 times, then dump her partially clad body in the hills near Corona. 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, authorities arrested Cameron Seaholm, a 22-year-old transient 
who went to high school with both Spontak and Duerr, in connection with the 
killing after he was discovered driving Duerr's car. At the time, Spontak 
lamented the death of his live-in girlfriend and angrily sought to understand 
what had motivated the actions of his friend Seaholm. 
</P>
<P>
But investigators say they never believed the boyfriend's display of grief and 
kept an eye on him from the outset as a suspect in Duerr's killing. 
</P>
<P>
"He just seemed patently unconvincing," Riverside Deputy Dist. Atty. Daniel C. 
Lough said of Spontak, who was arrested on suspicion of murder 
</P>
<P>
early Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday evening, armed with a search warrant, Garden Grove police and 
Riverside County sheriff's deputies went to the Garden Grove apartment that 
Spontak had shared with Duerr, interrupting a neighborhood barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
For the next 6 hours, they combed through the apartment and recovered evidence 
that investigators allege links Spontak to the crime, Lough said. He refused to 
discuss the evidence seized. 
</P>
<P>
During the search, Spontak sat calmly on a sofa as more than a dozen law 
enforcement officers scoured the apartment, an open bottle of champagne and 
newspaper stories about the murder in view, Lough said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just waiting it out until the moment we arrested him (about 3:30 a.m. 
Sunday)," said Lt. Nick Padilla of the Riverside Sheriff's Department. "Then he 
became very emotional for a minute, then suddenly regained his composure." 
</P>
<P>
Police handcuffed Spontak and led him outside in the view of shocked neighbors, 
many of whom had tried to comfort him. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said that as soon as Duerr's partially clothed body was found 
last Wednesday in a brush-covered area just off the Riverside Freeway at the 
edge of the Santa Ana Mountains, they focused on Spontak's possible role in the 
killing for a variety of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
They cited apparent contradictions in his whereabouts in the hours leading up 
to Duerr's disappearance last Monday, his rocky and sometimes violent 6-year 
relationship with Duerr, and the fact that he may have been the last person to 
see Duerr before she disappeared last week. 
</P>
<P>
"It all just made you very, very suspicious," Padilla said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Lot Left to Figure Out' 
</P>
<P>
Investigators say they have still not determined a motive for the slaying, 
where she was killed, or the actual murderer. "We still have a lot left to 
figure out on this one," Lough said. 
</P>
<P>
But law enforcement officials alleged Monday that they have enough evidence to 
show that Spontak acted in concert with Seaholm to carry out the crime. 
</P>
<P>
Spontak's arrest shocked neighbors at his Garden Grove apartment complex, and 
even the victim's mother reacted with disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
Duerr's mother, Mary Ellen Ducharme, said: "I have a hard time believing that 
he did it, unless it was an accident. . . . They had a stormy 6-year 
relationship on and off, but this time, when Denise went back to live with 
(Spontak), it was different. He treated her well and they didn't fight at all." 
</P>
<P>
Ducharme said that Spontak and Duerr had problems in the past and that Spontak 
occasionally hit the young woman, an assertion confirmed by police 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
"He was extremely jealous of her. He didn't want her wearing short skirts and 
wanted her to call him whenever she went somewhere. But she promised me that he 
had changed and I think he did," her mother said. 
</P>
<P>
Ducharme said that Spontak called her after his arrest and "swore to me on the 
telephone that he had nothing to do with it and would never hurt her." 
</P>
<P>
Spontak is scheduled to be arraigned on murder charges Wednesday in Riverside 
County, law enforcement officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seahold in Court 
</P>
<P>
Seaholm, who police allege was Spontak's accomplice, appeared briefly Monday in 
Corona Municipal Court, but his arraignment was postponed until next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
During parts of the proceeding, he appeared exasperated and shook his head as 
he sat in custody in the jury box. But at other times, he flashed a brief smile 
toward his mother, estranged wife and family friends in the courtroom audience. 
</P>
<P>
Seaholm's family and his Santa Ana defense attorney maintained his innocence 
Monday, and pointed to Spontak's arrest as affirmation that Seaholm did not 
kill Duerr. 
</P>
<P>
"We know he's innocent," said his mother, Joanne Sandor of Santa Ana. While 
declining to discuss specifics of the case against her son, Sandor said: "She 
just was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Unfortunately, Clyde (Spontak) 
is a friend of his." 
</P>
<P>
Seaholm's defense attorney, Gary L. Proctor, said that Spontak's arrest should 
show that his client was not involved in the murder. 
</P>
<P>
Proctor acknowledged that Seaholm took Duerr's car without permission, but he 
said that his client did not realize that the young woman's body was in the 
car's trunk. He added that he is hopeful that laboratory tests will conclude 
that stains found on Seaholm's clothing were not, in fact, the victim's blood. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators already have confirmed that Duerr died as a result of 20 stab 
wounds to the upper body. A full autopsy report is not expected for several 
weeks, but prosecutor Lough said Monday that "certainly the torn state of her 
clothing would suggest a sexual attack."

YAROSLAVSKY CALLS BRADLEY'S BUDGET OUTLINE A TAX DRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Blasting Mayor Tom Bradley's record $3.2-billion budget proposal as a "a 
bureaucrat's budget" that will lead to new taxes, Los Angeles City Councilman 
Zev Yaroslavsky opened the annual hearings on the city's finances Monday with a 
vow to fight any new fees. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky, chairman of the council's Finance and Revenue Committee and 
one-time mayoral aspirant, said the mayor's spending plan would add 1,500 
employees but, except for 500 more police officers, would not increase 
services. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of what's in this budget . . . doesn't mean a hell of a lot to me as a 
citizen," Yaroslavsky said. "One has to ask himself the question, where does 
all this money go?" 
</P>
<P>
In addition to signaling rougher-than-usual sledding ahead for the mayor's 
budget, Yaroslavsky's comments were yet another sign that the council may be 
increasingly willing to challenge a weakened mayor. Earlier this year, council 
President John Ferraro announced his plan to retool committees to give the 
council more latitude to take on such issues as housing and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the 15 council members have taken Bradley's slim victory in the primary 
election earlier this month, with a surprisingly low 52% of the votes cast, as 
a sign that the mayor no longer has the mandate he once enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
If Monday's Finance Committee meeting is any indication, a major sticking point 
in getting the required council approval for the 1989-90 city spending plan 
will be Bradley's proposal to begin a $33-million trash recycling program for 
which he has not made any financing provision. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which could begin in July, is an attempt to deal with the city's 
worsening landfill crisis, and City Council members are generally in agreement 
that it must be adopted. 
</P>
<P>
"At least he should present some credible options for paying" for the recycling 
program, Yaroslavsky said. "He is leaving us with no choice but to . . . lay 
people off or adopt a recycling fee." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Bradley, who is on a trade mission in the Far East, said the 
mayor will have no comment on the daily council debate on the budget. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Bradley directed Board of Public Works President Ed Avila and City 
Administrative Officer Keith Comrie to head a committee to suggest ways to pay 
for the recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Richard Alatorre, another Finance Committee member, said: "We'll 
have to see the options and make the difficult decisions." 
</P>
<P>
He said it is "repugnant to even think of" a recycling fee but added that it 
may be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates by Bradley's office place the possible trash recycling fee at about 
$43 a year per household. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said he prefers to have the recycling program paid for out of 
general city revenues so that it will get close council scrutiny each year. But 
that would mean cuts in other programs. 
</P>
<P>
The rhetoric became heated at times in the hearing. At one point, Yaroslavsky 
called the budget proposal a "spending orgy." 
</P>
<P>
He pointed to staff increases, such as 10 new positions in the mayor's office, 
as not directly adding to the level of service provided to the taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a 16% increase. Where's the justification. . . ? This book is riddled 
with examples like this," said Yaroslavsky, pointing to the 793-page budget 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky directed Comrie to prepare a report comparing staffing and service 
from each city department in 1978 to the current levels and to compare Los 
Angeles staffing and service with that of surrounding cities. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky also said he is concerned with some rosy city revenue estimates. 
With a relatively strong economy, economists and the city administrative 
officer have projected increases in city revenues of 7.5% to 10% for the fiscal 
year 1989-1990 that begins on July 1. Bradley's proposal assumes that the 
highest estimated revenues will all be spent. 
</P>
<P>
One estimate in particular that Yaroslavsky questioned was parking ticket 
revenues. The city transportation agency has estimated that it will raise $101 
million in fines in the coming fiscal year, while acknowledging that it has 
already missed its current year estimate of $88 million by more than 10%.

$5,000 FINES URGED IN ABORTION PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attorneys for a coalition of pro-choice organizations said Monday that they 
will ask a federal judge to fine anti-abortion protesters an estimated $5,000 
each for allegedly violating a court order during a series of demonstrations at 
California women's clinics last month. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima set a June 6 hearing to determine 
whether the protesters were in contempt of his order prohibiting them from 
blocking the entrances to clinics during 10 demonstrations that were part of 
"Operation Rescue." 
</P>
<P>
But defense lawyers said Operation Rescue leaders would challenge any contempt 
citations and vowed to carry out more civil disobedience during about 70 
demonstrations planned for the National Day of Rescue on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a crisis coming on where the orders of this judge are going to have to 
be applied against some pretty significant portions of this country," said 
Robert Sassone, an attorney for Randy Adler, head of one of the organization's 
affiliate groups. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect April 29 you will probably see more Americans arrested than were 
arrested in the entire history of the civil rights movement," Sassone said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union foundations of Southern 
California and San Diego said they have proposed fining individual 
demonstrators $5,000 for each violation of the court's order and organizations 
$10,000 for each violation, in addition to assessments for damaged property and 
attorney fees. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs, including the National Abortion Federation and a variety of 
family planning groups, said demonstrators repeatedly violated Tashima's 
preliminary injunction by blocking the entrances to clinics last month during 
demonstrations in Los Angeles, Cypress, Long Beach, Escondido, Chico, Fresno, 
Oakland and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pattern of Conduct 
</P>
<P>
The protesters, they argued, "have engaged in a deliberate and persistent 
pattern of conduct which demonstrates nothing short of a total disregard for 
the harm their activities cause to the plaintiffs and to the court's 
authority." 
</P>
<P>
ACLU lawyer Carol A. Sobel argued it is "imperative" for the court to impose 
civil contempt sanctions against the protesters, most of whom, she said, have 
been promised by Operation Rescue leaders that they face little more than "a 
mild slap on the hand" for their activities. 
</P>
<P>
Sassone said he will argue both that his client, Adler, was not in contempt of 
the court's order and that the order itself was so vague that it was 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
But he said the protesters are also basing their arguments on a higher law. 
</P>
<P>
"The vast majority of people who call themselves Christians are never tested, 
and when they are really tested, some will give up everything, rather than 
their faith," he said. "You can't just say to someone who's starving, 'Bless 
you, my brother, I hope someone gives you some food.' This is going to put the 
people of America who claim to be Christians to a test."

PREGNANT DRUG ADDICTS, BABIES JAM AGENCIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN DAVIDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sarah got her first taste of heroin at age 14, when an uncle fashioned a 
tourniquet around her skinny arm and injected her. 
</P>
<P>
She was quickly hooked, and by the time she turned 18, she was pregnant, too. 
But motherhood scarcely interrupted her addiction then, or the next time she 
got pregnant. Or the next time. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was pregnant, I had to use double," she explained, "because a lot of it 
went to the baby. . . . I would say, 'I don't want to use.' Then I would stick 
the needle in my arm and say, 'God help me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Now 30, Sarah is an Orange County mother of three daughters, ages 1, 2 and 11. 
One, born while Sarah was in a methadone-treatment program, entered the world 
addicted to the heroin substitute. And although Sarah, who spoke on condition 
that her real name not be used, insisted that the other 2 children were not 
affected by her drug use, she recalled that the 2-year-old "for the first 4 or 
5 months . . . would shake real bad out of nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
There are many women like Sarah in Orange County, and many more children, 
according to county health and child welfare officials. Their numbers are 
growing rapidly, but the social network is not. Two county agencies that assist 
pregnant addicts and protect their children are overloaded, constrained by a 
county hiring freeze and, increasingly, unable to meet the burgeoning need. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is enormous and getting worse," said Sylvia Wall, deputy director 
of child care for the Orange County Social Services Agency. "There are hundreds 
of mothers out there, and for every child we come in contact with, there are 
probably two or three more that we never hear about." 
</P>
<P>
Sarah is now in the Orange County Health Care Agency's Perinatal Treatment 
Program, an intensive regimen of counseling and drug screening that may enable 
her to regain custody of her children. The model program, started with 18 women 
in 1985, has grown to 170 women, with a waiting list of 60 to 80 more. 
</P>
<P>
Her daughters are in foster care, as they have been off and on throughout their 
lives. Children of substance abusers make up 62% of all newborns who are 
referred to the social services agency, and 30% of the agency's caseload of 
2,200 youngsters. Meanwhile, only 38 of the county's 400 foster-care slots are 
equipped for the special problems of drug babies, who often suffer physical and 
neurological defects. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows how many drug-exposed babies fall through the cracks because they 
show no obvious signs of withdrawal. But a case review of families involved in 
just two county programs found that 1,662 children under the age of 3 had 
likely been exposed to drugs during pregnancy but had not been detected 
previously. The study, presented in January by county health educator Marian 
Henry, recommends expansion of prenatal care and drug-treatment services. 
</P>
<P>
"It's at a crisis stage for us, because we are always struggling to find foster 
homes for these babies," said Mary Harris, program analyst for the social 
services agency. "We never have the luxury of too many foster homes." 
</P>
<P>
Glenn and Jan Allen measure the distance they dare stray from their 1-year-old 
foster son in seconds, not feet or yards. 
</P>
<P>
When he naps, Billy's breathing is monitored by an electronic device that 
sounds a piercing alarm if he does not draw a breath for 20 seconds. The 
Allens, both nurses, must be close enough that they can quickly reach Billy and 
awaken him or perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't ever be more than 10 seconds from the baby, because by the time you 
get to him, he's already been without oxygen for 30 seconds," Jan Allen said. 
"Sometimes, the monitor will go off 150 to 200 times a night, and then there is 
nothing for a month." 
</P>
<P>
The Allens, who have a 15-year-old daughter, have opened their San Juan 
Capistrano home to 105 foster children in less than 10 years. Like Billy, who 
was born in a hotel room to a cocaine addict, most of the children were exposed 
to street drugs in the womb. And, like Billy, many cry inconsolably, suffer 
bouts of jitters, lethargy and apnea, a neurological defect that can cause them 
to suddenly stop breathing. 
</P>
<P>
Withdrawal has been different with each child, according to Glenn Allen. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the kids have gone through intense periods of pain and aversion to 
touch or any stimulation. Then they seem OK. Other kids go through withdrawal 
that seems to go on forever and ever. Developmentally, these children are 
usually delayed; a year or more behind other kids in some areas. They might 
catch up, if they are fortunate and get the right care." 
</P>
<P>
Billy is tethered to a portable apnea monitor that records his breathing 
whenever the Allens bring him on an outing: he could fall asleep in a car seat 
or a shopping cart and suffocate. Their home is outfitted like a neo-natal 
nursery, with high-tech gadgetry and dim lights to reduce environmental 
stimulation for hypersensitive infants. Care of such infants is so demanding 
that the couple have formed a High Risk Infant Team to train and support other 
foster parents. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel angry at the mothers," Jan Allen said. "I think they should be forced 
to go into drug treatment programs. We need more treatment programs to help the 
borderline cases keep their kids. But sometimes, you have four or five addicted 
kids from the same mother who is always on drugs. That's a hopeless case." 
</P>
<P>
Billy's mother has visited him once in the 8 months he has spent with the 
Allens. "She seemed like a nice girl," Glenn Allen said. "She was trying to get 
it together and for a while she was drug-free. But then she went back to drugs 
and we haven't heard from her since." 
</P>
<P>
Billy, whose name has been changed to conceal his identity, will be the Allen's 
last foster child. The couple is about to complete the adoption of a 3-year-old 
boy whose mother and grandmother were heroin addicts. Then they will 
concentrate on their newly expanded family for a while. 
</P>
<P>
"These children need a homelike environment, but not at the cost of burnout for 
a foster family," Jan Allen said. "It can be very stressful. You have to give 
yourself space, time to keep your relationship alive with your husband and the 
rest of your family. You can't try to save the world." 
</P>
<P>
There isn't much public sympathy for drug addicts, especially women who are 
addicts, officials of the Orange County Health Care Agency realize. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a pervasive attitude that these women are criminals and what they are 
doing is a crime," said Bill Edelman, manager of the agency's drug program. 
"But they are producing children, and unless we get involved, we won't change 
their lives." 
</P>
<P>
The women who participate in the health care agency's Perinatal Treatment 
Program all are mothers, ages 18 to around 35. Some come voluntarily, but more 
often they are ordered to take part by a judge or a social worker as a 
condition to keeping or regaining custody of their children. 
</P>
<P>
No residential treatment is available for drug-addicted mothers in Orange 
County, but the outpatient perinatal program includes some of the hard-nosed 
structure found in inpatient programs. Clients are required to attend group and 
individual therapy sessions and to undergo drug testing twice a week. If their 
drug tests indicate recent use, they risk expulsion. If they are late for 
appointments, they are counted absent. 
</P>
<P>
For many, it is the first time in their lives that they have had to follow 
strict rules. Their lives have been chaotic and often violent, without the 
daily discipline of school or employment. Most of the women were victims of 
their environments long before they victimized a new generation through drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"What society needs to understand is that these women do drugs for a reason," 
said Shoni Welsh, chief of the perinatal program, which operates on a $400,000 
annual budget. "Drugs help them deal with their lives. They have very 
transient, unstable life styles. Without the drugs, it would be more difficult 
to deal with issues like incest, abandonment, abuse." 
</P>
<P>
Sarah is typical of the women being treated by the county. Her father and all 
nine siblings were addicted to heroin, and family arguments were occasionally 
punctuated by gunfire. In her out-of-control household, drugs were a part of 
"normal" life. Even as an adult, she is more comfortable around fellow drug 
addicts than people who don't use drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah twists her long, dark hair around a finger as she talks. Her voice is 
soft and flat as she describes the need for drugs that led her into burglary, 
prostitution and theft. "I started with heroin; I guess that's why I never 
liked pot," she said. "I was the youngest, and every time I came home it 
(heroin) would be there. I didn't know where else to go. After a while, I did 
what I had to do to pay for my drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Sarah said she realized that she was hooked around age 17. Because drug use 
caused her to stop menstruating and to feel sick most of the time when she 
wasn't high, she said she did not realize that she was pregnant until she was 7 
months along. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to stop. When you're hooked, you hurt, you vomit and you cry. . . . 
How can people think a drug addict don't care (about her children). Get a drug 
addict when they are clean and sober and they'll tell you how much they care." 
</P>
<P>
Even with help, the success of the women in the perinatal program at staying 
off drugs is not good, Welsh said. "Over 50% of our women do get their children 
back," she said, pausing for a long moment before adding, "but there is a big 
relapse rate." 
</P>
<P>
Sarah began "slipping" during recent weeks, Welsh said. She tested positive a 
few times in succession, perhaps as a result of a family crisis. Finally, Sarah 
entered an inpatient detoxification and drug-counseling program, where she is 
still being treated. 
</P>
<P>
"She went into detox voluntarily," Welsh said. "That's a good sign -- it shows 
motivation."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HIGHER HORSE STALL RENTS APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Recreation and Parks on Monday approved a 
controversial boost in the rental rates for horse stalls at the debt-ridden Los 
Angeles Equestrian Center in Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
The increases, which board members said are needed to help ease the center's 
financial burdens, will be as high as $36 a month for some stalls and are 
effective immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Some horse boarders had opposed the increases, saying they were being "priced 
out" of the center and were being unfairly singled out to help the facility 
become profitable. However, just before the board's vote, many boarders said 
they favor the increase as long as the center continues operating.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: THORNBURGH: L.A. NOT SLIGHTED IN DRUG WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh denied Monday that Los Angeles is being 
shortchanged on federal funds and resources to fight violent street gangs and 
drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you have enough? No. Will you ever have enough? Never," Thornburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
He was in the city to be briefed on the Los Angeles Gang Drug Task Force, a 
multiagency group organized six months ago to target major drug distributors 
affiliated with street gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles right now is distributing more than half of the nation's cocaine," 
said U.S. Atty. Robert Bonner, who described gangs as responsible for 
distributing crack or rock cocaine to 47 cities outside Los Angeles and as the 
prime suppliers to the Washington, D.C., area. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh recently chose the nation's capital for a test project in which 
federal law enforcement will focus efforts there to curb a rampant drug 
problem. At a news conference, Thornburgh was asked why Los Angeles wasn't 
chosen for the experiment if it is the nation's major drug center. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is not confined to Los Angeles. I assure you it is a major 
priority," he said, noting that 24 prosecutors had been added to the U.S. 
attorney's office here.

</P>

<P>
Authorities attempting to extradite from Columbus, Ohio, to California a man 
wanted in connection with a death that has been linked to an alleged insurance 
and embezzlement scam will have to wait at least one week, a judge ruled 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin County Common Pleas Judge Dale Crawford granted a request for a 
continuance in extradition proceedings against Melvin E. Hanson, one of three 
men authorities believe were involved. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson, former business partner John Hawkins and Glendale neurologist Richard 
Boggs face murder and other charges in Los Angeles stemming from the alleged 
scam, which investigators say included faking Hanson's death. Authorities in 
Ohio and California say the scam was designed to net the men at least $3.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Boggs is in custody in California. Hawkins, who was Hanson's business partner 
in the Columbus-based Just Sweats chain of athletic clothing stores, remains at 
large.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BOLSA CHICA; 
</P>
<P>
TRAPPING OF RED FOXES TO RESUME TO SAVE BIRDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Department of Fish and Game will resume trapping red foxes at the 
Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve later this month in an effort to protect two 
endangered species of birds whose eggs and chicks have been devoured by the 
predators, agency officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
According to Fish and Game reports, eggs or chicks in 75 California least tern 
nests were lost last year to predators, including red foxes and other animals. 
Belding's savannah sparrow nests also were hard hit, but population figures 
were not immediately available, said Earl Laupe, a wildlife management 
supervisor for the state agency. 
</P>
<P>
While skunks and kestrel also are predators in the state reserve, the red fox 
is believed to be the primary one, Laupe said. Ten foxes were trapped at the 
Bolsa Chica reserve last year and a similar number have been seen in the 800 to 
900 acres of wetland this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman for an Orange County-based animal rights organization 
threatened Monday to take action to halt the state's trapping program. The 
Animal Lovers Volunteer Assn. already has filed a suit aimed at blocking 
similar trapping of red foxes at the nearby Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have to take action to prevent unnecessary killing, said Hal Baerg, 
president of the Huntington Beach organization. "We'll do what we have to do."

But state officials said killing the foxes is their only alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"We are legally constrained to save the least tern," said Kurt Taucher, 
spokesman for the state Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
"(The foxes) are too common and too abundant and the zoos don't want them," he 
said, referring to problems associated with federal efforts to relocate red 
foxes when trapping at the naval weapons station first began in 1986.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNSELOR AT MENTAL CLINIC TAKEN HOSTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A resident of a Cerritos mental health clinic held a counselor at knifepoint 
for more than an hour before releasing her and returning quietly to his room, 
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Levinson, 20, was arrested following the Sunday evening incident in the 
office of counselor Diane Amneus, 42, at Casa de Amistad, a private clinic that 
houses up to six patients under contract with the county Health Department. 
Amneus was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Dave Rosenberger said the counselor told deputies that Levinson, who weighs 
300 pounds, asked to borrow a knife so he could prepare his dinner. As she 
unlocked the closet where knives are kept for sign-out by patients, Levinson 
lunged forward and seized a 13-inch butcher knife, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Levinson demanded money and forced Amneus to make three or four telephone calls 
while threatening her, Rosenberger said. After she managed to convince him that 
he should not take her money, Levinson reportedly put down the knife and left 
her office.

VICTIM OF FATAL CRASH WAS NEWPORT GIRL, 16 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A girl who was killed in a flaming, head-on collision on Coast Highway was 
identified Monday as Valerie Hacker, 16, of Newport Beach, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The girl died of injuries suffered in the fire caused by the Sunday night 
traffic collision, Orange County Deputy Coroner C. Ellingburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred when a Jeep Wagoneer traveling south on Coast Highway 
veered to avoid hitting a car coming from an exit road in the affluent, seaside 
Emerald Bay community. Authorities said the Jeep driver pulled into the 
opposite lane to avoid the collision, but hit a BMW headed northbound. 
</P>
<P>
Hacker was in the Jeep, as were two other injured people, according to police. 
The driver of the BMW was also injured in the crash, which sparked a fire that 
spread to a house and closed the road to traffic for half an hour.

AL MARTINEZ: REQUIEM FOR A CLOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a man who had spent his life making others laugh, Martin Ragaway's final 
observation seemed a bitter punch line to 35 years of comedy writing. 
</P>
<P>
Kept alive by tubes at St. Vincent's Hospital, unable to speak, he gestured for 
a pencil and a pad and wrote laboriously, "Game's over, we all lose." 
</P>
<P>
Then, his body eaten with cancer, Ragaway closed his eyes and was dead at 66. 
Or 62. I never did know his real age. 
</P>
<P>
"How old are you?" I asked impatiently when I first met him a few years back in 
a Studio City bar called Residuals. 
</P>
<P>
Ragaway had been side-stepping the question for an hour, telling jokes, making 
comments, waiting for laughs. He had the quick, furtive moves of a chipmunk, 
and even sitting still seemed in motion. 
</P>
<P>
"S-Sixty," he finally replied with a slight stammer. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't look it," I said in false praise. 
</P>
<P>
"O-k-kay," he shot back, "59." 
</P>
<P>
Before I could respond he was out of the starting blocks again and halfway 
around the track with, "You hear about the widow in Miami Beach? She meets a 
guy and says, 'I've never seen you around here before.' 
</P>
<P>
"He says, 'I've been in prison for 34 years. I poisoned my wife, cut her into 
small p-pieces and put her in the garbage disposal.' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Oh,' she says, 'then you're a s-single man!' " 
</P>
<P>
Ragaway never stopped entertaining. He told stories, he repeated anecdotes, he 
made up gag lines. Sometimes he stammered, sometimes he didn't. The faster he 
talked, the less he stammered. 
</P>
<P>
He had his own newsletter, "Funny, Funny World," composed of jokes, offbeat 
news items and comments on the news. He began by sending it to friends. In a 
few years it had a circulation of 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
It was another way of telling a story, of defining with wry insight the nature 
of the existence he would ultimately call a game. Ragaway was a man obsessed 
with laughter, the ultimate entertainer, the quintessential clown. 
</P>
<P>
Then why didn't he leave us laughing? 
</P>
<P>
I last saw him three months ago. I didn't know he was dying. None of his 
friends did. He didn't look well, but he never looked well. That's what made my 
false compliment seem funny to him back at Residuals. 
</P>
<P>
The face was pale and craggy, the eyebrows arched in a sad and quizzical 
expression, his hair dyed a funny auburn. Only the eyes were bright and 
riveting. Only the eyes were alive. 
</P>
<P>
He talked about his years of comedy writing the last time we met, about how he 
churned out gags for Skelton, Benny, Hope, Gleason and a lot of others you 
wouldn't remember if I told you. 
</P>
<P>
There was a biographical quality to his monologue. He wanted me to remember. 
The cancer he had secretly fought for almost two years was winning. 
</P>
<P>
Ragaway had written for radio first and then television. He produced scripts 
for 400 sitcom episodes, or maybe 800. He told different stories. "All those 
episodes," he'd say with incredulity, "and I'm s-still able to dress myself and 
t-tie my own shoes." 
</P>
<P>
He loved making people laugh but hated laugh tracks, and it drove him crazy 
when sitcom actors couldn't deliver the lines he sweated to create. 
</P>
<P>
Of one particular performer he'd say, "She's so dumb she thinks a d-double 
entendre is a strong drink." 
</P>
<P>
"My father was always entertaining," his daughter Jill said. "At a dinner party 
he'd sneak a look at a matchbook cover he'd written words on during the day to 
remind him of jokes. When we'd see the matchbook cover come out we'd say, 'Oh, 
oh, here it comes.' Then he'd start in." 
</P>
<P>
Ragaway's last note perplexes fellow comedy writer Bill Larkin. "It didn't seem 
like Marty. He was always up. His only goal in life was to entertain. But maybe 
being up and entertaining just covered his real attitude. Who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
Humor is born in dark places of the soul, masking anguish with a tilt toward 
absurdity. The humorist defines not only human folly but his own dreadful 
inadequacies, and to come face to face with them is to look the devil in the 
eye. 
</P>
<P>
I think at the end Ragaway was observing life's ironies more than its 
futilities. He was acknowledging that we all play a game we can never win, no 
matter how well we play it. 
</P>
<P>
"Humor," he once said to me, "is based on little realities. Everything's a 
joke." 
</P>
<P>
Last week he must have realized the joke is ultimately on the clown.

RETIRED POLICE CAPTAIN SHOT IN BUENA PARK FLORIST SHOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCILLE RENWICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A retired police captain was shot in the head and chest in his Buena Park 
florist shop Monday when he refused a robber's demand to hand over his money 
and his wife's purse, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Coovert, 56, a Buena Park resident who served on the city's police force 
for 11 years, was listed in "serious to critical" condition Monday night after 
surgery at Western Medical Center in Santa Ana, according to a nursing 
supervisor at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confronted by Robber 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park police spokesman Rich McMillen said Coovert and his wife, Betty, 
were confronted in Garrick's Flowers, the florist shop in the 6000 block of 
Orangethorpe Avenue, about 1:20 p.m. by a robber who demanded that the couple 
sit on chairs in the back of the store and turn over all their cash and Betty 
Coovert's purse. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Coovert told investigators that her husband was shot when he refused, 
McMillen said. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park Police Chief Robert Reber and other officers, alarmed at word of the 
shooting, rushed to the Cooverts' shop on Orangethorpe Avenue to assist in the 
investigation. But no suspect had been arrested by late Monday night, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Coovert, who retired from the department in 1973, still is well known around 
the Buena Park police station because of his participation on the force's 
bowling league and numerous civic and departmental functions, Buena Park Police 
Lt. Tony Kelley said. Coovert, who worked for 7 years as a Compton police 
officer before joining the Buena Park Police Department, has four sons, two of 
whom are police officers in Buena Park and Brea. 
</P>
<P>
"If people didn't know him from working with him back then, they certainly know 
him from all the time he's spent around the station and in the community," 
Kelley said. "He's a real well-liked individual." 
</P>
<P>
Kelley said several officers were shocked when they heard of the shooting 
"because here's a man who spends 18 years as a cop and nothing like this 
happens to him and then after he retires he gets shot." 
</P>
<P>
Detectives, who still were searching for the robber late Monday night, have not 
determined how much money was stolen, McMillen said. Coovert and his wife have 
owned the store for about 15 years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hours of Surgery 
</P>
<P>
McMillen said Coovert underwent several hours of surgery at Western Medical 
Center for wounds to his head, kidneys and spleen. One of the bullets struck 
very near to Coovert's left eye but there was no sign of any damage to his 
brain, McMillen said. One of the former officer's kidneys and his spleen were 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a strong sort of a guy, stocky, well-built . . . a tenacious person," 
Kelley said. "I think that he's pretty committed to standing up for himself. He 
certainly wouldn't be the guy I'd pick to rob."

JUDGE REJECTS HACKER'S PLEA BARGAIN, CALLS YEAR IN PRISON OVERLY LENIENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge on Monday unexpectedly rejected a plea bargain calling for a 
one-year prison term for accused computer hacker Kevin Mitnick, declaring that 
the 25-year-old keyboard virtuoso deserves more time behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Mitnick, you have been engaging in this conduct for too long, and no one 
has actually punished you," U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer said. "This is 
the last time you are going to do this." 
</P>
<P>
Both the government prosecutor and Mitnick's lawyer appeared nonplussed at the 
judge's rejection of their agreement, which also voided Mitnick's guilty plea 
to two felony counts of computer fraud and possession of unauthorized telephone 
long-distance codes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm obviously very disappointed," said Mitnick's lawyer, Alan Rubin. "I think 
the judge obviously in her own mind considers him to be more dangerous than 
either I or the government considers him." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. James L. Sanders said he had no comment on the ruling, 
except that the one-year prison term called for under the plea agreement was 
within the range dictated under mandatory new federal sentencing guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Mitnick has been held without bail in a downtown Los Angeles federal detention 
center since his arrest in December after prosecutors said his long history of 
penetrating computers all over the world rendered him an unusual danger. Even 
his phone privileges have been restricted because of fears he could use a 
prison telephone to access outside computers. 
</P>
<P>
But Sanders told the judge Monday that prosecutors found no evidence that 
Mitnick ever damaged the computers he penetrated or attempted to make money 
from computer software he secretly lifted from private computer banks. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a case where Mr. Mitnick destroyed anyone's computer. This is not 
a situation where he implanted a virus in anyone's computer," the prosecutor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mitnick originally pleaded guilty to stealing a sophisticated security 
program from a Digital Equipment Corp. computer, the company lost only about 
$160,000 in computer "down time" to trace the security breach, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the judge said a confidential pre-sentence report recommended that she 
exceed even the 18-month maximum prison term called for under the sentencing 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at Mr. Mitnick's background," she said. "He is a person who has engaged 
in this conduct before -- rather consistently before. Is there any reason to 
believe that he will not go right on doing this?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Invaded Varied Systems 
</P>
<P>
Starting when he was a high school student in the San Fernando Valley, Mitnick 
allegedly used terminals at various schools and companies to break into Defense 
Department computer systems, sabotage business computers and harass anyone -- 
including a probation officer and FBI agents -- who got in his way. He also 
manipulated the phone system to disconnect the lines of Hollywood celebrities, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the two felony counts to which Mitnick admitted and the one-year 
prison term were enough to "get his attention." 
</P>
<P>
"I believe he's finally starting to grow up," the defense attorney said. "He 
desperately wants to change his life and turn it around." 
</P>
<P>
Both the prosecutor and defense attorney said the judge's action could make it 
more difficult to bring charges against Mitnick's alleged associates in the 
most recent round of computer break-ins. If Mitnick is brought to trial, 
Sanders said, testimony from at least at least one of his associates would be 
required to convict him -- and they would not appear as witnesses without 
receiving immunity from prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Pfaelzer set a May 5 hearing to consider pretrial motions in the case, but no 
new trial date was set. Rubin said he did not know whether Mitnick would agree 
to a guilty plea carrying a longer prison term.

POSTSCRIPT: ANOTHER BATTLESHIP TRAGEDY -- SIMILAR TO THE IOWA -- OCCURRED 65 
YEARS AGO, OFF SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The explosion tore through the No. 2 gun turret during a firing exercise on the 
big American battleship, killing more than 40 sailors and triggering an inquiry 
into how such an accident could occur on a modern Navy warship. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't the catastrophe that struck the battleship Iowa off Puerto Rico 
last week, claiming 47 lives. It was one that occurred 65 years ago off San 
Clemente Island, about 45 miles south of Los Angeles Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
The date was June 12, 1924, and the battleship Mississippi, launched just seven 
years earlier, was involved in mock warfare maneuvers with the Tennessee, the 
Idaho and the California -- three other Pacific Fleet battleships. 
</P>
<P>
As in the case of the Iowa last week, a gun crew on the Mississippi was 
preparing to load bags of gunpowder into the magazines of the ship's 14-inch 
guns in the No. 2 turret when the powder ignited. 
</P>
<P>
The heat of the explosion was so great that it welded two of the massive steel 
turret doors shut. Forty-eight men died. Dozens more were injured. 
</P>
<P>
Only two of the men in the turret firing room escaped, somehow managing to dive 
down a 40-foot hatchway that closed automatically behind them. The closing of 
the hatch sealed the fate of any others in the firing room who might have 
survived the blast, trapping them in the toxic, flaming gas cloud created by 
the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
A Navy board of inquiry concluded that a faulty gas-ejection system prevented 
one of the breech plugs from closing securely, thereby permitting a jet of 
flame to spurt back into the powder-filled room when a salvo was fired. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators, said John Reilly of the Naval Historical Center in 
Washington, also found that some access safety doors inside the turret had been 
left partly open -- a violation of regulations. 
</P>
<P>
And, Reilly said, the crew failed to eyeball one or more of the gun bores and 
call out "Bore clear!" -- another failure to follow the rules. 
</P>
<P>
"There are safety precautions that have to be followed meticulously," Reilly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Since that 1924 accident, Reilly pointed out, battleship gun turrets have been 
designed with more internal subdivision. Thus, the Iowa's 16-inch gun turrets 
are better compartmentalized. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened this time, nobody yet knows," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Mississippi, incidentally, was to go through the same agony again -- this 
time in November of 1943 while bombarding the Makin Islands in the Pacific 
during World War II. "There was another flareback," Reilly said. "For some 
reason they had turned off the gas-ejection system and had reloaded too soon." 
</P>
<P>
Again, it was turret No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
That time, 43 men died. 
</P>
<P>
Many of today's precautions date back to the aftermath of the Navy's first big 
gun turret flareback explosion. That was in 1904 aboard the old battleship 
Missouri, built the year before. There were two 12-inch guns per turret and no 
subdivisions. 
</P>
<P>
And 32 men were killed.

TAX ELECTION PLANS ADVANCE A NOTCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Plans for a Nov. 7 election on a half-cent sales tax in Orange County were 
advanced Monday with release of a proposed traffic improvement ordinance that 
would control how the revenue would be spent. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would deny proceeds to any city failing to use the money for 
transportation projects. The ordinance also would bar money to cities that fail 
to tie future growth to traffic standards. Also, it would require cities to 
spend the tax money within 3 years of receiving it. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was made public Monday by the Orange County Transportation 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley T. Oftelie, the panel's executive director, called the provision 
barring money to cities that do not spend them on transportation a "death 
penalty" clause, enforcement of which could not be appealed to the Local 
Transportation Authority that would be set up to administer the tax. 
</P>
<P>
However, such a ban would last just 5 years, after which time a city could ask 
the authority for permission to again receive sales taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Rogers, the San Juan Capistrano rancher who led a successful effort to 
defeat a similar 1-cent sales tax in 1984, said Monday that he is concerned 
about some provisions of the current plan. He wants to be assured that the 
ordinance's citizens advisory group would have enough authority to see that the 
measure is enforced. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's going to be a rubber stamp for current officeholders, it won't work," 
Rogers said. "You can't just give the money to the same people who caused the 
(traffic) problem in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
OCTC officials want to use the sales tax to help pay for $11.6 billion in road 
and transit projects over 20 years. The commission will hold a public hearing 
on the 20-year plan at 9 a.m. on May 8 in the county's Hall of Administration 
in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-year plan would use $3.1 billion raised through the tax to supplement 
$8.5 billion expected to come from traditional sources, such as state, federal 
and local governments. The plan would pay for such projects as widening the 
Santa Ana Freeway from six lanes to 12, increasing rail service and adding 
car-pool lanes.

<P>
Assuming that the 20-year plan is adopted by the commission, the panel would 
then approve the traffic improvement ordinance and call for an election. The 
Board of Supervisors would then have until Aug. 8 to schedule a Nov. 7 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Oftelie said supervisors would be unlikely to refuse to schedule such an 
election if the Transportation Commission calls for one. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley could not be reached for comment.

TITANS' STEWART TAKEN IN EIGHTH ROUND BY MINNESOTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Alex Stewart's long wait to be drafted ended Monday morning when Minnesota 
chose him in the eighth round of the National Football League draft, five 
rounds lower than Stewart had expected to go. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart played only eight games of major-college football as a defensive 
lineman at Cal State Fullerton and had only 38 tackles, but did so well in the 
tests of athletic ability at the NFL scouting combine that some draft experts 
predicted he would be chosen in the second or third round. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he sat by the television as the first five rounds passed Sunday 
without his name being called. Finally, on Monday, Minnesota made him the 219th 
pick overall. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very disappointed," said Stewart, who is expected to try to make the 
Vikings as a defensive end. "They drafted a lot of players not rated as highly 
as I was, like Chris Gannon from (Louisiana State). They're all jokes. How can 
you look over someone who runs as fast as I do?" 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said he is ready to put the draft behind him and concentrate on making 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
"They're getting me for a bargain-basement price," he said. "But I'm happy 
about Minnesota right now." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart was the first of three Fullerton defensive players taken in the final 
seven rounds of the 12-round draft Monday. 
</P>
<P>
A.J. Jenkins, a defensive end whose 77 tackles were second on the Titan team 
last year, was drafted by Pittsburgh in the eighth round with the 228th pick. 
Jenkins led the Titans in tackles for losses with 19. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Leggett, a linebacker whose 109 tackles led Fullerton, was chosen by New 
Orleans in the ninth round with the 246th pick. ROBYN NORWOOD

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK;

RANCHO SANTIAGO COULD POLISH OFF BASEBALL RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Although there are more than two weeks left in the Orange Empire Conference 
baseball race, first-place Rancho Santiago College could make it a pretty dull 
finish with two victories this week. 
</P>
<P>
The Dons (25-12 overall and 14-5 in conference play) hold a one-game lead over 
second-place Cypress and a two-game lead over Orange Coast. Golden West is 2 
1/2 games back. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago plays at Orange Coast (25-10-1, 12-7) today at 2:30 p.m. and 
then plays host to Cypress (27-12, 13-6) at 2:30 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"These are our two most important games yet," Rancho Santiago Coach Don Sneddon 
said. "By the end of the week, we will have a definite idea which way the race 
will go." 
</P>
<P>
If any team has an advantage this week, it would be Cypress because of the 
schedule. The Chargers defeated Orange Coast, 6-0, Saturday and have a bye 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange Empire is a seven-team conference, so each team has a scheduled bye 
in each round. Cypress' bye falls between games against Orange Coast and Rancho 
Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
The Dons figure to send Jack Bailey (10-2) to the mound today and Orange Coast 
should counter with Ryan Thibault (7-1). Rancho Santiago would then pitch 
Willie Navarrette (9-4) against Cypress, which will have three rested starters 
in Jeff Patterson, Dennis Burbank and Rich Lodding. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey and Navarrette, two reasons for the Dons' success, have also been called 
on more often than any other pitchers in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Navarrette has pitched 119 2/3 innings and Bailey 111 1/3. The next highest 
total in the conference belongs to Cypress' Patterson with 90 2/3. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not worried about them being tired," Sneddon said of Bailey and 
Navarrette. "They are both healthy and strong and we've been very fortunate in 
that they normally have low-pitch totals." 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast is the favorite in the Orange Empire Conference swimming finals 
and Golden West is the favorite in the South Coast Conference finals, which 
both start Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast won the men's and women's titles -- each team finishing 8-0 -- and 
should continue to dominate in the conference meet at Saddleback Thursday 
through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange Coast women's team, coached by Don Watson, has won 64 consecutive 
dual matches, dating back to February 1982. The team had won four consecutive 
state titles before finishing second to Diablo Valley College last season. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden West men's and women's teams also went undefeated in six dual 
matches. The South Coast Conference meet is Thursday through Saturday at 
Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast and Golden West will be among the favorites at the state meet May 
4-6 at Diablo Valley in Pleasant Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Community College Notes 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago pitcher Jack Bailey and Golden West infielder Craig Paquette 
have signed national letters of intent to attend Cal State Fullerton this fall. 
. . . Rob Bailey, a sophomore outfielder at Fullerton, has signed to attend the 
University of Texas this fall. Mitch Kaylor, a freshman second baseman at 
Cypress, has signed to attend Cal State Long Beach this fall. Ryan Thibault, a 
sophomore pitcher at Orange Coast, has signed to attend Pepperdine this fall. . 
. . Cypress played Saturday without sophomore first baseman Doug Yates, who 
suffered a broken nose in a collision with catcher Terry Tewell chasing a foul 
popup Wednesday. Yates, who had his nose set Monday, also received 15 stitches 
above his left eye. Cypress has a bye today, but Yates is expected to play 
Thursday.

BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: HE'S A STROKE OF GOOD FORTUNE FOR VILLA PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until coming to Villa Park High School, Gavin Arroyo was only used to taking 
his time in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
As a member of Tustin's Southern California Swim Club, Arroyo specializes in 
such distance events as the 1,000 and 1,650 meters -- long races that take 
endurance and require pacing. 
</P>
<P>
But Arroyo has been asked to pick up his pace for Villa Park's team. He has 
become a sprinter. 
</P>
<P>
"When he first started swimming sprints for us, his mom was concerned," Villa 
Park Coach Jeff Ehrlich said. "She said he was doing so well as a distance 
swimmer. But we thought he had the ability to do the shorter races." 
</P>
<P>
He does. 
</P>
<P>
Arroyo, The Times' athlete of the week, won the 200-yard freestyle and the 
500-yard freestyle at the Foothill Invitational swim meet Saturday. He also 
swam the anchor leg of the 400 freestyle relay, which Villa Park won. 
</P>
<P>
"I really wasn't expecting to do that well," said Arroyo, who was named the 
boys' swimmer of the meet. "There were so many good swimmers there. And they 
were even faster than I thought they would be." 
</P>
<P>
Arroyo's most impressive performance was in the relay. He swam his 100-yard leg 
in 46.18 seconds and overtook a San Marino swimmer down the stretch to give 
Villa Park the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Swimming the sprints is so different," said Arroyo, a junior. "Distance 
swimming is endurance. In sprinting, you rely much more on reflexes." 
</P>
<P>
Arroyo has participated in sprints before, but he hadn't competed in one since 
he was 12 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"I swam the breaststroke until I was 10, but it wasn't working out so I 
switched to distance," he said. "For the last five years, that's all I've 
swam." 
</P>
<P>
Until Ehrlich needed a sprinter for his relay team. 
</P>
<P>
Arroyo has adapted quickly to the role. His workouts change during the high 
school season because he doesn't need to log as many yards in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
He also credits water polo with improving his sprinting skills. Arroyo was a 
member of the Villa Park team last season. 
</P>
<P>
"Water polo is just like sprint swimming," he said. "You have to start swimming 
so quickly that you don't have time to think about it." 
</P>
<P>
Arroyo has become so good in the sprints, Ehrlich said he has a good chance of 
breaking the Southern Section record in the 100-yard freestyle (45.54). Mike 
Kelly of Fountain Valley set the record in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had other high school coaches come up to me and say that Gavin could 
break the 100 record," Ehrlich said. "Even (Fountain Valley Coach) Ray Bray, 
who coached Kelly, said Gavin had a good chance. 
</P>
<P>
"I think before Gavin is done at Villa Park, he'll have that record." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Duane Cameron of Marina had 56 kills as the Vikings upset Laguna Beach, 20-18, 
8-15, 15-12, 16-14, in a nonleague volleyball match Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Disbro of Mission Viejo had two home runs and six runs batted in as 
Mission Viejo defeated Irvine, 7-0, Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Gajewski of Los Alamitos beat El Dorado twice last week. He pitched 10 
innings, giving up five hits, in a 5-3 victory Wednesday. He was also the 
winner in relief in the Griffins' 9-8, nine-inning victory Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Denny Hathaway of El Modena had a hole in one at the Riverview golf course 
Thursday as the Vanguards defeated Santa Ana, 190-222. Hathaway shot a 
one-over-par 34. 
</P>

BAEZA LANDS MORE PUNCHES IN IRVINE WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It came down to quality against quantity Monday night, and quantity won as 
junior lightweight Armando Baeza scored a split-decision victory over Benny 
Lopez in front of 1,180 in the main event of the monthly boxing program at the 
Irvine Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
Baeza, from Norwalk, landed punches constantly, but seldom with enough pop 
behind them to hurt Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, from Upland, hit harder but much less often. Neither fighter was ever in 
danger of being knocked down. 
</P>
<P>
Baeza (13-3-1) won 95-94, on judge Larry Rozadilla's card, and 97-94 on judge 
Pat Connolly's card. Judge Chuck Hassett gave Lopez the nod, 98-92. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I landed better shots every round," Baeza said through an interpreter. 
"He only hurt me in the fifth, but I was fine after that." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez had scored first-round knockouts in each of his last two fights, and 
Baeza, aware of that, stayed away for most of the first two rounds. After that, 
he moved in on Lopez and scored with several combinations. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, fighting a 10-rounder for the first time, seemed to rest for parts of 
every round after the fifth, letting Baeza gain the advantage in the later 
rounds. Even in the final round, Lopez (13-2) was very selective, throwing only 
a few punches and none in the final 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of eerie after the sixth," Lopez said. "I never got tired, but I 
was thinking about having never gone 10 rounds before. I just never followed up 
my punches. I would get to him them let him get away."

FOR ANDERSON AND ORIOLES, THERE'S NO LOOKING BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE LOWERY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With so many bad vibes, not to mention numbers, emanating from the general 
direction of 1988, Baltimore Orioles center fielder Brady Anderson prefers to 
dwell on the here and now. 
</P>
<P>
Here being Anaheim Stadium, now being a Monday night game against the Angels 
that the Orioles entered leading the American League East by 1 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, those Orioles, who redefined the term cellar-dweller last season by going 
54-107, adding their personal mark by losing the first 21 games of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But the Orioles are on top and Brady Anderson has led them. Well, he's led off 
for them. Anderson, who played his college ball at UC Irvine, is hitting .253 
from the leadoff spot. He leads the team in runs (15) and stolen bases (10). 
</P>
<P>
"You can't say he's the entire reason for our success, but he's certainly 
played an important part," Baltimore Manager Frank Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles are the youngest team in the major leagues, with an average age of 
26 years, 1 month. Anderson is 25. 
</P>
<P>
Coming into Monday's game, they had been outhit, .240 to .257, but had managed 
to outscore opponents, 77 to 73. 
</P>
<P>
This has meant they've had to manufacture a few runs, and Anderson has been a 
captain of industry. Typical of his season was Anderson's second at-bat Monday 
against Jim Abbott of the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson walked to lead off the third -- he leads the team in that category 
with 10. He then stole second and third to set a club record for most steals in 
April with eight. That put him past the likes of Luis Aparicio and Paul Blair. 
</P>
<P>
He then scored the Orioles' first run on Cal Ripkin's sacrifice, scoring 
without luxury of a base hit in a game the Angels rallied to win, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to get on and make things happen," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Things were happening last season for Anderson. Unfortunately for him, they 
were the kind of things that has Anderson stating, "I don't want to talk about 
last season." 
</P>
<P>
But which last season is he talking about? 
</P>
<P>
The season with the Boston Red Sox? One that started with great promise -- he 
was hitting .276 at the start -- but ended with him going zero for 20 at the 
plate and from Boston to triple-A Pawtucket by June 4. 
</P>
<P>
Is it the penance he paid in the minors, where he began zero for 13? 
</P>
<P>
Or is it the 53 games he endured with the Orioles after Boston traded him and 
pitcher Curt Schilling for pitcher Mike Boddicker? Anderson hit .197 with 
Baltimore, striking out 40 times in 177 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson prefers that the past stay in the past, as do most of the Orioles who 
seem a bit sensitive anytime 1988 is mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't say a thing to them about last season," Robinson said. "What good 
would it do? For us to win, kids like Brady Anderson have to produce, that's 
all. There's no point in looking back." 
</P>
<P>
Forced to do so, Anderson says the difference in him as a player this year and 
last are just a few minor adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
He modified his stance and forced himself to become a more patient hitter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the only reason, but it's a distraction," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Robinson: "For a young player like that, it helps to know every day 
exactly where and what you're doing. That way you can focus on your job and not 
worry about other things." 
</P>
<P>
What's to worry? Brady Anderson is in center field and 1988 is behind him.

ALMANAC / RETAIL SALES IN 1988 THIRD QUARTER: COUNTY RANKS SECOND IN STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Compared to those in other California counties, consumers in Orange County do 
more than their share of spending. Orange County ranked second among the 
state's counties in total taxable sales in the 1988 third quarter at $6.4 
billion, according to the State Board ofEqualization. The county had $1.5 
billion more sales than third-place San Diego County, although the latter now 
has a larger population, according to state estimates. 
</P>
<P>
In per-person sales, Orange County's figure of $2,859 was easily best among the 
more populous Southern California counties. Among counties in the top 10 in 
total sales, only San Mateo had a higher per-person figure, $2,872. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's sales total was 8.8% higher than in the 1987 third quarter, 
while statewide spending increased 7.9%.

MARCH RESALE HOME PRICES LEVEL OFF HERE, SURGE IN OTHER AREAS OF STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The number of homes sold in California set a 2-year record in March, as fear of 
higher interest rates caused buyers to flock to the market in Orange County and 
other metropolitan areas, the California Assn. of Realtors said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Home prices, meanwhile, leveled off in Orange County while rising in other 
parts of the state. The median price of a detached resale home in the county 
edged up to $238,807 in March, a 0.6% increase for the month and 24.9% for the 
year, the trade group said. 
</P>
<P>
The statewide median price jumped to $196,097, up 2.5% from February and 27.2% 
from March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
If March's sales pace continues, 638,000 houses will have changed hands 
statewide by the end of the year, the trade group said. That's an 8.4% increase 
from February sales and a 20.7% jump from March, 1988. It was the biggest sales 
month since December, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The group tracks sales and prices of homes sold on the resale market by 
Realtors. Its median price figures exclude new homes and attached housing, such 
as condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
The California market in March was "dominated by home buyers making their 
purchase earlier than usual . . . to preempt higher mortgage rates," said Leo 
Saunders, a Walnut Creek Realtor and president of the statewide trade 
association. 
</P>
<P>
Interest on fixed-rate mortgages rose to an average 10.81% in early March, from 
10.79% in early February, the group said. Adjustable-rate mortgages rose to an 
average 9.27%, from 9.04%. Rates have continued to rise, with most fixed-rate 
loans now well above 11%. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County sales rose 9% in March from a year earlier, the trade group 
estimated. They were up 42.6% in San Francisco, 24.2% in San Diego and 5.1% in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the month's spurt, experts said this year's sales will probably be 
slower or about the same as last year's, and price increases will be smaller. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's market was so strong that many observers figured that it is due for 
a breather this year. March's moderate increase in prices appears to bear them 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Although the March sales figure in Orange County was up a whopping 61.5% from 
February, the trade group said the average for the first quarter shows no 
increase in sales from last year. 
</P>
<P>
Sales picked up in March as warmer weather heralded the arrival of the 
traditional home-buying season. That's not unusual; sales rise steeply every 
year from February to March. Last year they rose 37%. 
</P>
<P>
And it does not signal a return of last year's frenzied market, which pushed 
prices in the county to among the highest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"People who are trying to go for a new high price selling their house are 
definitely running into resistance," said Tom Baron, owner of a RE/MAX 
franchise in Irvine. "There are definitely buyers out there, but in many cases 
they're not willing to pay these prices." 
</P>
<P>
Compared with last year, when sellers often got multiple offers for their homes 
almost as soon as they hit the market, it now takes up to 2 months for most 
homes to sell in Irvine "if they're priced at where the market peaked last 
fall," Baron said. 
</P>
<P>
Higher interest rates could also put a crimp in the market. As rates rise, 
fewer people can qualify to make the mortgage payments, with the sky-high 
housing prices in many California markets already pricing many potential buyers 
out of the market. 
</P>
<P>
In the area covered by the East Orange County Board of Realtors, for instance, 
the number of families able to afford a typical resale house dropped 1.5 
percentage points to 25.5% during the month, the board reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The decline occurred even though the median price for such houses -- $195,000 
-- was unchanged from February in the cities covered by the board: Tustin, 
Orange, Santa Ana, Villa Park and Anaheim Hills. 
</P>
<P>
In Mission Viejo and Saddleback Valley, sales of houses priced at more than 
$350,000 are starting to slow, said Tom Cannon, a senior vice president at 
Grubb &amp; Ellis Co. 
</P>
<P>
Houses priced at less than $250,000 are still selling almost as fast as they 
were last year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the bigger and more expensive houses are not appreciating as quickly, so 
Cannon expects the average price increase for all types of houses to be much 
lower this year than in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you'll see about the same number of houses sold at the end of this 
year," Cannon said. "But prices? They won't go up nearly as much this year as 
they did last year." 
</P>
<P>
March's median price of $238,807, for instance, was up a whopping 25% from 
$191,191 in March, 1988. But the March price was up just 0.6% from February's 
$237,409, according to the Realtors association. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco area posted a much larger 3.2% gain in home prices during 
March and had the highest median resale home price in the state, $249,508. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles saw an even larger 5.7% price gain to hit a median of $210,029. And 
San Diego increased 4.8% to $166,984.

FEDS ASK OUSTER OF LAWYERS FOR AMERICAN CONTINENTAL

Federal regulators, battling the parent company of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, 
told a U.S. district court judge Monday in Phoenix that lawyers for American 
Continental Corp. should be removed from the case because of a conflict of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance 
Corp. filed papers asking the court to disqualify the Houston-based law firm of 
Sheinfeld, Maley &amp; Kay because it still represents FSLIC in a Texas court 
and knows the agency's litigation strategy. 
</P>
<P>
An American Continental lawyer also revealed that Beus, Gilbert, Wake &amp; 
Morrill, a Phoenix law firm helping Sheinfeld Maley, could have a similar 
problem because it represents the FDIC in the takeover of a Phoenix-based 
savings institution. Under President Bush's rescue plan for the S&amp;L 
industry, the FDIC is managing S&amp;Ls at which the FSLIC serves as 
conservator. 
</P>
<P>
"Having been advised of a potential conflict, and it appears well taken, I'd 
advise using other counsel," U.S. District Court Judge Paul G. Rosenblatt told 
attorneys for American Continental. His comment, however, was not a ruling. 
Lawyers will return to court Friday 
</P>
<P>
The loss of Sheinfeld Maley could be a blow to American Continental's own 
strategy. The law firm had helped the company devise the plan that included 
American's April 13 petition for bankruptcy reorganization. The company also 
put 11 Lincoln subsidiaries, but not the S&amp;L, in bankruptcy. Regulators 
seized Irvine-based Lincoln the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's arguments came in a suit American Continental filed to stop the 
regulators from removing officers and taking other actions at the 11 Lincoln 
subsidiaries in bankruptcy. The judge has ruled that the company can go to 
trial over the agencies' rights in operating the subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
In another motion filed Monday, attorneys for Star Bank in Cincinnati asked to 
intervene in American Continental's lawsuit. The bank represents about 11,000 
holders of American Continental bonds and notes, bank lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
FDIC attorneys said the agency will oppose Star Bank's motion.

CITY WOULD RATHER THE GRATEFUL DEAD WEREN'T RESURRECTED IN IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The passing of two decades has not stopped the '60s street carnival surrounding 
the Grateful Dead from rolling ever onward, turning each of the venerable rock 
band's tour stops into a miniature Haight-Ashbury. 
</P>
<P>
And what time itself has been unable to defeat, the city of Irvine has proven 
powerless to prevent. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are not happy that the Dead is returning this weekend to 
familiar haunts -- the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre -- where a 3-night stand 
beginning Friday will mark the sixth consecutive year that the Dead and its 
cult of hippie-throwback followers, the Deadheads, have convened festivities in 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
After last year's three-day stay left in its wake a raft of complaints about 
littering, unauthorized camping, trespassing and vandalism, as well as traffic 
problems and drug arrests, Irvine officials asked amphitheater management not 
to bring the Dead back again. 
</P>
<P>
But about 2 months ago, Irvine Meadows notified City Hall that the Dead would 
indeed be coming back. Amphitheater officials maintained that last year's 
problems should be prevented from happening again by beefed-up security, a ban 
on camping, and radio announcements and newspaper advertisements urging Dead 
fans without tickets to stay away from the sold-out shows. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Brady Jr., assistant city manager, said the city has no legal authority to 
stop Irvine Meadows from booking the Grateful Dead or any other act. But a 
majority of the City Council, after an informal straw poll, had him communicate 
its displeasure about further performances by the San Francisco band. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not sought to ban the event, which is not something that I would get 
involved in, (because) I happen to believe in the First Amendment and I take it 
very seriously," Mayor Larry Agran said last week. "But we aren't fools. We 
know what went on last year. We have a public safety problem. We prefer that 
they not return." 
</P>
<P>
With a typically (though not universally) scraggly uniform that might include 
sandals or bare feet, tie-dyed T-shirts or serapes, bandannas or unshorn hair, 
the Deadheads and their Woodstock-Nation ethos are virtually antithetical to 
the ideal of affluent and orderly suburban living that Irvine has come to stand 
for as one of the nation's leading planned communities. (The Grateful Dead, 
formed in 1965, is in fact a longer-running institution than the city of 
Irvine, incorporated in 1971.) 
</P>
<P>
But Agran said his opposition to the Dead playing Irvine is based strictly on 
public safety problems, and not on appearances or cultural values. 
</P>
<P>
"I could care less if people find the act or the followers offensive," the 
mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
Past visits by the Deadheads have brought complaints of a "general nuisance" 
variety, Agran said, but he is concerned that drug and alcohol use among Dead 
fans during an extended encampment in Irvine could set the stage for "damage of 
a tragic nature." 
</P>
<P>
In turn, amphitheater officials and the Grateful Dead's promoters are making 
changes this year in hopes of ending the troubles and complaints and restoring 
to the city's good graces a band whose annual sellouts are a financial linchpin 
for the Irvine Meadows season. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to great lengths to (prevent) what people see as a nuisance," said 
Bob Geddes, managing partner of Irvine Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
During last April's Dead shows at Irvine Meadows, police reported that cars 
parked along Irvine Center Drive and a press of campers waiting to get into the 
Irvine Meadows parking lot created tremendous traffic problems that forced them 
to close off traffic lanes several times. Preoccupied with traffic woes, the 
police said, they didn't go after drug busts. Over the course of the three-day 
stand, police made a total of 12 arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the difficulties, police said in a written report on the event, was 
the arrival of 2,000 to 3,000 fans without tickets, making it "more of a fair 
(than a concert), with . . . people arriving to absorb the atmosphere rather 
than listen to the music." 
</P>
<P>
The day after the last Dead show, Assistant City Manager Brady said, there were 
arrests made at an Irvine hotel after Deadheads congregated for a party that 
involved nude swimming and destruction of hotel furniture. Police also seized 
marijuana and $12,000 to $13,000 suspected of being drug money from a hotel 
room. 
</P>
<P>
Agran, Sally Anne Sheridan and Cameron Cosgrove were the three City Council 
members who asked Brady to put the council on record as opposing this weekend's 
Dead shows. The other members, Paula Werner and Edward Dornan, agree that the 
concerts pose "a burden on the city," Brady said, but "they don't feel the 
council should be passing judgment" about acts playing Irvine Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
There were few favorable judgments about the Deadheads to be found among 
business operators who suffered trespassing and property damage during last 
year's long weekend of the Dead. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Coffing, who owns a golf driving range and a storage lot for recreational 
vehicles on Irvine Center Drive, about a mile south of the amphitheater 
entrance, said that Dead fans had not caused serious problems for him until 
last year. Then they camped on his property, broke into RVs and slept in them, 
littered, urinated and defecated in the open, set fires, and created a traffic 
jam that forced him to close his business for 2 days. 
</P>
<P>
"We were an island surrounded by a sea of questionable humanity calling 
themselves followers of the rock group Grateful Dead," Coffing wrote in a 
letter of complaint to Agran. 
</P>
<P>
"There were probably 150 people at one time" camping on his 34-acre property 
without permission, Coffing said in an interview. "We were powerless to get any 
of them off of here. We found syringes, all kinds of (drug) paraphernalia." 
</P>
<P>
Coffing said that the rock fans who left him feeling besieged were "not the 
true 1960s types that followed the Grateful Dead for years," but members of a 
younger generation of Deadheads. 
</P>
<P>
Michi Henley, who works at a strawberry and vegetable stand near Coffing's 
property, said it lost business and suffered a nighttime break-in during the 
Dead's stay last year. 
</P>
<P>
"They got into our shortcakes. They helped themselves like little squirrels," 
she said. "They come in here and use our facilities, and they use our hoses to 
wash their hair (without permission). We just don't care to have them around -- 
my personal opinion." 
</P>
<P>
Murai Farms, which grows strawberries and vegetables on 150 acres bordering 
amphitheater property, also reported trespassing, theft and vandalism by Dead 
followers. 
</P>
<P>
"They're out there to have a good time, and they'll do whatever it takes to do 
it," said Dick Miller, farm foreman, recalling his fruitless attempts last year 
to persuade Deadheads to stay out of the strawberry fields. Besides stealing 
and trampling crops, Miller said, Dead fans set fire to three farm trucks, 
resulting in extensive damage. "It seems like it gets worse each year. There 
are more and more of them coming," said Miller, who didn't have any problems 
with Deadheads the first few years that the band played Irvine Meadows. No 
other shows at Irvine Meadows present problems for the farm, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For this year's Dead stint, amphitheater security staff members will be posted 
starting Wednesday morning to turn away would-be campers at the gate. They will 
hand out leaflets directing the Deadheads to motels and public campsites such 
as Doheny State Beach. Bob Geddes of Irvine Meadows said it was a mistake to 
allow camping on amphitheater grounds the past 2 years, because the caravan of 
Deadheads spilled into the surrounding neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Meadows security also will be stationed in front of neighboring property 
to prevent trespassing, according to Matt Curto, the amphitheater's director of 
operations. Geddes said the amphitheater will spend more than $100,000 for 
security over the weekend. Amphitheater security and Irvine police will be 
poised to call in towing companies to get rid of illegally parked cars. 
</P>
<P>
The Dead's own fan communications network also is doing its part to address 
last year's problems, said Bob Barsotti, a concert manager for Bill Graham 
Presents, which handles the Dead's West Coast concert promotion (the Irvine 
Meadows shows are a co-promotion between Graham and the amphitheater's regular 
promoter, Avalon Attractions). 
</P>
<P>
"We are doing a tremendous amount more than we have ever done in the past to 
alleviate problems. We really tried to mount a campaign to educate the 
Deadheads to the problems there and hopefully come up with some solutions," 
Barsotti said. Jerry Garcia, the Grateful Dead's lead guitarist and resident 
countercultural hero, has recorded radio announcements urging fans not to camp 
or park in the area, and to stay away if they don't have tickets. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to concert behavior, Geddes said, the Dead followers, known for 
their mellow attitude, are less of a problem than most rock fans. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a lot more emphasis put on the way people look than the way 
people act," he said of Irvine opposition to the Dead's return. "The pressure 
is really on us this year to demonstrate that we can do this properly, and I 
think we can," said Paul Hegness, an Irvine Meadows partner. "The pressure is 
on the fans to see if they can act responsibly. If things don't go well, 
there's a good chance they won't see their favorite band back in Orange 
County."

'DON'T DRINK WATER' PROVIDES TOO FEW LAUGHS FOR THIS CAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are still people who think Woody Allen's earlier movies (and the plays 
some of them were based on) are his funniest works. 
</P>
<P>
They'll take "Sleeper" over "Annie Hall," "Play It Again, Sam" before 
"Manhattan" and "Take the Money and Run" over "Hannah and Her Sisters." 
Different styles for different smiles. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't Drink the Water," currently revived at the San Clemente Community 
Theater, argues for those who prefer the later stuff. The comedy, first 
produced for the stage in 1966, shows how far Allen has come. 
</P>
<P>
This loopy story of a New Jersey family forced to hide in an American Embassy 
behind the Iron Curtain after being mistaken for spies does have a few nifty 
lines and scenes. Even a couple of super ones. But it also has more than its 
share of corn and contrivance. 
</P>
<P>
Director Caren Ross and her cast do reasonably well when the jokes are on, but 
don't always have the necessary timing to make the middling ones work and 
certainly not enough to plump up the flat ones. The production provides laughs, 
especially in the punchier, better-written first act, but it's a hit-and-miss 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the giggles come when Marge Anderson's Marion and Joe Abrams' Walter 
are on stage. This "Don't Drink the Water" tends to work better when these two 
go at it, arguing either with each other or with Axel Magee (John Brennan), the 
incredibly ineffectual diplomat's son who tries to steer them through this 
international mess. 
</P>
<P>
Walter is among the first in a long line of Allen complainers. His job may be 
catering weddings and bar mitzvahs, but his hobby is full-tilt kvetching. 
Everything annoys him and everything is a target for his fast-talking sarcasm. 
He's ready to take anybody on, whether it's the embassy's swishy chef or the 
local Luger-toting KGB man. 
</P>
<P>
But "Don't Drink the Water," despite the locale, is really a domestic comedy, 
so it's Marion whom he takes on most of the time. She's a worthy adversary too, 
especially through Anderson's spunky interpretation. Anderson and Abrams almost 
make this show click. 
</P>
<P>
Well, almost. In the end, it's a case of minor-league Woody Allen being handled 
in a pretty routine way. 
</P>
<P>

COURAGE AND BEAUTY EMERGE FROM CRUELTY OF HOLOCAUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jan Herman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From 1942 to 1944, about 15,000 Jewish children passed through Terezin, a Nazi 
concentration camp in Czechoslovakia. It was set up as a way station or "model" 
camp to be shown to the Red Cross and visiting dignitaries before the children 
were sent on to the gas chambers of Auschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
Forcibly separated from their parents, they spent as much as 2 years in the 
barracks at Terezin -- euphemistically termed "children's homes." There they 
subsisted on a prison diet and received schooling clandestinely from the camp's 
few adults, who encouraged them to write and to draw. Then, one by one, their 
Nazi captors chose them for deportation and execution. 
</P>
<P>
None of the children were more than 15 years old. Only 100 survived. One was 
Raja Englanderova, a teen-age girl who is the central figure in Celeste 
Raspanti's stage adaptation of "I Never Saw Another Butterfly." The play is 
based on writings by the children of Terezin, which have been preserved in a 
permanent exhibition in Prague and as a book with the same title. 
</P>
<P>
Presented over the weekend at the Moulton Theatre in Laguna Beach by the Laguna 
Playhouse Youth Theatre, "Butterfly" was an act of remembrance. While not 
exactly religious, its performance seemed nonetheless sacred. "The heaviest 
wheel rolls across our foreheads to bury itself deep within our memories," a 
chorus intoned. It might have been a ritual elegy. 
</P>
<P>
Themes of loss and despair naturally dominate the play, which takes place in 
Raja's memory in 1946 and is set on a stark gray stage occasionally enhanced by 
dramatic lighting and photographic projections of the actual children of the 
camp. "Goodby -- it was the motto of Terezin," Raja says bitterly. "It should 
have been written above the gate instead of 'Work Makes Us Free.' " 
</P>
<P>
Yet Raja (Jennifer Triebwasser) is not without hope. "I learned the word 
courage," she recounts, "and found the determination to live, to believe in 
life." It is not entirely persuasive when she says this in the first act, if 
only because she has been so traumatized that simply to repeat her name to 
herself "was an achievement." 
</P>
<P>
But by the second act we believe her when she says in a triumphant curtain 
speech: "My name is Raja. I am a Jew. I survived Terezin, not alone and not 
afraid." Indeed, her transformation from despairing victim to defiant survivor 
carries symbolic meaning for all victims of the Holocaust as well as the rest 
of us. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most affecting scene occurs after Raja's best friend has received 
her deportation number and is packed off by train with other doomed camp 
prisoners. "Where did Renka go?" she asks her teacher, Irena (Lisa Hale), 
without waiting for a reply. "To Auschwitz. She won't be coming back. You die 
in Auschwitz. You think because we're children we don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Irena, unable to console Raja, reveals her own terrible story: how her 
9-year-old daughter was torn from her arms and thrown from a train; how she was 
prevented from jumping off the train after her; how she has found in Terezin 
"many children" who need her love. It is an extraordinary moment and manages to 
avoid histrionics. 
</P>
<P>
As directed by Scott Davidson, "Butterfly" provides both the child actors and 
the audience a dramatic history lesson. Its timeliness is readily apparent in 
the recent spate of movies and novels about the Holocaust -- not to mention the 
fact that Hitler was born 100 years ago last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want people to know the characters (we play) were real people," Josh 
Wheeler, an eighth-grader in the Laguna troupe, told the audience at a 
post-performance discussion of "Butterfly" on Sunday. Nothing was closer to the 
truth of the play nor more fitting as a memorial to victims of the Holocaust. 
</P>

BUSH LAUDS DRUG FIGHT IN SPEECH AT SEIZED HIDEAWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By STEVEN R. CHURM, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Underscoring a major theme of his Administration, President Bush traveled to a 
former drug smuggling hideaway in Orange County today to hand law enforcement 
officials more than $4 million in cash to aid their battle against drug 
trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
"Rancho del Rio has been reclaimed," Bush said in a speech to an 
invitation-only audience of 1,300 guests at the remote canyon ranch east of San 
Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the ranch, Bush said, "This operation had commercial packing 
equipment, underground storage vaults, large vans with hidden compartments, jet 
aircraft and ocean-going vessels. 
</P>
<P>
"Once a warehouse of death, now it is a source of hope." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have alleged that the ranch, a luxurious canyon hideaway, was once 
used as a transit point for thousands of pounds of marijuana and hundreds of 
pounds of cocaine.

The President said the ranch will become an international training center for 
narcotics enforcement. He said it will serve as a reminder to drug traffickers 
that "your money won't help you. In fact, we're going to use it against you." 
</P>
<P>
Bush described Orange County as "one of the largest and toughest drug markets 
in the country." Despite that reputation, local law enforcement officials have 
refused to give up the fight and have become an example "of hope, determination 
and the American spirit," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush pointed to Orange County Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates and the Rev. Robert 
Schuller as leaders of the local effort to combat drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The President, noting the power and influence of Hollywood, called upon the 
entertainment industry to take a bigger role in the war on drugs. He said the 
entertainment industry has done much, but "you can do more. You must do more."

Bush arrived at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station at 11:30 a.m. aboard Air Force 
One. He had spent the morning in the San Francisco Bay Area touring a Ford 
Motor Co. aerospace plant. 
</P>
<P>
Five minutes after his arrival at El Toro, Bush boarded a small Marine 
helicopter for the 20-minute flight to the isolated ranch, which is accessible 
only by air or a four-mile dirt road. The ranch is near the junction of Orange, 
San Diego and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was to spend 90 minutes at the ranch, touring the hideaway, having lunch 
with drug enforcement officials and agents, and then speaking to the invited 
guests.

President Bush said today that critics "couldn't be more wrong" when they call 
his proposed cut in capital gains taxes "a tax break for the rich." 
</P>
<P>
Rather, he said, that proposal and other new investment incentives are needed 
to help America compete in the global economy. Bush, in a speech to managers 
and employees at Ford Aerospace's Space Systems Division here, took note of the 
criticism of his proposal in Congress and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, they couldn't be more wrong," he said. "Lower capital gains taxes will 
create jobs for those who don't have jobs and help build a better America." 
</P>
<P>
Capital gains taxes are levied on the profits that businesses and individuals 
make on investments. Bush wants to cut the 33% maximum tax on capital gains to 
15% and to exempt entirely the gains accrued by people with incomes under 
$10,000 a year.

SLIDE CLOSES OLD COAST HIGHWAY

<P>
A landslide this morning toppled 150 cubic yards of dirt onto the two 
northbound lanes of Old Coast Highway in Capistrano Beach, closing both lanes 
to traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol said no one was injured in the 8:40 a.m. slide at 
Palisades Road, but the dirt covered the 24-foot width of the two lanes and 
some of the shoulder road. 
</P>
<P>
A CHP officer in San Juan Capistrano said landslides at that site are not 
uncommon. "It's not a very solid hillside. It's mostly clay and loosely packed 
dirt that can give at any time," he said. "There are railroad tracks down 
there, and they're always vibrating that area." 
</P>
<P>
CHP and San Clemente police officers diverted drivers along a two-mile stretch 
of the highway from Palisades Road to Camino Capistrano. Workers were expected 
to have the dirt removed by the afternoon.

<P>
Los Angeles school board member Julie Korenstein agreed today to face-to-face 
debates with challenger Gerald E. Horowitz before the June 6 runoff election, 
her campaign manager said. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz, the principal of Byrd Junior High School in Sun Valley, challenged 
Korenstein to a series of five debates next month on topics such as district 
finances, the ongoing contract dispute with teachers, and campus violence. But 
Parke Skelton, Korenstein's campaign consultant, said the West Valley incumbent 
will probably not agree to more than one or two debates and does not want a 
limit on the topics to be debated. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz set a Wednesday deadline to arrange the details of the debate. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein fell 57 votes short of the 50% plus one vote majority needed to win 
the April 11 primary election. She was elected in 1987 to fill the two years 
remaining in former board member David Armor's term.

CHENEY CUTS $10 BILLION IN 'HARD CHOICES' AT PENTAGON

Defense Secretary Dick Cheney today detailed his $10 billion in Pentagon budget 
cuts and said the "hard choices" included reductions in dozens of weapons 
systems, a $1-billion slash in Star Wars research money and 16,800 military 
manpower cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, making his first appearance as defense secretary before his former 
colleagues in the House, told the Armed Services Committee that only the Marine 
Corps had been spared manpower cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"No program was excluded from consideration during the budget adjustment 
process," Cheney told the House panel at the start of what was expected to be a 
daylong hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"But my top priorities are quality people, forward strategy, readiness and 
sustainability, efficient procurement and strategic modernization. The 
adjustments we made to the budget were implemented within this context." 
</P>
<P>
Under the budget agreement reached earlier this spring between the Bush 
Administration and Congress, the Pentagon is required to cut spending plans by 
$10 billion for the next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said that in making the budget changes, "not only did we have to make 
hard choices, but we also had to make sure that they were the right choices." 
</P>
<P>
Funding for Star Wars research has been cut by $1 billion to a new total of 
$4.6 billion for fiscal 1990, Cheney said.

AFFIRMATIVE ACTION CRITIC NOMINATED FOR TOP CIVIL RIGHTS POST

<P>
President Bush today nominated William Lucas, a black Republican critic of 
affirmative action, as the Justice Department's civil rights chief, setting up 
a potentially bruising Senate confirmation fight. 
</P>
<P>
The previously announced opposition to Lucas by the NAACP, the nation's largest 
civil rights group, could energize liberal opposition to the nominee. 
</P>
<P>
NAACP Executive Director Benjamin L. Hooks said in a statement Monday that 
Lucas is not qualified to be the government's chief enforcer of civil rights 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
The White House formally announced Lucas' selection as assistant attorney 
general in charge of the Justice Department's civil rights division in a 
one-sentence statement issued in San Jose, where Bush had spent the night. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pushed by Thornburgh 
</P>
<P>
Lucas had been pushed for the job by Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Thornburgh called Lucas "a talented, decent and compassionate 
person whom I have known for a number of years." 
</P>
<P>
"Bill Lucas is fully committed to the vigorous and fair enforcement of our 
country's civil rights laws and to removing barriers to equal opportunity for 
all our citizens," Thornburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
People for the American Way, a well-financed liberal lobbying group, joined 
Hooks in expressing reservations about Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas "is someone with no track record and a lot of question marks," said the 
group's president, Arthur J. Kropp. 
</P>
<P>
"The questions will have to be resolved before the civil rights community can 
support him," said Kropp, who heads a 270,000-member organization that helped 
defeat Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department spokeswoman Deborah Burstion-Wade said opposition by the 
National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People "doesn't change a thing 
for us." 
</P>
<P>
Lucas has been criticized by several civil rights leaders since Thornburgh 
revealed in February that he had urged Bush to nominate him for the position. 
</P>
<P>
The 61-year-old Lucas, a former sheriff and executive of Wayne County, ran 
unsuccessfully as the GOP's nominee for Michigan governor in 1986. A former 
Democrat, Lucas has been considered for other federal positions in the Bush 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Civil rights leaders have cited Lucas' record as sheriff to demonstrate their 
view that he is not qualified to run a Justice Department division responsible 
for prosecuting local police for brutality. 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, Lucas was held legally responsible by a federal appeals court for 
failure to investigate allegations that a prisoner was beaten while in the 
custody of sheriff's deputies. Lucas said he was unaware of the allegations at 
the time, but the court found he had failed to institute training procedures to 
prevent brutality by his deputies. 
</P>
<P>
That same year, Lucas was cited for contempt of court for failing to reduce 
overcrowding and improve conditions at the county jail. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas' claim on an old resume that he served as an assistant U.S. attorney in 
the Justice Department's civil rights division during the early 1960s has also 
sparked controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas actually worked as a legal assistant and resigned after he failed the 
District of Columbia Bar examination.

At Philadelphia International Airport, the ticket line was 30 deep at

EMPLOYER COST INDEX RISES 1.2%; BENEFITS IN THE LEAD

<P>
The cost of wages, salaries and benefits to the nation's employers rose 1.2% in 
the first quarter of 1989, with increases in benefits costs again outpacing pay 
gains, the Labor Department reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The employment cost index report showed that for the 12 months ended March 31, 
the cost of wages, salaries and benefits rose 4.8%, down slightly from the 5% 
average for calendar 1988 but up significantly from 1987's 3.6% increase. 
</P>
<P>
The index measures changes in an employers' costs for all forms of 
compensation, principally wages and salaries and such employer-paid benefits as 
health insurance. It is closely watched as a barometer of inflation, 
particularly in the last year, as analysts have speculated that the tight labor 
market would drive up compensation costs because of increased competition for 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts disagreed over whether the figures signaled a faster pace of wage 
gains and therefore increased inflationary pressure on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"The numbers are reasonably favorable, and there are no signs of wage 
acceleration," said Michael Evans, president of a Washington economic 
forecasting firm. "Except for the one sore spot of rising health care costs . . 
. I think the figures show wage gains continue to be stable and no signs of 
rapid acceleration." 
</P>
<P>
But economist Roger Brinner at Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass., said 
the report indicated that labor costs are "creeping up." He predicted that the 
annual rate of employer cost increases, which would be 4.5% if the 
first-quarter numbers held throughout the year, would climb to 5% and possibly 
to 5.5% over the next year. 
</P>
<P>
"With unemployment down to almost 5%, workers feel that they can ask for their 
normal share, which is the sum of inflation and productivity," Brinner said. 
Inflation on U.S.-produced goods is about 4.5% and productivity gains have been 
in the 1% to 1.5% range.

Orders to U.S. factories for big-ticket durable goods rose a moderate 0.8% in 
March after two months of big declines, reflecting a rebound in orders for 
transportation equipment, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
Orders rose to a seasonally adjusted $124.9 billion last month after dropping 
3.6% in January and 2.8% in February, the first back-to-back declines in three 
years, the Commerce Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile transportation category, which rose 10.4% but is subject 
to wide swings depending on when contracts are signed, orders were down for the 
third straight month in March, declining 2.8%. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of government reports on economic activity this year, including those 
covering durable goods, have suggested that the economy may be slowing down as 
the expansion extends into its seventh year.

The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index rose sharply today, but the dollar fell 
against the yen after Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita announced that he will 
resign as soon as the Diet (Parliament) approves the fiscal 1989 budget. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar closed at 131.17 yen, down 0.21 yen from Monday's 131.38-yen finish. 
It opened at 131.65 yen, its high for the day, and ranged as low as 131.05 yen. 
</P>
<P>
"The dollar started higher following its weak note on overseas markets, where 
the yen was sold, but Japanese investors concertedly bought the (yen) following 
news about Mr. Takeshita's resignation," said an analyst with a commercial bank 
in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Investors believed that Takeshita's departure would eliminate some political 
and economic tensions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Takeshita has been linked with a company at the center of a stock-profiteering 
and bribery scandal, and opposition parties have been boycotting budget 
deliberations in Parliament to demand that the government clear up the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been speculation of some more arrests of politicians, but the 
majority expects that things would not worsen," the analyst added.

STATES MAY TAX FIRMS ON INDIAN RESERVATION OIL, JUSTICES RULE

<P>
The Supreme Court ruled today that states may tax companies for oil and gas 
taken from Indian reservations. 
</P>
<P>
Voting 6 to 3, the justices handed Western states an important victory in 
upholding a New Mexico tax on oil and gas taken from the Jicarilla Apache 
reservation there. 
</P>
<P>
The court said the state levy does not trample on Indian rights and is not 
unfair to a petroleum company -- even though the company must pay taxes to both 
the state and the tribe. 
</P>
<P>
The court rejected arguments that the state tax interferes with tribal economic 
development by prompting producers to look off Indian reservations for mineral 
deposits. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico officials told the court that the dispute is of great concern in the 
West. They said there are more than 150 cases of companies with deposits on 
Indian land protesting such double taxation in Arizona, New Mexico, Montana and 
Utah.

Sales of cars and light trucks made by the nation's Big Three auto makers rose

Incentive Packages 
</P>
<P>
The companies have been banking that incentives announced at the end of March 
and in early April would entice customers into showrooms and help pull the 
industry out of a lower-than-expected sales slump during the first three months 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, March and April sales are robust, but they failed to live up to that 
billing last month, hence the incentives. 
</P>
<P>
For the first 20 days of April, Big Three car sales were up 12.1% and truck 
sales were running 15.6% ahead of last year's pace. Since Jan. 1, car sales by 
the Big Three were down 8.4% and truck sales were off 1.2% contrasted with last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mid-April Sales Up 14.5% 
</P>
<P>
Ford said its mid-April car sales were running 14.5% ahead of last year's pace, 
going to a daily rate of 8,348 this year from 7,292 during the period last 
year. So far in 1989, Ford's car sales were running 1.1% ahead of last year's 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
Truck sales by Ford were up 4.9% during the 10-day period this year and were 
down 2.4% for the calendar year. 
</P>
<P>
GM reported a 1.5% decrease in its mid-April car sales, with a daily rate of 
12,296 this year, contrasted with 12,483 last year. So far this year, GM has 
sold 11% fewer cars than last year. 
</P>
<P>
GM's light truck sales were up 14.7% in mid-April and down 2.4% so far this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler said its average daily car sales rate fell to 3,374 during mid-April 
this year, a 10.3% decline from the 3,760 rate during the period last year. Car 
sales by the nation's No. 3 auto maker for the year were running 18.2% behind 
last year's pace. 
</P>
<P>
Truck sales by Chrysler during the period were 7.1% above the mid-April pace 
last year, and for the entire year were 2.6% ahead of last year.

<P>
Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s first-quarter profit was 50% below last year's 
level, the company reported today, but the difference was attributed to 
one-time gains from a stock sale and a pension fund in the earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based Occidental said it earned $67 million, or 24 cents a share, 
in the first quarter, down from $113 million, or 52 cents a share, a year 
earlier. Sales were $5.14 billion, up from $4.48 billion in the first quarter 
of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding one-time items, first-quarter profit would have been about 50% above 
last year's level, said Armand Hammer, Occidental's chairman and chief 
executive. Operating profit was $394 million, down from $436 million a year 
earlier.

A seal of approval for computers that interconnect easily with other makes -- 
the COS Mark -- was announced Tuesday by an influential group of computer 
makers and users. 
</P>
<P>
Big computer buyers led by General Motors Corp. and the federal government 
demanded such a program because of dissatisfaction with the existing cacophony 
in communications between computers.

Team USA closed out the preliminary round of the World Hockey Championships 
with a 6-1 victory over Poland today, but possibly lost its goaltender for the 
rest of the tourney with an injury. 
</P>
<P>
John Vanbiesbrouck, who plays for the New York Rangers, was removed to a 
hospital with a suspected broken jaw after being hit by the puck early in the 
second period. 
</P>
<P>
Vanbiesbrouck was struck in the lower part of his face mask when a Polish shot 
deflected off his stick. The accident occurred about six minutes into the 
second period during a Polish power play. 
</P>
<P>
Team USA already had one player sidelined with an injury. Last Friday, 
defenseman Phil Housley had torn collarbone ligaments in a 7-4 win over West 
Germany and has not played since. 
</P>
<P>
Vanbiesbrouck was replaced in goal by two-time All-American Robb Stauber of the 
University of Minnesota, who shut out the Poles the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Team USA completed the preliminary round-robin portion of the tourney with a 
2-1-4 won-tied-lost record. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans play Poland again in the first relegation group game on 
Wednesday. The last-placed team drops to the B championships next year. 
</P>
<P>
Team Canada faces defending world champion Sweden, and the unbeaten Soviets, 
7-0, play Czechoslovakia in the opening medal round games Thursday.

HLASEK AND 3 OTHER SEEDS ELIMINATED FROM TOURNEY

Fourth-seed Jakob Hlasek of Switzerland and three other seeded players were 
eliminated today at the $607,500 Monte Carlo Open tennis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Argentine Martin Jaite, who lost in last year's finals of this tournament to 
Ivan Lendl, beat Hlasek 6-4, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
The two top seeds advanced in rainy conditions. Mats Wilander of Sweden beat 
wild-card Diego Nargiso of Italy, 7-6 (7-4), 6-1 and Boris Becker of West 
Germany topped Lawson Duncan 6-4, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Sixth-seeded Henri Leconte of France withdrew during his match against Patrick 
Kuhnen of West Germany. Kuhnen was leading 6-3, 3-2 when Leconte decided to 
abandon the match because of a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
In other second-round matches, Marcelo Filippini of Uruguay beat 15th-seeded 
Mark Woodforde of Australia 7-5, 6-1 and Jan Gunnarsson of Sweden eliminated 
the 11th seed, Slobodan Zivojinoviv of Yugoslavia, 6-4, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Hlasek said he knew he would be in for a difficult match. 
</P>
<P>
"I was prepared for a tough match because I haven't played a match on clay in 
eight months and he's already played a few tournaments, including yesterday," 
Hlasek said. "I played very badly and made it easy for him to beat me." 
</P>
<P>
Nargiso, who lives here, served for the first set at 6-5. But Wilander held him 
off, won the tiebreaker 7-4 and romped in the second set 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to practice for a few weeks and then play your first match," 
Wilander said. He won three of the four Grand Slam tournaments last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just happy I won," Wilander added. "To play on clay is such a mental game, 
and you have to be fresh." 
</P>
<P>
Becker, a two-time Wimbledon champion, had an easy time against Duncan. In the 
last two years of this tournament, Becker lost in his first match. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost like winning the entire tournament," Becker said. "It was very 
special for me." 
</P>
<P>
Ninth-seeded Jonas Svensson of Sweden survived a scare against Thierry Tulasne 
of France. Svensson overcame a 5-2 deficit in the third set to win 6-7 (5-7), 
6-3, 7-5.

NAVRATILOVA DROPS OUT OF THE FRENCH OPEN

<P>
Martina Navratilova, the No. 2 women's tennis player in the world, has pulled 
out of the French Open, one of the Grand Slam tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Cecile Caradec, press spokeswoman for French Federation of Tennis, which runs 
the tournament, said the FFT received the official notice from the Women's 
International Tennis Assn. this morning. 
</P>
<P>
No specific reason was given for the withdrawal by Navratilova, the winner of 
18 Grand Slams, including the French Open twice. 
</P>
<P>
But federation sources said the 32-year-old American, who has not missed a 
Grand Slam event in nine years, had pulled out because she wanted to avoid clay 
courts to sharpen her grass game before Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova lost the Wimbledon title last year to West German Steffi Graf after 
winning it the previous six years and is concentrating on avenging that defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova relies on a power game and serve-and-volley tactics, better suited 
for fast surfaces like grass. 
</P>
<P>
The French Open, scheduled for May 29-June 11, is played on the slow, red clay 
courts of Roland Garros Stadium in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova won the French Open in 1982 and 1984 and reached the final in 1975, 
1985, 1986 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
She lost the 1987 French Open to Graf, the first Grand Slam tournament Graf 
won. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova lost in the third round of the French Open in 1988 to eventual 
finalist, Natalia Zvereva of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova owns a 7-4 mark over Graf in tournament play but is 0-2 on clay. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Graf and Navratilova met in an exhibition on clay in Monte Carlo and 
Graf beat Navratilova, 6-3, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova lost her No. 1 ranking in August, 1987, to Graf, who won the Grand 
Slam and the Olympic gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova had complained about being mentally tired from a heavy schedule of 
exhibitions and tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
The Women's International Tennis Assn. in Miami said Navratilova would probably 
take a break of almost two months from the game because she was "readjusting 
her schedule." 
</P>
<P>
Robin Reynolds, a spokeswoman for WITA, could not confirm that Navratilova had 
decided to skip clay court events to hone her skills for Wimbledon but did note 
that her next appearance would probably be on grass. 
</P>
<P>
"Birmingham will probably be her next tournament," Reynolds said, referring to 
the $150,000 event to be held on grass in central England beginning June 12, 
two weeks before the start of Wimbledon.
