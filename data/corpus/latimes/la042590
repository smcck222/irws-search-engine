ENCINITAS CALLS FOR EMERGENCY MIGRANT HELP 
</P>

<P>
The City Council on Tuesday night made this the first community in California 
to declare a state of local emergency after failing to independently solve its 
migrant laborer problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's obvious that this is a situation well beyond our ability to 
control," City Manager Warren Shafer told the council. "We're looking to call 
attention and get the support of the players who have an opportunity to get 
something done here." 
</P>
<P>
The declaration calls for the federal government to allot more resources to the 
U.S. Border Patrol and Immigration and Naturalization Service as well as 
provide jobs, education and emergency housing for an estimated 800 to 1,500 
homeless migrants living within its city limits. 
</P>
<P>
The document also calls on Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside) and the rest of the 
San Diego congressional delegation to conduct hearings in San Diego County on 
how the immigration flow from Mexico and Latin America is affecting the region. 
</P>
<P>
Among a list of 21 reasons for calling a state of emergency was the constant 
presence of undocumented workers who solicit work from parking lots and street 
corners, "creating traffic congestion, safety hazards, litter and disrupting 
business." 
</P>
<P>
Of particular concern are more than 680 Guatemalan refugees granted permission 
to live in the United States while seeking political asylum, but who cannot yet 
legally join the work force, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, many of the Guatemalans had camped behind a Big Bear market, 
but the city recently enacted security patrols to drive them away. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, Encinitas' five City Council members took turns criticizing 
the federal government's immigration policies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious to me the U.S. government by its actions in Central America and 
by its omission in not defining its border policy has created a no-border 
policy," said Councilman Rick Shea. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is dumbfounded by federal plans to increase the number of lanes at 
the San Onofre check point rather than committing its resources to the San 
Ysidro border crossing. 
</P>
<P>
That decision, he said, put the North County in a precarious position. 
</P>
<P>
"We're living in some sort of DMZ -- somewhere between an imaginary border and 
a concrete border," he said. "The federal government's policies have created 
great numbers of poor people wandering from city to city in the North County. A 
state of emergency does exist. I'd like to accomplish one simple thing here 
tonight to get the federal government to do their job so we can do ours." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, however, several council members doubted that the city can 
get the attention of the entire Congress over what many representatives 
consider to be a regional issue. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying anything we can," said Gloria Carranza, the city's transients 
issue coordinator who co-authored the resolution. "We're hoping to call 
attention and increase public awareness in places we haven't reached yet, 
namely much of Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the Congress to hold hearings in the North County to see for 
themselves just what impact this immigration is having on the entire 
Southwest." 
</P>
<P>
John Weil, an aide to Rep. Packard, delivered a prepared statement from the 
politician. 
</P>
<P>
"Without question, our region is one of the hardest hit by immigration in the 
country. This issue has plagued Southern California for decades, and had defied 
our best efforts to solve it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Migrants with no place to live and no place to go have strained local 
resources. And, at the same time, they have gained the sympathies of the 
residents of our district -- myself included." 
</P>
<P>
Packard explained in the statement that he had been assured by immigration 
officials that 200 new Border Patrol agents had been requested and many of them 
would be assigned to San Diego, in proportion with the area's needs. 
</P>
<P>
But he also had a warning for Encinitas officials in declaring a local state of 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
"Congress has shown little or no interest in addressing this as a serious 
national problem," he said. "Rather, many members believe this is a regional 
problem, to be addressed at the local level. 
</P>
<P>
"I ask that, whatever actions you decide to take, you try to coordinate them 
with the rest of the North County cities. Congress is more inclined to focus 
attention on North County's plight if the cities present a unified front, 
showing that the damage to the area is widespread." 
</P>
<P>
Money or no money, several residents who addressed the council said they are 
primed for action. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time for the council to bite the bullet. Enough time has passed," said 
Diane Fradin, vice president of the board of directors of the Encinitas 
community called Country View Collections. 
</P>
<P>
More than 2 dozen people rose as Fradin waved her hand to the audience, asking 
for a show of all those in favor of the declaration. 
</P>
<P>
June Bello added: "While we've been sitting around discussing the issue 
applying our little Band-Aids, this situation has worsened. The time for action 
is now. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, a rising tide of Third World immigrants has crossed the U.S. 
border, many settling at least temporarily in the North County, where their 
makeshift encampments sit in contrast to newly built mini-malls and affluent 
housing developments. 
</P>
<P>
Although nearby cities in Orange County such as Costa Mesa, Laguna Beach and 
Dana Point have also struggled with a migrant presence, none have experienced 
the widespread encampments or the litter and sewage problems of Encinitas, 
Carranza said. 
</P>
<P>
The state of emergency might eventually bring state and federal funds for 
housing and educational programs aimed at documented migrant workers, Carranza 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman for the state's Office of Emergency Services said earlier 
Tuesday he knows of no available money for the city's migrant problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We normally deal with identifiable natural disasters, but this is something 
entirely new," said Regional Manager Jim Alexander from his San Bernardino 
County office. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been looking for funding sources, but I can't find them. Maybe they can 
go to some state and federal housing programs for the homeless. But personally, 
I think it's a long shot." 
</P>
<P>
Migrant advocates on Tuesday called the state of emergency declaration more 
rhetoric from a city that's offered much talk and little action. 
</P>
<P>
"This declaration is, to say the least, suspect," said Claudia Smith, an 
attorney for California Rural Legal Assistance, a migrant rights group. "The 
city hasn't met even a threshold obligation to help bring its migrant residents 
out of their miserable living conditions. They just can't seem to get past the 
hand-wringing stage."

The City Council on Tuesday night took the first step toward providing a hiring 
hall for migrant workers. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted, 5-0, to explore using county land near Palomar Airport Road 
and El Camino Real for the hall. The vote also launched a political effort to 
involve all cities in North County to seek a regional solution to the migrant 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the council called for a Thursday special session to consider 
supporting a community group's bid for $700,000 in state and federal grants to 
build temporary shelter in Carlsbad. RAY TESSLER

SIMI VALLEY TO FUND WATER RECYCLING STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Simi Valley City Council wants to know if millions of gallons of treated 
sewer water now being dumped into the Arroyo Simi can be recycled and sold for 
agricultural and industrial uses. 
</P>
<P>
The council, acting as the Simi Valley Sanitation District Board of Directors, 
voted 4 to 0 Monday night to spend $30,000 to hire an engineering firm to 
determine if a reclamation program is economical. 
</P>
<P>
The study is expected to take four months once a contract has been awarded. It 
will be funded with district money from the 1989-90 budget, city officials 
said. The study will determine the cost of reclaiming the water, the amount of 
revenue that would be generated by the reclamation program and how it will be 
funded, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Vicky Howard, who has been pushing for the study, said using the 
water to irrigate schoolyards, golf courses and fields would help ease the 
city's water shortage. The reclamation program also would generate an 
undetermined amount of money for the city, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a viable program," Howard said. "We have to utilize the water 
that's coming into the area and being wasted. The water coming from the 
sanitation treatment plant is relatively good water and could be used for 
agricultural, industrial and recreational uses." 
</P>
<P>
About 9 million gallons of treated sewer water per day is dumped into the 
Arroyo Simi, which serves as a flood-control channel, said Ronald C. Coons, 
director of the city Public Works Department. That water could be recycled and 
used for various irrigation programs, Coons said. 
</P>
<P>
While not suitable for drinking, reclaimed water could be used to irrigate golf 
courses, landscaped freeway medians, schoolyards and certain agricultural 
fields, as well as for industrial and commercial landscaping, Coons said. 
</P>
<P>
Waste Management Inc., operator of the Simi Valley Landfill, has already 
expressed interest in using reclaimed water if a program is implemented. 
</P>
<P>
"The water would be used for truck washing and irrigation of landscaping for 
aesthetics and erosion control," said Mike Williams, general manager of Waste 
Management. "It would be a significant savings for us and for sure be a better 
way to go as far as resources." 
</P>
<P>
Coons said the city conducted a waste-water reclamation study in 1979. That 
study found that more than $10.2 million would be needed to implement a 
reclamation program, which would involve building a pump station at the 
sanitation plant site, water storage facilities and a network of pipelines to 
carry water to customers. 
</P>
<P>
"It did not prove to be an economically viable project" and the project was 
shelved, Coons said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the statewide drought in its fourth year -- causing some cities, 
including Ventura and Santa Barbara, to adopt mandatory water-saving measures 
-- Simi Valley has decided to take another look at a reclamation program, Coons 
said. 
</P>
<P>
While such a program would be an expensive undertaking for the city, at least 
two sources have proposed paying some of the costs, Coons said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Metropolitan Water District, the largest supplier of water in 
the east county, and the State Water Resources Control Board have said they may 
offer rebates or low-interest loans for water reclamation projects. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks has applied to the state for rights to use about 13,000 acre-feet 
of treated sewer water it now dumps into the Conejo Creek. The city wants to 
sell the water to farmers on the parched Oxnard Plain.

LOCALS SAY IT STARTED ON A COWBOY WHIM; 
</P>
<P>
FESTIVAL: WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN A CASUAL PICNIC HAS GROWN INTO CONEJO VALLEY DAYS, 
AN ANNUAL EVENT THAT BEGINS TODAY AND CELEBRATES THE WEST. 
</P>

<P>
It started on a whim about 45 years ago. It was nothing more than a picnic 
organized over a few beers in a Thousand Oaks bar by a couple of bored cowboys 
-- or at least that's what some locals believe. 
</P>
<P>
But, over the years, Conejo Valley Days has become an extravaganza, complete 
with a rodeo, a parade, carnival rides, a country fair and an old-fashioned 
barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
The annual event, the largest of its kind in eastern Ventura County, will kick 
off at 5 p.m. today in Conejo Creek Park on Janss Road east of the Moorpark 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 people from Orange County to Santa Barbara are expected to attend 
the five-day fete that commemorates the area's Western heritage. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a slice of Americana," said Doc Needham, a member of the event's 
executive committee. "And it's a gathering of old friends." 
</P>
<P>
No one is really sure when the event started, but it might have been in the 
mid-1940s. 
</P>
<P>
According to Needham's wife, Beth, a member of the Conejo Valley Historical 
Society, the festival started after a group of cowboys was "sitting about 
saying, 'This town is so quiet, let's have some fun.' " 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the event, usually held in spring or early summer, has been 
called different things -- Mayor's Days, Conejo Days and Mardi Gras and 
Whiskeroo Days. 
</P>
<P>
When the Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce took over the event in the 1950s, it 
was dubbed Conejo Valley Days, a name that stuck. 
</P>
<P>
John Gore, an event chairman, said the festival is almost entirely run by 
volunteers. And all the event's proceeds -- expected to be about $50,000 after 
expenses -- are donated to local charities and community organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"If we didn't have this, the community would suffer," Gore said. "For some of 
these groups, it's their only fund-raiser." 
</P>
<P>
One of the more popular fund-raisers at the festival is the Western Pit 
Barbecue, sponsored by the Methodist Men's Fellowship Club. 
</P>
<P>
But the barbecue also has a controversial past. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 years ago, the barbecue was sponsored by the Conejo Volunteer Fire 
Department, said Bruce Oxford, one of the organizers of this year's barbecue. 
But one fateful day at the picnic, the volunteer firefighters became, well, a 
little drunk and neglected the meat being barbecued, which burned. 
</P>
<P>
From the next year on, the Methodist group has sponsored the barbecue, Oxford 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, we stay sober," Oxford quipped. 
</P>
<P>
And there are other gaffes associated with Conejo Valley Days. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the early days, when the Jungleland animal theme park was still open, 
event organizers put the proceeds from the festival in a lion's cage, Beth 
Needham said. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess they thought it would be safe there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But when they returned after having beers, the money was gone, Beth Needham 
said. To this day, no one knows who had the nerve to take it. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 years ago, chairmen were red-faced when someone misspelled the name of 
the valley on the official souvenir patch, Beth Needham said. 
</P>
<P>
"Conjeo" was written on the patch instead of "Conejo." 
</P>
<P>
"Boy, did that get a lot of attention," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The event has had other troubles too. 
</P>
<P>
In 1968, it was scaled down and postponed a week when Sen. Robert F. Kennedy 
(D-NY) was assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
And several years ago, the festival was nearly rained out. But people still 
showed up for the parade, which is popular no matter what the weather. 
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 people are expected to attend Saturday's parade, which is 
scheduled to have about 200 entries. It starts at 9 a.m. on Thousand Oaks 
Boulevard at Auburn Court. Ray (Boom Boom) Carafelli was selected as grand 
marshal because he raised the most money -- about $26,000 -- for charity. 
</P>
<P>
Admission into the festival grounds costs $2.50 for adults, $2 for children and 
senior citizens and $1 for children ages 7 to 12. Youngsters 6 and under will 
be admitted free.

SUSPECT HELD AS THE DRIVER IN I-5 DEATH OF GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
A 28-year-old man was arrested Tuesday in connection with the death of a 
12-year-old girl who either fell or was pushed from a moving pickup truck on 
Interstate 5 in Old Town. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Hector Garcia of City Heights is being held without bail in County Jail 
on suspicion of murder in the death of Sylvia Marie Rodriguez. He was arrested 
shortly before 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
A witness told San Diego police that he saw a man push the girl out of a 
four-wheel-drive pickup truck about 1:30 a.m. Sunday. The witness said the red 
Toyota pickup with oversized tires was northbound in the slow lane of the 
freeway at about 60 m.p.h. when he saw the girl lean toward the driver, the 
passenger door open and the girl being ejected, police said. The girl landed on 
a service road about 50 feet north of the Old Town exit. 
</P>
<P>
She died of multiple injuries, according to the coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the victim was identified by friends who saw her picture on news 
broadcasts Monday. Family members were contacted and identified the girl at the 
morgue. 
</P>
<P>
A search warrant was obtained and authorities arrested Garcia at his house, 
3439 45th St. 
</P>
<P>
Police also found a 1989 red Toyota pickup with large tires. 
</P>
<P>
Sulema Rodriguez, the victim's mother, said two of her nieces knew the suspect. 
The two girls, ages 14 and 17, had gone with Garcia and his brother to the 20th 
anniversary celebration of Chicano Park in Barrio Logan on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"They later went to my sister's place, at a motel, to say hi to my daughter, 
and they introduced him to her," Rodriguez said. He dropped my nieces off here 
about 1:15 a.m., and he had to have gone right back to my sister's house and 
lied to my daughter to make her go with him. He must have told her that her 
cousins wanted her. My nieces said that he was kind of drunk." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said she was surprised that her daughter would leave with the 
suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"I know her. I taught her never to go with strangers and to be careful with 
guys like that, and to always take care of herself," she said. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, Sylvia Rodriguez "walked away" about two weeks ago from 
Hillcrest Receiving Home, an emergency facility for abused and neglected 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said that the mother described the girl as "incorrigible." 
</P>
<P>
"The mother said the girl was a 'free spirit' and very difficult to handle," 
said Dave Cohen, a spokesman for the San Diego Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The girl was living with an aunt at the Ebony Inn Motel &amp; Apartments on 
32nd Street. 
</P>
<P>
A 13-year-old neighbor and former classmate of Sylvia Rodriguez at Audubon 
Elementary School said the victim was "nice, but she got into a lot of fights 
at school." 
</P>
<P>
However, in an interview at Sulema Rodriguez's home in the 7100 block of Lisbon 
Street, the 30-year-old single mother described her relationship with her 
daughter as "very close." 
</P>
<P>
"She was a great person, really loving," she said. "She was always happy and 
always smiling. She always told people I love you. Those were her three 
favorite words. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that guy gets the worst thing that can happen to him. I hope they hang 
him. She was just a baby. I'm glad that she's resting. She's with God."

BRADBURY TO ASSIST IN NEPOTISM INQUIRY; 
</P>
<P>
PERSONNEL: THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ORDERS AN INVESTIGATION INTO ALLEGATIONS 
INVOLVING THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S CHILD SUPPORT DIVISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A showdown between Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury and the county Board of 
Supervisors was averted late Tuesday when Bradbury agreed to cooperate with an 
investigation into charges of nepotism within his Child Support Division. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors on Tuesday ordered an inquiry into employee union allegations 
that the district attorney has violated county work rules by allowing C. 
Stanley Trom to keep his new wife, Margaret, on his staff and that Trom has 
favored her over co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury, adamant that no rule has been broken and angry that the issue was not 
resolved Tuesday, said after the hearing that the supervisors have no authority 
over his office and that he may not cooperate with a probe by the county 
Personnel Department. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran district attorney said that if he allowed the inquiry he would 
insist that workers complaining about the Troms "sit across the table" from him 
and state their concerns, rather than voicing them anonymously as has often 
been the case so far. 
</P>
<P>
But late in the day, after a lengthy conversation with board Chairwoman Madge 
L. Schaefer, Bradbury said he had decided to assist Personnel Director Ronald 
Komers in his probe. He said that he would not insist on participating in the 
interviews nor that Komers identify complainants by name. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer, who had called Bradbury after being asked by The Times about his 
earlier comments on the board's lack of authority, said: "I just called him and 
said, 'What is this?' We ended the conversation by agreeing that the board did 
share his concern about the personal effects of this on everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer said: "I think Mike Bradbury does a fantastic job, but he is not 
unlike any other human being. There are times when he feels very passionately 
about an issue, and he feels very strongly about this issue." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, even upon reflection, Bradbury said Tuesday evening that regardless of 
the new probe's findings, he will transfer neither Trom nor his wife to new 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"I can guarantee you that the Troms' employment status will not change as long 
as I'm district attorney, period," Bradbury had said earlier. "I'm fed up with 
the Troms getting knocked from pillar to post on this issue." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's developments follow months of unrest that have forced the internal 
workings of the Child Support Division into the public eye. 
</P>
<P>
At issue legally is whether Bradbury can allow Trom to keep ombudsperson 
Escobar Trom on his 135-worker child-support staff. 
</P>
<P>
The couple married in October, sparking protests from the Public Employees 
Assn. of Ventura County. The union insisted that Trom indirectly supervised his 
wife and branded Bradbury's reassignment of Escobar Trom to another supervisor 
a sham. 
</P>
<P>
The county Civil Service Commission, responding to the union complaint, last 
week found Bradbury in violation of an anti-nepotism rule and recommended that 
the Board of Supervisors arrange the transfer of Escobar Trom to a new county 
job of equal pay. 
</P>
<P>
Commission staff adviser Ray Charles said there are morale problems in the 
division because of the Troms' situation. He said he based those conclusions on 
conversations with about 20 family-support officers, half of the 40 workers in 
that section. Nearly all complained, for example, that Escobar Trom "did not 
carry a workload comparable" to other supervising officers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's hearing, supervisors expressed concern and sadness over how the 
Trom complaints have been handled so far. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we really going to let the county be substantially influenced, even run, 
by anonymous phone calls and unsigned letters," Supervisor James R. Dougherty 
demanded. "I'm sorry that this has happened to two people whose only crime has 
been that they had the bad taste to fall in love and get married." 
</P>
<P>
But the board rejected on a 4 to 1 vote Dougherty's motion that the county's 
anti-nepotism rule be waived in the Trom case. 
</P>
<P>
"The district attorney has not resolved the problem" of alleged favored 
treatment of Escobar Trom, Supervisor Maggie Erickson said in moving for an 
inquiry by Komers. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been in front of us too often," Supervisor Susan K. Lacey said. "At 
this point all of the people involved deserve a reasoned, well-thought-out" 
decision to clear the air. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Erickson, Schaefer and Lacey all said they were bothered that none of the 
workers who have complained about the Troms have yet identified themselves 
publicly and that many of the complaints to supervisors have been made 
anonymously over the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Only one of the several workers who contacted Schaefer or Erickson identified 
herself, the supervisors said. Lacey said that at least four workers had 
identified themselves to her or her staff. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors said the purpose of Komers' inquiry is to address specific 
allegations against the Troms. The motion was vague as to how Komers should 
conduct the probe and whether he should identify complaining workers by name to 
Bradbury. 
</P>
<P>
But Schaefer said that if no employee is willing to be named as a complainant 
then her understanding is that the investigation will end quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Barry L. Hammitt, executive director of the employees' union, said the message 
of the supervisors was clear: 
</P>
<P>
"If the employees are concerned, they must come forward and be counted. It puts 
a lot of people in a very tough situation. People fear for their jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury said that "whistle-blowers" are protected by laws and grievance 
procedures and that no employee will be punished for coming forward. 
</P>
<P>
But one family-support worker who called The Times said she is concerned that 
she will be harassed if she tells Komers of her complaints against Escobar 
Trom. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very real concern," she said. "I can't say one way or another whether 
people are going to come forward." 
</P>
<P>
For their part, the Troms said, they wanted the situation resolved Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Escobar Trom said she never heard a complaint about her five-year relationship 
with Trom before they were married seven months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Never once," she said. "That's why it's so bizarre this has gone so far."

<P>
The Oxnard Elementary School District's preliminary budget for fiscal year 
1990-91 has a $1.8-million deficit, $200,000 more than reported previously, 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The school board will discuss the shortfall in funds at tonight's meeting, 
Assistant Supt. Ardyce Driskill said. 
</P>
<P>
The deficit is due largely to the increased cost of employee health benefits, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The district's total budget is about $54 million. KAREN MCKEAN

BOARD UNDECIDED ON SCHOOL BOND SURVEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Pleasant Valley School District in Camarillo has delayed a decision on 
whether to spend $15,500 for an opinion poll to gauge support for a $6-million 
school bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
The district is debating whether to place the bond issue on the November 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
If voters approved the measure, the money would be used to build a new school 
to ease overcrowding in the district. 
</P>
<P>
If the bond passed, property taxes would increase a maximum of $50 per year, 
said Assistant Supt. Howard Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
The district has until July to put the measure on the November ballot but could 
decide to hold a special election instead, either in March or June of 1991, 
Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
Some school board members said Thursday that the opinion poll is an unnecessary 
expense, while others withheld their opinions until after a presentation May 3 
by a political consultant on how to run a bond issue campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Overcrowding is so severe in the district that at Las Colinas Elementary 
School, 221 of the 1,025 students will be sent to Monte Vista Intermediate 
School in September. 
</P>
<P>
The last two schools the district built -- Las Colinas and Santa Rosa -- were 
funded by developer fees. But officials said they only have enough of those 
funds left to pay for one-third of the cost of a new school. JEFF SCHNAUFER

DEFENSE BLAMES STABBINGS ON SLEEP DISORDER; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: HERMAN CEGERS WAS VIRTUALLY ASLEEP AND BEFOGGED BY ALCOHOL WHEN HE 
ATTACKED HIS SON AND SISTER, MISTAKING THEM FOR BURGLARS, LAWYER ARGUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Herman Cegers said he was in a deep, sound sleep on floor cushions in the 
living room of his Oceanside apartment when he suddenly awakened in the predawn 
hours of Sept. 16 after someone stepped on his foot. 
</P>
<P>
The 45-year-old man awoke startled and thought strangers had broken into his 
home. Unconsciously, virtually asleep and reeling from the effects of a heavy 
night of drinking hours before, Cegers said, he grabbed two large kitchen 
knives and confronted the three invaders, stabbing two of them -- one in the 
back, one in the shoulder -- before driving the three out the front door. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a Vista Superior Court jury began deliberating whether Cegers 
should be convicted of attempted murder for attacking his 25-year-old son and 
his 43-year-old sister. If convicted, he could be sentenced to a maximum of 
life in prison with the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Walter Donovan argued to the jury Tuesday that Cegers had 
"lost his cool" and deliberately attacked his sister, his estranged son and the 
son's girlfriend. Cegers had kicked out his son, Charles Cegers, and his 
girlfriend, Naomi Zayas, the night before after the younger couple had spent 
several weeks living in the apartment that was rented by the elder Cegers and 
his common-law wife, Willie Mayes. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Cegers had a hot temper, Donovan said, and his behavior that morning 
last September was consistent with his earlier threats to kill his son. 
</P>
<P>
But the defense claims that Cegers suffered from mild sleep apnea -- a stopping 
of breathing during sleep -- the symptoms of which, when coupled with the 
effects of the liquor, put Cegers in a virtually unconscious state that saw him 
react physically, but without thought, toward the perceived intruders after he 
was abruptly awakened. 
</P>
<P>
People unconscious of their acts -- such as those suffering from a delirious 
fever, or in convulsions or, as in this case, on auto-pilot after a deep, 
alcohol-influenced sleep -- are legally excused of their actions, defense 
attorney Barbara McDonald told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
The question of whether Cegers was conscious of his attack was put Tuesday 
before the jury, which began its deliberations late in the day after hearing 
lengthy instructions from Superior Court Judge Charles Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
The jury heard testimony from Merrill Mitler, director of research at the 
sleep-disorder center at Scripps Clinic in La Jolla, that indeed Cegers 
suffered a mild form of sleep apnea, based on jailhouse testing after his 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Among the symptoms of sleep apnea, which is more likely to occur when coupled 
with the effects of alcohol, are confusion and disorientation upon awakening, 
Mitler told the jury last week. 
</P>
<P>
Without specifically diagnosing what Cegers may have suffered last September, 
Mitler said persons afflicted with sleep apnea can perform "automatic behavior" 
-- physical activity that may reflect no sense or reason. 
</P>
<P>
That's exactly what happened in September, defense attorney McDonald told the 
jury on Tuesday. The elder Cegers and his adult son had an on-and-off 
relationship that soured -- again -- the night before the incident; his son and 
his girlfriend were ordered out of the house and went to the home of Diane 
Head, the elder Cegers' sister. 
</P>
<P>
The three spent the night drinking and complaining about Herman Cegers. They 
decided to go back to Cegers' apartment sometime around 5 a.m. because of a 
misplaced $7. The door was locked, and they had no key, so the three got into 
the apartment through a window, according to trial testimony. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, according to testimony, Willie Mayes was awakened and started 
talking to the three. The discussion became contentious, but Herman Cegers 
slept through it, his defense attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
After a few minutes, someone stepped on his foot and Cegers woke up. "We expect 
he was in a deep sleep," she said, noting that Cegers' blood alcohol level was 
measured several hours later at 0.18% -- or more than twice the level of legal 
intoxication -- and was probably 0.24% at the time of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Cegers went after the three with both knives held high. It remained somewhat 
unclear how the two victims were stabbed in the fracas. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Cegers suffered a collapsed lung after he was stabbed in the back. He 
was hospitalized for several days. Head suffered a flesh wound on her shoulder, 
was treated at a nearby hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
"His eyes were blinded by sleep and by the blood alcohol level," McDonald said 
of her client. "And, if you're unconscious, you can't be held criminally 
responsible. He was not fully conscious. He was on automatic behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Sleep apnea or not, Cegers was "justified in protecting himself and his house 
if he perceived he was under attack," she said. "He didn't chase them out of 
the door. When they were gone, they were gone." 
</P>
<P>
McDonald scoffed that her client was charged with first-degree attempted 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
"Did he have a chance to premeditate it? He reacted with fear," she said. "He 
didn't realize who those shadows belonged to. He could have killed his son a 
lot more efficiently in the days before. If they hadn't broken in, none of this 
would have happened. 
</P>
<P>
But Donovan said that Cegers must have known who was in his apartment because, 
as he went after the three with the knives, they called out to him with his 
family nickname -- Greasy. 
</P>
<P>
He also argued that, an hour or so before the incident, Cegers got up, put on 
trousers and went to the front door to tell his brother -- who came to the 
apartment to pick up Charles for work -- that he wasn't there. 
</P>
<P>
Donovan conceded that Herman Cegers may have picked a bad time to try to kill 
his son -- in the presence of witnesses -- but added to the jury, "You're not 
sitting in judgment of people in the Mensa (high intelligence) group."

<P>
A new tree-planting program in Oxnard has received 12 donations so far, 
including $1,000 from GE Plastics, for the purchase and planting of trees in 
the city's 34 neighborhood parks. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of the Oxnard Parks and Recreation Commission is to receive donations 
for 500 trees by June. 
</P>
<P>
"People have a choice of indicating which park they want their tree to be 
planted in . . . and what kind of tree," said Michele Izay, acting recreation 
superintendent. Organizations and individuals may choose to plant palm trees or 
one of several types of flowering trees, other deciduous trees and evergreens. 
</P>
<P>
Donors may also choose one of three sizes of trees as well, at a cost of $15, 
$40 or $150. KIM KASH

COUPLE TO CHALLENGE HARBOR DISTRICT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH HARLAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Camarillo couple has announced that they will challenge a recent decision to 
reduce the boundaries of the Oxnard Harbor District. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Hollingsworth, a retired businesswoman who has lived in Camarillo for 33 
years, and her husband, Don, a United Airlines pilot, said they will file the 
challenge Friday with the Local Agency Formation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The cities of Port Hueneme and Oxnard had asked the agency to reduce the 
boundaries because officials said they wanted more control over the port's 
impact on their communities. Nearly a month ago the agency voted to shrink the 
harbor district's boundaries to the city limits of Oxnard and Port Hueneme, 
eliminating parts of Camarillo, Thousand Oaks and some unincorporated county 
land. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Braitman, LAFCO's executive officer, said that if the Hollingsworths 
file the challenge this week, the five-member commission will consider it at a 
meeting June 20. A majority vote would dismiss the challenge, he said. JUDITH

SANTEE COUNCILMAN FINED $6,000 FOR GAINING FINANCIALLY FROM VOTES 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santee City Councilman Ray Woodward has agreed to pay a $6,000 fine after an 
investigation found his public votes on the proposed extension of California 52 
increased the value of his personal real estate holdings, the Fair Political 
Practices Commission announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The state's political watchdog agency found that Woodward, a Santee real-estate 
agent and investor, violated the political reform act on three occasions when 
he voted with the council to support the plan and also appeared before the 
California Transportation Commission in 1987 to push for the alignment of 
California 52 along Prospect Avenue. Woodward voted on the alignment while he 
was part-owner of the Buena Vista Business Park, two other office buildings and 
a restaurant near the proposed freeway alignment. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time of Mr. Woodward's actions, it was reasonably foreseeable that the 
decision to build the Route 52 extension would result in an increase of greater 
than $10,000 on the fair market value of the Buena Vista Business Park, and on 
each of his other interests," the FPPC said in its findings against Woodward. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation findings and Woodward's decision to pay the $6,000 fine were 
released Tuesday in documents to be presented at the FPPC meeting in Sacramento 
on May 1, when commissioners can vote either to accept or to reject the 
agreement as negotiated by their staff. 
</P>
<P>
Woodward could not be reached for comment late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The FPPC investigation found that Woodward used his official capacity to 
enhance his financial holdings when he voted in favor of Santee City Council 
actions to urge the state transportation panel to select the Prospect Avenue 
alignment. Such a resolution was necessary before the state transportation 
commission could proceed with planning the final leg of the freeway, which was 
begun in 1961 as a way to ease traffic congestion along Interstate 8. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation found that Woodward voted on March 25, 1987, to approve a 
resolution in favor of the Prospect alignment, and again voted on April 22, 
1987, to send a contingent of city officials before the California 
Transportation Commission to advocate that position. 
</P>
<P>
The next month, Woodward himself appeared before the state transportation panel 
and "presented a stack of letters from residents in and around Santee in favor 
of the route," the findings say. 
</P>
<P>
In the third vote, Woodward voted Sept. 23, 1987, to approve the alignment and 
give Caltrans the final go-ahead from the city to start planning the last leg 
of SR 52, which is scheduled for construction next year. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the FPPC found, those decisions benefited Woodward personally. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the votes, he was half-owner of the Buena Vista Business Park, 
10207 Buena Vista Avenue, just north of Prospect Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Woodward sold his interest in the business park in 1989, when the fair market 
value was more than $600,000, the FPPC found. Even after the sale, Woodward 
continued as the listing agent for the property. 
</P>
<P>
The FPPC also found that Woodward was part-owner of two office buildings at 
8606 and 8781 Cuyamaca Street. The latter building has 25 to 28 tenants, as 
well as a restaurant of which Woodward owns 40%. 
</P>
<P>
Because the proposed freeway would have an exit to Cuyamaca Street, it was 
"also reasonably foreseeable that the extension of Route 52 along the Prospect 
alignment would result in an increase to the rental income from his real 
property interests, the broker's commissions from his real estate business, and 
the income from the restaurant that he partially owned," the FPPC investigation 
found. 
</P>
<P>
The documents released Tuesday said that Woodward cooperated with the agency's 
investigation, and noted that other Santee council members voted virtually 
unanimously to support the Prospect alignment.

COUNCIL OKS RAISE FOR 24 EMPLOYEES

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ojai City Council unanimously approved a 10% pay hike Tuesday for city 
employees, a move designed to halt what was described as high turnover. 
</P>
<P>
The average annual salary of 24 full-time Ojai city workers will rise from 
$28,324 to $31,487 as of May 1. 
</P>
<P>
The raises are long overdue, said Mayor Nina Shelley. While there are many 
advantages to living or working in the Ojai Valley, "that doesn't pay the 
rent," Shelley said. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on the results of the city's first salary study in a decade, the council 
agreed with its findings that 11 of the employees have the lowest salaries 
among 11 other cities studied similar to Ojai in size or service level. 
</P>
<P>
Planning Director William Prince will see his salary rise from $47,532 to 
$51,912, which will still be under the survey median of $54,564. 
</P>
<P>
Public Works Director Stan Moore, whose current salary is $51,192, will receive 
$54,504 next year, or above the survey median of $51,192. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Andy Belknap, who recently received a separate raise, told the 
council that the city can afford the $11,566 needed to cover the raises through 
June, since 1989-90 revenues have exceeded expectations. The $69,400 in 
additional salary outlay for next year will be included in the upcoming budget, 
he said. THIA BELL

SUPERVISORS APPROVE PLANS FOR NEW CALABASAS PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved plans Tuesday for Gates 
Canyon Park, the first public park to be built in Calabasas in decades. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for the seven-acre park to be completed in February. 
</P>
<P>
The park will have an activities building, two lighted tennis courts, a 
children's play area, volleyball court, picnic and open play areas, said Etsel 
Yamasaki, a landscape architect with the county Department of Parks and 
Recreation. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Calabasas residents have complained about the lack of parks in the 
area. Many activists said Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who represents the area, 
and the rest of the Board of Supervisors did not make parks a priority. 
</P>
<P>
At the first community planning session for the park two years ago, sheriff's 
deputies were called to protect Antonovich from angry protesters. Members of a 
grass-roots group, formed to oust Antonovich from office, picketed the meeting 
and accused him of using the proposed park as a "political ploy" to hide his 
poor record on park development. Antonovich has maintained that he is a strong 
advocate of parks. 
</P>
<P>
Doris LaViolette, treasurer of the Malibu Canyon Homeowners, said she is 
thrilled that the park will soon be built, adding that it has been a real 
hardship for families who have no place where their children can play. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to go to a playground with the children, very often we go to 
McDonalds -- they have a playground," LaViolette said. 
</P>
<P>
The park, which derives its name from the canyon it sits in, will be north of 
the Ventura Freeway, east of Las Virgenes Road and bounded by Thousand Oaks 
Boulevard on the south and east. 
</P>
<P>
The park, on land provided by a developer, will cost $900,000 to build.

'UNDERCOVER AGENT' IS AMONG LAWYERS INDICTED IN FRAUD; 
</P>
<P>
INSURANCE SCHEME: HE FIRST REPORTED THE 'ALLIANCE' TO AUTHORITIES AND SECRETLY 
TAPED CONVERSATIONS, BUT IS NOW ACCUSED OF HAVING PROFITED FROM THE SCHEME.

<P>
A network television reporter last year introduced a lawyer from San Diego to 
33 million viewers as the "undercover government agent" who "infiltrated the 
Alliance" -- a group of Los Angeles-area lawyers accused of manipulating 
lawsuits to defraud insurance companies of huge legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
The interview by Mike Wallace of "60 Minutes" was the highlight of attorney 
Leonardo T. Radomile's presentation of himself as a daring crime-buster, a 
white-hat who went to the authorities as soon as he learned he had wandered 
into a nest of crooks. 
</P>
<P>
The government has a different version. 
</P>
<P>
Along with 17 other alleged members of the so-called Alliance, Radomile, 43, 
who customarily goes by the name Leonard, was indicted in San Diego Tuesday on 
racketeering and mail fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Radomile," a co-defendant's lawyer said, "is not lily-white." 
</P>
<P>
But if the tale of Radomile-as-hero was not complete, neither did the 
indictment tell the whole story. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Radomile did work secretly with the government. He first reported the 
Alliance to federal authorities. And he, along with two clients, gathered 
evidence by secretly taping conversations with members of the group. 
</P>
<P>
Radomile "was the one who brought the case forward," a federal investigator 
said. Insurance lawyer Larry Nokes said he "played a very major role in 
knocking the wheels off" the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Radomile's lawyer, John R. Heisner, said his client was outraged at being 
indicted. 
</P>
<P>
"Leonard made the case," he said. "I can't wait until we get all these facts 
out and demonstrate what Leonard's role was." 
</P>
<P>
Without mentioning his role as informant, the indictment charges in effect that 
he had already profited from the scheme when he blew the whistle. 
</P>
<P>
 He went to federal officials in Los Angeles in 1987, without requesting or 
receiving immunity. The indictment accused him of taking part in the scheme 
before this. 
</P>
<P>
Radomile was "trying to beat the bad news home," one insurance industry lawyer 
theorized. He said Radomile was bright enough to realize the scheme would come 
unraveled and "the smart place to be was outside of the network." 
</P>
<P>
Radomile, whose story emerged from legal depositions over the past several 
months, is a slim, handsome man of considerable charm and intelligence. He was 
schooled in the use of television before he starred on "60 Minutes." He was 
briefly married to televangelist Terry Cole-Whittaker, the bubbly former Mrs. 
California who coined the slogan, "Prosperity, your divine right." Radomile 
served as chief executive of the Cole-Whittaker ministries before their 
marriage broke up in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The events leading to his indictment began the following year, when Radomile 
became acquainted with Los Angeles attorney Lynn Boyd Stites, the alleged 
mastermind of the Alliance who was also indicted Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Radomile had just been dragged into the Willow Ridge litigation in Los Angeles, 
a series of lawsuits aimed at recovering funds from investment promoter Barry 
S. Marlin, for whom Radomile had worked briefly in the 1970s. Soon after 
Radomile learned he'd been sued, Stites' law firm called with an offer to 
defend him, Radomile said in a deposition last summer. 
</P>
<P>
According to Radomile, Stites said he could persuade the other lawyers to drop 
him from the case. Stites was also certain he could get Radomile's legal fees 
paid by insurance companies that had insured Marlin's businesses, Radomile 
said. Based on these promises, Radomile said, he hired Stites. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, Stites turned Radomile over to a friend, former Studio City 
attorney Marc I. Kent. Stites explained that he could not represent Radomile 
due to a conflict of interest because he previously had another client in the 
case. Kent would be counsel of record, and Stites would work with him behind 
the scenes, Radomile said he was told. 
</P>
<P>
Over time, Radomile said, he grew uncomfortable with the arrangement. He said 
he was concerned about the chumminess of some of the lawyers, whose clients 
were opposing each other in Willow Ridge and several other cases. It appeared 
they were going out of their way to make these cases infinitely complex and 
expensive, so that "a bit at a time what were just normal cases started to turn 
into Fellini movies," Radomile testified. 
</P>
<P>
About Christmas, 1986, Radomile went to see Stites to demand an explanation. He 
said Stites warned him not to make trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Stites had boasted of getting huge referral fees from some of the other 
lawyers. So Radomile was shocked, he said, when Stites showed him sworn 
declarations in which the same lawyers denied, under penalty of perjury, having 
a financial connection with Stites. 
</P>
<P>
In essence Stites was saying, "I completely control these people. . . . Don't 
toy with me because I can get them to swear to anything that I want and, you 
know, you open your mouth, and I'll bury you," Radomile said. 
</P>
<P>
Stites even suggested he was a master puppeteer who had arranged for Radomile 
to join the Willow Ridge litigation. " 'God, the Willow Ridge cases. You think 
that stuff's for real?' " Radomile quoted Stites. "And then he laughed . . . 
and he literally leaned over and patted himself on the back," Radomile said. 
</P>
<P>
By his account fearful and angry at being muscled by Stites, Radomile soon took 
his story to the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
During the summer of 1987, he and two of his clients wore hidden devices to 
tape conversations with Stites and others. The tapes captured attorneys 
discussing kickbacks to clients and efforts to control both sides of lawsuits 
to assure huge billings to insurance companies, according to well-placed 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
That was Radomile the white-hat. But earlier, according to the indictment and 
sources familiar with the litigation, he had helped the lawyers infiltrate 
cases and had gained from his dealings with the network. In the Willow Ridge 
case, for example, insurance companies paid Radomile $585,000 to settle a 
cross-complaint filed by Kent on his behalf, according to insurance industry 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
And for a time when Kent handled Radomile's insurance-paid defense, Kent was 
paying Radomile about $10,000 a month, informed sources said. Kent pleaded 
guilty to mail fraud in October, admitting among other things that he and other 
Alliance lawyers paid kickbacks to some of their clients for the right to 
defend them at insurance company expense. Radomile has said the payments were 
for legitimate work. 
</P>
<P>
Upon pleading guilty, Kent surrendered his law license and became a star 
government witness. As a government informant, Radomile had helped bring down 
Kent. Tuesday's indictment suggests Kent returned the favor. 
</P>
<P>
Radomile never let on that he was in danger of prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, he taunted two lawyers -- Alan Arnold of Woodland Hills and Lewis 
M. Koss of Calabasas, both indicted Tuesday -- in a deposition taken in July. 
</P>
<P>
They were defending a fraud suit filed by an insurance company against Stites 
and others. Radomile was being examined as a potential witness. When the pair 
asked tough questions, Radomile warned they were messing with the wrong man. 
</P>
<P>
"Wait until the grand jury hands down the . . . indictments," he said. "I've 
been a good government agent. They now have a warehouse full of documents that 
will put you guys in jail."

S.D. COUNCIL DELAYS DECISION ON LINK BETWEEN I-5 AND I-15 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The long-awaited construction of Route 56, which would provide an east-west 
link between inland Interstate 15 and coastal Interstate 5, will have to wait a 
bit longer. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego City Council voted 6 to 1 Tuesday to continue for two weeks a 
decision on the location of the west end of the freeway, saying it wants to 
investigate other sites for the I-5 junction. 
</P>
<P>
A divided crowd filled the council chambers, with inland residents urging 
immediate action to join the two freeways at Carmel Valley Road in the North 
City West area. The coastal residents, who outnumbered their inland opponents, 
damned the connection as destroying sensitive coastal wetlands and intruding 
into residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer, whose district includes the North City area 
where both opponents and proponents of the plan reside, proposed the delay to 
study a new proposal that would route the west end of Route 56 to the south, 
joining with I-5 about a quarter of a mile north of the I-5 and I-805 split. 
</P>
<P>
However, state Department of Transportation engineers testified that such 
routing is not possible because of the proximity to that split, and saying it 
would cost about four times as much as the Carmel Valley route, which was 
adopted by the state 19 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Grasberger, deputy district director of Caltrans, said three Route 56 
connections in the I-5 and I-805 area have been studied by the department and 
rejected as unsafe because they would not allow enough distance for drivers to 
merge or change lanes to connect with one of the three major freeways. A 
distance of two miles from the split is needed, he said, which puts the 
connection at the Carmel Valley location. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfsheimer, who said she still believes a new route can be found without 
delaying the construction of the much-needed highway, said the Carmel Valley 
routing is "pitting the freedom from gridlock and air pollution" for inland 
residents against "intrusion into very sensitive biological habitat" in the 
coastal sections of the valley and Penasquitos Lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always said I wanted to see Route 56 by '96," Wolfsheimer said. "I still 
would like to see the route completed by '96, but I don't want to see a halfway 
job of it. And I hate to see a district divided." 
</P>
<P>
Although no one at the four-hour hearing denied that the freeway is needed, 
coastal opponents argued that there is no need to put a busy freeway through 
the center of a community when it can be routed through vacant land to the 
south. 
</P>
<P>
Inland Rancho Penasquitos residents argued that much of their community has 
been built on the promise that the major highway would be built to relieve 
congestion within the community and on I-15. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Judy McCarty, the lone vote against the two-week continuance, 
urged immediate action, saying that "no matter what we decide, we will be sued 
by one side or the other."

LANCASTER MAN PLEADS NO CONTEST TO PAINTING THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Lancaster man who admitted stealing an $18,000 painting from an Antelope 
Valley College exhibit pleaded no contest Tuesday to a charge of grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
Jerald Christopher Sharitz, 23, entered the plea in San Fernando Superior Court 
after prosecutors agreed not to seek a jail sentence of more than one year, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald L. Smalstig said. Sharitz could have been sentenced to a maximum of 
three years in prison, Smalstig said. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Sharitz's roommate, Timothy Daniel Cain, 27, pleaded no 
contest to a misdemeanor charge of being an accessory to a felony. Cain 
confessed to stealing the painting when Los Angeles County sheriff's 
investigators inspected the men's Lancaster apartment in November. But Sharitz 
surrendered to authorities shortly afterward and said it was he, not Cain, who 
stole the artwork. 
</P>
<P>
Smalstig said Cain's admission was made to protect Sharitz. Deputies searched 
the apartment after an acquaintance of the pair told officials that he had seen 
the painting in their apartment and recognized it from news reports. 
</P>
<P>
Sharitz lifted the 17th-Century Dutch painting by Gerard Hoet the Elder, titled 
"Nymphs Gathering Flowers in a Landscape," from a gallery wall on Nov. 6, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Smalstig said Sharitz, a student at the college, had become enamored of the 
painting while conducting an inventory of artworks in the exhibit. "He said he 
stole it for inspiration," Smalstig said. 
</P>
<P>
Sharitz and Cain, who are free on their own recognizance, are scheduled to be 
sentenced May 29.

PROPOSAL YANKED FOR OXNARD REVIEW PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Without an explanation, Oxnard Councilwoman Dorothy Maron withdrew a proposal 
Tuesday to form a committee of residents and council members to review the 
city's new General Plan, which she has criticized as being "very pro-growth." 
</P>
<P>
At Maron's request, the City Council voted unanimously to withdraw her 
recommendation to form a committee that would include the council and five 
residents, one resident chosen by each council member. 
</P>
<P>
Maron said she proposed forming the committee two weeks ago because she 
believed that the General Plan failed to adequately address ways to regulate or 
limit traffic levels, residential growth and "high-risk" industries. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview after the decision, Maron declined to explain why she withdrew 
her proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell the truth and if I can't tell the truth I won't comment," she 
said, adding that she still has some concerns about the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Nao Takasugi said he is not sure why Maron withdrew her proposal but 
guessed that she had been lobbied by Planning Commission members who oppose the 
formation of another review committee. 
</P>
<P>
He said Maron may have withdrawn her proposal because of "the reaction that 
some of us have received from members of the Planning Commission: 
disappointment, anger." 
</P>
<P>
Takasugi and Councilman Manual Lopez adamantly opposed the recommendation two 
weeks ago, saying it would only replicate the review process of the council and 
the commission. 
</P>
<P>
The General Plan, which is now being studied by the Planning Commission, is set 
for council review and approval next month. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the council formed the General Plan Advisory Committee, a 22-member 
group of residents, city officials and other community representatives who 
reviewed the General Plan during 33 meetings over 2 1/2 years. The Planning 
Commission has been reviewing the plan since June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Tuesday, Lopez said he thinks Maron's proposal to form another 
review committee came as an insult to members of the commission and the 
advisory committee "because they have worked on it for awhile." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Geraldine Furr, who previously supported the proposal, said she 
changed her mind about forming a new committee after studying the matter 
further. 
</P>
<P>
She said she would like to have the General Plan come before the council before 
making any decision on whether another committee is needed. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ann Johs, who previously supported the proposal, said she voted to 
withdraw the proposal because a report drafted by city staff this week answered 
some of Maron's concerns about the General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
In general, the report says the Planning Commission and the advisory committee 
have addressed ways of limiting traffic, residential housing and "high-risk" 
industries.

BUCHANAN ON MANIFEST DESTINY

After reading Buchanan's little schoolboy fantasy concerning the possibility of 
our absorbing and democratizing (!) dissatisfied Canadian provinces (yeah, I'll 
bet those Canadians are just longing to escape the Mountie's oppressive 
jackboot), I can't help but be in awe of the mileage Buchanan has gotten out of 
a 39-cent box of crayons!

<P>
Is Buchanan insane, or is he just blind and arrogant? I thought the concept of 
Manifest Destiny was long dead and buried next to its primary victims -- Native 
Americans, Hispanics, Hawaiians and Filipinos. 
</P>
<P>
What Buchanan suggests contradicts Canadian popular opinion and would amount to 
a shotgun wedding. The best way to antagonize otherwise friendly Canadians is 
to suggest, like an insensitive boob, that "pieces" of Canada ought to be part 
of the United States.

Buchanan has gone too far. How dare he compare the constitutional problems in 
Canada with the fires of nationalism in Eastern Europe! Granted, the separatist 
thrust in Quebec is serious and should not be taken lightly, but the provinces 
of Canada were not enslaved and held against their will as the Eastern 
Europeans were. 
</P>
<P>
Canada was created legally, and was not forced into union by a bloody civil 
war, unlike a certain well-known country. What is really inflammatory is his 
taking as inevitable that Canada will self-destruct and that the U.S. will do 
well in salvaging the spoils of a divided country. 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan is at his lowest when he looks under a slippery rock and brings from 
obscurity the likes of the Truman Doctrine offspring, R. Craig Schoonmaker. The 
U.S.' desire for Canada's natural resources and water is no secret, but a 
declining America's craving for more territory is not unlike a festering sore 
reaching out to contaminate surrounding areas. Canadians will not accept this. 
As a Canadian living in California, I will be one of the first to sign up as a 
North American Contra.

U.S. TUNA CANNERS PLEDGE MORE PROTECTION FOR DOLPHINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The H.J. Heinz Co. is to be congratulated for assuming a leadership role in the 
fight to preserve dolphins and the myriad hundreds of thousands of other marine 
creatures which incidentally and yearly die in deep sea drift nets and purse 
seine nets (Part A, April 13). And Bumble Bee Seafoods and the Van Camp Seafood 
Co. are likewise to be congratulated for joining in the effort to preserve 
marine life. 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, however, people must understand that Star-Kist's move to save 
dolphins is the direct result of a well-organized grass-roots lobby to ban the 
killing of dolphins by the tuna industry, and that the voluntary cooperation of 
Star-Kist, Bumble Bee and Chicken of the Sea is only a first step in the 
struggle to preserve the bio-diversity of our oceans.

Saving marine species from extinction, and keeping our oceans from becoming 
aquatic deserts is an international task. The Japanese have already responded, 
saying they will not follow the lead of American companies. If we are to 
succeed in preserving ocean life, the U.S. must act quickly to assume a 
leadership role. Congress must pass the Boxer-Biden bill (the Dolphin 
Protection Act) which would make dolphin-safe labeling law; and pressure must 
be directed at President Bush to fulfill his pledge to be an environmental 
president. The White House must adopt a leadership role in promoting 
international treaties and agreements which would ban, worldwide, the use of 
fishing technologies which incidentally kill dolphins and other marine life.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 BROTHERS CHARGED IN DEATH DURING ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Sun Valley brothers were charged in Newhall on Tuesday with murder in the 
death of a friend allegedly shot during a robbery Friday in Angeles National 
Forest. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Daniel Henry Sickler, 26, and Tony David Sickler, 23, were 
responsible for the death of Ted Anthony Lugo, 28, of Sun Valley, who was shot 
six times in the chest by a camper. Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said 
the three men robbed the camper at gunpoint, not realizing the camper also had 
a gun. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, the Sickler brothers could face the death penalty because Lugo 
was killed during a robbery, Deputy Dist. Atty. Bradford Stone said. The two 
brothers will be arraigned May 1.

UC OFFICIAL ENCOURAGES EFFORT TO GET ANTELOPE VALLEY CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
A top University of California official Tuesday encouraged Antelope Valley 
leaders to continue their efforts to land a UC campus for the fast-growing 
region, but warned that any such expansion hinges on passage of Proposition 111 
on the state ballot in June. 
</P>
<P>
During an hourlong presentation at Lancaster City Hall, UC Vice President 
William Baker said the Antelope Valley, along with other areas, is "certainly 
high on our list of priorities" as a location for a new Southern California 
campus that could open by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley leaders have been campaigning to get the new campus for the 
past year. But the communities of Diamond Bar and the Santa Clarita Valley in 
Los Angeles County, Palm Springs and the Coachella Valley in Riverside County 
and Chula Vista in San Diego County also want the campus. Baker said no 
community has an edge over any of the others. 
</P>
<P>
Baker told about 30 civic leaders at a briefing Tuesday that the UC system 
could not afford the planned expansion unless state voters approve Proposition 
111, a measure that would relax state constitutional spending limits and allow 
more tax money to be spent on transportation and higher education. If the 
measure does not pass, Baker said, the system would have to turn away 
prospective students and impose higher fees. 
</P>
<P>
UC officials have proposed adding three new campuses -- in the northern, 
central and southern regions of the state -- to handle enrollment that is 
expected to grow by 56,000 students to 221,000 by 2005. The university system 
now has nine campuses. 
</P>
<P>
The UC Board of Regents decided in February to proceed first with a new campus 
for the central region. The board is to decide in November whether the next 
campus to be built after that would be in the north or the south. A site for 
that campus could be selected by mid-1992, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said the Southern California campus would cost about $300 million, 
require between 1,200 and 2,000 acres and ultimately serve 15,000 to 25,000 
students. The Antelope Valley, with a population of about 200,000 and growing, 
is projected to have sufficient population, housing, jobs and services to 
support such a campus, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's stop in Lancaster was the first in a two-day series of meetings with 
leaders in some of the communities vying for the new UC campus. Baker was to 
meet later Tuesday with Palm Springs Mayor Sonny Bono and today with officials 
in Diamond Bar and the Coachella Valley.

BACKERS OF PROPOSED CHURCH LOSE CONSTITUTIONAL ARGUMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A religious group that wants to build a church in Granada Hills complained at a 
planning hearing at Los Angeles City Hall Tuesday that zoning restrictions 
infringe its constitutional freedom of religion, but the argument backfired, 
putting construction of the church in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the City Council's Planning and Land Use Management Committee, 
a representative of the Christadelphians said restrictions imposed on the 
church by the Board of Zoning Appeals violate the church's First Amendment 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
The board in October said a church building could be constructed at 15711 San 
Fernando Mission Blvd. only if membership were limited to 50 members and 
worship restricted to Sundays and one weeknight. 
</P>
<P>
"We very strongly object to the city limiting the membership of any religious 
organization or any other organization," said Fred Gaines of Sherman Oaks, who 
represented the group. "The limitation of the type and number of religious 
ceremonies . . . is again a question of First Amendment rights." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Hal Bernson, chairman of the planning committee, agreed with the 
Christadelphians' complaints, but said unconstitutional restrictions are the 
only way the church could fit into the surrounding neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
So, Bernson recommended that the full council deny the church permission to 
build at the site altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't really get what they need there with the conditions imposed," he 
said, "and those conditions are there to protect the community." 
</P>
<P>
The Christadelphians' proposal is scheduled for consideration by the full 
council at the end of May. 
</P>
<P>
The Christadelphians, organized in 1844 by a doctor in Virginia, oppose war and 
believe Christ will return to Earth and establish the Kingdom of God, 
resurrecting the dead to be judged.

COURT UPHOLDS PRISON TERM FOR EX-PROSECUTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former county prosecutor who was drunk when his car crashed into an auto 
driven by an Escondido school teacher, killing her, was properly sentenced to a 
six-year prison term, a state appellate court in San Diego has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
Charles A. Van Dusen, a former deputy district attorney in Vista who prosecuted 
many drunk-driving cases during his career, did not receive an overly harsh 
sentence because he was convicted of a "very serious" crime, the 4th District 
Court of Appeal ruled. 
</P>
<P>
The crash that sent Van Dusen to prison took place Sept. 2, 1988. Elementary 
school teacher Carol Benson, 45, was driving home for lunch on Cole Grade Road 
in Valley Center when Van Dusen, traveling about 90 m.p.h. in his Corvette, 
struck her car head-on. 
</P>
<P>
Benson died instantly. Van Dusen received minor injuries. His wife, Susan, a 
passenger in his car, was not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Van Dusen's blood-alcohol level measured 0.20, double the then-legal limit. 
</P>
<P>
Van Dusen pleaded guilty in December, 1988, to vehicular manslaughter with 
gross negligence. In February, 1989, San Diego Superior Judge Jesus Rodriguez 
sentenced Van Dusen to the six-year prison term, saying Van Dusen had a 
"longstanding alcohol abuse problem" and had demonstrated an "unwillingness and 
inability" to control it. 
</P>
<P>
In an opinion issued Thursday, a three-judge panel of the 4th District Court 
rejected Van Dusen's contention that Rodriguez was arbitrary in imposing the 
six-year sentence. There was no evidence to support that claim, Judge Gilbert 
Nares said. 
</P>
<P>
The panel also denied Van Dusen's claim that the sentence was 
unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment. A six-year term is not unusual 
for someone convicted of gross vehicular manslaughter and does not "shock the 
conscience," Nares said. 
</P>
<P>
Judges William L. Todd Jr. and Patricia Benke concurred in the opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, Benson's three children settled a wrongful-death lawsuit against 
Van Dusen they had filed a few months earlier in Vista Superior Court, 
accepting $225,000 to end the case.

VISTA TO GAUGE THEATER SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Vista City Council has taken another step toward expanding its cultural 
arts center by approving $15,000 to study the feasibility of raising money for 
a $2-million theater in Brengle Terrace Park. 
</P>
<P>
The Tucson-based Martin Group USA will conduct an eight-week study to "tell us 
pretty concretely whether or not there is support for this proposed project," 
said Cathy Brendel, assistant director of the Parks and Community Services 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
If support for the theater in the community is found, the $15,000 study 
approved Monday night will then develop a plan to raise the funds, recruiting 
community leaders and corporate sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the results will stop us in going ahead to do the campaign," 
Brendel said. "But it will certainly help show us the way." 
</P>
<P>
The direct-mail survey will provide the fund-raising campaign with a timetable, 
a preliminary budget and a time frame for construction of the playhouse. The 
study will also determine exactly how much the house will cost. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed 200-seat theater is now called the Moonlight Theater but may be 
changed to honor "a wonderful donor," Brendel said. The theater would provide 
the only non-school, enclosed auditorium in the city and house the Moonlight 
Youth Theater, which now rents school auditoriums for its performances. 
</P>
<P>
None of the $2 million for the project would come from city funds, Brendel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed theater is part of a larger, $10-million cultural-arts center 
expansion planned for Brengle Terrace Park.

NAVY CHALLENGED OVER SPENDING ON NEW HOME PORTS

<P>
The General Accounting Office recommended Tuesday that spending on new home 
ports be suspended until the Navy can justify the program in light of changing 
world conditions and cuts in defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
Martin M. Ferber, director of the GAO's national security and international 
affairs division, told a House armed services subcommittee that the Navy still 
is relying on a 1982 analysis to justify the strategic home ports in six Gulf 
Coast cities and in Staten Island, N.Y., and Everett, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe it is even more important to revisit that analysis now because of 
the changing worldwide threat, declines in the size of the Navy and budgetary 
pressures," Ferber said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the estimated $799-million cost of developing the eight home ports, $624.7 
million already has been appropriated by Congress and an additional $25.7 
million had been requested for fiscal 1991. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the $799 million in federal outlays for the program, the GAO 
said, state and local governments have contributed $198.7 million.

INFORMANT IN LAWYER FRAUD CASE IS HIMSELF INDICTED IN U.S. COURT; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: PROSECUTORS SAY HE TOOK PART IN AN INSURANCE-BILKING SCHEME BEFORE GOING 
TO AUTHORITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A network television reporter last year introduced a San Diego lawyer to 33 
million viewers as the "undercover government agent" who "infiltrated the 
Alliance" -- a group of Los Angeles area lawyers accused of manipulating 
lawsuits to defraud insurance companies of huge legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
The interview by Mike Wallace of CBS-TV's "60 Minutes" was the highlight of 
attorney Leonard Radomile's presentation of himself as a daring crime buster, a 
white hat who went to the authorities as soon as he learned he had wandered 
into a nest of crooks. 
</P>
<P>
The government has a different version. 
</P>
<P>
Along with 17 other alleged members of the so-called Alliance, Radomile, 43, 
was indicted Tuesday in San Diego on racketeering and mail-fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those whom Radomile implicated took comfort in the fact that he shared 
their fate. "Mr. Radomile is not lily white," a lawyer for one of his 
co-defendants said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
But, if the tale of Radomile-as-hero was not complete, neither did the 
indictment tell the whole story. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Radomile did work secretly with the government. He first reported the 
Alliance to federal authorities. And he, along with two clients, gathered 
evidence by secretly taping conversations with members of the group. 
</P>
<P>
Radomile has recently refused requests for interviews. But his lawyer, John 
Heisner, said Radomile is outraged. 
</P>
<P>
"Leonard made the case," he said. "I can't wait until we get all these facts 
out and demonstrate what Leonard's role was. If anything, he was a victim of 
the Alliance and, like a good citizen, brought the crime to the attention of 
the government, who then used him in an undercover capacity." 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors declined to discuss details of Radomile's cooperation. But 
the indictment charges that he illegally profited from the scheme before 
volunteering himself as an informant. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Radomile and government sources, he went to federal officials in 
Los Angeles in 1987, without requesting or receiving immunity. The indictment 
accuses him of taking part in the scheme in the prior two years, 1985 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
There have been rumors of negotiations in which Radomile has steadfastly 
refused to make a deal in which he would have acknowledged some culpability. If 
true, that suggests the government believed it could not ignore acts he 
committed before blowing the whistle, regardless of the risk that a jury would 
see its treatment of a key informant as ruthless. 
</P>
<P>
Radomile, whose story emerged from legal depositions over the past several 
months, was briefly married to televangelist Terry Cole-Whittaker, the bubbly 
former Mrs. California who coined the slogan "Prosperity, your divine right." 
He served as chief executive of the Cole-Whittaker ministries before their 
marriage broke up in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The events leading to his indictment began the next year, when Radomile became 
acquainted with Los Angeles attorney Lynn Boyd Stites, the alleged mastermind 
of the Alliance, also indicted Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Radomile had just been dragged into the Willow Ridge litigation in Los Angeles, 
a series of lawsuits aimed at recovering funds from investment promoter Barry 
S. Marlin, for whom Radomile had worked briefly in the 1970s. Soon after 
Radomile learned he had been sued, Stites' law firm called with an offer to 
defend him, Radomile said in a deposition last summer. 
</P>
<P>
According to Radomile, Stites said he was familiar with the litigation and 
could persuade the other lawyers to drop him from the case. Stites was also 
certain he could get Radomile's legal fees paid by insurance companies that had 
insured Marlin's businesses, Radomile said. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, Stites turned Radomile's case over to a friend, former 
Studio City attorney Marc I. Kent. Stites explained that he could not represent 
Radomile because he previously had another client in the case. However, 
although Kent would be counsel of record, Stites would work with him behind the 
scenes, Radomile said he was told. 
</P>
<P>
Over time, Radomile said, he grew uncomfortable with the arrangement. His case 
had not been quickly dismissed, and he was also concerned about the chumminess 
of some of the lawyers whose clients were opposing each other in Willow Ridge 
and several other cases. It appeared they were going out of their way to make 
these cases infinitely complex and expensive, Radomile testified. 
</P>
<P>
About Christmas, 1986, Radomile went to see Stites to demand answers. He said 
Stites warned him not to make trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Stites had boasted of getting huge referal fees from some of the other lawyers. 
So Radomile was shocked, he said, when Stites showed him sworn declarations in 
which the same lawyers denied, under penalty of perjury, having a financial 
connection with Stites. 
</P>
<P>
By his account, fearful and angry at being muscled by Stites, Radomile soon 
took his story to the U. S. attorney in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
During the summer of 1987, he and two of his clients wore hidden devices to 
tape conversations with Stites and others. The tapes captured attorneys 
discussing kickbacks to clients and efforts to control both sides of lawsuits 
to assure huge billings to insurance companies, according to well-placed 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
That was Radomile the white hat. But earlier, according to the indictment and 
sources familiar with the litigation, he had helped the lawyers infiltrate 
cases and had gained from his dealings with the network. In the Willow Ridge 
case, for example, insurance companies paid Radomile $585,000 to settle a 
cross-complaint filed by Kent on his behalf, insurance industry sources 
alleged. 
</P>
<P>
And, for a time when Kent handled Radomile's insurance-paid defense, Kent was 
paying Radomile about $10,000 a month, informed sources said. Kent pleaded 
guilty to mail fraud in October, admitting, among other things, that he and 
other Alliance lawyers paid kickbacks to some of their clients for the right to 
defend them at insurance company expense. Radomile has said the payments were 
for legitimate work. 
</P>
<P>
Upon pleading guilty, Kent surrendered his law license and became a star 
government witness. As a government informant, Radomile had helped bring down 
Kent. Tuesday's indictment suggests Kent returned the favor.

Amdahl Corp.: The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based mainframe computer maker posted 
first-quarter profit of $29.9 million, down 34% from the record 1989 period. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue was $506.7 million, 8% higher than last year. The firm said earnings 
were lower because of competitive pricing pressures that accelerated shortly 
after the first quarter of 1989 and because of a shift in product mix.

Revenue totaled $539.5 million, a gain of 8%. The firm said results were 
depressed by the Public Utilities Commission's 1989 decision to disallow the 
utility $25 million in costs to import power over the Southwest Powerlink. 
However, the firm benefited from reduced utility operating and maintenance 
costs and improved earnings of its subsidiaries.

USX Corp.: The steel and energy company said first-quarter profit fell 40% from 
the same period in 1989 to $176 million. 
</P>
<P>
Sales totaled $4.7 billion, up 4%. The year-ago results included a $74-million 
pretax gain from asset disposals. The Pittsburgh firm said increased sales at 
its Marathon Oil Co. were offset by weakness in its steel segment.

'Independence' Goes to Court: The battle over competing productions of Lee 
Blessing's "Independence" will go to Los Angeles County Superior Court today. 
An attorney for the producers of the authorized Burbank Theatre Guild 
production, scheduled to open Friday, will ask for a temporary restraining 
order against the Gnu Theatre production, scheduled to open Thursday without 
the rights to the play. Gnu artistic director Jeff Seymour rejected a proposal 
by the Burbank producers to delay his production three weeks in exchange for 
staying out of court. GREG BRAXTON

'Tie Me Up' Still an 'X': Despite arguments by longtime civil rights attorney 
William Kunstler, the X rating given by the Motion Picture Assn. of America to 
Miramax Films' "Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down" stands. The 12-person appeals board 
deadlocked 6-6 Tuesday on Miramax's request that the adults-only rating be 
changed to the less restrictive R. A two-thirds vote of the board was needed to 
overturn the rating. 
</P>
<P>
Kunstler said the X rating on the Spanish-language film, in which a man holds a 
woman hostage in the hope that she will fall in love with him, was outrageous 
in light of other films that have been given R ratings. Kunstler said he has 
recommended to Miramax that they continue to fight the rating on grounds of 
censorship under New York law. GREG BRAXTON

Mobutu, 59, has been absolute ruler since taking power Nov. 24, 1965. His

The British Parliament voted to cut the legal time limit for abortions from 28 
to 24 weeks of pregnancy. The first change in the abortion law since 1967 
marked a compromise between anti-abortion forces, which favored an 18-week 
limit, and forces favoring liberalized abortion laws. But the legislation 
exempts cases in which an abortion is needed to prevent grave permanent injury 
to a woman.

A bill that would limit to 18% the interest rate a retailer can charge failed 
in an Assembly committee. The measure was an attempt to revive the Unruh Retail 
Credit Act of 1959, which was repealed by legislation signed by Gov. George 
Deukmejian in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-Los Banos) said he will either reintroduce his bill 
next year or seek to qualify for a ballot initiative. The Assembly Finance and 
Insurance Committee voted 10-7 against the bill. Areias and several consumer 
groups argued that the retail industry had failed to deliver on its promise 
that, if the interest rate ceiling was repealed, interest rates would not rise 
and more credit would be available to low-income customers. Areias said 
interest rates since the repeal have averaged 20.15% and sometimes run as high 
as 24%.

KINGS CAN'T GO ANOTHER ROUND; 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: COMEBACK FROM 4-1 DEFICIT IS FOR NAUGHT. OILERS WIN, 6-5, WHEN JOE 
MURPHY SCORES AT 4:42 OF EXTRA PERIOD, ENDING L.A. SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The season began with the Edmonton Oilers watching as Wayne Gretzky soared past 
Gordie Howe. 
</P>
<P>
But it ended with Gretzky watching from the stands as the Oilers soared past 
his Kings, winning, 6-5, in overtime Tuesday night at the Forum on Joe Murphy's 
shot at the 4:42 mark of the extra period to sweep the best-of-seven Smythe 
Division finals. 
</P>
<P>
It began with the hopes that this would be the season for the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
It ended, however, as so many others have for the Kings, the high hopes of an 
opening-round triumph dashed by a second-round collapse. 
</P>
<P>
But no one could accuse the Kings, or what was left of them at the end, of 
going meekly. 
</P>
<P>
Despite nine major injuries, it looked as if the Kings were going to pull off 
another Miracle on Manchester after trailing, 4-1, midway through the second 
period. 
</P>
<P>
They came up with four goals to lead, 5-4, with 2:55 to play in regulation 
time. 
</P>
<P>
But then Esa Tikkanen took a shot from the left corner that bounced off one of 
Marty McSorley's skates, ricocheted off the left pad of goaltender Kelly Hrudey 
and dribbled into the net. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Murphy's game-winner on a rebound. 
</P>
<P>
"The puck just kicked out," Hrudey said, "Murphy walked into the middle and 
beat me to the glove side. 
</P>
<P>
"A week ago, it looked like we had so much more hockey to play. Our pride is 
bruised, but time heals all." 
</P>
<P>
Even Hrudey's bruised ribs, an injury that made it difficult for him to even 
breathe, much less to play. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't much easier for Tomas Sandstrom and Bob Kudelski, who were playing 
with broken fingers that made it difficult for them to even control their 
sticks. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's back was hurting so bad, he never even made it to the ice. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings were also missing Tom Laidlaw, Tim Watters, Dave Taylor, Rob Blake 
and Scott Bjugstad. 
</P>
<P>
But the Oilers still couldn't put them away. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton scored first when Craig Simpson, with Steve Duchesne on his back, 
managed to shovel the puck over to Mark Messier as he went down. 
</P>
<P>
Messier slammed it past Hrudey just inside the right post to give his club a 
1-0 lead 4:57 into the game. 
</P>
<P>
It was Messier's fifth goal and 13th point of the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers added to their lead at 12:02, Glenn Anderson scoring on a 20-foot 
shot to Hrudey's stick side that appeared to hit the cross-bar and ricochet in, 
just inside the right post. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings might have folded then, their thoughts drifting from high-pressure 
stick shots to low-key golf shots. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they got back into the game 4:57 into the second period, using a 
combination that had yet to score in this series. 
</P>
<P>
Luc Robitaille had seemed to disappear since getting two goals in each of the 
first two games of the opening series against the Calgary Flames and collecting 
a total of seven points over the six games. 
</P>
<P>
But Robitaille got his team on the scoreboard 2:44 into the second period 
Tuesday, passing to Keith Crowder, who had broken free of Jari Kurri on the 
right side. 
</P>
<P>
Charging the net, Crowder took Robitaille's pass, but lost his balance. As he 
fell, however, Crowder still had enough control to shove the puck under 
Ranford's glove before sliding into the end boards. 
</P>
<P>
That seemed to spark the sellout crowd of 16,005. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers did their best to quiet the crowd, scoring twice more to move into a 
4-1 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Lamb shoved a rebound past Hrudey at 8:28. 
</P>
<P>
And Simpson added his team-high eighth goal of the playoffs, bouncing one in 
off one of Duchesne's skates at 10:38. 
</P>
<P>
But the Kings came right back at 13:39 when Robitaille went behind the net to 
dig out the puck and threw it out in front where Kudelski, bad finger and all, 
scored his first goal of the playoffs from the right side. 
</P>
<P>
Was Ranford a mere mortal after all? 
</P>
<P>
He looked that way late in the period when the Kings tied the score on a pair 
of goals over a span of 46 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Robitaille got the first off a pass from Todd Elik on a two-on-one rush at 
17:52. 
</P>
<P>
John Tonelli got the second off a pass from Mike Krushelnyski. As Tonelli 
skated in left to right, Ranford swung around the crease to meet him. But 
Tonelli waited until the Edmonton goalie had made his move and was spread out 
on the ice before backhanding in his first goal of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings opened the final period at a disadvantage with Tony Granato finishing 
up his time in the penalty box for high-sticking. 
</P>
<P>
But the Kings quickly turned it to their advantage, scoring a short-handed goal 
1:15 into the period. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Robinson brought the puck down the right side and tossed it in front, 
where first Krushelnyski, then Mike Allison took pokes at it. 
</P>
<P>
Allison had the better luck of the two, ramming it past Ranford. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm quite proud of my team," Coach Tom Webster said, "but it just wasn't in 
the cards." 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tom Laidlaw has not played since injuring his lower back on March 17. Tim 
Watters has not returned since bruising an ankle in Game 4 of the Calgary 
Flames series. Dave Taylor's final game was the title-clincher against Calgary, 
the night he bruised a shoulder. Rob Blake and Scott Bjugstad were both 
sidelined in the second game of this series, each with a sprained knee. . . . 
In attempting to come back and win the series from a 3-0 deficit, the Kings 
were trying to equal a feat accomplished twice previously in NHL history, by 
the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs and the 1975 New York Islanders. . . . The year he 
coached Salt Lake City, King Coach Tom Webster found himself down 3-0 in a 
playoff series. His club came back to tie it, only to lose in the seventh game.

PADRES DOUBLE THE FUN; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: FOR THE SECOND NIGHT IN A ROW, PADRES SCORE 13 RUNS. THIS TIME THEY 
CLOBBER THE BUMBLING CUBS, 13-3.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a night when the Chicago Cubs would have had trouble catching the ball if 
they were playing with a softball, it didn't matter to the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres are too busy hitting to pay attention to much else. 
</P>
<P>
They were so excited to play the defending National League East champions that 
they went right out and got 13 runs and 19 hits Tuesday in a 13-3 romp in front 
of 18,351 in San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
This week in baseball: 
</P>
<P>
Because Manager Jack McKeon flipped Bip Roberts and Roberto Alomar in the 
batting order -- Alomar is now hitting first and Roberts second -- the Padres 
are averaging 13 runs a game. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the first time he tried that trick was Monday, against defending 
National League champion San Francisco, and the Padres got 13 runs on 17 hits 
and won 13-3. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the Padres had back-to-back games in which they scored in double 
figures was Sept. 11 and 12, 1987, when they defeated Houston 11-0 and 10-2 in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres lead the league and are second in the majors with 79 runs scored. 
Toronto has 81. 
</P>
<P>
"Before last night, we really weren't hitting the ball that well," Tony Gwynn 
said. "(The lineup) looks good on paper, but our problem was going out there 
and getting it done. The key is giving these guys the opportunities. Sooner or 
later, they're going to knock some runs in." 
</P>
<P>
Said Roberts: "Things are just clicking for us right now. Hopefully, we can 
ride it until the wave hits the beach. The big thing for us right now is to be 
consistent." 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs were pretty consistent. They bobbled balls in nearly every inning. 
Their line:: four errors, a wild pitch and several bobbles. Four of the Padres' 
13 runs were unearned. Second baseman Ryne Sandberg was unaffected, however, 
and played his 103rd consecutive errorless game. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the Cubs did their best to turn Padre hits into errors, 
seven Padres still managed to collect multiple hits. And of the starting 
lineup, Jack Clark was the only Padre who went hitless. 
</P>
<P>
Take a run through the batting order: 
</P>
<P>
Tony Gwynn, Benito Santiago and Garry Templeton all had three hits. Roberto 
Alomar, Bip Roberts, Joe Carter each had two. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, yes, even pitcher Dennis Rasmussen had two hits for the first time since 
last Aug. 21 at Philadelphia. In the Padres' three-run fifth, Rasmussen lined a 
single past a drawn-in Cub infield to score two runs. The two runs-batted in 
were as many as he had for the entire season in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Career years? The Padres are beginning to have career games. Carter had a 
career-high seven RBIs Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics? Santiago, after going three for five, is hitting .420. He entered 
the game at .400, third in the league. He has a hit in 11 consecutive games, 
the most since he hit in 34 in a row as a rookie. It is the second-longest in 
the National League this year. 
</P>
<P>
Templeton, also three for five, raised his average from .209 to .250. 
</P>
<P>
And to think, the Padres were facing Greg Maddux, who entered the game with a 
sparkling 2-0 record and 1.84 earned-run average. He was gone after the fourth, 
having allowed eight hits and six runs -- three earned. He allowed two more 
hits and three more runs than he had in his two previous outings this year 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Cubs' fifth loss in a row, and Manager Don Zimmer closed the doors 
for a 15-minute meeting after the game. "I don't like what I watched," Zimmer 
said. "I mean, who would? You name it and we did it. Maybe you get one like 
that, you get it out of your system. And I hope we did, because I've seen 
everything tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen (1-0) went eight innings, allowing three runs -- on home runs to 
Andre Dawson and Shawon Dunston -- and nine hits. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres hit Maddux softly in the first and hard in the fourth. And third 
baseman Luis Salazar made two errors. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble started immediately, when Alomar led off the bottom of the first 
with a ground ball a few steps to Dunston's right at shortstop. Dunston was 
slow getting over, and the ball snuck through into left field for a single. 
</P>
<P>
Alomar scored even though none of the next three batters hit the ball out of 
the infield. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts followed with a bunt, which Salazar bungled for error No. 1. Gwynn then 
blooped the ball toward the mound, and Maddux made a diving stab but missed. 
</P>
<P>
The bases were loaded, but Jack Clark grounded into a double play, scoring 
Alomar and moving Roberts to third. 
</P>
<P>
Then, with Carter at the plate, Maddux balked, allowing Roberts to score. 
</P>
<P>
So the Padres checked in with two runs and three hits for the inning -- and 
just three of seven batters got the ball out of the infield. 
</P>
<P>
If Cub outfielders were feeling put out, though, the Padres fixed that in the 
fourth by nearly hitting for the cycle in one inning. All that was missing was 
a home run. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago tripled to right. Templeton singled to right-center. Alomar tripled to 
left-center. Roberts took the next pitch and put it in nearly the same spot for 
a double. Gwynn was walked intentionally, and Clark reached first on Salazar's 
second fielding error. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the Cubs could come up for air, the Padres had four runs, four hits 
and a 6-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Former Padres Marvell Wynne and Luis Salazar were in San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium Tuesday for the first time since they were traded to the Cubs Aug. 31. 
There were smiles and handshakes around the batting cage before the game as 
they both spent some time visiting with former teammates. Padre outfielder 
Shawn Abner said he hadn't talked with Wynne since the day Wynne was traded. 
"He's too cheap to call me," Abner said, smiling. Yeah, Shawn, but couldn't you 
have called him? "I didn't like him as much as he liked me," Abner said. . . . 
Cub broadcaster Harry Carey, a member of the broadcasters' Hall of Fame, was 
stopped by a guard as he entered the stadium before Tuesday's game. Carey said 
the guard looked like a young student, and said the guy said he needed to check 
inside of Carey's black briefcase. Said Carey: "He said, 'I've got to look 
inside of that suitcase.' I said, 'That ain't no suitcase.' But he said he had 
to look in it anyway. Everybody around was howling . . . he was the only one 
taking it seriously."

MIKE DOWNEY: AS HARD AS THEY TRIED, IT'S AN OLD STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Turn out the red lights, the party's over. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Murphy, the man Edmonton got for Jimmy Carson, who was the man Edmonton got 
for Wayne Gretzky, wrote the finish to the Kings' season Tuesday night at the 
Forum. His overtime goal handed the Kings a 6-5 loss and a four-game Smythe 
Division playoff wipeout. 
</P>
<P>
Ow. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about adding Inglewood insult to injury. 
</P>
<P>
Here are the Edmonton Oilers, without the greatest hockey player since Gordie 
Howe, and how good are they? 
</P>
<P>
So good that, after Tuesday's game, Gretzky said: "I've never seen them play 
better." 
</P>
<P>
Seems sort of unfair that a team could trade Wayne Gretzky and get better. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky didn't play in this game; he watched it with a backache. The Kings, 
somewhat weirdly, played their two best games of the playoffs -- Game 1 versus 
Calgary and Game 4 versus Edmonton -- without Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
For a team that got broomed, the Kings went out like winners. Kelly Hrudey took 
shots to his sore ribs and turned them away. The Kings got their fans out of 
their seats and onto their feet with a rally from a 4-1 disadvantage that 
nearly sent them back to the Great White North. 
</P>
<P>
Crazy people, these King fans. They actually had the gall to chant "Ranford! 
Ranford!" taunting the one man, Edmonton goaltender Bill Ranford, who had been 
the star of the series. 
</P>
<P>
There is no truth the rumor that they didn't chant "Hrudey! Hrudey!" because 
they couldn't pronounce it. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings outshot the Oilers in every game of this series. That's how awesome 
Ranford was. They should have chanted his name after the game, as a nice 
gesture. 
</P>
<P>
But maybe, like the rest of us, they were too disappointed at another season of 
Los Angeles hockey going down the old Forum drain. 
</P>
<P>
This was the season the Kings could have lugged home the big silver jug. 
</P>
<P>
There was nobody else left out there who scared them -- not the Blues, 
Blackhawks, Bruins, Canadiens, Rangers or Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings can consider themselves victims of alignment. Calgary and Edmonton 
probably have been the two best teams in hockey over the last two seasons. If 
Los Angeles played in the other conference, it might have made both the 1989 
and 1990 Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, the NHL might realign the divisions, putting all the Canadian 
teams into one, and slipping the Kings into the Norris with St. Louis, Chicago, 
Detroit and the Minnesota (California?) North Stars. 
</P>
<P>
But, for the moment anyway, the Kings would rather not think about the future. 
</P>
<P>
They are a team centered by an 11-year veteran with a bad back (Wayne Gretzky). 
</P>
<P>
They are a team that relied this season on a 38-year-old defenseman (Larry 
Robinson), a 34-year-old right wing (Dave Taylor) and a 33-year-old left wing 
(John Tonelli). 
</P>
<P>
They no longer have Bernie Nicholls, Jimmy Carson, Mark Fitzpatrick, Martin 
Gelinas . . . 
</P>
<P>
They are a team that hasn't gone one step further with Gretzky than they went 
without Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
They are a team that took away Edmonton's greatest player and gave Edmonton 
millions of dollars and all sorts of draft choices and still can't get past the 
second round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
They are a team that did not play any better with Tom Webster as coach than 
with Robbie Ftorek as coach, and, in fact, during the regular season played 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
They are a too-old team that lacks draft choices. They remain unsettled in 
goal, not knowing whether to stay with Kelly Hrudey, give Mario Gosselin or Ron 
Scott a chance, or hope that young Robb Stauber will be physically and 
emotionally ready by fall. 
</P>
<P>
They have not gotten much out of Mikko Makela or Brian Benning, two guys who 
were supposed to be valuable pickups, and the jury is still out on whether 
Tomas Sandstrom and Tony Granato will make them rue the day they let Nicholls 
get away to New York. 
</P>
<P>
The best thing the Kings have going for them is Bruce McNall's pocketbook and 
his insatiable desire to bring Los Angeles a winner. 
</P>
<P>
If he does not produce a Cup finalist with Gretzky working for him, how can he 
be expected to deliver one without him? McNall might have to find some sucker 
willing to part with a Mario Lemieux-type for a few billion bucks. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky made hockey a happening in this town. Most of us wouldn't trade the 
last two seasons for anything. 
</P>
<P>
But, as we said at the time, the Kings were gambling an awful lot on giving up 
so much for Gretzky. They have gambled and lost. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't over yet, for him or for them. You never know what tomorrow will 
bring, and, like Scarlett O'Hara, they won't worry about tomorrow until 
tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
All we know is that, to win a Stanley Cup, the L.A. Kings need more than just a 
new division. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't enough to have the player. They need players -- plural.

NFL DRAFT LEAVES MORE THAN HALF OF JUNIORS OUT IN COLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brad Gaines, the Vanderbilt wingback who decided to forgo his senior season to 
take a shot at pro football, knew better than to sit around a silent telephone 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Although the NFL drafted five rounds of players that day, Gaines was confident 
that he would not be among them, and he wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
But he expected a call Monday. When in the final seven rounds it never came, he 
reluctantly took his place on a singular 1990 list: After 38 college juniors 
had been ruled eligible for the NFL this year, "18 were drafted and 20 
weren't," a spokesman for NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Tuesday, 
recalling that he had tried to discourage all of them from entering the draft. 
</P>
<P>
USC's Junior Seau was one of the 18. Gaines was one of the 20. 
</P>
<P>
"Last season I led the Southeastern Conference in receiving," Gaines said from 
Nashville, Tenn. "And I outplayed a lot of guys at the Indianapolis tryouts 
last month. At the least, I expected to go in the last couple of rounds." 
</P>
<P>
So did 19 others. What happened? How could so many college juniors gamble away 
their senior season? 
</P>
<P>
An analysis of their credentials shows that for most, it wasn't a good bet. 
Most were longshots. Many had had academic problems and were out of school 
anyway. Only two or three were as qualified for pro ball as Gaines. And, in 
fact, only three were starters last season on major college teams. 
</P>
<P>
The breakdown: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Seven of the undrafted 20 had come out of such unlikely schools as Oregon 
Tech and McGill. 
</P>
<P>
"The smaller the school, the more you need the experience of a senior season," 
George Young, general manager of the Giants, said from New York. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One wasn't even a junior. He had played no college ball. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Four were kickers or punters who weren't going to make it. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Steinberg, general manager of the New York Jets, said: "Only great kickers 
are drafted." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Four were backups who did not even impress their college coaches last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- That leaves only four who ever had played as big-school starters, the only 
ones who had any realistic chance. 
</P>
<P>
One of these was Gaines. The others were Washington free safety Eugene 
Burkhalter, Houston cornerback Cornelius Price and Minnesota's 1988 fullback, 
Octavius Gould, who was academically ineligible last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised that Burkhalter wasn't drafted," his coach, Don James, said 
from Seattle. "He's a good football player whose speed, I guess, was held 
against him. He could have been a starter for us the rest of his life." 
</P>
<P>
The Houston defensive back, Price, who stands 5 feet 10 and weighs 180, was a 
more typical junior applicant. Price had been declared academically ineligible 
for spring practice, and was taking makeup courses across the street at Texas 
Southern, when he decided to pack it in and shoot for the pros. They weren't 
interested. 
</P>
<P>
The Minnesota fullback, Gould, 6-1, 219, had blocked in 1988 for Darrell 
Thompson -- the prize-winning halfback chosen first by Green Bay Sunday -- but 
the pros are reluctant to take a player who sits out the season before the 
draft, as Gould did in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
They are also reluctant to take backup players. One of these is defensive back 
Anthony Burnett, the UCLA junior accepted for the draft this week. 
</P>
<P>
Burnett, a good special teams player who was on the field for only 24 scrimmage 
plays in 1988, had two strikes against him: Academically ineligible, he missed 
1989. And he never started for the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
Other junior backups in the draft this week were fullback Braxton Banks, who 
played behind Anthony Johnson at Notre Dame; Danny Cash, a second-string tackle 
at Alabama, and Sean Barowski, who in two seasons of college football was a 
backup fullback first at Penn State and then at Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Banks, who is expected to graduate next month, would have been a 
redshirt senior at Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
As a Vanderbilt starter, Gaines had a better pro chance than most of the 
others. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the NFL is missing out on a good one," he said. "They like backs who 
catch the ball well, and you're talking to one. Looking back, I think I decided 
to come out too late. I only decided on the day of the deadline, and that 
didn't give (the scouts) enough time." 
</P>
<P>
Gaines and the Washington defensive back, Burkhalter, both expect to catch on 
as free agents somewhere in pro ball this spring, although, at the moment, some 
scouts consider Burkhalter, 6-1, 200, a bit too heavy and too slow. 
</P>
<P>
"They timed him in the 4.7 category," the Husky coach, James, said. "How fast 
do you suppose Ronnie Lott is now? A good player can excel without great speed. 
We felt that if (Burkhalter) got his body fat down some he'd be as quick as you 
see. 
</P>
<P>
"His other problem is that he got an agent, and that makes him ineligible (for 
college football) under NCAA rules. You don't need an agent at Washington. We 
have three faculty members here well versed in pro contracts and the like. 
</P>
<P>
"Next time, if one of our players applies to the NFL and doesn't have an agent, 
we'll take him back, if he wants to come back, and challenge the rule." 
</P>
<P>
That's next time. This time, there are 20 football-playing juniors in limbo.

BOXERS MUST PAY FINES TO HAVE SUSPENSIONS LIFTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The indefinite suspensions for Texas boxers Edward Parker and Gaby Canizales 
will be lifted when they pay fines levied by the California Athletic Commission 
for failing drug tests after Forum fights, it was announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, 24, of Houston, was suspended when a drug test after a March 16 fight 
revealed traces of cocaine. He was fined $1,000 and will be subject to random 
drug testing for one year by the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Canizales was fined $500 for failing to notify the commission he was on 
prescribed medication. His suspension came when a drug test after a Feb. 12 
fight revealed traces of Darvon and norpropoxyphene.

BANKE'S FIRST TITLE DEFENSE WILL BE JULY 14 IN SEOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Banke of Quail Valley, the new World Boxing Council super-bantamweight 
champion, must defend his title July 14 in Seoul, it was determined Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Banke (19-4) won the championship at the Forum Monday in dramatic fashion, 
stopping Daniel Zaragoza in the ninth round while behind on points. 
</P>
<P>
He inherited Zaragoza's mandatory WBC defense against top-ranked Lee 
Seung-hoon. 
</P>
<P>
Forum matchmaker Tony Curtis tried unsuccessfully Tuesday to get the Banke-Lee 
fight for the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked with the South Korean promoter about it, but he told us he's already 
committed to TV for July 14 in Seoul," Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
Banke, one-time amateur standout from Azusa, earned $15,000 by beating 
Zaragoza. He will make at least $50,000 against Lee 
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, there was talk of a Banke-Jorge Paez fight for NBC. Paez, the 
International Boxing Federation featherweight champion, is, like Banke, a free 
swinging puncher. EARL GUSTKEY

MELVIN DURSLAG: THERE ARE GAMES EVEN BO CAN'T CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Melvin Durslag 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is time, as a matter of routine, to run a check on Bo Jackson, 
multi-entrepreneur, to find out how he is proceeding in April in the game of 
rounders. 
</P>
<P>
The Kansas City people, by whom Bo is employed, inform you, at the time this 
prose is constructed, that Bo has come to bat 51 times, without interruption. 
As a general rule, Bo is interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
He is credited with 17 hits, including three doubles which, we are told, start 
out to be singles, but expand to two bases when Bo catches the outfielders 
thinking about moonlight on Lake Como. 
</P>
<P>
"When Bo starts to run," the Kansas City spokesman says, "fielders had better 
not think about anything but Bo." 
</P>
<P>
Bo also is striking out at just about the rate he did in 1989 when, in 515 
at-bats, he fanned 172 times. 
</P>
<P>
That amounts to roughly one fan per three at-bats, proving that if outfielders 
lose track of Bo, pitchers don't. 
</P>
<P>
You may not have caught this in your research but, as a junior in high school, 
Bo pitched. He finished with a record of 9-1. 
</P>
<P>
Because he also hit .450, his career as a pitcher ended, the coach shifting him 
to the outfield the next season. 
</P>
<P>
People always seem to be shifting Bo. At Auburn, he is playing baseball when 
the track coach figures he should be sprinting, too. He takes Bo to the Florida 
Relays, where he wins the 100 meters in 10.13. 
</P>
<P>
This season, as in seasons before, Bo converses rarely with the sporting press. 
</P>
<P>
The press shrugs, as Charlie Dressen shrugged when Joe DiMaggio rejected his 
advice on when to look for the curveball. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie wasn't offended. And he had the last laugh when DiMaggio's streak ends 
at only 56. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Bo doesn't converse excessively with anyone, maybe a blessing when 
you listen to, and read about, the young guys recently drafted in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Some have a lot to say, if not too much. Sizing up his emotional structure, one 
announces he is going to a team that fits his personality. 
</P>
<P>
Another describes, with dramatic gusto, the joys of hitting. And a 
pronunciamento we never before had heard comes from another. He says he wants 
to win. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone is making a statement. But Bo, he shuts up. And he advises guys coming 
into pro sports to shut up, pointing out that rhetoric is useful only in 
debates. 
</P>
<P>
As you know, Bo departs Kansas City each October to join the football Raiders 
in progress. First, he joins them in Los Angeles. Then he is ready to join them 
in Irwindale when it next develops he will join them in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Informed to make plans to join them in Oakland, he is back to joining them in 
Los Angeles, with the possibility existing he could yet join them in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
That's even before St. Louis, Baltimore, Jacksonville and Charlotte are heard 
from. 
</P>
<P>
Wherever Bo joins the Raiders, he figures to be joining them a minimum of two 
more seasons, completing a five-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
If Bo does this, a fat treasure, in the form of a balloon payment, comes his 
way, and Bo isn't a prospect to walk away from it. Bo has big muscles, but they 
aren't in his head. 
</P>
<P>
But would he play in the Los Angeles Coliseum if the historic architecture, a 
tower of ancient beauty, were to be defaced by renovation? 
</P>
<P>
"My contract specifies," he is apt to say, "that I am bound only to a stadium 
bearing all the glory that was Rome and the grandeur that was Greece. If the 
architecture changes, the Raiders face forfeiture of their money to me, and I 
report them to the Audubon Society, or whatever society stands at the forefront 
on this issue." 
</P>
<P>
Bo would be informed: "The Audubon Society is not involved. But it offers to 
help. It will provide Coliseum-servationists with bird nests for hats." 
</P>
<P>
At Kansas City, Bo has just finished a video with Billy Crystal for charity. 
Billy always aspired to be a second baseman. Instead, he makes a picture called 
"When Harry Met Sally," in which Sally fakes an orgasm in a coffee shop. 
</P>
<P>
Feeling she needs help, Billy forgets about baseball, showing how big careers 
in sports can be expunged by little events.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<P>
Jerry Buss should be able to afford the $25,000-fine levied against the Lakers 
for not playing Magic Johnson and James Worthy Sunday night at Portland. The 
receipts from a pair of Jack Nicholson-row season tickets -- less $3,700 -- 
will pay the bill. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In the final game of the 1989 baseball season, the Toronto Blue Jays, who 
already had clinched the American League East championship, rested six regulars 
and their normal starting pitcher against the Baltimore Orioles. Toronto lost 
before a capacity crowd of 49,469 at home, 7-5. The league took no action. . .

Reports of the demise of thoroughbred racing at Hollywood Park have been

There has been an unprecedented demand for stall space, nearly $1 million was

In one corner Monday night at the Forum was World Boxing Council 
super-bantamweight champion Daniel (the Lion Hearted) Zaragoza. In the other 
was challenger Paul Banke, wearing the lettering "All Heart" on his trunks. 
Both fighters then showed plenty of ticker, the bloodied Banke rallying in the 
ninth round to stop the even more bloodied Zaragoza. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Southpaws often put audiences to sleep. Maybe the secret is to match two of 
them, like Banke and Zaragoza. . . .

<P>
How ferocious was the fight? Well, they exchanged punches before the bell that 
began the fourth round. . . .

It isn't easy to put together lively cards regularly these days, but John

Agents for Baylor linebacker James Francis and North Carolina State defensive 
end Ray Agnew reportedly listened to the same contract offer from the Chicago

<P>
Some NFL team should hand a gold-plated invitation to rookie camp to wide 
receiver John Jackson, who wasn't drafted after setting a USC record for 
receptions. He gets the job done although he isn't big or particularly fast. 
But then, who would want another Steve Largent?

The Raiders, who aren't bulging with quarterback talent, should at least take a

TYSON TO FACE TILLMAN IN LAS VEGAS, KING ANNOUNCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Tyson's first opponent since losing the heavyweight title in February to 
Buster Douglas will be Henry Tillman, the last fighter to defeat Tyson before 
Douglas' victory in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson will share an outdoors heavyweight doubleheader with another former 
champion, George Foreman, at Caesars Palace June 16, promoter Don King 
announced Tuesday night. Foreman meets the first ranked opponent he has faced 
in his 21-bout, three-year comeback, Adilson Rodrigues of Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
Tillman was 2-0 against Tyson as an amateur in 1984. Tillman, beat Tyson, then 
17, twice at the U.S. Olympic boxing trials and kept him out of the Olympics. 
Tillman was the Olympic heavyweight champion in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson graduated to far greater achievements as a pro than Tillman. Tyson won 
his first world heavyweight title in 1986 and earned nearly $50 million in 
1988. He seemed unbeatable when Douglas, a 42-1 underdog, registered one of 
sport's all-time upsets with a 10th-round knockout Feb. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Tillman was selected as Tyson's first post-Douglas foe after a series of 
possible opponents would not agree on what King was said to be offering, about 
$250,000. Rejected for what King called outlandish demands were Alex Stewart, 
Renaldo Snipes, Greg Page and Walter Masseroni of Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
Tillman, 6-3 and 220 pounds, turned pro in 1984 and had a 10-0 record, but was 
upset by Bert Cooper in June, 1986. In February, 1987, he dropped down to fight 
Evander Holyfield at cruiserweight (195 pounds) and was stopped in the seventh 
round. 
</P>
<P>
His career seemed to bottom out in November, 1987, when he was stopped by 
journeyman sparring partner Duane Bonds at Las Vegas. Since then, he has fought 
only four times, losing a decision at Edmonton, Canada, to Willie deWit, then 
stopping three little-known fighters. Tillman had defeated deWit in 1984 to win 
the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
Tillman, 29, is 20-4, with 14 knockouts. Tyson, 23, is 37-1, with 33 knockouts.

NEWSWIRE: UMPIRE IS CAUGHT STEALING BASEBALL CARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A veteran National League umpire was charged with stealing 4,180 baseball cards 
from a Target retail store in Bakersfield, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Engel, 56, was released on $5,000 bail from Kern County Jail Saturday and 
is scheduled to be arraigned May 2 on misdemeanor counts of commercial burglary 
and petty theft, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A Target security officer told police that Engel put seven boxes of Score brand 
baseball cards, valued at $143.98, into a brown paper bag he pulled from the 
waist band of his pants. 
</P>
<P>
Engel was detained as he walked out of the store with the bag, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Engel, who completed his first full year in the major leagues in 1966, was back 
at work Sunday, when he was first-base umpire at the Dodger-Houston Astro game. 
</P>
<P>
Engel was home plate umpire at Tuesday night's Padre-Chicago Cub game at San 
Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"At this time I'm not making any comment about it," Engel said.

Wayne Presley and Michel Goulet scored 36 seconds apart in the second period 
and rookie Ed Belfour won his first playoff start as the Chicago Blackhawks 
defeated the St. Louis Blues, 3-2, Tuesday night, evening their playoff series, 
2-2. 
</P>
<P>
Belfour was spectacular in the third period, protecting a one-goal lead with 18 
saves. 
</P>
<P>
He finished with 31. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Millen started the Blackhawks' first 10 playoff games in goal, though he 
had been replaced by Belfour in four of them. Millen did not dress for Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
Presley got his seventh goal of the playoffs, surpassing his season total of 
six, on a screened shot at 2:06. Goulet made it 2-0 when he knocked in a loose 
puck that goaltender Vincent Riendeau failed to clear. 
</P>
<P>
Trent Yawney scored the winning goal with Blue standout Brett Hull penalized 
for drawing blood from the face of Chicago's Jocelyn Lemieux with his stick. 
Hull received a major penalty and a game misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux had been hanging on Hull when Hull swung at him, receiving his first 
penalty minutes of the playoffs. Hull, who has a playoff-leading 10 goals and 
17 points, also had an eight-game scoring streak stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Yawney scored on the resulting five-minute power play, getting his second goal 
of the playoffs on a shot from the point at 18:09.

MCMACKIN TEMPERS EL CAMINO REAL BATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reed McMackin admittedly has the fabled temper of an Irishman. 
</P>
<P>
So, too, it seems, does Ryan McGuire. 
</P>
<P>
And both showed it in Tuesday's West Valley League baseball showdown between 
Chatsworth and El Camino Real highs. 
</P>
<P>
Still smarting from an early-season loss to McGuire and El Camino Real, 
McMackin, a senior right-hander, psyched himself into a controlled rage for the 
rematch. And he confounded the Conquistadores, hurling a three-hitter with six 
strikeouts as the Chancellors emerged with a 9-3 victory at Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
The win moved Chatsworth (16-4-1, 8-3-1 in league play) to within two games of 
first-place El Camino Real (13-2-1, 10-1-1) with both teams scheduled to play 
again Thursday at Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to come out and beat them and prove to people that I had some stuff," 
said McMackin, who improved his record to 7-2. "It was kind of a moral victory. 
I've never pitched well against these guys." 
</P>
<P>
McMackin was charged with the loss last month when El Camino Real defeated 
Chatsworth, 6-2. McGuire, a senior left-hander who has signed to attend UCLA, 
allowed only one hit in 5 1/3 innings to earn the win. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, McGuire (5-1) walked five batters in the first inning (he threw 47 
pitches) and eight by the time he exited in the fourth with Chatsworth ahead, 
5-0. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire, who was hitless in three at-bats, also struck out twice -- both times 
swinging at 3-2 fastballs. He has struck out only five times this season. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, a visibly disgusted McGuire sarcastically remarked that his head was 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no excuse for a performance like that," McGuire said, fuming. "I 
didn't pitch well at all. The first inning was a pretty good indication of how 
I was throwing. I had a lousy day." 
</P>
<P>
Despite wildness, McGuire struck out the side in the first inning and limited 
Chatsworth to a 2-0 lead. He struck out the side in order in the second inning 
and in the third collected his seventh of eight strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire, however, walked three more batters in the fourth and allowed three 
hits as Chatsworth scored six times. 
</P>
<P>
Adam Pearlman and Mike Mancuso did the most damage with run-scoring singles in 
the inning. 
</P>
<P>
McMackin retired 11 of the first 12 batters he faced before El Camino Real 
struck for two runs -- one unearned -- in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
McMackin doused the threat with consecutive strikeouts of Sean Boldt and 
pinch-hitter Evan Howland with a runner at second.

NORTHRIDGE COULD PROFIT MORE FROM A SMALL GATE; 
</P>
<P>
VOLLEYBALL: MATADOR COACH BANKING ON PARTISAN CROWD FOR HELP IN WIVA TOURNAMENT 
OPENER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By decree of the Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn., the host school of 
the conference's postseason tournament must funnel all proceeds from the event 
to its men's volleyball program. 
</P>
<P>
Which means that Coach John Price of Cal State Northridge can be excused if 
images of dollar signs are dancing in his head. 
</P>
<P>
But, truth be told, Price cares very little how much money is generated during 
the three-day, six-team tournament that begins this evening and ends Saturday 
in the CSUN gym. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than filling the stands with fans willing to pay $10 for a reserved seat 
or $7.50 for general admission, Price would rather see students -- preferably 
from CSUN -- at the price of $5 each. 
</P>
<P>
Forget visions of the almighty buck. Price would settle for a rerun of 
Northridge's WIVA match against Pepperdine in March. More than 1,500 showed up 
at CSUN to watch the Matadors' four-game victory, but only 475 tickets were 
purchased. Students attended free. 
</P>
<P>
"Either a lot of people snuck in doors, or there were a lot of students," Price 
said. "Even though students don't help (as much) at the box office, they're 
absolutely critical to our program." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the Matadors could use any support a partisan crowd could offer. 
Northridge's first-round opponent at 7:30 is second-ranked USC, which has 
defeated CSUN in eight of 10 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans are 22-4 overall and 12-4 in WIVA play, good for only third place 
in the hotly contested Wilson Division. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (13-11), which has never defeated USC in 19 non-tournament matches, 
lost two regular-season matches to the Trojans this season and earned a split 
decision in a pair of tournaments. The Matadors won consecutive games, 15-11, 
15-11, against USC in the Santa Barbara tournament in January. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the CSUN-USC match will play third-ranked UCLA (22-4), champion 
of the DeGroot Division, on Thursday night at 7:30. The winner of tonight's 
5:30 match between Stanford (14-6) and UC Santa Barbara (13-14) will play 
top-ranked Cal State Long Beach (25-6) on Thursday at 5:30 in the other 
semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night's winners will meet in the title match Saturday at 7:30 p.m. and 
the champion will receive the conference's automatic qualifying berth to the 
national Final Four on May 4-5. 
</P>
<P>
Sixth-ranked Northridge is a combined 1-7 in regular-season matches against its 
tournament opponents, having gone 1-1 against Santa Barbara. The Matadors, 
however, have extended Long Beach and UCLA to five games and have defeated both 
the Bruins and USC in tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
"We've proven we can play with any team in the country," Price said. "We're 
good enough to win it, but then so is everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
A raucous home crowd, Price believes, could make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
"At SC and UCLA, volleyball is just another sport and just another national 
championship," Price said. "But at Northridge, it's important. We're a very 
young and emotional team, and when we're up we tend to play very good 
volleyball. With a crowd, even when we hit a flat spot, all it's going to take 
is a few good plays to turn it around." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge will start freshmen Coley Kyman, Ken Lynch and Gary Reznick, along 
with juniors Neil Coffman, Mark Root and Raphael Tulino against USC, the WIVA's 
top hitting team. 
</P>
<P>
Coffman was sixth in the WIVA in digs (2.02 per game) and seventh in kill 
average (5.39). Root was fifth in service aces (20) and Kyman was sixth with 94 
blocks. 
</P>
<P>
USC is led by Bryan Ivie, a junior who led the conference in kill average 
(7.81) and was fourth in hitting percentage (.411). 
</P>
<P>
Former Harvard High teammates Robert Hillman and Mike Lowe will play for 
Stanford against Santa Barbara tonight.

HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: SEASONED EFFORTS OF JONES FLAVOR FRESHMAN 
SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE GLAZE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For Marion Jones, there is still one question left unanswered after the Mt. San 
Antonio College Relays last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
What if? 
</P>
<P>
The Rio Mesa High freshman streaked to a nation-leading 54.21-second clocking 
in the 400 meters at Mt. SAC, but the false-start disqualification of 
Bakersfield sophomore Janice Nichols left the Spartan standout with mixed 
emotions. 
</P>
<P>
Before Saturday, Nichols had the nation's fastest 400 time at 54.50. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kind of happy and kind of sad," Jones said of Nichols' mishap, but she 
added that she might have broken the age-14 record (53.82 set by Denean Howard 
of Kennedy in 1979) had Nichols stayed in the race. 
</P>
<P>
To Rio Mesa co-Coach Brian FitzGerald, the outcome of the race might have been 
decided before the runners left their starting blocks. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the race certainly changed," FitzGerald said of Nichols' 
disqualification. "She (Jones) probably breathed a sigh of relief but may have 
been disappointed that she didn't get to race against the best." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her lofty status, Jones will not run another open 400 this season. 
Instead, she will prepare for the 100 and 200 in next month's Southern Section 
3-A Division championships. 
</P>
<P>
Being the top-ranked 400 runner in the nation can be a heavy load for a 
ninth-grader, but the newcomer image is wearing off. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't look at me as a freshman anymore," Jones said of her opposition. 
"Half of them probably don't know I'm a freshman." 
</P>
<P>
Which isn't surprising. Jones neither looks, acts, nor thinks like a freshman. 
To wit: 
</P>
<P>
* Jones stands 5-foot-9 and reportedly can jump and touch a basketball rim 10 
feet overhead. 
</P>
<P>
* Earlier this season, Jones posted times of 11.76 and 23.80 for 100 and 200 
meters, both of which rank her second in the nation behind Pasadena Muir senior 
Inger Miller. 
</P>
<P>
* When Jones loses a sprint race, which has happened only three times this 
season -- all to Miller -- FitzGerald said his protege looks forward to the 
next confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
"She's not easily intimidated," FitzGerald said. "She is really an aggressive 
athlete. If she's beaten, next time she says she's going to close the gap a 
little more." 
</P>
<P>
Since Miller thrashed Jones, 11.48 to 11.76, in their first meeting March 17 in 
the Northridge/Alemany Relays, Jones was set on revenge. At the Arcadia 
Invitational on April 7, Jones used an explosive start to finish within .02 
seconds of Miller, the national leader in that event at 11.48.

STATWATCH: ANTELOPE VALLEY RESTORES ORDER TO ITS LINEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A little reorganization can do wonders. 
</P>
<P>
A case in point is the Antelope Valley High baseball team, which has won seven 
of its past nine games -- including four of five in Golden League play -- since 
Coach Mike Van Cheri shuffled his lineup three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
With the Antelopes' batting average hovering at .270, Van Cheri used his eraser 
as well as his pencil while filling out the lineup card for a showdown with 
Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
The changes: Chad Eberhardt was moved from No. 2 to the leadoff position, David 
Cooke went from first to third, Jeff Bishop from third to seventh and Jeff 
Whiteford from eighth to second. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Cox and Jade Freeman remained in the fourth and fifth positions. 
</P>
<P>
The result: The Antelopes banged out 16 hits and a 13-12 victory over Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since that game, we've been on a roll," Van Cheri said. 
</P>
<P>
Heading into Tuesday's game, the Antelopes had batted .364 (78 for 214) during 
the stretch and had raised their average to .310. 
</P>
<P>
Some individual averages: Cooke .429 (27 for 63); Freeman .385 (20 for 52); 
Whiteford .381 (16 for 42); Eberhardt .304 (17 for 56). 
</P>
<P>
Pitching: Hart senior left-hander Andrew Lorraine turned in perhaps the finest 
performance of his career last Friday, hurling a two-hitter with 15 strikeouts 
in a 5-0 Foothill League win over Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine, who has committed to Stanford, made only 97 pitches and allowed just 
two singles. He began with four perfect innings before yielding an infield 
single to begin the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Josh Brown and Jason Mansfield, Birmingham's righty-lefty starting rotation, 
have thrown 17 complete games between them. Brown (10-2), a senior, leads 
region players with 10 and Mansfield (3-3) has seven. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood's Erik Martinez has not allowed an earned run in his last 25 
innings and has pitched back-to-back shutouts, a 1-0 win over San Pedro and a 
one-hit, 7-0, Valley Pac-8 Conference win over Monroe.

SAILING: TRACY EDWARDS AND HER ALL-FEMALE CREW ARE OVERCOMING STEREOTYPES AND 
IMPRESSING COMPETITORS IN RACE AROUND THE WORLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

FT. LAUDERDALE, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Tracy Edwards of England rounded up 11 friends to sail in a race around 
the world, some in the yacht set nudged one another and made jokes about Gidget 
Goes to Sea. 
</P>
<P>
They wished her luck, waved her off -- and put the Coast Guard on alert. 
</P>
<P>
When she drove her 58-foot sailboat Maiden toward the icebergs, gales, 
four-story seas and other horrors of the Southern Ocean, they paled: This had 
gone far enough. 
</P>
<P>
Not quite. She and her crew had thousands of miles to go before they rested. On 
Sept. 2 at Portsmith, England, they began sailing in this Whitbread Round the 
World race. The competition is divided into four divisions, determined by boat 
size. Never before had there been an all-female crew. 
</P>
<P>
More than the ocean, Edwards feared failure, so she kept sailing, withstanding 
stereotypes as well as the sea. 
</P>
<P>
"You're brought up from when you're that high," Edwards said, reaching toward 
the deck, "that women can't do certain things that guys can." 
</P>
<P>
But, she said, English women are a lot like American women: "When we decide to 
do something, we just go do it. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that we've done it, they're all (saying), 'Brilliant . . . well done.' 
They're surprised and pleased." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards has a confession to make. She wasn't sure they could do it, either. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though we said, 'Oh yes, we can do it,' we were a bit nervous because we 
didn't know what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
"This race has been an education for all 12 women on Maiden. It was a total 
experiment . . . never been done before. People weren't aggressively opposed to 
us doing it. They just didn't think we could." 
</P>
<P>
So 29,095 nautical miles later, with only 3,837 to go, the yachting world is 
impressed. So is Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've got the best crew in the race," she said. "We're the only crew 
apart from (first-place) Steinlager that hasn't changed on the way around." 
</P>
<P>
By the time they're done, that will be about nine months in the same boat. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd been told time and again we wouldn't get on, (that) we were gonna argue 
and be unhappy, so there was a bit of trepidation," said Edwards, who sold her 
house to buy the boat. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's been unbelievable. They're all very special ladies or they wouldn't 
be there, and there were about 200 other applicants that could have easily gone 
with us." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards had no trouble collecting a crew. She received 460 applications and 
interviewed more than 100 candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"They were picked on an instinctive liking -- not just me for them but them for 
me, as well," she said. "They have to trust me a lot to let me take them around 
the world, when everyone was telling me it wasn't possible. 
</P>
<P>
"If they walked into my office and we both clicked, they're on the boat now." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards replaced the original first mate when it appeared she wouldn't work 
out. The other 10 selections remained. They represent seven nationalities. 
Three are married. 
</P>
<P>
One -- Dawn Riley, 25, of Detroit -- is an American. A former captain of the 
Michigan State sailing team, she signed up when she found herself "between 
jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards will write a book that has its own stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing we have learned is that women are a lot more adaptable than men," 
she said. "I've done the race with 17 guys on a maxi, and I've done the race 
with 11 women, so it's very clear to me: women have different problems on the 
boat, but privacy doesn't seem to be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got one head (restroom) on the boat. It's tiny and you can spend only a 
short time in there before someone else needs to come in. But it hasn't been a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
In the last Whitbread race, Edwards, 28, sailed with 17 males. One guess what 
her position was: (a) captain, (b) grinder, (c) cook. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an infinitely better job," she said. 
</P>
<P>
From the galley in that other race, she watched and listened as the rest of the 
crew got on one another's nerves, day by day. It hasn't been that way on 
Maiden. 
</P>
<P>
"Women seem to be a lot more comfortable with each other in an enclosed space 
than the guys were," she said. "They all get on brilliantly together. It's not 
out of necessity. They actually like each other and respect each other and 
they're all fighting for the same thing. We all want to win." 
</P>
<P>
Maiden is second among the five boats that started in Division D. Going into 
the final leg, it trailed the French entry, L'Esprit de Liberte, by 41 1/2 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Maiden has won Beefeater trophies for placing first in her division on two of 
the five legs -- defeating all the men, of course. 
</P>
<P>
"Men are much more aggressive and competitive with each other on a boat than 
women are," Edwards said. "We don't feel any need for it." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said: "A lot of guys who have done their own projects have big egos that 
get in the way." 
</P>
<P>
The only problem is strength. 
</P>
<P>
"Although you can sail the boat with brains and common sense, you still need 
strength," said Edwards, a former ballet dancer who is 5-feet-2 1/2, 119 
pounds. "That's why we work so well together, because we can't pump up a huge 
sail in one throw. We have to have two of us. We need each other. 
</P>
<P>
"It works so well it's been even better than I thought it would be. It's 
changed our lives forever." 
</P>
<P>
The only concession Edwards made was in her choice of boats. She opted for one 
of the smaller, Division D entries, knowing it would be easier to handle -- 
easier, not easy. 
</P>
<P>
She calls it a "sensible size," compared to one of the event's monster, 80-foot 
maxis, which she regards as "very powerful, very dangerous boats. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to have any accidents or do anything which anyone would pick up 
on and say, 'There, I told you they couldn't do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
The boat placed fourth in the '81-82 race but was 10 years old and needed a lot 
of work. The women did it themselves, sanding, scraping, drilling and rigging. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made the boat faster than it was when it was Disque d'Or III," Edwards 
said. "We've got every right to feel proud of ourselves and proud of women in 
general. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a similar response from women all over the world. We wanted to 
project ourselves right from the beginning as not being women's lib or 
feminists. What we wanted to say was, you don't have to be like that if you 
want to sail. 
</P>
<P>
"Girls can sail. They don't have to be macho. That's all we wanted to say." 
</P>

POINT LOMA HOLDS OFF MIRA MESA

<TEXT>
<P>
As far as Mira Mesa Coach Mike Prosser is concerned, the cast reaching to star 
pitcher Mike Bovee's thigh, has immobilized more than his leg. It has paralyzed 
the confidence of some of his players. 
</P>
<P>
Bovee, playing shortstop, suffered a broken ankle Thursday against Serra in a 
play at second base. Tuesday, he sat on the sidelines and watched Point Loma 
jump all over top-ranked Mira Mesa early, then hold on for a 6-5 victory in a 
pivotal City Eastern League game at Mira Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"Bovee is outstanding, and (Marc) Nielsen's a good pitcher," said Point Loma 
Coach Rod Hall. "But I don't know who else they have." 
</P>
<P>
Prosser is beginning to wonder as well. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a big part of our team," he said, "but one player doesn't make a team. If 
we think we can't win without him, then we have a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Mira Mesa's problems began in the third. Point Loma took a 2-0 lead when Chason 
Booher scored on an error by left fielder Joey Lo Duca and on Matt Ray's RBI 
single to shallow right. 
</P>
<P>
The problems worsened when Point Loma went through its order in the sixth and 
scored four runs on three hits, one walk, one error and one hit batter. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Mesa countered with a four-run sixth of its own, scoring on a walk, a hit 
batter, and a two-run single by Nielsen. 
</P>
<P>
About this time, Bill Hall, Point Loma's coach, was begining to feel his 
stomach churn. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lost two game in the bottom of the seventh," he said. "I didn't want to 
see that happen again." 
</P>
<P>
Hall was spared. Although Mira Mesa scored one in the seventh on two walks, a 
sacrifice bunt and a fly ball to center field, the Marauders left the tying run 
on second on a groundout to closer Dan Maringer, a sophomore, who came into the 
inning to relieve Ray. With no outs and one on, Maringer walked the first 
batter he faced, but got the next three in order. 
</P>
<P>
Starter Mel Shanley (5-2) gave up three hits and walked three in five innings 
-- he also faced three batters in the sixth -- and picked up the victory. 
Maringer got the save. 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma (11-10, 5-2) is in a two-way league tie with Mira Mesa (16-3, 5-2).

HORSE NOT IN DERBY WINS PREP; 
</P>
<P>
LEXINGTON STAKES: SORE SHINS PREVENTED HOME AT LAST -- WINNER AT KEENELAND -- 
FROM ENTERING TRIPLE CROWN.

<TEXT>
<P>
Another Kentucky Derby prep was won by a horse not nominated for the Triple 
Crown races when Home at Last scored a two-length victory Tuesday in the 
$112,900 Lexington Stakes at Keeneland. 
</P>
<P>
Stalwart Charger, winner of Saturday's California Derby at Golden Gate Fields, 
also wasn't nominated for the Triple Crown -- the Derby, the Preakness and the 
Belmont. Stalwart Charger's omission occurred because of a mix-up, but Home at 
Last was left off by design after sore shins forced his trainer, Carl Nafzger, 
to remove him from training late as a 2-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
A horse could have been nominated for the Triple Crown by paying $600 by Jan. 
17, or $3,000 by March 17. 
</P>
<P>
The Lexington did produce at least one candidate for the Derby at Churchill 
Downs on May 5. Pleasant Tap, who missed the Blue Grass April 14 because of a 
fever that cost him 10 days of training, ran second despite a troubled trip, 
and after the race his trainer, Chris Speckert, indicated that the son of 
Pleasant Colony -- the 1981 Derby winner -- would be heading for Churchill 
Downs. 
</P>
<P>
Pleasant Tap finished five lengths in front of Thirty Slews, who was 2 1/2 
lengths better than Slew of Angels. Following them across the finish line, in 
order, were Armed for Peace, Big E.Z., Cordoba, Sling Shot and Smelly, the 3-1 
favorite who was in contention until the far turn, but took a bad step and was 
eased by his jockey, Jean Cruguet. Video Ranger and Five on Five were 
scratched. 
</P>
<P>
A 17-horse field is likely for the Derby, headed by the co-favorites, Summer 
Squall and Mister Frisky. The others are Video Ranger, Pleasant Tap, Silver 
Ending, Thirty Six Red, Unbridled, Land Rush, Real Cash, Killer Diller, Burnt 
Hills, Pendleton Ridge, Dr. Bobby A., Country Day, Nuits St. Georges, Fighting 
Fantasy and Shot Gun Scott. 
</P>
<P>
Nafzger trains both Unbridled and Home at Last, the Quadratic-Away from Home 
colt who won his third consecutive start Tuesday. Home at Last earned $73,385 
for his owner, Russell L. Reineman of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Reineman and I have no regrets about not making Home at Last eligible," 
Nafzger said. "He would have been pushing him (by running in the Derby), and 
might have hurt the horse. There are a lot of other races later in the year, 
and some we have in mind are the Illinois Derby (at Sportsman's Park) and the 
Travers (at Saratoga)." 
</P>
<P>
Home at Last, ridden by Jerry Bailey, paid $17.20 to win and ran 1 1/16 miles 
in a creditable 1:43 2/5. While Slew of Angels and Smelly pushed the 
pace-setter, Thirty Slews, Home at Last and Bailey waited in the second tier, 
within easy range of the leaders. Home at Last overtook Thirty Slews at the top 
of the stretch and had no trouble holding off Pleasant Tap and Kent Desormeaux, 
who was riding the colt for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey, who does not have a Derby mount, gave up Thirty Six Red, Saturday's 
Wood Memorial winner, when that colt and Home at Last were both running on 
April 7. Thirty Six Red, under Mike Smith, won the Gotham at Aqueduct, and 
Bailey won the Preview at Gulfstream Park with Home at Last. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this horse (Home at Last) has as much ability as any of them, but he 
doesn't have as much experience," Bailey said. "He might be better eventually. 
I think he'll be good to me in the long run."

JACK SMITH: WILL THE DUST EVER CLEAR IN VACUUM CLEANER DEBATE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The vacuum cleaner has never been my friend. I thought I was through with it. 
But now it has got me in a lot of trouble I never anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Morrison Taw, twentysomething, is not the first to take offense at 
these lines I wrote about my distaste for that infernal appliance: 
</P>
<P>
"It is not so much the machine's awkwardness that annoys me as its sound. 
Awkward it is. The snout has a tendency to go its own way, and one has to 
manhandle it, like an obstinate dog on a leash. But its whine is insufferable. 
It has been a rule in our house for years that my wife is not to use the vacuum 
while I'm working. Of course my wife no longer uses the vacuum. That is done by 
our housecleaning woman, who is impervious to my rules." 
</P>
<P>
Ms. Taw is also offended by an earlier paragraph of mine: "It seems ironic to 
me that in this age, when technology has reduced housework to an almost 
pleasant minimum, so many women should want to leave home for the stress and 
grinding competition of the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
Ms. Taw says that comment fails to represent most of the people she's ever met. 
"For those of us in our 20s, entering the work force is not usually a choice, 
for either men or women." She argues that neither a husband nor a wife makes 
enough money on entering the work force to support both, and neither wishes to 
stay at home, being supported rather than having his or her own career. 
</P>
<P>
"I can identify better with the vacuum cleaner . . . than with a wife who obeys 
'rules,' allows you to leave the odious vacuuming to her rather than sharing 
the burden, and then carefully avoids irritating you with it as you write these 
charming columns." 
</P>
<P>
Well, there have to be rules. They work both ways. My wife has a rule, for 
example, that I have to watch football on TV in the bedroom, shutting the door, 
while she's laundering her intimate things in the kitchen. Football annoys her 
the way the vacuum cleaner does me. (It is perhaps irrelevant, but I was in the 
bedroom watching a Rams game when I had my heart attack.) 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," Ms. Taw goes on in her piquant style, "if you spend time with 
people of my generation and are simply impervious to what we are doing; whether 
you are writing your column for a very specific audience and find other 
realities irrelevant; or whether you have such a beautifully subtle sense of 
humor that the chauvinism is all ironic and intended to point out its own 
narrowness. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Well, heck; of course it's all ironic. I can hardly put pen to paper (that's an 
old-fashioned figure of speech) without irony creeping in. As for understanding 
the younger generation, I wonder if Ms. Taw knows anyone twice her age, besides 
perhaps her mother and father. One's point of view does change. Irony 
especially becomes therapeutic. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally (ironically, too), I have evidence that woman want vacuum 
cleaners to make that hideous noise, probably to annoy their husbands. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Stanley Howell of Yucaipa writes that when he was a young engineer his 
company actually made a quiet vacuum cleaner. "It was not only superior in 
vacuuming power, but it was virtually silent!" 
</P>
<P>
The company made 50 experimental units and sent them out to their distributors. 
</P>
<P>
"Within a month they were all back. The salesmen told us that they couldn't 
convince the ladies that the vacuums were really cleaning, because they didn't 
make enough noise. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave up the whole project and let (our competitors) have the market with 
their whining, buzzing and growling machines, which didn't clean as well but 
which the ladies would buy. It's a weird, weird world we live in." 
</P>
<P>
Ms. Taw complains that she reads my column only occasionally and finds that my 
"attitudes toward women are somewhat antiquated." 
</P>
<P>
I know this is going to get me into a lot more trouble, but many women I know 
and like best are well beyond their 20s. 
</P>
<P>
They work, they play, they do lunch, many have executive jobs, many work in 
charity, and some of them have sweet, affectionate, and considerate husbands 
who do not vacuum.

* Dear Family: Lawyer John Cicilline said Monday in a Boston court that the 
Mafia is in some ways comparable to the Elks Club. He was speaking on behalf of 
his client, reputed New England mob boss Raymond (Junior) Patriarca. 
</P>
<P>
Cicilline said a Mafia induction ceremony was similar to an Elks Club meeting. 
"We have men who gather together to discuss an organization, its rules, its 
philosophy," Cicilline said. But what about the oaths to kill defectors? 
Cicilline said such ideas are protected by constitutional guarantees to free 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
* Playing Favorites: Instead of Chicago patronage, politics and race, the 
issues were chocolate, strawberry and vanilla. New TV commercials for Edy's 
Grand Ice Cream are a spoof on Chicago's well-known Council Wars. "Order, 
please," commands the chamber speaker (an actor) in one ad as the real-life 
aldermen argue. "Yeah, order more vanilla," responds Roman Pucinski. Alderman 
Edward Burke prefers blueberry, Lawrence Bloom can't decide between chocolate 
and vanilla. "I love ice cream," said peach partisan and dieter Danny Davis. 
"But I have to be careful." 
</P>
<P>
* Order in the Court: The U.S. Supreme Court may be increasingly conservative, 
but at least one liberal isn't ready to retire. "I'm still enjoying myself," 
said Justice William J. Brennan. His 84th birthday is today. In March, doctors 
treated a bronchial infection with antibiotics. "I had a bad reaction, lost a 
lot of weight," but "I'm going to stay" on the bench, he said. That stay has 
lasted through 34 years and eight Presidents. 
</P>
<P>
* German Minimalism: West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl returned Monday from an 
Austrian spa where he lost 16 pounds from a diet of tea, milk and bouillon. His 
weight is now 235 pounds. Kohl said he felt a little "strained" as he joined a 
political meeting.

SIBERRY SINGS HER WAY BACK TO THE BASICS OF FOLK-POP MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back to basics is Jane Siberry's theme these days -- and that marks quite a 
turnabout for a Canadian singer who in the past has been among the most acutely 
artsy of pop performers. 
</P>
<P>
On her first three U.S. releases, Siberry was prone to challenge listeners with 
sprawling song-suites full of symbolic lyrics, abstract dialogue, and 
hard-to-figure shifts of perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Siberry, who plays tonight at the Bacchanal, has changed all that on her 
current album, "Bound by the Beauty." The music is direct, often rooted in 
folk-pop rather than art-pop. The songs hew more closely to conventional forms, 
and the lyrics hold fewer puzzles. 
</P>
<P>
Gone are the stacked layers of voices and the modernistic ambience generated by 
synthesizers and sampling keyboards. That approach used to prompt comparisons 
between Siberry's sound and the avant-garde explorations of Laurie Anderson, or 
the Baroque constructions of Kate Bush. The warm, piano-based arrangements on 
"Bound by the Beauty" are more apt to call Joni Mitchell to mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted (this album) to be straightforward," Siberry, 34, said over the phone 
from a tour stop in Austin last week. "I'm sure it was a balancing thing" after 
the complexity and lyrical impressionism of her 1988 album, "The Walking." 
</P>
<P>
"I felt the need to be straightforward and be perceived as (straightforward) ," 
said Siberry, whose conversation, like her singing, oscillated between moments 
of offhanded near-detachment and surges of intensity. "I feel very proud of 
'The Walking,' but I felt uncomfortable about the way I was being perceived. I 
guess (the perception) was that I was obscure, and I was too difficult. I don't 
feel like I am. The last thing I want to be is an elitist performer. I like to 
see myself as an every-person's writer." 
</P>
<P>
So Siberry retreated to a studio in the countryside west of her hometown of 
Toronto, in the unlikeliest of settings for a modern recording venture: a 
Quonset hut in the middle of an apple orchard. 
</P>
<P>
"This studio was perfect," Siberry said. "It was right in keeping with the 
spirit of the record -- very casual. Neighbors who never heard of me before 
would come and watch. It made it just everyday and matter of fact, instead of 
being in a big, corporate studio." 
</P>
<P>
The result was an album that features charming moments of whimsy, a few dark 
chills, and a moving, overriding sense of connection to the simplest, most 
basic thing we all share: the natural, reassuring presence of the earth itself. 
</P>
<P>
On the country-rock flavored "Something About Trains," Siberry is able to 
comfort herself during a melancholy moment with the realization that she is 
part of natural life: 
</P>
<P>
You walk the lonely valley 
</P>
<P>
 You walk the line alone 
</P>
<P>
 But this old earth is always there 
</P>
<P>
 You don't feel so alone. 
</P>
<P>
The album's title song is a rapturous love poem to the physical world, but it 
takes on an edge as Siberry contemplates the possibility that what delights her 
now could one day be ruined. Imagining herself returning to life 500 years 
hence, Siberry vows: "These things that I love . . . they'd better be here." 
</P>
<P>
Siberry almost bristled, though, at the suggestion that "Bound by the Beauty" 
might be seen as an album designed to stir ecological concern. To Siberry, the 
album looks intimately inward at her own response to nature, not outward to the 
politics of the environment. Clearly, she does not want to appear to be jumping 
on pop's quickly accelerating environmental bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
"Definitely not," she said of the notion that "Bound by the Beauty" can be 
taken as an ecological statement. "I don't even like to hear you say that." The 
album, she said, "is a reflection of somebody who has a great respect for 
natural beauty. The one thing that has kept me attuned to my love of life is 
natural beauty." If the songs relate to the concerns of the environmental 
movement, she said, it is only "as an aside." 
</P>
<P>
"It's because of the times today that you could see it as an ecological record, 
but that's a crude label. It's inaccurate," she said. "These songs could have 
been written 20 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Along with her appreciations of nature, Siberry sprinkled "Bound by the Beauty" 
with other intimate songs. There are warm reflections on romantic love (the 
pretty, affirmative hymn, "The Life is the Red Wagon," and the swooning 
Caribbean fling, "Are We Dancing Now?"), as well as whimsical tunes like 
"Hockey," with its childhood memories of frozen ponds, and "Everything Reminds 
Me of My Dog," which should find a spot in any canine lover's heart (in 
Siberry's case, everything reminds her of a part-husky named Wolfgang). 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with material that is more direct, Siberry has simplified her stage 
presentation. Gone are the backing singer-dancers and full band that she used 
in the past to reproduce, and sometimes play-act, her more elaborate songs. 
Instead, she is backed only by her long-time guitarist, Ken Myhr, and Teddy 
Borowiecki, who plays piano and accordion. 
</P>
<P>
"I just had such a strong gut feeling about working as a trio," Siberry said. 
"People get a sense of who I am. It's more intimate."

A Wonderful Life: Jimmy Stewart was honored yet again Monday night, and, with 
almost 82 years and more than 70 films behind him, he once again refused to 
admit he might deserve it. "I'm just such a lucky man!" the master of movie 
understatement said at a fund-raiser for the Film Society of Lincoln Center, 
where a sold-out crowd of usually hard-nosed, big-city Easterners paid homage 
to him. Testimonials came from George C. Scott, Dorothy Lamour, June Allyson, 
Janet Leigh, Kim Novak and Jack Lemmon. GREG BRAXTON

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : POP MUSIC;

<P>
SECOND ISSUE OF MAGAZINE GAINS RESPECT ON S.D. SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS K. ARNOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The second issue of San Diego Music Magazine hit the streets last week, and 
publisher-editor Steve Saint is more confident than ever that the free monthly 
publication -- something of a house organ for the San Diego pop-music community 
-- will be around for a long, long time. 
</P>
<P>
Ad sales are up considerably over last month, totaling 3 1/2 pages as opposed 
to less than two in the inaugural March issue, Saint said. And, perhaps more 
significant, he added, the magazine is rapidly catching on with its target 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
"I just came from a record store where one of your typically hip record-store 
workers had totally ignored the March issue," Saint said. "When I handed him 
the new issue, he said, 'Oh, yeah, I read the last one, and it was really good 
-- I know a lot of bands, and I'm going to tell them to send you stuff.' " 
</P>
<P>
"He was really nice to me, whereas before, he had been totally standoffish. I 
think people are starting to realize that we're going to be here every month, 
that the magazine is going to be some kind of a permanent fixture." 
</P>
<P>
For a city to maintain a vibrant original-music scene, Saint said, it's 
essential to have a magazine devoted to covering that scene -- through features 
on aspiring hometown heroes, reviews of local club shows and records, and 
updates on major-label signings of San Diego bands. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in San Francisco and Los Angeles and Chicago and New York, and 
everyone says there's a music scene in those cities, but there's no music scene 
in San Diego," Saint said. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is, there is a music scene in San Diego, but, until now, there hasn't 
been a magazine to focus attention on it -- as there is everywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our goal to change all that. We've got quite a scene down here, and we 
just want to put it down on black and white and get it out in front of 
everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Saint said his decision to launch a monthly music magazine resulted from his 
work with Musicians Who Care, a San Diego association of do-good musicians. 
</P>
<P>
"After working with Musicians Who Care for a year, I found that we were taking 
on more and more of an advocacy role for our bands," Saint said. "We went from 
trying to get musicians to help the community to trying to get musicians to 
help themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"So it just seemed to us that we were the natural people to do a magazine 
covering the local music scene. Besides, I'm a journalist by trade. I've been 
putting out newsletters since junior high school, and I've written for Music 
Connection, the Reader, even Time." 
</P>
<P>
Expansion plans for San Diego Music Magazine include increasing the number of 
pages from the current 12, upping the press run from 1,000 to 5,000 or more, 
and possibly changing the format from broad sheet to tabloid, Saint said. 
</P>
<P>
'We're going to keep this format for a while, because we started with it and we 
feel we should be consistent for a few months," Saint said. "We're using 
recycled paper, so no trees are being cut down to do this, and we want to make 
sure that if we do go to another format, we can maintain this type of standard. 
</P>
<P>
"So for now, the only changes we're looking at are to be bigger. We're shooting 
for a 16-page edition in May, and for the June issue, our big goal is to have 
an article on every aspect of the San Diego music scene by genre: who are the 
bands, who's in the studio, where are the clubs, what's getting played on 
radio, in regard to not just rock 'n' roll and new wave, but reggae, country, 
rap, and rhythm-and-blues. 
</P>
<P>
"And of course, that largely has to do with getting more advertiser support. We 
don't have a large infusion of capital; we are not a big-corporation publisher. 
We are musicians doing this for musicians, so it's kind of a family thing." 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: The third annual San Diego Folk Heritage benefit concert will be 
held Saturday night at the Del Mar Shores Auditorium. Once again, various board 
members and volunteers of the nonprofit organization, which since January of 
1988 has been producing local concerts by touring folk acts from around the 
world, will take to the stage themselves to raise money to help subsidize 
future productions. Among them: Jo Ann and Larry Sinclair, singing traditional 
and topical folk tunes; Ronni Russell and Jim Hayes, squaring off on the hammer 
dulcimer; and Dave Allen, Christopher Cunningham, and Barbara and Bruce Reid 
(he's the current board chairman), performing together as an old-time fiddle, 
banjo, and guitar combo . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tickets go on sale Saturday at 10 a.m. for Tracy Chapman's May 28 concert at 
San Diego State University's Open Air Theater, and April 30 at 10 a.m. for 
Elayne Boosler's May 25 appearance at the California Theater downtown . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Best concert bets for the coming week: Hot Tuna with Peter Kaukonen, Thursday 
at the Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa; Eric Burdon with Robby Krieger and the Walking 
Wounded, Thursday at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach; Garth Brooks with 
Holly Dunn, Friday at the Bacchanal; the Screamin' Sirens, Friday at the Casbah 
in Middletown; Curtis Mayfield with Sharkskin, Friday at the Belly Up; the 
Temptations with the Four Tops, Saturday at the Starlight Bowl in Balboa Park; 
Karla Bonoff, Saturday at the Bacchanal; Bonnie Bramlett, Sunday at the 
Bacchanal; Nils Lofgren, Sunday at the Belly Up; Keiko Matsui, Sunday at the 
Culbertson Winery in Temecula, and O.J. Ekemode, Tuesday at the Belly Up.

A PRECISE S.D. CHAMBER ORCHESTRA CLOSES ITS SEASON WITH CONVICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For its final concert of the season, the San Diego Chamber Orchestra acquitted 
itself honorably. Even if the orchestra performed in a secondary role for much 
of the evening -- three of the four pieces were concertos -- for the most part 
it sounded well-tuned, precise, and evenly balanced. 
</P>
<P>
In Aaron Copland's chamber version of "Appalachian Spring," which opened this 
Sherwood Auditorium program, the players, under music director Donald Barra, 
made the most of its tender, lyrical passages and managed to infuse the overly 
familiar work with conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Guitarist Angel Romero headed the roster of soloists for the evening. He played 
Manuel Ponce's rather dour "Concierto del Sur," and, with his teen-age son, 
Lito Romero, essayed Vivaldi's sprightly Concerto for Two Guitars in G Major. 
(Any classical guitarist who doesn't program one of those ubiquitous, 
saccharine Rodrigro guitar concertos has this reviewer's eternal gratitude.) 
</P>
<P>
In Ponce's rarely performed "Concierto del Sur," Angel Romero exhibited more 
earnest precision than rousing bravura, although the cadenzas sparked his 
characteristic verve. In spite of the soloist's emotional restraint and a lack 
of coordination with the orchestra in the sparse middle movement, this 
neoclassical concerto with a decidedly Latin flavor placed the chamber 
orchestra in a flattering light. 
</P>
<P>
The ample Sherwood audience showered its approval on the father and son team, 
even though Lito Romero's modest sound hardly matched his father's secure, 
resonant timbre. The elder Romero set a fleet pace, but Lito Romero kept up 
with well-disciplined rhythms and parallel phrasing. 
</P>
<P>
Originally written for a pair of mandolins, the slender Vivaldi concerto is of 
dubious merit. Its arid middle movement cries out for ornamentation or some 
creative improvisation in authentic Baroque style. As an encore after the 
Vivaldi, Lito Romero offered his thoughtful version of Celedonio Romero's 
"Fantasia." 
</P>
<P>
Barra brought his season to a stylish close with J. S. Bach's Second 
Brandenburg Concerto, featuring four principals from the orchestra in the solo 
group. Considering how well they performed, it would have been considerate to 
have listed them either in the program or on an insert. John Wilds negotiated 
the formidable trumpet solo with an elegant, pointed line. Except for his 
tendency to rush his phrase beginnings, it was an exemplary execution. In the 
middle movement, violinist Igor Gruppman, flutist Linda Lukas, and oboist Peggy 
Michel sympathetically blended their gracefully arched phrases.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHURCH'S LEADER DEFENDS SEX RITUALS AS 
RELIGIOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The self-proclaimed high priest of a church that professes to incorporate sex 
into its rituals told a federal judge Tuesday that his organization's doctrines 
are expressions of religious "dedication," not prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
In opening statements in a civil suit against the city of Los Angeles and its 
Police Department, Will Tracy said he established his church in Canyon Country 
after seeing visions in which he was visited by a 6-foot man with flowing white 
hair and a transparent white robe. 
</P>
<P>
"His eyes were extremely brilliant and flashing" and "he was also well-built," 
Tracy said of the April, 1984, vision. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy, 51, and his wife, Mary Ellen, 47, were convicted Sept. 8 of operating a 
house of prostitution and other related charges. They were sentenced to jail 
but their terms were put off pending appeal.

BILL BOYARSKY: A PARTING SHOT THAT RINGS TRUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I received a note from an unhappy reader: "I am obliged to write this letter 
because you haven't shown much inclination to return my calls." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, I'm bad about not returning my calls. It makes me feel bad. And I felt 
particularly bad about this complainant because he was a man who had been most 
helpful. His name is Robert S. Nielsen, and he retired last year as executive 
director of the California Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The commission is an important body that helps set transportation policy for 
the state, allocating money for freeway projects and the like. The 
commissioners also are the state officials who are supposed to be doing 
something about gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
I met Nielsen in a dark period, when I was bogged down in an endless task of 
trying to make sense of the fight between the Southern California Rapid Transit 
District and the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission. Somebody in 
Sacramento had told me he was the only person involved in California 
transportation policy who made any sense. He's a tall man who served as a 
combat navigator in the Royal Australian Air Force during World War II. He has 
a blunt way of talking, which made him a blessed exception to the bureaucratic 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
Turf warfare, Nielsen explained then. Selfishness. Stupidity. That's what's to 
blame for the Los Angeles County transportation mess. 
</P>
<P>
 I had interviewed many other people about this tangled issue, and none had 
been as forthright as that. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Nielsen told the story that he would have shared over the 
telephone with me -- if I had not lost the services of an assistant who always 
reminded me when to return calls. 
</P>
<P>
It was the story of a frustrated bureaucrat who wanted to exit with a bang. His 
bombshell came in the form of a thick report intended to shake the world -- if 
only someone would publish it. 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen had retired as executive director of the transportation commission last 
Oct. 31, Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
"My last major job was to produce a 250-page report on California's 
transportation future," he explained. "I presented this report to the 
commission on Oct. 19, but so far they have not released it." 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen had a theory about why his beautiful report had been cast into 
darkness. The theory stems from his disdain for state transportation officials. 
</P>
<P>
"They," he said, "have a tendency to shoot the messenger in Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen didn't send me all 250 pages of his report. He did, however, provide me 
with a summary, and it seemed to make sense. Since I still feel guilty about 
not returning phone calls from a trusted old source, I now offer (in highly 
condensed form) the first public viewing of Robert Nielsen's final assessment: 
</P>
<P>
1. Gov. George Deukmejian is supposed to be "the ultimate leader for 
transportation" in the state, but he has never paid enough attention. 
</P>
<P>
2. The Legislature has been afraid to ask tough questions and make strong 
suggestions. "This esteemed body must accept its share of blame for lack of 
effective leadership," he wrote. I could almost hear the sarcasm dripping over 
the word "esteemed." 
</P>
<P>
3. The state Transportation Commission had "opportunities to provide 
leadership, but failed. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
4. Private enterprise has met with only limited success in its efforts "to 
stimulate the political leaders . . . into some form of action." 
</P>
<P>
5. "Regional agencies and local governments," he stated, "have shown the most 
aggressive leadership in recent years." 
</P>
<P>
While Nielsen's canons may sound banal for anyone reading them in stalled 
traffic on the Hollywood Freeway, they clarify the main obstacle to a decent 
transportation system: Leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen's criticisms are also timely. They come at the beginning of the 
campaign for two measures on the June ballot aimed at raising $18.5 billion for 
highway construction and transit. 
</P>
<P>
The money's needed, Nielsen said. But the voters should ask for some 
guarantees. For example, they should demand to know specifically what the 
candidates for governor propose to do with all the money -- more details than 
are available in a television commercial. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless the governor does provide leadership," he concluded, "any sustained 
effort to improve transportation is unlikely to succeed." 
</P>
<P>
That sounds like pretty good advice to me. But the report still hasn't been 
printed. I contacted Bob Remen, Nielsen's successor. He said the staff is 
putting some final touches on Nielsen's work, and it will be presented to the 
commission soon. 
</P>
<P>
I can understand the delay. When people retire, they're supposed to mumble 
thanks for the fishing gear and pension, and then disappear. They're not 
supposed to blast their benefactors. 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen went out another way, leveling an unvarnished assessment of the state's 
troubled transportation systems. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe I ought to give the man a call.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EXTRA $18.2 MILLION FOR CENTRAL LIBRARY 
URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council's Arts Committee on Tuesday approved spending an 
additional $18.2 million on the 64-year-old downtown Central Library, bringing 
the city's bill to restore the fire-damaged landmark to $56.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
The City Administrative Office said additional money is needed to correct 
damage caused by fires and earthquakes, to remove asbestos and to plug a 
methane gas leak. The 1926 building has been closed since two arson fires in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
The cost overrun proposal is expected to come before the City Council next 
week, where, observers expect it will face strong resistance.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Malathion spray zones in Downey, Pomona and Upland will be expanded by 42 
square miles to fight new Mediterranean fruit fly outbreaks, widening Southern 
California's aerial pesticide campaign to about 480 square miles, state 
agriculture officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The expanded sectors will be sprayed two times, followed by the release of 
sterile Medflies. Seven Medflies were found last week, most just outside 
existing spray zones. An unmated, female Medfly was found Monday in Artesia, 
which is in the Downey expansion zone. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement by state Department of Food and Agriculture Director Henry J. 
Voss follows the recommendations of the state's scientific advisory panel. No 
decision has been made on treatment for an infestation in San Bernardino.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TEACHER'S UNION CENSURES COMPTON SCHOOL 
BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state's largest teachers union has censured the Compton school board and 
called on state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig to appoint a commission 
to investigate working conditions in the district, where teachers have worked 
this year without a contract. 
</P>
<P>
According to the recent California Teachers Assn. resolution, Compton's refusal 
to bargain in good faith is causing teacher salaries to fall far below those in 
neighboring districts. More than 150 teachers -- about 13% of the teaching 
staff -- left last year. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in at least 15 years that the CTA has censured a 
district, a spokeswoman said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN ARRESTED AFTER 30-MINUTE CAR CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman who led police on a 30-minute pursuit through the Mid-Wilshire District 
with her 10-month-old daughter in the front seat of her car was arrested for 
child endangerment after she was caught, police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
According to Lt. Ben Gering of the Metropolitan Division, the chase started at 
11 p.m. Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Officers in an unmarked car saw what they believed was a drug deal in progress 
involving a woman in a Volkswagen bug that was double-parked on 9th Street west 
of Mariposa Avenue. A patrol car tried to stop the woman a short distance away, 
but she eluded police until she drove into a construction area at Normandie 
Avenue and Beverly Boulevard, Gering said. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Robinson, 31, was booked at the Sybil Brand Institute for Women on 
suspicion of child endangering, Gering said. The 10-month-old girl was unhurt 
and released to her father's custody.

SUPERVISORS OK PLAN TO DOUBLE COUNTY JAIL CAPACITY OVER 20 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A multibillion-dollar plan that calls for nearly doubling Los Angeles County's 
jail capacity to 43,230 beds over the next 20 years was approved Tuesday by the 
Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was opposed by Asian and Latino residents who objected that it does 
nothing to relieve an overconcentration of detention facilities in their 
downtown and East Los Angeles neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The 395-page document proposes 12 new jails at unspecified sites throughout the 
county, but it is simply a "planning document," required by the state, 
supervisors pointed out. Any new jails beyond those already approved, they 
said, face considerable financial and political obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors had to approve the plan to qualify for $161 million in state bond 
funds to increase the capacity of the downtown Men's Central Jail to 9,000 from 
its present 6,800 inmates. The bonds would also be used to build a 1,000-bed 
jail in Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
The plan brought out opponents of the Central Jail expansion for another try to 
kill the project, approved by the supervisors in August. The city of Los 
Angeles also has filed suit to block the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Lowe, representing the Latino and Asian Coalition to Improve Our 
Neighborhoods (L.A. Action) told supervisors that the neighborhoods from 
Chinatown to East Los Angeles are already overloaded with existing and proposed 
jail facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Undersheriff Robert Edmonds, referring to city opposition to the jail 
expansion, responded, "We're still waiting for the city of Los Angeles to offer 
us a suitable site somewhere else in the city, because they are our biggest 
customer." 
</P>
<P>
Edmonds added, "We don't disagree with the need for more decentralization . . . 
but we need to proceed with expansion of the Central Jail to relieve problems 
facing us there." 
</P>
<P>
Some 250,000 minor offenders have been released early from the 11 county 
detention facilities since June, 1988, because of a court order limiting the 
jail capacity countywide to 22,000 prisoners, Edmonds told supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, prisoners at the Central Jail have been forced to sleep in 
hallways and in the jail chapel. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Jail expansion calls for building a two-story "inmate reception 
center" flanked by two concrete towers -- seven and eight stories -- on what is 
now a parking lot across from the existing jail on Bauchet Street. A five-story 
tower at the rear of the complex will house a jail hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The plan approved Tuesday projects a need for 43,932 jail beds countywide by 
the year 2010, costing more than $3.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The county now houses 22,000 prisoners at jails licensed for about 15,592. 
</P>
<P>
"The jail plan provides a decentralized approach to siting future detention 
facilities based on projected county population distribution and projected 
arrests by region," says the report, prepared by private consultants at a cost 
of $274,000, 
</P>
<P>
The plan was approved by the board on a 3-1 vote, with Supervisor Ed Edelman, 
in whose district the Central Jail is located, dissenting. Supervisor Pete 
Schabarum was absent. 
</P>
<P>
County Chief Administrative Officer Richard B. Dixon has recommended that 
supervisors place a half-cent sales-tax increase in Los Angeles County on the 
November ballot to raise $400 million a year for jail operations. No decision 
has been made on that request.

APARTMENT SEIZED BY FBI AS ALLEGED SITE OF RAMPANT DRUG SALES; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: THE ACTION REPORTEDLY IS THE FIRST SUCH CONFISCATION IN THE 
CITY. OFFICIALS SAY THE BUILDING OWNER TOOK PART IN NARCOTICS DEALS.

<P>
FBI agents Tuesday seized ownership of a nine-unit apartment complex in 
Westchester that authorities said had been the site of rampant drug sales. 
</P>
<P>
The move marked the first time that federal drug laws had been used to 
confiscate an apartment building in Los Angeles, according to City Atty. James 
K. Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said authorities believe that the owner, John Eckert, 32, "knew about, 
condoned and participated in" the sale of cocaine by some tenants in the 
run-down apartment building at 5400 W. 99th Place. 
</P>
<P>
Since last July, Hahn said, Los Angeles police have made 19 arrests at the site 
on a variety of drug-related charges. "There is evidence that the owner was 
accepting cocaine as payment for the rent," Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
The apartment building was seized under a federal law that allows the 
confiscation of property belonging to those who encourage or facilitate the 
sale of drugs. The FBI and Los Angeles police cooperated in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Eckert was arrested March 27 on charges of being under the influence of cocaine 
-- a misdemeanor -- after police raided his apartment and another unit and 
confiscated 8.1 grams of rock cocaine. Two other tenants were later arrested 
for buying cocaine at the site. 
</P>
<P>
When Eckert failed to appear for his arraignment on the charges last week in 
Los Angeles Municipal Court, a warrant was issued for his arrest, Hahn said. On 
Tuesday, Eckert was arrested on the warrant and was being held in jail in lieu 
of $8,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors on the residential street just a mile northeast of Los Angeles 
International Airport expressed relief that the government had seized the 
property. They said car thefts and shootings had become routine as drug dealers 
and users descended on the apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
"Just like the planes go by every day, you could count on hearing the gunshots 
once or twice a week," said Diane Gayles, who lives across the street from the 
building. "If (the landlords) don't want their property in trouble, they 
shouldn't do these things." 
</P>
<P>
One 22-year-old tenant of the building said a man had assaulted her and stolen 
her purse last week as she entered her first-floor apartment. The woman, who 
asked that her name not be published, said she hoped calm would return to the 
street. "I'm glad," she said. "It's a relief." 
</P>
<P>
After police raided the apartment building and seized the cocaine, the city 
went to federal court, where a magistrate authorized the seizure of the 
building on April 17. 
</P>
<P>
With the seizure, the building becomes the property of the U.S. government. 
Hahn said Eckert may choose to contest the seizure in court. In the meantime, 
federal marshals will operate the building and collect rent until a property 
manager is found to run the building, Hahn explained. 
</P>
<P>
For now, tenants will be allowed to remain in the building but should they 
engage in the use or sale of drugs, they can be prosecuted and evicted. 
</P>
<P>
Acting Assistant U.S. Atty. William Cullen, who filed the action to seize the 
building, said some of the residents were confused by the change in ownership. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we told them, 'The building has just been taken over by the federal 
government. Please don't make your rent payment to Mr. Eckert. Make your checks 
payable to the U.S. marshals,' " Cullen said. 
</P>
<P>
The two-story building eventually will be sold, Hahn said, with the proceeds 
divided among Los Angeles police and the FBI, with the LAPD getting about 90% 
of the money. In the last year, $7 million has been channeled to the LAPD from 
similar property seizures. 
</P>
<P>
Federal forfeiture laws have been used to confiscate automobiles, boats and 
airplanes belonging to those arrested on drug-related charges since 1984. The 
laws have also been used to confiscate apartment buildings in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said authorities in Los Angeles had not seized apartment buildings before 
Tuesday's action because of the difficulty in proving the landlords' link to 
drug-related criminal activity.

FREEWAY WORKERS' GRIEF, FEAR DELAY RETURN TO JOB

<TEXT>
<P>
Dennis Sterndahl won't soon forget that slight bend of freeway where it 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
As a road crew from Sterndahl's highway striping company worked along the 
southbound San Diego Freeway late one night last week, a van came slicing out 
of the darkness at 80 m.p.h. Without warning, it plowed into Kevin Smith, 
crushing the 26-year-old highway worker against a flatbed maintenance truck. 
</P>
<P>
The death has sent a shiver through Smith's colleagues at Sterndahl 
Enterprises, a small San Fernando firm that had never before had a worker 
killed on the job. Almost a week since the April 19 accident, the normally 
steely nerved highway workers remain uneasy about taking up where they left 
off. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, completion of a long-awaited car-pool lane through South Orange 
County is expected to be delayed until at least the middle of next week as 
California Department of Transportation officials and a contractor decide 
whether to dispatch another firm to complete the work or wait as the Sterndahl 
crew musters the fortitude to return. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a very small company, and everyone is shook up about the prospect of 
going back out there," said Bill Decker, a Caltrans engineer on the project. 
"We have maybe three or four good days of work left. . . . We thought they'd be 
right back out, but I guess they're going to have to take some time to 
regroup." 
</P>
<P>
Sterndahl, for one, says he isn't about to force anyone back out to the site of 
the tragedy at the Irvine Center Drive exit. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to say it's jinxed. It's just not going to be easy for anyone," 
Sterndahl said Tuesday. "It's going to be the toughest nights this company ever 
has gone through to go out and finish that job." 
</P>
<P>
It is a case of where the hassle of deadlines and push to get a construction 
job done may take a back seat for just a bit. The grieving isn't over, not just 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Smith's work-mates erected a sign at the accident site as a 
roadside marker to remind motorists of the tragedy, in which the driver of the 
van was also killed. Caltrans officials later said the sign had to be removed 
because it was placed illegally. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Smith's friends and family held a memorial service. And on Tuesday, 
the Sterndahl crew went back out into the field for the first time since the 
accident, opening a new set of ramps on the San Bernardino Freeway in 
Montclair. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys were jumpier than hell," Sterndahl said. "Sure enough, we had some 
cars drive right through the cones into the enclosure where they were working." 
</P>
<P>
No one was hurt -- and it was a first step back. But for some of the highway 
workers, the thought of returning to work in the midnight gloom on the stretch 
of highway where Smith was cut down remains an ominous barrier. So far, no one 
is pushing them. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone understands what a tragedy this was," Sterndahl said, noting how the 
firm has received messages of condolence from dozens of other highway 
construction companies throughout the state. "No one, not Caltrans or anyone 
else, is putting pressure on us to perform at this time. Everyone is just 
trying to get over the shock of it." 
</P>
<P>
Some are eager to get beyond the tragedy. Troy Hill, a co-worker of Smith, said 
he wants to get back out to the stretch of freeway and just get the job done. 
Hill expects the crew to be back out by next Tuesday night to finish up. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be hard, but there is a job to be done," said Hill, 29, the 
brother-in-law of the young woman Smith was to marry in November. "Still, I'm 
very nervous about the idea of going back out there at night. There's just been 
too many close calls on this project. Sometimes it feels like it's us against 
everyone on the road." 
</P>
<P>
Just two weeks ago, Hill had a near-miss of his own. He was bent over along the 
road pulling up some tape after a fresh strip of paint had been laid down. A 
car whizzed by just inches from his head, close enough to hit the bill of his 
baseball cap and send it twirling down the highway, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
It was one of many close calls. Less than two hours before Smith's death, a 
white four-wheel-drive Bronco deliberately pulled inside the orange highway 
cones and swerved at the men, Sterndahl said. Some of the crew roared after the 
Bronco to try to get the license number but never caught up. 
</P>
<P>
"The sad thing is we get so little respect for providing a service," Sterndahl 
said. "People don't look at the long-term gain of having a better road to drive 
on. They look at the short-term inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
"When the majority of the motoring public sees us out there, they're upset. 
We're in their way." 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans has increasingly taken pains to ensure that highway projects don't 
infringe too heavily on the motoring public, Sterndahl said. But all too often 
that puts highway work crews alongside cars hurtling past like airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's people like Kevin Smith out there doing their job to the best of their 
ability who are caught in the middle," Sterndahl said. "It's a hazardous 
occupation. No doubt. And it certainly makes you think. It makes you wonder if 
that's what you ought to be doing."

SAN DIEGO FREEWAY CAR-POOL LANE DRAWS RECORD NUMBER OF DRIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While work on 10 miles of southbound car-pool lane on the San Diego Freeway is 
not expected to be completed until next week, the northbound commuter lane has 
gotten off to a fast start, California Department of Transportation officials 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
After less than a week of operation, the northbound lane has attracted more 
cars during the peak morning commute hour than any new commuter lane in Orange 
County, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The new 10-mile stretch of car-pool lanes, which extend from the Santa Ana 
Freeway to the Corona del Mar Freeway, links to a 14-mile segment completed 
last summer between the Corona del Mar and San Gabriel River freeways to form 
the longest continuous commuter system in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Between 6:45 a.m. and 7:45 a.m., the lane drew more than 800 cars, about 200 
more than were lured to the car-pool lanes on the Costa Mesa Freeway during its 
initial days of operation, said Joe El-Harake, Orange County commuter lanes 
coordinator for Caltrans. The new lane drew about 250 more cars than were 
attracted to the 14-mile segment on the San Diego Freeway when it opened last 
September, he said. ERIC BAILEY

STATE MAY CHALLENGE PIERSIDE SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Deputy Atty. Gen. Robert G. Collins said an agreement Tuesday ending a 
four-year legal battle over land on which the city hopes to build its Pierside 
Village project does not clarify title to the site. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our view that the city still does not have clear title" to the land, 
Collins said. He spoke outside court shortly after Orange County Superior Court 
Judge Robert Todd accepted an agreement between the city and the state that 
ended the city's four-year lawsuit involving Pierside Village land. 
</P>
<P>
The city's suit sought to obtain ownership to three acres of beach-bluff land 
at Pacific Coast Highway and Main Street. The city hopes to use the property 
for a "restaurant row" development called Pierside Village. 
</P>
<P>
The city's legal action succeeded in getting the three joint owners of the land 
-- Chevron USA, the Huntington Beach Co. and Southern Pacific Transportation 
Co. -- to donate their interest in the property to the city. In addition, the 
state agreed to stipulate in the case that no state-owned tidelands are 
involved in the land being sought by the city. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Robert Sangster said that the city's lawsuit thus cleared 
ownership title to the land and that the entire package of land now belongs to 
the city. Sangster said the beach-bluff acreage, which is immediately south of 
the pier, can now be considered city-owned property, able to be leased to 
commercial restaurants in the proposed Pierside Village project. 
</P>
<P>
But Collins on Tuesday said he strongly disagrees that the city has gained 
title to the land. He said he believes that the Southern Pacific Transportation 
Co.'s land donation to the city is legally faulty because it incorrectly 
defined the land boundaries and because it incorrectly claimed that no public 
easement exists on the land. Collins noted that the property has had a public 
easement, or right of way, on it since 1932. 
</P>
<P>
"The title to the land is more confused now than before," Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
The city must get state Coastal Commission approval for the project before 
construction can begin. BILL BILLITER

OWNERS OF ESCORT SERVICE ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The owners of an escort service that employed at least 60 women were arrested 
on suspicion of pimping after a two-month investigation, authorities said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation began after an employee of Queen's Escort Service in 
Huntington Beach attempted to prostitute herself to vice officers who had 
responded to the company's ad in a local newspaper, Police Lt. Ed McErlain 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers then served search warrants on co-owners Carolyn Sue Queen, 43, of 
Riverside and Roger Earl Crayton, 43, of Lake Elsinore and found evidence 
implicating them in prostitution operations in several Orange County cities, 
McErlain said. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the seized evidence was a list of 100 male clients, McErlain said. 
Police have declined to release the names of the suspected clients and 
prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
Queen was arrested by police last Wednesday and Crayton turned himself in 
Monday, McErlain said. They were released on their own recognizance from 
Huntington Beach Jail, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Queen and Crayton are expected to be arraigned Friday on 24 felony counts of 
conspiracy and pimping, McErlain said.

PLEA BARGAIN ENDS MAN'S MURDER TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Santa Ana man on trial for murder in the shooting death of his brother has 
pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter instead. 
</P>
<P>
Tomas Bustos Valadez, 33, agreed to the plea Monday after Superior Court Judge 
Leonard H. McBride indicated in chambers that he would probably give Valadez a 
three-year sentence in exchange for the guilty plea. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Jennifer Keller said she is convinced, especially after 
talking to jurors who heard the prosecution's case, that her client probably 
would have been convicted of no more than involuntary manslaughter. The 
sentence for that is two to six years. "It was a difficult decision. I don't 
feel good about having a client plead guilty to something I know he didn't do," 
Keller said. "But this was probably best for him." 
</P>
<P>
Voluntary manslaughter, under California law, means that a defendant 
deliberately killed someone, but the shooting was not premeditated and did not 
include malice. Involuntary manslaughter indicates a reckless act that was 
unintentional. 
</P>
<P>
Valadez has admitted the fatal shooting of his brother, Joaquin Valadez, 28, at 
their Santa Ana home on New Year's Eve, 1988. But his defense was that the gun 
went off by accident after Joaquin rushed at him. Witnesses said Joaquin 
Valadez had been drinking and already attacked another brother before he was 
shot. Keller said her client picked up a rifle in an attempt to calm Joaquin. 
</P>
<P>
Though Valadez pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter, Keller said she 
attached a legal statement to the guilty plea that Valadez does not admit to 
the crime. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert C. Gannon Jr. declined to comment on why he agreed 
during the trial to the plea bargain. "Sometimes that's just how these things 
work out," Gannon said. 
</P>
<P>
The judge will formally sentence Valadez, who has been in custody since the 
shooting, on May 18. JERRY HICKS

EU ASKS STUDENTS TO HELP REGISTER VOTERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
California Secretary of State March Fong Eu visited Greenville Fundamental 
School on Monday and urged 150 fourth-graders to join her in an effort to 
register voters in time for the June 5 primary elections. 
</P>
<P>
"You're too young to vote, but you can help me by asking your parents and other 
adult relatives if they're registered to vote," Eu said to the group. 
</P>
<P>
She then asked the students to memorize the toll-free telephone number that 
people can call to get a voter registration form sent to them. The number, 
1-800-345-VOTE, proved easy enough to remember for the students, many of whom 
returned to their classrooms whispering the number. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important to get them thinking about the democratic process early 
in life," Eu said after her speech. "You would be amazed how much influence 
little kids can have on adults." 
</P>
<P>
Greenville is one of two open-enrollment elementary schools in Santa Ana with a 
"back-to-basics" philosophy that emphasizes reading, writing and mathematics, 
as well as parent participation. Principal Susan Johns said the school also 
promotes patriotism, holding 10 patriotic assemblies a year. She said Eu's 
visit was the highlight of the fourth-grader's study of California. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope our children will really think about what was said for their own 
futures, and we hope they'll talk to their parents and older siblings," Johns 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Tora Avalos, whose son Omar is a fifth-grader at the school, said she is 
pleased to see the students getting a civics lesson from an elected official. 
</P>
<P>
"It's never too soon for them to be made aware of what's going on," Avalos 
said. "It's important even at their young age. I think having someone like the 
secretary of state here was a real honor for them." 
</P>
<P>
Eu's visit to the school was part of a one-week voter registration campaign 
that is taking her throughout the state. Besides visiting Greenville, Eu also 
addressed students at Orange Coast College, Golden West College and Rancho 
Santiago College on Monday. GREG HERNANDEZ

CHENEY PAYS BRIEF VISIT TO EL TORO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, stopping Tuesday at the El Toro Marine Corps 
Air Station on a tour of the state's military bases, restated his intent to 
close down several facilities nationwide as part of defense budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
However, Cheney provided no specific details about the future of the El Toro 
jet fighter base, the Tustin Marine Corps Helicopter Air Station on Red Hill 
Avenue, Camp Pendleton in San Diego County or any other military base. 
</P>
<P>
During his 30-minute visit, Cheney sat in the cockpits of two fighter planes 
parked on the apron at the air station and was greeted by Maj. Gen. Royal 
Moore, commander of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief press conference after the plane inspections, Cheney said he was 
visiting military sites "in the midst of our ongoing budget debates . . . to 
understand as much as possible what our capabilities are and what our problems 
are." 
</P>
<P>
Both Cheney and Assistant Defense Secretary Peter Williams declined to comment 
on the future of Orange County's bases, except to say that the El Toro base is 
not on the current list of closures. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine city officials have spoken of consolidating operations at El Toro with 
Camp Pendleton in north San Diego County. Although city officials have kept a 
close eye on that possibility, they were not notified of Cheney's visit and did 
not have plans to meet with him, said City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll certainly talk to local officials and hear their arguments," Williams 
said. "Nothing is immune from scrutiny these days." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney visited Navy operations earlier Tuesday morning in Coronado and was 
scheduled to tour a Lockheed plant in Burbank and McDonnell Douglas facilities 
in Long Beach after leaving El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, a former House Republican whip, also took time to criticize a 
$24-million budget cut proposed by Congress for 1991, in addition to the cuts 
it has already asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be unwise if that happens," Cheney said. "The only place we 
could take cuts would be in personnel. I think it would do a lot of damage in 
California and everywhere." WENDY PAULSON

MISTRIAL IN DRUG CASE OF EX-TIMES WORKER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court trial in Santa Ana ended in mistrial when jurors voted 11 to 1 
Tuesday to acquit a former Los Angeles Times employee on a charge of dealing 
cocaine at the company's Orange County facility. 
</P>
<P>
Shawn Daugherty, 34, of Riverside is the third to go to trial of 20 employees 
arrested at the Costa Mesa plant on Jan. 31, 1989, in an Orange County 
Sheriff's Department undercover operation conducted in cooperation with The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
The trial of Carlito Carles, 33, also ended in mistrial with a 10-2 jury vote 
for acquittal. He later pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge, defense 
attorney Milton C. Grimes said. The other, Artis Grigsby, 45, was acquitted, 
Grimes said. 
</P>
<P>
Two others -- Rudolph Maduena, 48, and Paul Hendricks, 35 -- have pleaded 
guilty to felony drug charges, Grimes said. All of the employees were fired by 
The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Ronald E. Owen, who declared the mistrial Tuesday in the 
Daugherty case, set a May 11 date for prosecutors to determine whether he will 
be retried. Grimes argued to jurors that Daugherty had been the victim of 
entrapment by a Times employee, who was cooperating with the authorities in the 
undercover operation. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy asked my client six to seven times to get cocaine for him, and 
finally he agreed," Grimes said. "But it was clearly a case of entrapment, and 
no jury is ever going to see it any other way." 
</P>
<P>
Grimes represents seven others of the 20. Those cases are still pending. JERRY 
HICKS

$265,000 OKD FOR 'DRUG BABY' PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Supervisors on Tuesday approved without comment $265,060 in federal funding for 
Orange County's first comprehensive program to treat and study children born to 
mothers who abused drugs during pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
The program, in operation a little more than a year at UCI Medical Center in 
Orange, has been monitoring the health and behavior of 60 drug-exposed 
children, offering them checkups and teaching their mothers or foster parents 
how to care for them. 
</P>
<P>
Around the nation, estimates of so-called "drug babies" vary widely, with 
different studies reporting from 13,000 to 375,000 such children born last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County last year, hospital directors and nursing managers estimated 
that 1,248 Orange County children were exposed to marijuana, heroin, 
amphetamines and other illicit drugs at birth, but many health experts believe 
the problem here is greater. 
</P>
<P>
A memo from the County Health Care Agency to supervisors described the problem 
here as alarming. For instance, 20% of all protective custody cases involve 
infants exposed to drugs or parents involved with drugs, it said, and county 
juvenile detention memos from January, 1988, to May, 1989, showed that 270 
newborns tested positive for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Len Foster, the County Health Care Agency's division manager for adult and 
child health services, called the UCI project a start at tackling an important 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
The federal grant allocated by the supervisors covers UCI's care to 
drug-exposed children from March to September of this year. Cheryl Milford, 
developmental psychologist at UCI and a founder of the project, and the 
project's pediatrician, Lynn Hunt, said they plan to expand their program to 
monitor and treat 400 drug-exposed children to age 5.LANIE JONES

WATER DISTRICT BOARD BACKS CITYHOOD ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proponents of cityhood for the El Toro area got a major boost this week from 
the Irvine Ranch Water District. 
</P>
<P>
The district's board of directors voted unanimously Monday night to sponsor the 
Community Coalition for Incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
That sponsorship allows the coalition to apply for incorporation to the Local 
Agency Formation Commission without submitting residents' signatures. 
</P>
<P>
But Helen Wilson, chairwoman of the coalition, said her group will also present 
petitions to LAFCO today containing 7,500 signatures supporting cityhood. Until 
the group found a sponsor, it needed the verified signatures of at least 7,000 
people, 25% of the 28,000 registered voters who live in the area proposed for 
incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said her group will continue to gather signatures "to show we have 
community support." She said the group approached the water district to 
guarantee placement on the November ballot, rather than risk a late filing of 
an application with LAFCO and the possibility of being forced to hold a special 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Peer Swan, board president for the water district, said sponsoring the effort 
is "just good government. It saves everybody money and allows the people to 
vote on the proposal in a general election. A special election is costly, and 
only very few voters generally turn out." 
</P>
<P>
The water district serves the Portola Hills area of El Toro. LEN HALL

ANAHEIM MAN SLAIN EXECUTION-STYLE IN GEORGIA RESTAURANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Anaheim accountant was killed execution-style as he sat in the bar of a 
crowded Savannah, Ga., restaurant, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Berry Bragg, 52, died after being shot once at close range by an 
unidentified assailant, Savannah Police Officer Joseph Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
The bullet entered behind Bragg's ear, he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, the gunman walked into Bennigan's restaurant, approached 
Bragg from behind and fired a small-caliber pistol at his head. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman then ran out of the restaurant, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
Police have identified no motive or suspects. Investigators, however, are 
looking into the possibility that the shooting was by a professional killer. 
</P>
<P>
A Bennigan's spokesman declined comment, but police said restaurant employees 
told them Bragg was a regular customer. Hill said Bragg was a native of 
Savannah. 
</P>
<P>
"He apparently commuted between here and California frequently," Hill said.

MIKE PENNER: VERDICT IS IN ON GLANVILLE'S REBUILDING JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Penner 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The changes have begun at the top, with the helmet, which is now colored 
Alcatraz Black, a stylish replacement for the old No. 1 Draft Pick Red. 
</P>
<P>
But that's just setting the tone. More changes, sweeping changes, are already 
under way. 
</P>
<P>
New team name: The Atlanta Falcons and the Snowman. 
</P>
<P>
New stadium name: The Big House of Pain. 
</P>
<P>
New fight song: Back On The Chain Gang. 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't taken long for new Falcon Coach Jerry Glanville to fashion a team in 
his own image. Scorned as NFL Public Enemy No. 1 during his years in Houston, 
Glanville has spent his first few months in Atlanta trying to surround himself 
with Nos. 2 through 10. 
</P>
<P>
With his first Falcon draft choice, Glanville selected Washington State running 
back Steve Broussard, noted for his explosiveness in the open field and in a 
crowded bar. "We know we didn't draft a choir boy," gushed Ken Herock, Atlanta 
vice president of player personnel. "He's had some problems controlling his 
temper in the past. He's a kid who, when he's challenged, is going to come back 
at you." 
</P>
<P>
With his second choice, Glanville picked Jackson State linebacker Darion 
Conner, whom the coach described, admiringly, as "a borderline trained killer." 
</P>
<P>
With his sixth choice, Glanville tabbed Mike Pringle. Pringle, the 
record-setting Cal State Fullerton tailback, has had the worst week of public 
relations since Joseph Hazelwood tried to parallel park the Exxon Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
Seven days ago, Pringle was just another young running back with promise. 
</P>
<P>
Now he has a past. 
</P>
<P>
And his police record seems to grow by the day. The arrest count is now up to 
four, including an April 11 incident that resulted in a misdemeanor battery 
charge and carried with it an interesting footnote. Broussard, a former running 
mate of Pringle's when both played at Washington State, also was at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently in an advisory capacity. 
</P>
<P>
"In this case, he has independent witnesses who say he was provoked," Herock 
says of Broussard. "Basically, we feel he'll be cleared of any wrong-doing." 
</P>
<P>
Basically, Pringle feels the same way about himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the charges will be dropped," he said the other day. "If the system 
works, there shouldn't be any problem. As a criminal justice major, I believe I 
know what I'm talking about." 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, Pringle's next term paper will be well-researched. 
</P>
<P>
Broussard and Pringle must have been holy terrors in the same Washington State 
backfield. Just wait until they team up again in Atlanta. Mr. Inside and Mr. 
Let's Step Outside. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, Glanville says he doesn't approve of such behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking into the (Pringle) matter," he says. "We don't want this kind of 
thing going on with our people. If they're going to be part of our family, 
they're going to play by our rules." 
</P>
<P>
It is good to know that Glanville considers his team a family. So did Don 
Corleone. Glanville's also includes a second-year linebacker named Aundray 
Bruce, who was arrested in March for allegedly pointing a weapon at a pizza 
deliveryman. That's not the prescribed penalty for failing to deliver a large 
pepperoni in 30 minutes or less. 
</P>
<P>
If Glanville wanted the outlaw image, he's got it. His employers, though, want 
a good football team. 
</P>
<P>
There's a chance Glanville may have that too. 
</P>
<P>
The Jeff George trade was, for lack of a better word, a steal. In exchange for 
their first of two first-round draft choices, the Falcons added a Pro Bowl 
blocker (Chris Hinton) and an all-rookie wide receiver (Andre Rison). They 
still have Chris Miller at quarterback, which isn't a bad alternative to 
George, and now Miller has two of the best young targets in the league in Rison 
and Shawn Collins. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta's defense remains long on potential, with a nucleus of Bruce, Deion 
Sanders and Tony Casillas, and the Falcons' biggest deficiency -- a running 
game -- could be corrected by Broussard and Pringle. 
</P>
<P>
The NFC West already housed the best two teams in the league, along with a 10-6 
New Orleans club that barely missed last year's playoffs. If Atlanta arises, 
winning the division could be a tougher haul than winning the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
For the Rams, their challenge has just multiplied. Instead of simply chasing 
the 49ers, the Rams must now also look out below. Fending off the Falcons soon 
may become a full-time job. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, the warning has been issued. Look out for the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
And, at the same time, be on the lookout for them.

OCEAN VIEW STAFF PITCHES IN TO SHARE WORK LOAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every Wednesday morning Ocean View High School baseball Coach Steve Barrett 
scans the box scores in the local newspaper, looking for one statistic in 
particular. 
</P>
<P>
 Innings pitched. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrett hasn't always paid close attention to opponents' pitching statistics. 
But starting this season, Barrett and other coaches consider innings pitched 
one of the most important stats beside the final score. 
</P>
<P>
Under a state rule, pitchers are limited to three appearances and 30 outs a 
week. Violation of the rule constitutes a forfeit. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big deal among coaches and umpires," Barrett said. "All the coaches 
watch the box scores in the paper now. I want to know who threw on Tuesday, so 
I know if that pitcher has only three innings of eligibility left when he 
pitches against us." 
</P>
<P>
Barrett rarely worries about his pitchers' eligibility. The Hawks, 16-5 and 
ranked third in the Orange County writers' poll, have four experienced 
pitchers: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jim Gwaltney, a senior left-hander, is 6-1 with a 2.00 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Senior Duane Page, the only right-hander on the staff, is 7-1 with 35 
strikeouts and a 1.50 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Randy Karliner, a junior left-hander, is 3-0 with one save and 15 
strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Eric Schaff, a senior left-hander, is 0-2 but has a 2.00 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Few schools can match Ocean View's pitching depth, which Barrett said will give 
the Hawks an advantage in the playoffs, where teams play as many as three games 
in a week. "Pitching, pitching and more pitching will be our strength," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The rule will play an even larger role when the playoffs start May 18, Barrett 
said. He said teams with deep pitching staffs will benefit from the rule. 
</P>
<P>
"In the playoffs, we're going to have to have two (extra) pitchers to get us 
through," Barrett said. "If you look at what has happened in the past, teams 
use one kid to get through the entire tournament. With this rule, you can't do 
that anymore. It used to be a kid could get you out of a tournament no matter 
what defense he has behind him. If the teams don't have the depth, you'll eat 
their lunch right there. 
</P>
<P>
"It protects the young arms and in the playoffs, it will make it more of a 
situation where a good team wins, not a team with just one good pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
Karliner said the Ocean View pitchers had mixed emotions about the rule. 
</P>
<P>
"Our initial reaction was bad," he said. "We didn't like it at first because we 
couldn't pitch as much. We like it now, because we realize it saves arms. And 
in the tournaments, you really need more pitchers." 
</P>
<P>
Schaff said he expects the rule to help his team during the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a pretty deep staff, and by the second or third game of the week it 
could really help us," Schaff said. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have two horses like we do it's not a problem," Barrett said. "We 
always have someone who can come in. The only time the rule has come into play 
for us was in the Loara tournament. We came down to our fourth pitcher (Schaff) 
in the championship game when we lost (to nationally ranked Lakewood). Lakewood 
had just a little deeper pitching staff than we did." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes Barrett thinks he has more pitchers than opportunities to use them. 
</P>
<P>
Karliner, who was 8-3 and an all-league selection last year, spent most of the 
season playing first base. He has appeared in only five games as a pitcher, but 
works out on the mound daily. Schaff is the team's designated hitter when he's 
not pitching. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Gwaltney and Karliner would do most of the work this year," Barrett 
said. "Page has been a surprise. Last year, he was our junior varsity pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
Barrett said he fears if Schaff and Karliner are underworked in the regular 
season, they won't be ready if asked to pitch in the playoffs. Both pitch 
batting practice daily. 
</P>
<P>
"Schaff and Karliner throw a lot in the tournament games," Barrett said. "The 
league games are so important that I have to go with my best pitchers, Gwaltney 
and Page. But I try to get Schaff and Karliner in there in the late innings or 
if it's a blowout." 
</P>
<P>
That experience, and depth, could pay off in a few weeks, Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had this many good pitchers," he said. "This is my second year as 
varsity coach and I spent two years with the sophomores and freshmen before 
that. Ocean View has had some good arms, but this is one of the deepest staffs 
we've had." 
</P>
<P>
If you don't believe him, just read the box scores.

ALL-STAR BASKETBALL GAMES SCHEDULED JUNE 24 AT BREN CENTER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two state all-star basketball games, featuring the top boys' and girls' high 
school seniors, have been scheduled for June 24 at UC Irvine's Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
The doubleheader will have a North vs. 
</P>
<P>
South format with a squad of 11 graduating seniors on four teams. 
</P>
<P>
It will be the first state all-star boys' game since 1971, and the first state 
all-star girls' game. 
</P>
<P>
The rosters will be announced in two weeks. Among the players expected to 
compete include Ed O'Bannon of Artesia and Lisa Leslie of Morningside, the 
state's boys' and girls' players of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Sweeney of Lakewood will coach the South boys' team and Joe Murrillo of 
Chino will coach the South girls. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the games will benefit the Boys Clubs of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Players will arrive on June 21, and practices are scheduled at Century High in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Promoter Greg Katz, an assistant coach at Century High, said he decided to 
schedule the games after the success of a Southern California all-stars vs. 
Soviet Junior National team at the Bren Center last summer.

One sloppy defensive play by Cal State Fullerton and two outstanding plays by 
USC led the Trojans to a 5-4 victory over the Titans in a nonconference 
baseball game Tuesday night at USC. 
</P>
<P>
A passed ball charged to Matt Hattabaugh allowed USC to take the lead in the 
seventh inning after the Titans had tied the score, 4-4, in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
USC's Bret Boone pinch-hit for Billy Morris to lead off the seventh and doubled 
when his hit caromed off the third-base bag. Boone took third on a groundout 
and scored on the passed ball to give USC the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (25-17) had the potential tying run on second base in the ninth 
inning. the Titans' Kevin Farlow, who transferred from USC this season, lined 
the ball down the left-field line to lead off the inning, but Murph Proctor 
made a diving catch. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Nevin followed with a single. Mate Borgogno then hit what appeared to be a 
double-play ball toward short, but the ball hit the mound and deflected behind 
shortstop Boone. But Boone reached back and made a strong throw to catch 
Borgogno at first. 
</P>
<P>
With two outs, Nevin was at second and Rich Gonzales came up to bat. But Jeff 
Cirillo got Gonzales to ground out to second to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans now are 2-8 in one-run games, including a 6-5 loss to USC April 10. 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth inning, Farlow led off with a single and Nevin homered to left, 
his 13th of the season and third in the past two games. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton scored first. Frank Charles led off the second inning with a single, 
went to second on a sacrifice, and scored on Matt Hattabaugh's single to left. 
The Titans then loaded the bases, but stranded all three runners. 
</P>
<P>
USC's Mark Smith led off the bottom of the inning with a single. Brett Jenkins 
then hit his second home run, 400 feet to center field. But Fullerton starter 
Rich Faulks retired three consecutive batters to get out of the jam. 
</P>
<P>
USC (32-16) added two runs in the third on Cirillo's two-run home run to take a 
4-1 lead.

ARIZONA STATE INVADES COUNTY FOR OUTFIELDERS

<P>
Arizona State baseball Coach Jim Brock says every year he tries to recruit the 
top four or five players in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Brock pursued and signed three of the Southland's top players, all 
outfielders and all from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the three start for the third-ranked Sun Devils. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Austin of Mater Dei High School is in left, Mike Kelly of Los Alamitos is 
in center and Tommy Adams of Capistrano Valley is in right. 
</P>
<P>
Until he bunted a ball off his nose and missed Friday's 8-4 victory over UCLA, 
Austin was batting .354 with 13 home runs and 36 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Austin, who was all-Southern Section, all-Orange County and the Angelus League 
MVP in his senior season, began the season at third base but has since been 
moved to the outfield, his natural position. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly, hitting .356, is mentioned as a possible NCAA player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Adams, who still holds the Capistrano Valley record for batting average at 
.471, is hitting .303 this season with nine home runs and 27 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Brock landed another Orange County recruit, pitcher Tony Pena from 
Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
Pena has appeared in 19 games, all but one in relief, with a 1-1 record and a 
3.45 earned-run average. ELLIOTT TEAFORD

JAMES FLANIGAN: HOT NEW U.S. INDUSTRY: THE ENVIRONMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was both ironic and a bit sad that environmentalists -- shouting "Wall 
Street kills" -- protested outside the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Because, for one thing, Wall Street loves the environment -- it provides fresh 
merchandise for the securities business, after all. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, a syndicate of the leading brokerage houses -- Merrill Lynch, 
Shearson Lehman, Prudential-Bache, Paine Webber and Dean Witter -- brought out 
a new investment trust devoted to the environment. Two previous environmental 
trusts have attracted $200 million of investor money, with the brokerage houses 
pocketing 4% sales charges. 
</P>
<P>
Fidelity Investments has a $100-million mutual fund devoted to the environment; 
John Hancock's Freedom Environmental Fund is not far behind in total assets. 
And there are smaller, so-called green funds, such as $25-million Progressive 
Securities, that invest in companies deemed to be environmentally sound in 
conducting operations. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly "Wall Street sells" is a more accurate slogan than "Wall Street kills." 
</P>
<P>
But beyond slogans, there are signs the environment may be more than a source 
of quick commissions -- that it may truly be an emerging industry. 
</P>
<P>
It is now attracting venture capital and entrepreneurial companies. First 
Analysis Corp., a Chicago investment and research firm, has $4 million 
committed to such start-ups as Advanced Environmental Recycling, a Springdale, 
Ark., company that turns waste plastic and wood fibers into building materials, 
and EnviroGuard, of Houston, which sells rice hulls as filters for industrial 
wastes. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago Corp., the investment banker that 19 years ago issued the stock of 
Waste Management Inc., is forming a venture capital fund. And Hambrecht &amp; 
Quist, the San Francisco firm that launched Apple Computer and Genentech, has 
$17.5 million backing new companies that recycle solvents and do research on 
microbes to break down garbage. 
</P>
<P>
How good an investment is the environment? In their brief history, the 
environmental funds haven't been world beaters. But Waste Management, a company 
the environmentalists don't like, has done very well, growing 20% a year. At 
$4.5 billion in revenue, Chicago-based Waste Management is the largest company 
in garbage disposal, which is no longer a local trash business but a 
$25-billion, high-technology global industry. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists criticize the company because it has been cited for 
violations by the Environmental Protection Agency, but investment managers 
defend it, pointing out that Waste Management faces greater risks because it 
works more waste disposal sites than any other company. Waste Management itself 
is now meeting with objecting environmental groups to defend its record. 
</P>
<P>
But nobody disputes the fact that the environment is a legally risky business 
-- regulations change frequently and there are a lot of them, from federal, 
state and local authorities. Yet that's one big reason it's a growing business. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, regulation is a moving target," says Donald Andres, senior vice president 
of Emcon Associates, a San Jose engineering firm that designs environmentally 
safe landfills. "But our business expands as knowledge of the problem expands." 
</P>
<P>
For example, EPA is about to issue new regulations for the nation's 6,000 
landfills, most of them municipally owned. And an estimated 80% will be in 
violation, say experts, meaning cities and counties across the land will have 
to call for expert help with their garbage dumps. 
</P>
<P>
And that means business for companies such as Emcon and Waste Management, which 
these days are staffed with chemists and geologists capable of making 
sophisticated judgments about subterranean water and rock formations. 
Ultimately, what used to be simple garbage has now become a long-term financial 
liability -- creating a growing market for insurance. 
</P>
<P>
It may sound to some as though the environment is only riding a tide of red 
tape. But growing knowledge and changing standards have as much to do with it 
as regulation. For example, the $300-million market in industrial face masks is 
undergoing change. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, masks were good enough if they filtered impurities as small as 
1/20th of a human hair. But public health consciousness and new federal 
regulations have changed the standard to 1/200th of a hair. 
</P>
<P>
And so an Egyptian immigrant with a doctorate from the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology named Amad Tayebi and a veteran U.S. manufacturing executive 
named David Scott think that they can make a success of a new kind of mask and 
a new company named Better Breathing Inc., of Lawrence, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
The point is that industries emerge and fortunes are made, when knowledge grows 
and standards change. And that's what is happening now, despite environmental 
groups -- such as the Wall Street protesters -- who denounce business and call 
for a halt to economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
The cold reality is that environmental reform has momentum today because it 
offers opportunity for business, says Andres of Emcon, who has been active in 
the field for 27 years. "If you try to subsidize the environment with taxes, 
the momentum won't be sustained." Anybody who has attempted to raise money, or 
build enthusiasm, for causes such as public education knows Andres is right. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the emerging global environmental industry is one the U.S. 
leads. That's why Waste Management is expanding rapidly overseas, and Kidder, 
Peabody &amp; Co., the investment firm, is holding seminars in Europe to 
explain this new American industry to eager investors. Maybe "Wall Street 
builds" should be the slogan.

BASKIN-ROBBINS, SOVIETS STRIKE A SWEET DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hoping to expand Soviet consumers' horizons beyond vanilla and chocolate, ice 
cream maker Baskin-Robbins will build a new plant outside Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement struck Tuesday, the Glendale-based franchiser will build a 
$30-million plant in the Moscow suburb of Ostankino as a joint venture with a 
Soviet trade ministry. The plant, scheduled to open in 1992, will be staffed by 
about 100 Soviets and will be designed to produce more than 8 million gallons 
of ice cream annually. 
</P>
<P>
That supply will be sold at thousands of existing government-managed food 
stores in Moscow, ending a government monopoly on ice cream freezer space in 
the Soviet capital, said William Savel, president of Baskin-Robbins Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Savel said government-issue ice cream in the Soviet Union is available in only 
two flavors -- chocolate and vanilla. Baskin-Robbins will distribute 10 flavors 
initially and will expand the selection and its markets, aiming for nationwide 
distribution. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a large unmet demand for ice cream," Savel said. "Their ice cream is 
good, but our ice cream is better and we have a greater variety. We think they 
(Soviet consumers) will accept it readily." 
</P>
<P>
Savel said Baskin-Robbins will generate hard currency by selling about 10% of 
its product in Soviet stores that accept only convertible currency, shops 
generally catering to tourists. Baskin-Robbins will use rubles from the food 
stores for plant supplies and expansion efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The venture is Baskin-Robbins' second in the Soviet Union. The firm has been 
selling ice cream from a shop in the Rossiya Hotel in Moscow since 1988, an 
enterprise approved in the wake of the Reagan-Gorbachev summit of that year. 
</P>
<P>
After the first agreement, Baskin-Robbins announced it would sell a flavor 
called "Kremlin Cranberry." To inaugurate the latest deal, the firm said it 
will sell a white and dark chocolate concoction called "Gorba Chocolate."

MILKEN'S GUILTY PLEA; 
</P>
<P>
MILKEN'S FUTURE: PRISON, THEN BACK TO FINANCE?; 
</P>
<P>
WALL STREET: THE SETTLEMENT BARS HIM FOR LIFE FROM 'ANY ASSOCIATION' WITH 
SECURITIES FIRMS, BUT HE COULD DISPENSE INVESTMENT ADVICE TO INDIVIDUAL AND 
INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Milken may have a great career ahead of him -- in the securities 
business. 
</P>
<P>
The junk bond pioneer on Tuesday agreed to a settlement of government charges 
that bars him for life from "any association" with securities firms. But even 
as Milken entered his plea in an emotional court appearance, securities law 
experts were acknowledging that Milken may be able to build a considerable 
business dispensing investment advice to individual and institutional clients 
-- even securities firms. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not necessarily a death sentence for his career," said Ira Sorkin, a 
criminal defense attorney who was formerly head of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission's New York regional office. "Far from it." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Milken said any discussion of career plans was "premature" for 
the former head of Drexel Burnham Lambert's junk bond department, who last year 
set up a firm to help arrange financing for growing companies. But some of 
Milken's former clients were predicting that Milken could assemble a 
considerable client list if he chooses to expand the new firm or launch some 
other enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
In a press conference in Washington, SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden tried to 
stress that the commission would do all it could to keep Milken from returning 
to the industry in which he stood "at the center of a network of deception, 
fraud and deceit." Asked what kind of business opportunities may lie ahead of 
Milken, Breeden said: "The business he will probably be in is serving his 
sentence." 
</P>
<P>
Breeden said the SEC believes that a "substantial" jail term should be imposed 
on Milken. He pointed out that he expects much of Milken's time in the years 
ahead will be taken up giving evidence to the government and preparing to 
defend a raft of civil suits that aggrieved investors are expected to bring. 
Breeden said the SEC wanted to impose the "broadest possible bar" on Milken. 
</P>
<P>
The lifetime ban from the industry means Milken won't be able to become a 
director, officer or other employee of a securities broker-dealer, municipal 
bond dealer or mutual fund company. He won't be able to take a job as a 
registered investment adviser, nor can he underwrite securities. 
</P>
<P>
But securities lawyers point out that if he steps carefully around a welter of 
regulatory restrictions, Milken may still have considerable latitude to act as 
an investment adviser. Under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 he can, for 
example, give investment advice to as many as 14 companies or individuals 
without being registered. 
</P>
<P>
"If he can find 14 billionaires, there's nothing to stop him," Sorkin said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, he could even become a consultant to a securities firm, although the 
SEC might check such an arrangement carefully to make sure a consultancy wasn't 
a cover for some more important role, said one government source. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's new firm, International Capital Access Group, will probably be able to 
continue at least some of its activities if Milken chooses to keep it going. 
</P>
<P>
The company's initial announced purpose was to help minorities and unions find 
financing. Milken has since said the company would also help existing companies 
find new capital and refinance debts, sometimes in exchange for equity stakes 
in those companies. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC's ban wouldn't limit Milken's ability to invest his own capital, nor 
would it prohibit him from acting as an intermediary between client companies 
seeking loans and commercial banks, said the government source. In some cases, 
the SEC bar might limit Milken's ability to act as a middleman between client 
firms and investment banks, however. 
</P>
<P>
If Milken does choose to go back into business, one resource he'll have to 
offer is an invaluable list of client contacts put together over nearly two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those contacts predicted Tuesday that while the felony convictions 
might make some companies hesitant to do business with Milken, others might 
nonetheless gladly line up outside his door. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Greenspun, president of the Las Vegas Sun newspaper, said he expects that 
many public companies -- especially companies in regulated industries -- might 
be wary of relying on Milken in the future. 
</P>
<P>
But, he insisted, "I would have no problem going to him if his advice could 
help us, and I'm sure there are easily hundreds of others who feel the same 
way. . . . He's the most clairvoyant financial thinker. We'd do it in a 
heartbeat." 
</P>
<P>
Greenspun's companies turned to Milken and Drexel for junk bond financing to 
raise money for its Las Vegas cable-television operation. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel J. Krasney, vice chairman of Banner Industries, a Cleveland manufacturer 
that was rebuilt with junk bond financing, said it is "very possible" that 
Banner would turn to Milken again someday if the financier were available. 
"He's one of the great figures of financial history," Krasney said. 
</P>
<P>
He predicted that Milken could rapidly build a large financial consulting firm 
if he chose to do so. Milken could, for example, do a brisk business giving 
advice to companies on how to reduce the heavy debts they took on in the 1980s, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"He could be called in for advice by Mexico, Peru, who knows -- maybe Russia," 
Krasney said. 
</P>
<P>
Former clients and others predicted that the resurrection of Milken's 
reputation may be hastened by his outside interests, including the Milken 
family's foundations, charities that have assets of $350 million. 
</P>
<P>
Some predict that after he has served his jail time, if there is any, Milken 
may also speak out frequently on the financial and charitable topics that 
interest him.

PAPERS SEEK TO ADAPT TO A CHANGING READERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By THOMAS B. ROSENSTIEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Earlier this week at a luncheon in Los Angeles, the publisher of the Knoxville 
Journal in Tennessee asked a waitress, a Latina, whether she read a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The woman had come to the United States for the economic opportunity 12 years 
ago, Knoxville publisher Gerald Garcia recounted, and during the playing of the 
national anthem that had just completed, she had been the first one among those 
near his table to put her hand over her heart. 
</P>
<P>
No, she answered him. "There is nothing in the newspaper for me." 
</P>
<P>
America is changing, and there is a grim feeling among some executives at the 
annual American Newspaper Publishers Assn. convention that newspapers must do 
more to change with it. 
</P>

"Readership is going to be more diverse," Peter A. Morrison, director of RAND 
Corp.'s Population Research Center in Santa Monica told a group of publishers 
Tuesday. The population is fragmenting into more segments -- ethnic, cultural, 
social and economic. And "there is a sense of time as our scarcest resource." 
</P>
<P>
The American household already has changed. In 1970, for instance, 17% of 
Americans lived alone. In 1988, it was 24%. Perhaps more significant, in 1970 
the largest group of households in America -- 40% of the population -- 
consisted of married couples with children. By 1988, that number had shrunk to 
27%, Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
The largest household group today, about 30%, consists of couples with no 
children. 
</P>
<P>
In short, Ozzie and Harriet have been replaced by a patchwork America, with a 
wider rainbow of specialized interests and cultures and values. 
</P>
<P>
How do newspapers, which in the era of newspaper monopolies have functioned by 
appealing to mass audiences in local regions, remain meaningful to this more 
segmented nation? 
</P>
<P>
One answer, publishers have repeatedly heard this week, is that newspapers must 
change the ethnic and cultural makeup of their staffs, not as a matter of 
justice but of economic survival. Looking over the leaders of the newspaper 
industry in the audience at one panel Tuesday, ABC "Nightline" correspondent 
and syndicated columnist Jeff Greenfield said, "This is not exactly the United 
Nations out here." 
</P>
<P>
In the next 10 years, RAND demographer Morrison said, six out of seven new 
Californians will be either Latino or Asian. "But these are the groups most 
newspapers overlook." 
</P>
<P>
Another idea gaining currency is that newspapers should target specific groups 
of readers, to "niche market" within the umbrella of their mass-appeal 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Dodge Fielder, vice president of research for Knight-Ridder Inc. in 
Miami, said many of the techniques, such as new graphics or even trying to 
attract non-readers with things such as telephone information lines, is only 
"window-dressing," inadequate to the task. 
</P>
<P>
"An 800 phone number isn't going to do it. Maybe separating your Calendar 
section and selling it to readers alone will," she said, referring to the Los 
Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a simmering issue now, particularly in larger cities, is whether large 
newspapers must in effect become several newspapers, as Fielder suggested. 
</P>
<P>
"The mass market died 20 years ago," said Laurel Cutler, vice chairman of the 
advertising firm FCB/Leber Katz Partners in New York and vice president of 
consumer affairs for Chrysler Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"What the rest of us decided is that the country is a bunch of niches," she 
said, referring to the marketing of consumer products, "and we are giving up 
market share for brand share." 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers have not moved adequately in that direction, she argued. The more 
newspapers try to add new sections that will appeal to more groups, the more 
they will "grow fatter and fatter . . . and the less meaningful you become to 
any one of these audiences. Why haven't you tried going the other way?" 
</P>
<P>
Why couldn't one company put out different newspapers, she suggested, in effect 
different brands, in different languages, in different neighborhoods and aimed 
at different interests? 
</P>
<P>
But several executives disagreed with Cutler's view that newspapers must 
emulate the consumer product business and market different brands to different 
population niches. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a real problem in segregating audiences," said Karen F. Brown, an 
associate at the Poynter Institute for Media Studies in St. Petersburg, Fla. "I 
need to know a little bit about what is going on in their world and they need 
to know a little bit about what is going on in mine." 
</P>
<P>
Shelby Coffey III, editor and executive vice president of The Times, countered 
that newspapers can reach different audiences without cutting up their 
newspapers. They can do it through zoning to different neighborhoods, by 
creating new sections that appeal to specialized interests and by making the 
paper easier to read so that people know where in the paper to find these 
items, Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to grow and be inclusive. We are an engine of democracy," Coffey said. 
"Simply targeting will lead us all to become Avenue magazine," he said, 
referring to an ultra-slick periodical in New York so narrowly targeted that it 
is literally aimed at the wealthiest on the East Side of Manhattan and those 
who aspire to live there. "That is not what newspapers are all about." 
</P>
<P>
Research also suggests that newspapers are losing women, who dropped as 
frequent readers from 61% in 1982 to 45% in 1987, according to Susan H. Miller, 
director of editorial development for Scripps Howard. To win those readers 
back, Miller urged newspapers to more seriously cover women and topics such as 
parenting, relationships and time-saving hints that have helped women's 
magazines thrive. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers in general do a poor job of covering many of the subcultures that 
make up the new society, a failure that causes people to feel that they are 
being excluded from the society, a kind of "symbolic annihilation." 
</P>
<P>
More distressing, editors heard all week, is the poor state of education, which 
is creating a cultural underclass that crosses all ethnic lines and that might 
never pick up newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1967, the number of young adults age 18 to 29 who read newspapers every 
day has shriveled from 60% in 1967 to just 25% in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"My analysis of young people's recent trends in newspaper use can only be 
described as a dark cloud of typhoon proportions," Prof. Gerald Stone of 
Memphis State University told a preconvention symposium Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
One potential bright spot, demographer Morrison suggested, is that the 
population is getting older as the Baby Boom generation heads toward middle 
age. Older people have traditionally have been most loyal newspaper readers. 
</P>
<P>
But to reach them, the newspaper of the not-too-distant future must be far 
different. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't think that because trends are slow doesn't mean they aren't happening," 
said Fielder of Knight-Ridder. "We have to recognize that what we are doing 
now, if the trends continue, won't work in the future."

Employment Costs Surge: The Labor Department reported that wages, salaries and 
benefits paid to American workers rose by 1.7% in the first quarter, up from 
the 1% gain in the fourth quarter of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The rise left the employment cost index up a strong 5.5% in the 12 months 
ending in March, the highest rate in nearly five years. Tight labor markets 
take much of the blame for pushing employment costs higher. Two other factors 
pushing employment costs up have been rising health insurance premiums and a 
jump in required Social Security contributions.

McDonnell Douglas Debt Rating Under Review: Moody's Investors Services said it 
is looking at whether to downgrade the debt rating of McDonnell Douglas 
following the company's continuing losses on its commercial aircraft operation 
and the deteriorating outlook for defense. The rating agency said it is 
focusing on whether problems at the firm's Douglas Aircraft unit will affect 
overall credit quality and cash flow. The ratings include the single A3 rating 
on McDonnell's senior debt, BAA1 subordinated debt rating and the single A2 
rating on McDonnell Douglas Finance Corp.'s senior debt.

S&amp;L Bailout Officials Delay Action: The board of the Resolution Trust Corp. 
was set to vote on a new policy that would have allowed the agency to sell 
properties as much as 20% to 30% below their appraised value. The agency's 
current policy is to sell no property in six distressed states -- Texas, 
Oklahoma, Louisiana, Colorado, New Mexico and Arkansas -- for less than 95% of 
its appraised value. However, it agreed to delay a vote for two weeks after 
Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarke said he feared the effect of 
cut-price sales on financial institutions operating in fragile real estate 
markets.

TIMES MIRROR NET SLUMPS 33%; SOFT AD MARKETS CITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Times Mirror Co. reported Tuesday that its first-quarter net income fell to $46 
million, down 33% from the $68.8 million in earnings the company posted in the 
first three months of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue for the Los Angeles-based media concern -- which owns broadcast and 
cable properties as well as the Los Angeles Times, Newsday in New York and the 
Baltimore Sun papers, among others -- increased 3% to $875.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Robert F. Erburu, chairman and chief executive of Times Mirror, said the 
company's first-quarter results "were adversely affected by the weak 
performance of our advertising-supported business lines, which continued to 
operate under extremely difficult market and economic conditions." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the difficult conditions, many analysts continue to believe that Times 
Mirror has been spared the brunt of the advertising slump because the largest 
of its media properties -- including The Times, the company's four television 
stations and some of its cable systems -- operate outside the northeast United 
States, where advertising has been weakest. 
</P>
<P>
Yet analysts are divided over whether the advertising slump will remain 
confined. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see the problem spreading throughout the country," said Rodd J. 
Macklin, an analyst at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. in Baltimore. "The L.A. 
Times had a fairly decent period in terms of advertising in the first quarter." 
Excluding part-run issues, he said, The Times was only down about 2%, compared 
to double-digit decreases for some of the company's other papers. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, John P. Reddan, an analyst for the Moran &amp; Associates Inc. 
investment firm in Greenwich, Conn., is more pessimistic: "I don't see any 
signs of it (soft advertising) bottoming yet; I could see it getting worse." 
</P>
<P>
Times Mirror's results were also affected by a surge in The Times' daily and 
Sunday circulation, about half of which was attributable to the closure of the 
Los Angeles Herald Examiner last November. Although the 9.5% gain in The Times' 
daily circulation and 5.6% improvement in Sunday circulation helped boost 
revenue for the paper, it also increased operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
Times Mirror's newspaper publishing group, its largest business segment, 
reported a 38.1% decline in operating profit and a 1.3% decline in revenue for 
the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Times Mirror's professional book companies, which include Matthew Bender &amp; 
Co., Richard D. Irwin and Mosby-Year Book Inc., made strong gains, offsetting 
an advertising slowdown among the company's consumer magazines. As a result, 
the book, magazine and other publishing segments recorded a 21.7% increase in 
operating profit. 
</P>
<P>
Cable television also posted increased revenue and operating profit for the 
quarter, primarily by attracting more cable subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
Although broadcast television revenue rose slightly in the quarter, increased 
programming costs produced a 14.1% decline in operating profit, the company 
said.

TIMES CIRCULATION CLIMBS 9.5% TO RECORD HIGH OF 1,225,189 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Los Angeles Times' daily circulation for the three months ended March 31 
rose 9.5% to an all-time high of 1,225,189, according to figures filed with the 
Audit Bureau of Circulations, a nationwide agency that verifies circulation. 
Sunday circulation increased 5.6% to 1,514,096 in the period, also a record. 
</P>
<P>
David Laventhol, publisher and chief executive of the Los Angeles Times, 
estimated that about half of the overall increase reflected former readers of 
the Los Angeles Herald Examiner, which closed in November, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
ABC figures are usually reported in six-month intervals. But in this case, the 
three-month figures may be a more accurate indicator; the six-month figures 
include the month of October, when the Herald Examiner was still publishing. 
</P>
<P>
For the six months ended March 31, The Times' daily circulation increased 8.2% 
to 1,210,077. Sunday circulation increased 5.7% to 1,504,540. 
</P>
<P>
Circulation also increased in Orange County, up 8% daily to 179,981 and up 7.5% 
Sunday to 224,028. In the San Fernando Valley, circulation was up 9.4% daily to 
220,475 and up 7.6% Sunday to 283,387. The figures for Orange County and the 
San Fernando Valley are for the six months ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
The Daily News, a competitor of the Los Angeles Times that primarily serves the 
San Fernando Valley, said it reported to ABC that its daily circulation climbed 
14.5% to 202,384 for the six months ended March 31 and that its Sunday 
circulation rose 7.7% to 214,205. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Register, which serves Orange County, has not yet released 
six month circulation figures, a spokesman said. JUBE SHIVER Jr.

OIL FIRMS POST MIXED RESULTS; TEXACO PROFITS DROP 77% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chevron Corp. on Tuesday said that its first-quarter net income jumped 51%, 
while Phillips Petroleum Co. reported a 36.3% increase. 
</P>
<P>
But Mobil Corp. reported a 7% decline in net income in the first quarter, 
mainly reflecting lower petrochemical earnings, while Texaco Inc.'s net income 
plummeted 77.4% and Shell Oil Co. posted a 44% decline. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the companies said they benefitted from higher prices of crude oil 
and natural gas during the quarter. In many cases, the declines in net income 
were due to special accounting features, while actual proceeds from oil and gas 
rose. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-ranked Chevron credited its strong earnings performance to a worldwide 
increase in the production of oil and gas. Net income for the quarter jumped to 
$473 million from $313 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron's first-quarter revenue rose 20.8% to $9.3 billion from $7.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"We were able to produce natural gas at record levels, reflecting in part the 
development of Gulf of Mexico properties purchased from Tenneco in 1988," said 
Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Derr. 
</P>
<P>
The outlook for the second quarter remains unclear because of continued 
volatility in crude prices, Derr said. Chevron, based in San Francisco, also is 
working on completing several sales of assets that could yield significant net 
gains this year. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil, the nation's second-largest oil company, said its earnings slipped to 
$400 million from $429 million in the first quarter of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
New York-based Mobil said its chemical division had sharply lower earnings, 
reflecting a worldwide drop in petrochemical prices from record levels a year 
earlier. Earnings from petroleum operations rose sharply, on the other hand, 
mainly due to higher crude and gas prices. 
</P>
<P>
First-quarter revenue rose 6.4% to $14.9 billion from $14 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Texaco, which ranks third behind Exxon Corp. and Mobil, said its net income 
fell to $328 million from $1.45 billion in the first quarter of 1989. However, 
results for the year-earlier quarter included a one-time net gain of $1.19 
billion resulting mainly from the sale of Texaco Canada Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding the restructuring gain, Texaco's first-quarter net income rose 23.8% 
to $328 million from $265 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Texaco's steady performance in the first quarter showed strong (exploration 
and production) earnings reflecting the higher crude oil and natural gas prices 
prevailing during the period," James W. Kinnear, Texaco's president and chief 
executive, said. "However, there has been a weakening in these prices in the 
second quarter." 
</P>
<P>
First-quarter revenue declined 4.7% to $9.16 billion from $9.61 billion. Texaco 
is based in White Plains, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, ranked 11th and based in Bartlesville, Okla., said its net income 
jumped to $259 million from $190 million. Earnings in the first quarter of this 
year include a net gain of $148 million from an accounting change and other 
one-time features. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue rose 0.1% to $3.13 billion from $3.10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Shell, the sixth-largest U.S. oil company, with headquarters in Houston, is 
wholly owned by the Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Cos., a British-Dutch 
enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Shell said the drop in its first-quarter earnings -- to $203 million from $362 
million -- was largely due to a $70-million insurance settlement gained in the 
year-earlier quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue increased 11.5% to $5.8 billion from $5.2 billion.

TriCare Acquisition: TriCare Inc. said Monday that it intends to acquire the 
occupational treatment operations of an unnamed health-care services company in 
the Inland Empire. 
</P>
<P>
"We're awfully excited about this acquisition," said Steve Bullock, chief 
executive officer at Santa Ana-based TriCare. Bullock declined to identify the 
company but said the purchase price is in excess of $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
TriCare, an occupational health-care company that went public Jan. 26, will 
acquire the health-care services company's assets and assume certain contracts 
of various medical groups providing treatment to injured workers, Bullock said. 
The Inland Empire firm has net revenue in excess of $7 million, TriCare said.

THRIFT: NEWPORT BEACH S&amp;L NETS $13.2 MILLION TO START YEAR, NEARLY EQUALING

<P>
Downey Savings &amp; Loan, stashing away capital for a possible future 
conversion to a bank, posted net income of $13.2 million for the first quarter, 
nearly reaching its earnings for all of last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach-based thrift's earnings were lower than the $21 million 
recorded in the corresponding period last year, but half of that quarter's 
amount came from accounting changes. 
</P>
<P>
The first-quarter profit marks a turnaround from losses in the second half of 
1989, including a $9.4-million fourth-quarter loss, that dropped Downey's 
annual earnings to $13.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pleased with the results," said David L. Boyles, Downey's recently named 
chief operating officer. "The first quarter came out very much how we thought 
it would."

Industry analysts are predicting that the sale of Downey's valuable real estate 
holdings this year should push 1990 earnings to as much as $100 million. The 
thrift has nearly $95 million in tax credits it must use this year or lose. 
More than $12 million of the thrift's first-quarter earnings came from gains on 
its sale of properties. 
</P>
<P>
What is driving Downey, though, isn't its real estate sales, but its basic 
savings and loan operations, said James F. Wilson, an industry analyst with 
Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Operating earnings -- excluding real estate sales and other nonrecurring gains 
or losses -- increased roughly 40% to about $10.5 million for the first 
quarter, Wilson estimated. 
</P>
<P>
"They're simply doing well in the S&amp;L business," he said. Downey's profit 
margin on its loans has nearly doubled from the end of June, 1989, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Downey has earned a solid reputation for building neighborhood shopping centers 
throughout California and in Arizona. Only a few years ago, it owned more than 
90 centers and 55 other real estate projects. But a new federal law requires 
all thrifts to sell their real estate holdings by the end of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter, which ended March 31, Downey sold or put into escrow 
11 projects worth $149.9 million. And more properties are being added regularly 
to that category, said A.J. Morsillo, the S&amp;L's controller. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell Chaney, an analyst for Sutro &amp; Co. in San Francisco, had expected 
Downey to post higher earnings. But Chaney said the timing of the real estate 
sales may simply be lagging. He said he expects Downey's profits to rise in the 
next three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Downey's real estate and securities portfolios took a major hit in the last 
quarter of 1989 when changes in federal law forced the thrift to write down the 
value of those assets. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those problems continued through the first quarter as Downey socked 
away $5 million in reserves for writedowns on its mortgage-backed securities, 
which are bonds whose value fell during a rising interest rate market. 
</P>
<P>
Downey's deposits and assets fell during the quarter, mainly due to the results 
of a former subsidiary, Butterfield Savings &amp; Loan in Santa Ana. 
Butterfield was seized by regulators in August, 1985, and Downey purchased it 
from regulators in September, 1988, acquiring $240 million in tax credits in 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Downey then started dropping Butterfield's interest rates on deposits, which 
led many Butterfield customers to take their money elsewhere. About $126 
million in original Butterfield deposits were pulled out of Downey during the 
first quarter, giving the S&amp;L a net decline in deposits of $72.7 million to 
$3.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Mainly as a result of the continuing drain in Butterfield deposits over the 
last year, Downey's assets fell to $4 billion at the end of March from $4.2 
billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Downey already exceeds the capital requirements imposed by the new federal law 
and is trying to build its capital even higher in a bid to convert into a bank, 
though most industry analysts say little would be accomplished by that move 
because banks and S&amp;Ls are nearly identical now. 
</P>
<P>
Boyles, a former Bank of America executive, was hired recently to increase 
Downey's commercial banking activities and run the savings and loan operations 
while other executives concentrate on selling the thrift's real estate. 
</P>
<P>

during the past nine quarters.

SPRING MOUNTAIN GROUP TO OPEN 40 BRANCHES IN 3 YEARS

<P>
The plans for growth at Spring Mountain Group in Newport Beach are coming fast. 
</P>
<P>
The holding company's main subsidiary, Spring Mountain Escrow Corp., announced 
that it expects to double its branches in the next three years by opening 40 
offices in Northern California, starting with six new offices by July. 
</P>
<P>
The escrow firm has hired Ted D. Gregory as senior vice president and regional 
manager for the Northern California operation. He will oversee Spring 
Mountain's daily operations and manage sales and new business development 
there. Gregory, who has 23 years of experience in the financial services field, 
recently managed Bank of America's escrow division in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Spring Mountain was formed in late 1985 when investors acquired 
Shearson/American Express Escrow Co. in Newport Beach and its 20 offices. It 
doubled its size a year later with the purchase of Security Pacific Corp.'s 
escrow operation. It also opened several branches. 
</P>
<P>
Spring Mountain Group's chairman and majority owner, Frank O'Bryan, has been 
aiming at Northern California for the last few years but hasn't yet opened any 
branches north of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
By July, though, he expects to have offices in the Sacramento, San Francisco, 
San Jose, Concord, Manteca and Santa Rosa areas. 
</P>
<P>
About half the escrow firm's business comes from home builders who steer home 
buyers to the firm. Those builders, O'Bryan said, are starting to build more 
frequently in Northern California and have asked him to set up a business 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Spring Mountain Escrow now operates 42 branches from Ventura County to the 
Mexican border. The escrow industry is highly fragmented, but Spring Mountain 
believes it is the nation's largest independent escrow firm with $15 million in 
annual revenue last year.

ALLERGAN PROFIT DIPS IN QUARTER; REVENUE RISES

<P>
Citing costs from the expansion of its sales force, Allergan Inc. on Tuesday 
reported first-quarter net earnings of $13.6 million, down 5.6% from $14.4 
million for the first quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine-based manufacturer of eye and skin products posted a 9.2% increase 
in sales to $195.1 million for the three months ended March 31, up from $178.6 
million for the same period in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff D'Eliscu, Allergan's director of investor relations, said increased sales 
were offset by higher expenditures related to the expansion of the company's 
sales effort, including the addition of a consumer sales force targeting such 
retailers as pharmacies and grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
Also, he said, Allergan has incurred higher operating costs because of 
duplication of its manufacturing activities as the company gradually moves them 
from Irvine to Puerto Rico and Waco, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
However, D'Eliscu said the Irvine manufacturing unit will be completely closed 
down soon, and the company should begin to reap cost savings from the move. 
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the first-quarter sales results, Gavin S. Herbert, the company's 
chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Sales in the pharmaceutical, 
surgical and international businesses continue strong." 
</P>
<P>
But he also noted that "adverse market trends affecting our optical business 
are continuing, with sales down slightly by 0.4% as compared to the first 
quarter 1989. These sales were negatively affected, in part, by competitive 
pricing and product pressures and the ongoing softness in the contact lens 
market." 
</P>
<P>
Allergan spokesman Norris Battin said the company is "definitely feeling" the 
repercussions of a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine last 
fall that talked about harm done to eyes by contact lenses that are worn 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Battin said that although Allergan primarily sells contact lenses that are 
meant to be removed and cleaned daily, the adverse publicity has hurt the 
entire industry. 
</P>
<P>
The company's sales strategy, company officials said, is to develop new lens 
disinfection systems and other products to serve existing contact lens wearers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, they said, the company is moving aggressively into the bifocal 
contact lens market with the realization that the 18- to 24-year-old group that 
traditionally bought the most contact lenses is shrinking as the baby boom 
generation ages.

TRASH LENDS INSIGHT INTO SLAVE LIFE 
</P>

<P>
It was outside the women's restroom at Mt. Vernon that archeologist Dennis 
Pogue collected some of his best trash -- remnants of wine bottles, china, even 
leftover dinners -- buried in a cellar of slave quarters 200 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Pogue said he sifted through bits of fine imported porcelain, swirled stemware 
and shards of wine bottles as well as more than 25,000 bones of opossums, 
sheep, cattle, geese and other animals. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery, during a recently completed archeological dig on George 
Washington's 500-acre Virginia plantation, tends to dispel some myths about 
slave life, said Pogue, who works for the plantation. 
</P>
<P>
The items, similar to many unearthed in a similar dig several years ago at 
Monticello, Thomas Jefferson's home, suggest that all slaves may not have eaten 
only out of gourds and crude wooden bowls as originally thought. Some may have 
used china and porcelain handed down from the mansion. The wine bottles don't 
necessarily suggest the slaves drank wine, Pogue said. They may have held other 
liquids. 
</P>
<P>
The range of animal bones discovered suggests that some slaves' diets were more 
diverse than originally thought, that they had time to hunt and had access to 
weapons, Pogue said. Lead shot also was found in the trash. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very confident that the slaves had some weapons," Pogue said. "They had 
a wider diversity of foods . . . and most of them would have come from the 
slaves' own efforts." 
</P>
<P>
The suggestion that slaves had time to hunt would quash the notion that every 
slave worked from dawn to dusk, Pogue said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to be very careful not to say more than the data suggest," Pogue 
continued. "We're not going to say they were living the life of Riley . . . but 
clearly they had time to do these things." 
</P>
<P>
Other academics concurred in some of Pogue's conclusions that, although slave 
life was harsh, materially it may have been somewhat better than historians 
previously believed. 
</P>
<P>
"The daily life of slaves was very, very hard in comparison to the life of 
their owners and other whites," said Russell Adams, chairman of the Department 
of Afro-American Studies at Howard University. "The diet was borderline, enough 
to keep them producing, but not enough to make them very healthy. The seasonal 
work was arduous, especially when agricultural products were bringing high 
prices." 
</P>
<P>
But Adams said that after harvest, on Saturday nights and on Sundays, slaves 
did have some leisure time and were encouraged to hunt to supplement their 
diets and keep busy. 
</P>
<P>
Pogue said it is unclear whether all of Washington's more than 300 slaves 
enjoyed fine china and hunting privileges or just the 70 blacksmiths, 
carpenters, shoemakers, spinners, weavers and other artisans who lived near the 
mansion. 
</P>
<P>
Historians have documented a plantation hierarchy that awarded the highest 
status -- and best living conditions -- to slaves who worked in the mansion, 
followed by those in crafts and then field hands. 
</P>
<P>
Pogue said he hopes to dig at the site of Mt. Vernon's field slaves' quarters 
this summer to compare living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
One item unearthed at Mt. Vernon and in digs elsewhere is a type of bowl called 
colonoware, a crude, unglazed kind of pottery. Archeologists wonder whether 
this was made by slaves, American Indians or both, Pogue said. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be some African holdover," Pogue said, or the bowls may have had 
something to do with the kind of foods slaves ate.

<P>
So, this guy at the office asked me when the baby was due, and I told him the 
end of May, which at the time was 10 weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
"The end of May?" He was surprised. "You're going to be huge." 
</P>
<P>
I answered him gently, considering what he deserved, but he caught my meaning. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I was being rude," he said, as if I was out of line. 
</P>
<P>
Being a mom and having a strong drive to nurture, I changed the subject so he 
wouldn't have to stand there in the crowded elevator and squirm with guilt. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the fellow who eyed my belly and offered: "Any day now, huh?" 
Three more months, I told him. Close. 
</P>
<P>
What is it about pregnancy that makes people think it is appropriate to 
volunteer all manner of comments about one's size and shape? 
</P>
<P>
No subject is off limits. Complete strangers feel compelled to remark on my 
diet, my clothing, the amount and kind of exercise I get, even the way I sit. 
</P>
<P>
A friend at the office put her arm around me and said warmly: "What are you 
doing in high heels? You look like you can hardly walk." 
</P>
<P>
My how-to-be-pregnant book warned me about this phenomenon -- that people act 
as if pregnancy is an open invitation to cast tact and sensitivity to the 
winds. But I didn't believe that any of the educated, enlightened professionals 
I work with would be such dunderheads. 
</P>
<P>
I asked around. It happens to everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"My favorite," said one mom, "was 'Haven't you had that baby yet?' As if you're 
offending people by appearing in their field of vision. Or as if you're 
inconveniencing them by being pregnant." 
</P>
<P>
Said another, who was due in five weeks: "Somebody asked me just yesterday when 
the baby was due and said, 'Looks like at about lunchtime!' 
</P>
<P>
"Charming." 
</P>
<P>
Even dads get it. One father recalls a cafeteria cashier blurting: "You're too 
old to be a new father." 
</P>
<P>
One woman at work looks me up and down and just laughs. "You are really looking 
pregnant," she says with some frequency. As if there is something odd about a 
pregnant person looking pregnant. As if that might have changed since the other 
17 times she made the same remark. 
</P>
<P>
Another watched me walk past her department and burst into giggles. "What's 
funny?" I asked. "Oh," she bubbled, "you're just so cute." Like a duck waddling 
by, she meant. 
</P>
<P>
"You've been pregnant for about two years now," said a male co-worker. "When is 
that baby due?" I started to walk away without replying, but he wasn't done. 
"Is that really a baby, or do you have a pillow under there?" 
</P>
<P>
What a wit. 
</P>
<P>
My sensitive brother, whom I hadn't seen in several months, asked: "So, are you 
as big as a cow?" 
</P>
<P>
Last pregnancy, I got into an elevator with someone whose name I knew, but that 
was the extent of our acquaintance. 
</P>
<P>
"How much weight have you gained?" she opened. 
</P>
<P>
In a restroom, a woman whose name I didn't know (and who had never before 
acknowledged my existence) volunteered: "Whoa, you look like you're about to 
pop." 
</P>
<P>
"Two more months," I chirped. 
</P>
<P>
"Mm," she said, frowning and shaking her head. 
</P>
<P>
And you, I wanted to reply, are rude. But two months from now, I won't be 
pregnant, and you will still be rude. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't say it, of course. That would have been tactless and insensitive. 
</P>
<P>
But there was one stranger in an elevator -- a new parent himself, it turned 
out -- who did say just the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
"When's your baby due?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Six more weeks," I told him. 
</P>
<P>
"Congratulations," he said with a big smile. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks! I needed that.

SUPREME COURT RULES AGAINST CLASSIC FILM OWNERS; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: THE DISTRIBUTORS OF 'REAR WINDOW' MUST SHARE EARNINGS FROM THE FILM'S 
RE-RELEASE WITH A LITERARY AGENT. SOME CLAIM THE RULING COULD LIMIT THE 
AVAILABILITY OF OLD MOVIES. THOUSANDS OF WORKS COULD BE AFFECTED.

<P>
In a costly defeat for the producers of classic motion pictures, the Supreme 
Court said Tuesday that authors and songwriters whose original works were 
incorporated into old movies are entitled to profit from the re-release of 
those productions. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-3 decision means that the owners of hundreds of old films which have been 
re-issued for use in theaters, television or videocassettes may be forced to 
share millions in profits with the heirs of the original artists. 
</P>
<P>
The impact can be seen in the case before the court: For $650, Sheldon Abend, a 
self-described "literary speculator" in New York, bought the copyright in the 
1970s for the short story "It Had to be Murder." Its author, Cornell Woolrich, 
had sold this and several other stories to a film production company in 1945 
for $9,250. 
</P>
<P>
Before Woolrich's 28-year copyright expired, the author himself expired in 
1968, leaving no heirs. 
</P>
<P>
But his work lived on. In 1954, actor Jimmy Stewart and producer Alfred 
Hitchcock had used Woolrich's story to make the movie classic "Rear Window" at 
Paramount. Now, thanks to the high court ruling, Abend -- who in effect is the 
author's heir because he bought the copyright -- can lay claim to a share of 
the $12 million in revenues from the re-release of "Rear Window" by Universal 
in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"For the studios and the public, this could be a very serious situation," said 
Sheldon Mittleman, house counsel for Universal Pictures. "It could mean that 
the American public will be deprived of the chance to see classic movies." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's decision does not affect more recent movies, television programs, 
musical recordings or other artistic productions. They are governed by the 
Copyright Act of 1976, which took effect Jan. 1, 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Works issued before 1978 are governed by the Copyright Act of 1909. 
Interpreting the history of this law, the Supreme Court concluded Tuesday it 
was intended to give authors and other artists a "second chance" to profit from 
their original works. 
</P>
<P>
First, they were paid when they sold their works to a producer. In doing so, 
they signed over a 28-year copyright. 
</P>
<P>
But they are also entitled to a second sale when it comes time to renew the 
copyright for another 28-year period, the court said. Songs and stories that 
were once sold for hundreds of dollars may now be worth millions since they 
have been incorporated into highly successful movies, plays, recordings or 
television productions. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen A. Kroft, a Beverly Hills attorney who represented the major Hollywood 
studios in the case, said thousands of old movies, as well as records, plays 
based on novels and textbooks could be affected by the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the motion picture studios are going to have to deal with those 
people who own the copyrights. I say 'unfortunately' because a lot of people 
like Abend have snapped up those rights for virtually nothing and now want to 
hold up the studios," Kroft said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have a musical with a whole lot of different songs, you are going to 
have multiple problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling could also discourage distributors from re-releasing old films, said 
Louis P. Petrich, a Los Angeles lawyer who represented Stewart and Hitchcock's 
heirs. 
</P>
<P>
The court said that a living author or songwriter cannot sign away his renewal 
rights for a second, 28-year period. As a result, Petrich said, film 
distributors cannot know in advance what an author's heirs might seek as a 
share of the re-release profits. 
</P>
<P>
"The practical effect of this might be to keep a lot of old works on the 
shelf," Petrich said. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1976 copyright law, Congress said old copyrights could be renewed for a 
third, 19-year period. This extends the total life of a copyright to 75 years. 
</P>
<P>
"This means that families of authors will be given a meaningful chance to 
benefit from the exploitation of the author's work. It could affect thousands 
of films and tens of thousands of old songs," said Peter J. Anderson, a Santa 
Monica attorney who represented Abend. 
</P>
<P>
For at least the past decade, the major Hollywood studios have operated on an 
entirely different legal theory of copyrights. The 1909 law speaks of 
"derivative works." Lawyers for the studios contended that motion pictures, as 
"derivative works," had their own copyright that incorporated everything that 
went into the production. 
</P>
<P>
"Our argument is that the movie itself is entitled to recognition and 
protection," Universal's Mittleman said. "It is copyrighted and no one else can 
make prints of it, but now the owner can't show it. We think that is absurd." 
</P>
<P>
The studios have argued that Woolrich's heirs could still use or sell the story 
"It Had to Be Murder," but they should have no claim to the movie "Rear 
Window." In 1977, the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals had endorsed this 
theory of copyright law. 
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday, the Supreme Court majority flatly rejected it. 
</P>
<P>
"The renewal provisions (in the Copyright Act of 1909) were intended to give 
the author a second chance to obtain fair remuneration for his creative efforts 
and to provide the author's family a 'new estate' if the author died before the 
renewal period arrived," wrote Justice Sandra Day O'Connor for the court in 
Jimmy Stewart vs. Sheldon Abend, 88-2102. 
</P>
<P>
The copyrights of stories or songs incorporated into a movie are "independent" 
of the movie's copyright, the court said. Even if the author or songwriter had 
long ago signed over the renewal rights to his work after the 28-year copyright 
expired, this agreement means nothing, O'Connor said. Simply put, the law does 
not allow the author to give away the rights of his widow or heirs to profit 
from the sale of the second, 28-year copyright. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices John Paul Stevens and Antonin 
Scalia dissented.

<P>
The ruling upholds a decision last year by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals in Pasadena. While the appeals court refused to allow Abend or other 
heirs to block the distribution of classic motion pictures, it said that he and 
other holders of copyrights to original works can seek a fair share of the 
profits from re-releases. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the case goes back to U.S. District Judge A. Andrew Hauk in Los Angeles to 
determine how much of $12 million in re-release revenues earned by "Rear 
Window" should go to Abend as the owner of the story copyright. 
</P>
<P>
Mittleman said that the Supreme Court's interpretation of the copyright law 
applies only in the United States. "Interestingly enough, that is not the law 
in the rest of the world," he said. "The studio can distribute 'Rear Window' in 
every country in the world -- in Canada, England, anywhere -- except in the 
U.S."

UNEVEN 'LORD OF MEDFLIES' FROM SECOND CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whenever Robin Duke is on stage at Second City's Santa Monica branch, it's 
difficult to concentrate on anyone else. Her gawky features, her impossibly 
wide smile, her elastic figure -- they all promise laughter ahead. And they 
usually deliver. 
</P>
<P>
"Lord of the Medflies," the group's latest revue, includes an extended 
(four-scene) sketch about the perils of jaywalking in Santa Monica. A fairly 
enterprising examination of a mundane topic, it will be remembered most for 
Duke's two subsidiary roles, as a cretinous sidekick to a tyrannical traffic 
school teacher and as Santa Monica herself. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, Duke is also the star of this revue's one attempt to go beyond 
comedy, a soppy little scene in which a woman imagines what her son would be 
like if she hadn't had an abortion 14 years ago. She's so touched by her 
fantasy that she decides to have a baby. There is no edge to this sketch, no 
deeply felt pain, and no subtlety either -- just a synthetic wistfulness. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the program, Duke and lanky Ryan Stiles play a perpetually 
bickering couple who continue their squabbling even beyond the grave. It's one 
of the evening's better moments. And it's followed by the cleverest conceit of 
the evening, Michael Hagerty and Chris Barnes as pool hustlers of a different 
stripe (it would spoil the joke to describe that stripe in any more detail). 
</P>
<P>
Stiles, Barnes and Deborah Theaker, the newest member of the company, make much 
out of a woman's over-reliance on her contractor and her therapist. Stiles has 
a funny solo with a silent guitar. 
</P>
<P>
The action is punctuated with some extremely brief blackouts. One of them, 
about traffic on the 405 Freeway, is hilarious (Duke and Stiles again). One, 
featuring Duke as Rapunzel, is -- despite its brevity -- much ado about 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the subjects are overly familiar. The cast nevertheless takes a few of 
these to the limit and succeeds almost in spite of the material -- witness a 
sketch about talkers in movie theaters, or a two-part piece about the Abraham 
Lincoln display at Disneyland. But in other sketches, the feeling of deja vu is 
unavoidable, as in a parody of a frothy morning news show and a poke at Exxon 
-- more than a year after the oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
The Exxon sketch is a reminder that this group still hasn't mastered quick 
topical satire -- listen to virtually any of the numbers sung by the Capitol 
Steps on public radio, and you'll hear how much wittier this genre can be. A 
song that attempts to paint President Bush as Oedipus -- or "Oedibush" -- fails 
to fulfill the promise of its initial concept. 
</P>
<P>
John Hemphill, a former member of the Santa Monica company, directed 
"Medflies," and Larry Schanker provides musical accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
 At 214 Santa Monica Blvd., Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays at 8 
p.m. and 10:30 p.m., Sundays at 7:30 p.m., indefinitely. Tickets: $7-$15; (213)

GYROMATICS TO PLAY REUNION SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Gyromatics, one of the most offbeat bands the Orange County pop music scene 
produced in the 1980s, has reunited and will make its first public performances 
in nearly two years May 11 and 12 at the Sunset Pub in Sunset Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Leader/guitarist Ron Eglit, singer Floyd Elliot, saxophonist Alan Palmer and 
bassist John Wheeler, all original members of the group, will be joined by 
drummer Steve Aschoff, who plays with Eglit in the band of surf guitarist Dick 
Dale. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach-based Gyromatics, whose eclectic sound was once described 
by Elliot as "atomic swing music," released some independent singles and EPs 
but never landed a major record contract. 
</P>
<P>
Eglit said that he thinks the band was "ahead of its time" and that he decided 
to attempt a reunion because "now it's OK" to combine Western swing, roots rock 
and jazz with the anything-goes attitude of '80s punk. RANDY LEWIS

KATHY MATTEA SOARS OFF THE RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While Kathy Mattea's albums are fairly splendid, they offer only a flat sketch 
of the warmth and emotion that went into her Monday show at the Crazy Horse 
Steak House in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Case in point: her rendition of "Come From the Heart." The lyric deals with the 
battle between love and fear: "You've got to sing like you don't need the money 
/ Love like you'll never get hurt / You've got to dance like nobody's watching 
/ It's got to come from the heart if you want it to work." 
</P>
<P>
On her current "Willow in the Wind" album, hampered by a Nashville studio 
gloss, the song doesn't sound as if it's coming from anywhere near the heart. 
On stage, though, the performance blossomed into a real-time embodiment of its 
message, with Mattea's expressive voice soaring through the song. 
</P>
<P>
If k.d. lang's voice is like a thunderstorm in its overwhelming emotion, 
Mattea's is more of a pleasant afternoon. But though it doesn't shatter glass, 
Mattea's moderately powered, deeply shaded voice makes her songs quiver. 
</P>
<P>
Mattea has written only one song that she performs, "Leaving West Virginia," 
and her aching version of it Monday suggests she should rely more heavily on 
her own muse. But she is also fully capable of inhabiting other writers' songs. 
Her 1986 hit of Nanci Griffith's "Love at the Five and Dime" conveyed every 
bump of a couple's rocky road to lasting love. 
</P>
<P>
In the 20-song show her voice illuminated a variety of emotional scenarios, 
from the unbridled romance of "Goin' Gone" to a broken home in "Life as We Knew 
It" to the plight of the homeless in "Quarter Moon." The set also included a 
Western swing number, a version of Bobby Womack's "It's All Over Now," and an a 
cappella logging song on which her high-powered vocal recalled an early Linda 
Ronstadt. JIM WASHBURN

CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE TO GET EQUAL TIME ON KCOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN HERBERT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Riverside County congressional candidate Jeffrey Jacobs will appear on KCOP 
Channel 13's public-affairs program "A.D.I." May 6 as a result of the station 
broadcasting a film last week that featured his competitor, Ralph Waite, 
station manager Rick Feldman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs will be on the 6 a.m. show for 10 minutes, the same amount of time that 
Waite was on-screen for "A Wedding on Walton's Mountain," a 1982 
made-for-television movie that KCOP aired last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal law, television and radio stations must provide equal time to 
opposing candidates whenever a candidate who has qualified for the ballot 
appears on a broadcast outside of bona fine newscasts, interview programs, 
documentaries or spot coverage of news events, provided that the opposing 
candidates request such time within seven days of the broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
Both Jacobs and Waite are seeking the Democratic nomination for the 37th 
Congressional District seat now held by Rep. Al McCandless (R-La Quinta).

'ELECTRIC MONDAY' AT UCLA IS ECLECTIC AND EFFECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For his "Electric Monday" program in Schoenberg Auditorium at UCLA, Roger 
Bourland assembled a diverse group of pieces mixing live performance with 
electronics. The effort proved long on whimsy and sonic color, generally more 
soothing than stretching for both ear and mind. 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece was the West Coast premiere of Bourland's own Portable 
Concerto, for viola and tape. A pair of bumptious moto semi-perpetuo movements 
surrounding an effectively brooding aria of depth as well as surface sheen, it 
is a pert and pretty, thoroughly tonal bit of chamber pop. 
</P>
<P>
Evan Wilson of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the UCLA faculty played it with 
vigorous, crisply accented abandon and generous lyric spirit. Balances favored 
the synthesized tape and the amplification gave a gritty cast to Wilson's 
sound, but the easy joys of the work were readily apparent. 
</P>
<P>
"The Question Mark's Black Ink" by Bill Alves gave equally agreeable and 
pertinent work to pianist Vicki Ray and percussionist Erik Forrester, in a 
structurally and stylistically more diffuse and subtle idiom. It presents a 
poised ensemble sound, the acoustic instruments shadowed by electronic ghosts, 
in a sort of post-minimalist version of English change ringing. 
</P>
<P>
The toughest piece on the agenda, in every sense, was William Kraft's 
"Soliloquy: Encounters I," from 1975. Percussionist Kathryn Dayak handled its 
formidable challenges with concentrated power and point -- albeit a pronounced 
sense of sectional discontinuity -- proving particularly effective in the 
bravura cadenza for muffled vibraphone. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Donadt's "Who Needs a Gazebo?" combined her Nigerian drumming with 
metrically goosed synthesized ostinatos as an accompaniment for five dancers 
from Julie McLeod's Improv, Inc. of Santa Barbara. The dance was a fluid, 
evocative ritual, playing with dangling tassles of Larry Sloan's spare set and 
easily buoyed on Donadt's pulsating waves of sophisticated neo-primitivism. 
</P>
<P>
Donadt's "YooHoo Chorus" and "Holy Cow" seemed like cryptic variations on the 
same theme/joke. Musically both are electronic collages of vocal crys -- 
"yoo-hoo" and "holy cow," of course -- with mime-based movement elaborations 
from Improv, Inc., playing with hats in the former and dark glasses in the 
latter. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Lipkis' "Prophecies" challenged the vocally raw and unblended UCLA 
ElectriChoir with its neo-modal chant-like mysteries, though conductor 
Stephanie Henry shaped the singing carefully. David Crane's explosive little 
shop of electronic horrors, "Cimetiere," completed the program. JOHN HENKEN

ENGAGING PAIRING OF INSTRUMENTS IN MONDAY CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
This is the era of the emerging downtrodden, and no less so among neglected 
instruments than among social minorities, the homeless and the previously 
invisible. 
</P>
<P>
Musically, the underrepresented now seek parity, and a place in the sun. 
Violists are beginning to rise up. No more nice guy, say our friends, the 
piccolo players. 
</P>
<P>
And, this week, the distinctly unlikely duo of Stefano Scodanibbio, a 
contrabassist from Italy, and Harry Sparnaay, a bass clarinet virtuoso from the 
Netherlands, offered a surprisingly varied duo-recital at Monday Evening 
Concerts. 
</P>
<P>
True, the evening began as one feared it might: with gray-sounding, live 
bleeps, bloops and squawks played by the duo. This was Fernando Mencherini's 
inappropriately titled "Playtime II," a dull and directionless essay for the 
pair. 
</P>
<P>
After that, however, interest, color and musical motivation characterized this 
collection of unfamiliar works by Franco Donatoni, Brian Ferneyhough, Salvatore 
Sciarrino, Scodanibbio himself, Paolo Perezzani and Arduino Gottardo. 
</P>
<P>
Except for Gottardo's brief and soothing duet, "Momenti," which closed the 
program, the most fascinating piece may have been Perezzani's "Vocativo" for 
the duo. "Vocativo" offers hostile dialogue and ugly encounters between the 
pair; at half the length of its 14 minutes, it might be more effective. 
</P>
<P>
Solo pieces for each of the instruments held the interest unstrainedly. Equally 
important, Scodanibbio and Sparnaay delivered each of these four works with 
utter commitment and an easy virtuosity. 
</P>
<P>
Donatoni's "Soft" explored much of the dynamic and sound-range of the bass 
clarinet profitably, and articulated its many themes attractively. 
Ferneyhough's "Time and Motion Study I" for bass clarinet became a noisy 
soliloquy, not unlike a diatribe, but sufficiently differing in its expressions 
of self-pity to hold the listener. 
</P>
<P>
For solo bassist, Sciarrino's "Esplorazione del bianco I" proved more 
engrossing than Scodanibbio's "Tre pezzi brillanti," because it stopped short, 
in probing its materials, of exhaustive explorations. 
</P>
<P>
As stage personalities, both performers related smoothly to the affable 
audience in Bing Theater at the County Museum of Art, speaking easily and 
offering insights into the music at hand. 
</P>
<P>
At the next Monday Evening Concert, May 7, Joel Thome conducts music by 
himself, by Dorrance Stalvey and by Husa and Ferneyhough. DANIEL CARIAGA

TRUMPETER DAVID BILGER IN AMBASSADOR RECITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pity the poor trumpet recitalist; his repertory is meager in size as well as 
substance. Trumpeters, if they wish to avoid transcriptions, must rely almost 
exclusively on the second- and third-rate attempts of lesser composers. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a strong advocate can raise this music above its weaknesses. But 
trumpeter David Bilger -- a co-principal in the Dallas Symphony -- revealed no 
such special virtue as a soloist Monday night at Ambassador Auditorium, and 
despite his solid craftsmanship his recital remained steadfastly earthbound. 
</P>
<P>
Best served was the dependable Sonata by Halsey Stevens, a trumpet standard, 
with its Copland harmonies and Stravinsky rhythms. Bilger gave it a relaxed, 
richly toned account. Also enjoyable was the concluding piece on the program, 
Herbert L. Clarke's "The Carnival of Venice," a turn-of-the-century display 
piece which Bilger, performing here on cornet, dispatched with acrobatic ease. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the evening pianist Linda Booth seconded Bilger's efforts, but they 
consistently proved indifferent collaborators, separate musicians just playing 
their parts. 
</P>
<P>
The repetitive, bland Caprice by Joseph Turrin opened the concert followed by 
Georges Enesco's mildly engaging, impressionistic Legende, both in 
straightforward run-throughs. The brash Sonata, Opus 1, by Peter Maxwell Davies 
came off tamely, with Bilger and Booth more concerned with correct execution 
than dramatic statement. Bilger's own transcriptions of two Mahler songs, 
"Fruhlingsmorgen" and "Erinnerung," received mundane readings. 
</P>
<P>
The premiere of Reynoldo Oachoa's "Stills in Black and White," a conservative, 
academic exercise in spacey lyricism, rounded out the program.TIMOTHY MANGAN

PRESIDENT DECIDES AGAINST SANCTIONS IN LITHUANIA CRISIS; 
</P>
<P>
SECESSION: BUSH'S STAND ILLUSTRATES GORBACHEV'S INFLUENCE IN THE WEST. 
REPUBLIC'S LEADER CALLS IT A 'SELLOUT.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush decided Tuesday not to impose sanctions to combat the Soviet 
Union's squeeze on Lithuania, but he said the United States still hopes the 
rebellious republic will achieve self-determination "some day." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's decision reversed signals that his aides had been sending for several 
days that he would act to punish the Soviet government for imposing a virtual 
economic blockade on the republic, which unilaterally declared its independence 
March 11. 
</P>
<P>
The switch came after virtually all U.S. allies and the congressional 
leadership warned him to avoid sanctions that might undermine Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The advice provided a dramatic illustration of how 
thoroughly the leadership of the West has tied its policies to the Soviet 
leader's success. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow greeted Bush's decision triumphantly, while Lithuanian leaders bitterly 
accused the United States of a "sellout." 
</P>
<P>
"This is another Munich," said Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis, 
recalling the appeasement of Adolf Hitler that doomed Czechoslovakian 
independence in 1938 and helped bring on World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Bush insisted the United States understands Lithuania's desire for freedom. 
But, he said during a question-and-answer session with a group of out-of-town 
reporters, "I also am concerned about the freedom of Poland" and other Eastern 
European countries. 
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned that we not inadvertently do something that compels the Soviet 
Union to take action that would set back the whole case of freedom around the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
Landsbergis, speaking from Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, angrily rejected 
that argument. 
</P>
<P>
"Can the freedom of one group of people be sold for the freedom of another?" he 
asked in a statement late Tuesday evening. "What then is the idea of freedom 
itself?" 
</P>
<P>
Soviet state-run television broke into its main evening news program to 
announce Bush's decision. The news program had begun with a report saying U.S. 
sanctions were likely and with a warning by a Foreign Ministry official that 
any such move would hurt U.S.-Soviet relations. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the program, the newscaster read a "late bulletin," triumphantly 
announcing that "Bush declared that he was not prepared to take this action (of 
imposing sanctions) since it would escalate the conflict around Lithuania." 
</P>
<P>
White House aides cautioned that Bush's decision is not final, saying that, for 
now, the President had merely decided not to decide. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to go day by day," said one Administration official. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, however, Tuesday's decision was carefully planned, coming after an 
extensive round of consultations with European leaders and members of Congress 
and a weekend call from Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III. 
</P>
<P>
The decision reflects a strong consensus within the government and among U.S. 
allies that the other issues on the U.S.-Soviet agenda -- arms control, 
reductions in Soviet forces in Eastern Europe, German unification and, above 
all, Gorbachev's overall program of perestroika -- are simply more important 
than Lithuania's desire for immediate freedom. 
</P>
<P>
The paramount interest for Bush and other Western leaders has become keeping 
Gorbachev in power. Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W. Va.), chairman of the Senate 
Appropriations Committee, spoke for many when he warned Tuesday in a Senate 
speech that if Gorbachev fell, he could be replaced by "a new Draconian Darth 
Vader four-star military marshal who will fuel up all the tanks again." 
</P>
<P>
The current attitude could change overnight, congressional leaders warned, if 
the Kremlin does begin a violent crackdown. And even in the absence of such a 
crackdown, some members of Congress are likely to oppose new steps to aid the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd, for example, said in his speech that he "would oppose extending new 
economic benefits and rewards to the Soviet leadership at the same time it is 
starving the Lithuanians of food and fuel." 
</P>
<P>
For now, however, "people realize you wouldn't have the situation in Lithuania 
in the first place if it weren't for perestroika," said a White House aide, 
noting that past Soviet leaders would simply have sent in tanks to crush the 
Lithuanians at the first sign of unrest. Administration officials still hope 
Gorbachev can negotiate a way out of the crisis, and for now "want to give him 
the benefit of the doubt," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
From Bush's standpoint, the risks of action outweigh the dangers of maintaining 
the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a highly complex situation that we're facing, and there's a lot at 
stake," Bush said, adding a comment he attributed to baseball's Yogi Berra: "I 
don't want to make the wrong mistake." 
</P>
<P>
"I think the American people are in support of that approach," Bush said in 
defending his course. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater made the same point, referring 
reporters to opinion polls -- including a recent NBC/Wall St. Journal survey -- 
showing that by 2-to-1 margins, voters say that good relations with Gorbachev 
are more important than freedom for Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
Both abroad and at home, that feeling appears to be unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
"Our allies are not prepared to join in on any sanctions," Rep. Dante Fascell 
(D-Fla.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told reporters after 
11 congressional leaders met with Bush, Baker and other Administration 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
During the congressional meeting, only the ultraconservative Sen. Jesse Helms 
(R-N.C.) urged Bush to take any stronger action. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just an affinity for Gorbachev personally, but for all that has 
happened in the last year or so in the way of change in Eastern Europe and the 
Soviet Union," said a senior Bush adviser. "Acting unwisely has the potential 
to put some very real achievements at risk." 
</P>
<P>
The White House decision came after several days of indications that Bush would 
go the other way. On Friday, Fitzwater had indicated that Bush probably would 
announce sanctions against the Soviets sometime this week. 
</P>
<P>
And, in fact, "the initial intent" after Moscow began its economic embargo on 
Lithuania "was that the time had come to take action," the senior Bush adviser 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, aides consulted with European diplomats and drafted options 
papers for Bush. The go-slow signals from the allies played a major part in 
turning the Administration around, the senior adviser said, noting that when 
sanctions were raised, "the reaction was, shall we say, unenthusiastic." 
</P>
<P>
The allies, the adviser said, can be put into three groups: Those that long ago 
decided to accept the Soviet Union's annexation of Lithuania and the other two 
Baltic republics; those that believe the possible sanctions would not be 
effective in terms of shifting Soviet policy, and those that were concerned the 
situation inside the Soviet Union is so severe that any "major action" by the 
West would produce "a very great negative effect." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev eased Bush's path by having his spokesman on Monday announce new, 
more conciliatory terms for negotiations with Lithuania. The Soviet offer to 
negotiate would allow Lithuania to keep its declaration of independence if it 
suspends for two years actual steps toward independence. 
</P>
<P>
A Lithuanian delegation is in Moscow, and Administration officials continue to 
hope that negotiations will begin, although so far there has been no progress. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night, Bush convened an expanded meeting of the National Security 
Council to discuss his options, but as has been his practice, he revealed his 
decision only to a small group. Several officials left the meeting unclear 
which way Bush had decided to go. At least some Administration officials called 
news organizations to say Bush had decided to impose sanctions, prompting a 
rash of inaccurate stories Monday night and Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Michael Parks, in Moscow, James Gerstenzang, Norman 
Kempster and Michael Ross in Washington, and free-lance journalist Esther 
Schrader, in Vilnius, contributed to this report.

POWERFUL TELESCOPE SOARS INTO SPACE ABOARD SHUTTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The space shuttle Discovery brought a thundering end to years of frustration 
when it blasted off Tuesday to extend human vision to the very edge of the 
universe. 
</P>
<P>
The Discovery roared to a record high orbit of 381 miles, where its crew today 
will ever-so-carefully deploy the Hubble Space Telescope, billed as the finest 
optical instrument ever created, a $1.5-billion scope that is half a billion 
times more powerful than the human eye. 
</P>
<P>
Seven years behind schedule, the telescope will be deployed by astronaut Steven 
Hawley, an astronomer, on a day that many scientists were beginning to doubt 
they would ever see. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been long and frustrating," conceded Edward Weiler, program scientist for 
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, who was visibly shaken by 
the launch. 
</P>
<P>
"Every astronomer," he said softly, "should take today off." 
</P>
<P>
The launch marked the beginning of an era -- some say a revolution -- in the 
exploration of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
"After 12 years," astronomer Eric Chaisson of the Space Telescope Science 
Institute said with a sigh, "it has finally left the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
High above the haze of the Earth's atmosphere, the Hubble is expected to 
produce images 10 times sharper than even the largest telescopes on Earth 
today. The telescope will not get down to serious science until it completes a 
seven-month checkout and engineering period. Then scientists will begin 
studying some of the dimmest and most distant objects in the universe. 
</P>
<P>
After the deployment, engineers at the Goddard Space Flight Center will begin 
the tedious process of activating the telescope. Although scientific images 
that should tell much about the origin and evolution of the universe will not 
be released for several months, there will be a few teasers early on. 
</P>
<P>
In about seven days the Hubble should snap its first picture -- what 
astronomers call "first light" for the telescope -- but it will be primarily an 
engineering exercise and the image is not expected to amount to much. The 
image, of a cluster of stars in the southern sky, will be taken during the 
beginning of the focusing phase, so it may not even be in focus. 
</P>
<P>
But it will still represent a historic moment. 
</P>
<P>
"The stars may be so out of focus they look like doughnuts," said Caltech's 
James Westphal, principal scientist for the telescope's wide field camera. "But 
however it comes out, it's going to be great." 
</P>
<P>
It will mark the moment when humans freed themselves from the fuzzy view from 
Earth and looked to the heavens with absolute clarity. There will be other 
space telescopes in the years ahead, but there will never be another moment 
quite like this. 
</P>
<P>
"Every bit of 12 years was worth it," Weiler said moments after Discovery 
lifted off on a sunny day, pierced a fleecy white cloud and emerged on the 
other side like a spacecraft on a journey to the future. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, some who have worked so hard for so long were forced to miss the launch. 
They were here two weeks ago, but when the launch was delayed because of a 
hydraulic problem they returned to their homes, and many agencies had not 
budgeted for two trips to Cape Canaveral. 
</P>
<P>
Weiler estimated that only about one-third of the people who were here April 10 
made it back for Tuesday's launch. Among the missing were most of the families 
who had accompanied scientists in hopes of seeing this little bit of history. 
</P>
<P>
There was only one small snag in the otherwise perfect launch when a valve 
failed to close automatically, halting the countdown at 31 seconds before 
launch. The valve was ordered by computer to correct its position, and it did 
so, clearing the way for the countdown to resume. 
</P>
<P>
That delayed the launch about four minutes. But at 5:34 a.m. PDT, with Air 
Force Col. Loren J. Shriver, 45, sitting in the commander's seat, the shuttle 
lifted off. 
</P>
<P>
All five members of the crew are veterans of previous flights. This is the 
second flight for Charles F. Bolden Jr., 43, the pilot, and mission specialists 
Bruce McCandless, 52, and Kathryn D. Sullivan, 38. It is the third flight for 
Hawley, 38. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan and McCandless will be partially suited for a spacewalk today just in 
case anything goes wrong during the deployment of the telescope. The most 
anxious moments will come as Hawley gently lifts the 25,000-pound instrument 
out of its tight quarters in the cargo bay. 
</P>
<P>
He will do that with the shuttle's robotic arm, which he tested in the first 
hours of the flight. The arm, however, tends to drift slightly, so he will have 
his hands full keeping the telescope from banging into the sides of the payload 
bay as he lifts it. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers will not breathe freely until the telescope's two giant solar arrays 
are unfurled. The solar arrays keep the telescope's high-tech batteries 
charged, and if they are not fully deployed within six hours after the 
telescope is lifted out of the cargo bay, the batteries will have discharged to 
the point that some instruments in the telescope could be damaged. 
</P>
<P>
So Sullivan and McCandless will be ready to step outside and manually unfurl 
the solar arrays if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
After the telescope is released and functioning on its own, the Discovery will 
back off about 40 miles and shepherd the scope around Earth for two days. If 
anything goes wrong during that period, the shuttle can rendezvous with the 
telescope and McCandless and Sullivan can go out and work on the problem. 
</P>
<P>
If there are no problems, Discovery will land at 6:49 a.m. PDT Sunday at 
Edwards Air Force Base.

TWO OF THE NATION'S MOST INTRACTABLE ILLS ARE CONVERGING. LONG WAITS FOR 
SHELTERS COMPOUND THE PROBLEM.

<P>
There is a man with AIDS who sleeps each night in an abandoned garage in 
Hawthorne. There is another who bunks at a Skid Row hotel -- when he doesn't 
squander his disability check on crack. 
</P>
<P>
There is still another who lived for months in his car before social workers 
managed to squeeze him into a halfway house. And three more who were turned 
away from a Venice mission when workers learned that the three were infected 
with the virus. 
</P>
<P>
As these sad cases illustrate, two of the nation's most intractable ills -- 
AIDS and homelessness -- are converging. Too well to be admitted to hospitals 
or qualify for disability insurance but too sick to hang onto their jobs and 
apartments, a growing number of AIDS patients are being thrust into poverty at 
the same time that the virus continues its deadly march into the ranks of the 
already poor. 
</P>
<P>
By the thousands, they are ending up on the street, or in filthy, crime-ridden 
shelters. Only a lucky few make it into decent shelters or the all-too-scarce 
beds in group homes for people with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
While accurate figures are hard to come by -- AIDS patients drift in and out of 
health and homelessness -- knowledgeable officials estimate that homeless 
people with AIDS number in the tens of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the numbers, the fact is that we are doing distressingly little for 
these people, and the situation is worsening," said Dr. David Rogers, vice 
chairman of the National Commission on AIDS. "It is a national scandal." 
</P>
<P>
The commission on Tuesday issued its second report to President Bush, 
recommending that the federal government create a cabinet-level task force to 
coordinate the national response to the epidemic. It also urged Bush to endorse 
a $600-million "disaster relief" bill that would, among other things, provide 
housing assistance to heavily impacted communities. 
</P>
<P>
"In New York City alone, there are 8,000 to 10,000 homeless people living with 
AIDS," Virginia Shubert, AIDS project director of the National Coalition for 
the Homeless, told a congressional panel last month. AIDS patients are "the 
fastest growing segment of the homeless population in New York," added Peter P. 
Smith, president of the Partnership for the Homeless. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, caseworkers at Minority AIDS Project and AIDS Project 
Los Angeles (APLA) estimate that between 10% and 20% of their clients need 
housing assistance -- a figure they say is climbing as the virus spreads among 
intravenous drug users and the poor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's appalling," said Pam Anderson, who manages residential services for APLA. 
"People are dying in the streets." 
</P>
<P>
But the crisis isn't limited to New York, Los Angeles and other hot spots of 
the epidemic. In Richmond, Va., 12% of the patients at a clinic for the 
homeless were found to be infected with the virus. In Birmingham, Ala., 
"Dolly," a 27-year-old former nursing student, has bounced from hospital to 
shelter to the streets since she was diagnosed with AIDS in March. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the National Commission on AIDS got a harrowing look at the crisis 
last February in New York when they visited a Bowery flophouse and subway 
stations and crannies filled with homeless people. They also toured the Ft. 
Washington armory-turned-homeless shelter. The armory houses 860 men, perhaps 
half of them infected with HIV. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a living hell," recalled commission member Larry Kessler, executive 
director of AIDS Action Committee of Massachusetts. "A lot of the men at the 
shelter were coughing. Others were emaciated or had lesions. Some were 
demented, ranting and raving; others were stooped and shuffling due to 
neurological complications." 
</P>
<P>
From a balcony above the armory floor, Kessler gazed down upon row after row of 
beds. For this weary veteran of the war against AIDS, the sight evoked a 
different rectangular grid symbolizing the plague. 
</P>
<P>
"For a moment, I thought I was looking at the AIDS quilt," he said, referring 
to the ever-growing Names Project quilt whose panels memorialize more than 
10,000 individuals who have died. 
</P>
<P>
As the visits made clear, the AIDS homeless pose a serious challenge to 
overtaxed networks of social services that until now have dealt with AIDS and 
homelessness as separate problems. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to integrate the federal response to AIDS and homelessness, a 
bill currently before Congress would define people with AIDS as "handicapped" 
-- and thus eligible for assistance under existing federal housing programs. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the federal housing assistance programs that currently deny help to 
people with AIDS were created under the McKinney Act. It is one of the crueler 
ironies of the epidemic that the act's author, Rep. Stewart B. McKinney 
(R.-Conn.), died of AIDS in May, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Housing has been a problem since the beginning of the epidemic, but we're 
seeing an escalation of need because there has been an increase in diagnosed 
cases and because people are living longer," said Anne Lewis, spokeswoman for 
the National AIDS Network in Washington.People with AIDS now live an average of 
22 months after diagnosis, compared to 10 months in 1983. But the infections, 
cancers and neurological complications that characterize advanced AIDS can rob 
even relatively well-off patients of their savings and their ability to remain 
productive and independent. 
</P>
<P>
Consider Allan Turner, a 43-year-old AIDS patient who lost his Hollywood 
apartment in August because his $600 monthly disability check was too small to 
cover the $702-a-month rent. Caught up in a legal dispute with his landlady and 
desperately short of cash, Turner found himself on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Two bouts of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia -- one of the opportunistic 
infections associated with AIDS -- had long since rendered Turner incapable of 
holding a full-time job. Still, he said, he refused to take a room at a hospice 
"because I felt hospices were places where you went to die." 
</P>
<P>
He slept for a while on a neighbor's couch, until the neighbor was evicted too. 
For most of the four months it took for Turner to work his way through the APLA 
waiting lists and into a Lawndale shelter, he lived, he said -- and social 
workers confirm -- in the front seat of his 15-year-old Fiat convertible. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know the feeling you get in an earthquake? Totally helpless? Well, 
that's how I felt," Turner said. "You're totally dislodged from everything 
familiar to you. . . . The night before Thanksgiving, I slept in my car. When I 
woke up, I could see people starting their turkeys in their kitchens, and I 
started to cry." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Turner is among the fortunate. Another man with AIDS, a military veteran 
who has spent the last six months sleeping on the floor of an abandoned garage 
near Inglewood Avenue and 120th Street, remains on the waiting list to enter 
the five-bed shelter where Turner now lives. 
</P>
<P>
At work in the housing crisis are a number of factors, social workers say, 
beginning with the official definition of AIDS. Social Security disability 
insurance, the major federal safety net for people with AIDS, is generally 
limited to people whose disabling symptoms fit the official definition of 
full-blown AIDS established by the U. S. Centers for Disease Control. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, social workers say, is that the definition covers only people 
whose systems have succumbed to certain opportunistic infections that, because 
of early medical intervention against HIV, have in recent years become less 
prevalent. 
</P>
<P>
People who are sick but have not yet crossed the threshold of an official AIDS 
diagnosis "can end up waiting six months or more to access public moneys," said 
Anderson of APLA. 
</P>
<P>
Yet such people can be extremely debilitated, "going through the fatigue, the 
ups and downs in their health -- all the things that preclude a person from 
holding down a full-time job," she said. 
</P>
<P>
There are alternatives, Anderson and others say, but they are limited. In Los 
Angeles, Aid for AIDS, a 7-year-old organization financed by private charitable 
contributions, offers grants of up to $2,000 to people with AIDS who earn less 
than $700 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Some people turn to relatives and friends, but those sources of help often have 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an extreme burden for a roommate. You play caretaker an awful lot," said 
Paul Self, executive director of Aid for AIDS. "Often the person with AIDS 
needs home health care or special treatment, and the stress can be so great 
that the other person may not want to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
Nor are families always emotionally equipped to cope with the ravages of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"My family doesn't know about AIDS. All they know is that it's a very dangerous 
and contagious disease," said "Terry," a soft-spoken, 34-year-old transvestite 
whose Mexican immigrant family refuses to touch him for fear of contracting the 
virus. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always wanted to be close to my family, but I guess it just isn't to be," 
he said quietly. "My sister came to see me (in a long-term AIDS residential 
shelter) last week, and she seemed to feel sorry for me, but I didn't try to 
hug or kiss her. I didn't want her to push me away." 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Carnes, senior social worker at the AIDS clinic at Los Angeles County-USC 
Medical Center, said it's not uncommon for AIDS patients to go home to stay 
with their families only to be asked after a few months to leave. 
</P>
<P>
One man on Carnes' caseload, a 20-year-old from East Los Angeles, was allowed 
by his mother to come home after being discharged from the hospital, but only 
as long as he agreed to sleep in the garage and avoid touching anyone or 
anything around the house. 
</P>
<P>
For those who fall through the cracks, including a growing number of AIDS 
patients who were on the streets to begin with, the missions and shelters are 
the last resort. But those, too, are unprepared to house people with AIDS and 
HIV infection, said Marjorie Sa'adah, coordinator of AIDS education for the Los 
Angeles Homeless Health Care Project. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, for example, three men were turned away from the Bible Tabernacle 
shelter in Venice after they indicated on medical forms that they had been 
diagnosed with AIDS. Mona Iwanski, a supervisor at the shelter, said the three 
were driven to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center after two of the men said they needed 
to see a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be very careful when anybody comes in, because we don't have the 
facilities to really separate anyone who has AIDS," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Missions also present health problems, Sa'adah said. They are rife with 
bacteria and contagious diseases to which people with AIDS are easy prey. 
Pneumonia, tuberculosis, scabies and flu are rampant. People sleep dozens -- in 
some cases, hundreds -- to a room. Many shelters close during the day, forcing 
their HIV-infected residents to cope on the street with fevers, exhaustion and 
chronic diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
"People at the missions don't cover their mouths when they cough," complained a 
34-year-old homeless man who learned he was infected with HIV five years ago 
when he tried to sell his plasma. 
</P>
<P>
"There's bedbugs all over the place. I carry my own spoon with me, sterilize it 
with hot water because I believe them plastic spoons attract germs." 
</P>
<P>
The man, a Skid Row crack addict, said he has made more of an effort recently 
to use his monthly disability check for a hotel room before he buys cocaine. 
But he still misses most of his appointments at the County-USC AIDS clinic. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I have an appointment, it's check day," said the man, an ex-convict 
who spoke slowly around a mouthful of infected gums. Sitting alone in a 
$268-a-month, fly-infested hotel room, he alternately dealt himself elaborate 
games of solitaire and fingered the swollen knots on each side of his neck. 
</P>
<P>
"I say I'm going to go down to the clinic, but I wind up getting high," he 
said. "Last time my check came, I got me a room, then I got me a little 
strawberry (a prostitute), and then I got me some cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
The time for his doctor's appointment came and went, he said, while he and the 
prostitute had sexual intercourse -- without a condom and without her knowing 
that he had tested positive for HIV. When the cocaine ran out, he said, he 
turned for solace to his Gideon Bible. 
</P>
<P>
"I figure," he said, "if I live righteously with disease, I won't face eternal 
damnation when I die." 
</P>
<P>
Social workers point to people like that man when they say it is no simple 
matter to care for the homeless who have AIDS. As if the epidemic itself 
weren't serious enough, AIDS caseworkers increasingly are being asked to help 
patients cope with such deep-seated problems as drug addiction, mental illness 
and chronic homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
In some situations, homeless AIDS patients have managed to cadge a bed in a 
hospice by persuading their doctor to sign a prognosis giving them six months 
or less to live. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Weinstein, head of the AIDS Hospice Foundation, estimated that a 
quarter of the people who have come to the Chris Brownlie Hospice since it 
opened near Elysian Park in 1988 have been referred that way. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as the epidemic widens, social workers predict the shortage of 
appropriate housing will only get worse. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to provide shelter to thousands of people with HIV 
infection over the next five years," said Dave Johnson, AIDS coordinator for 
the city of Los Angeles. "And we're going to have to get ready for that."

CRANE INSPECTIONS FIND RAMPANT VIOLATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
INDUSTRIAL SAFETY: CAL/OSHA OFFICIALS DISCOVER VIOLATIONS AT 29 OF THE 38 
PROJECTS WHERE THE HUGE TOWER DEVICES WERE BEING USED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three-quarters of the huge tower cranes at work on dozens of construction 
projects in California in recent months were in violation of state industrial 
safety laws, according to results of a Cal/OSHA inspection released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Cal/OSHA officials and a variety of politicians had put contractors 
on notice by publicizing the inspection program, which began last December and 
ended in February, violations were found at 29 of the 38 projects throughout 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
Violations classified as "serious" -- such as lacking an on-site device capable 
of measuring the crane's load capacity -- were found at 14 of the projects, 
more than a third of those inspected. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the projects in Los Angeles County cited for serious crane violations 
were run by Swinerton and Walberg, a major developer who was in charge of a San 
Francisco project where a crane accident killed five people last November. 
</P>
<P>
Tower cranes are huge cranes used in the erection of tall structures such as 
shopping centers and office towers. 
</P>
<P>
Cal/OSHA -- under fire from organized labor and other advocates of workplace 
safety, who have long criticized the agency as too timid -- began inspecting 
every tower crane in the state after a 240-ton crane collapsed atop the 
Swinerton and Walberg office building project in downtown San Francisco Nov. 
28. In addition to the five deaths, 21 people were injured. The cause of that 
accident still is under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
While results of the crane inspection program were tabulated weeks ago, 
Cal/OSHA did not make the public aware of the data by advising the news media 
that it was available. According to the agency's director, Robert Stranberg, it 
had no plans to do so in the future because the records were available to 
people who wanted to see them. 
</P>
<P>
The information was released Tuesday by Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa 
Monica), chairman of the Assembly Labor and Employment Committee, to publicize 
a hearing by the committee in Sacramento this morning on a crane-safety bill by 
Hayden. 
</P>
<P>
Hayden's bill and several others introduced since the San Francisco accident 
would require more frequent inspections of cranes, licensing of operators and 
an end to a practice of "self-certification" in which the state accepts 
inspections performed by private-sector crane experts -- including those 
employed by crane owners. 
</P>
<P>
Hayden said the results of the Cal/OSHA survey strengthened his contention that 
laws need to be changed. "How many people will have to be killed before we 
improve safety conditions in this industry?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Stranberg has refused to endorse any of the measures and said Tuesday the 
Deukmejian Administration has yet to take a position. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he was surprised by the high percentage of cranes found in 
violation, Stranberg said "an enlightened employer, with all the publicity 
about what we were doing, should have been motivated to make sure his cranes 
were in compliance with our many safety (regulations)." 
</P>
<P>
However, while "those raw numbers do look a little scary, if you look at our 
experiences over the years (with cranes) I don't think you'll find a whole lot 
of problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stranberg said he believed the number of serious violations dropped off as more 
building project managers became aware that Cal/OSHA inspectors were checking 
each crane. However, even in the last month of the program, inspectors found 
eight serious violations on four projects. 
</P>
<P>
One of the two Swinerton and Walberg projects that were cited for serious 
violations is located in Hayden's Assembly district -- on Colorado Boulevard in 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Cal/OSHA inspectors cited the company there for running a crane without limit 
switches that control travel of the crane boom near high-voltage lines. A 
company spokesman said the company is appealing the citation, which carries a 
fine of only $935. He said the warning devices in use were adequate. 
</P>
<P>
At the other Swinerton and Walberg project, in Beverly Hills, the company was 
cited twice for violating requirements for a variety of warning devices that 
tell the crane operator when the crane's load is too heavy. The company is 
appealing the citations, which carry fines of $700. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the five other Los Angeles County projects visited by inspectors were 
cited for crane violations. Two of the five were cited for two serious 
violations each: 
</P>
<P>
At a Hollywood project on South La Cienega Boulevard, inspectors found some 
machinery in unsafe operating condition and no guardrails in above-ground 
walking areas. The contractor paid a $1,055 penalty. 
</P>
<P>
At a project on East Anceleno Boulevard in Burbank, the contractor was cited 
for lacking guardrails and for failing to have equipment tested or maintained. 
Each citation carries a $100 penalty. No appeal has yet been filed. 
</P>
<P>
A separate Cal/OSHA investigation is focusing on apparently counterfeit crane 
certification documents discovered during routine inspections. The documents, 
needed for legal operation, were "amateurish," Stranberg said. "It is difficult 
to understand how owners or operators could have been fooled by them."

UPDATE / HURRICANE HUGO; 
</P>
<P>
IN CHARLESTON, LIFE'S ALMOST NORMAL AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
BUT SEVEN MONTHS LATER, THE DISASTER LEAVES A NEW LEGACY: A CONTINUING MENACE 
OF FOREST FIRES.

<P>
Seven months later, coastal South Carolina almost looks normal. The tourist 
season is underway, and Charleston successfully held its annual tour of elegant 
old homes last week. 
</P>
<P>
For this the region is grateful, because time has moved ever so slowly here 
since Hurricane Hugo roared ashore last September. It is now clear that the 
storm, which killed 29 people and caused $6 billion in damage in this state, 
left a legacy that will last for years. 
</P>
<P>
Most immediately, residents must contemplate the potential for forest fires 
along the coast. There, downed trees decay where Hugo left them. The forest 
fire problem in coastal areas north of here "may well be our greatest danger 
that we still have to face," Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. told a recent news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
Around tiny communities like Mt. Pleasant, Tibwin, Awendaw and McClellanville, 
about 260 million cubic feet of the felled timber has been recovered, but so 
much remains that it would be almost impossible for firefighting equipment to 
move through the woods. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're looking at in the future are fires that are difficult to control," 
said Ken Cabe, fire prevention coordinator for the state forestry commission. 
"It'll be with us for three to five years." 
</P>
<P>
In this city and in the outlying areas as well, rebuilding and repairs are 
still underway. In some communities, neighbors band together to make repairs 
and collect debris. 
</P>
<P>
Charleston officials have high hopes for the tourist season. "Unless you've 
been here enough to know which tree was where, you may not notice the 
destruction," said Barbara Vaughn, public information coordinator for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the city is no longer the prostrated habitat left behind by the 
140-m.p.h. winds that roared directly up Charleston harbor. At the same time, 
troubles remain. 
</P>
<P>
The convention and visitors bureau itself lost a roof during the storm, and now 
is run out of two trailers. The building will not be ready for occupancy until 
the end of May. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners say they still have a hard time getting work done, and even when 
they do, they run into problems with preservation officials who demand that 
replacement materials meet difficult standards. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Brown, a retired teacher who is chronically ill, lost a roof off her 
two-story home near downtown. After months of waiting and hassling with 
insurance officials and contractors, she recently got a new one but was told it 
did not conform to preservation rules. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid having to rip off the new roof, Brown said: "I got to do some tough 
talking and some praying, too." 
</P>
<P>
As repairs are made, another huge problem is created: trash. 
</P>
<P>
Mounds of it sit in front of some homes here, and it litters the countryside. 
State officials said enough garbage has been removed after Hugo to fill 620,000 
trucks. This, of course, drastically shortens the life of garbage dumps, 
exacerbating an already serious problem. 
</P>
<P>
Some trash burning has created smoke hazards severe enough to endanger auto 
traffic, say officials. 
</P>
<P>
In seaside communities along Hugo's path, many homeowners are rebuilding their 
damaged beachfront homes, to the chagrin of environmentalists who saw Hugo as a 
kind of opportunity to stop development that has eroded land and polluted 
water. 
</P>
<P>
"What kind of idiots would want to rebuild their houses at the same place?" 
demands Orrin Pilkey, a Duke University coastal geologist who warns against 
building too close to the sea. "They're foolhardy in the extreme."

ISSUE / DEATH PENALTY; 
</P>
<P>
LITTLE-NOTICED KENNEDY MEASURE MIGHT MEAN END TO EXECUTIONS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
No wonder politicians from coast to coast have been falling all over themselves 
in support of the death penalty: Public opinion polls show that the vast 
majority of the voters support capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
But, if a little-noticed measure now pending in the Senate becomes law, the 
practical effect may be to abolish the death penalty nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
That at least is the opinion of Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh and the top law 
enforcement officials of about two dozen states. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, known as the Racial Justice Act and sponsored by Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy (D-Mass.), was approved 7 to 6 by the Senate Judiciary Committee in 
October. A close vote is expected in the full Senate, probably within weeks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proposal 
</P>
<P>
The bill forbids imposing the death penalty in states in which statistics show 
that a "racially discriminatory pattern" exists in capital punishment cases. 
And the proposal would invalidate the death penalty whether the "racial" 
pattern involved a defendant directly or some other aspect of capital cases. 
</P>
<P>
The latter is significant because statistical analyses of capital punishment 
have consistently yielded the same result: Those who murder whites are more 
likely to get a death sentence than those who murder blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Strangely enough, the race of the murderer is not as clearly significant 
nationwide as the race of the victim. For the nation as a whole, a General 
Accounting Office study said, only "equivocal" evidence was found that the race 
of the offender had a strong effect on the imposition of the death penalty. 
There was, however, some evidence suggesting that, in some states, blacks are 
more likely to receive the death penalty than whites. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed law's terms, a Death Row inmate could cite racial data in 
death penalty cases as a reason for having his sentence invalidated. It would 
then be up to the state to convince a federal judge through "clear and 
convincing evidence (that) pertinent non-racial factors" explain the 
statistical disparity. 
</P>
<P>
The committee report gave these examples: 
</P>
<P>
If death penalties were imposed on black persons convicted of capital crimes 
far more frequently than on whites convicted of the same crimes, a racially 
discriminatory pattern would be presumed and prosecutors would have to 
demonstrate that non-racial factors accounted for the difference. 
</P>
<P>
Equally, the committee report said, if evidence shows that 15% of all 
defendants charged with killing white persons receive the death penalty and 
only 1% of all defendants charged with killing black persons received the death 
penalty, then a discriminatory pattern would be presumed. It would be up to 
prosecutors to offer proof that non-racial factors were involved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposing Forces 
</P>
<P>
State officials contend that they cannot meet such a test. It "would have the 
practical effect of abolishing capital punishment," Thornburgh and 23 state 
attorneys general said recently in letters to members of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
California Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, in a March 15 letter to the Senate, 
also opposed the Kennedy bill, saying that it "will effectively preclude any 
state from enforcing its capital punishment statutes." 
</P>
<P>
In a sharply worded response, civil rights leaders said they were "outraged by 
the cavalier attitude" expressed by the state attorneys general. The measure is 
"designed to expose and eliminate racial bias in the application of the death 
penalty, not to eliminate the death penalty," they said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm shocked by their willingness to tolerate discrimination in the way that 
our criminal justice system metes out the most severe punishment," said Julius 
L. Chambers, director of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Among those supporting the bill are the American Bar Assn. and the Leadership 
Conference on Civil Rights. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Background 
</P>
<P>
The Kennedy measure is an attempt to overturn a 1987 Supreme Court ruling that 
upheld Georgia's capital punishment system, despite an exhaustive study which 
found that killers of whites in the state were four times as likely to get the 
death sentence as were killers of blacks. 
</P>
<P>
The court, on a 5-4 vote, concluded that the murderer in question -- a black 
man who shot a white policeman -- had received due process of law and a fair 
trial. Statistics based on other cases were irrelevant, the justices said, 
opening the way for a potential execution. 
</P>
<P>
The original Kennedy measure has been incorporated into a broader Senate bill 
whose purpose is to re-establish the death penalty for federal crimes, 
including espionage, destruction of an airplane and the murder of a U.S. 
official.

ISRAEL SETS CONDITIONS FOR ITS ROLE IN ANY HOSTAGE DEAL;

DIPLOMACY: ISRAELI PRISONERS CAPTURED IN LEBANON MUST ALSO BE SET FREE,

Israeli officials reacted with reserve Tuesday to the anticipated release of 
Western hostages held by Muslim extremists and said that for Israel to be part 
of any deal, Israeli prisoners held in Lebanon must also be set free. 
</P>
<P>
The comments came amid widespread reports that Israel will release captives it 
holds in a south Lebanon prison as a payoff for the release of American hostage 
Robert Polhill or as a gesture to help secure the release of more foreign 
hostages held by Shiite Muslim groups in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
In past years, Israel has freed a limited number of Muslim prisoners from the 
Khiam Prison as a goodwill gesture for the Muslim Eid al Fitr feast. Eid al 
Fitr is the last day of Islam's annual month of fasting called Ramadan, which 
ends this week. Khiam Prison is inside a buffer zone controlled by Israeli 
troops and a client Lebanese militia, the South Lebanon Army. 
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, the Lebanese newspaper An Nahar said that the groups holding the 
foreign hostages would not release more of them until Israel releases prisoners 
from Khiam. 
</P>
<P>
In Damascus, the Syrian Foreign Ministry said it is still working in high gear 
to negotiate the release of a second hostage, although prospects for immediate 
results were uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be another hostage release," a Syrian government official said. "I 
can't tell you when. Maybe a day, maybe a week." 
</P>
<P>
"I think the atmosphere is still very positive, very optimistic," said one 
source close to the negotiations, pointing to the prediction this week by 
Hussein Moussawi, a leading pro-Iranian Shiite cleric, that a second hostage 
release "is in the cards." 
</P>
<P>
Moussawi heads the Islamic Amal wing of Hezbollah (Party of God), a pro-Iranian 
Shiite organization that is believed to be the parent movement of several 
Shiite groups holding foreign hostages in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
But other sources said there have been no official notifications that the 
release of a second hostage is imminent, nor any indication of what the 
nationality of any additional hostage to be released might be. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation Tuesday centered on Irish or Swiss hostages. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati met for 40 minutes 
with his Irish counterpart, Gerard Collins, and said: "There are some hopes 
that the hostage from Ireland will be released." He did not say when. 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to Brian Keenan, a teacher at the American University of 
Beirut when he was seized April 11, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
And in the southern Lebanese port of Sidon, Mustafa Saad, leader of the 
pro-Syrian Sunni Muslim Popular Liberation Army that controls the port, told 
reporters: "We're in contact with several parties concerned to ensure the 
speedy release of the Swiss captives," a reference to Swiss Red Cross workers 
Emmanuel Christen, 33, and Elio Erriquez, 24, kidnaped by unidentified gunmen 
last Oct. 6. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Bush Administration continues to be cautious about the 
prospects of another early hostage release. Asked if there were any new 
indications to back up speculation of freedom for the second of the seven 
remaining Americans held in Lebanon, White House Press Secretary Marlin 
Fitzwater said, "I think the most honest answer at this point has to be no, 
although there are some encouraging rumblings." 
</P>
<P>
The most optimistic indications of progress Tuesday came from Israel. 
</P>
<P>
An Israeli Foreign Ministry official in Jerusalem said: "We are willing to 
trade prisoners of war for prisoners of war we hold. If also such an act would 
contribute to the release of hostages, we would welcome it." 
</P>
<P>
The official hinted that a release of prisoners from Khiam Prison might be 
possible by describing the detainees there as "prisoners of war" and not 
"terrorists." The freeing of prisoners dubbed "terrorist" is controversial in 
Israel because it is felt that many Palestinians who were released during the 
1980s in a prisoner swap became core leaders of the current Arab uprising in 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The release of Lebanese guerrillas who have 
fought Israel and its Lebanese militia would not present such a problem, he 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli Television reported late Tuesday that four prisoners were freed from 
Khiam Prison by the South Lebanese Army. The report said the four were from 
south Lebanon and were not involved in guerrilla attacks. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, Israel is trying to retrieve two soldiers and an air force 
navigator of its own captured by Shiite Muslim militias in southern Lebanon. 
Last July 28, Israeli commandoes abducted Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, a Muslim 
cleric, from his home in Lebanon in hopes of trading him for the Israeli POWs. 
Obeid is still being held inside Israel. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Bush Administration continued to reject any possibility of a 
deal for the freedom of the seven remaining American hostages. But U.S. 
officials said that did not preclude Israel or any other party from making 
moves that might facilitate further releases. 
</P>
<P>
The attraction for the United States of having another party intervene is that 
it does not involve any concessions from the Bush Administration. A U.S. 
official noted Tuesday that Washington has no control over Israel's foreign 
policy or actions.

PRO-ISRAEL U.S. LOBBY CRITICIZES SECRET AID FOR JERUSALEM HOUSING

The head of the leading pro-Israel lobby in Washington has criticized the 
Israeli government's secret financing of Jewish housing in the Christian sector 
of Jerusalem, it was disclosed Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas A. Dine, executive director of the American Israel Public Affairs 
Committee (AIPAC), questioned the timing of the move into the Christian quarter 
of East Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Dine delivered his criticism to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir through 
an emissary. 
</P>
<P>
He told Shamir the Israeli government is "doing great harm" to Israel's 
standing with the Bush Administration and the American public, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Although American Jewish groups frequently disagree on a wide range of issues, 
it is unusual for AIPAC objections to Israeli government action to be reported 
publicly. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department on Monday sharply criticized the Israeli government for 
financing the purchase of a sublease on a hospice owned by a Greek Orthodox 
church to be rented to new Soviet Jewish immigrants. Two weeks ago, about 150 
Jews moved onto the site. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli courts have ordered the Jews evicted, a decision the Bush 
Administration has welcomed. 
</P>
<P>
Dine called the move to buy a sublease on the hospice "a provocation," said the 
sources, who provided information about Dine's statements only on condition 
that they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Dine's assertion paralleled the State Department's description of the purchase 
as "an insensitive and provocative action."

SANDINISTA GENERAL MAY BE CHAMORRO'S ARMY CHIEF;

NICARAGUA: THE REPORTED CHOICE OF HUMBERTO ORTEGA COULD PROVOKE A SPLIT IN HER

<TEXT>
<P>
President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro is expected to announce in her 
inaugural address today that she will name the Sandinista defense minister, 
Gen. Humberto Ortega, to a top position in the country's military. 
</P>
<P>
The Baltimore Sun, quoting a Sandinista Foreign Ministry official and a senior 
editor of Chamorro's La Prensa newspaper, said Chamorro will assume the post of 
defense minister upon becoming president and will name Ortega as chief of 
staff, the second-highest military position. Gen. Ortega is the brother of 
Sandinista President Daniel Ortega, defeated by Chamorro in the Feb. 25 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
La Prensa Editor Horacio Ruiz said that the appointment will be temporary, 
perhaps for six months, and is aimed at guaranteeing a peaceful transition. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Foreign Ministry official and Ruiz said Chamorro decided to keep Gen. 
Ortega to forestall a series of strikes by pro-Sandinista unions and possible 
insubordination in the Sandinista-dominated army. 
</P>
<P>
But keeping him as army commander likely will heighten divisions inside 
Chamorro's ruling coalition and could threaten an agreement with the 
U.S.-backed Contras, who have promised to disarm by June 10, ending nine years 
of civil war. 
</P>
<P>
The Contras and members of her coalition have demanded that Sandinista 
loyalists be purged from the army. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some extremists who want the Sandinistas wiped out in one fell 
swoop," a source close to Chamorro told the Associated Press, describing some 
factions in the National Opposition Union (UNO). "That can't be. He (Ortega) 
will be eased out but not for a while." 
</P>
<P>
UNO's political council, headed by Vice President-elect Virgilio Godoy, alluded 
to the appointment in a communique Tuesday that said the council "would not 
support such a decision, nor would it be responsible for its consequences." 
</P>
<P>
The ruling National Sandinista Liberation Front announced Monday that the 
military and police could no longer hold posts in the party, thus theoretically 
removing party control from the Defense and Interior ministries. 
</P>
<P>
But the Godoy faction has been complaining that men such as Humberto Ortega can 
remain party members, even though they no longer occupy party posts, and that 
the party will remain in control. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 senior military and police officials have been forced to resign, 
including Ortega, who was one of the nine members of the party's ruling 
directorate, the Foreign Ministry source said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was essential that Mrs. Chamorro show the Sandinistas and the army 
that she is serious about reconciliation. Besides, Ortega is a man who can keep 
the army in line," said the official, a senior member of the Sandinista party. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all army officers above the rank of captain and key officers in the 
Interior Ministry are members of the Sandinista party. 
</P>
<P>
UNO faces a test of unity in the National Assembly while Cabinet appointees, 
due to be sworn in shortly after Chamorro's inauguration, have yet to be 
officially announced. 
</P>
<P>
The first test came Tuesday afternoon, when the new National Assembly met to 
elect a president. UNO's official choice is Myriam Arguello, a 64-year-old 
lawyer from the People's Conservative Alliance, one of 14 parties in the UNO 
coalition. Arguello earlier received 28 votes at a caucus of UNO's 51 deputies, 
to 23 for Chamorro adviser Alfredo Cesar, a former member of the Contras' 
directorate and a man with his sights set on running for president in the 1996 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
Arguello is backed by Godoy, and the Sandinistas have hinted that their 39 
deputies might vote for Cesar to encourage a split in UNO ranks, even though 
Cesar is not a Sandinista favorite because of his Contra connections.

President Bush will invoke emergency authority to send $2.6 million in medical 
aid to Nicaragua in time for today's inauguration of Violeta Barrios de 
Chamorro as president, congressional and Administration aides said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The move is timed to give Vice President Dan Quayle the chance to deliver good 
news when he represents Bush at the swearing-in ceremony in Managua, sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's request for $300 million to begin economic recovery in Nicaragua had 
been stalled on Capitol Hill by a dispute over unrelated legislation. That 
snarl was resolved late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The stopgap medical aid is being provided under a little-used section of the 
foreign assistance law that permits the President to use up to $10 million a 
year for "any emergency purposes."

California environmentalist John Francis, who has shunned the use of 
automobiles for nearly 20 years, was struck and injured by one as he bicycled 
across town on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Francis stuck with his avoidance of motor vehicles and refused to board an 
ambulance summoned by passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
After confused paramedics secured his injured left arm and shoulder with a 
sling, he cautiously walked about 15 blocks to the emergency room at Howard 
University Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors there said he had no broken bones, but was suffering from strained 
ligaments in his back and left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old activist grabbed nationwide attention last weekend when he 
spoke on Earth Day, breaking the silence he had kept since 1973 as part of his 
personal environmental crusade. 
</P>
<P>
Washington police said they ticketed Ruth Dial, the driver of the car that 
struck Francis, for failing to yield the right-of-way. She allegedly cut in 
front of Francis, sending him hurtling into her car and onto the pavement.

EXXON REFUSES TO FUND MORE SPILL STUDIES, PANEL IS TOLD 
</P>

Exxon is refusing a government request for $20 million toward the cost of 
assessing damage from its massive oil spill in Alaska's Prince William Sound 
last year, a House subcommittee was told Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Studies of the long-term effects from the 1989 spill of 11 million gallons of 
crude oil into the pristine waters of Prince William Sound cost $35 million 
last year. Shortly after the spill by the tanker Exxon Valdez, the oil company 
put up $15 million. Last January, trustees in charge of the continuing 
assessment asked for the remaining $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
With continuing studies expected to cost another $30 million this year, the 
company is refusing the request to pay last year's balance on grounds that it 
hasn't been given results of the federal and state studies or an accounting of 
how its first $15 million was spent. 
</P>
<P>
"The process has not worked as Exxon anticipated," C. M. Harrison, its 
executive vice president, told the House subcommittee on water, power, and 
offshore energy resources. He said the interagency trustees told Exxon that 
government attorneys are "restricting the flow of information and data and are 
advising the trustees and agencies not to work cooperatively with Exxon." 
</P>
<P>
Government officials in return complain that Exxon has refused to share its 
research data with state and federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Heading into the second year of a cleanup that has already cost it more than $1 
billion, the company is under a federal criminal indictment that could bring 
fines totaling $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
So far more than 1,000 sea otters, 35,000 waterfowl, 150 bald eagles, and other 
animals from deer to whales are known to have died as a result of oil fouling 
the sound and hundreds of miles of its shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
But environmentalists insisted that the real impact is still unknown. 
</P>
<P>
"These carcasses represent only the most obvious impacts of the spill," Erik D. 
Olson of the National Wildlife Federation told the subcommittee. "They are only 
the tip of the iceberg. 
</P>
<P>
"The more subtle and insidious impacts are more difficult and expensive to 
measure than the collection of otter and bird carcasses. The entire food web of 
the affected areas of Prince William Sound, Kenai Peninsula, Kodiak Island, and 
many bays and estuaries along the Alaska Peninsula have been seriously 
disrupted." 
</P>
<P>
Exxon voluntarily put up the first $15 million. But Interior Secretary Manuel 
Lujan Jr. characterized that as a first step and put Exxon on notice that 
further payment would be expected. A spokesman for Lujan said Tuesday the 
Interior Department would hold the company responsible for continuing to 
finance the damage assessment and will go to court if necessary to collect 
additional payments. 
</P>
<P>
However, notes of a March meeting of the panel of trustees responsible for the 
assessment showed that the Justice Department advised the panel it "should not 
expect further money from Exxon." 
</P>
<P>
The notes also showed that Justice Department officials considered a proposed 
settlement agreed to by Exxon, but vetoed by Alaska, "a very good offer." Under 
that proposal, which was never implemented, Exxon would have paid up to $500 
million in fines to avoid criminal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
The trustees panel is composed of Lujan, Agriculture Secretary Clayton L. 
Yeutter, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief John A. Knauss, 
and Alaska Fish and Game Commissioner Don W. Collingsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the problem of Exxon's refusal to provide additional payments for 
the studies is the fact that the Bush Administration included no funds for this 
year's work in its fiscal 1991 budget. Officials of the Interior and 
Agriculture departments and NOAA said they will "re-program" funds from other 
activities to support studies planned for the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of environmental organizations testifying at the hearing 
Tuesday expressed concern that the trustees have agreed to discontinue 24 of 63 
studies initiated in the spill area last year. With Exxon balking and no 
Administration funds targeted for the continuing assessment, they urged 
Congress to step in with an appropriation to assure that investigations 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
"Congress should immediately mandate and appropriate sufficient funds to pay 
for the next two years of damage studies," Olson told the panel. "This will 
guarantee that critical data are not lost and that the spillers are held 
responsible for the full extent of damages." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), the subcommittee chairman, several times 
expressed concern that the litigation growing from the disaster has now taken 
precedence over the damage assessment and the recovery of the environment of 
the sound. He said scientific information is being withheld for use in the 
criminal and civil proceedings in court. 
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned," he said, "that litigation is beginning to overwhelm the 
public interest."

VOTERS OK BUSINESS PARK NEAR RACE TRACK

City voters Tuesday overwhelmingly approved plans to develop a 75-acre business 
park next to the Los Alamitos Race Track, ending more than four years of 
disputes and lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
"This election finally puts to rest a great controversy in our community," said 
Mayor Pro Tem John Kanel. "The new owners (of the race track) are to be highly 
commended." 
</P>
<P>
Approval of Tuesday's ballot measure allows the rezoning of 75 acres next to 
the track for the development of the Cypress Business and Professional Center, 
which will include office buildings and a motel. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, a group of Sacramento businessmen led by Lloyd Arnold bought 
the 298-acre property for $71 million from Hollywood Park Realty Enterprises. 
They have gained the support of a citizens group and local officials during 
months of talks. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's election put to rest more than four years of disputes involving the 
race course. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Hollywood Park Realty asked the City Council to rezone the land for 
another business development, Cypress Plaza. The council approved the zone 
change. However, facing mounting citizen opposition, the council reversed the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, a coalition of Cypress residents won voter approval of Measure D, 
which returned the race track parcel to semipublic use. Measure D also mandated 
voter approval of further zoning changes. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Park sued the city over Measure D. Later, an Orange County Superior 
Court judge invalidated the measure. The city appealed. 
</P>
<P>
The owners were thwarted once again in their effort to develop the property in 
1989 when residents overwhelmingly rejected Cypress Downs, a 167-acre 
development proposal. Hollywood Park then proceeded with its $125-million 
lawsuit against the city. 
</P>
<P>
With the approval of the rezoning, Arnold plans to put the 75 acres up for 
sale. He has already spent more than $3 million refurbishing the race track and 
an adjacent golf course.

Price-Fixing Issue 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 235 to 157, the House sent to the Senate a bill to help plaintiffs 
win lawsuits against vertical price-fixing, which occurs when manufacturers 
seek to enforce a minimum product price. The bill (HR 1236) eases Supreme 
Court-set standards of evidence that make it easy for judges to dismiss such 
suits. It gives plaintiffs a better chance of advancing their case to a jury. 
</P>
<P>
The bill is backed by discounters such as Burlington Coat Factory and K mart 
and opposed by business groups such as the Chamber of Commerce and National 
Assn. of Manufacturers, according to floor debate. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Dan Glickman (D-Kan.) urged colleagues to "vote for your constituents 
who can't afford to shop at full-price retailers." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent G. V. (Sonny) Montgomery (D-Miss.) said the bill's defeat would 
"preserve the freedom of manufacturers . . . to determine how their products 
are marketed and serviced." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

Substitute Bill 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 155 to 242, the House rejected a substitute version of the bill 
(above) to combat vertical price-fixing. The amendment sought to preserve 
exacting standards of evidence that plaintiffs, such as discounters suing 
manufacturers, must satisfy under 1984 and 1988 Supreme Court rulings. It also 
attempted to codify the 1911 court ruling that vertical price-fixing is 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Chuck Douglas (R-N.H.) said Congress should "not fool around with 
Supreme Court decisions" that have evolved over the decades. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Lawrence J. (Larry) Smith (D-Fla.) said the amendment "would kill this 
bill." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the substitute.

Standards of Evidence 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 192 to 204, the House rejected an amendment to HR 1236 (above) 
toughening the standards of evidence in vertical price-fixing cases. This 
retained the bill's objective of making it easier for plaintiffs to avoid 
dismissal by a judge, and gain a jury trial, of their suits accusing 
manufacturers and distributors of conspiring against them because of their low 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters said the amendment would protect manufacturers who cut off discount 
dealers for reasons other than pricing policies. Foes said antitrust policy is 
best served when vertical price-fixing cases are decided by juries. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to make it easier for judges to dismiss vertical 
price-fixing cases for lack of evidence.

Henry Fernandez, a senior left-hander, threw a six-inning no-hitter, allowing 
just two runners to reach first base, as Crescenta Valley High defeated host 
Pasadena, 8-0, in a Pacific League baseball game Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez (4-0) struck out eight and walked none. Pasadena Coach Bob Berans was 
thrown out of the game for arguing with the home-plate umpire in the sixth. 
Pasadena ultimately was forced to forfeit the game after Berans refused to 
leave the premises. 
</P>
<P>
"He walked outside his dugout but would not leave the area," base umpire Randy 
Hines said. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Berger homered to pace Crescenta Valley (10-8, 7-3).

A 15-month-old girl was found unharmed today, about 12 hours after her mother's 
car was stolen outside their home with the toddler in the front seat, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Erica Jackson was still inside the car when it was located in a Hyde Park 
neighborhood. The car had been abandoned a short distance from where it was 
stolen Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The girl was unharmed when officers found her in the car, parked at 6308 10th 
Ave., Sgt. Greg Glodery said. 
</P>
<P>
The car was stolen from the 2700 block of West 73rd Street, just blocks from 
10th Avenue, about 9 p.m. when the girl's mother left the child in the auto and 
the engine running while she went back into their house.

CHAMORRO SWORN IN AS NICARAGUA'S PRESIDENT BEFORE CHEERING CROWD

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Violeta Chamorro, the newspaper publisher whose U.S.-backed alliance ended 10 
years of leftist rule, was sworn in as president of Nicaragua today before 
foreign dignitaries and cheering supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Outgoing President Daniel Ortega, who helped lead the Sandinista revolution, 
placed the presidential sash on Chamorro at an open-air baseball stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The frail Chamorro defeated Ortega in February with 55% of the vote and since 
has been embroiled in a series of controversies surrounding the transition of 
power. 
</P>
<P>
The latest dispute involved the 100,000-member army, the largest in Central 
America. Sources within Chamorro's National Opposition Union said before the 
inauguration that she had decided to retain Gen. Humberto Ortega as head of 
army -- a decision sure to ruffle some of her supporters. 
</P>
<P>
There was no official announcement, however, regarding Gen. Ortega, who is 
Daniel Ortega's older brother and was his defense minister. 
</P>
<P>
The inauguration ended 10 years of rule by the leftist Sandinista party that 
overthrew dictator Anastasio Somoza, the ruler whose supporters murdered 
Chamorro's husband in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
The new 60-year-old president served briefly in the Sandinista government after 
the 1979 revolution but soon withdrew to spend her energy running La Prensa, 
the opposition newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony began in an atmosphere of festivity, as supporters of both the 
outgoing Sandinista government and Chamorro arrived wearing T-shirts and 
carrying flags in the colors of their parties. 
</P>
<P>
Security was tight at the stadium where police formed security rings inside and 
outside the walls. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 heads of state, former heads of state and politicians from around the 
world were driven into the stadium and took their seats to the cheers of the 
crowd in the stadium, which holds about 20,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle was cheered and booed as he left his limousine to 
take his seat at the ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle, who led a 30-member U.S. delegation to Chamorro's inauguration, was the 
highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Nicaragua in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, President Bush ordered $2.5 million in emergency medical 
assistance to Nicaragua and ended limits on sugar purchases, the final U.S. 
economic sanction. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the United States -- which armed 
the Contra rebels and imposed a range of sanctions against the Sandinista 
government -- will do all it can to help the new government. 
</P>
<P>
UNO hard-liners and still-armed Contra rebels in northern Nicaragua have 
insisted that Gen. Ortega, 44, be removed not only from his post as defense 
minister but also as head of the army, the most powerful in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
An UNO statement Tuesday said Chamorro would lose support from the alliance if 
she allowed Ortega to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Other Chamorro aides argued that Gen. Ortega could be instrumental in a stable 
transition while Contra rebels begin disarming under terms of an accord signed 
in March. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement hammered out by Chamorro, the Contras and the incoming 
Chamorro government, the rebels will begin disarming today and be completely 
demobilized by June 10.

FREED SOLAR PANEL AVERTS SPACE WALK

The Discovery astronauts triumphantly launched the $1.5-billion Hubble Space 
Telescope one orbit late today after last-ditch commands from Earth freed a 
stuck solar panel, narrowly averting a daring emergency spacewalk. 
</P>
<P>
The telescope began orbiting Earth every 97.3 minutes at an altitude of 380 
miles -- high above the atmosphere, which has limited the view of ground-based 
telescopes. 
</P>
<P>
"Discovery, go for Hubble release," Mission Control told the crew at 12:37 p.m. 
PDT. The event occurred a minute later as the shuttle slowly and carefully 
backed away as the telescope, glinting in the sunlight, drifted off on its 
15-year search for new worlds. 
</P>
<P>
The final hours before its release were a nightmare for ground controllers as 
they commanded the unfurling of two solar panels that power the telescope's 
instruments. 
</P>
<P>
The starboard panel balked twice as it was being pulled from its reel. Mission 
Control ordered spacewalking astronauts to be ready to go out of the cabin to 
help. But there was a third try, and it was successful. 
</P>
<P>
"We have confirmation that the solar array wing on the starboard side has been 
deployed," the telescope control center in Maryland said. 
</P>
<P>
"So we have good news," said Dave Drachlis of the Hubble control center. 
</P>
<P>
The deployment of the two 39-foot panels allowed sun power to flow into the 
telescope's batteries, relieving worries that they would use up their 
eight-hour charge. 
</P>
<P>
Before astronaut Steve Hawley was able to lift the 12 1/2-ton telescope from 
the cargo bay with the shuttle's mechanical arm, its instruments had to be 
disconnected from the shuttle's power and shifted over to the batteries. 
</P>
<P>
Astronauts Kathryn Sullivan and Bruce McCandless had put on spacesuits and 
entered an air lock in order to be ready to walk outside and pull out the array 
in case mechanical deployment of the solar panels failed. 
</P>
<P>
The first solar array unreeled from its mast at midday as the shuttle passed 
380 miles above South America's eastern coast. It started providing power to 
the telescope's batteries, which otherwise had only eight hours of charge. 
</P>
<P>
Deployment of the starboard panel, however, was more troublesome. It refused to 
budge when latches were first released, then moved about a fifth of its 39-foot 
length and stopped again. A third attempt rolled the panel out all the way. 
</P>
<P>
"Houston, we see motion," Commander Loren J. Shriver reported. 
</P>
<P>
Hawley began the long process of releasing Hubble shortly after 4 a.m. PDT when 
he grasped the Hubble with Discovery's 50-foot-long mechanical arm and 
carefully hoisted the 12 1/2-ton telescope high above the shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery was 380 miles above Earth, 70 miles higher than any shuttle has ever 
flown. The orbit was dictated by the need to put the telescope above the 
Earth's distorting atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery's five astronauts were awed by the view. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to pass on the quote of the day from the on-board astronomer -- 
something to the effect that the big marble (Earth) sure looks far away today," 
Shriver said of Hawley.

GM PLANS PRODUCTION SHIFT FOR VAN NUYS 'FLEX PLANT'

General Motors Corp. is expected to move production of its sporty Camaro and 
Firebird cars to Canada from California, clearing the way for a new kind of GM 
factory in the Los Angeles area, a company official said today. 
</P>
<P>
A news conference was set for this afternoon in Ste. Therese, Quebec, where 
GM's Canadian subsidiary now makes the Chevrolet Lumina coupe and sedan and 
Oldsmobile Ciera car. 
</P>
<P>
GM spokeswoman Kathy Tanner said in Detroit that the company is expected to 
announce that production of a new Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird, called 
F-cars, will be moved to the Canadian plant from GM's plant in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
"The Van Nuys facility will continue to produce the current F-car, and the 
timetable for the introduction of the next generation hasn't been established," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the shift will take place in time for the Ste. Therese 
plant to begin making Camaros and Firebirds in 1992 for the 1993 model year. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of Camaros and Firebirds this year through April 20 were down 35% and 
39.6%, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 3,500 employees at the Ste. Therese plant and about 3,800 at 
the Van Nuys factory. It was unclear this morning how the production shift 
would affect employment at the two plants. 
</P>
<P>
It was also unclear if Ste. Therese would continue making its current products, 
which are substantially different than the current version of the Camaro and 
Firebird. 
</P>
<P>
In place of the Camaro and Firebird, GM hopes to establish a "flex plant" at 
Van Nuys, Tanner said. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a facility capable of assembling a number of various models that 
would allow us to respond more quickly to the Western market," she said. She 
declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Small, sporty cars and sport-utility vehicles are popular in the West, 
especially in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
A final decision on altering the Van Nuys plant hasn't been made, she said, but 
she added that backers of the plan were encouraged greatly that it would be 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
"We are optimistic that we can develop the business case for the Van Nuys 
plant," Tanner said.

The Food and Drug Administration will consider applications for AIDS home test 
kits that would enable people to send a small blood sample to a laboratory and 
get the results by telephone, a spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
The agency has accepted one application and has sent letters to 30 other 
companies that are developing test kits or have expressed interest in doing so, 
said FDA spokesman Brad Stone. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the FDA has refused to accept home test kit applications because of 
technical concerns, such as how well people could be instructed with written 
material to draw their own blood and whether samples could be shipped safely 
through the mail. 
</P>
<P>
The agency also worried about how people using the tests would be counseled 
about the disease.

The sudden resignation and disappearance of American University President 
Richard Berendzen came after police traced a series of obscene phone calls to 
his private office phone, reports said today. 
</P>
<P>
Berendzen, who quit April 10 after 10 years on the job, was asked to step down 
because of allegations surrounding "personal actions," said Edward Carr, 
chairman of the university's board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Horan Jr., a prosecutor in Fairfax County, Va., said Tuesday that police 
are "looking into certain complaints" against Berendzen. 
</P>
<P>
WUSA-TV reported that obscene telephone calls allegedly began after a woman 
placed an ad in the Washington Post saying she would take children into her 
home for day-care. Police then launched an investigation and put a tap on the 
woman's telephone. A series of calls were then allegedly traced to Berendzen's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
"On April 6, 1990, I first became aware of allegations of improper behavior by 
Dr. Berendzen," Carr said in his statement. "I want to emphasize that these 
allegations concerned personal actions of Dr. Berendzen and were in no way 
related to his role as president of the university." 
</P>
<P>
Carr had said on April 10 that he was unaware of reasons behind what was then 
presented to the public as Berendzen's unforced resignation. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite the private nature of Berendzen's problems, it was concluded that his 
resignation would be in the best interest of the university so that the 
university did not become involved in their resolution," Carr's statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore said today that Berendzen is a patient 
there. The hospital runs a well-known sexual disorders clinic but a spokesman 
refused to say whether Berendzen was being treated in that unit. 
</P>
<P>
Berendzen, 51, said in a statement April 10 that he was stepping down because 
of exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
He is an astronomer who received his undergraduate degree in 1961 from the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He received a masters degree from 
Harvard University in 1967 and a Ph.D. in 1969. He taught at Harvard and Boston 
University until 1974, when he became dean of American University's College of 
Arts and Sciences.

U.S. HOSTAGE STEEN BRIEFLY ESCAPED IN 1987, POLHILL REPORTS

American hostage Alann Steen briefly escaped his Lebanese kidnapers in 1987 and 
was seriously ill shortly after he was abducted, the Boston Herald reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Polhill, who was released Sunday by Lebanese Shiite Muslim kidnapers, 
confirmed previous reports of Steen's failed escape and illness in a telephone 
conversation with Steen's wife, Virginia, in Michigan, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
In Orlando, Fla., Steen's brother, Craig, said he was not surprised that his 
brother, a former U.S. Marine, sought to escape after being abducted with two 
other men, including Polhill, from Beirut University, where they were faculty 
members. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're captured by an enemy, one of your primary jobs is to try to 
escape," Craig Steen said. "Evidently he saw an opportunity and went for it."

DON'T RELEASE HOSTAGES, SHIITE LEADER URGES

A Shiite Muslim leader today accused the United States of responding to the 
release of an American hostage with ill will and urged pro-Iranian Shiite 
Muslim militants to continue holding their captives. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein Musawi, believed to have played a key role in Robert Polhill's release 
Sunday, complained that a U.S. House resolution Tuesday endorsing a united 
Jerusalem as Israel's capital complicates efforts to release another American 
hostage. 
</P>
<P>
"The Moslems in Lebanon offered a rose only to get a stone thrown on them," 
Musawi told a group of visiting Western journalists. 
</P>
<P>
He said the United States' intentions were demonstrated by the congressional 
resolution, which is non-binding. Musawi said the hostage-holders have been 
repeatedly urged to prove good will by freeing a captive. 
</P>
<P>
"So they did and released Polhill," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But upon that release we heard the news of the House of Representatives 
resolution on Jerusalem. If every release will be matched by such a monumental 
ill-intentioned American response, why then should any hostage be freed? 
</P>
<P>
"We hope that no other hostage will be released," said Musawi, reputed mentor 
of Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine, the group that held Polhill 
and continues to hold two other American educators. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about persistent reports that a second American hostage would be released 
during Eid al-Fitr, the three-day feast that begins Thursday to mark the end of 
Islam's holy fasting month of Ramadan, Musawi said: 
</P>
<P>
"There is plenty of talk about such a move. I don't think Eid al-Fitr means 
anything to the Americans, and I don't think there's an atmosphere of such an 
early release."

SENTENCE REDUCED FOR DORTCH, BAKKER'S RIGHT-HAND MAN AT PTL

A federal judge today reduced the prison sentence of Richard Dortch, once the 
right-hand man to Jim Bakker in the PTL Ministry, from eight years to 30 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Dortch reported to the no-bars country club prison housing some of the nation's 
former elite at Eglin Air Force Base on Feb. 2 to begin serving his sentence 
for fraud and returned to court a week and a half ago to ask Potter to reduce 
his sentence under Rule 35 of the Federal Code. 
</P>
<P>
This morning, U.S. District Judge Robert D. Potter complied. 
</P>
<P>
Dortch had been charged with the same 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy that 
got Bakker a 45-year prison sentence, but he struck a plea bargain with 
prosecutors, pleading guilty to four of the 24 counts and agreeing to testify 
against Bakker and other PTL figures. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, Potter sentenced a tearful Dortch to eight years in prison, 
telling him: "Mr. Dortch, I think you need to do some prison time. You 
committed a fraud and a rather large fraud at that." 
</P>
<P>
Potter sentenced Bakker to a 45-year prison sentence.

A window shattered in a car carrying a U.S. appeals judge under federal 
protection today, but officials said it apparently was caused by a freak 
accident and not a gunman. 
</P>
<P>
Local police had earlier reported a drive-by gunman shot the judge's window out 
about 9:50 a.m., triggering a search for the supposed assailant by state and 
local police. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Boyle, spokesman for the U.S. Marshals Service in Washington, said 
reports by Gwinnett County police that U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge 
J. L. Edmondson was shot at were inaccurate and a "gross distortion" of the 
facts. 
</P>
<P>
Boyle said federal investigators at the scene now believe the window in 
Edmondson's car simply shattered.

FRENCH COMPANY TO BUY NORTON CO. FOR $1.8 BILLION

Norton Co., which has been fending off a hostile takeover bid from British 
conglomerate BTR PLC, said today it agreed to be acquired by the French firm 
Compagnie Saint-Gobain in a deal that values the abrasives manufacturer at 
around $1.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The $90-a-share cash offer exceeds BTR's bid of $1.6 billion, or $75 a share, 
which was rejected last month by Norton's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street applauded today's announcement. In active trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange, Norton jumped $13.50 to $88.75 a share by midday. 
</P>
<P>
The announced merger with Compagnie Saint-Gobain comes a day after a federal 
judge ordered Worcester-based Norton to reveal the amount of a "white knight" 
offer it said it had received last week. 
</P>
<P>
The court order came during a hearing on suits filed on behalf of some Norton 
shareholders seeking to require Norton to fully and fairly consider BTR's offer 
and "take into consideration the interest of the shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
Norton told the Securities and Exchange Commission last Friday that a third 
party was interested in buying Norton for more money. 
</P>
<P>
BTR had planned to wage a proxy fight at Norton's annual shareholders' meeting 
set for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
One of Norton's biggest weapons was a new state law that would prevent BTR from 
taking immediate control over the Norton board.

Johnnie Walker plans a May Day launch for a new $60 Scotch whiskey developed 
exclusively for the Japanese market, the brand's Japanese distributor announced 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Johnnie Walker Gold Label 15 YO, the first new Johnnie Walker whiskey since the 
1910 launch of its Black and Red labels, has been tailored to meet an 
increasingly discriminating Japanese taste, said Shunji Moritomi, president of 
UDJ International Liquor Marketing Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
The whiskey will be sold in a 25 fluid ounce bottle with a gold label. It will 
be priced at $62.50, including Japan's 3% consumption tax. 
</P>
<P>
"The company hopes the launch of this pricey product will help it regain the 
prestige it once had in Japan," Moritomi said.

Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter today announced a 9.7% increase in the 
amount of foreign sugar that can be imported by U.S. processors from 40 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Yeutter said the increase boosts the sugar import quota to 2,834,865 metric 
tons for the period Jan. 1, 1989, through Sept. 30, 1990, an increase of 
250,000 tons from 2,584,865 tons announced on Jan. 16. 
</P>
<P>
The latest quota boost was the fourth for 1989-90. Previous increases were made 
last Sept. 12 and Nov. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Yeutter said "continued supply-demand imbalances" forced a further adjustment 
in the sugar import quota. The latest figures include the reinstatement of 
Nicaragua's share of the U.S. sugar quota.

INVESTCORP BUYING SAKS FOR $1.5 BILLION;

RETAIL: LUXURY STORES' BRITISH OWNERS ACCEPT BID BY INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT

<P>
The prestigious Saks Fifth Avenue department stores will be sold to an 
international investment group for about $1.5 billion under a definitive 
agreement announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The luxury retail chain, which was put on the auction block in September by its 
British owner, BAT Industries PLC, will be bought by Investcorp, a group 
described as well financed and experienced in retailing. 
</P>
<P>
Separate announcements from Investcorp and BATUS Inc., BAT's American arm, said 
the transaction should be completed within 10 weeks. Investcorp will also 
assume certain of Saks' liabilities, the two parties said. 
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the selection of Investcorp's offer, BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy 
said it has the resources to support continued expansion of the 45-store chain. 
</P>
<P>
Sheehy said a losing bid submitted by management, in partnership with a 
Japanese retailer, was attractive but Investcorp's was superior. 
</P>
<P>
"Saks will gain a new owner with a proven track record in building luxury 
businesses, solid financial backing and a commitment to continuing the highly 
successful strategy established by BAT for the company," Sheehy said. 
</P>
<P>
Investcorp, which operates from bases in various U.S. and foreign financial 
centers, has invested in a wide range of retailers. Investcorp offices are in 
New York, London and in cities in Switzerland and Bahrain. 
</P>
<P>
It bought the jewelry chain Tiffany &amp; Co. from Avon Products Inc. and took 
it public in 1987; it owns 50% of the Italian luxury leather goods and fashion 
company Gucci and has an interest in Chaumet, France's largest retailer of 
prestige jewelry. It also has stakes in Carvel Corp., Color Tile, Sports and 
Recreation Inc. and some non-retailing companies. 
</P>
<P>
"Saks Fifth Avenue is one of the premier retailers in the world, and we are 
absolutely delighted to be associated with it," said Paul Soldatos and Savio 
Tung, the two members of Investcorp's management committee that led the effort 
to buy Saks. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of Saks is part of a restructuring plan aimed at allowing BAT to focus 
on its core tobacco and financial services operations. The British conglomerate 
undertook the changes in battling a hostile $22-billion takeover bid by a group 
led by Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith. 
</P>
<P>
The group said earlier this week that it was quitting its quest for BAT. But 
BAT said it will carry out its restructuring as planned to enhance the 
company's value to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
All of BATUS' U.S. retail businesses are being sold. The sale of Marshall Field 
&amp; Co., the Chicago-based retailer, to Dayton Hudson Corp. was announced 
last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The flagship store of the New York-based Saks chain is in Manhattan on Fifth 
Avenue. Branch stores are in 20 states.

Relatively high mortgage interest rates held sales of existing homes in March 
to their February rate, the lowest in eight months, a real estate trade group 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Realtors said resales of single-family homes totaled a 
seasonally adjusted 3.40 million units, unchanged from February. 
</P>
<P>
It was the lowest since a 3.38 million rate last July, but one that the 
realtors' chief economist, John Tuccillo, said is sustainable for the rest of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., 30-year conventional 
fixed-rate mortgages averaged between 10.22% and 10.34% during March, high when 
compared to the single-digit rates at the end of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The realtors said the high rates had a dual effect on the existing home market. 
In some cases, the group said, consumer uncertainty triggered purchases by 
prospective buyers fearing higher rates in the future while it curbed sales by 
others hoping for lower rates in the months ahead.

Producers of the ABC series "Capital News" were told Tuesday that the series 
will be canceled after next Monday night's episode. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for ABC Entertainment, however, said the series has been put "on 
hiatus" and will return later this year. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was apparently based, in part, on another poor performance Monday 
night, when "Capital News" averaged an 8.2 rating and a 15% audience share at 
10 p.m., behind NBC's new "Shannon's Deal," at 10.2-19.8, and "Newhart" and 
"His &amp; Hers" on CBS, which together averaged an 11.2-21 in that same time 
slot. 
</P>
<P>
The MTM production will have aired four times, including a two-hour pilot. Nine 
additional programs have been completed. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Williams, the former Washington Post editor who was executive 
producer of the series along with David Milch, said Tuesday: "It was an 
overwhelming rejection. Viewers just didn't sample the show."

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: ANTIDEPRESSANT NOT CERTAIN CULPRIT IN GIRL'S SUICIDE

Question: My daughter committed suicide in 1988 one month after being put on a 
new medicine called Prozac. She was not depressed; Prozac was prescribed for an 
eating disorder. 
</P>
<P>
We believe Prozac is responsible for her suicide. She did not seem suicidal 
before she started taking this medicine, and even the day before she hanged 
herself, she promised to take care of her neighbors' cat while they were on 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Have you ever heard of another case of someone committing suicide while taking 
Prozac? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: We are so sorry to hear about your daughter's horrible death, and we 
extend our sympathy. We know of no similar case. 
</P>
<P>
Prozac (fluoxetine) has rapidly become the most successful antidepressant of 
all time. Several weeks ago it was featured on the cover of Newsweek magazine, 
and more than 650,000 prescriptions are filled each month. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Prozac so popular is its side-effect profile. Instead of making 
people feel sluggish and drowsy, this new antidepressant is more likely to 
energize or stimulate. It is far less likely to cause constipation, dry mouth 
or weight gain. In fact, people on Prozac may actually lose weight. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its swift rise to stardom, Prozac does have a darker side. It can cause 
insomnia and jitteriness. Some people complain of nausea, sexual difficulties, 
tremor and headache. 
</P>
<P>
Of greater concern is a recent report in the American Journal of Psychiatry 
(February, 1990). Psychiatrists at Harvard report that six depressed but 
non-suicidal patients developed "intense, violent suicidal preoccupation after 
two to seven weeks of fluoxetine treatment." Although none of these patients 
committed suicide, this report does suggest that doctors warn patients of the 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
There is no way to tell if Prozac was responsible for your daughter's act. The 
company assures us that it has no data indicating that depressed people are 
more likely to think about suicide while on Prozac than while on any other 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Can chromium supplements stabilize blood sugar? 
</P>
<P>
A: New research suggests that chromium has a beneficial effect on glucose 
tolerance, a measure of blood sugar. Volunteers were given chromium supplements 
(200 micrograms) for 14 weeks. When they were tested at the end of the study, 
blood sugar rose only half as far as it had at the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists will look next to see if chromium supplements can benefit Type 
II diabetics, who do not need to take insulin.

Donald and Ivana Trump, though not your average flower children, are taking a 
turn at free love. 
</P>
<P>
New York's most-trumpeted couple have signed a two-page agreement allowing them 
to date third and fourth parties without such action giving either grounds for 
divorce, the Daily News and the New York Post reported today. 
</P>
<P>
"Trump: The Dating Game" is good for at least 60 days, at which point either 
side may cancel the pact, the papers said. 
</P>
<P>
Both quoted sources as saying the pact was drawn up at the request of Ivana 
Trump, who yearns to date but doesn't want to diminish any divorce settlement. 
"She is basically saying, 'I don't want a divorce, and I don't want to become a 
nun,' " one source told the Post.

SOVIETS ON THIN NHL ICE; 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: THE FIVE WHO TOOK PART IN THE PLAYOFFS COMBINED FOR NO GOALS AND A 
MINUS-6 RATING, SPARKING GRUMBLING.

Not one of the NHL's Soviet players made it to the second round of the Stanley 
Cup playoffs. Also, none of those who participated in the opening playoff 
series did much to help his team's cause. 
</P>
<P>
The five who took part -- Sergei Makarov and Sergei Priakin of Calgary, Alexei 
Kasatonov and Viacheslav Fetisov of New Jersey and Alexander Mogilny of Buffalo 
-- combined for no goals, 12 assists and a minus-six rating in 24 playoff 
games. 
</P>
<P>
That prompted Don Cherry, who once described the Soviets as "money-grubbing 
Reds," to claim that the Soviets wanted to lose so they could join their 
national team for the world championships in Switzerland. Makarov, Kasatonov 
and Fetisov are playing for the Soviet Union, which was the victim of a major 
upset by Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet players had a difficult time adapting to the NHL, for a number of 
reasons. The culture had much to do with it, as did the steady diet of tough 
games in a relentless 80-game schedule. 
</P>
<P>
When some of the Soviets finally got the hang of the regular season, they found 
themselves thrust into the playoffs, with greater intensity and greater 
demands. They lacked the ability to raise their game that extra notch. 
</P>
<P>
Igor Dmitriev, assistant coach and chief spokesman for the Soviet national 
team, indicated that the Soviet Ice Hockey Federation was embarrassed by the 
players' poor performances and would hold a camp in Moscow in August to prepare 
them for next season. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of problems," Dmitriev told the Toronto Sun. "It wasn't just 
new team, new country. The biggest thing was training. I think they were not so 
prepared for the NHL. You have to understand, they were in training their whole 
lives. They didn't have to do anything on their own before."

Australian Pat Cash continued his comeback from an eight-month injury layoff by 
upsetting second seed Kevin Curren of the United States 6-1, 6-4 today in the 
Salem Open tennis championship. 
</P>
<P>
Cash, the 1987 Wimbledon champion, swept aside Curren in a first-round match. 
</P>
<P>
"To say I was reasonably happy would be an understatement," Cash said after the 
first-round victory. Curren is No. 43 in the world rankings. 
</P>
<P>
Cash, the 1987 Wimbledon champion and currently ranked No. 243, last week 
reached the final of the South Korea Open. 
</P>
<P>
Eighth-seed Dan Goldie of the United States advanced to the second round with a 
6-3, 6-3 victory over Israeli Gilad Bloom. Goldie will meet Canadian Grant 
Connell, who beat American Leif Shiras 6-1, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
In other first-round matches, Patrick Kuhnen of West Germany defeated American 
Joey Rive 6-1, 6-4 and American Brad Pearce beat fellow qualifier Kim Bong-soo 
of South Korea 6-2, 6-3.

The Augusta National has shattered the dreams of thousands of golf fans by 
denying a report that it plans to open the home of the Masters tournament for 
play by the public at certain times of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The club issued a statement dated April 23 saying that the report in the May 
issue of Golf magazine "was intended as an April Fools' Day joke." 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, many people have taken the article seriously as we have 
received an avalanche of inquiries about playing privileges," the statement 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
It reaffirmed that the exclusive Augusta National remains a private club open 
only to members and their guests. 
</P>
<P>
The only exceptions are the professional and amateur golfers invited each year 
to participate in the first major championship of the season. Britain's Nick 
Faldo earlier this month became only the second player after Jack Nicklaus to 
win the title in successive years.

'TOO TALL' NOT RETURNING TO DALLAS

Defensive end Ed (Too Tall) Jones says he won't return to the Dallas Cowboys 
for a 16th season because he no longer fits the rebuilding Dallas system that 
has placed an emphasis on youth. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, 39, said he may consider offers from other National Football League 
teams, but also hinted at possible retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Jimmy Johnson has decided go with younger players," he said. "You don't 
make those changes and keep an older player." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he hadn't talked to Jones about his plans. But it became apparent 
that the Cowboys had lost interest in Jones when they did not make him a 
qualifying contract offer and left him unprotected during the Plan B free 
agency signing period. He remains a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
Jones would be the league's oldest player if he plays a 16th season. 
</P>
<P>
"I might wake up tomorrow and retire," Jones said Tuesday. "So I'm not going to 
say that I will sign with another team."

Notre Dame officials have informed the NCAA of a university investigation of 
possible misuse of a telephone credit card number by members of the football 
team, according to a newspaper report Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The telephone charges reached thousands of dollars and could involve several 
players, the South Bend Tribune reported. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Lou Holtz refused to comment but hinted several players may be 
disciplined for reasons he declined to explain. 
</P>
<P>
"We never discuss disciplinary matters within the university," he said. "When 
we practice, a certain number of individuals will be confined to study hall." 
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Richard Rosenthal was out of town and could not be reached 
for comment.

STERN DEFENDS LAKERS FINE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
NBA Commissioner David Stern used a baseball analogy today to defend his 
$25,000 fine of the Los Angeles Lakers for failing to use a number of regulars 
in their final regular season game Sunday at Portland. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to call balls and strikes," Stern said at a luncheon of the 
International Radio and Television Society. 
</P>
<P>
"The Lakers' action was clearly wide of the plate." 
</P>
<P>
Stern said that fans buying tickets deserve the best product and that the 
Lakers did not supply that. 
</P>
<P>
"We make an implicit promise at our games. 'Playing today: Those healthy and 
able.' It is not hard and fast, but that is our compact with the media and our 
fans." 
</P>
<P>
With Magic Johnson, James Worthy and Mychal Thompson on the bench, Portland 
defeated Los Angeles 130-88, the most one-sided defeat in Laker history. The 
game did not affect the final standings or playoff situation of either team. 
</P>
<P>
Would Stern repeat the punishment? 
</P>
<P>
"This one was wide of the plate," he said. "We'll wait until the next one." 
</P>
<P>
Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent, seated next to Stern at the luncheon, 
endorsed his colleague's disciplinary action. "We believe strongly that teams 
must make significant effort," he said. "It's a difficult line to draw. I think 
David did the right thing."
