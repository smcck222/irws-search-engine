FORGET EVERYTHING YOU EVER KNEW ABOUT THE TRADITIONAL TEA PARTY. TEA HAS GROWN

<P>
The three martini lunch is passe. The cocktail party is in decline. These days 
the truly trendy invite their friends in to take tea. 
</P>
<P>
 But if tea conjures up old-fashioned images of proper people sitting around 
with their pinkies raised, think again. Tea has changed. 
</P>
<P>
When artist Merle Miller decided to give her very first tea party, she was 
faced with two challenges: How to give her contemporary home a romantic teatime 
atmosphere, and how not to overwhelm her male guests with too many frilly 
foods. 
</P>
<P>
But Miller was determined. Inspired by a recent trip to London, her tea 
featured a patio counter covered with splashy batik cloths to highlight 
champagne glasses and berry baskets, and sofas and chairs draped with rich 
heavy throws. At the flower mart in downtown Los Angeles, she found some wide 
French-tapestry-wired ribbons and natural fiber ribbons, which she wove around 
her teapot, along with some old lace. 
</P>
<P>
And so it was on a beautiful sunlit Sunday afternoon at 4 o'clock, teatime, 
that Miller's sprawling Bel-Air home, full of post-modern furniture and tribal 
art, was transformed into an eclectic tea parlor. Caterer Kay Kramon brought 
freshly baked currant scones and orange mini-muffins, and a harpist was hired. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid what Miller termed "sensory overload," she placed the food, tea 
services and floral centerpieces (pots of exotic orchids and cheerful spring 
bouquets) at various stations inside the house and around the patio. Arranging 
the food with a painterly eye for balance and color, she mixed and matched the 
trays, china, platters and baskets used to serve each item. Wild twig baskets 
contained Parmesan toast; a green marble slab held parsley-trimmed sandwiches. 
Miller put plates of sugar-sprinkled brownies and strawberries on a metal 
kitchen rack decorated with French ribbon. Vegetable sandwiches garnished with 
orchids and delicate bamboo sprigs were set on a blond wood tray. 
</P>
<P>
As for the beverage itself, Miller feels that "A lot of teas are boring -- they 
have no flavor." She favors Darjeeling from New Delhi because "It's very fresh, 
musty and earthy." She's also a fan of designer teas -- "I love apricot." 
</P>
<P>
And how did the men get along? Miller said she was thrilled by their response. 
There is, however, one thing she discovered: "Men don't really like little 
sandwiches," Miller said. "Next time, I'll serve bigger, heavier ones." 
</P>
<P>
Free-lance food writer Judith Pacht's version of high tea was done in the style 
of the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
She served small tostadas filled with tequila-marinated flank steak. Pacht 
dreamed up another variation on the traditional tea sandwich in the form of 
quesadilla wedges with sun-dried tomatoes and chiles. (These can be assembled 
ahead and heated just before serving.) They were accompanied by fragrant lemon 
and cinnamon teas served in multihued Luna Garcia-designed cups. 
</P>
<P>
Cornmeal-pinon tartlets, a spinoff of a cornmeal pie idea, were filled with 
toasted pine nuts in buttery caramel. And a spicy hint of chile was the 
surprise twist in her fudgy Sandia chocolate-chile squares, named for Sandia 
Peak in New Mexico. To drink, Pacht often pours good quality green tea. "It has 
an essence that is so fragrant and subtle," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Pacht served her casual tea in the living room, on top a grand piano lushly 
draped with a geometric black-and-white weave; a Southwestern-style fireplace 
warmed the room. "The important thing," Pacht said, "is to keep the food 
simple. Also, to make the party easier for the host or hostess, it is better to 
invite just a few people, at most six to eight. Otherwise go to Trumps and have 
a terrific time." 
</P>
<P>
"When I was little, everybody had teas," said Barbara Cheatley, a Claremont 
store owner. "I grew up helping my mother make sandwiches for tea. Usually we 
didn't sit -- we just walked around and balanced our plates. We all thought we 
had to be ladies." 
</P>
<P>
From the Georgian through the Victorian era, many little girls in high-button 
shoes had Nursery Tea in the afternoon. It was served on a miniature tea 
service; dolls were generally the honored guests. 
</P>
<P>
Our modern Nursery Tea was conceived by caterer Kay Kramon and offered warm 
cocoa mixed with orange-flavored tea and miniature marshmallows. 
</P>
<P>
For adult appetites, she suggested a menu to go with herbal or fruit teas: 
traditional Marsala-laden scones with creme fraiche and fresh berry jam; lemon 
curd tartlets (adapted from Martha Stewart's book "Entertaining"); orange pate 
with Grand Marnier, and crisp endive with salmon roe. And just to prove that a 
tea can be held anywhere, this one was served in interior designer Marcella 
Bade's upstairs bedroom, overlooking the Hollywood hills. 
</P>
<P>
The following recipes are from Judith Pacht and Kay Kramon. For assorted 
mini-sandwiches, Kramon suggests different combinations of thinly sliced 
cucumber, tomato, white and red radishes, watercress, dill, chives and parsley, 
and various sprouts with herbed mayonnaise or tarragon butter. Use very thinly 
sliced crustless white and wheat breads. Flavored breads, such as the anise or 
fig breads from La Brea Bakery (or your own banana or date nut bread), make 
wonderful tea party fare when spread with cream cheese.

FOOD BRIEFS: BARLEY GETS A BOOST AS A CHOLESTEROL FIGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The grain family's cholesterol-fighting ability got another boost last week 
with the release of a new study at a chemists' convention. 
</P>
<P>
This time it was barley's turn to demonstrate a tendency to lower elevated 
blood cholesterol levels in humans, according to a report presented at the 
American Chemical Society's national meeting in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The author, Rosemary K. Newman of Montana State University, found that "Barley 
is right up there with oats as one of the best foods for lowering cholesterol." 
</P>
<P>
The findings emerged from two separate feeding studies conducted by Newman, a 
professor in the school's Plant and Soil Science Department. Although the 
groups' sample sizes were small, the results are promising. 
</P>
<P>
In the largest study, 22 men and women with elevated cholesterol levels were 
chosen. The group was then split into two sections. One set of participants was 
served a six-week diet that included three products -- cereal, muffins or flat 
bread -- made from oat flour. The other set of subjects were served the same 
baked goods, except that the items were prepared with barley flour. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lowering of cholesterol of up to 14% in both groups with no 
appreciable difference between (the two)," Newman reports. 
</P>
<P>
(Oat bran's ability to effectively battle cholesterol was minimized in a recent 
study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. However, the journal 
report has subsequently been questioned by leading researchers in the 
cholesterol field. In a separate development, rice bran has also demonstrated 
cholesterol-lowering capabilities.) 
</P>
<P>
The other Newman study demonstrated that baked barley products, when 
incorporated into a four-week diet, were more effective in lowering levels of 
low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, or that form of the substance considered 
harmful, than were baked wheat products. 
</P>
<P>
The author theorizes that an ingredient in barley -- beta-glucans -- works in 
conjunction with other soluble fibers to partially prevent the absorption of 
dietary fats and cholesterol in the intestine. 
</P>
<P>
Another important component of barley -- tocotrienol -- also works to suppress 
cholesterol production in the liver, Newman reported. 
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we believe that barley has an advantage over all other grains in 
controlling cholesterol," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Health Claims Stall -- Whether barley growers and processors will capitalize on 
the grain's cholesterol-fighting potential is not as clear as it was just a few 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to February, food manufacturers rushed to make health claims on product 
labels or packaging when any such encouraging research was published. But the 
activity has subsided now that the U. S. Food and Drug Administration is close 
to adopting new regulations on any health-related statements on product labels 
or in advertising, according to an advocacy group's newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
Nutrition Week, a publication of the Washington-based Community Nutrition 
Institute, reports that the FDA will intensify enforcement of "inappropriate 
health claims" made on food products. 
</P>
<P>
The newsletter reports that breakfast cereals are likely to receive a great 
deal of the agency's regulatory attention because of the proliferation of 
health claims made in this category. 
</P>
<P>
Kellogg's is believed to have been the first to incorporate health information 
on a product package when it stated that a high-fiber diet might reduce the 
risk of cancer. The statement appeared on Kellogg's All-Bran cereal, which is 
advertised as a high-fiber food. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the agency's labeling proposal, Health and Human Services 
Secretary Louis W. Sullivan virtually acknowledged that things had gotten out 
of hand. 
</P>
<P>
"In hindsight, the 1987 proposal has proved to be too permissive," said 
Sullivan, whose department includes FDA. "We need an interim policy to serve as 
a mid-course correction and provide guidance to industry on what health 
messages will and will not be allowed. Only with such a consistent set of 
standards can Americans be sure of the meaning of health information on 
labels." 
</P>
<P>
The public comment period on the federal proposal recently closed. Final 
regulations will be written after the statements are reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the present, almost free-wheeling attitude toward label claims, the 
FDA's initial proposal greatly narrows the areas where health claims can be 
made for foods. Only a limited range of messages on relationships between diet 
and health will be allowed. And these areas must be substantiated in recent 
research by the U.S. Surgeon General or the National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
There are six dietary relationships that the FDA is considering in its 
rule-making process. They are: calcium and osteoporosis; sodium and 
hypertension; lipids and cardiovascular disease; lipids and cancer; dietary 
fiber and cancer, and fiber and cardiovascular disease. 
</P>
<P>
Helping the Endangered -- Even as health claims on food products may be fading, 
similar pro-environment messages seem to be taking their place. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more unusual examples of this environmentally sensitive packaging 
comes from Hughes Markets. The chain recently announced that it would begin 
carrying the pictures of endangered species on its store-brand milk cartons. 
</P>
<P>
The first animal to appear on Hughes half-gallon milk cartons is the California 
condor. 
</P>
<P>
The supermarket chain, with 47 outlets, claims to be the first in Southern 
California to embark on such a program, which is being coordinated with the 
Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn. The effort aims to "educate the community on the 
threat facing many endangered species such as lions, tigers and elephants." 
</P>
<P>
In the coming year, Hughes will produce as many as three million milk cartons 
carrying the pictures of endangered species. The packaging also will include 
information on the animals and a telephone number from which to receive more 
information on animal conservation.

MICROWAVE: USE BAKED FILLINGS WITH STUFFED VEGETABLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ANDERSON and ELAINE HANNA, Anderson and Hanna are nutritionists and 
cookbook authors specializing in microwave cookery. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A microwave oven cooks stuffed vegetables, such as peppers, in about half the 
time it takes to bake them in a standard oven. 
</P>
<P>
But because vegetables cook so quickly by microwave, use cooked fillings that 
need nothing more than a quick reheating. Otherwise, the vegetables will be 
reduced to mush. 
</P>
<P>
To brown the top of the stuffing, place the stuffed vegetables under a broiler 
after microwaving. Use a ceramic casserole that can withstand intense broiler 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BEEF- AND BULGUR-STUFFED RED OR GREEN PEPPERS 
</P>
<P>
4 large sweet red or green peppers 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon oil 
</P>
<P>
1 medium onion, minced 
</P>
<P>
1 large clove garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
3/4 pound lean ground beef 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup uncooked bulgur or cracked wheat 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups tomato or spaghetti sauce 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon water 
</P>
<P>
Slice stem ends off peppers. Remove cores and seeds, then set peppers aside. 
</P>
<P>
Mix oil, onion, garlic and beef in microwave-safe 2-quart casserole large 
enough to hold peppers upright with 1/2 inch between. Push meat mixture into 
doughnut shape around edge of casserole. 
</P>
<P>
Cover with wax paper and microwave on HIGH (100% power) 7 to 8 minutes, 
stirring at half time to break up beef and cook until no longer pink. 
</P>
<P>
Mix in bulgur, 1 cup tomato sauce, Worcestershire, salt and red pepper flakes. 
Cover with vented plastic wrap and microwave on HIGH 5 minutes. Stir, cover and 
microwave on MEDIUM (50% power) 4 1/2 to 5 minutes until bulgur is tender-firm. 
Let stand, covered, 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Fill peppers with meat mixture and arrange 1/2 inch apart in same casserole. 
Add water and cover casserole with lid or vented plastic food wrap. Microwave 
on HIGH 7 to 8 minutes until peppers are barely tender, rotating casserole 180 
degrees at half time. Let stand, covered, 3 minutes (peppers will continue to 
cook). 
</P>
<P>
Lift peppers to heated serving plates. Discard casserole liquid and pour in 
remaining 1/2 cup tomato sauce. Cover and microwave on HIGH 2 minutes until 
uniformly hot. Spoon some sauce over each pepper before serving. Makes 4 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
Variation: 
</P>
<P>
For Beef- and Rice-Stuffed Peppers, prepare as directed, substituting 1/2 cup 
uncooked converted rice for bulgur. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RICE- AND CHEDDAR-STUFFED TOMATOES 
</P>
<P>
4 medium (2 1/2 to 3 inches in diameter) firm-ripe tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
1 small onion, minced 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>
1 cup cooked rice 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup coarsely shredded sharp Cheddar cheese 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons minced canned green chiles 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/8 teaspoon black pepper 
</P>
<P>
Slice 1/4 inch off stem ends of tomatoes and discard. Scoop seeds and pulp into 
bowl. Drain tomatoes upside-down on several thicknesses of paper towels. 
Discard tomato seeds. Drain tomato pulp and coarsely chop. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Microwave onion and butter in wax-paper-covered, microwave-safe 1-quart 
casserole on HIGH (100% power) 2 1/2 to 3 minutes until glassy. Mix in tomato 
pulp, rice, cheese, chiles, 1/4 teaspoon salt or to taste and pepper. Stuff 
tomatoes with rice mixture, dividing evenly. Arrange 1 inch apart in 9-inch 
microwave-safe pie plate, leaving empty space in center. 
</P>
<P>
Microwave, uncovered, on MEDIUM-HIGH (70% power) 7 to 9 minutes, rotating pie 
plate 180 degrees at half time, and cook until tomatoes are just tender. Check 
for doneness after 7 minutes (don't pierce or tomatoes will lose juice and 
shape). Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: In ovens of less than 600 watts, increase cooking times about 15%.

FRESH MEAT, SPICES AND HARD WORK GO INTO SOUTHERN COMFORT FOOD; 
</P>
<P>
SAUSAGE: MAKERS OF HOMEMADE COUNTRY LINKS SAY THE SKINNY, STORE-BOUGHT KIND 
DON'T COMPARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK MARTIN, Martin is a free-lance writer from Portsmouth, Va., who writes 
for the Virginian-Pilot &amp; Ledger-Star in Norfolk, Va. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sausage actually sounds good, spitting and sizzling in a cast-iron skillet. But 
it's that roaming rich and savory aroma that yanks you out from under the 
covers on the coldest of mornings. 
</P>
<P>
For Southerners, the scent of country sausage frying on the stove signals the 
arrival of cool weather, like fresh wood smoke and dead leaves. Years ago -- 
before we knew arteries clog so easily -- farmers slaughtered hogs during 
November and December and ground and stuffed tubs of sagey sausage. It still 
tastes best this time of year. With scrambled eggs, fat biscuits and buttered 
grits, sausage may be the ultimate Southern comfort food, warmer than the 
heaviest quilt. 
</P>
<P>
The real, old-fashioned kind is hard to find these days, although the 
supermarket coolers are stacked with skinny links, peddled by country and 
Western singers and giant pork conglomerates. Most folks, it seems, don't want 
to take the trouble to make it the way it should be. 
</P>
<P>
"It's part of the changing of the times, I guess," says Carolyn Vann who 
creates her own country sausage -- mild and hot, bulk and link -- every week at 
the B&amp;C Meat Mart in Suffolk, Va. Vann learned to make it growing up near 
Edenton, N.C., more than 25 years ago. "Some people don't realize the 
difference," she says. "You just can't compare homemade sausage to the 
store-bought kind." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Vann, there are a few other sausage makers scattered throughout the 
South -- in the little grocery stores and old butcher shops -- who still know 
how to season, grind and stuff the meat. The right way. They've inherited 
recipes from their parents and learned to twist and tie the links by watching 
expert farm women in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
But these breakfast-food artisans say the secret is not in the right spice 
blend or the correct link technique. It's simple: Making good country sausage 
requires fresh meat and hard work. 
</P>
<P>
The sausage can't get any fresher than at Young's Meat Barn in the little town 
of Parksley on Virginia's Eastern Shore. Between three and 10 o'clock every 
Monday morning, Ralph Young and his son Franklin slaughter 30 to 45 hogs in the 
back of their little red building off Route 13. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of days later, that same fresh pork is stuffed into sausage casings 
and curled up in the meat case out front. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the meat goes directly from hoof to link all under one roof may 
be the biggest reason Young's sausage is so famous -- why the guy from 
Washington State flies 10 pounds home in his suitcase every few weeks, and why 
the Youngs sometimes sell three tons a week. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, that could be it," grunts 61-year-old Ralph. "Ours is sure fresh," adds 
Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph learned meat cutting as a boy, and has been in the business for 24 years. 
The Youngs put out all kinds of pork parts for their ravenous customers -- 
pigs' feet, ears and livers -- but the sausage is still the big seller. On one 
morning, they had moved 400 pounds of the pink, plump links and bulk meat in 
four hours and the crew was cranking out more in the back, trying to keep up 
with demand. The hungry patrons eye it through the glass window and then buy 
five pounds or more at a time at $2.29 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
"Goodness, we've sold a lot of sausage these past couple of days," declares 
salesclerk Alma Chew, over the whine of a band saw. 
</P>
<P>
The Youngs drop nothing but the best hams, butts and shoulders into their fancy 
grinder, which chews up the pork in 100-pound batches. They stick to a 70-30 
lean-to-fat formula, and they say that's the key to sausage making. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's too lean, it'll cook too hard," says Ralph, "and if it's too fat, it's 
just no good." 
</P>
<P>
Their ratios may vary slightly, but the other sausage makers all agree that a 
good mixture of fat and lean is necessary to keep it tasty and juicy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's got to be lean enough not to stick, but fat enough so you don't need to 
put any grease in the pan," says Curtis Ansell, who makes and sells sausage at 
his little supermarket in the Back Bay area of Norfolk. Ansell says his 
70-year-old-sister, Edna Spence, can eyeball the meat and tell how much fat to 
add before grinding it. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Newbern of Portsmouth makes his with 60% lean meat, all from neck 
portions. "Fat makes the difference," he says. "Got to have the mixture." 
</P>
<P>
Newbern, who resembles a jumbo link himself, cuts and sells fresh pork chops, 
roasts and ribs at Newbern's Family Meats in Norfolk. But it's his mild and hot 
country sausage that really draws folks to the wooden lean-to building. 
</P>
<P>
"People who buy sausage from me used to go to Carolina every week to get it," 
he claims. 
</P>
<P>
A Portsmouth native, the 47-year-old Newbern says he learned to use a knife and 
bone saw when he was 12, working part time in stores after school. But he 
picked up his famous sausage recipe 21 years ago from an old hog farmer down 
near Goldsboro, N.C., while he was cutting meat at the Piggly Wiggly. And it 
took some real talking to get the recipe out of the old guy, Newbern says. 
There's black pepper, cayenne, sage, paprika and salt in his Carolina sausage, 
he says, but no MSG and no fancy preservatives. 
</P>
<P>
This is the motto of all the country sausage makers: Nothing but the purest, 
natural ingredients go into the meat. 
</P>
<P>
But the rest of the mixture is pretty simple. The Youngs say they use only 
sage, salt and pepper. And Joe Suraci, owner of Joe's Old Fashioned Meat Market 
in Virginia Beach, says he created his recipe by just eating it and reading the 
label on the store-bought brands. 
</P>
<P>
Suraci, who grew up in New York State, first made chorizo and Italian sausage, 
but now his country version is also a big seller. Despite his Yankee accent, 
his sausage tastes like the real Southern thing. 
</P>
<P>
There are tricks to the trade, though. For instance, Bill Newbern and Curtis 
Ansell both rub the spices into the meat and marinate it for 24 hours before 
grinding it. 
</P>
<P>
Like Newbern, Ansell says he learned the secrets from a farmer 15 years ago who 
had decided to get out of the business because he was getting too old to turn 
the grinder. 
</P>
<P>
Ansell's sister Edna has been making sausage since she was 10, and she still 
takes on most of the grinding and stuffing responsibilities at the little 
supermarket in Virginia Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Edna cuts up about 280 pounds of fresh pork butts every Monday and marinates 
the meat on Tuesday. Early the next morning, at a table in the back under a 
picture of Curtis posing with East Coast chicken king Frank Perdue, Edna and 
three helpers run the pork through the grinder until it looks like hamburger. 
They attach the deflated and cleaned hog intestine casing to a nozzle on the 
sausage stuffer and push a lever that mashes the meat out into the casing. Edna 
then twists and ties the four-foot sausage "snake" into links. Six of her links 
make a pound -- and you don't have to set them on the scale to know that. "I 
just enjoy doing it," Edna says. 
</P>
<P>
For a long time, the Ansells used an old creaky stuffer borrowed from the 
farmer who gave them the recipe. Then, a couple of years ago, they ordered a 
shiny steel machine from Buffalo, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
"Wasn't worth a durn," says Ansell. "The meat was squirtin' up over the edges." 
A local woman then loaned them a black iron antique stuffer -- about twice as 
tall as a big food processor -- and that's what Edna uses every week now. 
</P>
<P>
Ansell's sausage gets around. The hunters who come to Back Bay from West 
Virginia every year take it home with them. And visitors from Philadelphia and 
Baltimore also load up their car trunks before heading back to the big city. Of 
course, there are regular sausage customers from "uptown." 
</P>
<P>
Daring folks especially crave Ansell's hot country sausage, which can explode 
in your mouth like little firecrackers, depending on how much crushed red 
pepper Edna sprinkles in. 
</P>
<P>
"People will come back sometimes and swear that we made it too hot," Ansell 
says, laughing. So once in a while, Edna will fry up a sample, right there in 
the store, to make sure she's got the seasoning right. It smells great, and on 
those days the customers almost climb over the meat case to get a bundle. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of our sausage," Ansell says, "because we have it and everybody else 
doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
All of the sausage makers take pride in their dying skills, but they aren't 
exactly living testimonials for their product. 
</P>
<P>
Most of them don't eat sausage. 
</P>
<P>
"Nope, I'm allergic to pork," Ansell says. "I swell up and start to itch." Edna 
says she can't eat it because of a cholesterol problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I've slacked off because of my health," Ralph Young says. "I just don't care 
too much for pork," adds his son Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Vann loves sausage, but her doctor will allow nary a link because of 
her "high blood." 
</P>
<P>
Then there's 6-foot-1, 280-pound Bill Newbern. You'd probably have to wrestle 
him to scrape it off his breakfast plate. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it scrambled in eggs and topped with country cheese," he says with a 
big grin.

ABOUT WINE: A CAVEAT ABOUT BLIND TASTINGS: SOME VINTAGES WORK WELL WITH FOODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The best wine in a blind tasting is often the best wine to buy. At least it has 
passed a quality test. 
</P>
<P>
In a blind tasting, the evaluators have no knowledge of the label and therefore 
can't be prejudiced for or against a particular wine because of past 
experiences with it, or with other wines from the same winery. 
</P>
<P>
Blind tasting levels the playing field for wines of widely divergent prices 
too. This is significant because price is not a major factor in determining 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a winery that bought its vineyard in 1934 and makes its Chardonnay 
from grapes growing on that vineyard can sell the wine for $8 a bottle and make 
a fair profit. That's because the cost of the raw material, the grapes, is 
little more than the cost to farm the vineyard plus the cost of oak barrels to 
age the wine. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the winery that buys grapes at $1,800 a ton is paying nearly 
$3 for the juice inside each bottle, and with salaries, processing, oak barrels 
and other cost factors, the wine must sell for more than $8 -- considerably 
more. 
</P>
<P>
(It has been estimated that the cost of a bottle of wine should equal the cost 
of a ton of grapes for the wine times .01, which would make the Chardonnay from 
$1,800-a-ton grapes sell for $18 a bottle.) 
</P>
<P>
Blind tasting also eliminates the bias we all feel against wines from unknown 
wine regions. Seeing he'll be tasting a Chardonnay from New Mexico, a judge 
might wince, yet in a blind tasting, the only thing that matters is wine 
quality. (And New Mexico has a thriving and improving wine industry.) 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, blind tasting of wine is really only one element to the 
ultimate goal of enjoyment of wine. The other is simply: how does the wine go 
with food? 
</P>
<P>
It is an area of no precise answers because of the obvious drawbacks. Look at 
the pitfalls in logistics alone: 
</P>
<P>
A fine Chardonnay wins a blind tasting. It is perfectly made and harmonious, 
offering fine flavors and good balance. Then someone brings to the dinner table 
two dishes, a salad with rice wine vinegar and baked salmon. The wine tastes 
awful with the salad (of course), but superb with the fish. 
</P>
<P>
Even though it is not a science and the hazards are obvious, exploring the 
great wine and food combinations is a quest of loads of people. Books have been 
written on the subject, people have made careers out of lecturing on it, and it 
is so fascinating that chefs around the world have recently doted on the idea 
that a dish once thought classic might well be improved to match better with 
wine. 
</P>
<P>
Joshua Wesson, a master sommelier and co-author (with David Rosengarten) of 
"Red Wine With Fish," explored wine and food combinations in his book and in 
his newsletter, the Wine and Food Companion. 
</P>
<P>
He notes that just because a dish goes with a particular Chardonnay doesn't 
mean it goes with all Chardonnays. 
</P>
<P>
"Three wines made from the same grape could lead people to three different 
conclusions about their food affinity," he said. One wine may enhance the dish, 
one may diminish it and a third may make no statement whatever. 
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that just tasting the wine, by itself, is often not a good 
clue to how it will match with certain foods. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at wine the way I look at people," he said. "We're all equal but some 
are more equal than others. Every wine will have one element that makes it 
stand out. It's rare to find three Chardonnays that taste so similar to one 
another that you would be hard-pressed to differentiate one from another. 
</P>
<P>
"And some wines that taste good without food don't work very well with food." 
</P>
<P>
In researching their book, Wesson and Rosengarten evaluated the wines first, 
without food. Then the wines were paired with food. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you can predict accurately a wine and food match in your head, but 
more often than not, we found that although we came close, we didn't hit the 
nail on the head until we tried many wines to find an ideal match." 
</P>
<P>
The quest is not incidental, by the way, especially for the person who has a 
great (and expensive) wine that he wants to pour with dinner and he wants the 
dinner to enhance the wine, and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
"You can have wines that are ennobled by a dish, and you can have wines that 
are diminished by a dish," said Wesson, and there are combinations that make 
both the food and the wine better. 
</P>
<P>
"And you can't really put a pleasure quotient on any of this. Matches come in 
different shapes and styles . . . but obviously it's better to have a modest 
wine ennobled. I hate having my Montrachet stepped on." 
</P>
<P>
A problem in using blind-tasting evaluations as a sole guide to what wines will 
go with food is that blind tastings almost never are done with food on the 
table. And, said Wesson, "The biggest wines often win wine tastings and these 
are not usually the best wines for food." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, Wesson and Rosengarten, in their newsletter, taste specific wines 
with specific dishes, usually at well-regarded restaurants. They list the 
ingredients of the dishes and, using wit to make the text readable, rank the 
wines on how well they felt they went with the dishes. 
</P>
<P>
Exploring this further, Wine Country International Magazine, based in northern 
California, stages a series of tastings that it publishes six times a year 
looking into the question of wine and food pairings. A recent adventure into 
this format was most interesting. 
</P>
<P>
Four judges were invited to the elegant Lodge at Pebble Beach and its newer 
sister property, the Inn at Spanish Bay, to evaluate Chardonnays and Cabernets 
in a standard blind tasting. 
</P>
<P>
All the wines were scored, then all the winners -- 10 Chardonnays and 10 
Cabernets -- were poured later in the day, again blind, before an amazing array 
of food prepared by the chefs of the two inns. 
</P>
<P>
The goal was to select the best wine-food matches to create a four-course 
summer meal. 
</P>
<P>
The interesting thing was that the top-rated wines in terms of raw scores in 
the blind tasting were not the wines favored by the panel members when it came 
time to pair wines with food. Indeed, a 1988 Louis Martini Chardonnay ($9.50) 
went beautifully with a number of the dishes even though it wasn't ranked above 
fifth in the overall tasting portion of the event. 
</P>
<P>
The other day I was chatting with Julie Garvey, co-owner of Flora Springs 
winery in the Napa Valley. Flora Springs wine maker Ken Deis makes a stylish 
Chardonnay that accents complexity and richness and offers less in the way of 
overt tutti-frutti aromas. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 Flora Springs Chardonnay ($23.50) is a truly elegant and beautifully 
structured wine that is clearly suited to be served with food. It should not be 
well-chilled either. It's best to serve it at cellar temperature, no cooler 
than 55 degrees, to experience the nuance in the wine. 
</P>
<P>
"As we have matured in the last decade," said Garvey, rather wistfully the 
other day, "we are getting fewer gold medals for our wines, but we are making 
wines that are better than ever." 
</P>
<P>
Deis noted that showy wines often win medals and may be served with food and no 
one will complain, but "balanced wines like this go better with food. The wine 
tastes better and the food tastes better" 
</P>

Wine of the Week 
</P>
<P>
1988 Zaca Mesa Reserve Pinot Noir ($15) -- Excellent Pinot fruit of cherries 
enhanced by a delicate cinnamon and clove element, and a touch of toastiness 
from the barrels in which it was aged. None of the vegetal characteristics that 
pervade so many Central Coast Pinot Noirs. Wine maker Gale Sysock has made 
great strides with Pinot Noir in the last few years, and this wine is his 
latest winner.

THE VEGETARIAN: STRAWBERRY OMELET IS LOW ON CALORIES, BUT NOT TASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANA SHAW, Shaw is a free-lance writer in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A recent study suggested that a drastic reduction in daily calorie intake may 
extend one's life span by up to 50%. 
</P>
<P>
But for those who subscribe to the notion that to eat is no vice, the question 
is: What would be grimmer than a longer life of fewer meals? 
</P>
<P>
If quality of life is what concerns you, continue to serve delectable dishes 
such as this strawberry omelet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STRAWBERRY OMELET 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup strawberries, hulled and halved 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon Kirsch or Grand Marnier 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
Dash salt 
</P>
<P>
8 eggs or 4 eggs and 6 whites, well beaten 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons butter (less if using nonstick pan) 
</P>
<P>
Whole strawberries 
</P>
<P>
Soak halved strawberries in Kirsch and 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar 1 hour. 
</P>
<P>
Beat salt and remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar into eggs. Heat butter in 
skillet. When melted, swirl pan to distribute butter evenly, then pour in eggs. 
</P>
<P>
Cook over low heat until bottom is set, but top is still slightly liquid. 
Distribute halved strawberries evenly in strip down center of omelet. Using 
spatula, fold bottom edge up to enclose filling. Continue cooking over medium 
heat until bottom has browned, and center is set. 
</P>
<P>
Invert large serving plate over pan, and flip omelet onto it. Slice into 4 
equal portions and garnish with whole strawberries. Makes 4 servings.

THE BUTCHER: BOOK, VIDEO WEIGH IN WITH TASTY DIET RECIPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MERLE ELLIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We are inundated these days with diet programs, diet supplements, diet systems 
-- all promising some magic weight loss something or other. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is one weight loss program that I can recommend. Experts from 
the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and chef Jacques Pepin have joined forces to 
produce "A Fare that Fits," a cookbook/video package that features recipes that 
taste good, leave you feeling full and yet are low in fat and calories. 
</P>
<P>
"The secret to losing weight -- and keeping it off -- is not in miracle diets 
but in a gradual weight loss of one to two pounds per week," says Karen 
Miller-Kovach, assistant director of nutrition services at the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Pepin, cookbook author and personal chef to three French presidents, developed 
the 60 recipes in the cookbook. The selections range from casual snacks to 
elegant meals. Menus were developed to contain no more than 30% of the calories 
from fats, and all recipes are designed to meet the U.S. Dietary Guidelines for 
Healthy Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Nutritional information has been translated into acceptable dietary guidelines 
by Miller-Kovach, who helped Pepin make flavorful, filling, low-calorie cooking 
a reality. 
</P>
<P>
To make the following Pepin dish, buy whole turkey breasts and cut the steaks 
yourself, or ask the butcher to do it. If the steaks are one-half-inch thick, 
follow the cooking instructions below. Reduce the cooking time if they are 
thinner, however, and cook them longer if they are thicker. The sauce, finished 
with grapes and currants, is flavorful and lends itself to a party setting. 
</P>
<P>
After the turkey is sauteed, it can be kept for at least one-half hour in a 
200-degree oven or for one hour in a 180-degree oven. Any juices that emerge 
during cooking may be added to the sauce. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TURKEY STEAKS WITH GRAPE AND CURRANT SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
(From "A Fare That Fits") 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
6 (6-ounce) turkey breast steaks, cut about 1/2-inch thick 
</P>
<P>
2/3 cup chopped onion 
</P>
<P>
1 cup chopped leeks 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar 
</P>

</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups Poultry Brown Base Sauce 
</P>
<P>
2 cups seedless green grapes 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup dry currants 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons chopped chives for garnish 
</P>
<P>
Heat oil in heavy skillet over high heat. When hot, add turkey steaks and cook 
2 to 3 minutes. Turn and continue cooking another 2 to 3 minutes. Remove while 
still undercooked, transfer to gratin dish and place in 200-degree oven. 
</P>
<P>
Add onion and leeks to skillet and saute 2 minutes. Add vinegars and cook until 
almost evaporated. Add Poultry Brown Base Sauce, grapes, currants, salt and 
pepper. Boil 2 to 3 minutes, until sauce thickens slightly. Add any juices that 
have accumulated around turkey steaks in oven. 
</P>
<P>
Arrange turkey steaks on platter, cover with sauce and sprinkle with chives. 
Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Poultry Brown Base Sauce 
</P>
<P>
1 (14 1/2-ounce) can chicken broth 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon cornstarch 
</P>

NEW LEGISLATION TO DEAL WITH HATE CRIMES IN UNITED STATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roche would have us believe that racism and ethnic and religious bigotry have 
long since vanished from American society, evidenced by the fact that members 
of various groups are represented among the wealthy and that "even the chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is black." Is Roche thereby suggesting that as a 
result of the presence of blacks in high appointed offices and the acquisition 
of material success by some minorities that crimes should no longer concern us?

<P>
Roche misinterprets the impetus for the Hate Crimes Statistics Act. Crimes 
impelled by bias have a special emotional and psychological impact on the 
victim and the victim's community. They can lead to the intimidation of others 
in that community, causing them to feel isolated and unprotected by the law. 
The damage done by bias crimes cannot be measured solely in terms of physical 
injuries or by dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, prejudice and hatred cannot be legislated or prosecuted out of 
existence, but at the very least, the enactment of this kind of legislation 
will demonstrate to the community that law enforcement officials have a genuine 
interest in the problem of bias crimes and a stake in vigorously pursuing the 
offenders.

WORK FOR PRISONERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to David Glidden's column "Put Inmates to Work, Make Prison 
Produce," Opinion, April 1: 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Glidden has no contact with prisons or their inmates. Prison slave 
labor is alive and well, it is called UNICOR, the Federal Prison Industries. 
Prisoners are paid from 22 cents per hour to $1.10 per hour to produce goods 
for the military (in direct competition with "major corporations"), the 
judicial branch of government and prisons themselves. It is a 
multimillion-dollar industry. UNICOR makes military uniforms, sheets, curtains, 
furniture, cables used on aircraft carriers, safety glasses/goggles, business 
forms, etc. Part of the profits are used to fund the education programs at all 
federal prisons. 
</P>
<P>
I have a master's degree in education. I taught school for 10 years. When I was 
arrested, I was an executive assistant at a concert company. I have no prior 
arrests. I've never been in trouble. I am 42 years old, white, female. I teach 
the GED program to fellow inmates who are helping themselves to be more 
productive when they leave here. My crime -- I unwittingly carried 2 kilos of 
cocaine from Los Angeles to Seattle by air. My sentence -- 8 years, 1 month 
with no possibility of parole. We are not "caged animals." We don't live 
"passively like domestic pets." We work very hard. Before teaching GED, I 
worked in the prison kitchen cleaning dishes, floors and pots and pans. For 98 
hours of work, I was paid $10.78. Candy bars cost 55 cents and copies cost 15 
cents a piece. 
</P>
<P>
I am not "plotting" my next crime. I did not plot the last one. I have 
discovered many women like myself, who were working, trying to make ends met, 
but ended up supplementing their income. We are not waiting for our next 
opportunity "to prey on society." We want to go home and take care of our 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, if inmates had been given decent-paying jobs, they would have had the 
"byproduct of self-respect," and never been incarcerated. It costs $25,000 per 
year to keep me in prison; that is more money than I ever made teaching school.

NEW LEGISLATION TO DEAL WITH HATE CRIMES IN UNITED STATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Roche ("Is America Truly a Society of Hate?" Op-Ed Page, April 8) needs 
to come out from behind the protective walls of his "private, liberal arts 
institution" and view the world as it really is. Roche seems bent on 
establishing different levels of prejudice that warrant varying degrees of 
outrage (or tolerance). 
</P>
<P>
Society should be repulsed at the senseless beating of any individual 
regardless of whether that person is black, Jewish or gay. 
</P>
<P>
Does Roche really believe that racism is passe because a black has advanced to 
become chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff? That's like saying a black family 
who comes home to find a cross burning on their lawn should brush it off 
because Bill Cosby is rich and has one of the most popular shows on television. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the Hate Crimes Statistics Act is not to flood the court system. 
This legislation is needed to wipe away the mask of denial that most Americans 
have about the true level of bigotry in this country. After all, Gov. George 
Deukmejian was able to veto the landmark bill (outlawing discrimination in 
housing and employment based on sexual orientation) because he claimed there 
was no evidence that such discrimination existed. This in a society where the 
Supreme Court has legally sanctioned second-class status for homosexuals and a 
Texas judge hands out a lesser sentence to two young men because their murder 
victim was gay. Where is the justice in that?

SOVIET, EAST GERMAN APOLOGIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's remarkable and long overdue that East Germany openly acknowledges and 
apologizes for the horrors it perpetrated against Jews and others during the 
Nazi era. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder if it will ever be possible for our own country to officially 
acknowledge and apologize for the horrors we visited on the blacks brought as 
slaves from Africa, the destruction of the Indians, and the conquest of 
northern Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
We have begun to make restitution to the Japanese unjustly interned during 
World War II -- also along delayed and still blocked. Can we now go a step 
farther and do the same for the other victims of American history?

NEW LEGISLATION TO DEAL WITH HATE CRIMES IN UNITED STATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roche, a college president, shows a surprising ignorance regarding hate crime. 
Contrary to his claim, no "new categories of criminal activity" have been 
created. 
</P>
<P>
The definitions of hate crime used by the Los Angeles County Commission on 
Human Relations for the past decade simply identify those violations of 
existing law (assault, arson, malicious mischief, etc.) that are based on a 
victim's race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
These definitions have been adopted by local law enforcement agencies, and for 
statewide police training. 
</P>
<P>
The California and U.S. attorneys general have yet to establish hate crime 
definitions, in response to recent legislation, but it seems likely that their 
definitions will be similar. 
</P>
<P>
Roche also has difficulty distinguishing among theology, prejudice and crime. 
</P>
<P>
He believes that people simply "prefer" one sexual orientation over another, 
and this somehow leads him to conclude that crimes against gays and lesbians 
are less serious than crimes against followers of a particular religious faith, 
although his logic here is unclear.

BEST BETS: CONEJO VALLEY DAYS FESTIVAL UNDER WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Rabbits, Oaks and Good Old Folks." No, it's not the title of a nursery rhyme 
you might have heard in preschool, but it is the theme of this year's Conejo 
Valley Days. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 40 years Conejo Valley residents have participated in the annual 
event that features attractions such as parades, rodeos and a carnival. 
</P>
<P>
The celebration of Conejo Valley's heritage, which began Wednesday, will 
continue through Sunday at the Conejo Creek Park on Janss Road, off Moorpark 
Freeway in Thousand Oaks. A volunteer-based effort, Conejo Valley Day is the 
principal fund-raising vehicle for more than 200 service clubs, charities and 
organizations in the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The following is a list of events and activities scheduled at the main site 
through Sunday. Hours: today 5 to 10 p.m., Friday 5 p.m. to midnight, Saturday 
noon to midnight and Sunday noon to 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Carnival attractions will include a double ferris wheel and other rides. Bingo 
games will be offered, and the Country Fair will feature numerous arts and 
crafts booths. Entertainment will include country music and other acts playing 
on an outdoor stage. 
</P>
<P>
Admission to the site for adults, $2.50; students, $2; children 7 to 12, $1; 
and children 6 and under, free. 
</P>
<P>
A highlight of Conejo Valley Days are two rodeos, including a junior event for 
ages 5 to 18. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, the juniors will compete from noon to 5 p.m., with the main portion 
scheduled from 7 to 11 p.m. Goat tying, dummy roping and pole bending are some 
of the events scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
The professionals will enter the arena Saturday (1:30 to 4:30 p.m.) and Sunday 
(1 to 4 p.m.). Events will include bull riding and calf roping. Rodeo admission 
will be free. 
</P>
<P>
The Conejo Valley Days Parade will begin at 9 a.m. Saturday at Auburn Court and 
proceed west on Thousand Oaks Boulevard to Los Feliz Drive.

BEST BETS: AZTEC WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Feeling cultural? El Concilio del Condado de Ventura will host "Weekend of 
Culture" Saturday and Sunday for those interested in experiencing poetry and 
the traditional dances of the Aztec people. 
</P>
<P>
The event is being held to dedicate a mural by Jaime Estrada and Michael Mora 
at El Concilio del Condado in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Festivities begin with an evening of American Indian music and poetry at 8 p.m. 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Featured artists will be American Indian poet/activist John Trudell and 
drummer/singer Quiltman. 
</P>
<P>
As the performing group Tribal Voice, the duo have won national acclaim for 
their most recent recording, ". . . but this isn't El Salvador." 
</P>
<P>
Trudell and Quiltman set messages on themes such as pop culture, politics, and 
romantic images to traditional American Indian drums. 
</P>
<P>
Trudell was national chairman of the American Indian Movement from 1973 to 1979 
and participated in the occupation of Alcatraz Island in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Featured in the evening will be Latino poet and musician Jose Montoya of the 
group The Royal Chicano Air Force. Poet Luzma Espinosa, the Santa Paula 
coordinator of the Aztec dance group Xitlalli will share her work. 
</P>
<P>
A $5 donation is requested for the evening. 
</P>
<P>
The mural dedication will be held at noon Sunday. The celebration will feature 
Xitlalli. Adorned in traditional attire and headdress, dancers from the San 
Francisco and Sacramento chapters of the group will perform. 
</P>
<P>
Also performing Aztec dance routines will be Xipe Totece from Los Angeles. 
Providing Mexican folk music will be the trio Vida y Ensueno. 
</P>
<P>
The mural is a three-piece creation. It consists of the following: "All My 
Relations," a traditional native American scene; "Let the Music Set You Free," 
a tribute to contemporary Latino artists; and "Coyote Places the Stars," a 
futuristic piece. 
</P>
<P>
There is no charge for Sunday events. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Concilio Oxnard office is at 528 South A St., Oxnard. For more

RESTAURANT REVIEW MEXICAN; 
</P>
<P>
CASA DE SEVILLA'S FRIENDS STILL CALL IT PETE'S PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID GOLDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If it's a restaurant with a name such as Casa de Sevilla, it's got to be 
Mexican or Spanish. Right? 
</P>
<P>
Especially if it's in a less-than-distinctive neighborhood . . . across the 
street from the Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
But as anyone who's spent any time in Santa Barbara knows, Casa de Sevilla is 
no run-of-the-mill Mexican restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
It is the longtime home of the Old Guard where steaks and chops and seafood 
make up the house cuisine. And it may be the only place on the South Coast 
where there is an "A" room: the red one to the right. (The small, added-on 
porch areas, with tables by the fireplace, are actually the most intimate 
tables.) It's also the kind of restaurant in which you almost always overhear 
the phrase, "My Dad used to take me here when I was a kid." 
</P>
<P>
Walking into Casa de Sevilla, you find yourself in the midst of a bunch of 
dressy blue blazers. These are people from affluent places such as Montecito, 
Hope Ranch and Ojai who've been coming here for 50 years. And leaning against 
the bar might be Howard Duff or John Ireland or other members of the local 
movie contingent. 
</P>
<P>
But the blue blazers haven't really come to the Casa de Sevilla. They've come 
to Pete's. Although Pete hasn't owned the place for 33 years, it's still Pete's 
to many of its customers. Butch and Birgitta have owned it for the last 27 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Is it too soon to begin calling it Butch's? 
</P>
<P>
Not much has changed over the years in decor or menu. The prices, of course, 
have kept up with the times. And recently, the bullfight posters that have 
always been on the walls were restored. 
</P>
<P>
It is true that the most popular appetizer, the chile con queso, is Mexican -- 
almost a chile relleno, but not quite (the pepper seeds are removed). Gazpacho 
and ceviche are also among the appetizers, and you can order enchiladas or 
poached chicken in Spanish sauce. Stick to these dishes and you'll eat well for 
about $12 to $15 a person. 
</P>
<P>
For spareribs or a veal chop, you'll pay more -- about $22 and $23. But the 
meat is barbecued to order, very simply, and the choice pork back ribs are done 
in a light, distinctive sauce. 
</P>
<P>
More than meat, however, the restaurant quite properly puts its main emphasis 
on seafood. There is probably no place on the South Coast where I've found 
better fish. Or, for that matter, fish as well-prepared. 
</P>
<P>
The abalone, which in these days of shellfish inflation can completely distort 
one's bill, is lightly breaded and sauteed. It's $30 and enormously popular, 
which is interesting, since it costs nearly double most of the other seafood 
entrees. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh fish is grilled very simply -- and it's not overcooked. Portions are 
generous, but you never know whether the catch will be thick or thin. Butch 
says it all depends on how the fish are coming in. You may get an inch-thick 
swordfish ($16) or a soft, flaky barbecued salmon ($15). A vegetable and a 
salad are included (but don't get excited about the salad). 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the longevity of the waitresses (no serving men in these rooms) is an 
indication of how good the service is. Leona, for instance, has been at the 
restaurant 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
But Helen, who retired several years ago, had been around for 56 years! 
</P>
<P>
This is one of the last Bastions of Empire and it still does a fine job. 
</P>
<P>
 Casa de Sevilla, 428 Chapala St., Santa Barbara. (805) 966-4370. Open Tuesday 
through Saturday for lunch noon to 2 p.m.; dinner 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. Full bar, 
reservations accepted. Major credit cards accepted. Dinner for two, food only, 
$32-$50.

HAYRIDES, 'BUSHWHACKINGS' AND 'GUNFIGHTS' ADD TO THE WILD WEST ATMOSPHERE AT 
RANCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pretend you're part of a group en route to a birthday party that will take 
place at a ranch. 
</P>
<P>
As you pull into the ranch driveway, your group gets bushwhacked by half a 
dozen cowboys who come charging down the road on horseback, yelling and 
shooting their guns in the air. They take you to a neighboring ranch, put you 
on a hayride and force-feed you homemade chili and corn bread. 
</P>
<P>
Not a bad fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
And one that the Matchmaker Ranch in Santa Paula is doing its best to make come 
true. 
</P>
<P>
Kidnap victims are taken to adjacent Cummings Ranch as soon as they arrive at 
the Matchmaker. They're put in a yellow wagon ankle deep in hay, with three or 
four bales artfully arranged. 
</P>
<P>
Escorts are "cowboys" in full regalia -- hats, bandannas, chaps -- who lead 
double lives as baseball coaches, counselors, off-shore welders and 
construction foremen. Being a cowboy is something he does in his spare time, 
said Elwood White, a would-be desperado from Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
A singer tags along and provides entertainment by warbling songs such as 
"Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys" and "Cowboys Ain't 
Supposed to Cry." He has a small index card taped to his guitar that he uses as 
a cheat sheet. "I get mixed up sometimes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The wagon is pulled by a pair of Belgium horses and the driver is a 
grizzled-looking character nicknamed "Runaway." The cowboy making introductions 
drawls, "Ah don't wanna scare anyone, but the driver's name is Runaway. . . . 
None of them highway rules apply heah." The wagon goes at a brisk enough pace 
to cause a thin breeze, about 7 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The trail leads through part of the 500-acre Cummings Ranch and visitors view 
large fields of green oat hay. The entire trip, which lasts a little over an 
hour, consists of going up a trail to a loop and returning to the ranch 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
"It was worthwhile just to see the valley," said hijackee Ed Mattie, 64, of 
Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
After the hayride, visitors are returned to Matchmaker Ranch and fed. Depending 
on whether the occasion is a birthday party, wedding or office picnic, the food 
may be catered or prepared at the ranch, said owner Leslie Slade. Tossed green 
salad, chili and corn bread with honey are examples of Slade's culinary skills. 
</P>
<P>
During dinner a gunfight is staged, using blanks, of course. "We usually 
improvise. . . . We rehearse maybe five minutes beforehand," said Kurt Kenyon 
of Santa Paula, a correction officer at the Santa Paula Jail when he isn't 
being a cowboy. On this particular night, Kenyon shot and "killed" a man for 
stealing his horse. 
</P>
<P>
To contribute to the atmosphere of the Old West, the barn at Matchmaker Ranch 
has a dilapidated piano against one wall, chopped wood in another corner and 
cattle skulls hanging from the walls. A red tablecloth, poker table and a 
newspaper advertising the California gold rush are also relics of a bygone era. 
</P>
<P>
Slade said she has done four hayrides and 15 parties so far and each one is 
slightly different, depending on the group's tastes. There's a minimum of 25 
people and a maximum of 300, and prices are about $55 per person. Call (805) 
525-2250.

MR. OTA'S CORSAGE CLASS LEARNS TO TIE A BOW, BUT A NEWCOMER JUST GETS A CASE OF 
THE TITTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They all laughed when you sat down to learn flower arranging. 
</P>
<P>
Not overt belly-laughs, but tiny titters, circulating like so many aphids in a 
Ventura College classroom. Around the room sat two dozen aspiring arranging 
women. 
</P>
<P>
The room was cool, and stood hard by the college greenhouse. The women, 20ish 
to 60ish but dexterous to the last one, were there to listen and practice as 
florist Ron Ota explained the subtleties of corsage construction. 
</P>
<P>
So were you. You, however, had no knowledge of flowers and only limited 
hand-to-eye coordination. The sure-fingered women around the room on this 
Tuesday night were on their fourth installment of a six-session course. Hence 
the titters, which would multiply as the evening progressed. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight, we're going to do corsages," said Ota, a compact man with a curly 
perm and mustache who spends most of his time running the Flower Power Florist 
shop on North Las Posas Road in Camarillo. "But to do corsages, you have to 
know bows, so we're going to start with bows. Take 10 of the wires, please." 
</P>
<P>
The wires -- 24-inch sections of green metal -- came around, and everyone took 
a share. 
</P>
<P>
"Number 24 Wire," scribbled Renee Clark of Ventura in her notebook. She had 
come on the recommendation of a friend, and because her son has a prom coming 
up. Soon she and the rest were wrestling with short sections of green floral 
tape, trying to wrap them delicately around their wires. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something that they've always wanted to do but they've never done," Ota 
said later about his students. 
</P>
<P>
Over the length of the course, they were scheduled to learn about vase 
arrangements, corsages and centerpieces, among other things. Maybe because of 
this countryside's agricultural character, Ota said, flower-friendliness seems 
to run high in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, a lot of people grow stuff in their yards," he said, "and they want to 
use some of the stuff that they grow, rather than just cutting the flowers and 
dropping them in a vase." 
</P>
<P>
Ota, a florist since 1964, said he started teaching a single course in 1982, 
"and I'd have to really fight to get 15 or 20 people. Now I get 30 or 40." 
</P>
<P>
He offers courses occasionally through community services programs at Oxnard 
and Ventura colleges, as well as the county public school system, usually 
charging $35 per six-session course, plus $6 to $12 weekly for materials. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a really good reputation," said Renee Clark. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the class in the area," said Terri Campbell of Ojai. "Everyone knows 
that this is the class to take." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it may be the only one there is. Employees at six different florist's 
shops around the county knew of no flower-arranging courses outside those Ota 
offers. 
</P>
<P>
Ota started an advanced course at Oxnard College today, and is tentatively 
scheduled to lead a beginner's class in the community services division of 
Oxnard College starting June 21. Registration opens after release of the summer 
schedule next month. 
</P>
<P>
So this was a rare and valuable experience, all this tugging, twisting and 
tying. And eventually, there were even roses and some white flowers with floppy 
petals, which you were informed, were cymbidiums. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm flunking bow," muttered a pessimist across the room. 
</P>
<P>
"This is supposed to be a stress-free class," complained another. 
</P>
<P>
"My hand doesn't like doing that," said Clark after a few minutes of ribbon 
work. But by then her hands were dancing that same mysterious little dance that 
Ota's had when he demonstrated in front of the room. 
</P>
<P>
Your hands, accustomed to tasks no more demanding than the feeding of parking 
meters, were less certain. Adding a ribbon to this equation only made matters 
more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Terri Campbell, a back-yard gardener who had driven down from Ojai for the 
course, looked on with alarm. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll come around and help us," she said gently. "It looks pretty complicated, 
but. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
But nothing. It was complicated. And most of the others had already spent a 
fair amount of time in the company of flowers. When Ota had asked for a show of 
hands earlier in the course, some had even expressed interest in floristry as a 
line of work. 
</P>
<P>
There were others who had hidden advantages. Lorraine Yzquierdo of Carpinteria 
and Betty Hewitt of Ventura both sculpted their flowers with precision and 
grace -- then confessed that by day they do detail work for a manufacturer of 
surgical implants in Goleta. Dexterity was their business. 
</P>
<P>
And dexterity, as the two-hour class neared its conclusion, was increasingly 
elusive. When the instructor made his final rounds, you raised a gnarled wad of 
ribbon and flower. 
</P>
<P>
"No," said Ota. "No, no, no." And in 20 seconds he had stripped down and 
rebuilt the wad into something very like a corsage. He didn't do this to any of 
the others. 
</P>
<P>
"Well," said Carolee Tibbitts of Ojai, as classmates filed past to preserve 
their corsages in plastic containers, "at least now you can tie a good bow." 
</P>
<P>
The evening could have ended there, on an optimistic note. But then Terri 
Campbell, who had been paying closer attention, had to interrupt. 
</P>
<P>
"No," she said. "He cannot tie a good bow." 
</P>

EXHIBIT COMPARES PHOTOS OF TODAY, YESTERDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In its early days, said art curator Beth Goldberg, photography was thought of 
as a completely objective art form -- what you saw was what you got. But over 
time, this belief began to fade. Photographers, like the rest of society, 
proved to have their own biases that were reflected in their work. 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, Goldberg, the curator at Sonoma State University's Art 
Gallery, has put together what she calls a semi-historical photo exhibit by 
comparing and contrasting 20 contemporary photos with 20 older ones. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit, titled "Photos Updated: Similar Images/Dissimilar Motives," will 
arrive at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg says that by looking at contemporary imitations of older photos, 
changes in society's beliefs over time become clearer. Although the subjects 
are similar, the underlying message that the photos are trying to convey or the 
response they are trying to elicit can be quite different. 
</P>
<P>
In the exhibit, Goldberg juxtaposes the 1981 Judy Dater nude self-portrait with 
the 1910 Ann Brigman nude. 
</P>
<P>
"Dater's photos are very explicit and confrontive. She's very into exploring 
herself," Goldberg said. "She feels that stripping herself nude is a way of 
looking into herself." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Brigman's photo is much more serene. 
</P>
<P>
"She was working out of the romantic period," Goldberg said. "Even in the 
techniques, the soft focus, she shows the female nude coming out of a crevice 
in a rock. It's modest, you don't see anything. The way she molds into the 
landscape was the tradition of the time. She makes the photo look like fine art 
by softening the focus." 
</P>
<P>
As with Dater's shot, most of the newer photos in the exhibit were made to 
imitate the older ones and were not just coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
"Contemporary photographers are very much indebted to the earlier ones," 
Goldberg said, "at the same time they are critiquing them. They want to break 
away, disregard the conventions and do something new." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit will run through June 17. The museum is at 1130 State St. Gallery 
hours are 11 a.m.-5 p.m. (Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday), 11 a.m.-9 
p.m. (Thursday), noon-5 p.m. (Sunday). Admission is $3 for adults, $1.50 for 
children, except Thursdays when admission is free. Call 963-4364 for more 
information. 
</P>
<P>
If you want music with an international flavor you may want to check out what 
the Lobero Theatre has scheduled over the next couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, Brazilian musician Egberto Gismonti and his quartet will perform 
in a benefit celebration of the 10th anniversary of The Society of Jazz and 
World Music. 
</P>
<P>
Gismonti's music reflects his early classical training combined with the sounds 
learned during time spent with the Xingu Indians of the Amazon basin. He plays 
the piano and guitar, along with traditional Amazonian instruments. 
</P>
<P>
The show begins at 8 p.m. Tickets are $16 and $26, which includes a reception 
for Gismonti after the show. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, French violinist Christophe Boulier will make his American debut 
in a concert sponsored by the Music Academy of the West. He will perform works 
by Cesar Franck, Olivier Messiaen, Johannes Brahms and Nicolo Paganini. 
</P>
<P>
Boulier, now 25, demonstrated his musical talent early. At the age of 5 he 
began studying violin at the National Conservatory of Aubervilliers and just 
two years later appeared as a soloist with the French Radio Orchestra. By age 
10 he had won numerous awards and had already made two television appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Show time is 8 p.m. Tickets are $16.50 and $18.50. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara's 12th annual Festival of the Arts will close this weekend with a 
flurry of activities. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, more than 100 local artists will open their studios to the public 
from 11 a.m.-5 p.m. "Anybody will be able to just walk in," said festival 
director Tanika Ossman. "People like to go into sculptors' studios." 
</P>
<P>
Then on Sunday, it's the grand finale. Three venues -- El Presidio de Santa 
Barbara State Historic Park, de la Guerra Plaza and the Santa Barbara 
Historical Museum -- will have live, continuous music and other performing arts 
from 11 a.m.-6 p.m. The music will range from jazz to Celtic to 
country-and-western. There also will be poetry reading, story-telling, 
children's activities and international food. 
</P>
<P>
Whoopi Goldberg in the company of the Bard? Well, maybe that's not how the 
movie star/comedian is normally perceived, but at least on Saturday night she 
will be in a largely classical mode in "So Many People Have Heads: An Evening 
of Song, Prose and Verse" at UC Santa Barbara's Campbell Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg will join Patrick Stewart ( Capt. Picard in "Star Trek" and a former 
member of the Royal Shakespeare Company) and Charles Keating (a Broadway, 
television and Shakespearean actor). The three performers will read from an 
eclectic mix that includes the works of James Joyce, Jules Feiffer, Monty 
Python, Robert Burns and Albert Camus. 
</P>
<P>
The performance is a benefit for ACTER (A Center for Theater Education and 
Research). Headquartered at UCSB, the organization is responsible for bringing 
Shakespearean actors to universities throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Show time is 7:30 p.m. Tickets are $20 and they are going fast. Call 961-3535.

PANEL APPROVES TRIAL BOOZE BAN AT LA JOLLA BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: ACTION BY A CITY COUNCIL COMMITTEE IS A RESPONSE TO COMPLAINTS OF 
DRUNKENNESS AND ROWDY BEHAVIOR AT BEACHES AND PARKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Venturing more tentatively into the explosive subject of alcohol consumption at 
San Diego beaches and parks, a City Council committee Wednesday agreed to an 
experimental six-month booze ban at La Jolla Shores beach and a 
yet-unidentified park in the city's 3rd Council District. 
</P>
<P>
The alcohol ban, which must receive approval of the full council, would contain 
an exemption allowing organized groups to imbibe at outings for which they 
obtain a city permit. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot project approved by the council's Public Facilities and Recreation 
Committee is a scaled-back version of the citywide drinking prohibition the 
same five council members sprang on the public without warning in a unanimous 
December vote. 
</P>
<P>
That proposal was rejected by the full council in January after a huge public 
outcry, with all five committee members -- Abbe Wolfsheimer, John Hartley, 
Bruce Henderson, Judy McCarty and Bob Filner -- reversing themselves and voting 
to rescind the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, grateful La Jolla Shores residents, who have complained of crime, 
noise and property damage they say is caused by drunken revelers, endorsed the 
committee's latest decision, which came on a 4-1 vote, with only Filner 
dissenting. 
</P>
<P>
Disappointed Mission Beach activists -- who wanted the alcohol ban extended to 
their neighborhoods but ran into opposition from their councilman, Henderson -- 
saw the move as a prelude to a wider anti-alcohol policy. 
</P>
<P>
"This is certainly a start in the right direction," said Brian O'Donnell, a La 
Jolla Shores resident who testified for the drinking ban Wednesday. "But I 
think they will ultimately come to some form of citywide ban." 
</P>
<P>
"It's better than nothing," said Jeanne Lenhart-Wright of Mission Beach. 
"They'll see how beneficial it is." 
</P>
<P>
In the months since January's council vote, City Manager John Lockwood's office 
surveyed community groups and held three public forums, determining that only 
21% of 675 respondents favored an alcohol ban in parks, and 24% wanted one at 
beaches. In a report, Deputy City Manager Coleman Conrad opposed a citywide 
drinking ban. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a political problem," Councilman Judy McCarty said Wednesday. "These 
(advocates of the drinking ban) have to recognize that all hell broke loose 
when it was proposed last time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult to move on a full ban at this time, knowing that so many 
people oppose a full ban," McCarty added. 
</P>
<P>
Only Councilman John Hartley voiced support for a citywide ban Wednesday, but 
he settled for assurances that part of the pilot project would be carried out 
in a park in his district, most likely City Heights Community Park or Colina 
del Sol Community Park in East San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an incredible problem," Hartley said. "We've really created an area of 
lawlessness at the beach, almost encouraging alcohol use at the beach." 
</P>
<P>
The ban at La Jolla Shores beach also would extend to adjacent Kellogg Park. 
The council also approved a package of other beach and park regulations, 
including recommendations for high priorities on night police coverage and a 
recommendation to establish an unarmed park ranger program. Filner's dissent on 
the alcohol ban was based on his belief that this package was adequate to 
control public drunkenness. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to Henderson's reluctance to ban drinking at Mission Beach, 
Wolfsheimer eagerly proposed the protection for the La Jolla beach in her 
district. 
</P>
<P>
"When someone is already drunk, lying on a park or beach, you can't take them 
to jail because there is no jail space," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson maintained that better enforcement of existing public drinking 
regulations would best serve Mission Beach without depriving city residents 
unable to live near the beach of the enjoyment of a beer or glass of wine 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had my druthers, we would deal with the abusers and let the decent people 
drink at the beach," he said. Henderson nevertheless voted for the pilot 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Under the pilot project, the city would beef up enforcement of alcohol 
regulations at Mission Beach and compare the results with the alcohol ban at La 
Jolla Shores and the inland park. Although most Southern California communities 
already prohibit alcohol consumption at beaches, the city's existing 
restrictions ban drinking between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. at beaches north of the 
Mission Bay channel entrance and prohibit alcohol possession on Santa Clara 
point in Mission Bay park. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Beach parking lots have been closed at night because of complaints of 
rowdiness, gang activity and drug and alcohol use. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor will oppose even the pilot project when the issue 
reaches the full City Council, said Paul Downey, O'Connor's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"She does not want to infringe upon the rights of the vast majority of 
responsible drinkers because a small minority cannot control their drinking," 
Downey said. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance will come back to the committee May 23, after city staff members 
develop procedures for the exemption permits and select an inland park for the 
experiment. If approved again, the measure will go to the full City Council for 
consideration.

MURDER CHARGE EXPECTED IN GIRL'S FREEWAY DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The district attorney's office is expected to file murder charges today against 
a 28-year-old City Heights man, suspected of throwing a 12-year-old girl from a 
pickup truck on Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Hector Garcia, being held without bail in County Jail, is expected to be 
arraigned today in Municipal Court, said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Katz. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that a witness saw a girl with a man in a red Toyota truck with 
oversized tires that was northbound about 60 m.p.h. in the slow lane of the 
freeway when he saw the girl lean toward the driver, the passenger door open 
and the girl tumble out. The girl landed on a service road about 50 feet north 
of the Old Town exit. She died of multiple injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Frank Martinez said on Wednesday that police filed the murder complaint 
with the district attorney's office because of "evidence which points to the 
fact that he pushed her out." Martinez, refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia was arrested Tuesday shortly before 4 a.m. at his home, 3439 45th St. 
Police also found a 1989 red Toyota pickup with large tires. 
</P>
<P>
Police obtained a search warrant based on information from the victim's 
relatives, who knew the suspect. The female relatives, ages 14 and 17, 
introduced Garcia to the victim early Sunday morning, after they left the 20th 
anniversary celebration of Chicano Park in Barrio Logan on Sunday, according to 
the victim's mother, Sulema Rodriguez.

LAWSUIT ACCUSES ESCONDIDO OFFICERS OF THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Escondido couple sued the Escondido Police Department Wednesday, charging 
officers with stealing $2,500 and a $700 watch during a fruitless 6 1/2-hour 
search of their home for narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
Edgar Maloney, 64, and his wife, Johanna, 61, said Officers Barry Sweeney, 
Ralph Grapoli and Glen Kirkpatrick raided their home on April 21, 1989, armed 
with a search warrant and looking for drugs. No drugs were found and no charges 
were filed against the Maloneys, but the officers seized about $13,000 in cash 
and a watch belonging to Mrs. Maloney. 
</P>
<P>
According to the lawsuit filed in Vista Superior Court, $2,500 that Sweeney 
allegedly took from the couple's son, Bryan, and the watch taken from Mrs. 
Maloney are still missing. 
</P>
<P>
The officers did not give the family an inventory of the items taken from the 
house, said the lawsuit. The suit also alleged that, when the Maloneys were 
allowed to retrieve some items taken from their home, Escondido officers 
refused to sign a receipt for the items. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit called the search illegal and malicious and also names Chief 
Vincent Jimno and the city as defendants. Jimno and other Escondido police 
officials did not return phone calls. In an interview with The Times last year, 
Edgar Maloney said he and his wife were entertaining two couples on the day of 
the raid. He said he was suddenly confronted in a hallway of his home by two 
strangers pointing guns at him. The men did not identify themselves as 
narcotics officers right away, Maloney said. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit comes in the wake of three active investigations of Sweeney by 
different law enforcement agencies. The San Diego County district attorney and 
FBI are investigating allegations of wrongdoing by Sweeney and other Escondido 
police officers that have been made by several people. The allegations range 
from stealing to lying and planting evidence. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Escondido police officials said last week that the district 
attorney's office recommended that Escondido conduct an internal investigation 
of Sweeney. In a telephone interview last week, Sweeney declined to comment on 
the investigations on the advice of his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Maloney said he has an auto dealer's license. He said the cash seized at his 
home came from the sale of a car and a truck, and a deposit placed on another 
car days before the search warrant was served on his home. Last month, the 
Escondido City Council rejected a claim submitted by the Maloneys, a precursor 
to Wednesday's lawsuit.

BRODERICK ATTORNEY VOWS TO CHALLENGE ALL 69 JUDGES IN COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A motion to disqualify the entire Superior Court bench from presiding over the 
murder trial of Elisabeth Anne (Betty) Broderick was denied Wednesday, 
prompting her lawyer and the prosecutor to predict that the proceedings may be 
delayed. 
</P>
<P>
Jack M. Earley, Broderick's attorney, had contended that no San Diego judge 
could appear unbiased in his client's murder trial because one of the victims, 
her ex-husband, was a prominent malpractice attorney and part of San Diego's 
"close-knit" legal community. But San Diego Superior Court Judge Jesus 
Rodriguez ruled that he had no jurisdiction to disqualify the bench and that 
there were no legal grounds to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick, 42, is accused of murdering ex-husband Daniel T. Broderick III, 44, 
and his wife, Linda Kolkena Broderick, 28, early on the morning of Nov. 5. She 
has pleaded not guilty, and her trial has been set for July 16. 
</P>
<P>
But Earley said Rodriguez's ruling, which he plans to appeal in the 4th 
District Court of Appeals, might push that date back. Earley said that, if 
necessary, he is prepared to challenge the 69 Superior Court judges one by one. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm assuming that what the judge was saying was that, if there's 50 judges, we 
should have 50 hearings," he said. "Effectively, by their ruling, it's going to 
be at least a year and a half before we even get through the challenges. . . . 
They're saying that you can't do it once, even though that makes sense 
economically. They're saying I should go one judge at a time." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Kerry Wells said: "If they want to drag it out, this is a 
good way to do it, by challenging judge after judge. Cases like this sometimes 
do take a long time to get to trial. Realistically, it could be a long time." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Earley's challenges would only last as long as he continued to win. 
Were he to challenge an individual San Diego County judge, that judge would be 
allowed to respond in writing and another judge would preside over a hearing to 
determine if the challenged judge was impartial. If the presiding judge ruled 
in Earley's favor, the case would be transferred to another San Diego judge and 
Earley would be free to challenge him, starting the process all over again. 
</P>
<P>
If the presiding judge ruled against Earley, however, the original judge would 
be allowed to hear the case. Then, Earley said, he would file a writ of appeal 
to the 4th District Court of Appeals. And he could also seek a change of venue 
motion. 
</P>
<P>
Wells said she is eager to get on with the case. 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, we have to have a judge hear this case," she said. "And my 
personal opinion is there are fair judges in San Diego County and there are 
fair judges every place else in the state, and I don't particularly care where 
we go. As long as both sides get in front of a fair judge." 
</P>
<P>
In a related matter, the 4th District Court has ruled that the appellate record 
of Betty and Daniel Broderick's divorce will be sealed, as were the original 
divorce records.

Bradford Warren Powers Jr., accused of murdering two and attempting to murder 
two more who were wounded in a rampage at Mission Bay Memorial Hospital, said 
Wednesday that he feels "ill inside" for the families of the victims but blames 
the hospital for the shootings because, he says, it negligently treated his 
father. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what I did was wrong -- there is no question about that. But there were 
circumstances beyond my control," Powers said in an interview with The Times in 
County Jail downtown, where he is being held on $2.5-million bail. "I admitted 
to the actual, you know, shootings. But my defense is based on the facts of 
what brought me to that point. 
</P>
<P>
"There is just so much a person can take. The hospital -- they were the most 
negligent. It's criminal negligence, to me, what they did to my father. And, if 
they hadn't been negligent, then this whole tragedy could have been avoided." 
</P>
<P>
Powers, 46, described himself as a gentle man who has never "punched with a 
closed fist," or aimed a gun at anyone "until this horrible, horrible 
incident." 
</P>
<P>
"I am the last person in the world to hurt anyone," he said. "I won't even swat 
a fly. If one lands on me, I blow it aside. Unless it's constantly irritating 
me, landing on me, landing on me. And then maybe I smash the poor guy." 
</P>
<P>
Something "snapped," Powers said, after the death of his father, Brad Powers 
Sr., 75, who had gone to the hospital's emergency room twice in two days. On 
Powers Sr.'s second visit, doctors say, they did everything possible but were 
unable to save the elder man, a well-known architectural illustrator who died 
April 14 after suffering an abdominal aneurysm and a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
Informed in the emergency room's waiting area of his father's death, Powers 
became angry. He returned to the family's La Jolla home, where he lived with 
his parents and his two children. There, he said, he polished off a 25.4-ounce 
bottle of vodka and chased it down with water. 
</P>
<P>
Powers returned to the hospital emergency room eight hours after his father's 
death and fired eight rounds with a .22-caliber revolver, police say. A nurse 
and student medical trainee were killed; a doctor and a patient's father were 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
"I was drinking to relax, and it just magnified the problem," Powers said 
Wednesday. "I might as well tell you now, I feel ill every day, constantly ill 
inside to think that I did what I did to these people. I did it, but I wasn't 
in my right state of mind with that damn vodka." 
</P>
<P>
Police say that Powers did not appear to be under the influence of any drugs or 
medication when he turned himself in to Oceanside police an hour after the 
killings. They say a blood test showed that he was not drunk -- a fact that 
Powers hotly disputes. Powers said that, although he could not remember the 
exact time of the shootings, he recalled that police did not test him until 12 
to 15 hours after he had been drinking. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had a chance to do it over, I wish to God that I never touched alcohol," 
Powers said. "Without the booze, that episode never would have happened. That 
goddamn alcohol is a real troublemaker when it's abused. And I abused it -- I 
needed to relax and calm down." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Powers, his mother, also said that her son's drinking triggered his 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a whole bottle of vodka. They said he was sober, but he was not sober. 
He was very drunk," said Mary Powers, 73. "He didn't know what he was doing." 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses say that, before the gunman opened fire, he screamed: "You killed my 
father!" 
</P>
<P>
Though not willing to discuss what he shouted in the hospital, Powers said, "I 
yelled something that will come out in the trial. I was pinpointed pretty much 
by what I said." 
</P>
<P>
About an hour after the shooting, Powers turned himself in to Oceanside police. 
After calling police headquarters from a pay phone, he waited at his Corvette 
for their arrival. 
</P>
<P>
"I realized that it was just a matter of time and they would get me on the 
freeway," Powers said. "I figured if they got me on the highway, they might 
blow me away. And I didn't want to take the car any further from home. I didn't 
want to drive it up to Oregon." 
</P>
<P>
Powers said he was concerned about jeopardizing his legal defense -- a 
preliminary hearing is scheduled for June -- but he agreed to speak with The 
Times on three separate occasions this week, once in person and twice on the 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
He said he didn't want to discuss how he might defend himself against the 
charges. But, between the alcohol and his grief over his father's death, he 
said, "It was temporary insanity. . . . When you go flipping out the way I did 
there, you don't realize that you don't know what you are doing." 
</P>
<P>
During his arraignment last week, Powers pleaded not guilty to two counts of 
murder and three of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, dressed in jail garb with his blond hair looking slightly 
disheveled, Powers appeared tired and said he was worried about his mother and 
his two children, ages 20 and 23. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Powers this week pledged to do all she could to help her son. "I'm really 
proud of Brad," she said. "He's raised two fine children, taken care of the 
house. . . . I think he was in a state of shock from having his father die." 
</P>
<P>
She and her son are bitter about the hospital's treatment of the elder Powers. 
</P>
<P>
"By God, I will always feel toward the hospital what I feel now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Powers Sr. had gone to the hospital emergency room April 13, complaining of 
shortness of breath. He was treated and released. Early the next morning, he 
returned to the hospital, complaining of abdominal pain. Doctors then 
discovered an abdominal aneurysm, a condition they said was not present the 
previous day. Telling the family that surgery was the elder Powers' only chance 
for life, doctors operated. But Powers Sr. suffered a heart attack and died on 
the operating table at 8:40 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Powers, Powers Sr.'s other son, told The Times last week that the 
family plans to file a malpractice suit against the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Simmons, spokesman for the hospital, said: "The care given to Mr. Powers 
was correct and appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Powers Jr., who spoke calmly throughout his interviews with The Times, said he 
could not accept his father's death. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just the most wonderful man a son could have. We shared every day 
together for years and years and years," Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
Powers, who has held no long-term employment, said he spent his days taking 
care of the yard, swimming pool, and household, which includes a collection of 
five dogs and 12 cats. He also did the shopping and cooking, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a pretty responsible fellow; just because you are not working a 
particular job doesn't mean you are not working. I work taking care of the 
household," Powers said. "I did everything I was able to do. I kept that 
household running. My father was unable to do anything but sit in his office, 
and he got his retirement cut off short -- real short." 
</P>
<P>
The family's pets meant a lot to him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I always loved animals. Animals never turn on you -- no matter what happens, 
they are totally devoted, dedicated," Powers said. "I treat people the way I 
always want to be treated. If you treat dogs that way, they are your lifelong 
friend. So that's why they are the best friends a person can have." 
</P>
<P>
Besides his interest in animals, Powers said, he enjoys participating in sports 
such as golf, football and tennis. He had not played golf in recent months 
because his back has been bothering him, he said. As a member of the Mission 
Bay Yacht Club, he won more than 50 sailing trophies over a 12-year period that 
began when he was 10, he said. His love of the sea led to a brief stint with 
the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
Powers suffered mental problems dating back 25 years, according to court 
records. In 1965, his father filed a petition in San Diego Superior Court to 
begin the process of having the young man tested for mental illness, with the 
possibility of having him committed to the custody of county authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Powers Jr., then 21, was single and unemployed. A report by a doctor said 
Powers Jr. "is in an acute psychotic episode and appears to be on the verge of 
violence," according to the father's petition. 
</P>
<P>
Two court-appointed doctors were scheduled to examine Powers Jr., but his 
father suddenly withdrew his petition, just five days after the request was 
filed. It is not known whether Powers had sought psychiatric care during the 
intervening years. 
</P>
<P>
Powers declined to discuss his mental condition: "That will all come out in 
court." 
</P>
<P>
Powers said he spends much of his time now thinking about his father and 
feeling bad for the families of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very, very horrible about the people, the families -- being that I went 
through the pain with my father what they are going through. We all know what 
the pain is like. It's a horrible, horrible tragedy," Powers said. "I can't 
bring those people back, but I can't bring my father back either."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DUARTE TO TEST STATE'S NEW WELLNESS GUIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Duarte, whose motto is "City of Health," has been selected by the 
state as the testing ground for a new Wellness Guide. 
</P>
<P>
A prototype of the guide, developed by the Office of Prevention of the state 
Department of Mental Health and UC Berkeley, was introduced Wednesday at a 
public health conference in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte is to start distributing the guides on June 9. 
</P>
<P>
Produced by the School of Public Health at UC Berkeley, the resource guide 
covers a broad range of health-related topics, including pregnancy, child care, 
physical fitness and aging. The four-year program has a budget of $600,000, 
state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte was chosen because of its involvement in the "Healthy Cities Project," 
introduced last year to promote community health projects.

START OF RECYCLING PROGRAM DELAYED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Fillmore City Council has delayed the inception of the city's first 
curbside recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
The council is waiting for the disposal company that proposed the program to 
come up with a fee schedule that allows people with small amounts of trash to 
pay less than those with large amounts. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal by Santa Clara Valley Disposal Co. is modeled on a recycling 
program in the city of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, at least 1,000 Fillmore homes would participate in a 
simplified recycling program that does not require separation of materials. 
</P>
<P>
A single plastic barrel would be provided to participating households. The 
barrels would be used for plastic containers marked "CA Redemption Value," 
glass and aluminum cans. Newspapers could be placed on top of the mixed 
material. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Roy Payne said the program was delayed pending the opening of a 
center where recyclable materials can be stored for marketing. 
</P>
<P>
"Recycling easily becomes a habit," Payne said. "I think we'll see good 
participation." 
</P>
<P>
The program could start as soon as July 1, Payne said. JANET BERGAMO

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PORT HUENEME;

<P>
SCHOOL TO BE DESIGNATED AN HISTORIC SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
One old school and the site of another won't just be old after today -- they'll 
be historic. 
</P>
<P>
The designation of historic status will be extended to an elementary school 
that has stood in Port Hueneme for 62 years and to the site of a four-room 
schoolhouse that was the city's first school. The actions will be taken by the 
Ventura County Cultural Heritage Board and the Hueneme School District. 
</P>
<P>
Hueneme Elementary School, a stately Spanish-style building constructed in 
1928, will be dedicated as a county historical landmark in a ceremony at 1:30 
p.m. today at the school. It will be held in conjunction with National Schools 
Week. 
</P>
<P>
A nearby playground where the old Hueneme Grammar School was located and where 
many of Port Hueneme's pioneers received their early education will be declared 
a county historical point of interest. 
</P>
<P>
The original frame grammar school was built in 1889 for $9,000, said Katherine 
Garner, board administrative assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Board chairwoman Dorothy Ramirez said the old school served as an unofficial 
town meeting place. 
</P>
<P>
"The schoolhouse was the central location for everybody," Ramirez said. "It was 
the community center because we didn't have a community center, so any event 
that was held would be held there." 
</P>
<P>
Walter Moranda, 75, attended the original school from 1924 to 1928. 
</P>
<P>
It had about 63 students in eight grades. A highlight of the school day was 
sounding a bell in the tower by pulling a cord that ran through classrooms on 
both floors, Moranda said. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember it very fondly," he said. "Each of the rooms had two grades, and 
with only eight grades, classes were pretty small." 
</P>
<P>
Moranda said students watched with excitement as the new concrete, Spanish-tile 
school was constructed beginning around 1927, and also watched without much 
regret shortly after as the old one was razed. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're happy with something new, you don't mind losing something old," 
Moranda said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hueneme Principal Eldon Mrstik said the old has blended well with the 
new at the present school, where several classrooms have been added and other 
renovations made since the building's construction. 
</P>
<P>
The school, at 345 N. 3rd St., will hold an open house beginning at 5 p.m.; a 
historical exhibit recounting the school's history will be displayed. Elaine K. 
Garber, a member of the school district board of trustees, will speak on the 
history of the school at 5:45 p.m., and the school's PTA will hold a spaghetti 
dinner beginning at 6 p.m. ADRIANNE GOODMAN

TORRANCE SETTLES SUIT OVER SLIDE SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET RAE-DUPREE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In possibly the largest negotiated settlement in city history, Torrance City 
Council members early Wednesday agreed to pay $2.26 million for a small patch 
of bluff-top land covered with bougainvillea vines. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement ends a four-year lawsuit in which homeowner Fred J. Smith charged 
that city officials improperly condemned his Hollywood Riviera house to 
stabilize a landslide on city property. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement left neither side in the dispute happy. 
</P>
<P>
City officials wondered how they will pay for it. Smith, still trying to adjust 
to the loss of a showplace home he and his late wife loved, would rather none 
of it ever happened. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement of Smith's lawsuit raises the city's total cost for the Via 
Corona/Vista Largo landslide to well over the $7 million mark. 
</P>
<P>
The 300-by-200-foot slide area first began to cause trouble on April 5, 1986, 
when it slipped down against former Mayor Albert Isen's house. City officials 
eventually paid Isen $465,000 for the loss of his house, which had to be 
demolished. 
</P>
<P>
The first slide, which continued for five days, eventually exposed the 
foundation of Smith's home. City engineers said the house would have to go. 
Smith's engineers said there were two possible ways to shore up the hillside 
without demolishing the house. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 21, 1986, the City Council voted unanimously to condemn the house, 
offering Smith $450,000 for it. Smith, protesting that the house was worth 
nearly twice that, tried to block the demolition. 
</P>
<P>
He filed an $11.5-million claim against the city after the house, which sat on 
a 14,000-square-foot lot, was torn down in November, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Torrence officials said they believe Wednesday's settlement to be the largest 
in the city's history, though they were unable to confirm that. Regardless, 
they were distressed by its size. 
</P>
<P>
"We set aside $1.3 million for this . . . so the rest is going to have to come 
from reserves," said Mayor Katy Geissert, who noted that the city carries no 
insurance to cover such losses. "It's the sort of thing where you have to heave 
a great sigh and do what you believe is best for the city. . . . We felt that 
under the circumstances, and considering what it would cost us to carry this 
further in the courts, it was prudent to settle." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Finance Director Ken Flewellyn said the additional $1 million 
probably will have to be taken from $9.5 million set aside as the estimated 
costs for other pending lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we're going to have to somehow establish more reserves (to 
compensate) for this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who has built a near-duplicate of the old house on a smaller lot just 
above the site where he once lived, said the amount of the settlement is 
deceptive. 
</P>
<P>
"It may sound big, but this is exactly what I've paid out, what this suit has 
cost me," he said. "The first thing I'm going to do is pay off all these debts 
I've incurred. . . . I just wanted to get this thing over with, get my money 
back, pay off my bills and put this all behind me." 
</P>
<P>
Given a choice, he said, Smith gladly would trade the money to have his old 
home back. 
</P>
<P>
From the spacious balcony of his new home, Smith gazes down on the land where 
he and his late wife, Ruth, lived for 26 years. All that remains is a 
blue-roofed Japanese pagoda, once situated next to a 16-foot waterfall and koi 
pond in a meticulously landscaped back yard, and a bare patch of land where the 
house once stood. City workers last month planted row upon row of bougainvillea 
vines there. 
</P>
<P>
The old site, one of the largest residential lots in the neighborhood, sits at 
the edge of a small point of land and commands a sweeping view south into Long 
Beach and north to Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
"It was our forever-and-ever home, and we didn't want to lose it," Smith said. 
"My wife was ill. She couldn't understand why she couldn't go home. And that 
hurts." 
</P>
<P>
Views also are spectacular from Smith's new house, which sits about 150 feet 
back from the old site on a smaller plot of land, but are not quite as 
expansive. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a retired mortician, bought the site of his new house for $235,000, then 
spent $485,000 trying to duplicate his old home. But he said his efforts fell 
short. 
</P>
<P>
"I took the old blueprints to an architect and said, 'Make it as close to the 
old one as you can,' " Smith said. "He did his best, but it is smaller." 
</P>
<P>
One of the features that had to be given up was the elaborate Japanese garden 
in the back. 
</P>
<P>
But the new house did match the old one enough to bring some peace to Smith's 
ailing wife, who had suffered the first of several strokes shortly before the 
landslide. 
</P>
<P>
"It took two years from the day we moved out (of the old house), but we finally 
got her furniture around her and created familiar surroundings," he said. "On 
her lucid days, when she was feeling better, she enjoyed her home, and I 
enjoyed being with her here." 
</P>
<P>
The couple had been married 46 years when Ruth Smith died Dec. 8, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Alone now, Smith tries to entertain friends as often as possible and to enjoy 
the tranquility of his new home. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Torrance is a good city. I'm glad I live here," he said quietly. "But 
I've lost four years. When you've got a suit hanging over you, it's depressing. 
It pushes you down. It's this constant bother and worry. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just glad it's over."

MCMARTIN PRE-SCHOOL TO BE RAZED

<TEXT>
<P>
The McMartin Pre-School, which was the focal point of an alleged child sex 
abuse scandal that touched off the longest and costliest trial in U.S. history, 
has been purchased by a real estate broker who wants to tear it down and 
replace it with an office building. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Goldstein, a Hermosa Beach real estate broker who bought the Manhattan 
Beach property in February, said he would like to begin work soon. "Who needs 
that monument any more?" he said of the fenced and deserted school buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein's plan, filed April 18 with the city of Manhattan Beach, calls for 
demolishing the McMartin Pre-School and joining the property with another lot 
for construction of a three-story office building. 
</P>
<P>
Before the project can proceed, it must be reviewed in public hearings before 
the Planning Commission and City Council, and it must receive a commercial 
planned development permit from the city. 
</P>
<P>
"It will take a little time," said City Planner Rosemary Ballister. 
</P>
<P>
The McMartin case erupted in the fall of 1983 when a parent told police that 
her child had been molested at the preschool in the 900 block of Manhattan 
Beach Boulevard. Other parents alleged that their children had been absed, and 
by the following May, seven people had been charged with 208 molestation counts 
involving 41 children. 
</P>
<P>
Charges later were dropped against everyone but Peggy McMartin Buckey and Ray 
Buckey, the daughter and grandson of the preschool's founder. In January, after 
a preliminary hearing and trial that lasted more than five years, Peggy 
McMartin Buckey was acquitted of all 12 counts against her, and Ray Buckey was 
acquitted of all but 13 of the 53 counts against him. 
</P>
<P>
The jury deadlocked on those 13 counts against Ray Buckey. Prosecutors refiled 
eight of the counts the jury could not resolve, and Ray Buckey is being retried 
on the eight counts in a proceeding that is expected to take six months. 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein bought the school on Feb. 6 for $320,000 from Buckey attorney Danny 
Davis, according to Los Angeles County records. Davis, who has represented 
Buckey since the start of the McMartin case, said he acquired the property as a 
legal fee. 
</P>
<P>
While the school was combed for evidence during the first trial, no objections 
to demolishing the buildings have been raised by the Los Angeles district 
attorney's office, which is prosecuting Buckey, or Judge Stanley Weisberg, who 
is presiding over Buckey's second trial. 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein's office plan calls for 8,200 square feet of usable space and parking 
for 28 cars. He will combine the McMartin property with an adjoining lot he 
owns at Manhattan Beach Boulevard and Walnut Avenue to construct the building.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: TEAMSTERS VOTING RESULTS CHALLENGED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two losing slates of Teamsters Union candidates have challenged the results of 
last week's election. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints filed with union officials in Los Angeles on Tuesday included 
allegations of mishandling ballots and disenfranchising voters. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see anything of merit" in the complaints, said Dennis Shaw, newly 
elected leader of Teamsters Local 186. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw's slate swept all but one of seven leadership positions in the union, 
which has 2,800 members in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. In the most 
significant race, Shaw won the top job by 101 votes, ousting incumbent Greg 
Boverson. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a member of Boverson's slate, Juan O'Campo, challenged the union's 
election procedures, including the elimination of ballots that were not signed 
by union members or had other irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
Election referees eliminated 194 of 1,407 ballots for various reasons. 
</P>
<P>
In another complaint from Boverson's slate, candidate David Morrison said it 
was not fair for Mary Romero Blanchard to run for reelection as a board member 
when she was preparing to retire immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Under the rules, Shaw and the board appoint her successor. "It was smart 
politics, but it wasn't right," Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw said Blanchard's reelection was completely proper. "She was eligible to 
run and she did," Shaw said. "They brought it up as a campaign issue and she 
got more votes than anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw declined to say who he would appoint in her place. 
</P>
<P>
A second challenge came from Gil Trejo's slate of candidates, who said 250 
Teamsters never received their ballots. Ray Gonzales, the slate's campaign 
manager, said duplicate ballots for the 250 members were not mailed until the 
day before they were to be counted. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw acknowledged that some ballots arrived late but said he knew of requests 
for only about 70 duplicate ballots. KENNETH R. WEISS

COUNCIL APPROVES CITY CENTER PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Thousand Oaks City Council has approved a $55.6-million budget to convert a 
former animal theme park called Jungleland into a new city government center, 
launching one of the largest and most controversial redevelopment projects in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
The budget -- twice the amount estimated by city officials four years ago -- 
includes funds for a new civic center, City Hall, theater, civic auditorium and 
five-acre park. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mayor Alex Fiore, the primary cause of the dramatic budget 
increase from the $28-million estimate made in 1986 is the addition of a 
$12-million government center and $3.3-million auditorium for the City Council 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
The council also voted on Tuesday night to pay an estimated $2.4 million to a 
management company to oversee the project over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the center is expected to start in May, 1991, with completion 
expected in August, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The center will be located on a 20-acre site at Thousand Oaks Boulevard and 
Conejo School Road. TINA DAUNT

HEATED DEBATE ERUPTS AT 1ST FORUM ON ARTS PARK PROPOSAL; 
</P>
<P>
SEPULVEDA BASIN: THE MEETING IS THE INITIAL STEP IN A DECISION-MAKING PROCESS 
EXPECTED TO TAKE 10 MONTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Fernando Valley residents and environmentalists squared off against 
community arts leaders at the first public debate over a proposed Sepulveda 
Basin arts center, a long-awaited meeting that at times dissolved into angry 
shouting matches. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's meeting was held by federal and city officials as a forum for public 
comment on which issues should be addressed in separate federal and state 
environmental reports that are required for the envisioned Arts Park L.A. If 
the reports conclude that the Arts Park would cause too much damage to the 
basin or too many problems for nearby residents, some or all of the complex 
will not be built in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was a first step in a decision-making process expected to take at 
least 10 months. About 50 people spoke before federal and city officials and a 
private consultant hired to help prepare the environmental reports. 
</P>
<P>
About 60% of those who spoke opposed building the complex in the basin. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as culture is concerned, I agree that it is needed," said Sandy 
Wohlgemuth, conservation chairman for the Los Angeles Audubon Society. "The 
question is, where should it go? We believe this intense development is 
inappropriate for the basin . . . the last remaining open space in Los 
Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Many opponents said they oppose all construction on open land. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents were primarily leaders of groups such as the Valley Cultural Center, 
the Valley Artists Guild or members of the Cultural Foundation, the nonprofit 
organization that wants to build the park. Proponents testified that the Valley 
desperately needs facilities for adult artists and children who receive little 
art education in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation envisions the Arts Park as a $70-million complex of theaters, 
workshops and exhibit spaces spread across 60 acres at the basin's northern 
edge, near the corner of Victory and Balboa boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
The Cultural Foundation, based in Woodland Hills, has been working on the 
project for nine years but declines to say how much money has been raised for 
construction. Foundation officials have requested a free sublease on basin land 
from the Army Corps of Engineers, which owns the flood-control basin, and the 
city of Los Angeles, which leases 2,000 acres for park use. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever construction is proposed on federally controlled land, especially open 
space, the government must consider whether the project could be built in other 
locations. An initial list of alternative sites presented at the meeting 
included Hansen Dam, the Van Nuys Civic Center, Warner Center, Cal State 
Northridge and Pierce and Valley colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Residents also suggested a government redevelopment area in North Hollywood, 
vacant schools and empty office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"There are two things we need more than we need open space," said Ross Hopkins, 
a Cultural Foundation member, replying to objections that the arts park would 
reduce the basin's greenery. "First is arts facilities. And the other thing we 
need is community." 
</P>
<P>
Hopkins said the basin is the perfect location for the Arts Park because it is 
centrally located. Residents from all over the Valley could converge there, he 
said, and a central complex would alleviate traffic and air pollution because 
arts patrons would not drive to facilities downtown as often. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles) said in a written statement read 
by a representative that the Arts Park would worsen traffic at the interchange 
of the Ventura and San Diego freeways. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental reports also will consider effects of construction on plants, 
wildlife and ground water. Residents complained that construction will scare 
away already diminishing wildlife. One man said there are already fewer hawks 
seen over the basin. A woman said she no longer sees small frogs that formerly 
hopped across the jogging path. 
</P>
<P>
"I like animals . . . but I like people better," said Sanford Paris, an Encino 
businessman who supports the arts park proposal. "While it may have a negative 
impact on some creatures on the Earth, there will be a positive impact on human 
creatures." 
</P>
<P>
At day's end, however, Cultural Foundation officials sounded a conciliatory 
note. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to hear from the community," said Linda Kinnee, the foundation's 
executive director. "We fully expect that there will be a compromise down the 
line. We just don't know where." 
</P>
<P>
Government officials and the private consultant said first drafts of the 
environmental documents are expected by late summer. Additional public meetings 
will be scheduled to allow for comment on those draft reports.

SHUTTLE PLAN WOULD AID SHOPPERS, TRAFFIC; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSIT: VANS WOULD TRAVEL IN A LOOP ALONG SECONDARY STREETS NOT SERVED BY 
BUSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Transit planners on Wednesday unveiled five proposed San Fernando Valley 
minibus routes designed to bring riders to major shopping areas and to funnel 
passengers into the regional bus system. 
</P>
<P>
The small buses or vans would travel in a continuous loop, largely on secondary 
streets not now served by the Southern California Rapid Transit District, 
Nicholas Patsaouras, RTD board member, said. The suggested routes would serve 
Studio City, West Hills, Chatsworth, Porter Ranch and Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
The routes, which could be operated by private firms or the RTD, would be 
financed by the city of Los Angeles' share of money raised by the extra 
half-cent sales tax that Los Angeles County voters approved in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Spivack, RTD's assistant general manager, said he had no estimate of how 
much it would cost to operate the minibus or van routes. 
</P>
<P>
Spivack said his staff devised the plan in response to suggestions made by 
Valley elected and appointed officials at an April 7 brainstorming session on 
ways to relieve traffic congestion. The minibus routes were among more than a 
dozen congestion-relief proposals that the 32 local officials had endorsed 
earlier for further study. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed routes drew a favorable reaction when they were made public 
Wednesday at a meeting of the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, 
which sets broad guidelines that cities must follow in using their share of the 
sales tax earmarked for transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Several commissioners noted, however, that the city of Los Angeles would have 
the final say on the minibus systems and wondered why the idea had been 
presented to them instead of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Chandler, Mayor Tom Bradley's press deputy, said Wednesday that city 
officials "will certainly look at these and other proposals" but said they had 
not yet had time to study the minibus plan. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler said Bradley had directed city staff to study peak-hour parking bans 
on major streets and reversible lanes on major arteries, including Sepulveda 
and Victory boulevards, as ways to relieve traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
He added that Bradley has "led the way in looking at traffic-relief for the 
Valley and other areas" and had initiated a truck management permit program 
that Chandler predicted would remove 70% of heavy trucks from city streets and 
freeways during rush hours. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which has been approved in general terms by the City Council, is 
to be implemented later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Patsaouras, a Tarzana resident who organized the Valley Transportation Summit 
in April, said he went to the commission before the City Council "because I 
wanted to get some support, which I feel we got here today," although no vote 
was taken. 
</P>
<P>
City traffic officials "have been studying some of these reversible lane 
proposals for years, and never seem to get anywhere," said Patsaouras. "The 
bureaucrats are still using the same old dirty glasses," to look at the city's 
traffic problems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Spivack said that his staff chose the five communities targeted for the bus 
routes "because they seem to be most in need of supplemental service because of 
the way our routes miss portions of them." 
</P>
<P>
It would take 18 buses or vans, Spivack said, to serve the five routes in both 
directions every 20 minutes during daylight hours. 
</P>
<P>
All of the routes would have two-way loops, with buses running continuously in 
both directions, except the Chatsworth line, which would be a one-way loop, he 
said.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOORPARK; 
</P>
<P>
TALKS ON OLD SCHOOL SITE WILL RESUME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moorpark city officials have agreed to resume negotiations over the purchase of 
land from the Moorpark Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Members of a committee from the city and the school district have agreed to 
resolve the 8-month-old dispute, Moorpark City Councilman Clint Harper said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Steve Kueny said a meeting could be scheduled within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement ends a stalemate resulting from a bitter dispute about the old 
high school where the land is located, Harper said. He said he was optimistic 
about a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court judge in November upheld a ruling that the city and the school 
district resume negotiations over the sale of nearly eight acres of athletic 
fields at the former Memorial High School. 
</P>
<P>
The city wants to turn the land into a park. It claims it is permitted under 
state law to buy the property at below market value because it is for 
recreational use. It has offered the district $319,000. 
</P>
<P>
District officials claim state laws allow them to sell the land at a higher 
price to make up for the cost of building a new school. 
</P>
<P>
School officials need between $4 million and $4.5 million from sale of the 
26-acre high school site, Moorpark school board member Tom Baldwin said.

The Ventura County coroner's office said Wednesday that a Thousand Oaks man 
found dead in a truck at the bottom of a ravine in Ventura had committed 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
The man, Joseph Portao, 71, was reported missing by his wife five weeks ago. 
The body was found Monday after nearby residents spotted the truck. 
</P>
<P>
Portao had deliberately driven the truck off of a little-used road at the top 
of Kalorama Street and plunged 400 feet to his death, Deputy Coroner James 
Wingate said.

PROPOSAL FOR FORMER CANNERY REJECTED BY HARBOR DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAY EVANS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Ezunial Burts bluntly advised Wilmington 
residents this week to drop their plans for converting the old Heinz pet food 
cannery into a waterfront commercial and recreational development. 
</P>
<P>
In a forceful statement to the Wilmington Community Advisory Committee, Burts 
said continued pursuit of the cannery project might jeopardize the port's 
support of a hoped-for development at the foot of Avalon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Both projects have been proposed as part of plans to revitalize Wilmington's 
industrial waterfront into a commercial and recreational showpiece overlooking 
the Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"If we continue to pursue (the cannery), we will end up with nothing but a lot 
of paper," Burts said Tuesday. He described efforts to secure historical status 
for the cannery as "chasing rabbits down rabbit holes." 
</P>
<P>
Burts said asbestos had been discovered in the building and that its age also 
makes the structure unsafe. He noted that consultants said last year that such 
a project would be economically infeasible. 
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated the port's determination to raze the building to make way 
for an equipment storage yard. 
</P>
<P>
The advisory committee, which was appointed by the Los Angeles Board of Harbor 
Commissioners to help draft revitalization plans for the waterfront, has long 
pushed to include the cannery in the study area. The port owns all the land 
under consideration and the projects depend on the port's willingness to donate 
the sites for development. 
</P>
<P>
Committee members appeared taken aback by Burts' remarks, but offered little 
comment at the meeting. Many said later they expected Burts to offer a 
trade-off, such as a promise of more support from the Harbor Commission for the 
Avalon Boulevard project, in return for dropping the cannery proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"He came on like gangbusters and told us we are not going to get it. I thought 
he was going to offer us something concrete in return, but he (just) let the 
air out of the balloon," said Gertrude Schwab, secretary of the panel. 
</P>
<P>
Wilmington residents and City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores have been pushing 
to declare the building a city historical landmark, which could protect it from 
being demolished. That proposal is set to come before the full City Council on 
May 8. 
</P>
<P>
However, on Tuesday Flores appeared to back away from her previous support of 
the plan to remodel the cannery into a retail and restaurant complex. 
</P>
<P>
"It was bad news when we recently found there was asbestos in the building," 
Flores said. "And the consultants suggest such a project would not probably be 
commercially feasible. We will get more sooner if we try to work with the 
Harbor Department and back off the cannery." 
</P>
<P>
Five conceptual sketches for the Avalon Boulevard project developed by RTKL 
Associates Inc. of Baltimore were on display at the meeting and will be 
formally discussed in May. The consulting firm was hired by the Harbor 
Commission last year to conduct a $172,000 study of how to convert the area 
into a commercial and recreational center. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the sketches propose leaving intact an existing rail and street corridor 
that runs along Alameda Street connecting shipping yards to city streets, 
splitting a proposed building and park into two segments. Under those plans, a 
bridge would link the two sides of the building. Two other sketches show the 
Alameda corridor rerouted to the west along Fries Avenue. A fifth sketch 
details a "seed project" in a small waterfront area south of the corridor that 
would include a park and a small building. 
</P>
<P>
The cannery site was left blank in the drawings, which outline such 
possibilities as an oceanfront aquarium, an observation tower, parks and a 
restaurant and retail complex. 
</P>
<P>
Burts encouraged the committee to forge ahead on the seed project, saying the 
panel should "get something going while a window of opportunity exists." Burts 
said the port will not have definite plans for the Alameda corridor, a crucial 
link to the shipping yards, for at least a year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
But committee members balked at making choices while the fate of the corridor 
is still in question. 
</P>
<P>
"That seems like putting the cart before the horse to me," said committee Vice 
President Simie Seaman. 
</P>
<P>
Once the advisory panel has made recommendations on a project, the plans will 
go to the Board of Harbor Commissioners for revision and approval. The board 
will have the final say on any proposal.

P.V. ESTATES TAKES STEP TO STRENGTHEN LAW LIMITING HOUSE SIZES 
</P>

The Palos Verdes Estates City Council took the initial step Tuesday to 
strengthen its "neighborhood compatibility" ordinance, which restricts the size 
of houses that can be built in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The council unanimously gave approval to a revised ordinance that would ban 
houses that cover more than 50% of the area of a lot. The existing ordinance 
had permitted such projects, especially on the city's smaller lots. Council 
members said their intention is to save neighborhoods with small lots from 
being overbuilt. The council took the action because many houses on small lots 
have been razed to make way for oversized homes. 
</P>
<P>
The revised ordinance would limit the living space and garage of a house to 50% 
of the lot area, or 30% of the lot area plus 1,750 square feet, whichever is 
less. The existing ordinance required that the living space and garage be 
limited to 30% of the lot area plus 1,750 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
The new ordinance would take effect June 5 if adopted in two weeks as expected. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance would principally affect construction on lots 8,750 square feet 
or less, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ruth Gralow proposed capping the size of all new homes or 
remodeling projects regardless of lot size. Last year she unsuccessfully sought 
a temporary ban on single-family houses larger than 15,000 square feet, and on 
Tuesday she again argued for a limit on the size of homes. She also suggested 
that the council should place limits on the cubic feet in a home, to address 
houses with expansive, vaulted ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
Others objected to her suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Raymond Mattingly said later: "There are a number of us who feel 
that people still have property rights and (a cap) would go too far in 
curtailing those property rights." 
</P>
<P>
The council also approved an ordinance that sets a one-year limit on future 
approvals issued under the neighborhood compatibility ordinance. The measure 
would prevent builders or homeowners from getting approval for a project, then 
building it years later when restrictions might have been tightened. 
</P>
<P>
The council also introduced an ordinance that will forbid encroachment into the 
five-foot side-yard setbacks.

WHY IT'S A NET LOSS TO OVERRULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pat Riley is the coach of the Lakers, not David Stern. But National Basketball 
Assn. Commissioner Stern fined the Lakers $25,000 for holding players out of a 
meaningless game in Portland Sunday night anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers, the opponents in the end-of-the-season contest, complained 
that their fans had been gypped out of the cost of their tickets because Magic 
Johnson, James Worthy and other stars were kept on the bench. Riley gave some 
injured players, plus Johnson and Worthy -- who, thankfully, are in good health 
-- a spell to help prepare them for the grueling schedule of playoff games and 
travel that now begins. 
</P>
<P>
Riley did what any other good coach would do in the same situation: Would John 
Robinson risk having Jim Everett hurt after the Rams have qualified for the 
football playoffs? Would Tommy Lasorda make Fernando Valenzuela pitch 
meaningless end-of-season innings as the Dodgers prepared for baseball's 
divisional showdown? Maybe the Lakers could have tried harder to win that final 
game. But the reason they didn't have to was because they'd outperformed 
Portland during the balance of the regular season, and that counts for 
something, too. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers earned their rest; Riley was correct. Stern is interfering in the 
right of a coach to manage his team. That's bad for basketball.

FORMER COUNCILMAN'S LIBEL SUIT IS DISMISSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A libel suit filed by former Rolling Hills Estates City Councilman Jerome 
Belsky against two political opponents has been dismissed by a Torrance 
Superior Court judge, who ruled that the activists' statements against Belsky 
in a 1988 recall election were constitutionally protected free speech. 
</P>
<P>
Judge William C. Beverly on Tuesday dismissed Belsky's 2-year-old lawsuit 
against Paul E. Bradley Sr. and Jacki McGuire, both of whom led the successful 
recall campaign. McGuire later won election to Belsky's seat on the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this sends a message that the citizenry does have the right to 
criticize politicians," said James Link, Bradley's lawyer. "What the court was 
really saying was, maybe there was some overstatement, maybe there was some 
fiery rhetoric, but that it was protected political debate." 
</P>
<P>
McGuire called the judge's ruling "a victory for the little guy." 
</P>
<P>
"Public officials usually have a lot of money and can afford to fund this 
costly litigation," McGuire said, "and little guys like myself can become very 
intimidated." 
</P>
<P>
Belsky could not be reached for comment, and his attorney, Jerome Bleiweis, 
said he would not make a statement until today. 
</P>
<P>
Five other defendants had been dismissed from the case or reached out-of-court 
settlements with Belsky. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly's ruling Tuesday preempted what was expected to be a seven-week trial 
into the campaign surrounding Belsky's November, 1988, recall. 
</P>
<P>
The judge ruled that most of the charges in petitions and flyers against the 
12-year councilman were protected by the Constitution because they were 
presented as opinions and not facts. Allegations in the campaign that Belsky 
had been "convicted of chemical pollution" were made without malice and 
therefore also represented political statements that are protected by the First 
Amendment, the judge ruled. 
</P>
<P>
The libel allegations stemmed from two petitions and four flyers circulated in 
Rolling Hills Estates. 
</P>
<P>
A notice of intent to recall and the recall petition itself said, among other 
charges, that Belsky had "tainted our council's image by an arrangement with 
two other councilmen to invest in a business in our city." The recall documents 
said the investments created the potential for a conflict of interest or 
violations of the state's open meeting law. 
</P>
<P>
Belsky charged that these and other statements were untrue, insulted his 
reputation and were made in reckless disregard for the truth. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly found that such charges constituted opinions and were protected by the 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the flyers also discussed a 1987 case in which a metal plating firm 
that Belsky owns in Harbor City pleaded no contest to eight misdemeanor counts 
involving the dumping of toxic wastes. Bumperline Inc., which put chrome 
finishes on car bumpers, was fined $30,000 and placed on three years probation. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-six other misdemeanors, including some charges against Belsky and his 
son, Michael, were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
One flyer said that Belsky himself had been "convicted of chemical pollution," 
fined and placed on probation. Another said he had been charged with 74 counts 
and placed on probation. 
</P>
<P>
According to attorney Link, Beverly in his ruling Tuesday said that it was not 
surprising that lay people had misinterpreted the 1987 court case -- imputing 
the conviction to Belsky rather than his company. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the judge noted, Belsky had been ordered to give a speech on safe 
methods of hazardous waste disposal to an industry trade group as part of his 
company's probation. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, Beverly ruled, the statements about Belsky and his company "are 
without actual malice, constitute 'core political statements' and are, hence, 
protected under the First Amendment." 
</P>
<P>
The former defendants said they may sue Belsky to recover their legal costs.

GOT MESSAGE, READY TO TALK; 
</P>
<P>
LITHUANIA KNOWS THE SCORE; IT CAN SEE THE TANKS. GORBACHEV HAS MADE HIS POINT. 
SO NEGOTIATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now it is Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's turn to do the right thing. 
President Bush made a good call Tuesday in declining to ask for sanctions 
against Moscow over its treatment of Lithuania. Bush can always change his 
mind, but for now, he says, there is too much at stake to rock the boat: "I'm 
concerned that we not inadvertently do something to compel the Soviet Union to 
take action that would set back the whole cause of freedom around the world." 
</P>
<P>
His cause of freedom includes arms-control negotiations, German reunification, 
cuts in Soviet troop strength in Eastern Europe and Gorbachev's domestic 
reforms, which have lately come on hard times. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of freedom also includes Lithuania, even though it seems determined 
to make its break from Moscow as hard as possible for Gorbachev to swallow. 
That is difficult to understand because, for one thing, had Gorbachev not 
launched his reform programs, Soviet tanks might have plowed through Lithuania 
with all guns blazing instead of parading around in the middle of the night as 
part of a war of nerves. In another bitter irony, Lithuania was able to declare 
its independence precisely because Moscow restrained itself, hoping that its 
relations with the republic would become a showcase that would encourage other 
Soviets to accept Gorbachev's economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Bush pondered sanctions in the first place because there is a case to be made 
for Western nations doing more than scold Moscow for tightening the economic 
screws to force the tiny republic to renounce its wish for freedom. In the end 
-- correctly, we think -- Washington decided that Moscow doesn't wish to keep 
Lithuania under its thumb forever, and that it wants only to postpone the break 
until the Soviet Union itself can stabilize. 
</P>
<P>
This reasoning gets some support from the most recent Kremlin statement that 
the problem could be worked out if Lithuania simply suspended its declaration 
of independence for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania refuses to go that far. Moscow keeps tightening its embargo of 
Lithuania, now down to a two- to four-week supply of energy, putting extra 
guards on the border and threatening to cut off more raw materials. 
</P>
<P>
Through all this, delegations from Lithuania have gone door-to-door in Moscow, 
looking -- largely without success -- for someone to talk to them on their 
terms: as visitors from an independent nation. And that gives Gorbachev an 
opportunity to take his turn doing what makes sense and at the same time end 
the confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania has gotten his message by way of the embargo. Gorbachev has nothing 
to lose by plunging into serious discussions on the mechanics of Lithuania's 
future freedoms without any further conditions.

MEDFLY: THERE IS VIRTUALLY NO CHANCE THAT EACH OF THE HUNDREDS OF NEW CATCHES 
REPRESENTS A NEW INFESTATION. THE FIRST OUTBREAK, YEARS AGO, WAS NEVER 
ERADICATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM JORDAN, William Jordan holds a Ph.D in insect ecology. His book, 
Divorce Among the Gulls and Other Essays On Human Nature, will be published by 
North Point Press in January, 1991. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Well, friends and fellow citizens, the first battle in the Medfly war -- the 
epic struggle that began 15 years ago -- is over. We've lost. We have lost 
abysmally, ignominiously and unconditionally. The Huns are pouring into Rome. 
The Russians are swarming over Berlin. Malathion has not worked. The sterile 
flies have not worked. Humiliation. We have to face reality. We have to step 
back and reassess. Any ecologist who is not employed by the state or federal 
governments, who looks to biological truth for guidance, not to political 
mandate, will tell you the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
What, then, is going on -- what is really going on behind the biological scene? 
James Carey, an entomologist at UC Davis, has taken on that question. As a 
university scientist, his job and his reputation depend on finding the 
biological truth. He therefore began with the most elementary step in data 
analysis, looking for gross patterns in whatever evidence that existed; he just 
added up the Medflies caught in Los Angeles County each year. What he found has 
revolutionized the Medfly story. 
</P>
<P>
It begins in 1975, with the first outbreak of 34 flies, and, according to the 
state, it was eradicated. No more flies appear for five years. Then, four flies 
show up in 1980 and 53 more in 1981. Again the Medflies are eradicated, 
according to the state and federal governments. Of course, one fly happens to 
be caught in 1982, one in 1984, one in 1986, but these are just the odd bug, 
declares the government. Nothing to worry about. Easy to eradicate. . . . Until 
1987. Forty-four turn up then. That population is also eradicated. Fifty-three 
arrive in 1988. Yet another successful eradication. A resounding 241 enter the 
traps in 1989, incredible in light of the fact that the flies have been 
eradicated in eight of the previous 13 years. But by now it has become routine 
to eradicate them. The government has become so good at eradication that there 
is no need for alarm; they can do it any time. They are not about to "let" the 
Medfly immigrate illegally. 
</P>
<P>
In the minds of the government bureaucrats and their in-house scientists, each 
year's outbreak is a new invasion. Without realizing it, they have fallen 
victim to a fundamental function of the human mind: illusion. The mind creates 
illusions of life; illusion is the explanation of the images that move across 
the screen of the conscious mind. The problem is, illusions are crafted around 
one's interests. You see the world in a way that supports your job. All your 
research is right-headed, all your methods work. 
</P>
<P>
There is also denial. The mind instinctively ignores facts that run against its 
illusions. 
</P>
<P>
So, tourists, immigrants and illegal aliens are said to be sneaking infested 
fruit into Los Angeles and lobbing it, presumably, into the various 
neighborhoods as they drive by. With drive-by lobbings out of control, what 
more could go wrong? There is talk of fruit-fly terrorism. A $10,000 reward is 
offered for information leading to the arrest of any miscreant. But for some 
inexplicable reason, no one is able to claim this prize. And there it is, the 
drive-by, fungus-spore, sterile-duped, malathion-suckered, state-controlled 
Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
A very different explanation occurs to Carey, the ecologist whose mandate is to 
find biological reality. When, like the government agents, you are defending a 
cause, you bend the truth to fit the illusion. When, like Carey, your mandate 
is to find the truth, you bend the illusion to fit the facts. 
</P>
<P>
What Carey sees is not an endless series of new introductions. It is an 
absolutely classic, textbook example of a single, massive invasion. He applies 
the discipline known as "invasion biology," a field in its own right, for 
insects do strange and remarkable things when they acquire new territory. 
</P>
<P>
A typical insect invasion has four phases: There is the introduction, when the 
first colonists arrive; there is colonization, in which they reproduce; then 
naturalization, in which the insect calibrates its body and adjusts its 
behavior to its adopted land, and, finally, the spread phase, in which, 
remodeled and finely tuned, it multiplies and marches, multiplies and marches 
and settles down in those regions to which it is genetically suited. Carey 
claims, and he is undoubtedly right, that the Medfly has entered that fourth 
and final phase. 
</P>
<P>
There are some crucial points to be emphasized here. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, Phase 3 -- naturalization -- is a critical and difficult time for 
an insect. It is not easy to get a toehold in a new land. It arrives suited for 
life in the place it left, and like a human immigrant, it has a sort of 
biological "accent." Also like the human immigrant, its offspring will become 
native speakers and natural citizens. The only difference is that the insect 
takes a number of generations, for its adjustments are genetic. It must adjust 
to different pathogens, different strains of food with different levels of 
minerals, and so on. And, if pesticides are used heavily against it, the insect 
must acquire some kind of resistance, some way of coping with them, because 
they are part of the new environment. Malathion bait is part of the Medfly's 
new home, a big part. 
</P>
<P>
To get some idea of how difficult it is for insects to adapt to a new land, 
entomologists have been introducing beneficial insects deliberately for more 
than 100 years, and only about 30% of the species have ever established 
themselves. And these were given every advantage -- matched to similar 
environments, released in huge numbers, put in sheltered places, provided with 
food, shielded from pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
The point is, Medflies are not like fungus spores or plant seeds. Infestations 
do not sprout wherever an infested fruit rolls to a stop, which most likely 
would be the garbage can. There is virtually no chance that each of the new 
catches represents a new infestation. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Medflies are being caught in the same neighborhoods where they 
were caught eight years ago. At least four of these sites were heavily sprayed 
with Malathion. The odds of new infestations occurring on top of old ones 
cannot be calculated, literally. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, if, for the sake of argument, tourists, immigrants and aliens were 
importing fruit, and if the flies were sprouting like seeds as the government 
claims, then you would expect infestations throughout Southern California. 
Especially in San Diego, with its river of immigrants flowing northward. 
Southern and Central California would have gone up in a huge Medfly 
conflagration long ago. Until this last month, all of the captures have been in 
the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
The truth can be denied, but it cannot be altered: The Medfly is established. 
Almost certainly it has been among us since 1975 and has never been eradicated. 
The chances are excellent that it arrived even earlier, as long ago as the 
mid-1960s.

MILKEN'S PLEA IS A JUNK DEAL; 
</P>
<P>
HE SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO SPILL THE BEANS TO PROSECUTORS BEFORE SENTENCING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN M. DERSHOWITZ, Alan M. Dershowitz teaches at Harvard Law School and 
writes a syndicated column. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I smell a rat in the Milken plea bargain. Under the deal struck for the 
billionaire junk bond king, Michael Milken pleaded guilty to half a dozen 
relatively minor counts of what originally was a megaton indictment. He has 
agreed to pay a fine and restitution of up to $600 million and faces a jail 
term of up to 28 years, but which will actually be in the range of about five 
years. That sounds like a pretty good deal for a man who has admitted that he 
willfully broke the laws designed to protect vulnerable investors. 
</P>
<P>
But there is more -- much more, I suspect -- to this deal than meets the eye. I 
have read the plea agreement between the government and Milken, and it is one 
very strange document. It seems calculated to conceal, rather than disclose, 
what is really going on here. It raises more questions than it answers. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the agreement requires Milken to "cooperate with the government" 
in a number of ways. But it expressly postpones this obligation until "after 
the imposition of sentence." And the sentencing is not now scheduled until Oct. 
1, with the possibility -- set out in the agreement -- that it might be 
postponed into 1991. I have never seen a plea bargain like this in my 25 years 
of criminal-law practice. It is bizarre for several reasons. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, the only real incentive a defendant has to cooperate fully -- to 
dig deep into his memory and files -- is to persuade the sentencing judge that 
he should receive a sentencing discount for helping the government. Yet under 
this agreement, Milken's obligation to cooperate begins only after he has been 
sentenced. Why should he cooperate fully only after he has any real incentive 
to do so? There is a partial, but unsatisfying, answer to this question. Even 
after sentencing, the judge retains some power to reduce the sentence she has 
imposed. But that power is limited to 120 days after sentencing, and judges 
rarely reduce a sentence that they have so recently imposed, except for health 
and other such reasons. 
</P>
<P>
If Milken wants to get a cooperation discount, he would be well advised to 
begin -- and indeed to complete -- his cooperation before the judge decides on 
his original sentence. And that is just what he is probably going to do, 
despite the words of the agreement. After, all the agreement doesn't prevent 
him from cooperation before the imposition of sentence. It just doesn't compel 
him to begin his cooperation until afterward. Moreover, agreement gives Milken 
an additional argument to present to the judge if he decides to cooperate 
before sentencing: 'Your honor, I had no obligation to cooperate; I decided to 
do it out of the goodness of my heart; and that deserves even more of a 
discount than obligatory cooperation.' 
</P>
<P>
I also believe that the government knows that Milken intends to cooperate 
before sentencing. If they don't, then they made a very questionable deal for 
themselves and the public. If Milken's cooperation does not begin until 1991, 
the statutes of limitations -- which are 5 years for most crimes -- will have 
run out on many of the crimes about which Milken has detailed knowledge. Milken 
himself pleaded guilty to crimes that took place between 1984 and 1986. By 
1991, much of Milken's information will be stale and useless. The government 
prosecutors obviously know this. And by agreeing to postpone Milken's 
obligation to cooperate, they are either protecting some potential targets of 
prosecution or they have a side deal with Milken under which he will secretly 
begin cooperation before he is obliged to do so. 
</P>
<P>
If he does cooperate, the public may never learn that fact, unless he 
eventually testifies at a trial. He can provide important leads, documents and 
other information without the public finding out. Such secret cooperation is 
common. We may never even know if he has received a secret sentencing discount. 
The government is allowed -- under the law and practice of the federal courts 
-- to send secret letters to the sentencing judge detailing the defendant's 
cooperation. Because such information is not public, the citizens would have no 
basis for judging whether their interests were adequately served by the deal. 
</P>
<P>
I hope that the sentencing judge in this case -- a woman with an excellent 
reputation for integrity -- will not accept any secret communications and will 
require that everything be out in the open. The public is entitled to such 
protection, especially in this, the ultimate inside case handled by the 
ultimate inside lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's entire career was premised on keeping the public in the dark about 
what really was going on in the junk bond market. His plea bargain should not 
be shrouded in the same veil of darkness.

SCHOOL WORKERS REPLACE UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Non-teaching employees in Inglewood's schools have voted decisively to 
decertify their longtime union, the California School Employees Assn., and 
replace it with an affiliate of the AFL-CIO, according to election results 
released this week. 
</P>
<P>
Employees voted to replace CSEA, which has represented the roughly 500 
classified employees for more than a decade. The new representative is 
California Professional Education Employees (CalPro), a division of the 
International Brotherhood of Painters and Allied Trades and an affiliate of the 
14-million-member AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
CalPro organizer Christopher Graeber and several classified employees said CSEA 
was slow to respond to employee complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Graeber said CalPro is "going to be there when people have problems." 
</P>
<P>
Ophelia Jackson, a records clerk at Inglewood High School who was the local 
president of CSEA, said the decertification resulted from dissatisfaction from 
"a lot of misinformed people." She said the classified employees have been 
divided since CSEA staved off a decertification attempt in 1987 by the American 
Federation of Teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"People believed we could move mountains," she said. "When we moved them, they 
weren't satisfied. When we couldn't, they complained." 
</P>
<P>
CalPro, which received 187 of the 352 votes cast, beat CSEA's 60 votes and the 
98 votes that the Inglewood Classified Assn., another challenger, received. Six 
employees voted for no union. The ballots, cast between December and February, 
had been impounded by state labor officials for several months pending the 
resolution of appeals. 
</P>
<P>
CalPro will represent the district's aides, peace officers, truck drivers, 
records clerks, secretaries and other staff members. The results will become 
official if none of the parties contest the election results by May 7. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Cole, a truck driver at district headquarters who favored CalPro, said: 
"We finally decided for a change. A lot of people are real happy. That's what 
everybody was talking about today." 
</P>
<P>
Diane Chambers, a budget technician at the district headquarters, added: "I was 
sick of what CSEA wasn't doing. People with problems weren't getting their 
problems solved. . . . The numbers tell all." 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Bell, who led the decertification effort for the Inglewood Classified 
Assn., said CalPro's decertification effort was the best organized and did the 
best job of reaching employees with the union's message. She said the voting 
clearly shows that "CSEA wasn't doing their job." 
</P>
<P>
The decertification proceedings began last May when the Inglewood Classified 
Assn., a branch of the Inglewood Teachers Assn., filed a petition with the 
Public Employment Relations Board to take over representation of classified 
employees from CSEA. CalPro filed a separate petition a week later. 
</P>
<P>
CSEA appealed both decertification attempts on the grounds that they contained 
irregularities that made them illegal. But PERB eventually denied the union's 
appeals.

CITY-COUNTY PACT ON NEW TRASH DUMP IN ELSMERE CANYON OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council has approved a complex garbage disposal agreement 
with the county, despite warnings from two councilmen that the contract could 
invite an avalanche of garbage from outside the city at the city's Lopez Canyon 
landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The pact creates a city-county partnership to begin preparing a huge trash dump 
in Elsmere Canyon, near Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
It also prevents three scenic canyons in the Santa Monica Mountains, once 
listed as future garbage dumps, from becoming landfills. 
</P>
<P>
BKK Inc., a private waste management firm that owns the Elsmere site, stands to 
earn a $125-million profit after covering its costs of buying about 2,000 acres 
in Elsmere Canyon, obtaining environmental clearances and preparing the site to 
receive garbage. 
</P>
<P>
Although the agreement reflects more than a year of closed-door negotiations, 
it had to be voted on twice Tuesday because Councilman Gilbert Lindsay -- 
apparently confused about what was being voted on -- initially voted no, 
leaving it one vote short of passage. 
</P>
<P>
Also voting against the plan were Councilmen Nate Holden and Ernani Bernardi, 
who objected to a clause that could allow the county to dump garbage in Lopez 
Canyon, a municipal dump above Lake View Terrace that now is reserved for city 
residential trash. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about those concerns, Ron Deaton, the assistant chief legislative analyst 
who helped negotiate the agreement for the city, said any increase in the 
number of garbage trucks allowed to dump at Lopez Canyon each day would have to 
be approved by the city, the county health department and the state Integrated 
Waste Management Board. Four hundred trucks currently dump their loads at the 
city garbage dump each day.

WHITSON, SUBS PICK UP SLACK FOR PADRES; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: WITH ALOMAR AND ROBERTS OUT WITH THE FLU, PITCHER HITS FIRST MAJOR 
LEAGUE HOME RUN WHILE SHUTTING OUT CHICAGO, 3-0. PAGLIARULO AND CORA HELP HIM 
WITH BIG DEFENSIVE PLAYS.

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You would think that the way the Padres have been hitting lately would be 
making the other teams sick. 
</P>
<P>
You would think, considering that the Padres boosted their team batting average 
by 34 points Monday and Tuesday alone, that maybe opposing pitchers would start 
feeling queasy, march into the manager's office and beg out of the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
But no. Instead, Roberto Alomar and Bip Roberts, the Padres' leadoff and No. 2 
batters, caught a flu bug that had found its way into the team's clubhouse and 
were scratched from the lineup less than an hour before the start of 
Wednesday's game with the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
And you know what the Padres, those crazy quick-change artists, did? Plugged 
Mike Pagliarulo and Joey Cora into the lineup, then went right out and turned 
some sharp defense and Ed Whitson's second consecutive complete game and first 
career home run into a 3-0 victory over the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' third victory in a row and the Cubs' sixth consecutive loss came in 
front of 20,579 in San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres were coming off a two-night offensive display in which they scored 
26 runs and had 36 hits. Nobody contributed more than the top third of the 
Padre order -- Alomar, Roberts, and Tony Gwynn, which went 15 for 29 (.517) 
with 13 runs scored in those two games. 
</P>
<P>
But about 30 minutes before game-time, Alomar was slumped in a chair in front 
of his locker, and Roberts was nowhere to be found. Bruce Hurst, today 
scheduled starting pitcher, was sitting quietly in his chair, also feeling a 
bit under the weather. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pagliarulo was scrambling toward the elevator, heading for the 
Padres' indoor batting cage. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know I was in the lineup," Pagliarulo mumbled to the elevator 
operator. 
</P>
<P>
Pagliarulo went zero for two but stood out in the field. On this night, the 
Padre offense as a whole was fairly quiet. 
</P>
<P>
They scratched for a run in the first, when Joe Carter drove in Cora with a 
single. And they got two more in the seventh. Whitson led the inning off with 
the homer to left, the first by a Padre pitcher since Calvin Schiraldi put one 
out against the Dodgers' Fernando Valenzuela last Sept. 23. And they got their 
third run when Gwynn scored on an error. 
</P>
<P>
They got eight hits against three Cub pitchers, including one by Benito 
Santiago, who increased his hitting streak to 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
So how about a word about the Padre defense? 
</P>
<P>
Magnificent. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, who have just six errors, fewest in the NL, played their third 
consecutive error-free game. It's not quite as impressive as Cub Ryne 
Sandberg's streak, but not bad. Sandberg played his 104th consecutive errorless 
game, extending the league record for second baseman. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' perfection in the field Wednesday started with Cora and Pagliarulo. 
</P>
<P>
Cora made a leaping stab of a Sandberg line drive and shoveled the ball to 
Garry Templeton to double off Mike Bielecki at second to end the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Then, he made the play of the game in the seventh. Dwight Smith sliced a drive 
into the right-center gap. Gwynn caught up to it at the fence and threw to 
Cora, the cut-off man. Cora turned and fired an on-the-money throw to 
Pagliarulo at third to get Smith. The Padres led at the time, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
"Big play," Padre Manager Jack McKeon said. "Probably the key play in the game. 
Joey did a remarkable job on that relay. It was good baseball. I'm not afraid 
to put him in a game in any position. I can eventually see him being a regular 
somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Said Gwynn: "I bounced the throw, but Joey made a great play by staying back on 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the key to the game was Cora and Pags." 
</P>
<P>
Cub Manager Don Zimmer was unhappy with Smith's decision to attempt to take 
third. He said Smith was on his own, that third base coach Chuck Cottier didn't 
figure into it. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely," Zimmer said. "On a ball to right-center, you don't look at the 
coach. We haven't done anything right in a week." 
</P>
<P>
Whitson didn't do much wrong. It was his second consecutive complete game and 
his first shutout since July 8, 1989 at Pittsburgh, when he defeated Jeff 
Robinson, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned more in the last three or four years about how to pitch," Whitson 
said. "Ever since I got back from New York. I feel good when I go out there, 
that's the most important thing." 
</P>
<P>
He allowed seven hits, but ran into trouble just once. That came in the sixth, 
when three Cubs managed hits. But that was the inning Cora caught Smith at 
third. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense was absolutely superb," Whitson said. "Mike Pagliarulo and Joey 
Cora . . . you can't beat those plays." 
</P>
<P>
Cora had seven assists and three putouts. He was also the only Padre to get two 
hits. Oh, yeah, he also stole a base. 
</P>
<P>
Pagliarulo had four assists and two putouts. At the plate, he walked twice. 
</P>
<P>
Pagliarulo made a diving stop of Andre Dawson's sharp grounder in the second 
and threw Mark Grace out at second. Two batters later, Luis Salazar arrived at 
the plate. Pagliarulo picked up his grounder and threw to Cora at second to 
start a double play. 
</P>
<P>
Two innings later, Pagliarulo speared Grace's line drive and threw to first, 
where Smith had started toward second. Double play. 
</P>
<P>
Since he didn't think he would be in the lineup, Pagliarulo had taken extra 
fielding before the game. 
</P>
<P>
"My arm felt like a rag," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't matter. His defense didn't suffer. 
</P>
<P>
"(Defense) is as much a part of winning as anything . . . a three-run homer or 
pitching a shutout," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Templeton said the Padre defense has been strong this year because they are 
aggressive in the field. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just like being at the plate," he said. "Guys are staying aggressive on 
defense. When you're not as aggressive, you tend to make more errors." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres turned three double plays, helping Whitson immensely. The most 
important came in the sixth, when Bielecki was at second and Jerome Walton at 
first with just one out. The Padres led at the time, 1-0, and Cora's leap 
preserved it. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson didn't hurt himself with his first homer in a game. 
</P>
<P>
"I've hit them in batting practice before, so I know what it's like," he said. 
"When I saw it go over, it was clear sailing around the bases." 
</P>
<P>
Said Zimmer: "We made too many mistakes. First, we get doubled off on two line 
drives. Then, a guy tries to stretch a double into a triple in a one-run game 
with nobody out and Grace and Dawson coming up. He's out by 10 feet." 
</P>
<P>
He should have called in sick. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
You thought the only thing the Padres lost when pitcher Mark Davis signed with 
Kansas City was some brilliant relief work. Well, they also lost their best 
batting practice hitter among pitchers. The Padre pitchers like to hold home 
run contests, but last year's were runaways. According to Amos Otis, Padre 
batting coach, Davis routinely hit three or four homers a day. "Sometimes as 
many as six," Otis said. So, with Davis out of the lineup, who leads this year? 
Well, Andy Benes has two -- for the season. Dennis Rasmussen, Calvin Schiraldi 
and Ed Whitson are close behind with one apiece. Whitson, of course, topped 
them all with one in Wednesday's game, his first in the majors. . . . Mike 
Winters was the third base umpire Wednesday night, replacing Bob Engel. Engel, 
56, was given an indefinite leave of absence by the National League after being 
arrested Saturday in Bakersfield for allegedly stealing 4,180 baseball cards 
from a retail store. Engel was the home plate umpire for the series opener 
Tuesday. He is scheduled to be arraigned May 2 on misdemeanor counts of 
commercial burglary and petty theft. Winters is not a regular NL umpire. He 
works the Pacific Coast League (triple-A), and one of four umpires under option 
to the NL. . . . Pitching match-ups for this weekend's series with Pittsburgh: 
Eric Show (0-2) vs. Neal Heaton (3-0) Friday, Benes (2-1) vs. Bob Walk (0-3) 
Saturday, and Rasmussen (1-0) vs. Doug Drabek (3-1) Sunday. . . . The start of 
Friday's game has been pushed to 7:35 p.m. to accommodate ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
Minor League Dept.: Three Padre minor league shortstops are in bad shape. Luis 
Lopez of Riverside (A) suffered a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament in his 
left knee Tuesday. Scott Bream of Charleston (A), last year's third-round draft 
pick, will undergo back surgery in May. And Jose Valentin of Wichita (double-A) 
is out for at least 10 days with a separated left shoulder.

MISTAKES COST EL CAMINO CHANCE TO KEEP CARLSBAD DOWN

El Camino, still looking for its first San Diego Section playoff berth after 14 
years of trying, and Carlsbad, the defending 2-A section champions, had 
reversed roles all season. 
</P>
<P>
Entering Wednesday's game at El Camino, the host team was only a half-game 
behind first-place Oceanside in the Avocado League, tied for second with San 
Pasqual. Carlsbad had lost its first five league games and sat alone in last. 
</P>
<P>
But this was a case in which the more things had changed, the more they had 
stayed the same. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats kicked the ball around, ran themselves out of big inning after big 
inning and handed Carlsbad its first league victory, 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino (9-8, 3-2) made four physical errors in addition to another several 
mental ones, allowing Carlsbad (9-12, 1-5) to score three unearned runs. Five 
Wildcat runners were thrown out. One was picked off, another was thrown out 
trying to take an extra base after a single, and three more were shot down by 
Paul Harrold, Carlsbad's sophomore catcher, on botched hit-and-run plays. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Coach Adrian Leon said his aggressive running game, which was used 
even with his team four runs down in the seventh, had been working most of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"The batters just weren't making contact," Leon said. "It's not our style to 
sit back and lie down." 
</P>
<P>
Even with all its troubles, El Camino trailed by just 3-2 going into the sixth. 
But Brian Black's seventh homer of the year, off El Camino center fielder Kevin 
Knudson's glove, and Jeff Jarrard's RBI double gave Carlsbad a 5-2 lead. Bobby 
Womble's run-scoring single closed it to 5-3, but Carlsbad scored twice in the 
seventh without the aid of a hit. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Arispe, who replaced El Camino starter J.T. Patton (3-4), walked the 
first two batters he faced. Then, Shad Cotton, who relieved Arispe, made a wild 
throw to first on a bunt, allowing both runners to score. The second run scored 
when El Camino infielders misplayed a rundown situation. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino now gets a shot at the league leaders, playing Oceanside (4-2 after a 
9-1 loss to San Marcos) Friday and San Pasqual (4-1) Saturday in a makeup game.

Sara Lee Corp.: The firm posted third-quarter profit of $109 million, up 15% 
from the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
Sales totaled $2.8 billion, down slightly from the 1989 quarter. The Chicago 
firm, which markets a variety of brand name products including Hanes underwear, 
L'eggs hosiery, Hillshire Farm and Jimmy Dean meats in addition to its baked 
goods, attributed the results to weak sales of packaged meats and bakery 
products. However, this was offset by gains from its coffee and grocery 
division and packaged consumer products division.

Pacific Enterprises: The Los Angeles conglomerate, which owns Southern 
California Gas Co., Thrifty Corp. and Pacific Enterprises Oil Co., posted 
earnings of $68 million, up slightly from a year ago. Revenue totaled $1.91 
billion, a gain of 3%. The results were attributed to an improved performance 
at SoCal Gas, a 2% rise in Thrifty sales and higher oil prices, offset by 
higher depletion expense and lower oil and gas production.

BANK'S STOCK OPTION PLAN GIVES RISE TO PROXY FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proxy fight broke out at the Pacific Commerce Bank's annual shareholders 
meeting Wednesday over a plan to grant additional stock options to bank 
directors and officers. 
</P>
<P>
Several shareholders criticized as improper a proposal to grant 123,802 more 
stock options to bank directors and officers because directors already 
controlled 40.7% of the bank's 786,000 outstanding shares. The inclusion of 
non-employee directors in the plan, in addition to employee officers, also came 
under fire at the meeting held in Bonita. 
</P>
<P>
A single-branch bank based in Chula Vista, Pacific Commerce Bank had assets 
totaling $44 million as of March 31. 
</P>
<P>
The amended stock option proposal ended up being approved by shareholders in a 
96,150-to-58,091 vote but only after the bank disallowed proxies representing 
the 15% stake in bank stock held by Mexico City investor Isaias Zapata Guerra. 
Directors, who are in control of more than 300,000 shares, were not allowed to 
vote on the stock option proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Since Zapata Guerra opposed the amended stock option plan, his proxies could 
have spelled defeat for the proposal had they been allowed. Bank Executive Vice 
President Larry Miller said the bank disallowed Zapata Guerra's votes because 
he acquired the shares without obtaining proper permission from regulatory 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Larry L. Benthien, owner of less than 1% of the bank's stock and a critic of 
the stock option plan, nominated himself for a board director's seat but was 
defeated. Benthien owns a mobile home brokerage in Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
"(Bank directors) already own 40.7% of the stock and control on an almost 
absolute basis any issue that would come before the bank," said one shareholder 
who asked not to be identified. "It was never explained successfully why (bank 
directors) needed to have additional stock options to have even more control." 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he didn't know precisely how many of the new stock options were for 
directors and how many were intended for employees but said the options were 
split about half-and-half. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Commerce Bank shares trade at about $7.50 each over the counter. The 
bank's assets of $44 million on March 31 were up from $36.7 million a year 
previous. Full year net income for 1989 was $703,879, up from 1988's $522,597.

AFTER THE BOOM; 
</P>
<P>
TRENDS: A BABY-BOOM ANALYST SAYS HER GENERATION AREN'T THE YUPPIES PEOPLE THINK 
THEY ARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTIJANE LEVINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you're between 26 and 44, you're a baby boomer -- like it or not. And if you 
don't fit the "thirtysomething" stereotype, never mind. That's only because 
most people who are out to entertain you, sell you something, or simply catch 
your eye haven't the faintest clue as to who you really are. 
</P>
<P>
Thia Golson is out to set things right. As editor of The Boomer Report, a 
2-year-old, New York-based publication that tracks the antics of the 77 million 
people born between 1946 and 1964, Golson says, "The real boomers are younger 
and poorer than most people think they are." 
</P>
<P>
True, they're the best-educated generation of Americans, since one in every 
three boomers has some college education. But the typical boomer household, if 
there is such a thing, "pulls down only about $17,000 a year." And about 60% of 
the boomer population is still under the age of 35. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is, most manufacturers, advertising agencies and almost all the 
media still tend to confuse baby boomers with yuppies. That's a mistake, Golson 
asserts. She cites a survey by the J. Walter Thompson ad agency that divided 
the more affluent portion of the boomer generation into three groups: 
</P>
<P>
* Out of 77 million boomers in the United States, only 3.5 million qualify as 
yuppies, with some higher education and household incomes of $50,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
* There are 12.7 million "yuppie wanna-bes," described as people in the service 
professions, such as teachers and social workers. Their average income is about 
$18,000 to $20,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
* And there are 2.5 million people dubbed the "elite blue collar" group, 
(plumbers, electricians, carpenters) usually with no college educations but 
with an average income of about $45,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves the bulk of the boomers in limbo out there, with nothing yuppie 
about them. 
</P>
<P>
Golson says her publication was created to help corporations identify and 
analyze the many sub-markets within the huge boomer population. 
</P>
<P>
She will not release circulation figures for the monthly, eight-page 
newsletter, ($195 per year), but says subscribers include "heavy hitters" such 
as banks, major religious institutions, newspapers, broadcasting networks, "all 
the big ad agencies and most big marketing firms." 
</P>
<P>
Golson, at 44, calls herself a "vanguard boomer," meaning she's in the oldest 
boomer group (35 to 44.) She speaks in sound bites of boomer babble, with 
catchy phrases that might have come from ad campaigns. "The birth dearth" is 
how she refers to the post-boomer generation. And her Boomer Report, which she 
writes and edits by computer in "flex time" from her home in a New York City 
suburb, sounds just like she does: 
</P>
<P>
"It's 'Pensions to Go' for Job-Hopping Boomers," is the headline on a story 
about possible new laws allowing workers to transfer their pension benefits 
from job to job. "Paging Dr. Baby Boom!" is a column on marketing, advertising 
and human resources. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles to attend a meeting of the American Newspaper Publishers Assn. 
this week at the Century Plaza Hotel, Golson says most people between 35 and 44 
will never be able to retire. "They may never even grow up," she says, 
chuckling. 
</P>
<P>
"A boomer looks in the mirror and sees someone 15 or 20 years younger" than he 
or she really is. That's because boomers are truly more fit than previous 
generations, and they don't perceive themselves as middle-aged. 
</P>
<P>
"Boomers have been able to skate by, simply because of their masses," Golson 
says. "They've created their own marketplace and have gotten jobs wherever they 
went. But the end is coming. The Social Security system is in for a kind of 
collapse that's going to make the savings and loan bailout look like minor 
bookkeeping." 
</P>
<P>
The boomers won't have saved much money by the time they hit 65, she adds, 
because they never perceived themselves as getting older and needing to do so. 
They will work well into their 70s, "keep their jobs as long as they can, and 
not let the younger ones get in there." 
</P>
<P>
Even now, Golson says, the second tier of boomers -- people 25 to 35 -- are 
finding there's no place to go. "Their older boomer brethren are sitting in 
management positions and not getting out. And within 10 or 15 years, they'll 
own and run the companies and they'll make sure that mandatory retirement is 
voted out, because they won't save enough money to retire." 
</P>
<P>
But the women of the second tier will do things differently than their older 
sisters. They are learning that you can have it all -- but not all at the same 
time, Golson says. These younger women have seen their older sisters suffer by 
deferring child-bearing until it's too late, or by having children and then 
leaving them in the care of others. 
</P>
<P>
Younger, better-educated female boomers, she says, are having their children at 
a younger age, and they are deciding to defer their careers for five to 10 
years while they stay home with those children. 
</P>
<P>
This means financial sacrifice, but many believe the payoff can't be evaluated 
in dollars. Golson herself took about seven years off to raise her two sons, 
whom she refers to as "echo boomers," and says she "has never and will never 
regret it for a minute." Those who can't afford to stay home with their kids 
will wish they could, Golson says, and will lobby for better child-care 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the biggest effect of the baby boom generation has yet to be felt, she 
says: "They are just beginning to be political." And when they start to assert 
their influence in that arena, our entire society will change.

JACK SMITH: GAS, COGNAC AND VACUUMS: SWEEPING UP THE MAIL RESIDUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In defending myself against charges of intemperance in a crisis for having a 
bottle of cognac in my earthquake kit, I mentioned that I certainly had no 
intention of taking a nip from it until after my wife had turned off the gas 
valve and taken care of whatever other emergency actions might be required. 
</P>
<P>
I see now that this might be offensive to women who would find my attitude 
sexist, to say the least, especially considering Jennifer Morrison Taw's 
disaffection over our old rule that my wife was not to run the vacuum cleaner 
while I was working. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, I plead that I was only being ironic. It is true, however, that my 
wife has always had a sort of knack, not to say a gift, for plumbing, and if 
the gas valve were to be turned off after a quake, I think it would be better 
left to her experienced hand. 
</P>
<P>
Much more serious, I find out, was giving publicity to the notion that one 
should turn off the gas valve immediately after an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
I have a letter from Dick Friend of the Southern California Gas Co. which seeks 
to disabuse me of that notion. Friend takes a rather ironic tone himself in 
approaching the subject. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't agree with you more on your steadfast promise to Lois R. Koch ('I 
won't touch the cognac until after my wife has shut off the gas valve. . . .') 
</P>
<P>
"Because if Mrs. Smith does just that, and it's cold outside, you'll need the 
cognac to survive the elements. Once you shut off the gas at the meter, you 
should not turn it on until a gas company person (or a licensed plumber) has 
checked out the pipes (in the house, not yours). 
</P>
<P>
"After the Whittier quake, 21,000 persons ran out, wrenches in hand, and turned 
off their gas systems. It took us an entire week to get around to turning them 
all back on. There is no official record, but there probably was a record 
amount of cognac, and vodka, and beer, consumed while they waited for the gas 
to come back on in their homes." 
</P>
<P>
Friend advises that you do not shut off your gas valve unless you hear or smell 
gas escaping (which is unlikely). He also advises strapping your water heater 
to a stud, so that it won't topple over in a quake. "Should it fall, it not 
only could break the gas and water connectors, but it could spill 30 or 40 
gallons of precious water which might be all you'll have for a day or two. It 
may be more valuable than the cognac." 
</P>
<P>
Irony or not, that sounds like good advice. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, I'd like to say one more thing about vacuum cleaners. My feeling 
that they're disagreeable is substantiated by Pat Warren of San Diego, who says 
they're also dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a 46-year-old housewife who also owns a stained glass repair business," 
she writes. "The latter has me up and down on ladders and scaffolds, 
windowsills and ledges. I repair much of the glass in place, which also has me 
climbing on roofs, crawling in basements and finding myself in various strange 
positions while I work. I play racquetball three times a week for fun and coach 
a high school girls soccer team during the winter semester. 
</P>
<P>
"The only injury that I've ever had occurred last Thanksgiving while I was 
vacuuming the living room in preparation for the festivities. Twisted my knee 
and it hasn't been the same since. It may require surgery if time, Motrin and 
physical therapy don't do their jobs soon." 
</P>
<P>
Can you blame me for refusing to use the things? I do hope that high on the 
priority list of research and development teams is a robot vacuum cleaner that 
doesn't make any noise. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe vacuum cleaners can be made to respond to electronic control, as foreseen 
for other appliances by the Japanese. Then we could simply telephone home and 
tell the vacuum cleaner to do the living room. 
</P>
<P>
I'll bet that would cut down so much on domestic stress that we wouldn't have 
half as many divorces as marriages anymore. 
</P>
<P>
By the way. For the next three weeks my wife and I will be traveling in Egypt 
and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know how to say so long in hieroglyphics, so sayonara.

Separate Ways: Billionaire John Kluge, 75, reputed to be America's richest man, 
and his third wife, Patricia, 41, have divorced because of "irreconcilable 
differences," said Peter Sherman, her attorney. Forbes magazine's survey of 
1989's richest Americans lists Kluge, chairman of the conglomerate Metromedia 
firm, as No. 1 with a net worth of $5.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman said the two have "resolved all matters amicably and wish each other 
well." 
</P>

* Downsized: Former President Richard Nixon has for-sale signs up on his 
seven-bedroom house in Saddle River, N.J. He will move to a three-bedroom 
townhouse in nearby Park Ridge, spokesman John Taylor said Tuesday, adding the 
Nixons will "spend their energy on activities other than maintaining a large 
house on four acres." Taylor did not know the new home's purchase price or the 
old home's asking price, which the Nixons bought in 1981 for $1.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
* Trimming Back: Lady Bird Johnson, who has led highway beautification efforts 
since her days as First Lady, is bowing out of a Texas program that awarded 
highway workers for beautifying picnic areas and landscapes. "After 20 years . 
. . whatever we can do has been done," she said in a statement released in 
Houston. She said she also wants to spend more time with her family. 
</P>
<P>
* Hospital Report: The Rev. Billy Graham was released Monday from St. Marys 
Hospital in Rochester, Minn., after part of a rib was removed to check for 
cancer, the Mayo Clinic in Rochester said Tuesday. No cancer was found. Graham, 
71, was hospitalized April 10 after X-rays, taken several weeks after he had 
fallen, showed a suspicious rib lesion.

ART BUCHWALD: SCALING MOUNTAIN OF S&amp;L DEBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART BUCHWALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new figure for the savings and loan bailout is $500 billion. For those who 
are unable to comprehend this amount, just put one-half trillion dollars on 
your kitchen table. 
</P>
<P>
There are some people who say that $500 billion isn't what it used to be, but 
for the lower middle class, it's still a sum not to be sneezed at. 
</P>
<P>
You can build 500 Taj Mahals in Atlantic City for $500 billion. For $500 
billion, Donald Trump can even make a reasonable divorce settlement with his 
wife. It will also buy you one of Imelda Marcos's buildings in New York City or 
two orchestra seats to any Broadway musical. 
</P>
<P>
While nervous Nellies think of the $500 billion as a debt, others look at it as 
nothing more than a tall mountain of paper that reaches up to the sky. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland Franklin, who specializes in bailouts, invited me to climb the 
largest mountain of bad paper that the country has ever seen. It's located in 
what is now known as the Vale of Greed. 
</P>
<P>
He tied a rope around me and handed me some grappling hooks. 
</P>
<P>
"Follow me up," he shouted. "The base of the mountain is made of junk bonds. 
Above the clouds it's all real estate loans." 
</P>
<P>
"It sure stinks," I said. "How could this country build such a tall stack of 
debt in such a short time?" 
</P>
<P>
"The banks just kept making loans, and every time someone couldn't repay them, 
the S&amp;L rolled it up into a ball of paper and tossed it on the pile." 
</P>
<P>
"But it's awesome!" 
</P>
<P>
"You have no idea how many bad loans they made. I'm going to pull you up onto 
this ledge. It's very famous." 
</P>
<P>
"What is it called?" 
</P>
<P>
"The Grotto of the Gang of Five. Legend has it that five senators met with a 
savings and loan medicine man on this very outcropping and blew smoke at each 
other. This kept evil spirits from hurting the medicine man and, in exchange, 
he showered gifts on the senators." 
</P>
<P>
"Is he still alive?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, but all the deadbeat paper on the next two levels belongs to him." 
</P>
<P>
Both of us struggled upward. Cleveland handed me a flask of oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
"You can get a good view from here," he said, as we tied ourselves to another 
ledge. "You see those carcasses down there." 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of them." 
</P>
<P>
"They are all dead S&amp;Ls. They were abandoned by their avaricious owners." 
</P>
<P>
"The S&amp;Ls deserved better than that." 
</P>
<P>
"We're almost to the top. You can never say that you have reached the summit of 
an S&amp;L debt, because tomorrow it's bound to be higher." 
</P>
<P>
I was excited. "I never thought that one day I would be standing on top of $500 
billion worth of red ink." 
</P>
<P>
"This mountain represents more than lost causes," Cleveland told me. "This debt 
has become an environmental hazard. It smells all the way from New Jersey to 
Texas. Someday it's going to smother California." 
</P>
<P>
"Can we go back down? I'm beginning to feel nervous. There could be an 
avalanche of fresh debt at any time." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't worry. You can't get hurt. It's only paper."

SINGERS SALUTE SONGWRITERS -- TO THE TUNE OF $500,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
It was the sweet harmony between song and charity that raised $500,000 for the 
Betty Clooney Foundation for Persons With Brain Injury on Tuesday night. The 
concert, chaired by Rosalind Wyman and produced by Allen Sviridoff at the 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, was the fifth annual Singers Salute to the 
Songwriter, a veritable love-fest between vocalists and composers. 
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen singers, including Linda Ronstadt, Tony Bennett, Chita 
Rivera, Glen Campbell and the foundation's honorary chair, Rosemary Clooney, 
were on stage to sing the works of Marvin Hamlisch, Jimmy Webb, Ira Gershwin, 
and the team of John Kander and Fred Ebb, to a 3,100-strong audience. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'd picked them myself -- and I didn't -- these would have been the singers 
I would have wanted to hear," said Ebb. One "terrified" singer he heard was 
Liza Minnelli belting out the first public performance of the title song from 
the team's coming musical, "Kiss of the Spider Woman." The song has a 
two-octave range and a complex beat, and Minnelli could be seen keeping count 
on her fingers as she sang. 
</P>
<P>
"We write all of our songs for her," said "Spider" co-author Kander, as he 
hugged Minnelli backstage. "No matter who's singing them." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the evening's theme of singers saluting songwriters, Hamlisch took time 
to praise a fellow composer, Ira Gershwin, the sole posthumous honoree. 
</P>
<P>
"His songs live forever and ever and ever," said Hamlisch. "They've passed the 
test of time. We'll all be dead and gone before we know if we pass that test."

YOUR STAMPS: INK SMEARS DON'T INCREASE THE VALUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY KRAUSE, Krause, a free-lance writer and a member of several national 
stamp-collecting organizations 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I recently purchased from the local post office a roll of 25-cent 
U.S. Flag stamps (Yosemite design). Two of the stamps have green printing-ink 
smudges on the bottom portion of the stamps. Is this unusual, and if so, of any 
special value? -- J.G. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: You have a "plate smear" -- a minor freak or oddity, but not a major 
constant plate variety or missing color error, for example, that would merit 
catalogue status and, hence, a real premium over face value. From the photocopy 
you sent, the ink smear isn't pronounced enough to be even classified as a 
significant smear; the stray ink dots seem to be distributed mostly along the 
bottom 3 millimeters of this 25-mm stamp, so the smear isn't spectacular enough 
to be valuable. And if it were, figure on getting maybe double or triple face 
value from an error dealer. 
</P>
<P>
Coil stamps, by the way, are what collectors and postal clerks call rolls of 
stamps, i.e. those issued in a continuous strip in roll form instead of in a 
flat pane (sheet). Stamps that are not coils have often been faked to appear as 
coils by scissors' cutting of the perforations on two opposite sides of the 
stamp. And coils or stamps with a natural straight edge along one side (as 
issued) can be altered to look like perforated versions by "reperforating" 
them. So you have to be careful when buying a stamp to be certain that the 
perforations or lack thereof haven't been faked to enhance its market price! 
</P>
<P>
Q: My husband has a stamp collection from his childhood, including two unusual 
stamps from "FIUME," which he claims is an island that no longer exists. I 
enclose a photocopy of these stamps. Can you tell us anything about them? -- 
S.S. 
</P>
<P>
A: The two that you have photocopied are listed in the Scott catalogues as 
Fiume 29 and 30, issued in 1919, and retail for only about 10 cents each. The 
catalogue calls their colors "yellow green" for the 5-centesimi value, and 
"rose" for the 10-centesimi. 
</P>
<P>
Fiume, a city on the Adriatic Sea, was claimed by both Italy and Yugoslavia 
after World War I, being annexed by Yugoslavia in 1924. The population in 1924 
was a little less than 50,000 -- and it has more than doubled by today. Most 
stamps of Fiume are cheap and yours fit this category. The first set of Fiume 
postage dues (World War I Hungarian stamps overprinted in 1918) will set you 
back about $100 mint. The present name of Fiume is Rijeka. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My set of Austrian stamps picture soldiers with rifles, cavalry, a 
battleship, etc. What are these worth? -- P.H. 
</P>
<P>
A: The full set of five values (Scott B3-B7) of these World War I Austrian 
semipostals ("charity" stamps), issued May 1, 1915, retails for around $2, mint 
or used. If you have them imperforated (no "holes" on the edges) with 
expertizing certificates, the set costs near $100.

TRAVIS HANNAH RAN FROM MEAN STREETS TO USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID RAATZ, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a two-sport athlete at USC, former Hawthorne High School star Travis Hannah 
is so happy it almost scares him. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, I just sit and think what could have happened to me," said Hannah, 
shaking his head. "Sometimes, I just wonder. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Hannah, a sophomore track sprinter and football flanker, said he lived with his 
mother and brother in an especially rough Los Angeles neighborhood when he was 
young. "It was right near here, by Adams Boulevard," Hannah said during an 
interview at USC's Heritage Hall last week. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he was ready for junior high school, Hannah's mother was finally 
able to move her two sons to a part of Inglewood more conducive to family 
living. He is forever grateful to her. 
</P>
<P>
"If we hadn't moved, I really don't know what I'd be doing right now," Hannah 
said. "I am one of the few people who have made it out of the old neighborhood 
and gone into college or got a good job. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say nine out of 10 kids I knew there haven't been successful in life. 
They're selling drugs, or they just dropped out of school. 
</P>
<P>
"Where would I be? Would I be in college or would I be selling drugs?" 
</P>
<P>
Hannah, 20, appears headed for success in all facets of his life. 
</P>
<P>
In football, he led the Rose Bowl champion Trojans with a 23.2-yard kickoff 
return average as a freshman in 1989. As one of only four returning wide 
receivers, he will be a top reserve this fall and should see considerable 
action in passing situations. 
</P>
<P>
In track, he will compete in the 200- and 400-meter sprints and the 400- and 
1,600-meter relays Saturday against UCLA in what may be the last track meet 
ever held at the Coliseum. With a career best of 45.54 seconds in the 400, 
Hannah hopes to qualify for the NCAA Championships for the second straight year 
by meeting the necessary standard of 46.20 against the Bruins. The NCAA meet is 
June 1-4 at Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
In the classroom, Hannah is working toward a degree in education. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to teach elementary (school) kids," he explained. "I've always wanted 
to help kids, to help them grow with special knowledge they need to better 
prepare for college. 
</P>
<P>
"Where I went to (elementary) school in L.A., I had it hard." 
</P>
<P>
Hannah said he is deeply appreciative of his opportunities in higher education 
and for his ability to overcome earlier academic hardships. "I just thank God 
for letting me come here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While counting his blessings, Hannah is quick to add that he is looking forward 
to being reunited with former high school football and track teammate Curtis 
Conway, who will join the Trojans in the fall after spending the last academic 
year as a part-time student at El Camino College. 
</P>
<P>
"In football and track, my most spectacular moments have come with Curtis," 
said the 5-foot-9, 165-pound Hannah, who was a year ahead of Conway at 
Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
Conway and Hannah hooked up for 10 touchdown passes in 1987 at Hawthorne. That 
spring, the two close friends teamed up to lead the Cougars to their fifth 
state track title in six years. Hannah won the 400 in 47.20 seconds and teamed 
with Conway on the victorious 1,600 relay. 
</P>
<P>
Hannah said his most exciting athletic moments in high school were a 
last-minute bomb he caught from Conway that led to a game-winning field goal in 
a playoff game, and a come-from-behind win by the Cougar 1,600 relay team at 
the Arcadia Invitational in which Conway ran the second leg and Hannah the 
anchor. 
</P>
<P>
"We were way behind on the first leg, and then (Conway) brought us back," 
Hannah said. "Then we fell behind again, until I brought us back." 
</P>
<P>
A smile crosses Hannah's face as he recounts the Hawthorne glory days and looks 
forward to pairing with Conway on the Trojan kickoff return team. 
</P>
<P>
But he quickly takes a serious tone as he talks about "showing (Conway) the 
ropes" in college. 
</P>
<P>
"I've told him that it's a big jump from high school to college football," 
Hannah said. "It's not just going from point A to point B, it's more like going 
from A to C." 
</P>
<P>
However, Hannah added that his experience in the classroom is what will be most 
valuable to his friend. (After Conway graduated from Hawthorne in 1989, poor 
scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test prevented him from enrolling at USC 
right away.) 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, we really haven't talked too much about (athletics)," said Hannah, 
who sat out the 1988 football season and concentrated on his studies. "I've 
been explaining how school is a challenge here and that there's no easy going. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had tutoring and learned how to manage my time. I've learned that doing 
well on your first midterm (test) is a key part of getting a good grade in a 
class. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to try to pass all those things along to Curtis." 
</P>
<P>
While staying on pace in his classes, Hannah works extra hard on the track, 
trying to make up for time lost to spring football practice and a series of 
nagging injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been behind because of football and because I had a groin pull and a 
little hamstring problem," said Hannah, who made the 1989 All-Pacific 10 
Conference track and field team. "But my first goal is still to qualify (for 
the NCAA tourney) in the 400 meters against UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people are worried about me because I haven't had a (qualifying) time 
yet, but I'm not getting myself down." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Hannah said he puts pressure on himself to perform well. More than 
anything else, he wants to please his mother, Juanita Butler, and his brother, 
Leslie, 23. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always the sports one," Hannah said. "My brother was never in sports, 
but he's very proud of what I've done and brags about me playing on TV. 
</P>
<P>
"And my mom has been the most joyful thing in my life. She always took care of 
us, even when it was tough. 
</P>
<P>
"She's been worried if I'm going to be ready (for the UCLA meet). I don't want 
to let her down." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the inconvenience of missing track practices and meets, Hannah said he 
doesn't regret playing spring football. 
</P>
<P>
"This spring, I was basically all football," said Hannah, who had one catch for 
seven yards and two rushing attempts for 46 yards as a freshman flanker last 
fall. "I know that I have quite a few more steps to take in football. 
</P>
<P>
"I went into spring ball with a clear mind. I said to myself, 'OK, Travis, you 
have to show what you can do.' 
</P>
<P>
"I sat out a year and that set me back. And lot of people were saying, 'Hey, 
Travis, you're too small.' " 
</P>
<P>
But Hannah said he had a big-time spring. "I wanted to show my coaches that I 
can play," he added, "and they were really happy. They said, 'Travis, you have 
really showed us a lot.' 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that I had a great spring." 
</P>
<P>
He also feels comfortable as a member of the 1990 Trojans "because this team is 
very fast. It's built around speed this year." 
</P>
<P>
Hannah's confidence in his football future has been boosted by following the 
career of his cousin Stephen Baker, a 5-8, 160-pound former Fresno State and 
West Los Angeles College star who has spent the last three seasons as a wide 
receiver with the New York Giants. Baker had 13 catches for 255 yards and two 
touchdowns last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of grew up with him," Hannah said of Baker. "He told me, 'Travis, you 
don't have to be big. All you have to do is have speed and catch the ball. 
That's what the NFL likes.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hannah is planning on hooking up with Baker again later this year. "He's helped 
me a lot in the past," he said. "And he's going to help me this summer with 
patterns and other stuff. Basically, I'm following in his steps." 
</P>
<P>
From his enthusiasm about football, one might suspect that Hannah is a football 
player first and a track man second. But he steadfastly refuses to say that he 
likes one sport more than the other. "A lot of people ask me that -- which 
sport I prefer -- but I'm in the middle. It's a tie," he said. "I started off 
with football in high school, but track enabled me to be great in football. 
</P>
<P>
"I like football because it's a physical, contact sport, but track is very 
competitive, too. It's exciting when I get in my blocks, and it's like, 'Hey, 
nobody can beat me.' " 
</P>
<P>
And, Hannah added, he does not have to choose between the two sports. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what made my career at Hawthorne, and why I chose to come to USC -- the 
chance to do both," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He credits Cougar track Coach Kye Courtney for showing him the way to two-way 
athletic prowess. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Courtney showed (Conway and Hannah) that we had the ability to run track 
when we didn't know," he said. "Definitely, the coaching makes Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very strong and energetic and strive to make you the best. They make 
you believe in yourself, and that's what made me better in football, too." 
</P>
<P>
As he gave thanks to the role Courtney has played in his life, he turned the 
conversation back to the inspiration of his mother. 
</P>
<P>
"We talk on the phone a lot, and I tell her all the things I'm doing," he said. 
"I'm really glad she's stuck by me the way she always has. 
</P>
<P>
"Moving me and my brother away (from Los Angeles) and taking care of us all by 
herself. . . . I just hope I can take care of her some day, to repay her."

STRING OF SUCCESSES MARK MARTINEZ'S CAREER ; 
</P>
<P>
IN PIERCE'S BRAZEN FRESHMAN, MOST FOES DISCOVER THAT THEY HAVE MET THEIR MATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Al Martinez is in a rather peculiar dilemma, one that could jeopardize his 
chances for a men's junior college division singles title in this week's 91st 
Ojai Valley Tennis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
He has played too well this season. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, a Pierce College freshman, seldom is challenged by his junior college 
competition. Consequently, his on-court concentration has atrophied. He often 
appears bored during matches, chats with friends in the stands and watches 
passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't really been pressed," Pierce Coach Paul Xanthos said. "Right now, I 
don't think he's in the best condition. . . . He could have his hands full at 
Ojai." 
</P>
<P>
Endurance will be crucial in the tournament, which begins today and runs 
through Sunday. If he wins today, Martinez will play two singles and two 
doubles matches on Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
An injured rotator cuff and a bruised wrist had kept Martinez out of 
competition for the past three weeks. Still, Martinez (14-2) enters the 
tournament seeded No. 1 in his singles division. 
</P>
<P>
He made rapid recovery from the layoff in his first match back Tuesday, 
defeating Moorpark standout Mike Studebaker, 7-5, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Other area players who could challenge Martinez at Ojai include Jason Gary, his 
doubles partner at Pierce, Studebaker and Andy VanCott, also of Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
An upset by one of those three is unlikely. Martinez probably will get his 
toughest test from Santa Barbara's John Fox, whose record against Martinez this 
season is 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
But Moorpark Coach Bud Davis believes that bumping off Martinez will be a 
difficult task. 
</P>
<P>
"Al's in a class all by himself," Davis said. "He'll just keep improving 
provided he stays in shape. As long as his desire is there, the kid's got tons 
of talent. 
</P>
<P>
"He really doesn't belong at a junior college." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez carved through the Western State Conference schedule, losing just one 
match. He also won the No. 1 Division of the Sports Chalet tournament at Golden 
West College. He finished ninth in the Southern California Tennis Assn. men's 
open division standings. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, 19, also defeated Jason Netter, UCLA's top singles player, in a 
preseason match. "Killed him," Martinez said of the 6-4, 6-1 victory. "And 
(UCLA Coach) Glen Bassett was watching the match." 
</P>
<P>
The brazen confidence of Martinez seems unwavering, which often unnerves 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"Al doesn't even talk, he goes out and hits the ball," Gary said. "Kids come 
out and play Al and they're scared the minute they walk on the court. They just 
feel like they're gonna lose." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents might lose, but their demise often is drawn out. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't have the killer instinct," Xanthos said. "He'll beat a kid 6-0 and 
then he starts toying and gets himself in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez has a different theory. 
</P>
<P>
"I totally have the killer instinct," he said. "But when I'm playing someone, I 
figure if he's going to come all the way out here to play me, I might as well 
give the kid a workout. They start winning games and getting all pumped up and 
I just finish the match off." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, born and raised in Chile, moved to Calabasas in the seventh grade. 
Opting to play on a South American professional circuit, he dropped out of 
Calabasas High during his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
An outclassed Martinez struggled and qualified for just one tournament, losing 
in the first round. The experience didn't sour him on trying again -- perhaps 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I might go to Hawaii on the circuit and shoot down to South America," 
Martinez said. "I think it's time to start winning some money. Start getting my 
stuff together and play some serious tennis." 
</P>
<P>
Starting today.

NORTH HOLLYWOOD BATTLES DISSENSION IN 13-6 POLY WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poly High junior Jonathan Campbell made a lot of noise with his bat Wednesday, 
slugging two home runs and driving in four runs with three hits. But he 
probably drew more attention with his glove during Poly's 13-6 East Valley 
League win at North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell made a sparkling defensive play when he chased down Harry Marks' 
towering drive to make an over-the-shoulder catch about 390 feet from home 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell made the catch with his back to home plate. He ran so far out of the 
normal field of play that he scattered a group of North Hollywood football 
players practicing on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"Our outfield is awful tough," Poly Coach Jerry Cord said. "We've got a lot of 
speed out there." 
</P>
<P>
But while Campbell was tracking down long drives, some of North Hollywood's 
players were letting their tempers get away. An on-field shouting match between 
Marks and teammate Erik Martinez carried into the dugout and eventually led to 
one-game suspensions for Marks and third baseman Adrian Padilla. Both starters 
will miss today's rematch with Poly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's disgusting," North Hollywood Coach Marty Biegel said after a prolonged 
postgame team meeting. "It's the abomination of my life to see them do that. 
It's just sad." 
</P>
<P>
The problems began when Marks got into a loud disagreement with Martinez. In 
the dugout, after the fifth inning on-field incident, Marks told Biegel that he 
didn't want to catch anymore, prompting Biegel to bench Marks and move Padilla 
behind the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez (3-3), Wednesday's losing pitcher, persuaded the coaching staff to let 
him catch. Padilla, unhappy with the shifting, tore off his gear and made a 
remark to the staff that prompted his benching. 
</P>
<P>
All the while, North Hollywood was playing competitively with the 
league-leading Parrots (17-3, 12-0 in league play). In fact, Marks' titanic 
shot surely would have cleared any reasonably distanced fence -- the outfield 
at North Hollywood has none -- and would have given the Huskies a 7-5 lead in 
the fourth inning. Instead, they ended the inning trailing, 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth, a home run by Poly's Marlon McKinney made the score 6-4. That, in 
turn, led to the argument between Marks and Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood (7-8, 5-7), which made six errors, then sealed its own fate in 
the seventh inning, watching a 7-4 games degenerate into a 13-4 Poly lead. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got to look in the mirror today and know their embarrassment," Biegel 
said after the game. "It's got to be a learning experience." 
</P>
<P>
Biegel let the team vote whether to keep Marks and Padilla on the team. The 
vote was overwhelmingly in the players' favor.

WESTLAKE LAYS CLAIM TO SHARE OF ITS 1ST TITLE IN BASEBALL; 
</P>
<P>
HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL: TODD PRESTON, BATTLING AN 0-FOR-17 SLUMP, FOILS THOUSAND 
OAKS' STRATEGY IN 4-3 WARRIOR VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Todd Preston's season somehow managed to reach a new low after 6 1/2 long, 
embarrassing innings Wednesday in Westlake High's 4-3 win over Thousand Oaks in 
a Marmonte League baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
In front of an overflow crowd at Westlake High, Preston had committed three 
errors that led to two unearned runs. His season-long hitting slump, the latest 
an 0-for-17 streak, left him batting .189. 
</P>
<P>
He reached rock bottom when Thousand Oaks Coach Jim Hansen ordered two 
intentional walks in the bottom of the seventh to get at Preston's flailing 
bat. But Preston responded with a single past a drawn-in infield that broke a 
3-3 tie and guaranteed Westlake (20-1 overall, 9-0 in league play) at least a 
tie for its first league title. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't think I was a very good hitter, and that upset me," Preston said. 
"I wanted to show them I could hit." 
</P>
<P>
Preston did that when he sent a 2-2 pitch from Scott Barkman (4-2) bouncing 
through the hole between third base and shortstop to score Tim Falsken. Falsken 
had led off with a single that got past center fielder Brent Christenson -- 
whose two-run home run in the top of the inning had tied the score -- and 
enabled Falsken to reach third. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen ordered the second intentional walk to Mike Lieberthal, who is hitting 
.535 with a state-best 13 home runs and 37 runs batted in. Hansen also 
intentionally walked Keith Hess, Westlake's cleanup hitter, who has six home 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want Lieberthal to beat us, and the next kid is a good hitter too," 
Hansen said. "We wanted to work our way down the lineup, and we knew (Preston) 
was struggling." 
</P>
<P>
Preston answered with his 11th hit in 54 at-bats, and it saved an erratic 
Warrior performance. Westlake, ranked No. 1 in the Southern Section 5-A 
Division and No. 2 in USA Today's national poll, committed five errors. 
Lieberthal struck out twice, only the fourth and fifth times in 71 at-bats. And 
Eby, a senior left-hander who improved to 8-0 and set a school record for wins 
in a season, struggled despite allowing only one earned run. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake gave Eby a 2-0 lead in the first inning. Rob Neal and Falsken hit 
consecutive singles and Lieberthal was intentionally walked to load the bases. 
Hess' groundball was booted by Bryan Corey at shortstop, allowing Neal to 
score, and Dave Monheim drove in Falsken with a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake extended its lead to 3-0 in the fourth. Sean Howard singled, stole 
second, moved to third on Rick Wolters' single, and scored on Neal's groundout. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks (9-5, 6-3) threatened in the fourth when two Westlake errors put 
Lancers on second and third with two out. But Wolters, Westlake's second 
baseman, made a backhanded stop of Ryan Kritscher's grounder up the middle and 
threw Kritscher out at first to save at least one run. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the key play of the game," Westlake Coach Rich Herrera said. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks cut its deficit to 3-1 with a run in the sixth. Brett Herman 
singled with one out and went to second on Preston's error of a groundball hit 
by Corey. Kritscher singled to load the bases and Barkman walked to force in a 
run. 
</P>
<P>
In the seventh, Preston's third error at third base allowed David Skeels to 
reach base with one out. Christenson, who missed a game last week because of 
pneumonia, followed with a home run to left field that tied the score, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
The blast merely allowed Preston to end his slump in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been hitting the ball hard," Herrera said. "I thought it was about time 
for some of the balls to fall in someplace, and it happened." 
</P>
<P>
Neal and Falsken each had two hits for Westlake, which leads Thousand Oaks by 
three games with three league contests left.

LIEBERTHAL RATED NO. 3 PREP PROSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Lieberthal, a senior catcher at Westlake High, is rated the third-best 
high school prospect in the nation, according to a poll conducted by Baseball 
America magazine. The poll will be released in the magazine's May 10 issue. 
</P>
<P>
In a list of the nation's top 25 high school prospects available for baseball's 
amateur draft in June, Lieberthal is ranked behind Todd Van Poppel, a 
right-handed pitcher from Arlington Tex., and Chipper Jones, a shortstop from 
Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal, who has signed with Arizona State, is batting .535 (38 for 71) with 
13 home runs and 37 runs batted in. He is three home runs shy of tying the 
Southern Section single-season home run record set by Arnold Garcia of Channel 
Islands in 1981.

HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM STRETCHES STREAK TO 10 WINS WITH CONQUEST OF VAN NUYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Birmingham High jumped to a four-run lead and held on to beat visiting Van 
Nuys, 5-3, Wednesday for its 10th consecutive victory, the longest winning 
streak in Wayne Sink's 12 seasons as Birmingham's coach. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Mansfield and Josh Brown combined to limit Van Nuys to four hits in the 
Mid-Valley League game. Mansfield (4-3) struck out seven before Brown came on 
in the seventh to earn his first save of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Seth Rosenzweig drove in two runs. Birmingham (15-5-1, 9-4 in league 
play) scored five runs on four hits. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Gonzalez pitched a complete game for Van Nuys, which fell to 4-7, 4-7. 
</P>
<P>
In other baseball games: 
</P>
<P>
Monroe 7, Reseda 2 -- Senior left-hander Sean Henson threw five innings of 
no-hit ball before settling for a three-hitter to lead Monroe in a Mid-Valley 
League game at home. 
</P>
<P>
Henson (3-4) struck out four and walked two for Monroe (6-8, 4-7). Reseda's Ray 
Perez led off the sixth with a single to break up the no-hit bid. 
</P>
<P>
Right-hander Jesse Yeomans took the loss for Reseda (4-8, 5-10).

FATHER SEEKS ELIGIBILITY FOR MERRILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The father of high school pitcher Tajah Merrill, who transferred last week from 
Camarillo to Channel Islands, will file a hardship claim to regain the player's 
athletic eligibility even though it may be granted by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill, a junior left-hander with a 2-1 record, left Camarillo because of 
personal reasons, enrolled at Channel Islands two days later and pitched for 
the Raiders on his first day at his new school. The Southern Section suspended 
his eligibility, but he may regain it if the Merrills prove they have moved to 
the Channel Islands attendance area and have found a renter for their home in 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
For an athlete to remain eligible, the athlete and the family must change 
residence without maintaining two addresses. Tom Merrill, Tajah's father, said 
he will provide a rental agreement today that proves the family has only one 
residence. He also intends to sell the house. 
</P>
<P>
"If he provides the rental agreement, the kid will have eligibility," Southern 
Section administrator Dean Crowley said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Merrill will file a hardship claim because he wants to prove the move 
was made for reasons other than athletics and to keep open the possibility of 
moving back to Camarillo should the house prove difficult to sell. 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, this move had little to do with athletics," Tom Merrill said. "My 
son absolutely will not go back to Camarillo High. He never felt like he 
belonged at Camarillo." 
</P>
<P>
Merrill, who said his son likes the ethnic diversity at Channel Islands, added 
that he will file the claim early next week. The Southern Section can reach a 
decision in two days, Crowley said. 
</P>
<P>
Tajah Merrill had an 0.91 earned-run average in 23 innings for Camarillo and 
shut out Kennedy on two hits in March. For Channel Islands, he allowed five 
runs on four hits in one inning of a 17-12 loss to Thousand Oaks.

A bomb hidden in a dump truck exploded Wednesday as a vehicle carrying 
anti-terrorist police passed by in Medellin, Colombia's cocaine hub, killing at 
least six people and wounding about 36, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Acting President Horacio Serpa immediately called an emergency meeting of the 
National Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
The bombing came at 8:30 a.m. as a truck crept by carrying 20 members of 
Colombia's anti-terrorist strike force. The blast destroyed a shoe store and 
half a dozen automobiles and collapsed the roofs on several small stores and 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
At least four civilians and two police officers were killed and 26 civilians 
and eight police officers wounded, Medellin Police Chief Humberto Camero said.

ROCKINGHAM REGAINS ROLE BY DEFAULT 
</P>

<P>
There was a time when racing at Rockingham Park was the centerpiece of the New 
England thoroughbred season. Horses would run in Rhode Island during the 
winter, at Boston's Suffolk Downs in the spring and at the Rock during the 
summertime. Located on the Massachusetts-New Hampshire border, Rockingham was 
pretty, immaculate and well-run, and it was so popular that it drew average 
daily crowds of more than 15,000 during some years of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Rockingham has now reclaimed its old role as New England's pre-eminent track, 
only this time it has earned the distinction by default. There is no more New 
England thoroughbred circuit. Horses disappeared from Rhode Island (and were 
replaced by greyhounds) years ago. Suffolk Downs was shut down by owner Buddy 
LeRoux at the end of 1989. Rockingham has managed to survive by offering cheap 
racing at a modest physical plant. 
</P>
<P>
The decline of New England racing has been pitiful and slightly mystifying, 
because the region has the commodity most essential to any racetrack's success: 
Enthusiastic horseplayers. Greater Boston has a big blue-collar population that 
loves to gamble and manages to support two greyhound tracks, which operate 
concurrently, often with day-night doubleheaders. They love horses too. 
</P>
<P>
"These are great fans," said Rockingham publicist Bill Nader. "They put up with 
a lot -- maybe like nowhere in the country. One day here we had a blizzard and 
a sleet storm that was so bad that it took me an hour to scrape the ice off my 
windshield. And we still handled $130,000 on the card!" 
</P>
<P>
Besides this base of fans, New England always has had an exceptionally strong 
contingent of horsemen and horses. It had all the makings of a top racing 
circuit. "Racing here could be on the level of Maryland or New Jersey," said 
Rockingham General Manager Ed Callahan. 
</P>
<P>
What makes New England different from Maryland or New Jersey is that it is 
divided into political jurisdictions, none of which has ever displayed much 
concern for the well-being of the thoroughbred industry. Searching for 
increased revenues, each state authorized expansion of its racing dates and 
created head-on conflicts among the tracks, which succeeded in putting Rhode 
Island permanently out of the thoroughbred business. Rockingham and Suffolk 
coexisted until a fire destroyed most of the Rockingham grandstand in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Suffolk then started running year-round, and when Rockingham was reopened in 
1984, Suffolk's management wouldn't cede any part of the racing calendar. 
Operating in head-on conflict, neither track could prosper; both were 
struggling to survive. Because of its metropolitan location, Suffolk figured to 
be the stronger operation, but owner Buddy LeRoux thought his property was 
worth far more as real estate than it was as a racetrack -- so he shut it down, 
leaving New England horseplayers only with Rockingham and a steady diet of 
cheap claiming races. 
</P>
<P>
Racing fans in Massachusetts clung to the hope that a white knight would arrive 
and save horse racing in the state. The late Frank De Francis had been 
interested in buying or leasing Suffolk, and so had Ladbrokes, the huge British 
bookmaking firm, but both were put off by LeRoux's intransigence as well as the 
thicket of political problems in the state. Then came a new white knight: Ben 
Simone, a prominent road builder, who proposed to erect a track in the town of 
Wrentham. Even an ordinarily cynical journalist said: "We're used to ripping 
everybody involved in racing here, but nobody knocks this guy. He's a gentleman 
and a sportsman. He wants to do it right." 
</P>
<P>
Simone owned the land and had the necessary capital; all he needed was approval 
of a town referendum. On Monday night, the citizens of Wrentham voted down his 
plan for a racetrack. Massachusetts is back to square one. 
</P>
<P>
Since Massachusetts has been without a horse track, business at the Rock has 
been booming -- it is up 35 percent over a year ago -- and track management has 
earmarked this windfall for improvement of the physical facilities and 
increases in purses. But Rockingham is still afraid to make an all-out 
commitment to becoming a top-class facility, for fear of what might happen in 
the neighboring state. "I think it's definite that Massachusetts will be back," 
Callahan said. "I don't see how New England is going to go without another 
track." 
</P>
<P>
If that happens, he said, "Ideally what I'd like to see is all the states try 
to get together, have tracks with seasonal operations and try to put together a 
regional off-track betting system. It's on the horizon, and Maine, Vermont and 
New Hampshire are all looking for new income." Of course, such interstate 
cooperation may be a pipe dream, because it was the lack of interstate 
cooperation on racing dates that has created so many problems. 
</P>
<P>
For the foreseeable future, anyway, New England racing will be synonymous with 
Rockingham Park. The track's management is able and well-intentioned but it 
faces a formidable task if it wants to upgrade its facilities or the quality of 
its competition to anything approaching a major-league level. On a recent 
Sunday, there wasn't a single horse on the entire card who was worth more than 
$7,500. It will be a long time before New England's long-suffering but devoted 
horseplayers get the quality of racing they deserve.

FORMER OCCIDENTAL CATCHER CROSSED UP BY MISCHIEF-MAKERS

<TEXT>
<P>
It's never too late to recount a good April Fools' Day hoax, which is why the 
following prank, perpetrated a few years ago by a group of Occidental College 
baseball players, is worth passing along. 
</P>
<P>
Professional baseball scouts feverishly scour the region for talent, but 
Occidental -- a school where high GPA's earn more praise than low ERA's -- is 
rarely a scheduled stop. 
</P>
<P>
During his senior season in 1987, catcher Tim Klement was the closest thing to 
a professional prospect on the Tigers' roster. 
</P>
<P>
Before a home game against Colorado College, teammate Jim Delzell told Klement 
that a scout was in the stands. Actually, the mysterious onlooker was part of 
an elaborate prank. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps feeling the stranger's gaze, Klement struggled during the early 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
"He kept looking up at this guy and he had a miserable game," recalled Doug 
Madgic, another teammate. Klement recovered, however, and blasted a 
game-winning home run. 
</P>
<P>
The strong finish only primed Klement for Stage 2: the phone call. 
</P>
<P>
The field house phone rang that evening and Klement snapped it up like a pitch 
in the dirt. Little did he know that the caller was about to deliver a wicked 
curve and his own ego was about to take a slider. 
</P>
<P>
It was the scout. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart got going a little bit," admitted Klement, who initially was timid 
but soon unabashedly told the scout of his prowess behind the plate. 
</P>
<P>
One by one, teammates headed into the next room, stifling laughter as they 
passed the phone. "I'm seeing all these guys disappear into the other room and 
it's not dawning on me," Klement said. 
</P>
<P>
Mercifully, the caller finally informed Klement that he was a victim of an 
April Fools' Day trick. 
</P>
<P>
But to Klement's chagrin, the conversation had been taped. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys on the other lines in the clubhouse lost their lunch, they were 
laughing so hard," Madgic said. "We played the tape in the field house as we 
were getting changed for the next couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Tim didn't dress with us." 
</P>
<P>
Klement, now a sheriff's deputy in Sylmar, said that the situation could have 
been worse. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank goodness for small miracles that the machine was not as high-tech as 
they thought and it was very poor quality," he said, laughing. "That's all I 
needed, having the recording played over the college radio station at lunch."

Question: This is not one of those life-and-death questions that you often get. 
</P>
<P>
I would just like to know if the little piece of absorbent cotton that comes 
with bottles of pills should be left in or thrown away once the bottle is 
opened. Or does it make any difference? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The piece of cotton that is often found on the top of medication 
bottles is designed to prevent the pills or tablets from breaking. Ordinarily, 
you would remove the cotton.

'Nasty' Found Obscene in Ohio: "As Nasty as They Wanna Be," the sexually 
explicit album by the Miami-based rap group 2 Live Crew, is too nasty for 
Cincinnati. According to a decision reached Wednesday by the Hamilton County 
Vice Squad, the controversial million-selling album was deemed a violation of 
Ohio obscenity statutes. 
</P>
<P>
When police visited the five stores in the county that carried the album, only 
one of them had the uncensored version. The store promptly removed the album at 
the police's request. There was no hearing or court proceeding involved in 
naming the album obscene, only a decision by Sherriff Simon Leif, who was 
involved in the recent controversy over the Robert Mapplethorpe exhibit in 
Cincinnati, and the vice squad. BETH KLEID

</P>
<P>
Carl Buchberg, the attorney for Gabor the retiree, not Gabor the actress, said 
Wednesday his client has a few things in common with the star of "Green Acres," 
but they definitely are not one and the same. The two Gabors spell their names 
the same way, are about the same age and both were born in Hungary. Gabor, the 
retiree, claims she slipped and fell while shopping at a Ralphs market in Los 
Angeles on March 15. BETH KLEID

Tower First Woman to Win Honor: Composer Joan Tower is the 1990 recipient of 
the prestigious, $150,000 Grawemeyer Award from the University of Louisville.

'Independence' Not Free to Open: A temporary restraining order was issued 
Wednesday against the Gnu Theater's unauthorized production of Lee Blessing's 
play "Independence," which had been scheduled to open tonight in North 
Hollywood. The order, by Los Angeles County Supervisor Court Judge Thomas C. 
Murphy, had been sought by the producers of an authorized staging of the same 
play, scheduled to open Friday at the Burbank Theater Guild. A hearing on a 
permanent injunction will be held Wednesday. BETH KLEID

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: 'CABIN IN THE COTTON' SCREENS IN MICHAEL CURTIZ 
RETROSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
FILM: UCLA ARCHIVE HONORS HUNGARIAN DIRECTOR GYULA GAZDAG; TWO OF OSCAR 
MICHEAUX'S WEAKER EFFORTS OFFERED IN THE SERIES AT THE FOUR STAR.

When Bette Davis became the first woman to receive the American Film 
Institute's life achievement award in 1977, she ended her heartfelt acceptance 
speech saying, "As I say good night, I would like to quote my favorite line 
from all of the pictures I have made: 'Ah'd love to kiss ya but ah just washed 
mah hair!' " 
</P>
<P>
The first of the famous Davis lines occurred in "Cabin in the Cotton" (1932), 
which screens today at 5:30 p.m. at UCLA's Melnitz Theater as part of the UCLA 
Film Archive's "Directed by Michael Curtiz" retrospective. 
</P>
<P>
Today the film is virtually forgotten except for that line, but "Cabin in the 
Cotton" is far from the kind of campy item that Davis' remark suggests. It 
instead belongs to the Warner Bros. cycle of socially conscious dramas and 
stars Richard Barthelmess as a serious, dutiful Southerner, the son of a 
burned-out sharecropper. The local plantation owner (Berton Churchill) takes 
him under his wing but expects him to become his toadie in return. 
</P>
<P>
An expose of the feudal exploitation of tenants by planters, "Cabin in the 
Cotton" is hard-hitting and authentic to the extent of showing blacks to be 
worse off than poor whites -- and even reveals the whites' casual racism. 
Adapted by Paul Green from a novel by Harry Harrison Kroll, the film becomes 
very much a message movie, but Davis undercuts its preachiness as Churchill's 
uninhibited, shallow blond daughter who comes on strong to the shy Barthelmess, 
who is the recipient of the famous line, expressed throwaway style. 
</P>
<P>
"Cabin in the Cotton" is talky, often stagy but largely entertaining. "Cabin in 
the Cotton" will be followed at 7:30 by a "Critic's Choice" presentation of 
Richard Rush's "The Stunt Man" (1978), with Rush and Gentleman's Quarterly 
critic Kenneth Turan leading a panel discussion. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday at 7:30 p.m., the archive honors Hungarian director Gyula Gazdag, 
currently a visiting professor at UCLA, and his film "Stand Off" (1988). If you 
missed it at the AFI Fest, it's well worth catching up with this film that is 
at once as suspenseful as Hitchcock and a devastating expression of the 
frustration that has since erupted into revolution all over Eastern Europe. The 
film opens with a father ordering his son Zoltan (Ary Beri) to get rid of his 
punk haircut; the son retaliates by having his head shaved. 
</P>
<P>
Before we or anyone in the film realizes it, Zoltan, a tall, rangy youth of 
about 18, and his younger brother Istvan (Gabor Svidrony) have taken hostage 16 
girls in a dormitory in a student hostel in a Hungarian border town. Zoltan 
demands a flight out of Budapest -- and a million dollars. "There isn't a 
million dollars in all of Hungary!," exclaims one of the captives, but Zoltan 
dreams of "London, Paris, night life -- freedom forever!" 
</P>
<P>
In the grueling battle of wills that ensues between Zoltan and a shrewd 
lieutenant colonel (top Polish actor Zbigniew Zapasiewicz, best-known for 
Krzysztof Zanussi's "Camouflage), we learn that the boys are the sons of a 
pompous, authoritarian frontier guard (who of course taught them to be 
sharpshooters); we learn from the boys' bitter mother that the family is much 
hated in the community, as is every soldier or party official's family. 
</P>
<P>
There's a terrific you-are-there documentary quality to this intense and rueful 
film, in which Oscar-winning Hungarian director Istvan Szabo turns actor in a 
key role and which has a rich, dramatic score by Istvan Martha reminiscent of 
Bernard Herrmann. 
</P>
<P>
"Lying Lips" (1939) and "The Girl From Chicago" (1932), which screen today at 
1:30 p.m. in the Black Talkies on Parade film festival at the Four Star, are 
not among black pioneer filmmaker Oscar Micheaux's better films, to put it 
kindly. Melodramas with musical interludes, awkwardly constructed and 
amateurishly acted, they yet are stirring expressions of black middle class 
aspirations. The first exposes the predicament of nightclub entertainers who 
are expected to prostitute themselves after hours, while the second condemns 
the numbers racket. Information: (213) 737-3292, (213) 733-951, (213) 737-3585.

Following are The Times' recommendations for today's schedule of the American 
Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival (AFIFEST), with 
commentary by the film reviewing staff. Information: (213) 480-3232 or (213) 
520-2000. 
</P>
<P>
Highly recommended: 
</P>
<P>
"THE BEEKEEPER"(Greece; Director: Theo Angelopoulos; Cineplex Century Plaza). 
Like all of Angelopoulos' work, this one -- a contemporary drama and road 
movie, starring Marcello Mastroianni -- is hauntingly sad, mysteriously 
beautiful. It's a homage of sorts to Michelangelo Antonioni, a definitive 
poetic portrait of an aging man facing disillusionment, pain, isolation, the 
lusts of youth, possible destruction. (Michael Wilmington). 
</P>
<P>
"SITTING PRETTY ON A BRANCH"(Czechoslovakia; Director: Juraj Jakubisko; 
Cineplex Odeon Fairfax). A comic fairy tale on the aftermath of World War II, 
with a clown from a concentration camp searching for a stolen bicycle full of 
hidden gold, this is a magical film, a return to the great '60s period of 
Czechoslovakian cinema. (Sheila Benson). 
</P>
<P>
Recommended: 
</P>
<P>
"THE LONG WAY HOME"(U.S.; Director: Michael Apted; AFI Mark Goodson). This 
documentary has a priceless subject, which it reveals with dispassionate skill: 
the rocky road traveled by the underground Leningrad rock band, Aquarium, after 
signing its first Western recording contract. (M. W.) 
</P>
<P>
"TIE ME UP, TIE ME DOWN"(Spain; Director: Pedro Almodovar; Century Plaza). This 
comedy about sexual bondage, while using many of the Almodovar stock company, 
has less of the inspired, dead-ahead zaniness of his earlier successes. His 
fans may not mind. (S.B.)

HILLSIDE HOUSE SIZES REMAIN UNRESOLVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETSY BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles city planners squared off this week against a citizens advisory 
committee chosen 19 months ago to map out a plan to control growth for the 
steep hillsides and scenic ridges of Mt. Washington and Glassell Park. 
</P>
<P>
Left unresolved by the two sides after three hours of haggling was the most 
significant question that has arisen during development of the growth-control 
plan: How big can a house be before it dwarfs those around it, blocks panoramic 
views and undermines a community's rustic flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Some of that flavor is being whittled away, said Bob Wolfe, a Mt. Washington 
resident, while the city and the citizens committee debate how to preserve the 
area's character. 
</P>
<P>
"We have seen incredible changes in Mt. Washington just since this committee 
was formed," Wolfe said at Monday's meeting, citing a number of large houses 
built on small lots during the past two years, as real estate values have 
risen. "What we feared would happen in five years has happened in one year." 
</P>
<P>
City planners and members of the citizens committee agree that restrictions 
should be placed on the size of new homes or homes undergoing major remodeling. 
But the planners and the citizens committee have devised two completely 
different formulas to limit the scale of new development. 
</P>
<P>
The citizens committee favors a formula based on the ratio of proposed floor 
space to the area of each lot that can be used for construction. The numbers in 
the formula would change depending on lot size, to allow for "reasonable" 
development on small lots without permitting oversized houses on larger lots. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Department, seeking a simpler standard, prefers one that would 
permit a house's footprint -- the outline it would make on the land -- to take 
up 30% of any lot that slopes up from a road, or 35% of any lot that slopes 
down from a road. The permitted height of new homes would depend on the slope 
of the lot. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Department's formula is figured on the entire size of a lot, not 
just its space that can be used for construction. Committee members said such a 
formula would allow developers to plunge extra stories down steep hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
The citizens committee also objects to the city formula because it wouldn't 
take into account the total "bulk" of a house as it sits on its lot, said 
committee Chairman Donald Bloss. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Department, on the other hand, considers the committee plan to be 
so complex as to be incomprehensible to city staff members who review the 
blueprints that must be submitted to the city for approval. 
</P>
<P>
"What good is a plan if it won't be implemented properly?" asked Sutton. "We 
come up with all these nice plans that nobody understands, and when developers 
come in for sign-off, I can't even tell you how many mistakes there are." 
</P>
<P>
Bloss, a Mt. Washington resident, said the Planning Department was trying to 
override the will of the citizens committee. 
</P>
<P>
Committee member Laurie Weir charged that the Planning Department's formula 
would have the effect of encouraging development on the steepest hillsides, 
since more floor space would be permitted on sharply sloped lots. 
</P>
<P>
"On this hill, we can't assume dumb developers," she said . "We . . . were 
hoping the really steep lots would be left as almost vertical green plains." 
</P>
<P>
Weir said that the committee originally was told to come up with a plan based 
on the unique needs and characteristics of Mt. Washington. Suddenly, a year 
later, the Planning Department decided it wanted all hillside communities to 
conform to one simple plan, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"This committee was not told when we set out that we needed to fit in," Weir 
said. "We were told we were this special little community." 
</P>
<P>
Some compromises between the citizens and planners were achieved during 
Monday's meeting at the Carlin G. Smith Recreation Center atop the historic 
mountain community. 
</P>
<P>
The planners agreed to toughen the department's recommendations to the city 
Planning Commission for new off-street parking requirements in the area. The 
committee-backed proposal, which the planners agreed to accept, would require 
any new Mt. Washington house of more than 2,600 square feet to include at least 
one additional off-street parking space. 
</P>
<P>
The planners, led by principal neighborhood planner Robert H. Sutton, said they 
would recommend at the committee's request that the owners of recreational 
vehicles -- dubbed "monsters" by the committee -- be required to screen them 
from public view. 
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to delete language that would have obligated new homeowners to 
paint their homes in "subdued" colors, in response to a plea from the Mt. 
Washington-Glassell Park Specific Plan Citizens Advisory Committee for a 
development plan that would allow more diversity. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the citizens and planners said Mt. Washington's rural character 
should be protected by preserving walking trails and promoting shopping and 
child care within the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to create so-called "scenic corridors" along Mt. Washington 
Drive and San Rafael Avenue, where development would be required to be low 
enough to not block scenic views. 
</P>
<P>
Architectural diversity would be encouraged, native plants would be protected, 
and walls and fences would have to be limited in height. 
</P>
<P>
The committee decided to meet with planners again at 7 p.m. on May 7 at the 
Recreation Center to try to work out compromises on the issues left unresolved. 
Then, a public hearing will on the neighborhood specific plan will be 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Once public input has been heard, the Planning Department staff will present 
its recommendations, along with those from the committee, to the Los Angeles 
City Planning Commission for a vote.

YAROSLAVSKY WANTS UCLA TO ALLOW CITY ROLE IN DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN and PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky has asked UCLA to give the city the 
right to vote on its 4.45-million-square-foot, long-range development plan to 
save "the surrounding Westwood community from being engulfed by unchecked 
growth" on the campus. 
</P>
<P>
The request, if granted, would bring the university under local land-use 
regulations, an unprecedented situation. As a state institution, UCLA answers 
only to the UC Board of Regents on growth matters. The Westwood-area councilman 
also proposed that the city have a voice in any plan to increase the number of 
students or employees on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky's request was prompted by a 15-year growth plan released in March 
that would increase the size of the campus square footage by about one-third. 
Chancellor Charles E. Young said then that the expansion is essential to keep 
UCLA in the top echelon of teaching and research facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The development plan includes replacement of all patient rooms at UCLA Medical 
Center and construction of a residential village for 2,700 graduate students 
and faculty on what is known as "Lot 32," a finger of land that reaches down 
from the main campus and abuts Wilshire Boulevard, west of Gayley Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to Yaroslavsky's request, Vice Chancellor Peter W. Blackman said in 
a written statement that he is confident the 15-year plan can be fulfilled in a 
manner "that remains sensitive to community concerns." However, Blackman said, 
the issues could be resolved within the current structure without allowing the 
city control over UCLA's plans. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Young, Yaroslavsky commended the plan for the residential 
village and said he did not have a problem with space for libraries or 
child-care facilities. But Yaroslavsky said he quarrels with adding 3 
million-plus square feet of medical, academic and administrative facilities to 
nearly 3 million square feet of development already under construction or in 
the pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
The combined square footage represents "more than all the commercial 
development along Wilshire Boulevard in the Westwood community. . . . It is a 
staggering figure," Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
Concurring with a suggestion made at a public hearing on the plan, Yaroslavsky 
advised UCLA to look outside the congested Westwood area to build some of its 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky also called on the school to abandon plans for a conference center 
that would include rooms for overnight lodging in the southwest area of campus 
that runs west of Gayley Avenue. "This is simply more than the infrastructure 
can absorb," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Separate reports from city departments question the formula by which the 
university concluded that the expansion would add no additional traffic to the 
already gridlocked community. Principal City Transportation Engineer Allyn 
Rifkin called on UCLA to build its own exit from the San Diego Freeway, among 
other traffic mitigation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
City engineers also opined that the expansion will have regional impact and 
thus should be subject to review by public agencies to monitor its effect on 
air quality and other environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Local homeowner groups who also oppose the plan were not immediately impressed 
at the prospect of turning the matter over to the city, which they allege has a 
poor track record with respect to regulating commercial development in 
Westwood. "We're at gridlock now, so to turn over more for the city to decide 
would (lead to) double gridlock," said Sandy Brown, vice president of the 
Westwood-Holmby Property Owners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Friends of Westwood President Laura Lake said she doubted whether UC regents 
would cede control to local government. And, if they did, it would be like "the 
fox guarding the chicken." 
</P>
<P>
UC Berkeley's chancellor last year signed an agreement with Berkeley giving the 
city an advisory role on campus development. But the agreement is not binding, 
according to university spokesman Ray Colvig, because "the university cannot 
abdicate its responsibility as a state agency."

ORTHODOX JEWS IN HANCOCK PARK SEEK, RECEIVE DELAY IN MALATHION SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some argue that political intervention did the trick. Others look to the 
heavens. Who can say? 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that Friday's scheduled malathion spraying of Hancock Park has been 
put back by an hour and a half, long enough for the Orthodox Jews who live 
there to stroll to synagogue, walk to dinner and scurry home before the 
helicopters arrive. 
</P>
<P>
The Orthodox follow a strict interpretation of Jewish law, which says to honor 
the Sabbath and keep it holy. In practice, this means a ban on driving from 
sundown Friday until three stars come out Saturday night, among other 
restrictions. Often, people who walk to friends' homes for dinner do not get 
home until late. 
</P>
<P>
But officials of the California Department of Food and Agriculture, who are 
battling the area's infestation of Mediterranean fruit flies, did not have the 
Sabbath in mind when they targeted an area bounded on the north by Beverly 
Boulevard, on the east by Vermont Avenue, on the south by Adams Boulevard and 
on the west by Redondo Boulevard and La Brea Avenue for aerial malathion 
spraying at 10 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Hancock Park, once a white Gentile enclave but lately home to many Orthodox 
families, is tucked into the northwest corner of the target zone. The 
announcement, which came in the mail earlier this week, set off a flurry of 
phone calls to local and state officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in contact with the Department of Agriculture to see what could be 
done to meet the needs of the people," said J.J. Kaplan, an aide to state Sen. 
David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles). "They don't want to be sprayed on when 
they're walking home." 
</P>
<P>
Roberti represents the area and packs considerable clout as president pro tem 
of the Senate. But Bill Callison, special assistant in the Agriculture 
Department's Division of Plant Industry, said that special requests had nothing 
to do with the postponement. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't start taking every request and trying to reschedule," he said. In 
this case, he said, a spraying set for San Dimas earlier in the week had been 
scrubbed because of rain. It was rescheduled for 10 p.m. Friday in order to 
have a better chance of good visibility in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the helicopters will not reach Hancock Park and surrounding areas 
until 11:30 p.m., and North Hollywood, also the home to many Orthodox Jews, 
will be undisturbed until about 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"We satisfied our operational needs, and it turned out that that fit well with 
the people's needs. We're happy with that and so are they," Callison said. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Meyer H. May, associate director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center and a 
resident of Hancock Park, was among those who called Callison's office to ask 
for a delay. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted him to adjust the timetable so that it wouldn't impede the flow 
of Jews to their synagogues and their Sabbath meals," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although he is convinced that political pressure played a part, "I'm happy they 
had a cancellation in San Dimas, for whatever reason," May said. 
</P>
<P>
Callison said the state intends to stop the aerial spraying of malathion May 9, 
when enough sterile Medflies should be available to take over as the primary 
weapon in the fight to eradicate the insect, which is regarded as a serious 
threat to the state's production of fruits and vegetables.

HIRING CENTER FOR DAY LABORERS OKD; 
</P>
<P>
MALIBU: A PRIVATE GROUP HOPES A CENTER AT ZUMA BEACH WILL STOP COMPLAINTS ABOUT 
DAY LABORERS CONGREGATING ALONG PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to reduce complaints that too many day laborers are congregating 
along Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, a private nonprofit group has been given 
the go-ahead from county officials to open a hiring center for the workers at 
Zuma Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We think (the hiring center) provides a benefit to the workers, and at the 
same time addresses the concerns of some in the business community," said Capt. 
Don Mauro, who oversees the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's Malibu 
station. 
</P>
<P>
The hiring center, modeled after a center set up last October by the city of 
Los Angeles at Harbor Regional Park, is scheduled to open May 5 at a one-acre 
site owned by the county near the entrance to Zuma Beach. 
</P>
<P>
It will be operated largely by volunteers from the Malibu Coalition for the 
Homeless and the Dayworker. The newly formed group is headed by Honey 
Coatsworth, founder and director of the Artifac Tree, a nonprofit thrift shop 
in Malibu involved in charitable causes. 
</P>
<P>
"My own view is that a solid effort to help these people is long overdue, and 
we're pleased to be a part of it," Coatsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 100 to 150 day laborers, many of whom are from Mexico and Central 
America, commute to Malibu from Los Angeles each day hoping to find jobs 
clearing brush or helping at construction sites. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the workers come on Southern California Rapid Transit District buses, 
getting off at one of several gathering spots, from Las Flores Road near the 
east end of the seaside community to Trancas Canyon Road on the west. The Zuma 
Beach site is also served by RTD buses. 
</P>
<P>
Some merchants who have pushed for the hiring center say privately that the 
plan may offer the best chance to reduce problems they say have resulted from 
laborers congregating in front of their businesses, which they say has driven 
away customers. 
</P>
<P>
"No one wants to talk about the visual blight aspect of it for fear of being 
considered insensitive, but we're definitely looking for some relief," said one 
business owner, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Alexander, who owns Alexander's Trancas Market, where laborers frequently 
gather looking for work, called the Zuma Beach plan promising, saying that it 
"offers the opportunity to help people in ways they're not currently being 
helped." 
</P>
<P>
Modeled on the Harbor City center set up in Los Angeles, the Malibu center will 
provide day laborers with breakfast, English instruction and access to public 
restrooms. It will operate from 6 a.m. until noon every day but Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Employers seeking workers there will be asked to register, and a minimum wage 
of $5 an hour will be asked, although not required, Coatsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
Employers who hire undocumented immigrants can be fined under the 1986 federal 
Immigration Reform and Control Act. But, as with the Harbor City center, U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization Service agents have agreed to stay away from the 
Zuma Beach site if it helps alleviate congestion along Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the center came about several months ago after merchants 
complained that too many day laborers loitering near their businesses were 
intimidating customers and hurting business. 
</P>
<P>
The Artifac Tree agreed to coordinate the effort and set aside $10,000 for the 
project. One of the volunteers at the shop donated another $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
For several months, volunteers from the Artifac Tree have been providing hot 
meals three mornings a week at the four primary sites along Pacific Coast 
Highway where day laborers congregate. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel like we've won the trust of a lot of these people, and for several 
weeks now we've been telling them to spread the word about the Zuma Beach 
center," volunteer Connie Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
Mauro said that once the Zuma Beach center is open, deputies will step up 
patrols at sites along the highway where the laborers currently gather, 
encouraging them and would-be employers to use the hiring center. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not use the term crackdown, but if (the hiring center) is to be 
successful, there will have to be a law enforcement component at the old 
locations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The new center will be a good thing," said laborer Jose Ibarra, who said he 
commutes from near downtown Los Angeles to a spot near Pacific Coast Highway 
and Trancas Canyon Road each morning. 
</P>
<P>
However, others interviewed there and at two other Malibu locations where the 
men frequently congregate were not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"If everybody goes there, then there may be even less work for us than there is 
now," said a worker, who said he often is able to find work only one or two 
days a week. "For myself, I will have to wait and see."

JUDGE FINDS OFFICER'S SPEECH RIGHTS WERE VIOLATED

Police Chief Lawrence Binkley violated an officer's right of freedom of speech 
when the chief reprimanded the officer for writing a critical letter to a 
newspaper, a federal judge in Los Angeles has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Greg Roberts' letter to the Press-Telegram last October was an 
"expression fully protected by the First Amendment," U.S. District Court Judge 
Ronald S.W. Lew wrote in his opinion. The case is scheduled to go before a jury 
Sept. 18 to determine damages. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts' letter, which was published Oct. 17, said "incompetent police 
management" was responsible for inadequate patrol staffing. Binkley reprimanded 
Roberts, saying the letter violated department rules against insubordination 
and brought the department into disrepute. 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling, Lew said that employees can't be disciplined for speaking out on 
matters of public concern and that the officer's letter "clearly regards a 
matter of public concern." 
</P>
<P>
Police response time "is a matter of great public concern," the judge wrote. 
The April 4 ruling was released this week by the officer's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The chief declined to comment this week, noting that other lawsuits are 
pending. In the past, he has argued that officers with complaints should go 
through the chain of command and not air their grievances in public. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts was one of at least eight officers who were reprimanded, investigated 
or threatened with an investigation last year after making public comments on 
the department or its management. At the time, Binkley and the police union 
were entangled in a bitter contract dispute, and both sides frequently tossed 
barbs at each other. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts and three other officers filed lawsuits against Binkley and the city. 
Roberts' lawsuit is the first to be heard in court. 
</P>
<P>
The officer is seeking unspecified damages and is asking that the reprimand be 
removed from his personnel records. His attorney, James E. Trott, said he hopes 
the two sides will settle before the jury trial. Attorneys for the city could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling was hailed by Mike Tracy, president of the Police Officers Assn. 
"It's critical to the public interest that officers not be censored," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuits appear to have halted the policy of investigating officers' public 
comments. Union leaders said they have not heard of any such cases since the 
first lawsuit was filed Nov. 3 by a dispatcher who was also reprimanded for 
writing a letter to the Press-Telegram. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager James C. Hankla said he did not know whether there has been a 
change in policy but hinted that if not, one may be forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody tried to implement any Draconian measures," Hankla said. "(But) if the 
court feels it was an infringement, then the best response to a letter to the 
editor is a letter to the editor."

LONG BEACH: PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR ARGUES THAT THE TRASH PLANT CONTRACT, WHICH 
ROSE FROM $15,000 TO $5 MILLION, HAS SAVED MONEY.

<TEXT>
<P>
City management this week leaped to the defense of a trash plant consulting 
contract that has grown from $15,000 to nearly $5 million since 1982, insisting 
that the increase was appropriate and reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions raised last week, the city's public works director, Ray 
Holland, argued that if anything, the contract with Rigo &amp; Rigo Associates 
of Berea, Ohio, has saved the city money. 
</P>
<P>
"Other projects have spent that much or more just to get to the point of going 
out to bid," Holland told a Tuesday meeting of the advisory board of the 
Southeast Resource Recovery Facility, the city's trash-to-energy incinerator on 
Terminal Island. 
</P>
<P>
Holland said Long Beach had intended from the beginning to use minimal city 
staffing for the project and instead rely on consulting expertise to oversee 
the planning and construction of the incinerator, which burns the city's refuse 
to produce electricity. Such expertise was not available locally, Holland said, 
because there are so few trash-burning plants in California. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Holland said, the need for Rigo's services has continued because of 
the problems the city encountered with the firm that built the plant. 
</P>
<P>
The city alleges in a lawsuit against Dravo Corp. of Pittsburgh that the plant 
is not operating properly because of Dravo's construction failings. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently concerned that the contract dispute might give ammunition to Dravo 
in the lawsuit, the incinerator board of directors and City Council members 
were surprisingly silent on the matter Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The council accepted Holland's remarks and an explanation from Rigo's president 
without comment, along with recommendations from the city auditor that the city 
tighten up its overall contract consulting practices. 
</P>
<P>
Questions about the Rigo contract are potentially damaging to the city's 
position in the Dravo lawsuit, for it was Rigo that concluded that Dravo had 
not properly built the problem-plagued incinerator. 
</P>
<P>
"Dravo lawyers have to be licking their chops," a high-ranking city official 
said earlier this week. "This is like shooting fish in a barrel." 
</P>
<P>
Holland and City Auditor Robert Fronke said they had found nothing improper 
about Rigo's expense billings, which included an average monthly travel budget 
of $11,050 last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I find nothing in there to indicate there was any impropriety or 
inappropriateness," Fronke said, while conceding that his office should have 
asked Rigo &amp; Rigo for more documentation of expenses. 
</P>
<P>
President Greg Rigo provided more such information when asked recently, and 
Fronke said the city will soon resume payments on the contract -- which had 
been temporarily suspended by Fronke's office. 
</P>
<P>
Fronke gave the council a computer analysis his office had drawn up of Rigo's 
expenses in the last four years, showing an average per-diem expense per person 
of $127, minus car rental costs, and an average per-meal, per-person cost of 
$22. 
</P>
<P>
The questions about Rigo were enough to prompt City Manager James Hankla to 
appoint his own "auditor," accountant Ed Hatzenbuhler, to monitor the 
incinerator operation. 
</P>
<P>
Hankla said Monday that he has not lost confidence in Fronke but that in 
addition to reviewing Rigo's expenses, Hatzenbuhler will monitor future 
incinerator spending. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, the position is permanent. I don't want somebody not 
asking for something and then coming back three years later and saying, 
'Whoops,' " Hankla said, in an apparent reference to Fronke's admission that he 
should have previously asked for more expense information from Rigo &amp; Rigo. 
</P>
<P>
Fronke said it was his understanding that Hatzenbuhler had been added to the 
plant staff to bolster the administration, not as an auditor. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally with the discussion of the Rigo contract, Fronke also presented 
to the council a report suggesting varied changes in the way the city awards 
consulting contracts to make the process more competitive. Fronke said he has 
been working on the report for months, so it was just a coincidence that it was 
released when questions arose about Rigo &amp; Rigo. 
</P>
<P>
In his report, which the council forwarded to the city manager without comment, 
Fronke recommends that the city give price greater weight in deciding which 
firms should get consulting contracts of more than $50,000. The city practice 
has been to award contracts based on a firm's qualifications rather than its 
bids. 
</P>
<P>
Fronke also suggested that: 
</P>
<P>
The City Council be given more information about the number of firms competing 
for a contract when contracts go before the council for approval. 
</P>
<P>
Contracts be more tightly written to include expiration dates and payment 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
During the last fiscal year, Fronke found that all city departments spent a 
total of $13.4 million on consultants. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, I think they've been appropriately used," Fronke said, adding that 
the total consulting figure is lower than he expected, because it includes a 
large number of people who were really part-time workers for various 
departments, rather than true consultants.

SCHOOL BOARD CENSURED BY TEACHER UNION; 
</P>
<P>
COMPTON: THE STATE'S LARGEST FACULTY UNION ALSO ASKS SUPT. HONIG TO INVESTIGATE 
WHAT IT CALLS DEPLORABLE CONDITIONS AT SCHOOLS.

<P>
The president of the state's largest teachers union said "deplorable" 
conditions in the Compton Unified School District led his group to adopt a 
resolution that censures the school board and asks state Superintendent of 
Public Instruction Bill Honig to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
"We're having teachers bailing out because there's no hope, no support," said 
Ed Foglia, president of the California Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, nothing is being done," he said, referring to the district's 
decaying school buildings, high student dropout rate, low test scores and 
teacher salaries that rank among the lowest in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"We're asking that the state of California do something about Compton," Foglia 
said, "and (saying) that the superintendent would be the person to do it. . . . 
Somebody has to call attention to the situation." 
</P>
<P>
The censure resolution, which was recently adopted by CTA's executive board, 
was requested by Compton teachers, who are locked in a salary dispute with the 
district and have been working all year without a contract. Last month, they 
began staging one-day sickouts to protest what they say is the board's refusal 
to bargain in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
Compton's acting school superintendent, Elisa L. Sanchez, said the CTA 
resolution is unfair: "It's not positive news for us, particularly at a time 
when we are going through some very difficult collective-bargaining issues. 
It's going to make it harder for use to settle." 
</P>
<P>
CTA wants its censure resolution -- the first by the union in at least 15 
years, Foglia said -- to spur Honig, state legislators and federal 
representatives into starting a drive to upgrade the Compton schools. The 
resolution is being circulated to all 232,000 CTA members and to various 
elected officials in an effort to enlist their support, Foglia said. "We want 
the educational community to help change this." 
</P>
<P>
The Compton Education Assn., as well as a group of teachers at the district's 
Dominguez High School, have also petitioned Honig complaining about low 
salaries and poor working conditions. Honig's office has sent a letter to 
Sanchez saying it expects her to respond to the teacher complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez said she and other district staff members met two weeks ago with Honig 
staff members to discuss Compton's problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a very close working relationship with the state superintendent's 
staff," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The district is preparing a response to Honig on the complaints, Sanchez said, 
with the response expected to be ready the second week of May. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers have accused the district of deliberately keeping salaries low to 
force the most experienced teachers to leave Compton for higher-paying jobs in 
other districts. Last year, more than 150 teachers left the district, and union 
officials say the same thing will happen again this year if the district does 
not raise pay scales. 
</P>
<P>
The departing teachers, the union says, are being replaced with long-term 
substitutes or teachers who do not yet have their credentials. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, district representatives met with teacher leaders for the first 
time in about four months but did not alter the district's salary offer of 6% 
for each of three years, said Wiley Jones, executive director of the Compton 
Education Assn. There is another meeting on Friday, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, 39 of the 86 teachers at Compton High School stayed home for the 
day, the second time in a month that a large number of teachers have called in 
sick at the school. Similar actions have occurred at other Compton schools in 
recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The union wants a comprehensive salary readjustment under which teachers at the 
top pay scale -- those with 14 years experience -- would earn double what 
beginning teachers are paid. That would raise the most experienced teacher's 
annual salary from around $37,000 to $45,000. The average salary for teachers 
with comparable experience is $44,569 in the top 10 paid districts in Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, a state fact-finding report discounted the district's claim that it 
cannot afford to give teachers more than 6% salary increases. The fact-finder 
agreed that Compton teachers are among the lowest paid in the county, and that 
the low salaries are driving teachers out of the district in search of higher 
pay and better working conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Before the school board meeting Tuesday night, parents and classified employed 
employees -- janitors, clerks, bus drivers and cafeteria workers -- picketed 
the school district headquarters on Tamarind Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The parents group has been calling for reforms in the schools. The classified 
employees, like the teachers, have not yet settled on a work contract.

AROUND THE FOOTHILLS: 'A SHOW ON ANYTHING BUT THE ALEX WOULD BE 
SELF-DEFEATING.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The future of Glendale's Alex Theatre has been studied, debated, wrestled with 
and voted upon for the past four years, all with little visible effect. 
</P>
<P>
At last, the problem of the Alex is bending to the sort of energy that was 
needed all along, the energy of artists, moved by dreams and gifted with 
serendipity. 
</P>
<P>
Under their influence, the 1925 vaudeville house and cinema with its neo-Greek 
columned entry and the 1940s obelisk is having its future shaped by the rebirth 
of its past. 
</P>
<P>
"Alexander Then and Now," a fantasy journey through the 6 1/2 decades of the 
Alex, will play two nights in September, returning live performance to the Alex 
stage after a hiatus of decades. 
</P>
<P>
The event will take the form of a hybrid Broadway musical, with singing, 
dancing, storytelling, photographic montages, a cast of hundreds and two 
essentials of a winning show -- a hero drawn from real life and a celebrity 
whose name is bigger than life. 
</P>
<P>
The hero is Bob Caskey, who hired on at the Alexander in 1927, before its name 
was shortened, and still works there today in the box office. He's seen 
everything, from the secret entrances of movie stars to raffle nights in the 
Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
The celebrity is Bob Hope. He's been a patron of the Alex and has lent his name 
to the effort to save it. 
</P>
<P>
Both came to the show by serendipity. But what aspect of "Alexander Then and 
Now" hasn't simply fallen into place as if by a will of its own? 
</P>
<P>
The good fortune began almost a year ago, when a committee of the Glendale 
Historical Society found itself struggling to will a show into existence. The 
Historical Society had concluded, after two years of debate, that the Alex, 
soon to be closed by Mann Theatres, should be restored as a house for film and 
stage, to become the central cultural element of a revitalized downtown. They 
reasoned that a live show would be the best way to consummate the plan and 
begin to raise funds. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the society, made up largely of borderline curmudgeons with an 
admirable record of grit in fighting City Hall and a competent, if leaden, way 
with historical fact, was hardly the kind of group likely to make a dancing 
chorus appear. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Paul Shipton, a New York transplant, veteran stage dancer, Hollywood 
choreographer, classical dance instructor and creator of extravaganzas. Shipton 
moved to Glendale four years ago and was beginning to wonder where the art 
scene was. 
</P>
<P>
One day, Shipton called on Shirley Seeley, executive director of the Glendale 
Symphony. She referred him to the Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
Shipton concluded that what it needed was someone who could write, cast, direct 
and choreograph a show. He said he was available if they didn't already have 
someone in mind. They didn't. 
</P>
<P>
It was soon decided that there would be two shows, one for the public at $15 a 
ticket and another by invitation with a considerably higher price tag. Shipton 
quickly settled on two things. The show should be a musical and it should tell 
the story of the Alex. 
</P>
<P>
The history itself captured Shipton's imagination. There were the vaudeville 
shows, the Hollywood events -- premieres with stars such as Elizabeth Taylor in 
the audience -- the raffle nights of the Great Depression, the bond rally of 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"We realized that doing a show on anything but the history of the Alex would be 
self-defeating," he said, "The one thing the musical is going to do is alert 
the citizens of Glendale what they have in the Alex." 
</P>
<P>
Before Shipton knew there was a real Bob Caskey, he began to think of building 
the story around a central character who would narrate. The idea was to invent 
a janitor or usher. 
</P>
<P>
"We were going to do a very artificial character," Shipton said. "Then Bob 
showed up. It was like a gift from heaven." 
</P>
<P>
Caskey became Shipton's "Icon of Glendale." He filled in the lore of the Alex 
with details about Louis B. Mayer sitting in his private loge to supervise 
premieres; about Bing Crosby waiting in the lobby in terror wondering how an 
audience would take to a crooner playing a priest in "Going My Way;" about 
Ginger Rogers sneaking in to see her own premieres. 
</P>
<P>
Caskey's role will be played by Russ Marin, a professional actor who is 
volunteering his time. Shipton is now auditioning to fill the myriad cameo 
appearances of the Clara Bows and Bessie Loves and to recreate, en masse, the 
dance shows of Fanchon and Marco. 
</P>
<P>
But, through a final gem of good fortune, one role did not have to be cast. It 
happened this way: Shipton recruited his friend, Ralph Ziegler, the financial 
manager of Triad Artists, the talent agency that represents Bob Hope. Ziegler 
had never asked Hope for a favor before, but thought, because of the personal 
tie, it might be a good time. 
</P>
<P>
He floated the idea to Hope's agent, Frank Rio. There were negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally, he said, 'Yes, let's go ahead,' " Ziegler said. Hope will mingle with 
the crowd before the gala performance and, as he did in the old days, sit down 
to watch the show.

ACTING MANAGER WEATHERS CONFLICTS, GETS 2-YEAR PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cudahy City Council has unanimously voted to hire acting City Manager Jack 
Joseph as city manager. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph, 41, who had served as acting city manager since September, was also 
hired as city clerk at last Friday's special meeting. 
</P>
<P>
In Cudahy, the city manager traditionally holds the clerk's job as well. 
</P>
<P>
As acting city manager, Joseph often was caught in the middle of struggles 
among the old council, which was sharply divided by persistent personal and 
political conflicts. Those battles came to a head shortly before the April 10 
election when Councilman John Robertson and defeated Councilman Wilfred Colon, 
together with several unsuccessful candidates, signed a complaint which was 
mailed to the district attorney's office and the state Fair Political Practices 
Commission, alleging that Joseph was involved in illegal election activities 
ranging from misusing his office to run the successful reelection campaign of 
Mayor Joseph Graffio to tampering with absentee ballots. Joseph has denied the 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph was awarded a two-year contract for $69,300 the first year. The second 
year will be negotiated in 1991.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Newspaper, cans and bottles can be dropped off at nine new recycling sites in 
Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
The sites, set up by the city, will take glass bottles and jars, aluminum and 
tin cans, plastic bottles, and newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
The materials do not have to be separated. The drop-off spots are part of a 
recycling plan that the city is developing in an effort to reduce by 25% its 
waste going to landfills. 
</P>
<P>
Recycling locations are: City Hall, Duquesne Avenue and Culver Boulevard; 
National Guard Armory, 10808 Culver Blvd.; Tellefson Park, Washington Place and 
Tilden Avenue; Culver West Park, 4162 Wade Ave.; Culver-Palms Methodist Church,

LOAN FOR MOBILE HOME PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Culver City Redevelopment Agency approved lending residents of Baldwin 
Hills Mobilehome Park at least $766,000 to buy the park property. 
</P>
<P>
The 118 tenants, most of whom are of low or moderate income, are planning to 
buy the property for about $3.5 million from the owner, Vorelco Inc. Each of 
the households are to buy a $30,000 share in the park. 
</P>
<P>
The agency money would be used to give eligible households 30-year loans 
ranging from $4,000 to $14,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
Buying the park at 11250 Playa St. would help Culver City meets its goals to 
preserve low- and moderate-income housing, city Housing Manager Phyllis 
Baboolal said. Residents who want to later sell their shares will be required 
to sell to households of the same or lower income status, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Redevelopment Agency will also arrange a loan to residents to pay for a 
study of the condition of park utilities, some of which are 40 years old. 
</P>
<P>
The loan is contingent on the residents' obtaining $870,000 in state loans, 
Baboolal said, but she added that she did not foresee any obstacles to 
residents' application for the state funding.

<P>
SPRINKLER UPGRADE ORDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three high-rise residences for low-income senior citizens that have been 
exempted from city fire-sprinkler laws for nine years would lose their 
exemptions, under a proposal given tentative approval Tuesday by the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
In voting to draft an ordinance lifting the exemptions, however, the council 
directed the city staff to look to install the sprinklers without increasing 
the residents' rents. 
</P>
<P>
The council ordered the staff to investigate every possible funding source -- 
including the city. The proposal, which would give building operators two years 
to install the sprinklers, will come back to the council for a vote within 45 
days. 
</P>
<P>
The buildings, Westminister Towers at 1112 7th St., Santa Monica Towers at 1233 
6th St. and Geneva Plaza at 1441 21st St., were exempted from sprinkler 
requirements in 1981 because the council believed installation of sprinklers 
would cause rents to rise too high. The city's rent control law allows such 
costs to be passed on to tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the city staff says the buildings' landlords would need a 
combined total of $157,000 in outside financing to avoid raising rents. The 
total costs of installing the sprinklers will be $1.2 million, according to 
city staff. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison Betts, president of Westminister and Geneva Towers, criticized the 
council proposal, saying the reserve funds accumulated by the buildings in 
recent years should go to sorely needed improvements, such as elevator and roof 
replacement at Westminister Towers. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy West, the city's housing program director, disagreed: "We believe it's a 
life-safety issue more than a finance issue."

PUBLISHER OF CONTROVERSIAL BOOKS GRANTS FULL REFUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The furor over a controversial series of elementary school textbooks appears to 
have ended for the East Whittier City School District. Holt, Rinehart and 
Winston has paid $172,694.42 to the district as a refund for the company's 
Impressions series. 
</P>
<P>
The texts, designed for students in kindergarten through sixth grade, caused an 
uproar among some parents because they believed the books were too graphic and 
depicted anti-social or anti-religious values. 
</P>
<P>
"When parents have input, you should listen to it," Supt. Dorothy Fagan said, 
"but the basis for returning the books is that we didn't get what we ordered." 
She said the texts were significantly different from those the district had 
previewed and ordered last spring. 
</P>
<P>
"Until they were used, nobody found out," she said. Fagan praised the 
publishing company for agreeing to a full refund. 
</P>
<P>
Schools in the district recently submitted their preferences for replacement 
texts, although the results have not yet been tabulated. In the interim, 
instructors have taught from a variety of readers and collections of literature 
for children.

EMPLOYEE TO BE ARRAIGNED IN CITY HALL BURGLARY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arraignment is scheduled May 23 for Melvin C. Smith, Compton labor relations 
officer, who is accused of helping arrange the New Year's weekend theft of more 
than $100,000 worth of equipment from the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 35, was charged last week with two counts of possession of stolen 
property after a search by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies turned up some 
of the stolen equipment in his Paramount apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was arrested Monday. Arraignment will be in Compton Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Among the items stolen were personal computers, telephones, dictating machines, 
cameras and a fax machine. The search warrant affidavit alleges that Smith 
arranged to have City Hall doors unlocked for the burglars and then helped them 
transport and store the stolen goods. 
</P>
<P>
An eight-year city employee, Smith was put on administrative leave last week 
after the Sheriff's Department relayed its findings to City Manager Howard 
Caldwell. The city manager has declined to comment on the case. Police and City 
Hall sources say that at least one other city employee has been questioned 
about the burglary.

ARTIST FINANCES 'REAL' WORK BY PAINTING TIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carol Kredenser Goldmark earned a master's degree in art from Columbia 
University, so you might wonder why she spends so much of her time painting 
neckties. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm waiting to be discovered," is her simple answer. "I'm what's called an 
emerging artist," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But behind those statements is the automobile accident that nearly claimed her 
life four years ago. It "made me focus, made me realize what was most important 
to me. Besides my family, it was art," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Goldmark said, "the accident made me understand . . . that my art was 
a life-and-death issue that I didn't realize until I came home from the 
hospital and saw it on the easel. In a way, the accident was a blessing." 
</P>
<P>
Goldmark, 47, a sporadic artist for 30 years, also discovered that "time is 
passing quickly. Art was always important," she said, "but I tended to put it 
aside to take care of other things." 
</P>
<P>
So two years ago, the mother of two sons and wife of Rabbi Larry Goldmark of 
Temple Beth Ohr in La Mirada moved from her cramped art workroom in their Buena 
Park home to a rented art studio snuggled between a couple of car repair shops 
in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
She set out to make a name for herself in the art world and began painting 
eight hours a day, five days a week. She says her paintings illustrate "forms 
from the natural world," which include clouds, flowers and plants. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to show that the cycle of life is fleeting," said Goldmark, 
daughter of noted Boston artist Nathan Kredenser. 
</P>
<P>
But, as it is with many "struggling" artists, the rent on the art studio had to 
be paid. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed to make money, and after teaching art for 30 years, I didn't want to 
go back to that, so I started to sell my painted ties," said Goldmark, who uses 
live flowers as models for the floral ties, which are for men or women. 
</P>
<P>
The tie business surfaced accidentally. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago I needed something fabulous to wear at an important art show, so 
I painted flowers on one of my husband's solid-color silk ties and wore it," 
she recalled. It was an immediate hit. 
</P>
<P>
"That night, several people asked where I got the tie, and when I told them, 
they wanted to know how they could buy one," she said. "It started to take off 
fast." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, her ties were featured at a special showing at Nordstrom in South 
Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa. The store bought three dozen of them. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like the ties to be successful, but I don't want them to be so successful 
that it stands in the way of my real goal," Goldmark said. That goal is 
recognition from a major fine arts gallery and, most of all, to be exhibited. 
</P>
<P>
But until then, Goldmark will push ahead with her hand-painted silk ties made 
with acrylics and fabric paint. 
</P>
<P>
"The ties are natural extensions of my other work on canvas and paper," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She also plans to market other accessories, such as painted evening bags, hats, 
shoes, blouses and jackets. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the growing demand for her novel work on cloth, "I wouldn't like it to 
get too big," she said. "I have other goals that are more important to me."

WHITTIER, UCLA COMMUNITIES SHATTERED BY STUDENT'S DEATH IN MOTORCYCLE CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HAROLD BLUME, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chris Zambrano was the kid no one ever worried about. Life seemed to come 
easily for this popular, intelligent and motivated UCLA sophomore. The 
computer-science engineering major always seemed to know just where he was 
going. 
</P>
<P>
Then Zambrano, 20, crashed while riding a motorcycle in the Sepulveda Pass 
during the dark hours before dawn on April 12. The accident left him 
brain-dead. Four days after the accident, life-support machines were turned off 
at UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Zambrano's passing has wounded the communities in Whittier, where Zambrano was 
from, and at the university to a degree that belies the frequency with which 
such tragedies occur. 
</P>
<P>
Eight hundred people crammed into the St. Louis of France Church in La Puente 
for the Rosary. Another 600 put aside work and school obligations to attend the 
funeral. 
</P>
<P>
"You expect him to walk through the door," said Ted Allen, a roommate. "There's 
an emptiness every time I look at his picture and see him smiling." 
</P>
<P>
"That was his trademark," said Margaret Alexander, a family friend. "At the 
hospital I kept hoping I'd see his smile again." Twenty-four hours into the 
family's four-day bedside vigil, Zambrano's brain activity ceased. 
</P>
<P>
"For 20 years, he's been known for his head, his intelligence," said Natalie 
Zambrano, Chris' mother, who buried her son days after her 29th wedding 
anniversary. "It was hard to accept his death due to that type of injury." 
</P>
<P>
Former teachers feel much the same way. Zambrano "could communicate more with 
less words than any student I ever taught," said Bob Braden, a Pioneer High 
School teacher who has taught for 41 years. 
</P>
<P>
Zambrano graduated fifth in a class of 354 at Pioneer High School in 1988 -- 
with a shelf full of awards and certificates -- after completing "our most 
challenging curriculum," said Larry Kampa, a counselor at the school. "He 
rarely came in for counseling. He knew where he was going." 
</P>
<P>
So much so that the sports enthusiast left the junior varsity baseball team 
after his sophomore year, even though he was entranced by anything to do with 
baseball. He wanted more time to study. 
</P>
<P>
Zambrano boxed his baseball cards neatly, ordered chronologically and 
alphabetically, and stacked them in a cabinet at his parents' North Whittier 
home. His newer files, just as meticulously organized, are labeled with 
headings such as "Hughes," the company that offered him a summer job in 
computer engineering the week he died. Zambrano never saw the letter. 
</P>
<P>
"If I could pick 100 people I know that this could happen to," said Alex 
Martinez, another roommate, "Chris wouldn't be on my list." 
</P>
<P>
Zambrano borrowed Martinez's Honda Interceptor at 2 a.m. that Thursday morning. 
The two had been party-hopping on UCLA's fraternity row. Zambrano had been 
drinking that night, but not for some time before the accident, his friends 
say. 
</P>
<P>
The warm evening's ride seemed a perfect way to cool down from two hours of 
dancing. Zambrano planned to return for Martinez within half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"Chris told me that he wanted to buy a motorcycle, and I forbade it," Natalie 
Zambrano said. "I said, 'Never.' But over the years he always chose what he 
wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
Zambrano apparently could handle the independence. "There's nothing that I know 
of that he tried to do, that he didn't do," Martinez said. "He'd do twice as 
much as me in half the time. He would do everything and get away with it. He 
would say, 'I just took that bull by the horns and wrestled him to the ground.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
"When you're young," Allen said, "you don't really feel like you're going to 
die." 
</P>
<P>
So no one challenged Zambrano over not wearing a helmet. No one thought to 
worry over an exhausted Zambrano riding out alone after a party on a dark 
mountain road. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 10 minutes from campus, Zambrano, traveling north through Sepulveda 
Pass, began climbing a hill on an unlit stretch of Sepulveda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The road curved darkly to the left, but Zambrano failed to make the turn. His 
bike crashed through the metal fence at a 45-degree angle. The impact bent back 
three metal supports and ripped through the chain mesh, about two-tenths of a 
mile below North Bel Air Crest Road. 
</P>
<P>
Zambrano, who suffered severe head injuries, lay undiscovered in the dark for 
two hours. The first eight minutes are critical to a patient with Chris' 
injuries, the neurosurgeon would later tell Natalie Zambrano. 
</P>
<P>
Early the next morning, Zambrano's worried roommates called UCLA Medical 
Center. No, a Zambrano had not checked in. But yes, there was a John Doe from a 
motorcycle accident, and yes, he had red hair. 
</P>
<P>
If Zambrano had not hurt his head, or perhaps if he had worn a helmet, he would 
be recovering now from nothing more than a broken leg. 
</P>
<P>
At least 40 people other than his immediate family waited at the hospital for 
word on Zambrano's condition. Hundreds would later mourn with family and 
friends. It was a reunion of sorts for those Zambrano had touched. 
</P>
<P>
At the burial site, after most had dispersed, one group of comrades became 
animated, exhilarated at being together, almost as if Zambrano were still among 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"C'mon you guys," one said soberly, "this isn't high school graduation; this is 
a funeral." 
</P>
<P>
They walked across the grass to their cars with their heads down.

ANTI-ALCOHOL ACTIVIST BATTLES PTA IN BEVERLY HILLS OVER WINE AUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA KOH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The scene: the Cinco de Mayo Fiesta Carnival at El Rodeo School in Beverly 
Hills. The crime: illegal liquor sales. 
</P>
<P>
At least that's how Trisha Roth sees it. 
</P>
<P>
Roth may have lost the Beverly Hill City Council election earlier this month, 
but she hasn't given up her fight against alcohol. The latest target of her 
crusade is the annual PTA carnival last Sunday, where bottles of vintage Mouton 
Rothschild were sold at a silent auction. 
</P>
<P>
The six bottles of 1978 and 1980 vintage Bordeaux were prominently displayed at 
the carnival, amounting to a "glorification of alcohol," said Roth, whose war 
on alcohol and drug abuse was a prominent part of her council campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The auction, said Roth, contradicted the message "in the classroom . . . that 
alcohol is a drug, and we know (it's dangerous) from a health perspective and a 
safety perspective." Adults, Roth said, should be consistent role models for 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
She has asked the Beverly Hills city attorney to investigate the wine sales, 
noting that there were no signs at the auction warning of the dangerous effects 
of alcohol on pregnant women and fetuses, as required by Proposition 65. 
</P>
<P>
At the carnival, Roth, who has two children at El Rodeo and is the school PTA's 
recording secretary, made her feelings known to organizers and school 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Although most had no problem with her message, some were dismayed by her 
methods and timing. 
</P>
<P>
"I listened to her . . . but I was not about to intervene and start changing 
the whole auction around," PTA President Patti Tanenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us oppose consumption of alcohol by minors and would do nothing to 
promote it," said Tanenbaum, whose husband, Robert, was one of the two 
incumbents to defeat Roth in the council election. 
</P>
<P>
Roth "embarrassed some of the ladies . . . who worked so hard" on the 
fund-raiser, Tanenbaum added. "It's too bad she pointed fingers like this." 
</P>
<P>
Tanenbaum said Roth should have instead complained to the PTA before or after 
the event, noting that a list of auction items was sent to every parent a few 
weeks beforehand. "To have, at the eleventh hour, come up with this, in this 
kind of way, was so upsetting." 
</P>
<P>
But Roth said: "I'm not going to sit around and sit on it. I was very direct, 
right away." 
</P>
<P>
And to criticism of her actions, Roth replies: "Are we looking at the wrong 
person? I wasn't the one who broke the law." 
</P>
<P>
All this is familiar territory for Roth. She complained about the district's 
adult school offering a wine-tasting class, and the district canceled it. She 
has called for investigations of restaurants and even her own Temple Emanuel 
for failing to post Proposition 65 warnings. She has argued with the American 
Cancer Society about allowing a wine-tasting fund-raiser to be held on its 
behalf. "This comes up with every nonprofit organization in the country -- 
everyone wants to make money, and everyone knows you make more money if you 
sell alcohol than if you don't sell alcohol," she said. 
</P>
<P>
At the school carnival, five Mouton Rothschild splits fetched $25 each, and a 
regular-sized bottle went for $75, said auction organizer Lillian Raffel. The 
bidding netted about $11,000 from about 200 items, including membership to the 
Beverly Hills Country Club, Madonna and Janet Jackson concert tickets, and a 
gift certificate for a cake to feed 250 people.

The Indianapolis Colts selected two former Glendale-area players in the NFL 
draft this week. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford defensive back Alan Grant, who played at St. Francis High, and USC 
offensive lineman Bill Schultz, a former junior college All-American at 
Glendale College, were taken in the fourth round by Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
CS Fullerton running back Michael Pringle, who attended but never played at 
Glendale, was taken by Atlanta in the sixth round. 
</P>
<P>
Special competition: More than 350 athletes from the San Gabriel Valley will 
participate in a Special Olympics regional qualifying meet Saturday at 
Occidental. The competition will include track and field, swimming, soccer, 
basketball, weightlifting and gymnastics. Participants can advance to the state 
meet at UCLA this summer. 
</P>
<P>
On the road: Driver David Kudrave of La Canada finished 10th in the 100-mile 
American Racing Series event at Long Beach on Sunday, winning $1,400. 
</P>
<P>
Kudrave, 24, was competing in the first of 14 ARS events, which are contested 
in Wildcat V-6 Buicks with 450-horsepower engines.

NEW SITES STUDIED FOR ECHO PARK LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Library Commissioners last week broadened its search 
for a site for a new Echo Park Branch Library by adding two locations near 
Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The library commission Thursday asked its staff to report in 60 days on whether 
a library could be built on property north of Sunset near Lemoyne Street -- 
proposed by community members at a January hearing -- without displacing the 
tenants of an adjoining apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also requested a report on the possibility of acquiring a parcel 
owned by the Los Angeles Unified School District near Montana and Logan streets 
near Logan Street School. The district at one time had intended to build a 
day-care center there. 
</P>
<P>
A third site, at Temple and Douglas streets, appeared to become a less-likely 
choice because its owner opened escrow to sell it for private development, 
library officials said. The commission asked the staff to continue 
investigating purchase of that land, either through negotiation or eminent 
domain. 
</P>
<P>
The staff recommended selection of the Temple Street site in January, but 
commissioners postponed a decision after members of the Friends of the Echo 
Park Library and several Echo Park residents protested that it is outside the 
community, cut off by the Hollywood Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the Temple Street site initially hoped to have the branch library 
built in the former fire station on Edgeware Road just north of the Hollywood 
Freeway. However, the commission turned down the request because of concern 
over the cost of renovating the historic building and the Fire Department's 
insistence that it planned to keep the building for administrative use.

CLUB CELEBRATES 52 YEARS OF FILLING A TALL ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Usually members of the California Tip Toppers favor T-shirts with such slogans 
as "No, I don't play basketball. Do you play miniature golf?" 
</P>
<P>
But Friday night, the members of the world's first tall club will put on their 
extra-long tuxedos and spike heels to celebrate the 52nd anniversary of their 
founding by a 6-foot-3 woman who worked at Disney Studios, helping to animate 
"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." 
</P>
<P>
As Bob De Lyser, the club's president, explains, California Tip Toppers was 
founded in 1938 by artist Kae Sumner, who that same year wrote an article for 
the Los Angeles Times magazine about the tribulations of being tall and female. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you suppose I very often have the pleasure of dancing with a man cheek to 
cheek?" Sumner asked. "Oh, no! It's chin to cheek. My chin. . . his cheek." 
</P>
<P>
Sumner invited others similarly menaced by low-slung chandeliers and the 
umbrellas of the average-sized to contact her. "We could form a longfellows' 
club," she suggested. On May, 1, 1938, she and eight other people who were sick 
of being called "Shorty" did just that. 
</P>
<P>
Today there are more than 50 tall clubs in the United States and Canada, De 
Lyser says, and similar organizations in Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, 
Sweden and elsewhere abroad. The clubs have a toll-free number -- (800) 
521-2512 -- that allows tall travelers to locate the nearest group or to start 
a club of their own. 
</P>
<P>
California Tip Toppers is not only the oldest of the clubs (it has several 
second-generation members), it differs from most, including those in the San 
Fernando Valley and Orange County, in restricting membership to women 6-feet 
and over and men 6-foot-4 or taller. 
</P>
<P>
"All the other clubs throughout the United States are two inches shorter," says 
Andrea Tabor, 42, a 6-footer who lives in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Goldman says she initially resisted joining the group because "it seemed 
freakish" (she's now social chairman). 
</P>
<P>
"My mother has been telling me for years to join the tall club, but who listens 
to mothers?" says Goldman, a teacher who lives in West Los Angeles. Goldman, 
40, remembers her first Tip Toppers event a year and a half ago. "I'm used to 
standing out in a room," she says. "But I tell you, I felt short. I kept 
looking around for the hole I was standing in." 
</P>
<P>
According to Goldman, one of the pleasures of membership is a chance to feel 
almost dainty -- not easy to come by when you wear a size 10 or 11 shoe. 
</P>
<P>
"Around these men, I can feel petite, I can feel feminine, I can feel fragile," 
she says. "Usually we're almost treated like men." Once, a fellow Tip Topper 
casually swept her off her feet. "I'm 6-feet and over 180 pounds, and I haven't 
been lifted off the ground since I was a little girl," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Like other women members, Goldman says the club has given her a new 
appreciation of her height. "A tall woman can't get away with being cute or 
like a little doll," she says, "but we can be sexy and sultry, and we can be 
glamorous." 
</P>
<P>
De Lyser, who met his wife, Jan Scheuermann, through the club, agrees. "Tall 
women can be very impressive," says De Lyser, 37, a Lancaster man more than 
6-foot-7 whose T-shirt collection includes one that declares: "I may be the 
first to be rained on, but I'll be the last to drown." 
</P>
<P>
Goldman says the club has been much more than a place to meet guys taller than 
she is. "It's an extended family," she says. "I feel like I've been adopted. 
These are people who understand what you've gone through your whole life. 
They've shared the same embarrassments." 
</P>
<P>
Goldman boycotted Green Giant food as a teen-ager, she was so stung by 
comparisons to its Jolly Green trademark. And like other tall children, she 
felt especially prominent and exposed when her shorter peers called her names 
or queried her, as they inevitably did, about the weather up there. 
</P>
<P>
Life is easier for tall adults, whose height is often admired, but not perfect. 
</P>
<P>
"The world's just built for shorter people," says De Lyser. The club takes an 
activist approach to society's indifference to the special needs of the tall. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not above writing to car companies and saying we need more head room," 
says Goldman. Among the changes the tall lobby claims to have wrought: the 
development of the extra-long California king-size mattress. 
</P>
<P>
The group also raises money for the National Marfan Foundation, which helps 
those with Marfan syndrome, a potentially fatal condition that afflicts the 
tall. 
</P>
<P>
The Tip Toppers routinely meet with members of the two other local clubs for 
parties, game nights, outdoor activities and special events like Friday's 
masked ball. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman said the dance will be held at 9:30 p.m. at the Officers Club on the 
U.S. Naval Station at Long Beach. Those interested in attending should call 
(213) 670-5770 for information and reservations. 
</P>
<P>
Tall people are especially welcome, Goldman says, "but we're not going to turn 
short people away."

MARINA SHERIFF'S STATION CHIEF NAMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has appointed Clarence R. Chapman, 
a 24-year veteran of the department, as captain of the Marina del Rey station. 
</P>
<P>
As captain of the Marina station, which covers the marina area and the 
communities of View Park, Windsor Hills and Ladera Heights, Chapman will be in 
charge of 72 deputies, including 15 deputies working the harbor boat patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman, 43, who has been meeting with community groups since his appointment, 
described the area as diverse. 
</P>
<P>
"It has the marina, which is a high-density area with condominiums and concerns 
about traffic and development, and the residential communities of View Park, 
Ladera Heights and Windsor Hills, where the concerns are more about safe 
streets and safe schools," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman has held several positions since joining the Sheriff's Department in 
1966. As a sergeant, he was a manager of a program that tracked career 
criminals. More recently, he served as a lieutenant in the narcotic bureau in 
Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
"We targeted underground drug smuggling and distribution operations involving 
rock cocaine, primarily in the mid-city," he said. "This (new assignment) is 
much less job-specific and very much less stressful. The drug problem is very 
frustrating because no matter how much effort we put in, it seems to escalate." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Columbus, Ohio, he moved to Los Angeles in 1960.

THRIVING IN OBSCURITY; 
</P>
<P>
ALTHOUGH FAR OUTSIDE MAINSTREAM OF AMERICAN SPORTS, BADMINTON STILL FLOURISHES 
AT CLUB, HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As obscure as the international sport it serves, the ivy-shrouded Manhattan 
Beach Badminton Club rises on a hill overlooking the downtown shoreline. Most 
of this bustling community's residents don't know it exists. 
</P>
<P>
The 250 club members like it that way. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not even listed in the Yellow Pages," club president Stan Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
But internationally, "everyone in the world knows about this little outpost," 
said Joy Kitzmiller, a two-time national singles champion and the gold medalist 
at last year's Olympic Festival. "We've put Manhattan Beach on the badminton 
map." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years the Manhattan Beach facility, which sports a swimming pool, hot 
tub, two barbecue cabanas and a meeting hall, has evolved into more of a social 
club, yet it serves as a training ground for selected U.S. National Team 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Some club members lament that the seclusion they cherish helps isolate the 
sport from mainstream America. To most Americans, badminton is synonymous with 
back-yard barbecues and Fourth of July picnics. 
</P>
<P>
That is not the case internationally. In England, for example, there are 
200,000 registered badminton players. In the United States there are only 
2,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Participation in the world is in the millions," said Dean Schoppe, a U.S. 
National Team member and a member of the Manhattan Beach club. 
</P>
<P>
There are only two indoor facilities in the West, Manhattan Beach and at 
Arizona State University, although the sport flourishes in the high schools of 
Orange County and in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The CIF Moore League -- composed of Poly, Millikan, Lakewood, Wilson, Jordan 
and Compton high schools -- plays a coed schedule. Jordan is the defending 
Southern Section champion. 
</P>
<P>
Dues in the Manhattan Beach club are cheap, but there is a two-year waiting 
period to become a member. Each year every member is required to put in 16 
hours of volunteer work to help maintain the club. 
</P>
<P>
Guest numbers are limited and they must pay to play on one of the club's five 
courts. Kitzmiller said that limiting guests makes it difficult for her to 
train, because there are no female players of her caliber in the club. 
</P>
<P>
Badminton is a strenuous sport, club members say. To elite players, badminton 
requires six to eight hours of daily practice. Schoppe estimates that in an 
average match, which is scored much the same as volleyball, a player runs the 
equivalent of 9 to 12 miles of wind sprints and hits between 600 and 2,000 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
Even those who enjoy the club's social atmosphere cite the benefits of 
badminton on their cardiovascular systems. "We gather and play badminton for 
several hours (on Friday nights) and then go into the (meeting hall) and drink 
wine and eat hors d'oeuvres," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Internationally, it is estimated that badminton is second only to soccer in the 
number of participants. In Asia, title matches often draw standing-room-only 
crowds of 20,000 to arenas designed specifically for the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"When I play in Asia, I go out for a jog on a Saturday morning, and in any 
town, on every piece of flat land, there are people playing it," Schoppe said. 
</P>
<P>
"The potential in this country for this sport is huge," said Martin French, 
president of the U.S. Badminton Assn. and a club member. "But as far as this 
sport getting recognition (from the general public) we are eons away." 
</P>
<P>
According to Wilson High Coach Dan Heston, the high school game is dominated by 
foreign students. "Nine out of 10 players are Asians," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The game is also popular in the Middle East, as well as in England and its 
former colonies. Tariq Wadood, a top pro player from Pakistan, is the U.S. 
National Team coach. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in a roadside bathhouse in 1936, the secluded badminton club in 
Manhattan Beach is in a residential neighborhood at 18th Street and Valley 
Drive. The facilities are considered to be among "the best in the world," 
according to Wadood. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the courts are rather stark. There are five side-by-side inside a cavernous 
gymnasium. Each serves for both singles or doubles, much like a tennis court, 
but the dimensions are about half the size. Nets are tautly drawn five feet 
above the playing surface. 
</P>
<P>
Six fluorescent lights hang down on long cords from the ceiling, providing what 
Schoppe said is the perfect amount of indirect light needed to see a 
shuttlecock that can travel at speeds of up to 100 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The walls and ceilings are painted a drab green. The playing floor is designed 
specifically for the stress a badminton player receives on his knees and 
joints. It is composed of soft wood, painted with a gum-tar surface. 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't play basketball on it because the wood would crack under the 
pressure of a bouncing ball," Schoppe explained. 
</P>
<P>
While members like their privacy, some would like to see badminton take off in 
this country. Said Wadood, the club pro: "In the United States it gets no media 
attention. Little kids (in my country) see it on TV and they make idols. Here, 
they don't see it so the image is bad." 
</P>
<P>
However, the facility is lacking in some of the things it would take to 
publicize the sport. "It's God awful when we do television in here," Schoppe 
said of the lighting. 
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. Open has been held there three times, there isn't space for 
bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
"For training this is the best facility," Wadood said. "But for tournaments we 
can't seat enough people." 
</P>
<P>
At major events, according to Johnson, "When we get down to the finals we bring 
in some portable bleachers and set them up on the other courts. That's not the 
best way to do it." 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, the club's board of directors was rebuked by the Manhattan Beach City 
Council when it asked for a permit to expand. Nearby residents feared increased 
noise and parking problems if the additions of two more courts and a viewing 
loft were allowed. Later, the city acted on residential complaints and limited 
it from issuing more than 250 memberships. 
</P>
<P>
The club's atmosphere is different from that at a tennis club, according to 
members who turned out on a recent Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"A tennis club has a parking lot filled with Mercedes-Benzes and other yuppie 
cars. That isn't the case here," Johnson said. "Here, most people don't even 
know what vocation you are in. It's a different culture, a family 
organization." 
</P>
<P>
But their interest in such an obscure and misunderstood sport often leads to 
ridicule. Johnson remembers the ribbing he took from fellow insurance agents 
when they heard he had joined the club eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to know if I was going to try out for the wimp Olympics," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He then invited a couple of them to play a game or two at the club. 
</P>
<P>
"I watched them die on the court," he said.

POWERFUL BRUIN MEN'S AND WOMEN'S TRACK TEAMS TO CHALLENGE USC SPEEDSTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The UCLA men's and women's track teams, each sporting long unbeaten streaks in 
dual meets, will face USC in a double-dual meet on Saturday at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Men's and women's field events will start at 11 a.m., the first men's run at 1 
p.m. and the first women's race at 1:15. The hammer throw will begin at 10 a.m. 
at West Los Angeles College. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojan men lead the series, 38-18, but the Bruins, whose dual-meet record 
in the last five-plus years is 45-0-1, have won the last 11 meets. The UCLA 
women, 18-0 in a span of more than three seasons, have beaten USC in four of 
six meets, including the last two. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the Bruin men, missing a raft of key performers because of injuries, 
were led at the Mount San Antonio College Relays by senior John Knight, senior 
Pete Thompson and junior Jay Borick. Knight finished third in the invitational 
hammer with a career-best 214 feet, 5 inches. In open events, Thompson was 
second in the discus at 182-3 and Borick was third in the pole vault at 16-10 
3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Lewis, who won gold medals at the 1988 Olympics in the 400-meter run and 
in the 1,600 relay, is one of several injured Bruins. He has been out the last 
four weeks with a recurrence of a hamstring injury that kept him out of last 
year's NCAA outdoor championships. He may return in a couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruin women are led by junior Tracie Millett, who won the NCAA indoor 
shot-put championship in March with a toss of 51-11, and sophomore Janeene 
Vickers, winner of the 1989 NCAA outdoor title in the 400-meter hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica College men's and women's track teams are competing in the 
Western State Conference championships at Bakersfield College. The finals will 
be held Friday. 
</P>
<P>
At last week's Mount San Antonio College Relays, the SMC men's 4-by-400-meter 
relay team of Marlon Singleton, Aaron Echols, Dido Tshimunga and Sidney Morris 
won their race in 3:19.30, and the 4-by-100 relay team of Singleton, Echols, 
Keith Pouncey and Adelbert Baylis took a second in 42.22. Dennis Wildy ran a 
season-best 4:02.20 for 1,500 meters, finishing second. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica College men's and women's swim teams will compete today 
through Saturday in the Western State Conference championships at Los Angeles 
Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
Last week both teams defeated Ventura, the men by a 49-44 score and the women, 
69-57. 
</P>
<P>
Against Ventura, Cecilia Henricksen was a triple winner in the 50- and 
100-meter butterfly races and in the 200 individual medley and swam a leg for 
the winning 200 medley relay team. Jeannie Chick was a double winner in the 100 
and 200 freestyle events. Double winners for the SMC men were Greg Behar in the 
200 IM and 200 backstroke and Chris Hall in the 1,000 and 500 freestyles, and 
Chris Brainard swam a career-best 1:49 to win the 200 freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
The top-ranked UCLA women's softball team (46-5 overall and 13-1 in the Pacific 
10 Conference as the week began) will play host to Sacramento State in a 
nonconference double-header at 1 p.m. Saturday at the Sunset Canyon diamond on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins are led by sophomore outfielder Yvonne Gutierrez, who entered the 
week with a .371 batting average and 49 hits.

COLEMAN'S SPEED IMPRESSES ANOTHER SWIFT BALLPLAYER; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: BO JACKSON DOES SOME VOLUNTARY SCOUTING, THEN SENDS THE FINDINGS TO 
HIS FORMER COLLEGE COACH. AS A RESULT, THE ST. BERNARD STAR RECEIVES A 
SCHOLARSHIP TO AUBURN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The scouting report on John Coleman crossed the desk of Auburn University's Hal 
Baird in November. 
</P>
<P>
It read: 
</P>
<P>
* Coleman is a good hitter, but is a free swinger at the plate; needs more 
discipline. 
</P>
<P>
* Has extreme quickness; creates havoc on the base paths. 
</P>
<P>
* Gets a good jump on the ball in the outfield, covers the ground to both 
alleys. 
</P>
<P>
* Has an adequate arm, but isn't fundamentally sound in every category. 
</P>
<P>
The report was signed by Bo Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson had been wintering in Marina del Rey during a hiatus from the shoe 
commercials and the football and baseball that normally occupy his time when 
Baird -- his former coach at Auburn -- called and asked for a favor. 
</P>
<P>
Baird wondered if Jackson could have a look at Coleman, a prep standout at St. 
Bernard High School in nearby Playa del Rey. Coleman had contacted Baird 
earlier that fall expressing interest in attending Bo's alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson went to Cal State Dominguez Hills, watched Coleman play for a Los 
Angeles Dodgers scout team, then made his recommendations to the university. 
</P>
<P>
When Baird got the report, he called Bob Yarnall, the baseball coach at St. 
Bernard, to make sure the information was accurate. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, Bo knows John Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Baird read me the report over the phone," Yarnall recalled. "And it 
suited John to a 'T.' Everything in that report was 100% right." 
</P>
<P>
Yarnall told Baird that he thought Jackson might have a future in scouting when 
his multisport career comes to an end. 
</P>
<P>
Baird replied: "Coach, I don't think there's anything Bo can't do." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman, meanwhile, is still learning, but the senior center fielder has enough 
raw tools that Baird offered him a scholarship, based on Bo's report. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman visited Auburn in February, and last week signed a national letter of 
intent to attend the Alabama school. The Tigers won the Southeastern Conference 
baseball championship a year ago, but Baird has found his team lacking in speed 
on the base paths recently. 
</P>
<P>
And speed is something Coleman has in quantity. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman has reportedly been timed for the 40-yard dash in 4.3 seconds, but has 
never run track in his life. He uses the base paths as his showcase, legging 
bunts into singles, stretching singles into doubles, and line drives into 
triples. 
</P>
<P>
He also turns opposing pitchers into head cases on the mound. Coleman leads the 
South Bay in stolen bases this season with 25, five ahead of Hawthorne's 
Armando Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually I just get a big lead and wait the pitcher out," Coleman said. "He'll 
usually throw over to first a few times, and then he'll relax a little bit and 
not think about me as much. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when I go." 
</P>
<P>
In his two-year varsity career, Coleman has yet to be caught stealing in 45 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"John creates a great amount of turmoil for the other team when he gets on base 
and runs wild," Yarnall said. "He's so quick that he gets to top speed within a 
step or two. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't hesitate. When there's a chance to steal, or move up on a passed 
ball or an overthrow, he's up and gone." 
</P>
<P>
St. Anthony left-hander Eric Mooney found that out the hard way recently. In 
the fourth inning of St. Bernard's 10-2 victory, Coleman reached second on an 
error, then stole third. 
</P>
<P>
On the next pitch, Coleman darted home, easily beating Mooney's fastball and 
catcher John Guglielmotta's tag at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
It was Coleman's second steal of home this season. The first came against Bosco 
Tech. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pretty much up at top speed," Coleman said. "But at times like that, I 
try to push myself to go a little bit faster." 
</P>
<P>
Camino Real League opponents would have a tough time believing that Coleman 
could move any faster. For two years, the Viking leadoff man has been a pest, 
setting the table for St. Bernard's big guns. 
</P>
<P>
This season, that means that third baseman Jeff Richardson (.467 batting 
average), second baseman Sean Dunbar (.444), shortstop Grant Hohman (.379) and 
catcher Sean Friedin (.364) are getting plenty of chances to drive in runs. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Coleman had 11 bunt singles and batted .347. His average has 
dipped to .320 this year, but he's hitting .333 with runners in scoring 
position. He has reached base an amazing 67% of the time, and has scored 20 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I'm the leadoff hitter, the team expects me to get on," Coleman said. 
"Whether I get hit by a pitch, or just put the ball in play and run as fast as 
I can, I've got to get on so the other guys can bring me around. And they 
usually do." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman's toughness also comes in handy. He draws a lot of pickoff throws, so 
he spends a good part of most afternoons on his belly, diving back to his base. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a tough kid," said Pete Elash, a St. Bernard assistant coach. "He'll take 
his lumps. In the batter's box, he's not afraid to get hit by a pitch to get on 
base. He'll take a (bruise) for his team." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman is also a positive force in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes John can get a little moody, but that's not rare for a kid his age," 
Yarnall said. "Most of the time, our guys look up to him for inspiration and 
leadership. They believe in him." 
</P>
<P>
So does Bo, and Bo should know.

FISHING NOTES: IT'S TIME TO SHIFT GEAR FROM DEEP WATER TO SURFACE ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's gear shifting time as the spring surface action heats up. Anglers have 
started to hang up their rock cod rods as the transition from deep water action 
to fishing for the exotics begins. 
</P>
<P>
The fall and winter rock cod season proved to be an excellent one where anglers 
could catch a 20-fish limit and fill the freezers with fillets. 
</P>
<P>
Yellowtail have been showing in good numbers at San Clemente Island every day 
with squid the choice bait. 
</P>
<P>
On trips last week, L.A. Harbor Sportfishing's Outerlimits and Shogun scored 
with impressive catches of yellowtail weighing 14 to 30-pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Graham aboard the Outerlimits was using 15-pound test line and continued 
to hook and lose big yellowtail as his light line broke. 
</P>
<P>
The Gardena fisherman said he switched to 20-pound test and set the hook on 
four yellowtail. He decked all of them. They weighed 15 to 24 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Graham wasn't the only one having success with yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Avery, 11, of Torrance pulled a yellowtail out of the kelp, and gave 
battle by following his fish all around the deck while his father cheered. 
After 15 minutes, the fish tired first and came to the surface. It weighed in 
at 22 1/4 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Catalina Island's Two Harbors held its annual spring halibut/white sea bass 
tournament recently with 14 boats participating in the one-day event. However 
the white sea bass refused to cooperate. Steve Quarnstrom of Avalon, was a 
first place finisher with his 9 1/2-pound halibut. A close second was Jay 
Garcia of Avalon with his 8 1/2-pound flattie. 
</P>
<P>
Dates are being set for Two Harbors third annual mako shark tournament in June. 
</P>
<P>
On the local scene big barracuda have moved into a large area outside Rocky 
Point. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Larson of San Pedro, fishing on the Sport King, landed one 30 inches long 
and weighing more than nine pounds. Ben Newman of Wilmington, fishing aboard 
the Victory, caught a limit of 10. One was 8 3/4-pounds. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: Joe Atsumi of West Los Angeles, fishing aboard the Top Gun 
at San Clemente Island, had a yellowtail charge his squid but a white sea bass 
hit the bait first. Atsumi set the hook and was rewarded the whopper of the 
week. His sea bass weighed in at 39 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Barra of San Pedro, fishing at San Clemente aboard the Shogun caught a 
33-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Shirkai of Culver City, fishing aboard the New Hustler, won the jackpot 
when he pulled a yellowtail out of the San Clemente Island kelp. It weighed 29 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Ames of Palos Verdes, fishing at San Clemente Island aboard the 
Outerlimits, caught a 27-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Vernon of Venice, fishing aboard the Happyman in Santa Monica Bay, caught 
a 20-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Lou Rudin of Rancho Palos Verdes won the jackpot aboard the Sea Spray. Fishing 
at Twin Roads, he decked a 14-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Fish Reports: Steady catches of barracuda at Rocky Point have sparked the local 
action. 
</P>
<P>
The outer islands yellowtail counts continue to climb. The white sea bass 
fishing has slowed at Catalina. 
</P>
<P>
At Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Spitfire fished the bay and anglers caught 
54 sculpin, eight sand bass and five halibut.

IN SEARCH OF GENETIC DIVERSITY; 
</P>
<P>
NATURE'S STOREHOUSE OF GENES HAS BEEN EXPLOITED FOR MANY ADVANCES IN 
AGRICULTURE AND MEDICINE. IS THE STOREHOUSE BEING DEPLETED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA K. H. WALTERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
High atop Sierra de Manantlan, near Guadalajara, Mexico, jaguars and ocelots 
stealthily roam and crested wild game birds scrabble through a landscape 
splashed with delicate orchids and giant magnolias. These and 10,000 other 
kinds of living things on the mountain are safe now from the onrush of 
development, people and destruction -- protected in one of Mexico's newest and 
most celebrated preserves. 
</P>
<P>
But when the Sierra de Manantlan Biosphere Reserve was created in 1987, it 
wasn't because of the wildlife or even the exotic flowers. Instead, the 
centerpiece of this ruggedly beautiful reserve is a scruffy, weedy plant, named 
teosinte, that if noticed at all would seem more like a blight than a natural 
treasure. 
</P>
<P>
Teosinte is a wild relative of corn and this particular variety grows on 15 
acres on Sierra de Manantlan and no where else in the world. It has genetic 
traits found in no other plants -- traits that could prove vital to corn fields 
across the world. It has resistance to diseases that commonly afflict other 
varieties, and it's a perennial plant that -- unlike most domesticated 
varieties -- does not have to be replanted year in and year out. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of teosinte and the creation of the 350,000-acre reserve to 
protect it offer a prime illustration of the pivotal role genetic science is 
playing in efforts to uncover nature's secrets and preserve its bounty. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, decisions about conservation, management and use of natural 
resources are being shaped by an understanding of genes and their role in 
adaptation and survival. Genes are tiny chemical instructions in the cells of 
all living things that serve as the building plans of life. Genes determine 
whether the tomato has a thick, bright red skin or a thin, green one; whether a 
giraffe will be slow or fleet of foot; and whether a child will have brown or 
green eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Each species needs genetic diversity -- that is, a wide variety of genes among 
its members -- and the more diversity of species, the better for all. Left 
alone, nature controls the pools of genes a species has for coping with 
diseases, fending off pests and responding to changes in their environment. 
Family members with genes best suited to the environment will survive to pass 
along their genes to future generations. 
</P>
<P>
If all family members are genetically alike, all will respond to changes in 
their environment in the same way. If one can't survive, all will perish. 
</P>
<P>
Humans have been able to exploit nature's storehouse of genes to recover from 
pestilence and bad crop years, improve food production and develop "wonder" 
drugs. But human beings are depleting nature's storehouse at a devastating 
rate. Already, 95% of all the species that ever lived on Earth have become 
extinct. While much of the loss is part of nature, biologists and other 
scientists record with alarm the loss of tens of thousands more species each 
year. And millions of other species -- from micro-organisms to insects to 
mammals -- become endangered daily as man further encroaches on their natural 
habitats. 
</P>
<P>
There's no time to waste, say most genetic conservationists. By the end of this 
century, at the current rate of habitat destruction and narrowing of the 
genetic pool, another million species of plants, animals, insects, fish and 
birds will have become extinct. As the global genetic pool becomes more 
shallow, the paths to adaptation, evolution and survival become more 
precarious. 
</P>
<P>
Loss of biological diversity jeopardizes the world's ability to feed itself, 
deprives us of potentially life-saving or -enhancing materials and can upset 
the social, economic, political and cultural structures that rule the 
relationships between nations and peoples. It closes the door on choices. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is we've got another decade to collect genetic diversity, or the 
game's over," said Cary Fowler, director of the Rural Advancement Fund 
International, a Pittsboro, N.C.-based organization concerned with the 
worldwide loss of genetic resources in plants and animals. 
</P>
<P>
But collecting and protecting genetic diversity is an enormous task, and yet it 
is often left to the under-funded, often divided efforts of a loose network of 
environmentalists, philanthropists and biological and social scientists. Even 
in highly developed countries such as the United States, genetic conservation 
is seldom a national priority. 
</P>
<P>
Worldwide, genetic conservation efforts have been fragmented by international 
squabbling, primarily between the developed nations and the Third World, site 
of the greatest natural diversity. Critics contend that many of the 
industrialized world's policies toward lesser-developed nations actually speed 
the destruction and loss of diversity. 
</P>
<P>
A gene overlooked today, however, could be the basis of tomorrow's wonder drug, 
fiber or food. 
</P>
<P>
For the pharmaceutical industry, the genes of wild, exotic plants, and even 
animals, have been a surprise treasure trove. In recent years, two anti-cancer 
drugs have been developed from the periwinkle native to Madagascar. And only 
now is modern science beginning to prove the validity of many ancient folk 
remedies brewed, distilled, or pounded from native and often wild plants. 
</P>
<P>
"What kind of trouble do we get in when we start making decisions that we do or 
do not need certain characteristics? We're not smart enough to know what we 
(will) need and that's been proven so many times," said Fowler. 
</P>
<P>
Though many see biotechnology, or genetic engineering, as a fallback position 
to genetic conservation, it just isn't so, say the experts. Biotech companies 
that create new drugs, or even develop new varieties of plants and animals, do 
not create brand new genes, as such, but manipulate existing genetic materials. 
</P>
<P>
"If the periwinkle had been obliterated," said Ronald Cape, founder and 
chairman of Cetus, a biotechnology company in Emeryville, Calif., "those two 
cancer drugs wouldn't be available. To invent those molecules out of whole 
cloth -- well, it wouldn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
Cape sees what already is in nature as "a treasure house of existing 
complicated molecules, developed by nature over many years, with therapeutic 
qualities. . . a fantastic shortcut" to biotechnology's work of creating 
improved products. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the bulk of genetic conservation has been in so-called hot-house 
approaches: zoos for animals and seed "banks" for plants. Such off-site 
preservation methods often rely on current and usually incomplete assessments 
of genetic value. 
</P>
<P>
Banks and zoos also often ignore the interdependency of plants, animals and 
insects on each other for survival. The Sierra de Manantlan Biosphere Reserve 
is a frontispiece in the genetic conservation movement because the teosinte 
isn't being saved in isolation: The reserve was deliberately created to save 
the habitat along with a rare species. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican teosinte is special because, while others in its family of wild 
maize relatives are also perennial, only this teosinte has genetic 
characteristics that allow it to be crossed with domestic corn to produce a 
perennial offspring. It may take another five to 10 years to breed a viable, 
commercial strain of domestic corn with the teosinte's valuable genes, yet the 
discovery of the wild plant has brought the dream of a perennial corn into the 
realm of possibility. 
</P>
<P>
Hopes for perennial corn aside, the preservation of teosinte is another bit of 
insurance for the survival of all corn by keeping its genes available in the 
species' gene pool. 
</P>
<P>
For just as genetic diversity is key to survival, genetic uniformity is 
tantamount to vulnerability to the unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
In Ireland in the 1840s, the unexpected was a fungus that was transported by 
ship from North America -- an invasion as deadly as it was surreptitious. The 
fungus found an easy target in the potato fields that were the backbone of 
Irish agriculture; all the potatoes were nearly identical genetically, and all 
susceptible to the fungus. It swept through the fields, laying waste to 
billions of potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 2 1/2 million people died in the Irish potato famine -- perhaps the 
most devastating example in modern history of the dangers of genetic 
uniformity. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, farmers, plant breeders, pesticide makers and scientists have 
learned a great deal about protecting crops. Now, farmers know how to control 
the fungus that devasted the Irish potato fields, as well as many other 
diseases, parasites and environmental conditions that endanger food crops. 
Using biotechnology techniques of isolating and transfering specific genes, 
scientists and plant breeders are even learning to engineer plants that 
"manufacture" their own resistance to pests and disease. 
</P>
<P>
But the most important lesson of the Irish potato famine is that without 
genetic diversity, there can be no real protection of food crops. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the efforts in conservation of genetic diversity, those involving food 
crops are the most sophisticated. In part, that's because an adequate food 
supply is so vital, but also, through the centuries, farmers and gardeners have 
been using and perfecting plant-breeding techniques that have relied on some 
form of conservation. 
</P>
<P>
These techniques, ever being tested in the fields and in the laboratories, have 
resulted in vast increases in the quantity and quality of food being grown the 
world over. The new varieties of high-yielding, disease-resistant wonder crops 
are best suited to mass agriculture techniques that dominate U.S. farming, for 
example. In the Western world, there are now fewer farmers raising more crops 
than ever. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of agribusiness is the proliferation of the best. But that, too, has 
its downside. 
</P>
<P>
"We keep demanding the very best available (and that will) have a tendency over 
time to narrow the genetic bank," Dr. Major M. Goodman, a statistical 
geneticist at North Carolina State University, said. 
</P>
<P>
That was the case in the fields of America's Corn Belt in 1970, when the best 
farmers in the world had planted the very best available seed on prime land, 
using plentiful water, the latest equipment and techniques. 
</P>
<P>
The best seeds were hybrid varieties -- yielding more than 80 bushels of corn 
per acre, four times the average of just 40 years before. And, they were 
vulnerable: The very genetic qualities that made the corn seed so desirable 
also made the corn susceptible to a fungus, called Southern Corn Leaf Blight. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, the blight wiped out about 15% of the U.S. corn harvest, costing 
American farmers more than $1 billion. The farmers, livestock ranchers and 
consumers around the world who rely on U.S. corn harvests were lucky. A turn in 
the weather stopped the leaf blight before it got to the rest of the crop. 
</P>
<P>
It could have been devastating, because so few varieties, only a dozen or so, 
accounted for 80% to 90% of all the corn planted in the Corn Belt. The scare 
was enough to rivet national and worldwide attention on the dangers of genetic 
uniformity. 
</P>
<P>
After the corn leaf blight, a study by the National Academy of Sciences 
reported that many major food crops were "impressively uniform genetically and 
impressively vulnerable." The problem was not just in corn, but in vital crops 
such as hard red winter wheat, soybeans and potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
The shock waves from the corn blight registered throughout the international 
agricultural community. A new agency to support worldwide collection and 
preservation of agricultural diversity was formed in 1974 by the 
internationally supported Consultative Group on International Agricultural 
Research. 
</P>
<P>
The Consultative Group's worldwide network of research centers is primarily 
devoted to plant breeding; ironically, its work in introducing new 
high-yielding, disease-resistant crops to agriculture-poor nations in the 1960s 
and 1970s that sparked the phenomenal increases in food production, called the 
"Green Revolution," has also been criticized by some genetic conservationists 
as having contributed to loss of genetic diversity. 
</P>
<P>
Most plant breeding and research around the world is concentrated on a few 
dozen species of crops -- out of the thousands and thousands of food crops 
raised and eaten around the world -- that are of major economic significance. 
In many cases, the research is further specialized because the aim is to 
develop higher-yielding varieties of these crops. This results in collecting 
practices and policies that focus on the genetic materials of the most modern, 
already highly bred or cultivated varieties, called cultivars. 
</P>
<P>
For plant genetic information, it is the equivalent of having a "world history" 
library that had books about only a handful of countries, and then, only those 
volumes that had been written in the last few decades. 
</P>
<P>
So, like many collections, the research center seed banks are not safes of 
genetic diversity, but reflections of their more pragmatic goals, said Dr. 
Calvin O. Qualset, director of California's Genetic Resources Conservation 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
Neglected at these banks are seeds of lesser known crops, that while less 
globally significant still may be very important to a particular region or 
culture. Also under-represented at seed banks are the primitive varieties, wild 
relatives and land races of the major crops, whose genetic properties are less 
understood or more difficult to use in breeding programs. Land races are 
varieties cultivated and bred through traditional techniques by peasant 
farmers, often over hundreds of thousands of years. 
</P>
<P>
Third World development projects and increased environmental woes -- reaching 
further and further into the native habitats of such crops -- have put at 
highest risk the very crops that are least represented in seed banks. The 
countries poorest in commercial agriculture, whose people may subsist on a few 
local crops that aren't protected in major collections, remain the most 
vulnerable to irretrievable crop losses. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, more and more farmers around the world are planting new and 
often hybrid crop varieties -- a trend helped along by a consolidated and 
globalized seed industry. Instead of the old ways of saving seeds from the best 
of one year's crop for planting the next, peasant farmers now must buy seeds 
for each planting. 
</P>
<P>
When they turned to modern farming techniques and new hybrid varieties, Third 
World farmers often abandoned their historical food crops. In many countries, 
this process was often encouraged by foreign and local government aid policies 
that subsidize farming only if the farmers plant the new varieties. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison Wilkes, a professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts, 
said: "Literally, the genetic heritage of a millennium in a particular valley 
can disappear in a single bowl of porridge if the seeds are cooked and eaten 
instead of saved as seed stock." 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, the hybrids are unsuited to the tropical conditions, or the 
peasant farmers lack the necessary skill, equipment and additives, such as 
fertilizers, required for successful growing of the modern cultivars. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that the new crops die in the fields and the land races are lost 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler, of the Rural Advancement Fund, recalled a visit to Ethiopia in 1985, 
during the height of the famine there. "We drove past mile after mile of (what 
looked to be) onion fields, and I wondered what they were doing growing onions. 
But I was told they weren't onions. We were in corn fields," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The stalks were about a foot tall, when they should have been five to seven 
feet tall. (The farmers) had been given high-yielding corn. But it was 
no-yielding in Ethiopia. That decision," he said, "cost lives." 
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, rice farmers had been growing increasingly dissatisfied 
with the new varieties of rice they had been encouraged to plant instead of the 
land races their families had grown for many generations. In 1986, a large 
group demonstrated outside the International Rice Institute, a Consultative 
Group center that houses one of the world's richest collections of rice genetic 
materials. The rice farmers wanted their old varieties back, and yet didn't 
want to lose the government and foreign support that came with the newer 
varieties. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkes and other genetic conservationists are now urging farmers in rural areas 
of the Third World to keep one field planted in the old land races, even if the 
majority of the crops are new hybrids. And, they are lobbying aid and 
development programs, such as those sponsored by the World Bank, to modify 
subsidy plans and other policies that encourage wholesale conversion to modern 
cultivars and with it, loss of diversity. 
</P>
<P>
"I worry about the guy in the Andes who threw out his old seeds to plant 
DeKalb's latest corn variety," said John H. Barton, a Stanford University law 
professor who is active in international issues. "I'm worried that by a farmer 
in the developing world giving up the seeds his ancestors saved (in order to 
plant) a new variety, we lose our insurance."

<TEXT>
<P>
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, assuming Nicaragua's presidency from a defeated 
revolutionary government in an unruly ceremony, announced plans Wednesday to 
demilitarize this war-weary nation and assigned the chief of the Sandinista 
army to retain his post until the process is complete. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial appointment of Gen. Humberto Ortega, brother of the departing 
Sandinista president, strained Chamorro's 14-party coalition and prompted two 
of her advisers to quit hours before they were to be sworn into her Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
Her decision, greeted with howls of protest from her supporters in a crowd of 
20,000 in Managua's baseball stadium, also stiffened resistance by the 
U.S.-backed Contras to a week-old armistice accord that obliges them to disarm 
by June 10 after eight years of war. 
</P>
<P>
But Chamorro made it clear that the scheduled Contra demobilization will be 
accompanied by two steps that rebel leaders have demanded -- an end to the 
military draft, which was decreed Wednesday, and a reduction of the 
70,000-strong Sandinista-led army through spending cuts. All army conscripts, 
who number about 30,000, will return home "as soon as possible," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"This new stage of our history demands that we reduce the army, reduce the 
defense budget that asphyxiates our economy," she said in a 30-minute inaugural 
speech. "We have to melt the arms and sell the metal to buy machinery for farms 
and factories." 
</P>
<P>
The new president spoke to a bitterly polarized crowd of Sandinistas and 
anti-Sandinistas, who shouted at each other from opposing outfield bleachers, 
jeered many of the 11 visiting heads of government and threw water balloons at 
her and Ortega. 
</P>
<P>
"Blessed Nicaragua," she told them. "Instead of burying its sons in a 
fratricidal war, will bury its weapons forever. . . . Reconciliation is much 
more beautiful than victory." 
</P>
<P>
She announced that she is keeping the defense portfolio herself and ordering 
Gen. Ortega, who held that post under Sandinista rule, "to continue in his job 
(as chief of) the army and establish an orderly program for reducing the armed 
forces and guaranteeing (their) subordination to civil authority." 
</P>
<P>
Aides to Chamorro said that meant Ortega's appointment will be temporary, 
perhaps for six months to a year. 
</P>
<P>
The status of the Sandinista People's Army, the main power base of the one-time 
guerrillas who deposed dictator Anastasio Somoza in July, 1979, and went on to 
rule Nicaragua, has been Chamorro's most difficult decision since her upset 
victory over President Daniel Ortega in the Feb. 25 election. Nearly all army 
officers above the rank of captain are members of the Sandinista National 
Liberation Front. 
</P>
<P>
Under a March 27 agreement between the incoming and outgoing governments, all 
army officers were required to resign their party posts, and about 30 of them, 
including Gen. Ortega, a member of the nine-member Sandinista directorate, did 
so. But nearly every leader of Chamorro's coalition urged her to retire the 
general anyway because he symbolizes Sandinista militarism and would seek to 
keep his party in control of the army. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition's political council, headed by Vice President Virgilio Godoy, 
warned Tuesday that it would not support a reappointment of Gen. Ortega "nor be 
responsible for the consequences." U.S. officials had told Chamorro that the 
army under the general's control might continue giving aid to leftist 
guerrillas in nearby El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
The president's son-in-law and chief adviser, Antonio Lacayo, argued that 
keeping Ortega would forestall a series of strikes by pro-Sandinista unions and 
possible insubordination by the army itself. 
</P>
<P>
Jaime Cuadra, who was to become agriculture minister in Chamorro's government, 
and Gilberto Cuadra, who was to be the construction minister, protested the 
decision and chose not to join the Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
After the Cabinet was sworn in, Godoy commented: "I respect the decision of the 
president but I am not happy." 
</P>
<P>
The other sensitive Cabinet post is the Interior Ministry, led until this week 
by Sandinista founder Tomas Borge. Chamorro named Carlos Hurtado, a former 
civilian adviser to the Contras who returned from exile this year, to succeed 
Borge, and charged him with demilitarizing his security forces under a renamed 
Ministry of Government. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Chamorro's other key appointments are technocrats without strong party 
ties. They include Francisco Mayorga, her chief economic adviser, as president 
of the Central Bank; Enrique Dreyfus, foreign minister; Silvio de Franco, 
economy minister; Francisco Rosales, labor minister; Sofonias Cisneros, 
education minister; Emilio Pereira, finance minister; Roberto Rondon, 
agriculture minister; Jaime Icabalceta, construction minister, and Ernesto 
Salmeron, health minister. Lacayo will serve as minister of the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro, a 60-year-old newspaper publisher and widow of an opposition activist 
who was slain during Somoza's rule, became the first opposition leader to win 
and take office peacefully in Nicaragua's 156-year history. 
</P>
<P>
At the stadium, Nicaragua's first woman chief executive stood on a platform 
behind home plate and took the oath from Miriam Arguello, the new president of 
the National Assembly. Daniel Ortega placed the blue and white presidential 
sash over her left shoulder at 11:57 a.m., and they kissed each other's right 
cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
Invoking the memory of her late husband, Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, the new 
president said: "This is the hour that his blood has born the fruit of his 
dreams. We have reached the promised land. This is the Nicaragua sought by the 
poor to get out of their misery. This is the Nicaragua sought by the exiles 
expelled by dictators. This is the Nicaragua without tyrants, without 
ideologies that destroy reality, without lies that conceal our history." 
</P>
<P>
She proposed a general amnesty for all political crimes, including those of her 
husband's accused killers, and decreed the removal of partisan banners from all 
public offices and monuments. While promising to respect the land titles of 
peasants who benefitted from Sandinista land reforms, she vowed to review 
measures that legalized the seizure of other properties. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony capped a two-month transition in which Chamorro's advisers worked 
closely with the Sandinista leadership to try to control violence on both sides 
and minimize abrupt policy changes. Sandinistas were allowed to plan the 
ceremony and write the oaths of office taken by her and Godoy, which included a 
pledge to "defend the principles of the country and the revolution." 
</P>
<P>
Another sign of collaboration came late Tuesday in the first meeting of the 
National Assembly, when moderates in her coalition joined with the Sandinista 
minority to elect their own mixed slate of leaders, defeating all of the 
candidates of Godoy's hard-line political council except Arguello. 
</P>
<P>
But the mood in the baseball stadium was far from conciliatory. Sandinista 
activists, seated in the left-field bleachers and behind the third base line, 
jeered most of the visiting dignitaries, including U.S. Vice President Dan 
Quayle, and traded insults with the larger crowd of Chamorro supporters in 
right field and behind first base. 
</P>
<P>
Riot police of the largely Sandinista Interior Ministry, now nominally under 
Chamorro's control, made no move against a Sandinista activist who raced into 
left field with a party banner. But they moved in force against Chamorro 
supporters who followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
When President Ortega walked in from center field, he headed toward right field 
but quickly retreated under a hail of water balloons and other thrown objects. 
To chants of "People Power! People Power!" from the Sandinistas, police charged 
into the bleachers and scuffled with Chamorro supporters while Ortega walked to 
the inaugural platform via left field. 
</P>
<P>
Nine minutes later, Chamorro rode in from center field on a white pickup truck, 
wearing a white suit and standing on crutches because of a kneecap she 
fractured in a fall during the election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
As the announcer welcomed her as "president of all Nicaraguans," she rode past 
the jeering Sandinista crowd, dodging scores of water balloons hurled at her. 
</P>
<P>
A score of police officers moved between the truck and the crowd, leaping to 
block the missiles while Chamorro raised both hands in a victory sign. 
</P>
<P>
The hostile spectacle visibly upset Ortega, who waved a finger at an aide to 
try to calm his supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be a constructive opposition," the 44-year-old Ortega later told the 
crowd in his last speech as president. "The tasks that weigh on the new 
government are tasks that all Nicaraguans must share. . . . We are not obliged 
to think the same way, speak the same way, laugh the same way, get mad in the 
same way, but we are obliged to work for peace in the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Searching for points of consensus, he kept getting rebuffed by the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"Are there any Somoza supporters here?" he asked, expecting a unanimous "No." 
Instead, many in the pro-Chamorro crowd stood and pointed across to the 
Sandinistas. 
</P>
<P>
At another point, the Sandinistas chanted: "Daniel, Daniel, we won't give up 
our arms!" 
</P>
<P>
The departing president saved tough language for the Bush Administration, 
warning it not to oppose his brother's army appointment or other compromises 
between his party and the new government. 
</P>
<P>
"Stop dictating policies to the Nicaraguans," he said. "We will decide our 
policies ourselves. If we fight here, it's our own fight, and we will resolve 
it among Nicaraguans."

WEST GERMANY'S TOP OPPOSITION FIGURE STABBED

<P>
The opposition's candidate for chancellor, Oskar Lafontaine, was seriously 
wounded Wednesday night when a woman calmly handed him a bouquet of flowers and 
then slashed his throat with a butcher knife before hundreds of his stunned 
supporters at a campaign rally here. 
</P>
<P>
The attacker was immediately overpowered by bystanders and taken into custody 
by police. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman later identified the woman as Adelheid Streidel, 42, a 
doctor's assistant from the town of Bad Neuenahr, about 40 miles south of here. 
The motive was unknown, and police declined to commment further until she had 
been interrogated. 
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine, who last month was named by the Social Democrats to be their 
candidate for chancellor in next December's general election, was described as 
in serious but stable condition after a 1 1/2-hour operation at the University 
Clinic in Cologne. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that, after the operation, the worst danger is over and we hope 
that there is no permanent damage," said Dr. Heinz Pichelmeier, who led the 
surgical team. "But we must in any case wait until tomorrow to judge 
conclusively." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, doctors said the woman's knife had apparently severed a vein and that 
he had lost much blood. 
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred at a political rally in the city's working-class suburb of 
Muelheim. Lafontaine was standing on the stage with another leading Social 
Democrat, the premier of North Rhine-Westphalia state, Johannes Rau, who had 
just completed a campaign speech to a crowd of about 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses and police officials, the attacker was led onto the 
stage by a man who appeared to be a party security functionary. She was led 
past police who were deployed both in front of the stage and on the steps 
leading to it, the witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, carrying an autograph book as well as her flowers, asked Lafontaine 
for his autograph. As the 46-year-old politician began to write, she pulled out 
an 11.8-inch, double-edged knife and struck at his neck, Cologne police 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine screamed, and West German television news footage showed him 
collapsing to the floor as aides crowded around and the woman was seized. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, in the grip of party officials, stared almost serenely into the 
cameras as pandemonium erupted around her. Voices in the crowd screamed, "Who 
are you! Tell me your name! Say your name!" 
</P>
<P>
She mumbled a refusal to answer, then smiled nervously as police led her away. 
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine, who is also the party's deputy leader and premier of the Saarland 
state, was making one of 11 planned appearances in connection with the North 
Rhine-Westphalia state election scheduled for next month. 
</P>
<P>
Social Democratic Party leader Hans-Jochen Vogel said he felt anger and pain at 
hearing of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
"The causes and details of the attack are still unclear, but at this moment we 
feel ourselves closely bound with Oskar Lafontaine," he told reporters at the 
hospital entrance. 
</P>
<P>
In Paris, Chancellor Helmut Kohl called the attack inhuman and said the 
assailant should be severely judged. 
</P>
<P>
Last January, Lafontaine was reelected as premier of the Saarland, a victory 
that seemed at the time to send his career to new heights and the brink of 
national power. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after that victory, the Times of London began a full-page profile of 
him: "By this time next year, a poor boy from Saarlouis could, at the early age 
of 47, be chancellor of the richest country in Europe. He stands on the 
threshold of greatness -- and he knows it." 
</P>
<P>
In winning that election, Lafontaine was the first nationally known politician 
to detect and capitalize on the backlash in West Germany against the flow of 
refugees from East Germany. He broke new ground by demanding a halt to refugee 
benefits, a measure later agreed to by Kohl's government. 
</P>
<P>
However, within weeks of that victory, he found himself on the wrong side of 
the German unity issue, urging a go-slow approach when the public mood in both 
Germanys wanted rapid reunification. He has not been able to recover from that 
setback and, after the Social Democrats' sister party in East Germany received 
a drubbing in the March 18 elections there, he has trailed Kohl in West German 
public opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine rose to national prominence in 1985 as the bright, clever, new face 
of the Social Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Initially a voice so far to the party's left that some dubbed him "Oskar the 
Red," he later altered his positions more toward the political center, a move 
that opened him to criticism as an opportunist. 
</P>
<P>
A populist, Lafontaine is also one of the party's most important original 
thinkers, co-opting the environmental movement in his home state and pushing 
through a major new party policy last year that called for zero-growth and an 
ecological overhaul of the German economy. 
</P>
<P>
His support for the Atlantic Alliance has always been less than enthusiastic, 
and U.S. officials have fretted privately about Germany's role in the alliance 
should he become chancellor. 
</P>

CAVE PAINTINGS FOR FILM ATTACKED; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: EFFORTS TO CLEAN UP FAKE INDIAN PICTOGRAPHS ON WALL OF STATE PARK 
CAVERN ARE UNSUCCESSFUL. SITE WAS USED FOR SHOOTING OF OLIVER STONE MOVIE ABOUT 
ROCK LEGEND JIM MORRISON.

Artists creating an on-location set for Academy Award-winning filmmaker Oliver 
Stone have defaced a natural limestone cavern in the eastern Mojave Desert, 
painting its pristine walls with phony Indian pictographs that workers have so 
far been unable to remove. 
</P>
<P>
Eager to keep movie productions in California, state officials granted Stone 
permission to shoot a portion of his film on rock legend Jim Morrison of the 
Doors at Mitchell Caverns Natural Preserve in the Providence Mountains State 
Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
Among the numerous restrictions imposed on the March shoot, however, was a 
requirement that artists drawing pictographs on the cave walls use a natural 
powdery substance -- described as "native earth" by the film company -- that is 
easily sucked off with a vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
"They demonstrated the process to us on rocks outside the caverns," said Steven 
Hansen, chief ranger for the state park system's Mojave River District. "It 
appeared to work very satisfactorily, and we had no reason to worry." 
</P>
<P>
But someone, Hansen said, failed to follow the rules. An artist apparently used 
water in applying the native earths, causing the black, white and sienna images 
to seep into the porous limestone. 
</P>
<P>
The film company's work crews discovered the trouble shortly after the shooting 
wrapped up, when their efforts to vacuum the cave walls clean were 
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
State rangers were notified, and they authorized the use of a wire brush on a 
patch of the wall. That technique removed much of the coloring, but failed to 
reach the residue that had seeped into the rock's pores. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Wednesday, officials with the production acknowledged 
responsibility for the error and said they have called in specialists to tackle 
the clean-up project. Art restoration experts associated with the J. Paul Getty 
Museum in Malibu have been contacted, but they will not be available for 
consultation until next week. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something we are very concerned with," said Alex Ho, producer of "The 
Doors." The film company, Ho added, "will spare no expense to remove the 
symbols, but experts are few and far between. We are making every effort to 
solve this problem." 
</P>
<P>
State park officials, while unhappy about the episode, predict there will be no 
lasting damage to the caves -- assuming experts can remove the paint without 
scarring the limestone. 
</P>
<P>
But environmentalists expressed outrage and said the incident underscores their 
argument that allowing Hollywood into the wilderness is a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
"This is absolutely criminal," said Elden Hughes, a desert explorer and Sierra 
Club leader. "This shows total disrespect for a tremendous and rare resource." 
</P>
<P>
"Shame on Oliver Stone for letting it happen," added Jim Dodson, chairman of 
the Sierra Club's Southern California Desert Committee. 
</P>
<P>
While concerned about possible permanent harm to the caverns, Dodson said the 
"larger problem is the state's willingness to just turn over the parks to the 
movie-makers. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't bring in trucks, cameras and crews without causing wear and tear on 
the land. Filming should be limited to areas more suitable for commercial use." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell Caverns, off of Interstate 40 about 35 miles west of Needles, Calif., 
has been part of the state park system since 1958. Known for the spectacular 
stalagmite, stalactite and other mineral formations created by a geologic 
upwelling several million years ago, the caves are the only natural caverns in 
the state park system and draw about 10,000 visitors annually. 
</P>
<P>
For centuries, they were used by the Chemehuevi Indians for shelter, storage 
and some ceremonial purposes, and archeologists have found arrowheads, pottery 
fragments and other items there. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen, whose ranger district includes the area, said Stone applied in February 
for permission to shoot a scene in the site's largest cavern, the 150-foot-long 
Tecopa Cave. In the scene, actor Val Kilmer -- portraying a doped-up Morrison 
-- wanders about the cave in a hallucinatory state and meets with a holy man. 
</P>
<P>
The scene calls for Morrison to study Indian pictographs on the cave walls. 
There were no such symbols in Tecopa Cave, however, so the filmmaker decided to 
create his own. 
</P>
<P>
"First they experimented with painting on a latex skin and gluing that to the 
cave wall, but it looked artificial," Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, about 100 stick figures and other Indian symbols -- most of them the 
size of a human hand -- were drawn directly on the limestone with a brush. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave this a lot of forethought because we have a lot of respect for the 
caves, and we thought the native earth would be the ecologically safe way to 
go," said Larry Fulton, the film's art director. "We did not want to use 
anything . . . that was not environmentally safe." 
</P>
<P>
Fulton said "a little bit of water" may have been used during the application 
process, but stressed that "water is not a binder. It evaporates." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what happened," he said, "but something was different outside 
the cave than it was inside the cave. . . . We're not going to rest until it's 
off and everyone is happy." 
</P>
<P>
While a state ranger periodically checked on the film crew, Hansen said 
monitoring was not constant. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time we checked the artist, she was using dry powder," he said. 
"Apparently she used the water when we weren't around. I guess she thought it 
looked better with water mixed in."

ACCUSED KILLER OF NURSE, TRAINEE BLAMES HOSPITAL FOR RAMPAGE

Bradford Warren Powers Jr., accused of killing two and wounding two in a 
rampage at Mission Bay Memorial Hospital, said Wednesday that he feels "ill 
inside" for the families of the victims but blames the hospital for the 
shooting because it negligently treated his father. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what I did was wrong -- there is no question about that. But there were 
circumstances beyond my control," Powers said in an interview with The Times 
from the downtown jail where he is being held in lieu of $2.5-million bail. "I 
admitted to the actual, you know, shootings. But my defense is based on the 
facts of what brought me to that point. 
</P>
<P>
"There is just so much a person can take. The hospital -- they were the most 
negligent. It's criminal negligence, to me, what they did to my father. And if 
they hadn't been negligent then this whole tragedy could have been avoided." 
</P>
<P>
Powers, 46, described himself as a gentle man who has never "punched with a 
closed fist," or aimed a gun at anyone "until this horrible, horrible 
incident." 
</P>
<P>
"I am the last person in the world to hurt anyone. I won't even swat a fly. If 
one lands on me, I blow it aside. Unless it's constantly irritating me, landing 
on me, landing on me. And then maybe I smash the poor guy." 
</P>
<P>
Something snapped, Powers said, after the death of his father, Brad Powers Sr., 
75, who had gone to the hospital's emergency room twice in two days. On Powers 
Sr.'s second visit, doctors say they did everything possible but were unable to 
save the man, a well-known architectural illustrator who died after suffering a 
heart attack April 14. 
</P>
<P>
Informed in the emergency room's waiting area of his father's death, Powers 
became angry. He returned to the family's La Jolla home, where he lived with 
his parents and his two children. There, he said, he drank a bottle of vodka. 
</P>
<P>
Powers returned to the hospital emergency room eight hours after his father's 
death and fired eight rounds with a .22-caliber revolver, police say. A nurse 
and student medical trainee were killed; a doctor and a patient's father were 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
"I was drinking to relax and it just magnified the problem. I might as well 
tell you now, I feel ill every day, constantly ill inside to think that I did 
what I did to these people. I did it but I wasn't in my right state of mind 
with that damn vodka," Powers said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Police say that Powers did not appear to be under the influence of any drugs or 
medication when he surrendered. They say a blood test showed that he was not 
drunk -- a fact that Powers hotly disputes. Powers said that although he could 
not remember the exact time of the shooting, he recalled that police did not 
test him until 12 to 15 hours after he had been drinking. 
</P>
<P>
About an hour after the shooting, Powers turned himself in to Oceanside police. 
After calling police headquarters from a pay phone, he waited for their 
arrival. 
</P>
<P>
During an arraignment last week, Powers pleaded not guilty to two counts of 
murder and three of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
Powers Sr. had gone to the hospital emergency room April 13, complaining of 
shortness of breath. He was treated and released. Early the next morning, he 
returned to the hospital, complaining of abdominal pain. Doctors then 
discovered an abdominal aneurysm, a condition they said was not present the 
previous day. Telling the family that surgery was the elder Powers' only chance 
for life, doctors operated. But Powers Sr. suffered a heart attack and died on 
the operating table at 8:40 a.m.

The Taiwanese have proposed swapping unofficial representatives with China -- a 
major step toward ending one of the last Cold War standoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Cabinet official Ma Ying-jeow on Wednesday told legislators that Taipei 
wants to set up "private offices" in cities throughout China and would 
reciprocate by allowing Beijing to do the same in Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
"Our contact would be . . . practical and mutual," said Ma, one of the chief 
architects of Taiwan's China policy. 
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the suggestion does not imply recognition of the Beijing 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, many Taiwanese believe that the older hard-liners finally have 
been forced to abandon their policy of "no contact, no negotiation, no 
compromise" with Beijing.

A hydroelectric transformer station exploded Wednesday night, blacking out 
downtown Toronto and surrounding areas in Ontario province, causing traffic 
chaos and sending thousands of people into the streets. Looting was reported. 
</P>
<P>
The blackout forced theaters, malls and stores in the busy downtown area to be 
evacuated. There was no immediate report of arrests or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
One Canadian radio report said 90,000 homes and 10,000 businesses were affected 
by the power outage, which officials said began at about 8:10 p.m. and lasted 
about two hours in much of downtown. In other sections of the city, power 
continued to be out past 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Ontario power spokesman Bill Friday said the power cut out after the explosion 
and fire, which was blamed on equipment failure.

ANTI-DRUG AIRCRAFT GROUNDED BY CONGRESS-WHITE HOUSE SQUABBLETHE DISPUTE CENTERS 
ON WHETHER TO LEND OR GIVE THE FLEET TO PERU AND BOLIVIA. A RESOLUTION COULD 
TAKE MONTHS.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the war on drugs, no one in this capital wants to be on the wrong side. But 
a stubborn squabble between Congress and the Bush Administration this week 
halted deliveries of weapons both sides agree are crucial to the fight. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is a fleet of helicopters slated for the front line in a new 
U.S.-backed assault against drug traffickers in South America. In the 
mountainous terrain where coca-growers thrive, the whirlybirds often can be the 
only way to get around. 
</P>
<P>
The question now is who should own them. Amid the self-congratulations last 
fall when Congress signed off on the broad outlines of the White House plan, no 
one gave the subject much thought. But with the chopper convoy now overdue, 
that left-over debate in the back rooms of the federal government threatens to 
hold up the drug fight in the Andes. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration, it seems, has promised Peru and Bolivia that they can have 
the helicopters for themselves: no strings attached. But Congress refuses to go 
along. Its key players want the Pentagon to loan the helicopters but remain 
free to reel them back if something goes awry. 
</P>
<P>
With each side citing contradictory laws, the result is a stalemate not unusual 
in Washington. All involved insist that they are working toward the same noble 
goal. But once the battle lines are drawn, the means can quickly become more 
important than the end. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Background 
</P>
<P>
The helicopters are included in a massive $125-million package of military 
assistance for Peru, Bolivia and Colombia as part of an unprecedented U.S. 
effort to extend its drug war to the nations that are the source of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
The overall plan was approved by Congress in November, but specific bilateral 
negotiations were put off until after the mid-February summit in Cartagena, 
Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
The final pacts -- setting aside roughly equal shares of aid for the three 
countries -- have only now been completed. 
</P>
<P>
Money should begin to flow soon. It is a different story for the separate 
helicopter budget -- $8 million for 11 Huey UH-1 and UH-60 gunships that the 
Administration proposes to turn over to Peru and Bolivia. Quite bluntly, 
Congress has said no. 
</P>
<P>
The main obstacle is Rep. Lawrence J. (Larry) Smith, a fast-talking Florida 
Democrat who heads a House Foreign Affairs narcotics task force. 
</P>
<P>
When Mexico was discovered in the mid-1980s to have used State 
Department-provided anti-drug aircraft for non-drug flights, Smith drafted 1986 
legislation that was designed to eliminate future fiascoes. 
</P>
<P>
Its key provision requires the State Department to retain title on any aircraft 
it makes available to foreign governments for counter-narcotics purposes. Even 
though the new Administration proposal would switch the gift-giving to the 
Pentagon, Smith contends that the spirit of the law still applies. 
</P>
<P>
"What if something goes wrong down there?" Smith asks. "We couldn't ask for the 
helicopters back." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposing Views 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the congressman's colleagues share his view. "We should get on with 
it," says Rep. Lawrence Coughlin (R-Pa.). But barring a change of mind by 
Smith, his law has spun a legal tangle through which the helicopters cannot 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to untie the knot, Administration officials cite an arms export control 
act, which appears to prohibit the Defense Department from loaning equipment 
abroad. Their contention: The Pentagon by law has no choice but to hand over 
title for the helicopters to Peru and Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, they argue that because Peru is ever-wary of appearing to be a Yanqui 
client, it will agree to fully enlist in the drug fight only if the helicopters 
are turned over without any strings attached. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Prospects 
</P>
<P>
Not untypically, each side sees one perfect solution: that the other concede. 
If that happens, the helicopters could be in action over the Andes by mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
But what is far more likely is prolonged legal wrangling while experts vie to 
prove that the Pentagon either must or cannot loan its drug-fighting choppers 
abroad. And if that happens, negotiators say, Peru and Bolivia may be in for a 
long wait. 
</P>
<P>
The hold-up on the helicopters, one congressional official warns, could persist 
for "weeks if not months."

<P>
Nearly everywhere Bill Bradley went on his rounds recently -- at an outdoor 
rock concert here within sight of the Statue of Liberty, at a high school 
walkathon in Plainfield, at a poster contest in Piscataway -- someone asked him 
about running for President. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the New Jersey Democrat responded with a smile. Sometimes he just 
shrugged. The most he ever said was: "But I like it in the Senate." 
</P>
<P>
It is clear that as he launches his heavily favored candidacy for a third 
Senate term, the 46-year-old Bradley wants to keep everyone guessing about his 
political future. But it is also clear, as Bradley himself indirectly 
acknowledged in an interview, that he is working hard to position himself for 
an ultimate drive for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
That is good news for the many Democrats who for years have been waiting 
hopefully for the former New York Knicks basketball star and Rhodes scholar to 
make his bid for the presidency. They reason that with his Jack Armstrong 
background and his Senate record of devotion to high-minded and moderately 
liberal causes, Bradley could single-handedly shift their party to the 
political mainstream, the required route for regaining the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
When Bradley announced his Senate reelection bid last month, he asserted that 
he expected to serve out his full six-year Senate term. But party pros pointed 
out that Bradley had prefaced this seeming disclaimer of presidential interest 
with the qualifying phrase: "If you asked me today. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"I can't speak for him," said Michael Kaye, a media consultant and longtime 
Bradley adviser. "But I think he feels that when he's ready, he'll run for 
President." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bradley himself was willing to spell out for a reporter what it 
would take for him to consider himself ready for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Of the presidential standards Bradley has established for himself, the one that 
he mentions first is a firsthand knowledge of how Americans of all sorts live 
and work. This is an understanding which Bradley has been pursuing with 
low-profile visits to such widely assorted locales as a Chicago tenement, an 
Indian reservation and the drug-ridden streets of a Newark police beat. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm somebody who has to physically experience an environment in order to know 
it as well as I would like to know it," Bradley explains. "I recognize this is 
impressionistic, not scientific," he concedes. "People say, 'You sound like 
Walt Whitman.' Well, I'll take that comparison." 
</P>
<P>
More conventionally, Bradley has been working to improve his much-maligned 
speaking style. In his Earth Day talk to a throng of 10,000 at Liberty State 
Park here in Jersey City, Bradley showed definite signs of improvement, driving 
home the perils of pollution, by dramatizing the plight of fish doomed to swim 
in polluted waters. 
</P>
<P>
"Ask yourself do you want your children to swim with those fish? Do you want 
the children to eat those fish?" Bradley demanded. 
</P>
<P>
"No!"the crowd shouted back. 
</P>
<P>
As he ambled through the park, shaking hands and signing autographs, the 
6-foot, 5-inch Bradley seemed eminently accessible and relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, Bill," shouted one longtime Knicks fan. "How about one more jump shot for 
us?" 
</P>
<P>
"Sorry," Bradley replied. "The heart is willing but the knees are weak." 
</P>
<P>
Some who have worked with Bradley describe him as an enigmatic figure with a 
strong sense of privacy. Thus, some politicians suspect that even if Bradley 
reaches the state of political readiness to which he aspires, he might avoid 
taking the presidential plunge for personal reasons. "To run for President 
means you have to sacrifice everything else for that goal, including your 
privacy," said former New Jersey Gov. Thomas H. Kean, a Republican who came to 
know Democrat Bradley through their collaboration on the state's problems. "I'm 
not sure that Bradley is ready for that."

East Germans rushed to their banks Wednesday to withdraw their savings, hoping 
to get the best possible exchange rate with the mighty West German mark. 
</P>
<P>
While official delegations from both Germanys met behind closed doors in East 
Berlin to forge a plan for monetary union, worried people stood in long lines 
outside their banks, eager to rescue some of their savings. 
</P>
<P>
The high-level negotiations now taking place are based on a Bonn proposal for a 
basic 1-for-1 exchange rate for wages and pensions. 
</P>
<P>
However, savings accounts would be swapped 1-for-1 only up to 4,000 marks. 
Under the current exchange rate, 4,000 East German marks is worth about $767, 
while 4,000 West German marks is worth about $2,300. 
</P>
<P>
Savings above 4,000 marks would be exchanged at a 2-for-1 rate. 
</P>
<P>
"I've withdrawn all but 4,000 marks and am putting the rest in the account of a 
friend," said a construction worker on East Berlin's Alexander Square who 
refused to be identified. "That way we can both end up with more."

LITHUANIA HOPES TO GET OIL AND GAS FROM OTHER SOVIET REPUBLICS WILLING TO 
BARTER; 
</P>
<P>
SECESSION: THE BREAKAWAY STATE WOULD TRADE MILK AND MEAT. BUT DELIVERY IS A 
MAJOR PROBLEM.

VILNIUS, Soviet Union -- With hopes for substantial help from the West fading, 
Lithuanian leaders set their sights Wednesday on obtaining oil and gas from 
Soviet republics and cities willing to defy Moscow's embargo orders in exchange 
for milk and meat. 
</P>
<P>
But Western analysts noted that even those regions willing to risk the 
Kremlin's wrath, either because they politically support Lithuania or because 
they want to obtain the scarce food supplies, are likely to face serious 
difficulties in delivering oil or gas supplies to the Baltic republic: The 
country's pipelines, roads and railways are centrally controlled. 
</P>
<P>
The Vilnius government, meanwhile, issued a grim report about the future impact 
of the Moscow-imposed economic sanctions, noting that food shortages affecting 
items such as sugar, salt, rice and margarine are likely and warning that the 
republic could only guarantee salaries, pension checks and student grants for 
month of April. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuanian leaders said they are searching for new solutions in the face of the 
U.S. failure to lend significant material or moral support to the republic, 
which declared its independence from the Soviet Union on March 11 and is now 
facing a Kremlin-imposed oil and natural gas embargo. 
</P>
<P>
"One opinion is that the United States must support (President Mikhail S.) 
Gorbachev so democratic processes can take place in the Soviet Union," said 
Lithuanian legislator Virgilijius Chapaitis in an interview. "But the 
Lithuanian issue shows that when democratic processes are really taking place, 
they are prevented." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush said Tuesday that he is adopting a wait-and-see attitude toward 
the Lithuanian struggle before deciding whether to impose sanctions because he 
does not want to act against the Soviet Union in a way that could damage 
Gorbachev's power base. 
</P>
<P>
His position prompted bitterness here, in part because the United States long 
encouraged Lithuanian nationalists by its public refusal to recognize the 
republic's forcible 1940 incorporation into the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
But that traditional policy of support for Lithuania and its sister Baltic 
republics of Latvia and Estonia is in conflict with Washington's current desire 
to promote Gorbachev and to make use of an improved political climate to 
achieve strides in superpower relations. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuanians agreed that they understand but added that they are nevertheless 
disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see this relationship (between Washington and Moscow) 
prosper, of course, but not at our expense," Deputy President Ceslovas 
Stankevicius said in an interview. He said he would like the United States, at 
the very least, to seek guarantees from Moscow that it would not block 
alternative supplies of oil and gas from reaching Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
"I find it hard to believe that the United States of America will really refuse 
to help," he said. "It will be catastrophic if the West washes their hands of 
us, catastrophic for Lithuania, for perestroika (restructuring) and for all the 
things Western countries want to see happen in the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov spoke informally Wednesday, meanwhile, 
with a group of journalists and deputies from the Lithuanian Parliament in the 
lobby of the Supreme Soviet in Moscow during a break in hearings. He reiterated 
previous demands that Lithuania repeal its independence-oriented laws, the 
journalists reported. The Soviet Union so far has refused requests from 
Lithuania to open negotiations as a way out of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
That position also was restated Wednesday by Yevgeny M. Primakov, one of 
Gorbachev's closest advisers, who told the official news agency Tass that talks 
could begin "only if Lithuania withdraws to the March 10 line, i.e., the day 
before Lithuania proclaimed independence." 
</P>
<P>
He said the Lithuanian declaration of independence could not be considered 
serious because it was taken without due consideration, an apparent reference 
to Moscow's position that a republic-wide referendum on the issue should have 
been held. 
</P>
<P>
"Crucial decisions that affect not only the fate of perestroika in the Soviet 
Union but also stability in the world cannot be taken all of a sudden," he told 
Tass. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene, whose weeklong trip to 
Scandinavia yielded little but words of encouragement, was put in charge of a 
new committee set up to devise ways around the Moscow blockade. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been talking a lot, and we haven't come up with anything concrete yet. 
Enough talking. Let's really get something done," Prunskiene told Parliament on 
Wednesday in announcing the latest strategy. 
</P>
<P>
She said Lithuania is seeking independent economic ties with the cities of 
Moscow, Leningrad and Lvov, in the western Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
"Lithuania could supply them with meat and milk in exchange for the goods that 
we need," she said, noting that Lithuania produces all of its meat and dairy 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, she said, a Lithuanian delegation will be traveling to Eastern 
Europe this week to seek trading partners. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Algirdas Brazauskas told Parliament that 7,500 factory 
workers have been laid off their jobs to date but that all would be receiving 
vacation pay until the end of April. He said 46 Lithuanian factories currently 
are working at a reduced production rates. 
</P>
<P>
The number of furloughed workers, however, would jump to 35,000 at the 
beginning of May, he said, adding that at that point the government could no 
longer guarantee salaries, pensions or student grants. 
</P>
<P>
He said the building industry is "in a catastrophe" due to a lack of metal 
reaching the republic and warned that shortages could be expected in cooking 
oil, margarine, sugar, salt, flour, rice and cereals. He also noted that 
Lithuania is considering halting exports of 8,000 tons of meat a month to 
Moscow and 4,000 tons a month to Leningrad, as well as milk exports to the two 
cities. The republic already has stopped the export of manufactured goods to 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The media in Lithuania reported that food hoarding is occurring in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian Parliament, meanwhile, passed a law giving the government 
emergency power to impose legal restrictions for up to a month to deal with the 
blockade, including the right to fine anyone violating rationing restrictions 
on oil products 500 to 800 rubles (about $800 to $1,300 at the official 
exchange rate.) 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, the fact that no country appears willing to help is still 
angering many in this capital city. 
</P>
<P>
Commented 22-year-old Vilana Pilinkaite, an art history student drinking plum 
juice in the popular Cafe Ensemble a few steps from Vilnius University: 
</P>
<P>
"The West's failure to address this economic blockade is the equivalent of a 
moral blockade by the West," she said, "and that is a crime also."

A convoy of vehicles carrying researchers from Japan and Mongolia roared off 
into the Mongolian plains Wednesday in search of the grave of Genghis Khan. 
</P>
<P>
One thousand people watched as 40 Mongolian horsemen led the motorcade out of 
Ulan Bator. 
</P>
<P>
Wrestlers and dancers in traditional Mongolian dress performed before the study 
group headed east for Hentiy province, where the conqueror's grave is believed 
to be situated. 
</P>
<P>
Genghis Khan, the 13th-Century warrior who united Mongolian tribes and forged 
an empire that stretched from the borders of Eastern Europe to the Korean 
Peninsula, was recalled as a dangerous reactionary during 69 years of Communist 
rule. But as Mongolia undertakes sweeping political reforms, he has become a 
national hero, symbolizing a glorious past. 
</P>
<P>
The search for the grave is being financed by Japanese newspapers and 
television stations.

NO MORE 'SHOCK THERAPY,' GORBACHEV TELLS WORKERS; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: HE VISITS AN INDUSTRIAL CITY TO CALM FEARS ABOUT PLANNED ECONOMIC 
REFORMS.

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, acknowledging that workers' "patience is 
at its limit," promised Wednesday that there will be no "shock therapy" to pull 
the country out of its economic crisis and that the people will be consulted 
before consumer prices are raised. 
</P>
<P>
"Your cries of alarm are reaching us," Gorbachev told angry factory workers in 
Sverdlovsk, a major industrial center in the Ural Mountains, where he arrived 
on a trip aimed at calming fears about planned economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people say that those at the top are planning to raise prices all in one 
go, to perform a 'shock therapy,' " he said. "Don't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, who in the face of worker protests over probable price increases and 
unemployment is retreating on his earlier determination to push through bolder 
economic reforms at a faster pace, said that major changes will be deferred six 
to eight months and that there will be extensive discussions before any 
decisions are made. 
</P>
<P>
"You have known for a long time what the government has planned," he said, "but 
now we have reached a stage when we will begin to submit proposals to you, and 
before setting things in motion, we will discuss them with you. So don't 
worry." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's comments, televised nationwide, confirmed his decision to refrain, 
at least temporarily, from plunging the state-managed Soviet economy quickly 
and forcefully into the maelstrom of market forces. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the president's closest advisers had touched off a near-panic with 
proposals that the Soviet Union follow Poland into an overnight, forced 
transition to a market economy, with resulting price increases, plant closures 
and widespread unemployment. Conservatives quickly mobilized resistance to 
moves that they fear would bring an end to socialism here. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, what began as a debate over economic reforms, which have overwhelming 
popular support, quickly turned into a political struggle over the course of 
perestroika, as the program of reform is known. 
</P>
<P>
The country is now in a precarious balance, Gorbachev acknowledged, because of 
the uncertainty over the reforms, the impact they will have on everyday life 
and how they will reshape the Soviet system. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the Presidential Council had considered government proposals for 
this next stage of economic reforms -- a broad sweep of measures that would put 
prices on the basis of supply and demand, privatize many state-owned 
enterprises, shift workers out of unprofitable industries. But, he said, it 
ordered substantial revisions because of the massive social impact of such 
changes. These will be reviewed about May 10. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, meeting with workers at a Moscow radio 
factory Wednesday, encountered complaints similar to those Gorbachev heard. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot launch a program that would make the standard of living decline. . . 
," he responded. " . . . We must avoid taking a road that would lead to serious 
instability in the economy. Before we move forward, we must look into every 
step that we are going to take." 
</P>
<P>
Ryzhkov said he hopes to be able to present a package of economic measures to 
the Supreme Soviet, the country's legislature, in May, but added that their 
implementation and the transition to a "regulated market economy" will come 
only in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation was originally scheduled to be introduced and voted upon this 
month, with the first laws coming into effect May 1 and most of the rest on 
July 1. Soviet officials said earlier this week that most of the legislation 
will not be considered before autumn, thus delaying the program until after the 
Communist Party holds a pivotal congress in July. 
</P>
<P>
As he was pelted with questions and complaints, first by Sverdlovsk workers on 
the street and factory floor and then by plant officials and trade union 
representatives, Gorbachev was clearly embattled in defending his reforms from 
the people whom they were supposed to help. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have in mind is a sharp turn . . . and we cannot allow ourselves to 
realize this all at once," he said. "We shall do as we promised -- we shall 
consult the people. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking with workers at the giant Uralmash Integrated Works, a 
machine-building complex about 900 miles east of Moscow, Gorbachev frankly 
acknowledged the critical level of social discontent in the country, 
attributing it in part to the mounting economic problems but also to 
disappointment in his reform program. 
</P>
<P>
"It can already be seen that people's expectations are at their limit, and 
their patience is at its limit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Uralmash, which was managed by Ryzhkov before he came to Moscow, employs 50,000 
people and produces equipment ranging from excavators to oil-drilling rigs to 
home appliances. Although it is one of the country's leading enterprises, with 
an output valued at more than $1 billion a year, its profits are so low that it 
has not been able to modernize and consequently finds itself less and less able 
to compete on world markets. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, addressing this problem, said he remains convinced that the Soviet 
economy, which is sinking deeper and deeper into a profound recession, must be 
transformed quickly through the introduction of the market forces of supply and 
demand, entrepreneurial management and new technology. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the market for the sake of a market, nor technology for the sake 
of technology, but changes in the situation for the better -- and faster," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sverdlovsk residents have demonstrated over living conditions several times in 
recent months. One protest, just before New Year's Eve, was over the shortage 
of champagne and vodka, and it led to the ouster of the local Communist Party 
leader by party members and his replacement by a more progressive official. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the complaints center around the shortages of food, including rationed 
items such as meat, butter and sugar. Uralmash workers asked Gorbachev why 
there were no televisions and no refrigerators in local stores, not even the 
consumer products that their factory produces. 
</P>
<P>
And a television correspondent noted that although Sverdlovsk ranks second in 
the Russian Republic in terms of production, the city of 1.4 million is only 
40th or 50th in terms of housing, medical care, education and cultural 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything that worries you worries me, too," Gorbachev answered. "Many 
problems have accumulated. We must resolve them properly, all together. We are 
approaching that now, introducing structural changes and including every 
enterprise and every person in the economic reforms." 
</P>
<P>
"We, therefore, must act more wisely, and you here must work more wisely. 
Otherwise, nothing will come from all this." 
</P>
<P>
As a key center in the Soviet defense industry, Sverdlovsk is generally closed 
to foreigners, and correspondents were denied permission to accompany Gorbachev 
to the city.

EYE SPECIALISTS EXAMINE BUSH, TAKE HIM OFF GLAUCOMA DRUG

Two prominent eye doctors confirmed Wednesday that President Bush has a mild 
form of glaucoma, but said he need not continue using prescription eye drops. 
</P>
<P>
"Extensive testing of the eye, including detailed photographs, once again 
revealed no abnormalities and no visual loss," said Dr. Burton Lee, the White 
House physician. 
</P>
<P>
"It was decided to stop the Betagan eye drops and follow him closely for now, 
on no treatment." 
</P>
<P>
Other physicians earlier prescribed the drops every 12 hours and said Bush 
would have to use them for the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Hart, deputy White House press secretary, said the decision to take the 
President off the medication was "simply a difference of opinion" with the 
other doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Bush flew by helicopter to Bethesda Naval Hospital in nearby Maryland to be 
examined by Dr. Richard Brubaker of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and 
Dr. Harry Quigley of Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. Both physicians are 
considered to be experts on glaucoma. 
</P>
<P>
The President spent about an hour in the hospital. Wearing dark glasses as he 
left, he flashed a thumbs-up sign to reporters as he was driven past in his 
limousine. 
</P>
<P>
During his annual checkup on April 12, Bush's physicians found the early-stage 
glaucoma. If untreated, glaucoma can cause gradual impairment of eyesight and, 
at worst, can lead to blindness. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's wife, Barbara, is being treated for double vision and other eye problems 
related to Grave's disease.

GRAHAM NASH PHOTOGRAPHS SALE SETS RECORD; 
</P>
<P>
ART: MORE THAN 400 PICTURES AND ALBUMS SELL FOR $2.4 MILLION. THE MUSICIAN HAS

<P>
Pop star Graham Nash sold his collection of photographs for $2.4 million on 
Wednesday at Sotheby's, setting an auction record for a single collection of 
photos. 
</P>
<P>
"Recycling is fun," Nash said after watching more than 400 of his prized 
photographs and albums find new owners and set record prices. 
</P>
<P>
The 48-year-old singer, who rocked to fame in the '60s with Crosby, Stills 
&amp; Nash, has announced his intention to give a portion of the auction profit 
to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art for the acquisition of contemporary 
photographs, but the amount of the gift has not been disclosed. Nash said his 
accountant had to calculate how much he had spent on purchasing and maintaining 
the collection before he could determine the profit. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles dealer G. Ray Hawkins paid the sale's top price of $99,000, 
including the standard buyer's commission, for Paul Outerbridge's 1927 
"Self-Portrait," depicting the artist in a top hat and mask. Hawkins sold the 
same photograph to Nash for $2,000 14 years ago. Hawkins said Wednesday that he 
got a bargain for his client, an unidentified Los Angeles collector. 
</P>
<P>
Sotheby's had predicted that the Outerbridge would be the top lot in the 
daylong auction and had pegged its value at about $60,000. Bidding started at 
$25,000 and escalated rapidly, temporarily stopping at $85,000. Then Hawkins 
raised his paddle, making his first and final bid of $90,000. After the sale he 
said he had been prepared to pay whatever it took to buy the photograph, which 
he believes is worth $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
The sale nearly quadrupled Outerbridge's record of $26,400, set in 1983 for 
"Abstraction." The auction also raised the profile of an innovative artist who 
died in 1958 and is little known outside art circles. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago dealer Edwynn Houk bought the next two most expensive lots, paying 
$88,000 for Outerbridge's abstract composition, "H-O Box," and $82,500 for 
"Epilogue," Edward Weston's 1919 portrait of his business partner, Margrethe 
Mather. 
</P>
<P>
Works by Diane Arbus also brought extraordinary prices. "Viva at Home," Arbus' 
glassy-eyed portrait of an Andy Warhol protege, sold for $49,500, a record for 
the artist. Nash bought the photograph for $400 from the Simon Lowinsky Gallery 
in San Francisco in the early '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins paid $46,750 for Arbus' "Child With a Toy Hand Grenade in Central Park, 
N.Y.C." The strange image of a boy who seems to fear that the toy will blow up 
in his face was the first photograph in Nash's collection. Lowinsky, who moved 
his gallery to New York several years ago, said he sold that photograph to Nash 
for $1,700. 
</P>
<P>
Nash said he was particularly pleased that the auction brought unprecedented 
prices for Arbus' unconventional work because "the sale places her where she 
belongs in the history of photography." 
</P>
<P>
Among other big ticket works was a vintage print of one of Ansel Adams' most 
celebrated images, "Moonrise, Hernandez New Mexico," which sold for $49,500 to 
Los Angeles dealer Jan Kesner. 
</P>
<P>
Heinrich Kuehn's portrait of photographer Edward Steichen brought $29,700, a 
record for the artist, from a New York collector. Three works by French artist 
Pierre Dubreuil sold for more than $20,000 apiece to Houk, who bought several 
pieces in the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers said that "the celebrity factor" of Nash's ownership may have 
added a bit to the prices but a more important consideration was that the 
material hadn't been on the market for a long time. Unlike photography auctions 
that are composed of works that dealers have been unable to sell, the Nash 
collection seemed to be full of pieces that dealers were eager to buy. 
</P>
<P>
"Graham Nash was the photography collector on the West Coast in the '70s. 
Whenever an important work came into my gallery I showed it to him first," said 
Hawkins. 
</P>

EVEN TELESCOPE'S DOWNTIME IS BOOKED; 
</P>
<P>
RESEARCH: AN ASTRO- PHYSICIST'S IDEA TO GET RANDOM VIEWS OF SPACE AS THE HUBBLE 
IS MOVED STIRS ENVY AMONG HIS COLLEAGUES.

Despite years of planning, significant chunks of precious observation time on 
the space telescope deployed on Wednesday nearly went unused because, until the 
11th hour, no one had thought to take advantage of the telescope's downtime as 
it switched from one task to another. 
</P>
<P>
But when astrophysicist John N. Bahcall finally came up with a productive use 
for that time, he unwittingly stirred up a hornet's nest of envy that also 
illuminated the high stakes involved. 
</P>
<P>
What Bahcall came to recognize was the rare chance to take random "snapshots" 
of the cosmos during the unscheduled minutes while the $1.5-billion telescope 
is being repositioned for each of the hundreds of meticulously planned 
observations during its early years. Each such window of opportunity could last 
four to five minutes, although that may diminish over the years as operators 
become more proficient at maneuvering the 12-ton instrument, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Riccardo Giacconi, director of the NASA-affiliated Space Telescope Science 
Institute in Baltimore, Md., loved Bahcall's idea and, exercising a telescope 
director's traditional prerogative, he readily gave Bahcall that time. 
</P>
<P>
But that riled many astronomers who believed that the time-honored competitive 
process had been bypassed -- even though Bahcall said from the start that he 
would make the "snapshots" accessible to all as soon as they became available. 
</P>
<P>
The flap in part is a reflection of the unprecedented, worldwide competition 
for time on the telescope. 
</P>
<P>
For the initial phase of general observation, for instance, more than 1,500 
astronomers from 30 countries submitted 556 proposals seeking 10,700 hours of 
time. Officials accepted 162 proposals and granted 1,640 hours. 
</P>
<P>
The furor over Bahcall's minutes has prompted NASA to announce that future time 
to make random observations also will be subject to open competition. The 
agency is about to invite applications for the next phase of telescope 
observation time. 
</P>
<P>
There has always been intense rivalry for access to big-ticket science items, 
such as the giant particle accelerator outside Geneva, Switzerland, noted D. 
Allan Bromley, adviser to President Bush for science and technology. 
</P>
<P>
"And it's a demonstrable fact that, when you have a completely new tool," he 
said, "the probability of coming up with something completely new and exciting 
is obviously much greater." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, astronomers have never experienced such fierce competition. And for 
good reason. 
</P>
<P>
By orbiting high above the Earth's distorting atmosphere, the space telescope 
will allow objects to be seen with 10 times greater clarity than with the 
strongest ground-based telescope. It will enable humans to see close to the 
edge of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, winning observation time can well make a career. "No question about it," 
said Nolan R. Walborn, acting director of the science program selection office 
at the space institute. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost a guarantee of research success and career success," said Bahcall, 
president-elect of the American Astronomical Society and a researcher at 
Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study. "Anyone who gets time -- especially 
in the early periods -- most likely will make an important contribution to 
astronomy." 
</P>
<P>
The telescope has a 15-year life expectancy, but there is a largely unspoken 
fear among many that it might suffer a fatal blow from a meteor or one of 
nearly 6,000 pieces of space debris. 
</P>
<P>
"It was always in the back of your mind: What if disaster hits after the first 
year?" said University of Maryland astronomer Roger A. Bell, who chaired one of 
the project's time allocation committees. 
</P>
<P>
Such fears, he said, may help explain the particularly keen competition for 
time early in the telescope's life. 
</P>
<P>
The first eight months in orbit are devoted primarily to testing and 
calibrating the telescope's vast array of delicate instruments. But 
"guaranteed-time observers," the term NASA uses for scientists like Bahcall, 
will be allowed to begin their observations during this phase.

SHOOTING STIRS A FUROR OVER POLICIES IN GEORGIA

<P>
A shooting spree by a former mental patient in which one person was killed and 
four wounded touched off a furor Wednesday in Georgia over mental health policy 
and gun control. 
</P>
<P>
James Calvin Brady, the suspect in the Tuesday shootings at a suburban shopping 
mall, had in his pocket a form saying he was released Monday from a state 
mental hospital where he was treated for showing homicidal tendencies. 
</P>
<P>
The question of why he was released after only 10 days of treatment 
reverberated on radio talk shows, in the subway and on the streets Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
State officials say they were only following criteria for such releases. "There 
are fairly rigid constraints" on holding patients against their will, said John 
Watson, deputy superintendent of the Georgia Regional Hospital, where Brady was 
held. 
</P>
<P>
Overcrowding was not a problem at the hospital, officials said, implying that 
Brady was released because he was judged to be no longer a threat to himself or 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Brady was back in a state mental institution Wednesday, after De Kalb County 
jail officials determined they could not care for him properly. He was taken to 
Central State Hospital in Milledgeville, Ga., for evaluation. Authorities said 
they still expect him to stand trial in the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Ledbetter, commissioner of the state Department of Human Resources, said 
Georgia's eight mental hospitals treat 20,000 patients a year, almost 80% of 
whom are involuntary patients like Brady. He said the shooting was the first 
such incident he recalls involving a former mental patient. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, a routine investigation will be conducted to make sure 
the release was made "in accordance with established medical practice." 
</P>
<P>
Brady bought a handgun just hours after his release from the hospital, renewing 
the debate in Georgia over handgun control. To purchase the weapon, Brady 
merely had to show a driver's license and sign a form declaring, among other 
assertions, that he was not mentally ill. There is no waiting period on gun 
purchases in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Joe Frank Harris conceded that the shootings make "a very strong 
statement" about the need for gun control, but he asserted: "I'm not sure any 
gun control law could prevent something like this happening." 
</P>
<P>
Brady is black, repeatedly identified in television reports as "a well-dressed 
black man." 
</P>
<P>
"He only shot white people," said one of many angry callers to a local radio 
talk show Wednesday. Hospital and De Kalb County police officials said all the 
victims were white, but police made no racial links in the shootings.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DECISION ON SCHOOL AT AMBASSADOR SITE 
DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The State Allocation Board has delayed its decision on whether to give the Los 
Angeles Unified School District the money it needs to build a high school on 
the site of the Ambassador Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The board, which allocates school building funds, met Wednesday in Sacramento, 
but postponed its decision for 30 days because two members were absent. 
</P>
<P>
The school district is asking for $120 million to buy the 24-acre Mid-Wilshire 
site, demolish the hotel and build a 2,500-student school. But the land is 
owned by developer Donald Trump, who has his own plan to put the world's 
tallest skyscraper there. 
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's hearing, several Mid-Wilshire area business owners and residents 
spoke against the school district's proposal, saying it would hurt economic 
development. But a group of parents and teachers pleaded with the state board 
to fund the school, which would provide classrooms for some of the 4,000 
children who must now be bused out of the neighborhood because of overcrowding.

The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday for pay boosts 
ranging from 4% to 11% for 30 general managers and department heads as part of 
a management incentive program. These pay increases will cost county taxpayers 
approximately $178,097.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PANEL OKS LOAN PLEDGE FOR HOUSING PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles City Council committee Wednesday approved a $1.1-million loan 
commitment for an 85-unit housing project near Lincoln Park in East Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Despite concerns by residents that the site contains toxic pollutants, the 
council's Community Redevelopment and Housing Committee approved the loan after 
a hydrogeologist who prepared the report testified that the cost for cleaning 
the chemicals should amount to no more than $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
More than 75 residents of the Hillside Village neighborhood urged the committee 
to reject the loan agreement with Charo Community &amp; Resources Inc. because 
of an environmental engineering report that revealed arsenic and hydrocarbon 
contaminated soil on the site in the 4300 block of Valley Boulevard.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STUDY AUTHORIZED ON USE OF RIVERBEDS FOR 
HIGHWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission Wednesday authorized a 
$100,000 study of the feasibility of allowing car pools, buses and trucks to 
travel the beds of the Los Angeles River and the Tujunga Wash in order to 
relieve congestion. 
</P>
<P>
The six-month study will consider a proposal by Assemblyman Richard Katz 
(D-Sepulveda) to use the riverbed as a highway during rush hours on days when 
there is no threat of flooding. 
</P>
<P>
The commission voted to oppose a bill by state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) 
that would require the state to plan the river as a park and would ban the 
commission from studying it for transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Torres and some environmentalists contend the river should be a verdant park, 
but Katz and others see it as a roadway that could be used as a park on 
evenings and weekends.

FOLEY CALLS FOR ATTACK ON CRISES IN THE U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The dramatic thaw in the Cold War has given the President and Congress an 
opportunity to attack domestic problems with a vigor that will enable this 
nation to "march into the future, rather than drift into the future," House 
Speaker Thomas S. Foley said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a time for self-congratulation for the United States," Foley told a 
general session of the American Newspaper Publishers Assn. convention in 
Century City, noting that with the recent upheavals in Eastern Europe and the 
Soviet Union, "American values seem to be triumphing everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, he said, the United States faces serious problems in 
education, health care, the mounting national debt and the eroding 
infrastructure of highways, airports and public sewer systems. 
</P>
<P>
With the burden of military commitment declining, he said, it is time for the 
nation's leaders, including the President and top members of Congress, to 
"dramatically address these issues. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
He cited recent surveys indicating that half of the 17-year-olds in this 
country cannot read and understand a newspaper editorial. In mathematics, 
science and geography, he said, American students rank far behind their 
counterparts in most of the world's other highly developed nations. 
</P>
<P>
Foley called the country's health-care systems "increasingly dissatisfying," 
despite the fact that more than 11% of the gross national product is expended 
on them. 
</P>
<P>
In areas where the production of goods and services are declining, Foley said, 
the nation's deteriorating infrastructure may be to blame for as much as 80% of 
the drop. He said that rather than focusing on such nations as Japan when 
worrying about the trade deficit, "We should be looking at what we can do to 
improve our own productivity and efficiency." 
</P>
<P>
During a question-and-answer session that followed his speech at the Shubert 
Theater, Foley said he agrees with President Bush's caution in dealing with the 
escalating dispute between the Soviet government and the rebellious republic of 
Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
The congressman said any U.S. attempt to ship oil to the petroleum-starved 
republic would be thwarted by a Soviet naval blockade, and economic sanctions 
against the Soviet Union "probably would not be effective. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I think the President's approach is right," Foley said. "He has strong 
bipartisan support on this issue." 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney also addressed the ANPA 
delegates and said he needs "more than words" before he will gain confidence 
that reforms in the Soviet Union can reduce the threat to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The new openness has not yet transformed hope into the reality of a freer 
government," Cheney said. "And that reality is what we need to see to allay the 
fears of the rest of the world about the Soviets' enormous military power."

SOUTH L.A. CHURCH OFFERS $1,000 REWARD FOR CAPTURE OF GRAFFITI VANDALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Once every few weeks for the last three months, the walls of the Southside 
Bethel Baptist Church in South Los Angeles have been marred by graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the church on the corner of 104th Street and South San Pedro Street 
repeatedly painted over the boldly lettered gang tags, but to no avail. The 
tags soon reappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Finally this week Pastor Allen O. Simmons took matters into his own hands. The 
pastor penned an item for the church bulletin, requesting congregation members 
to come forward with information leading to the arrest of the graffiti vandals. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people who know who's doing this," Simmons said Wednesday as he 
looked at the church's wooden signboard, which apparently had been broken late 
Tuesday night during the most recent spate of graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses may need encouragement to come forward, the pastor figured, so the 
church is putting up a $1,000 reward for information. "Most (witnesses) just 
don't want to get involved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors and congregation members, who attend monthly Neighborhood Watch 
meetings at the church, said the reward may be the best way to put an end to 
the sprayings -- a problem that even police have not been able to curb. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not complaining," said Edmond Emmett, 67, a church deacon who lives less 
than a block from the old two-story stucco church. 
</P>
<P>
"The police have been trying to patrol the neighborhood, but they can't be here 
all the time. It's really up to us to fight this thing." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department's Southeast Division said a 
state ordinance restricts the sale of more than six ounces of spray paint to 
those 18 or older. But vandals appear to have found ways to get around the 
infrequently-enforced law. 
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood youths enlist adults to buy spray paint at stores that refuse to 
sell to the minors, said Clifford Spivey, who manages Andy's True Value 
Hardware store across the street from the church. 
</P>
<P>
"I see the church folks going through a lot of frustration lately," said 
Spivey. The congregation has an account with the store and has made several 
recent purchases of wall paint, Spivey said. 
</P>
<P>
"Used to be old vacant buildings that were marked up, then it moved to houses. 
Now it's churches. It's a simple lack of respect," Spivey said. 
</P>
<P>
Church members are expected to be out in force this week to once again 
eradicate the markings, Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
"Red," he said, clicking his tongue and shaking his head in disgust as he 
pointed to fresh graffiti on the church's facade. "That's something new here. I 
imagine it's going to be hard to cover."

DEVELOPER PURCHASES MCMARTIN SCHOOL, PLANS TO DEMOLISH IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach, from which a torrent of child sex 
abuse allegations sprang nearly seven years ago to touch off the longest and 
costliest criminal trial in U.S. history, has been purchased by a developer who 
wants to tear it down. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Goldstein, a Hermosa Beach real estate broker who bought the property in 
February, said he wants to begin demolishing the preschool soon to build an 
office building. 
</P>
<P>
"Who needs that monument anymore?" he said of the fenced and deserted school 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein's plan, filed with the city of Manhattan Beach last week, calls for 
razing the school and joining the property with another lot for construction of 
a three-story office building. 
</P>
<P>
The project first must be reviewed in public hearings before the Planning 
Commission and City Council, and then must get a permit from the city. 
</P>
<P>
"It will take a little time," said city planner Rosemary Ballister. 
</P>
<P>
The McMartin case erupted in the fall of 1983 when a parent told police that 
her child had been molested at the preschool. Other parents began alleging that 
their children had been abused. 
</P>
<P>
In January, after a preliminary hearing and trial that together lasted more 
than five years, Peggy McMartin Buckey was acquitted of all 12 counts against 
her and Ray Buckey was acquitted of all but 13 of the 53 counts against him. 
</P>
<P>
The jury deadlocked on those 13 counts against Ray Buckey and he is being 
retried on those eight counts. 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein bought the school on Feb. 6 for $320,000 from Buckey attorney Danny 
Davis, according to Los Angeles County records. Davis, who has represented 
Buckey since the start of the McMartin case, said he acquired the property in 
lieu of a legal fee.

SANDINISTA BACKERS HERE STILL ARE LOYAL; 
</P>
<P>
NICARAGUA: SUPPORTERS OF THE OUSTED PARTY IN THE SOUTHLAND REFUSE TO CALL IT 
QUITS. SOME ARE SHIFTING THEIR ATTENTION TO OTHER NEEDS OF THE COUNTRY, WHILE 
OTHERS INTEND TO ACT AS 'WATCHDOGS.' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As Nicaragua's Sandinista government officially came to an end Wednesday, its 
Southern California-based sympathizers were refusing to call it quits. 
</P>
<P>
For those who remain loyal to la revolucion, the initial shock at the 
Sandinistas' loss in elections two months ago has now been replaced by a sad 
resignation and a new resolve to find ways to carry on their work in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
A Topanga-based group that has built homes and schools in Nicaragua for the 
last six years will shift its attention to towns that voted for the 
Sandinistas. A Los Angeles organization that ushers "fact-finding" delegations 
to Managua will take on a mission, serving as "watchdogs" of the pro-American 
government of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro. 
</P>
<P>
Some activists said they remain afraid of what the U.S.-backed Contra rebels, 
most of whom have not yet disarmed, will do. Still other groups report interest 
in Nicaragua is waning. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles has a relatively small Nicaraguan community, made up of those who 
supported the Sandinista government and those who fled it. Despite the small 
size of the community, Los Angeles -- fueled in part by the money and influence 
of the Hollywood crowd -- has served as a major center for political activism 
dedicated to fighting U.S. government policy in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Sandinista supporters from the United States and Europe have made 
regular pilgrimages to Nicaragua over the years. Whether they have a future in 
the new Nicaragua remains a question. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the hundreds of pro-Sandinista activists who live in Southern 
California "had tied up their entire identity" with the Sandinista cause, said 
Lydia Brazon, an activist who works for a Hollywood advertising agency. They 
took the loss personally, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The solidarity (movement) will have to readjust to the reality that exists 
down there now," Brazon added. "Everything will be more difficult, no doubt, 
but to what degree, we don't know yet." 
</P>
<P>
Many Sandinista supporters, taking their cues from the Sandinista Front itself, 
have found ways to explain the dramatic and decisive loss of former President 
Daniel Ortega to Chamorro. They blame nearly 10 years of economic and military 
pressure from the U.S. government for turning voters against the Sandinistas. 
</P>
<P>
"The people voted with a gun to their head," said Blase Bonpane, who heads the 
Office of Americas, a Los Angeles-based organization that opposes U.S. policies 
in Central America. "They thought, 'How do you end the war?' You vote for 
Bush's candidate." 
</P>
<P>
Bonpane's organization shepherds delegations to Nicaragua regularly and will 
continue to do so, he said. Now, however, their task will be to "balance" the 
right-wing forces among Chamorro's supporters and safeguard Sandinista programs 
in health, education and land reform if the new government tries to dismantle 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Kerpen, director of Architects and Planners in Support of Nicaragua, 
said his Topanga-based organization, which started building houses and other 
projects in Nicaragua in 1984, will not work with the new government. Instead, 
the group is turning to new foundations set up by Sandinistas and planning 
projects for towns, such as the city of Leon, that the Sandinista Front carried 
in the election. 
</P>
<P>
Kerpen said he does not believe that the new government has the interests of 
Nicaragua's poor at heart. He spoke by telephone from Managua as he and 
associates watched Chamorro's inauguration on television Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard," Kerpen said. "You sort of hide behind the intellectual event and 
keep working." 
</P>
<P>
Witness for Peace, a national organization that monitored the Contras, plans to 
continue working in Nicaragua to document whether the rebels demobilize and how 
future installments of U.S. aid are handled. But, said Donald Kagan, director 
of the Los Angeles regional office, it is getting tougher to get people 
interested in going to Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Kagan said several delegations from other parts of the country have been 
canceled; the next group from Los Angeles is scheduled to go down in August. 
Without a revolution to watch, people are less interested, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you'll see a shift in interest to Guatemala and El Salvador in the 
solidarity movement as a whole," he said.

AMERICA'S CUP STILL BITTER TO KIWIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN ALEXANDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Make no mistake about it. New Zealanders are passionately united on two 
national issues: They don't want U.S. nuclear ships in their waters, and they 
think the boys in the black hats -- the San Diego Yacht Club and Sail America 
-- cheated them out of the America's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, most San Diegans have long forgotten about the "coma off Point Loma." 
Skipper Dennis Conner may care. Former Sail America head Malin Burnham may 
care. But the average San Diegan has no idea that the New York Court of Appeals 
is expected to hand down the final decision on the fate of the America's Cup 
any day now. 
</P>
<P>
You remember the America's Cup, that silver trophy that has proven to be a boon 
to the legal profession? Micheal Fay, the Kiwi bad boy banker blew into town 
with a surprise challenge and a yacht that looked like an aircraft carrier. The 
San Diegans replied with a catamaran that won an embarrassingly easy victory. 
The lawyers were off and running. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Carmen Ciparick of the New York Supreme Court (our Superior Court) said 
the catamaran wasn't fair and gave the cup to the New Zealanders. An appeals 
court voted 4-1 to overturn her decision and give it back to San Diego. Now the 
highest appeals court in the state of New York, which oversees the 
administration of the cup, is deliberating. The whole thing's got New Zealand 
jumpy. 
</P>
<P>
"You bloody Americans cheated," blurted video repairman Dereck Bunting as he 
sat in a Queenstown bar gulping a hefty lager. An American protested that it is 
a complicated story, and that cheated might not be the right word. 
</P>
<P>
"Complicated, hell. It's not complicated. Your (expletive) Conner cheated." 
</P>
<P>
The Kiwis are as determined as ever to pinch the cup and bring it below the 
Equator and across the date line. To them, the sailing in San Diego was just 
one round in the battle. New Zealanders visiting Auckland stop by the docks at 
the foot of Albert Street to stand and stare at the losing boat, the New 
Zealand, now a little worse for wear and plastered with American Express logos. 
</P>
<P>
Skipper David Barnes, still employed by the New Zealand Challenge, conducts 
tours of the boat for clients of the Fay-Richwhite investment banking company. 
The dialogue goes something like this: 
</P>
<P>
"What we were planning IF the San Diegans had built a similar boat. . . . Of 
course this boat wasn't made to sail against a catamaran . . . . The San 
Diegans didn't have to worry about the same things we did. . . " 
</P>
<P>
Barnes' comments received the same sort of knowing nods one sees from listeners 
hearing a eulogy for a brave soldier. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not just the immediate family, so to speak, that still worries itself 
over the cup. 
</P>
<P>
In the trendy and sometimes raucous Plusone Restaurant in the Auckland 
neighborhood of Ponsonby, a burly former rugby star argues with friends over 
"what might have been" if "the Americans had seen fit to play it straight" and 
sail in a monohull. 
</P>
<P>
In Club Roma, a disco in Auckland where singles go to get hot and sweaty, the 
conversation isn't just about Janet Jackson and miniskirts. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, so you are from San Diego?" a young Kiwi woman asked an American. "Well, 
good on Micheal Fay. I hope he gets the cup." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Conner can't even win grudging words of praise in Sam Diego's wine bar, 
a "California style" lounge across the street from the posh Regent Hotel in 
Auckland. 
</P>
<P>
About the only sympathetic words for Conner concern an episode on New Zealand 
television when TV journalist Paul Holmes ambushed Conner and confronted him 
with video tape of Conner's crude behavior at the post-America's Cup press 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego does not have the corner on frustration," explained Fay spokesman 
Allen Sefton, mistakenly believing that San Diegans felt especially agitated. 
"People here are very frustrated. What you are hearing around the country is 
their frustration." 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knows about it and everybody doesn't like Dennis Conner, and 
everybody doesn't like the catamaran," said Fay in an interview in his Auckland 
offices. "They follow it closely, especially here in Auckland." 
</P>
<P>
While Dennis Conner has had his share of public relations problems in the 
United States as the John McEnroe of the sea, Michael Fay has been blessed with 
ego-stroking coverage in the New Zealand press. New Zealanders feel left out 
down there at the bottom of the world, and they like nothing better than giving 
the big boys a poke. Fay is seen as a national hero who dared stand up to the 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Partly, this depth of interest has been kept alive by Fay's own public 
relations machine in New Zealand, which now consists mostly of Sefton, a former 
yachting writer. 
</P>
<P>
Sefton's job hasn't been difficult in a sports-mad country where talk of 
cricket and rugby far outweigh discussions of politics. Kiwis identify 
themselves as sportsmen. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to understand," explained John Collett on a farm in rural Hawkes 
Bay province. "New Zealand really has no native culture except for sport." 
</P>
<P>
And sailing's one of the big ones. Thousands of small children begin racing 
sailboats in a sort of aquatic Little League by the age of 8, and nearly every 
pub in the country, even in inland areas, boasts a large map of the world used 
to chart the progress of the current Whitbread Round the World race. Two Kiwi 
boats are among the leaders in the marathon sail around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, when the Whitrbread boats arrived in Auckland harbor, tens of thousands 
of people filled the streets to greet them, most staying until the early 
morning hours so they could see all the boats arrive. 
</P>
<P>
Sailors are celebrities in New Zealand. Chris Dickson, winner of last month's 
Congressional Cup races off Long Beach, has his own newspaper column. Fay's 
face is more recognizable than the prime minister's. 
</P>
<P>
But as badly as the Kiwis want the cup, it's not at all certain that the cup 
will get the reception in New Zealand Micheal Fay hopes. Because fair play and 
good sport are of such national importance in New Zealand (and New Zealand is 
still one place where a cricket player who tells the truth and admits he 
dropped the ball gets a huge round of applause), some Kiwis feel that winning a 
cup in the courts just wouldn't be sporting, old chap. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, there seems to be a growing movement toward accepting the cup in a 
kind of trust and not putting the New Zealand name on the trophy until a new 
series can be held and a winner selected on the water. That doesn't jibe with 
Micheal Fay's wishes. He wants the cup so badly, he's amassing artifacts for an 
America's Cup trophy room on the top floor of his office building. 
</P>
<P>
Still New Zealanders were thrilled when the first court handed them the trophy. 
The New Zealand Herald began a regular series of articles about the cup called 
simply "The Defence." The government jumped into the action with "fast track" 
legislation to renovate Auckland's waterfront at a cost of $12 million. Then 
the appeals court took the cup away. Now they wait. 
</P>
<P>
Fay has tried to keep up public morale. He has even taken a bet with his 
partner David Richwhite who is known to have less enthusiasm for the cup than 
Fay does. Fay says the court will will return the cup to the Kiwis. Richwhite 
has bet against it. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of which way the court decides, the Kiwi government has stuck to its 
plans for Auckland. According to Graeme Colman, the executive assistant to the 
minister of external relations and trade, a special America's Cup task force 
has been established to plan for the Auckland defense. Parliament used what 
Colman, who was a press operative in San Diego during the sailing here, 
described as bi-partisan legislation to establish the group. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a new marina along the waterfront," said Colman. "It will be 
built with or without the cup." 
</P>
<P>
The government has been eyeing the much-needed injection of cash a cup defense 
would bring to the stagnant New Zealand economy. Some have estimated that a cup 
series might earn $3.5 billion for the nation. 
</P>
<P>
But even with all the bravado and the weight of the New Zealand government 
behind the cup, some are beginning to admit that the appeals court probably 
will not hand the cup over to the Kiwis. New Zealanders are already concocting 
a cover story in case they lose the legal fight. 
</P>
<P>
"What can you expect from, an American court," asked one of the businessmen at 
the Regent. "How would you like to be one of those judges? They can't rule 
against the Americans." 
</P>
<P>
"Red, white and blue are strong colors," said Fay. "It's an American court, 
isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
It's a futile exercise to try to explain that there is probably very little 
pressure on the judges in New York who have a lot to worry about besides a 
sailing trophy and that the cup case is likely more of a nuisance to the judges 
than a lightning rod for public pressure. 
</P>
<P>
San Diegans have gone on with their lives. There's waves to catch, money to be 
made, the sun is out and the worries of a few wealthy sailors and posturing 
politicians don't make much of a dent in the San Diego psyche. 
</P>
<P>
But in New Zealand, models of past boats and rare books on cup history are 
sitting in Micheal Fay's trophy room waiting to be joined by the cup. Kiwis 
listen with impatience for a panel of judges to tell them if they will enter 
the America's Cup history books or if they will have to find another way to 
give the world a poke.

ARCHITECTURE: DOING A-OK WITH SROS

<TEXT>
<P>
When architects try to justify poor designs by pointing to low budgets, they 
should be exiled for a night to either of two single-room occupancy hotels 
(SROs) designed by architect Rob Quigley. 
</P>
<P>
These downtown buildings, the just-opened J Street Inn and the 4-year-old 
Baltic Inn, were done on a shoestring budget, $6.8 million, and provide 
sub-apartment-size rooms to low- and moderate-income folks, most of whom live 
and work downtown. And the projects succeed with a special flair usually 
reserved for pricier projects. 
</P>
<P>
At the Baltic, which opened in 1986, Quigley used standard low-budget 
construction methods to shape a building to manipulate light and space in 
interesting ways. 
</P>
<P>
Two light wells cut through the 209-unit structure, giving interior rooms 
plenty of natural light. Extra money and design time were dedicated to the 
entry, with its tall arch, neon lettering and colorful tile patterns. Only two 
front units have small balconies, but these add scale and texture to what 
otherwise would have been a flat stucco facade. 
</P>
<P>
The front of the Baltic is best known for its attractive, bargain-basement 
graphic: a large wedge of natural-color stucco that points to the entry. 
</P>
<P>
Rooms at the Baltic -- which was the first SRO to be built in the United States 
in 50 years and the first in California since 1914 -- are 10 by 12 feet, and 
include basic kitchens with small refrigerators and microwaves, and bathrooms 
with toilets only. Showers are down the hall. 
</P>
<P>
The J Street Inn is Quigley's second downtown SRO for a partnership including 
developers Chris Mortenson and Bud Fischer. The 221-room building, which took 
in its first tenants last week, is a step up from the Baltic, with larger (230 
to 308 square feet), better-equipped rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Known as "living units," the rooms are "somewhere between an SRO and a small 
studio apartment," Quigley said. They include full bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Rents at the Baltic start at $275 a month, while at the J Street Inn, the least 
expensive rooms are the 22 at $340 a month set aside for people earning less 
than $15,918 a year. Twenty-two additional rooms at $397 a month are reserved 
for those making less than $18,571, 88 for those making less than $26,500 and 
the rest for those making less than $31,836. Room rents are determined by 
income levels. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for a $900,000 loan at 1 point over prime from the city's 
Redevelopment Agency, the developers agreed to rent to these low- and 
moderate-income groups for the 30-year life of the loan. If they comply, the 
loan and interest will be forgiven at the end of the term. 
</P>
<P>
The agency also asked for on-site parking. The J Street Inn has 92 underground 
spaces, which added nearly $1 million to the project's cost. Mortenson figures 
the new SRO's tenants are more likely to own cars than those at the lower-rent 
Baltic, which has 30 spaces on a nearby lot, but none on site. 
</P>
<P>
New SROs seem to have a strong market. So far, 88 of the J Street Inn's rooms 
have been rented. At the Baltic, occupancy averages about 85%, according to Joe 
Miller, a manager there. 
</P>
<P>
Where Quigley had little more than wood and stucco to work with at the Baltic, 
the J Street Inn's budget afforded more perks. Landscape architects Martin 
Poirier, Laura Burnett and Andy Spurlock of The Spurlock Office made the 
interior light wells into art events. 
</P>
<P>
The Baltic's light wells double as leisure space for the tenants, but, as it 
turns out, socializing tenants create a din that bothers other tenants who want 
quiet. 
</P>
<P>
Mortenson told his designers that the interior light well at the J Street Inn 
shouldn't be usable or conventionally landscaped -- water causes problems when 
it seeps through to underground parking. 
</P>
<P>
To add a calming effect while giving tenants something to look at, The Spurlock 
Office designed two large but inexpensive art pieces for the light well. 
</P>
<P>
One is a fountain consisting of water coursing down a 50-foot length of 
galvanized storm drain pipe. The other is a diagonal concrete beam that 
disappears into the ground, tethered by stainless steel cables. 
</P>
<P>
Interior landscaping consists of crushed granite and seven stands of bamboo. 
Overall, the effect is of a low-budget Japanese Zen garden, and the attempt at 
serenity succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Baltic's, much of the J Street Inn's budget went toward the entry, 
with a tower extending on a diagonal to beckon you in from the corner of 2nd 
Avenue and J Street. The lobby is much larger than the Baltic's. First-floor 
ceilings are extra high, adding a sense of richness considering the budget. 
Colorful tiles help liven things up near the entry. 
</P>
<P>
Also like the Baltic, the J Street project uses a limited number of balconies 
to break up the building's exterior walls. Window awnings help, too. 
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the J Street Inn in the heart of the city's 
redevelopment area -- next to luxury housing such as One Harbor Drive, an 
expensive condominium project about to break ground across the street -- the 
city's redevelopment program shows encouraging signs of meeting diverse housing 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
The new Convention Center and several new downtown hotels require scores of 
blue-collar workers. The Quigley-designed SROs and several others recently 
completed or nearing completion offer clean, affordable living. 
</P>
<P>
But even with abundant new housing ranging from SRO rooms to luxury condos, 
downtown redevelopment isn't covering all the bases. 
</P>
<P>
As a variety of new redevelopment projects, including housing, have spread 
through the Marina Redevelopment Area south of Broadway and west of the Gaslamp 
Quarter, several older, very inexpensive SROs have been lost. 
</P>
<P>
This could well be the reason for the escalating presence of the homeless 
downtown, especially in Centre City East, a few blocks from the core of the 
Marina area. 
</P>
<P>
Two new SROs scheduled to open on 13th Street in August with monthly rents in 
the low $200s could help the situation. 
</P>
<P>
While SROs seem to be the predominant new building type in Centre City East at 
the moment, City Architect Mike Stepner doesn't feel they are being overdone. 
</P>
<P>
"To my mind, they are an improvement over vacant lots and abandoned buildings. 
I feel strongly that they can coexist with other forms of development. 
</P>
<P>
"There are lots of problem areas, but we're getting new development beyond SROs 
in Centre City East -- apartments, new commercial, the new Fine Art Store. 
Little things are happening that are slowly changing the area." 
</P>
<P>
Some people wonder whether more SROs should have parking, but Stepner doesn't 
believe the lowest-cost ones need it. Most of their tenants don't own cars. 
Only three of the 30 spaces in the Baltic's lot are rented by tenants, 
Mortenson said. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's a need for parking downtown in the future, it will be met by 
private-sector providers," Stepner said. 
</P>
<P>
Although many of the new SROs, including the Baltic and the J Street Inn, are 
large, they have only one entrance and offer no uses other than residential. So 
they contribute only marginally to the kinds of street activity that can 
revitalize neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
New SROs designed by Quigley for sites on Island Avenue and on India Street 
will break that trend with ground-floor retail and restaurant uses. 
</P>
<P>
Such mixed-use SROs would generate pedestrian traffic, which would help 
naturally buffer the impact of street people in places such as Centre City 
East. Veteran planners know that an intelligent blend of well-designed projects 
does a lot more than a beefed-up police force to make an urban core secure.

POLITICIANS CUT IN ON CAREFREE DANCERS; 
</P>
<P>
PROTEST: LANCASTER SENIORS REFUSE TO LET CANDIDATES STEAL THE SHOW AND PREEMPT 
THEIR WEEKLY DANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The members of the Carefree Dance Club in Lancaster meet to do the most genteel 
of dances -- the waltz, fox trot and an occasional cha-cha. Their manner is 
refined, too. 
</P>
<P>
At a regular Thursday night dance sponsored by the club at the Antelope Valley 
Senior Center, most of the men wore ties, and most of the carefully coiffured 
women wore dresses or skirts. When a man asked a woman to dance, he politely 
approached and offered his hand. 
</P>
<P>
They were all, in accordance with club rules, above the age of 50 -- but most 
were retired people in their 70s or 80s. 
</P>
<P>
But their refinement and retirement didn't mean they were harmless. Los Angeles 
County officials found this out the hard way last month when they asked members 
of the club to give up just one night of dancing. 
</P>
<P>
The officials had planned to use the senior center -- which is owned by the 
county and used by the dance club free -- on a Thursday night for a candidates' 
forum. Fifteen local politicians running for office were to be on hand to give 
short speeches and answer questions from anyone who might like to attend. The 
dance would be preempted. 
</P>
<P>
"We had followed county policies, and we really didn't anticipate any 
problems," said Nina Frazier, director of the center. "It was for only one 
night." 
</P>
<P>
Frazier might as well have told the dancers they would have to skip a week's 
Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
"They said it was only one night," said an irate Tina Naylor, 64, who lives in 
a seniors' housing complex near the center. "But when you reach our age, you 
never know. We might not make it another night." 
</P>
<P>
When candidates arrived for the forum, they found more than 100 members of the 
club in front of the senior center, with picket signs held high. The signs 
carried messages such as "Unfair to Seniors," "Please Let Us Dance" and most 
distressing to politicians, "Cross This Picket Line, Lose My Vote." 
</P>
<P>
Only seven of the 15 candidates scheduled for the forum entered the building, 
and only about 40 spectators ventured in to hear them. 
</P>
<P>
"We had 'em outnumbered," said a jubilant Claude Bills, 71, a retired golf pro 
who is the president of the club. 
</P>
<P>
The club pretty much got the results it wanted, although Frazier has not 
apologized, as club members demanded. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is any way around it, I would not schedule anything for that night," 
Frazier said in a telephone interview. She had found records that traced the 
club's association with the center back 11 years. "They had not had their night 
preempted for 11 years. Chances are it won't happen for at least another 11 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Club members admit that their protest came about largely because they felt they 
were being unfairly pushed around. But it is also true that dancing is an 
important part of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"I've danced all my life," said Noni Carver, a trim, spirited woman of 83, at a 
recent Thursday night Carefree dance. She was taking a rare break from the 
dance floor, where almost 50 couples were cutting it up to "Sweet Georgia 
Brown." 
</P>
<P>
At one end of the hall, on a stage, the Crescendos, a five-piece ensemble, 
played the music. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our fun," Carver said defiantly. "What are we supposed to do, sit 
around at home?" 
</P>
<P>
There were folding chairs on the perimeter of the wooden dance floor, but only 
a few of the seniors spent much time in them. They were there to dance. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a special style that the ladies like," said John Milbourne, 76, with 
a sly smile. He was standing on the edge of the dance floor, between numbers, 
holding his wife's hand. 
</P>
<P>
Milbourne retired after working 27 years at nearby Edwards Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
"I balance the mass weight here and then shift the mass over so it bounces back 
and forth," he said, demonstrating his style. "Then you have to pay attention 
to the trajectory, so you can just glide through the crowd." 
</P>
<P>
For many, it's a welcome social evening. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to understand that up here there isn't much to do," said Ruth Penn, 
73. "The wife wanted this because it gave her new friends," said her husband, 
Herb, 77, a retired manufacturing engineer from Lockheed. 
</P>
<P>
It's also an important social evening for Chester Wolowicz, 76, a former 
research scientist for NASA, even though he doesn't dance. He had a major 
stroke nine years ago and manages to walk with a cane, but only with great 
difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on the picket line," he said, "in a wheelchair. My wife made a sign for 
me." The sign said, "I come to hear the music." 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Eve, 71, joined him after finishing a dance. She said that her 
husband's stroke was so devastating that at the time, doctors suggested he be 
put in a nursing home. But she brought him back to their own home, determined 
that their lives would include many of the things they enjoyed before his 
illness. High on her list was going to the Carefree dances. 
</P>
<P>
"There are not too many places I can take him," she said. "You go to a 
restaurant, and you are never sure about access, and it's hard for me to lift 
him now. But here we can park right by the door, and I know there will be no 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
A social evening becomes even more important when a spouse is gone. 
</P>
<P>
"When my wife died three years ago after 39 years of marriage," said Lou Abber, 
69, "I was just feeling sorry for myself. And then I finally got myself up and 
got out to dance." 
</P>
<P>
He paused to dab the sweat worked up from dancing to a spirited rendition of 
the Jim Croce song "Leroy Brown." 
</P>
<P>
"The first time, I was like a kid going to his first prom," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Romance is undeniably a possibility under the dimmed lights of the dance hall. 
Indeed, several couples met here. 
</P>
<P>
"I had lost my first husband, so I had to have something to do," said Marion 
Grace Gardner, 59, who was collecting admittance fees at the door. 
</P>
<P>
The charge is $2 on nights when the club has a live band and 50 cents when it's 
just recorded music. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sitting there waiting for someone to ask me to dance and he did," 
Gardner continued, pointing to Chuck Gardner sitting beside her and beaming. "I 
stepped all over his toes." 
</P>
<P>
"Heavens, I didn't even notice," said Chuck, 70, with a hearty laugh. They were 
married three years later. 
</P>
<P>
When Marion gets invited to dance, Chuck watches over the cash box. He doesn't 
dance much anymore because he has cancer, and it has slowed him down. 
</P>
<P>
Abber came back to his chair after another dance to finish his story about his 
first night here. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so nervous," he said. "I didn't know how it worked anymore. But you know 
what? The women, they asked me to dance!" 
</P>
<P>
There was a bit more of his story to tell, but Abber was getting fidgety and 
seemed distracted. Suddenly he rose to his feet. 
</P>
<P>
"I just got to go," he said apologetically. "I've got to get in the last 
dance." 
</P>
<P>
He quickly stepped over to where Mary Halsey, 63, was sitting, took her hand 
and they moved out on to the dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
The band was playing "I'll See You in My Dreams."

MOTHERS RECOVERING FROM ADDICTION GET SPECIAL AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Julie knew she needed help when she realized one morning that she was letting 
her 5-year-old take care of her 1- and 3-year-old daughters all day -- while 
she drank. 
</P>
<P>
"Every morning I would put out a bowl of food for the kids and let them take 
care of themselves," says Julie, who requested that only her first name be 
used. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden it hit me, and I ran out to call my social worker to ask her 
to find a home for my kids," says Julie, 34, a single mother on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
Julie, who lived in a two-bedroom house in Ventura, says she would buy two 
fifths of whiskey, a case of beer and some wine, which she hoped would last a 
week. Unemployed, lonely and isolated, Julie says she struggled to overcome her 
alcoholism but became overwhelmed by her disease and her responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Julie's predicament is not uncommon, says Cathy Anacker, executive director of 
the California Women's Commission on Alcohol and Drug Dependencies in Van Nuys. 
According to the Los Angeles County Offices of Alcohol Programs, 18% of 
American women either have alcohol-related problems or are at high risk for 
such problems. "Women have a tough time because they are typically the ones who 
are responsible for the children," Anacker said. 
</P>
<P>
"Recovering is a full-time effort, and then to add the responsibilities of 
care-giving on top of that -- it's incredibly difficult." 
</P>
<P>
A few organizations are available to help women specifically with alcohol and 
drug dependencies and to offer psychological support and foster care for their 
children. These include Hope for Kids, Rainbow Recovery Centers and Via Avanta. 
</P>
<P>
In Julie's case, her social worker told her about Hope for Kids, an 
Oxnard-based program that recruits foster families to care for children while 
their mothers are recovering. Through Hope for Kids, two of Julie's children 
were placed in one home and the third in another, freeing her to enroll in a 
30-day detoxification program in Oxnard. After detoxification, Julie went to 
Rainbow Recovery Centers, a nonprofit Ventura County-based program for women 
and adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
Rainbow Recovery Centers have two facilities for women -- one in Simi Valley, 
the other in Oxnard -- that provide three to six months of live-in treatment 
for 250 clients a year who are addicted to alcohol and sometimes drugs as well, 
said Kathleen McQuillan, the centers' executive director. In addition to the 
women's facility, Rainbow Recovery Centers have a youth facility in Ventura 
that accommodates six 13- to 17-year-olds and a counseling and educational 
facility in Oxnard for all ages. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to make women aware that they do have a choice," McQuillan said. "They 
don't have to be a punching bag, work at a fast-food facility or be on 
welfare." Since Rainbow Recovery Centers will help with their other 
responsibilities, she points out, "all they have to do is abstain from alcohol 
and drugs and they can change their lives." 
</P>
<P>
To be accepted into Rainbow Recovery Centers -- and there are waiting lists at 
all three residential facilities -- a woman has to make a three-month 
commitment to the program, be motivated to change and have a positive attitude, 
McQuillan said. 
</P>
<P>
The program, funded by Ventura County, the United Way and by fees the 
participants pay once they begin to work, is designed to encourage the clients 
to help in one another's recovery. 
</P>
<P>
"They assign the chores, like who does the wash, and they call each other on 
their behavior," said McQuillan, who added that learning how to interact with 
one another and to rely on others is an important part of the program. 
</P>
<P>
Rainbow Recovery Centers also provide group sessions and involve each client in 
developing a personal plan to break addictions. 
</P>
<P>
Julie, who is still at Rainbow Recovery Centers, sounds determined when she 
says she is committed to finding a job, getting off welfare, finding a place to 
live and getting her children back. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of guilt, but a part of me knows that I'm doing the best I can," 
she said. "I love my kids and I'd rather have them safe with foster parents 
than there with me passed out. I've learned I have to take care of myself 
first. And then I can take care of them." 
</P>
<P>
Rainbow Recovery Centers were founded in 1981 with financial support from the 
California Women's Commission on Alcohol and Drug Dependencies. Developing such 
programs, Anacker said, is the main work of the individual chapters of the 
600-member commission. 
</P>
<P>
The private, nonprofit group, designated a commission in 1974 by the state, now 
has an annual $200,000 budget, Anacker said. The money comes from the state 
Department of Alcoholism Programs, the Los Angeles County Offices of Alcohol 
Programs and individual memberships. 
</P>
<P>
The goals of the commission, Anacker said, are: 
</P>
<P>
* To advocate treatment rather than punishment of drug-addicted mothers. 
</P>
<P>
* To support services that encourage women to become independent. 
</P>
<P>
* To educate the community through classes at local colleges (including Cal 
State Northridge), recovery houses and community groups. 
</P>
<P>
Anacker speaks from personal experience. She was addicted to drugs and alcohol 
15 years ago and her children, 7 and 14, were born while she was recovering. 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Bixler was also an addict. Now the 28-year-old single mother of three is 
working part time as a counselor at Via Avanta in Pacoima, a long-term 
residential recovery program for addicted women and their children. But three 
years ago she was addicted to cocaine, taking three to four grams a day until 
the very day she delivered her son, Shawn, now 2. 
</P>
<P>
"When my son was born, he was immediately taken by Children's Protective 
Services because he had drugs in his system from me," Bixler said. "I was so 
screwed up it didn't faze me." 
</P>
<P>
Bixler didn't see her baby again for six months. Her 8- and 5-year-old children 
were placed in different foster care homes and Bixler was on waiting lists for 
seven different recovery programs. 
</P>
<P>
A counselor told her about Via Avanta, which is a rough equivalent of "the way 
forward" in Latin. She applied and she got right in. She stayed in the program 
for 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest part was wondering if this was going to work for me, and not being 
with my kids," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Because the program only allows mothers to bring one child under age 8 with 
them, Cathy had to pick between her three. She chose baby Shawn, but because he 
was born with an immune-deficiency problem that makes him susceptible to 
infections, she initially had trouble Persuading the staff to allow him in. 
Eventually she succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
Via Avanta, said its program director, Marcellus Robinson, opened in 1971 in 
Venice and moved to Pacoima 11 years ago. Part of the Didi Hirsch Community 
Mental Health Center in Culver City, the program offers a nine- to 18-month 
program with a capacity of 48 women and 20 to 25 children. 
</P>
<P>
The residential program, Robinson said, has one staff member for every seven 
clients and is designed to deal with needs ranging from the women's and 
children's medical problems to parenting education, counseling, and job-hunting 
and money-management skills. The center also has a weekly group to help program 
graduates readjust to the larger world. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of women who need this," Robinson said. "There are not but two 
or three recovery programs where the women can go after in Los Angeles that 
will accept women and children. And without the program, the child has to go 
into the protective services system. Without the program, women have to go into 
recovery without their children." 
</P>
<P>
Now Bixler and her children have an apartment in Van Nuys. After completing the 
program at Via Avanta, she was hired to work 2 1/2 days a week as a counselor. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day I'm working there, I see my life played over and over again in the 
lives of the residents there. And now I'm making it. I'm responsible now. And 
it's not all that hard. I wouldn't change my life right now for anything," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another recovered addict, Ann, 36, says she looks back on the last 10 years she 
has been in treatment and the 14 years she was addicted and wishes she hadn't 
wasted all that valuable time. 
</P>
<P>
"My son is a teen-ager today and we finally have the best relationship, the 
best we've ever had. And now we only have a few short years together before 
he'll leave home," said Ann, who requested that only her first name be used. 
</P>
<P>
Ann started using alcohol when she was 12 or 13 "as a fluke," she said. "It was 
there, so we thought we'd use it." Throughout her adolescence she says she also 
tried marijuana, LSD, amphetamines, barbiturates and heroin. She graduated from 
high school -- barely, she said -- and started working in a series of office 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
And then she tried heroin. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of like it just happened," said Ann, who lives in Ventura. "My 
boyfriend had gone to jail for selling heroin. I was depressed about that and 
my friends just offered me a fix." She said that was when she began to have 
trouble functioning in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"All along there was something down inside me that told me I was doomed from 
the start. A voice kept telling me I didn't have it, I didn't know how to do 
life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Ann said her life really started to fall apart when her son was born. 
Throughout the pregnancy she says she was using heroin. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to the hospital loaded. I don't remember a thing." 
</P>
<P>
She said she nursed her newborn son and continued to use heroin, so the two 
were addicted together. 
</P>
<P>
"I had so much hate and anger toward my baby. He was interfering with my using. 
There was violence; there was abuse," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in an effort to get off the streets, Ann decided to try a residential 
program in Ventura that was based on the 12-step Narcotics Anonymous program. 
Her parents took her son. 
</P>
<P>
For the first few years after she left the residential program, she said, she 
had difficulty assuming responsibilities, including caring for her son. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in denial, guilt and rage," she said, "often flying off in temper 
tantrums. I was horrible." But gradually she straightened out her life. 
</P>
<P>
She is now studying business in college and working part time in an office. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea I was going to stay clean. But it turned out to be one addict 
helping another," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned I had a chance. I had lost my choices and in the program I got them 
back. The obsession was lifted and I gradually came out of the fog. That's 
where the little bit of hope came in. But turning the hope into something real 
took years."

LINCOLN S&amp;L GAVE CRANSTON $300,000 CREDIT LINE IN '86, NEWSPAPER REPORTS

<P>
A $300,000 line of credit was arranged for Sen. Alan Cranston by Lincoln 
Savings &amp; Loan during the late stages of his tight 1986 election campaign, 
it was reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco Chronicle said the funds were never drawn and no laws were 
violated. 
</P>
<P>
The California Democrat and four other senators are under investigation by the 
Senate Ethics Committee in connection with the collapse of the Irvine-based 
thrift, which is expected to cost taxpayers $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The five have been accused of intervening with regulators who were planning to 
close the company. 
</P>
<P>
The Chronicle reported that Darry Sragow, Cranston's 1986 campaign manager, 
said he had no recollection of what specific thrift issued the credit line but 
did recall "a sense" that arrangements had been made for last-minute borrowed 
funds to be available "if we absolutely needed them." 
</P>
<P>
The Chronicle quoted Cranston spokesman Murray Flanders as saying it was his 
understanding the credit line "was there if we needed it. But we didn't, and we 
let it drop." 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said it was told by Brad Boland, a spokesman for Charles Keating, 
chairman of the failed thrift, that the credit line was "agreed on in 
principle" and could have been executed within a day if the Cranston campaign 
had made final application. 
</P>
<P>
The Chronicle said the line was established in October, 1986, the same month 
the Cranston campaign received a $348,250 loan from Deauville S&amp;L, which 
was placed in conservatorship by the government last January. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston defeated Republican Ed Zschau by one percentage point in the campaign.

SURGEONS REMOVE BISHOP'S TUMOR

<TEXT>
<P>
Roman Catholic Bishop Leo T. Maher, who drew widespread attention when he 
banned a pro-choice political candidate from receiving Communion last year, was 
in serious condition after surgery to remove a brain tumor. Maher, 74, was 
alert and able to talk soon after the 2 1/2-hour operation at Scripps Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors said they were optimistic he would recover, but expressed concern about 
the possible recurrence of the life-threatening tumor. Maher, who oversees the 
462,000-member diocese encompassing San Diego and Imperial counties, may be 
released from the hospital in four to seven days, a Scripps spokeswoman said. 
Dr. Thomas Waltz, who led the operating team, said doctors removed 75% to 80% 
of the tumor, which was about 3 inches in diameter. "It's a tumor that you 
really can't classify as either malignant or benign," Waltz said. "It doesn't 
spread to other parts of the body. But it can recur."

POLLUTER POLICY CHANGE CRITICIZED

<TEXT>
<P>
Twelve members of California's Democratic congressional delegation signed a 
letter urging Republican Gov. George Deukmejian to reconsider the state's 
decision to let some toxic polluters clean up their wastes without direct state 
supervision or inspection. "Mr. Governor, with all due respect, toxic polluters 
are not the best candidates for the honor system," said the letter, which was 
written in response to a story in The Times revealing the previously unheralded 
policy shift. The letter acknowledged that the program is designed to speed up 
cleanup of the state's 345 major toxic sites, but it said: "Your Administration 
should allocate greater resources to this high priority responsibility rather 
than turn the job over to the polluting industry." 
</P>
<P>
The letter was initiated by Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez). It was co-signed 
by fellow Democrats Henry A. Waxman and Edward R. Roybal of Los Angeles; Howard 
L. Berman of Panorama City; Matthew G. Martinez of Montebello; George E. Brown 
Jr. of Colton; Don Edwards of San Jose; Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco; Ronald 
V. Dellums of Oakland; Gary Condit of Ceres; Tom Lantos of San Mateo and

FUND REFUSAL COULD HURT YOUTH PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Advocates of a highly touted program for juvenile offenders warned the County 
Board of Supervisors Wednesday that an advisory panel's refusal to fund the 
project could prevent it from being extended to more Latino youths. 
</P>
<P>
"We've exceeded all of our expectations with this program," said Kathy Bonner, 
program director of Shortstop, a juvenile diversion program that has won high 
marks from area judges and lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we need the county's help." 
</P>
<P>
The Shortstop Program takes juvenile offenders convicted of minor crimes and 
exposes them to a shock session that includes locking the youngsters in holding 
cells and briefing them on the life they would face if convicted of a serious 
crime. The program has operated for several years, and now the Orange County 
Bar Foundation hopes to add a Spanish-language version to reach Latino youths 
not proficient in English. 
</P>
<P>
To do that, the program requested $40,000, but it was denied funding by the 
County Justice System Advisory Group, which makes recommendations for 
distributing more than $5 million in state crime-prevention funds. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a matter of priorities, nothing else," said John Peshkoff, chairman of 
the advisory group and director of the county Education Department's juvenile 
court schools. "We feel it's an extremely worthwhile program." 
</P>
<P>
A final vote on the funding requests is not scheduled until May 1, and 
supervisors did not indicate how they plan to vote. Supervisors Gaddi H. 
Vasquez and Don R. Roth appeared sympathetic to the program's appeal, however, 
and Supervisor Roger R. Stanton said later that while he respects the 
recommendations of the advisory panel, he remains open to amending the grant 
proposal so that Shortstop can be funded. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm willing to look at what the other possibilities are," he said, adding that 
he has instructed his staff to explore other funding options.JIM NEWTON

RESIDENTS, OFFICIALS CHEER ELECTION VOTE

<P>
Residents and city officials on Wednesday were cheering the results of this 
week's election, which ended more than four years of controversy over 
development of the Los Alamitos Race Track. 
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted," Mayor Cecilia L. Age said. "We can move forward now." 
</P>
<P>
The passage of the initiative allows the owners of the property to convert 75 
acres of land surrounding the track into a business complex. But for the 
citizens and officials of this bedroom community of 43,000, it means the end to 
a long-standing dispute that, over the years, has included million-dollar 
lawsuits and attempted recalls of City Council members. 
</P>
<P>
"We're ecstatic," said Roger Gueyer, a leader of Concerned Citizens of Cypress 
for Greenbelt and Open Space Preservation, the group instrumental in the defeat 
of prior proposals to develop the race course property. 
</P>
<P>
The complex is expected to generate almost $1 million each year for the city, 
as well as an undetermined number of jobs. Also, developer Lloyd Arnold has 
agreed to continue to restore the adjacent golf course and race course. 
</P>
<P>
The only murmur of dissent came from the neighboring city of Los Alamitos, 
where City Manager Robert C. Dunek said, "We have major concerns about how it 
will affect the city of Los Alamitos." But he said he is optimistic that a 
compromise will be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
For residents of Cypress, Tuesday's vote puts an end to many potentially 
explosive issues, including two lingering lawsuits involving the property. 
</P>
<P>
After an unsuccessful attempt to get a much denser business project passed, the 
then-owner of the property sued the city for $125 million. The current owner 
has agreed to drop the suit. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the city has agreed to drop an appeal of a decision that invalidated 
Measure D, which was a citizens initiative giving residents the ability to 
determine zone changes on large parcels of property in the city. 
</P>
<P>
And city officials agree that the proposal has helped mend the rifts that once 
divided the council. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been getting better. We don't fight as much as we used to," Councilman 
John Kanel said. LYNDA NATALI

SCHOOL CONVERSIONS, CLOSURES CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ocean View School District officials disclosed this week that they might close 
three schools and convert several elementary campuses to middle schools by 
June. 
</P>
<P>
The district, where enrollment has plummeted in recent years, faces a budget 
deficit of between $1.3 million and $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Although officials have not yet announced which schools are being eyed for 
closure, about 100 angry parents, chiefly representing Vista View School, urged 
the school board Tuesday night not to close that school. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the parents said they had heard rumors that Vista View topped the 
district's list of schools targeted for closure, so they sent fliers home with 
students urging parents to attend the board meeting. But board President 
Charles Osterlund said no schools have been selected for closure. 
</P>
<P>
Osterlund said studies indicated that the district would need to eliminate 
three of its 17 schools to bring its average enrollment in line with other 
county districts. Some Ocean View campuses now have 40% fewer students than the 
norm. 
</P>
<P>
A committee of school and district officials and parents is holding a public 
hearing on the issue May 7 at Ocean View High School, and it will present its 
final proposal to the board eight days later. Trustees are scheduled May 22 to 
vote on that plan. 
</P>
<P>
The parents at Tuesday's board meeting said they are determined to voice their 
opinions well before the trustees make a final decision. They defended Vista 
View, a K-8 school with a strong academic record. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to attack the board. We just want you to know that this is a 
community that backs this school," Randy Vanderhook, whose two children attend 
Vista View, told board members. "We don't want to get caught with our shorts 
down and then, boom, something happens and our school gets closed down." 
</P>
<P>
Osterlund told the parents they had no grounds for believing Vista View may be 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
"Many schools, eight or nine, are being looked at," he said. "There are many 
different plans concerning schools being closed down for various reasons, but 
there is not one school singled out. I think you do all of us a disservice" by 
suggesting Vista View may be closed. JOHN PENNER

AIR SHOW PROMISES THRILLS, TRAFFIC ILLS

The annual air show at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station this weekend 
promises impressive aerobatic stunts and maneuvers, but organizers say there 
will be a downside: gridlock on the highways and surface streets. 
</P>
<P>
Officials coordinating the annual Navy Relief Air Show featuring the Blue 
Angels estimate that about a million people will attend the free event during 
its three-day run, which will begin at 8 a.m. Friday with a special show 
limited to senior citizens and the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
The gates will open at 7 a.m. each day and the first plane is scheduled to take 
off at 8 a.m. in a morning series of aerobatic stunt flights. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic is always bad, but officials say this year could be even worse because 
of construction on the Santa Ana Freeway, which has effectively shut down the 
show's traditional access via the Sand Canyon Avenue exit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a mess if people try to get off at Sand Canyon," said Lt. 
Gene Browne, deputy director of public affairs at the Marine base. 
</P>
<P>
The public is being advised to use the Culver Drive and Jeffrey Road exits from 
the southbound Santa Ana Freeway, then proceed east to either the main gate at 
Trabuco Road or Gate 15A off Irvine Boulevard. From the northbound Santa Ana 
Freeway, they are asked to use the Alton Parkway exit, located just north of 
the El Toro Y interchange, and head south to rear Gate 3 off of Fairbanks. 
</P>
<P>
From the San Diego Freeway, the new Sand Canyon Avenue off-ramps will be open 
but traffic will be detoured to Gate 3 via Alton Parkway or Irvine Center 
Drive, said Irvine Police Sgt. Mike Ogden. Signs are posted at all four exits 
to alert motorists of possible delays, and signs will also be posted on surface 
streets to direct air show spectators to the nearest gate. 
</P>
<P>
At noon Friday and Saturday, the Marine Air Ground Task Force, based in Camp 
Pendleton, will demonstrate its combat maneuvers. The U.S. Navy Flight 
Demonstration Squad, better known as the Blue Angels, will take off at 3 p.m. 
On Sunday, the schedule will vary slightly, with a noon opening ceremony 
planned by military officials, followed by the Task Force at 12:30 p.m. and the 
Blue Angels at 3 p.m. All day's shows are expected to end by 4 p.m., Browne 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a crowd of 800,000 attended over the three days, Browne said.

The annual air show at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station makes its three-day

which will be posted with signs leading to the base. WENDY PAULSON

HE CAN PLUNGE AHEAD WITH PLANS FOR POOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sam Gregory's castle on Arbor Street is complete with a moat for the family's 
two ducks, concrete minarets and walkways through the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
And soon, it will have a swimming pool on the roof. 
</P>
<P>
The pool represents the latest joust in a long-running battle Gregory has been 
waging with the city over his plans to build his castle over the old home he 
bought for $120,000 four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
City planners discovered the steel frame for the pool during an inspection. 
There being no law against rooftop pools, the appalled planners asked the City 
Council to pass one. But in a victory for the flamboyant Gregory, the council 
rejected the proposed law earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
"This seemed to be a law aimed specifically at stopping Gregory," said 
Councilman Ed Glasgow, who voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
"The fight is over," said Don Lamm, the city's developmental services manager, 
"but I feel sorry for the neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
The pool will be built into an upper deck above the new second story. It will 
be 26 feet long, 5 feet wide and 3 1/2 feet deep and lined with clear glass. It 
will be directly above the kitchen, said Gregory's wife, Rose, so she can watch 
the children swim as she cooks. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like a bell too, but I think they'd really get noisy over that," Rose 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory, a carpenter, submitted the plans for his castle two years ago. He said 
he has complied strictly with building code requirements. City officials 
concede that this is true, but they argue that he has sometimes violated the 
intent if not the letter of city laws. They say that after filing his original 
plans, he has tried to slip through changes such as the pool without notifying 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
The castle has made Gregory something of a local celebrity. An interview atop 
his house was interrupted when Bill Rush, a Long Beach developer, climbed up to 
the deck to pay homage to the castle builder. 
</P>
<P>
"Sam? Sam Gregory?" Rush asked. "I wanted to shake the hand of the man who 
built the swimming pool on top of the house."LEON TEEBOOM

PARENT SEES FRUITS OF ANTI-DRUG EFFORT 
</P>

<P>
When 50 students from Jordan Elementary School's "Just Say No" club meet 
privately this week with former First Lady Nancy Reagan, one parent will be 
particularly proud. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Donna Weber of East Orange single-handedly launched the group which 
has been named Orange County's "exemplary club" for 1990. Reagan, national 
honorary chairwoman for "Just Say No," will attend a special school assembly at 
Jordan on Thursday and then will meet with club members to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
Weber, 41, had a personal reason for wanting to participate in substance abuse 
prevention at Jordan. Six years ago her younger brother, who she said was a 
crack addict and gang member, was shot and killed in what Weber calls "a bad 
drug deal." 
</P>
<P>
After losing his job, he had come to live with Weber, her husband, Larry, and 
their three daughters. Weber discovered him using drugs in the house and asked 
him to leave. Weeks later, he was dead. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know whether something like 'Just Say No' would've made a difference 
to my brother," Weber said quietly, "but it would make a difference for some 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Weber learned of the "Just Say No" training in 1987 while she was Jordan's 
liaison to CASA, a community organization that works with schools on issues 
such as child abuse and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Describing herself as shy, Weber recalls how she dumped her trademark jeans and 
sweat shirt in favor of high heels and a skirt to meet with a local bank vice 
president about obtaining support for the club. The result was the formation of 
an annual bank-employee bake sale plus $350 the executive raised from his 
Rotary Club -- enough to buy starter kits for the group. 
</P>
<P>
"Her enthusiasm really carried that whole idea along," said Pam Carlson, who as 
Jordan PTA president often helped Weber implement her fund-raising plans. 
"She'd call me and say, 'I really want to do this and I need to do it by 
tomorrow.' " 
</P>
<P>
After a year of fund raising, Weber in 1988 organized an event to mark the 
club's opening that would emphasize a long-term commitment from the school and 
be memorable for the students. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the principal I'd like the mayor here and I'd like the fire chief, I'd 
like the vice president of the bank here. I want everybody here," Weber 
recalled. "He didn't think anyone would come." 
</P>
<P>
But come they did to christen the club. And now, at the request of officials of 
the Orange County "Just Say No" organization, Nancy Reagan will honor the group 
as it completes its second year. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, students crammed the library for the year's first "Just Say No" 
meeting. Membership has leveled off, but more than a quarter of the eligible 
fourth-, fifth- and sixth-graders participate. 
</P>
<P>
Kris Jensen, John Cortez and Scott Laurel, all Jordan sixth-graders, said they 
joined the club for fun but said they think "Just Say No" lessons also help 
prepare them for situations they may confront at junior high next year. 
</P>
<P>
With the club established and with her youngest daughter graduating from Jordan 
this year, Donna Weber has shifted most of her time to helping the homeless. 
Three teachers and two parents now run the semimonthly lunchtime meetings. Role 
playing and exercises to build self-esteem help prepare the students to "say 
no." PTA's Carlson says the club has just begun to reach its potential. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm hoping for our school is that this big event will be a watershed for 
a lot of parents who will say, "Gosh, we really have to keep this kind of thing 
going on," Carlson said.MARY HELEN BERG

RESIDENTS ASKED TO REDUCE WATER USE

<P>
The South Coast Water District is asking South County residents to voluntarily 
reduce water consumption by 10% and vote for Measure F on the June 5 ballot, a 
district spokesman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to a request from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern 
California, the district is asking residents to refrain from washing down 
driveways and sidewalks, overwatering their lawns or landscaped areas and any 
other unnecessary use of water. 
</P>
<P>
If the voluntary effort is not successful, the district may have to demand a 
cutback, said Raymond C. Miller, its general manager. 
</P>
<P>
The district provides water and sewer services to an area that stretches from 
Victoria Beach in Laguna Beach, south to the Dana Point headlands area and 
inland to the Laguna Sur development. 
</P>
<P>
The district is also supporting passage of an $8.5-million general obligation 
bond, called Measure F on the June 5 ballot, that would provide funds to build 
another water pipeline to the area. 
</P>
<P>
If the measure passes, the district would tie into the new Santa Margarita 
water line now being built through Mission Viejo and into San Clemente, Miller 
said. The new line would start at Avenida Pico in San Clemente and run north up 
Stonehill Drive in Dana Point and tie into an existing line at Street of the 
Golden Lantern, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
The district currently relies on only one line for its water needs, with no 
backup in case of emergency, Miller said. That line runs down Laguna Canyon 
Road, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
The Dana Point City Council unanimously endorsed Measure F at its meeting 
Tuesday night. LEN HALL

TOLLWAY AGENCIES BUY RIGHT OF WAY

Officials agreed Wednesday to pay a store $5.8 million for the right to build 
part of the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor directly over the store 
and its parking lot, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Costco, a discount department store that is part of a Seattle-based chain, 
agreed to sell the right-of-way for its Cabot Road store just west of 
Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
That right of way will provide an alternative for linking the corridor with the 
freeway. Orange County Transportation Corridor Agencies officials are also 
considering putting the freeway-corridor link farther south, near Avery 
Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Costco route would have more of an impact on the store, that route 
offers several advantages to area residents and motorists, said Donna Stubbs, 
manager of public affairs for the agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be farther away from the residences in the area, which makes a big 
difference as to what the homeowners would look out and see," Stubbs said. "It 
also calls for improvements to the I-5 freeway and the interchange of the 
freeway and Avery Parkway, which is a problem the way it is now."

Troy High School scored its runs in pairs Wednesday, gaining its sixth 
consecutive victory with an 8-3 decision over Sonora to remain in first place 
in the Freeway League. 
</P>
<P>
Troy (10-8, 7-3) had 11 hits, with leadoff batter Steve Freidrich getting three 
hits, scoring twice, driving in two runs and stealing a base. 
</P>
<P>
Left-hander Guy Pinelli (5-2) settled down after a shaky start to shut out 
Sonora (9-9, 5-5) in the final five innings. Pinelli was called up from junior 
varsity three weeks ago when Troy ace Greg Windell developed tendinitis in his 
pitching shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"I assumed a left-hander was going to be our ace this year, but I thought it 
was going to be Windell," said Dane Illertsen, Troy's coach. "Guy has done a 
great job since coming up from the JVs." 
</P>
<P>
Troy provided Pinelli with plenty of offense, scoring two runs in the first, 
third, fifth and sixth innings against Scott Oxarart (4-6). 
</P>
<P>
Third baseman Matt Carter hit a two-run home run in the first and Freidrich 
added a two-run home run in the sixth as Troy nearly equalled its season home 
run total of three. 
</P>
<P>
Sonora Coach John Link said Troy is playing the best baseball in the league 
down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"The way they're playing now, nobody will catch them," Link said. "When they 
beat Buena Park twice after spring break, they served notice that they're the 
team to beat." 
</P>
<P>
Freidrich, a junior who is a converted center fielder playing catcher, has the 
speed and power that should have scouts lining up to watch him play next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll be one of the best players in the county next year, no matter where he's 
playing," Illertsen said. "He's the best athlete on the team and can play any 
position. We didn't have a catcher, so he volunteered. It's a good position for 
him because he stays involved in every play." 
</P>
<P>
Designated hitter Chris Case also had a big game for Troy, getting three hits 
and driving in a run in the fifth when the Warriors took a 6-3 lead. Brad 
Keays, Sonora's top hitter, had two hits and walked once.

Mater Dei High School's baseball team knew it would take timely hitting, clutch 
pitching and crucial plays on defense to get by Bishop Amat and take over first 
place in the Angelus League standings. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for the Monarchs, they got all three, plus a critical balk call, 
and defeated the visiting Lancers, 2-1, Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei starter Sean Sutton pitched six solid innings, yielding only one run 
and seven hits. He also struck out five and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Frankel, filling in at third base for the injured Ryan Anderson, and 
sophomore catcher Cale Carter supplied the key plays on offense and defense to 
move the Monarchs (14-6, 6-3) ahead of the Lancers (12-7, 5-4) in the league 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
Frankel and Carter combined for the deciding run in the sixth inning after 
helping Sutton get out of a jam in the first. Carter hit a pitch from reliever 
Eric White to the fence in left-center for a double and scored on Frankel's 
single to right for the winning margin. 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the first, Bishop Amat's J.D. Delgado was cut down at the plate 
trying to score from third on White's bouncer to Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankel made the play in the first inning," Monarch Coach Bob Ickes said. "It 
was a perfect throw to the plate and Carter did a great job of blocking the 
plate to get us out of there. Sutton usually has his problems in the first 
inning but gets stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei broke open a scoreless tie in the fifth when Bishop Amat pitcher J.D. 
Romero was called for a balk.That brought home Taylor Ivey, who had singled and 
advanced on a single by Rick Ellis and a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
White tied the score in the sixth when he singled and took third on George 
Garcia's single to right and scored on Charles Rodriguez's fly to left. 
</P>
<P>
In another league game: 
</P>
<P>
Servite 12, Bishop Montgomery 7 -- Whit Haydon had three hits, scored three 
times and had three RBIs for visiting Servite (15-5, 4-3).

Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc., which has vowed for months that none of its 
assets were for sale, said Wednesday it is discussing the possible sale of a 
portion of its publishing business. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Jovanovich, president and chief executive officer, said the Orlando-based 
corporation has begun preliminary discussions involving the sale of some or all 
of its existing debt at a discount, or the purchase of "certain assets of the 
company by a third party." 
</P>

The statement followed a report earlier Wednesday that former U.S. Sen. Eugene 
McCarthy, who has served for a decade on HBJ's board, said discussions had been 
under way with Thomson Corp. of Canada for a month. 
</P>
<P>
The report by Dow Jones News Service said McCarthy did not know whether HBJ or 
Thomson made the initial overture.

Economy Hotel: Marriott Corp. has already dotted the county with hotels 
offering a range of room rates. And, on Wednesday, the giant lodging chain 
dedicated its newest hotel, the 135-room Fairfield Inn in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
The Fairfield Inn is the economy version of the Marriott group. For prices 
starting at $31.95 a night, weary travelers get few extras: For example, the 
rooms offer no travel-size shampoo or bubble bath. The hotel has only one 
meeting room and no attached restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
But the Fairfield Inn, on Orangethorpe Avenue near Knott Avenue, does have a 
swimming pool. Although it may sound closer to the Motel 6 price range, 
Fairfield Inn spokeswoman Dee Dee Dochen said other Fairfield Inns around the 
country typically draw from budget-conscious travelers who want Marriott 
quality without Marriott prices. 
</P>
<P>
While new to Orange County, Fairfield Inns now has 50 locations around the 
nation.

DOCTORS GET SHILEY LETTER WARNING OF VALVE RISKS;

HEART PATIENTS: PHYSICIANS AND EMERGENCY ROOM PERSONNEL TOLD WHAT SYMPTOMS TO

Shiley Inc. has sent more than 270,000 letters to physicians and emergency room 
practitioners nationwide to update them about the risk associated with one of 
its heart valves and to describe symptoms to look for in patients whose 
implanted valves might have fractured. 
</P>
<P>
The letters were mailed shortly after March 24, when the Public Citizen Health 
Research Group, a Washington-based watchdog group founded by Ralph Nader, filed 
a suit in Los Angeles Superior Court asking the court to order Shiley and its 
corporate parent, Pfizer Inc. of New York, to notify people who received valve 
implants of potential malfunctions. 
</P>
<P>
Shiley officials, however, said that the mailing was not connected to the 
lawsuit. "The letter was drafted and ready and an appointment had been made 
with the (Food and Drug Administration) to discuss it some weeks before that 
lawsuit was filed," said Dr. Roger Sachs, vice president-medical director at 
Shiley. 
</P>
<P>
Although Shiley had no new information to convey about the valves, which the 
company no longer manufactures, he said the letters were mailed to counter "a 
lot of confusion" caused by recent reports in the media. 
</P>
<P>
Sachs added that in the next few seeks Shiley intends to send similar letters 
to physicians overseas, where about half of the Bjork-Shiley valves were sold. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine-based company said it has sent out warning letters periodically 
since 1980 after the first valve fractures were reported and the valves began 
to be pulled off the market. But the company said this is the first time that 
family physicians and internists as well as emergency room personnel and their 
professional organizations are being notified. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, Shiley said, warning letters were sent only to a much smaller group 
of heart surgeons and cardiologists, under the assumption that most patients 
with heart valves would be under the continuing care of these specialists. 
</P>
<P>
Since the first of two Shiley valves that are the center of controversy went on 
the market in 1979, the company has reported a total of 389 failures resulting 
in 272 deaths. About 85,700 of the two valve models were produced before the 
company stopped manufacturing and selling them in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
A copy of Shiley's most recent "Dear Doctor" letter, dated March 30, said, 
"Emergency room and primary care physicians who usually do not attend or 
monitor patients with heart valves should be especially alert to signs and 
symptoms of heart valve malfunction." 
</P>
<P>
It said that malfunctioning of the Bjork-Shiley 60-degree Convexo-Concave heart 
valve "may occur without warning and is life-threatening. If medical personnel 
do not quickly identify prosthetic heart valve failure as the source of a 
patient's difficulties, valuable time can be lost in instituting treatment." 
</P>
<P>
The letter further advises physicians to let their patients and the patients' 
family members know the symptoms and what to do in the event of a valve 
malfunction. It suggests that patients carry a card with information about 
their implant in their wallet or purse and possibly also a bracelet or other 
device containing the information. 
</P>
<P>
The mailing also follows hearings by a subcommittee of the House Energy and 
Commerce Committee on the FDA's oversight of Shiley. The hearings included 
testimony that heart valve failures have been misdiagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Frank Barbee, a Wisconsin resident, testified that his wife died 
from a valve malfunction because the problem was misdiagnosed by emergency room 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe she would still be alive today if some effort had been made to 
inform the appropriate people of the potential malfunction of something as 
critical to life as a mechanical heart valve," Barbee said. 
</P>
<P>
Barbee also noted that if he had been aware of the symptoms, he would not have 
incorrectly concluded she was suffering a heart attack, which led him to "take 
her to a closer but limited facility that could treat a heart attack but not a 
broken valve." 
</P>
<P>
FDA spokesman Mark Barnett said the content of Shiley's letter was approved by 
agency officials, who, he said, added the recommendation that valve recipients 
wear identification. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA is conducting a series of public hearings to decide whether to revise 
its policy that calls for the manufacturer or medical facility at which a heart 
valve is implanted to notify physicians about defective devices. 
</P>
<P>
"The physician then uses discretion in deciding whether and how to explain the 
situation to each patient," the FDA said in a background paper attached to a 
notification of the first meeting on the issue that was held March 26. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the Public Citizen Health Research Group said that organization 
believes that Shiley's latest letter is more "complete and accurate" and less 
"promotional" than previous ones. They also said they were pleased that family 
physicians are being informed, although they would still prefer patients 
themselves to be notified. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it is an undue burden to place on the physicians to expect them to 
notify the implantees. It is one step short, but it is a step in the right 
direction," said Jim Capretz, one of the patient advocacy group's attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Sachs at Shiley said that at this point, the company is making no effort to 
contact implant patients. "The basic reason is we still believe the proper 
avenue for patient information is through the physicians," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sachs also said that notification of all people who had Bjork-Shiley valve 
implants would be impossible because the company doesn't know who they are. He 
said hospitals that implanted the valves mailed back information cards to the 
company in only about half of the cases. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the research group's contention that the current notification 
letter is more candid and less "promotional" in tone than previous Shiley 
letters, Sachs said the criticism wasn't fair. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously when you are no longer marketing a valve, nothing can be intended or 
interpreted as promotional," he observed. But, he added, "we still feel the 
benefit of the valves outweigh the risk. The ultimate reason for withdrawing 
the valves completely (from the market) was that the climate was so bad. We 
weren't selling any."

HYCOR BIOMEDICAL GETS APPROVAL FOR INSTANT DRUG TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Hycor Biomedical Inc. said Wednesday that it has received approval from the U.S 
Food and Drug Administration for the second of five instant drug tests that it 
hopes to begin marketing this summer. 
</P>
<P>
In March, the FDA approved Hycor's "accupinch" urine test for cocaine, and now 
the federal agency has also approved a test for opiates such as heroin and 
morphine. Reg Jones, Hycor's chief financial officer, said that tests for 
marijuana and PCP have been submitted to the FDA and that a test for 
methamphetamine will be submitted later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike conventional urinalysis tests, the Hycor test does not have to be sent 
to a clinical laboratory for processing; it can be administered on-site by 
untrained personnel. Jones said the results are as accurate as traditional drug 
screening methods, though more sophisticated confirmation tests are still 
necessary in many situations. 
</P>
<P>
Hycor, which sells a variety of human diagnostic products, will not begin to 
market the tests until at least four of the five have been approved, Jones 
said. He expects that to happen by July. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the products will be targeted at the drug rehabilitation and parole 
and probation markets for use as a monitoring tool. The tests produce results 
in about 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"It won't be used for pre-employment testing, where someone might be denied a 
job because of it," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
In pre-employment drug screening, results that come up positive must be 
double-checked by laboratory confirmation tests, so there would be little 
advantage for employers to do initial screening on-site. 
</P>
<P>
But private rehabilitation centers, Jones said, are interested in the Hycor 
product as a revenue-generating tool, because they can charge patients for each 
test. Tests will be sold by Hycor for $2 each, with a suggested retail price of 
$3. In most situations, several tests will be used at once to check for 
different drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Jones pegged the potential market among drug rehabilitation and probation and 
parole customers at $65 million, and said Hycor hoped to sell $3.5 million 
worth by next year.

LEIBOVITZ UPSET OVER YANKING OF LENNON PHOTO; 
</P>
<P>
ART: THE PHOTOGRAPHER WHO SHOT THE PICTURE SAYS THE FULLERTON CULTURAL CENTER 
ACTION IS 'A SIGN OF SOMETHING VERY BAD THAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS COUNTRY.' 
</P>

"Disgraceful." 
</P>
<P>
Photographer Annie Leibovitz was reacting to a decision by officials of the 
Muckenthaler Cultural Center in Fullerton to yank her portrait of a nude John 
Lennon and his fully clothed wife, Yoko Ono, from an exhibit there. 
</P>
<P>
The decision is to be reviewed today when the city-owned center's trustees meet 
with their programming committee. Objections from some of the trustees 
triggered the action late last week. 
</P>
<P>
But meanwhile, in a sharply worded statement released Wednesday through her 
studio in New York, Leibovitz referred to the removal of the portrait as "a 
sign of something very bad that's happening in this country. The cultural 
atmosphere is becoming more and more conformist and cowardly." 
</P>
<P>
Liebovitz elaborated Wednesday afternoon by telephone, saying she was "taken 
aback" by the Muckenthaler's action. "I thought it was really grotesque," she 
added. "I really thought this was the kind of fight John Lennon would have 
loved. It's a good fight." 
</P>
<P>
Leibovitz's well-known photograph -- which appeared on newsstands around the 
world nearly 10 years ago, on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine -- was to 
have been part of an exhibit entitled "Heroes, Heroines, Idols and Icons." Some 
trustees who previewed the exhibit before it opened Saturday said the Lennon 
photo did not fit in with what they saw as a "positive show on heroism." 
</P>
<P>
Wes Morgan, Fullerton's community services superintendent, maintained that the 
decision had "nothing to do with censorship, nudity, John Lennon or Yoko Ono." 
</P>
<P>
Liebovitz said such reasoning is nonetheless "preposterous" and asserted that 
the same kind of argument was used "for implementing government censorship in 
the Soviet Union in the Stalin era. It has a name: the Doctrine of the Positive 
Hero. Music and art were condemned because the function of the art did not show 
the positive hero." 
</P>
<P>
The photo was taken Dec. 8, 1980 -- just hours before Lennon was shot to death 
outside his New York City apartment. It shows him in a fetal position, 
embracing a reclining Ono. His buttocks are visible in profile. The photograph 
raised some controversy when it ran on the cover of the Jan. 22, 1981, edition 
of Rolling Stone, and several Southern California supermarket chains refused to 
carry it. 
</P>
<P>
In the magazine, Leibovitz wrote: "I promised John that this would be the 
cover. I shot some test Polaroids first. . . . John said, 'You've captured our 
relationship exactly.' " 
</P>
<P>
"This is a photograph that shows affection and tenderness," Leibovitz said in 
the statement released Wednesday. "It's a good picture. It's a picture that 
tells the truth. It should be in the show." 
</P>
<P>
"When I was asked to pick a couple of photographs (for the exhibit), it was the 
first one I thought of," Leibovitz added by phone. "The photograph shows (that) 
he was never afraid to show how human he was."

SUPERVISORS TO VOTE ON COUNTY ARTS AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Orange County Board of Supervisors is scheduled to vote Tuesday on whether 
to develop a countywide arts agency, according to an aide to Supervisor Thomas 
F. Riley. 
</P>
<P>
If created, the agency might further be designated by the supervisors as the 
county's "state-local partner" with the California Arts Council, or official 
arts representative to the state. Meanwhile, the supervisors are considering 
whether to give that designation temporarily to an ad hoc committee of local 
arts leaders. 
</P>
<P>
As a "state-local partner," an agency can receive state and federal grants for 
redistribution to local arts groups. The county has been without such a partner 
since the Orange County Arts Alliance dissolved in 1988 and is now one of six 
counties (among 58 statewide) without a partnership. According to one estimate, 
Orange County is losing out on as much as $30,000 in state arts money every 
year as a result. 
</P>
<P>
Riley placed the vote on Tuesday's calendar after reading a report that he had 
requested from the county administrative office on the county's role in local 
arts support. 
</P>
<P>
"The report indicates the need for the county to take a leadership and 
coordination role to bring together public and private efforts to establish a 
countywide (arts) program," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed agency would be developed with cooperation from the CAO, the 
Environmental Management Agency, the Department of Education, the Orange County 
Public Library and the League of Cities and would be funded with up to $50,000 
in special district augmentation money normally used for county parks. A 
structural and funding plan would be submitted to the supervisors during their 
1990-91 budget hearings, to begin in July. 
</P>
<P>
Other potential funding sources -- such as an endowment fund, grants, 
membership dues and private contributions -- are to be considered as well. 
Riley recommends that the county contribute no more than the $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
"If this agency is to truly benefit the entire county of Orange, it should 
probably represent funding sources other than just the county," said Riley aide 
Stephen Blanchard.

POP NOTES: POPULAR GHERKIN RAUCOUS TO PERFORM FAREWELL SHOW TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After two years as one of the most popular draws on the Orange County original 
rock scene, Gherkin Raucous is playing its farewell show Friday night at Foul 
Play in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Drummer Miles Gillett's decision to return to his native New Zealand next month 
is the immediate cause of the breakup, although the other members said that 
musical differences and the band's inability to land a recording deal played a 
role in Gillett's departure and in their own decision not to continue. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, guitarist Warren Fitzgerald, bassist Dan Wallis and singer Darren 
McNamee said, auditions for a new drummer proved fruitless. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been hard to go back to square one," Fitzgerald said, "so we 
decided it would be better to let it lie." 
</P>
<P>
Gherkin's calling card was metallic hard rock delivered with unpredictable, 
often ribald theatrics that made the band something of a heavy metal parody. 
Gillett, who previously had played in El Grupo Sexo, wasn't always happy with 
the unruly performing approach of front men Fitzgerald and McNamee. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald said that "things started falling apart" for Gherkin after the band 
had an unsuccessful recording audition for Sire Records last year. Plans to 
regroup from that setback by releasing an album on an independent label fell 
through as instability set in. 
</P>
<P>
Wallis is playing bass now in local rock band Twisto Frumpkin. Fitzgerald will 
continue performing and recording with the Vandals, the long-running punk rock 
band, but he said he is also thinking about starting a new band or joining an 
established hard rock act. McNamee said his next step will be an acoustic rock 
project with a revolving crew of side players. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to make a big production" out of Gherkin Raucous' finale at Foul 
Play, McNamee said. "We're going to have a big ceremony: bye bye to Miles." 
</P>
<P>
KZLA radio (93.9 FM), one of the two country stations accessible to Orange 
County listeners, has added "Lift Your Leg" by Costa Mesa-based Chris Gaffney 
&amp; the Cold Hard Facts to its regular airplay rotation. 
</P>
<P>
What's encouraging about that development -- besides the fact that the song is 
good -- is that it's a case of a radio programmer following his own instincts, 
instead of kowtowing to the mass-marketing surveys and major record company 
promotional pressure that typically drive commercial radio nowadays (Gaffney is 
a virtual unknown who records for ROM, a tiny Los Angeles-based label with 
little, if any, clout to land a song on a major station). 
</P>
<P>
KZLA's operations manager, Bob Guerra, said he made a point of listening to 
Gaffney's "Lift Your Leg" single after reading favorable reviews of the 
singer-accordionist's recent album, "Chris Gaffney &amp; the Cold Hard Facts." 
</P>
<P>
"It knocked me out," Guerra said. "I decided there's no reason in the world we 
shouldn't be playing it. It's great to see these local artists do so well." 
</P>
<P>
Upcoming shows added to the Coach House schedule in San Juan Capistrano include 
Michelle Shocked and John Wesley Harding on May 29 and Todd Rundgren and his 
band on June 23, 25 and 26. Leo Kottke's upcoming Coach House date has been 
shifted from May 27 to May 31. MIKE BOEHM

POP BEAT: SIBERRY COMES DOWN TO EARTH IN 'BOUND BY BEAUTY'; 
</P>
<P>
IN HER LATEST EFFORT, SHE TRADES HER ARTSY, SPRAWLING SONG-SUITES FOR 
SIMPLIFIED FOLK-POP MATERIAL. 'I FELT THE NEED TO BE STRAIGHTFORWARD,' SHE 
SAYS. SHE PLAYS TONIGHT AT THE COACH HOUSE IN SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Back to basics is Jane Siberry's theme these days -- and that marks quite a 
turnabout for a singer who has been among the most artsy of pop performers. 
</P>
<P>
On her first three U.S. releases, Canadian Siberry was prone to challenging 
listeners with sprawling song-suites full of symbolic lyrics, abstract dialogue 
and hard-to-figure shifts of perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Siberry -- who plays tonight at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano -- has 
changed all that on her current album, "Bound by the Beauty." The music is 
direct, often rooted in folk-pop. The songs hew more closely to conventional 
forms, and the lyrics hold fewer puzzles. 
</P>
<P>
Gone are the stacked layers of voices and the modernistic ambience generated by 
synthesizers and sampling keyboards, an approach that used to prompt 
comparisons with the avant-garde explorations of Laurie Anderson or the baroque 
constructions of Kate Bush. The warm, piano-based arrangements on "Bound by the 
Beauty" are more apt to bring Joni Mitchell to mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted (this album) to be straightforward," Siberry, 34, said over the phone 
from a tour stop last week in Austin, Tex. "I'm sure it was a balancing thing" 
after the complexity and lyrical impressionism of her 1988 album, "The 
Walking." 
</P>
<P>
"I felt the need to be straightforward and be perceived" as straightforward, 
said Siberry, whose conversation, like her singing, oscillated between moments 
of offhanded near-detachment and surges of intensity. "I feel very proud of 
'The Walking,' but I felt uncomfortable about the way I was being perceived. I 
guess (the perception) was that I was obscure, and I was too difficult. I don't 
feel like I am. The last thing I want to be is an elitist performer. I like to 
see myself as an every-person's writer." 
</P>
<P>
So Siberry retreated to the countryside west of her hometown of Toronto and 
went to work in an unlikely setting for a modern recording venture: a studio in 
a Quonset hut in the middle of an apple orchard. 
</P>
<P>
"This studio was perfect," Siberry said. "It was right in keeping with the 
spirit of the record -- very casual. Neighbors who never heard of me before 
would come and watch. It made it just everyday and matter of fact, instead of 
being in a big, corporate studio." 
</P>
<P>
The result was an album that features charming moments of whimsy, a few dark 
chills, and a moving, overriding sense of connection to the simplest, most 
basic thing we all share: the natural, reassuring presence of the earth itself. 
</P>
<P>
On the country-rock flavored "Something About Trains," Siberry is able to 
comfort herself during a melancholy moment with the realization that she is 
part of natural life: 
</P>
<P>
You walk the lonely valley. 
</P>
<P>
 You walk the line alone. 
</P>
<P>
 But this old earth is always there. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't feel so alone. 
</P>
<P>
The album's title song is a rapturous love poem to the physical world, but it 
takes on an edge as Siberry contemplates the possibility that what delights her 
now could one day be ruined. Imagining herself returning to life 500 years 
hence, Siberry proclaims: "These things that I love . . . they'd better be 
here." 
</P>
<P>
She almost bristled, though, at the suggestion that "Bound by the Beauty" might 
be seen as an intent to stir ecological concern. 
</P>
<P>
"Definitely not," she said. "I don't even like to hear you say that." 
</P>
<P>
To Siberry, the album looks intimately at her own response to nature, not 
outward to the politics of the environmental movement. Clearly, she does not 
want to appear to be jumping on the latest bandwagon for pop cause-seekers. 
</P>
<P>
The album, she said, "is a reflection of somebody who has a great respect for 
natural beauty. The one thing that has kept me attuned to my love of life is 
natural beauty." If the songs relate to the concerns of the environmental 
movement, she said, it is only "as an aside." 
</P>
<P>
"It's because of the times today that you could see it as an ecological record, 
but that's a crude label. It's inaccurate," she said. "These songs could have 
been written 20 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Along with her appreciation of nature, Siberry sprinkled "Bound by the Beauty" 
with other down-to-earth songs. There are warm reflections on romantic love 
(the pretty, affirmative hymn "The Life Is the Red Wagon" and the swooning 
Caribbean fling "Are We Dancing Now?") as well as whimsical tunes like 
"Hockey," with its childhood memories of frozen ponds, and "Everything Reminds 
Me of My Dog," which should find a spot in any canine-lover's heart (in 
Siberry's case, everything reminds her of a part-husky named Wolfgang). 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with material that is more direct, Siberry has simplified her stage 
presentation. Gone are the backing singer-dancers and full band that she used 
in the past to reproduce, and sometimes play-act, her more elaborate songs. 
Instead, she is accompanied only by her longtime guitarist, Ken Myhr, and Teddy 
Borowiecki, who plays piano and accordion. 
</P>
<P>
"I just had such a strong gut feeling about working as a trio," Siberry said. 
"People get a sense of who I am. It's more intimate." 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Siberry and Scott Merritt (see accompanying review) play tonight at 8 at 
the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $15.

NON-RESIDENTIAL BUILDING FUTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Non-residential building is showing early signs of a bullish year. In January 
the total value of non-residential building permits issued in the county was 
$146.5 million, a 60% increase over January, 1989. San Bernardino and San Diego 
counties also showed gains from 1989, though much smaller on a percentage 
basis. Los Angeles and Riverside counties lagged behind their 1989 pace. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County led the five-county area in the value of permits issued for 
hotels/motels, industrial buildings and, despite a glut of space, new office 
buildings. Valuations for stores/mercantile buildings and for 
alterations/additions were lower than January, 1989. Orange County's numbers in 
January are at least somewhat remarkable in that in January, 1989, Los Angeles 
County, as is normal, dominated all five building categories as well as overall 
valuations.

"We call ourselves social carnivores," says Donna Knoy of Mission Viejo as she 
stands among the displays of organic produce at The Natural Grocer in Laguna 
Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband still likes red meat occasionally, but most of the time we eat 
primarily vegetables, grains, nuts, fruits," she says of her family of four, 
which includes a 4-year-old daughter and a 12-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
"I would much rather have vegetables than meat. It takes 13 pounds of grain to 
make one pound of meat and I'm ethically against that," she says. 
</P>
<P>
She admits that some of the organic produce costs more than commercial produce, 
but she thinks it's worth it because it's grown without pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
Knoy isn't alone. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of other people in Orange County are worried about what most Americans 
are eating. They are worried about the thousands of pesticides and chemicals 
that are used on vegetables, fruits and grains. They are worried about how far 
removed from its natural state much of our diet has become. 
</P>
<P>
They are worried about our planet and how we can continue to feed its 
burgeoning population. And they are worried about what some perceive as cruelty 
to animals in our food chain. 
</P>
<P>
These concerns have created a growing demand for food that is as close as 
possible to its natural state. And this demand has given birth to a new kind of 
grocery store in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The Natural Grocer as well as Mother's Market and Kitchen in Costa Mesa and 
Huntington Beach are among a number of grocery stores in Southern California 
that specialize in organic and non-processed foods, with a heavy emphasis on 
vegetarian diets. In Los Angeles County, for example, Mrs. Gooch's Natural 
Foods has seven stores. 
</P>
<P>
Many health food stores carry some organic foods, and even a few supermarkets, 
including Pavilions and Mayfair markets, carry a small amount of organic 
produce. But The Natural Grocer, Mother's Market and Mrs. Gooch's represent a 
whole new idea -- a full-service grocery store devoted to a lifestyle that 
centers on healthy eating. 
</P>
<P>
Mother's was started 13 years ago so that shoppers would have "access to 
high-quality whole foods without having to go to the old-style mom and pop 
health food stores, which were primarily vitamin shops," says Steven Markell, 
vice president of operations for the market. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach store opened five years ago. Each location includes a 
restaurant, a health food delicatessen, a large selection of health-related 
books and a cosmetic counter. 
</P>
<P>
"When we started, the store was one-quarter the size that it currently is," 
Markell says of the 11,000-square-foot Costa Mesa store. "The fact of our 
success demonstrates an increased concern and awareness on the part of our 
Orange County community of the importance of whole, clean foods." 
</P>
<P>
By whole, clean foods, Markell means organic fruits and vegetables grown 
without chemicals and pesticides, and minimally processed and packaged foods 
that lack additives such as preservatives and artificial flavors and colors, 
that are low in fat and salt, that have little or no sugar, and are minimally 
processed. 
</P>
<P>
The Natural Grocer opened in August to serve the needs of South County health 
food enthusiasts, according to store manager Vickie Stern. 
</P>
<P>
"We're more like a natural foods grocery store" than a health food store, Stern 
says. "We're a full-service grocery store. We not only have all our natural 
foods you would find in a health food store, but we've got a very large produce 
department, which most health food stores don't have. We have a beautiful 
cosmetic counter. . . . We have a jewelry and crystal gallery and we have a 
full-service deli and bakery with a lot of gourmet vegetarian items." 
</P>
<P>
The Natural Grocer carries no meat because it is a completely vegetarian store, 
according to Stern. Mother's Market, however, carries "free-range" chickens and 
turkeys -- poultry allowed to roam free rather than being raised in cages. 
</P>
<P>
Markell says these items are offered because "there is a demand for it and we 
try to be as conscientious as we can." He points out, however, that this 
particular poultry is selected because it is grown without hormones and other 
growth stimulants. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a cruelty-free store," Stern says. "It just means there's no harm 
inflicted on any animals . . . to create any of the products in our store." 
</P>
<P>
In view of the cases of veggie burgers and tofu pups (made from a soybean-based 
product), the large bins of bulk foods and baby food made from organic 
vegetables may seem a bit odd to the unschooled, but shoppers at these markets 
find the bins invaluable. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to feed my family as few artificial chemicals as I can," Susan 
Rousset of Newport Beach said while shopping at Mother's. "I just prefer that 
and also, I like to support the farmers that do want to maintain the earth as 
best they can." 
</P>
<P>
Rousset is experimenting with a macrobiotic diet -- whole grains, beans, 
vegetables and moderate amounts of seafood and fruit. But she still cooks meat 
occasionally for her six children, ranging in age from 4 to 16. She says, 
however, that they are mostly vegetarians too. 
</P>
<P>
This varied approach to vegetarianism is not unusual. There are several schools 
of thought, according to Markell. There are lacto-ovo vegetarians, who eat 
dairy products, eggs, grains, fruits, legumes and vegetables. Then there are 
those who will eat all of those items except eggs or all of those items except 
dairy products. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are vegans, who eat only plant source foods. 
</P>
<P>
And there are people who are not fully vegetarians yet, but want to eat in a 
more healthy manner, according to Markell. 
</P>
<P>
But is vegetarianism really a healthy way to eat? 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing wrong with vegetarianism," says Grant Gwinup, M.D., a 
professor of endocrinology and metabolism at UCI Medical Center. "The only 
studies available suggest that vegetarians live longer than non-vegetarians . . 
. but it's hard to know how other factors contribute to that increased 
longevity." 
</P>
<P>
The main thing vegetarians need to worry about, he says, is the lack of vitamin 
B-12 and iron. Vegetables don't contain B-12, he says, and women run the risk 
of getting too little iron when not eating meat. But this does not mean 
vegetarians should automatically take vitamins and iron supplements, he says. 
As for the iron, he says that can be solved by using an iron Dutch oven when 
cooking vegetable casseroles. 
</P>
<P>
Gwinup says it's a good idea for vegetarians to have their blood checked once a 
year to watch for any anemias that might result from these deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
He says that while vegetarians frequently claim perfect health, "there's no 
magic in it. There's no evidence that it has medicinal properties or protective 
properties." Yet, vegetarians interviewed while they were shopping at Mother's 
and The Natural Grocer say they absolutely have never felt better. 
</P>
<P>
Chef Julie Faust, who supervises the delicatessen at The Natural Grocer, says 
she talks to a lot of newcomers to vegetarianism as well as people who are 
gradually changing the way they eat. She says the clientele in the Laguna 
Niguel store is different from that of most health food stores she has worked 
in. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very yuppie. The people here are just learning how to do things without 
meat," she says. That's why she calls the fare in her delicatessen "a yup-scale 
version of health food. . . . They go for the lasagna, the pizza, the spinach 
pies," because it's at least familiar, she says. 
</P>
<P>
Her goal is to provide the same taste and flavor found in gourmet restaurants, 
but without the fat and meat. This means low-fat pizza and dishes like Santa Fe 
Lasagna, which has noodles, black beans, chopped chilies and peppers, corn, 
spicy salsa and either jalapeno cheese or creamy cilantro tofu. 
</P>
<P>
While the delicatessens in the stores do a thriving business, the produce areas 
are also popular. Yet, the produce signs may also seem a bit odd to the 
newcomer. Each item is clearly labeled either organic, transitional or 
commercial. 
</P>
<P>
To be classified as organic, fruits and vegetables are grown in accordance with 
the California Health and Safety Code, Section 26569.11, according to Jaime 
Arteaga assistant information officer of the California Department of Health 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
This means perennial crops and their soil must be free of synthetically 
compounded fertilizers, growth regulators and pesticides for a year before the 
appearance of buds on the crop and throughout the entire growing season. Annual 
and two-year crops and their soil must be free of the same substances for 12 
months before seed planting and throughout the growing and harvest season. 
</P>
<P>
Transitional produce is currently being grown without pesticides, but in soil 
that has not been free of chemicals long enough to qualify as organic. 
Commercial produce is what you find in most grocery stores. Mother's and The 
Natural Grocer carry some commercial produce to offer a wider variety of items, 
because sometimes the selection of organic produce is too limited. 
</P>
<P>
Gwinup says, however, that there are really no such things as organic or 
natural foods. "What it should be is pesticide-free or pesticide-low. . . . And 
even that's very dicey because if you go some place that sells so-called 
pesticide-free food and you analyze it for pesticides, it's going to have some. 
There's nothing in the world that doesn't have a speck of pesticide." 
</P>
<P>
He says that even pesticide-free fields sometimes suffer from over-spray from a 
neighboring farm using pesticides, because the chemicals can be carried in the 
wind. 
</P>
<P>
"With today's level of technical ability to analyze ingredients of foods, we 
can get parts per billion, parts per trillion," Markell agrees. 
</P>
<P>
But, he says, that's missing the point. He says that "toxic load" is the real 
concern. "The whole thing is not about being chemical-free in our lives, but 
reducing our exposure every little bit we can." 
</P>
<P>
Markell says one argument goes that pesticides have never been proven to be 
harmful, but that it's also true that they've never been proven to be safe. "So 
what's true is it's a crap shoot and we really don't know what the long-term 
cumulative effects are." 
</P>
<P>
But, he says, we do know that cancer, birth defects and other health problems 
may be increasing in the population as a whole. "And the question is why?" he 
says. "The answer is complicated, but includes many factors of which this issue 
is one."

DRESSING UP FOR DRESSAGE

Who says black-tie has to be stuffy? 
</P>
<P>
Friends of the Fran Joswick Therapeutic Riding Center held a decidedly 
unpretentious dress-up party Saturday at Magic Island in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Trading boots and breeches for tuxes and gowns, 164 local equestrians and 
riding center supporters paid $135 each for dinner and a magic show at the 
former private club, raising about $16,000 for the San Juan Capistrano stable. 
</P>
<P>
Lest appearances deceive (as they probably should in a magicians' lair), 
chairwoman Sonja Solberg dropped this pearl on her spiffed-up guests after 
dinner: 
</P>
<P>
"They asked me to say something brief and dignified," said Solberg, pacing the 
"Garden of Isis" room's stage. "All I can think of is how totally thrilled I am 
that this strapless dress hasn't fallen down." 
</P>
<P>
And then this: 
</P>
<P>
"You know, when we told people about (the party), they said, 'Why black-tie?' 
'Why black-tie?' And it seemed like all the people who said that were men," 
Solberg said. "I'm standing here in high heels, control-top panty hose and a 
strapless dress wondering what all you men are complaining about!" 
</P>
<P>
The benefit was the first fund-raising effort of the newly formed Kismet 
Women's Auxiliary, which is also headed by Solberg, a horse trainer and 
longtime supporter of the Joswick center. In operation for 10 years, the 
nonprofit center provides weekly horseback riding lessons for disabled children 
and adults. 
</P>
<P>
Before dinner, guests ordered drinks in the club's bar, browsed silent-auction 
tables in the Egyptian-themed Cleopatra's Chamber and strolled the dark-green 
halls decorated with posters and props. (Props on display included such neatly 
labeled mysteries as a "talking skull," a "finger-chopper," a 
"water-to-confetti" cup and an "ink-to-goldfish" bowl.) 
</P>
<P>
Center Director Cheryl Shou, hobbled by torn ligaments, sat out the cocktail 
hour in the dining room with some of her students and volunteers. How would she 
like to spend the party proceeds? 
</P>
<P>
"There's so much we need, it's hard to know where to start," Shou said, 
grinning. 
</P>
<P>
Shou reeled off a "wish list" -- new tack, new therapeutic equipment, more 
staff members, more horses. The top priority, she said, was the scholarship 
fund, which underwrites the cost of lessons for almost half of the center's 86 
riders. 
</P>
<P>
Also attending were Judy Fluor-Runels and Dick Runels, Dudley Wright, Linda 
Gaede, Cecilia Presley, Vickie Wright and Robert Hank, Maxine Arnold, Charlie 
Calborn, Brenda Skinner, Penny Fosheim and Diana La Mott. 
</P>
<P>
A Little Touch of Vegas: Comedians Gary Mule Deer and Valery Pappas and singer 
Deborah Williams entertained guests Thursday at a fund-raiser for Human 
Options, a Laguna Beach shelter for battered women and their children. 
</P>
<P>
The Vegas-style variety show -- produced by Beverly Hills talent agent Jeffrey 
Patterson -- topped off a $125-per-ticket evening that drew 368 guests to the 
Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach and raised about $70,000, according to 
event chairwoman Janet Corbin. 
</P>
<P>
"We are so thrilled I can't even find the words to tell you," Corbin said. 
</P>
<P>
Among those in demand at cocktail hour was Vivian Clecak, executive director of 
the 8-year-old shelter. Stepping back from the clamoring crowd, she said the 
money raised through ticket sales, silent and live auctions and other donations 
would be used "basically for survival." 
</P>
<P>
"It costs a lot just to keep us going," Clecak said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides running the 18-bed shelter, Human Options operates a 
crisis-intervention hot line -- which received 14,000 calls from county women 
last year -- a family counseling center, children's services and a domestic 
violence prevention program conducted at schools. 
</P>
<P>
Program Director Jan Tyler linked arms with Katherine Nemeth, a counselor at 
the shelter -- who had showed up seven years ago as a client. 
</P>
<P>
"Katherine brings a whole other kind of sensitivity (to the job) that some of 
the other staff doesn't have," Tyler said. 
</P>
<P>
Nemeth shyly admitted that "most of what I use when I'm counseling comes from 
my experience." After 47 days at the shelter and a split with her abusive 
husband, Nemeth got a master's degree in counseling psychology. 
</P>
<P>
"That helps (me) keep some distance," she said, "but there's some things . . . 
they can't teach you in school." 
</P>
<P>
Guests heard a chilling litany of domestic violence statistics before dinner: 
Every 17 seconds a woman is battered in the United States; 40% of female 
homicide victims are killed by their husbands or boyfriends, and an estimated 
50% of domestic violence goes unreported. 
</P>
<P>
One shelter client recounted on tape: "It started with a slap, then a beating 
with an open hand, then fists, then kicking." 
</P>
<P>
The benefit was the joint effort of the shelter's three support groups, which 
have a total of nearly 200 members. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Tierney was honorary chairwoman. Event committee members included 
Marcia Cashion, Ann Lusk, Betty Andrews, Mary Catherine Payne, Julie 
Brinkerhoff, Harriett Cox, Betty Kemp, Pat McFarland, Mary Anna Severson and 
Barbara Brinkerhoff.

INNOVATION: TIME TO CONSIDER REINVENTING THE LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pop Quiz/Short Essay (50 points): Which individual has had the greatest 
positive impact on the quality of American education in this century? 
</P>
<P>
John Dewey? The sentimental choice but not a contender. Columbia University's 
Nicholas Murray Butler, Harvard University's James Bryant Conant or the 
University of Chicago's Robert Hutchins? Giants of their time, for sure, but 
their influence today is but a nostalgic echo. Joan Ganz Cooney of "Sesame 
Street"? Maybe Captain Kangaroo? Just kidding. 
</P>
<P>
No, the person who unquestionably did the most for hungry young minds was 
Andrew Carnegie -- a man who intuitively understood that even the most powerful 
ideas needed affordable housing. By the time the Roaring '20s kicked in, the 
steel baron had shelled out more than $56 million (real money now, unbelievable 
largess then) to build more than 2,500 free libraries. As canny as 
philanthropists come, Carnegie didn't just invest in ideas and imagery -- he 
built an enduring infrastructure. His libraries did at least as much for 
stimulating literacy as the schools. Carnegie literally birthed a new public 
medium for knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
When this immigrant Scot was asked in 1900 why on earth he gave his wealth to 
launch libraries, of all things, when there were so many other problems in 
America, he replied: "I choose free libraries as the best agencies for 
improving the masses of the people because they give nothing for nothing. They 
only help those who help themselves. They never pauperize. They reach the 
aspiring and open to these chief treasures of the world -- those stored up in 
books. A taste for reading drives out lower tastes." 
</P>
<P>
Good stuff. Ask around and you'll be astonished by the number and variety of 
people whose lives were touched by a Carnegie library. When Americans talk 
about books that changed their lives, the chances are those books were part of 
Carnegie's legacy. 
</P>
<P>
Today, we're surrounded by new media and beset by declining literacy. People 
talk about shoring up the schools and "getting back to basics." That's all 
wonderful, but it's far from enough. We need new infrastructures to house ideas 
and capture imaginations. We need to do at the end of this century what 
Carnegie did at its beginning -- build a powerfully accessible knowledge 
medium. We need an Andrew Carnegie for the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
"The problems never change," says Michael Hawley, a friend who is snagging his 
Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Lab. "You always 
need some new form of technology to pump the information into the communities." 
</P>
<P>
Hawley champions the concept of "digital libraries" -- the notion of putting 
the world's greatest words on compact disc platters. "You figure a book is a 
megabyte (of data)," Hawley calculates, "and a CD can hold 550 megabytes -- 200 
CDs could hold a nice-sized library." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, take the printed word, digitize it and slap it on to a new 
medium -- a medium that can allow instantaneous access via computer; a medium 
that would let people play with text in the same way that videocassette 
recorders and camcorders let people play with imagery. Create a resource -- a 
digital mine -- with information that can be excavated, refined, processed, 
linked and fused in intriguing ways. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't intellectual skywriting. As one of Steve Jobs' hotshots at Next 
Inc., Hawley designed and wrote the software for the Next machine's "digital 
books" -- which include the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, the Oxford Dictionary 
of Quotations and the complete works of Shakespeare. Searching through and 
reading digitized text isn't like searching through and reading the paper-based 
word -- it's a radically different experience, almost fragmentary and 
collage-like. But it makes you think differently and it lets you explore, graze 
and wander through vast landscapes of text with the tap of a key. 
</P>
<P>
Picture a digitized Library of Congress. One staffer there estimates that it 
could take 40 years to digitize its collection of 19 million books (figuring 
2,000 characters per page per book) yielding more than 14.6 trillion bytes of 
data. What's more, the library's collection grows by more than 270 billion 
bytes of data each year. Copyright questions aside, just imagine what kind of 
information infrastructure that would be. It's the sort of infrastructure that 
is truly Carnegie-esque in magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
Other information architects have a different perspective on Carnegie's legacy. 
"The idea of digital books is just the wrong idea," asserts John Seely Brown, 
who runs Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center. "It misses the point -- just being 
able to quickly get at a lot of books doesn't necessarily change the way you 
think; you could end up with the digital equivalents of sound bites." 
</P>
<P>
The real issue, says Brown, is "how do you jog people's imagination about 
reading between the lines?" 
</P>
<P>
Instead of digitized libraries, Brown envisions the community library of 2010 
as "a center of design -- the design of music, the design of books, the design 
of film, the design of information," and he sees these libraries all linked 
together on high-speed, high-bandwidth computer networks that enable people to 
share their ideas. Brown calls these technological webs "collaboratories." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Brown and Hawley aren't all that far apart -- Hawley stresses the raw 
materials of ideas while Brown wants to focus on the tools to refine and add 
value to them. What's important is that people who know technology and care 
about both people and ideas feel that the time is ripe to go Carnegie one 
better. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm interested in every device we can use in diffusing the word," says former 
Librarian of Congress Daniel Boorstin, who has written extensively on the role 
of new media in spreading ideas. "But I believe in the conventional book as 
well as the new technology. We should not abandon the traditional format; we 
should complement books and not displace them." 
</P>
<P>
The issue, of course, isn't making the book obsolete. On the contrary, it's 
doing what Carnegie did: giving the word a new medium, a new home and a 
different degree of accessibility to the public. When you sit down and run the 
numbers, says MIT's Hawley, Carnegie spent about $1 billion in 1990 currency to 
create more than 2,500 new communities of knowledge. Shouldn't the aspiring 
philanthropists of today take that as a challenge? Isn't this the kind of 
investment in the future that a Walter Annenberg, an H. Ross Perot, a Donald J. 
Trump and a John Kluge should consider? 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, our government doesn't have the wit or the money to build for 
this future. Indeed, too many of our traditional libraries have begun to decay. 
The sad truth is that we're sinking deeper and deeper into swamps of 
information that become even more and more difficult to access. What's even 
sadder is that this society and its philanthropists lack the vision and the 
will to take advantage of the resources and opportunities it has to change 
that.

'STAR WARS' R&amp;D CREATES ULTRA-FAST, TINY COMPUTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Researchers at Rockwell International and Texas Instruments working on the 
"Star Wars" defense program have developed ultra-high-speed computers the size 
of a deck of cards that they say could have far-reaching commercial 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
Besides representing an important advance in Star Wars research, the small 
machines -- about 500 times faster than the average personal computer -- could 
spark a new generation of small but powerful computers for consumers, industry 
watchers said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Star Wars critics, however, said the breakthrough does not justify the 
multibillion-dollar program, formally known as the Strategic Defense 
Initiative, and the potential commercial applications are not justification 
enough for continuing spending on the program. 
</P>
<P>
Administration funding requests for the controversial SDI program have grown 
from $1 billion in fiscal 1984 to $4.6 billion in 1990, but Congress has shown 
an increasing willingness to shave the SDI budget and divert funds to more 
popular programs. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell's Autonetics Sensors &amp; Aircraft Systems division in Anaheim and 
Texas Instruments, based in Dallas, designed different versions of the computer 
under an Air Force contract. A commercial version could be available to 
consumers in several years, Air Force officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"These designs will one day make every home computer in the country outdated," 
said John Provine, chief of the guided interceptor technology branch of the Air 
Force Armament Laboratory at Eglin Air Force Base, Fla. "I can see a day when, 
if a person buys a home computer, it will be either very compact or have 
nothing but an empty box for looks." 
</P>
<P>
The so-called floating-point computers were designed for a Star Wars program 
with the aim of developing a processor to track flying objects against the 
Earth's background and identifying them either as decoys or enemy missiles. 
</P>
<P>
To fulfill its mission, the computers must be small enough to fit inside a 
space-based satellite and fast enough to track thousands of missiles 
simultaneously and direct a weapon to destroy them. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the heart of the SDI system," said Provine. "It's clear evidence the 
space-based interceptor isn't just pie-in-the sky." 
</P>
<P>
The Rockwell and TI computers are part of a proposed $17.7-billion strategic 
defense system known as a space-based interceptor, which would house 
missile-killers in 200 satellite platforms, said Baker Spring, a defense 
analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based think tank known for its 
pro-Star Wars stance. Rockwell and Martin Marietta Corp. are the prime 
contractors on the project. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Chapman, an SDI critic and executive director of Computer Professionals 
for Social Responsibility in Palo Alto, said the Rockwell-Texas Instruments 
computer is by no means a major technical breakthrough toward developing a 
space defense system. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic problem of SDI is developing trustworthy software, not building a 
fast computer," he said. "There's not enough information to write adequate 
software specifications for a nuclear war, and you can't test the system." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Bernstein, assistant director of the Stanford Center for International 
Security and Arms Control, said the computers would likely have commercial 
applications, but that is no reason to continue developing the Star Wars 
system. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force's Provine said development of the computers cost about $5 
million. The project incorporates little in the way of new technology but 
rather takes existing technology and greatly shrinks it in size. 
</P>
<P>
Provine said the computers developed by Rockwell and Texas Instruments could 
have vast commercial applications, but he noted that they may never be used in 
a Star Wars system, even if the costly anti-missile program is eventually 
built. 
</P>
<P>
In February, the Pentagon's Strategic Defense Initiative Organization gave 
priority to a competing system, known as "Brilliant Pebbles," which is cheaper 
at $12 billion and would deploy thousands of small missile interceptors more 
effectively, Spring said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Texas Instruments said it is looking into commercial applications 
for the computer, though the company declines to discuss potential uses. "Much 
of the development is out of the way," said Leland Langston, a Texas 
Instruments project manager, "and we think the first commercial applications 
could appear within two years." 
</P>

Chris Willard, an analyst with Dataquest, a San Jose market research firm, said 
that because of the computer's speed and small size, it could find applications 
in specialized areas such as robotics. He said he doubts the computers would 
find a use as general-purpose machines. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends a lot on the price and the ultimate system," he said. "The memory 
would have to be more developed in commercial applications. It could have 
applications in industrial controls, robotics and sensors, but for 
general-computing purposes it would require modifications." 
</P>
<P>
Provine said he envisioned the computers being used in applications such as 
Star Trek-style communicators or in robots.

The Rockwell unit, which employs 1,100 people, designed one version of the 
computer as part of a 30-month SDI contract awarded in November, 1988, said 
Tony Longo, spokesman for Rockwell. Longo declined to comment on Rockwell's 
participation in the computer's development.

Each computer weighs 75 grams, or about 2.5 ounces, is 10 centimeters by 1 
centimeter and is capable of up to 500 million instructions per second.

"This is the fastest computer ever built in this small a package," Langston 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Current state-of-the-art computers in some missiles weigh 500 grams, or 17.5 
ounces, with a capacity of 4.5 million instructions per second.

TIME, VIACOM NEAR ACCORD TO MERGE 2 COMEDY CHANNELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Time Warner Inc. and Viacom Inc. have reached a rough agreement to merge their 
respective cable television comedy networks, executives familiar with the 
negotiations said late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an agreement in principle, but there are still some minor details to 
work out," said an executive close to the negotiations. However, the executive 
said an announcement could still be a week away. 
</P>
<P>
Time Warner and Viacom have been holding discussions for several months about 
merging their fledgling cable comedy channels, both of which are struggling to 
attract subscribers and advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
Time Warner launched the Comedy Channel last November to a subscriber base of 6 
million homes, and Viacom premiered Ha! on April 1 with only 4 million 
subscribers. Executives at both companies remain convinced that there is a 
demand for an all-comedy cable channel, but system operators who carry the 
services do not believe there is room for two competing services. 
</P>
<P>
According to executives close to the negotiations, the combined comedy channel 
would be managed by a board composed of representatives from Time Warner, 
Viacom and any cable system operators who may become equity partners in the 
combined service. Time Warner and Viacom would be equal shareholders, while the 
cable operators collectively would own less than a one-third stake. 
</P>
<P>
"We are pretty comfortable at this point," said one executive. "We believe some 
of the cable companies will come in for a piece of the equity." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Time Warner threatened to sue five of the country's largest 
cable operators that were negotiating to buy an equity stake in Ha!, which is 
operated by Viacom's MTV Networks division. The cable operators included 
Tele-Communications Inc., Comcast Corp., Continental Cablevision, Newhouse 
Broadcasting and Cox Cable. The deal would have boosted the channel's 
subscriber base to 20 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
Time Warner feared that any such deal would lock out the Comedy Channel from 
systems owned by those operators, and the company threatened to sue on 
antitrust grounds. The threat was apparently taken seriously enough that 
negotiations were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
But a rough start for both comedy networks and limited channel space on cable 
television systems has forced Time Warner and Viacom back to the negotiating 
table. 
</P>
<P>
Viacom, although it launched Ha! with fewer subscribers than the Comedy 
Channel's, has one important bargaining chip: a $2.5-billion antitrust lawsuit 
that it filed against Time Warner's HBO last year, alleging that HBO 
monopolizes the pay television business. Industry analysts have speculated that 
Viacom would drop its lawsuit as part of any merger deal, but a Viacom 
executive Wednesday evening denied that there was any link between the lawsuit 
and the proposed comedy channel merger. 
</P>
<P>
"The two are separate issues," the executive maintained. Viacom Chairman Sumner 
M. Redstone has been taking a hard line on the lawsuit, insisting that it not 
be linked to any deal to merge the comedy networks.

MILKEN MAY AID IN PROBES OF LINCOLN, OTHER THRIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal investigators looking into fraud at several of the largest failed 
savings and loans are hoping for a boost once Michael Milken begins sharing 
information with the government, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission in particular is conducting an intensive 
investigation of whether Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn. of Irvine and 
CenTrust Savings Bank of Miami, among others, may have participated in a "daisy 
chain" of securities trades among themselves that created phony capital for the 
thrifts and funneled profits to Drexel Burnham Lambert. Investigators also are 
interested in hearing from Milken about his close relationship with Beverly 
Hills-based Columbia Savings &amp; Loan, once one of Drexel's biggest junk bond 
customers and now in deep financial trouble, according to individuals familiar 
with the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
In pleading guilty to six felony counts Tuesday, Milken agreed to cooperate 
fully with federal investigators. Richard C. Breeden, the Securities and 
Exchange Commission chairman, has made it known that he is especially eager for 
Milken to cooperate in the ongoing savings and loan probe. Such cooperation, 
however, is still months away, since a provision in his plea agreement 
specifies that Milken won't begin giving information to prosecutors until he is 
sentenced Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony before a House subcommittee Wednesday, Breeden said he finds it 
"inconceivable" that Milken won't live up to his promise to cooperate. An SEC 
spokeswoman said: "What we expect out of Milken is total cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
Investigating securities fraud at savings and loans is such a high priority at 
the SEC that the agency has established a special task force to look into it. 
When fully staffed, it will employ 25 lawyers and investigators full time. 
Several grand jury investigations also are looking into the possibility of 
criminal violations by thrifts that invested heavily in junk bonds, and more 
are expected. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC already has received information from other former Drexel employees 
about the firm's relations with savings and loans. James Dahl, a former top 
junk bond salesman at Drexel, is expected to spend much of next week talking to 
SEC investigators on that subject. Dahl, granted immunity from prosecution, has 
been cooperating with federal investigators for some time. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Goldstein, the head of the task force, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
One source with knowledge of the SEC investigation said the agency's 
enforcement lawyers will be "wanting to know (from Milken) whether there was, 
in fact, a daisy chain among savings and loans where they sold bonds back and 
forth for the benefit of Drexel or Michael (Milken) or for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
In general, investigators are looking into whether there was a scheme to make 
Lincoln's financial position look better than it actually was through a series 
of transactions with Drexel and other Drexel customers. 
</P>
<P>
For example, investigators for some time have been looking into a strange 
pattern of trading in restricted stock of two companies, Playtex and Memorex. 
Such stock wasn't registered for trading on the open market, and Drexel 
essentially made the only market for the restricted securities. Some of the 
Playtex stock was purchased from Drexel by Lincoln, then sold to Lincoln's 
parent company, American Continental Corp., and then resold to CenTrust. 
CenTrust, in turn, later sold the stock back to American Continental. At each 
sale along the way, the price of the stock shot up significantly, enabling the 
seller to book a hefty profit. 
</P>
<P>
Similar transactions took place involving Memorex stock. 
</P>
<P>
But since there was no real public market for the stock, investigators want to 
know if the price was deliberately inflated so the sellers could use the paper 
profits to bolster their sagging balance sheets. A congressional investigator 
said federal officials want to know "how Drexel set the price for these 
off-market securities." 
</P>
<P>
Charles H. Keating, head of American Continental, couldn't immediately be 
reached for comment Wednesday. But Keating and officials who were at CenTrust 
at the time of the transactions have strongly denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said SEC investigators and prosecutors also want to know whether Milken 
and Drexel provided any improper inducements personally to officers or 
directors of savings institutions to get them to buy certain issues of junk 
bonds. And investigators are said to be interested in details of any personal 
business dealings that Milken may have had with the principals of Columbia 
Savings. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia officials declined to comment on what Milken might tell investigators. 
Charles Yamarone, the thrift's associate general counsel, said: "In light of 
the fact that there are ongoing investigations, Columbia doesn't feel it's 
appropriate to comment." Thomas Spiegel, until recently Columbia's chief 
executive, didn't return a call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Milken declined to comment on what Milken might tell 
investigators about dealings with thrifts.

Breeden Supports Penny Stock Bill: SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden told a House 
panel that he supports the objectives of a bill to curb penny stock fraud but 
fears it may cause as many problems as it solves. Penny stocks are low-cost, 
high-risk securities, usually trading for less than $3 per share. 
</P>
<P>
They are not listed on stock exchanges, and reliable, up-to-the-minute 
information about them is hard to obtain. The Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990, 
introduced earlier this month by Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.), would implement 
several reforms, including requiring that all penny stocks trade through an 
automated stock quote system and beefing up the SEC's power to bar crooked 
promoters and consultants from pushing highly speculative stocks on 
unsophisticated investors.

Norton Agrees to $1.9-Billion Takeover: Norton Co. accepted a friendly 
$1.9-billion merger offer from Compagnie de Saint-Gobain of France, thwarting a 
rival hostile bid from a British conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
The $90-a-share bid by Saint-Gobain, a French maker of fiberglass and 
industrial ceramics, surpasses the $75-a-share tender offer made by BTR PLC of 
Britain. BTR's bid was worth about $1.64 billion. Worcester, Mass.-based Norton 
is a leading manufacturer of machine abrasives.

Security Pacific Dropped Merger Talks: Security Pacific was negotiating in 
January to buy Pacific Western Bancshares, a large San Jose banking firm, but 
talks broke down, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Those sources confirmed that the reason was a fall in the price of Security 
Pacific's stock, which would have been swapped for Pacific Western shares. 
Security Pacific executives have been frustrated in recent months at the 
lackluster performance of the Los Angeles bank's stock because it limits their 
ability to buy other banks through stock swaps. Both banks declined comment.

The St. Louis Sun, which hoped to be the first major metropolitan newspaper to 
make a successful launch in this country since World War II, unexpectedly 
folded Wednesday after only seven months. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Ralph Ingersoll II, editor-in-chief of the new newspaper, 
said the Sun had published its last edition Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"Closing the Sun was a decision the St. Louis marketplace made for us," said 
Ingersoll. Since launching the paper Sept. 25, 1989, the newspaper had 
published 213 editions. 
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that we could not achieve sufficient circulation to make this 
enterprise viable, and so we have concluded that there is no longer room in St. 
Louis for a third newspaper in addition to our own Suburban Journals and the 
Post-Dispatch." 
</P>
<P>
The Sun had struggled to overcome higher-than-expected costs, revolving-door 
circulation, limited advertising and a murky image.

NOMURA FILES LIBEL SUIT OVER INSIDER TRADING CLAIMS;

ALLEGATIONS THAT IT ENGAGED IN UNETHICAL OR ILLEGAL PRACTICES.

Nomura Securities Co., the world's largest securities brokerage and a symbol of 
Japan's new global financial power, filed suit for libel in a London court 
Wednesday against an American author who alleged that the company has been 
involved in insider trading and other securities violations in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer representing Nomura said the company alleges that it has been defamed 
by Albert J. Alletzhauser, a London-based financier and former stock salesman 
in Tokyo who wrote "The House of Nomura." His British publisher, Bloomsbury 
Publishing Ltd., was also named in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
Published in January, the book relates a number of anecdotes suggesting that 
Nomura engaged in a pattern of activities ordinarily considered unethical or 
illegal -- at least outside Japan's loosely regulated financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
Nomura contends that the book "falsely and maliciously" said the company 
"succumbed to the demands of gangsters," "habitually engages in the practice of 
insider trading," "trained its sales staff to exert psychological pressure on 
vulnerable clients" and revealed "confidential information to politicians in 
the hope and expectation of political favors," according to a draft of the 
plaintiff's suit. 
</P>
<P>
"My clients think they have got a good name and a good reputation now, and they 
want to protect it from this sort of attack," John Turnbull, Nomura's attorney, 
said in a telephone interview from London. "They don't care what it costs to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Alletzhauser was unavailable for comment, but he said earlier in the week that 
he believes he can prove the book's allegations in court, as required by 
Britain's tough libel law. The book is being sold in the United States, and 
Nomura could have sued Alletzhauser there, but Britain's libel laws are more 
favorable to plaintiffs. U.S. law would require Nomura to prove the falsehood 
of any disputed statements. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way they can win this suit is if I get run over by a bus," 
Alletzhauser said. "Even then, they'll probably lose. Until insider trading was 
outlawed in 1989, it was the backbone of the Japanese stock market. For them to 
claim it wasn't is rather outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
Insider trading has been nominally illegal here since the time of the postwar 
U.S. occupation, when Japan modeled its securities laws after those in the 
United States. But the statutes were vague and went unenforced. A year ago, in 
response to public outcry over several cases of particularly blatant trading 
abuses, the law was amended to provide for criminal sanctions, including prison 
terms of up to six months. 
</P>
<P>
Just this week, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police disclosed that they were 
completing an investigation into what may become the first case of insider 
trading ever to be prosecuted in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Police searched the home of a former financial company executive Wednesday for 
evidence linking him to illicit trading in Nisshin Kisen Kaisha Ltd., a 
shipowner whose share price soared on the Tokyo Stock Exchange last June after 
it announced plans for a new stock issue. The suspect allegedly bought 7,000 
shares in the name of an acquaintance before the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged transaction would have been characterized as a clever investment 
until a few years ago, when a public debate began on the need to bring ethical 
standards in the Japanese securities industry into line with those of other 
global financial centers. 
</P>
<P>
Nomura, by far the dominant force in the Tokyo market, is widely believed by 
Japanese to be involved in a range of ethically questionable business 
practices. But evidence of securities violations is extremely difficult to 
gather in Japan because financial authorities have only weak powers to 
investigate, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Alletzhauser said he is considering filing a countersuit against Nomura in New 
York, where the law would give him the power to subpoena documents that he 
contends would incriminate -- or at least embarrass -- Nomura. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be working on behalf of institutional investors with the SEC in pursuing 
securities violations, and I'm not ruling out a class-action suit," he said. 
"Parallels to Drexel Burnham are not as far-fetched as they might seem." 
</P>
<P>
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. was the U.S. brokerage firm where American junk 
bond king Michael Milken operated what prosecutors have called a network of 
financial fraud and deceit. Milken pleaded guilty Tuesday in New York to six 
federal counts of securities and tax violations, agreeing to pay $600 million 
in penalties. He faces up to 28 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Nomura's libel case against Alletzhauser, filed in the Queen's Bench Division 
of the High Court of Justice in London, can be expected to go to trial before a 
jury in about a year, said Turnbull, the brokerage's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
As an example of what Nomura considers defamatory, Turnbull cited a passage in 
which Alletzhauser alleged that Nomura's finance department had been in 
"collusion" with its stock department to increase the share price of Mitsubishi 
Heavy Industries Ltd. in 1986 to win the underwriting of a 100-billion-yen 
convertible bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
"After buying up shares for itself, clients and leading politicians, Nomura had 
the Nomura Research Institute publish a 'strong buy' recommendation on 
Mitsubishi Heavy shares," Alletzhauser wrote. "Then Nomura's almighty stock 
department swung into action. Responsible for selling shares to clients through 
its massive branch network, they urged customers to buy Mitsubishi Heavy." 
</P>
<P>
The share price nearly doubled as a result of the research recommendation and 
retail campaign, he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Turnbull said Alletzhauser's information is wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"The facts are -- and I've researched this myself -- that Nomura was a net 
seller of Mitsubishi Heavy during the period in question, and it was not 
recommending a purchase," he said. "There are lots of specific allegations (in 
the book) that are simply not true."

CLIMBING MORTGAGE RATES HURT EXISTING HOME SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
High prices and rising mortgage rates took a heavy toll on California's already 
sluggish housing market, as sales of existing homes statewide fell 8.8% in 
March from the previous month, a realtors group reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Home sales have been dampened due to affordability constraints," said Chris 
Taylor, manager of economic and market analysis for the California Assn. of 
Realtors, which issued the report. Fewer sales of expensive homes in California 
metropolitan areas also helped dent sales, Taylor added. 
</P>
<P>
Sanford R. Goodkin, a San Diego real estate consultant, said sales also fell 
because "interest rates edged up." The average fixed-rate mortgage on existing 
homes sold in March rose to 10.39% from 10.30% in February, according to the 
Federal Housing Finance Board. 
</P>
<P>
Sales fared somewhat better nationwide. The National Assn. of Realtors said in 
its monthly report that sales of single-family homes totaled 3.40 million in 
March at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, unchanged from February's revised 
resale rate. 
</P>
<P>
Across California, 511,298 existing single-family detached homes were sold last 
month on an annualized basis, down from an annualized rate of 560,663 in 
February. Last month's figure was 18.1% lower than the 624,168 sold in March, 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
The annualized rate, adjusted to account for seasonal factors affecting home 
sales, gauges what would be the total number of homes sold for all of 1990 if 
the pace in March continues. 
</P>
<P>
Sales in the Los Angeles and Orange County regions rose 15.6% and 24.9%, 
respectively, from February's levels, but those figures weren't adjusted to 
account for the normal seasonal pick up in sales between February and March. 
When compared to March, 1989, sales in the Los Angeles and Orange County 
regions dropped 31.2% and 28.7%, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The median price of an existing single-family home in California dipped 0.3% to 
$196,621 in March from $197,184 in February, but rose 1% from the revised 
$194,697 reported in the year-ago month. The median price means that half the 
homes sold for a higher price, while half sold for less. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles region, the median price of a single family home crept up 
0.2% to $210,458 in March from $210,123 in February. In the Orange County 
region, the median price rose 1.1% to $246,002 in March from $243,285 in 
February.

Figures are based on closed escrow sales of single-family detached homes. 
Month-to-month changes may overstate actual changes because of the small size

NO PLANS TO SPLIT UP TELEDYNE, CHIEF SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Teledyne Inc. shareholders Wednesday were promised a "great rebirth" of the 
conglomerate in the 1990s, but management again ruled out dismantling the firm 
to raise stockholder value. 
</P>
<P>
At the company's annual meeting at the Beverly Hilton, Teledyne Chief Executive 
George Roberts used the term "great rebirth" to describe Teledyne's future. But 
asked by a shareholder to elaborate, the 71-year-old Roberts said: "I was 
merely trying to emphasize that this management team has an opportunity to do a 
fine job." 
</P>
<P>
Teledyne stock has been a poor performer in recent years, after soaring for 
most of the 1980s. The Los Angeles-based company, a far-flung collection of 
businesses assembled by Chairman Henry Singleton, has been hurt by weak 
earnings at its defense and electronics subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Teledyne spun off its Unitrin insurance subsidiary to shareholders. 
The move was viewed by some analysts as a sign that the 73-year-old Singleton 
may be ready to break up the company. Many of Teledyne's businesses, in theory 
at least, could be sold for hefty sums. 
</P>
<P>
But after the meeting Wednesday, Singleton said that while Teledyne gets offers 
for some of its divisions "all the time," he has "no desire to sell a 
significant amount of assets." 
</P>
<P>
Singleton said his philosophy of building Teledyne's assets over time is 
intact. "The quick buck is for a different citizen," he said. And shareholders 
with that attitude "ought to buy something else," not Teledyne, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Singleton also said the company is in no hurry to launch another major stock 
buyback program despite the stock's slump. "My feeling is we shouldn't be too 
aggressive until we see how things work," he said, referring to Teledyne's 
status now without Unitrin. 
</P>
<P>
Teledyne stock fell 62.5 cents to $28 on Wednesday, a 52-week low. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, William Rutledge, 48, was named president of the company and a 
director. He had been executive vice president. Roberts remains CEO and was 
named vice chairman as well.

PACIFICARE, MAXICARE BREAK OFF TALKS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A bid by Cypress-based PacifiCare Health Systems Inc., to expand in Southern 
California by acquiring bankrupt Maxicare Health Plans Inc. of Los Angeles ran 
aground Wednesday after negotiations broke off. 
</P>
<P>
In separate statements, both health maintenance organizations confirmed that 
the talks ended abruptly and that no further discussions are contemplated on 
PacifiCare's preliminary offer. 
</P>
<P>
Neither company would disclose details of the offer, which was made public last 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
A merger would have increased PacifiCare's membership to 956,000 by adding 
Maxicare's approximately 320,000 members. More important, it would have boosted 
PacifiCare's already large presence in Southern California.

KNICKS FACE A TOUGH ROAD AGAINST CELTICS; 
</P>
<P>
NBA PLAYOFFS: EVEN RETURN OF OAKLEY MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH TO HELP NEW YORK. BIRD 
IS BACK ON HIS GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having gone from first to third in the Atlantic Division in the last 21 games, 
the New York Knicks might be ready to drop out of sight for good. 
</P>
<P>
When the NBA playoffs open tonight, the Knicks, who spent most of the first 
part of the season looking as if they were among the class of the league, are 
at Boston. That only makes matters look more ominous: New York went 9-17 to 
close the regular season and has lost 24 in a row on the road to the Celtics, a 
streak that dates to 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The only encouraging news for the Knicks (45-37) is that Charles Oakley, a 
force inside, has been activated for the playoffs. But even that excitement has 
to be tempered. X-rays show the broken hand that forced him to miss 18 games 
has healed, but there is still enough uncertainty about its strength that team 
officials will leave it up to Oakley to decide about playing. 
</P>
<P>
Boston (52-30) beat the Knicks in four of five games this season. More 
important for the Celtics, Larry Bird, after a slow start, is playing like 
Larry Bird. Bird averaged 31.5 points in his last 12 games at Boston Garden and 
finished at 24.3 overall. The 7.5 assists is also the second-highest of his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
In close games, you have to like the Celtics even more. They set an NBA record 
for free-throw accuracy, hitting 83.2%, with Bird leading all individuals and 
Kevin McHale fifth. 
</P>
<P>
The team with the home-court advantage won 11 of the 15 playoff matchups last 
season. A look at the other best-of-five first-round series that open tonight, 
at sites for the first two meetings and Game 5 if needed: 
</P>
<P>
Indiana (42-40) at Detroit (59-23): The Pistons are looking to become only the 
third franchise to successfully defend a title, following the Boston Celtics 
and the Minneapolis/Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
After a 14-game improvement from the previous season, Indiana makes its first 
playoff appearance in three years, with only three players left from that 
squad. The Pacers' best chance is familiarity, Coach Dick Versace having spent 
2 1/2 seasons as a Detroit assistant. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons finished with four losses in the last 10 games, but the key factor 
was Joe Dumars returning to form. They went 3-4 in games Dumars missed because 
of a broken hand. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit won the season series, 4-1, taking all three meetings at home. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas (47-35) at Portland (59-23): The Trail Blazers, looking to break a 
streak of not having made it past the first round since 1985, won the season 
series, 4-0, and the Mavericks weren't closer than 31 points in the two games 
in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers used only three different starting lineups all season, with 
Terry Porter, Clyde Drexler, Kevin Duckworth, Jerome Kersey and Buck Williams 
opening together in 71 of the 82 games. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland (42-40) at Philadelphia (53-29): The Cavaliers might have barely 
reached the playoffs, but this is no easy series for the 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the teams split this season, 2-2. For another, Cleveland opened 
18-23 while nursing key players through injuries, but finished 24-17 in the 
second half after the return of Brad Daugherty. With Larry Nance, Winston 
Bennett, Daugherty, Mark Price and Craig Ehlo in the starting lineup for 18 of 
the final 23 games, the Cavaliers went 14-4. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Barkley finished at 60% from the field, second-best in the league, and 
averaged 25.2 points and 11.5 rebounds. Teammate Derek Smith missed the last 
four games of the regular season because of tendinitis in his right knee, but 
he will probably play. 
</P>
<P>
Denver (43-39) at San Antonio (56-26): By winning the Midwest Division title on 
the last day, the Spurs got the Nuggets instead of having to play the Phoenix 
Suns. 
</P>
<P>
Get a good look at these Nuggets, for it may be the last time they will be 
together. In a season of disruptions, in the front office and on the court, 
management has already indicated sweeping changes could be coming. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio, which had a 35-game improvement over last season, dared good 
chemistry by trading Maurice Cheeks to New York for Rod Strickland in 
midseason. But as long as David Robinson and Terry Cummings are around, the 
Spurs have a foundation. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio won three of the four regular-season meetings.

STERN DEFENDS HIS DECISION TO FINE THE LAKERS $25,000

<P>
NBA Commissioner David Stern used a baseball analogy Wednesday to defend his 
$25,000 fine of the Lakers for failing to use two regulars in their final 
regular-season game Sunday at Portland. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to call balls and strikes," Stern said. "The Lakers' action was 
clearly wide of the plate." 
</P>
<P>
Stern said fans buying tickets deserve the best product and that the Lakers did 
not supply that. 
</P>
<P>
With Magic Johnson and James Worthy on the bench, Portland defeated the Lakers, 
130-88. The game did not affect the final standings or playoff situation of 
either team. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent endorsed Stern's action. "We believe strongly 
that teams must make significant effort. . . . I think David did the right 
thing," he said.

Phoenix Cardinal fullback Earl Ferrell, the team's leading rusher the past two 
seasons, voluntarily retired Wednesday after being informed by the NFL that he 
had tested positive for drugs and must miss the 1990 season. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrell, 32, told reporters at a news conference that he received a letter from 
NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"In the off-season, I tested positive and I had a meeting with the 
commissioner," Ferrell said. "I was given a chance to retire, and that's what 
I'm going to do. If I stay clean for a year, I have a chance to come back. I'm 
going to retire for a year and hopefully get straightened out and hopefully 
play football again." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot, 240-pound Ferrell, who has 2,946 yards in his eight-year career, 
has never been suspended by the NFL for drugs although he reportedly tested 
positive at least three times. 
</P>
<P>
He reportedly underwent drug rehabilitation in St. Louis after the 1985 season. 
In 1988, he reportedly tested positive for cocaine use three times but was not 
penalized by the league because the traces were small and he already was under 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrell rushed for a career-high 924 yards and seven touchdowns in 202 carries 
in 1988. Last year, he had 502 yards and six touchdowns in 149 carries.

THEY'RE OFF, RUNNING AT HOLLYWOOD PARK; 
</P>
<P>
HORSE RACING: THE CROWD IS SMALL, BUT BIGGER THAN IT WAS AT LAST YEAR'S OPENER. 
PROFIT KEY WINS DEBONAIR STAKES.

<P>
Initiating its 52nd season, Hollywood Park attracted 18,250 fans Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
No matter that 50 opening-day crowds have been larger. At a track where 
business has declined steadily for more than a few years, Wednesday's figure 
signified some progress. 
</P>
<P>
The 16,675 who showed up last year was the smallest opening-day attendance. 
Perhaps Wednesday's gain was a result of a promotional glass giveaway because 
the handle was down slightly from 1989. The total was $4,091,641 compared to 
$4,104,495 the previous April. 
</P>
<P>
Factoring in the 10 intertrack locations, the total attendance of 26,310 was up 
more than 15% from last year and the handle increased 3.4%. 
</P>
<P>
Those who came to Inglewood or watched the races at one of the satellites 
probably felt as if they were still at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Stevens, the runaway leader among the jockeys at Arcadia, and Wayne Lukas, 
the top trainer, combined to win the $81,100 Debonair Stakes with Profit Key. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, there were a rash of upsets and form reversals, topped by Lucky 
Street's $128.40 surprise, which keyed a $1,233 exacta and a $7,897.50 triple. 
Five of the nine winners paid double digits and nobody was able to isolate even 
five winners in the Pick Six. 
</P>
<P>
Another talented 3-year-old, Profit Key made it three consecutive victories 
with a come-from-behind victory over Doyouseewhatisee and four others in the 
seven-furlong Debonair. 
</P>
<P>
Second in a pair of starts last summer at Del Mar, the son of Desert Wine 
hasn't made any mistakes since returning to the races March 25, but he 
displayed an extra dimension Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Never far off the lead and well-placed outside in his two victories at Santa 
Anita, Profit Key was outrun early and down inside in the Debonair. Seemingly 
in trouble after a half-mile, he accelerated when room developed and won by 
three-quarters of a length in a stakes-record 1:21 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
"I was getting a little concerned, but, as it turned out, it was a 
ground-saving ride," trainer Jeff Lukas said. "When he was behind horses there, 
it was a little bit unclear if he was going to have room. When it did open up, 
he responded real well. 
</P>
<P>
"Until this time, he had looked good and looked like he had a lot of potential. 
Today, he established himself by stepping into the stakes ranks, beating stakes 
winners and setting a stakes record. He's a proven horse now. 
</P>
<P>
"For right now, we'll just stay with a short program with him. Chances are 
he'll stay right here." 
</P>
<P>
A half-brother to highly regarded sprinter Vinnie The Viper, Profit Key, the 
8-5 second choice, acts as if he will be able to handle extra distance. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this was a pretty good indication that he can probably get a middle 
distance," Stevens said. "He was kind of a push-button horse to ride today. He 
was really easy to get along with. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a ton of pure ability. I was on him after I rode him for the first 
time at Del Mar. He's still got a lot of room for improvement. He's still 
studdish and he was really acting up with the pony going to the gate. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really impressed with the way he finished the last eighth of a mile. 
Once he got head and head with those two horses, he was just gone." 
</P>
<P>
Doyouseewhatisee, the 9-2 third choice, was 3 1/2 lengths better than Jacodra, 
the 7-5 favorite. Troubled when he finished second to Profit Key April 8 in his 
first race since June, Jacodra battled with 13-1 shot Master Lypheor through 
:22, :44 2/5 and 1:09 splits before faltering. 
</P>
<P>
It was Doyouseewhatisee's first appearance since he ran third in the Hoist The 
Flag Nov. 25. "He was running easy and I could have won it, but the other horse 
was able to get through," Martin Pedroza said. 
</P>
<P>
Mister Flyer, a 2-year-old half-brother to Mister Frisky, was purchased 
Wednesday by Clover Racing Stable. A son of Fire Dancer, Mister Flyer brought 
$245,000 as a 2-year-old in a training sale in Ocala, Fla. The colt will come 
to California and will be trained by Neil Drysdale. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Valenzuela was ill and took off his mounts Wednesday. The rider, who has 
had a history of substance abuse and was suspended last fall after testing 
positive for cocaine, drove to Hollywood Park and voluntarily submitted a urine 
sample to the stewards. Valenzuela hopes to ride today. 
</P>
<P>
Attempting a comeback, Kenny Black, Corey Black's older brother, will ride two 
horses Friday: maiden Current Climate in the second and Showerstime in the 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Black tested positive for cocaine in 1984 and hasn't ridden locally since. 
</P>
<P>
Licensed as an exercise rider, he had a hearing in front of an officer of the 
California Horse Racing Board last month and was again granted a jockey's 
license. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been through the process and he had to present a lot of positive things," 
steward Pete Pedersen said. "He's been involved with the Winners Foundation and 
he had to present a lot of evidence from horsemen and other responsible 
people." 
</P>
<P>
For a time late last year, Black, who has also had problems with his weight, 
served as his brother's agent. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Martin Pedroza and trainer Sandy Shulman combined for a double with Suit Up in 
the third and Watch 'N Win in the seventh. . . . David Flores also had two 
winners: Lucky Street, who had finished last in his other two starts this year, 
and Sparshott, who took the first at $19. . . . Sunday Silence, who is likely 
to make his 1990 debut in the Californian June 3, is scheduled to work five 
furlongs this morning. . . . Steinlen, who won the El Rincon Handicap in his 
last start, worked five furlongs in 1:01 2/5 this morning in preparation for a 
likely appearance in Sunday's Shoemaker Handicap at a mile on the turf.

INJURED GWYNN DETERMINED TO RACE AGAIN

<P>
Drag racer Darrell Gwynn, speaking publicly for the first time since his 
near-fatal accident Easter Sunday in England, said he hopes to return to racing 
despite having part of his left arm amputated. 
</P>
<P>
"I think all my parts are going to be moving in another month, so hopefully, 
I'll be back in tip-top shape," Gwynn told Dave McClelland of the National Hot 
Rod Assn. in a conversation taped for distribution. "Generally speaking, I feel 
pretty good. If I leave here and I'm walking, I'll be real happy. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything's here, except my left hand. I think I can drive without that." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, in Aylsbury, England, where Gwynn was 
taken after his top fuel dragster crashed during a practice run, have not 
determined if Gwynn will be paralyzed. He has no feeling below the waist, but 
doctors said that the swelling around his spinal cord, which was bruised and 
crushed, must be reduced before they can make a diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been conscious since the time I got off the plane here in England," he 
said. "I've been awake the entire time and lived a whole lot, been through a 
lot of things that I didn't think would ever come my way." 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn, 28, a three-time winner of the Winston World Finals at Pomona and one of 
the sport's leading drivers, was testing his dragster before an exhibition race 
against Al Segrini, a fellow American, on the Santa Pod track in Bradsbury when 
it suddenly veered into the guard rail and rolled over on its side, pinning 
Gwynn beneath it as it slid down the strip. 
</P>
<P>
"I recollect everything that's happened and for some reason the car just wanted 
to go and I had no control over it. I asked my dad, 'Hey, is it something I 
did?' and (he said) it looks like mechanical failure at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Gwynn has been his son's crew chief and team manager since Darrell began 
racing in 1980 in their hometown of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
The premier motorcycle road racers in the United States will be at Willow 
Springs Raceway this weekend for the Western Eastern Roadracers Assn. Formula 
USA championship race and the Kerker/Scandinavian Brake Systems national 
endurance race. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Sadowski, winner of the Daytona 200 last March on a Yamaha 750, heads the 
entry list for the WERA Formula USA race on Sunday, which will be 20 laps 
around Willow Springs' 2.5-mile road course. Formula USA bikes are unlimited in 
engine displacement and modifications, usually four-cylinder variations of 
Japanese sportbikes such as the Yamaha FZR, Honda Hurricane, Kawasaki Ninja or 
Suzuki GSXR. 
</P>
<P>
Sadowski, 26, from Buford, Ga., will ride a Yamaha for the Vance &amp; Hines 
team of Santa Fe Springs. In addition to winning the Daytona 500, the most 
prestigious race on the American Motorcyclist Assn. schedule, he won the 1986 
WERA national endurance championship. 
</P>
<P>
Formula USA was started in 1986 at Willow Springs by track promoter Bill Huth 
and taken national last year by WERA. The bikes are capable of speeds up to 170 
m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday will be three 12-lap races for Superstock bikes. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, 60 teams will compete in the six-hour national championship endurance 
race, which will start at 11:30 a.m. It will be Round 3 of the 15-race series. 
</P>
<P>
Each rider will race between 60 to 90 minutes before stopping for fuel, tires 
and a rider change -- which will all be accomplished in less than a minute. 
</P>
<P>
Team Suzuki's Mike Smith of Atlanta and Kurt Hall of Bluffton, S.C., who won a 
six-hour race last month at Talladega, Ala., will be favored in the enduro on 
their Suzuki 1100. Their Talladega victory was the team's 50th since it was 
organized as Team Hammer in 1981 with Bruce Hammer and John Ulrich, two 
Southern Californians, as the riders. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other entries will be Team Marlboro Roberts, managed by former world 
champion Kenny Roberts, who also manages world champion Eddie Lawson and Wayne 
Rainey on the world championship Grand Prix circuit. Roberts' team will include 
Rich Oliver of Pittsburg, Calif., winner of the 250cc race at Daytona this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Willow Springs Raceway is located off Route 14 in Rosamond, just north of 
Lancaster, about 90 miles from downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
MIDGETS -- Sleepy Tripp, defending champion in the United States Auto Club's 
ESPN Thunder Series, will attempt to make up more ground on points leader Robby 
Flock when the series resumes Saturday night at Ascot Park. Tripp, who won his 
201st career race last week, trails Flock, the USAC Western Regional champion, 
by 16 points with two races remaining. Three-quarter midgets will share the 
billing with the full midgets. 
</P>
<P>
DRAG RACING -- The National Hot Rod Assn. will open its Division 7 season this 
weekend at Bakersfield Raceway for eight sportsman categories. It is the first 
of six events leading to the Winston divisional point championships. A purse of 
$95,200 will be at stake with final eliminations Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Three-time world drag boat champion Tim Capaldi of Canoga Park will make his 
car racing debut at Bakersfield in a top alcohol dragster after racing on water 
nine years. The car was built by his boat crew, headed by his father, Ray, also 
a former world drag boat champion. Capaldi decided to switch from water to 
asphalt after a crash in his "Shot in the Dark" blown alcohol hydro last April 
at Puddingstone Lake that sidelined him for five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
STOCK CARS -- Ron Meyer has won the Winston Racing Series championship three of 
the past four years at Ascot Park, but this year he is concentrating on 
pavement racing so his older brother, Bill Jr., has taken over the family 
position in the pro stock class. Bill Jr. won his second outing last week and 
will be back for more against perennial challenger Marcus Mallett in Sunday 
night's main event. 
</P>
<P>
NASCAR sportsman, street stocks and a destruction derby are scheduled Saturday 
night at Saugus Speedway and Cajon Speedway. . . . Orange Show Speedway will be 
dark for another week as the Orange Show takes over the San Bernardino 
facility. . . . Street stocks race Friday night at Ventura Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
RALLY -- Rod Millen, a transplanted New Zealander living in Irvine who won the 
National Pro Rally driver championship last year, will drive a Mazda in the 
annual Rim of the World Rally on Saturday. The event, part of the North 
American Rally championship series, will start at 1 p.m. in Lancaster and run 
for 14 hours in a series of stages in the Angeles National Forest northeast of 
Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Millen is not contesting the national series this year but is making an 
appearance this weekend to prepare for defense of his Asian-Pacific rally 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
MOTOCROSS -- The Continental Motosports Club's Spring Classic series will be at 
Carlsbad Raceway on Sunday. The CMC will also hold a night program Friday at 
Ascot Park. . . . The third race in the Coors/Kawasaki series at Ventura 
Raceway is scheduled Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
SPRINT CARS -- A record 47 cars have been entered in the sixth annual 
California Racing Assn.'s Midwest Tour, which will start Tuesday at 81 Speedway 
in Wichita, Kan. After nine races in Kansas, Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin 
and Iowa, the CRA will return to its home base at Ascot Park on May 19. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Maria Speedway will hold a Golden State Challenge race Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
NECROLOGY -- Bob Drake, of Marina del Rey, a leading Sports Car Club of America 
driver in the '60s, died of cancer last Wednesday at the Motion Picture 
Hospital in Chatsworth, where he had been ill for six months. Drake, 70, won 
major sports car races at Palm Springs, Pomona, Santa Barbara and Willow 
Springs while driving a Ferrari for John von Neumann and Birdcage Maseratis for 
Joe Lubin and Max Balchowsky. He is survived by his wife, Gloria, of Marina del 
Rey; son James of Arroyo Grande, and granddaughter Laura. Burial was at sea.

NUITS ST. GEORGES HURT, WILL MISS DERBY

<P>
Nuits St. Georges, who would have been a longshot to win the Kentucky Derby, 
will miss the race because of a shin injury that will require surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Nuits St. Georges, who hadn't won a race until he beat maidens at Santa Anita 
on March 4, won the Rebel Stakes at 30-1 at Oaklawn Park on March 31, then 
finished 10th in the Arkansas Derby on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In the Arkansas Derby, Nuits St. Georges was making a move with a half-mile to 
run when he apparently broke the cannon bone of his left foreleg. "Before that, 
I thought we'd win or at least be right there," jockey Jamie Bruin said. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Doug Peterson said that Nuits St. Georges will undergo surgery today. 
The recuperation period is estimated to be three months. 
</P>
<P>
"The track was hard in Arkansas, and this is a big horse who hits the ground 
hard," Peterson said. "It had rained before the race, and that washed away what 
little cushion the track had. I still think this horse has a bright future. 
It's just that it will have to come later rather than now." 
</P>
<P>
Another horse was seriously injured in the Arkansas Derby. Wicked Destiny, who 
was undefeated in his only three races, finished ninth and chipped a bone in 
his right hind leg. It is not known how long the Remington Park Derby winner 
will be sidelined. 
</P>
<P>
The 116th Kentucky Derby, scheduled for a week from Saturday at Churchill 
Downs, is down to 16 probables: Summer Squall, Mister Frisky, Silver Ending, 
Thirty Six Red, Land Rush, Real Cash, Burnt Hills, Pendleton Ridge, Unbridled, 
Shot Gun Scott, Pleasant Tap, Video Ranger, Killer Diller, Dr. Bobby A., 
Fighting Fantasy and Country Day. Most of the trainers are hoping that the list 
dwindles to 14 or fewer, so that only one starting gate can be used.

Great Normand took the lead entering the stretch and then held to win by a head 
over Phantom Breeze in the $36,000 Shelter Bay Stakes for older horses at 
Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
The win was the first in three starts this year for Great Normand, who is owned

2/5 and earned $21,600. 
</P>
<P>
Great Normand, ridden by J.C. Ferrer and carrying 119 pounds, returned $28.20, 
$8 and $6.40. Phantom Breeze paid $2.80 and $2.40 and Kate's Valentine, who was 
another 4 3/4 lengths back in third in the nine-horse field, returned $4.20 to 
show.

The NBA has filed a second lawsuit against the Oregon Lottery, alleging that 
its new scratch-off ticket game is based on the league's championship series. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court, claims the "Basketball Championship 
Pool" game infringes on the NBA's trademarks, creates confusion for its fans 
and unjustly enriches the Oregon Lottery.

THE PRICEY PHOTO OPPORTUNITY; 
</P>
<P>
PHOTOGRAPHY: THE FOUR-DAY TAKE FOR A NEW YORK CITY AUCTION SERIES IS EXPECTED 
TO TOTAL MORE THAN $7 MILLION.

You can still buy a photograph for $1,000 at auction, but if you plan to 
compete for the work of well known artists, you need at least $10,000. If you 
want to take your pick of the top lots, you'd better be prepared to spend up to 
$100,000. That's the bottom line of a four-day round of photography auctions 
this week that is expected to total more than $7 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
The buying fest got off to a solid start on Monday night with a $1.3-million 
sale of "photographic masterworks" at Christie's, followed by a $1.4-million 
auction of lower-priced photographs on Tuesday. The crowd of photography 
aficionados moved across town on to Sotheby's on Wednesday for a highly 
publicized auction of the Graham Nash collection. 
</P>
<P>
Those who haven't already depleted their bank accounts will have another chance 
today, when the series of auctions winds up with Sotheby's sale of about 500 
photographs. The selection ranges from a daguerreotype of Henry Clay (circa 
1850), valued at $15,000 to $20,000, to David Hockney's 1982 photo collage of 
the Merced River in Yosemite Valley, which is expected to command $12,000 to 
$18,000. 
</P>
<P>
Among works by about 200 artists are such historical gems as Henri le Secq's 
mid 19th-Century album of 60 photographs of French churches ($60,000 to 
$90,000) and such curiosities as a "Victorian Family Photograph Album" that 
includes 125 erotic pictures ($4,000 to $6,000). The priciest items, running in 
the high five figures, include experimental works by Man Ray, Edward Weston's 
classic images and a 1907 nude by Clarence H. White and Alfred Stieglitz. 
</P>
<P>
If today's sale follows the pattern established earlier this week, members of 
the audience and telephone bidders will cheerfully part with more money as they 
build gallery inventories and enhance personal collections. 
</P>
<P>
"You only live once," said a San Francisco collector who declined to give his 
name after paying $66,000 for "Dunes, Oceano," Edward Weston's 1936 photograph 
of elegantly rippled sand dunes, on Monday night at Christie's. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't alone. Another unidentified man paid $66,000 for Alvin Langdon 
Coburn's 1905 platinum and gum print, "The White Bridge, Venice." The top lot 
in the sale, an album of 51 prints of Yosemite Valley by Carleton E. Watkins, 
brought $71,500, well above its high pre-sale estimate of $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
Inch for inch, the most expensive item at Christie's was a 3 1/2x2 1/4-inch 
carte-de-visite made for Abraham Lincoln by Mathew Brady. The tiny calling card 
had been estimated at $15,000 to $20,000, but a telephone bidder finally 
snagged it for $49,500. 
</P>
<P>
"People aren't afraid to spend money on photographs any more," said Los Angeles 
dealer Stephen White, who recently sold his collection of 15,000 photographs, 
albums, books and related materials to the Tokyo Fuji Art Museum in Tokyo for 
an undisclosed sum in the low millions. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago dealer Ed Houk was among the most notably fearless earlier this week as 
he snapped up Lewis Hine's 1931 "New York City From the Empire State Building" 
for $35,200, Margaret Bourke-White's "Plow Blades" for $14,300 and Paul 
Outerbridge's "An Abstraction in Angles" for $30,800. 
</P>
<P>
Some dealers came to New York with lengthy shopping lists and catalogues 
bristling with page markers. Los Angeles dealer G. Ray Hawkins, for example, 
said he had $300,000 of orders from clients. Among his successful bids were 
$33,000 for a 1939 photogram by Laszlo Moholy-Nagy and $19,800 for a playful 
photograph of cut-out paper figures by Alexander Rodchenko. 
</P>
<P>
Christie's auctions on Monday and Tuesday indicated a healthy market inclined 
to soar out of sight for star lots but just as likely to let less desirable 
pieces go begging. The totals of both sales hit the middle range predicted by 
the auction house, but 15% of works offered in each session failed to sell. 
Records were set for more than a dozen artists, but some works sold for less 
than their low estimates. Hine's "Empire State Building," for example, was 
valued at up to $60,000, but it brought only $35,200. 
</P>
<P>
Christie's auctions also asked serious questions about the market for Robert 
Mapplethorpe's work. Just last November, shortly after his death, prices for 
his photographs rose rapidly to a record $38,500 for a single image 
("Self-Portrait With Gun and Star") and $60,500 for a trio of floral still 
lifes, produced in an edition of 15. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, however, a set of the same flower photographs sold for 
$55,000, and two of the four Mapplethorpes offered failed to sell. Tuesday's 
sale included 18 Mapplethorpes, five of which didn't find buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Is the market for Mapplethorpe's homoerotic art drying up? Does he only appeal 
to a small group of collectors who already have the works they want? Have his 
photographs been vastly over valued? Or were the rejected pieces inferior 
examples of his work? 
</P>
<P>
Conflicting answers echoed through Christie's sale room this week. About the 
only point of agreement was that Sotheby's auction today may provide a more 
accurate test. The sale will close with a stronger group of 35 works by 
Mapplethorpe that are valued as high as $50,000.

CAMBODIAN DANCERS RUN INTO ROADBLOCK ON L.A. FESTIVAL VISIT; 
</P>
<P>
CULTURE: STATE DEPT. APPROVES VISA FOR CHOREOGRAPHER, BUT PHNOM PENH REGIME 
DISAPPROVES VISIT. ORGANIZERS OF THE EVENT REMAIN OPTIMISTIC.

<P>
The National Dance Company of Cambodia's participation in the Los Angeles 
Festival suffered a setback this week when the Cambodian government disapproved 
a trip here by a Cambodian choreographer to negotiate with festival officials. 
</P>
<P>
The choreographer, Proeung Chhieng, who is the vice dean at the Phnom Penh 
School of Fine Arts, had been granted a temporary visitor's visa earlier this 
month by the U.S. State Department. He was only the third Cambodian under the 
current Phnom Penh regime to be granted such a visa, as the U.S. government 
does not recognize the Vietnamese-installed regime or its leader, Hun Sen. 
</P>
<P>
The approval of Proeung Chhieng's visa, however, came simultaneously with the 
denial of a visa for Chheng Phon, Cambodia's minister of culture and 
information. Chheng Phon's visa was denied, a State Department source said, 
because granting a visa to a "high-level representative" of the Phnom Penh 
regime might be seen as "confering legitimacy" on that regime. 
</P>
<P>
But festival organizers and individuals involved in the politically sensitive 
and complicated negotiations say they will continue with plans to host the 
dance company at the Sept. 1-17 arts festival. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just too many things going on to predict (whether the Cambodians will 
be approved)," said Judith Luther, festival executive director. Even if we're 
turned down at first, we're going to go ahead with it, so we don't have to go 
running around if they're approved at the last minute. We're going to keep the 
money in the budget and keep up on all of the paperwork." 
</P>
<P>
Luther added, "I think it will happen, but I think there'll be a lot of 
setbacks along the way. It's the kind of thing where we probably won't know for 
sure until a couple of weeks before (the festival)." 
</P>
<P>
Such last-minute decisions have characterized much of the festival's planning. 
Organizers have missed funding deadlines and delayed programming decisions. The 
festival has yet to come up with a logo design. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course (the Cambodian negotiations) are the most complicated, but in every 
area it's complicated," Luther said. "It's painstaking. We're doing everything 
the hard way." 
</P>
<P>
Indicative of these complications is the roundabout way negotiations with the 
Cambodians have developed. 
</P>
<P>
The first indication received by the festival that the choreographer wasn't 
coming was via hand-scrawled fax from Philadelphia: "We just got a cable saying 
-- sigh! -- Proeung Chhieng is not coming." It came from a key player in the 
negotiations, John McAuliff, who is the director of the Philadelphia-based 
U.S.-Indochina Reconciliation Project, and is acting as a go-between for the 
festival, the State Department and the Cambodian culture ministry. 
</P>
<P>
At first, festival officials on Tuesday had assumed that the U.S. State 
Department had revoked Proeung Chhieng's visa. 
</P>
<P>
But according to McAuliff, it was the sole decision of the Cambodian government 
to cancel Proeung Chhieng's visit, which had been expected in the next couple 
of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"The government in Phnom Penh felt that Proeung Chhieng was basically coming 
here to assist Chheng Phon, and when (Chheng Phon) was turned down they may 
simply have been insulted that a person of this kind of eminence was turned 
down, when in Cambodia he's viewed as being so non-political," McAuliff said. 
</P>
<P>
Or, McAuliff continued, "Maybe they decided this guy was just too junior. Maybe 
they don't think he's the kind of person that can help establish these kinds of 
(important cultural) relationships." 
</P>
<P>
Even McAuliff has not been in direct contact with the Cambodians. His 
information came from an American liaison living in Phnom Penh, who cabled him 
a terse message: "The ministry decided not to send Proeung Chhieng by himself. 
They said that the only purpose for his travel was to accompany Chheng Phon, 
and if he wasn't going then there was no point." 
</P>
<P>
McAuliff, whose organization handles mainly educational exchanges and was 
responsible for bringing the head of Cambodia's Red Cross here last year, is 
traveling to Phnom Penh on Friday. Although the purpose of his trip is to 
arrange for 10 American teachers to visit Phnom Penh this summer, he said he 
also will act on behalf of the L.A. Festival to obtain information about the 
32-member Cambodian dance company and negotiate with the culture ministry in 
hopes of changing their minds about Proeung Chhieng's visit. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, McAuliff said, the Cambodian's decision to cancel Proeung Chhieng's 
visit shouldn't affect whether or not the dance company makes it to September's 
L.A. Festival. 
</P>
<P>
"(The Cambodians) are committed to sending them and I think they'll send them 
if the U.S. will give them the visas," McAuliff said. 
</P>
<P>
While festival officials had viewed the granting of Proeung Chhieng's visa as a 
fairly strong indication that the dance company's visas may also be approved, 
McAuliff was less enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
"They allowed (the head of Phnom Penh's Red Cross) here last year, so it really 
wasn't anything outside of the past. I'm glad they did it, but I don't think 
they moved much," McAuliff said. "I think it's encouraging, but they could 
still make the distinction of (granting a visa to) Proeung Chhieng as an 
individual and (not granting a visa to) the dance company (because it could be 
seen) as a national symbol of Cambodia." 
</P>
<P>
In denying the Culture Minister's visa, a letter to McAuliff from Charles H. 
Twining, director of the State Department's Office for Vietnam, Laos and 
Cambodia Affairs, touched upon such national symbols. "We recognized the worthy 
cultural component to Dr. Phon's proposed travel but . . . determined that 
granting a visa to a Cabinet member of the Phnom Penh regime would have had 
potentially serious policy consequences for the U.S. . . . (and) would confuse 
other states regarding the consistency of our Cambodian policy," Twining wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The official State Department response Wednesday was that they were not 
surprised of the cancellation because of the choreographer's government ties 
through the Phnom Penh School of Fine Arts.

A NEW WORLD FOR EAST EUROPEAN FILMMAKERS; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: DIRECTORS ADJUST TO FREEDOMS AT HOME AND THE PROSPECT OF COMPETING IN 
THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETPLACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

"Suffering is more cinematic than happiness," says Polish director Krzysztof 
Kieslowski on a subject that East European filmmakers perhaps know better than 
anyone else. But now with the end of 45 years of communist domination, 
filmmaking, like every other aspect of life in East Europe, is adjusting to the 
new demands of freedom. The oppression may be over, but the cinematic future of 
the region is far from settled. Even how to refer to the directors -- European 
or East European -- is a matter of debate as more than 20 directors arrive in 
Los Angeles to participate in the AFI L.A. FilmFest that is featuring 40 films 
from Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Their conversation is rich in metaphor, perhaps as a result of evading 
censorship for so many years, as they consider the paradox of their freedom. 
"Now that we have the liberty to make films, we don't have the money," said 
Lyudmil Staikov, director of the epic "Time of Violence" and president of the 
Bulgarian film industry. 
</P>
<P>
Round-faced and earnest, Staikov is "proud that some of the films made by our 
industry were the basis for social change." But, surprisingly, it is not 
politics that he or his colleagues want to talk about. "I feel for the first 
time I don't have to be political. My films can be more personal and more 
commercial," said Gyula Gazdag, the young Hungarian director of "Stand Off" who 
is now a visiting professor at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
How to find the money to make those films is now the main topic of 
conversation. Overnight, the East Europeans must compete on the world market 
with French, German and other international filmmakers. Against the worldwide 
dominance of hard currency, the film industries of Poland, Czechoslovakia, 
Hungary, Bulgaria and even the Soviet Union must reinvent themselves from 
scratch while coming up with a formula to attract an audience at home and 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"What kind of films should we make and for whom?" asked Kieslowski. And in 
Poland as everywhere, "the audience is always right and the author always 
wrong. Who has more freedom, someone subsidized by the audience or by the 
state?" 
</P>
<P>
After a limited diet of approved films, East European audiences are hungry for 
big American movies, not art. To survive, directors will have to find a way to 
meet commercial demands without sacrificing the originality of their vision, a 
dilemma seemingly faced by filmmakers everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Irina Aktascheva, Bulgarian co-director of "Monday Morning," hears rallies in 
the streets and wonders how she can capture that audience for her films. "Right 
now, people don't have enough to eat. If we can't raise the money internally, 
we have to find sponsorship abroad, and that's doubtful. I'm sure there won't 
be money for films for the next five years in Bulgaria." 
</P>
<P>
But the need for hard currency is real. Even in the Soviet Union, quality film 
stock and equipment from the West can only be acquired with hard currency and 
without it, production values are not high enough to sell a film on the 
international market. The obvious solution is co-production. 
</P>
<P>
But is there a place for the often dark vision of unknown East European 
directors in an American-driven market where foreign hits are becoming as rare 
as $2 bills? "No one is interested in Poland or Polish history," said 
Kieslowski, "and an American audience is completely not interested. They see it 
all on the news." 
</P>
<P>
Gazdag disagreed. He believes that Americans are curious about Eastern Europe 
and considers Hungary's 900-year history of enslavement fertile ground. "The 
stories we've lived through are so interesting and unusual and so much more 
dramatic than what Americans are used to." 
</P>
<P>
Whether these stories can be told in English for an international audience 
without watering down the vision that makes them special was a hotly debated 
topic at a panel discussion Sunday. The brightly dressed Soviet filmmaker and 
poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko was against it, urging his fellow filmmakers to "save 
the flame of real art and inspiration. . . . We must continue to feel pain, but 
pain of great quality." 
</P>
<P>
Staikov took a more down-to-earth approach. Sounding remarkably like any 
producer anxious to make a deal, he promised a Bulgarian industry that would be 
more responsive to commercial considerations and international taste. "The 
important thing is to have conditions to work in. We won't lose our identity by 
working abroad," he said, pointing to the work of Forman, Skolimowski, Polanski 
and Tarkovsky. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent sign of the international appeal of East European cinema is a 
commitment by Kieslowski to do his next four films for French producers, 
possibly shot in English, for a world market. 
</P>
<P>
But most co-production is still on the level of foreign companies using the 
facilities, locations and some below-the-line talent to shoot a project that 
has nothing to do with the local culture. 
</P>
<P>
Staikov acknowledges that the effect of outside location shooting in Bulgaria 
could be a "tragedy," but he promises not to let his country be overrun by 
future co-productions. "We don't want to make a lot of money. Just enough to 
keep our industry afloat."

AN AFTERNOON AT THE 'OPERA' FOR $27,500; 
</P>
<P>
AUCTION: PHONE LINES ARE JAMMED AS THREE PAIRS OF TICKETS DONATED BY MICHAEL 
CRAWFORD ARE SOLD DURING CHANNEL 7'S 'A.M. LOS ANGELES' PROGRAM. THE SIX RAISE 
A TOTAL OF $74,500 FOR CHARITY.

Phantomania escalated to Phantofrenzy Wednesday when a sizzling $27,500 was bid 
on a pair of 10th-row orchestra seats for Sunday's matinee performance of "The 
Phantom of the Opera." It will be the last performance to feature Michael 
Crawford in the title role of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical at the Ahmanson 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Two other pairs of tickets to the same matinee drew bids of $26,000 and 
$21,000. The regular ticket price is $50. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford, who originated the Phantom role in London in 1986 and won a Tony for 
it in 1988, had donated the three pairs to be auctioned for charity on KABC-TV 
Channel 7's "A.M. Los Angeles," after hearing that ticket brokers were getting 
up to $1,500 per ticket for his final week. The station plans to release the 
names of the bidders Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The auction, which took place on Wednesday's hour-long "A.M. Los Angeles," was 
to have been limited to that hour, but producers and network executives decided 
early Wednesday to extend the bidding to 3 p.m., anticipating that phone lines 
might be jammed. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want viewers to feel cheated out of making those calls," said 
Claudia Contreras, spokeswoman for the program. Operators were instructed to 
tell callers what the latest bids were as they recorded the new ones. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the highest bid will go to Para Los Ninos, a social service 
agency serving homeless and transient families in central and inner city Los 
Angeles. Proceeds from the runners up will go to Equity Fights AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Winners must deliver a certified check by noon today to collect their tickets, 
which will be presented to them by Crawford on Friday's "A.M. Los Angeles." In 
case of no shows, tickets will go to the next highest bona fide bidder. 
</P>
<P>
As for Crawford's reaction to such meganumbers, "How do you write down 
speechless?," he said Wednesday. "There were tears in my eyes when I heard it. 
I thought bids would reach $5,000, tops. There will be a lot of lemonade drunk 
downtown tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"When the entire company gave up its tickets for a week and a half to benefit 
Equity Fights AIDS, we raised $50,000. Today, with just three pairs of tickets, 
we've raised $74,500. What can I say? It's fabulous, it's just fabulous." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Guillaume, formerly of "Soap" and "Benson," will replace Crawford as the 
Phantom beginning Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Orchestra seats for the hit musical, which opened in Los Angeles in June of 
last year, are sold out through mid-December. But the announcement at the end 
of March that Crawford would be leaving the show April 29 unleashed an 
unprecedented stampede for tickets that resulted in a market for tickets at 
extraordinary prices.

<P>
After a heated, racially charged protest by nearly 200 people -- most of them 
black community leaders -- the Board of Directors on Tuesday agreed to 
reconsider its choice of Philip Hawkey, a white administrator from Ohio, to 
become Pasadena's new city manager. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Paparian, one of the directors who supported Hawkey over two black 
candidates in a 4-3 vote by the board last week, said he wanted to return to 
closed session to discuss accusations that Hawkey made race-biased decisions as 
city manager of Toledo. 
</P>
<P>
No date was set for the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to do the right thing," Paparian told a packed council chamber. "I 
thought we had sorted through all of the facts. But if we haven't, then we 
should." 
</P>
<P>
Hawkey, at a news conference Wednesday in Toledo, defended his record and said 
he will not withdraw from consideration for the post. 
</P>
<P>
Paparian's change of heart came after a 12-hour rally by black leaders -- 
including a Toledo minister flown here for the occasion -- that was part 
religious revival, part civil rights demonstration. Marchers gathered outside 
City Hall at noon bearing signs that read "Stop Racism in Pasadena." 
</P>
<P>
In the late afternoon, they moved to the council chambers, where more than 
three dozen church leaders, doctors, lawyers and educators -- many of them 
wearing black armbands -- told the board that Hawkey's appointment represented 
a slap in the face to African-Americans everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
They expressed support for the two other finalists, Jack Bond, county manager 
in Durham County, N.C., and Larry Moore, city manager of Richmond, Calif., to 
replace Donald McIntyre, who has served more than 17 years in the post. Shouts 
of "Right on!" and "Amen!" followed almost every speaker. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I would never find myself saying racism is alive and well in the 
city of Pasadena," said Loretta Glickman, former city director. "I cannot tell 
you how hurt I was." 
</P>
<P>
As the evening wore on, the exchanges became more confrontational. At one 
point, the directors briefly adjourned, and someone in the crowd heckled, 
"Better go wash your sheets!" -- an apparent reference to robes worn by Ku Klux 
Klan members. 
</P>
<P>
"This board is saying that the best that blacks have to offer in the country is 
not as good as the mediocre white that you chose," Joe Hopkins, an attorney who 
helped organize the protest, told the directors. "You say that's not racism. I 
say that there's no other definition." 
</P>
<P>
"You're talking to somebody who does not take that charge lightly," Mayor 
William Thomson responded. "I think you would find that if you would just back 
off the charges and accusations, you would get along a lot better with people. 
You're obviously an angry individual." 
</P>
<P>
"The problem with me," retorted Hopkins, "is that I'm probably not angry 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most dramatic moment was the surprise appearance of the Rev. Floyd 
Rose, pastor of Family Baptist Church in Toledo, whose air fare to Pasadena was 
paid by several local black leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, the former president of the Toledo NAACP, told the directors that Hawkey 
has run into difficulties with minorities and that more than 20 civil rights 
lawsuits have been filed against the city during his four-year tenure there. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most serious of the black community complaints is that Hawkey 
unfairly fired a black Toledo city official. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have been told that Philip Hawkey has no race-relations problems in 
Toledo, you have been sold a bill of goods," Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
He also charged that Hawkey frequently pitted blacks against blacks, "using 
some of us against the rest of us, and then discrediting us all." 
</P>
<P>
Rose alluded to a videotape prepared by Hawkey that features several black 
leaders in Toledo expressing their support for him. A copy of the tape was 
given to Thomson, who showed it to the board at a closed meeting last week, 
according to several directors. 
</P>
<P>
The tape has no statements by Toledo's one black city councilman, instead 
featuring comments only by blacks who are outside the mainstream of the city's 
African-American community, Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
In his Wednesday press conference, Hawkey criticized Rose for his "attempt to 
sow seeds of meanness." 
</P>
<P>
"It is regretful that Floyd Rose took his message of hate to Pasadena," Hawkey 
said. "His statements were malicious and were solely focused on destroying my 
reputation." 
</P>
<P>
Paparian, however, said Rose raised enough points to merit reopening the 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
The board unanimously agreed to reconsider Hawkey's selection. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we had answered every possible question," Paparian said. "Now I 
don't know what all the facts are." 
</P>

FAX OF LIFE IN POMONA: BRYANT 'STINGS' MAYOR 
</P>

<P>
Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant last week floated a "really blistering" -- but 
phony -- memo in what he claims was an elaborate effort to expose Mayor Donna 
Smith as the source of City Hall news leaks. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant's memo, marked confidential, featured a tirade against "incompetent 
management" by City Administrator Julio Fuentes and contained a threat to seek 
his dismissal. It also asked for an end to an ongoing city investigation, 
initiated by Fuentes, into alleged licensing irregularities in a local body 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's City Council meeting, Bryant said he drafted the memo solely to 
trick Smith, who admits releasing the memo via fax machine to a local 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to use the right bait to catch the fish," said Bryant, who sent the 
memo last Thursday via City Hall mail to the mayor and council members, then 
quickly retrieved all copies except the one to Smith. A reporter from the 
Pomona Progress Bulletin called Bryant about the memo two hours later. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said she believes that Bryant, who is facing a recall election June 5, 
wrote the memo in earnest but changed his mind about sending it when he saw her 
using a fax machine at City Hall. Smith, who supports the recall, said Bryant 
incorrectly assumed that she was sending the document to the district 
attorney's office, then concocted a "fairy tale" to explain his reasons for 
writing the memo. 
</P>
<P>
The memo, ostensibly directed to Fuentes with copies to the mayor and council 
members, accused Fuentes of hurting employee morale, stopping the city's 
progress and acting unprofessionally. It gave him two weeks to improve the 
situation, resign, or face firing. 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes said he learned of the memo from a staff member, and asked to see the 
mayor's copy. Fuentes said he took the memo seriously and cited it as one of 
his reasons for calling an immediate staff meeting to inquire into employee 
morale. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who has been urging the district attorney to investigate allegations of 
corruption in city government, including the body shop matter, said Bryant's 
memo trap "is evidence of the games that are played here daily. . . . This just 
shows the continual harassment." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Tomas Ursua said it doesn't matter whether the memo was a ruse or 
not. 
</P>
<P>
"If this was a joke, it was in very bad taste," he said. And if it was not, he 
said, it is an example of difficulties placed in the way of city administrators 
already under siege, moving "from one blowup to the next." 
</P>
<P>
The memo flap is the latest in a long line of council in-fighting incidents. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a big mess," said Ursua, a former Bryant ally who now sometimes 
sides with Smith. "I get very frustrated with all the pettiness and the 
bickering. It shows the level we have sunk to." 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's council meeting, Smith also came under attack by Councilman Mark A. 
T. Nymeyer, a former Smith ally who now often votes with Bryant. Nymeyer 
accused Smith of leaking two confidential memos he wrote last month. 
</P>
<P>
One of Nymeyer's memos urged the city administrator to admonish acting Police 
Chief Jack Blair for showing "disrespect" toward Bryant and the other demanded 
that a Police Department investigation of irregularities in the issuance of a 
business license be turned over to the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Nymeyer said that his memos were sent on a City Hall fax machine to Jim Brulte, 
his political opponent in the 65th Assembly District Republican primary. 
</P>
<P>
"You faxed that information on a city machine at city cost," he told Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Smith denied it. "I'm sorry, but I have to call you a liar," she told Nymeyer. 
He replied: "You're a liar." 
</P>
<P>
Brulte said he received no confidential memos. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Smith told reporters that council members were planning to meet to 
discuss firing Fuentes. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was wrong, although she claims that council members would have taken up 
the matter had she not made their intentions public. But Bryant, who has made 
no secret of his displeasure with Fuentes since he was hired late last year, 
said Smith's announcement spread such alarm that Fuentes cleaned out his desk 
and packed his belongings. 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes had little comment on the latest flap but said Bryant was correct that 
he had cleaned out his desk last month. "My boxes are still packed," he said.

DIAMOND BAR TO RECEIVE TAX REVENUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian has signed a bill giving Diamond Bar $1.2 million in 
property tax revenue, more than doubling the young city's reserve fund. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, signed by the governor Friday, exempts Diamond Bar from a 
technicality in state law that had prevented the city from collecting property 
taxes this year. The bill makes Diamond Bar eligible for the money immediately, 
although city officials said there may be some bureaucratic delays before the 
check arrives. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was proposed by former Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier), who was 
sworn in April 16 as state senator after winning a special election. The bill 
passed by unanimous votes in both houses of the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Robert Van Nort said the money will go into the city's reserve 
fund. It is not needed to balance the city's budget, which has a $750,000 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's approval of Hill's bill solves a problem that grew out of the 
timing of Diamond Bar's incorporation in April, 1989. Without the exemption, 
Diamond Bar could not get property tax revenue until the 1990-91 fiscal year, 
which begins July 1. The city would have had to incorporate by January, 1989, 
to receive the money during the current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Before asking Hill to sponsor legislation, city officials asked Los Angeles 
County officials, including Supervisor Pete Schabarum, to turn over this year's 
tax revenue, to no avail. After their attempts failed, some City Council 
members considered suing the county, but turned to Hill for help. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters said it was unfair to expect Diamond Bar to provide city services 
for 13 months without receiving property tax money to offset expenditures. 
County officials objected, noting that Diamond Bar has other sources of revenue 
and arguing that losing $1.2 million would hurt the county. 
</P>
<P>
Even without the tax infusion, Diamond Bar was planning to hire an assistant 
city manager next month, in addition to beefing up traffic patrols and starting 
narcotics enforcement programs, Van Nort said.

THE CITY MANAGER BROUHAHA; 
</P>
<P>
TOLEDO: AS CITY MANAGER, PHILIP HAWKEY CLEANED UP A FINANCIAL MESS BUT INCURRED 
CHARGES OF BIAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

TOLEDO, Ohio 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Philip Hawkey became city manager here in 1986, he inherited racial 
problems, partisan political fighting and a city government characterized by 
mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his best efforts to improve the administration -- he substantially 
increased minority hiring, tightened and reorganized a foundering bureaucracy, 
and cleaned up a housing mess that had led to a cutoff of federal funds -- 
Hawkey became ensnared in the political and racial crosscurrents that flow 
through this Midwestern city like the slow brown waters of the Maumee River. 
</P>
<P>
Now those problems have stretched west, threatening to scuttle Hawkey's 
selection last week as the new city manager of Pasadena. The Pasadena Board of 
Directors voted late Tuesday night to reconsider their selection of Hawkey to 
replace retiring 17-year-veteran Donald McIntyre after a crowd of angry blacks 
cited Hawkey's performance in Toledo as a reason to reject him. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hawkey insists that he has made significant reforms, many of Toledo's 
black leaders believe he has failed to be responsive to their community's 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
An examination of Hawkey's record yields a picture of an embattled city manager 
struggling to overcome problems he inherited; making significant reforms and 
taking decisive action, but perhaps lacking in sensitivity in a community 
already divided racially. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkey arrived in Toledo as the hand-picked candidate of then-Mayor Donna 
Owens, a Republican. His predecessor had lost $19 million in city money that 
had been placed illegally in a Florida real estate brokerage that went 
belly-up. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkey came with the understanding that he would clean house and re-establish 
the city's financial soundness, which he immediately set about doing. He also 
had to deal with racial problems. 
</P>
<P>
His most vocal critic -- who showed up in Pasadena Tuesday -- is the Rev. Floyd 
Rose, pastor of Family Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
With a fuzzy croak of a voice and a tendency to break out into high-pitched, 
mocking laughter in the midst of serious political discussions, Rose would seem 
an unlikely man to galvanize the black community. But in 1986, Rose grabbed 
headlines in Toledo when he organized protest rallies over a black youth who 
had allegedly been beaten by Toledo police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Later, when three black teen-agers were arrested for the beating -- and charges 
were dropped against two police officers who had been arrested in the case -- 
the incident became known, Rose said, as "the City Park Incident or the Floyd 
Rose Fiasco." The officers later filed successful grievances against the city. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkey handled that first racial conflict well, Rose said, but there was more 
to come. 
</P>
<P>
In a reorganization of city government that was one of his first major actions, 
Hawkey made eight high-level administrative appointments, none of them blacks 
or women, Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to criticism of those appointments, Hawkey points out that five of 
his 14 top administrators now are black. 
</P>
<P>
City job statistics show that the number of blacks in top administrative 
positions has more than doubled under Hawkey. The percentage of all minorities 
in top administrative positions is now 22.8%, compared with 12.7% when Hawkey 
took the job in May, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a city study soon to be released will show that blacks, who 
constitute 17.4% of Toledo's population of 343,000, hold jobs in Toledo city 
government in a percentage above their representation in the work force, said 
Toledo affirmative action specialist Gloria Ruiz. But Hawkey's image was formed 
with that first reorganization. That was the backdrop for what would become the 
most volatile racial situation of his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
In June 1988, Hawkey discharged Pete Culp, a black administrator in the 
Community Development Department who oversaw $1.5 million annually in federal 
Housing and Urban Development money. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a long history of disparate treatment toward black folks at City 
Hall," said Councilman Jack Ford, the only black on the City Council. "The only 
area that blacks were given an opportunity to manage at the highest levels was 
Community Development. It was kind of seen as a black reservation." 
</P>
<P>
Given that history, many blacks were not persuaded by Hawkey's explanation that 
Culp's dismissal was necessary because HUD was freezing city funds due to what 
the federal officials called "gross mismanagement." 
</P>
<P>
Hawkey appointed an "Intervention Team" of city employees, who examined the 
housing fund files. The team found federal money had been given out, and no 
applications or documentation existed for many of the grants. 
</P>
<P>
Some city employees had received federal money in violation of federal 
regulations. Also, applicants with high incomes that disqualified them from 
some programs had nonetheless received money. 
</P>
<P>
And some prominent black activists were among those awarded money by Culp, 
including Rose and Lee Williams, head of the Toledo chapter of the NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
An independent audit conducted later by the firm of Deloitte Haskins &amp; 
Sells made similar findings. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Rose, Williams and other black activists rallied to Culp's defense, asking 
for public hearings on the matter. They also argued that separate standards 
existed for blacks and whites in Toledo. 
</P>
<P>
Whites, such as former city manager David Boston, who were caught in 
illegalities still escaped with pensions, sick leave and severance pay, said 
Michael Frank, Culp's attorney. Other whites faced disciplinary demotions but 
retained city jobs. Yet Culp was dismissed, and all his benefits denied. 
</P>
<P>
When their arguments failed to move the council, Rose and 12 other black 
ministers staged a sit-in, refusing to budge from the City Council chairs and 
forcing their arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"We started raising questions, and we were totally ignored, as if we were 
nothing and nobody," Rose said, explaining the reason for the sit-in. "You 
can't just ignore people; something's got to happen." 
</P>
<P>
The sit-in and arrests prompted hearings that December in Toledo by the Ohio 
Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. The committee issued 
a report saying there were racial problems in Toledo. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Ohio Civil Rights Commission, through which Culp had filed a 
racial discrimination claim, found last August there was probable cause that 
Culp had been discriminated against. A hearing on the matter is pending before 
the rights commission, and Culp's suit against the city is pending in federal 
court. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bob Dolin, HUD regional office manager in Columbus, Ohio, said 
Hawkey's administration had cleared up the problems with Toledo's management of 
federal housing funds. A yearlong freeze was lifted two months ago, and Toledo 
got $500,000 in HUD money, Dolin said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Culp incident polarized black sentiment about Hawkey, 
Councilman Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
Although some blacks, such as the Rev. Lyman Liggins, former pastor of the 
Toledo A.M.E. Church and now a minister in Cleveland, back Hawkey, "a lot of 
the black community just gave up on City Hall," Ford said. "The damage is still 
there, as far as I can tell." 
</P>
<P>
A third element to Hawkey's troubled tenure in Toledo has been the role played 
by the Toledo Blade, the city's 150,000-circulation daily newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Co-publisher and editor-in-chief John Robinson Block, 35, a newspaper heir who 
sports moussed long hair and pinstriped suits, acknowledges that his paper 
covered Hawkey more aggressively and personally than it usually would cover an 
unelected official. "Most of the past city managers were technocrats," he said. 
"Phil Hawkey had a personality." 
</P>
<P>
Block insisted that the newspaper had been fair and said his reporters have a 
tradition of aggressive investigative stories on Toledo issues. 
</P>
<P>
On its editorial pages, the Blade has pushed for the past 33 years for a 
strong-mayor form of government. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkey supporter and Republican party member Michael Murray contends that the 
Blade's editorial position has spilled over into its reporting, with an 
outpouring of negative press on Hawkey. 
</P>
<P>
"We have always had to fight the newspaper over the strong-mayor issue," Murray 
said. "Because of that treatment, the negativism and the way the Blade is 
treating the racial issue in Toledo -- making a mountain out of a molehill -- 
we have undertaken a campaign to bring another daily newspaper to the city of 
Toledo." 
</P>
<P>
With the help of attorney Jim Godbey and Susan Hauenstein, a former president 
of the Toledo League of Women Voters, Murray has circulated petitions and 
solicited donations to find a newspaper willing to take on the Blade. 
</P>
<P>
Then, last November, Owens was defeated by Democrat John McHugh, who joined 
seven other Democrats on the nine-member council in telling Hawkey to begin 
looking for a new job. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite political and media onslaughts, we have had dramatic reforms in Toledo 
city government," Hawkey said. "If the test is to hire people with no 
controversy, then it's possible you could have someone who never did anything."

FIERRO SELECTED AS MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council unanimously chose Evelyn Fierro as mayor and Dick Richards as 
mayor pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
Fierro, 41, a former television news journalist who last fall started a public 
relations firm, is in her first term on the council. 
</P>
<P>
She was elected to the four-year position in 1988. She also is running as a 
Democrat for the 42nd District Assembly seat held by Republican Richard 
Mountjoy of Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
A retired FBI agent, Richards, 68, is a businessman. He won his seat in a 
special election last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many other San Gabriel Valley cities, South Pasadena selects its mayor 
and mayor pro tem once a year, rather than allowing the positions to rotate 
among five council members during a four-year period.

</P>
<P>
"Television and radio play an active part in modern society's democratic 
process," Planning Commissioner Clair Harmony said Monday in a press release. 
</P>
<P>
Council meetings also may be televised soon. Jones Intercable of Walnut Valley, 
which has 16,000 subscribers in Diamond Bar and Rowland Heights, has offered to

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SOUTH PASADENA; 
</P>
<P>
BUILDING BAN PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two councilmen, complaining of inadequate building codes, have proposed a 
short-term moratorium on residential and commercial construction. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen James C. Hodge Jr. and Dick Richards last week brought up the 
proposal, which may come to a vote Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"What has become very apparent is that most city (building and planning) codes, 
while they give a guideline, have been inadequate," Hodge said. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of a temporary ban stems from a recent controversy about the 
development of a two-story office building at the intersection of Fremont 
Avenue and Huntington Drive, he said. The council earlier this month voted 4 to 
1 to approve the project, with Richards dissenting. But Hodge said he "agreed 
(with Richards that) it was a nightmarish process for the public, council and 
developer as well." 
</P>
<P>
The ban, to last at least 45 days, would give city officials time to come up 
with code revisions concerning density, design, height, and size of residential 
and commercial projects, the councilmen said. Hodge said he hopes the city will 
also create a design review committee.

MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS CLEARLY DON'T FANCY CATS 
</P>

<P>
A no-cats crackdown at the Vista Del Monte Mobilehome Park has turned into an 
emotional tussle between the park's owners and feline-owning tenants, who have 
been given seven days to find another home for their pets or face eviction. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Baum, a 14-year tenant of the Jeffries Avenue park, received her notice 
Saturday. "I was scared to death when I read that," said Baum, a 74-year-old 
widow, who has obtained a note from her doctor stating that the cat is 
important to her emotional and mental health. 
</P>
<P>
"She keeps me up," Baum said of Susie, a black-and-white, declawed longhair. 
"It's just like another person in the house." 
</P>
<P>
One of the park owners admits he has tolerated cats before -- even though their 
presence violates park rules -- as long as the animals caused no trouble. But 
Charles Ettensperger, 64, says he and his wife have now been forced to take 
action against cats after complaints from other tenants about wandering pets. 
</P>
<P>
"A number of people have snuck cats in at times, but it has been under 
control," said Dorothy Ettensperger, 59. "In the last couple of months, it's 
gotten out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
She said at least two families have gotten rid of their cats -- one was put to 
sleep -- since an initial 30-day warning was distributed in February. She added 
that she has published reminders of the no-pet rule in the park's monthly 
newsletter over the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband said he has been willing to look the other way in the past, but not 
now. "They urinate on people's doormats and tear up their furniture." One woman 
recently complained of more than 15 cats -- none of them hers -- on her front 
porch, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But cat fanciers blame the trouble on strays and on a minority of residents who 
let their pets run loose. Three tenants have retained an attorney to stave off 
eviction. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, Diana Hill, 54, said she is determined not to part with Pandora, a 
slinky, 14-year-old black cat with an expressive tail. 
</P>
<P>
"She's been my companion for the past 12 1/2 years, and she's seen me through 
some very rough times," said Hill, who is single. "She's who I come home to." 
</P>
<P>
Her attorney, Margaret Bonertz, is contending that "the law views a rule that 
has not been enforced for over 10 years as null and void." 
</P>
<P>
Beach Kokanour, 85, has already given her two cats, This and That, to a friend. 
"We just felt really heartbroken," she said. "People have had pets in this park 
ever since they came and they never bothered anyone. I think it stinks." 
</P>
<P>
Hope Phillips, 55, said she and her husband have decided to sell their mobile 
home and move, rather than part with their pet of six years, Tanya. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Ettensperger maintains that she had no idea there were so many illicit 
cats -- about 10 -- on the grounds, although she had suspicions. "Once in a 
while you see a cat in the window and you wonder, but you can't prove 
anything," she said. Previously, when she has confronted suspected cat-owners, 
they have said the animals were just visiting. 
</P>
<P>
Ettensperger said she and her husband are distributing the warnings as a last 
resort. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of those things we didn't want to do. We're caught between the devil 
and the deep blue sea."

'CITY OF HEALTH' CHOSEN FOR TEST; 
</P>
<P>
DUARTE: RESIDENTS WILL RECEIVE A PROTOTYPE HEALTH GUIDE TO HELP DETERMINE THE 
BEST DISTRIBUTION METHODS AND ASSESS THE PUBLIC'S REACTIONS.

<TEXT>
<P>
The city, whose motto is "City of Health," has been selected by the state as 
the testing ground for a new Wellness Guide. 
</P>
<P>
A prototype of the guide, developed in a joint effort by the Office of 
Prevention of the California Department of Mental Health and UC Berkeley, was 
introduced Wednesday at a public health conference in Los Angeles. Duarte is 
scheduled to start distributing the guides to the city's 8,000 households on 
June 9. 
</P>
<P>
Produced by the School of Public Health at UC Berkeley, the resource guide 
covers a broad range of health-related topics, including pregnancy, child care, 
physical fitness and aging. The four-year program has a budget of $600,000, 
state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte was chosen by the state as a pilot city because of its involvement in 
the "Healthy Cities Project," introduced last year by UC Berkeley and the state 
Department of Health Services to promote community health projects. 
</P>
<P>
All cities in the state were asked to come up with project proposals. Ten 
cities sent in full applications. The state selected seven of them, including 
Duarte, to receive technical guidance from state officials in developing their 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte's proposal was to develop a health resource directory to be distributed 
to all city residents. The city is putting together the guide now for 
distribution in the fall. Officials say it will complement the Wellness Guide 
by providing more local information. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only were we excited about Duarte's project, but we thought, 'What an 
ideal place to test our Wellness Guide,' " said Charles Roppel, chief of the 
Office of Prevention for the Department of Mental Health. "They were very eager 
to help in any way they could." 
</P>
<P>
Using anecdotes, photographs and illustrations, the Wellness Guide shows people 
how to deal with health issues such as depression, teen pregnancy, caring for 
the elderly, and drug and alcohol abuse. The guide also discusses ways of 
finding community support networks. 
</P>
<P>
Each section of the guide offers toll-free 800 numbers for crisis and support 
networks. The producers of the guide have also been working with phone 
companies and directory publishers, including Pacific Bell, GTE and the 
Hispanic Yellow Pages, to standardize the community service listings in local 
Yellow Pages so they match the Wellness Guide's page-by-page listings. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first of its kind in the universe," said Dr. Linda Neuhauser, UC 
Berkeley's evaluation director for the guide. "We're hoping that this will be a 
catalyst for health education throughout the state by sending out the message 
that a healthy lifestyle starts at home." 
</P>
<P>
Program officials intend to distribute the free, 80-page guide to every 
household in the state by 1991. Before that deadline, Duarte will serve as a 
pilot city to research the best methods of distribution and to assess the 
public's impressions of the guide. 
</P>
<P>
"We were notified of our selection about six months ago, and ever since then, 
we've been working on this nonstop," said Terry Fitzgerald, Duarte's 
coordinator for the Wellness Guide. "We want people to recognize the value of 
the guide, and not think that it's just an advertisement." 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Duarte, which has a population of 22,000, have rounded up about 50 
community volunteers who will hand-deliver half of the guides to 4,000 homes. 
The other half will be mailed to residents to determine which method of 
distribution works better. 
</P>
<P>
"For the past few months, I've been going to different clubs and organizations, 
church groups, schools and businesses, trying to recruit volunteers," said Sue 
Lawrence, Duarte's director of volunteers. "A lot of seniors who are in walking 
clubs said they will deliver the guides in the neighborhoods that they walk 
in." 
</P>
<P>
The guide, which will be available in English and Spanish, will be packaged 
with a short letter from the city, an evaluation form to mail back and a 
six-page mini-telephone book of local health and social service providers 
printed by GTE. The numbers in the mini-book will also appear in the community 
access section of the regular GTE phone book when it is published in December. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte Mayor John Fasana said the city's involvement with the Wellness Guide 
has brought the community together. "I give all credit to the citizens. . . . 
It's really nice to know that our citizens will be the first to use the guide 
and input what the rest of the state will read."

MANY IMPORTANT ISSUES IN MONTEREY PARK VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In regard to the article "Ethnic Groups Give the Nod to Tolerance" (Times, 
April 15), I was interviewed extensively for this article and tried to 
emphasize the importance of issues other than just those of ethnicity. While 
the defeat of an anti-immigrant stance was significant, there were also other 
aspects which the article failed to cover although they were said in my 
interview: 
</P>
<P>
1. There were other issues, not just ethnic tensions, which were very important 
in this (Monterey Park) election. In door-to-door walking, I found that voters 
were concerned about problems in the Police Department, the city deficit, the 
need for diversity in businesses and the need to control growth. Consequently, 
while voters did vote out the incumbents, they also strongly supported 
Proposition S, a measure to control growth in the city. 
</P>
<P>
2. Barry Hatch wasn't defeated just because voters perceived he had an 
anti-immigrant stand. Even some voters who supported him in the last election 
had become disgusted with what one former supporter called his antics of "being 
against everything" without "proposing positive solutions to anything." Some I 
talked to pointed to his calls for the resignation of the city manager and for 
an independent city audit, after the city had just completed one, as examples 
of knee-jerk proposals with no substance. 
</P>
<P>
3. There has been an anti-incumbent trend in San Gabriel Valley city elections 
for a time now. Voters, concerned about growth, pollution, crowded freeways, 
lack of affordable housing, reduced human services and the loss of revenues at 
the local level, are taking out their frustrations on whoever is in office. 
With drastic cuts at the national and state level, local municipalities are 
unable to solve these problems themselves. Regional coordination is a must. 
However, many city councils, pressured by resident interest groups, insist on 
protecting their autonomy. Cities such as Monterey Park are faced with the dual 
challenge of controlling growth, which can cause revenue loss and unaffordable 
housing, while maintaining services without burdening residents and small 
businesses with higher taxes. 
</P>
<P>
4. While there is a trend toward more participation in the political process by 
Asian and Latino voters throughout the San Gabriel Valley, there is also a 
trend to look beyond ethnicity to the issues that the candidates are advocating 
or not advocating. The Chinese candidate in Monterey Park, Sam Kiang, picked up 
broad support in all precincts, including those which didn't have large Latino 
or Asian concentrations. In many city elections and in state races throughout 
the Valley, Latinos have been running against Latinos. What has separated them, 
in many cases, has been their different positions on issues. As Latinos and 
Asians become more active in the electoral arena, their agendas will be just as 
significant as their ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
While ethnic issues are important, there are other encompassing issues, beneath 
the surface, which equally play a major role in creating either the conditions 
for tension and tolerance or genuine harmony and coalition-building.

NORTHWEST PASADENA SAID SHORTCHANGED

<TEXT>
<P>
The plan launched five years ago to revitalize the mostly minority 
neighborhoods of Northwest Pasadena has not been properly funded, and no 
substantive gains have been made, according to a report presented Tuesday to 
the Board of Directors by a city advisory committee. 
</P>
<P>
The 13-member Northwest Task Force, which has been studying the Northwest Plan 
for the last eight months, stated in its report that the plan is a sound 
concept designed to enhance human services, housing and economic development 
for what long has been a neglected corner of town. 
</P>
<P>
But a lack of clear priorities and the failure to come up with a proposed $35 
million to implement the plan doomed it from the start, the report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
"We find the Northwest Plan was undone and under-finished," said the task 
force's chairwoman, Melba Guy. "The city has failed to bring the Northwest into 
the mainstream of Pasadena life." 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Donald McIntyre, who task force members contended should be held 
accountable for the failure, said he is preparing a formal response to the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very critical, and perhaps, most of that is appropriate," McIntyre said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the plan originally was hailed as a $35-million infusion into 
Northwest Pasadena, which is home to about one-third of the city's residents, a 
budget shortfall quickly trimmed that figure by about $10 million. Of the 
remaining $25 million, much came from grants that would have been allocated to 
the Northwest even if there had been no plan, said the report. 
</P>
<P>
"There has to be a better sensitizing to just how important this is," City 
Director Chris Holden said. "If we don't give it that kind of commitment, what 
you ultimately end up with is a sham."

NIGHT LIFE THE CLUB SCENE: SURF MUSIC STILL RIDES WITH TIDE;

CALIFORNIA BEACH PARTY

" . . . And you'll never hear surf music again. . . . " -- Jimi Hendrix. 
</P>
<P>
As the guitarist of all time, he's in there; but as a musical seer, forget it. 
Surf music, a musical genre indigenous to Southern California, never really 
went away. 
</P>
<P>
But then we know that anyone in rock 'n' roll who ever played or sang a note 
will either come back or refuse to go away. And in rock, even being dead isn't 
half the dodge it used to be. Hendrix, Steve Goodman, Muddy Waters and Buddy 
Holly are still releasing records. 
</P>
<P>
Every other station on the AM dial is seemingly playing oldies, which in turn, 
accounts for those ubiquitous Glad-to-Be-Working-Tours, a portion of which will 
pull up this weekend in Ventura. The Poinsettia City, you see, is sponsoring a 
three-day beach bash beginning Friday night with sort of a soiree on the sand. 
</P>
<P>
The fifth annual California Beach Party will, one hopes, be more than a thinly 
veiled excuse to make us pay to park and to offer the City Council an 
opportunity to look silly in Hawaiian shirts. 
</P>
<P>
The whole affair is intended to be a '60s-type beach party, somehow homogenized 
and made safe for the '90s. It's all about Frankie &amp; Annette, hangin' 10 on 
that long board and cruisin' for the beautiful, blond California girls, in 
short, the Southern California beach lifestyle as immortalized by The Beach 
Boys, and this weekend's headliners, Jan &amp; Dean. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, life on the beach in Ventura was different in 1965. There was 
plenty of room to park (for free), no hotels, no broken glass, no lifeguards 
telling you not to swim near the pier, no zillion people per wave. You could 
have a party on the beach, build a fire on the beach -- have fun at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Berry and Dean Torrence, Jan &amp; Dean, were second only to the Beach Boys 
when it came to hyping the Southern California life style. What at the time 
seemed like an innocent celebration of the Endless Summer, now 25 years later, 
finds the Golden State overbuilt, overcrowded, over-polluted and out of water. 
Thus, should we sign a petition to deport Jan &amp; Dean for causing grievous 
damage to Southern California or should we go see them Saturday night at the 
Holiday Inn because "Surf City" still has a good beat? 
</P>
<P>
Jan &amp; Dean, both West Los Angeles locals, met in high school and had a 
string of hits from the late '50s to the mid-'60s, such as "Heart and Soul," 
"Linda," "Tennessee," "Baby Talk" and a No. 1 hit written by Brian Wilson, 
"Surf City" -- every fin-head's dream where there are "two girls for every boy. 
. . ." And who can forget "The Little Old Lady From Pasadena," "Honolulu Lulu," 
"Ride the Wild Surf" or the first ever skateboard song, "Sidewalk Surfin'?" 
</P>
<P>
Then in 1966, Berry crashed his Corvette into a parked truck on Sunset 
Boulevard in a scary example of life imitating art, in this case, the duo's 
biggie, "Deadman's Curve." 
</P>
<P>
Berry was in a coma for months, suffered major brain damage and was unable to 
move or speak. But after years of grueling rehabilitation, he is able to 
perform again. And so shall it be Saturday night at the Ventura Holiday Inn. 
</P>
<P>
Other old guys, who still rock and who will be on hand for the beach party, 
include The Coasters -- a vocal group that first debuted in 1955. They have had 
personnel changes to rival the noon shift at McDonald's and lots of hits, 
including "Charley Brown," "Yakety Yak," "Along Came Jones," "Little Egypt" and 
"Poison Ivy." 
</P>
<P>
Also performing this weekend will be Bobby Day, Donnie Brooks, The Bombers, The 
Chantays and The Gentrys. See you at the beach -- just don't park in my spot. .

TRENDS: SPECIALIZED SUMMER PROGRAMS CATER TO CHILDREN'S INTERESTS IN EVERYTHING 
FROM SPORTS TO MONEY MANAGEMENT. BUT COMPUTERS ARE PASSE.

<P>
Summer camp used to be simple. The kids went off for a week to Camp Cowabunga, 
where they learned to swim, paddle a canoe and make potholders. 
</P>
<P>
Now most head for day camp as Mom and Dad head for work. Camp might be anything 
from an intensive week of gymnastics instruction to a two-week crash course in 
drama ending with a production of "Peter Pan." 
</P>
<P>
Summer camp has changed with the times. With increasing numbers of two-income 
families, more day camps have sprung up not only to provide summer fun but also 
to fill a need for summertime day care. 
</P>
<P>
Also, more camps are specializing. By the end of a week, Junior may not know a 
paddle from a potholder, but his tennis strokes could zing with precision. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura, the city's recreation department took the lead when it started 
offering specialized camps five years ago. A budding tennis great can get two 
weeks' worth of instruction and play for $120. Other weeklong sports camps 
offered by the city include volleyball, gymnastics, fitness and soccer. Not to 
mention beach camp -- complete with sailing, windsurfing and volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
If your kid isn't a sports nut, he can plunge into arts, dance and nature 
camps, or the popular "Camp Combo," which combines them all. 
</P>
<P>
Travel camp buses kids daily to spots such as Universal Studios and the Santa 
Barbara Zoo. If roughing it sounds appealing, residence camp offers a five-day 
stay in cabins near Lake Cachuma in Santa Barbara County for $165. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest hit is "Camp MTV," a mixture of music, theater and visual arts. 
Working two weeks under the direction of artist Caryn Cheney and musician Jan 
Palmer, 30 children, 7 to 12 years old, will produce "Snow White" this summer. 
They'll rehearse daily, prepare sets from old refrigerator cartons and help 
make costumes. 
</P>
<P>
The specialized camps -- which originated because parents no longer have the 
time to shuttle their children to lessons in one thing and another -- fill up 
fast. Registration this year opens April 28. 
</P>
<P>
Activities start at 9 a.m., "and parents get there at 7 a.m.," said Jenise 
Heck-Rosene, senior recreation leader for the camps. "A lot of parents say they 
wish they could go." 
</P>
<P>
The camps run from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., from June 18 through Aug. 24. Kids 
frequently migrate from camp to camp all summer, spending a week at one camp 
and the next week at another. 
</P>
<P>
Other Ventura County communities also offer daylong camps to accommodate 
working parents. Some are an extension of after-school programs, such as those 
offered by the Boys and Girls Clubs, but with a few added treats for summer 
fun. 
</P>
<P>
At $45 a week, Oxnard's Camp Serendipity is the most inexpensive. The children 
swim, do arts and crafts, play sports and learn about drama. Boys and girls 
learn how to bake bread, prepare Italian and Mexican dishes and put together 
Mulligan stew.

<P>
Once a month, they visit Disneyland or Knott's Berry Farm. Each week, they're 
off to ride horses, stroll around the Santa Barbara Zoo or play miniature golf. 
</P>
<P>
"For 90% of them, it's their first time horseback riding," said Michelle Izay, 
recreation supervisor for the city. 
</P>
<P>
The Conejo Recreation and Park District in Thousand Oaks also offers a special 
day camp for emotionally or physically disabled children. Twelve children, ages 
6 to 12, spend four days paddling around a pool, playing ball and, in general, 
doing what other kids do at summer camp. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of them are in wheelchairs," said Cindy Rocklein, recreation director 
for the therapeutic camp. "They play volleyball with a beach ball. Volunteers 
help move their arms. Nobody sits around." 
</P>
<P>
Now that the children of baby boomers are swelling the camp-age population, 
more kids than ever are going to camp, according to Gary Abell, spokesman for 
the American Camping Assn. in Indianapolis. Five years ago, 4 million children 
across the country struck off for overnight or day camp. Last year, the number 
was up to 5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Water sports, wilderness and fitness camps are big. But computer camp is 
history, according to Abell. Computers are more accessible now; they're used in 
schools, and the novelty has worn off. 
</P>
<P>
In Thousand Oaks, Mitch Leichter first opened his Young Set Club to day campers 
seven years ago. The five-acre grounds include an Olympic-size swimming pool, a 
clubhouse with video games and an archery range -- all in a rustic setting 
frequented by rabbits, squirrels and deer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the last of the dinosaurs in Thousand Oaks," Leichter said. 
</P>
<P>
The camp is a big operation. About 150 to 200 kids are enrolled at a cost of 
$85 a week. An equal number drop in for swimming lessons daily. Leichter has a 
full-time staff of 25 to 35 counselors and 10 water instructors. 
</P>
<P>
His campers take jaunts to Magic Mountain or Knott's Berry Farm. They go 
horseback riding. They compete in creative songfests once a week for the most 
energetic and inspired performances. 
</P>
<P>
But the high point is an overnight camp-out on the grounds -- complete with a 
visit from the legendary creature "Uncle Gor," an escaped "gorilla that 
supposedly lives nearby." 
</P>
<P>
"We light a bonfire to welcome Uncle Gor," Leichter said. When the creature 
appears, the children throw bananas at him. They top off the evening with a 
barbecue and roasted marshmallows. 
</P>
<P>
Leichter likes to think of himself as doing a bit of social work in addition to 
providing a healthy play environment. He recruited males for half his 
counseling positions because about half of his children come from broken homes. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't have a daddy figure," he said." 
</P>
<P>
Not all camps are geared toward day care. Not all are affordable. 
</P>
<P>
If your kid is into lions, lizards and lemurs, you might try zoo camp in Santa 
Barbara. Kids 3 to 11 years old can attend camp at the Santa Barbara Zoo from 9 
a.m. to 2 p.m. Under supervision, they can fondle a snake and mingle with 
birds, goats, rabbits and other animals. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of zoo camp is a camp-out and nighttime safari through the zoo 
grounds. During the day the children also learn crafts, games and songs -- most 
of them revolving around animals and nature. It costs $20 a day, or $80 to $90 
a week. 
</P>
<P>
For overnight campers, the choices are slim in Ventura County. The YMCA and 
other groups, such as Easter Seals, Scouts and Campfire, send kids to overnight 
camps outside the county, in Lake Cachuma, Big Bear, Santa Catalina Island or 
Frazier Park. 
</P>
<P>
But a few specialized camps in the Ojai area take boarders. The theme at Tecuya 
Shores, a Girl Scout camp near Oakview, is water sports -- windsurfing, 
snorkeling and boogie-boarding. 
</P>
<P>
For nine nights, the girls -- fifth-graders and older -- sleep on cots outside. 
When they're waterlogged, they can go horseback riding. The sessions, at $270, 
are popular, and already they are nearly full for this summer. 
</P>
<P>
By far the most expensive overnight camp is at the Ojai Valley School, a 
79-year-old boarding school offering a summer program that combines academics 
and recreation. 
</P>
<P>
"Mom and Dad pick our camp," said Gary Gartrell, director of the summer 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The camp draws mostly from Los Angeles, although its day camp attracts local 
residents, Gartrell said. The cost is $2,825 for six weeks of resident camp -- 
or $1,670 for three weeks.

GIVING CHILDREN A TASTE OF LIFE ON A FARM; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTRY: A CAMP OUTSIDE SANTA PAULA INTRODUCES YOUNGSTERS TO HORSEBACK RIDING 
AND MAKING BUTTER.

The goats aren't just for show at the Painted Pony Day Camp outside Santa 
Paula. 
</P>
<P>
Young campers at this real-life farm tucked into the mountains learn how to 
milk the goats, sometimes at the risk of getting squirted in the face. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not all. They also strain and pasteurize the milk, and, using eggs 
from farm chickens, they make ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
"Every part of camp is a learning experience, but it's also fun," said Pam 
Colvard, who runs the day camp with her husband, Steve, a Santa Paula 
elementary school teacher. 
</P>
<P>
They are getting ready for their second summer of operation. They offer 
weeklong sessions from June 25 through Aug. 24 for children 4 to 9 years of 
age. The days run from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at a weekly cost of $80. 
</P>
<P>
The camp is on five acres owned by the Colvards, about six miles outside Santa 
Paula on the road to Ojai. With their children -- Ashley, 7, and Nicholas, 5 -- 
they live in a yellow farmhouse they built themselves three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Colvard has been a teacher in Santa Paula for 15 years, but his dream has 
always been to run a farm. He started two years ago with five goats. Gradually, 
he added horses, cows, rabbits, lambs, pigs, chickens and ducks. 
</P>
<P>
The livestock collection was an immediate attraction for people traveling 
Highway 150. They would stop and ask to pet the animals. The popularity of the 
animals led to the petting farm and country store the Colvards opened in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Colvard is no gentleman farmer. He's up at 5:30 to milk the 19 goats. He 
milks them again at 5:30 in the afternoon. He cleans the corrals and pens 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is he a newcomer to summer camps. He ran a summer program for gifted 
children for five years. Pam Colvard previously taught preschool. 
</P>
<P>
The weekly camp sessions are small -- no more than 20 children at a time -- and 
that suits the Colvards just fine. 
</P>
<P>
"We like it that just Steve and I are with the kids," Pam Colvard said. 
</P>
<P>
Each day of camp focuses on a different type of animal. On Tuesday, when it's 
horses, they ride the pony. They learn to feed the animals and handle them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good for the children to learn they have responsibilities, that the 
animals depend on them for food," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The children also try gardening. Using child-size garden tools, they learn how 
to plant vegetable seeds and water them using a dam and canal-like system of 
irrigation the children call "raging waters." 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the week, they've had a real taste of farm life. They've made 
butter from whipping cream by shaking it in a one-gallon jar. They've eaten the 
fresh butter on crackers and sipped buttermilk for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, the Colvards plan to add some special features. The children will 
see a sheep sheared and the wool spun into yarn. A beekeeper will bring his 
bees. And a Chumash Indian expert will talk to the children. A Chumash burial 
ground is near the farm. 
</P>
<P>
The camp isn't all farm activity. The children sing camp songs, hear stories 
and work on crafts. They dress up and act out stories. 
</P>
<P>
Behind their house, the Colvards have a 15- by 30-foot fenced swimming pool. 
Both are certified water safety instructors. 
</P>
<P>
For more information about the camp, call 525-9820.

CHORUS PREPARES FOR CARNEGIE HALL DATE

Ventura County's barbershop-style Channelaire Chorus is gearing up for a 
performance at Carnegie Hall in New York May 8. The 83-member group has been 
invited to perform under the direction of Peter Tiboris, music director for the 
Manhattan Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Ashmore, the group's musical director, said nobody seems to be 
particularly anxious. "We've done enough performances not to be," she said. 
"It's more excitement than nervousness." 
</P>
<P>
But one thing does worry Ashmore. "They were surprised to hear we were coming 
in full costume," she said of the show's organizers. "It makes me wonder what 
they normally do in Carnegie Hall." 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Mulchay, owner of E M Interiors in Oxnard and Camarillo, was in 
Osaka, Japan, last month working on a client's five-story condominium. Though 
she studied Japanese culture for six months before the trip and says she read 
"Business Tokyo Magazine," she still was struck by some differences: 
</P>
<P>
Cost of Housing: "He has a 3,500-square-foot condominium that he paid $5 
million for. The average American would be appalled -- he doesn't even have a 
fireplace." 
</P>
<P>
Subcontractors: "The construction foremen came to work in suits -- shirts, 
ties, smocks and hard hats. These workmen would take off their shoes and put on 
their slippers when they went into a room with carpeting. I knew the Japanese 
took off their shoes inside, but I didn't know that extended to construction." 
</P>
<P>
Toilets: "I was working in the bathroom when I saw this toilet. I asked him 
what kind it was, and he said, 'It's a Japanese toilet.' It was a bidet. He 
said, 'It will flush the water and then it will dry you.' It's got hot air." 
</P>
<P>
Overheard at the Ventura YMCA . . . 
</P>
<P>
First mother: "You've got to stop your child from peeing in the pool." 
</P>
<P>
Second mother: "All the kids pee in the pool." 
</P>
<P>
First mother: "Yeah, but not off the high dive." 
</P>
<P>
(Footnote: Fortunately, there is no high dive at the Y.) 
</P>
<P>
Selling Girl Scout cookies in Oxnard is a family affair. Troop 729 finished 
first in Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties this year, thanks 
in large part to Alicia Johnson, the No. 1 seller in the tri-county area. 
Meanwhile, Alicia's mother, Cherie, was the cookie co-chairwoman for Oxnard and 
had to store about 2,000 cases of the goodies in her garage. 
</P>
<P>
So who would know better than the Johnsons which cookies people gobbled up and 
which ones they didn't? The most popular? "Thin mints," Cherie said. "They made 
up about 85% of the sales." And the least popular? "The Golden Yangles. They're 
for people who don't eat sweets."

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
PRICE-FIXING ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By a vote of 235 to 157, the House sent to the Senate a bill to help plaintiffs 
win lawsuits against vertical price-fixing, which occurs when manufacturers 
seek to enforce a minimum product price. The bill (HR 1236) eases Supreme 
Court-set standards of evidence that make it easy for judges to dismiss such 
suits. It gives plaintiffs a better chance of advancing their case to a jury. 
</P>
<P>
The bill is backed by discounters such as Burlington Coat Factory and K mart 
and opposed by business groups such as the Chamber of Commerce and National 
Assn. of Manufacturers, according to floor debate. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Dan Glickman (D-Kan.) urged colleagues to "vote for your constituents 
who can't afford to shop at full-price retailers." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent G. V. (Sonny) Montgomery (D-Miss.) said the bill's defeat would 
"preserve the freedom of manufacturers . . . to determine how their products 
are marketed and serviced." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

Substitute Bill 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 155 to 242, the House rejected a substitute version of the bill 
(above) to combat vertical price-fixing. The amendment sought to preserve 
exacting standards of evidence that plaintiffs, such as discounters suing 
manufacturers, must satisfy under 1984 and 1988 Supreme Court rulings. It also 
attempted to codify the 1911 court ruling that vertical price-fixing is 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Chuck Douglas (R-N.H.) said Congress should "not fool around with 
Supreme Court decisions" that have evolved over the decades. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Lawrence J. (Larry) Smith (D-Fla.) said the amendment "would kill this 
bill." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the substitute.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE;

<P>
PRICE-FIXING ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By a vote of 235 to 157, the House sent to the Senate a bill to help plaintiffs 
win lawsuits against vertical price-fixing, which occurs when manufacturers 
seek to enforce a minimum product price. The bill (HR 1236) eases Supreme 
Court-set standards of evidence that make it easy for judges to dismiss such 
suits. It gives plaintiffs a better chance of advancing their case to a jury. 
</P>
<P>
The bill is backed by discounters such as Burlington Coat Factory and K mart 
and opposed by business groups such as the Chamber of Commerce and National 
Assn. of Manufacturers, according to floor debate. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Dan Glickman (D-Kan.) urged colleagues to "vote for your constituents 
who can't afford to shop at full-price retailers." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent G. V. (Sonny) Montgomery (D-Miss.) said the bill's defeat would 
"preserve the freedom of manufacturers . . . to determine how their products 
are marketed and serviced." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

Substitute Bill 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 155 to 242, the House rejected a substitute version of the bill 
(above) to combat vertical price-fixing. The amendment sought to preserve 
exacting standards of evidence that plaintiffs, such as discounters suing 
manufacturers, must satisfy under 1984 and 1988 Supreme Court rulings. It also 
attempted to codify the 1911 court ruling that vertical price-fixing is 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Chuck Douglas (R-N.H.) said Congress should "not fool around with 
Supreme Court decisions" that have evolved over the decades. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Lawrence J. (Larry) Smith (D-Fla.) said the amendment "would kill this 
bill." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the substitute.

<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney today proposed cuts of $14.3 billion in the 
embattled B-2 Stealth bomber program as part of a $34.8-billion package of 
warplane reductions aimed at taking advantage of warming East-West relations. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, in testimony before the House Armed Services Committee, said he would 
cut the number of Stealth bombers to 75 planes rather than the 132 originally 
planned over the life of the program being developed by Century City-based 
Northrop Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The sleek, black bat-wing Stealth, at $530 million, is the most expensive 
aircraft ever. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney announced the proposals to the House Armed Services Committee, and 
several members expressed surprise, saying the high cost of fewer B-2 bombers 
would drive the cost of each one up to $815 million. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said if the B-2 force were cut to as few as 30 planes, as some critics 
have proposed, "it isn't much good to you, frankly." 
</P>
<P>
He said two B-2 groups of 30 bombers would each be required for a credible 
bomber force and another 15 would be needed to maintain the two full wings. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop Corp.'s first Stealth test model flew for the first time last year and 
is scheduled for deployment later this decade. 
</P>
<P>
Critics in Congress say the plane, with its chief mission the delivery of 
nuclear warheads deep into Soviet territory, is not needed and would cost its 
weight in gold. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney also proposed cuts and delays in five other aircraft programs and said 
all the reductions would reduce President Bush's $306.9-billion defense request 
for next year by $2.4 billion and $34.8 billion through 1997. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that U.S. budget strains may require reducing the present 14 U.S. 
aircraft carriers to 12 but that no final decision has been made. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney proposed that 120 C-17 transport planes rather than the 210 originally 
planned be bought to replace the aging C-141 transport. The $200-million plane 
is built by the McDonnell Douglas Corp. 
</P>
<P>
He also proposed that the top-secret Navy A-12 attack plane program be cut to a 
minimum of 620 from the 858 originally planned. Some estimates say the plane 
would cost more than $106 million each as a replacement for the aging A-6 
attack bomber. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney proposed delay in production of the Air Force version of the A-12, the 
advanced tactical aircraft, until after 1997. It would have the same long-range 
attack mission as the present F-111 bomber and the F-15 fighter plane. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics are jointly developing the plane. 
</P>
<P>
The reduction proposals represented the strongest sign yet that the Pentagon 
might be willing to contribute to the "peace dividend" offered by the lessening 
of East-West tensions. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said the cut in the Stealth would shave $14.3 billion off the more than 
$70-billion cost of the B-2 program. But while announcing the cut, he issued a 
plea to save the bomber from being killed entirely. 
</P>
<P>
He told the committee that the B-2 is the only U.S. bomber that would be able 
to evade improving Soviet radar and weapon defenses in the next century for 
bombing raids in a war.

<P>
A former guerrilla leader who joined the presidential race last month was 
killed today by an assailant who opened fire with a machine gun aboard an 
airliner carrying more than 100 people. 
</P>
<P>
Cocaine barons who said they drew lots to decide which presidential candidate 
to kill claimed responsibility for the assassination of Carlos Pizarro, 39, 
Colombian radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
The assailant was killed by the candidate's bodyguards, police said. The plane 
returned to Bogota, where the leftist politician died one hour after being 
admitted to a hospital, officials at the hospital said. 
</P>
<P>
Radio reports said about 120 people were aboard the Avianca Boeing 727 but that 
no other passengers or crew members were injured in the shoot-out, which 
occurred shortly after the plane left Bogota on a domestic flight. 
</P>
<P>
Pizarro was the third presidential contender killed since August, 1989, in 
Colombia, which is engaged in brutal battles with drug cartels, leftist 
guerrillas and right-wing death squads. 
</P>
<P>
No one immediately claimed responsibility for Pizarro's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Caracol radio said in a report from the hospital where the candidate was taken 
that he was hit by 15 bullets, including three in the head. 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified assailant opened fire 10 minutes into the flight, which was 
heading to the Caribbean city of Barranquilla, a spokesman for the national 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The assailant emerged from a lavatory aboard the plane, drew the machine gun 
from a black leather jacket, and opened fire on Pizarro, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Pizarro and his bodyguards were seated near the rear of the plane. The 
bodyguards opened fire, killing the assailant, the police spokesman said. 
Officials in Pizarro's political party said at least six bodyguards were aboard 
the flight. 
</P>
<P>
Pizarro was commander of the leftist M-19 guerrilla movement, which disbanded 
March 8 and surrendered its weapons. The group became a political party, with 
Pizarro as its candidate for the May 27 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
M-19 takes its name from the date of a presidential election on April 19, 1970, 
that the group claims was fraudulent. 
</P>
<P>
As a guerrilla leader, Pizarro commanded 900 fighters, who opposed capitalism 
and what they viewed as U.S. imperialism. In its most daring operation, the 
guerrilla group captured the Palace of Justice in a 1985 assault that left 115 
people dead, including 11 Supreme Court justices. 
</P>
<P>
On March 22, another leftist presidential candidate, Bernardo Jaramillo, was 
killed in a hail of machine gun fire from an assassin at Bogota's airport. 
</P>
<P>
Jaramillo represented the leftist Patriotic Union Party. The government blamed 
drug traffickers for the killing, but party members blamed right-wing death 
squads. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 18, Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, an anti-drug crusader and a governing 
Liberal Party presidential candidate, was assassinated by drug traffickers at a 
rally outside Bogota.

LITHUANIA WILL BEGIN TO RATION FOOD

<P>
Lithuanian lawmakers decided today to impose food rationing May 1 as the 
rebellious republic continued to struggle under an economic blockade that has 
reduced its supplies of fuel and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania widened efforts to circumvent sanctions imposed last week by Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who wants Lithuania to rescind laws designed to 
implement its March 11 declaration of independence. 
</P>
<P>
A Lithuanian delegation was due in the northern Russian city of Leningrad on 
Friday to talk with local officials about a direct exchange of goods either for 
hard currency or barter, a Leningrad journalist said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Estonia today ordered its railways to defy the Soviet blockade, 
and Latvia ended gasoline sales for private cars. 
</P>
<P>
Estonia, itself moving step by step toward independence, said it will deliver 
all goods ordered by neighboring Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
Juhan Hindov, spokesman for the Estonian prime minister, said the republic's 
railways have been instructed to disregard orders from the central ministry in 
Moscow to halt deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
"Estonia continues to send goods to Lithuania, and as far as I know all 
shipments are moving normally," he said by telephone from the Estonian capital, 
Tallinn. 
</P>
<P>
The move was in direct defiance of a Kremlin bid to strangle the Lithuanian 
economy with a blockade steadily expanded from fuel to include parts vital to 
factories, cloth and imported industrial materials. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania's prime minister, Kazimiera Prunskiene, announced Wednesday that 
Lithuania had halted its usual supplies of meat, milk and other food products 
to the rest of the Soviet Union. She instead urged Lithuania to settle its 
accounts with the republics "almost in marketplace conditions" of bartering for 
other goods.

CHINESE PEASANTS KIDNAPED ON ARRIVAL AT KENNEDY AIRPORT

Seven Chinese peasants who had just arrived in the United States to study 
organic farming were kidnaped at Kennedy Airport by screaming Asian men who 
forced them into a car and sped off, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
The peasants were among a group of 16 Chinese nationals from a 19-hour flight 
to New York from Beijing with a stop in San Francisco aboard Air China Flight 
981. 
</P>
<P>
The group was met at the airport by Molly Aitken, president of the World Energy 
Foundation based in Athol, Mass., which is sponsoring the farming program. 
</P>
<P>
At the arrivals terminal, Aitken said she watched in horror as seven of the 
peasants were confronted by three or four men, who screamed as they hustled the 
confused Chinese into a car. 
</P>
<P>
Aitken said she had been warned by a U.S. consular official in China that 
Chinese are often abducted and forced to work as slave labor in New York's 
Chinatown, but a law enforcement official at JFK expressed skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
"It's never happened here before," Port Authority Detective Sgt. Herman McAuley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
McAuley said local police and the FBI are treating the incident as a kidnaping.

SHIFT PANAMA AID TO DOMESTIC USES, SENATE DEMOCRATS URGE

Saying "charity begins at home," Senate Democrats took aim today at a bill to 
send $720 million in emergency aid to Panama and Nicaragua, seeking to shift 
some of the money from Panama to domestic uses. 
</P>
<P>
"Our own people cry out for help," said Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), calling 
for a national debate on foreign aid priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying there shouldn't be any foreign aid program. But we need a 
responsible foreign aid program." 
</P>
<P>
The aid for the new U.S.-backed governments in Central America is the 
centerpiece of a $2.3-billion supplemental spending bill adopted this week by 
the Senate Appropriations Committee that also includes money for a variety of 
uses at home, ranging from food stamps to Hurricane Hugo relief. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, like one passed this month by the House, provides the full $300 
million sought by President Bush for Nicaragua and $420 million of the $500 
million the President wanted for Panama. 
</P>
<P>
But Byrd, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, offered an amendment 
cutting aid to Panama by another $120 million. He said the money he wanted to 
cut was not going for emergencies, pointing out that it included $30 million to 
encourage tourism to Panama.

</P>
<P>
The American College of Physicians said that merely building on the present 
structure, such as expanding government Medicare or Medicaid programs or 
requiring all employers to offer insurance, are short-term solutions at best. 
</P>
<P>
"A nationwide program is needed to assure access to health care for all 
Americans, and we recommend that such a program be adopted as a policy goal for 
the nation," the group said in a position paper released at the start of its 
annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"In the near term, given the urgency of the need, it should build on the 
strengths of existing health care financing mechanisms," the college said. 
</P>
<P>
"In the longer term, careful consideration of new and innovative alternatives, 
including some form of a nationwide financing mechanism, will be necessary," it 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Edwin Maynard, president of the 67,000-member organization, said his colleagues 
are not endorsing a system such as that used in Canada in which provincial and 
central governments back a fee-for-service insurance that offers universal 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that the Canadian system, while still evolving and under cost 
pressures, does "in many respects accomplish some of the goals we want to 
achieve." 
</P>
<P>
For now, he said, "we are not endorsing anything." He said the problem is a 
"national disgrace" and must be addressed rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
The position paper stopped short of making specific recommendations, and called 
for debate and discussion on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The college, whose members are all specialists in internal medicine, said that 
up to 37 million people in the United States have no form of health insurance, 
private or public, and that another 50 million have inadequate protection for 
major hospital and medical expenses.

AVON TO REVAMP ITS SALES SYSTEM AND CALL BY MAIL

<P>
Avon Products Inc. Chairman James E. Preston said today that the door-to-door 
cosmetics giant will revamp its sales system and begin direct mail sales in 
order to achieve ambitious performance targets. 
</P>
<P>
Avon should post sales increases of 3% to 5% in 1990 and 6% to 8% by 1992, 
Preston told a group of securities analysts. 
</P>
<P>
Preston said Avon will begin a "multi-tiered" sales system whereby company 
representatives who recruit and train others will receive compensation for 
their own sales and also for what is sold by their recruits. 
</P>
<P>
The technique, sometimes called a "pyramid" distribution system, has been used 
by Avon rivals Amway Corp. and Mary Kay Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Avon is now embroiled in a battle with an unfriendly investor group, Chartwell 
Associates, that holds an 18% stake in Avon and includes representatives of 
Mary Kay.

The Food and Drug Administration said today a purported diet cookie made here 
will remain on the market pending modification of its labels that apparently 
contain false calorie and nutrition information. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Johnson, FDA district director, met Wednesday with Phoenix International 
Marketing Corp. to discuss the problem with the labels and promotions that 
claim allegedly unproven weight loss and health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco-based director said that no agreement was reached on how to 
change the labels but that the company made several suggestions on fixing the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
The cookie is advertised as having just two grams of fat, 10 grams of dietary 
fiber and 126 calories. The company claims that eating the cookie can help 
people lose up to 14 pounds in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But tests at Mississippi State University found that the average Phoenix Cookie 
has half the fiber, twice the calories and five times the fat its makers claim.

'COACH' STAR TAKES A SIDELINE VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shelley Fabares of ABC's "Coach" takes the long view about TV series: 
</P>
<P>
"The first couple of years of the show, everybody's finding their way, the 
writers are finding their way with each individual character. It seems to me, 
over the years, some shows fall together, but most shows evolve. Unfortunately, 
some aren't around long enough to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Whether "Coach" will survive the programmers' ax and get the time to evolve, 
only ABC can say. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach," which airs Tuesdays, gets bumped the next two weeks for "The Women of 
Brewster Place" and is due to return May 15. 
</P>
<P>
Fabares' career numbers six television series, including ABC's long-running 
"Donna Reed Show" and later, CBS' "One Day at a Time." 
</P>
<P>
So as "Coach" wound down, and not knowing whether it would be picked up for 
next season, she was reflective. 
</P>
<P>
The title character, Hayden Fox (Craig T. Nelson), is a denizen of the world of 
men's college athletics. Helping coach the Minnesota State Screaming Eagles are 
his longtime assistant, Luther Van Dam (Jerry Van Dyke), and his student-coach, 
Dauber Dybinski (Bill Fagerbakke). 
</P>
<P>
"The show is about the coach and the relationships in his life," Fabares said. 
"There's been more of a focus this year on Hayden's and Christine's 
relationship. Obviously, I enjoy that. . . . I like how they have our 
relationship developing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Hayden and Christine are at an interesting point in their relationship 
where they are moving forward, but both are frightened. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a difficult problem in life to find your balance. We're all going through 
the same things. I have a wonderful relationship with my husband 
(actor-producer Mike Farrell), but I'm still a career woman." 
</P>
<P>
Fabares' personal and work lives came together April 17, when Farrell appeared 
as her former beau. Previously, Fabares and Farrell had appeared in a TV movie 
called "Memorial Day."

STRAIT NAMED ENTERTAINER OF YEAR AT COUNTRY MUSIC AWARDS

<TEXT>
<P>
Gentleman cowboy George Strait brought the night's big prize home for country 
veterans, but fellow Texan Clint Black, a 28-year-old ironworker with a knack 
for ballads and a hot first record, got the bulk of trophies. 
</P>
<P>
The only other multiple winner during Wednesday's 25th anniversary of the 
Academy of Country Music Awards show was Kathy Mattea, voted top female 
vocalist and song of the year winner for "Where've You Been." 
</P>
<P>
But the night belonged to Black. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels very emotional. It feels great. It's wonderful. It's just a big 
thrill. It's hard to describe," said Black, whose first single "A Better Man" 
reaped him single record of the year honors. 
</P>
<P>
Strait, who has been named top male vocalist three times and earned best album 
honors once, was his unemotional, straight-faced self after accepting 
entertainer of the year honors. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I had as good a shot as anybody to win. I got out there and worked 
as hard as anybody else. To be chosen entertainer of the year is very special," 
he said.

Cartoon king Walter Lantz, the creator of the impish Woody Woodpecker, begins 
his 90th birthday celebration today at Universal Studios Florida in Orlando. 
The celebration, which also marks Woody's 50th anniversary, includes the 
dedication of Lantz' star on Universal's Walk of Fame -- a franchised 
duplication of the Hollywood walk. . . . GMT Studios in Culver City is getting 
more than 100 inquiries a day on its open casting call for the starring role of 
James Dean in "James Dean . . . The Legend," which begins shooting this summer. 
</P>
<P>
To be considered for the role, the actor must be early to mid-20s, about 5 feet 
8 inches tall, 140-150 pounds, possess a striking resemblance to James Dean and 
show up dressed in character. When asked what he expects to see at the May 5 
casting call, a studio spokesman replied: "Red jackets, white T-shirts and 
jeans galore."

A 55-foot replica of the Egyptian wonder is coming to New Jersey in June for a 
spectacular $7-million production of the opera "Aida." 
</P>
<P>
While most operas aren't over 'til the fat lady sings, this one won't be done 
until 1,200 cast members, a 100-piece orchestra, a menagerie of exotic animals 
and the eight-ton Sphinx are paraded through Giants Stadium for two nights. 
</P>
<P>
Promoters are hoping for 39,000 people each night for the June 1-2 shows. 
Giants Stadium is the latest stop for the opera, which is billed as the biggest 
production of any opera, ever.

Tom Candiotti took a no-hitter into the seventh inning, and the Cleveland 
Indians held on for a 4-3 victory over Toronto today with the help of 
consecutive homers by Cory Snyder and Candy Maldonado. 
</P>
<P>
Candiotti (3-0) struck out nine and walked three as the Indians avoided a sweep 
in the four-game series. He wound up allowing three runs on three hits in 6 1/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Candiotti did not allow a hit until George Bell blooped a leadoff single to 
left in the seventh. Fred McGriff followed with a single, and Greg Myers pulled 
the Jays to within a run one out later when he drove Candiotti's 2-1 pitch over 
the 400-foot sign in center field. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Orosco came on to get the final two outs of the seventh. Doug Jones 
pitched the final two innings for his fifth save, aided by a double play after 
allowing a leadoff single to John Olerud in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Stieb (3-1) allowed four runs on five hits in six innings for Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder and Maldonado started the Cleveland second with homers. Brook Jacoby 
then doubled, moved to third on a single by Keith Hernandez and scored when 
Toronto shortstop Tony Fernandez made a wild throw to first on a routine 
grounder by Joey Belle. 
</P>
<P>
Jacoby singled in the fourth, moved to second when Hernandez walked and went to 
third when third baseman Kelly Gruber's throwing error loaded the bases. Jacoby 
scored on Sandy Alomar Jr.'s fielder's choice grounder. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez's 15-game hitting streak came to an end as he went 0 for 4. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati center fielder Eric Davis is undergoing more tests on a sprained 
right knee to determine how long he'll be out of action. 
</P>
<P>
Davis sprained the knee sliding into third base Tuesday night in Philadelphia, 
and he missed Wednesday's game with the Phillies. With an off day today before 
opening a weekend home stand against the Montreal Expos, the Reds were able to 
bring Davis to Cincinnati for tests by team physician Michael Lawhon. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Larry Starr checked Davis on Wednesday and began treatments of ice, 
muscle stimulation and intermittent pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a tender right knee and there's mild swelling," Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
Phillies team physician Phillip Marone examined Davis and said he had an 
isolated right medial collateral ligament sprain. 
</P>
<P>
Starr said that Davis would have an MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging, taken 
to determine the extent of the injury. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have a better idea after he sees Dr. Lawhon," Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Lou Piniella moved Billy Hatcher from left field to Davis' spot in 
center for Wednesday's game, and started Rolando Roomes in left. Piniella said 
if Davis has to miss several games, he may try second baseman Mariano Duncan in 
left field and put backup Luis Quinones at second base. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he injured the knee because the condition of the base path made him 
alter his slide while stealing third base. Piniella said he agreed with Davis' 
contention that the Phillies had "muddied up" the base paths to negate the 
Reds' speed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what clubs are doing is mushing it up," Piniella said. "They did that 
in Houston the last night we were there. 
</P>
<P>
"The first step or so, that's where you're affected. You can complain to the 
league. . . . We'll see if it continues."

Quarterback Jim McMahon was released today by the San Diego Chargers, less than 
a year after the team used a second-round draft choice to acquire the former 
Super Bowl star from the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon's contract expired earlier this year, and the two sides have been 
unable to reach agreement on a new deal. 
</P>
<P>
"It's apparent that Jim's contract situation could become a distraction," Coach 
Dan Henning said. "Jim has asked to be released immediately so he can negotiate 
with other teams." 
</P>
<P>
McMahon started 11 games for the Chargers last year. He was benched for the 
final four games of the season in favor of rookie Billy Joe Tolliver. McMahon 
completed 176 of 318 passes for 2,132 yards, 10 touchdowns and 10 interceptions 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Tolliver, the Chargers have three other quarterbacks -- Mark 
Vlasic, who joined the team in 1987; David Archer, signed as a free agent last 
year; and John Friesz, a University of Idaho star picked up in Sunday's draft. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon never gained the following in San Diego that he had in Chicago, and his 
bad-boy image alienated local media. He was harshly criticized by local 
columnists after he blew his nose on a reporter in late October. 
</P>
<P>
He refused to apologize for his action, saying, "It was either that or beat the 
. . . out of him, but you can't get sued for sneezing." 
</P>
<P>
Henning said today that the contract offered to McMahon contained "possibly a 
reduction, or the same salary with escalation through incentives that he could 
make a lot more money." 
</P>
<P>
Henning emphasized that the Chargers did not want to relive their experience 
with running back Gary Anderson, who sat out last season over salary demands 
and was recently traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not interested in another drawn-out contract dispute as we had last year 
with Gary Anderson," Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said the Chargers' new general manager, Bobby Beathard, "didn't think 
that it would be possible" to reach an agreement with McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about McMahon's performance, Henning said, "We were disappointed in our 
season last year and he was only part of it. 
</P>
<P>
"He did a credible job. His statistics were good. . . . I wouldn't say he was a 
disappointment." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers acquired McMahon, 30, in a trade with Chicago last Aug. 18. Though 
he was troubled by injuries for much of his time in Chicago, he also was a 
proven winner. 
</P>
<P>
From 1984 to 1988, the Bears were 35-3 in games McMahon started, including 
their 46-10 Super Bowl victory over New England in January, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But he was bothered by injuries to his shoulder and knee, missing 23 of the 
Bears' 48 non-strike games from 1986 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
A first-round draft choice by Chicago in 1982, McMahon was a two-year starter 
at Brigham Young University, going 22-3 and twice taking the Cougars to the 
Western Athletic Conference title.

FRISKY, SQUALL END UP THE FAVORITES; 
</P>
<P>
KENTUCKY DERBY: DEPARTURE OF CHAMPAGNEFORASHLEY MAY PULL A FEW BORDERLINE 
HORSES INTO COMPETITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The decision made by Champagneforashley's connections to skip the Kentucky 
Derby is likely to prompt the owners of a few borderline horses to take a shot 
in the Derby, but the core number is about 14 -- the two favorites, a handful 
with a long shot and the spear carriers. 
</P>
<P>
As May approaches, the deep group that began accumulating at Saratoga as 
2-year-olds is down to the reigning Puerto Rican Horse of the Year, Mister 
Frisky -- the next Bold Forbes, in some opinions -- and Summer Squall, who won 
the Hopeful at 2 and has yet to take a misstep in the heat of competition. He 
is being compared by some to Demons Begone, who failed to finish after bleeding 
as the favorite in the 1987 Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall has won the Jim Beam and Blue Grass impressively despite 
persistent rumors concerning his soundness and speculation over when his 
bleeding problem will reappear. 
</P>
<P>
The Storm Bird colt has done nothing to calm the rumor mill in two easy 
triumphs on off tracks. He rested in his stall for three days following the 
April 14 Blue Grass -- a suspiciously long time -- before being shipped to 
Churchill Downs at midweek. A slow work, 1:02 2/5 for five furlongs Tuesday 
shakes the tree a bit more. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Neil Howard insists everything is fine, saying that the horse was just 
tired after the Blue Grass and that the work was just the right amount of 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
One record is safe now that Champagneforashley, having been jarred by a pothole 
on the road to Louisville after being bet down to 7-2 in the future book, is 
out of the Kentucky Derby. No horse with the spaces removed from its name has 
won the Derby during its first 115 years. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Brant is on a very negative roll. As if facing a federal prison sentence 
after pleading guilty to income-tax charges wasn't enough for Brant, Stella 
Madrid, owned by Brant, lost her first start of the season, and the venerable 
Thoroughbred Record, founded in 1875 and published recently by a company in 
which Brant owns a 47.5% interest, will cease to be issued, effective 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986 Brant purchased the trade publication, which for years competed in the 
weekly breeding-trade market with the Blood Horse and, for a short time, with 
the Thoroughbred Times. The new owner immediately yielded the weekly 
slick-magazine market to the Blood Horse, and the Record was converted to a 
monthly under Brant. In 1988, he merged his magazine with two properties owned 
by Richard Broadbent, founder of Bloodstock Research Information Service, a 
statistical data base, and Thoroughbred Times, a weekly newspaper published for 
breeders. The Record's demise was quickened, according to several sources, by 
editor-in-chief Mark Simon, who held equity in Broadbent's enterprises and 
emerged from the merger with a 5% interest in Thoroughbred Publications. 
</P>
<P>
Simon was one of several editors at the Record before joining Broadbent and was 
the original editor of Thoroughbred Times, which was first published in 1985. 
According to Simon, folding the 115-year-old magazine was strictly business. 
Advertisers, primarily breeding farms, responded unfavorably to the monthly 
version of the Record.

SHADES OF GRAY / AGNES HERMAN: KEEPING ONE STEP AHEAD OF THE DINOSAURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AGNES HERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Mommy, long, long ago, when you were a little girl, were there dinosaurs 
around?" Judi was 5 and I was 33. In her eyes, I was old. Her question was not 
meant to be sharp, but it impaled me. 
</P>
<P>
Today, young Americans have a similarly distorted perception of those of us who 
see ourselves as "aging gracefully." They look upon us as the homogenized 
elderly: stoop-shouldered and slow-moving, sitting idly on benches, watching 
time go by. In our own mirrors, however, we see a different reflection: 
changing times and attitudes allow us to wash out some gray, straighten the 
shoulders and soften the lines. 
</P>
<P>
I retired as director of volunteer services for Family Service of Los Angeles 
11 years ago; five years later, my husband, and I moved to San Diego's North 
County. I had not yet attained chronological "senior status," but I was ready 
for a change. Several years later, I reached my seniority, and, to my surprise 
and delight, dinners, movies and flight tickets became quite reasonable, and a 
variety of people began to open doors for me. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, from the moment of retirement, my life took a most comfortable turn. I 
gave up early mornings, work schedules, evening appointments, boring commuting 
hours on the freeways, interminable meetings with so many who had so much to 
say and so little to teach. 
</P>
<P>
I have never turned back and wished that I was once again on the job I had 
genuinely enjoyed. Nor have I warmed up the rocking chair, or buried myself in 
a shawl. I meet only my dentist and hairdresser at dawn: it is best to see them 
at the top of their performance. I do keep a calendar of appointments, but it 
is written in pencil, to be altered or canceled easily. Only those dates made 
with grandson, Matthew, 2, are immutable. 
</P>
<P>
Returning from a trip, I no longer find a stack of unfinished business 
requiring my "immediate attention," only the usual catalogues and bills. Some 
things never change. 
</P>
<P>
We live at the southwest corner of the Lake San Marcos community, which is, by 
and large, a society of seniors. I do not know the statistics, but I do know 
what I see: couples in the grocery store doing the week's shopping, often 
holding hands, taking their time to read labels and compare prices. Living in a 
community of younger people, I rarely saw a couple shopping; one of the two 
usually was at work. Only newlyweds and the elderly go shopping in pairs. 
</P>
<P>
At the golf course and in the tennis areas, many of us take advantage of the 
greens and the courts. We are active; our games are competitive. In the 
twilight hours of the day, some young people appear, after work. We seniors 
always speculate, "Wonder where they come from, whose grandchildren are they?" 
</P>
<P>
But is that all there is to retirement/senior status: shop and play? 
</P>
<P>
Indeed not! In between the leisure hours, I, for one, sit at this word 
processor and try to justify this new career, chosen for my later years. I 
struggle with words and concepts as hard as I ever fought my way through a 
staff conference at Family Service. 
</P>
<P>
And then there are volunteer responsibilities. My husband and I manage a 
national association of retired rabbis, a time-consuming, satisfying task. 
Working together is an added bonus; our professional paths have intersected in 
retirement as they could not when we were both wage-earners. In addition, each 
of us is called upon for informal counseling and consulting, using skills for 
which we were trained long, long ago when the "dinosaurs were around." 
</P>
<P>
Drawing upon old skills and discovering new ones are our keys to fulfillment 
during these special years. We are not alone. Recently, in the office of the 
North County Interfaith Council, I met a retired gentleman who has been 
counseling the homeless and the poor weekly for the past six years, as a 
volunteer. The professional staff noted that many of their counselors are 
retired doctors, psychiatrists, social workers, each of whom is a volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
Here at the Lake, many of us have continuing careers, as well as new ones, but 
now we work at our own speed, at our own convenience, at projects we select. 
</P>
<P>
My husband, retired from his former responsibilities as a rabbi, gains 
tremendous satisfaction when invited to substitute for colleagues. A neighbor, 
a retired Navy officer and department store trouble-shooter, is now launching a 
writing career. A former public schoolteacher is busy teaching English to 
recently arrived Mexicans. A retired Marine is succeeding in the real estate 
business. A pharmacist is coaching kids and involving himself in the political 
life of the lake. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone shapes a new and different "job." Some neighbors are dedicated 
gardeners, working among the flowers, a joy for which they never before found 
time; others read voraciously, without guilt. Many are deeply involved in 
church work. One neighbor took his hobby seriously and opened a local fishing 
tackle store. 
</P>
<P>
I have not yet rapped on doors to learn the details of my neighbors' 
preoccupations, but when, each week, I see the pretty widow standing in high 
heels on the front sill, 3 feet off the ground, washing her windows and 
chatting amiably with passers-by, I know that I must speak with her to discover 
what keeps her 80-plus years young. 
</P>
<P>
Staying young during retirement and/or the loss of a spouse is a challenge. 
Many cope successfully, in a variety of ways. Some become volunteers: teaching 
literacy, grandparenting someone else's isolated grandkids, helping the poor 
file income tax returns or counseling the hungry and the homeless; others have 
opted for second careers. 
</P>
<P>
Staying healthy is no less a challenge. Is there something special about health 
care for silver-haired citizens? I intend to share with you creative ways some 
have chosen to stay well and cope with everyday living. We can learn and 
benefit from each other. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
EDITOR'S NOTE: At 68, Agnes Herman may be retired, but she's not retiring. 
Besides many volunteer activities, she has been a frequent contributor to the 
San Diego County Opinion Page. In Shades of Gray, a column for and about North 
County's older residents, she will blend practical information with insight and 
humor -- and a measure of her personal philosophy of getting the most out of 
life and every situation. Look for Shades of Gray on the fourth Thursday of the 
month in North County Focus.

FARMERS CAUGHT IN THE BIG SQUEEZE; 
</P>
<P>
AGRICULTURE: RISING LAND VALUES AND DEVELOPMENT ARE FORCING -- SOMETIMES 
ENTICING -- MANY NORTH COUNTY GROWERS AND DAIRY OWNERS TO PULL UP STAKES AND 
MOVE.

<P>
Mike Horwath believes a farmer must be optimistic by nature, yet his words are 
tinged with fatalism when he considers the future of his serene, 155-acre 
rhubarb farm in Valley Center, north of Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
"You can only put up with complaints, trash dumping, trespassing and 
urbanization for so long before you give up," Horwath said, as his black dog 
galumphed around the yard. "Let's face it, you can't stop it." 
</P>
<P>
He's been through it all before and knows that the arrival of new homes, kids 
on motorcycles, littering and the newcomers' disregard for the delicacy of 
agriculture can spell the eventual doom of a farm. 
</P>
<P>
Horwath, who at age 40 is among the county's younger farmers, belongs to a 
stubborn and resourceful breed who so far have survived the region's lightning 
development. It hasn't been easy. 
</P>
<P>
From crop farmers like Horwath to flower growers along the North County coast 
to inland dairymen, rising land values and development are forcing -- sometimes 
enticing -- many to pull up stakes and move. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes they push farther east into San Diego County, a more remote area but 
where the climate and soil aren't always as rich. Others plan to leave for 
good, for places like San Joaquin Valley, where land is cheaper and water more 
plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
"Urbanization causes a lot of problems, so people just keep moving," said Wendy 
Benz, executive director of the San Diego County Farm Bureau. "But how far east 
can you go? There's not a lot of water." 
</P>
<P>
For now, though, Horwath figures he's gone far enough. 
</P>
<P>
He came to San Diego in 1972 and, with his father and uncle, farmed tomatoes, 
squash, cabbage, lima beans and other crops on 1,400 acres in what was then the 
sprawling lands of Otay Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
But Horwath could plainly see the rapid development of nearby San Ysidro and 
knew that time was short before Otay Mesa would be teeming with subdivisions, 
shopping centers and traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my first jobs was to find a new place to farm because we saw the 
handwriting on the wall in Otay Mesa," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, before long there came the predictable collision of lifestyles as 
homes sprouted up around Horwath's acreage. And, in the meanwhile, Horwath's 
water bill for irrigation soared during the summer, not unusual as farmers 
without wells in semi-arid San Diego County rely on water imported hundreds of 
miles from Northern California and the Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
Between development and high water costs, "farming was being squeezed out of 
Otay Mesa," Horwath recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Next, he leased property and farmed in the San Pasqual Valley southeast of 
Escondido until a dispute with the landowner, the city of San Diego, prompted 
him to buy 155 acres in Valley Center in March, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
On his land, sometimes a bird is the only sound in the lulls between the 
ruffling of the breeze. His dog wanders around, gladly accepting attention and 
not even minding when he is required to display his black tongue for a visitor. 
</P>
<P>
A house serves as the business office for TMY Farms, and out front are 
irrigated rows of green-topped, reddish-stalked rhubarb, the crop Horwath is 
banking on to provide him and his family with a future. 
</P>
<P>
The weather is good here for rhubarb and, unlike before, Horwath is supplied by 
his own well water. 
</P>
<P>
The farmer agrees politely when told that rhubarb doesn't exactly enjoy a 
passionate following. However, he's wise far beyond that narrow observation. 
</P>
<P>
Like the new wave of farmers, he has learned to switch to specialty crops 
because the big traditional crops in San Diego are declining as prime land is 
lost to development. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego was very well known for its tomato crops," said Horwath. That was in 
the days before the farms "were mostly split up and developed." 
</P>
<P>
Annual crop reports from the county's Department of Agriculture help tell the 
story. Ten years ago, 5,190 acres of tomatoes were harvested, a figure that 
dropped to 2,743 acres by 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Production of strawberries, another key crop in San Diego County, has faltered 
as the amount of harvested acreage increased by a modest 188 acres from 1980 to 
1988. That was after strawberries went up 365 acres from 1970 to 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Even 20 years ago, then-county Agricultural Commissioner James Moon had a 
vision of the future. 
</P>
<P>
In his annual report, Moon noted that, although agricultural acreage in 1970 
was half what it was in 1950, the availability of water for irrigation would 
make high-yield, high-value crops on smaller farms more prevalent. 
</P>
<P>
So, although tomatoes and strawberries may not be as bountiful as they once 
were, other crops such as avocados and flowers are flourishing on smaller 
farms. According to the Farm Bureau, today there are about 6,000 farms in the 
county, 70% with 9 acres or fewer. 
</P>
<P>
Avocados were harvested from 10,380 acres in 1970 and 36,410 acres in 1988. 
During that time, acreage for nursery products and flowers went up from about 
475 to 6,083 acres. 
</P>
<P>
With less land available and needing a high-yield, marketable crop, Horwath 
followed the trend in this county toward specialty crops. 
</P>
<P>
"We're only one of two people in California to have the rhubarb roots," he 
said. The other is in Santa Maria. 
</P>
<P>
The strain of rhubarb roots Horwath grows were developed in the 1920s, and he 
acquired the roots in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Rhubarb is continually harvested from October to June, and when his plants 
mature in a few more years, he expects to pluck up to 12,000 pounds an acre. 
</P>
<P>
He sells his rhubarb locally to Big Bear and to a large produce market in 
Oakland. Other accounts are situated in Salt Lake City and Kansas, and Horwath 
hopes to begin his own rhubarb shipping business this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Migrating inland may be only a matter of time for Mellano &amp; Company, 
growers of iris, daisies, baby's breath and other flowers on 150 acres in San 
Luis Rey, between Oceanside and Fallbrook. 
</P>
<P>
"We came here 20 some years ago from L.A. because our nursery became surrounded 
by houses," said Mike Mellano, whose family is once again trying to keep its 
operation stable in the face of development. "We didn't think it would grow 
this fast here." 
</P>
<P>
Land is available in eastern North County, but flowers are best suited to the 
gentle coastal climate that serves as a natural greenhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"As you go farther inland, it's colder in the winter and warmer in the summer," 
said Mellano. That requires costly air conditioning and heating equipment to 
regulate greenhouse temperatures for flowers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
And the inland soil is less nutritious for certain flower varieties, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Echter, co-owner of Foxpoint Farms in Encinitas, whose fields of bright 
flowers resemble a Monet painting, believes the exodus of flower farmers from 
North County has been slow. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen a number close down and a number move inland, but it's not a great 
number," he said. Still, "we'll continue to see this slow movement." 
</P>
<P>
Echter and his partner lease 35 acres, and he feels cautiously optimistic that 
they have plenty of years left there. Even so, "at times, I would like to put 
in a high-cost greenhouse, but I'm concerned about the longevity of being 
here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although development is causing many farmers to move, not everybody in 
agriculture is dour about change. 
</P>
<P>
For Arie De Jong, the slow but relentless approach of development near his 
family's 150-acre dairy in San Marcos has brought an opportunity he can't 
resist. After all, farmers are businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
His land has become worth so much that he intends to sell and relocate his 
operation to the San Joaquin Valley. "What is happening, the property is just 
getting too valuable to be grazing cows on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As he speaks, condo projects stick up like pinkish clumps of vegetables across 
the street from the De Jong family's Hollandia Dairy, the county's largest. 
Cars buzz along Mission Road past Jong's 1,000 milk cows. 
</P>
<P>
This juxtaposition of a dairy farm and suburban growth constitutes a strange 
vision contrasted with with the way things used to be. 
</P>
<P>
The De Jong family has produced milk for more than a century. In 1949, they 
came to America from Holland, started a dairy in Poway, and scraped together 
the then-lordly sum of $5,000 to buy a place in Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
They relocated to San Marcos in 1955, a community so sparse it "was nothing but 
dirt roads," he recalls. The family prospered. Hollandia now has 200 employees 
and processes 200,000 gallons of milk a week. 
</P>
<P>
Besides their own milk cows, "we buy all the milk produced in San Diego County 
and process and distribute it," said De Jong, a man obviously proud of his 
family's attainment in a new land. 
</P>
<P>
Hollandia provides milk to 400 schools, military bases and hospitals in San 
Diego County. Other family members have dairies in the San Joaquin Valley, 
Oregon, Arizona and, soon, in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
All the while, the world around the family has been changing in San Marcos 
until, finally, the moment for a critical decision arrived. 
</P>
<P>
The city formed a special assessment district, which included the dairy, to 
raise money to widen Mission Road from two to six lanes, place utilities 
underground and make other improvements. The move put the dairy in a hot 
location for future projects. 
</P>
<P>
With the dairy land worth so much for development, De Jong reasoned that, "from 
an economic standpoint, it is more feasible to bring the cows to the feed than 
bring the feed to the cows." 
</P>
<P>
So, after 40 years in North County, the family plans to take its operation to 
Hanford, Visalia or Tulare, where water is more plentiful and land is cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is, it's become so urbanized (in San Marcos), you have liability 
if a cow gets loose. It's just not practical to run this large an operation in 
so urban an area," De Jong said. 
</P>
<P>
Within five or 10 years, De Jong believes his dairy land will be covered with 
houses, condos, commerce and industry. The family hopes to help win development 
permits, then sell to a builder. 
</P>
<P>
Although De Jong has accepted the inevitable, farmer Horwath is busily looking 
forward to his first major rhubarb crop in October. 
</P>
<P>
But, even as he labors, he is wary of the familiar signs that growth is coming 
to Valley Center. 
</P>
<P>
This area, about 10 miles north of Escondido and south of Rainbow, now has a 
moratorium on new sewer connections that has limited growth. But one faction of 
property owners is supporting a drive to get sewer service for a 
5.5-square-mile area that's zoned for up to 10,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Already, there are hints of Valley Center's destiny. On Old Castle Road, which 
leads to Valley Center from Interstate 15, is a country club and golf course. 
The valley is dotted with homes on large lots. A sign advertises a gate-guarded 
community of luxury homes that is on the way. 
</P>
<P>
A few miles up the road is Horwath's farm, which has single-family homes at the 
rear property line. "There's more being built every day," said Horwath. 
</P>
<P>
Things haven't yet gotten as unpleasant as they did in Otay Mesa, where there 
was trash dumping, trespassing and tenseness with newcomers. Yet the signs are 
unmistakable. "We've had problems with kids on motorcycles running over the 
irrigation pipes," Horwath said. 
</P>
<P>
He seems a prudently upbeat man who says with all the variables, from fickle 
weather to the economy, "you have to be an optimist to be a farmer."

<P>
VOLLEYBALL: EIGHT COUNTRIES COMPETING IN MIKE O'HARA'S EFFORT TO PUT SPOTLIGHT 
ON ATHLETES IN NON-OLYMPIC YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike O'Hara, the sports promoter who helped develop the American Basketball 
Assn., the World Hockey Assn. and professional track, has a vision: 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is meeting the Soviet Union in the championship match of the 
World (Volleyball) League and the Forum is sold out. A billion people, watching 
on a worldwide TV network, see Scott Fortune hit the winning point for the U.S. 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Hmm? Sounds as if O'Hara, a former UCLA volleyball star, got spiked in the 
head one too many times. But they laughed when O'Hara devised the three-point 
shot for the American Basketball Assn., the World Hockey Assn. began signing 
underaged players such as Wayne Gretzky and Pro-Track started paying runners. 
</P>
<P>
The ABA, WHA and Pro-Track were each making money when O'Hara left, and he 
predicts that the World League, which begins play Sunday at the Forum, will 
succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all the things I've been involved in, I've never seen a league that has 
started with the credibility, experience and capital that this league has," 
O'Hara said. "Usually you sweat out the first year." 
</P>
<P>
But O'Hara isn't sweating. 
</P>
<P>
The World League has a $4-million budget, of which $3 million will be 
underwritten by corporate sponsors and $1 million by TV contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"The NBA didn't start out this well," O'Hara said. "The NFL didn't start out 
this well. All those leagues started out real shaky, but people forget about 
their humble beginnings." 
</P>
<P>
Is the world ready for the World League? 
</P>
<P>
It makes sense from a business and marketing standpoint. SportsChannel, which 
will televise the U.S. matches, is a cable network hungry for quality 
programming. And volleyball, which all but disappears in non-Olympic years, 
needs the exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Fortune, who hit the winning shot in the gold-medal match in the 1988 Olympics, 
predicts success for the World League. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be really big, especially in America," Fortune said. "The 
world championships are big in a lot of countries, but Americans don't really 
follow volleyball until the Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
O'Hara has experience promoting volleyball, having run the Team Cup volleyball 
league at the Forum since 1984. Team Cup matches average 2,000 fans with the 
finals drawing 5,000. O'Hara hopes to expand on the base of Southland 
volleyball fans. 
</P>
<P>
Although the league has already met its budget, it could be be a hard sell in 
Southern California because the six-week season, which runs from April to June, 
conflicts with the NBA playoffs. Although the World League will move to the 
summer next year, the initial season was set for this spring so it wouldn't 
conflict with the World Cup soccer tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if we struggle this year, I think we'll be successful next year because 
we won't be competing against the Lakers," said John Root, a member of the 1988 
U.S. Olympic team. "All we have to do is go up against baseball." 
</P>
<P>
O'Hara said: "The break-even point from a league standpoint has already been 
assured. Each of the teams will look to gate receipts and local sponsorships. 
The jury is still out on how we're going to do this year. I'd be delighted if 
we broke even." 
</P>
<P>
The brainchild of O'Hara and Laker owner Jerry Buss, the World League is 
composed of the national volleyball teams from eight countries: the United 
States, the Soviet Union, Brazil, China, France, Italy, Japan and the 
Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
Sanctioned by the International Volleyball Federation, the league hopes to add 
four teams next year: Cuba, Canada, Argentina and Poland. 
</P>
<P>
The eight teams are divided into two divisions, with the United States grouped 
with France, Italy and Brazil. Each team will play 12 matches, six home and six 
away, during the season. The top two teams from each division will meet in a 
four-match championship final in Osaka, Japan, July 14-15. 
</P>
<P>
The teams will receive a total of $1 million in prize money. Teams receive 
$1,500 for each match they win, $1,000 for each loss. The division champions 
will receive $80,000, with second place worth $60,000, third place $40,000, and 
fourth place $30,000. The playoff champion will win $140,000, with the 
second-place team getting $110,000, the third-place team $80,000 and the 
fourth-place team $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
There are also individual prizes. The league's most valuable player will get 
$15,000, with $10,000 prizes to be awarded the best spiker, best blocker, best 
setter and best defensive player. The outstanding referee will receive $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the U.S. volleyball team, who earn an average stipend of $1,500 per 
month, like the league's monetary rewards. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. national team, which requires a full-time commitment, has been losing 
its best players to Italian club teams, which offer six-figure salaries. 
</P>
<P>
"The Italians have upped volleyball to a different level with the money they're 
paying now," said Fortune. "It's real difficult for (the United States) to deal 
with because we don't have the money or the sponsors to pay the players to stay 
around instead of going to Italy." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team is rebuilding after the retirement of Karch Kiraly and Steve 
Timmons, who led the team to gold medals in the last two Olympics. Three other 
players have left the national team to play in Italy: Jeff Stork, the starting 
setter on the U.S. team since 1985; Bob Ctvrtlik, who was voted best defensive 
player at the 1988 Olympics, and Adam Johnson, a former USC standout who was 
voted 1986 NCAA player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Fortune, the youngest player on the 1988 U.S. Olympic team, and Root, a reserve 
on that team, rejected offers from Italian teams to remain with the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
How could that be? 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us still have something to prove," Root said. "But in light of the 
fact that they're (the United States Volleyball Federation) giving us the 
option of going to Italy and coming back over (to join the 1992 Olympic team), 
a lot of the guys are going to take advantage of that option." 
</P>
<P>
Although Kiraly and Timmons were listed on the U.S. roster for the World 
League, they will not compete this season. 
</P>
<P>
"They were the heart and soul of the team," Fortune said. "I talked to Steve 
and he said that before the U.S. became a good team they went through a real 
difficult period, which is what we're going through now. We have a bunch of 
young kids who are trying to come together as a team." 
</P>
<P>
Said Root: "We have to find new players we can focus on and build a campaign 
around. Scott and I have been around the longest and hopefully we can provide 
the leadership that the coaches are looking for to bring the young guys 
around." 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the players are young. 
</P>
<P>
With the departure of Stork, the U.S. team's biggest problem was finding an 
experienced setter. The problem was solved by coaxing Rod Wilde out of 
retirement. Wilde, 34, had coached at Pepperdine since suffering a leg injury 
that knocked him out of the 1984 Games. 
</P>
<P>
Wilde, who coached against many of the players on the team, is adjusting to 
being a player again. He is 12 years older than the average age of the players. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of Johnson also created a void at outside hitter, which will be filled 
by Root, who has been used primarily as a middle blocker. The other starting 
outside hitter is Troy Tanner, who led Pepperdine to NCAA titles in 1985 and 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
Fortune and Mark Arnold are expected to start at middle blocker, and Chris 
Braun will start at opposite hitter. 
</P>
<P>
The toughest competition in the United States' division is expected to come 
from Italy, which won the 1989 European Championship and finished second behind 
Cuba at the 1989 World Cup. The Soviet Union is favored in the other division.

IN A PITCH OF FATE, HE'S NOW A CARDINAL; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: AS A DODGER IN 1985, NIEDENFUER GAVE UP A HOME RUN THAT CLINCHED A 
PENNANT FOR ST. LOUIS. THIS YEAR, THE CARDINALS HELPED SALVAGE THE RELIEVER'S 
CAREER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Tom Niedenfuer appreciates the irony but is more appreciative of the 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Released by the Seattle Mariners just before the 1990 season, Niedenfuer has 
been thrust into a pivotal role in the St. Louis Cardinal bullpen, helping 
replace injured Todd Worrell. 
</P>
<P>
He was promoted from Louisville Monday and accompanied the Cardinals to Los 
Angeles Tuesday. His presence in the visitors' clubhouse at Dodger Stadium is a 
strange twist, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
It was about 4 1/2 years ago that Niedenfuer, then with the Dodgers, threw a 
pitch that would forever link his name to the Cardinals and cause it to live in 
Dodger infamy. In the ninth inning of Game 6 of the 1985 playoffs, Jack Clark 
hit it for a three-run home run, lifting the Cardinals to a 7-5 victory and the 
National League pennant. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday's flight to Los Angeles, former Dodger teammate Pedro Guerrero 
couldn't resist a little gallows humor. He reflected on that home run, on the 
fact Niedenfuer is now wearing a St. Louis uniform, and told Niedenfuer that if 
he pitches well against the Dodgers, "The fans are going to say, 'We knew it 
was a set up, we knew it was a set up all along.' " 
</P>
<P>
Prodded by Ozzie Smith, who also hit an unlikely home run off Niedenfuer in 
that playoff series, Niedenfuer related the anecdote and laughed. 
</P>
<P>
He will never be allowed to forget, but time has eased the pain and dimmed 
debate over whether Manager Tom Lasorda should have had Niedenfuer walk Clark 
intentionally. 
</P>
<P>
Niedenfuer pulled on a Cardinal warmup jersey and said: "Sure there's some 
irony in this, but it would be more ironic if I was coming back in '86, just a 
year later. It's been almost five years, and I've been with two other teams in 
the meantime. I don't look on it as irony as much as another chance, and I'll 
give 110% as I always do." 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old right-hander saved 19 games with a 2.71 earned-run average as 
the ace of the Dodger bullpen in '85, after saving 31 games in the previous 
three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Booed frequently in '86, he was 6-4 with 10 saves and a 3.07 ERA, spent most of 
August on the disabled list with a hamstring injury and was traded to the 
Baltimore Orioles in May of '87 for John Shelby and Brad Havens. 
</P>
<P>
Niedenfuer reflected, saying his confidence wasn't shaken by the Clark home 
run, that his 1986 falloff wasn't the byproduct of that hit, though the 
eventual change of scenery was probably beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
"People are quick to (connect) what happened in '86 with the Clark home run," 
he said. "They can think what they want to think, but I don't buy it. I pitched 
a lot of innings in '85 (a career-high 106 1/3), there had been a lot of wear 
and tear and I got off to a slow start (in '86). Physically, I just never found 
a groove." 
</P>
<P>
Carrying what he calls great memories and friendships from his years with the 
Dodgers ("I had the opportunity to pitch in one World Series and three playoffs 
and we did win the division in '85, which sometimes gets overlooked"), 
Niedenfuer saved 13 games for the Orioles in '87 and 18 in '88, when they won 
only 54 games. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 18 for 19 in save chances and close to signing a two-year deal in 
September when I blew two in a row and the negotiations kind of fell apart," 
said Niedenfuer, who then moved to the Mariners as a free agent, signing a 
two-year contract with a club option on 1991. 
</P>
<P>
But in his final exhibition appearance of the 1989 spring, Niedenfuer suffered 
a broken left wrist when he was hit by a line drive off the bat of the Oakland 
Athletics' Mike Gallego. Niedenfuer did not return to the Mariner bullpen until 
the first of June, by which time Mike Schooler had become the closer and Mike 
Jackson his setup man. 
</P>
<P>
Niedenfuer was 0-3 with no saves in 25 appearances. 
</P>
<P>
"In those two months I was out, everyone pitched themselves into roles and the 
only thing left was mop-up," he said. "It was the toughest year mentally I've 
ever had, knowing I could still do the job but not getting the call. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, you don't go from 18 saves in 1988 to zero in 1989 unless you've had 
an arm injury or don't get the chance. And I didn't have an arm injury, so 
there's no reason to think I can't go out and do it (successfully) again." 
</P>
<P>
Niedenfuer lives with his wife, actress Judy Landers, and their daughter, 
Lindsey, in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
He prepared for the 1990 season by throwing regularly to Dodger catcher Rick 
Dempsey and said he would not have been surprised if the Mariners had traded or 
released him before spring training, considering that their bullpen seemed set. 
</P>
<P>
But Niedenfuer went to camp and pitched six shutout innings, striking out 
eight, before giving up two runs in the two innings of his last appearance, 
leading to his release two days before the season started. 
</P>
<P>
"It just proved that I never fit in their plans," Niedenfuer said. "The timing 
couldn't have been much worse. I mean, with the 27-man rosters every club 
seemed to have enough pitching. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a list of the clubs that might need help and that I would prefer 
joining, and the first call my agent made was to the Cardinals." 
</P>
<P>
Worrell had surgery in December to repair an elbow ligament and again two weeks 
ago for a nerve impingement in the same elbow. He is out until at least 
midseason, a loss compounded by the early season inability of Manager Whitey 
Herzog to use the tender Ken Dayley or Scott Terry two days in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Mariners are responsible for the bulk of his $800,000 salary, 
Niedenfuer represented a minimal risk. He was signed to a triple-A contract and 
saved two games with a 2.45 ERA in 7 1/3 innings at Louisville before Monday's 
recall. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I'd have to go to triple-A to show whatever club I signed with that I 
could still pitch," he said. "I just didn't anticipate being here this quickly. 
It's a great opportunity, and I don't just say that because some people are 
hurt. I'm glad to be back in the National League, with a contending club, a 
great park to pitch in (Busch Stadium) and a top-notch defense behind me." 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals are still in the relief market, looking at Lee Smith of the 
Boston Red Sox, among others. Herzog, who has had previous success operating a 
bullpen by committee, said Niedenfuer could be used in any role, including that 
of the closer. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't win without a bullpen, and we haven't had one," Herzog said. "Tom is 
going to have to do a job for us. He's throwing 90 (m.p.h.) again. If he gets 
it up to 90 in our ballpark, he's going to get a lot of fly-ball outs. His 
problem has been that he tries to put everyone away with the high fastball. 
You've got to put it in a location where they can't pull it." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Clark jumped on a high fastball in October of '85, and even Herzog 
couldn't resist reiterating a dig he made at the time of the Niedenfuer 
signing, saying: "Considering everything Tom had done for us, we owed it to 
him."

PLAYING MORE THAN PIANO; 
</P>
<P>
PRODIGY WORKS HARD ON KEYBOARD BUT DOESN'T LET IT CONSUME HIS LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
USC piano professor James Bonn remembers when Anders Martinson, then 14, wanted 
to become his private student. The boy called and said he wanted to play the 
difficult Brahms' Paganini Variations for him. 
</P>
<P>
When someone asks to play that particular piece, "You don't hang up," Bonn 
said. "It's a formidable work, technically and musically. I said, 'Please, I 
want to hear you.' " 
</P>
<P>
When Anders, now 16, sits at the keyboard, the piano emits soulful adagios, 
spirited scherzos and whirling rhapsodies. "Brilliant," "breathtaking," 
"amazing for his age," are how his musical elders describe his play. 
</P>
<P>
Anders has captured first place at international piano competitions, played 
live on radio stations KCRW and KFAC, soloed with orchestras in Pasadena and 
Ventura and been invited to master classes with professional pianists. In 
March, he won $3,500 in a three-way tie for the Los Angeles Music Center's 
Spotlight Award, which grants cash scholarships to young artists in Southern 
California. Anders and the other finalists performed before a panel of judges 
at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
His resume, which his father updates religiously on the home computer, lists 
awards, repertoire and performances. It is already four pages long. 
</P>
<P>
"It's scary, he's so good," said Betty Walsh, chairwoman of the music 
department at the private Crossroads School in Santa Monica, where Anders is a 
junior who has a nearly straight-A average. 
</P>
<P>
But Anders is also the unassuming kid next door, who fits rock-hunting, tennis, 
basketball and Ping-Pong around a rigorous piano schedule. Three hours a day 
after school -- six hours a day during the summer -- he toils at a well-worn 
Baldwin grand piano at home, surrounded by the accouterments of his craft: 
tapes, an electric metronome, and stacks of music by Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff, 
Liszt, Prokofiev and Ravel. 
</P>
<P>
Running through Chopin's Scherzo Opus 20 in B minor -- which he performed for 
the Spotlight competition -- his head bows, his brow furrows. And his fingers 
fly. But after an hour, he breaks for 10 minutes of basketball at the back-yard 
hoop. 
</P>
<P>
Anders took up piano at 6, at the same time as his brother Haldan, then age 8, 
started on the violin. Their Scandinavian father and Chinese mother had played 
the same instruments while growing up and figured music would be a wholesome 
pastime. Both sons have ended up prodigies. 
</P>
<P>
At Crossroads School, Anders majors in music but also takes classes like 
calculus, natural science and Greek. Headmaster Paul Cummins said the school's 
650 other students "think he's just another kid. Some know he plays piano, most 
probably don't. Many don't know how impressive (a musical talent) he is." 
</P>
<P>
When he's not in class, Cummins said, Anders is likely to be found on the 
playground, playing basketball with other students. "It always makes me nervous 
for fear he's going to sprain his fingers," Cummins said. 
</P>
<P>
Anders competes about twice a month and accompanies his older brother in violin 
competitions as well. Haldan, accompanied by Anders, was a winner in last 
year's Spotlight contest, which led to a repeat performance on "The Tonight 
Show." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, Anders said, he enters competitions to win, but other times he does 
so simply for the "opportunity to perform" and "try out a piece." 
</P>
<P>
Despite more than 100 competitions and other concerts in the last five years, 
Anders is still a bundle of nerves before a performance. 
</P>
<P>
"My stomach starts turning really fast. I won't eat anything before, because 
it'll come right out again." He frets that he'll forget the music. 
</P>
<P>
Though piano dominates much of his life, Anders is not a one-dimensional music 
nerd. He isn't planning to go to Julliard but to a "regular college" where 
he'll be a music major. "I don't want to be in an atmosphere where there's 
nothing but people playing nothing but music all the time. . . . I just want to 
do other things also." 
</P>
<P>
A tour of his bedroom gives ample evidence of his diverse interests. It is home 
to a snake, a lizard, fish, a starling he found after a competition in Orange 
County, a dove, an octopus, sea anemones and dozens of hermit crabs from local 
tidepools. 
</P>
<P>
The shelves are cluttered with sea urchins, crab shells, a piggy bank 
collection, soccer and school science fair trophies, souvenirs from Hong Kong 
-- and the Spotlight trophy. He describes with excitement the family's camping 
trip to New Mexico during spring break and the hours he spent digging to 
unearth two geodes. 
</P>
<P>
"If I can become a concert pianist, I guess that'd be nice," he said. "But 
there are a lot of good pianists out there -- thousands across the country. 
</P>
<P>
"Music is not the most important thing in the world; it's just that that's what 
I do well." 
</P>
<P>
For him, it is reward enough to know he has played well and to hear the 
applause of an appreciative audience. And sometimes, Anders gets more than 
applause from his audience. 
</P>
<P>
After a recital last month of Beethoven's "Eroica" variations, for example, "a 
person came up and said, 'I was crying through the whole thing,' " Anders 
recalled. "And that made me feel good."

SAXOPHONIST, OSCAR NOMINEE DEXTER GORDON DIES AT 67 
</P>

Dexter Gordon, the free-spirited saxophone improvisationist whose melancholy 
demeanor and laconic wit permeated one of the most praised jazz films of all 
time, died Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon, nominated for a best actor Academy Award for his raspy-voiced portrayal 
of the drug- and booze-weary cynical jazz artist in the film "Round Midnight," 
was 67. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia said 
Gordon died of kidney failure. He also was being treated for cancer of the 
larynx. 
</P>
<P>
Although a force in modern music for four decades, Gordon had not played his 
tenor saxophone in public for four years before emerging on the world stage 
after the 1986 film, which featured a cast of black American musicians who had 
fled bigotry in America for the more tolerant racial climate of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
At 6 feet, 5 inches, Gordon was a dominating figure on and off stage. In person 
he was as soft-spoken as his film persona, Dale Turner, and suffered many of 
the health problems that also plagued that fictional character, which he 
described as a composite of several musician friends. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon had battled a drug and alcohol problem in his younger years but by 1960 
claimed that he had conquered both. 
</P>
<P>
His brushes with the law kept him from acquiring a nightclub work permit and he 
went to Europe. A 1962 performance in London that showcased his laid-back, 
behind-the-beat phrasing proved so successful that he stayed in Europe for the 
next several years, making an occasional trip to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to New York in 1975 and, in 1980, was elected to the Jazz Hall of 
Fame. Readers of Down Beat magazine named him "musician of the year" in 1978 
and 1980. 
</P>
<P>
But by 1987, Los Angeles Times jazz critic Leonard Feather said after reviewing 
a Hollywood Bowl appearance that Gordon "was a once formidable talent no longer 
in command of the values that established him as the foremost tenor saxophonist 
of the be-bop era." 
</P>
<P>
"Round Midnight" was not Gordon's first film. While in jail in Chino in the 
mid-1950s on a narcotics charge, he portrayed a musician in a low-budget prison 
picture. In 1960 he appeared in the Los Angeles production of "The Connection," 
a play about addicts. 
</P>
<P>
Just before his most recent illness, Gordon had finished another film, 
"Awakenings," with Robert De Niro and Robin Williams. 
</P>
<P>
First a clarinetist and then a saxophonist while in his early teens in his 
native Los Angeles, Gordon fell under the sophisticated influence of Lester 
Young but later mastered the extroverted vibrancy of Illinois Jacquet and the 
complex harmonics of Charlie Parker. 
</P>
<P>
One of his most famous periods was a 1947-52 tour with fellow tenor saxophonist 
Wardell Gray, billed as a "Battle of the Saxes." 
</P>
<P>
He was the son of a Los Angeles physician whose patients included Duke 
Ellington and Lionel Hampton, whose band the young Gordon joined in 1940 when 
he was only 17. He appeared in his 20s with the Louis Armstrong and Billy 
Eckstine bands and then joined Parker in New York. 
</P>
<P>
But in the 1950s his career slowed with the decline of be-bop and it was not 
until he began a series of albums on the Blue Note label, coupled with his 
European successes, that he again became popular. 
</P>
<P>
"Round Midnight," titled for the Theolonius Monk signature composition, came as 
a surprise to Gordon, who became the only musician ever nominated for an Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly one day (co-writer-director Bertrand) Tavernier came to my apartment 
in New York," Gordon said in a 1987 interview with Feather. "He'd seen me 
working in a Paris club when I was a young man and he had this idea for a movie 
about jazz. . . . I had trouble believing that he was serious . . . but I 
somehow believed in him. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
After the acclaim that greeted the film and its Oscar-winning score -- 
juxtaposed with the critical cry that it took a Frenchman to define the angst 
of American jazz musicians -- Gordon became an overnight celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
He accepted his new-found fame with the ready smile that had marked his life. 
</P>
<P>
He found it amazing, he said amid all the Oscar hullabaloo, that -- despite his 
dissipative lifestyle -- "I'm still alive." 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Maxine, and five children. Services are pending in 
New York.
