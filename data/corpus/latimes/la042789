WE ALL LOVED LUCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Generations of Americans loved Lucy. More than three decades ago, in the 
adolescence of television, Monday nights belonged to Lucille Ball as she 
schemed to do what she wanted to do, especially if her husband and "I Love 
Lucy" co-star Desi Arnaz didn't want her to do it. All these decades later, 
there is a national outburst of affection and remembrance for the 77-year-old 
comedienne who died Tuesday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
In the main, the outpouring of sentiment focuses on this zany redhead's 
do-anything nerve. Her comedy centered on everybody's everyday foibles and 
everyday joys -- everything from getting in trouble because of bragging to 
craving pickles while pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
Those who may not have especially enjoyed her mugging style of comedy had to 
appreciate her business sense that kept her at the forefront of the production 
side of the industry long after the door closed on her TV series and on her 
marriage to Arnaz as well. 
</P>
<P>
Lucille Ball was the last of the quartet that brought the Ricardos and the 
Mertzes into our homes. They were our neighbors, too, and our entertainment. 
They made us laugh.

PROSECUTION OF MICHAEL MILKEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is interesting to compare Benjamin J. Stein's column "With Friends Like Mike 
Milken . . . His LBO Advantage Is Cut From the Hides of Workers" to Paul Craig 
Roberts' column "Junk Bond King Victim of Envy, Legal Lynching" (Op-Ed Page, 
April 12). 
</P>
<P>
In a nine-paragraph article, Roberts devotes one glowing and superficial 
paragraph to analyzing the effect of Milken's machinations in the junk-bond 
market. The other eight paragraphs amount to a rather shrill and 
unsubstantiated outpouring of "moral" outrage at those who would dare attack 
poor billionaire Mike Milken. 
</P>
<P>
In comparison, Stein devotes his article to a close examination of the impact 
that a leveraged buyout has on a company -- particularly on the employees. As 
Stein correctly points out, leveraged buyouts are achieved through the use of 
"high-yield bonds and other devices to finance takeovers of companies by their 
managements or by outsiders." This then requires the acquired company, now 
loaded with debt, to take draconian measures to streamline its operation in 
order to service the debt. In other words, while Milken and the lawyers get 
rich, workers are "laid off, cut back, and disenfranchised." 
</P>
<P>
One can only wonder at the underlying motivation for Roberts fuming "moral" 
indignation and consuming concern for Milken and his total lack of compassion 
for the real victims of leveraged buyouts -- the workers.

A COLD SHOULDER;

<P>
MISPLACED SENTIMENTALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Modern medicine probably has contributed more to the practical liberation of 
mankind than all political ideologies and economic systems combined. No other 
form of human endeavor has done as much to eliminate suffering, degradation and 
grief from our daily lives. 
</P>
<P>
One of the many traumas inflicted by the AIDS epidemic is the grim reminder of 
what life was like in all the long centuries through which disease, mysterious 
and merciless, rampaged at will. 
</P>
<P>
These simple observations ought to be self-evident. We repeat them because the 
nation's medical researchers currently are enduring the annual week of siege 
imposed by so-called animal rights activists, who believe that all experiments 
involving live animals ought to be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
These eccentric demands should not to be confused with the serious concerns of 
responsible animal welfare advocates. In recent years the latter have done much 
to remind scientists of how important it is to police the small minority of 
researchers who sometimes have taken an insensitive or overly casual approach 
to experimentation on animals. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, if their consequences were not so serious,the actions of the animals 
rights cranks could be ignored for what they are, self-righteous tantrums 
masquerading as appeals to conscience. However, because those involved are 
willing to engage in illegal disruption and even burglary, their campaign 
already has forced a diversion of attention and resources our medical 
laboratories can ill afford. 
</P>
<P>
Research on non-human species is an unfortunate, but indispensable part of 
valid medical science. Though zealots may claim otherwise, no tissue culture or 
computer simulation can take the place of a complex living organism in 
determining the usefulness and, more important, the safety of new drugs and 
medical technologies. 
</P>
<P>
At the root of this silly controversy there is, indeed, cruelty and 
callousness. It does not, however, occur in our medical laboratories, but in 
minds so self-absorbed and vulgar that they are able to equate the suffering of 
mice with that of dying children. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the animals rights movement is a misplaced sentimentality pretending to 
be compassion. It should exert no claim on any conscience capable of mature and 
sober reflection.

Transamerica Corp.: The San Francisco-based insurance and financial services 
company said first-quarter net income rose to $70.8 million from $30.7 million 
a year ago. Results for 1988 included a $36.9-million one-time reduction for 
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for income taxes. Revenue 
advanced to $1.59 billion from $1.53 billion. The results were "generally in 
line with our expectations and were consistent with our earlier statement that 
we expect 1989 to be a good year for Transamerica," the firm said.

Du Pont: First-quarter profit rose 25% to $736 million from a year ago. The 
chemical company based in Wilmington, Del., reported that sales rose 10% to 
$8.7 billion, compared to last year. The company said the improved report 
reflected strong worldwide demand, higher selling prices and higher crude oil 
prices. The company's major products are petroleum through its subsidiary, 
Conoco, nylon and other fibers, polymers and agricultural chemicals.

JACK SMITH: TIMES WHEN LIFE DOESN'T COMPUTE

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Computerized bookkeeping is swift and accurate, until an error creeps in -- 
then it can become a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
Recently my wife applied for credit with a Midwestern mail-order house, only to 
receive a rejection form listing various delinquencies, none of which we were 
guilty of. Since she had done business with other mail-order houses for years, 
she was naturally shocked and embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
I phoned the credit agency only to be told, by an answering machine, that I 
would have to write a letter and ask for a copy of our report. There was no way 
to reach anyone in person. I wrote a righteous letter attesting to our solvency 
and our blameless record, knowing that the agency would not be moved by any 
protestations of financial rectitude. When the report came, we found that we 
had been charged with the repeated delinquencies of a woman whose name was 
similar to my wife's and who had been assigned her social security number. 
</P>
<P>
I'm pleased to say that we finally had the woman's record disentangled from 
ours, and that the mail-order house has now been added to the numerous others 
with which my wife does business. 
</P>
<P>
Orange attorney Marvin D. Mayer writes that his son took a year off from his 
graduate studies to work as a contract officer for the Navy in Washington. He 
wanted a vacation first in California, and bought a discount airline ticket for 
$250. Meanwhile, the Navy asked for a volunteer from his group for a one-day 
meeting with a contractor in Southern California. The Navy would, of course, 
pay for transportation. Since the trip coincided with his vacation, the young 
man volunteered. 
</P>
<P>
He asked the Navy to reimburse him for his $250 ticket. The Navy said that was 
impossible. There was no official procedure for reimbursing him. They would 
have to buy another ticket for $950. Finally, the issue was resolved sensibly, 
and the Navy paid the $250, saving $700 for more crucial expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
Mayer also reports that his wife, Judy, was to undergo bunion surgery, and her 
physician advised her to have some minor corrective plastic surgery at the same 
time, thus avoiding two trips to surgery and two anesthesias. She agreed, and 
notified her insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
Later the hospital advised her that the insurer had approved the bunion surgery 
and one night in the hospital; however, the plastic surgery was considered an 
outpatient procedure, and she would have to leave the hospital immediately 
afterward. She naturally wondered how she could stay in the hospital one night 
and not stay in the hospital one night. Finally, the conflict was resolved. She 
had both surgeries and stayed in the hospital overnight. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps," Mayer reflects, "the fact that these two cases worked out 
satisfactorily is cause for some optimism." 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, after one of the big earthquakes, my wife and I borrowed 
$2,500 from the government to pay for earthquake damage repairs to our house. 
About that time The Times published a story about widespread cheating by 
borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
They were buying cars, refurnishing their houses, and taking vacations on the 
money. I went to the agency and said I wanted to pay our loan back. They 
laughed. They said no way. It would take an act of Congress. I threatened to 
petition my congressman. They found a way. We may be the only people who ever 
paid one of those loans back. 
</P>
<P>
A more comical impasse is reported by Gene Gach, who encloses the following 
letter from a Newport Beach firm: 
</P>
<P>
"You kindly placed an order with us on Wednesday, July 13th, for which your 
Visa was charged $0.00. Our monitoring equipment alerted us that this charge 
was duplicated, thus we wrote to you on July 20th advising that we reversed the 
duplicate charge on Thursday, July 21st. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I have now been advised that the transaction of July 13th was in fact not 
duplicated and that our reversal of July 20th was in error. Therefore we are 
reinstating the original charge of $0.00 which will appear on your Visa 
statement with the original transaction date of July 13, 1988." 
</P>
<P>
The letter assures Gach that the company's computer program has been rewritten, 
so such an error will not occur again. 
</P>
<P>
What Gach wants to know is whether he will have to pay any interest on the 
$0.00.

ART BUCHWALD: DESPITE WARTS, DEMOCRACY IN DEMAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Buchwald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The worst thing that a totalitarian government can do is to give its people a 
little democracy," Wabash of the Political Dynamics Institute said. "It's like 
making them a little pregnant." 
</P>
<P>
I was in his office and we were following uprisings all over the world on his 
shortwave radio. He pointed to Soviet Georgia on a map. "Every time Gorbachev 
loosens up and offers his people a bunch of grapes, they want the whole 
vineyard. All of the republics are demanding either autonomy or complete 
freedom from the mother country. It proves that if you are a dictator and allow 
just a small amount of light into your country, nobody is going to say 'thank 
you.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Why would anybody want to live in a democracy when you can't get tickets to 
'Phantom of the Opera'?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
Wabash answered, "The dilemma is how to reform the old system when people want 
a new one. I'm not Red-baiting when I say that communism doesn't work. 
Gorbachev is offering Marxism with freedom, and it is a contradiction in 
terms." 
</P>
<P>
I agreed. "I think that the Russians should back off and take a serious look at 
what they are demonstrating for. We are a society of pizzas and Big Macs. We 
depend on Japan for our TV sets, and South Korea and Malaysia for our clothes. 
The New York Times crossword puzzle is much more difficult today than it was 10 
years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Wabash said, "We are not only seeing an internal revolution but an external one 
as well. All the Soviet Bloc countries are demanding their freedom. Every 
country behind the Iron Curtain is poised for true democratic reform, including 
elections and multiple-party voting." 
</P>
<P>
"They must be stopped," I declared. "If they all adopt the capitalist system, 
there won't be an empty parking place in the whole wide world." 
</P>
<P>
"The political storm clouds are not only blowing over Eastern Europe but over 
China as well," Wabash explained. "We are watching Chinese students demanding 
the same democratic privileges that we have." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't they know if that happens, they will have to read the National Enquirer 
every week and watch Morton Downey and Geraldo Rivera on television?" 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter. They want our way of life, even if it means that students 
in China will be wearing Ralph Lauren clothes to demonstrations. You can't stop 
the people once they have taken to the streets." 
</P>
<P>
"Do the Estonian people have any idea what it's like to be ruled by 
(Washington) Mayor (Marion) Barry?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't care. They are willing to take Barry over some crooked Soviet 
bureaucrat who is telling them how to live. The world is a different place now 
from what it was 12 months ago. No one is demonstrating for communism or 
fascism. They're all yelling for their right to phone in to a radio talk-show 
host and make a fortune in the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone has to tell them before it's too late that democracy has many holes in 
it. It's a messy system because no one agrees with anybody else. A totalitarian 
government speaks with a single voice -- a democracy talks with a million. 
Besides, under communism, you don't have savings-and-loans banks failing every 
day." 
</P>
<P>
Wabash said, "I'm afraid that you can't put the genie back in the bottle. 
Whatever the Russian people wind up with, it isn't going to look anything like 
Lenin's dream." 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe when the Soviets find out what it costs to stay in an American hospital, 
they'll reject any ideas they ever had of being like us," I suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Wabash shook his head. "They're buying our system, warts and all. Even the KGB 
is trying to get prayers back into the schools."

From the High-Definition Television File: A high-definition television

Good Morgan: Veteran comedian Pat Buttram will start delivering a few minutes 
of humorous commentary on Robert W. Morgan's morning KMPC radio program 
beginning Monday. "I finally got tired of all the deejays in the morning 
quoting my jokes. . . . I decided to start getting paid for all those jokes," 
Buttram said Wednesday. Morgan's 5:30-9 a.m. show will include the daily 
feature "Pat Buttram on Location" during which Buttram will call in from around 
the country and comment on the day's news events or other topical material. 
"It'll be kind of on-the-scene commentary about whatever is going on," said 
Buttram, 70, who got his start in radio in 1934. ALEENE MacMINN

A $16-million defamation suit filed against commentator-humorist Andy Rooney by 
a company that didn't like his consumer report on its product has been thrown 
out by a judge in Phoenix. Unelko Corp. of Scottsdale, Ariz., the maker of 
Rain-X, a liquid that is supposed to make rain and snow roll off windshields, 
had sued Rooney over remarks he made about the product during a 1988 "60 
Minutes" broadcast. U.S. District Judge Robert C. Broomfield ruled that 
Rooney's comments about Rain-X were the commentator's opinion and thus legally 
protected. The judge agreed with a statement Rooney made on television after 
the suit was filed. "This fellow sent me his product to evaluate, and I did," 
Rooney said. "Was I only expected to comment on it if I loved it?"ALEENE

NBC News President Michael Gartner says "we didn't do anything wrong" in trying 
in advance to line up interviews with jurors after the verdict is given in the 
Oliver North trial. The judge in the case rapped NBC for sending one-sentence 
letters of invitation last weekend to the homes of jurors now considering a 
verdict in North's federal court trial in Washington. Gartner, speaking 
Wednesday to the New York chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts 
and Sciences, called it "just good reporting, trying to set up an interview." 
On another issue, Gartner said NBC had made a mistake in closing its Houston 
bureau in January as part of a cost-cutting effort and said a bureau will be 
reopened in Texas. He did not specify when or where the bureau would be 
located. ALEENE MacMINN

"Big" looks like it could rule the rental roost for a while, since its closest 
contenders on the Billboard magazine chart have already passed their peak. 
"Big's" big competition is most likely to come from the newcomers bounding onto 
the chart this week, including "Tucker" (No. 10) and "Gorillas in the Mist" 
(No. 14), which features Sigourney Weaver's Oscar-nominated performance. Other 
major chart entries are the romantic "Crossing Delancey" (No. 20), starring Amy 
Irving, and grim "Dead Ringers" (No. 25), boasting Jeremy Irons' acclaimed 
performance. "Betrayed," a drama about love blooming in a white-supremacist 
stronghold, crawled up three notches to No. 6. On the sales chart, Michael 
Jackson's "Moonwalker" is still No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
* Many critics were chilly toward "Cocktail," starring heartthrob Tom Cruise as 
an ambitious bartender. But fans -- particularly all those female Cruise 
fanatics -- were intoxicated by "Cocktail," which raked in $77.2 million at the 
box office. It debuted relatively low -- No. 27 on the rental chart -- but 
could shoot up to No. 1 in the next few weeks.

 Fernando E. Solanas' great tango-tinged lament for all that was lost during 
the time of Argentina's military dictatorship. This dreamy, heart-breaking and 
witty film flows easily between past and present, the living and the dead, as 
Solanas, returning home himself after a long exile, follows the life of a newly 
released political prisoner (Miguel Angel Sola) and his friends. A superb 
companion film to "Tango: The Exile of Gardel" from the maker of the landmark 
"Hour of the Furnaces." RECOMMENDED KEVIN THOMAS

There is a choice group of dishes from restaurants that have left an indelible 
mark on the Los Angeles culinary scene. 
</P>
<P>
They are dishes you would drop a date with a best friend to taste. They are 
dishes with an illustrious past and bright future. They possess a bold 
character and unmistakable charm -- along, of course, with exceptional flavor. 
They have survived the test of time. 
</P>
<P>
They are, in fact, a class unto themselves, defying description. Each dish 
stands on its own, as proud of having originated in a diner as in a chi-chi 
bistro. 
</P>
<P>
Shall we name a few? Maestro, please: 
</P>
<P>
The Brown Derby's Cobb Salad and Grapefruit Cake, Chasen's chili, Scandia's 
Gravad Lax or Pumpernickel Toast, La Scala's Chopped Salad, Madame Wu's Garden 
Chicken Salad, Musso and Frank Grill's Chicken Pot Pie and Flannel Cakes, 
Smokey Joe's Garlic Toast, the Original Pantry's Coleslaw, Marie Callender's 
Corn Bread. There are dozens more in all categories of cuisine, but in the 
interest of space, we shall confine our interest to a handful. 
</P>
<P>
How did we obtain the recipes for these local restaurant specialties? Readers 
have requested their favorite restaurant recipes over a period of three decades 
in columns written by The Times Food staff. We, in turn, asked restaurants to 
share these recipes, and most of the restaurants approached have complied 
graciously. We have reprinted many of these recipes repeatedly because of 
popular demand. 
</P>
<P>
Some restaurant recipes, however, could not be obtained. For those we developed 
similar recipes, reconstructing the recipe in The Times' Test Kitchen to appear 
and taste as close to the original as possible. 
</P>
<P>
While the copied recipes cannot actually be named after the restaurant, some, 
such as the chili from Chasen's that was renamed Chasing Chili, are 
identifiable. The chili, as one can imagine, is typical of the California 
variety made with chunks of meat and pinto beans in a rather thick, tomato 
sauce. It's hot with chile taste but not as hot as you might find chili in the 
Southwest or Texas. Chasen's chili, although not on the menu, is served as a 
side dish from a copper saucepan warming on a brazier at the table. Crackers, 
cheese and sour cream are add-ons. 
</P>
<P>
The development of these copies has a diverse history. Some were simply 
reconstructed by one of The Times' Food staff and tested in The Times' Test 
Kitchen, while others were sent to us by readers. 
</P>
<P>
The chili is such an example. Numerous readers sent us copies of recipes that 
credited Chasen's. Each time, Chasen's denied having shared the recipe with 
anyone. We picked the best of those submitted, tested a bit and adapted a bit. 
We now feel we have a most reasonable copy of the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the recipes from restaurants come directly from the restaurant chefs or 
owners themselves upon request. Jean Leon, owner of La Scala Boutique, Beverly 
Hills, has graciously shared recipes from his restaurant, including the salad 
nibbled on by movie stars stopping at the boutique for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
The chopped salad contains Italian-style ingredients, such as salami and 
mozzarella cheese. The dressing has a French touch with the addition of dry 
mustard to a basic vinaigrette. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Wu also graciously shared her prized recipe for Chinese chicken salad, 
which, says Wu, was fashioned, with assistance from her chef, after a similar 
but more complex Chinese cold dish. Hundreds of restaurants nationwide -- 
Chinese and otherwise -- now serve similar chicken salads. The Madame Wu's 
Garden, Santa Monica, version is outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
The Cobb Salad, which originated at the Brown Derby, also has become a generic 
favorite nationwide. It was Bob Cobb, one of the original operators of the 
Brown Derby, who created the legendary salad made with lettuce topped with 
strips of chopped avocado, tomatoes, bacon, chicken and cheese. Cobb salad has 
become a generic dish found on just about every American salad menu nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Satisfied Cobb salad fans, who frequented the Brown Derby since its beginnings 
in 1926 when patrons such as Mary Pickford, Louella Parsons and Loretta Young 
dined there, have spawned an huge Cobb salad-eating population. 
</P>
<P>
The Grapefruit Cake, also served at the Brown Derby, has been a long-time 
favorite of Los Angeles Times readers. It still is served in its original form 
-- with grapefruit segments glistening on top of a cream cheese frosting. It's 
a beautiful cake to serve for special occasions or on an especially festive 
coffee or tea table. 
</P>
<P>
Scandia, a Los Angeles' landmark restaurant since 1946, has delighted diners 
with numerous favorites, particularly Scandinavian Gravad Lax (cured salmon) 
served paper-thin sprinkled with French-fried tidbits of salmon skin and a 
superb mustard dill sauce on the side. 
</P>
<P>
Scandia also was among the first restaurants, according to Raymond L. 
MacCurtin, executive chef, to serve Pumpernickel Cheese Toast, which has since 
made the rounds of bad and good restaurants nationwide. The toast should be 
served crisp and hot from the oven, never soggy or soft. If you want to reheat 
pumpernickel toast, use a conventional oven, not the microwave, which produces 
a soggy, soft toast -- unless, of course, you prefer soft toast. 
</P>
<P>
Musso and Frank Grill, touted as the oldest restaurant in Hollywood, has, 
according to long-time maitre d' Philip Cano, served the same menu since its 
opening in 1919. The Flannel Cakes are a daily breakfast favorite developed by 
Jean La Rue, former chef, as an Americanized version of the oversized French 
crepe. Today, Bob Wootten, grill chef, turns out the Flannel Cakes at Musso and 
Frank Grill, dousing them with melted butter and syrup as they are served. 
</P>
<P>
Chicken Pot Pie is a Thursday special at Musso and Frank Grill. The pie, 
chock-full of large nuggets of chicken, potatoes, carrots and peas, is covered 
with a flaky pastry and baked to a golden tinge. The pie comes to the table 
already dished up but we suggest allowing dinner guests to have a view of this 
American classic in the baking dish before it is served. We give a similarly 
reconstructed recipe. 
</P>
<P>
Reader requests for a recipe from another old landmark restaurant in the 
downtown area of Los Angeles -- the Original Pantry Coleslaw -- keep coming, 
making the recipe an annual favorite of The Times' Culinary SOS column. The 
slaw is a simple, creamy type made with mayonnaise and seasoned with garlic, 
onion and mustard powders. A touch of sugar adds a sweet note. 
</P>
<P>
The Tony Roma restaurant chain cannot share their recipe for the onion rings, 
but a close facsimile was developed by Donna Deane, home economist, in The 
Times' Test Kitchen. Tony Roma's staff did, however, offer a tip: Pack the 
onions loosely, not firmly, in the loaf pan so they will not become soggy. 
</P>
<P>
Marie Callender's restaurant officials could not part with their secret corn 
bread recipe either, but readers persisted. Taking a tip from a reader who 
suggested we combine yellow cake mix and corn bread mix, we decided to test its 
merits. The result of combining a yellow cake mix with a corn bread batter 
works just fine, and the recipe has been printed as a reasonable substitute 
ever since. It's a rather sweet corn bread that is particularly favored by 
diners in Los Angeles.

LET'S EAT OUT: FAMILY STYLE DINING AT MON JAPANESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You need to slide, rather than push or pull, the front door open at Mon 
Japanese in Tarzana. Then part the noren (hanging fabric panels) to enter into 
this cozy little neighborhood restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Run by a Japanese family, the restaurant also attracts a family clientele. 
Grass-cloth walls are lined by booths with paper lanterns hanging above the 
tables. The L-shaped dining area wraps around the kitchen, leaving only enough 
room for three tables in the center. 
</P>
<P>
The photo on our table advertising their special dinners-for-two didn't look 
very appetizing, but we ordered the shogun boat for the sake of research. Our 
meal arrived on a 2 1/2-foot-long wooden vessel, which some might consider a 
bit hokey, but sure caught the eye of the children who had just been seated in 
the next booth. It wasn't long before a sister ship floated onto their table. 
</P>
<P>
Attractively arranged on our boat's deck were lobster, tempura, beef and 
chicken teriyaki and two cut oranges. Only the lobster was disappointing. 
Although the stuffed shell contained nice big chunks of lobster meat, they were 
combined with mushrooms and it was difficult to figure out what else, in a much 
too heavy cream sauce. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the tempura batter on the shrimp and vegetables was light and 
lacy; although fried in oil, they weren't the least bit greasy. The teriyaki 
sauce was also outstanding -- not too salty and an excellent complement to both 
the very tender strips of New York steak and boneless chicken. 
</P>
<P>
The dinner was certainly sumptuous, especially considering it also included 
miso soup, rice, sunomono and green tea ice cream. The miso soup at Mon 
Japanese has plenty of flavor with shreds of seaweed and a little sliced green 
onion. Their sunomono consists of thinly sliced cucumber and shredded carrot 
marinated in a slightly sweet vinegar dressing. 
</P>
<P>
The samurai boat dinner includes beef teriyaki, sashimi, tempura, chicken 
teriyaki, fruit and green tea ice cream. The Mon boat consists of California 
roll, fried oyster, egg roll, chicken teriyaki, fruit and green tea ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
A la carte dinners are less extravagant, but still include soup and rice. The 
friend who introduced me to this restaurant ordered the salmon, requesting that 
it be grilled longer than the rare normally served. It came beautifully 
prepared and accompanied by a simple salad. 
</P>
<P>
Combination dinners combine two items and are accompanied by soup, sunomono and 
rice. The same trio comes with the lobster specials and Mon special dinners, 
which feature three items. We were pleased with the salmon teriyaki, tempura 
and sushi combination artfully presented on a wood framed tray. 
</P>
<P>
The half-dozen sushi, including California roll, shrimp (ebi) and yellow tail 
(hamachi) tasted very fresh. The salmon was still nice and moist and the 
tempura equally as well-prepared as it had been for the shogun boat. 
</P>
<P>
A pot of green tea brewed with crispy rice is the complementary meal 
accompaniment. They also offer sake, Japanese bottled and draft beers, plum 
wine, domestic beer and wine, soft drinks and ice tea. 
</P>
<P>
Green tea ice cream is offered a la carte, as well as with the boat dinners. 
It's refreshing, although nothing to rave about. Other desserts include fruit 
and ice cream tempura. 
</P>
<P>

ABOUT WINE: SANTA BARBARA COUNTY'S WINE REPUTATION FINALLY STARTS TAKING ROOT

LOS OLIVOS, Calif.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the vinous spotlight in California shines on Napa and Sonoma, Santa Barbara 
County stands quietly to one side, waiting for recognition. 
</P>
<P>
Without much fanfare, the image of Santa Barbara is creeping forward. In 
particular, the area is staking a claim as a region quite hospitable to two 
Burgundian grape varieties, Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. But this image hasn't 
advanced so far or fast as to keep out the wine pioneers. Santa Barbara still 
holds hope for aspiring wine makers on a budget.

For one thing, vineyard land is far less expensive than in the northern reaches 
of the state (where a planted acre of vines commands $25,000). Also, the land 
is workable; little of it is rugged forestland. Mostly, you get gently rolling 
hills. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it's tested: More than three dozen wineries exist in the county, and 
famed wineries in Napa (with reputations as exalted as Chateau Chevalier, 
Chateau Montelena and ZD) long ago discovered that the area had a lot to offer. 
So much so that they bought grapes from Santa Barbara County for their 
award-winning Chardonnays. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Napa Valley Buyers 
</P>
<P>
When Napa Valley-based Beringer Vineyards recently bought 3,000 acres of 
vineyard land here, it verified the fact that even the big boys know good value 
when they see it. 
</P>
<P>
Still, no matter where in the world of wine a young entrepreneur sinks roots, 
the wine business is a costly enterprise, both in terms of money and in the 
time and emotion spent on getting it up and running. Yet, Bill Wathan and Dick 
Dore feel they couldn't have gotten into the wine business in any other region. 
</P>
<P>
Wathan and Dore believe they can cope with the expense, money and emotion 
because they have found the only spot left that's not only affordable but 
affords them a climate and soil that will allow for the production of truly 
classical wine from the Burgundian grape varieties. 
</P>
<P>
The name of this tiny venture is Foxen and it is a prototype start-up winery, 
reminiscent of many that got going in Santa Barbara wine country, a two-hour 
drive north of Los Angeles in which wine has become a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
On a per-capita basis, Santa Barbara County may be the most wine-savvy county 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the city of Santa Barbara, with a population of 79,000, boasts a 
half-dozen superior wine shops, far more than are found in any other city of 
that size in California. And a huge percentage of the county's restaurants 
feature local wines, by the glass and by the bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Also, winery owners speak of a county government that understands its needs and 
doesn't throw up unnecessary roadblocks to vineyard and winery plans. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, unlike the vintner-grower squabbles that exist in many other areas of 
the wine world, folks here seem to work together. (A couple of years ago at the 
Central Coast wine competition in Santa Maria, the award for wine man of the 
year was presented to Santa Maria grower Dale Hampton. When it was announced, 
the first ones on their feet in standing ovation were winery owners.) 
</P>
<P>
The county's modern viticultural history started about 20 years ago, with huge 
blocks of vineyard land owned by insurance companies and other conglomerates 
who sold their grapes to established wineries. One vineyard that rolled over 
2,000 acres, Tepusquet, became the source for some of the state's top 
Chardonnays and Rieslings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gains Recognition 
</P>
<P>
Hampton began to gain recognition for a number of his properties about eight 
years ago. One of them in particular, the Sierra Madre Vineyard, began to grab 
headlines for its wine quality, notably Pinot Noir. In 1984, a ton of Sierra 
Madre Pinot Noir cost $450. Today, a ton is $1,000. Another vineyard with a 
growing reputation for quality is Bien Nacido. 
</P>
<P>
Wineries existed here before 1974, the year Brooks and Kate Firestone founded 
their winery on a knoll above Zaca Station Road. However, it was significant 
that Brooks was heir to the Firestone tire fortune and probably could have 
bought into the Napa Valley. Choosing Santa Barbara County meant a lot to the 
region's image. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, Firestone (with Andre Tchelistcheff, the state's greatest 
wine maker, as consultant) began to release a series of wines showing promise. 
There was an erratic nature to the line, however, partly because weather 
conditions change subtlely here and new wineries often need a few vintages to 
sort through the variations in the grapes. 
</P>
<P>
One wine maker who saw through the problems was Ken Brown, who kicked off a 
dramatic career as wine maker with Zaca Mesa, located at the base of a hill far 
back from Firestone off Foxen Canyon Road. Founded in 1978, the winery began to 
produce a string of top-flight wines including some stylish and deeply flavored 
Chardonnays and Pinot Noirs. It was further verification that Santa Barbara had 
the stuff to do it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Excellent Wines 
</P>
<P>
After a few years of inconsistency, now under wine maker Gale Sysock, Zaca Mesa 
has come back with a number of excellent wines, notably Pinot Noir. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, indications that Pinot Noir was potentially a star here came from 
Sanford and Benedict, a tiny winery west of here. A 1977 Pinot Noir from 
partners Mike Benedict and Richard Sanford, though not a perfect wine, showed 
traces of Burgundian qualities, and it found favor among many who felt Santa 
Barbara could be the place they'd been looking for to produce the great 
Burgundian wines. 
</P>
<P>
That same year, Firestone too produced a great Pinot Noir, adding to the luster 
of the region. But years passed before greater evidence pointed to the county 
as a true haven for these wines. 
</P>
<P>
It was verified when Zaca Mesa and Sanford, then off on his own venture, began 
making Pinot Noir of grand quality. And periodically, others would make a fine 
Pinot Noir. Vega, Los Vineros, Au Bon Climat and Austin have done well with the 
variety. 
</P>
<P>
In Chardonnay, Jim Clendenin and Adam Tolmach turned Au Bon Climat into a cult 
winery with deeply complex wines, and Brian Babcock likewise found a style that 
fit the region: rich and complex, but with high acidity. 
</P>
<P>
The sleeper of the bunch is Santa Barbara Winery, which was founded in downtown 
Santa Barbara in 1962 and which once took pride in making fruit and berry 
wines. Located two blocks from the Pacific Ocean, this may be the closest 
winery to a sea in the Western Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
The place was able to shed its image of making blackberry wine when Bruce 
McGuire joined up as wine maker for the 1982 harvest. His wines are essentially 
produced off 70 acres of vines planted to the north, between Buellton (the town 
Pea Soup Anderson made famous) and Lompoc (the town W.C. Fields made infamous), 
west of Highway 101. 
</P>
<P>
In the last year, McGuire's wines have won so many medals the winery should 
consider buying a safe. His first Pinot Noir (1986, $11) won a slew of medals; 
his 1988 Beaujour Zinfandel ($7) is a light red wine made like a Cru 
Beaujolais, and as good a warm-weather red as you can find; his 1988 White 
Zinfandel ($6) is perhaps the best I have ever tasted, and his 1988 Chenin 
Blanc ($7) is barrel-fermented and a dead ringer for Chardonnay. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Brown left Zaca Mesa in 1984 to found his own property, Byron, and now that 
winery's image has shot up with the release of 1985 and 1986 Pinot Noirs that 
have excited tasters around the world. 
</P>
<P>
And Sanford, with his wine maker Bruno D'Alfonso working from a new winery, has 
developed a wide following for his stylish, rich Chardonnays and Pinot Noirs 
that seem to improve every year. 
</P>
<P>
A winery that has gained little fame because of its marketing approach is 
Gainey. Wine maker Rick Longoria (formerly of J. Carey) has turned out some 
lovely Chardonnays, Cabernet Sauvignons and late-harvest Reislings. Most of the 
wines are sold out of an attractive Spanish-style winery building, or by mail 
(P.O. Box 910, Santa Ynez, Calif. 93460). 
</P>
<P>
The Foxen story is one of pure dedication. At this point, little of the wine is 
available, though the wine shops of Santa Barbara and a few in Los Angeles are 
beginning to carry the Foxen wines. 
</P>
<P>
Wathan was a fruit science major at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo who taught 
viticulture as a graduate student. Dore was a banker who finally decided it was 
more fun to make wine. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was cash. Neither had a great deal of money to buy a winery or 
vineyards, and they had heard that you needed $500,000 to start a small winery. 
</P>
<P>
"But we also knew we could do a lot of the work ourselves," said Dore, a tall, 
energetic fellow who is tanned from the outdoor work he must do. 
</P>
<P>
Starting with a home wine-making project, they began building toward their 
dream of a commercial winery. They have dug holes for fencing posts and 
stretched chain link to keep the deer away from the grapes. They have planted 
vines and tended them. They have built an irrigation system 800 feet up from 
the valley floor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Start From Scratch 
</P>
<P>
They have built a winery out of a falling-down shed. They have insulated and 
hauled barrels. They have weeded and moved rocks and paved and trimmed trees, 
cut swaths in the earth for their vehicles, and they have picked grapes and 
crushed them and have fermented them. 
</P>
<P>
And now they are selling a 1987 Pinot Noir (70 cases) and 1988 Chardonnay (420 
cases) that are stylish and complex little wines, evidence that these guys are 
on the right track. The Chardonnay ($18) is a deeply complex wine that will 
appeal to those who like a more full-bodied style. I like it, and I can see 
where the house style is headed. 
</P>
<P>
The Chardonnay is sure to find a lot of fans. 
</P>
<P>
The Foxen winery itself is small, but it is located on the 2,000-acre ranch of 
the Wickenden family, of which Dore is a member. He is the great-great-grandson 
of founder Benjamin Foxen, a sea captain who in 1838 won a Mexican land grant 
to this place. 
</P>
<P>
Foxen, incidentally, is a name lost in history, but a historic marker down the 
road from the winery notes that Foxen (nicknamed the Pioneer) was the man who, 
in 1846, warned Lt. Col. John C. Fremont (the Pathfinder) of an impending 
Mexican ambush down the road at Gaviota Pass. 
</P>
<P>
Foxen safely led Fremont and his men over San Marcos Pass, avoiding the ambush, 
and they captured Santa Barbara without bloodshed. Three weeks later, on Jan. 
13, 1847, California was ceded to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
There was no wine to speak of in the Foxen family. A bit of wine was made from 
the old Mission grape for the family's use, but Wathan and Dore named their 
winery after the man, not any wine heritage. 
</P>
<P>
To date, Wathan and Dore each have spent $50,000 out of pocket to acquire the 
expensive French oak barrels in which the wine is aged, and to pay for building 
materials, chemicals to do lab analysis, and mundane things like hoses and 
fermenting tanks. 
</P>
<P>
They have 10 acres of vines growing on a hill south of the Santa Maria Valley. 
</P>
<P>
To raise funds before the wine is released, they sell barrels to the public for 
their cost (about $400). After two years, the investor in the barrel gets his 
initial investment back plus a case of the wine that was aged in the barrel. 
Investors are also invited to a barrel-signing dinner party and a dinner when 
the wine is released. 
</P>
<P>
This is the Santa Barbara experience. It's still possible to work toward a 
dream in Santa Barbara.

LUCILLE BALL DIES; TV'S COMIC GENIUS WAS 77; 
</P>
<P>
DEATH CAUSED BY RUPTURED ABDOMINAL AORTA AS SHE APPEARED TO BE RECOVERING FROM 
SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Lucille Ball, the leggy showgirl, model and B-grade movie queen whose pumpkin 
hair and genius for comedy made her an icon of television, died early 
Wednesday, a week after undergoing emergency heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The co-creator and star of "I Love Lucy," a product of TV's Golden Age that 
continues via syndication to be viewed by millions around the world, was 77 and 
died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center of a ruptured abdominal aorta. 
</P>
<P>
Known simply as "Lucy" to four decades of smitten television fans, she had 
undergone surgery at Cedars-Sinai on April 18 to replace part of her aorta and 
aortic valve and had recovered from the 6 1/2-hour operation to a point where 
she was eating and even walking around her hospital room. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital spokesman Ronald Wise said the rupture occurred in a portion of the 
aorta, the main heart artery, far from where the operation was performed. 
</P>
<P>
She suffered a complete heart failure at 5 a.m., and 47 minutes of 
resuscitation efforts proved fruitless, Wise said. "There was nothing to 
indicate this would happen," Wise said. "The heart itself apparently was not 
involved in Miss Ball's sudden death." 
</P>
<P>
Since last week's surgery, fans had flooded the hospital with thousands of 
get-well cards, sent via telegram and even facsimile machine. Hospital 
officials said it was the largest outpouring they had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Ball was a tough-talking woman who had used her stardom and show business 
savvy to become, with her then-husband, the late Desi Arnaz, head of one of 
Hollywood's major studios, Desilu. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her business acumen, she remained the unquestioned queen of television 
comedy. From her star-struck childhood through her struggles as a wisecracking 
movie actress in the 1930s and '40s to the television career that made her a 
legend, Miss Ball's life was in the best show business tradition of rags to 
riches. 
</P>
<P>
Almost humbly, she liked to say she owed her enormous success, not so much to 
talent, but to a magical combination of guts and good supporting players. Her 
greatest achievements, she always would add, were not any milestones in her 
career but ranked somewhere under the birth of her two children, Lucie in 1951 
and Desi Jr., two years later. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not funny," Ball told an interviewer for Rolling Stone magazine in 1983. 
"My writers were funny. My directors were funny. The situations were funny. . . 
. What I am is brave. I have never been scared. Not when I did movies, 
certainly not when I was a model and not when I did "I Love Lucy." 
</P>
<P>
It was "I Love Lucy," which premiered on CBS on Oct. 15, 1951, that earned Miss 
Ball her niche in television history. The 30-minute comedy starred Miss Ball 
and the Cuban-born Arnaz as the wacky Lucy Ricardo and her conga-playing 
husband Ricky. The show was a weekly dash into absurdity that boasted the 
biggest television audience of its time -- of almost any time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stopped the Nation 
</P>
<P>
In creating the show, Miss Ball and Arnaz -- who died in 1986 -- set a pattern 
of television that was to be repeated in decades to come. They filmed the 
programs in front of a live audience and in doing so, invented the popular and 
financially rewarding rerun. 
</P>
<P>
The show was so popular during the 1950s that it literally stopped the nation 
every Monday night from 9 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. In fact, nighttime shoppers became 
so scarce in Chicago that the mammoth Marshall Field department store posted a 
sign that read: "We Love Lucy, too, so from now on we will be open Thursday 
night instead of Monday." When presidential candidate Adlai E. Stevenson 
interrupted the show once for a political message, he was flooded with angry 
mail. 
</P>
<P>
Even a charge that Miss Ball was a Communist, made by the House Un-American 
Activities Committee in 1952, failed to dent her popularity. The charges, based 
on her registering to vote as a Communist in 1936, were dropped when Miss Ball 
explained she had done so only to please her ailing grandfather. Millions of 
sympathetic fans and a pragmatic CBS understood. 
</P>
<P>
A phenomenal 40 million viewers watched the antics each week as Lucy would 
always try to outwit Ricky. With their best friends and landlords, Fred and 
Ethel Mertz, played by veterans William Frawley and Vivian Vance as the perfect 
foils, the Ricardos found themselves mired in situations that frequently were 
rowdy and always ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
A generation of Americans grew to recap their favorite Lucy episodes, plot 
twist by crazy twist. 
</P>
<P>
There was the time Lucy schemed her way onto Ricky's television show to do a 
commercial for a vegetable drink with a high alcoholic content and got 
hilariously tipsy during the many retakes. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the time she threw in two packages of yeast while baking 
homemade bread and ended up pinned against the wall of her Manhattan kitchen by 
a monster loaf. 
</P>
<P>
And there was the time Lucy and Ethel, trying to impress their New York friends 
with the ultimate souvenir from a trip to Hollywood, pried loose the cement 
block containing John Wayne's footprints from in front of Grauman's Chinese 
Theater. Of course, the block broke. 
</P>
<P>
Week after week, Lucy would find herself trapped in a vat of laundry starch, 
locked in a meat freezer, or lost on a subway with a loving cup stuck on her 
head. Her turmoils permanently positioned her in the hearts of most Americans, 
including the critics. 
</P>
<P>
"An extraordinary discipline and intuitive understanding of farce give 'I Love 
Lucy' an engaging lilt," wrote New York Times critic Jack Gould. In its Lucy 
cover story, Time magazine said: "This is the sort of cheerful rowdiness that 
has been rare. . . . Lucille submits enthusiastically to being hit with pies; 
falls over furniture. . . . Tricked out as a ballerina or a Hindu maharani or a 
toothless hillbilly, she takes her assorted lumps and pratfalls with unflagging 
zest and good humor." 
</P>
<P>
In a 1981 interview in The Times, even Miss Ball admitted, "I love Lucy." 
</P>
<P>
"There were two key qualities to her," the comedienne said. "She was always in 
financial trouble -- if she wanted a fur collar, a ratty little fur collar, she 
had to figure out a way to make some extra money to get it. . . . God, that's 
universal. And she always had a domineering figure over her. . . . Lucy was 
forever knocking somebody's top hat off." 
</P>
<P>
Miss Ball's personal favorite episodes were filmed when she was pregnant with 
Desi Jr. An amazing 44 million viewers, 90% of the television audience, 
gleefully watched on Jan. 19, 1953, when she gave birth on film to the show's 
little Ricky. To the unabashed delight of a nation, it was the same night she 
had given birth in real life. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so damned happy -- just floating on a cloud -- and I think the way I 
felt came across on the film," she said. "I loved doing all those pregnant 
shows." 
</P>
<P>
Astoundingly, or so it seems in retrospect, early reviews of Miss Ball's 
talents gave little hint of what was to come. In fact, when she was a plucky 
15-year-old looking for that first break on Broadway, Miss Ball was told by a 
drama teacher to give up. Luckily, the turquoise-eyed teen-ager ignored the 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
Born to an electrician father and pianist mother on Aug. 6, 1911, in a suburb 
of Jamestown, N.Y., Miss Ball had set her sights on stardom almost from the 
first. By 5, the brown-haired little girl was taking music lessons. Each spring 
that followed she would head toward New York City, walking until someone found 
her and returned her to her home. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving school at 15, Miss Ball finally made it to New York and the John Murray 
Anderson dramatic school. There was a brief stint in a Ziegfeld Follies road 
show and some short-lived appearances in a handful of Broadway chorus lines. 
</P>
<P>
Changing her name to Diane Belmont ("I always loved the name Diane and I was 
driving past the Belmont race track, and the names seemed to fit together") she 
turned to modeling. At various times a dress model and a hat model, Miss Ball, 
with long legs peeking out the bottom of a oversized cigarette pack, ultimately 
became a "Chesterfield girl." America grew to know her on billboards, magazine 
ads and on posters in its drugstore windows. 
</P>
<P>
Then in 1933, she headed to Hollywood. Her curly hair bleached a Jean Harlow 
platinum, Miss Ball was hired to work for six weeks in the chorus of Samuel 
Goldwyn's "Roman Scandals." Bit part after bit part stretched her stay to six 
months and she became a Hollywood fixture, taking second billing in the years 
that followed to everyone from The Three Stooges and Buster Keaton to Katharine 
Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. Along the way, she dyed her hair a fiery red and was 
given the unofficial title of "Queen of the Bs." 
</P>
<P>
Reviewers noted her "pert presence" and talent for "rubber-faced slapstick 
clowning." She was described in one newspaper as a "slangy, breezy wisecracking 
gal with a bebop rhythm to her walk." Said another, "Pretty Lucille Ball . . . 
was born for the parts Ginger Rogers sweats over." 
</P>
<P>
Playing the ingenue lead in the 1940 musical "Too Many Girls," Miss Ball met 
rumba singer Arnaz, cast as a Cuban football player. She later told an 
interviewer, "It was, at least for me, true love from the start." 
</P>
<P>
Exchanging vows seven months later, the pair began what was for the most part a 
troubled marriage. All but three of their first 11 years of marriage were spent 
apart. With Arnaz traveling the country with his band and Miss Ball committed 
to Hollywood sound stages, the pair spent almost $30,000 on telegrams and 
long-distance telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
"We would end up talking on the phone -- no, fighting on the phone," Miss Ball 
told interviewers. "You can't have a marriage over the phone. You can't have 
children over the phone. It became obvious that something had to be done." 
</P>
<P>
What was done to salvage the marriage was "I Love Lucy." 
</P>
<P>
Since CBS was stubbornly opposed to the idea of the heavily accented Arnaz 
playing the husband, the determined Arnazes created their own Desilu company 
and took a stage version of their show on the road to gauge public opinion. It 
was a smash, and television executives reluctantly gave "I Love Lucy" a time 
slot. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted our characters to have problems," Miss Ball said of her concept for 
the show. "I wanted to be an average housewife. A very nosy but very average 
housewife. And I wanted my husband to love me. 
</P>
<P>
"CBS thought we were out of our minds to want to do it on film." 
</P>
<P>
The episodes were filmed before a live audience by Academy Award-winning 
cinematographer Karl Freund, famous for his work on such films as "The Good 
Earth" and Garbo's "Camille." When the Arnazes negotiated to keep the films "to 
show our kids someday," few in the industry predicted what would happen. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember (someone) saying, 'These films may be worth something someday,' " 
Miss Ball told The Times. "You should hang onto them. If Desi had that in mind, 
I never knew it. Maybe he knew he was creating the rerun but he never told me 
about it. All I knew was I was 40 years old and was having my first baby and I 
didn't want to do these shows and let them disappear into the air. I felt we 
could save the films for home movies. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, in the years since the original 153 "I Love Lucy" episodes were 
telecast, they have been shown and reshown in virtually every country around 
the globe, earning an estimated $50 million to $100 million. Miss Ball's face 
was one of the most recognized on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
But all of it was not enough to save her troubled marriage. To the horror of 
their television fans, Miss Ball and Arnaz were divorced in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Arnaz) was like Jekyll and Hyde," she said years later. "He drank and he 
gambled and he went around with other women. It was always the same: booze and 
broads." 
</P>
<P>
Breaking with the past, Miss Ball left Hollywood for New York and a starring 
role in the musical "Wildcat." The 1960 production floundered after only a few 
performances but during her stay in the East, she met stand-up comedian Gary 
Morton. They married in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arnaz and Miss Ball had sold their "I Love Lucy" films to CBS for $6 
million and she bought her ex-husband's interest in Desilu, becoming in effect, 
the first woman to head a major studio. It was by then home to 18 shows, 
including such hits as "The Untouchables" and "The Ann Sothern Show." Friend 
Bob Hope called her business sense "startling." 
</P>
<P>
"I never wanted to be an executive, but when my marriage to Desi broke up after 
19 years, I couldn't just walk away from my obligations and say 'forget it,' " 
Miss Ball explained. "We were an institution. Life takes guts. If you don't 
take chances, you'll never bathe again because you might get dirty again." 
</P>
<P>
Husband Morton said Miss Ball was blessed with an "innate business sense." 
</P>
<P>
"When she was running Desilu," he said, "she made decisions affecting the 
future of the company that often amazed board members, not because they were 
coming from a woman but because time usually proved her judgment to be 
correct." 
</P>
<P>
Among the shows Miss Ball tutored to success was her own "The Lucy Show," a 
series without Arnaz but with the same madcap clowning that kept her fans 
delighted. Among the guest stars attracted by the madness were Elizabeth Taylor 
and Richard Burton, the most glittering couple of the day. 
</P>
<P>
In 1967, with Desilu churning out a gold mine of televisions hits, "Star Trek" 
and "Mission: Impossible" among them, an exhausted Miss Ball decided that she 
had had enough. Gulf &amp; Western Industries bought the property for a 
reported $17 million. 
</P>
<P>
In place of Desilu, Miss Ball, along with Morton, launched the much smaller 
Lucille Ball Productions Inc. and in 1968, began filming "Here's Lucy," a 
series featuring Desi Jr. and Lucie. 
</P>
<P>
"My life started when my children were born," Miss Ball said at the time. "I 
couldn't wait to work with them. . . . Even when they moved out of the house, 
they were still home at the studio. I liked that." 
</P>
<P>
The series aired through 1974. With her children's careers off the launching 
pad, the comedienne, then 63, decided it was time to retire her legendary 
character. "The Lucy character is too old to run around like an idiot," she 
said in explanation. 
</P>
<P>
That same year, she filmed her final motion picture, "Mame," a version of the 
Broadway musical. Although by now the world's best-known television star, as a 
movie star Miss Ball again received mixed reviews. Times critic Charles 
Champlin wrote, "The shame about 'Mame' is that it managed to deny us a Lucy to 
love." 
</P>
<P>
With those final starring credits to her name, she settled into co-producing 
shows, making occasional television appearances and accepting one after another 
of a continual barrage of awards and tributes. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to her 13 Emmy nominations (she won four), Miss Ball was feted in 
1976 with a nostalgic television tribute saluting the 25th anniversary of "I 
Love Lucy." Danny Kaye was among those who gave testimonials during the two 
hours of reminiscing. "Calling Lucille Ball just a comedienne is like calling 
Margot Fonteyn just a dancer," Kaye said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, when she was named one of seven initial inductees in the Television 
Hall of Fame, she credited the many "talented and creative people" around her 
for making her a legend. "I have been absolutely blessed," Miss Ball said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Role as Bag Lady 
</P>
<P>
The following year she took on one of the most challenging roles of her career: 
a bag lady in the television movie "Stone Pillow." She was hospitalized for 
dehydration when it was over, but it was a critical and ratings success. 
</P>
<P>
Her last flirtation with television came with her ill-fated and short-lived 
1986 series, "Life With Lucy," in which she again teamed with longtime sidekick 
Gale Gordon. It was quickly pulled by the network because of abysmal ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Her final public appearance proved to be during the 61st annual Academy Awards 
ceremony on March 29 when she joined her old friend Hope as a presenter. 
</P>
<P>
She had signed a contract with Putnam to publish her autobiography but died 
before she could begin work on it. 
</P>
<P>
Tearfully sentimental when it came to her husband and family, she reveled in 
life as a grandmother and glowed whenever she talked of her children. Their 
struggles and early failed marriages seemed not to matter. While she always 
spoke fondly of Arnaz, Miss Ball claimed that she had found the perfect mate in 
Morton. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Morton) takes care of me like I was his mother," she told an interviewer 
in 1981. "Gary gives me protection." On a scale of 1 to 10, Miss Ball said, "I 
rate my marriage to Gary a 12." 
</P>
<P>
But to her countless television fans -- from the postwar babies who adored her 
during the '50s to their children and children's children who roared at her 
antics through decades of reruns -- it was always Lucy and Ricky. More than a 
quarter-century of marriage to Morton could not erase that. There was always 
the hilarious image of the redhead and "that Cuban bongo player," as Miss Ball 
affectionately called him. 
</P>
<P>
Even years after the Lucy shows ended, the comedienne openly admitted to 
missing the characterization. 
</P>
<P>
"After Lucy ended, I thought, 'I'll live a few more years and then I'll die," 
she said in 1983. "I didn't plan on living this long. . . . Now I miss her. . . 
."

Rudolfo and Tamara Linares visited their comatose son in the hospital for the 
last time Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
After spending a few minutes with the infant, Tamara left the room. That is 
when, police say, Rudolfo drew a .357-caliber handgun, which he pointed at the 
lone nurse in the room. He then disconnected the respirator that had kept 
15-month-old Samuel alive for the past eight months. 
</P>
<P>
Weeping, Rudolfo Linares cradled the baby in his arms for 40 minutes until the 
boy died. 
</P>
<P>
Linares, a 23-year-old painter who lives in the suburb of Cicero, was charged 
with first-degree murder in the incident, which happened at Rush 
Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in the early hours of Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
At a Wednesday evening court hearing, Linares was released on a $75,000 
recognizance bond, which means that he does not have to post any bond money 
unless he fails to appear at future hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant State's Atty. James Piper, in arguing that Linares be held in jail, 
told Judge Marvin Ruttenberg that the weapon was cocked and that Linares had 
threatened to "kill anybody who interfered." 
</P>
<P>
Ruttenberg told Linares to appear in court again today. 
</P>
<P>
Tamara Linares was not charged in the death. "She was never really considered a 
suspect," said Lisa Howard, a spokeswoman for the Cook County state's 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best thing," Tamara Linares told radio station WBBM-AM on 
Wednesday. "My baby is out of his misery. He's in heaven now." 
</P>
<P>
The child had been hospitalized since Aug. 2, when he swallowed a balloon and 
it blocked his trachea. The obstruction caused a lack of oxygen to his brain. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, he's been comatose" and surviving only on a respirator since then, 
a Police Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Linareses were told Tuesday that Samuel would be moved to a long-term care 
unit, said Carolyn Reed, the hospital's director of public relations. "His 
condition has been stable for some time. He hasn't been critical in the sense 
that his signs have been going up or down . . . . They expected this child to 
die at any time." 
</P>
<P>
Except for pointing the gun at the nurse, authorities said, Linares never 
seemed a threat to anyone during the incident. 
</P>
<P>
The nurse called security, which in turn called the Chicago police. Linares 
kept nurses, doctors and the police at bay by pointing the gun at the baby. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not here to hurt anyone. I'll only hurt you if you try to plug my baby 
back in," police Sgt. William Rooney quoted Linares as saying. 
</P>
<P>
After a time, police say, Linares felt for a heartbeat. When he found none, he 
asked a doctor for a stethoscope. A doctor slid the stethoscope across the 
floor to him. When he determined that the baby was dead, Linares "broke down 
crying, turned the weapon over to the police and surrendered," said a Police 
Department spokesman, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Reed said Linares first tried to disconnect Samuel's life-support system last 
December or January. 
</P>
<P>
"He disconnected it," Reed said. "People were able to subdue him. The child was 
examined. There was no change. We did our own investigation and it was 
determined that the child was OK." 
</P>
<P>
After that incident, the pediatric intensive-care unit considered restricting 
Linares' access to his son but decided to simply have a nurse present when he 
visited. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney said Linares has two other children, both under 5. 
</P>
<P>
The Linareses live on a narrow street of modest bungalows in the heart of 
Cicero, a working-class Chicago suburb. Luciano Reyes, their landlord, who 
lives in the apartment below them, said he was stunned by the news. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'He Seemed Cheerful' 
</P>
<P>
"He was a very quiet, respectful guy," said Berniece Kielb, who lived two doors 
from the Linareses. "He said good morning. He seemed cheerful, smiling. He 
wasn't depressed and walking like he had the world on his shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
She said he spent all of Tuesday afternoon working on his car. The two had 
joked together. "I think what he did was an act of kindness and compassion," 
Kielb said. "I feel like he loved that boy . . . . He must've been in such a 
state that he said: 'This is enough.' " 
</P>
<P>
The neighbors all knew about the accident that had befallen little Samuel. 
Occasionally, they would ask Linares or his wife for the latest news. 
</P>
<P>
"He never wanted to actually talk about it," said Frank Glab, another neighbor. 
"He'd say: 'They say he's getting better, but I don't know.' I knew his heart 
was bleeding because he couldn't bring him home." 
</P>
<P>
Reyes said he did not know much about the family. Tamara Linares told him that 
her husband was originally from Texas but had lived many years in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Kielb said she believed that it was wrong for Linares to be charged with 
murder. "I feel he's given himself his own conviction," she said. "He's got to 
live with this for the rest of his life."

JUDGE ORDERS SEIZED ASSAULT GUNS RELEASED 
</P>

<P>
In a major blow to the Bush Administration's ban on foreign-made assault guns, 
a federal judge Wednesday ordered the Customs Service to release more than 
1,000 semiautomatic rifles seized at an Alabama airport, ruling that the 
government had no right to bar entry to weapons purchased under valid import 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
The Alabama judge's decision overturned the seizure of weapons at one site as 
part of a nationwide government effort to intercept shipments of any of the 
640,000 assault rifles that already had been approved for import but had not 
yet entered the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Impact of Ruling Uncertain 
</P>
<P>
So far at least 4,000 weapons have been blocked at import points. It was 
uncertain what effect Wednesday's ruling will have on the 3,000 or more assault 
weapons seized elsewhere. U.S. officials declined comment on the case until 
they can review the judge's order. 
</P>
<P>
The setback for the government came in the first legal challenge to the 
sweeping Administration ban. 
</P>
<P>
In a sworn declaration in the case, Stephen Higgins, director of the Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, had warned that "although the number of weapons 
involved in this (Alabama) case might appear to be insignificant, the overall 
issue involves the importation of over three-quarters of a million firearms." 
</P>
<P>
A ruling against the government, he declared, would "undermine" the 
government's review of its policy on possession and sale of assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The Alabama ruling has no direct effect on another element of the government's 
crackdown -- a moratorium on issuing additional permits for importing 29 types 
of assault rifles until the Administration decides whether they are used for 
legitimate sporting purposes. 
</P>
<P>
But the strongly worded decision by U.S. District Judge William M. Acker Jr. in 
Birmingham criticized even that provision of the ban, contending that it 
interferes with the right of Congress to enact laws. 
</P>
<P>
Because the weapons previously had been deemed suitable for importation, the 
judge argued, the Administration cannot now refuse to grant new permits for 
them unless Congress amends the nation's gun control laws. 
</P>
<P>
The order was issued in response to a lawsuit by Gun South Inc., a Trussville, 
Ala., weapons importer. 
</P>
<P>
The company sought to win the release of 1,100 Austrian-made Steyr-Aug rifles 
held up late last month at Birmingham airport by Customs Service agents acting 
under orders from the Treasury Department. 
</P>
<P>
Gun South had received permission to import the weapons earlier this year. 
While the Steyr-Aug rifles were among the five types of assault guns named in 
the March 14 moratorium on new imports, the company was told by federal 
officials that the action would have no effect on weapons for which permits had 
already been granted. 
</P>
<P>
Gun South already had ordered some 1,100 guns from its Austrian-made 
manufacturer and was awaiting their delivery. By the time the weapons arrived 
in Alabama later in the month, however, the government had notified the company 
of its decision to widen the ban by suspending the permits. On that basis, it 
ordered the Customs Service to bar the shipment from entering the country. 
</P>
<P>
The Alabama judge issued an injunction barring the government from interfering 
with "routine delivery" of the 1,100 weapons, which have been stored in a 
Birmingham warehouse. In a 28-page decision, he contended that the government 
had no right to interdict weapons "purchased under permits validly issued and 
valid when acted upon." 
</P>
<P>
The decision apparently will permit Gun South to import another 3,500 
Steyr-Augs that it ordered in mid-March before being informed of the 
government's decision to widen the ban by suspending further imports. 
</P>
<P>
The judge declined to rule on the broader question of whether the government 
had the right to suspend the permits at all. He indicated that weapons ordered 
by Gun South after it had learned of the government's decision would not be 
affected by his ruling. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling has no direct effect on the government's seizure of at least 3,000 
other assault guns that the Customs Service has barred from entering the United 
States under the temporary moratorium. But the weapons, which arrived in U.S. 
ports around the country early this month, probably would be permitted to enter 
the domestic market if other courts follow the precedent set by the Alabama 
judge.

STUDENTS DEFY CHINESE DECREE AGAINST PROTESTS 
</P>

<P>
Thousands of pro-democracy student demonstrators confronted police on the 
streets of Beijing this morning, defying a government edict that protests would 
no longer be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after noon, an orderly procession of about 15,000 students had gotten 
past three sets of police lines and was marching toward downtown Tian An Men 
Square. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the first students began marching, a line of several hundred 
policemen blocked their path, but after a nonviolent 10-minute face-off -- 
during which bystanders shouted for police to let the students pass -- the line 
yielded and the students marched on. 
</P>
<P>
In the next two hours, the procession broke through police lines in two more 
places. 
</P>
<P>
The students sang the Chinese national anthem and chanted "Long live 
democracy!" In what appeared to be a move both of political self-defense and a 
gesture of conciliation, they also carried banners expressing support for the 
Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have accused the students of seeking to overthrow the Communist 
Party, a serious crime under Chinese law. 
</P>
<P>
The students were cheered and applauded by onlookers, who emptied out of shops 
as they passed. Many bystanders called on the police not to beat the students. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of additional police were waiting for the students along the 
seven-mile route to the square, and further confrontation appeared likely. It 
was not immediately clear whether students from other campuses had already 
joined the column or whether they might join it on its way to the square. 
</P>
<P>
Plans to crush the protest were announced by Beijing Municipal Communist Party 
Secretary Li Ximing at a mass meeting Wednesday of Communist Party officials. 
</P>
<P>
Li said that authorities were aware of plans for "a large-scale demonstration" 
today and would not permit it. 
</P>
<P>
"We will deal with it in accordance with the stipulation that no demonstration 
is allowed without prior approval," Li said, according to the official New 
China News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Today's demonstration was organized by a new student-run association linking 
about 40 colleges and universities in Beijing, according to both Li and student 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
Some students said they were prepared to die. It is widely rumored that 
authorities have moved 10,000 to 20,000 soldiers into Beijing to deal with the 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Trucks carrying police or soldiers armed with bayonet-tipped rifles were seen 
entering the city around midnight. But it was not clear whether authorities 
intended to permit security forces to use firearms. 
</P>
<P>
The crackdown on the escalating student protests began shortly after midnight, 
when about 100 police officers temporarily sealed off Tian An Men Square and 
removed dozens of wreaths honoring the late reformist Communist Party leader, 
Hu Yaobang. Student protesters had placed the wreaths at the base of the 
Monument to the People's Heroes in the middle of the square during 
demonstrations last week. 
</P>
<P>
Late this morning, thousands of police, some equipped with helmets shields and 
sticks, again sealed off the square. 
</P>
<P>
The current wave of protests began as mourning for Hu, who died of a heart 
attack April 15. But the protests soon developed into a broad drive to pressure 
the government to accelerate the pace of political reform. At least 30,000 
students marched to Tian An Men Square before dawn Saturday. They were joined 
there by 30,000 or more supporters in a demonstration that continued past noon. 
At times, onlookers swelled the crowd to about 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Specific demands being pressed by the students include freedom of the press, 
improved treatment of intellectuals and public revelation of the income and 
wealth of high officials. 
</P>
<P>
Li made his announcement of the impending crackdown at a meeting in the Great 
Hall of the People attended by the heads of Beijing's 10,000 Communist Party 
branches. Li said that 60,000 out of a total of 160,000 students at 40 colleges 
and universities in the capital were boycotting classes Wednesday. Student 
leaders estimated that 70,000 students were taking part in the strike. 
</P>
<P>
Li said that by putting up big-character posters, organizing unauthorized 
student unions and carrying out strikes, the students were "stirring up 
turmoil," the official news agency reported. It quoted him as saying: "We must 
firmly stop such riots." 
</P>
<P>
The official People's Daily warned in a commentary published Wednesday that the 
Communist Party and the entire nation face "a grave political struggle" against 
the challenge posed by the student demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
Li was quoted as saying that Communist Party cadres must stop their children 
from attending protest activities and as calling on Beijing residents to "stick 
to their posts, maintain production and guarantee the supply of daily 
necessities." 
</P>
<P>
Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong, who also spoke at the meeting at the Great Hall of 
the People, made what could be interpreted as a conciliatory gesture toward the 
students. 
</P>
<P>
"I welcome the students' demand to publish details of the property belonging to 
senior leaders," Chen said, according to the news agency. "Li Ximing and I can 
take the lead in this respect." 
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng, the official most frequently targeted by protesters for 
criticism, publicly endorsed a tough stand against the students in comments 
made at a meeting with a visiting official from Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
"No country, no matter what kind of social system it has, can possibly survive, 
not to say develop, without a normal social order," Li said, according to the 
New China News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Li was also quoted as saying that the political situation in China is stable 
and that China will not change its policy of reform and opening to the outside 
world. 
</P>
<P>
China's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, gave his approval for the crackdown on 
Tuesday, according to a Chinese journalist who talked with the Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
"The peasants support us, the workers support us, the army supports us, so why 
should we be bothered by the students?" Deng said, according to the journalist.

BONE DISCOVERY MAY SHOW THAT NEANDERTHAL MAN COULD TALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE C. ROARK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The discovery of a 60,000-year-old, two-inch neck bone in a cave in Israel, 
reported in today's issue of the British journal Nature, suggests that modern 
man's brutish predecessor, the Neanderthal, may have had the physical capacity 
to speak. 
</P>
<P>
The conclusion -- drawn by a group of Israeli, French and American 
archeologists -- has provoked sharp reactions from other scientists and has 
rekindled a long-simmering controversy over the origin and evolution of human 
language. 
</P>
<P>
But Baruch Arensburg and his colleagues in Israel contend that the tiny 
U-shaped fossil, which was discovered in the Kebara Cave at Mt. Carmel, closely 
resembles its counterpart, known as the hyoid bone, in modern humans. What that 
means, they say, is that voice-production machinery has changed little over the 
past 60,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Speech Capability 
</P>
<P>
"We conclude," they wrote in the Nature article, "that the morphological basis 
for human speech capability appears to have been fully developed during the 
Middle Paleolithic" -- the period known as the Stone Age, from about 2.5 
million to 9,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The ability to talk -- to make commands, to articulate arguments, to give voice 
to emotions -- is surely one of the most complex and remarkable of human 
achievements. Speech has long been thought to be the characteristic that 
separates modern humans from their ape-like ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
For some years now, many anatomists, anthropologists, linguists and others 
working in Europe and the United States have concluded that the physical 
elements necessary for complex spoken language -- the voice box, the tongue and 
associated muscles -- must have evolved to today's level of sophistication 
about 300,000 to 400,000 years ago. Researchers have based their conclusions on 
massive reconstructions of the head and neck bones of early human and pre-human 
fossils and computerized models of the soft tissues that probably surrounded 
these bones. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have wasted no time in voicing their skepticism about the new study. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy is way off base," said Dr. Edmund S. Crelin, a distinguished 
professor of anatomy at Yale University School of Medicine. "What he's done is 
basically attach a whole theory of evolution to a little bone." 
</P>
<P>
"The problem," said Dr. Jeffrey T. Laitman, associate professor of anatomy at 
the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in New York, "is that this is the first and 
only bone of its kind that we have found" in the fossilized remains of 
prehistoric man. "For all we know, all hyoid bones may look alike all the way 
back to the beginning of time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mammals Have Bone 
</P>
<P>
According to Philip Lieberman, professor of cognitive and linguistic sciences 
at Brown University, most mammals have a hyoid bone that looks much like the 
human equivalent and yet it is clear that most mammals cannot speak as humans 
do. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were to accept the reasoning of these archeologists, we could prove that 
pigs talk. Which may explain the Old Testament injunction against eating pig. 
In a happier, earlier time in Israel perhaps pigs did talk," Lieberman quipped. 
</P>
<P>
The debate, the scientists agree, is not over whether Neanderthals or other 
predecessors of modern man could make sounds or even whether they could 
communicate by means of their voices -- indeed most animals can and do. The 
issue is whether they were able to articulate the vast range of modern human 
sounds that make complex human speech possible. 
</P>
<P>
"The first human vocal tracts appear in fossils 300,000 years ago," Crelin 
said. "The evidence is very clear . . . in the shape of the skulls, the length 
of the mandibles (or lower jaws). Before that, they (the vocal tracts) look 
like those of an ape or a baby." 
</P>
<P>
One of the interesting aspects of the human vocal tract is that it changes over 
time. At birth, a human baby's vocal tract is shaped and positioned much like 
that of a dog or a cat, which means it can make only a limited number of sounds 
and has the ability to breath and swallow at the same time. At about one year 
of age, the larynx descends and human speech as we know it begins to form. 
</P>
<P>
But adult humans pay a big price for the ability to speak. Because they cannot 
breath and swallow at the same time, they can choke to death fairly easily and 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
The elaborate reconstructions and computer models of human head and neck and 
mouth structures provide "persuasive evidence" of a rather dramatic evolution 
in the structure of the vocal tract, Laitman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Baruch and his colleagues haven't proven anything; they've only made 
assertions," Laitman added. "In science, you can't just say it; you have to 
show it. This isn't the 19th Century, which is the kind of science they are 
practicing." 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview from his office at Yale, Crelin was even less 
complimentary of Baruch. "This guy's an idiot," said Crelin, who acknowledged 
being particularly irritated by a less than flattering review that Baruch had 
written earlier of a book Crelin wrote in 1987 explaining the evolution of the 
human vocal tract. In the review in the "American Scientist," Baruch called 
Crelin's theories "unexplained," his conclusions "bizarre" and described the 
book as having "anatomical errors." 
</P>
<P>
"He says he found anatomical mistakes in my book!" Crelin exclaimed. "My God, 
for 35 years I've been the expert on anatomy here." 
</P>
<P>
The ferocity with which these scientists were attacking each other this week is 
not uncommon in the field of vocal evolution, according to those who are in the 
middle of the dispute. One of the reasons seems to be that the controversy over 
human speech is part of a larger debate on whether Neanderthals were direct 
ancestors of modern humans, rather than an evolutionary dead-end. 
</P>
<P>
Behind that controversy is an even larger debate over exactly where and how 
prehistoric ape-like mammals made their fateful transition to modern human 
beings. 
</P>
<P>
On one side, there are those -- and the numbers are growing -- who hold that 
modern humans evolved in one place -- probably Africa -- and then migrated 
throughout the world. In this camp, racial differences are attributed to human 
evolutionary responses to regional conditions. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side are those -- among them Baruch and a number of prominent 
scientists -- who believe that modern humans arose virtually simultaneously and 
independently in different places in Africa, Europe and Asia.

NEW LOTTERY GAME PROPOSAL COMES UP WITH ALL LEMONS 
</P>

<P>
A newly devised electronic game designed to boost California's interest in the 
lottery has been shelved after a local district attorney likened it to an 
illegal slot machine and threatened prosecution if it is tested in his 
jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
Joanne McNabb, communications manager for the California State Lottery, said an 
advertising and promotion campaign for the new game, which was to be called 
Pronto, has been canceled and plans to test-market it in the Sacramento area 
have been postponed indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
"We're delaying everything," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento Dist. Atty. Steve White said the commission's decision was prompted 
by a warning from his office that the game in his opinion could constitute the 
use of an illegal slot machine and he would take action to enforce the law 
against such devices. 
</P>
<P>
White said he issued the warning after lottery officials made a slide 
presentation of the new game to his office as they prepared to launch the test. 
</P>
<P>
"To go ahead and have an illegal slot machine would constitute a misdemeanor," 
said White, who until recently was a chief assistant in the state attorney 
general's office. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, David Lind, legal adviser to Sacramento Sheriff Glen Craig, said his 
office reached the same conclusion after they saw the slide demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
"We all viewed the presentation and all of us came to the same conclusion that 
there was some question," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Both attorneys said they believe that the game would be illegal because it 
would have required the use of a computer terminal and would have provided 
instant payoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"The Lottery Commission has been very cooperative and has made it clear they 
don't want to do anything that is legally questionable," White said. 
</P>
<P>
McNabb declined to divulge any specifics about the game other than to confirm 
that there would have been instant payoffs. She said it would have used 
existing terminals in bars, restaurants and elsewhere that are now used for the 
Lotto game. 
</P>
<P>
Pronto would have been the third type of lottery system to be used in 
California. The lottery has already instituted a scratch-off game and the 
computerized Lotto game. 
</P>
<P>
McNabb said Pronto would have been unlike any other lottery game in the nation. 
She said it was devised by the lottery staff as a result of marketing research 
into what players actually want to play. 
</P>
<P>
She said the agency had proceeded with plans for the new game believing that it 
was legal. Although the attorney general's office has yet to respond to a 
request for a formal legal opinion, she said Lottery officials had concluded 
after informal discussions with that office that there would be no legal 
problems with it. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been aware there were some legal considerations but we had no reason 
to believe there was a problem with it," she said. "Just in the last few days 
we have heard from the local officials that they didn't think it would work. 
Until then no one had voiced any problems." 
</P>
<P>
Alan B. Ashby, a spokesman for Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, said his office, 
which received the request for the opinion in late March, is in the process of 
preparing a reply. 
</P>
<P>
It was learned, however, that an internal memorandum written by the attorney 
general's criminal division and circulated March 15 questioned the legality of 
the new game. 
</P>
<P>
McNabb said the costs to the state would be minimal if the lottery is not 
permitted to proceed with the new game. She said several other games are also 
under consideration as a result of the marketing research and they would be 
used in its place. 
</P>
<P>
White, meanwhile, said he would not make a final judgment on the legality of 
the game until he has viewed the attorney general's opinion. Even then, 
however, he said he doubted he would change his decision.

RUPTURE OF AORTA CALLED A RESULT OF EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO CRITICAL VESSEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Reports of Lucille Ball's death came as a shock to many, because she appeared 
to be making a good recovery after undergoing emergency open-heart surgery last 
week to replace part of her damaged aorta and her aortic valve. 
</P>
<P>
But her heart surgeons said Wednesday that the sudden rupture of her weakened 
abdominal aorta was a recognized and largely unpreventable consequence of 
extensive damage to the critical blood vessel, not all of which could be fixed 
with surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The actress bled to death after the rupture of the aorta, the main blood vessel 
carrying blood from the heart to the rest of the body, according to the 
surgeons, Dr. Robert Kass and Dr. Aurelio Chaux. 
</P>
<P>
The aortic blow-out "did not happen because anybody failed to do something," 
Chaux said at a crowded press conference Wednesday evening. "We both were 
shocked and surprised, because of the fact she was doing so well. But this was 
not totally unexpected." 
</P>
<P>
Cardiac surgeons have learned that severely ill patients, such as Miss Ball, 
have a greater chance of surviving after extensive aortic damage if doctors 
concentrate on repairing key parts of the aorta. If the surgeons had tried to 
replace the entire aorta, the operation itself would have been far too risky 
and complicated. 
</P>
<P>
Even with optimal medical care, Miss Ball had "a highly fatal disease," one 
heart surgeon said. "These are big, dangerous operations." 
</P>
<P>
A ruptured abdominal aorta "is not an uncommon mode of death for people with 
this condition," said another surgeon, Dr. Gregory Kay of the Hospital of the 
Good Samaritan in Los Angeles. "There is not a lot you can do about that." 
</P>
<P>
The 77-year-old actress became ill with severe chest pain and other apparent 
heart attack symptoms April 18. Her husband, Gary Morton, rushed her to 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Physicians quickly performed tests, including an electrocardiogram and a 
coronary arteriogram, an X-ray study of the inside of the heart and blood 
vessels. 
</P>
<P>
They diagnosed an "aortic dissection." In this condition, the wall of the aorta 
tears, allowing blood to flow into false passages between the three layers of 
the blood vessel's wall. It is usually caused by a combination of longstanding 
high blood pressure and a weakness in the wall of the aorta, which may be 
related to the fat-like deposits known as atherosclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
Like many aortic dissections, Miss Ball's appeared to have started in the first 
part of the aorta, near the heart, and rapidly extended throughout the aorta -- 
from the chest cavity to the abdomen. "Her whole aorta was dissected from her 
heart into the abdomen, which is 12 to 15 inches at least," Kass said. 
</P>
<P>
During 6 1/2 hours of emergency surgery, Kass and Chaux, who said they have 
performed similar surgery hundreds of times, replaced a five-inch segment of 
the first part of Miss Ball's aorta and the damaged aortic valve. This was to 
prevent virtually certain death from bleeding, from a heart attack or from a 
further tear of the part of the aorta where the dissection began. 
</P>
<P>
The surgeons apparently hoped that further damage to the parts of the aorta 
that could not be repaired could be prevented with medical therapy, such as 
blood pressure medications. The goal was to give the fragile aortic wall time 
to heal. 
</P>
<P>
For about a week, Miss Ball appeared to be progressing as well as could be 
hoped. There were no indications that anything was about to happen. 
</P>
<P>
"She was sitting, eating and even getting to walk a bit," said Cedars-Sinai 
spokesman Ron Wise. Her spirits were "good." 
</P>
<P>
But early Wednesday morning, disaster struck. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Ball, who had been sleeping, complained of back pain and "lost 
consciousness at that moment," Kass said. 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, Miss Ball's heart stopped beating -- apparently because of the 
sudden loss of blood into her abdominal cavity. 
</P>
<P>
"The (heart) monitors and the private duty nurse instantly recognized that 
something catastrophic was happening," Wise said. 
</P>
<P>
Physicians and nurses worked to resuscitate Miss Ball for 47 minutes before 
pronouncing her dead at 5:47 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"She basically had no more blood to pump around," Kass said. "Even if she had 
been in the operating room at the time it occurred, we would not have been able 
to save her." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AORTIC RUPTURE 
</P>
<P>
On April 18, Lucille Ball had an aortic dissection, a condition in which the 
main artery supplying blood from the heart to the rest of the body suddenly 
tears and blood flows into the vessel wall. Surgeons repaired key parts of the 
damage -- the aortic valve and the ascending aorta -- but were unable to fix 
all of it. The actress died after a rupture of the abdominal aorta, part of the 
damaged blood vessel that could not be repaired.

FANS AND FAMOUS -- ALL LOVED LUCY

<P>
Presidents, famous actors, television executives, neighbors and tourists all 
had their memories. Some had known her; most had not. 
</P>
<P>
In form their sentiments ranged from flowers to telegrams to hand-lettered 
signs. Through them all ran a single, constant thread. 
</P>
<P>
They all said they loved Lucy, and they'll miss her. 
</P>
<P>
From former President and Mrs. Ronald Reagan: "Lucille Ball was a gifted 
comedienne who brought laughter to millions the world over. Her red hair, her 
antics on the screen, her timing and her zest for life made her an American 
institution." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's successor extended his "deepest sympathy" to Miss Ball's family and 
called her a "legendary figure." "We too loved Lucy. So did the world," 
President Bush said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Lucille Ball had last appeared in public in March at the Academy Awards 
ceremony. Her co-presenter was Bob Hope, who a few hours after her death said 
simply, "God has her now, but thanks to television, we'll have her forever." 
</P>
<P>
The scene on North Roxbury Drive in Beverly Hills where Miss Ball spent her 
last and what she said were her happiest years was one of curiousity coupled 
with genuine mourning. About 20 people gathered on the sidewalk, some snapping 
photographs of the home and of the dozen television crews standing outside. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Stern, a neighbor, said that the large white house surrounded by 
snapdragons and bougainvillea was the most popular of all the homes on the 
Hollywood Stars' tours: "They (the buses) stop at her house more than any 
other." 
</P>
<P>
Another neighbor, Bob Rosati, said he was watching a rerun of "I Love Lucy" 
when the screen went black and the words "In Memory of Lucille Ball, 1911-1989" 
appeared. "I felt I had lost someone in my family," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Pope, who described herself as an aspiring actress, drove from her Los 
Angeles home with a little container of flowers and a sign that read: "Lucy is 
seen in the smile of everyone's eyes." 
</P>
<P>
She left them with a guard at Miss Ball's home, turned away and said quietly: 
"She's touched all of us. She's not gone. She's just playing to a larger 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the people outside the house were like Karen Mestichelli from 
Philadelphia, a tourist who had purchased a map to the neighborhoods where many 
of the entertainment greats live. "This is the first house we stopped at," she 
said. "I loved her. She was good." 
</P>
<P>
In Paris, entertainer Sammy Davis Jr. called Miss Ball a "great artist -- one 
of the world's greatest clowns." 
</P>
<P>
In Boston, comedian Lily Tomlin said: "It's a sad day for me. She was a great 
role model for me and a great funny woman." 
</P>
<P>
Comedian George Burns, another friend of many years, said, "As long as the 
world goes on, Lucy will be seen." 
</P>
<P>
Burns likened Miss Ball's death to that of his wife, Gracie Allen. "When Gracie 
died, it was a shock to me," he said. "This is a shock. Lucy and Gracie had one 
quality exactly alike. They both dressed like ladies and were very feminine." 
</P>
<P>
Television and film actor Danny DeVito recalled getting a personal 
congratulation from Miss Ball in 1981 when he won an Emmy for his work on the 
TV series "Taxi." 
</P>
<P>
"It made it like it had been blessed," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"To baby boomers, a happy chunk of our childhood is missing," said "Saturday 
Night Live" comedian Victoria Jackson, who was born two years after the "I Love 
Lucy" show went off the air as a regular series. "She didn't make me laugh out 
loud, I remember, she just made me happy about life." 
</P>
<P>
From William S. Paley, chairman of CBS Inc., where "I Loved Lucy" reigned for 
all those years: "Lucille Ball will always be the first lady of CBS. With 'I 
Love Lucy,' she helped establish television as the nation's leading 
entertainment medium. Lucy's extraordinary ability to light up the screen and 
brighten our lives is a legacy that will last forever." 
</P>
<P>
And then there were those at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center where she died. They 
had admired her as a celebrity for years but known her as a person for only 
days. 
</P>
<P>
A bouquet of red roses had been left in front of the center's north tower and 
calls were coming in from all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
"The telephone is ringing off the hook. People crying on the phone," said 
hospital spokeswoman Paula Correia. "It's a massive outpouring of grief from 
all ages." 
</P>
<P>
Maureen LaMour, a hospital admittance representative, said she heard the news 
of Miss Ball's death on her way to work. 
</P>
<P>
"We (the staff) always kept in touch with how she was doing and kept up with 
all the gifts and cards she received, because it was like they were for a 
family member," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone has grown up with her. Our children have grown up with her. She's a 
legend. It's like losing a friend, a family member, instead of a celebrity." 
</P>

DESPITE SCANDAL, JAPAN'S RULING PARTY KEEPS LOCK ON POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bribery scandal has devastated the government of Prime Minister Noboru 
Takeshita, causing one of his most trusted political aides to commit suicide 
Wednesday, a day after Takeshita declared his intention to resign in atonement 
for alleged fund-raising irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling Liberal Democratic Party is in disarray, unable to agree on an 
untainted successor to assume the reins of government other than a party elder 
who is 75 years old and ailing. 
</P>
<P>
Powerful critics in the media are calling for the dissolution of the lower 
house of Parliament. The public is outraged by a new 3% consumption tax imposed 
by the ruling party, unilaterally and over vehement protest. Questions are 
being raised about the government's capacity to conduct foreign policy. And 
prosecutors are rumored to be preparing to indict several ruling party 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
In most countries, the situation might provide opposition forces with an 
excellent opportunity to make a grab for control of Parliament. But not in 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Despite diatribes against the ruling party's "money-power politics," the 
opposition is hopelessly divided on policy and ill-prepared to ride the wave of 
the Recruit Co. influence-buying scandal into power. Posturing over the 
prospects of a coalition government is simply not credible, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
Nor can the opposition accurately claim to have unseated Takeshita. The prime 
minister faced unprecedented low popularity ratings -- 3.9% in a Kyodo News 
Service poll published April 16 -- and was hounded in a media campaign with 
disclosures that he and his aides received about $1.12 million in political 
donations and stock profits from Recruit Co., an information services, computer 
and real estate conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
"Takeshita made a preemptive attack against the opposition by announcing he 
would resign," said Seizaburo Sato, a professor of political science at Tokyo 
University. "It's clear that the opposition parties are in a less favorable 
position now," Sato said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying they lost, but they wanted an election under Takeshita. They 
would have had a much better chance to gain seats." 
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Democrats will pick a leader to replace Takeshita by the time the 
fiscal 1989 budget formally passes Parliament, where the opposition is clinging 
to a somewhat dubious strategy of boycotting deliberations while demanding 
sworn testimony by former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone on his role in the 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling party ignored the opposition boycott and rammed the budget through a 
lower house committee this morning, in keeping with its goal of taking it to a 
vote in a plenary session of the chamber by the end of the week. It was not 
clear whether the opposition would attend the plenary session. The budget is 
expected to be acted upon by the upper house, or go into effect automatically, 
by the end of May. 
</P>
<P>
Masayoshi Ito, one of the few party stalwarts who has not been accused of 
accepting graft, is expected to get the nod as Takeshita's successor, even 
though he is frail and suffering from diabetes, a chronic but not necessarily 
life-threatening disease. According to the prevailing scenario, Ito would serve 
as a caretaker dedicated to reforming political fund-raising practices while 
guiding the party through an upper house election in the summer and a ballot 
for the lower house that must also be held by next summer. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of political reform received emotional impetus Wednesday when Ihei 
Aoki, 58, the aide who handled Takeshita's finances, slit a wrist and hanged 
himself with a necktie in his Tokyo apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Aoki and one of Takeshita's relatives traded in unlisted shares of a Recruit 
subsidiary along with more than 150 others in political, bureaucratic and 
business circles, earning windfall profits that in some cases, prosecutors 
allege, constituted bribes. 
</P>
<P>
"I strongly regret (his action)," the Associated Press quoted Takeshita as 
telling reporters. "We walked side by side for over 30 years." 
</P>
<P>
Shigezo Hayasaka, a political commentator, said in a televised interview: "We 
should take advantage of this tragic incident to focus on the political 
landscape where practicing politics costs too much money. People throughout 
Japan should bring out their wisdom to truly reform the situation." 
</P>
<P>
Hayasaka was a friend of Aoki. He also was the personal secretary of Kakuei 
Tanaka, Takeshita's former mentor and the last prime minister to be forced to 
resign because of a fund-raising scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Tanaka quit in 1974 and remained the most powerful figure in Japanese politics, 
even after he was arrested in 1976 for receiving a bribe from Lockheed -- 
unrelated to the allegations that forced him to step down -- and convicted on 
the charge in 1983. Tanaka withdrew from the political stage after a crippling 
stroke in 1985, but he technically retains a seat in Parliament while his 
appeal is pending. 
</P>
<P>
Critics remain skeptical that the ruling party will attempt anything more than 
cosmetic changes in the political system. As it stands, massive spending is 
required to cultivate support in local constituencies, virtually dictating that 
successful politicians must bend the nominal rules on fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Scanty Effort' 
</P>
<P>
"The ruling party is talking about political reform, but if you examine the 
substance of their plan, all you see is some talk about restricting the sale of 
tickets to fund-raising parties -- it's a scanty effort," said Teiko Kihira, 
vice chairwoman of the Japan League of Women's Voters. 
</P>
<P>
"Takeshita's resignation announcement doesn't do anything to resolve the 
Recruit scandal," Kihira said. "This has tainted nearly the entire leadership 
of the Liberal Democratic Party, and even some of the opposition. It's 
structural corruption, and it's not going to be rooted out by cutting off the 
head." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the hue and cry from the media continues. The newspaper Asahi, which 
broke the news of Recruit's ethically questionable stock transactions last 
summer and has maintained a lead role in disclosing the company's staggering 
program of political contributions, urged in an editorial Wednesday that the 
next administration dissolve the lower house and face the verdict of voters. 
</P>
<P>
"The Recruit scandal revealed how rotten some politicians and those close to 
the incumbent and former prime ministers are," Asahi said. "This scandal will 
remain as an indelible stain in the postwar history of Japanese politics." 
</P>
<P>
Takeshita's resignation "is only the beginning of the cleansing of Japan's 
rotten politics," the liberal newspaper said. "It would not be strange if the 
party is forced to turn over the helm of national politics to the opposition 
parties." 
</P>
<P>
But an editorial in the conservative newspaper Yomiuri was more disparaging 
about the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"Although the support rate for the Takeshita Cabinet has plummeted to an 
all-time low, few have expectations of the opposition parties assuming 
political leadership," it said. "These parties should take this as severe 
public criticism. They are so divided over foreign and domestic policies that 
the public will not support an opposition government at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the major opposition parties -- excluding the Communists -- are keeping up 
the appearances of solidarity. Last week, leaders of the Japan Socialist Party, 
the Komeito or Clean Government Party, the Democratic Socialist Party and the 
Social Democratic Federation met in Kyoto to map out strategy for a coalition. 
</P>
<P>
But the opposition lacks enough seats to wield any formal leverage to force 
dissolution or bring on a lower house election before the Liberal Democrats 
want one. It can only appeal to public opinion and try to shame the ruling 
party into submitting to an electoral test. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, little is being said about how the opposition parties would 
reconcile their formidable differences on policy. The Socialists advocate 
scrapping the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and are friendly with North Korea, for 
example, while the Democratic Socialist Party adheres to a generally 
conservative ideology similar to the ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
The public has expressed its displeasure in several recent local elections, 
suggesting that the ruling party will have to contend with a protest vote when 
half the seats in the less powerful upper house go up for grabs sometime in the 
summer.

JAPAN SCRAPS AIRPORT PLAN IN BOW TO CONSERVATIONISTS 
</P>

In an attempt to boost Japan's image in environmental matters, government 
officials announced Wednesday that they will scrap plans to build a landfill 
airport near a rare stand of blue coral off a remote island in Okinawa 
prefecture. 
</P>
<P>
Junji Nishime, the governor of Okinawa, told a news conference that the 
prefectural, or state, government was responding to international criticism and 
vociferous local protest in deciding to move the airport project to a new site 
about two miles north of the original site. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists had waged a campaign to stop construction at the village of 
Shiraho on Ishigaki Island, saying it would harm one of the few coral reefs 
that has escaped destruction related to development in the Ryukyu Islands. Soil 
erosion has brought on a crown-of-thorns starfish infestation that has killed 
about 90% of the coral in Okinawa prefecture, marine biologists say. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether the revised construction plan will pose any danger to 
the Shiraho reef, or whether the airport will encounter renewed opposition by 
residents near the new site. 
</P>
<P>
Nishime, who had maintained that there was no other suitable location for the 
runway on Ishigaki Island, made his decision after the central government's 
environmental agency came out against the plan. There had been 13 years of 
heated controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Masahisa Aoki, director general of the agency, told reporters that Japan is now 
adopting a "leadership role in protecting the global environment." The 
government plans an international conference on environmental issues in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my conviction that we must protect the coral in Okinawa," Aoki said. 
</P>
<P>
The Shiraho decision is believed to be the first time the agency has asserted 
itself to halt a major development project because of potential environmental 
impact, according to Cecilia Jung-Sook Song of Traffic (Japan), an 
environmental protection group associated with the World Wildlife Fund. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a historic development as far as Japan's environmental policy goes," 
Song said. "Certainly it would have been quite embarrassing if Okinawa had gone 
ahead and dumped on Shiraho." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the World Wildlife Fund, the Cousteau Society and the 
International Union for Conservation of Nature have studied the reef and 
condemned the $240-million project. 
</P>
<P>
Prefectural officials have argued that a new airport is necessary to 
accommodate jumbo jets bringing tourists on direct flights from the main 
Japanese islands. They asserted in a series of environmental assessments, 
disputed by opponents as lacking scientific credibility, that a 6,600-foot 
runway could be built on part of the reef without causing significant harm to a 
nearby colony of blue coral.

U.S.-AUSTRALIA TIES BACKED BY QUAYLE, HAWKE

<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle and Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke reaffirmed 
Wednesday their countries' strong military links but differed on the 
contentious issue of trade. 
</P>
<P>
The two topics dominated 90-minute talks at the start of Quayle's five-day 
visit to Australia on the first leg of an Asian tour. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle, arriving here for his first visit to the Pacific region, was welcomed 
with a 19-gun salute on arrival in this country's capital. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle gave Hawke a letter from President Bush that was "warm and personal" but 
did not delve into hard issues, according to a U.S. official. Hawke is 
scheduled to visit the United States in June, and Bush came to Australia in 
1982, when he was vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle described Australia -- the site of joint strategic satellite, shipping 
and communication monitoring posts -- as "a solid and steadfast ally," U.S. 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
On the thorny issue of trade, Hawke argued for a swift end to the U.S. Export 
Enhancement Program, under which exporters receive a government bonus for 
increased sales. 
</P>
<P>
He said the program, adopted largely to combat European Community subsidies, 
was also affecting Australia's penetration of world markets -- particularly in 
wheat sales -- because it cut prices. 
</P>
<P>
Although the two differed on the issue, Australian officials described the 
atmosphere as "very friendly." 
</P>
<P>
The talks also covered a threat this week by New Zealand Prime Minister David 
Lange to pull out of the ANZUS defense alliance linking his country with 
Australia and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has effectively suspended New Zealand from the alliance since 
1985, after Wellington banned visits by ships carrying nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said both sides want New Zealand to remain in ANZUS, but the United 
States will not change its position of wanting its ships to visit New Zealand 
without preconditions. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle continues his tour, his second trip overseas since taking office, with 
visits to Melbourne and Sydney before leaving Sunday for Indonesia. He will 
also visit Singapore and Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

DEATH TOLL IN MEXICO QUAKE PUT AT 2

<P>
The death toll rose to two Wednesday from a strong earthquake that damaged 
buildings and sparked widespread panic in an area devastated by a major temblor 
four years ago, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Alfonso Masin, chief spokesman for the Mexico City government, said an 
unidentified person died of a heart attack during Tuesday's quake, raising the 
death toll to at least two. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities earlier reported that a 25-year-old man was electrocuted when a 
high-voltage power line fell on him in the capital's central Santa Maria Ribera 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Repair crews worked to patch up a damaged aqueduct and replace shattered 
windows throughout Mexico City and Acapulco, which were rattled Tuesday by the 
quake with a magnitude of 6.8. 
</P>
<P>
Masin said that 33 people sustained injuries requiring hospital treatment in 
the capital, but that all had been released. 
</P>
<P>
The 8:29 a.m. earthquake caused relatively minor damage, cracking walls and 
knocking out some electrical and water service. The city's subway, designed to 
stop automatically during seismic activity, briefly suspended service. 
</P>
<P>
But power blackouts, gas leaks and telephone line breaks were reported in the 
central portion of the city that was badly damaged in the September, 1985, 
earthquake that killed about 10,000 people. Memories of the 1985 quake remain 
strong in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
The quake was centered about 200 miles southwest of the capital and 40 miles 
east of Acapulco.

SENATE PANEL TO PROBE IRAN-CONTRA PAPERS 
</P>

<P>
The Senate Intelligence Committee has decided to launch a formal investigation 
of the apparent White House failure to provide key documents to the 
congressional committees investigating the Iran-Contra scandal, its chairman 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. David L. Boren (D-Okla.), who heads the intelligence panel, said that he 
ordered the inquiry in response to requests from several senators who said that 
they had not been given six significant documents that surfaced as evidence in 
the trial of former White House aide Oliver L. North. 
</P>
<P>
The six documents center on a secret Ronald Reagan Administration effort to 
persuade Honduras to aid the Nicaraguan rebels, including the acceleration of 
U.S. economic aid to Honduras. Several of the documents also include evidence 
that President Bush, as vice president, was more involved in the secret Contra 
aid operation than he has admitted. 
</P>
<P>
"We will look at this matter expeditiously and in a businesslike, nonpolitical 
manner," Boren said in a statement released by his office. "I am determined 
that this matter will not be blown out of proportion or made into a political 
football." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, jurors at the North trial deliberated for a fifth day without 
reaching a verdict. They met for six hours before quitting for the day at 4:25 
p.m., bringing their deliberations to 27 hours over five days. 
</P>
<P>
Theories of why the trial documents were not released to the congressional 
committees range from a deliberate cover-up to simple incompetence, 
congressional investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Some former aides to the Iran-Contra committees said that they have long 
suspected that the White House deliberately withheld some information. White 
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, who served in the Reagan Administration at 
the time of the 1987 congressional inquiry, has denied that charge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
White House Letter 
</P>
<P>
Late Wednesday evening, the White House released copies of a letter from White 
House counsel C. Boyden Gray to Mitchell pledging to "endeavor to be as helpful 
as we can" in resolving questions about the documents. 
</P>
<P>
But Gray took considerable pains to distance Bush from the controversy. "As you 
know," he wrote, "this Administration was not a party to (the) agreements to 
assist the committees and their work." 
</P>
<P>
"We have confidence that the last Administration followed the agreed 
procedures, and that its representatives will be able to address your 
concerns," Gray wrote, noting that Reagan's counsel, Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr., 
"had overall responsibility" for ensuring congressional investigators received 
what they needed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Pick Documents 
</P>
<P>
The congressional committees allowed the White House to determine which 
documents were relevant to their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Other former committee aides have said that the problem may have been more 
innocent. "I went down to the White House to see how they were compiling these 
documents, and I've never seen a more chaotic operation in my life," one said. 
</P>
<P>
Boren's decision to launch a formal investigation followed a request from 
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.); Sen. Daniel K. Inouye 
(D-Hawaii), the chairman of the Senate Iran-Contra panel, and Sen. Warren B. 
Rudman (R-N.H.), the panel's vice chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, Inouye and Rudman complained that the congressional committees 
apparently did not receive copies of four significant documents released during 
the North trial. In the case of two other documents, they said, the committees 
received copies that were not as complete as the versions released in the North 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
The four documents that the committees did not receive: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A Feb. 19, 1985, memorandum from National Security Adviser Robert C. 
McFarlane to President Reagan, recommending accelerated economic and military 
aid to Honduras as "incentives for them to persist in aiding the freedom 
fighters." The memo shows that Reagan approved the recommendation and that a 
copy was sent to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A Feb. 20, 1985, memorandum from North and NSC aide Raymond F. Burghardt to 
McFarlane, noting -- among other things -- that the Honduran aid deal violated 
the spirit of the law. "Notwithstanding our own interpretations, it is very 
clear . . . that the legislative intent was to deny any direct or indirect 
support for military/paramilitary operations in Nicaragua," the memorandum 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A Feb. 22, 1985, memorandum from Burghardt to McFarlane, asking for 
authorization to hand-carry a letter from Reagan to the president of Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An Oct. 30, 1985, memorandum from North to McFarlane, indicating that 
Reagan may have approved a scheme to airdrop recoilless rifles to the Contras 
for an attack on weapons shipments into Nicaragua's Caribbean ports. 
</P>
<P>
The two documents that the committee received in less complete versions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A Feb. 11, 1985, NSC memorandum on the Honduran deal. The version released 
during the trial includes an additional memorandum describing the aid that the 
United States would provide "as an incentive to the Hondurans for their 
continued support to (the Contras). Obviously this part of the message should 
not be contained in a written document, but rather delivered verbally by a 
discreet emissary." The author of the memorandum presumably meant "orally" 
rather than "verbally." 
</P>
<P>
 -- An April 25, 1985, memorandum on President Reagan's telephone call to 
then-Honduran President Roberto Suazo Cordova. The version released during the 
trial includes Reagan's handwritten notes on the conversation, in which he 
urged Suazo to help the Contras and Suazo asked for more economic aid; it also 
includes a notation indicating a copy went to Bush.

FIVE WRIGHT WITNESSES MAY FACE CONTEMPT CHARGES

The House Ethics Committee may vote contempt charges against five balking 
witnesses in its investigation of Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.), the top-ranking 
Republican member of the panel said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one option," Rep. John T. Myers (R-Ind.) told reporters after the 
subpoenaed witnesses failed to show up for questioning Tuesday in San Antonio. 
The committee will meet today to consider further action. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge to the committee's authority will delay a hearing for Wright that 
the Speaker requested immediately, Myers said. He said he does not now expect 
the Speaker's appearance until "sometime in May." 
</P>
<P>
Myers and committee Chairman Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles) flew to San 
Antonio to take sworn testimony from Morris Jaffe, a Texas oilman, and his son, 
Douglas Jaffe, principals in a transaction that produced a quick profit of 
$340,000 for Mallightco, a firm half-owned by the Speaker and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the sale allowed Wright to receive an unexpectedly high price of 
$350,000 for shares held by him and his wife in the company, jointly owned with 
George A. Mallick Jr., a Ft. Worth developer, and Mallick's wife. 
</P>
<P>
The Jaffes and three others involved in the transaction refused to testify 
before the Ethics Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, who met with reporters before Wednesday's House session, turned away 
questions on the issue, saying: "I'm not going to make any comment today on 
that ethics thing."

THE SUPREME COURT AND ABORTION; 
</P>
<P>
EXCERPTS: 'IT IS NOT MERELY POTENTIAL LIFE, BUT ACTUAL LIFE'

These are excerpts from the oral arguments before the Supreme Court in the 
Missouri abortion case: 
</P>
<P>
Rights of Unborn 
</P>
<P>
 (From Missouri Atty. Gen. William Webster.) 
</P>
<P>
This case represents a direct appeal that involves a 1986 Missouri statute 
defining the rights of the unborn and regulating abortion in Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri's appeal involves three basic areas for this court's review: the 
first, the constitutional boundaries on the limitations of public funding; the 
second, the effect of and the facial constitutionality of legislation declaring 
that life begins at conception, and third, the ability of a state to require a 
physician to perform tests and to make and record findings when determining 
viability. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, we have asked this court to reconsider the standard of review to be 
applied to state abortion regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1973, this court has reaffirmed Roe vs. Wade's mandate; state and lower 
federal courts have repeatedly interpreted that mandate, frequently strictly 
against the states. 
</P>
<P>
One result is that the states have effectively been forbidden, not only to 
prohibit abortion, but usually to regulate abortion in any significant way . . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Funding for Abortions 
</P>
<P>
Webster: It seems to us a convoluted result to suggest that, if you can afford 
an abortion, we have to provide one for you in a public facility, but, if you 
lack the financial capacity . . . the state and other public governmental 
entities are not obligated to provide those services for you. 
</P>
<P>
Justice John Paul Stevens: Can I ask you one clarifying question? What is the 
consequence of a violation of that section . . . . 
</P>
<P>
What if a doctor who had a patient in a public hospital went ahead and 
performed, in the first trimester, performed an abortion. Is there any sanction 
against the doctor if he did that? 
</P>
<P>
Webster: This particular chapter (of the law) carries a general misdemeanor 
penalty for violations . . . but there is no operative language . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Stevens: So it would be a misdemeanor, then? 
</P>
<P>
Webster: Arguably, it would be a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens: What is your opinion? Don't you know? 
</P>
<P>
Webster: My opinion is that there is no language in that section which was 
adopted here which would suggest that it would make it a criminal offense . . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens: Is it your opinion as the chief enforcement officer of the state that 
it would not be a misdemeanor? 
</P>
<P>
Webster: We wouldn't view that violation as a misdemeanor, no . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy: Wouldn't it be grounds for discharge . . . ? 
</P>
<P>
Webster: It is conceivable the hospital board could, if somebody violated the 
policy of that facility, seek to discharge that particular employee . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Privacy Issue 
</P>
<P>
(From Charles Fried, for the Bush Administration.) 
</P>
<P>
Today the United States asks this court to reconsider and overrule its decision 
in Roe vs. Wade. 
</P>
<P>
At the outset I would like to make quite clear how limited that submission is. 
</P>
<P>
First, we are not asking the court to unravel the fabric of unenumerated and 
privacy rights which this court has woven in (previous) cases . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Rather, we are asking the court to pull this one thread. 
</P>
<P>
And the reason is well stated by this court . . . abortion is different. 
</P>
<P>
It involves the purposeful termination, as the court said, of potential life. 
</P>
<P>
And I would only add that in the minds of many legislators who pass abortion 
regulation, it is not merely potential life, but actual human life. 
</P>
<P>
And though we do not believe that the 14th Amendment takes any position on that 
question, we think it is an utter non sequitur to say that, therefore, the 
organized community must also take no position in legislation and may not use 
such a position as a premise for regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy: Your position, then, is that Griswold vs. Connecticut (which struck 
down a state's ban on contraceptive sales as an invasion of personal privacy) 
is correct and should be retained? 
</P>
<P>
Fried: Exactly, your honor. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy: Is that because there is a fundamental right involved in that case? 
</P>
<P>
Fried: In Griswold vs. Connecticut, there was a right which was well 
established in a whole fabric of quite concrete matters, quite concrete. 
</P>
<P>
It involved not an abstraction such as the right to control one's body, an 
abstraction such as the right to be let alone, it involved quite concrete 
intrusions into the details of marital intimacy . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy: Does the case stand for the proposition that there is a right to 
determine whether to procreate? 
</P>
<P>
Fried: Griswold surely does not stand for that proposition . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy: What is the right involved in Griswold? 
</P>
<P>
Fried: Beg your pardon? 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy: What is the right involved in Griswold? 
</P>
<P>
Fried: The right involved in Griswold, as the court clearly stated, was the 
right not to have the state intrude into, in a very violent way, into the 
details, inquire into the details of marital intimacy. There was a great deal 
of talk about inquiry into the marital bedroom, and I think that is a very 
different story from what we have here. 
</P>
<P>
Interests of Liberty 
</P>
<P>
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor: Do you say there is no fundamental right to decide 
whether to have a child or not? A right to procreate? Do you deny that the 
Constitution protects that right? 
</P>
<P>
Fried: I would hesitate to formulate the right in such abstract terms, and I 
think the court prior to Roe vs. Wade quite prudently also avoided such 
sweeping generalities. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor: Do you think that the state has the right to, if in a future century 
we had a serious overpopulation problem, has a right to require women to have 
abortions after so many children? 
</P>
<P>
Fried: I surely do not. That would be quite a different matter. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor: What do you rest that on? 
</P>
<P>
Fried: Because unlike abortion, which involves the purposeful termination of 
future life, that would involve not preventing an operation, but violently 
taking hands on, laying hands on a woman and submitting her to an operation . . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor: And you would rest that on substantive due process protection? 
</P>
<P>
Fried: Absolutely. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy: How do you define the liberty interests of the woman in that 
connection? 
</P>
<P>
Fried: The liberty interest against a seizure would be involved. That is how 
the court analyzed the matter in Griswold . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy: How do you define . . . the liberty interest of a woman in an abortion 
case? 
</P>
<P>
Fried: Well, I would think that there are liberty interests involved in terms, 
perhaps, of the contraceptive interest . . . . At all points it is an interest 
which is matched by the state's interest in potential life . . . . 
</P>
<P>
I would like to make clear that, in our view, if Roe were overruled, this court 
would have to continue to police the far outer boundaries of abortion 
regulation under a due process rational basis test, and that test is muscular 
enough . . . to strike down any regulation . . . which did not make proper 
provision for cases where the life of the mother was at risk . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Stevens: Is there a difference between the court's power in the case of an 
abortion that would be life threatening to the woman and an abortion that would 
merely cause her severe and prolonged disease? Is there a constitutional 
difference? 
</P>
<P>
Fried: I think that is a matter of degree, and it is perfectly clear that 
severe health effects shade over into a threat to the life. I cannot promise 
the court that our submission would dispense the federal courts from 
considering matters like that . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Justice Byron R. White: Suppose there is a state that permits abortions and 
they are done in public hospitals. Do you think that is a -- you say that there 
is human life involved, that is destroyed in abortions -- is there some problem 
about the state permitting abortions? 
</P>
<P>
Fried: I think the Constitution takes no position on this point . . . . The 
country's experience and the court's experience under the constitutionalization 
of that issue has been so regrettable that I could not in conscience recommend 
that it be constitutionalized in some other way at another point in the 
spectrum . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Drawing of Lines 
</P>
<P>
 (From Frank Susman, the attorney for those who challenged the Missouri law.) 
</P>
<P>
I think (Fried's) submission is somewhat disingenuous when he suggests to this 
court that he does not seek to unravel the whole cloth of procreational rights, 
but merely to pull a thread. 
</P>
<P>
It has always been my personal experience that when I pull a thread, my sleeve 
falls off. 
</P>
<P>
There is no stopping. 
</P>
<P>
It is not a thread he is after. 
</P>
<P>
It is the full range of procreational rights and choices that constitute the 
fundamental right that has been recognized by this court. 
</P>
<P>
For better or for worse, there no longer exists any bright line between the 
fundamental right that was established in Griswold and the fundamental right of 
abortion that was established in Roe. 
</P>
<P>
These two rights, because of advances in medicine and science, now overlap. 
</P>
<P>
They coalesce and merge and they are not distinct. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Antonin Scalia: You find it hard to draw a line between those two but 
easy to draw a line between first, second and third trimester. I don't see why 
a court that can draw that line can't separate abortion from birth control 
quite readily. 
</P>
<P>
Susman: . . . Things have changed. 
</P>
<P>
The bright line, if there ever was one, has now been extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
That's why I suggest to this court that we need to deal with one right, the 
right to procreate . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy: Do you agree that the state can forbid abortions save to preserve the 
life of the mother after the fetus is, say, 8 months old? Suppose the health 
rights of the mother are not involved . . . ? 
</P>
<P>
Susman: Yes, I am willing to recognize the compelling interest granted in Roe 
of a state in potential fetal life after the point of viability. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy: But that is a line-drawing, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
Susman: Yes, it is. But that is a line that is more easily drawn . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Procreational interests are, indeed, implicit in the concept of ordered 
liberty, and neither liberty nor justice would exist without them. 
</P>
<P>
It is truly a liberty whose exercise is deeply rooted in this nation's history 
and tradition . . . . 
</P>
<P>
I suggest that there can be no ordered liberty for women without control over 
their education, their employment, their health, their childbearing and their 
personal aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
There does, in fact, exist a deeply rooted tradition that the government steer 
clear of decisions affecting the bedroom, childbearing and the doctor-patient 
relationship as it pertains to these concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Viability of Fetus 
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist: It is a deeply rooted tradition, but surely 
abortion was regulated by the state in the 19th Century and in the 20th Century 
. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Scalia: Let me inquire -- I can see deriving a fundamental right from either a 
long tradition that this, the right to abort, has always been protected. I 
don't see that tradition. But I suppose you could also derive a fundamental 
right just simply from the text of the Constitution plus the logic of the 
matter, or whatever. 
</P>
<P>
How can you derive it that way here without making a determination as to 
whether the fetus is a human life or not? It is very hard to say it just is a 
matter of basic principle that it must be a fundamental right unless you make 
the determination that the organism that is destroyed is not a human life. Can 
you as a matter of logic or principle make that determination otherwise? 
</P>
<P>
Susman: I think the basic question . . . whether this is a human life or 
whether human life begins at conception, is not something that is verifiable as 
a fact. It is a question verifiable only by reliance upon faith. 
</P>
<P>
It is a question of labels. 
</P>
<P>
Neither side in this issue and debate would ever disagree on the physiological 
facts. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides would agree as to when a heartbeat can first be detected. Both sides 
would agree as to when brain waves can first be detected. 
</P>
<P>
But when you come to try to place the emotional labels on what you call that 
collection of physiological facts, that is where people part company. 
</P>
<P>
Scalia: I agree with you entirely, but what conclusion does that lead you to? 
That, therefore, there must be a fundamental right on the part of the woman to 
destroy this thing that we don't know what it is. Or, rather, that whether 
there is or isn't is a matter that you vote upon. Since we don't know the 
answer, people have to make up their minds the best they can. 
</P>
<P>
Susman: The conclusion to which it leads me is . . . it must be left as a 
fundamental right . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Women do not make these decisions lightly. They agonize over them.

ABORTION DEBATE: A CLASH OF SIGNS AND CHANTS

<P>
Hundreds of angry and emotional activists clashed in an often confrontational 
battle waged with signs, chants and slogans on the steps of the Supreme Court 
Wednesday, while nine justices inside the building weighed arguments on 
abortion in a somber session. 
</P>
<P>
As lawyers meticulously presented their arguments in the marble-lined 
courtroom, those on the outside tried to take their cases directly to the 
American people via television cameras and reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Police estimated the crowd at between 300 and 400, some of whom had waited all 
night for a chance to get one of the scarce 60 seats open to the public in the 
courtroom. Others traveled from as far away as California and Texas to express 
their views on the controversial issue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Screaming Matches 
</P>
<P>
Signs proclaiming "God Avenges Innocent Blood" and "Keep Abortion Legal" 
sparked heated confrontations among protesters, which often turned into 
screaming matches with fists and signs waving. 
</P>
<P>
"Abortion tears the heads off of babies," Tennessee activist Dan Martino 
bellowed. 
</P>
<P>
"What about the woman?" New York protester Gavrielle Gemma shouted in reply. 
</P>
<P>
The emotional gathering peaked when police arrested 27 students who had pushed 
their way through a police barricade and onto the plaza in front of the court, 
where they chanted "pro-choice, pro-choice" and danced in a chorus line. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the group, Oppression Under Target, said that they wanted to be 
arrested as an act of civil disobedience. Wearing strips of red crepe paper to 
symbolize the "red tape" of government bureaucracy, the protesters were dragged 
away. 
</P>
<P>
A court spokesman said that the 18 women and 9 men were arrested for crossing 
police lines. All of the protesters paid $100 fines and were released. 
</P>
<P>
Over and over again, protesters favoring the right to abortion screamed, "Two, 
four, six, eight -- you can't make us procreate" and "Hey, Hey. Ho, Ho. 
Anti-choice has got to go." Anti-abortion advocates countered with "Stop the 
baby killing" and "Abortion is murder." 
</P>
<P>
The chants grew louder and louder as demonstrators on each side tried to drown 
out the other and make their voices heard inside the court. 
</P>
<P>
One woman carrying a sign that proclaimed, "Pro-life, what a lie, you don't 
care if women die," said that "nobody can make me carry a baby to term" and 
demanded that her body should not be "enslaved to the Catholic church." 
</P>
<P>
Although outnumbered at first, anti-abortion protesters arrived in greater 
numbers as the morning went on, waving signs, carrying banners and screaming 
into megaphones. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
He's Standing Up for Life 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee activist Martino, who said that he was "here with the Lord Jesus 
Christ to stand up for life," was carrying a sign plastered with pictures of 
aborted fetuses and the slogan "U.S. Supreme Court: Almighty God is Watching 
You." 
</P>
<P>
The potentially landmark case centers on a Missouri law that restricts abortion 
and declares that life begins at conception. The court is not expected to issue 
a decision until the term ends sometime around July 1. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people from both sides of the argument came to the court Tuesday 
night with chairs, sleeping bags, pillows and food so that they could have a 
chance to hear the arguments inside the court. 
</P>
<P>
Supreme Court police gave each early arrival a numbered card. Bleary-eyed and 
with aching backs, only a third of the group was let into the courtroom at 9:30 
a.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Recent UCLA graduates Cheryl Guerin and Sherry Paul arrived at the court at 9 
p.m. Tuesday with their blankets and pillows. After hearing the arguments 
Wednesday, both said that it was well worth the wait. 
</P>
<P>
"It was disappointing for the pro-choice side," Guerin said. "(Justice 
Thurgood) Marshall did not open his mouth. He just sat there. It was also so 
male dominated in there. The word 'she' hardly came up." 
</P>
<P>
Dartmouth student Joyce Campbell spent 11 hours at the court waiting in line 
and said that she was "overwhelmed by the experience." Campbell, who is working 
in the Senate, said that the "pro-choice argument seemed pretty weak." 
</P>
<P>
Travis and Ann Thigpen, who live in nearby Virginia, said that the overnight 
wait was worth it, even though they didn't get in to see the arguments. "We 
came up here to go to dinner," Thigpen said. "We found out they were letting 
people in so we stayed. I really think that Roe vs. Wade will be overturned," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Emotional Level 
</P>
<P>
But while lawyers for both sides debated the finer points of constitutional 
law, protesters in front of the court fought on a more emotional level. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Robinson, a 27-year-old lobbyist from Virginia, said she was concerned 
that the court will restrict abortions and vowed to "quit my job and fight for 
the rest of my life to save this right." 
</P>
<P>
Terry Wykoff, 35, traveled from New York to participate in a 12-hour prayer 
vigil on the steps of the court. Starting at midnight Tuesday, Wykoff and a 
dozen other people lit candles and prayed that Roe vs. Wade would be 
overturned. 
</P>
<P>
"The Supreme Court will decide on the side of life," she said confidently, 
pointing to her Operation Rescue sweatshirt. "The fate of millions of children 
are in their hands."

The top 10 donors to legislative campaigns, led by doctors for the fifth 
election cycle in a row, gave more than $6.3 million in 1987-88, almost all of 
it to incumbents, a citizens group said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
California Common Cause said the 10 biggest contributors gave $6,373,871 to 
legislative candidates between Jan. 1, 1987, and Dec. 31, 1988, generally 
considered the fund-raising period, or cycle, for the 1988 elections. That 
represents an increase of $593,677 over the 1985-86 period and $2,398,867 over 
1983-84, the group's report said. 
</P>
<P>
Ninety-two percent of the 1987-88 money went to incumbents, although some funds 
were funneled by incumbents to challengers in their parties, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
Legislative candidates spent $76.2 million altogether in 1987-88, according to 
the state Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
California Medical Political Action Committee, the campaign arm of the powerful 
California Medical Assn., has led all donors over the last two years by giving 
$1,302,562 to legislative candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last 10 years, California Medical PAC has given nearly $4.6 million to 
legislative candidates, far more than the second-place contributor, the 
California Trial Lawyers Assn., which gave $2.8 million in that period. 
</P>
<P>
Top givers in 1987-88 included the trial lawyers, $1.06 million; California 
Real Estate Political Action Committee, $718,237; California Teachers Assn., 
$605,357; California Correctional Peace Officers Assn., $515,136; California 
Beer &amp; Wine Wholesalers Community Affairs Fund, $467,115; Atlantic 
Richfield Co., $428,180; California Dental Political Action Committee, 
$418,286; California Bankers Assn. Political Action Committee, $415,500, and 
Insurance Men's Political Action Committee, $402,326.

BROKERING IN GOVERNOR'S RACE ASSAILED 
</P>

Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, a Democratic contender for governor, Wednesday 
assailed as "outrageous and presumptuous in the extreme" a suggestion by 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown that power brokers select the party's 1990 
gubernatorial nominee. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein another Democratic 
hopeful, also attacked Brown's notion as smacking "more of the Kremlin than 
California." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, whose influence is felt more heavily in Assembly election campaigns than 
in gubernatorial races, made the suggestion Monday, saying it was a way to 
avoid an expensive and divisive Democratic primary that could play to the 
advantage of the presumed Republican nominee, U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he believed that if the election were held now, Wilson would win. He 
suggested that if top Democratic politicians could settle on one candidate and 
consolidate their financial support behind this individual, Democrats could 
enhance their general election chances of recapturing the governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, who enjoys the support of many of the state's top Democrats and 
would probably be the most likely beneficiary of a brokered nominating process, 
nonetheless dismissed it, saying, "I find that an outrageous kind of proposal 
and presumptuous in the extreme." 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to have brokered politics for the governorship of California 
as far as I am concerned," Van de Kamp said in response to a question at a 
press conference. "I don't care who (Brown) supports, whether it is me or 
anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Brown had conceded that his idea might be undemocratic but said, "It sure is a 
practical way to make sure we have a better chance of winning." 
</P>
<P>
While Van de Kamp is considered the favorite of the Democratic establishment, 
he trailed Feinstein in a recent statewide poll. Another potential aspirant is 
state Controller Gray Davis, who declined to comment on the Speaker's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Hadley Roff, a spokesman for the Feinstein campaign, said Brown's suggestion 
bore an imprint "more of the Kremlin than California. I think an old-fashioned 
primary where the issues are discussed strengthens the party more than weakens 
it because it brings more people and interest into the process." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), whom Brown nominated to head up the 
brokering, indicated he wanted no part of such an arrangement.

STATE PROBES DONATIONS TO ASSEMBLYMAN 
</P>

<P>
The state attorney general's office has launched an inquiry into Assemblyman 
Pete Chacon's receipt last year of $7,500 from the California Check Cashers 
Assn., which opposed legislation he was carrying to regulate the industry's 
charges, a top state Department of Justice official confirmed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Chacon reported receiving $4,000 from the trade group on April 14, 1988, the 
same day the bill was shelved, with his acquiescence, by the Assembly Finance 
and Insurance Committee. Chacon has said the timing was a coincidence. He 
received another $3,500 from the group in July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson P. Kempsky, chief deputy attorney general, said the office has been 
reviewing the case for about three weeks in what he called a "preliminary 
inquiry," which could lead to a full-blown investigation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To 'See What We Have' 
</P>
<P>
"We are taking a look at this to see if anything improper occurred," Kempsky 
said. "We are going to look at the reports filed with the Fair Political 
Practices Commission and other reporting agencies, interview the people who 
gave the money and the assemblyman, and see what we have." 
</P>
<P>
The probe could "bloom into a broader and deeper investigation" or it could be 
dropped, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kempsky said the attorney general's findings will be forwarded to the district 
attorneys in San Diego and Sacramento counties, who will decide whether 
prosecution is warranted. 
</P>
<P>
Chacon, a Democrat from San Diego, reported receiving the money on his annual 
statement of economic interests filed March 1 with the FPPC. He has said he 
took the money as compensation for touring several check-cashing stores in Los 
Angeles and then meeting with the check cashers group's Board of Directors. 
Chacon could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Nix Jr., president of the check cashers' group, said the association paid 
Chacon "to show our thanks" for the assemblyman spending time learning about 
the industry. He said the bill, as it was introduced by Chacon, could have put 
many of the association's 300 members out of business. 
</P>
<P>
There is no law prohibiting state lawmakers from receiving money from a trade 
group supporting or opposing their legislation, Kempsky said. But the parties 
could be prosecuted if they agreed to exchange the money for some sort of 
legislative action, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether there was wrongdoing in this case depends on the intent and the 
understanding of the parties," Kempsky said. "If the money was given with the 
intent to influence a legislative outcome or vote, or an action such as 
dropping a bill, there would be evidence of a crime. If it was accepted for 
that purpose, that would be improper." 
</P>
<P>
As it was introduced Feb. 18, 1988, Chacon's bill would have limited the fees 
the check cashers could charge to 1% on government checks, payroll checks, 
traveler's checks, money orders or cashier's checks. Fees for cashing other 
checks would have been limited to 1.5%, 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Amended the Bill 
</P>
<P>
Chacon amended the bill April 11, three days before it was scheduled for a 
hearing in the Finance and Insurance Committee. The amendments raised the 
allowable fees to 1.75% and 3%, depending on the kind of check being cashed. 
</P>
<P>
The committee voted 19 to 0 to send the bill to an "interim hearing" -- a 
special hearing held between legislative sessions where members hear about a 
particular issue in detail. But no further hearing on the issue was held, 
according to Will Brown, a former consultant for the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he attempted to schedule the hearings several times but Chacon's 
office never responded to his phone calls regarding the bill.

AL MARTINEZ: SPIES, TACOS AND ME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
I came back from vacation just in time to be praised by George Bush as a 
decent, family loving American and to be condemned by Sick &amp; Tired as a 
filthy, overbreeding beaner. Something's wrong here. 
</P>
<P>
As you know, President Bush has been in town spreading kindness. On Tuesday, 
warmed by refried beans and chicken enchiladas, he said that Latinos were just 
about the best thing to happen to L.A. since the kosher burrito. 
</P>
<P>
He was, of course, talking about Republican Latinos. How he feels about 
Democratic Latinos is another story. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, it was in a spirit of good will that the President took all of us 
little brown ones to his bosom and blew kisses to the Aztecs as a mariachi band 
played "La Cucaracha" and pinatas swayed gratefully in the breeze. 
</P>
<P>
I was naturally pleased with all of this, being a person of umber hues, and 
whistled an ethnic tune as I sat at a desk in the city room opening my mail. 
</P>
<P>
It is considered unwise and possibly bad luck to whistle in a news room, but no 
one in his right mind is going to tell a by God Mexican to shut up when he is 
ethnically amusing himself. We are a volatile people. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the mail was friendly and chatty and therefore dumped in a waste 
basket, though some, I am pleased to say, came from withered, miserable old men 
who challenged my grammar, my syntax and my right to earn more than the minimum 
wage. 
</P>
<P>
And then there was Sick &amp; Tired. 
</P>
<P>
Sick &amp; Tired writes racist letters and one of them arrived Tuesday, which I 
felt appropriate in view of President Bush's flan-sweetened celebration of la 
raza. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, alluding to a recent column on a woman who kept 20 cats in a less 
than tidy condition, said: 
</P>
<P>
". . . The 'pollution' this nation, state, county needs to 'get rid of' is 
'Mexican' spies with their 'cold eyes,' filth, laziness, gangs, 'overbreeding' 
&amp; on &amp; on &amp; on." 
</P>
<P>
The letter was unsigned but I recognized the handwriting and the excessive use 
of quotation marks from previous notes signed Sick &amp; Tired. A friend who 
purports to analyze handwriting has decided that the writer is an unmarried 
woman in her late 40s with a psychotic hatred of tostadas. 
</P>
<P>
When I showed my wife the note from S&amp;T, she said, "You're reasonably 
clean, I doubt you're a spy and you're certainly not an overbreeder, but that 
lazy part might fit." 
</P>
<P>
She was talking about garden work. 
</P>
<P>
We have an argument every spring about pulling weeds. She wants me to get out 
there and muck around in God's good earth but I am emotionally incapable of 
mucking. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I mean about lazy," she says. "I work, take care of the house and 
pull weeds too." 
</P>
<P>
"Hire a Mexican," I say. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a Mexican," she says, "so do something." 
</P>
<P>
"OK," I say, "I'll write you a sonnet." 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-six million Latinos in America," she says, "and I've got to marry one 
who won't do physical work." 
</P>
<P>
I'm glad she doesn't call me Hispanic. The term annoys me. Hispanics dance on 
their toes and tuck lace hankies up their satin sleeves. I make it known 
wherever I go that I am not Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
"Then what shall I call you?" a woman demanded in frustration once at a dinner 
party. She was stumbling between Hispanic, Latino and Mexican-American. 
</P>
<P>
"Call me Al," I said. 
</P>
<P>
Until a few years ago I got racist letters from a man who signed himself 
Pancho. His notes contained abundant references to chili peppers and greasy 
fingers. 
</P>
<P>
I could tolerate that OK, but then he began telling bullfight jokes. I place 
animal jokes in the same category as puns and scatalogical humor. I tracked him 
down and staked out his house. He was a frightened little guy who got his kicks 
out of taunting others. 
</P>
<P>
I gave him back his letters and suggested he was temperamentally unfit to 
write. I never heard from him again. 
</P>
<P>
Back to Sick &amp; Tired. Satirist Samuel Butler said it doesn't matter what we 
hate as long as we hate something. 
</P>
<P>
A Mexican worker I finally hired to pull weeds said it better. Before he took 
the job, he wanted to know if any blacks lived next door. When I said no, he 
sighed with relief. 
</P>
<P>
"No like," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One more chorus of "La Bamba," George, and we'll all go home.

WARY DEALERS APPLY BRAKES ON TEST DRIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYETTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So, having scanned the Sunday classifieds, you decide to drop into a dealership 
to test drive one of those top-of-the-line luxury cars -- "Pure Power . . . 
Ready to Deal! . . . Hundreds in Stock! . . . " 
</P>
<P>
It probably will not be as simple as finding a salesman, picking a car and 
taking off. In the wake of last week's disappearance -- and reported murder -- 
of a salesman who was giving a demonstration ride in a new $21,000 sports car, 
the Greater Los Angeles Motor Car Dealers Assn. has issued an emergency 
bulletin to its 200 dealer-members with guidelines "to prevent tragedies like 
this from ever happening again." 
</P>
<P>
Recommended procedures include: taking a photocopy of a customer's driver's 
license or current state I.D. card bearing a photograph, and requiring them to 
fill out a check-in slip giving insurance information. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's shocked" by the disappearance of Charles Washington, 61, from the 
Barish Chrysler-Plymouth dealership on South La Brea Avenue, said Alan Rueff, a 
San Fernando Buick dealer who is vice president of the dealers' group. "I don't 
believe it's ever happened before. We've all had somebody take a salesman for a 
ride and say 'get out' and steal the car." 
</P>
<P>
Police in Nebraska reported Friday that Yale Booska, 21, spotted near Grand 
Island driving the stolen 1989 Chrysler Conquest TSI and captured after a 
high-speed chase, had admitted shooting Washington and dumping his body near 
Interstate 10 "between L.A. and Palm Springs." As of midday Wednesday, police 
had not found the body and Booska was fighting extradition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Precautions Urged 
</P>
<P>
Dealers always have urged sales personnel to take precautions, Rueff said, but 
"everybody gets slack." Washington had not photocopied the suspect's license, 
although he was a veteran salesman described by a Barish manager as "very 
street wise." But, Rueff said, "I'll bet everybody's real tight right now." 
</P>
<P>
Demonstration drive safety procedures recommended by the dealers' group also 
specify: 
</P>
<P>
 -- When possible, have a second salesman accompany the primary salesman on 
demonstration drives. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Notify another salesman or a manager when leaving the lot so the time can 
be noted. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Avoid taking more than one person at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Take note of the vehicle in which the customer arrived. Be wary of couples 
or groups who arrive in more than one car. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Never leave keys in the ignition of a demo car, not even when switching 
seats with the customer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don't go on a drive with any customer about whom you have strong misgivings 
or premonitions. 
</P>
<P>
What of individuals selling a car, the ones identified in classifieds as "pp" 
(private party)? How can they protect themselves from "buyers" with theft or 
violence on their mind? 
</P>
<P>
Detective Gary Redel of the Los Angeles Police Department's Burglary-Auto 
Division suggested: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Never invite anyone to your home" to see a car. "I've arrested enough 
people to tell you that bad people look in the newspapers for high-dollar cars 
-- for the sole purpose of stealing that car." It's safer, he said, to meet 
prospective buyers on "neutral ground" such as a supermarket parking lot -- and 
have the meeting in daylight. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Before showing a car, remove all documents with your address. "They pull a 
gun, you get out, the car is theirs," he said, adding they know where you live. 
"They probably think if you have the kind of money to buy that car, you live in 
a $300,000 or $400,000 house and have a lot of jewelry." Those in most 
jeopardy, he said, are those selling expensive cars -- Mercedes, Porsches, 
BMWs. "Those cars bring big prices on the black market." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Should sellers ride along when buyers ask for a test-drive? "I don't think 
you have any choice," Redel said. "You can't let him take off by himself. You 
have to take some chances in life." Holding drivers' licenses and letting them 
go is fairly futile, in his view. "Big deal. Maybe it's not him. Crooks are so 
sophisticated today." 
</P>
<P>
 -- As an added precaution before meeting buyers -- "Tell somebody where you're 
going" or "bring a friend. It doesn't hurt to have a witness." 
</P>
<P>
When dealing with the public, Redel said, "You never know what's going to 
happen at any time. In Los Angeles, you always have to be aware or you're going 
to be eaten alive."

GOODALL: SPELLBINDING ADVOCATE FOR ANIMALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH ANN KRIER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a week marked by gory photos of mutilated animals and shrill protests on 
behalf of "World Laboratory Animal Liberation Week," she offers a cool, clear 
voice of reason. 
</P>
<P>
London-born primatologist Jane Goodall brings with her no pictures of armless 
monkeys, no clever signs such as "Imagine having your body left to science 
while you're still in it." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, 55-year-old Goodall, who began studying the wild chimps of Gombe 
Stream National Park in Tanzania nearly 30 years ago, quietly seduces her 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Weapon of choice for the woman who paved the way for Dian Fossey and other ape 
researchers? A spellbinding, awe-inducing slide show on one of her favorite 
chimp families in Gombe. 
</P>
<P>
Here Tuesday, for instance, Goodall unquestionably has the crowd at Santa 
Monica College's gymnasium in the palm of her fine-boned hand. Then she moves 
on to the hot issues of day. If chimpanzees are to survive -- she says they're 
an endangered species, down from millions to perhaps 150,000 in the wild -- 
Goodall insists certain practices must stop. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Private ownership of chimpanzees as pets, celebrity owners such as Michael 
Jackson notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cruel capturing, selling and using chimps and other animals for medical 
research ("It's arrogant of us as humans in the first place just to think we 
have the right to do medical research on animals," she claims, acknowledging, 
however, that because "animal research is built right into almost everything 
that medical research does" an immediate cutoff would create chaos and increase 
human suffering. She believes more alternative research methods should be found 
and rewarded with scientific prizes. In the meantime, she wants more money and 
concern invested into seeing that research animals receive the best possible 
treatment). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Abusive treatment of chimpanzees used for entertainment purposes in 
circuses, stage performances and films. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very sad. Even films that have had a very good message nevertheless 
resulted in the death of some of the chimps," she says. "I think the motivating 
thing that keeps me going on this particular course is the more you know about 
animals, the more horrified you are by cruelty -- to animals and towards human 
beings. A lot of it is due to ignorance." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Annual Lecture Tour 
</P>
<P>
Slim and elegant with her graying hair pulled back in a simple ponytail and 
only the slightest touch of makeup coloring her face, Goodall is on her annual 
lecture tour. Having arrived from Seattle at 2 a.m. after taping a segment for 
Ted Koppel's "Nightline" there, she's had little sleep, arrives slightly late 
for a fast press conference at the college, then heads to the gym for her 
speech, where it's standing room only. 
</P>
<P>
At its conclusion, she receives a standing ovation, with students and faculty 
members instantly descending on her in a frenzied swarm after she leaves the 
lectern. 
</P>
<P>
A bit taken aback by the crowd pressing in on her so tightly, she reveals it's 
a new, if momentarily unsettling experience. Then, quickly seeing its public 
relations value, she asks a photographer if he's captured the mob scene on film 
and requests copies of the photographs. 
</P>
<P>
Goodall sees much of the contribution of her later years as raising 
consciousness about animals and what humans can learn from them. About a third 
of her year is now spent lecturing (her fee is $15,000 per speech) and 
fund-raising for the Tucson-based Jane Goodall Institute, which supports a 
staff of six and assorted research and education projects. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Life of Thirds 
</P>
<P>
Another third of her year is spent in Gombe, where Tanzania natives now 
accomplish most of her field research with video cameras. And the final third 
of the year is invested at her home in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, where she is a 
visiting professor in zoology at the University of Dar es Salaam. 
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. animal psychologists, Goodall's work is internationally 
respected, both by scientists and lay observers alike. And it's considered 
seminal, particularly her findings that chimpanzees are capable of making and 
using tools -- behavior previously thought to be the exclusive territory of 
humans. 
</P>
<P>
"Her work is almost comparable to that of Einstein's," said Roger Fouts, a 
professor of psychology at Central Washington University in Ellensburg, Wash., 
who has conducted language experiments with laboratory chimpanzees for more 
than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"What Einstein is to physics, Jane Goodall is to the behavioral sciences. She's 
had a tremendous philosophical effect as well. . . . She showed us there was a 
mentality there (in chimps). . . . Most science comes up with theory and then 
we go out and try to force the animals to do what the theory says. Jane's is a 
humble science. She asks the animals to tell her about themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Off the record, some animal psychologists and primatologists will say that 
there is virtually no comparison between the work of Goodall, the pioneer in 
the field, and the late Dian Fossey, who may currently be better known than 
Goodall because of her mysterious death and the popularity of the film 
"Gorillas in the Mist." Indeed, some researchers note that whereas Goodall has 
been a careful, reliable observer, Fossey was considered a problem-plagued 
flake. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Most Recognizable' 
</P>
<P>
Fouts affirms that, by and large, such perceptions are commonplace within the 
scientific community. "Dian had some personal problems that interfered with her 
work," he said. "Dian really didn't have the training that Jane brought to it. 
And Jane published much more. Jane was the first (to study apes extensively in 
the wild) and her study is the longest-running. I read one poll that listed 
Jane Goodall as the most recognizable living scientist in the world." 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California this day, Goodall is treated like a star, asked 
repeatedly to sign autographs and spend time with bigwigs from the college. 
She's also scheduled to appear at a USC symposium on Friday, speaking on "The 
Independent and Interdependent Occupations of Chimpanzee Infants and Mothers." 
</P>
<P>
It's a topic dear to her and she works it in briefly at Santa Monica College 
when a student asks her if there's any way that aggressive, sometimes violent 
chimp behavior can help us to understand human violence. 
</P>
<P>
After having watched several generations of the Gombe chimps be born and 
eventually become mothers themselves, Goodall points out what she qualifies as 
"my own bias." It's that there are distinct effects of different types of 
mothering and early experience. In short, she's observed that if a mother chimp 
is "on the cold, harsh, asocial side" with her offspring, that youngster will 
be "less able to create meaningful, close relationships" with adults as he or 
she grows up. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Necessary Aloofness 
</P>
<P>
Then asked if she herself is considered a "dominant female" by the chimps she's 
watched over the years, Goodall replies that she has gone to great lengths not 
to become part of the chimps' social group: "It would interfere with their 
behavior." 
</P>
<P>
She also finds the idea extremely dangerous. "I've been attacked by adolescent 
males (chimps)," she said. "They'll attack basically anything that's moving and 
that includes wretched human observers." 
</P>
<P>
Goodall's questioners offer her no attacks, only respectful inquiries showing 
their appreciation of her work. As the day wears on and she faces smaller 
audiences of students, faculty members and patrons of the college, she remains 
animated as she answers questions she has addressed hundreds, perhaps thousands 
of times. 
</P>
<P>
She clearly knows the value of spreading the word. And that the antidote is not 
far off. 
</P>
<P>
"Going around on a tour like this, six weeks of constantly meeting people, 
lecturing, press interviews, it's very draining," she allows later, in a brief 
telephone conversation the next morning. "It leaves you feeling sort of empty, 
you know. When I go back to Dar es Salaam, there is a desk piled with letters 
and books to write and things that are overdue. 
</P>
<P>
"But when I get to Gombe, it's utterly peaceful. It's what I consider to be the 
real world. It hasn't changed for thousands of years. There's nothing to give 
to . . . so you receive."

YOUR WHEELS: CLEARING AIR ON CATALYTIC CONVERTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: My car, a 1977 station wagon with a catalytic converter, now has more 
than 100,000 miles on it. Is the catalytic converter still doing what it is 
supposed to do? How much longer will it function well? What effect does the 
malfunctioning of a converter have on an engine? And what does all this have to 
do with air quality? -- A.K.E. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Until very recently, little was known publicly about how well emission 
systems hold up in cars as they age and accumulate miles. Under federal 
regulations, emissions systems in cars are supposed to continue to do their job 
for at least 5 years or 50,000 miles, and auto makers must warrant the key 
parts of the car that control emissions, including the catalytic converter. 
</P>
<P>
A recent study of emissions conducted by the Auto Club of Southern California 
had both encouraging and discouraging findings. The cars involved in the study 
were limited to those that had proper maintenance and computerized engine 
controls, meaning the cars are among the cleanest-running on the road. 
</P>
<P>
What the Auto Club found was that fewer than 10% of the vehicles tested met the 
statutory (5 years or 50,000 miles) emission standard. On average, the vehicles 
exceeded the standard for hydrocarbon emissions by 22% and the standard for 
oxides of nitrogen by 34%. 
</P>
<P>
The good news was that by 50,000 miles, the deterioration of the emission 
control systems stabilizes and the engines don't continue to get worse. In the 
category of hydrocarbons, for example, the deterioration in the emission 
control system virtually stopped after 60,000 miles. In carbon dioxide, it 
virtually stopped after 45,000 miles. And in oxides of nitrogen, it stopped 
after about 40,000 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, the cars that failed to meet emission standards came from 
virtually all manufacturers, domestic and foreign. The study looked at 67 cars; 
these were owned by club members, two major corporations and rental agencies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Serious Problem 
</P>
<P>
Although the test did not include poorly maintained cars, engineering experts 
at the club acknowledged that emissions in these cars are a more serious 
problem. It is estimated that if all cars on the road in Southern California 
met federal standards, hydrocarbon emissions alone would be cut from the 360 
tons per day currently spewed into the air, to only 180 tons per day. 
</P>
<P>
"Manufacturers are capable of making clean cars," said Michael R. Appleby, the 
Auto Club's manager of automotive engineering. "Now, all they have to do is get 
the cars to meet the standards." 
</P>
<P>
As for your catalytic converter, it is probably still doing its job if your car 
can pass an emissions test required by the Department of Motor Vehicles. The 
converter can hold up quite well if only unleaded fuel has been used in the 
engine. But even a single tankfull of leaded gasoline can ruin a converter. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a converter can be damaged by a misfiring engine, dieseling, hot 
flooding and an inoperative choke, among other common problems. If you are the 
original owner of your car, then you should have a fair idea of how the engine 
has been treated through the years. 
</P>
<P>
The converter uses platinum to stimulate chemical reactions in the exhaust 
gases from your engine. The hot gases pass over a large surface area of 
platinum, which converts the hazardous gases to relatively benign gases. For 
example, poisonous carbon monoxide gases are converted to carbon dioxide by the 
addition of oxygen molecules. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to say how a malfunctioning converter will affect the 
performance of your particular car, because all cars are different. Generally, 
however, a converter that no longer is working increases fuel consumption. And 
finally, if the converter is no longer doing its job, the effect on the 
atmosphere is that your car is contributing more than its fair share of that 
360 tons of pollution every day.

NEW AND USEFUL: CAT LITTER HAS FELINES, OWNERS PURRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SIMROSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cat lovers are giving rave reviews to a new cat litter called Ever Clean. It's 
virtually odorless and is easy to clean up. 
</P>
<P>
Introduced in mid-1988 by A&amp;M Pet Products of Houston, Ever Clean is made 
of natural, nontoxic minerals that resemble fine sand. The material, which has 
no added deodorants, absorbs the cat's urine quickly, forming it into a compact 
ball so it can be removed from the litter box easily with a scooper, just as 
solid waste is. You then add a little more Ever Clean to the box, rather than 
having to replace the entire box of litter every few days. 
</P>
<P>
Be advised, though, that cats seem to like Ever Clean as much as their owners. 
"At first they think they're at the beach and dig in it and throw it out of the 
box," said one cat lover who tried Ever Clean. "But that didn't last long; part 
of a day. And they do seem to like it." 
</P>
<P>
A&amp;M President Dennis Markel says that even though his company's product is 
more expensive than conventional cat litter, cat owners will use much less Ever 
Clean. He suggests that you determine the weekly cost of the regular litter you 
use, including expenses for cat box liners and deodorants, then compare it with 
the cost of Ever Clean (which is not used with cat box liners). 
</P>

Markel estimates that one indoor cat will use a 5-pound jug of Ever Clean each 
month. A 5-pound container retails for about $10; a 12-pound one for between 
$18 and $20. Depending on how many times each week you empty your cat's box, 
you'll probably find that Ever Clean will cost about 50 cents more each week. 
</P>
<P>
To start using Ever Clean, you'll need the bigger jug of litter because it is 
recommended that you fill the litter box 2 to 3 inches deep. That takes 1 2/3 
of the small containers of Ever Clean. 
</P>
<P>
Ever Clean is sold in pet shops, pet supply stores and by some veterinarians, 
but not in grocery stores. For information on where you can by the product in 
your area, call (800) 284-2287 or write to A&amp;M Pet Products, P.O. Box 
460509, Houston, Tex. 77056.

Going Crackers 
</P>
<P>
There's a new cracker on the market designed to appeal to sports fans. Sport 
Snacks are bite-size crackers shaped like baseballs, basketballs and footballs. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual crackers are part of Sunshine Biscuits' new line of no-cholesterol 
and low-cholesterol products that are free of coconut oil and more than 98% 
free of palm oil. Included in the cholesterol-free lineup with Sport Snacks are 
Wheats, Krispy Whole Wheats crackers and oatmeal cookies called O.T. Bears. 
</P>
<P>
Bridge players and other card game aficionados may want to turn their attention 
to Sunshine's Shuffles, a low-cholesterol cheese cracker made in the form of 
hearts, clubs, diamonds and spades. Shuffles are made with 100% natural skim 
milk cheese. 
</P>
<P>
The new cracker snacks are available in most major grocery chains. Sports 
Snacks cost about $1.89; Shuffles, $1.79. LYNN SIMROSS

JOHNNY GRIFFIN GIVES A LESSON IN PURE SOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Jazz Music!" exclaimed tenor saxophonist Johnny Griffin with a broad smile at 
the conclusion of his scintillating first set at Catalina Bar and Grill in 
Hollywood on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
It was both a statement of what Griffin and his crew -- Michael Weiss (piano), 
Dennis Irwin (bass) and Kenny Washington (drums) -- had just played as it was a 
joyous exultation. Griffin is of the school where jazz means one thing: pure, 
unadulterated cooking music where pretty notes reign. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin's five-tune set, which began a five-night engagement, opened at a 
near-gallop with "Just Friends" and closed with an even-faster "Hot Sake." 
Sandwiched in between were Thelonious Monk's, "Coming on the Hudson," the 
enchanting Billy Strayhorn ballad "Isfahan"; and the standard, "If I Should 
Lose You." 
</P>
<P>
Griffin, a prodigious improviser, produced a comely, robust sound, consistently 
employed dynamics and displayed excellent taste. "Isfahan" was Griffin at his 
rhapsodic best. 
</P>
<P>
The rhythm team was first-rate. Weiss, a Bud Powell disciple, turned in ace 
performances, Washington crackled, and Irwin played a brace of listenable 
essays. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin is a magical musician who can take the basics of melody, harmony, 
rhythm and form and turn them into something beautiful and wondrous.ZAN STEWART

AULD DEFIES TIME

<TEXT>
<P>
Georgie Auld's public appearances in recent years have been about as common as 
total eclipses; but unlike eclipses, Auld's performances shed light instead of 
reducing it. That, at least, was the impression Tuesday when his radiant tenor 
saxophone illuminated the Grand Avenue Bar of the Biltmore. 
</P>
<P>
It took only a few bars of "Just You, Just Me" to provide renewed evidence of a 
sound and style that have defied the inroads of time. Now three weeks short of 
his 70th birthday, Auld is as buoyantly expressive now as he was on classic 
Benny Goodman recordings almost a half-century ago. 
</P>
<P>
His tone is close to that of the memorable Ben Webster; his ballads, "Misty" 
and "Body And Soul," exuded a very special warmth. 
</P>
<P>
Pianist Marty Harris, bassist Tony Dumas and drummer Dick Berk offered vigorous 
and sympathetic support. LEONARD FEATHER

PERRY IN RECITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE BURROUGHS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Antoinette Perry brought exceptional artistry as percussionist to her Tuesday 
night recital in the Arnold Schoenberg Institute at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging pianist Perry thus merely underscores the perspective of her 
challenging program. In music of Schoenberg, Bartok, Shostakovich, George Crumb 
and Donald Keats, Perry exploited those possibilities of the piano that 
graphically emphasize its historic assignation to the percussion family of 
instruments. 
</P>
<P>
And she did so with the same intense care and respect that she has brought to 
Mozart and Beethoven. 
</P>
<P>
Perry served up a meticulously crafted reading of Crumb's "Little Suite for 
Christmas, AD 1979," that could have passed for improvisation. Percussive 
elements never degenerated into bombast. She got up and down with disarming 
grace to strike, pluck and play glissandos on the strings inside the piano, and 
gave discreet weight to echoes of Faure and Debussy. 
</P>
<P>
Her skillfully lathed plan for three of Shostakovich's Preludes and Fugues, 
Opus 87, ended much better than it began. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately these, and especially her super-charged performance of Bartok's 1926 
Sonata, were distinguished by Perry's absolute rhythmic security, uncommonly 
adroit pedaling (every harmony registered clearly as it flashed by), her 
elegiac way with stark, bare-bones lyricism, and her ability to sustain an 
allegro with the momentum of a roaring freight train. BRUCE BURROUGHS

CELLIST CARLOS PRIETO AT PLAZA DE LA RAZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a generous encore to his formal appearance on the Chamber Music in Historic 
Sites series over the weekend, cellist Carlos Prieto on Monday night gave an 
informal performance at Plaza de la Raza in Lincoln Park. In the airy but 
intimate Margo Albert Theater, it was a mini-version of the recital he had 
offered at the Doheny Mansion on Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran musician, colleague of Stravinsky and Shostakovich and devotee of 
works by Villa-Lobos, gave this outreach program under auspices of the Da 
Camera Society of Mount St. Mary's College, sponsor of the Historic Sites 
series.. 
</P>
<P>
Plaza de la Raza may not yet be an historic site, but it turned out to be an 
amenable place for this concert by Prieto and his splendid pianistic partner, 
Doris Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
Their performance proved brief but potent. 
</P>
<P>
Rachmaninoff's famous "Vocalise" immediately established the duo's intensity 
and musical communicativeness. Two movements from Shostakovich's Sonata, Opus 
40, exhibited their colorful virtuosity in tight, mordant readings. 
</P>
<P>
They served the causes of variety and lyric tautness in Carlos Chavez's 
"Madrigal" (1921), then capped this display with mercurial but deeply probing 
accounts of works by Ginastera and Tchaikovsky. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, the cellist produced a consistent stream of pure and articulate 
sounds in support of stylish music making; in this, he was assisted 
wholeheartedly by Stevenson. They make an exceptional team. DANIEL CARIAGA

As many as 12 million Americans would give up cigarettes if doctors urged their 
smoking patients to quit and supported those who took the advice, Surgeon 
General C. Everett Koop said. Koop joined the National Cancer Institute and the 
American Cancer Society in challenging phynsicians and health professionals to 
counsel their patients who smoke. Koop and the cancer groups asserted that 
smokers whose doctors help them quit are perhaps six times more likely to kick 
the habit for good. Yet the surgeon general said a 1987 survey found that only 
49% of smokers reported that their physicians ever advised them to quit. To 
boost that figure, the cancer organizations announced that they will send 
100,000 doctors a brochure that tells how to stop the habit.

Poland's premier presented Parliament with a bill that would normalize 
relations between the Communist state and the Roman Catholic Church and 
guarantee the church autonomy. Proclaiming the start of a "new era," Premier 
Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski introduced the measure in a speech to the 460-member 
Parliament. The legislation was agreed to by church negotiators earlier this 
month. Passage, expected next month, will clear the way to establishing 
diplomatic relations between the Polish government and the Vatican. The Vatican 
has for years refused to grant relations until the local church's status is 
resolved.

A grand jury returned the first two indictments in the Central Park attack on a 
28-year-old woman jogger, who remained in a coma for a seventh day, officials 
said. Details of the sealed indictments, including the exact charges, were not 
released. The two teen-agers had been arrested on charges of first-degree rape, 
second-degree attempted murder and first-degree assault. The grand jury 
reviewed confessions from some of the eight youths arrested in the rape and 
assault of the Wall Street investment banker, the source said. One of those 
indicted confessed to police that he hit the young woman with a pipe, court 
papers show. After she fell, he told police, he struck her again and another 
youth stripped off her shirt, the documents said. The other indicted teen-ager 
admitted fondling the woman's breasts, court documents say.

Players drove, flew, took the train and walked to the nearest Pennsylvania 
lottery ticket counter up to the last minute before the winning North American 
record jackpot of more than $100 million was drawn. The official winning 
numbers were 06; 16; 24; 34; 35; 37; 40; 41; 45; 60; 71. A winning ticket must 
have seven of the 11 numbers drawn. James Scroggins, the lottery's executive 
director, said the prize would be "something higher than $100 million when it's 
all said and done." How much higher won't be known until sometime today, but 
unofficial estimates have put the jackpot at more than $110 million.

Iran accused high-ranking officers and a senior Foreign Ministry official of 
being members of a U.S. espionage ring whose exposure was announced last week. 
IRNA, the Iranian news agency, said that Bahman Aqaei, Foreign Ministry expert 
on legal affairs, had been working for the CIA since 1983. It also named half a 
dozen other military officials as senior officers in the ring, which it said 
had passed information to Iraq during the Persian Gulf War. A White House 
spokesman has said that Washington is unaware of any such ring.

King Hussein of Jordan, addressing the nation in the wake of the price riots 
that forced his prime minister to resign, promised to speed up political reform 
but warned that there is no escaping the difficult days of economic austerity 
ahead. In an alternately angry and pleading tone, Hussein denounced last week's 
rioting -- in which at least nine people were killed and 100 injured -- as 
"sad, disgusting and shameful." Hussein promised that preparations will be 
speeded up for Jordan's first parliamentary elections in more than 20 years but 
did not set a date.

Six Arab officials gave their final approval to a proposal to send Arab 
cease-fire observers to Lebanon, but it was not clear whether Syria or the 
Lebanese would accept them. Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheik Sabah al Ahmed al 
Sabah, chairman of the Arab League mediation committee, told reporters in 
Tunisia that representatives of the other 15 Arab members will study the plan. 
It calls for a truce, the reopening of blockaded Lebanese ports and a force of 
200 to 300 Arab observers to monitor the truce.

Rioters have stabbed, stoned or clubbed to death at least 40 people and wounded 
nearly 700 in two days of attacks against Senegalese living in the Mauritanian 
capital of Nouakchott, hospital sources said. Troops were on patrol in the city 
and in Dakar, capital of neighboring Senegal, where Mauritanian traders and 
shops have been attacked. There was no reliable word on the number of 
casualties outside Nouakchott. Both governments appealed for calm and began 
repatriating victims who wanted to leave. The violence in the two countries on 
the edge of the Sahara was sparked by competing claims to farming areas on an 
island in the Senegal River, which forms the border between the two western 
Africa nations. The dispute flared into violence on April 9.

These are excerpts from the oral arguments before the Supreme Court in the 
Missouri abortion case: 
</P>
<P>
Privacy Rights 
</P>
<P>
 (From Charles Fried, representing the Justice Department.) 
</P>
<P>
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court. Today the United 
States asks this court to reconsider and overrule its decision in Roe vs. Wade. 
At the outset, I would like to make quite clear how limited that submission is. 
First, we are not asking the court to unravel the fabric of unenumerated and 
privacy rights which this court has woven in cases like Meyer and Pierce and 
Moore and Griswold. Rather, we are asking the court to pull this one thread. 
And the reason is well stated by this court in Harris and McRae; abortion is 
different. 
</P>
<P>
It involves the purposeful termination, as the court said, of potential life. 
And I would only add that in the minds of many legislators who pass abortion 
regulation, it is not merely potential life but actual human life. And though 
we do not believe that the 14th Amendment takes any position on that question, 
we think it is an utter non sequitur to say that, therefore, the organized 
community must also take no position in legislation and may not use such a 
position as a premise for regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy: Your position, Mr. Fried, then, is that Griswold 
vs. Connecticut is correct and should be retained? 
</P>
<P>
Fried: Exactly, Your Honor. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy: Is that because there is a fundamental right involved in that case? 
</P>
<P>
Fried: In Griswold against Connecticut, there was a right which was well 
established in a whole fabric of quite concrete matters, quite concrete. 
</P>
<P>
It involved not an abstraction such as the right to control one's body, an 
abstraction such as the right to be let alone, it involved quite concrete 
intrusions into the details of marital intimacy. And that was emphasized by the 
court and is a very important aspect of the court's decision. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy: Does the case stand for the proposition that there is a right to 
determine whether to procreate? 
</P>
<P>
Fried: Griswold surely does not stand for that proposition. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy: What is the right involved in Griswold? 
</P>
<P>
Fried: Beg your pardon? 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy: What is the right involved in Griswold? 
</P>
<P>
Fried: The right involved in Griswold, as the court clearly stated, was the 
right not to have the state intrude into, in a very violent way, into the 
details, inquire into the details of marital intimacy. There was a great deal 
of talk about inquiry into the marital bedroom and I think that is a very 
different story from what we have here. 
</P>
<P>
Procreation Issue 
</P>
<P>
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor: Do you say there is no fundamental right to decide 
whether to have a child or not? 
</P>
<P>
Fried: I think that that question . . . . 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor: A right to procreate? Do you deny that the Constitution protects that 
right? 
</P>
<P>
Fried: I would hesitate to formulate the right in such abstract terms and I 
think the court prior to Roe vs. Wade quite prudently also avoided such 
sweeping generalities. That was the wisdom of Griswold. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor: Do you think that the state has the right to, if in a future century 
we had a serious overpopulation problem, has a right to require women to have 
abortions after so many children? 
</P>
<P>
Fried: I surely do not. That would be quite a different matter. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor: What do you rest that on? 
</P>
<P>
Fried: Because, unlike abortion, which involves the purposeful termination of 
future life, that would involve not preventing an operation, but violently 
taking hands on, laying hands on a woman and submitting her to an operation and 
a whole constellation . . . . 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor: And you would rest that on substantive due process protection? 
</P>
<P>
Fried: Absolutely. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy: How do you define the liberty interests of the woman in that 
connection? 
</P>
<P>
Fried: The liberty interest against a seizure would be involved. That is how 
the court analyzed the matter in Griswold. That is how Justice Harland analyzed 
the matter in his dissent in Poe vs. Ullman, which is, in some sense, the root 
of this area of law. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy: How do you define the interest . . . the liberty interest of a woman 
in an abortion case? 
</P>
<P>
Fried: Well, I would think that there are liberty interests involved in terms 
perhaps of the contraceptive interest, but there is an interest at all points, 
however the interest of the woman is defined, at all points it is an interest 
which is matched by the state's interest in potential life. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy: I understand it is matched, but I want to know how you define it. 
</P>
<P>
Fried: I would define it in terms of the concrete impositions on the woman, 
which so offended the court in Griswold and which are not present in the Roe 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, I would like to make quite clear that in our view, if Roe were 
overruled, this court would have to continue to police the far outer boundaries 
of abortion regulation under a due process rational basis test and that that 
test is muscular enough, as Chief Justice Rehnquist said in his dissent in Roe, 
to strike down any regulation which did not make adequate provision . . . . 
</P>
<P>
I think the important thing to realize is that, when Roe was decided, it swept 
off the table regulations in the majority of American jurisdictions, including 
regulations recently promulgated by the American Law Institute, and declared a 
principle which said that it was unfair and unreasonable to regulate abortion 
in ways that most Western countries still do regulate abortion. 
</P>
<P>
We are not here today suggesting that the court would, therefore, allow extreme 
and extravagant and bloodthirsty regulations and that it would lack the power 
to strike those down if they were presented to it. But it is a mistake to think 
that alone, among government institutions . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Viability of Fetus 
</P>
<P>
 (From Frank Susman, a St. Louis lawyer representing those who successfully 
challenged the Missouri abortion law in lower courts.) 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court, I think the solicitor general's 
submission is somewhat disingenuous when he suggests to this court that he does 
not seek to unravel the whole cloth of procreational rights, but merely to pull 
a thread. It has always been my personal experience that, when I pull a thread, 
my sleeve falls off. There is no stopping. It is not a thread he is after. 
</P>
<P>
It is the full range of procreational rights and choices that constitute the 
fundamental right that has been recognized by this court. For better or for 
worse, there no longer exists any bright line between the fundamental right 
that was established in Griswold and the fundamental right of abortion that was 
established in Roe. These two rights, because of advances in medicine and 
science, now overlap. They coalesce and merge and they are not distinct. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Antonin Scalia: Excuse me, you find it hard to draw a line between 
those two but easy to draw a line between first, second and third trimester. 
</P>
<P>
Susman: I do not find it difficult . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Scalia: I don't see why a court that can draw that line can't separate abortion 
from birth control quite readily? 
</P>
<P>
Susman: If I may suggest the reasons in response to your question, Justice 
Scalia. The most common forms of what we generically in common parlance call 
contraception today, IUDs, low-dose birth control pills, which are the safest 
type of birth control pills available, act as abortifacients. They are 
correctly labeled as both. 
</P>
<P>
Under this statute, which defines fertilization as the point of beginning, 
those forms of contraception are also abortifacients. Science and medicine 
refers to them as both. We are not still dealing with the common barrier 
methods of Griswold. We are no longer just talking about condoms and 
diaphragms. 
</P>
<P>
Things have changed. The birth line, if there ever was one, has not been 
extinguished. That's why I suggest to this court that we need to deal with one 
right, the right to procreate. We are no longer talking about two rights. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy: Do you agree that the state can forbid abortions save to preserve the 
life of the mother after the fetus is, say, 8 months old? 
</P>
<P>
Susman: If I understand the question, Justice Kennedy, I think the health 
rights of the woman always are supreme at any stage of pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy: Suppose the health rights of the mother are not involved, the life or 
health of the mother are not involved, can the state prohibit an abortion after 
the fetus is 8 months old? 
</P>
<P>
Susman: Yes, I am willing to recognize the compelling interest granted in Roe 
of the state in potential fetal life after the point of viability. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy: But that is a line-drawing, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
Susman: Yes, it is. But that is a line that is more easily drawn. I think there 
are many cogent reasons for picking the point of viability, which is what we 
have today under Roe. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, historically, both at common law and in early statutes, this was 
always the line chosen. Whether it was called quickening or viability, there is 
little difference time-wise. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor: Well there is a difference, is there not, in those two? 
</P>
<P>
Susman: Technically, between those two definitions, Justice O'Connor, yes. 
Quickening had less of a medical significance. It was when the woman could 
first detect movement. 
</P>
<P>
Procreational interests are, indeed, implicit in the concept of ordered 
liberty, and neither liberty nor justice would exist without them. 
</P>
<P>
It is truly a liberty whose exercise is deeply rooted in this nation's history 
and tradition. I think it is somewhat ironic that the sole historical source 
cited by the solicitor general in his brief in an effort to dispute this fact 
is a work by Mr. James Moore, "Abortion in America." 
</P>
<P>
Thirty percent of pregnancies in this country today terminate in abortion. It 
is a high rate. It is a rate that sometimes astounds people, but it is a rate 
that has not changed one whit from the time the Constitution was enacted 
through the 1800s and through the 1900s. That has always been the rate. 
</P>
<P>
It is significantly less than the worldwide rate. Worldwide, 40% of all 
pregnancies terminate in abortion. Abortion today is the most common surgical 
procedure in the United States, with the possible exception of contraception. 
</P>
<P>
It remains today, as it was in the days of Roe, 17 times safer than childbirth, 
100 times safer than appendectomy, a safe procedure, minor surgery. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest that there can be no ordered liberty for women without control over 
their education, their employment, their health, their childbearing and their 
personal aspirations. There does, in fact, exist a deeply rooted tradition that 
the government steer clear of decisions affecting the bedroom, childbearing and 
the doctor-patient relationship as it pertains to these concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Tradition of Freedom 
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist: It is a deeply rooted tradition, but surely 
abortion was regulated by the states in the 19th Century and in the 20th 
Century? 
</P>
<P>
Susman: Yes, but I think it is necessary to go back and examine, as the 
historical brief does and other works, as to the reasons those regulations were 
enacted. Similarly, they were not done to protect the fetus. Those were not the 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
If you look for example . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Rehnquist: If you say there is a deeply rooted tradition of freedom in this 
area, that suggests that there had been no legislative intervention to me. What 
you are . . . that simply is not the fact. 
</P>
<P>
Scalia: Let me inquire -- I can see deriving a fundamental right from either a 
long tradition that this, the right to abort, has always been protected. I 
don't see that tradition. But I suppose you could also derive a fundamental 
right just simply from the text of the Constitution plus the logic of the 
matter, or whatever. 
</P>
<P>
How can you derive it that way here without making a determination as to 
whether the fetus is a human life or not? It is very hard to say it just is a 
matter of basic principle that it must be a fundamental right unless you make 
the determination that the organism that is destroyed is not a human life. Can 
you as a matter of logic or principle make that determination otherwise? 
</P>
<P>
Susman: I think the basic question . . . whether this is a human life or 
whether human life begins at conception, is not something that is verifiable as 
a fact. It is a question verifiable only by reliance upon faith. 
</P>
<P>
It is a question of labels. 
</P>
<P>
Neither side in this issue and debate would ever disagree on the physiological 
facts. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides would agree as to when a heartbeat can first be detected. Both sides 
would agree as to when brain waves can first be detected. 
</P>
<P>
But when you come to try to place the emotional labels on what you call that 
collection of physiological facts, that is where people part company.

Rain fell Wednesday in parts of Bangladesh after people across the country 
prayed for an end to a drought that threatens to destroy almost 50% of the rice 
crop. 
</P>
<P>
Hours after the prayers by more than 75,000 Muslims, led by President Hussain 
Mohammed Ershad, light rain fell in the capital of Dhaka and three other 
districts, the weather bureau said. 
</P>
<P>
But forecasters say there will probably be no respite from the drought for 
another two weeks, and a hot spell will aggravate the situation in the coming 
days.

Sale of U.S. Shoe Collapses: U.S. Shoe Corp. said a $422.5-million deal to sell 
its footwear division to an investment group headed by Merrill Lynch Capital 
Partners Inc. has fallen through. The company said Merrill Lynch advised it 
that certain conditions of the agreement have not been met and that it did not 
intend to buy the unit on originally specified terms. It did not elaborate. The 
company, a footwear, clothing and eye-care company whose brand-name shoes 
include Calvin Klein and Capezio, agreed in February to the buyout, which 
included the sale of its name and headquarters as part of a restructuring 
designed to head off a possible hostile takeover bid.

EVERYBODY LOVED LUCY; 
</P>
<P>
LUCILLE BALL MADE IT ALL LOOK SPONTANEOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lucille Ball, whose death Wednesday morning at the age of 77 will be the most 
widely and deeply felt show-business loss in recent memory, was the movies' 
greatest gift to television. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out to be one of Sam Goldwyn's finest and most prophetic hours when 
he signed her as one of his Goldwyn Girls to appear in "Roman Scandals" with 
Eddie Cantor in 1933. She had had bit parts in two earlier films but "Roman 
Scandals" was the one that gave her a firmer foothold on the slippery slopes of 
a Hollywood career. 
</P>
<P>
The movies prepared her for television. She perfected her matchless craft as a 
comedienne in dozens of films, including three of Fred Astaire's and one of the 
Marx Brothers ("Room Service"). 
</P>
<P>
A lot of the other films caused few ripples on the wide surface of film 
history. But in those years Lucy was refining her enduring, endearing public 
image as a perky, saucy woman who was likelier (at least in the early days) to 
end up with the hero's funny pal than with the hero himself. 
</P>
<P>
Yet as often happened with supporting performers, her verve, an engagingly 
sharp tongue and a rather salty view of the world made her more interesting 
than the square-cut principals, and led to leading roles. 
</P>
<P>
To look at the "I Love Lucy" reruns today, as everybody does, again and again, 
is to realize how superbly professional they are. Today many sitcoms still use 
the three-camera technique, shooting in front of live audiences, that Desi 
Arnaz pioneered. 
</P>
<P>
The idea now seems as inevitable as the wheel or pre-sliced muffins, and yet 
you wonder if it would have worked nearly as well or caught on at all without 
Lucy's sheer expertise as a physical as well as a verbal comedienne. 
</P>
<P>
She made it all -- even the wildest, craziest capers -- look as if it were 
happening now -- spontaneous, unrehearsed, accidental, the inevitable 
consequences of the screen Lucy's scatterbrained and lovable personality. Her 
foils -- Desi himself, Vivian Vance and William Frawley -- were superb farceurs 
themselves, but Lucy was the dynamo that made it all work. 
</P>
<P>
The craft was invisible, the skills so perfected they concealed themselves 
totally. It was a brilliant illusion, generating a charm that hid the hard work 
and the artful writing and editing as well as the performing. 
</P>
<P>
The result was probably the finest and certainly the most durable single series 
in television's history thus far. The appeal of the Lucy shows was also the 
most universal that American television has yet provided. 
</P>
<P>
They were wholly, prototypically American, and that is central to their 
popularity abroad. Yet they have been embraced as the kind of middle-class 
goings-on that might possibly arise almost anywhere there is a middle class. 
Lucy was all-American but, equally, a citizen of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Her successful career in films, in which she ultimately earned star billing if 
not superstar status, gave her an invaluable identification when "I Love Lucy" 
began. The irony is that, created by the movies, she was to achieve fame and 
fortune in television on a scale that had eluded her in the movies. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, when Lucy began to commandeer our hearts on "I Love Lucy" in 1951, the 
movies were already in considerable trouble, their audiences staying home in 
large numbers to watch the likes of Lucy in their living rooms. As always, her 
timing was impeccable. 
</P>
<P>
Lucille Ball was not Lucy, of course. She had come a hard road from Jamestown, 
N.Y., in a line of work in which you did not survive by being scatterbrained. 
She was smart, hard-working and a perfectionist who knew that whatever else it 
was, comedy was not accidental. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, the cameras, television or film, have X-ray properties, and the 
millions who saw and loved her were not wrong to think they perceived a 
generous and loving woman, as well as a glorious clown who knew the world was 
better off laughing.

 CULINARY SOS: A TASTY LOW-FAT, LOW-CHOLESTEROL PANCAKE 
</P>

DEAR SOS: Recently I visited Fess Parker's Red Lion Inn in Santa Barbara. They 
have a few low-cholesterol, low-fat items, including a fantastic gingerbread 
pancake with apple butter. But I can't find such a recipe in my cookbooks. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
DEAR ROSALIE: Looks are not great, but the ginger-flavored pancakes do taste 
good. Douse them with apple butter, maple syrup or whatever, and you have it. 
</P>
<P>

BACK TO BASICS: CUPS, SPOONS: MEASURING TOOLS OF THE TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yes, we all know great cooks who never measure an ingredient and everything 
they make comes out perfect. Most of us, however, would be courting disaster if 
we started throwing in a pinch of this and a handful of that. Precise 
measurements not only assure consistent results, they sometimes can make the 
difference between the success or failure of a recipe. 
</P>
<P>
We're limiting this discussion to the tools most commonly used to measure 
ingredients in recipes developed for American consumers. Although the metric 
system of measuring by weight is recognized as being more accurate, volumetric 
measures are still the most commonly used in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Liquid Measuring Cups: 
</P>
<P>
Liquids should be measured in standardized glass or clear plastic cups. Most 
glass measuring cups are heat-proof and can be used safely with boiling liquids 
or near hot surfaces. You need to be a little more careful regarding heat when 
using plastic varieties, although they are less likely to break. 
</P>
<P>
The handles and spouts on these cups aid in pouring; a little extra space at 
the top of the cups prevents spillage. Most liquid measuring cups are now 
marked with both English and metric units. The most common sizes have one-, 
two- and four-cup capacities. 
</P>
<P>
To measure accurately using liquid measures, place the cup on a level surface 
and with your eyes level with the markings, add the amount of ingredient 
needed. Bend over if necessary rather than lifting the cup to your eye level. 
</P>
<P>
Dry Measuring Cups: 
</P>
<P>
The cups used for measuring dry ingredients usually come in graduated sets of 
four: 1/4, 1/3, 1/2 and 1 cup, although 1/8, 3/4 and two-cup measures are 
available. Generally, the cups are made of aluminum, stainless steel or 
plastic. 
</P>
<P>
A future Back to Basics column will show the techniques used to accurately 
spoon or pack ingredients into a dry measuring cup, then level them even with 
the rim. By using the exact size of dry measuring cup called for in a recipe, 
you can assure success. 
</P>
<P>
Measuring Spoons: 
</P>
<P>
Smaller amounts of both liquid and dry ingredients are measured using 
standardized measuring spoons. Fill spoons to the rim with liquids; level off 
dry ingredients to ensure accuracy. Dense ingredients need to be packed into 
the spoons to eliminate air pockets. 
</P>
<P>
The spoons typically come in sets of four: 1/4, 1/2 and one teaspoon and one 
tablespoon. Some sets, however, include a 1/8 teaspoon and a 1/2 tablespoon. 
</P>
<P>
Aluminum, stainless steel and plastic are again the most common materials from 
which these tools are made. Shapes vary, but it's easier to scrape out 
ingredients from the round and oval varieties than the square or rectangular. 
Often the spoons are held together with a ring.

GREAT TASTE OF NUTMEG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNNY WILLET, Southam News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nutmeg is exotic stuff. 
</P>
<P>
You can put it in soup. You can put it in stew. And it's wonderful on spaghetti 
or fettuccine. 
</P>
<P>
You can put nutmeg almost anywhere, except behind your ears, and you wouldn't 
be doing anything someone hasn't already tried and made popular in another 
culture or style of cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
East Indians use it to season meat. Italians love nutmeg sprinkled on cooked 
spinach. Germans add it to sausage and Scots grate a little into their 
ceremonial haggis. Even the British like a hint in their steak and kidney pie. 
</P>
<P>
It would seem that many of us, who instinctively use it exclusively in eggnog 
or spice cake and other baked goods, are beginning to discover the magic of 
nutmeg in savory dishes as well. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, I wouldn't have recognized nutmeg if it weren't ground and 
bottled in a little jar, with a nutmeg label on the front. But one whiff of 
warm, sweet, spicy nutmeg (freshly grated) and the ground stuff, will 
eventually work its way to the back of the cupboard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Finger-Protective Piece 
</P>
<P>
Although it comes all the way from the moist climate of the tropics, whole, 
dried nutmegs are readily available in most supermarkets. And if you watch out 
for your knuckles, the nut-like seeds can be grated on a cheese grater. 
</P>
<P>
There are a number of various types of specific nutmeg graters to be had. Some 
work like a pepper mill and others have a little storage compartment and a 
finger-protective piece that helps push the nutmeg over the grater. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the price, though, it is definitely worth investigating the 
different kinds, to determine which suits you best.

SATICOY APPROACHES CROSSROADS TO FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERRY BRAILO SPENCER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the chemical fire that forced an overnight evacuation of Saticoy 
earlier this month, some residents say they prefer a new county plan calling 
for more industry in the unincorporated area to one that could virtually double 
its population. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is the possible rezoning this summer of about 160 acres -- vacant land 
that county planners are considering either for low- to moderate-cost housing 
or for industrial installations. 
</P>
<P>
"No more people," said Jose Flores, a longtime resident known in the 
tight-knit, predominantly Hispanic community as "Mr. Saticoy." "Make it an 
industrial park, but with no chemicals." 
</P>
<P>
Some critics fear the addition of more homes will lead to the annexation of 
Saticoy by neighboring Ventura, because only Ventura can provide the sewer 
system needed to accommodate further residential development in Saticoy. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Ybarra, the owner of a tire store and president of the 80-member Saticoy 
Town Council, a business group, said the county's general plan update is a way 
of "preparing a recipe for takeover by Ventura. . . . The county has 
technically created a blighted area. We have potholes, dogs running around in 
packs, signs gone, and all the county does is speak barbarian to us." 
</P>
<P>
Others claim the community would be engulfed by new apartments, losing its 
agricultural character and small-town feeling. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not against low-cost housing," said Raul Morales, a 54-year resident who 
can recall when "half of Saticoy was related to me by blood and another third 
by marriage." 
</P>
<P>
"But if you put in 1,000 units," he said, "you wouldn't satisfy the need. The 
next day, they would be occupied and then they would have to build more." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, county officials began hearings on the environmental impact report 
for the Saticoy Area Plan. That plan was prepared in response to the state's 
$18-million realignment and widening of California 118, also known as Los 
Angeles Avenue, which now sends 21,000 cars a day zig-zagging through Saticoy's 
downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1,254 New Residents 
</P>
<P>
One possibility raised by planners is to use the area primarily for heavy 
industry. Another is to approve housing for as many as 1,254 new residents. 
Saticoy has about 1,500 people, but the population swells as farm workers come 
to town for lemon and strawberry harvests. 
</P>
<P>
Saticoy was the site of the last action of the Mexican War in California, an 
inconclusive skirmish on Jan. 6, 1847, between soldiers led by Gen. John C. 
Fremont and Don Jose Carrillo. 
</P>
<P>
It came into its own in 1887, when the Southern Pacific railroad built a depot 
in town. Growers from all over western Ventura County hauled lima beans, 
walnuts, grains, apricots and citrus to the bustling settlement, which boasted 
a saloon, its own post office and three churches. 
</P>
<P>
But Ventura, with its own railroad depot and a commercial wharf, overshadowed 
it. Saticoy faded, achieving recognition only at times like Jan. 15, 1945, when 
a Japanese bomb carried aloft in a large paper balloon drifted inland and 
exploded nearby on the bed of the Santa Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
Today, middle-class residents live in spacious homes near the green, rolling 
hills of Saticoy Regional Golf Course, and poorer, predominantly Latino 
residents live in lower Saticoy. 
</P>
<P>
Industrial buildings surround their small, crowded homes -- a mix that includes 
immaculately kept frame cottages as well as oddities like a stuccoed Quonset 
hut. On one residential street, an endless line of fruit-laden trucks waits to 
unload at a citrus packing house. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Amenities 
</P>
<P>
The community amenities are few -- a small park, a cramped library and 
community center and an elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
But there is increasing demand for the area's limited services. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more people here at harvest time," said Morales, who oversees 
Saticoy's park and community center. "In years past, you would see a family of 
five or six in a house, but now people come here with their uncles, aunts, 
brothers, cousins. I don't see how they live in those homes." 
</P>
<P>
Congestion awaits them outside. Massive rush-hour bottlenecks are the norm on 
the main drag, California 118, which is lined with fruit stands, restaurants, 
auto accessory shops and Saticoy Hardware, an outlet for anomalies like a $99 
galvanized steel washing tub with wringer, flour-sack tea towels and enormous 
cast-iron kettles. 
</P>
<P>
The road is to be widened to four lanes by 1993, and is to skirt downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Some merchants are concerned about the realignment of the highway, which will 
put them out of the flow of traffic. But they say they are more concerned about 
the prospect of annexation by Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Ybarra said he feared Ventura's building and safety enforcement policies would 
displace many people from their homes and shut some businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not against progress," he said, "but we don't want to see outside people 
come in and take over." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gloomy Scenario 
</P>
<P>
Ybarra spun a gloomy scenario in which residents unable to afford the repairs 
demanded by Ventura would have to sell their homes to developers, who would 
raze them and erect expensive subdivisions. 
</P>
<P>
Buster Davis, whose business, Buster's Original Bar-B-Q and Bakery, will be 
bought out by the state because it lies in the path of the highway widening 
project, said annexation would be a blessing. 
</P>
<P>
"I've lived in Saticoy all my life. I'm not against the changes . . . it's an 
inevitable thing. It has to happen for us to get some improvements here." 
</P>
<P>
County officials acknowledge that Ventura might more frequently scrutinize 
illegal additions on houses and industrial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"We're more stringent than Ventura," said Bill Windroth, a county building 
official, "but we don't have as many building inspectors." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Offerman, the county planner in charge of the Saticoy plan update, 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"The county doesn't have the resources to go and search out code violations," 
he said. "Ventura is much better equipped to do that." 
</P>
<P>
However, Ventura officials say there are no plans to annex Saticoy. 
</P>
<P>
The Local Agency Formation Commission, the state agency that oversees the 
annexation process, has received no application, said Director Bob Braitman. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, annexation requires the consent of the Saticoy property 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Supervisor Susan Lacey said no action would be taken to force 
Saticoy into Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"My greatest desire is that the folks in Saticoy are allowed the greatest 
self-determination," she said. "We don't want to take any of the housing out. 
It's one of the few places people can sort of afford to live."

FACTIONS SQUARE OFF IN FEUD OVER PLANS FOR NEW COUNTY JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite Ventura County Supervisor John Flynn's attempts to rally support for 
building a new jail at the Government Center, all four of his board colleagues 
say they lean toward building the jail in a rural area that would allow for 
future expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Their sentiments spell an uphill fight for Flynn, who needs backing by three of 
the five board members to move forward. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think John's got the votes on the board to do this," said Supervisor 
Jim Dougherty, echoing the sentiments of other board members. "We have to put 
in a facility that can be added on to later, and to not plan for that is not 
facing up to reality." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Flynn's plan is headed for problems in the environmental review 
process, said a county official familiar with the jail project. 
</P>
<P>
"Traffic would be a very, very big . . . concern environmentally. There are 
serious concerns with constructing the jail at the Government Center at this 
time," said Dave Robertson, a county senior administrative analyst. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn, who has held two news conferences in three weeks to publicize his plan, 
said his proposal meets minimum state jail requirements by using available 
funds. He criticized Sheriff John Gillespie's plan as providing "luxuries" and 
said ferrying inmates to and from a remote rural jail for hearings would also 
add to traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn added that the "man on the street" supports him, even if the bureaucrats 
do not. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had 50 calls in support of my plan," Flynn said, adding of his detractors 
that "I think I've got the whole group on the run." 
</P>
<P>
Dougherty said those supporters probably do not include residents near the East 
Valley sheriff's station outside Thousand Oaks, where Flynn wants to add 50 
beds. 
</P>
<P>
"I know those people and they would go sky-high if you tried to put 50 beds out 
there," Dougherty said. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn hopes for a groundswell of public backing and has called for a meeting 
with the sheriff to discuss their respective plans. He also said at Tuesday's 
board meeting that he looks forward to airing his views at public hearings 
before the board's vote. 
</P>
<P>
Beset by jail overcrowding and a growing inmate population, Ventura County 
needs a new jail. The county must pick a site and start construction by fall, 
1990, to qualify for state bond monies. Five locations are under environmental 
review, including Todd Road between Ventura and Santa Paula off California 126, 
two locations off Pleasant Valley Road, an area near Rancho Sespe and the 
county Government Center in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
400-Cell Facility 
</P>
<P>
In the past several months, Flynn has emerged as a determined champion of 
building a 400-cell jail at the Government Center and expanding county 
facilities at the Honor Farm in Ojai, the East Valley sheriff's station and a 
work furlough program at Rose Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn bases his proposal on figures he extrapolated from a state-of-the-art, 
multistory jail in Sacramento built for 1,200 inmates. Gillespie, in a news 
conference last week, lambasted Flynn's figures, calling them deliberately 
skewed. He called the calculations "an irresponsible example of misleading, 
incomplete information based upon incorrect assumptions." 
</P>
<P>
In a news conference Monday, Flynn discussed his figures in more detail but 
failed to sway the sheriff. Gillespie maintains that Flynn's proposal does not 
provide enough room and would cost double the $25 million that Flynn has 
estimated. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie and several supervisors say they are disconcerted that Flynn is 
waging his campaign in the media instead of coming to them. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the sort of thing we normally do not do in Ventura," said Supervisor 
Susan Lacey, adding that she did not believe that Flynn had garnered any 
support for his plan. "I didn't know he'd had a press conference -- the first 
big one -- and I felt uncomfortable answering questions when I hadn't seen the 
proposal." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Favors Campus Style 
</P>
<P>
Lacey said she favors Gillespie's plan over Flynn's. "The sheriff and deputies 
are very much in favor of a campus-style jail. Based on the conversations I've 
had, I tend to support that." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer said she supports the sheriff's plan because it 
allocates money and space for an extensive inmate job-training program that 
would eventually create products, and thus revenue, to partially offset the 
cost of incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a choice of building a warehouse or a facility that provides a 
revenue-generator," Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn, in rebuttal, has said corrections industries are inefficient and 
notorious for their steep costs. 
</P>
<P>
"Factories run by government don't work," he said. Instead, Flynn favors having 
inmates provide labor to public works programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cost Concerns 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Maggie Erickson, who said she is leaning toward the sheriff's plan 
but reserving final judgment of Flynn's plan, said, "There are a lot of people 
who are saying to us if you can build it cheaper at the Government Center, you 
should do it there." 
</P>
<P>
She expressed concern over whether prisoners would have enough room, despite 
Flynn's calculation that his plan would more than meet minimum state 
requirements of 105 square feet of space per prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
Like the other supervisors, Erickson expressed irritation at Flynn's methods of 
promoting his proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it serves the people of Ventura to have the sheriff and one 
member of the board debating something the entire board should decide," 
Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the issues that have been raised in recent weeks include: 
</P>
<P>
Expanding Rose Valley: The sheriff's office is expected to open a 160-person 
work furlough program within several weeks at this Ojai site. Flynn claims that 
Rose Valley can be expanded to accommodate another 150 inmates; the sheriff's 
office says it cannot. 
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service, which owns the land and 
leases it to the county, environmental considerations ranging from waste 
disposal to traffic to water prohibit expanding the facilities at Rose Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn disagrees with this assessment, saying he plans to enlist the support of 
state legislators and top U.S. Forest Service policy-makers for his proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Inmates sentenced to work furlough pay room and board to live at special 
correctional facilities but are allowed to maintain their regular jobs. After 
their workday, they must immediately report back to the work furlough site. 
</P>
<P>
* Separate facilities: Some county officials say jails must segregate pretrial 
and sentenced inmates in separate facilities in order to qualify for state jail 
bond money. They criticize Flynn's plan, saying it doesn't do that. 
</P>
<P>
But according to the state Board of Corrections, such segregation is not 
necessary, provided that counties separate inmates according to the severity of 
their crimes. 
</P>
<P>
* Operating costs: State officials and private jail consultants say multistory 
jails, such as the one proposed by Flynn, usually cost more to build than 
campus-style jails, like the one proposed by Gillespie. However, there are no 
known studies indicating whether vertical or campus-style jails cost more to 
run, according to Fred Campbell, a consultant with the Criminal Justice 
Research Foundation, a nonprofit research group in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The state Board of Corrections is conducting such a study, according to 
spokeswoman Karen Rosa. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TWO SIDES OF THE JAIL CONFLICT 
</P>
<P>
PLAN 
</P>
<P>
Sherriff John Gillespie: A 768-bed campus-style jail on about 100 acres in a 
rural area. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor John Flynn: A 400-bed three-story jail on land now used for parking 
at the County Government Center. The parking lot would be replaced by a 
1,000-car garage. 
</P>
<P>
Additional inmate space would be provided by 150 extra beds at Rose Valley Work 
Furlough program; 100 beds at the Honor Farm near Ojai and 50 beds at the East 
Valley sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
Plan also calls for alternative forms of incarceration, such as "electronic 
handcuffs," and expanding work-furlough programs. 
</P>
<P>
EXPANSION 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie: Up to 2,000 beds, which would meet jail needs for 10 to 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn: Plan meets current needs with available funding. Add to other sites as 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
COST 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie: $65 to $70 million. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn: $25 million, including $6 million for parking structure. 
</P>
<P>
AREA 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie: 504 square feet per inmate. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn: 139 square feet per inmate. 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie: $30 million in state jail bonds, $10 million in earmarked state 
funds, plus revenue from prisoners' work, a possible half-cent sales tax, or 
general obligation bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn: $19 million in state jail bonds, $6 million for parking structure from 
other sources. JOB SKILLS TRAINING 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie: A variety of programs, including possible computer training and auto 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn: No proposed plans. Inmates would clean beaches, do flood-control work 
and similar jobs. 
</P>
<P>
REASONS 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie: A campus-style jail is cheaper to operate in the long run because it 
requires less staff than a multistory jail. Putting all new jail operations 
under one roof makes more economic sense than spreading it out over four sites. 
This plan offers room for expansion and a rehabilitation and training program 
that aims at reducing recidivism. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn: A new jail at the County Government Center would meet current minimum 
requirements with money available today. It would reduce traffic and save staff 
time used in transporting prisoners to and from court. It is cheaper than 
Gillespie's plan; multistory jails are not more costly to operate than 
single-level jails. It would save taxpayers money they'd otherwise spend on 
jail work-training programs, which he claims are ineffective.

CITY'S DONATIONS TO AID HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura City Council this week breathed new life into plans by two 
nonprofit agencies to provide shelter for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
In a unanimous vote Monday, the council gave $200,000 toward Project 
Understanding's beleaguered proposal to convert an old Ventura Avenue apartment 
building into a shelter for homeless families. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the council gave another $200,000 to help expand the 
financially troubled Zoe Christian Center in Oxnard, the only permanent 
emergency shelter for Ventura County's estimated 2,000 to 4,000 homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"The city of Ventura, by doing this, will hopefully be an example to the rest 
of the communities in the county," Councilman John Sullard said. "It's all of 
our problems." 
</P>
<P>
The grants culminated several months of speculation over who would receive 
money from the city, which last fall offered to help fund proposals aimed at 
helping homeless families. 
</P>
<P>
The most controversial of the proposals was the $1.7-million plan by Project 
Understanding to relocate 14 families living in the De Anza Hotel on Ventura 
Avenue and convert the building into an 84-bed shelter serving 21 families. 
</P>
<P>
News of the project last month sparked the ire of the dozens of low-income 
tenants, some of whom had once been homeless themselves, as well as nearby 
merchants who complained that such a facility would scare away customers. 
</P>
<P>
Project Understanding officials themselves began to grow angry as they watched 
deadlines for several federal grants slip away while they waited for the city 
to commit to the project. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, frustrated by the costly and time-consuming process, Project 
Understanding's executive director, Pat Driskell, sent a letter to the council 
March 29 withdrawing the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Out of Our League' 
</P>
<P>
"We were out of our league when we chose to respond" to the city's request for 
proposals, the letter stated. "And the league we were invited to enter is not 
one we choose to join." 
</P>
<P>
Driskell, however, said he changed his mind in subsequent weeks at the urging 
of city officials and the Cabrillo Economic Development Corp., the 
Saticoy-based low-cost housing developer that agreed to be a partner in the 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
"Our decision to withdraw was naive and premature," Driskell said. "It was a 
mistake, plain and simple." 
</P>
<P>
He said the city grant would allow his group, which has been serving the 
county's poor for more than a decade, to still apply for matching funds under a 
state program. The County Board of Supervisors gave the group another $74,000 
on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was costly and unfortunate to have the delay, but all was not lost," said 
Driskell, adding that residents would be notified within six months about 
relocation. Project Understanding and Cabrillo have offered to pay about $4,800 
in relocation compensation per apartment, a sum they say would be sufficient to 
land the tenants in at least equal, if not much improved, living quarters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Additional Beds 
</P>
<P>
Council members said they favored the Project Understanding and Zoe proposals 
over other competitors because the two groups are already providing services to 
the homeless and would be able to quickly translate the $200,000 grants into 
additional beds. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, debate at the Monday meeting focused not on the Project Understanding 
shelter, but the wisdom of granting money to the Zoe shelter in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Richard Francis, despite voting in favor of the grants, said he was 
uncomfortable giving scarce funds to a project in another city. In addition, he 
said, the grant to Zoe "smacks of a bus-ticket mentality . . . that we will 
just send our homeless to Oxnard and let them live there." 
</P>
<P>
But Councilwoman Nan Drake defended a regional approach. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing we tried to do was not be so parochial," she said. "We know the 
needs of Ventura . . . but we were trying to reach a little further than that." 
</P>
<P>
Zoe on Tuesday also received $8,800 from the Oxnard City Council to make two 
months of back rent payments. Council members turned down a request for an 
additional $11,200 to help with operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said they would consider a loan for that sum if shelter 
officials resubmitted an application that detailed their plans for the money. 
</P>
<P>
"We just can't say, 'Yeah, here it is,' without knowing what it's going to be 
used for," Mayor Nao Takasugi said.

SANTA TERESITA DECIDES TO KEEP FULL EMERGENCY ROOM SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The emergency room at Santa Teresita Hospital will remain open to all patients, 
its board of directors decided this week. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital had warned it might stop accepting patients brought to the 
emergency room in ambulances unless state and county officials approved a plan 
to convert 23 hospital beds to more profitable use in an affiliated nursing 
home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expect Acceptance 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials are now convinced that the plan will be accepted by all the 
licensing agencies. Approval has been received from one county and one state 
agency. That will allow Santa Teresita to begin making necessary changes, 
including construction of four restrooms and a dining room in the nursing home 
next to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Once the additions are completed, final approval must be received from the 
county Health Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
The 283-bed hospital proposed the bed conversion plan last year to help 
subsidize its financially ailing emergency room, said Executive Vice President 
Mike Costello. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Santa Teresita lost $400,000 in operating costs for the emergency 
facility, which receives 1,000 patients a month from eight cities. Losses 
climbed to $600,000 last year. The losses were blamed on an increase in 
patients without insurance, insufficient reimbursement from state insurance 
programs for the poor and rising costs. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital never planned to totally close its emergency room. Walk-in 
patients or those arriving by ambulances without paramedics on board would have 
been admitted. 
</P>
<P>
After "a long bureaucratic stalemate," Costello said the Los Angeles Office of 
Statewide Health Planning and Development has approved architectural changes 
required by the county Health Services Department. The health services 
department has also approved the plan, but will not decide whether to issue a 
license until after the additions are made. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unusually Long Wait 
</P>
<P>
County officials had said that it is unusual to take so long to act on this 
kind of application, which was made in August. Robert Carp, program manager of 
acute ancillary services for the health services department, said he did not 
know the reason for the delay. 
</P>
<P>
The 23 hospital beds have not been used recently because of a lack of 
personnel. Costello said the beds can be used in the nursing home because that 
facility is not required to be as intensively staffed. 
</P>
<P>
If the license is granted, the nursing home will have 156 beds. The additional 
23 beds would raise an estimated $800,000 a year, which could be used to offset 
emergency room losses, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Costello said a community task force formed in February to save the emergency 
room had helped to speed up the application process by contacting state and 
county officials. The group included representatives from the hospital, county 
Supervisor Pete Schabarum, state Sen. Newton Russell (R-Glendale), Assemblyman 
Richard Mountjoy (R-Arcadia), and city officials from Duarte, Monrovia and 
Bradbury.

PLANNING PANEL SEAT FILLED

<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Juarez, son-in-law of Councilwoman Barbara Messina, was appointed to the 
Planning Commission Monday night by Councilman Talmage Burke. 
</P>
<P>
Juarez, a 28-year-old attorney, will begin serving on the nine-member 
commission next week after he takes the oath of office. 
</P>
<P>
There are no rules prohibiting relatives of council members from serving on 
city commissions or committees, City Clerk Francis Moore said. Messina said she 
did not ask Burke to appoint Juarez. 
</P>
<P>
"I just liked his background," Burke said. He said Juarez's application stood 
out from others because of his record of community involvement. Burke also 
pointed out Juarez's experience as a manager of local softball teams. 
</P>
<P>
"That's getting in there and working with young people," Burke said. He added 
that Juarez, who is fluent in Spanish, will be an asset in a community where 
30% of the residents are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
In another announcement Monday, Burke appointed Paul Talbot to the Parks and 
Recreation Commission. Talbot, 27, is a co-owner of two Wendy's Old Fashion 
Hamburgers restaurants in the city.

George Ristic, a former Planning Commission member and an unsuccessful 
candidate for the City Council last year, has resigned from the city Personnel 
Board because he is moving from Monterey Park, his home for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Ristic, known as a prolific writer of letters to the editors of local 
newspapers, cited personal reasons for selling his house and moving temporarily 
to Pasadena. Eventually, he said, he plans to build a house in Apple Valley and 
settle there. 
</P>
<P>
A retired school administrator, Ristic often voiced the concerns of longtime 
residents who were disturbed by the rapid changes wrought by immigration in the 
last decade.

Friday will be John Hemer's last day as director of Housing and Economic 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
Hemer, 44, said he is leaving to become director of real estate for the Los 
Angeles Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
"The opportunity came up," Hemer said. "In Baldwin Park I had completed all the 
goals I had set when I came here. 
</P>
<P>
He said during his 7 1/2 years, he has helped add 400 apartments and 
condominiums and more than 1 million square feet of retail and industrial 
space. 
</P>
<P>
At the Los Angeles Redevelopment Agency, Hemer will oversee a staff of 30, more 
than double the number he has been supervising. He will specialize in land 
appraisals, acquisitions and sales. 
</P>
<P>
Hemer, who handled redevelopment projects for Inglewood and Santa Monica before 
coming to Baldwin Park in 1981, said he is proud of his role in completing the 
city's Puente-Merced project, which features a Vons supermarket and Hilton 
hotel.

CHAMBER HONORS EX-MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Mayor Larry Straight moved to Northern California in December, but his 
ties to the city are as strong as ever. 
</P>
<P>
Last week Straight was back in town -- for the third time in four months -- to 
receive the Chamber of Commerce's Citizen of the Year award. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a thrill," Straight said. "It never occurred to me that it would happen. 
When somebody starts to be committed to a community, you don't do it with the 
intent of getting an award." 
</P>
<P>
Straight, 66, and his wife moved to Lake of the Pines east of Sacramento to be 
closer to their children and grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Straight was an active community volunteer and city official for 32 years. He 
served on the City Council from 1984 to 1988, the last two years as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the Covina Host Lions Club since 1958, Straight was nominated for 
the award by the South Hills Kiwanis Club. He retired as assistant 
superintendent of the Covina Valley Unified School District in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"He probably epitomizes the volunteer spirit," said Randy Gordon, executive 
director of the Covina Chamber of Commerce. "He is an extremely popular 
individual in this community." 
</P>
<P>
An avid golfer and multitalented musician, Straight said he has been spending 
plenty of time at a golf course near his new home. He also returned to Covina 
two other times this year to play with his dance band, the California Sound. 
Straight has turned the band over to friends but plans to start another group 
at Lake of the Pines. 
</P>
<P>
Straight, who is still a member of the Lions Club here, plans to be back in the 
city this summer for the club's annual Fourth of July celebration at Covina 
Park. "I haven't missed it since 1957," he said.

WORK PARTY GIVES STATE PARK A SPRING CLEANING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Hotel, a 55-year-old ex-track coach who last Saturday ran 24 miles to the 
top of Mt. Wilson, spent several hours Sunday swinging a pickax, helping to cut 
a new trail through Point Mugu State Park in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
"I stretched out real good before I came here," the Manhattan Beach resident 
said, with sweat rolling down his nose. "Besides, I'm not using my legs, just 
my upper body." 
</P>
<P>
Pam Maine, 29, an executive secretary and mountain bike enthusiast who wanted 
to improve the image of bicyclists as well as the trails, also swung an ax 
during the eighth annual "Trail Days" working party. 
</P>
<P>
"Mountain bikers are supposedly folks who rip up trails," said Maine, a 
Woodland Hills resident who is training to compete in national off-road bike 
events. "We're doing our thing for the cause of mountain bikers, so the Sierra 
Club won't look upon us so badly." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bikers and Hikers 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a dozen mountain bikers worked side-by-side with about 30 hikers last 
weekend during the two-day spring cleanup event, sponsored by the Sierra Club, 
the state Department of Parks and Recreation and the mountains' Trail Council. 
</P>
<P>
Although bikers are restricted to fire roads and not allowed to use the park's 
trails, several said they hope someday their efforts will pay off with greater 
access. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to work with other user groups to show we're not just a bunch of 
young kamikazes," said biker Peter Heuman, 33, of Woodland Hills as he dug 
rocks and roots out of a trail in Sycamore Canyon. "We're trying to give 
something back to the mountains, as well as to use them." 
</P>
<P>
Point Mugu, popular among bikers and horse riders as well as hikers, is an area 
near the western edge of the Santa Monica Mountains in Ventura and Los Angeles 
counties. It can be reached from Thousand Oaks to the north or from the Pacific 
Coast Highway on the south. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Short Section 
</P>
<P>
The weekend working party concentrated on a 1 1/2-mile section of the 55-mile 
Backbone Trail that runs from the Pacific Ocean near Point Mugu up to the spine 
of the mountains and down to end at Will Rogers State Park. In the area where 
most of the crew worked Sunday beneath a startling blue sky, the air was 
pungent with sage. Sharp-spined yucca guarded the hillsides and golden yarrow 
and elderberry provided splashes of color. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Deese, a state park ranger, said the turnout for the weekend event was 
smaller than expected. But, he said, "everybody that's been here really worked, 
so we got almost as much done." 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club's Ron Webster, who has been building trails in the Santa 
Monicas for 17 years, said half a mile of trail was pioneered last weekend. 
Other crews were to return to smooth and widen it. Volunteers also helped 
remove obsolete fencing and cut brush and branches encroaching on the trail. 
</P>
<P>
"We were able to get a lot of work done that wouldn't get done in the course of 
normal park work," Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sore Muscles 
</P>
<P>
The price of the hard work, however, was paid in sore muscles and bandaged 
blisters. Dennis Halliwell, 34, of Tujunga worked both days, camping Friday and 
Saturday nights at Danielson Ranch to get an early start. On Sunday, he 
complained of blisters on his hands, a sore back and tender thigh muscles. 
</P>
<P>
"For the next couple of days, I'll feel it," said Halliwell, who said he lifts 
nothing heavier than screwdrivers in his job installing commercial sound 
systems. But the discomfort has not deterred him from returning for four years 
running to work on the trails. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just doing our part, since we use them," Halliwell said. 
</P>
<P>
Halliwell's friend and hiking partner, Russ Marshall, 46, of Simi Valley 
agreed. "There's a lot of good trails out there . . . and I figured somebody 
had to build those trails I hiked on, so I thought I'd help," said the burly 
Marshall, a supervisor at a dairy in the City of Industry. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, "sometimes when you're working on the trails, hikers come by 
and say 'Thanks,' and that makes my day."

RENT INCREASES THREATEN TO OUST ARCADIA MOBILE HOME TENANTS

Audrey Galvin dreads the thought of having to move in with her daughter's 
family near San Diego, which she may have to do if rent at the Mobile Manor 
mobile home park goes up again. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't have the room," Galvin, 82, said. "I would have to sleep on the 
couch." 
</P>
<P>
For Galvin and some other residents of Mobile Manor, at 4241 E. Live Oak, a 14% 
rent increase imposed last July is already stretching their budgets to the 
limits. Galvin's monthly Social Security check totals $473 of which $200 goes 
to pay the rent for her 35-by-8-foot space at the park. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to get into savings," said Galvin, a widow and 22-year park resident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lobbying County 
</P>
<P>
A similar dilemma faces many of the 200 other park residents, said Joan Stoner, 
president of the Mobile Manor Homeowners Assn. She is lobbying county officials 
to curb rent increases and enforce an ordinance requiring park owners to offer 
leases. 
</P>
<P>
Although park residents have an Arcadia mailing address, the park is located on 
an unincorporated portion of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Mobile Manor is one of a half-dozen mobile home parks with mailing addresses in 
Arcadia, a city whose motto is "Community of Homes." So, less than a mile from 
half-million dollar homes, there are enclaves of mobile homes, many inhabited 
by elderly residents living on as little as $6,000 a year, Stoner said. 
</P>
<P>
But park manager Clara Pierson said the homeowners group is exaggerating and 
that many residents resent Stoner's description that most of the park residents 
are nearly destitute. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
14% Increase 
</P>
<P>
Pierson said Dr. Fong-Fu Chang, owner of the park, raised rent by 14% last year 
in order to cover increased expenses such as taxes and maintenance. "I try to 
keep the rent to below what the market is charging," Chang said. 
</P>
<P>
Stoner said county officials have been slow to enforce a 1988 ordinance 
targeted at mobile home parks that have failed to offer tenants long-term 
leases, as required by a 1986 ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The 1986 lease requirement was designed to phase out rent controls the county 
had imposed in 1979, said Gregg Kawczynski, administrator of the county's 
Mobile Home Rent Stabilization Program. 
</P>
<P>
But Stoner said park residents have been waiting in vain for a lease since 
early last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lease Proposed 
</P>
<P>
Chang said he has proposed a lease that his attorney and county officials are 
reviewing and anticipates that it will be approved between May 1 and May 15. 
</P>
<P>
Pierson said the county should have acted sooner. 
</P>
<P>
Chang said he does not blame the delays on county staff members, noting that 
the rent stabilization program only has one or two employees to review leases. 
However, he faulted the board of supervisors for shortsightedness. 
</P>
<P>
"They decided to change the law but did not provide enough personnel to get the 
job done." 
</P>
<P>
Kawczynski said similar delays have plagued at least 18 of the 90 mobile home 
parks in the county that are subject to the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
There are 129 mobile home parks in the county, but only those with two or more 
rental spaces are subject to the ordinance, he said. Parks serving mainly 
recreational trailers also do not fall under the ordinance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Office Understaffed 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly can understand the residents' frustrations," Kawczynski said. He 
attributed the delays to an understaffed office. Since the Mobilehome Park Rent 
Adjustment Commission was established in 1988 to enforce the lease requirement, 
Kawczynski said he has had only one part-time intern to help him review leases 
submitted by park owners. 
</P>
<P>
He said the proposed addition of a paralegal to his staff should help speed up 
the review process. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Stoner and Irving Kasow, vice president of the Mobile Manor 
Homeowners Assn., attended a meeting with county officials but left more 
disillusioned than ever. 
</P>
<P>
They had hoped the meeting would result in a lease for Mobile Manor residents. 
If not, they had hoped the county would enforce its 1988 mandatory rent control 
ordinance, which establishes fines for parks that fail to offer the required 
lease. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ordinance, parks that do not offer a lease are prohibited from 
increasing rent by more than 75% of the consumer price index. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Increase Expected 
</P>
<P>
But last week, the rent stabilization commission delayed action on Mobile Manor 
until May 17. 
</P>
<P>
"When is something going to happen?" asked Stoner, who said the commission may 
continue postponements and fail to act before July, when park residents expect 
another rent increase. 
</P>
<P>
Stoner said she and her husband, an electrician at Santa Anita race track, have 
a comfortable income and are not as desperate as some of their neighbors. But 
she said she is worried for her elderly neighbors because many of them are 
depressed by the possibility of becoming homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Jewell Phipps, for example, said another big rent increase may force her to 
give up her trailer home. She said having to turn to her sons for help would 
rob her of her independence and create a burden for her children. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe in mothers imposing on their children," said Phipps, 67. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't live with any of my sons," she said, adding after a pause, "I don't 
get along with my daughters-in-law." 
</P>
<P>
Said Kasow: "We feel we are little Davids fighting Goliath."

COVINA CAT MUTILATIONS NOT SATANIC RITUAL; 
</P>
<P>
2 YOUTHS ARRESTED; 'JUST GOT CARRIED AWAY,' POLICE SAY

<P>
Cat mutilations that police thought may have been linked to satanic rituals 
have turned out to be the work of two teen-agers who "just got carried away," 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The youths, aged 16 and 17, were arrested Tuesday after police confronted them 
with information they had received from anonymous sources. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Identified 
</P>
<P>
The teen-agers, who later admitted their involvement in the killings, were not 
identified because they are juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids aren't devil worshipers or into satanism," said Covina Police Sgt. 
Kim Raney. "They really had no rationale or message. It's just one of those 
thing that pops into a kid's head." 
</P>
<P>
The teen-agers told police that they killed about 14 cats and dumped their 
carcasses in five locations around Covina. 
</P>
<P>
Raney said the bodies of two cats were cut open and their blood used to scrawl 
satanic symbols on a wall. They cut off the tails of 11 cats and saved them in 
a box as "souvenirs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-agers were released to their parents. Their cases have been refered to 
the district attorneys office, which will decide whether they will be tried for 
cruelty to animals. 
</P>
<P>
The killings were made public last week when police disclosed that they were 
investigating the mutilation of several cats whose carcasses were found at the 
closed Cienega Elementary School next to a wall that had "666" and a pentagram 
scrawled on it. 
</P>
<P>
Reports of the killings shocked some residents and left some worrying about the 
safety of their children. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real scary," said Sylvia Magallanes, who lives across the street from the 
school. "Even if it is a bunch of teen-agers, if they're sick enough to cut up 
an animal, I'm terrified." 
</P>
<P>
Detective Frank Schmid said the teen-agers began killing cats in early March, 
when they ran over a cat in the street for fun. 
</P>
<P>
They had no specific reason but began looking for more cats to kill, Schmid 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For the next month and half, the teen-agers trapped stray cats and killed them 
by smashing them against a wall or kicking them to death, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Schmid said the two argued with other members of a church youth group during a 
discussion on satanism. That led them to cut open the bodies of two cats and 
use the blood to scrawl satanic symbols at Cienega Elementary School, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Left Box of Tails 
</P>
<P>
"It was an attempt to emulate Satanists," Schmid said. "They only did it once." 
</P>
<P>
After news reports began appearing about the killings, the two teen-agers took 
the box of cat tails and left it at the Covina Post Office, Schmid said. The 
tails were discovered Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids were squared-away students. They dressed neatly, played sports and 
did well in school," Schmid said. "They just got caught up in things."

Increases in utility taxes and business license fees and a tax on interstate 
and international telephone calls are among the revenue options that will be 
considered by the Pasadena Board of Directors as it begins work on a proposed 
$106.5-million budget for the fiscal year beginning in July. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Donald F. McIntyre told directors this week that about $3.5 
million worth of programs have not been included in the proposed budget because 
there is not enough money to pay for them without cutting other programs or 
increasing revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed budget includes a $1-million revenue increase from an extension of 
the city's telephone tax to interstate and international calls. Other revenue 
increases that could be considered, city officials said, include a $1-million 
increase in business license fees and $750,000 from raising the utility tax for 
residential customers to the level paid by commercial users. The residential 
rate is now about 2% below the commercial rate.

PERAZA KEEPS THE FAITH AT OXNARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH NICHOLS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry White did not hesitate to go to bat for George Peraza, his prized 
shortstop at Hueneme High, when a counselor expressed concern that Peraza could 
not make it in college. 
</P>
<P>
"Here I was trying to encourage him to go to college and this counselor was 
telling me I was wasting my time because they did not think he could do college 
work," White said. 
</P>
<P>
Peraza not only made it in college -- he graduated from Ventura College and 
Nevada Las Vegas -- but he earned master's degrees in both Spanish and physical 
education. No one was less surprised by Peraza's achievements than White, who 
coached the All-Southern Section shortstop at Hueneme from 1963-65. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he has proven a lot of people wrong over the years because his work 
ethic is so tremendous," White said. "I don't think anyone can measure the 
amount of heart and the work ethic that George has. I just wish I worked as 
hard as George does." 
</P>
<P>
Peraza and White's association did not end after Peraza graduated from Hueneme. 
In fact, it was just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
After playing baseball at Ventura College and UNLV, Peraza became White's 
assistant coach -- a position he held for 12 years at both Moorpark and Oxnard 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
So, when White -- who compiled a 235-100 record at Oxnard and Moorpark -- 
resigned last summer as baseball coach at Oxnard, who better to replace him 
than Peraza? 
</P>
<P>
"I think he deserved the position," White said. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard officials eventually agreed with White, but it took them a few months to 
reach that decision. Peraza was not hired until September -- after fall 
baseball practice and the 1988 school year had begun. 
</P>
<P>
White and Peraza agree that the delay in selecting a head coach hurt Oxnard's 
recruiting efforts. Still, Peraza scrambled after being named coach and, as of 
Tuesday, had guided Oxnard to fifth place in the 11-team Western State 
Conference with a record of 15-13, 10-8 in conference play. The Condors are in 
contention for a berth in the WSC's five-team Shaughnessy playoff tournament 
that begins Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some players who want to know who the head coach is and you are 
going to lose people like that, there is no doubt about it," White said of the 
recruiting snags. "They have been competitive all year, but throw in two more 
pitchers and a postion player here and there and they would have been right up 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Peraza, 41, agreed that the delay in naming a successor to White probably cost 
Oxnard several key players. 
</P>
<P>
"They could have gone out right away and found a coach, but that's just the way 
they do things," Peraza said. "We were lacking two or three key defensive 
players and not having a head coach probably cost us about five players who 
were necessary to win this thing." 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard Athletic Director Don Brockett said last summer that the delay was 
necessary in order to comply with the Ventura County Community College 
District's affirmative action policy. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Condors showed no ill effects at the outset of this season. The 
team got off to a fast start in conference play but has slipped in the 
standings the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
A lot was expected of Peraza when he took over for White, who had coached at 
Oxnard since 1978, excluding 1986 when he took a sabbatical leave. Oxnard won 
five WSC division titles and made eight appearances in the conference playoffs 
under White, who had a reputation as a great motivator. 
</P>
<P>
"Jerry has a kind of an aura around him," Peraza said. "He makes you feel like 
you want to go out and play every practice and game as hard as you can. He 
inspired me in high school and he's still inspiring me." 
</P>
<P>
Peraza, a teacher at Thousand Oaks High, said he is not the same caliber of 
motivator that White was, but added that he has developed a good rapport with 
his players. 
</P>
<P>
"I am more of a self-motivated type of individual," Peraza said. "I expect my 
players to also be self-motivated, but that is not always the case. As coach, 
you have to be able to find the right buttons to push." 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, Peraza has been successful in firing up his players. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a real spunky guy, very enthusiastic," said Gil Valencia, a freshman 
left fielder from Camarillo High. "No matter who the opponent is, you will 
always see that competitive look in his eye." 
</P>
<P>
Vince Ebarb, a freshman catcher from Chaparral High in Las Vegas, said that he 
considers Peraza a friend. 
</P>
<P>
"He would do anything for his players and go out on a limb for us any way he 
could," Ebarb said. "If I ever got thrown into jail, he is the one I would 
call. That's how comfortable I feel with him." 
</P>
<P>
Yet not all the players give high marks to the first-year coach. John Stuart, a 
freshman right-handed pitcher, calls Peraza a "tireless guy" but says that he 
has made mistakes this season. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not a Jerry White, who I heard was a winner here," Stuart said. "He has 
made a lot of mistakes this season, like leaving in a pitcher too long or not 
making a decision at the right time. But it's his first year, he will improve." 
</P>
<P>
Peraza said that he is pleased with the Condors' performance this season and he 
is confident he can make Oxnard a winner, just like his predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very confident that I can do the coaching at this level," he said. "I 
feel like I've learned enough throughout the years while working with Jerry." 
</P>
<P>
Said White: "I think George has done a good job of getting the fundamentals 
across to his team. I have watched him at practice this season and I think he 
does a better job with them during practice than we did last year."

NO RELIEF IN SIGHT;

SPLITTING TIME BETWEEN THE MOUND AND OUTFIELD MAKES RICK HIRTENSTEINER A BUSY 
MAN AT PEPPERDINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Now pitching: Rick Hirtensteiner." 
</P>
<P>
 Those are words that first-year Pepperdine baseball Coach Andy Lopez had hoped 
he wouldn't hear. Before the season Lopez asked Hirtensteiner, a three-year 
starter in the outfield, to give relief pitching a try. And he is glad -- 
though sometimes worried -- that the senior consented. 
</P>
<P>
Hirtensteiner's name has usually meant offense in his four seasons with the 
Waves. Through last week, he was the school career leader in runs, with 208, 
and doubles, with 56. He is also among the top five in several other offensive 
categories. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior at Buena High he was drafted by the Houston Astros, and last year 
he was drafted by the Chicago Cubs. But those major league clubs were 
interested in his potential as a hitter and outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
He is batting better than .350 and playing well in center field, but he has 
also been one of Pepperdine's top short relievers; the kind of pitcher that 
comes in for an inning or two, throws strikes and snuffs out rallies. 
</P>
<P>
In his first eight relief appearances covering 12-plus innings, he is 2-1 with 
two saves and has an earned-run average of 2.21. Two weekends ago he suffered 
his first loss of the season when he gave up a three-run homer in a brief 
appearance at Nevada Reno. Before he gave up the home run, his ERA was 0.75. 
</P>
<P>
His hitting -- and his pitching -- have been big reasons why the Waves, after a 
4-6 start, rebounded to win 24 of their next 32 games (including a tie) and 
move into first place in the West Coast Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Hirtensteiner, a 5-foot-11, 190-pound left-handed batter and thrower, is no 
stranger to pitching. 
</P>
<P>
He was a pitcher at times at Buena High and was 5-1 as a starter in his senior 
year. In his first three years at Pepperdine, he did spot relieving for Coach 
Dave Gorrie, who retired from coaching after last year. 
</P>
<P>
Hirtensteiner also was no stranger to Lopez as far as pitching is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
The first time Lopez saw Hirtensteiner was when Lopez was coaching at Cal State 
Dominguez Hills. The Waves and Dominguez Hills were tied, 2-2, in the ninth 
inning when Hirtensteiner came in and got a batter to hit into an inning-ending 
double play. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez remembered that when he came to Pepperdine, and he asked Hirtensteiner if 
he would help the team by making a few more mound appearances. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't mind," Hirtensteiner said. "For my first three years, I pitched a 
little bit, maybe 10 to 15 innings a year. I already have that many innings 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely enjoy it. I like to have the game in my hands, and I'm more into 
the game. There's not a lot of action in the outfield. Being a hitter, I think 
I have an advantage as a pitcher -- I know what hitters are looking for in 
certain situations." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez knew he would be looking for Hirtensteiner often in certain situations -- 
like when the Waves are up by a run and the opponents have two runners on base 
in the last inning. The need for strong relief pitching is underscored by the 
fact that in most of their 13 losses, the Waves were ahead going into the sixth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
But the Pepperdine coach isn't crazy about depending on Hirtensteiner as his 
stopper. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had my way, I wouldn't like him to do both things (play the outfield and 
pitch)," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a chance to play professionally, and I hold my breath that he is going 
to hurt something because he hasn't had enough time to get ready to pitch. I 
cringe occasionally and keep my fingers crossed that nothing is going to happen 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
"He's our leadoff hitter, and he sometimes has to get loose in the bullpen 
between innings," Lopez added. 
</P>
<P>
When Pepperdine is in the field, Lopez continued, "I'd rather have someone on 
the bench get ready to pitch rather than having to wave at our center fielder 
to come in. But Rick is competitive, is in great shape and takes care of 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
Hirtensteiner said that it "is hard to get ready to pitch. I go down to the 
bullpen real quick between innings, and then I might have to hit sooner than I 
expected. It's tough to get loose that way." 
</P>
<P>
He said that having to pitch sometimes detracts from his hitting. "If I'm 
warming up in the bullpen it's hard to change one thing for another, to get 
mentally ready to hit," said Hirtensteiner, who was batting .359 with 48 runs 
and 20 extra-base hits at the beginning of the week. 
</P>
<P>
Hirtensteiner isn't worried that pitching will hurt his prospects for a major 
league career. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think pitching is going to hurt my chances," he said. "I think it's 
good when you can do something extra." 
</P>
<P>
He said that position players Jose Oquendo of the St. Louis Cardinals and Danny 
Heep of the Boston Red Sox add to their value because they are able to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Hirtensteiner isn't the only player to chip in something extra to help 
Pepperdine. And if Coach Lopez has sometimes suffered anxiety attacks over 
using Hirtensteiner in relief, he is also relieved that he has been able to use 
him as a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest trait that attracted me about him is that it's hard to hide a 
coward on the mound -- and he is far from a coward," Lopez said. "He has the 
mind-set that he wants to be out there, and that's half the battle. 
</P>
<P>
"He has real good arm strength. He has a fastball, a curve and plays around 
with a changeup. He throws low strikes and is aggressive. I feel a lot better 
with him on the mound, and I think his teammates do too."

NATIONAL BEST TIMES SURPRISE EVEN BURNHAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sean Waters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's nothing unexpected about Angela Burnham of Rio Mesa High winning a 
race. It's how fast she runs that's surprising -- and no one has been more 
shocked by her times than Burnham herself. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham established national high school-leading times in the 100 and 400 
meters Saturday in the Mt. San Antonio College Relays in Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
She won the 100 meters in 11.57 to better the national best of 11.59 set by 
archrival Inger Miller of Pasadena Muir. Miller beat Burnham with that time in 
Arcadia Invitational on April 8. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really pleased with the 100 time because we haven't done any speedwork 
yet," said Burnham, the defending state champion in the 100 and 200. "I wasn't 
really concentrating on the 100, I was just using it as a warm-up for the 400." 
</P>
<P>
Her most unexpected performance of the day came in the 400, where Burnham ran 
54.09, bettering the year's previous fastest time of 54.39 set five minutes 
earlier by Angela Rolfe of Los Angeles Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised with the (400) time," Burnham said. "My goal going into the 
race was just to break 57." 
</P>
<P>
Have a Dailey: Former Ventura High standout Steve Dailey hit three home runs 
and had seven runs batted in for Oklahoma State on Saturday in the first game 
of a doubleheader against Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
Dailey, a freshman, is batting a team-high .435 for the seventh-ranked Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
Signings: Matt Anderson of Buena High and John Bushart of Thousand Oaks, both 
left-handed pitchers, have accepted baseball scholarships to Cal State 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson (4-1, 1.58 ERA) also plays outfield and leads the county with a .556 
batting average. Bushart (5-1, 1.82) leads the county with 65 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Former Buena standout Mark Anderson, Matt's brother, played four years for 
CSUN, including 1984 when the Matadors won their second Division II 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
Setting higher standards: Moorpark High administrators admit they are judging 
coaches by a different standard than they use with teachers, and former 
basketball Coach Rick Kent was among the first to feel the effect of that 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
Kent was dismissed as the boys' basketball coach last week after five seasons. 
Kent had a 7-13 record and a 2-7 mark in Tri-Valley League play last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think coaches have to be accountable for their actions," Athletic Director 
Rich Uphoff said. "Athletics, unlike teaching, is not a tenured position. 
Coaches are offered a one-year contract and are judged subjectively and 
objectively on an annual basis. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't expect our coaches to have winning records every year, but over a 
period of time we expect them to be successful." 
</P>
<P>
Kent, who rejected a lower-level coaching position from Uphoff, said he will 
continue to teach mathematics at Chapparral Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
"I never said I was a good coach," Kent said. "It was for the fun and the 
people that I coached. I enjoyed seeing the kids on a different level and I'll 
miss it all a lot." 
</P>
<P>
New Sycamore: As expected, Bubba Burrage signed a letter-of-intent Tuesday to 
attend Indiana State on a basketball scholarship. Burrage, a forward from state 
champion Santa Clara High, visited the Terre Haute, Ind., school two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Out for the season: Buena (13-2-1, 8-0), lost a top hitter when Tom Lyle was 
declared academically ineligible. The designated-hitter/outfielder is batting 
.417. 
</P>
<P>
Stat Watch: Hueneme (8-10, 3-5) went 493 at-bats without a home run until Reyno 
Ortega hit one in a 10-9 victory over Channel Islands on Saturday. . . . St. 
Bonaventure pitchers Chris Castro and Kevin Zoll combined for six consecutive 
complete games before the Seraphs used a relief pitcher Friday against Oak 
Park. . . . Fillmore's Brad Edmonds has allowed one earned run in his last 27 
innings. . . . Senior Sal Ledesma, in his first year of high school baseball, 
leads Oxnard in stolen bases (nine) and is second in hits (14). 
</P>
<P>
No time to rest: Gary Anglin was not in a mood to relax, even though his 
Ventura College baseball team had a bye last Saturday. Instead, he scouted a 
game between Oxnard and Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hate to look back when the season is over and think that I did not do 
as much as I could to win it," Anglin said. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura is atop the Western State Conference standings entering the last week 
of regular-season play. The Pirates (14-4 in WSC play) have a slim lead over 
second-place Canyons (13-4). 
</P>
<P>
Ventura, which is trying to win its first WSC title in 15 years and become the 
top-seeded team for the WSC's five-team playoff tournament, which begins 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Guest appearance: Steve Timmons, a two-time Olympic volleyball player on U. S. 
teams that won gold medals, will appear at the Footlocker Store in Camarillo, 
704 Arneil Road, today at 2 p.m.

MATH, READING SCORES MIXED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California's 12th-graders scored slightly lower in reading and slightly higher 
in mathematics this year, results of the 1988-89 California Assessment Program 
test show. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, the average score rose six points to 256 in mathematics but dropped 
two points to 248 in reading. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County, the county superintendent of schools' office had not had 
time to analyze the results, according to a spokesman. However, a number of 
school districts reflected the statewide pattern. 
</P>
<P>
The Conejo Valley Unified School District, which has 1,510 12th-graders, showed 
increased scores in math and decreased scores in reading. Among the nine school 
districts in the county, Conejo Valley scored highest in math, a district 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
Only one of the three high schools in the district, Westlake, showed a decrease 
in math scores, dropping two points. That school also showed a significant 
decrease in reading, plunging 54 points over the 1987-88 scores. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still above the state average in both math and reading," said Sylvia 
Michael, associate director of research and assessment, "but are looking at the 
scores and trying to analyze them." 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard Union High School District, with 2,024 12th-grade students tested, also 
showed the same statewide trend, with scores higher in math and lower in 
reading, according to a district official. 
</P>
<P>
State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig offered an upbeat appraisal of the 
state's scores, saying that although some of this year's results are 
disappointing, "the long-term trend is more impressive." 
</P>
<P>
For example, Honig said, an analysis of test results shows that the average 
12th-grade student today is performing nearly a full grade level higher in math 
and half a grade level higher in reading than five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"That is the fastest spurt of growth in this state ever," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The statewide decline in reading scores occurred mainly among girls, whose 
average score fell six points to 251. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand it," Honig said of the reading slump among girls. "I don't 
know if it's an anomaly or if this particular class is different or if 
something we're doing is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
A recent College Board study showed a narrowing of the gender gap over the last 
20 years on tests of verbal ability, and "this could be part of it," Honig 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, women have scored significantly higher than men on tests of 
language skill. But the College Board study found that women's verbal scores 
have been falling and men's scores rising on such tests as the Scholastic 
Aptitude Test (SAT), the American College Testing Program Examination (ACT) and 
advanced placement exams. 
</P>
<P>
Among California's 12th-grade boys, reading test results showed a one-point 
gain to an average of 245. 
</P>
<P>
Improvement in math was found across-the-board, with gains made by male and 
female students and all major ethnic groups, Honig said. 
</P>
<P>
Pat McCabe, a California Assessment Program consultant for the state Department 
of Education, noted that the number of limited-English-speaking students rose 
1% statewide to 6.3% in 1988-89. But those students as a group scored 12 points 
higher in math and one point higher in reading than did last year's 
limited-English group, McCabe said. 
</P>
<P>
Limited-English students still performed considerably lower than most students 
statewide, however, with an average reading score of 132 and average math score 
of 187. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, 95% of all 12th-graders, or 226,000 students, took the California 
Assessment Program test in December, 2% more than in 1987-88. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW TO READ THE SCORES 
</P>
<P>
* Districts are in boldface (the first entry on each table); individual schools 
are in lighter face. Two years of test results are given. The first line of 
numbers contains 1988-89 test results, while the second line refers to 1987-88 
results. Scores for magnet programs, continuation schools and other schools 
with small enrollments have been omitted. 
</P>
<P>
* The scores are reported on a scale from 100 to about 400. The average score 
statewide in 1988-89 was 248 in reading and 256 in math. 
</P>
<P>
* The "rank" which follows each score allows comparisons to all other districts 
or schools statewide. All schools and districts are ranked on a scale of 1 to 
99 with a median rank of 50. Thus, for example, the Los Angeles County High 
School for the Arts has a rank of 98 in reading and 78 in math, which means it 
scored considerably higher than other high schools in the state in both areas. 
</P>
<P>
* "SES" is a measure of a school's or a district's socioeconomic status. It is 
based on student reports of parents' education level. Each school and district 
is assigned a number ranging from 1 to 5, with 1 indicating parents who did not 
complete high school and 5 indicating those with advanced degrees. A 3 would 
mean that most parents in the school or district attended some college. 
</P>
<P>
* "% LEP" is the percentage of students who are limited-English-proficient, 
which means they are not native English speakers and are not yet fluent in 
English. The average California school has 6.3% LEP students. 
</P>
<P>
* In some districts in which only one school is listed, the district and school 
averages may be different. The reason is that the district average included the 
scores of a large number of continuation school students.

Sample Reading Questions 
</P>
<P>
Read the following autobiographical selection by Ernesto Galarza, and then 
answer the questions that follow it. You may look back at the passage as you 
answer the questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyhood in a Sacramento Barrio 
</P>
<P>
Our family conversations always occurred on our own kitchen porch, away from 
the gringos. One or the other of the adults would begin: Se han fijado? Had we 
noticed -- that the Americans do not ask permission to leave the room; that 
they had no respectful way of addressing an elderly person; that they spit 
brown over the railing of the porch into the yard; that when they laughed they 
roared; that they never brought saludos to everyone in your family from 
everyone in their family when they visited; that General Delibree was only a 
clerk; that zopilotes were not allowed on the streets to collect garbage; that 
the policemen did not carry lanterns at night; that Americans didn't keep their 
feet on the floor when they were sitting; that there was a special automobile 
for going to jail; that a rancho was not a rancho at all but a very small 
hacienda; that the saloons served their customers free eggs, pickles, and 
sandwiches; that instead of bullfighting, the gringos for sport tried to kill 
each other with gloves? 
</P>
<P>
I did not have nearly the strong feelings on these matters that Dona Henriqueta 
expressed. I felt a vague admiration for the way Mr. Brien could spit brown. 
Wayne, my classmate, laughed much better than the Mexicans,because he opened 
his big mouth wide and brayed like a donkey so he could be heard a block away. 
But it was the kind of laughter that made my mother tremble, and it was not 
permitted in our house. 
</P>
<P>
Rules were laid down to keep me, as far as possible, un muchacho bien educado. 
If I had to spit, I was to do it privately, or if in public, by the curb, with 
my head down and my back to people. I was never to wear my cap in the house and 
I was to take it off even on the porch if ladies or elderly gentlemen were 
sitting. If I wanted to scratch, under no circumstances was I to do it right 
then and there, in company, like the Americans, but I was to excuse myself. If 
Catfish or Russell yelled to me from across the street, I was not to shout 
back. I was never to ask for tips for my errands or other services to the 
tenants of 418L, for these were atenciones expected of me. 
</P>
<P>
Above all I was never to fail in respeto to grownups, no matter who they were. 
It was an inflexible rule; I addressed myself to Senor Big Singh, Senor Big 
Ernie, Senora Dodson, Senor Choree Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
We could have hung on the door of our apartment a sign like those we read in 
some store windows -- Aqui se habla espanol. We not only spoke Spanish, we read 
it. From the Libreria Espanola, two blocks up the street, Gustavo and I brought 
novels for my mother, like Genoveva de Brabante, a paperback with the poems of 
Amado Nervo and a handbook of the history of Mexico. The novels were never read 
aloud; the poems and the handbook were. Nervo was the famous poet from Tepic, 
close enough to Jalcocotan to make him our own. And in the history book I 
learned to read for myself, after many repetitions by my mother, about the 
deeds of the great Mexicans Don Salvador had recited so vividly to the class in 
Mazatlan. She refused to decide for me whether Abraham Lincoln was as great as 
Benito Juarez, or George Washington braver than the priest Don Miguel Hidalgo. 
At school there was no opportunity to settle these questions because nobody 
seemed to know about Juarez or Hidalgo; at least they were never mentioned and 
there were no pictures of them on the walls. 
</P>

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLAN TO REGISTER HOMEWORK SHELVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials in West Hollywood have shelved a controversial proposal that would 
have required people who earn a living working at home to register with the 
city. TV and motion picture writers opposed the proposed law, claiming that it 
smacked of "Big Brotherism." 
</P>
<P>
City officials said at a Business License Commission hearing that they were 
postponing consideration of a plan to license many of the city's estimated 
3,000 to 5,000 businesses. While exempting from regulation writers, artists and 
others who are self-employed and work at home, the law would have required such 
people to register with the city clerk's office and pay an annual fee. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 of the Writers Guild of America, West's more than 7,500 members -- 
who represent about 90% of all film and broadcast writers in the United States 
-- live in West Hollywood, according to guild spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden. The 
guild is headquartered in the city.

ANOTHER MISTRIAL MOTION IS DENIED IN NANCY HOOVER HUNTER FRAUD CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U. S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam on Wednesday denied another motion for a 
mistrial made by Nancy Hoover Hunter's lawyers, who complained that they had 
just received 197 pages of documents that prosecutors should have turned over 
to them by last March 15. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam resumed Hunter's fraud trial Wednesday after recessing it for a day 
Tuesday to deal with a continuing dispute between the prosecution and defense 
over the document issue. Prosecutors said they have now given Hunter's lawyers 
all notes and memoranda regarding investigators' interviews with both scheduled 
and potential witnesses at the trial. By law, defense attorneys are entitled to 
notes pertaining to actual witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter is charged with 234 counts of fraud, income-tax invasion and conspiracy 
stemming from her role as a top executive at the once-glamorous La Jolla 
investment firm of J. David &amp; Co. The firm was headed by J. David (Jerry) 
Dominelli, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for his part in a huge 
Ponzi scheme, in which investors were bilked out of more than $80 million. 
Hunter, the former mayor of Del Mar, was Dominelli's live-in companion during 
the firm's heyday. 
</P>
<P>
Her trial resumed with the introduction of a key prosecution document -- a note 
Hunter allegedly wrote to Dominelli, apparently warning him not to use an 
accounting practice that could result in their activities being tracked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Handwritten Note 
</P>
<P>
The handwritten note, which was displayed on a screen for the jury, reads: "I'm 
not eager for J.D. Securities to clear your Interbank trades. They will then be 
able to construct their own version of your track record. It could be bad." 
</P>
<P>
The note apparently refers to J. David Securities, a J. David &amp; Co. entity 
headed by Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping J. David &amp; Co.'s dismal investment track records from public 
scrutiny as well as the scrutiny of the firm's employees was a key to the 
firm's continued ability to lure investors. The prosecutors, S. Gay Hugo and 
Stephen P. Clark, have alleged that Hunter was aware of the fraud, was 
integrally involved in it and helped to create the false track records that 
duped investors and were kept from lower-level employees. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter's lawyers hope to lay the blame solely on Dominelli and convince the 
jury that she, like other employees, was unaware of his illegal activities. 
</P>
<P>
The handwritten note was identified Wednesday by Jane Sinclair, a prosecution 
witness who worked for J. David Securities from 1980 until the time of its 
collapse in 1984. Sinclair said she recognized the handwriting as Hunter's. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Photocopying Statements 
</P>
<P>
Sinclair, who did bookkeeping for J. David Securities and was on its board of 
directors, also testified that, despite the fact that her job was to prepare 
the monthly investor account statements, she encountered Hunter one day 
photocopying a half-inch stack of statements for accounts she (Sinclair) had 
never heard of. 
</P>
<P>
Sinclair said the account statements showed returns for investors that were 
"far more favorable" than the ones she handled. She said she questioned Hunter 
about it and Hunter responded that the investors got better returns because it 
was a separate, bigger pool with lower fees. 
</P>
<P>
On cross-examination by defense attorney Robert S. Brewer, Sinclair said that, 
during the entire time she worked for J. David Securities, she thought that 
both Dominelli and Hunter were "honorable" people. 
</P>
<P>
The trial resumes today with further cross-examination of Sinclair.

ROLE OF A REFERENDUM IN NAMING CONVENTION CENTER IS CLOUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego Councilman Wes Pratt contended Wednesday that opponents of the 
proposal to name the San Diego Convention Center for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther 
King Jr. would have no legal grounds to use the referendum process to overturn 
votes of the council and the San Diego Board of Port Commissioners in favor of 
that action. 
</P>
<P>
Pratt, the council's only black and the leader of the drive to honor King, said 
the lengthy 1985 agreement between the two agencies allows them to rename the 
convention center by voting to amend it and recording that vote in writing. 
Since that written agreement would not be a "legislative act," it could not be 
used as the basis for a referendum, Pratt claimed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my belief that it's an amendment to an agreement between the city and the 
port, and it's not a legislative act," Pratt said Wednesday. He said he will 
ask City Atty. John Witt for a legal opinion on his interpretation of the law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grounds for Referendum? 
</P>
<P>
Robert Pruett, leader of a citizens group that has threatened to strip King's 
name from the convention center by referendum, if necessary, said Wednesday 
that Pratt is mistaken. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that any attorney would disagree with him," Pruett said. He said he 
has received advice from several attorneys whose "feeling is that we have 
grounds to hold a referendum." 
</P>
<P>
Chief Deputy City Atty. Curtis Fitzpatrick, who wrote the 1985 agreement that 
spells out the terms under which the city will operate the convention center, 
said he could not offer an opinion on Pratt's contention without researching 
the subject. San Diego Unified Port District attorney Joseph Patello was not in 
his office Wednesday and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Pratt's remarks came a day after port board Chairman Louis Wolfsheimer said he 
would again bring the King tribute proposal before his seven-member board at 
its May 16 meeting. Wolfsheimer agreed to the unusual move after a request from 
Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who in February called the chances of naming the 
convention center for King slim. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted, 7 to 2 Jan. 10, to rename the $160-million bayfront 
convention center for King. The proposal was sent to the port commissioners, 
who also must approve any name change, but that panel dodged the issue Feb. 21 
when the renaming was not brought up for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Hot Potato 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the commissioners voted, 4 to 3, to create an "Avenue of Honors" on 
the convention center's bayfront terrace and make King its first inductee. The 
port sent the political hot potato back to the council, where it languished for 
more than two months until O'Connor made her request Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Pratt said he told O'Connor Tuesday he would initiate action on the 
name change at Tuesday's council meeting if she did not. The mayor then 
volunteered to send a letter to the port commissioners asking for a vote on the 
council's proposed name of San Diego Martin Luther King Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of the seven port commissioners -- San Diego appointees Daniel 
Larsen, William Rick and Wolfsheimer, and National City appointee Delton 
Reopelle -- have publicly committed themselves to vote for the King tribute. 
Larsen, however, sided with Chula Vista representative Robert Penner, Imperial 
Beach representative Milford Portwood and Coronado appointee Raymond Burk on 
the Avenue of Honors proposal Feb. 21, preventing a vote on the name change. 
None of the commissioners could be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Pratt contended that a May 13, 1985, ordinance approving the convention center 
"management agreement" also does not give Pruett's committee grounds for a 
referendum, although it is clearly a "legislative act." Pratt claims that the 
ordinance's only purpose was to authorize the city manager to enter into the 
agreement and that the ordinance is silent on the name change. 
</P>
<P>
Although Fitzpatrick agreed that management decisions are not subject to 
referendum, he said the traditional view of case law on this subject is that 
ordinances passed to adopt such agreements can be the basis for referendums. 
</P>
<P>
For example, city attorneys were in court earlier this month arguing that a 
citizens group's referendum on a council ordinance approving the Miramar Ranch 
North development agreement was legal. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzpatrick also suggested that the council's Jan. 10 resolution endorsing the 
King tribute -- or a future one it might be asked to pass -- might be 
considered legislative acts subject to referendums. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rule on Signatures 
</P>
<P>
Organizations wishing to place referendums on the ballot have 30 days from the 
day of a council action to gather sufficient signatures on petitions requesting 
a reversal of the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Pruett said his organization, Citizens to Keep the Name San Diego Convention 
Center, has not decided whether it will hold a referendum drive solely within 
the city of San Diego or in all five cities that compose the Port District. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, Pruett said, voters will certainly strip King's name from the 
convention center, just as they decided in 1987 to overturn the council's 
decision to rename Market Street as Martin Luther King Way. 
</P>
<P>
"When it goes to a referendum, the City Council is going to be horribly 
embarrassed," he said.

Police have arrested a man believed to have injured an officer two weeks ago 
during an auto theft in City Heights, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Dave Cohen said officers received a tip and arrested 
20-year-old Thomas Quidacha about 6 p.m. Tuesday near Fairmount and University 
avenues, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Quidacha had a stolen car when arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe that Quidacha was in a car in the 3000 block of 44th Street that 
sped off April 12 and dragged Officer Jeffrey Durbin about 30 feet after he 
reached in to grab the keys from the ignition. 
</P>
<P>
Durbin was on a burglary call when he attempted to stop the car after noticing 
that it had no license plates and its side window was shattered, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterward, an ambulance and a fire truck, with sirens blaring and 
speeding to the aid of Durbin, collided at University and 43rd Street. Four 
firefighters, two paramedics and a doctor were injured in the accident.

An unidentified white man, thought to be in his mid-30s, was struck by two 
vehicles and killed Wednesday evening while trying to cross California 94 near 
the College Avenue exit, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Coroner Everett Mauger said the man apparently was crossing from the 
Marketplace at the Grove shopping center, which is on the north side of 94. 
</P>
<P>
He was hit about 6:15 p.m. by a pickup, then by a sedan, both of which were 
headed west on the freeway, Mauger said.

HAWTHORNE TO REDEVELOP 100-ACRE PARCEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BAIRD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a surprise announcement, Hawthorne officials said the city expects to start 
the redevelopment process on 100 acres near the new I-105 Freeway by early 
1990, much sooner than property owners in the targeted area had expected. 
</P>
<P>
Bud Cormier, assistant redevelopment director, made the announcement Monday at 
a City Council hearing on Hawthorne's updated General Plan. The council voted 
4-0 to approve the plan, a document that will govern all future zoning and 
development in the city. 
</P>
<P>
At the two-hour hearing, several residents and property owners peppered the 
City Council and staff with questions about how the updated General Plan would 
affect them. Of particular concern was the staff recommendation -- later 
ratified by the council -- that a sector of northern Hawthorne alongside the 
proposed freeway be targeted for commercial redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
The area now contains a mix of uses including more than 400 residential 
properties. At Planning Commission hearings in March and April, residents said 
they feared rezoning would leave them in limbo for 10, 15 or 20 years while the 
city awaited commercial development proposals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commercial Designation 
</P>
<P>
Until such commercial development materializes, they said, their home values 
would suffer because lenders and buyers would be wary of residential property 
in an area designated by the General Plan for commercial zoning. The Planning 
Commission went along with their view and on April 5 recommended that the 
current mixed zoning be retained in the General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
But the council, noting that commercial development is close at hand, ignored 
the Planning Commission's recommendation and approved the commercial 
designation. The council made a point to note that the wholesale rezoning could 
be a financial boon to area property owners. 
</P>
<P>
Cormier's announcement Monday was the first public acknowledgment that 
commercial development and the creation of a redevelopment district is imminent 
in the area surrounding the freeway, which is scheduled for completion in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The enormous development potential has already attracted three major 
development proposals for the "bell curve" area, consisting of 80 acres just 
south of the I-105 route, he said. Also targeted for redevelopment is a 20-acre 
area west of the "bell curve" area, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Saying that it would be premature to identify the three prospective developers, 
Cormier described them as "quality people"' who have proven track records in 
development. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Early Next Year 
</P>
<P>
Cormier said the city expects to start the redevelopment process early next 
year. "We won't be purchasing homes by then, but we will be getting the 
mechanisms in place" to establish a redevelopment district, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The principal critic of the city's intention to earmark the freeway area for 
commercial development was Ray Sulser, a former Planning Commission chairman. 
At Planning Commission hearings, Sulser had said he feared that the commercial 
designation would be harmful to residents' property values if the redevelopment 
process were subject to lengthy delays. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning from Councilman Charles Bookhammer on Monday, Sulser 
acknowledged, however, that if commercial redevelopment is imminent, residents 
could get more money for their land than if it remained residential. 
</P>
<P>
R. Dale Beland, the city's consultant on the General Plan, testified that 
commercial land generally is more valuable than residential land. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman David M. York said it would be more harmful to current owners to 
leave the zoning mixed. Developers who know of impending plans for commercial 
zoning could buy up land at residential prices, zoned property would bring, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Projects Withdrawn 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Tuesday, Sulser said he will withdraw his opposition if 
commercial redevelopment, as officials have promised, gets under way within the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
But Sulser said he is skeptical of staff promises. He said that in another 
redevelopment area, a 20-acre site at Rosecrans Avenue and the 405 Freeway, 
property owners have been left hanging for nearly five years. Because of a 
variety of factors, including a dwindling demand for office space, two major 
projects were proposed for the 20-acre site, and later withdrawn. A third 
proposal is pending. 
</P>
<P>
A homeowner who has lived with his family in a three-bedroom home for 10 years 
said he fears being forced to move by redevelopment because mortgage payments 
will be higher. 
</P>
<P>
Cormier said that state law requires the city redevelopment agency to "make 
whole" property owners who are displaced by a redevelopment project. The city 
has to find comparable sites and pay relocation costs, he said. If necessary, 
the city must subsidize higher mortgage costs to help the resident or business 
owner acquire a comparable property in a new location, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prospect of Relocation 
</P>
<P>
In spite of efforts by the council and staff to reassure property owners, 
several members of the audience grumbled about the prospect of relocation, 
particularly for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
The 80-acre area is generally bounded by I-105 on the north and Imperial 
Boulevard on the south, with the San Diego Freeway on the west and Prairie 
Avenue on the east. The 20-acre site has Imperial Highway as its northern 
border with 115th Street on the south. It runs west from Inglewood Avenue to 
the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
While the commercial designation for the freeway area was the main subject of 
debate Monday, another segment of the General Plan came under fire from two of 
the city's largest employers, Northrop Aviation and TRW. 
</P>
<P>
That segment of the plan called for reducing the amount of development allowed 
in industrial areas: cutting the floor-to-area ratio to .75:1 from 2:1. The 
floor-to-area ratio depends on the lot size to calculate the maximum interior 
space of a building. For example, on a 30,000-square-foot lot, a 2:1 ratio 
would allow construction of a 60,000-square-foot building, while the .75:1 
ratio would allow construction of a 22,500-square-foot building. 
</P>
<P>
After Northrop and TRW representatives said the lowered allowance would mean "a 
significant devaluation of corporate assets," the council modified the ratio to 
1.75:1. On a 30,000-square-foot lot, this ratio would permit a 
52,500-square-foot building.

PARENTS FACE OFF ON BILINGUAL CLASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two groups of Latino parents marched outside a Sun Valley school Wednesday, one 
of them loudly chanting support for bilingual education and the other quietly 
backing teachers seeking the program's end. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Soto, a parent who organized the group at Glenwood School that supports 
the anti-bilingual teachers, said, "The purpose of the march is to let the 
community and the district know that there has been so much slander regarding 
LEAD and the teachers at Glenwood." 
</P>
<P>
LEAD is Learning English Advocates Drive, a statewide teachers group organized 
by a Glenwood teacher who opposes teaching non-English-speaking students mainly 
in their native language. 
</P>
<P>
Soto's group carried bilingual signs that bore slogans such as "LEAD Loves All 
Children" and "Parents Support Sally Peterson," LEAD's founder. 
</P>
<P>
"We know what's going on at our school, and we know our students," said Soto, a 
longtime parent at the elementary school. "Mrs. Peterson doesn't want to 
abolish bilingual education. She wants reform." 
</P>
<P>
Soto said that many Spanish-speaking students are kept in bilingual classrooms 
long after they become fluent in English. As a result, she said, they enter 
junior high school far behind their English-speaking classmates. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after Soto's group of about 15 began walking, the second group of about 30 
began demonstrating nearby. The second group, made up of parents from across 
the district, denounced LEAD and later argued with the Glenwood parents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Latinos Parents Protest 
</P>
<P>
The bilingual supporters also had demonstrated April 18 at Glenwood, when about 
50 Latino parents from across Los Angeles protested LEAD's attempts to abolish 
the school district's bilingual education plan. Some of the parents who 
participated in last week's protest turned up again Wednesday, carrying what 
appeared to be hastily written placards touting bilingual education. 
</P>
<P>
LEAD "is against bilingual education because they cannot work with 
Spanish-language students," said Francisco Gonzalez, a parent from 28th Street 
School in central Los Angeles. "Under the new master plan, bilingual education 
will go very well, but these LEAD parents oppose it." 
</P>
<P>
The master plan emphasizes putting bilingual teachers in every classroom with 
more than 10 students who are not fluent in English. 
</P>
<P>
The 22,000 members of United Teachers-Los Angeles, the teachers' union, are 
voting by mail on a LEAD proposal to reject a proposed $5,000 bonus for 
bilingual teachers. Teachers who are not bilingual, but who are teaching in a 
bilingual classroom, would be asked to learn Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Much Demand 
</P>
<P>
The district and union officials argue that rejecting the bonus could bring the 
end of bilingual education in Los Angeles because bilingual teachers are much 
in demand and could seek higher wages elsewhere. Results of that vote will be 
known next month. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson, a Glenwood kindergarten teacher, said the march "was a loving gesture 
. . . and I thought it was fabulous." 
</P>
<P>
She said LEAD, which draws financial support from conservative English-only 
groups, does not oppose bilingual education. LEAD supports teaching students in 
English with assistance from bilingual aides, she said.

PLOTTER IN AMBUSH KILLING OF DETECTIVE GETS 25 YEARS TO LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAYERENE BARKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles man who helped plot the ambush slaying of a Los Angeles police 
detective was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison Wednesday in Van Nuys 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Kathryne Ann Stoltz imposed the penalty on Voltaire Alphonse Williams, 
26, who was convicted Feb. 21 of conspiracy to commit murder in the death of 
Detective Thomas C. Williams, 40. 
</P>
<P>
The same jury acquitted Williams, who is no relation to the late police 
officer, of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
The detective died on Halloween, 1985, in a volley of gunfire as he picked up 
his 6-year-old son from a Canoga Park church school. The child was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
Four other men were tried in the killing. In October, Daniel Jenkins, 33, a 
North Hollywood limousine driver convicted of masterminding the plot to kill 
Thomas Williams, was sentenced to die in the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
The detective was gunned down just hours after he had testified against Jenkins 
in a robbery trial. 
</P>
<P>
Ruben Antonio Moss, 26, described as Jenkins' "loyal lieutenant," also was 
convicted of first-degree murder in the officer's death. In December, he was 
sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Reecy Clem Cooper, 34, was acquitted of first-degree murder and 
conspiracy to commit murder. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the district attorney's office announced that it will retry Duane 
Moody, 30, for murder in the officer's death. A jury acquitted Moody of 
conspiracy to commit murder last month but deadlocked on the murder charge 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
During the 10-week trial, Voltaire Williams, an aspiring boxer, admitted to 
meeting with Jenkins on Oct. 24, 1985, to plan the officer's slaying. But his 
attorney, Lewis Watnick, said his client initially agreed to help Jenkins kill 
the detective but backed out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Gave Back the Gun' 
</P>
<P>
"He gave back the gun and the gloves six days before the murder took place," 
Watnick said after Williams was convicted. He said Williams decided he could 
not morally go through with the killing. 
</P>
<P>
Watnick said his client was in Oakland at the time of the killing. Prosecutors 
disputed the claim that Williams had backed out of the conspiracy but agreed 
that he had been out of town when the shooting occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Watnick alleged Wednesday that Jenkins plans to have Williams killed and asked 
that he be imprisoned in a different institution than Jenkins. The judge agreed 
to note Watnick's request on the sentencing order. 
</P>
<P>
The officer's wife, Norma, and his daughter, Susan, were in court for the 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Williams will be eligible for parole in about 17 years, authorities said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $10,000 IN JEWELS TAKEN FROM DUNPHY'S HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than $10,000 in jewelry was discovered stolen Tuesday from the Encino home 
of veteran television anchorman Jerry Dunphy, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Dunphy, for 14 years the anchor at KABC-TV, discovered the theft when he and 
his wife and their 4-year-old daughter returned Tuesday to their Meadowgate 
Road residence from a 12-day vacation, authorities said. It was not known when 
the burglary occurred, said Los Angeles Police Capt. Gordon Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
No suspects have been identified, Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
Dunphy, 67, is attempting to sell the five-bedroom, 4,500-square-foot house for 
$925,000, said Jim Pascucci, a real estate agent who is handling Dunphy's 
purchase of a $2-million home off Mulholland Drive in Encino.

P.V. ESTATES TO END VAN SERVICE UNLESS REFORMS ARE MADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN JOHNSON, Community Correspondent 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the objections of numerous residents, the Palos Verdes Estates City 
Council voted 3 to 2 Tuesday to put the brakes on its participation in PV 
Transit, the peninsula-wide dial-a-van service, unless changes are made to 
increase the number of occasional riders and reduce the amount the city pays to 
subsidize fares. 
</P>
<P>
The city staff was ordered to present alternatives to the council at its May 23 
meeting. If no agreement is reached, the city will withdraw from the service 
July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Under the present system, which is administered by Rancho Palos Verdes, riders 
can buy monthly subscriptions that let them reserve seats for specific times 
and destinations. Occasional riders who call on short notice are often told 
that no seat is available, said City Manager Gordon Siebert. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes Estates council members have complained since 1985, when the city 
joined PV Transit, that too few residents use the door-to-door system (3% in 
1988) because 166 families in the city monopolize it by purchasing 
subscriptions mostly to transport children to and from school. 
</P>
<P>
PV Transit also serves Rancho Palos Verdes, Rolling Hills Estates and some 
unincorporated areas on the Palos Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fund Trade Urged 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes Estates pays $180,000 in special transportation taxes for its 
share in the system. Although such funds can be used only for transportation 
services, city officials said, they can be traded to other cities for funds 
that could be used to repair streets and storm sewers or pay for police, fire 
and paramedic services, thus benefiting all the city's residents. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Edward Ritscher said residents who use the service on a subscription 
basis should pay more. Riders pay $1 for a one-way trip, and the city pays up 
to $8. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, the system is dominated by a few individuals in the city," 
Councilman James Kinney said. "One hundred sixty families out of 5,000 use it. 
That's a $1,100-per-family subsidy from other taxpayers in our city. People I 
talk to are absolutely shocked that we're paying $9 per ride to move people 
around. It's a very, very expensive system." 
</P>
<P>
Households with two working parents seem to rely most on the service to 
transport their children to and from school and to after-school activities. 
Maids and other household workers without automobiles also use the service 
extensively, Siebert said. 
</P>
<P>
About 75 people turned out at Tuesday's public hearing to plead with the 
council for continued participation in the program. Many said they would be 
willing to pay more to ensure that their children have safe, reliable 
transportation to and from school. 
</P>
<P>
"We live in a beautiful city that is very inhospitable to children getting 
around," said Carol Davis, a single parent. "(PV Transit) is one of the most 
civilized and forward-thinking things we do." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Ruth Gralow, who voted against pulling out of the system, said she favors 
using the transportation system for students. "I don't think we should penalize 
our children because parents have to work," she said, adding that 
tax-subsidized programs rarely benefit everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Palos Verdes Mayor Jacki Bacharach said Wednesday that the Palos Verdes 
Estates City Council has been repeatedly invited to explore alternatives to the 
present dial-a-van system. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't do this in a vacuum," she said. "If we're going to have any 
constructive changes, it's going to take some time and commitment." 
</P>
<P>
The Rancho Palos Verdes City Council will sponsor a community forum at Hesse 
Park at 7:30 p.m. on May 11 to discuss peninsula transportation issues. 
Bacharach said Palos Verdes Estates was asked to help sponsor the event but 
declined.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL OKS VOTE ON BILTMORE SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An initiative to retain the Biltmore site in Hermosa Beach as open space will 
be placed on the November ballot, the City Council decided unanimously Tuesday 
night. The measure, circulated by Parker Herriott, qualified for the ballot 
last month, but could have been adopted by the council as an ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
O That course was unlikely in view of the council majority's support for a 
compromise proposal suggested by a citizens advisory committee in late March. 
It called for using about 65% of the 0.84-acre city-owned parcel as an "urban 
public plaza" and selling the rest to developers. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. James P. Lough noted some legal flaws in Herriott's initiative, but 
said it was sufficiently valid to qualify. He said the council could not 
legally make any changes before exercising its options to adopt the measure as 
an ordinance or to place it on the ballot.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RESIDENTS PROTEST REFINERY UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At an emotional special meeting of the Carson City Council, neighbors of the 
Fletcher oil refinery complained that a vacuum distillation unit, which would 
produce asphalt, threatens to add more pollution to the southwest corner of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
The $16-million unit is under construction with completion scheduled for this 
summer. It is the second phase of a refinery modernization project begun in 
1978 that was put off for years because of financial difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
Residents also complained that the original Environmental Impact Report for the 
project, written more than a decade ago, said nothing about asphalt production 
and that neighbors were not informed when Fletcher revived plans last year to 
construct the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher representatives said at the meeting that the unit will have no 
significant impact on air quality and that operating the still to make the 
heavy oil required for asphalt will result in lower air pollution than if the 
unit were used to produce high-sulfur fuel oil. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Glenn Watson said a preliminary examination of the issue indicates 
that the conditional-use permit approved for the project in 1978 remains valid. 
</P>
<P>
The council is scheduled to consider whether to require additional 
environmental reports on May 2.

MORRIS LOOKS STRONG, BUT ANGEL PITCHERS ARE STRONGER IN 1-0 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Somewhere, Cookie Rojas is reading the Angel box scores every day and waiting 
for the other shoe to drop. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the Angels have a new, bolder halo on their caps, but perhaps the former 
Angel manager is figuring these guys are truly blessed . . . or just on a roll 
that has to end. 
</P>
<P>
Can this be the same pitching staff that was 8-13 with a 5.03 earned-run 
average after 21 games last year? 
</P>
<P>
Can this be the same bullpen that blew eight of 13 save opportunities last 
April while Rojas grimaced and gnashed his teeth on the bench? 
</P>
<P>
Most of the names are the same, but the results are clearly different. 
Wednesday night in Anaheim Stadium, Chuck Finley, Greg Minton and Bryan Harvey 
combined to shut out the Tigers, 1-0, in front of 23,334. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels managed only four hits off Detroit's Jack Morris, but one of them 
was Brian Downing's third home run of the year and that was enough to send 
Morris down to his fifth consecutive loss without a victory, marking the only 
time in his career that he has been five games under .500. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a lot of good pitchers on this team that people have overlooked," 
said Harvey, who gained his fourth save of the season. "As soon as our offense 
picks up, we'll be in good shape." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey admittedly was not on the top of his game Wednesday, but he got the 
final out of the eighth inning -- after walking pinch-hitter Matt Nokes to load 
the bases -- and the last three batters he faced after yielding a leadoff 
single to pinch-hitter Pat Sheridan in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
"Harv's the kind of pitcher who has to force the ball up there," Manager Doug 
Rader said. "It's the nature of his delivery. But he's got two great pitches 
(fastball and forkball) and even when he's not perfect, he can do the job." 
</P>
<P>
But then everyone who took the mound for the Angels did his job. 
</P>
<P>
Finley, who could have sued his teammates for lack of support last season, 
might have hung around longer than six innings if the Angels had provided him 
with a bit more of a margin. The Angels scored two or fewer runs in nine of 
Finley's 15 losses last season. 
</P>
<P>
Finley did throw 103 pitches in this six-inning stint. He gave up four singles 
and a double, but scattered them nicely, allowing only one hit each in the 
second through the sixth innings. He struck out five and walked four. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't look at just the pitch count," Rader said of his decision to bring in 
Minton to pitch the seventh. "I look at how much a guy has had to pitch under 
duress. It was a close game, he was under a lot of stress and he was starting 
to get his pitches up a little." 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers didn't get a runner to second base until the fifth inning when 
catcher Mike Heath hit a single to left and stole second. Heath, who had one 
stolen base in each of the last two seasons, took off for second on a 
hit-and-run play with Torey Lovullo at the plate. Lovullo swung and missed and 
Heath stopped halfway to second, expecting to be out by 20 feet. But Lance 
Parrish dropped the ball, and, by the time he had picked it up, Heath had his 
steal for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Finley eventually walked Lovullo, but struck out Ken Williams and Gary Ward and 
got Lou Whitaker to fly to right to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit got a runner to third in the sixth. Chris Brown hit a double to 
right-center with one out and advanced to third on a groundout, but Heath flied 
out to center. 
</P>
<P>
"I had good command and I was moving it around the plate pretty good," Finley 
said. "I wanted to stay out there." 
</P>
<P>
Minton yielded a single to Ward in the seventh and then gave up back-to-back 
singles to Brown and Chet Lemon with one out. Pinch-hitter Fred Lynn belted a 
drive to deep right-center, but Claudell Washington ran it down and pitching 
coach Marcel Lachemann hustled out to the mound to signal for Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
Morris, who hasn't pitched with a lead all season, had to get pitcher of the 
game honors, though. The veteran right-hander, who is the winningest pitcher of 
the 1980s, was a little shaky in the early going, but the Angels managed only 
two hits after the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack really got in a good rhythm," Rader said. "I don't know how he got to 0-5 
because I've never seen him pitch bad. This time, he got tougher and tougher as 
the game went on. 
</P>
<P>
"Brian caught him early, when everyone was able to sit on the fastball. And 
it's a good thing he did, or this one would still be going." 
</P>
<P>
Downing, who has been hitting in the fourth spot as much as leadoff recently, 
led off the second inning with a drive to left that landed in the seats beyond 
the 370 sign in the power alley. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels had a chance to really stagger Morris in the inning. A single by 
Wally Joyner and walks to Chili Davis and Jack Howell loaded the bases with one 
out, but Glenn Hoffman grounded into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
So, while the Angel offense continues to sputter, the pitching staff is running 
on all cylinders. 
</P>
<P>
The only question now is will they begin to crumble as they did under Cookie? 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Dick Schofield, who is on the disabled list with a strain/minor tear 
of a right chest muscle, took batting practice and some ground balls Wednesday. 
Schofield said he didn't think he would be ready to play when he's eligible to 
come off the DL on Wednesday, but was hoping to make the Angels' trip to 
Baltimore, Toronto and Detroit, which begins Tuesday. Schofield says he has no 
problem fielding or swinging the bat, but still feels discomfort when throwing. 
"I threw a few across the infield and it was a little tight," he said. "Ready 
in a week? I doubt it." . . . Manager Doug Rader said he hopes to be able to 
make a decision on both Schofield and Tony Armas, who is sidelined with a 
strained hamstring, before leaving for Baltimore on Monday. "Tony's real 
close," Rader said. "It would be nice to have things settled before going on 
the trip."

MORGAN IS AT HOME ON MOUND AS DODGERS BEAT CUBS AGAIN, 3-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Memo to Century 21: Baseball nomad Mike Morgan is out of the housing market. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired of moving," said the Dodger pitcher, who will have a permanent place 
in the starting rotation if he continues to pitch as he did in the Dodgers' 3-1 
victory over the Chicago Cubs here Wednesday in Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a house in Seattle, a house in Baltimore, a house in Vegas and a 
cabin in Utah," said Morgan, who has four times as many mortgages as he had 
victories -- one -- last season with Baltimore. "I'm renting Tim Leary's house 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
If Morgan, acquired in a trade for minor league outfielder Mike Devereaux this 
spring, can resuscitate his career the same way his landlord did, the least 
Dodger General Manager Fred Claire can do is offer to make Morgan's monthly 
payments. But it's too soon, Morgan said, to be thinking about getting a place 
of his own in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I bought a house in Seattle and got traded," he said. "I bought one in 
Baltimore and got traded, too, so maybe it's a bad omen." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, there are advantages to having Leary for a landlord. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave me a good deal," said Morgan, grinning. "And he gives me a ride to the 
ballpark every day, too." 
</P>
<P>
In that vein, Manager Tom Lasorda should offer to carry Alfredo Griffin to home 
plate on his back whenever the bases are loaded. Griffin is barely hitting 
Lasorda's weight, .203, but with the bases jammed he is transformed into 
another Eddie Murray, albeit without the home run swing. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin cleared the bases in the second inning by slashing a double down the 
right-field line off previously unbeaten Rick Sutcliffe, whose bid to become 
baseball's first five-game winner this season disappeared in one bad inning. 
</P>
<P>
Since becoming a Dodger last season, Griffin has seven hits in 11 at-bats with 
the bases loaded. He also has walked twice and driven in 21 runs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm lucky with the bases loaded, I don't know," Griffin said with a shrug. "If 
I have to wait until the bases are loaded to get a hit, I'm in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Griffin was once Morgan's teammate in more troubled times for the pitcher, when 
both were in Toronto and Morgan was bouncing around the American League, trying 
to find himself. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the same guy," Griffin said. "But he's in a new league and has to prove 
himself. He knows he needs a good year." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Morgan, who is 2-1 and lowered his earned-run average to 1.08 with a 
yield of one run on five hits in seven innings, is off on the right foot. That 
foot, incidentally, which caused him to leave in the sixth inning of his 
previous start because the pain became too unbearable, held up well Wednesday, 
although Morgan wound up handling six balls hit back to him. 
</P>
<P>
"The pain is going to be the same all year," said Morgan, who has an abnormal 
bone growth in his big toe, a hereditary trait. "I just have to ice it and hope 
in a couple of days it will calm down. It's a good pain when you win, though." 
</P>
<P>
It's also a good feeling, especially for a new player, to know he's 
contributing something to the cause. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of guys' careers start out slow," Morgan said. "Mine started out slow 
and stayed real slow. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're a superstar, it's tough to stay there. When you're not, you just 
have to work hard and try to get to that level." 
</P>
<P>
Sutcliffe, a former Cy Young Award winner, is now a trimmed-down superstar, 
having dropped almost 25 pounds at the urging of Doug Collins, the Chicago 
Bulls' coach. The one-time Dodger, trying to rebound from a 13-14 record last 
season, struck out 10 and allowed only five hits in eight innings, but couldn't 
keep the Cubs from losing for the eighth time in the last nine games. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs, who had won seven straight, have scored two runs or fewer in seven of 
the last nine games. They had been blanked for 15 consecutive innings until 
singles by Ryne Sandberg and Mark Grace -- who had three hits for the second 
straight game -- produced Chicago's only run. 
</P>
<P>
Alejandro Pena, who relieved Morgan in the eighth, put two runners on but 
retired Mitch Webster on a checked-swing tapper to end the inning. In the 
ninth, Sandberg led off with a single, which prompted Lasorda to bring in Jay 
Howell. Andre Dawson, who is 0 for 8 in the series and has hit only one ball 
out of the infield, popped out on Howell's first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Grace hit a single on a 0-and-2 pitch to put runners on the corners, but Howell 
struck out Vance Law and Curtis Wilkerson to end the game and record his second 
save. 
</P>
<P>
"Their guys aren't swinging the bats real well," Griffin said. "Maybe it's just 
our pitching, but Andre and the second baseman (Sandberg) aren't really 
swinging the way we know they can." 
</P>
<P>
Griffin flashed a smile. 
</P>
<P>
"That's OK with me, though." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers have won three straight and eight of their last 10 to move two 
games above .500 for the first time this season. They have won eight in a row 
against the Cubs in Wrigley Field. The Cubs haven't beaten the Dodgers here 
since July 11, 1987, when Steve Trout shut out the Dodgers, 7-0. . . . Kirk 
Gibson, bothered by a left hamstring, sat out Wednesday's game, as did Jeff 
Hamilton, who has a sore right ankle. Mike Davis played left field and made a 
nice running catch of Mitch Webster's drive in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Murray, who had a double and a single in three at-bats, is batting .520 
in his last five games. Murray's average is up to .269, and he also deftly 
started a double play in the fifth inning. . . . Billy DeLury, the team's 
longtime traveling secretary and acknowledged as one of the best in the 
business, is resigning for personal reasons and taking a job in the club's 
ticket department. . . . Orel Hershiser, 3-1, and Greg Maddux, 0-3, are today's 
starting pitchers.

THIS IS TIME LAKERS MUST GET SERIOUS; 
</P>
<P>
PORTLAND HAS FIRST SHOT AT DEFENDING CHAMPIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Not even the Lakers, models of stability and predictability in the National 
Basketball Assn., can expect to go through a regular season without 
experiencing a few twists of fate and ankles. 
</P>
<P>
But there were enough strange and unexpected occurrences for the Lakers during 
the 1988-89 season to warrant mention in those supermarket tabloids. In fact, 
Magic Johnson recently made the cover of one such publication in a wildly 
concocted account of a love triangle involving Mike Tyson and Robin Givens. 
</P>
<P>
Fiction, though, would pale in comparison to a few of the Lakers' real problems 
this season, which could have been tabloid fodder: 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Now, though, the Lakers have made it through an anything-but-pacific division 
race and begin their first-round playoff series against the Portland Trail 
Blazers tonight at 7:30 in the Forum, seemingly in as good a shape as ever. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the strange events, the Lakers finished the season with 57 victories, 
the best record in the Western Conference, and have the home-court advantage 
against every playoff team except the Detroit Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
Their goal for this spring being a third consecutive NBA title, and a priceless 
going-away gift for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the Lakers seem more confident, 
comfortable and interested than at any point since, well, last June. 
</P>
<P>
"Things just kind of happened this year," said Byron Scott, long recovered from 
a urinary disorder but now playing with a sore wrist. "But the type of 
adversity we've faced, with injuries and perhaps not having a great attitude 
about the (regular) season, it just seems to me we were waiting for the 
playoffs to start." 
</P>
<P>
Even Riley, who has tried every motivational ploy in his repertoire to spur his 
team from November to April, now admits that all of his regular-season fretting 
was not really necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"I know this team too well," Riley said. "They have a biological clock unlike 
anyone else's in this league. . . . They are addicted to the playoffs, that 
type of competition. It is like we've been freed now. We can play. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some difficult periods, but I trust that (the players will) be there. I 
don't have any doubts in my mind anymore. I think we will win it. We'll find a 
way to get it done this year. We always do." 
</P>
<P>
No one, however, is saying it will be easy. The Lakers believe this to be an 
even tougher challenge than last season's playoff run, when three series went 
to seven games. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be the toughest playoff we've ever had in the West," Magic 
Johnson said. "A lot of teams are a lot better. This is the year you can get 
beat in any round." 
</P>
<P>
However, on paper, it appears that Portland, the Lakers' opponent in the 
best-of-five first round, shouldn't put up much resistance. 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers lost all five meetings against the Lakers this season, 
including losses in the Forum by one point in November, 13 points in January 
and 11 in February. 
</P>
<P>
History also overwhelmingly favors the Lakers in first-round matchups. In the 
last five seasons, the Lakers have recorded three-game sweeps of first-round 
opponents. The last first-round opponent to even win a game was the Trail 
Blazers in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the Lakers predict that Portland will not turn out to be another 
approximation of a first-round bye for the defending champions. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's good now," Johnson said. "You're never going to win by 25 or 40 
like we used to (in the first round). You can lose to anyone now. You can't 
think ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"Like, Detroit is not even in existence right now. Only Portland. You can't 
look past anyone, or you might get beat." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said he has maintained all season that the Trail Blazers have the talent 
to contend. But they struggled almost from the outset. At one point, four 
players expressed unhappiness and desires to be traded. And then-Coach Mike 
Schuler was engaged in a public feud with star guard Clyde Drexler. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 16, the day after Portland had lost to the Lakers by nine points at 
Portland, Schuler was fired and replaced by assistant Rick Adelman. Forward 
Kiki Vandeweghe then got his wish and was traded to the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
A disappointing 25-22 under Schuler, the Trail Blazers went only 14-21 under 
Adelman. But at least, they appear to be a happier, more cohesive team. One 
that Riley insists can give the Lakers a difficult time. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the record speaks for itself, but that's behind us," Riley said. 
"Playoff basketball is different. That 5-0 thing makes us favored, and we do 
have the home-court advantage, but I know the guys are expecting a tough 
series. They have a lot of respect for Portland. The Celtics and Trail Blazers 
are probably the two strongest eighth-playoff-spot teams in NBA history. A lot 
of people (at least one national magazine) picked Portland to win the NBA 
championship before the season. 
</P>
<P>
"They've experienced a rough season, but when you look at their roster, they 
have as much firepower as any team in the league. I mean, Clyde, we haven't 
come close to stopping him. He makes us look like children out there trying to 
guard him. And (forward Jerome) Kersey and (center Kevin) Duckworth and (point 
guard Terry) Porter, those are quality players. And they've got four good 
players off the bench." 
</P>
<P>
The way Riley sees it, Portland may be the best 39-43 team in NBA history. But 
the Trail Blazers aren't exactly blazing into the playoffs. They closed out the 
season losing four of five games and needed to go to overtime to beat the 
Sacramento Kings on the last day of the season to get the final Western 
Conference playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
As talented as the Trail Blazers may be, only Drexler has shown much in the 
five games between the team. He averaged 29.6 points, 7.2 rebounds and 6.4 
assists against the Lakers, including a 39-point performance last week in 
Portland. 
</P>
<P>
But other Trail Blazer starters have not fared well against the Lakers. Porter 
has averaged 15.5 points and 10.4 assists, but he has not exploited the Lakers' 
defensive weaknesses as he used to. 
</P>
<P>
Duckworth, who returned Sunday night after missing last week's game against the 
Lakers with strep throat, has averaged only 17.5 points and has not dominated 
Laker big men as other centers have. 
</P>
<P>
And Kersey, who missed one game against the Lakers this season while serving a 
suspension for fighting, has wilted against James Worthy. Kersey averaged 15.3 
points in the season series, Worthy 22.8. 
</P>
<P>
Riley's fear is that Duckworth, Porter and Kersey, all quality players, have 
saved their best for the playoffs. He said the Trail Blazers are at their best 
when running, but the same could be said of the Lakers. "Seventy percent of 
their offense is quick ups (fast breaks) and the passing game," Riley said. 
"They do run a few sets (of plays), but they are at their best when they run." 
</P>
<P>
Adelman, however, may harness his team on offense in hopes of doing the same to 
the Lakers. That strategy worked last season, when the Trail Blazers went 3-3 
against the Lakers in the season series. 
</P>
<P>
"No. 1, we can't let them get a quick start," Adelman told a Portland writer 
after a recent practice in San Diego. "No. 2, at their place, we want to 
eliminate their spurts. What we're really talking about is a sense of what the 
tempo of the game is. We can't get involved in taking quick shots. We'll run 
when we get the opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Drexler, basically, has roamed free against the Lakers this season. Rather than 
letting him get his points and trying to stop the other options, the Lakers say 
they want to limit Drexler, too. 
</P>
<P>
"What you've got to do with Clyde is stay in front of him," said Scott, who 
likely will draw the assignment. "He gets a lot of points away from the ball, 
so you have to make sure where he is at all times. He drives to the hole a lot, 
but we want to force him into jump shots. It won't be easy." 
</P>
<P>
Drexler may be a problem, but the Trail Blazers don't figure to be. So the 
Lakers remain cautiously optimistic, perhaps mindful of their troublesome 
regular season. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't take anything for granted anymore," Worthy said. "The league is 
better now, and that makes our job tougher. But we still have the attitude that 
we'll win." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Byron Scott slipped and fell during practice at Loyola Marymount on Wednesday 
morning and aggravated a sore right wrist that apparently has bothered him for 
some time. Scott, though, said he will play tonight. "It's something that's 
hurt me for about a month," Scott said. "At the beginning of games, the first 
two or three shots, it bothers me. But once you get into it, it goes away." . . 
. It is too late to request a schedule change, but Laker Coach Pat Riley said 
he is not happy about having two days off between Games 1 and 2. After 
tonight's game, the Lakers won't play again until Sunday. "I'd like to play 
with only one day (off) because if we win the first game, that gives them two 
days to regroup," Riley said. Likewise, there are two days off between Games 2 
and 3, when the teams travel to Portland. "I'm expecting to win the first two 
home games," Riley said. "But then, they get two days to go home and recover. 
I've always liked to play even back-to-back games at home." . . . The Trail 
Blazers practiced Tuesday and Wednesday in San Diego and arrived by bus in Los 
Angeles Wednesday afternoon. . . . Portland is hoping reserve center Sam Bowie, 
who missed 15 of the last 19 games with soreness in his right ankle, will be 
ready to play in the series. Bowie, coming back from numerous operations on 
both legs, averaged 8.6 points, 5.3 rebounds and 20 minutes playing time in 20 
games. . . . The last time the teams met in the playoffs was in the Western 
Conference semifinals in 1985. The Lakers won, four games to one.

CHARGERS' TOP PICK WON'T COME CHEAP; AGENT HOPES FOR DEAL 
</P>

<P>
Drafting players is easy. Signing them is hard. 
</P>
<P>
The early line on just how hard it will be to sign defensive end Burt Grossman, 
the eighth pick in the first round of Sunday's NFL draft, is encouraging for 
the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously I want Burt to be as well paid as possible," said Richard Woods, 
Grossman's agent. "But I also want him to be in camp on time. I think we can 
get it done." 
</P>
<P>
Woods arrived in San Diego Sunday night from his home in Mobile, Ala., just 
hours before Grossman arrived from Philadelphia. He met briefly Monday with 
Steve Ortmayer, the Chargers' director of football operations. Serious 
negotiations won't begin until later. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll do it on Steve's timetable," Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
Actually Woods has more experience negotiating for high draft picks than 
Ortmayer. Other prominent Woods clients include Raider running back Bo Jackson, 
Falcon linebacker Aundray Bruce and Buffalo linebacker Cornelius Bennett. 
Jackson (1985) and Bruce (1988) were the first players selected in their 
respective years. Bennett (1987) was second overall. 
</P>
<P>
Woods says Grossman plans to move to San Diego as soon as possible and begin 
working out with the team at its practice facility in San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium. Grossman will participate in the team's mini-camp May 8-13. But NFL 
rules prohibit him from reporting for training camp in July until he has 
signed. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman's worth to the Chargers in dollars? 
</P>
<P>
It all depends on what kind of package the Chargers and Woods structure. 
</P>
<P>
Agents generally favor short-term contracts because they believe their clients 
are better than most people realize and will prove it fast. Teams prefer 
long-term contracts for the same reason. They believe they have drafted wisely. 
And they don't want to have to renew if their No. 1 makes the Pro Bowl in his 
first or second year. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course if the player turns out to be a bust, the long-term contract hurts 
the team," Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Woods advised Bennett to sign a five-year deal that totaled $4 
million. The $1.5 million in cash the Bills were offering up front was too good 
to pass up, he reasoned. Before that, Bennett had gone through a prolonged 
holdout with the Colts, the team that drafted him, before Indianapolis traded 
him to Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson didn't even play in the NFL until 1987. By then he was a member of the 
Raiders, who had drafted him in the seventh round of the 1986 draft when most 
people believed he would never leave the Kansas City Royals. Woods got Jackson 
a five-year, $5.32 million deal with the Raiders plus a $2.1 million indemnity 
Jackson will eventually receive if he plays five years. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman will almost certainly benefit from the trickle-down effect expected to 
be caused by the $11.2 million, six-year contract signed last week by UCLA 
quarterback Troy Aikman. The Cowboys made Aikman the first pick of the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
"What the No. 8 receives is related to what the top seven receive," Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State's Tony Mandarich, chosen by Green Bay with the second selection, 
has said several times that he expects to be paid more than Aikman because he 
was rated a better athlete and a better football football player than Aikman. 
He has chosen to ignore the fact that the pay scale for quarterbacks has always 
been higher than any other position. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta's Deion Sanders, the third pick, is saying he expects $10 million over 
six years. It's not likely he'll get it. Sanders is a cornerback. The best 
Woods could do for Bruce with the Falcons last year was $4.1 million for five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"But I do think the numbers will be up," Woods said. "Mandarich and Deion have 
been very outspoken on this." 
</P>
<P>
The eighth pick in last year's draft was USC tackle Dave Cadigan, who signed a 
four-year, $2.8 million contract with the Jets. The first defensive lineman 
(second pick overall) taken in the 1988 draft was Nebraska's Neil Smith, who 
signed with the Chiefs for $3.55 million over five years. Grossman was the 
first defensive lineman drafted Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Miller, the Chargers' first-round choice last year (15th overall) 
signed a four-year, $1.775 million contract that included an $800,000 signing 
bonus. Miller didn't miss a day of practice, although he didn't agree to terms 
with the Chargers until the week before training camp opened in July. 
</P>

Back on the field, Gunther Cunningham, the Chargers' defensive line coach, said 
Grossman will line up initially at right defensive end, with Leslie O'Neal 
outside of him in a flexible, roving-type position. Lee Williams will stay at 
left end, "but the thing we'll probably do is keep each of them from playing 
the same spot all the time," Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The New York Daily News reported that Grossman underwent a battery of 
psychological tests administered to several prospective Giant draftees by Dr. 
Joel Goldberg. After the tests, Grossman told the paper: "I remember two of the 
questions. The first one was, 'Have you ever thought of killing anybody?' The 
second one was, 'Who do you respect more, a ballerina or a wrestler?' I 
answered: 'No, and the wrestler.' I think I got them both right."

NEWSWIRE: OKLAHOMA STAR PLEADS GUILTY TO DRUG CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Thompson, starting quarterback at the University of Oklahoma before his 
arrest on a federal drug charge, pleaded guilty Wednesday in Oklahoma City to 
conspiracy to distribute cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"What I did was wrong," Thompson told reporters on the courthouse steps after 
his appearance before U.S. District Judge Ralph Thompson. He apologized to his 
family, the university and to his supporters before quickly leaving with his 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, 20, was arrested Feb. 13 and accused of selling 17 grams of cocaine 
to an undercover FBI agent on Jan. 26. The judge delayed sentencing until he 
receives a report from the U.S. Probation Office. 
</P>
<P>
Maximum punishment for the charge is 20 years in prison and a $2-million fine, 
plus a special assessment fine of $50,000.

Also in the meeting at Barcelona, Spain, Primo Nebiolo, who is being

Hale Irwin sank a 40-foot eagle putt on the final hole Wednesday to gain a 
share of the first-round lead in the five-day, $1.25-million Las Vegas 
Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin's 18th-hole heroics completed a seven-under-par 65 and lifted him into a 
tie for the lead with Billy Glasson, Gene Sauers and Mike Miles, who is making 
his second try on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
"The best I've ever played," said Miles, who competed on the mini-tours for a 
couple of years after losing his tour playing rights for lack of performance in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
Sauers, a winner at Hawaii earlier this year, Irwin and Miles all played at 
Spanish Trail, one of three desert resort courses used for the first three 
rounds of this 90-hole chase for a $225,000 first prize. 
</P>
<P>
Glasson, who won at Doral in February, had his seven-under-par effort at the 
Las Vegas Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
The group at 66 included Steve Pate, Rocco Mediate, Tom Purtzer, David Peoples, 
Chris Perry, David Canipe, Mark O'Meara and South African Fulton Allem. 
</P>
<P>
Mediate, Purtzer, Pate, Peoples and Perry played at Spanish Trail. Allem, 
O'Meara and Canipe were at Las Vegas Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
Of the leaders, only Sauers and Glasson played in the afternoon when conditions 
changed dramatically. Winds increased, temperatures dropped and some desert 
showers developed. 
</P>
<P>
John Mahaffey and Tony Sills, at 67, had the best rounds at the shorter Desert 
Inn course.

GROSSMONT'S LENNON CLOSE TO NO-HITTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Earlier this season, Grossmont High's Danny Lennon pitched 5 1/3 innings of 
no-hit ball before allowing a home run to Helix's Rich Haar. Lennon then was 
replaced by Mark Gapski, and the two combined for a one-hit victory over the 
Highlanders, the defending 3-A champions. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday at Grossmont, Lennon was one inning and a few hundred feet better, 
allowing just an infield single to Santana's Drake Welch with one out in the 
sixth. Gapski pitched the seventh, and the two combined for a one-hitter 
against the Sultans, last year's 3-A runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
The 9-0 victory over Santana improved Grossmont to 11-6-1, 2-1 in the Grossmont 
2-A League. Santana fell to 9-7-1, 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
"No-hitters are a lot of luck," said Lennon, a junior right-hander. And he just 
missed being lucky. 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the sixth, Welch hit a high bouncer over the mound that second 
baseman Steve Moyer tried to field bare handed. It was a valiant but 
unsuccessful effort. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Haar, who left no doubt when he homered to break up Lennon's no-hitter 
earlier in the year, there was some question as to whether this would be ruled 
a hit. But Lennon knew. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I saw it bounce over the mound, I knew it was a hit," Lennon said. 
</P>
<P>
The irony is Welch is a good friend. "I played with him all through Little 
League," Lennon said. "After the game, he said, 'I'm sorry.' " 
</P>
<P>
Lennon (3-2) cruised through the first five innings, allowing only two fly 
balls (both by Kyle Sebach) to reach the outfield. The first four batters he 
faced (and five of the first seven) grounded to third. He ended up striking out 
six, although he walked five and hit a batter. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont got all the runs it would need in the first inning. With no outs, 
Greg Layson, Lenny Van Every and Todd Cady singled to score one run. After 
Smith's grounder to short scored another, John Eichhorst hit his fourth home 
run of the year, a two-run shot to left center. 
</P>
<P>
The Foothillers scored four more in the second on one hit, and Eichhorst hit a 
run-scoring triple to center in the fourth, giving him 16 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- JIM LINDGREN 
</P>
<P>
In another Grossmont 2-A League game: 
</P>
<P>
Valhalla 5, El Cajon Valley 4 -- Tony Clark went two for three with a three-run 
homer, his eighth, to lead the host Norsemen (10-9-1, 3-0). Clark (4-1) also 
struck out 11. Valhalla's Otavio Carrillo went two for four, including a 
bases-empty home run, and teammate Stacy Hamm was three for three with two 
doubles and two stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont 3-A League 
</P>
<P>
Helix 7, Granite Hills 6 -- The No. 6 Highlanders (15-4, 4-0) scored four runs 
in the sixth, two on a bases-loaded single by Erik West. Rob Ippolito (6-1) 
went the distance. Brian Giles had his eighth home run for Granite Hills (12-7, 
2-2). 
</P>
<P>
El Capitan 1, Monte Vista 0 -- Jim Marchesi (3-3) pitched a three-hitter 
against Monte Vista (12-5-2, 1-3). Sid Melero singled home Dan Freeman with the 
only run in the fifth for El Capitan (13-5, 3-1). 
</P>
<P>
City Eastern League 
</P>
<P>
Mira Mesa 14, Serra 2 -- Freshman Brendan Hause was four for four with four 
RBIs, including a two-run homer in the sixth, for No. 3 Mira Mesa (17-2, 9-0) 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Henry 5, Madison 2 -- Billy Hyde went the distance for the victory. 
Shannon Web was three for three, and Brian Simmons had a pair of two-run 
doubles for Patrick Henry (13-9, 6-3). 
</P>
<P>
Morse 8, Point Loma 1 -- Chris Nelson threw a six-hitter and struck out four 
while walking three for Morse (9-12, 3-6). Dave Grigsby went three for four 
with two RBIs, and Steve Smith had three doubles with two RBI and three runs 
scored. 
</P>
<P>
City Central League 
</P>
<P>
Crawford 17, San Diego 2 -- Crawford scored 10 runs in the first, only one 
earned, as the No. 5 Colts (17-3, 9-0) routed San Diego. Crawford has 53 runs 
in the past three games. Eric Turner was three for four and scored four runs, 
and Mannie Gagliano was three for four with three RBIs. A.J. Leighton (6-2) got 
the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover 11, Lincoln 10 -- Tyrone Upton had a pair of three-run homers to give 
him eight for the season to lead Hoover (10-8-1, 5-3) at home. D.C. Jacobs 
added a home run for Hoover, and Monte Smith hit a two-run homer for Lincoln 
(3-13, 1-7). 
</P>
<P>
City Western League 
</P>
<P>
Mission Bay 3, University City 1 -- Tony Lennan struck out eight and walked one 
to lead No. 4 Mission Bay (16-3, 7-1) at home. Mike McKesson's RBI single in 
the fifth was the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
USDHS 11, Kearny 1 -- David Sanchez went three for five, scored once and drove 
in a run to lead the 10th-ranked Dons (15-3, 7-1) at home. Kearny is 4-15, 2-6. 
</P>
<P>
Clairemont 4, La Jolla 3 -- Jesus Jauregui and Antione Henry hit bases-empty 
home runs for the Chieftains (5-4, 9-10) at home.

Bob Murray and Wayne Presley scored eight seconds apart to key a three-goal 
burst in the second period Wednesday night as the Chicago Blackhawks won the 
Norris Division playoff championship with a 4-2 victory over the St. Louis 
Blues. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago, outscored, 27-17, by St. Louis in eight regular-season games, won the 
best-of-seven series in five games, winning the last three games. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Manson had two assists for the Blackhawks, who had the lowest point total 
of the 16 playoff teams. Chicago will open the Campbell Conference finals 
against the Calgary Flames next week. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago, trailing 1-0, received the break it needed when Blue defenseman Glen 
Featherstone received a major penalty and game misconduct for an altercation 
with Chicago's Jeremy Roenick. 
</P>
<P>
The teams were both a player short when Murray took Manson's pass from inside 
the Chicago zone and skated in alone on St. Louis goalie Greg Millen. Eight 
seconds later, Presley scored with 10:35 to play in the second period after 
Blackhawk captain Dirk Graham stole the puck in the St. Louis zone. 
</P>
<P>
Roenick capped Chicago's three-goal spree with St. Louis a man short because of 
Featherstone's penalty, shooting off the right boards between Millen's skates 
with Blue defenseman Tom Tilley serving as a screen. 
</P>
<P>
Roenick's goal, his first of the playoffs, increased the Blackhawks' lead to 
3-1 with 7:47 to play. Tilley scored with 17:28 left on a 50-foot shot, but 
Steve Thomas scored on a breakaway for Chicago with 11:37 left.

The Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. regional selection tournament will 
be played today and Saturday at Loyola Marymount. The single-elimination 
tourney will determine an at-large entry to the men's NCAA championships. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's match-ups pit Stanford against USC at 6 and Hawaii vs. UC Santa 
Barbara at 8. The championship will be decided at 7:30 p.m. Saturday. The 
winner will join the regular-season conference champion, UCLA, in the NCAA 
final four, along with two teams from Eastern and Midwest regions. Stanford, 
which tied UCLA in the conference standings but lost a coin flip for the title, 
is the tourney's top seed. 
</P>
<P>
The WIVA is the nation's dominant volleyball conference, having produced every 
NCAA champion since a final four was started 19 years ago. The WIVA produced 27 
of the 30 members of the 1984 and 1988 U.S. Olympic teams.

CLASSIC TO CHALLENGE MIRA COSTA SPIKERS

<P>
How good is Mira Costa's volleyball team? 
</P>
<P>
Coach Mike Cook doesn't know at this point in the season, but he'll have a 
better idea after his powerful Mustangs face a competitive field in the 25-team 
Redondo/Mira Costa Varsity Classic on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll find out a little bit more about ourselves," he said. "From that 
respect, it will be a very good yardstick." 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa, ranked No. 1 in the CIF-Southern Section 4-A Division, has yet to 
be challenged. The Mustangs improved to 15-0 overall and 10-0 in the Ocean 
League with a 15-3, 15-5, 15-4 sweep over Culver City on Tuesday. They have not 
lost a game within a match. 
</P>
<P>
However, Cook points out that the Mustangs have not played a team ranked in the 
upper half of the 4-A top 10 and that two of the teams they beat early in the 
year, Loyola and Palisades, are vastly improved. Loyola won the 55-team 
Tournament of Champions last weekend at Pauley Pavilion.

Saturday's tournament at Redondo will provide Mira Costa with its toughest 
competition to date. The field includes three teams that trail the Mustangs in 
the 4-A Top 10: No. 4 Corona del Mar, No. 6 University of Irvine and No. 7 
Loyola; six teams ranked in the 3-A Top 10: No. 1 Harvard, No. 2 Brentwood, No. 
3 Arcadia, No. 4 Glendale, No. 6 Long Beach Wilson and No. 8 Los Altos; and the 
L.A. City Section's top team, Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be fired up for the tournament," Cook said. "It represents the best 
practice for us going into the CIF playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Cook said he increased the intensity of Mira Costa's practices this week in 
hope of getting his players ready for the start of the playoffs May 12, after a 
relatively easy league schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not pushed them too hard up to this point," he said. "I didn't want 
them to peak too soon, and we certainly haven't done that." 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa has received stellar play recently from middle blocker Pat Ivie, a 
6-5 junior and the brother of USC standout Bryan Ivie. The balanced Mustangs 
also have gotten steady efforts from setters Craig Adamoli, Jason Stimpfig and 
Canyon Ceman, outside hitters Scott Stoops, David Swatik and Kevin Burd and 
middle blockers Zach Small and Greg Shankle, a 6-7 senior who has signed with 
Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
Terrence Stevens, a 6-4 outside hitter who was out for three weeks with an 
injured back, has returned. 
</P>
<P>
Cook says his team's ability to compete against tougher competition depends on 
how hard the Mustangs work at it. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to keep improving in practice to have the ability to beat these 
teams," he said. "We must have intense practices. This is a serious time." 
</P>
<P>
Five five-team pools will begin play at 9 a.m. in the boys and girls gyms at 
Redondo. The top two finishers in each pool and the top two third-place teams 
advance to the single-game playoffs in the afternoon, leading to the 
championship match at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
With 10 players batting over .300, El Segundo's baseball team entered the week 
boasting the most balanced lineup in the South Bay. There's not an easy out in 
the bunch. 
</P>
<P>
Several younger players -- junior catcher Garret Quiantance and sophomore first 
baseman Dan Manjarrez -- have emerged as stars. But it has been the surprising 
play of several seniors that has helped El Segundo climb to the No. 2 ranking 
in the CIF-Southern Section 2-A Division. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a group every year that we call the Hungry Seniors," said assistant 
coach Craig Cousins. "Coming into the season, we didn't know if they would play 
or not. But they've pulled us together." 
</P>
<P>
The group consists of left fielder Jeremy Carr, third baseman Chris Lane, 
second baseman Pat Llamas and pitcher Rick Clark. All were considered question 
marks because they lacked varsity experience. Carr, Lane and Llamas played on 
the junior varsity last season, and Clark sat out with an arm injury. 
</P>
<P>
Now they are among El Segundo's steadiest performers. Clark brought a 6-0 
record into Wednesday night's game with Bosco Tech, Carr hit a three-run homer 
Saturday in a 5-3 win over Gahr, Lane drove in the go-ahead run in last week's 
8-4 triumph over Serra and Llamas, along with Lane, has been a defensive 
mainstay in the infield. 
</P>
<P>
The other senior in the starting lineup, center fielder Erik Evans, wasn't a 
surprise. The only returning starter from last year, Evans has played with the 
same consistency he displayed as a star running back on the football team and a 
dependable guard in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"They five are the key," Cousins said. "They provide leadership for the juniors 
and sophomores." 
</P>
<P>
Quiantance has performed admirably in his first season as El Segundo's catcher. 
He leads the team with a .493 batting average (34 for 69) and has played well 
defensively. 
</P>
<P>
As good as Quiantance is, however, the Eagles might have a different man behind 
the plate next season. 
</P>
<P>
Cousins said Jeff Poor, a 6-1, 190-pound freshman, is practicing with the 
varsity and could force the Eagles to move Quiantance to another position. 
</P>
<P>
"He looks like a prospect," Cousins said of Poor. "He has a very good arm. He 
doesn't know how to hit yet, but with his power he gets the ball way out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Another star on El Segundo's freshman team, which carried a 15-0 record into 
this week, is left-handed pitcher Tracy McAndrews. 
</P>
<P>
Six members of the Hawthorne boys track team will run in the prestigious Penn 
Relays in Philadelphia on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougar contingent of Curtis Conway, Anthony Smith, Chris Alexander, Kevin 
Gatlin, Ismael Delpino and Erik Allen will face some of the nation's finest 
prep athletes in the 400- and 1,600-meter relays. The meet features athletes 
from 600 high schools, including 40 schools from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Hawthorne's relay teams swept their races at the Mt. San Antonio 
College Relays. The 400 team of Alexander, Smith, Allen and Conway won in 41.12 
seconds and the 1,600 team of Smith, Gatlin, Delpino and Conway won in 3:15.81. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars return to practice Monday in preparation for next week's Bay League 
prelims, the first of six meets leading to the state championships June 3. 
Hawthorne has won two straight state titles and five of the last six. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Star baseball Coach Frank Ponce De Leon complained last week that his 
team, which leads the Santa Fe League, was not ranked in the Southern Section 
2-A Division Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
"It's disappointing to pick up the paper and have the kids ask why we are not 
ranked," he said after Mary Star defeated 10th-ranked Miraleste, 6-3, on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Stars can stop asking. They cracked the Top 10 this week, moving into the 
No. 8 spot. 
</P>
<P>
PREP NOTES -- Palos Verdes distance runner Ashley Black and Miraleste tennis 
player Kimberly Po are among 10 finalists for the state high school 
Scholar-Athlete of the Year award. They were chosen from 450 candidates 
throughout California who were nominated by their school principals. Winners 
will be announced May 8. . . . Rolling Hills swingman John Hardy has been 
offered a basketball scholarship by the University of Pacific, which he visited 
two weeks ago, but is weighing his options. . . . The South Bay unit of the 
California Basketball Officials Assn. was well represented at the CIF Southern 
Section finals and state tournament. Officials recognized for excellence were 
Bill Agopian and Sylvester White, who worked the Southern Section boys finals; 
Ken Wilson and Chad Brown, who worked the girls finals; and Michael Barnes, Ken 
Greenleaf and Gary Bonneville, who worked the state finals.

PRATT STEPS FROM A COURTROOM TO A FORMULA CAR, REVS UP AND REDISCOVERS THE 
THRILLS OF HIS YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William Pratt, attorney at law, felt the perspiration running freely over his 
body. His expensive suit was soaked with sweat. He was just seconds away from 
making the most important opening statement of his life before the most 
critical jury he had ever encountered. 
</P>
<P>
If he was successful, he would feel as though he had conquered the world. If he 
was unsuccessful, he might have to be carted away in an ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
The statement that Pratt planned to make was something like this: You will not 
get to that turn before I do. I will keep my foot firmly upon the gas pedal and 
I will not back down. My car will be on your car like fur on a weasel. And if 
we both crash and die, so be it. 
</P>
<P>
This, of course, is not the type of opening statement made by a typical lawyer 
in a courtroom. Pratt, however, is not a typical lawyer. And he was not in a 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
He was heading into Turn 5 at the Willow Springs International Raceway in the 
Mojave Desert, strapped into a small car that was hurtling towards a sharp turn 
at 90 m.p.h., belching smoke and fire. 
</P>
<P>
The expensive suit Pratt was wearing was not the traditional attorney garb, 
either. This tailored beauty was fireproof, for one thing, and had a Pennzoil 
patch sewn over one breast and one that read, "Earl's Racing Equipment" over 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
And attorneys don't regularly wear long underwear, fireproof booties and 
helmets into court. 
</P>
<P>
And the jury who would judge his performance did not sit meekly in a jury box. 
They stood in the grandstands and bellowed, trying to be heard above the 
deafening roar of automobile engines gone mad. 
</P>
<P>
On most days, Pratt toils long hours in his downtown law office, preparing 
suits and countersuits and settlements between angry people. But since early in 
1988, Pratt has left his legal briefcases stashed in his office on many Friday 
nights and headed for a race track, where he exchanges his Brooks Brothers suit 
for one that offers a bit more protection. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to do everything you can to make sure you don't get turned into a 
crispy critter out on the track," said Pratt, 41, who lives in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Pratt's interest in driving automobiles at fairly ridiculous speeds began 
early, at the age of 16. He said he did his best to turn the streets of Joliet, 
Ill., into pavement that was best crossed quickly by pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe I was a real, legitimate danger to the community," he said. "Back 
then I believed every corner was designed to be negotiated at a very high rate 
of speed, that there wasn't much of a reason to go around a corner if you 
didn't slide all four tires through it and leave some marks behind on the 
road." 
</P>
<P>
He drove in a few real races with midget cars, but soon college beckoned and 
then law school and the teen-age exuberance and thrill-seeking life of Rushing 
Roulette was tucked away. 
</P>
<P>
He established his law office in Los Angeles and went about the rather dreary 
business of dividing the goodies in marriages gone bad, collecting lost wages 
for workers injured in accidents and basically doing his part to make sure the 
judicial system didn't develop much free time. 
</P>
<P>
Good work if you can get it. But this did not exactly provide that kind of 
chased-by-a-crazed-grizzly-bear kind of excitement he had loved as a young boy. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, he ventured to the Ontario Motor Speedway with a friend, and instantly 
realized that his adrenal gland had not withered and died. It had just been 
resting. 
</P>
<P>
"It all came back to me, the rush of excitement, as soon as I saw the stock 
cars racing," Pratt said. "We had a chance to walk through the pits before the 
race and I got to sit in Al Unser's car. By the time the racing began, all I 
could do was sit there and wonder, 'How do I get started?' " 
</P>
<P>
There was no answer to his question, and he said he gave up the idea soon 
thereafter, burying himself once again in his expanding law practice. 
</P>
<P>
Nine years later, however, the dream returned. He accompanied a racing friend 
to the Willow Springs track in Rosamond, outside of Lancaster, and was asked if 
he'd like to drive a car around the track a few times. Before you could say, 
"faulty head gasket," Pratt was diving into a fireproof suit and climbing into 
the car. 
</P>
<P>
"During the first lap, as soon as I felt the G-forces pulling at me and felt 
that same wild sense of speed, I thought to myself, 'This might not be too 
smart,' " Pratt recalled. "But after that first lap, my apprehension 
disappeared. And I was hooked." 
</P>
<P>
Pratt enrolled in a race-driving school and early in 1988, he obtained his 
racing license from the Sports Car Club of America. He immediately purchased a 
Formula Ford racing car, an open-wheel vehicle with a maximum speed of about 
150 m.p.h. He competed several times during the year in amateur races. He 
finished no better than seventh -- but no worse than 10th -- in any of them. 
</P>
<P>
His car, a Formula Ford Crossle which was not the newest generation of Formula 
Fords on the racing circuits, cost Pratt about $15,000 but was heavily 
out-powered by newer products in the Formula Ford line, most notably the 
Reynard and Swift, which can cost up to $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I competed against cars that were, without question, a notch above mine," said 
Pratt, who estimates he spent as much as $70,000 during the year for the car, 
parts, and a truck and trailer-workshop to transport the car to races and make 
the constant repairs and adjustments necessary to race. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though I didn't win anything, I felt good about my first year. I competed 
with better cars, stayed with them and didn't get blown away by them. I stayed 
alongside a lot of cars with veteran drivers and better machines." 
</P>
<P>
The confidence he gained helped Pratt make a major leap during the winter. He 
purchased a much more powerful Formula Atlantic car -- a vehicle that is a 
near-replica of the famous Indianapolis-type cars -- and plans to make the 
sizeable jump in class within a few months. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlantic car cost Pratt $30,000. He still has the Formula Ford racing 
machine and plans to race it a few more times before jumping full time to the 
Atlantic series of road racing. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I was pretty close to the maximum that my Formula Ford could achieve," 
Pratt said. "Being around the Atlantic cars all the time, I just wanted to 
drive one and get involved in pro racing and a higher level of racing. You hear 
an Atlantic car go by and you just know that that is what a race car is 
supposed to sound like. It's just a perfect car." 
</P>
<P>
His pursuits have not left Pratt with a perfect checking account, however. 
</P>
<P>
"Honestly, I don't know how much I spent last year on racing," he said. "I do 
know I spent about everything that I earned in the law practice. If I looked at 
it from a financial point, I certainly wouldn't do it. But the only thing I can 
think about when I'm not racing is making enough money to go racing again. It 
just draws me." 
</P>
<P>
Pratt has begun searching for a sponsor for his racing efforts in a belief that 
a little help will carry him far in racing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think someone will see the opportunity," Pratt said. "I know I can race. I 
know that I have what it takes to succeed at this. And if I can attract a 
sponsor, someone to help me out with tires and fuel and room and board on the 
road, I believe I can carry this effort a long way." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he will continue to fund his own unusual leap from a world in 
which his colleagues have manicured fingernails and talk law, to a world in 
which his colleagues have nicks and cuts and grease on their fingers and talk 
wrench. 
</P>
<P>
He likes the first world, he said, but loves the second. 
</P>
<P>
"People in racing are a pretty nice group of people," Pratt said. "They all 
have their fun with me when they find out I'm a lawyer, though. They tell about 
every lawyer joke ever known to man." 
</P>
<P>
"At first they all looked at me like, 'Oh, no! What are you doing in this?' 
They figured I was just some guy with money who was going to come out and be 
some goofy kind of Walter Mitty-type character. But I got past that stuff 
pretty fast. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I know they don't think of me as a lawyer. To them, I'm just another guy 
they have to pound wheels with around a turn."

BUILDING HOPES FOR THE FUTURE; 
</P>
<P>
RANGE OF PROMOTERS WOULD WELCOME ARENA AT CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Experts in the professional sports and entertainment industries reacted 
enthusiastically Wednesday to news that construction of a multiple-purpose 
arena at Cal State Northridge is under serious consideration. 
</P>
<P>
They also predicted the venture would succeed at the game, an area in which the 
school's athletic teams are likely to initially struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge officials are in the process of compiling information on the past 
ticket and concession sales of the school's athletic events for use in a 
feasibility study on the proposed complex. 
</P>
<P>
The Ogden Corp., a New-York based conglomerate with management ties to several 
major sports facilities nationwide, has agreed to conduct the study, The Times 
reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The final revenue numbers, CSUN administrators believe, will not be impressive. 
Matador basketball and volleyball teams have rarely come close to filling the 
school's 3,000-seat gymnasium that has served as their home court. 
</P>
<P>
That trend will change, it is hoped, when Northridge begins playing against 
Division I teams beginning in September, 1990. The Matadors currently play at 
the Division II level. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have a solid, winning program, people will support it," said Bob 
Hiegert, CSUN's athletic director. "If we don't they won't. That's the way it 
is in this town." 
</P>
<P>
Until the Matadors are competitive at Division I, income from sources such as 
concerts, professional sporting events and a variety of other events would be 
relied upon to generate operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Murphy, president of Avalon Attractions, one of the busiest concert 
promoters in Southern California, estimated that his company might book "six to 
12 shows a year" at such an arena, provided the size of the facility was 
suitable. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this venue can look to compete with the Forum and the Sports 
Arena and the 16,000 seats they have for concerts," Murphy said. "But if they 
had a medium-sized place, in the 9,000 to 10,000-seat range, I think we could 
pull some business in their direction." 
</P>
<P>
The size of the proposed complex has not been determined, but administrators at 
CSUN had originally favored an arena with 8,000 to 12,000 seats. Ogden 
officials are thought to favor something in the 15,000 to 20,000-seat range. 
</P>
<P>
Including the surrounding areas of the Simi, Conejo and Santa Clarita valleys 
and Glendale, the Valley area has a population base of more than 2 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Universal Amphitheatre, with a capacity of about 6,000, is host of the 
Valley-area's largest concerts. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said he believes rock-and-roll groups would find a Northridge site 
particularly attractive. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of rock-and-roll acts just play the Long Beach Arena, but I think if 
there was something in the Valley they'd play both," Murphy said. "They could 
get two dates instead of one and avoid the basin entirely." 
</P>
<P>
There is little chance, Murphy said, that a group would book concert nights at 
large facilities in both the Valley and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Acts that come to L.A. want to sell out," he said. "I don't think Cal State 
Northridge is going to compete with the Forum and the Sports Arena because of 
their central location and history." 
</P>
<P>
In the area of family entertainment, a Northridge site would be virtually 
without competition, said Tom Abramson, marketing director for the Ice Capades 
and Harlem Globetrotters. 
</P>
<P>
"The Valley is a market that is completely untouched," Abramson said. "There's 
the (Hollywood) Bowl and the Amphitheatre but neither one of those venues lends 
itself to a production of our magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
"I know we'd look seriously at the possibility of playing there. I think every 
major show would." 
</P>
<P>
While the Globetrotters usually play two nights at a site, the Ice Capades has 
a normal run of six consecutive nights and might sell close to 100,000 tickets 
depending on the site. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, we've been saying among ourselves that we wish there was another 
place that we could play in this locale," Abramson said. "The L. A. market can 
bear it without question. And it's a natural flow from a tour's point of view 
-- they do Anaheim, L. A. proper and the Valley, then slide right up to Fresno, 
the Bay and Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
An arena might also draw interest from professional sports teams. The Clippers 
have shown some interest and team president Alan Rothenberg had an informal 
meeting with CSUN administrators earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Goossen, manager of boxer Michael Nunn, the International Boxing Federation 
middleweight champion, said he would like to prove boxing can be successful in 
the Valley on a large scale. 
</P>
<P>
"The Valley is where I want to be and I know a place like that can succeed out 
here," said Goossen, whose organization promotes fight cards at the Reseda 
Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
"Let the people in Inglewood be the ones who have to get on the freeway."

CITY SECTION CANCELS GRANT-RESEDA GAME IN WAKE OF BRAWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Section has canceled today's Valley Pac-8 Conference baseball game 
between Grant High and Reseda as a result of a bench-clearing brawl that ended 
Tuesday's game between the same teams in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the status of Tuesday's game, won by Grant, 13-1, in five innings, 
remains in doubt pending a decision by City Section Commissioner Hal Harkness. 
</P>
<P>
Under City Section rules, the game could be ruled a loss for both teams or be 
rescheduled. In addition, the City could suspend players who participated in 
the fight for the remainder of the season. Harkness declined comment Wednesday, 
saying he will rule after examining written reports submitted by both schools 
and the game umpires. 
</P>
<P>
The fight began at the conclusion of the fifth inning at Reseda after Grant's 
Stanley Spancer and Reseda's Rod Stricklin exchanged words. Grant is 11-4 
overall and 8-3 and tied for second place in the East Valley League with Poly, 
a game behind Sylmar. Reseda is 4-11, 1-10.

PUBLISHERS MORE WILLING TO INNOVATE;

<P>
NEWSPAPERS FEAR BEING BYPASSED BY ADVERTISERS

<P>
Like a flu that won't go away, a deep foreboding is again settling over the 
nation's publishers about the future of the daily American newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The advertising structure is changing. Readership is declining. 
</P>
<P>
And now, as publishers concluded their annual convention here Wednesday, 
concern is rising that a significant number of advertisers increasingly are 
using new technology to sell their products directly to consumers -- bypassing 
traditional advertising media altogether. 
</P>
<P>
The term "bypass" is even becoming a buzz word for lost advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
In reaction, publishers themselves seem more willing to explore innovation. 
They recognize that their ability to reap ever higher profits from building 
circulation and raising advertising rates is no longer working. 
</P>
<P>
As consultant Christine Urban told the American Newspaper Publishers Assn. 
meeting, newspapers are "severely threatened for share of mind, share of 
market, share of future." 
</P>
<P>
"There is a strong underlying concern in the industry today," said Tom Johnson, 
publisher of The Times, "about declining readership and the threat of bypass." 
</P>
<P>
It is a change of mood for publishers who seemed buoyant at their convention 
only two years ago, when videotext -- the idea of an electronic newspaper sent 
each morning to readers equipped with special computer terminals -- failed to 
materialize. 
</P>
<P>
With the boom during much of the 1980s, said Cox Newspapers President David 
Easterly, many publishers got "fat, dumb and happy." 
</P>
<P>
But it was made clear this week that now there are other problems. And they 
don't come only from readers wanting new ways of getting information. 
</P>
<P>
It is coming from bypass, the loss of advertising to direct marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the case of Kimberly-Clark, maker of Huggies disposable diapers. The 
company recently spent $3.5 million to develop a database that identifies 75% 
of the new mothers in America. The system contains not only their identities 
but their demographic characteristics and a history of what kinds of products 
they buy. 
</P>
<P>
With that knowledge in hand, Kimberly-Clark can start building the personal 
loyalty of those consumers -- through educational pamphlets, discounts, and 
other telephone and direct-mail customer services. The company hopes to create 
the kind of personal relationship that Americans once had with local merchants 
in the days before national chains and suburban malls. 
</P>
<P>
In turn, as the children of those mothers grow older, the database will allow 
the company to sell products through campaigns that will be more tightly 
targeted and cost-efficient than through traditional advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"We can no longer dismiss direct marketing as junk mail," said Hearst President 
Frank Bennack. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Direct Mail Booming 
</P>
<P>
Rather, it is coupons and catalogue sales, point-of-sale promotion and 
telemarketing. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, these techniques have grown so fast, according to Bennack's figures, 
that direct mail now represents 14% of all advertising, and catalogue sales 10% 
of all retail sales. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the average American received three direct marketing solicitations 
each day, and half of all adults ordered something via mail. 
</P>
<P>
The growth will slow in the next five years. Still, telemarketing is expected 
to grow by 20% and direct mail by 11%, while traditional media, such as 
newspapers, television and magazine advertising, will grow by only 7%, Bennack 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And now, with deregulation, the regional "Baby Bell" telephone companies are 
seeking to move into electronic publishing and direct marketing, a specter that 
particularly worries publishers because the phone companies control the lines 
of communications. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, for example, New York Telephone announced a system that will connect 
anyone with a personal computer and a telephone to services offering everything 
from excerpts of USA Today and Newsday to stock quotes and home shopping. 
</P>
<P>
These factors are combining with more familiar pressures on newspapers. The 
industry has suffered a recession for more than a year now, in part because 
mergers resulted in a significant consolidation in the retail department 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
Not only has fewer retailers meant less advertising, but the survivors now 
carry so much debt that they have scaled back their ad budgets. Also, national 
advertising has never fully recovered from the recession of the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
And readership is still falling, particularly among young adults. In 1967, 
according to industry figures, 60% of people aged 18 to 29 read newspapers. By 
1986, that number had fallen to 33%. 
</P>
<P>
In response, some newspapers are now trying to use the same technology that is 
threatening their base. Some are experimenting with making their movie reviews 
available by telephone. Readers call in and get the review and show times for 
any movie they want, using the technology made possible by touch-tone phones 
and computer circuitry. 
</P>
<P>
The Providence (R.I.) Journal has several such phone services, including Soap 
Opera Updates, which offers a plot summary of the soaps in case a viewer missed 
an episode. And these are designed to work with the newspaper: Consumers must 
check the paper to get the daily access code for Soap Opera Update. 
</P>
<P>
The Ft. Worth Star-Telegram sells its wire service to readers via computer for 
less than $10 a month, and some papers are considering making their classified 
ad listings available by computer in a way that they are instantly up to date. 
Consumers don't have to wait for the next day's paper. 
</P>
<P>
The Boulder (Colo.) Daily Camera's Infocall service lets readers get sports and 
other information over the phone. Although the paper itself has only 30,000 
subscribers, it gets more than 77,000 calls on the service each month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Marginal Improvements 
</P>
<P>
And some papers, such as the Hartford Courant in Connecticut, are experimenting 
with making their next day's paper available by fax machine the afternoon 
before. 
</P>
<P>
But all of these are marginal improvements. More must be done, publishers 
believe, to change the basic product of the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Today, with rising immigrant populations, ethnic diversity and greater market 
segmentation in general, there are "fundamentally new markets that need 
fundamentally new newspapers," said consultant Urban. 
</P>
<P>
Even these, however, may not address the problem of bypass. For the economics, 
at least for now, favor the new direct marketing techniques. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of newspaper advertising, for instance, is rising at a much higher 
rate than the cost of direct marketing. Newspaper and TV advertising rates have 
risen 54% since 1982, well above inflation, Bennack said. Telephone marketing, 
meanwhile, has actually gotten cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
Direct marketing also aids consumers who "want help sorting through the 
clutter" of ever more confusing information and an increasing proliferation of 
products to buy, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
One of the audio-visual presentations that publishers saw this week said it 
simply. "Once life was simple," it began. "Those good old days are long gone."

UNITED WILL BUY 370 BOEING JETS FOR $15.74 BILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT E. DALLOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
United Airlines ordered $15.74 billion worth of airplanes Wednesday, the 
biggest order by an airline in U.S. commercial aviation history, and handed 
Boeing Co. its largest single chunk of business ever. 
</P>
<P>
The order by United, which has lagged behind its competitors in acquiring new 
aircraft and has lost business as a result, is for 370 Boeing jets. It includes 
120 firm orders and 130 options on Boeing 737 aircraft and 60 firm orders and 
60 options for Boeing 757s. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen M. Wolf, chairman and president of the airline and UAL Inc., its 
parent, acknowledged at a news conference in Chicago that United had lost 
ground in the marketplace and said the purchase marks a commitment to "grow and 
compete in vigorous fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"For some years United has not been growing while the industry has been 
growing, which is a nice way of saying we have been losing market share," said 
Wolf. "This (order) will stop that erosion of market share and put us back in a 
vigorous growth mode." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Into Next Century 
</P>
<P>
Wolf said the new orders will take care of United's narrow-body fleet needs 
into the next century, and promised that the airline will take action "shortly" 
to complete the modernization of the its wide-body fleet. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have one of the newest, most modern fleets in aviation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing Chairman Frank Shrontz, who joined Wolf to announce the mammoth order, 
called it the largest order to a single aircraft manufacturer in history. 
</P>
<P>
United is Boeing's largest jet customer. The Chicago-based carrier got its 
first jet from Boeing 32 years ago, Shrontz said, and has since purchased 898 
Boeing jet aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The order placed Wednesday comes only a week after the GPA Group Ltd., an Irish 
aircraft leasing firm, placed orders for 308 aircraft from Boeing, McDonnell 
Douglas Corp. and the European consortium Airbus Industrie. That order, of 
which $9.4 billion was to Boeing, totaled $17 billion, making it the largest 
order in terms of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defense Industry Decline 
</P>
<P>
The cascade of commercial orders placed with Boeing and McDonnell Douglas could 
go a long way in offsetting the decline in defense industry sales as the 
Pentagon trims its budget. Not every aerospace contractor participates in the 
commercial aircraft industry, but such firms as Northrop, General Dynamics, 
Allied-Signal Aerospace, General Electric and United Technologies will share in 
the commercial boom. 
</P>
<P>
For Boeing, the order was the best news yet in what is developing into another 
banner year. The Seattle-based manufacturer has reported total jetliner orders 
of 499 valued at $26.5 billion so far this year, compared with 170 orders worth 
$7.5 billion at the same time last year. 
</P>
<P>
For all of last year it won a record 636 orders for new jetliners, which was a 
74% increase over 1987. Boeing's total backlog for all models is 1,519. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to committing the airline to expansion, United's giant order 
apparently resolves some of the differences the airlines had with its pilots 
union. The pilots have been working without a contract for over a year and 
talks with the carrier are being conducted by a Federal mediator. 
</P>
<P>
The pilots in 1987 forced the corporation, then known as Allegis Corp., to 
begin divesting itself of hotel properties and of its Hertz car rental company 
so it could devote its attention to the airline business. It was instrumental 
in ousting the management at that time. 
</P>
<P>
Hans J. Plickert, an airline specialist with The Transportation Group, a 
corporation affiliated with the New York brokerage house of Paine Webber, said 
United's slow aircraft acquisition program created problems for pilots because 
their advancement was "stymied." It has been impossible, he said, for co-pilots 
to advance into the captain's seat. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very pragmatic issue," he said. "This affected their job 
opportunities and their pay. These guys were just plain frustrated. Now the 
logjam at United in terms of promotion will be broken." 
</P>
<P>
Wolf said: "I felt that we needed to unilaterally demonstrate to our pilots a 
very firm commitment to our returning to the core business, that we intend to 
grow. We needed to demonstrate that in a very solid fashion. From their 
perspective we have been remiss for a number of years. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the United local of the Air Line Pilots Assn., James A. Damron, 
said: "We are delighted. We think the announcement is long overdue." 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Decker, an airline specialist with the Chicago firm of Duff &amp; 
Phelps, said the orders might be too late and could create an oversupply 
capacity for United. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears too late in the economic cycle for an expansion," he said. "An 
economic downturn now becomes much riskier." 
</P>
<P>
Wolf said that although United currently owns about 80% of its fleet, the plan 
was to lease aircraft for all of this year. United might then return to buying 
planes, and expects no difficulties financing them. 
</P>
<P>
With the orders announced Wednesday, as well as the Boeing 747-400s, 737-300s 
and 757s ordered earlier by United, the airline has 469 new aircraft on order 
or option -- more than its entire current fleet of 412 planes. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf said that there would be an "orderly" phaseout of of the older planes as 
the new ones are delivered. However, the overall fleet will be expanded. As a 
result, he said, United's fleet would grow significantly. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the average age of United's fleet, currently 13.5 years and one of 
the oldest in the industry, would decline fairly rapidly. Currently the 
industry average age of planes is 11.7. Eastern Airlines has the oldest fleet 
at 14.6 years while Delta Airlines has the youngest at 8.5 years. 
</P>
<P>
The firm orders for 737 models will be delivered between July of 1991 and July 
of 1995 and the options, if they are taken, between 1995 and 1998. They will be 
powered by engines made by General Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
The 757 firm orders will be delivered between February, 1991, and August, 1993, 
and the options will be delivered between August, 1993, and February, 1996. 
They will be powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney engines.

BATTLE OVER DAVIS' CONFIDENTIAL PLANS MAY STALL NWA BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Minnesota state official Wednesday threatened to derail Marvin Davis' 
$2.7-billion bid for NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest Airlines, unless Davis 
turns over what the billionaire called confidential information. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce Commissioner Michael A. Hatch gave Davis until today to provide 
details on his plans for the airline. If Davis fails to comply, he will be 
barred from purchasing shares from Minnesota residents. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' attorneys continued to negotiate with state leaders late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to determine if there is any information we can give (Hatch) 
that will satisfy his concerns, short of confidential projections," said George 
A. Vandeman, a partner with Latham &amp; Watkins in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The threat by Minnesota's commerce commissioner is the latest in a series of 
hometown actions directed at Davis' hostile bid for the airline, which is based 
in Eagan, Minn., a Minneapolis suburb. 
</P>
<P>
The state legislature is considering measures that would tax so-called golden 
parachutes, the large financial settlements commonly made to top executives who 
are fired after a hostile takeover. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the legislature is considering "tin parachutes" for employees 
who are fired after a hostile takeover of a Minnesota company. The "tin 
parachutes" would require an employer to pay fired workers for a full year. 
</P>
<P>
If wasn't clear how Davis' tender offer would be affected if he failed to 
comply with Hatch's order. Vandeman said that relatively few shares were held 
by Minnesota residents, even though about one-third of total shareholders 
reside in the state. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hatch said he believed that Davis' bankers might be reluctant to 
finance a tender offer with so many potential legal difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
The Minnesota law has already survived one legal challenge. Four years ago, a 
federal appeals court in St. Louis upheld the law, ruling against Cardiff 
Acquisitions Inc., a La Jolla firm that wanted to take over office furniture 
maker Conwed Corp., then based in Minnesota. Conwed eventually accepted a 
sweetened offer. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, the Los Angeles oilman and real estate investor, has launched a hostile 
$90-a-share cash offer for NWA, and is fighting to replace NWA's board with his 
own slate. On Wednesday, he mailed NWA shareholders proxy materials that urged 
a vote for his board nominees. In a letter to shareholders, Davis wrote: "The 
only way to keep the pressure on the NWA board to produce a sale of NWA is to 
elect our slate of director nominees who are committed . . . to a sale of NWA." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reviewing Options 
</P>
<P>
NWA, which has rejected Davis' offer, has said that it is reviewing its 
options, including a sale of the entire company, a special dividend to 
shareholders or a partial repurchase of its stock. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to NWA Chairman Steven G. Rothmeier, Davis reminded Rothmeier that 
the company's board promised to favor an all-cash offer: "We do not expect to 
see the board favor over our bid either a third-party offer that forces NWA's 
stockholders to accept securities, or a recapitalization that leaves 
stockholders with . . . diluted equity." 
</P>
<P>
The letter was disclosed Wednesday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. Also on Wednesday, Davis filed with the SEC documents that extend 
the date for a consent proxy solicitation until June 24. The consent 
solicitation gives Davis the right to try to unseat NWA's board if he loses his 
proxy fight. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Minnesota have raised questions about whether Davis can actually 
expand Northwest Airlines, as he has promised, and finance the acquisition by 
taking on a huge $2.4-billion debt. Hatch, the commerce secretary, said that 
NWA's cash flow, totaling $600 million last year, isn't great enough to pay 
interest on NWA's debt and buy new aircraft. "The figures don't add up," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Vandeman, the attorney for Davis, said Hatch is wrong. He declined to provide 
details, however. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than turn over confidential financial documents to Minnesota officials, 
Davis submitted on Tuesday sworn statements from four experts who reviewed 
Davis' plans for Northwest, and found them sound. "We thought that would be 
persuasive," said Vandeman. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the four experts were Davis advisers. They are Josiah O. Low III, a 
senior vice president at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities in New 
York; David Batchelder, a La Jolla financial adviser, and James Kneser, a 
senior vice president with Davis Cos. The fourth expert was an accountant with 
the firm Peat Marwick Main, which is not involved with Davis.

COMP CARE TO BE ACQUIRED FOR $130 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHARLES TIGHE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Comprehensive Care Corp. of Irvine, the nation's largest provider of 
hospital-based drug and alcohol treatment services through its Care Unit 
subsidiary, said Wednesday that it will be acquired for about $130 million. 
</P>
<P>
The financially struggling firm is being acquired by First Hospital Corp. of 
Norfolk, Va., a smaller hospital company that plans to move Comp Care's 
200-employee headquarters from Orange County to Norfolk. 
</P>
<P>
The combination, subject to approval of shareholders and regulators, would make 
privately held First Hospital the majority owner in a new public company to be 
called FHC Comp Care. 
</P>
<P>
Comp Care operates its CareUnit alcohol and drug dependency programs under 
contract at 170 hospitals across the country. The firm also owns 23 hospitals 
in 10 states, including three Orange County facilities in Brea, Orange and 
Costa Mesa. The firm reported revenue of $211.2 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
Founded six years ago, First Hospital is less than half the size of Comp Care 
based on revenue. The firm reported revenue of $86.1 million and net income of 
$7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said major changes have long been needed for Comp Care, which has 
suffered financially as shorter patient stays and increased competition have 
cut into business. The firm's earnings fell to $9 million for the fiscal year 
ended May 31, 1988, from $17.2 million in 1985 . 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Debt Sharply Higher 
</P>
<P>
The company's debt has increased dramatically in recent years, reflecting an 
aggressive expansion program involving construction of 14 hospitals from 1982 
through 1987. Cash reserves have declined, in part because Comp Care spent $60 
million to buy back 5 million shares of its stock, which has lost more than 
half its value in the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
First Hospital Vice President Robert Viso said his firm has no plans to close 
any of Comp Care's hospitals. Chairman B. Lee Karns said he expects key Comp 
Care employees to join the new firm, although they have not been promised jobs 
in the new company. 
</P>
<P>
Although First Hospital is smaller than Comp Care, it clearly will dominate the 
combined operation. The new company's seven-member board of directors will 
include five members designated by First Hospital and two from Comprehensive 
Care, one of whom will be Karns. First Hospital Chairman Ronald I. Dozoretz 
will be chairman of the new company. Karns said he will not become an officer 
in the new operation. 
</P>
<P>
The merger calls for First Hospital, which is owned primarily by Dozoretz, to 
receive a 63% stake in the new company, with Comp Care shareholders getting the 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
Comp Care shareholders will receive $5 in cash and a bond valued at $2.50 for 
each share of stock they own. Comp Care stock closed Wednesday at $10.75 per 
share, down 37.5 cents for the day on the New York Stock Exchange.

BROAD INC. SETS SHIFT TO L.A., TO ADD 200 JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Broad Inc., one of two companies spun off as part of the breakup of Kaufman 
&amp; Broad, said Wednesday that it will move the administrative headquarters 
of its financial services operation to Los Angeles from Atlanta, creating 200 
new jobs locally in the next year. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based firm also plans to invest $15 million in a new service 
center in Los Angeles that it hopes will make selling tax-deferred savings 
products faster and less costly. 
</P>
<P>
Those announcements are part of several to be presented today to Broad 
shareholders in what is expected to be an upbeat first annual meeting as a 
separate company. 
</P>
<P>
The company was split away from the former Kaufman &amp; Broad in March, with 
home building operations remaining in Kaufman &amp; Broad Home, a company 
formed in 1986 that was majority owned by Kaufman &amp; Broad. 
</P>
<P>
The restructuring was designed to enhance shareholder value. Management 
believed that the firm was hampered by a "two industry" image that resulted in 
its stock selling at ratios below those of home builders or insurance 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
So far the strategy seems to have worked. A share of pre-breakup Kaufman &amp; 
Broad, worth about $11 in December just before the restructuring was announced, 
has risen recently to nearly $16. That price represents the value of one share 
of Broad Inc. and 0.73 share of Kaufman &amp; Broad Home, which shareholders of 
the former Kaufman &amp; Broad received in the breakup. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. recently boosted ratings on Broad Inc.'s debt 
issues, partly because the company will no longer be burdened with the cyclical 
revenues and earnings of home building. 
</P>
<P>
Broad Inc. continues to transform its financial services operation. It has been 
divesting traditional life insurance businesses, focusing instead on 
faster-growing retirement-oriented savings products such as single-premium 
annuities. Those annuities -- which allow investors to accumulate earnings tax 
deferred until retirement -- have been gaining popularity, particularly among 
middle-aged consumers saving for retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we are in the right market and will be equipped to service our 
customers better and more efficiently than anyone else," said Eli Broad, 
chairman and chief executive of Broad Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The move of the headquarters of Broad's SunAmerica Corp. financial services 
operation to Los Angeles is part of an attempt to move closer to its primary 
markets and become the nation's lowest cost provider of retirement-oriented 
savings products, Eli Broad said. The move, he said, will allow the firm to 
upgrade its caliber of employees and create a new corporate culture and 
technology designed to sell annuities and life insurance products in the same 
way banks sell certificates of deposit, without lengthy paperwork procedures. 
</P>
<P>
The move, however, will result in layoffs of about 350 workers in Atlanta, whom 
the firm opted not to transfer to California.

JUDGE DENIES BOESKY PLEA FOR EARLY PRISON RELEASE

A federal judge refused to let convicted stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky out of 
prison Wednesday, saying the three-year sentence he got in Wall Street's 
biggest insider trading scandal "is not unjust." 
</P>
<P>
Boesky, who has already served a year in prison, claimed that his help led to a 
record plea bargain deal by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and the subsequent 
indictment of its "junk bond" chief Michael Milken and others on racketeering 
and securities fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Boesky's lawyers asked U.S. District Judge Morris E. Lasker to 
reduce his sentence to time already served, which would allow his immediate 
release. 
</P>
<P>
But Lasker said Boesky has already been given a number of breaks and "I cannot 
in good conscience conclude" that "he should be given further credit." 
</P>
<P>
Boesky's lawyers did not immediately return telephone calls for comment on 
Lasker's decision. 
</P>
<P>
The judge noted that although Boesky admitted to participating in numerous 
shady deals, he was allowed to plead guilty to just one count, which carried a 
maximum five-year sentence and for which Lasker only sentenced him to three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Lasker also noted that even without any actions by him or the parole board, 
"Boesky will be released from custody less than a year from today, which is to 
say, that the actual period he will have served will be slightly more than two 
years. Such a sentence is not unjust in the circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Boesky has supplied information used for civil or criminal charges in more than 
a dozen cases in the United States and Britain. In exchange, Boesky was allowed 
to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to lie to the SEC.

Turner to Offer Program for Schools: Turner Broadcasting System said it plans 
to offer a commercial-free daily news program for schools as an alternative to 
the ad-supported Channel One service tested recently by Whittle Communications. 
Turner Chairman Ted Turner said his Cable News Network would begin providing 
the daily 15-minute news show, called CNN Newsroom, on Aug. 14. The show would 
be carried on CNN before dawn each school day and could be recorded to use in 
class. A teacher's guide would also be available daily on how to use the 
programming.

GE RECEIVES $750-MILLION ORDER FROM JAPAN UTILITY

<P>
General Electric Co. has been awarded a $750-million contract to build a power 
plant in Japan that will become the world's largest combined-cycle power plant, 
the company's top executive announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the largest fossil generation order ever for GE," GE Chairman John F. 
Welch Jr. told shareholders during the company's annual stockholders meeting 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo Electric Power Co., a privately owned utility, awarded the contract to 
GE. Once in operation, the combined-cycle power plant will be capable of 
generating 2,600 megawatts of power -- 600 megawatts more than the world's 
largest combined-cycle plant currently in operation, Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
Combined-cycle power plants use the exhaust heat from a gas turbine to generate 
steam, which in turn drives a steam turbine, thus generating power from energy 
that would have been wasted. 
</P>
<P>
The power plant is scheduled to begin commercial service in the Tokyo area in 
the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
GE will serve as the prime contractor for Tokyo Electric's new power plant, 
working with Japanese companies Toshiba and Hitachi on plant construction. 
</P>
<P>
All eight of the proposed power plant's gas turbines will be manufactured in 
GE's Greenville plant and the eight steam turbines and hydrogen-cooled 
generators will be manufactured in GE's facilities in Schenectady, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
The order from Tokyo Electric comes on the heels on a $250-million order from 
Duke Power Co. in March. 
</P>
<P>
During the shareholders' meeting, held amid heavy security and marked with 
often heated exchanges between GE executives and shareholder-activists, Welch 
said the company would try to become "simpler, faster" and more 
"self-confident" during the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
GE, which employs about 298,000 workers worldwide, reported sales of $50 
billion in 1988.

Intel Corp., one of the nation's top computer chip makers, said Wednesday that 
it will eliminate up to 600 jobs, or 3% of its work force, in an effort to 
boost competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
The company is launching a major drive to cut costs throughout the corporation 
and is looking at ways to reduce overhead and factory positions. 
</P>
<P>
"We operate in an aggressive, unforgiving marketplace. While our financial 
position is solid and demand for our products is strong, our objective is to 
make sure we stay in good shape as we enter the 1990s," Chief Executive Andrew 
Grove said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
"This requires that we work steadily at reducing our costs and shifting 
resources from low to high areas of return," Grove said. 
</P>
<P>
The jobs will be eliminated this year, Intel said. The company has created a 
placement program to move as many affected employees as possible into new 
positions, but a small number are expected to be laid off. Intel now employs 
about 20,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Intel did not say exactly where the cuts would apply.

TAKEOVER RUMORS BOOST XEROX BY $2.50 PER SHARE

<P>
Shares of copier giant Xerox Corp. jumped in heavy trading Wednesday on talk 
that it might be a takeover target of British conglomerate Hanson PLC. 
</P>
<P>
Xerox stock rose $2.50 to $67.50 on volume of more than 1.3 million shares on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street analysts said Xerox could be vulnerable to a takeover by Hanson or 
another firm that might break up its diversified businesses, which range from 
insurance to stock brokerage, plus its well-known business machines. 
</P>
<P>
"Speculation about Xerox has become so substantial because of the underlying 
values it has," said analyst Eugene Glazer of Dean Witter Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts figured it would take $8.5 billion to $9 billion, or about $85 to $90 
per share, to acquire Xerox. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson, which has succeeded in a number of takeovers in the United States but 
has been inactive recently, is considered capable of pulling off such a feat, 
with a $7 billion war chest, analysts said. Xerox and Hanson declined comment 
on the rumors. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson is one of Britain's largest industrial concerns, with pretax profit of 
$1.5 billion on sales of $12.5 billion. It is already a player in the office 
consumer products market with its Smith Corona typewriters and word processors, 
acquired when it took over SCM Corp. several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Xerox mainly makes and develops copiers and other office equipment, but also 
has a large financial services arm that owns the brokerage Furman Selz Holding 
Co. and property and casualty insurance firm Crum &amp; Forster Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The takeover speculation came on a day that Xerox Corp. was unveiling what it 
calls the world's quietest ribbon typewriter, a machine nearly as quiet as a 
computer keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
The typewriters introduced Wednesday use a patented technology that gives the 
printer heads the vibrational characteristics of a hammer weighing nearly 35 
pounds, Xerox said. That makes them vibrate at a pitch nearly six octaves lower 
than usual, almost inaudible to the human ear.

REPORT SAYS MOBIL LEAVING S. AFRICA; 
</P>
<P>
LARGEST REMAINING U.S. FIRM BELIEVED TO BE SELLING ASSETS

<P>
Mobil Oil Co., the largest U.S. company remaining in South Africa, is selling 
its operations at bargain prices to the oil subsidiary of a South African 
mining conglomerate, newspapers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil representatives in South Africa and the United States declined to comment 
on the reports. 
</P>
<P>
Business Day of Johannesburg quoted "banking and other sources" as confirming 
the sale of about $400 million in assets for $150 million and said the Mobil 
properties would be sold in separate deals over a period of time. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil has been in South Africa for 90 years, and its four subsidiaries employ 
almost 2,800 people. The oil company has been a symbol of foreign business 
reluctance to leave the country, despite widespread condemnation of the 
white-minority government's suppression of the black majority in the system 
known as apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
Partly because of South Africa's race policies, more than 170 American 
companies have withdrawn over the last four years. Most have sold their 
operations at low prices to South African-controlled businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Since Exxon Corp., the largest U.S. oil concern, pulled out of South Africa in 
1986, Mobil had insisted it would not bow to pressure to disinvest, despite 
pressure on the company by anti-apartheid groups in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The South African Broadcasting Corp. reported Wednesday that Mobil may have 
changed its stance on disinvestment because of a bill passed by the U.S. 
Congress in its rush to adjourn before Christmas in 1987. The bill by Rep. 
Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.) removed the right of U.S. taxpayers to credit taxes 
paid to South Africa against taxes owed to the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
At least two shareholder resolutions exhorting Mobil to vacate South Africa are 
on the agenda at the company's annual meeting, scheduled for May 11. 
</P>
<P>
The Star of Johannesburg, the nation's largest daily, reported that "industry 
sources confirmed" Mobil was selling its South African assets for an estimated 
500 million rand, roughly $125 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Citizen, another Johannesburg daily, quoted "local and overseas" sources as 
saying Mobil was considering disinvesting. The paper said Mobil is the largest 
non-South African controlled employer in the country with 1,000 gasoline 
stations, a $225-million investment in an oil refinery and a distribution 
network.

PARENTS IN NEED OF DAY CARE FIND IT'S HARD TO COME BY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For two years, Teresa Ledezma, a single parent, has tried to enroll her 
4-year-old daughter in a preschool near her Pacoima home. Ledezma wants Cynthia 
to learn to interact with other children and get a head start on kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
But the places that are within her financial reach -- those funded in part by 
the state or by the private sector -- have never had a place for Cynthia. 
</P>
<P>
"One place told me she was too old, another told me she was not old enough and 
the other was full," Ledezma said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, she pays her mother $25 a week to care for Cynthia, but sporadic mail 
room work at $5.50 an hour makes even that small price a hardship. When her 
daughter is sick, Ledezma finds herself slipping away from work to take her to 
the doctor or to her sister's house. 
</P>
<P>
Ledezma is not alone. Parents of as many as 8,000 children who need day care in 
the northeast San Fernando Valley are out of luck, according to two private 
studies, evidence that the shortage of affordable child care in Los Angeles has 
reached crisis proportions in the city's poorer areas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eviction Notice 
</P>
<P>
The pending eviction of Escuela de la Gente, one of the largest day-care 
centers in Pacoima, to make way for a mini-mall has brought the problem into 
stark focus for mothers who depend on that center. The 10-year-old school, 
which serves 75 children ages 2 to 5, received an eviction notice in December 
that was upheld in March by a Municipal Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
When Escuela de la Gente mothers reviewed their options, they found that most 
of their friends leave children with unlicensed -- and sometimes expensive -- 
baby-sitters and miss work to shuttle their children from family member to 
family member. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people just rely on informal care -- relatives, friends," said 
Dorothy Fleisher, an administrator with United Way. "Then the kids come to 
school with no skills in a school system that expects much more. They are 
competing against kids who have more preparation, so they're starting at a 
disadvantage." 
</P>
<P>
People become so frustrated with the day-care situation that they give up, quit 
work and return to the welfare rolls, said Maria Valadez of Pacoima, who has a 
3-year-old son at Escuela de la Gente, a 9-year-old son in elementary school 
and a 1-year-old daughter who stays with a baby-sitter. Valadez knows mothers 
who leave their small children alone or with strangers. She knows of children 
who have been molested while in the care of others. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives you a lot of trauma, believe me," Valadez said. "I don't trust anyone 
but that little school." 
</P>
<P>
Problems at Escuela de la Gente -- "School of the People" -- seem to have been 
resolved, at least temporarily, by location of interim lodging at the Kinder 
Kare Children's Center around the corner. But a reprieve for mothers of those 
75 children stops far from filling the day-care void in the northeast Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Valadez works full time for a cable system manufacturer, which pays $5 an hour. 
Through state subsidies, Escuela de la Gente is free for her and other 
low-income families, but the baby-sitter who cares for her daughter charges $40 
a week. When the school's future looked bleak, Valadez thought about leaving a 
second child with the baby-sitter. 
</P>
<P>
"But I thought, 'I can't afford to pay $40 a week, but I pay it. Eighty dollars 
a week I could never afford,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
The two studies of day-care resources -- one by United Way and the other by 
Crystal Stairs, a referral agency -- uncovered a particularly critical lack of 
state-subsidized care in the northeast Valley, an area where most parents 
cannot afford to pay full price. Under the subsidies, parents are charged a 
maximum $9.54 a day, depending on their income. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 children are enrolled at subsidized centers in the area, which 
typically have long waiting lists. The Child Care Resource Center of the San 
Fernando Valley, a regional referral agency, has up to a two-year delay for 
parents seeking subsidized care at some centers or in licensed day-care homes. 
Escuela de la Gente has 200 people waiting for openings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Lot Give Up' 
</P>
<P>
"At one point, we had 3,000 names on our waiting list, but we find some have 
been on the list for years," said Lorraine Schrag, resource center director. 
"They move out of the area, they find someone down the street and a lot of 
people do give up." 
</P>
<P>
Ledezma, who rents a room across the street from Valadez, has had her daughter 
on a waiting list at Escuela de la Gente for two years. 
</P>
<P>
She would like to finish her high school education and study mathematics at a 
junior college to help make herself more marketable, a goal that might be 
attainable if Cynthia were enrolled in a subsidized center during the day. But 
Ledezma figures that she'll have to postpone that dream until Cynthia enters 
school the year after next. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried taking night classes two years ago, but financially I couldn't handle 
it. I was broke," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In the study conducted by United Way last spring, U.S. Census estimates were 
compared with day-care licensing lists from the state Department of Social 
Services. The United Way found a shortfall of more than 8,000 child-care spaces 
in the northeast Valley and it found no sick child care and very little infant 
care or after-school care. 
</P>
<P>
"What we discovered is there's not enough spaces available, and some of the 
spaces that are available are not affordable," said Mel Wilson, a Pacoima real 
estate agent and chairman of the United Way child care subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said that before United Way embarked on the study, he knew there was a 
need for more child care, but he was surprised to learn that there were more 
than 100 empty spaces in child-care centers in the northeast Valley. Providers 
said those spaces could not be filled because they were not subsidized and 
parents could not afford to pay full price, which ranges from $60 to more than 
$100 a week. 
</P>
<P>
The Child Care Resource Center relies on statistics gathered in November, 1987, 
by another Los Angeles referral agency, Crystal Stairs. While the study found a 
need for more child care throughout the Valley, the northeast Valley was in the 
direst straits, with a shortage of 7,494 spaces. 
</P>
<P>
Valleywide, more than half of the child-care need was being met, the agency 
found, while in the northeast Valley, just slightly more than a third of those 
children who need child care could be accommodated. Among infants, the need was 
even more desperate: Only 17% of the need for infant care was being met in the 
northeast Valley, while about 30% was met in the rest of the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Panorama City, Mission Hills, Sylmar, Pacoima and part of North Hollywood were 
in the worst shape. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unlicensed Homes 
</P>
<P>
Child-care advocates suggest that the lack of affordable child care has spawned 
an abundance of cheaper, unlicensed day-care homes. Julie Ruelas, who runs one 
of 54 licensed day-care homes in the northeast Valley, believes that there are 
more unlicensed than licensed centers in her area. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't have any regulations at all, that's the problem," Ruelas said. "A 
lot of them might be just fine, of course, but you just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Like most parents, Rosemarie Santoy of Mission Hills worries not only about the 
quantity of child care, but also the quality. 
</P>
<P>
Santoy, whose husband left her when she was eight months pregnant with their 
second child, tired of the dependency cycle of welfare and found a job at a 
grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
At first she worked part time, breaking her day in two to move her young 
children from one baby-sitter to another. Then the baby-sitter confessed that 
her teen-age son had hit Santoy's son, Michael, in the crotch, which Santoy 
believes was an attempt at sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"When I found out about this, I was really worried," Santoy said. "I didn't 
know where to go." 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, Santoy heard about Escuela de la Gente through friends and enrolled 
Michael, 4. She works full-time now and says she is luckier than many of the 
Escuela parents because her mother cares for her daughter, Jacqueline, 2, and 
probably could also have taken Michael had the school closed. 
</P>
<P>
"But I was afraid that two would be too much of a burden on my mother," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Prospects for additional government subsidies in an era of budget cuts are 
slim, child-care advocates acknowledge. Bills pending in Congress include a 
$1,000-a-year tax break for child care, backed by President Bush, and a 
sweeping child-care reform bill co-authored by Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.). 
</P>
<P>
Critics complain that there is no guarantee that the $1,000 tax break would be 
spent on child care and that it does not nearly offset the cost of child care, 
which Patsy Lane, child-care coordinator for the city of Los Angeles, estimated 
is $3,000 to $5,000 a year. Cranston's bill, with a price tag of $2.5 billion 
its first year, faces considerable opposition from conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
The state's newest child-care initiative is folded into welfare reform known as 
Greater Avenues for Independence. GAIN is scheduled to start in the Valley in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
Under GAIN, women on public assistance with children ages 3 or older must enter 
school, job training or work. In return, GAIN includes elaborate assurances 
that child care will be provided by the state, but so far many of the mothers 
participating in GAIN in Los Angeles County have found their own "informal" 
child care with family or friends, according to Ray Garcia, coordinator for 
GAIN in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"That seems to be the trend because there's not the demand for child-care 
reimbursement and child-care slots we had anticipated," Garcia said. "But 
whether that trend will continue or not we don't know." 
</P>
<P>
GAIN has hired 10 resource and referral agencies in Los Angeles County to 
recommend areas where more child-care slots are needed, Garcia said. Those 
agencies will then need to encourage new providers and provide licensing 
preparation assistance to them. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of interest in child care through GAIN is another indication that the 
program victimizes the poor, said Kevin Aslanian, advocate for the California 
Coalition of Welfare Rights Organizations in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"We estimate that 60% of the people who are participating in GAIN and paying 
for child care do not get their child care paid by GAIN," Aslanian said. "The 
counties make it very difficult to get child care . . . in some cases requiring 
child-care providers to come to the welfare office to meet the case worker. 
Most people do not want to advertise the fact that they are on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to perpetuate the problem down there," he said. "We're going to 
have more and more 12-year-olds watching 6-year-olds." 
</P>
<P>
An ambitious education overhaul plan under consideration by Los Angeles Unified 
School District officials includes adding preschool classes for 4-year-olds to 
district elementary schools and providing summer school options for all 
elementary students. Associate Supt. Paul M. Possemato said that if existing 
integration funds can be tapped, the preschools could begin opening later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
In the private sector, churches help support several parish-based child-care 
centers, and the North Valley YWCA runs an infant learning center for teen 
mothers at San Fernando High School. 
</P>
<P>
United Way supports 72 child-care programs throughout Los Angeles County 
including Escuela de la Gente -- where it partially subsidizes 25 slots -- and 
five other centers. 
</P>
<P>
A $5,000 contribution to United Way from Kaiser Foundation Health Plan will be 
added to $10,000 in United Way funds to increase the amount of day care in the 
northeast Valley, Fleisher said. 
</P>
<P>
United Way also has tried to involve private companies by alerting them to the 
tax incentives of subsidizing employee child care, beginning at a child-care 
conference in October. But Wilson acknowledged that results have been less than 
spectacular. So far, one company has decided to do an employee child-care 
survey and another is considering it, Fleisher said. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it would be a slow process," Wilson said. "But it's frustrating that 
things don't move faster than they do."

If you're as appalled as we are by platform shoes, flower-print jeans and 
safari wear, you may appreciate the following update on the out-of-date. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict for women: That baggy, slouched-over-the-hip look is OUT for casual 
tops. "An ill-fitting look is out-of-date," declares Gary Ross, co-owner of 
Raffles on Ventura Boulevard in Encino. "Clothes fit closer to the body now." 
</P>
<P>
Also headed for the trash heap: women's casual clothes with any kind of beading 
or metallics or suede gewgaws hanging off the shoulders. According to Maureen 
Norton, general manager of Jona in Studio City: "A much more pared down, 
cleaner look is in style now. We're steering away from the glitzy look." 
</P>
<P>
Men should bid adieu to collegiate plaids, shirts with stiff collars and 
unconstructed jackets, Cohen says. And this season, son, your mother is right: 
You do need to wear a pair of socks with your shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Don't be too disappointed if most of your wardrobe falls into the fashion-taboo 
category. Just think of it as a mandate to go shopping. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Getting the Slang of It 
</P>
<P>
You can be dudeical (DUDE-eh-kal) or you can be a goober. In other words, 
you're either hellacool or a dweeb. 
</P>
<P>
Confused? To get it straight, you may want to refer to "The Thesaurus of Slang" 
by Esther and Albert E. Lewin of Sherman Oaks. Recently published by Facts on 
File, it can be found in the reference section of many local libraries in the 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Most slang sticks around for quite a bit of time. It's generational," Albert 
Lewin says. "The slang you grew up with stays with you." 
</P>
<P>
Teen-agers invent the most new slang words. "Every time we saw a teen-ager, 
we'd ask them what was new in the language," Esther Lewin says. "If several 
different kids told us the same new word, we'd know it was general slang, not 
just particular to one high school." 
</P>
<P>
So . . . a computer nerd is a propeller head. And college admissions offices 
(as well as executive headhunters) engage in "creaming" -- looking for the 
cream of the crop. 
</P>
<P>
Because Michael Jackson has confused us over whether "bad" means what it says 
or means good, it might be easier to describe something as bunk, bald or burnt 
if it's awful. Or raw, fresh, killer or aggro if it's good. 
</P>
<P>
And if you're having a good time with all of this, you're kicking it. 
</P>
<P>
Cool. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Days of Wine Are Over? 
</P>
<P>
Kids and lemonade. 
</P>
<P>
Men and beer. 
</P>
<P>
Women and white wine. 
</P>
<P>
Well, two out of three isn't bad. But that last pair is on the verge of a 
breakup, according to the men and women who set 'em up across the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"White wine for women is passe," says bartender Eileen Schriver at Residuals, a 
bar in Studio City frequented by members of the entertainment industry. "Women 
are getting brave." 
</P>
<P>
Schriver's female customers are more apt to order Jack Daniels with Coke or 
vodka drinks. 
</P>
<P>
Vodka seems to be a hot contender for the preferred choice. Bartender Roger 
Nehls at L'Express Restaurant in Sherman Oaks mixes a number of vodka drinks 
with juices for female patrons. White Russians -- a blend of vodka, Kahlua and 
milk -- are top sellers at Executive Suite in Northridge. And Tom Shortley, 
manager of Manhattan Coolers in Sherman Oaks, says women frequently ask for 
vodka by brand name. 
</P>
<P>
A few watering holes north of the Santa Monica Mountains report that their 
female customers prefer beer -- light beer. What's more, many women at Rumors 
in North Hollywood follow that light beer with a high-calorie Schnapps shooter. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happened to pretzels? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accidental Intersections 
</P>
<P>
If you've been moaning about having "one of those days," then do the rest of us 
a favor by avoiding the five intersections in the Valley that top the "most 
accidents" list. According to George Callandrillo of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's traffic coordination section, they are: 
</P>
<P>
* Sepulveda Boulevard and Nordhoff Street. 
</P>
<P>
* Victory Boulevard and Winnetka Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
* Sepulveda and Vanowen Street. 
</P>
<P>
* Balboa Boulevard and Parthenia Street. 
</P>
<P>
* Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Sherman Way. 
</P>
<P>
You might want to consider rerouting to Ventura Boulevard, where perpetual 
gridlock makes it more likely that your mood -- rather than your car -- will be 
wrecked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Evil Geniuses for a Better Tomorrow 
</P>
<P>
Believe it or not, you'd probably trust an "evil genius for a better tomorrow" 
to baby-sit your kids or feed your dogs or date your daughter. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the name, the evil geniuses are on the side of good. More 
specifically, they are a Van Nuys High School club of students dedicated to 
tutoring their peers on a one-on-one basis during lunch hour in traditional 
subjects as well as in more advanced ones, such as calculus, physics and 
computer programming. 
</P>
<P>
Seniors Darren Kessner, Christopher Alexander, Robert Maeda, Christopher Paul 
and Jeff Robbins formed the club this past school year, motivated by a desire 
to do something together that would leave a positive mark on the school. The 
number of students taking advantage of their offer fluctuates, but co-founder 
Kessner notes that every day he is approached by one or two students requesting 
help. 
</P>
<P>
Although the club's name was cribbed from a board game, the evil geniuses are 
quite original in the way they've organized themselves. "The club has five 
presidents, about 20 vice presidents and one member," Kessner says. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously the evil geniuses need no tutoring in the art of corporate 
bureaucracy. 
</P>

DESIGNS FOR LOW-INCOME HOUSING -- WITH CHILD CARE IN MIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By R. DANIEL FOSTER, Foster is a regular contributor to Valley View. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The future of child-care facilities in the San Fernando Valley may be in the 
hands of 11 young architects from the Southern California Institute of 
Architecture in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
The students recently gathered at the Warner Center Marriott to showcase their 
innovative designs for low-income family housing, which may be pooled and 
eventually built on a 7.8-acre site in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
Integral to their designs are housing and commercial spaces that are tied 
together, providing a mini-community where residents would live and work -- and 
where child care would be available for their children. 
</P>
<P>
Instructors within ARCH (Architectural Response to Community Housing), a design 
studio at the school that promotes low-income housing, have guided the students 
for 15 weeks as they have drawn and built prototypes of their communities. Also 
advising the students are L.A. Family Housing Corp., which has developed 
affordable family housing for low-income working families for six years and the 
2-year-old Center for Childhood Creativity, run by Cal State Northridge in 
Warner Center, which creates and implements innovative child-care solutions. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the students of the importance for homelike environments," said Dianne 
Philibosian, project director of the childhood center. "We've begun to focus on 
providing spaces, but not what happens in those spaces. I tried to communicate 
that," she said, adding that one particular architect really understood her 
concepts. Philibosian walked to a scale model of The Village, designed by Robin 
Morris, a fourth-year student at the architectural institute. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Center of Model 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the model is a child-care center fronted by a park. Fanning 
out from the facility are commercial zones, including professional offices, 
restaurants and crafts stores for children. Residential units, as in all the 
students' designs, are above retail spaces. Families living in the housing 
units, which curve in a semi-circle around the child-care center, could easily 
look out on the park and center should they want to see their children at play. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking of the playful aspects of children when I designed the space," 
said Morris, 32, who lives in Redondo Beach. A pyramid-shaped, stepped fountain 
with mini waterfalls is near the child-care center, and water also flows around 
a circular entrance leading up from the underground parking facility and 
through the tree-lined park. A bridge spans Canoga Avenue, depositing visitors 
in the project's first retail zone, which contains clothing, video and 
convenience stores. 
</P>
<P>
"Children are people, and one needs to be in touch with them, rather than 
applying our adult concepts of what a children's area should look like," 
Philibosian said. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole idea behind this development is that you can work, live and play in 
one tight community," Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
"The designs are very unlike L.A.," said Arnold Stalk, executive director of 
L.A. Family Housing Corp. "But that doesn't mean it won't work. It's an attempt 
to solve a multitude of problems with one development -- affordable housing 
needs, economic development and child care. 
</P>
<P>
"Land is so scarce and expensive now that you're going to see more residential 
and commercial development." 
</P>
<P>
Stalk said residents could lease commercial space or entire families could be 
sponsored by a business while their children are cared for nearby. Families 
would stay in the community for a maximum of five years until they were 
established financially to move on to their own enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
Stalk, ARCH and others are negotiating to purchase the land from the Los 
Angeles Department of Water and Power. Should the project be realized, the 
students will pool their ideas under the supervision of established architects 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the reason I designed the project was to realize and discover the 
child within me," Morris said. "As we grow older, we grow full of logic. The 
playful aspect gets denied."

MIAMI NURSING SCHOOL MAKES VIDEO ON ALZHEIMER'S

Victims of Alzheimer's disease suffer from the inability to communicate, making 
it difficult for families trying to care for them, but one research project has 
come up with a few communication techniques that may ease the burden for 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Miami School of Nursing has produced a 25-minute videotape, 
"Communication With the Cognitively Impaired Older Adult," designed to help 
nurses and families communicate with elderly people whose thought processes are 
impaired by Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
The tape demonstrates techniques that proved effective during a 2-year research 
project at a North Miami nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
"We know many people don't know how to communicate with these people. The aim 
of the tape is to try to convince people that there is something they can do," 
said Ruth Tappen, dean of the School of Nursing. 
</P>
<P>
The physiology of memory and thinking is not well understood. It is believed 
that the brain translates the words it receives into concepts, stores the 
concepts in the memory, then translates the ideas back into words when they are 
needed again. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Translating Process Impaired 
</P>
<P>
Alzheimer's disease somehow impairs that translating process. Victims have 
trouble receiving, storing and retrieving ideas. They may retain the mechanical 
ability to hear, speak and read words, but lose the meaning of them. 
</P>
<P>
They forget quickly, cannot process new information in a normal way, and 
usually suffer impairment in judgment, reasoning and logic. 
</P>
<P>
In conversations, they tend to use short, repetitive phrases, often 
interrupting another speaker or stopping in the middle of a sentence. They may 
change the subject abruptly, seem to ignore the speaker or give answers that 
make no sense. 
</P>
<P>
"These people have, specifically, problems with cognition, the thinking 
process. They are not mentally ill or emotionally disturbed," Tappen said. 
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 5% to 15% of those over 65 suffer some degree of cognitive 
impairment, and that 50% of nursing home patients are cognitively impaired. 
</P>
<P>
In the tape, nurses and aides demonstrate techniques that they used during a 
"revitalization" project aimed at finding out whether Alzheimer's victims could 
be taught to become more independent. 
</P>
<P>
They worked with 20 Alzheimer's patients aged 60 to 103 in groups of six to 
eight, helping them perform such tasks as walking, and grooming and feeding 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that communicating with these patients requires an extreme 
amount of patience. "It is draining. You are working all the time," Tappen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some techniques recommended are: 
</P>
<P>
* Speak slowly and allow ample time for a reply. Rapid stimuli are confusing to 
the cognitively impaired. Because they have trouble processing thoughts, it 
takes them a long time to formulate answers. 
</P>
<P>
* Be repetitive. You may have to repeat yourself five or six times before they 
grasp the meaning of your words. Phrase your message several different ways, 
using simple synonyms. Use the same words they have used -- it indicates that 
they may have retained some recognition of that word. 
</P>
<P>
* Ask simple yes-or-no questions. A therapist on the tape gets no reply when 
she asks a woman to "Tell me something about yourself." But the woman is able 
to answer such questions as "Are you married?" and "Do you have children?" 
</P>
<P>
* Avoid pronouns such as he, she and it. Repeating the name of the person or 
thing may help them remember what you were talking about. 
</P>
<P>
* Do things one step at a time. Instead of telling a patient to "Eat your 
breakfast," nurses and aides got better results when they broke down their 
instructions into separate steps such as "Pick up your glass" and "Drink your 
juice." 
</P>
<P>
* Be concrete. Talk about things you can see, feel, point to or show pictures 
of. Attempts to discuss philosophical, hypothetical or abstract topics will 
probably compound their confusion. 
</P>
<P>
* Be supportive and keep criticism to a minimum. Alzheimer's victims may become 
frustrated, embarrassed or frightened by their failure to communicate. Show 
respect and understand that they may be very much aware of what's going on 
around them. 
</P>
<P>
"They're impaired adults. They shouldn't be treated like children," Tappen 
said. "Would you want to be treated like a child again?" 
</P>
<P>
* Use gestures and nonverbal cues. Demonstrate or act out your words when 
possible. Many cognitively impaired people seem adept at reading nonverbal 
cues. Pay attention to their nonverbal cues, too. Their voice tone, gestures 
and facial expression may provide clues to what they are trying to communicate 
even if the words don't make sense. 
</P>
<P>
* Maintain eye contact. It helps hold their attention and can help you measure 
whether they comprehend what you are saying. Watch your spatial relationship. 
If they are sitting and you are standing, you may literally be talking over 
their heads. If they can see or hear better on one side, sit on that side. 
</P>
<P>
* Use touch. A light pat or touch on the arm can reassure them, get their 
attention and prepare them to receive information. Approach them from the front 
and don't touch them without speaking first or you may startle them. 
</P>
<P>
* Understand that it may be easier for them to talk about the past than about 
current events because those old memories have been "stored" and can be 
retrieved.

COUNCIL FLIP-FLOPS, VOTES TO PAY OFFICERS' LEGAL COSTS

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Long Beach City Council in a surprise reversal late Tuesday night voted to 
pay legal costs of the two police officers facing criminal charges stemming 
from the controversial arrest of black activist Don Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the council rejected a proposal to pay the officers' legal bills by 
a 6-3 vote. But during the weekend, a police officer's wife, who is an East 
Long Beach mother of three, organized volunteers who passed out about 10,000 
leaflets asking residents to protest the council decision. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Pick Up Defense Costs 
</P>
<P>
The council emerged from a closed-door meeting shortly before midnight Tuesday 
and voted 7 to 2 to pick up the defense costs of officers Mark Dickey and Mark 
Ramsey, accused of writing a false police report of the Jan. 14 incident. 
Dickey is also charged with assaulting Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
The council reversal came nearly five hours into the meeting. Consideration of 
paying the legal fees was not on the agenda. Councilman Warren Harwood, who 
supported paying the legal costs, said the closed-door meeting did not violate 
state open-meeting requirements because it amounted to reconsideration of a 
previous action. 
</P>
<P>
Only Councilmen Evan Anderson Braude and Clarence Smith dissented. 
</P>
<P>
Had it not been for the efforts of Becky Bishop and her army of volunteers, the 
council probably would not have reconsidered the issue, Councilman Tom Clark 
said. His office received about 70 calls from irate residents responding to the 
leaflets. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic feeling (of the callers) was that we should support the officers," 
Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Councilman Les Robbins, a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy, said he 
would have brought the issue up for reconsideration anyway. He said the city is 
protected against runaway defense attorney fees and that he had received more 
information regarding the case. He would not say anything about the additional 
information. 
</P>
<P>
Both Clark and Harwood said the council changed its mind because of legal 
issues raised in the closed session. Neither councilman would discuss the 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
Harwood said the city should back the on-duty police accused of crimes. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, Dickey and Ramsey were secretly videotaped by an NBC camera as 
they confronted Jackson, a Hawthorne police sergeant on stress disability leave 
who came to Long Beach to try to show brutality and racism by the police force. 
During the arrest, Dickey appeared to push Jackson through a plate-glass 
window. 
</P>
<P>
"My simple position was that our officers, in the line of duty, ought not to 
have to rely on their personal resources to have a defense," Harwood said. "The 
greatest concern was that if we had not provided the defense, it's like a 
message to the rest of the force that they are risking their family's financial 
well-being" if they are ever accused. 
</P>
<P>
Like Clark, Harwood credited Bishop with bringing pressure on the council to 
change its mind. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop, whose husband is a city policeman, said she was outraged at the 
council's failure last week to back its officers. 
</P>
<P>
So she said she printed 3,000 leaflets at the Police Officers Assn. 
headquarters and asked friends to help distribute them. "I sat in the parking 
lot at El Dorado Park wondering if they would show up." 
</P>
<P>
They did. There was so much help, that the batch was gone in an hour. Armed 
with 6,000 more leaflets from a quick print shop, Bishop said volunteers worked 
through the day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Volunteers Cheered

The response was immediate, she said. Sixty-six people called association 
headquarters Saturday asking how they could help. She said she and her 
volunteers cheered after listening to each of the recorded phone messages 
Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop said that by Monday she had distributed all but 2,000 of the 12,000 
leaflets she had printed at her own expense. She said the association has 
promised to reimburse her.

She said the public outcry shows "there's a lot of public support for those 
police officers."

D.A. FILES 17 FRAUD CHARGES AGAINST HEALTH CLUB OWNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
DOWNEY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The district attorney's office has filed 17 fraud charges against the owner of 
a local health club who is accused of selling memberships without telling 
buyers that the facility would be closing. 
</P>
<P>
John Robert Prell, 34, the owner of the defunct 24-Hour Nautilus in the 
Stonewood Shopping Center, is charged with defrauding customers of more than 
$49,000 in membership fees, according to Downey Police. 
</P>
<P>
Prell is scheduled to be arraigned May 4 in Downey Municipal Court on two 
counts of felony grand theft, 14 petty theft charges and one count of false 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Prell was arrested March 14, two days after he initially closed the club, 
reportedly for remodeling. He is free on $25,000 bail. The club then was 
reopened until Prell closed it permanently March 31. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. John Finch, supervisor of the detective bureau, said 228 members complained 
to Downey police that Prell had not honored their membership fees. 
</P>
<P>
"It is our contention that Mr. Prell had no intention of honoring those 
memberships because those people signed up after he signed an agreement with 
the shopping center to vacate the building," Finch said. 
</P>
<P>
The felony counts involve charges that two customers were defrauded of more 
than $400. Prell also was accused of running newspaper advertising that 
allegedly offered long-term memberships to the health spa after he had signed 
the agreement to leave the building, Finch said. 
</P>
<P>
Prell was arrested in March after more than 100 patrons picketed the health 
club, claiming they had been deceived. Patrons said they were told the club was 
closing temporarily for remodeling but they became concerned when the exercise 
equipment was being moved. 
</P>
<P>
Prell could not be reached for comment Wednesday.

D.A. FINDS NO EVIDENCE OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST BY NORWALK COUNCILMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The district attorney's office this week determined that there is no evidence 
to warrant any further investigation into whether Councilman Luigi Vernola 
violated state conflict-of-interest laws. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office last December opened an inquiry into whether 
Vernola had a conflict of interest when he gave money to his brother, Mike, to 
acquire interest in property within a city redevelopment zone. 
</P>
<P>
"It is our conclusion that the . . . (gift) of money to his brother for the 
purchase of the Dial property does not expose the councilman to criminal 
liability under California conflict- of-interest law," Deputy Dist. Atty. James 
Hickey concluded earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
The property, on the 11000 block of Firestone Boulevard, was the former site of 
Dial Chevrolet, which moved to Santa Fe Springs in August. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Part of Family Heritage' 
</P>
<P>
Vernola said Wednesday that the decision validated what he had said from the 
start, that he only wanted to help his younger brother with the 1985 gift and 
did not stand to benefit personally. "It's part of our family heritage," 
Vernola said. "Family members help out each other." 
</P>
<P>
State law prohibits public officials from using their offices for personal 
financial benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Council members sit as directors of the Norwalk Redevelopment Agency and cast 
votes that could affect the value of property in redevelopment zones. The 
Redevelopment Agency could, for example, use tax dollars to subsidize new 
business development or to rehabilitate existing businesses in the zones. In 
addition, redevelopment money is often used to fund public improvements, such 
as new sidewalks, that increase property values throughout the area. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the district attorney's inquiry was announced, Vernola resigned from 
the Redevelopment Agency. Vernola, who owns property within and outside 
redevelopment zones in Norwalk, said he could not properly serve the agency if 
he were required to abstain on numerous votes that might possibly affect his 
property. The city is accepting applications from residents who want to fill 
that position. 
</P>
<P>
Investigator Carlos Perez of the district attorney's office said Vernola's 
resignation had nothing to do with the decision against a full investigation. 
Perez said he reviewed Vernola's voting record in relation to his holdings and 
those of his brother and found no evidence of a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
"He did not vote in a way that would have affected the Dial property or any 
other property" owned by Vernola or his brother, Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the outcome of the inquiry, Vernola said he has not changed his mind 
about serving as a Redevelopment Agency director. 
</P>
<P>
Vernola was a Norwalk planning commissioner when he gave his brother an 
undisclosed amount of money to invest in the Dial property. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Stutzke, a friend of the Vernolas and president of Keystone Ford on 
Imperial Highway, bought the parcel in 1986. Mike Vernola became Stutzke's 
partner a short time later. Stutzke acquired the remaining parcel of the 
three-acre site last October. Keystone plans to sell used cars and new trucks 
on the site, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Vernola said he had been considering acquiring the site to expand his 
family-run business. The councilman owns two automotive garages, a service 
station and a towing service. Mike Vernola helps him manage the towing service. 
</P>
<P>
But the councilman said he decided against the acquisition, in part, because he 
received legal advice that such a move could constitute a conflict of interest 
for a planning commissioner. He then gave his brother the money to help him 
take advantage of the investment opportunity, the councilman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Redevelopment Agency was not involved in the purchase of the former Dial 
Chevrolet site, officials said.

LANGUAGE OF WHITTIER RECALL PETITION CERTIFIED 
</P>

<P>
The move to recall the entire City Council picked up steam this week as the 
city clerk certified the language of the recall petition and organizers began 
collecting signatures. 
</P>
<P>
Recall proponents set up a table outside City Hall to gather signatures from 
residents attending Tuesday night's City Council meeting. "It's going great," 
said recall organizer Don Murphy, who carried a sign reading "Recall Them All." 
</P>
<P>
The petition says the council should be recalled because of its unanimous vote 
to ban ownership of assault rifles in Whittier and for failing to limit 
apartment construction in neighborhoods around the Uptown Village business 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Signatures are being collected by members of the Whittier Voters Coalition, a 
group of gun enthusiasts and others who banded together in March after the 
council vote on assault rifles. However, historic preservationists who have 
opposed new apartment construction are not supporting the effort to recall 
Mayor Victor A. Lopez and Councilmen Gene Chandler, Myron Claxton, Thomas K. 
Sawyer and Robert H. Woehrmann. 
</P>
<P>
The petitions accuse the council members of "abuse of powers," saying they 
"willfully allowed and encouraged a program of apartment construction within 
the city limits to continue in direct conflict of the wishes of the majority of 
its citizens." 
</P>
<P>
The petitions also criticize the council for not allowing residents to vote on 
the assault rifle ordinance and for "endangering the public health and safety 
by enacting a restrictive firearm ordinance which refuses a citizen of Whittier 
a right to keep and bear arms." 
</P>
<P>
Recall proponents have until Aug. 22 to collect signatures from 7,569 
registered voters to force an election, City Clerk Gertrude L. Hill said. A 
separate petition will be required for each council member, she said. Hill will 
have 30 days to certify the signatures. 
</P>
<P>
Although state law allows subjects of a recall effort to provide a written 
response to the petition, none of the City Council did, Hill said. Council 
members have dismissed the recall effort as frivolous.

DIGEST: COMPLAINT TO BE FILED ON LONG TRAIN STOPPAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Downey is filing a complaint with the Public Utilities Commission that a 
Southern Pacific Railroad train violated state law by stopping at least 30 
minutes last week during morning rush hour, a city official told the City 
Council Tuesday night. State law authorizes a train to stop for 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Five people telephoned City Hall reporting the incident that occurred last 
Tuesday at 7:15 a.m., according to Public Works Director William Ralph. 
</P>
<P>
Train tracks divide the north and south sections of Downey, said Ralph, who 
expressed concern that emergency vehicles could be prevented from entering 
Downey Community Hospital south of the tracks.

FUND DRIVE BUILDS FOR WHEELCHAIR ATHLETES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Julie Alban says she has almost reached her goal of raising $10,000 in prize 
money for the winners of the wheelchair division of the Long Beach Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
"Wheelchair athletes are a model of courage and determination in the disabled 
community and the able-bodied world," Alban wrote in a letter she recently sent 
to 600 potential donors. "I would very much like to see greater equality in 
these races for all of the athletes." 
</P>
<P>
Alban, 23, has been in a wheelchair since last year when she was shot in the 
back by her then-boyfriend, Bradley Ackerman, the stepson of Long Beach Press 
Telegram Chairman Daniel H. Ridder. Ackerman, 24, was subsequently sentenced to 
life imprisonment for the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Alban said she decided to raise money for the wheelchair athletes after 
realizing that although organizers of the May 7 marathon had set aside $30,000 
to be divided among the event's 10 able-bodied winners, no funds had been 
earmarked for the winners in the wheelchair division. 
</P>
<P>
As of early this week, she said, she had already received about $8,000 in 
contributions. Donations, she said, may be sent to 1040 Elm Ave., Suite 100, 
Long Beach, Calif. 90813.

NEW CITY ATTORNEY NAMED AT LOWER RATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Norwalk City Council has appointed as its new city attorney Steven L. 
Dorsey, of the law firm of Richards, Watson &amp; Gershon. Dorsey replaces 
former City Atty. J. Kenneth Brown, who held the post for more than 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council decided to rebid the city attorney's contract last November 
after City Manager Richard R. Powers said that Norwalk's legal fees appeared to 
be excessive when compared with several area cities with similar legal demands. 
</P>
<P>
The city manager, however, had no specific examples of overcharging or bills 
for unnecessary legal services on the part of Brown's firm. And Powers said 
city employees may have contributed to high legal bills by unnecessarily 
seeking legal advice. Brown said his firm provided the city with proper legal 
services at a reasonable rate. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey's firm, which will charge the city a $5,000 monthly retainer and $135 an 
hour for additional legal services, initially underbid Brown's firm of Brown, 
Winfield &amp; Canzoneri, Powers said. Brown's firm was willing to renegotiate 
its bid, but Powers said the council "simply wanted a change" when it appointed 
Dorsey last week.

COUNCIL DROPS PLAN FOR PARK ACTIVITY BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Whittier City Council rejected plans to build a $500,000 activity center at 
Michigan Park after about 150 residents attended a council meeting to protest 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
The Parks and Recreation Department had proposed building the 3,500-square-foot 
center in the middle of the park to serve as a site for adult education classes 
and youth activities. Combined with 30 parking spaces, the activity center 
would occupy about one-fourth of the park's space. 
</P>
<P>
Residents submitted a petition with about 280 signatures of people who opposed 
the activity center. The residents feared the building would increase traffic 
in the area, attract vagrants and spoil the park's open play area. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing more than an hour of testimony from residents who opposed the 
project, the council voted unanimously to shelve the activity center. 
Councilman Robert F. Woehrmann suggested the $500,000 be used for anti-gang or 
anti-drug youth activities.

MAN CONVICTED OF 4 MURDERS; 2 LINKED TO SOUTHSIDE SLAYER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unemployed construction worker was convicted on four counts of first-degree 
murder Wednesday by a Superior Court jury. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the murders for which Louis Craine was convicted had been linked to the 
so-called Southside Slayer killings of prostitutes in South-Central Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Craine, 31, was also found guilty on several counts of sexual assault in the 
strangulation murders. He was acquitted on a fifth count of first-degree 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
Compton Superior Court Judge Janice Claire Croft ordered the jury of six men 
and six women to return May 8 to decide whether Craine should be given the 
death penalty or life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
Craine had confessed to police shortly after his 1988 arrest. But he then 
recanted his hours-long confession, which was taped by police and later played 
for the jury during the trial that began March 27. 
</P>
<P>
Other evidence included the testimony of several of Craine's relatives, 
including his mother who linked him to a shirt that was stained with blood of 
the same type as one of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as April 17, Craine had earnestly proclaimed his innocence, calling 
his relatives "liars" and maintaining that he had never seen the shirt before. 
He added that he thought his relatives, especially his mother, were mad at him 
for having left home at an early age. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys Morris B. Jones and Ronald V. Skyers did not dispute Craine's 
confession. Rather, they contended that their client made his statements only 
after sustained police interrogation. 
</P>
<P>
"He was unable to understand what he was saying," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Portrayed as Illiterate 
</P>
<P>
The defense portrayed Craine as an illiterate man with a fourth-grade education 
and an IQ of 69 who is prone to exaggeration and has a tendency to "parrot" the 
statements of others. 
</P>
<P>
They said Craine made his incriminating statements only after investigators had 
given him certain information about the murders. All the victims were believed 
to be prostitutes and drug addicts. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. John Watson contended that Craine's statements contained 
information only the killer could have known. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the cause of death of one of the victims, Loretta Perry, had 
initially been listed as a cocaine overdose. Her body was found Jan. 25, 1987, 
in the 9500 block of South Defiance Avenue. But after Craine spoke of having 
strangled Perry, her body was exhumed and a second autopsy confirmed 
strangulation as the cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Perry, Craine was convicted of murdering Gail M. Ficklin, whose body 
was found Aug. 15, 1985; Vivian Louise Collins, found strangled in the 1600 
block of East Century Boulevard on March 18, 1987, and Carolyn Barney, found in 
a vacant lot near Craine's parents home in the 9700 block of South Grandee 
Avenue in May, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Craine was acquitted in the slaying of Sheila Rae Burris, who was found stabbed 
and strangled Nov. 18, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Southside Slayer Killings 
</P>
<P>
She, along with Ficklin and Barney, had been linked by police to the Southside 
Slayer killings. Police believe that no one killer was responsible for all 18 
slayings. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Lee Siebert, a convicted killer imprisoned in Alabama, was charged last 
year with two of the murders. Charles Mosley was convicted of the 1986 murder 
of a third woman. In another case, veteran Sheriff's Deputy Rickey Ross, 40, 
was charged in February with murdering three prostitutes in South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
It was Craine's second trial on the charges. The first proceeding ended in a 
mistrial in August when a clerk mistakenly gave deliberating jurors portions of 
a witness statement that they were not supposed to see.

BRADLEY RETAINS ATTORNEY IN PROBE OF LINKS TO BANKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY and FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley disclosed Wednesday that he has retained a top civil attorney 
and a politically influential law firm to "protect my interest" in the city 
attorney's investigation of his ties with two financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prospect arose that the City Council may hire special counsel to 
look into whether Bradley violated conflict-of-interest laws when he received 
payments for serving on the board of Valley Federal Savings and Loan Assn. and 
as a member of the Board of Advisors for Far East National Bank, firms that 
have had dealings with the city. The Times learned that several City Council 
members are pressing for the hiring of a special counsel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City Investigation 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's immediate concern, however, was the investigation by City Atty. 
James K. Hahn, which Bradley welcomed when it was announced. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the investigation began emerging for the first time. One target of 
the Hahn staff, The Times learned, was to find out just when the mayor resigned 
as an adviser to the Far East National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
That is important because Bradley, in March, made a telephone call to the city 
treasurer asking whether city funds were about to be withdrawn from Far East 
and other banks. The mayor has said he was no longer employed by Far East when 
he made the telephone call, but said that his resignation -- last December -- 
was done orally. 
</P>
<P>
In pursuing the investigation, Hahn, in a letter to Police Chief Daryl F. 
Gates, asked for help from the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Preliminary' Inquiry 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Police Chief Robert Vernon said two detectives from the bunco and 
forgery division will meet with Hahn next week to determine what help the city 
attorney needs. Asked whether this was a criminal investigation, Vernon said, 
"No, at this point no, nothing criminal has been alleged. At this point I would 
term it a preliminary inquiry into the facts." 
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic of the day's events came in the morning, at a City Hall press 
conference Bradley had called to announce a new commission to assist the 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he had retained his own counsel, Bradley said he had asked for 
help from Daniel Fogel, a well-known Los Angeles attorney, and the firm of 
Manatt, Phelps, Rothenberg &amp; Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody has to look carefully at every possibility discussed with the city 
attorney, to be -- in essence -- working on that matter full time to protect my 
interest, and I am busy carrying on the work of the city and certainly would 
not try to divide that attention," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked who was paying the attorney, Bradley said "the city is not paying." 
Later, spokesman Bill Chandler said payment would be worked out "between the 
mayor and his attorneys." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Role Is Confirmed 
</P>
<P>
Fogel confirmed he was helping the mayor. "I was retained by the mayor to 
advise him in connection with the city attorney's inquiry and the Manatt firm 
is acting as co-counsel," he said. Fogel declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Kantor of the Manatt firm said "I am not going to comment on anything 
except to say we have been retained as co-counsel with Dan's firm." 
</P>
<P>
Fogel is a partner in Fogel, Feldman, Ostrov, Ringler &amp; Klevens and has 
been active in local, state and national professional associations. Kantor is a 
well known Democratic Party strategist who is influential in internal party 
affairs. Most recently, he directed the unsuccessful campaign to permit oil 
drilling at the Pacific Palisades, a cause supported by Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of the special counsel to the City Council is supported by several 
council members, said Councilman Mike Woo, chairman of the Government 
Operations Committee, which is concerned with Hahn's probe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Council's Concerns 
</P>
<P>
Sentiment for an independent council inquiry, Woo said, comes from members who 
have expressed "some concern whether the city attorney will be able to proceed 
with a truly independent investigation. Some members of the council want an 
independent investigation" by someone other than an elected official. 
</P>
<P>
One council member said Hahn's office has a built-in conflict of interest in 
this situation because the city attorney is both a criminal prosecutor and, 
under the City Charter, counsel for the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Council members also questioned whether Hahn's office, which handles city 
business and civil matters, has the capacity for a complex conflict-of-interest 
probe. 
</P>
<P>
Woo, however, said he personally does not "see the need for" special counsel 
now. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn's investigation is touching on several areas of the mayor's involvement 
with the savings and loan and the bank, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
One key area is to determine whether Bradley was still employed by the bank 
when he received on March 21 a telephone call from Henry Hwang, chairman of the 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Call to Treasurer 
</P>
<P>
After Hwang asked whether the city was going to withdraw its deposits from his 
and other banks, the mayor said he called City Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg and 
inquired whether that were true. He also said he asked Rittenberg whether the 
city had any deposits in that bank. 
</P>
<P>
Rittenberg said the city had deposits in Far East Bank. At that point, Bradley 
said, he decided to return the $18,000 Far East had paid him for serving on the 
Board of Advisors. He said he decided at that moment to send Hwang a letter and 
return the funds. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Bradley said: "As you know, I terminated my relationship with" 
Far East in December. Thus, Bradley said he was not on the Far East payroll 
when he called Rittenberg. 
</P>
<P>
However, when The Times earlier this month asked Bradley to document his 
resignation, his aides replied that it was given orally and there was no 
documentation. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, The Times obtained a copy of Far East National Bank's report for 
1988. That report included an independent auditor's report signed Jan. 20, 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
That report still listed Bradley as a member of the Board of Advisors. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about that, press spokesman Chandler said he had no explanation. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, at his press conference, reiterated his support for Hahn's 
investigation. "Let me remind you I encouraged the city attorney to start a 
full investigation, offered my cooperation and support," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley called the use of the police, first disclosed by the Los Angeles Herald 
Examiner, "a routine action taken over and over again." Chief Vernon said the 
department has been called in to help in similar investigations, most recently 
in the well-publicized investigation of a former head of the General Services 
Administration and in a probe of the Housing Authority.

MOTHER TELLS PORN TRIAL OF DAUGHTER'S ROLE IN FILMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The television monitor flickered to life, displaying an ersatz talk show. On 
the right was a man holding a microphone. On the left was a young woman in a 
bikini, lounging in a provocative pose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Miss Traci Lords, how did a nice girl like you get into a business like 
this?" 
</P>
<P>
 Freeze frame. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the federal courtroom in Los Angeles on Wednesday, the witness was asked 
whether she recognized the female. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Briceland identified her daughter, Nora. 
</P>
<P>
Could she estimate Nora's age when the videotape was made? 
</P>
<P>
"She was 17." 
</P>
<P>
It was not an easy day for Patricia Briceland. Department of Justice 
prosecutors had called her to the stand to testify in a child pornography and 
racketeering case to help them show that her daughter, known to the public as 
Traci Lords, was under the age of 18 when she made dozens of X-rated films and 
videos. 
</P>
<P>
Defendant Rubin Gottesman of Woodland Hills and his company, X-citement Videos, 
are accused of distributing the child pornography and obscene materials, as 
well as violating federal racketeering statutes. 
</P>
<P>
Time and again, Briceland was shown pictures of her daughter on video cases 
bearing such titles as "Screaming Desire," "Lust in the Fast Lane," 'Prisoner 
of Pleasure" and "Sweet Little Things." Time and again, she was shown clips 
from the videos -- halted before the scenes became sexually explicit. 
</P>
<P>
The federal prosecutor asked his questions in a dull monotone. Briceland 
answered with confidence. In one video, she said, Nora was "definitely 16." In 
another, "I would say 17." In another, "right on the fringe . . . she could be 
16 or 17." In another, "she's heavier there -- she's 16." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Signs of Emotion 
</P>
<P>
Only when defense attorneys tried to find chinks in her testimony, did strong 
emotion flare. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, defense lawyer Stanley Fleishman showed her a photo on the back 
of a video case. Could she identify her daughter? 
</P>
<P>
"You're showing me a picture of someone's rear end, sir," Briceland snapped. 
"No, I can not identify if that's my daughter." 
</P>
<P>
Briceland had brought other pictures of Nora to court -- family photos for the 
prosecution to use as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Nora Kuzma, she explained, was the second of her four children, all girls. 
Three of the girls were born in Ohio, the fourth in West Virginia, before the 
family moved to Redondo Beach. Briceland and the girls' father are divorced. 
</P>
<P>
Still using the stage name Traci Lords, Nora is 20 years old now and pursuing a 
career in mainstream film and television. 
</P>
<P>
Her mother recalled in testimony that Nora was 15, a high school sophomore, 
when she became "rebellious . . . she was very concerned about money . . . she 
was missing school." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moved Out of Home 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks before her 16th birthday, Nora moved out, her mother said. In the 
years since, she said, they have seen each other "sporadically," perhaps once 
or twice per month. 
</P>
<P>
Some time after Nora left home, Briceland said, she heard a rumor that her 
daughter had become involved in nude modeling. 
</P>
<P>
Nora denied it, but later, when Nora was 17, Briceland saw the layout of 
"Traci" in Penthouse magazine. Soon she learned of the videos. 
</P>
<P>
Briceland said she asked Nora to quit, but her daughter refused. 
</P>
<P>
When she threatened to go to authorities because of Nora's age, "She told me if 
I did that, the people she was involved with would kill her. She told me to 
keep my mouth shut, or I would get her in terrible trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers, interviewed during a break, suggested Briceland was "well 
coached." They voiced doubts about her ability to readily gauge her daughter's 
age from photos and videos. 
</P>
<P>
But on the witness stand, Briceland suggested it was not difficult at all. Nora 
had changed so much, so fast, she explained. 
</P>
<P>
At 15, she was "kind of a chubby adolescent, although she had a nice figure." 
But soon, the pudginess in Nora's body and face disappeared, giving her a 
leaner, more adult look. 
</P>
<P>
"They" kept making Nora's hair lighter and lighter, Briceland said, changing it 
from a natural reddish brown to fair blonde. 
</P>
<P>
She saw other changes in her daughter -- in "the way she smiled" and "the look 
in her eye. 
</P>
<P>
"She started getting very hard, very tough after she started making the 
movies."

STUDENTS SABOTAGE SCHOOL ON STATE TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of seniors at Torrance's academically rigorous West High School 
intentionally flunked the latest California Assessment Program test in an 
attempt to send a message to administrators who they believe place too much 
emphasis on the exam. 
</P>
<P>
School officials said the action sent West High's ratings into a nose dive, 
dropping reading scores from the 85th percentile statewide in 1987-88 to the 
51st percentile this year. On the math portion, the dip was also dramatic, 
falling from the 95th percentile in 1987-88 to the 71st percentile in the 
current academic year. 
</P>
<P>
The students' rebellion has once again raised questions about whether schools 
are under too much pressure to bring in high California Assessment Program 
scores. 
</P>
<P>
The results are often published in newspapers and used within communities to 
compare one school to the next. In addition, home buyers often consult the 
scores in looking for desirable areas with good school districts. 
</P>
<P>
At least one family from out of state "specifically selected our high school 
because we have high CAP scores," West High teacher Brenda McNamara said. "That 
is not unusual." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 50 elementary schools statewide were accused of cheating on third- 
and sixth-grade California Assessment Program tests. Critics said the reason 
for the cheating was pressure on schools to get high scores. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, when the state was offering cash incentives for high 
California Assessment Program scores, students at one Northern California 
school intentionally flunked the exam in a dispute over how the money should be 
spent, according to one state official. 
</P>
<P>
Because the tests were taken anonymously, it is impossible to tell how many of 
West High's 400 seniors were involved in the sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
At the school Wednesday, student body President Kelle Price, who said she did 
not intentionally fail the test, said some seniors became disgruntled when 
teachers interrupted classes to prepare them for the California Assessment 
Program tests. She said students also believed that administrators -- who 
visited classes to stress the importance of doing well -- were too concerned 
with maintaining the school's image. 
</P>
<P>
"They said this is the test that is the school's report card . . . (and) West 
is a really good school and that we all want to keep it up. I think a lot of 
people resented that." 
</P>
<P>
According to West High Principal William Bawden, the intentional flunking of 
the December exam became apparent last week when West High received its scores 
from the state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought that it was the wrong high school . . . and then we got some rumors 
that maybe some of the seniors had sabotaged the test," Bawden said. 
</P>
<P>
He said at least one student admitted intentionally doing poorly on the exam. 
The principal said a quick examination of the students' test booklets, which 
the school received Wednesday, showed an unusual number of wrong answers in 18 
cases, including some booklets that had no correct answers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consistent Scores 
</P>
<P>
Susie Lange, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Education, said the 
"statistical blip" that resulted from the intentional failures will probably 
knock West High out of the running for the state's distinguished school 
program. She said the program, although not based solely on California 
Assessment Program scores, uses consistent scores to measure a school's 
eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
She also said this year's low scores will hurt underclassmen at West High by 
preventing an accurate comparison in future years with this year's senior 
class. 
</P>
<P>
Another state official said a relatively small number of very low scores can 
skew the school average sharply. 
</P>
<P>
Bawden said administrators believed it was necessary to encourage students to 
do their best because the California Assessment Program test, which is used 
only to gauge a school's performance and not that of individual students, does 
not provide an incentive to excel. 
</P>
<P>
At West High, there was much debate Wednesday about who -- if anyone -- places 
too much emphasis on the tests. Bawden blamed the state Department of Education 
and the press, which he said does not publish other indicators of a school's 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Starts at Top 
</P>
<P>
Bill Franchini, who heads the Torrance Teachers Assn., which represents 
teachers in the Torrance Unified School District, blamed it on a trickle-down 
effect, saying the pressure starts with the state Department of Education and 
works its way down through local school districts, principals, teachers and 
eventually students. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that they (students) are feeling like pawns in a game that is much 
bigger than they are," he said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-SCHOOLS OFFICIAL SENTENCED FOR THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A one-time senior Los Angeles Unified School District official was sentenced to 
16 months in state prison Wednesday for his role in a theft ring that stole 
about $1 million worth of supplies from the district. 
</P>
<P>
James Riley, 56, of Lynwood had pleaded no contest in January to the grand 
theft and embezzlement charges. He was fired from his job as director of the 
school district's operations branch after being charged in the case in March, 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Riley's sentence was imposed by Superior Court Judge Gordon Ringer. At the same 
time, the judge also sentenced a second defendant, Robert J. Barrios, 34, of 
Tujunga to five years of probation and ordered him to perform 400 hours of 
community service. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Barrios, a former school district gardener, is to make $28,000 
restitution and pay an additional $5,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 21 defendants were involved in the theft case.

FUGITIVE SUSPECT IN NARCOTICS RING SEIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A reputed international narcotics trafficker and money launderer with ties to 
fugitive federal drug agent Darnell Garcia has been arrested in Laughlin, Nev., 
after nearly two years on the run, authorities announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Conway Willie Waddy Jr., suspected of helping Garcia and two other former Drug 
Enforcement Administration agents conduct a clandestine cocaine and heroin 
trafficking operation out of Los Angeles, was surrounded by federal agents and 
Las Vegas police Tuesday night while shopping in a local video store. He 
quietly surrendered, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
Waddy, who is under indictment in Detroit on charges of laundering millions of 
dollars in drug proceeds and trafficking large quantities of cocaine, is named 
as an unindicted co-conspirator in a February indictment in Los Angeles 
accusing Garcia and fellow former DEA Agents John Jackson and Wayne Countryman 
with conspiring to sell major quantities of heroin and cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brother Still Wanted 
</P>
<P>
Waddy and his brother, Ron, who remains a fugitive, are thought to have been 
protected by the same sophisticated underground network that is helping Garcia 
elude capture, federal authorities said. But despite Waddy's arrest, there is 
still no immediate indication of Garcia's whereabouts, said Assistant U.S. 
Atty. Joyce Karlin, who is supervising the Los Angeles investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for him. Beyond that, I can't comment," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, citing an earlier court-imposed gag order in the case, declined to 
elaborate on the nature of the "network" that is cited in court documents. 
However, the documents say there is "no question" that Garcia has been 
"provided assistance" in eluding authorities since he disappeared Nov. 22. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tip Cited 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents in Los Angeles, Waddy and his brother were tipped 
off to the Detroit investigation by Garcia, who at the time was still working 
at the Los Angeles DEA office, and were given refuge by Garcia in a Bunker Hill 
Towers apartment after a Detroit grand jury indicted them in June, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on tips from Garcia, Ron Waddy is also believed to have tipped off major 
Los Angeles drug dealer Elrader (Ray Ray) Browning to a pending federal 
indictment against him, allowing Browning to flee temporarily to the home of a 
girlfriend, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
John Anthony of the Detroit FBI said the Waddy brothers were originally 
indicted as part of a multimillion-dollar undercover money-laundering 
investigation dubbed Operation Right Turn. They were subsequently indicted on 
charges of selling half a kilogram of cocaine to undercover FBI agents, an 
investigation that led to the discovery of 86 kilograms of cocaine and $100,000 
in cash believed to be connected to the Waddys' drug-trafficking operations, 
Anthony said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles authorities said the Waddys were carrying on their purported 
money-laundering activities in Detroit at a time "when they were associating 
closely with Garcia and Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
Court documents in Los Angeles describe the Waddy brothers as "dangerous 
criminals" with connections to Browning and convicted narcotics kingpin Tootie 
Reese. Ron Waddy, federal authorities said, was an "enforcer" for Reese's 
narcotics organization. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Nicodemus, spokesman for the FBI in Las Vegas, said Conway Waddy had been 
in Laughlin only a few days but apparently had rented or arranged to use a 
condominium there in the name of Cecil Woodard. He was scheduled to be 
arraigned before a federal magistrate in Las Vegas and returned to Detroit for 
trial.

SPIN OF LEGAL WHEELS DULLS LOTTERY WINNER'S $3.4-MILLION OUTLOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doris Barnett's little ball bounced out of the slot again Wednesday when her 
lawyer was notified that California Lottery officials intend to seek a new 
trial in an effort to overturn a jury verdict awarding her $3.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how they can put me through all this," said a weeping Barnett, 
54, the Los Angeles woman who went from $3 million winner to $10,000 placer 
when the ball would not stay put for five seconds in the Big Spin on Dec. 30, 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
Barnett said her attorney, Lawrence Sperber, had warned her that the lottery 
people might appeal and that when he called her Wednesday morning, "I felt 
something was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
After he gave her the bad news, she said, "I sat there for a while, then I just 
started to cry." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Lottery Commission, however, said the notice was filed in 
Los Angeles Superior Court "in order to keep our options open" and did not 
necessarily mean the matter will be pursued. 
</P>
<P>
"We had 15 days to file this," said Joanne McNabb. "No decision has yet been 
made." 
</P>
<P>
Told that Barnett was upset by the move, McNabb said, "It is a very unpleasant 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court jury decided on April 4 that Barnett should receive the $3 
million plus $400,000 in damages for emotional trauma, although the ball on the 
Big Spin wheel did not stay in the grand prize slot for the required five 
seconds, settling instead in a $10,000 niche. 
</P>
<P>
After first announcing that she had won the big money, Geoff Edwards, master of 
ceremonies of the televised Big Spin show, unhappily told her it was a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
When the state sent her a check for $10,000, Barnett refused to cash it and 
filed suit. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors at her trial agreed with her lawyers, Sperber and David B. Shapiro, that 
lottery officials rarely awaited the timer's ruling before announcing a winner. 
</P>
<P>
Sperber said he was surprised by the notice to ask for another trial, because 
"there was so much public support" for his client. 
</P>
<P>
"I was shocked they would do this to her again," he said. "Like they have no 
feeling for her as a human being. She's tremendously upset."

BURNING OF CROSSES IN COUNTY JAIL CONFIRMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN KENDALL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff Sherman Block said Wednesday that an internal investigation has 
confirmed reports that two crosses were burned in the Los Angeles County's 
Men's Central Jail during the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
". . . Now it's a matter of establishing culpability and taking appropriate 
action," Block said. "I would say within 30 days we should have everything 
finalized." 
</P>
<P>
Block limited his remarks at a monthly meeting with reporters to official 
confirmation that crosses had been burned. He avoided comment on possible 
motives and the identification of those thought to be responsible. Any deputy 
found responsible faces discipline ranging from an oral reprimand to discharge 
and possible criminal charges, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jailers who asked to remain anonymous told The Times months ago that white 
deputies had twice set crosses afire. The first cross, the sources said, was 
burned in a corridor as members of the Bloods street gang were filing out for 
breakfast one morning in 1987. The second was burned in January, 1988, in an 
area housing Crip gang members, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Two black inmates, Roosevelt Tellis and Daryl Ransom, said in a jail interview 
that they thought they had been "invaded by the Ku Klux Klan or some sort of 
white supremacy party" when a cross was burned in their module. "We filed 
complaints but they were ignored, and we were threatened and told to leave it 
alone," they said. 
</P>
<P>
Charges that crosses had been burned in quarters housing black street gang 
members first surfaced at a county Civil Service Commission hearing in early 
January. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the sheriff said the investigation took months because of the 
need to interview inmates who are spread throughout the state prison system, or 
back on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Block insisted that the cross-burnings were not the work of Ku Klux Klan 
sympathizers, as charged in a federal lawsuit filed by a former probationary 
sheriff's deputy. 
</P>
<P>
Those allegations were contained in the suit brought by Eugene A. Harris, 22, 
in March. 
</P>
<P>
Harris charged that the Sheriff's Department had failed to properly investigate 
the cross-burnings and had allowed supervisors to press "trumped-up" charges 
that led to his resignation. He was accused of taking a candy bar and hairbrush 
from jail inmates. Harris is seeking reinstatement.

DEATH IS RULED OUT FOR SOLDIER FACING TRIAL FOR ESPIONAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
An Orange County soldier charged with espionage for allegedly passing defense 
secrets to East Germany will stand trial by court-martial, but prosecutors have 
decided not to seek the death penalty, military officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Spec. 4 Michael A. Peri, 21, an expert on Warsaw Pact radar equipment, will go 
on trial June 6 on charges of espionage, illegally entering East Germany, 
possessing classified documents, larceny of military property and making a 
false statement to military authorities, Maj. Samuel Taylor, deputy public 
affairs officer of the 5th Army Corps, said in a telephone interview from 
Frankfurt, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The maximum penalty in espionage cases is death, but Taylor said that the 5th 
Corps commander, Gen. John Woodmansee, decided that Peri's case would not be 
tried as a capital offense. 
</P>
<P>
"The maximum sentence he could receive is life in prison," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor declined to say why Woodmansee declined to seek the death penalty, 
saying only that the decision was based on a review of the evidence and 
interviews with Peri's company and regimental commanders. 
</P>
<P>
Peri, who went to La Quinta High School in Westminster and whose family lives 
in Laguna Niguel, is being held in the Army Confinement Facility in Mannheim, 
West Germany. His parents could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Peri was charged with espionage and the other offenses after he allegedly 
crossed into East Germany and gave officials there sensitive information about 
the defensive deployment of U.S. tanks and helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
Peri, who worked in intelligence with the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment at 
Fulda, West Germany, disappeared Feb. 21 with a military Jeep and a laptop 
computer from his office. He reappeared with the computer 12 days later and 
turned himself in to base officials. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said Peri was charged after an investigation revealed he had taken 
classified documents from a storage area and had given them to East German 
officials. The documents, according to military officials, related to the 11th 
Armored Cavalry's general defense plans, specifically the regiment's role in 
defending itself from an attack by Warsaw Pact forces. 
</P>
<P>
The 11th Armored Cavalry is positioned on the strategic Fulda Gap, a 
traditional invasion route to Western Europe and a likely avenue for 
Soviet-bloc tanks in the event of war. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said Peri had retained two civilian attorneys in addition to two 
attorneys provided by the military. Heading the defense team is Maj. William G. 
Stokes, senior defense counsel for the Trial Defense Service based in 
Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
According to Taylor, Peri will be held in the Mannheim facility until the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said Peri has two choices: a court-martial before one military judge, 
who would hear the case and then rule on Peri's guilt or innocence, or a trial 
before a panel of at least five military officers. 
</P>
<P>
He said the trial would be held in the Abrams Courtroom at the Abrams complex 
in Frankfurt, headquarters for the 5th Army Corps in West Germany.

190 ABORTION FOES PLEAD NO CONTEST; SENTENCES CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a mass bargain with prosecutors, about 190 Operation Rescue anti-abortion 
protesters entered no-contest pleas in return for reduced sentences Wednesday 
on misdemeanor charges stemming from their arrest March 23 at a family-planning 
clinic in Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants filled two Westminster courtrooms to answer charges of failing 
to disperse after being ordered to move from clinic doorways. Orange County 
district attorney's officials offered the deal to avoid the expense of separate 
trials if all defendants had pleaded innocent. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a ridiculous expense to try all of these cases individually," said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Jan Nolan. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors agreed not to seek the maximum penalty of 6 months in jail and 
$1,000 in fines if the defendants would accept any of three options: pay $75 in 
court costs, pay no court costs but spend 2 days in jail, or perform 2 days of 
public-service work with the California Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Choose Caltrans Work 
</P>
<P>
Most defendants chose to work 2 days for Caltrans, and all entered no-contest 
pleas; the plea is not an admission of guilt but has the same legal 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
"No one pleaded guilty today because we don't believe we are guilty of 
anything," said Irina McGuirk, a spokeswoman for the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Another 180 Operation Rescue defendants failed to appear at the arraignment but 
were represented by lawyers and were granted continuances. Prosecutors said 
that they cannot guarantee that those defendants will get the same offer. But 
McGuirk said she is confident that the deal with hold. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel the same opportunity will be given to the other 180 as we plan to 
continue our talks with the district attorney's office," McGuirk said. 
</P>
<P>
The 370 Operation Rescue demonstrators had been arrested as they blocked 
doorways at the Cypress clinic to prevent women from entering to receive 
abortion counseling. As a group of pro-choice demonstrators engaged in an angry 
shouting match with the anti-abortionists, scores of police moved in and made 
the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Both prosecutors and defendants said Wednesday that they were satisfied that a 
plea-bargain had been reached. But there was some early doubt that a compromise 
would be achieved. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan first told the defendants that their only option was to plead guilty or 
no contest. Then, she said, first-time violators would be assessed $75 in court 
costs, and those with prior protest arrests would have to pay $125. Nolan 
mentioned no option for jail time or public service work. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Operation Rescue leaders Kenneth Tanner and Will Lehman 
quickly telephoned Randall Terry to get his opinion. Terry, 29, of Binghamton, 
N.Y., is the founder of Operation Rescue -- a national effort to "rescue" 
unborn babies by protesting abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposed Plea-Bargain 
</P>
<P>
Lehman returned to say that Terry opposed the plea-bargain. "Randall said there 
should be an option where people who didn't want to pay money could go to 
jail," Lehman told the group. "He has asked us all to stand in solidarity in 
this, and if we don't get the option for jail, we should all demand trials." 
</P>
<P>
Terry was among those arrested at the Cypress demonstration. But on Wednesday, 
he was in New York, helping to plan national anti-abortion demonstrations 
scheduled for Saturday. He was represented by an attorney at the arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan said she had made no jail recommendation when she took the proposed 
bargain to various judges who were conducting the arraignments. "But I did tell 
the judges that this was what the defendants had talked about," she said. "The 
judges apparently agreed." 
</P>
<P>
As negotiations ebbed and flowed during the day, the anti-abortion group 
periodically held prayer meetings and sang hymns in the sunny courtyard in 
front of the Westminster Municipal Building. 
</P>
<P>
Lehman, 31, at one point told fellow defendants to pray for forgiveness: "We 
should pray to the Lord to forgive us for waiting 16 years to do something 
(about legal abortion)." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the defendants noted that the U.S. Supreme Court currently is hearing a 
Missouri case that might change the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized 
abortion in the first 3 months of pregnancy.

BLOODY SHEETS ALLEGEDLY LINK PAIR IN DUERR SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police have seized bloodstained sheets and linens that they believe link both a 
longtime boyfriend and a high-school acquaintance with last week's stabbing 
death of Denise Marie Duerr of Garden Grove, court documents revealed 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Search warrant affidavits indicate that Duerr, 22, was fatally stabbed with an 
ice pick at least 14 times in or near her own apartment, then wrapped in 
bloodstained sheets, put in the trunk of her 1984 Fiero and dumped in the hills 
near Corona. 
</P>
<P>
Charged in Duerr's murder are Cameron C. Seaholm, 22, a drifter who knew the 
victim in high school, and Clyde Spontak, 22, of Garden Grove, a friend of 
Seaholm's who lived with Duerr on and off during a stormy 6-year relationship. 
Police have not established a motive for the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
The documents filed in Superior Court in Riverside also include a statement by 
Seaholm that he and Spontak had planned to sell a quarter-kilogram of cocaine 
about the time of the killing. The cocaine was in Spontak's possession, 
Seaholm's statement says. 
</P>
<P>
In the statement to police, Seaholm acknowledged dumping the body but insisted 
that he had nothing to do with the slaying. He said he stole Duerr's car while 
coming down from a cocaine high and found the victim's partially decomposed and 
still-bleeding body only after the car got a flat tire and he had to open the 
trunk. 
</P>
<P>
An Orange County firefighter confirmed that he saw a Fiero with tire trouble at 
the approximate spot and time cited by Seaholm, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
But investigators said they they do not believe the rest of Seaholm's 
explanation. "We've got some other evidence that I can't talk about that would 
seem to shoot 
</P>
<P>
down that story," said Sgt. David Weiss of the Riverside County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
"We've shown a lot of inconsistencies in his story so far, and we think 
(Seaholm and Spontak) were both involved in the murder," Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said it was inconsistency in Spontak's story that also led them 
to suspect the boyfriend in the killing. 
</P>
<P>
After Duerr's partially clad body was found April 19 near the Riverside Freeway 
south of Corona, Spontak grieved openly and said he had last seen his 
girlfriend alive as she headed for work one morning a few days before. 
</P>
<P>
But investigators said contradictory evidence was uncovered Saturday in a 
search of the Garden Grove apartment that Spontak shared with Duerr. At the 
Monroe Street apartment, police found what appeared to be bloodstains on a 
mattress, the mattress cover and the garage floor. Bloodied sheets had earlier 
been found in the car. 
</P>
<P>
Laboratory tests comparing the blood samples to Duerr's blood type have not 
been completed, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators also hoped to find at the apartment the ice pick used in the 
slaying but came up empty handed, court documents show. Nonetheless, 
investigators said they were so convinced by the evidence uncovered in the 
search that they arrested Spontak on suspicion of murder 6 hours after entering 
the apartment Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arraignment Wednesday 
</P>
<P>
Arraignment for both Spontak, a sound electrician, and Seaholm is scheduled for 
Wednesday in Riverside County Municipal Court in Corona. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to evidence found at the apartment, a neighbor has acknowledged 
that, at the request of Spontak, he lied to police about having seen Spontak 
kiss Duerr goodby on the morning of her disappearance, Riverside Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Daniel C. Lough said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In the statement to police, Seaholm said that for virtually the entire weekend 
just before he stole Duerr's car to visit his stepparents' home in Lake 
Elsinore, he had stayed high on cocaine that he had stolen from Spontak. 
</P>
<P>
His statement said that Seaholm and Spontak had spent much of that weekend 
packing for resale a quarter-kilo of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that amount of cocaine would carry a street value of about $4,000.

ANOTHER CHUNK OF BLUFF SLIPS, ILLUSTRATING A FACT OF LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN R. CHURM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dale Dillon had just announced that a 1 1/2-mile stretch of Coast Highway north 
of San Clemente would reopen within the hour when a new chunk of the bluff gave 
way, depositing more rock and dirt on the roadway Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Dust from the latest slide hadn't even settled, when Dillon, a county official, 
turned to a group of nearby workers. "All bets are off," he said. "Mother 
Nature isn't cooperating." 
</P>
<P>
It's a fact of life that motorists and homeowners in north San Clemente and 
Capistrano Beach have known for years. 
</P>
<P>
The sandstone and clay bluffs, rising sharply about 100 feet above the two-lane 
highway, are prone to give way at a moment's notice. Wind, rain and time have 
weakened the bluffs, which tower over the roadway and a narrow band of homes on 
the beach below. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 8:30 a.m. Tuesday, nearly 2,000 cubic yards of dirt broke loose 
and spilled across Coast Highway just north of Camino Capistrano. No one was 
hurt, but five homes on the bluff top lost portions of their back yards. The 
highway was closed for more than 35 hours, forcing traffic to be rerouted 
around the area. It was finally reopened to through traffic Wednesday night, 
but Dillon said there are no guarantees that the bluffs won't slip again. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the fourth slide of this magnitude in the last 15 years and there's 
really no way of telling what caused it," said Dillon, chief of public 
facilities operations for the county's Environmental Management Agency. "More 
than likely, it's probably nature running its course." 
</P>
<P>
That was little comfort Wednesday to the five homeowners who lost 10 to 20 feet 
of their yards and in two cases, lost portions of concrete patios. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a shock. It was like someone took a big bite out of my patio," 
said Edward Makasjian after inspecting the damage to his home in the 2800 block 
of La Ventana for the first time on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The semi-retired real estate agent, who lives in Downey and plans to move full 
time into the San Clemente home with his wife this summer, said he plans to 
rebuild the patio, and will be "content with what is left of his yard." But he 
believes the city should erect some type of retaining wall along the edge of 
the bluff to prevent another slide. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente officials, however, 
</P>
<P>
mailed letters to the five residents on Wednesday, advising them to hire 
private geologists to evaluate the damage to their yards and make 
recommendations on appropriate measures to stabilize the slope below their 
homes. Huynh Trang, a city building inspector, said the homeowners actually own 
the slope and therefore are responsible for taking corrective action, if 
necessary, to stabilize it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's up to the homeowners," Trang said. "Obviously, once they settle on a plan 
they must get city approval to make those improvements." 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the slide may be impossible to determine but moisture is often a 
factor, Dillon said. Residents living on top of the bluff often over-water 
their yards, and the excess moisture easily makes its way through the porous 
sandstone below. But when the water hits a layer of impervious clay, it begins 
to move laterally, causing the sandstone to slip with it. 
</P>
<P>
In the area around the slide, portions of the bluff at varying heights appeared 
wet Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"That clay gets as slick as wet concrete," he said. "And the slope just gives."

KRAFT DEFENSE ASKS JURY NOT TO CONFUSE SUSPICION AND PROOF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attorneys for Randy Steven Kraft told the jury Wednesday that they had a right 
to be suspicious of Kraft's involvement in several of the 16 murders he is 
charged with committing. But they urged jurors not to confuse suspicion with 
proof beyond a reasonable doubt. 
</P>
<P>
"If you put up enough different charges, you could come up with a scenario that 
could convict a Pope," Kraft attorney James G. Merwin warned them. 
</P>
<P>
The defense has so far spent 1 1/2 days on closing arguments at Kraft's trial 
in Santa Ana, which is now in its ninth month. Some legal experts predict that 
it will be the most expensive criminal proceeding in the state's history. 
</P>
<P>
The defense is scheduled to complete closing arguments this morning, and will 
be followed by rebuttal arguments from the prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan 
F. Brown. Lengthy jury instructions must be given, however, before jurors can 
begin deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the 16 murders he is being tried for, Kraft, 44, a computer consultant 
from Long Beach, is accused by prosecutors of 29 other murders in three states. 
All the victims were young men, mostly between the ages of 18 and 25, whose 
sexually abused bodies often were found dumped by a freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The trial had been delayed for nearly 5 years while the Kraft lawyers pleaded 
with the courts for more time to put together a defense against so many murder 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft was arrested on May 14, 1983, when two California Highway Patrol officers 
who stopped him for a traffic violation in Mission Viejo found Terry Lee 
Gambrel, a 25-year-old Marine, dead in the front passenger seat of his car. 
</P>
<P>
The defense recognizes the compelling evidence against Kraft in the Gambrel 
death. But Kraft attorney C. Thomas McDonald pleaded with jurors not to convict 
him on all 16 deaths just because of Gambrel. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be easy to look at Gambrel and say, well he must have killed all 16," 
McDonald said Wednesday. He urged the jurors to judge each of the murders in 
the charges individually. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft alternated between watching his attorneys intently and taking notes in 
his lavender-colored note pad. Two of his sisters and other Kraft family 
members sat in a group directly behind him. Some of them nodded approval when 
McDonald told jurors that the evidence showed Kraft to be a hard worker who was 
admired by co-workers and who had never been known to commit a violent act. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald cited the weekend of Feb. 12 and 13, 1983, when Geoffrey Alan Nelson, 
18, and Rodger James DeVaul, 20, were killed. They had last been seen walking 
together near Cypress College. When their bodies were found, Nelson had been 
emasculated and DeVaul had been sodomized. 
</P>
<P>
Those two deaths are among the prosecution's stronger cases, because 
photographs of DeVaul, with a ligature mark on his neck and one of his wrists 
bound, were found in Kraft's house.

$22,000 IN MENSWEAR SLASHED AT 2 SOUTH COAST PLAZA STORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
More than $22,000 worth of expensive men's suits, dress shoes and jogging 
clothes at two South Coast Plaza department stores have been slashed, Costa 
Mesa police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A sharp instrument was used to slash 1- to 1 1/2-inch cuts in the upper left 
back sides of jackets and the tops of shoes at Nordstrom and Bullock's, 
officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Bullock's reported that 21 jackets, all dark blue or dark gray pinstripe 
designer suits priced at $375 to $900 each, were vandalized. Nordstrom reported 
10 jackets from jogging suits worth $170 each, two pairs of dress shoes worth 
more than $200 each and nine suits worth $355 to $1,095 were slashed. In all 
cases, jacket sizes ranged from 36 to 44. 
</P>
<P>
More than $48,000 in men's suits in the same size range were slashed in the 
same manner between November, 1986, and July, 1987, at stores in Newport Beach 
and Costa Mesa. Police wouldn't speculate on it being the work of the same 
person.

4 BANDITS PULL A 'SMASH-AND-ROB' HEIST AT MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Robbers held customers and employees at gunpoint as they smashed glass cases 
and left with jewelry from Robinson's in Westminster Mall, police said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The four robbers, wearing ski masks, entered the store at 9 p.m. Tuesday, 
shortly before closing time, and went straight to the jewelry cases on the 
second floor, officers reported. 
</P>
<P>
One man waved a silver revolver at people while the other robbers shattered the 
display cases with a sledgehammer and grabbed the jewels, Westminster Police 
Lt. Mike Ratliff said. 
</P>
<P>
A security officer who had seen the men enter the store with a sledgehammer 
called police, who arrived within a minute after the men had fled, Ratliff 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The robbers escaped through a second floor exit into a parking lot, where a 
dark, American-made station wagon was waiting for them, witnesses told police. 
</P>
<P>
The theft was similar to nearly 30 "smash-and-rob" holdups that have occurred 
in Orange County since 1983. In the past year, eight jewelry store robberies 
have occurred in the county, four of them in malls. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a whole systematized operation," Ratliff said. "There have been cases 
where security cameras have filmed this kind of crime. The time the robbers 
come into the store, hold people at gunpoint, smash the cases, scoop up the 
jewelry and leave takes all of 2 minutes," he explained, adding: 
</P>
<P>
"The key is that you know what you're doing, you work together and you're very 
fast. Usually the crime is planned and the place was cased previously, so it 
doesn't take more than a few minutes to pull it off." 
</P>
<P>
In January, four robbers held customers and employees at gunpoint in a Buena 
Park Mall jewelry store and left with about $100,000 in merchandise. Also that 
month, three masked bandits robbed the jewelry department of Robinson's in the 
MainPlace/Santa Ana mall shortly before closing time, escaping with an unknown 
amount of jewelry. No one was arrested in either of the thefts. 
</P>
<P>
Ratliff theorized that thieves sometimes prey on stores in malls because the 
crowds and confusion aid their escape. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a whole lot of these that occur, and I don't think the same people 
might have done it, but the method is very similar," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ratliff added that police have no clear description of Tuesday's getaway car or 
what the men were wearing. Robinson's officials were still tallying their loss.

EVEN IN TOP FORM, WINLESS MORRIS CAN'T BUY HIMSELF A VICTORY; 
</P>
<P>
ANGERED OVER STORY, RIGHT-HANDER AS QUIET AS TIGER BATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The winningest pitcher of the 1980s remains the losingest pitcher of April 
1989. Jack Morris -- Detroit Tiger legend, all-star, hard-luck case -- can't 
catch a break, to say nothing of a victory. 
</P>
<P>
Morris took his un-Morris-like 0-4 record into Anaheim Stadium Wednesday 
evening and left 0-5, despite allowing just one run -- Brian Downing's 
second-inning homer -- and four hits. Problem was, the Tiger offense provided 
Morris with plenty of hits, but nothing else. In essence, the Tigers teased him 
by putting 13 runners on base . . . and leaving them there. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough when you pitch like that and you don't score no runs," said Detroit 
Manager Sparky Anderson, puffing on his postgame pipe. "He's lost, 2-1 (against 
Milwaukee last Friday), and 1-0. That's pretty hard. He got beat in Texas, 4-1, 
and they didn't even hit it hard." 
</P>
<P>
Turns out that logic and runs both have escaped Morris' reach. For instance, 
who would have guessed that Morris would be winless after five starts? Or that 
the Tigers wouldn't be able to provide him with a single lead? Or that Morris, 
angered by a recent story, would issue his own gag order, meaning no more chats 
with the media? 
</P>
<P>
It has happened, though -- all of it, much to the surprise of those who know 
him best. 
</P>
<P>
"He still throws the same stuff he threw when I caught him," said former 
batterymate Lance Parrish, who went zero for three against his pal. "I thought 
he pitched a heck of a ballgame. Those are games that you expect to win." 
</P>
<P>
Morris had to sit and watch the Tigers put runners on base in each inning. Then 
he had to watch them stay there. Especially frustrating must have been the 
fifth inning, when Detroit had men on first and second with no outs; the sixth, 
when the Tigers again put two more men on; and the eighth, when they loaded the 
bases. Each time . . . nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the outcome, it was a vintage Morris performance. He pitched a 
complete game, struck out seven and at one point, retired 15 of 17 batters. A 
single Downing swing turned out to be his downfall. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see what his problem was: He was having trouble getting his forkball and 
slider over," said Angel Manager Doug Rader. "But as the game progressed, there 
were fewer and fewer good pitches to hit. He's tough. I've never seen the guy 
pitch bad." 
</P>
<P>
With that, Rader glanced at an Angel schedule taped to his office wall and 
began counting the games until the Angels travel to Detroit. The reason: to see 
if his team would have to face Morris. As the rotation would have it, the 
Angels are likely to be spared. 
</P>
<P>
Rader glanced heavenward and then made the sign of the cross on his chest. 
"Looks like we'll miss him," he said. 
</P>
<P>
No one was panicking in the Tiger clubhouse, certainly not the eternal 
optimist, Anderson. By Anderson's way of thinking, the problem isn't with 
Morris' arm, but with Tiger bats. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not concerned with him not throwing good," Anderson said. "I'd like to see 
us score some runs." 
</P>
<P>
So desperate was Anderson for something other than zeroes, that he OK'd a 
sacrifice bunt in the ninth inning to move Pat Sheridan from first to second. 
It worked, but cost the Tigers an out. Two batters later, the game was over. 
</P>
<P>
"Just trying to score," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers, of course, are aware of Morris' record. In a way, they feel 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that in his five starts Jack has had this year, we haven't scored much 
for him," third baseman Chris Brown said. "If I was him, I would feel a little 
down. But it's a long season. I know he's going to keep pitching good and we're 
going to score some runs." 
</P>
<P>
The prediction is seconded by Parrish, who may know better than almost anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a matter of time before he comes around," Parrish said. "Just 
because he's 0-5 doesn't reflect on the pitcher he is. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't throw a ball much better than he did tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe you can, but the way things are going for Morris these days, it probably 
wouldn't matter.

<P>
LOARA WINS WITH A 10-RUN INNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Loara High School's 10-run inning Wednesday was just enough to end Los 
Alamitos' seven-game winning streak and create a two-way tie for first in the 
Empire League. 
</P>
<P>
Loara overcame an 8-1 deficit by scoring 10 runs in a wild fifth inning and 
edged Los Alamitos, 11-10, on a windy afternoon at Loara. 
</P>
<P>
Loara (10-10 overall, 7-3 in league play) sent 15 batters to the plate in the 
fifth and pounded three Los Alamitos pitchers for nine hits, including six in a 
row, to erase the Griffins' seven-run lead. Chris Hoffman's two-run double to 
the gap in left-center and Czach Hallock's two-out triple down the right-field 
line that scored the go-ahead runs were the key blows in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos (12-9, 7-3) held an 8-1 lead after three innings of play, 
capitalizing on six walks and flexing its muscles with home runs by Anthony 
Napolitano and Doug Kieck. 
</P>
<P>
Napolitano hit a three-run homer in the second inning over the 343-foot sign in 
right field that gave Los Alamitos a 5-0 lead. Kieck's two-run homer over the 
325-foot sign in left field pushed the Griffins ahead, 8-1, in the third. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Gragnano, Los Alamitos' starting pitcher, allowed a solo homer by Loara's 
Matt Draber in the second that hooked just inside the left-field foul pole. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept telling my players that we only needed one big inning, but I didn't 
expect anything like that," said Roby Megill, Loara coach. "I didn't even 
realize we had scored that many runs." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Gibson, Los Alamitos coach, was well aware of how many runs Loara scored. 
Afterward, Gibson voiced his displeasure with his pitching staff's inability to 
protect a big lead. 
</P>
<P>
"This looked like it was going to be an easy one," Gibson said. "I was thinking 
about subbing some kids in the last two innings. You would think that when a 
team scores 10 runs, they're going to win the game." 
</P>
<P>
Loara had 11 runs going into the sixth and that almost wasn't enough. Los 
Alamitos quickly narrowed an 11-8 deficit to one run when Gragnano hit a 
two-run homer to right, giving the Griffins their third homer of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos had the tying run on with no outs after Darren Sugiyama opened the 
seventh with a single and got a big break when Loara catcher Chris Hoffman 
misplayed a sacrifice bunt attempt. 
</P>
<P>
But Sugiyama took the Griffins out of the inning when he was called out at 
third trying to advance on the bunt. Loara retired the next two batters to hang 
on for an unlikely win. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time we played Los Alamitos, we had a 6-0 lead and lost, 10-6," 
Megill said. "After the fifth inning, I walked by Mike and asked him, 'Does 
this look familiar?' A win like this has got to pump the kids up." 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado 5, Cypress 1 -- Jay Hassell (2-2) pitched a one-hitter for El Dorado 
at home. Hassell, a senior, had a no-hitter going until the sixth inning when 
he gave up a leadoff single. Hassell struck out 10 and walked just one for the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Luke went two for three with a double and an RBI, and Dave Moore went two 
for four with an RBI, a double, and two stolen bases for El Dorado (13-8, 5-5). 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza 7, Katella 3 -- Roger Weems (2-3) pitched 6 1/3 innings and Brian 
Pickler pitched the final two-thirds of an inning for the save for host 
Esperanza (8-8-2, 2-7-1). Keith McDonald, and Rich Hills had solo home runs for 
Esperanza. Hills also had a double. Katella falls to 13-7, 6-4.

WESTERN SHORTSTOP PINKERTON DECIDES TO PLAY SOFTBALL AT CAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ivy Pinkerton of Western High School has signed a letter of intent to play 
softball for Cal, her father, Troy Pinkerton, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Pinkerton, a shortstop, will join former Orange League rival Michele Granger of 
Valencia at Cal. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Pinkerton split time as a pitcher and shortstop with a .915 
fielding percentage and was named to The Times' all-county team. She chose Cal 
over Nevada Las Vegas, Notre Dame, Northwestern, Georgia State and Cal State 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Charisse Kiino of Woodbridge High School has signed a letter of intent to play 
volleyball at Princeton, said her father, Ron Kiino. 
</P>
<P>
Kiino has been a three-year starter in volleyball and softball. She was named 
All-Pacific Coast League in the 1987-88 and again in volleyball last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Kiino has a 4.1 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Sheff, Laguna Hills' multi-sport athlete, has signed a national letter of 
intent to attend Pepperdine, where he will play baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Sheff, who also played basketball for the Hawks, leads the county in runs 
scored with 25 and is among the county leaders in hits (25) and triples (3). 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo's Julie Foudy, The Times' player of the year in soccer for the 
past three years, has made an oral commitment to attend Stanford in the fall, 
said her mother, Judy Foudy. 
</P>
<P>
Foudy, who led Mission Viejo to three consecutive Southern Section 
championships from 1985-87, visited Cal, Harvard, Yale and North Carolina -- 
the six-time defending national champion -- before deciding on Stanford.

COUNTY HAD 11 OF 25 BIGGEST DEALS IN SOUTHLAND REAL ESTATE LAST YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eleven of the 25 biggest real estate deals in Southern California last year 
occurred in Orange County, according to a San Diego market-research firm. 
</P>
<P>
The number of local deals, led by the $83-million sale of two Newport Center 
office buildings, exceeded by three the eight sales in Los Angeles County, 
COMPS Inc. reported. But the Los Angeles deals involved more money. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County sales added up to $511 million, or 36% of the $1.4-billion 
total, COMPS said. The eight Los Angeles deals totaled $656 million, or 46%. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County transactions included four office and retail projects, four 
land parcels and three apartment complexes. 
</P>
<P>
The statistics underscored the county's active real estate market last year and 
the rising cost of real estate, especially the cost of land for new residential 
housing developments. 
</P>
<P>
"Our clients were looking at land prices and saying, 'If I buy this, I'll never 
be able to build something for a price I could sell it at,' " said S. Kelly 
McDermott, vice president of Market Profiles, a Costa Mesa market-research 
firm. He added: 
</P>
<P>
"But then they'd say, 'If I don't buy it, somebody else will.' So they bought 
it and built the houses and behold -- the houses sold at what would have been 
unbelievable prices just a little while before." 
</P>
<P>
It was also a year in which there were some fairly big purchases of office 
buildings, although the 1988 buyers, unlike those in 1987's bigger deals, were 
not Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
"There was much broader interest in Orange County office buildings than there 
has been in the past," said Scott Perley, a vice president of the commercial 
real estate brokerage of Cushman &amp; Wakefield of California Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"The buying wasn't a lot more aggressive, but a lot of people were looking 
because office-leasing activity is still strong," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Also high on the 1988 list were apartment complexes. Investors believe that 
high home prices will keep many residents renting and that the county's booming 
economy will attract plenty of new residents to fill the complexes. The problem 
is that hardly anybody is selling, so prices remain high even though renter 
demand shows signs of softening. 
</P>
<P>
The two biggest transactions of 1988 were both in Los Angeles: the sales of the 
Fox Plaza for $320 million and the Sanwa Bank building for $88 million. 
</P>
<P>
The 11 Orange County deals follow, listed according to size. 
</P>
<P>
* The sale of the two office buildings at Newport Center in Newport Beach 
ranked third on the Southern California list. Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co. 
sold the office buildings and a restaurant for $83 million -- $309 per square 
foot -- to the California State Teachers Retirement System. The sale was 
believed to have set a record for the highest price per square foot paid for 
offices in Orange County. The transaction did not include the insurance 
company's headquarters building nearby. 
</P>
<P>
* Three office buildings known as Nexus Financial Center on Parker Street in 
Orange were 4th on the list of 25. The buyer was JMB Realty Trust, a Chicago 
real estate investment firm that has been acquiring a lot of property in 
Southern California. The seller, receiving $58.2 million, was Nexus Equities 
U.S.A., a Newport Beach developer. 
</P>
<P>
* Ranking 5th was 416 acres of undeveloped land between Oso and Marguerite 
parkways sold by the Mission Viejo Co. to Home Capitol Corp. and its partner, 
Irvine home builder Barratt American Inc., for construction of up to 1,500 
homes in a development called Pacific Hills. The price was $57.5 million. The 
Mission Viejo Co. announced in 1987 that it was getting out of the 
home-building business and has made several large land sales recently. This 
deal was believed to be one of the largest land deals in recent times in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
* Charter Centre, a high-rise office building and retail complex at Beach 
Boulevard and Warner Avenue, was sold by Mola Development Corp. for $55 million 
and ranked 8th. Guardian Savings &amp; Loan Assn. was the buyer of the 
3-year-old complex, housing Mola's corporate headquarters. Although the 
building was 90% leased, the high price surprised some in the industry because 
the building is outside the bustling John Wayne Airport area. Guardian said it 
would move its headquarters to the office tower. 
</P>
<P>
* Two office buildings and a garage on Dupont Drive in Irvine, called Dupont 
Centre, ranked 9th. They were sold for $51.2 million by Dupont Centre 
Associates, a partnership of the Canadian company BCE Development and Legacy 
Office Development Co. in Irvine. The buyer was USAA Real Estate Co., a 
subsidiary of pension-fund adviser USAA in San Antonio, Tex. With 250,000 
square feet of space, the buildings sold for about $210 per square foot, about 
average for office deals in the county last year. 
</P>
<P>
* The Mission Viejo Co. sold 161 acres off Marguerite Parkway in Mission Viejo 
to J.M. Peters Co. The price was $42.9 million and the transaction ranked 13th. 
Peters, a Newport Beach home builder, is building a $200-million, 904-unit 
community for the elderly called Palmia on the site, the company's first foray 
into that kind of housing. Peters also had the 22nd-biggest transaction on the 
list, a $30.6-million purchase of 49.5 acres from Griffin Homes in Calabasas in 
Los Angeles County near the Ventura County line, an area of extremely expensive 
luxury homes that is just now being intensively developed. 
</P>
<P>
* The 448-unit Casa Del Sol apartment complex on Brookhurst Avenue went for 
$35.3 million and ranked 18th. The seller was Matteson Investment Corp. and the 
buyer was Richard J. Battaglia of Huntington Beach, a 45-year-old developer of 
overseas amusement parks and a local real estate magnate. The deal was part of 
a tax-deferred transaction that included the sale of Battaglia's 242-unit 
Woodlake Village apartments in La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
* Ranking 19th was another land transaction: 153 acres off Avenida Pico outside 
San Clemente. Apartments, condominiums, a hotel and stores will be built on 90 
of those acres. The area is surrounded by big housing developments. Selling the 
parcel for $35.2 million was the local development arm of Western Savings &amp; 
Loan Assn., a troubled Phoenix thrift that owns a lot of land in the Rancho San 
Clemente area and has been operating under the supervision of federal 
regulators since last year. The buyer was a partnership called Rancho San 
Clemente Town Center Associates, which is half-owned by a company called Shanco 
Inc., which is in turn owned by Byron Tarnutzer of the Newport Beach 
development firm Tarnutzer Cos. The other half of Town Center Associates is 
owned by Hexagon Group, a subsidiary of the British clothing manufacturer 
Burton PLC. Tarnutzer said the land has recently been rezoned to accommodate 
the apartments, condos and stores. 
</P>
<P>
* In 20th place was the Somerset Park apartment complex on Jefferson Avenue in 
Placentia. Buying for $33.2 million was the Pacific Co. Selling was Somerset 
Park Development. 
</P>
<P>
* Ranking 21st was another piece of land bought by J.M. Peters and a partner, 
Canadian home builder Bramalea California Inc. in Costa Mesa. That parcel was 
282 acres off Portola Parkway northeast of El Toro, planned for residential 
development. The price was $33 million and the seller was Foothill Ranch Co., a 
partnership of Hon Development Co. of Laguna Hills, said to be one of the 
largest landowners in the county. Peters said it plans to build 500 homes on 
its share of the land. 
</P>
<P>
* Another apartment-complex sale ranked 25th, the Wimbledon Glen apartments on 
Buckingham Drive in Costa Mesa. Selling for $26.8 million was Wells Fargo Bank. 
The buyer was Arnel Management Co., a subsidiary of the giant Costa Mesa 
apartment developer and manager Arnel Development Co. 
</P>
<P>
COMPS warned that it only reports deals that it can confirm, so some large 
transactions for which details couldn't be obtained may have been left out. 
</P>
<P>

SOME BIG REAL ESTATE DEALS IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
<P>
Of the 25 biggest real estate deals in Southern California last year, 11 
occurred in Orange County, according to COMPS Inc., a San Diego market research 
firm. Four of the transactions involved office developments, and the others 
were purchases of apartments and land for residential development.

<P>
AMONG THE PAYOFFS FOR LIVING IN O.C. ARE REGULAR MERIT RAISES, STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If your salary is good, and pay raises come with regularity, you probably owe 
it to the county's high cost of housing and low unemployment rate. Those are 
the factors that cause local companies to fork over better-than-average pay 
raises to executives. 
</P>
<P>
County firms are in the top quarter of U.S. companies in the amount they budget 
for merit raises -- annual performance-based pay increases. 
</P>
<P>
A recent study by TPF&amp;C, a worldwide personnel consulting firm, has 
surveyed budgets for merit raises set aside by 1,500 companies in 25 U.S. 
regions. The study checked how those budgets increase from year to year. 
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, merit raises paid to top management by companies in 
Milwaukee rose 6.4% in 1989, giving it the best rating of all areas surveyed. 
The worst was Houston, where merit raise budgets rose by just 4.6%. 
</P>
<P>
The study showed Orange County in a four-way tie for fourth place in the 
merit-raise derby; firms here increased their merit raise budgets by 5.6% in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco, where merit raise budgets rose 5.7%, and San Diego, where 
budgets rose 6.2%, were the only areas besides Milwaukee to best Orange County. 
Eighteen other regions -- including Los Angeles -- came in below. 
</P>
<P>
Sky-high housing costs and subterranean unemployment levels account for county 
firms' generosity, said Lawrence A. Wangler, who oversees compensation 
practices at TPF&amp;C's Newport Beach office. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so terribly difficult to bring someone (workers) into Orange County 
because of the cost of housing," Wangler said. "If you're an employer, you're 
more willing to provide a little more compensation to keep people here and in 
their jobs, because it's a lot less expensive than trying to bring somebody new 
in to fill a job."

Newport Pharmaceuticals International Inc. of Newport Beach reported net income 
of $267,000 for the first quarter, including a one-time gain of $165,000 from 
the repurchase of company debt securities. The results also reflect a reduction 
in the company's research and development spending following completion of 
clinical trials on the drug Isoprinosine. The company had a loss of $190,000 in 
the same quarter last year. Revenue for the 3-month period was $9.5 million, 
compared with $8.5 million a year ago.

EIP Microwave Inc. reported net income of $242,000 for the second quarter ended 
March 31. It had a loss of $442,000 for the same period a year ago. Sales rose 
29%, to $3.4 million from $2.6 million. The company attributed the turnaround 
to restructuring during the previous year and an emphasis on expanding base 
business. For the 6 months, net income totaled $50,000, which included a 
$748,000 gain from an accounting change. The company lost $1.2 million for the 
first half of last year. Sales jumped 28%, to $6.5 million from $5.1 million. 
Results for the current 6 months also include a pre-tax charge to operations of 
$1.1 million, resulting from the write-down of assets associated with the 
company's realignment of technical, financial and management resources. EIP, 
with headquarters in Newport Beach, manufactures microwave test and measurement 
instruments, which are predominantly used in the defense and telecommunications 
industries.

HOW PARENTS CAN RESPOND TO FEARS; 
</P>
<P>
TALK TO CHILDREN ABOUT THEIR CONCERNS, EXPERTS ADVISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY JO KOCHAKIAN, The Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Children hear about others their age who have been attacked and killed in 
schools in California and Illinois. They may have heard of the death threats 
made against other schoolchildren, which happened recently in Brooklyn. They 
may have heard about the 13-year-old boy who was gunned down on his way to 
school in Hartford. And they wonder, "Can it happen to me? How safe am I?" 
</P>
<P>
Parents confronted with such questions may want to avoid the issue altogether. 
But a "don't worry about it" response is exactly what the child does not need. 
He or she needs to express those fears. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to find out what their fantasies and fears are; only by doing that 
can you give them any kind of reassurance," says Dr. Edward Futterman, a child 
psychiatrist and clinical professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at the Yale 
Child Study Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you're able to identify what a kid is feeling, it gives them permission 
to talk about it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fear Is Aroused 
</P>
<P>
Parents can assume that if a child learns of a disaster, accident or violent 
incident -- especially one involving children -- some fear is being aroused 
that may need to be discussed. 
</P>
<P>
When adults hear about a Pan Am flight being blown out of the sky over 
Scotland, it's going to cross their minds the next time they fly, says Dr. E. 
Gerald Dabbs, a child psychiatrist and associate professor of psychiatry at 
Cornell University Medical College in Ithaca, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
"While it's far away and unrelated, it's difficult to not personalize it, and 
certainly children are quick to do that, sometimes even more so than adults." 
</P>
<P>
Dabbs says he would be concerned about a child who would say that he or she is 
not frightened even when the child was involved in an event such as the threat 
against the Brooklyn schoolchildren. A child who expresses such a sentiment is 
implying that adults have given him or her the message that it is an 
unacceptable topic of discussion, Dabbs says. 
</P>
<P>
Parents need to be frank about any discomfort they have talking about such 
incidents, he says, but they must remain open to talking about them if they are 
to help their children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Elicit Anxieties' 
</P>
<P>
Give the child an invitation to talk about frightening matters, but do so in a 
gentle, neutral way. "You want to elicit anxieties from children rather than 
putting things in," Futterman says. "To raise the subject is OK; to hammer it 
is not." 
</P>
<P>
"What's really important is not so much to talk about the event that took place 
as to begin to talk about what feelings they're having," says Dolores Guarini, 
director of social work services in the child and adolescent division at the 
Institute of Living in Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
Parents may be surprised to learn how their children perceive an unfortunate 
events, be they violent or accidental injuries or death. For example, says Dr. 
Lisa McCann, a clinical psychologist, a child may think that children who are 
victims of violence may have done something bad. The role for the parent is to 
clear up any misconceptions, to give a realistic picture of the situation, and 
also to describe the ways in which adults try to make sure children are safe. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be very careful about not making false promises," Guarini says. "It's 
very important to establish trust." 
</P>
<P>
A child has reason to question a parent who says, "It won't ever happen to 
you," Dabbs says.

POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: KOTTKE FINDS A VOICE AGAIN AFTER 8 YEARS OF PURE PICKIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Boehm 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leo Kottke has spent most of the 1980s making records with his fingers, just as 
he did in the late 1960s and early '70s, when he established himself as an 
acoustic guitar virtuoso. 
</P>
<P>
But with his strong new album, "My Father's Face," Kottke -- who shares a bill 
with Lyle Lovett tonight at the Celebrity Theatre -- is back to singing again 
on four of the album's 11 songs -- his first vocal recordings in 8 years. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast with the original, idiosyncratic style and exceptional rhythmic 
drive he has brought to his best guitar recordings, Kottke's gruff-voiced 
singing has always sounded a little creaky. But the new album's vocal numbers 
are all first rate. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Kottke said in a recent phone interview, using lyrics and vocals 
enabled him to put into music philosophical notions that had been circling 
around in his head for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
It all comes out in "Jack Gets Up," an offbeat song that starts as a litany of 
complaints about the boredom of daily living but winds up an oddly moving 
anthem to the meaningfulness of everyday things. 
</P>
<P>
"It touches me," Kottke said of the song. "It just came out of a mood I've 
sustained the last few years. If I even attempt to describe it, it would be 
nothing but maudlin. What I like about the song is that I managed to convey the 
sense of it without being maudlin. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole album has a lot of this feeling for me that I've kind of missed for 
the last few records. It didn't concentrate on the production or the chops, but 
the feelings involved." 
</P>
<P>
On "Jack Gets Up," rather than make high-blown pronouncements about his 
feelings, Kottke simply introduces us to a fellow who gets out of bed in a 
bearish mood and strings jumbled thoughts together in a grumbling 
stream-of-consciousness as he prepares to face another day. The ordinary 
details embedded in this crotchety anthem make it an affirmation of life in all 
its irksome, roll-out-of-bed-too-early dailiness. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (being) down to earth is finally how you put up with the shock of 
seeing the curve, the big view" of life, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now 43, Kottke said his thinking has begun running toward the big view in the 
last few years: "You see the value of the immediate -- things like lint (which 
Jack finds in his pockets) or how your kid's face looks" (according to the 
song, "like a walnut from the ice cream," a description that Kottke said 
reflects how his son, Joe, now 18, appeared to him as a small boy). 
</P>
<P>
Kottke said he tried to address the ideas that come out in "Jack Gets Up" in a 
1986 instrumental piece, "Ice Fields" but found that singing made it more 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it has as much to do with just hearing a human voice as the actual 
words that make it work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even when he was devoting his albums exclusively to instrumental music, Kottke 
always sang a few tunes in concert. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm in my register, I'm real happy about my voice," the Minnesota resident 
said in a deep, grainy speaking voice. "It took me a while to realize who I was 
vocally. I can't just open my mouth and holler. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I figured that out, I began to find a place for myself. I'm confident 
with it, but I'm not sure I have the kind of individuality when I sing that I 
have when I play the guitar. I'm really drawn to the guitar. The guitar is 
something I can't imagine being without. Music is secondary." 
</P>
<P>
Kottke said he is struck by something that a friend who had studied in Spain 
told him: In Spanish classical guitar circles, there are separate words for a 
guitarist devoted strictly to a love affair with the instrument (a guitarrero), 
and one who brings more perspective to the matter, seeing the guitar as a tool 
to make music, rather than as an end in itself (a guitarrista). 
</P>
<P>
While the Spanish classicists save their esteem for the guitarristas, Kottke 
confessed to being a confirmed guitarrero. 
</P>
<P>
In the view of those classicists, Kottke said: "There's something irresponsible 
about pigging out on the guitar, paying attention only to that and not to the 
broader field that it's a part of. They want a complete and sober musician, as 
opposed to this addict." 
</P>
<P>
Addict or not, Kottke's concerts are not one-dimensional showcases that would 
appeal only to guitar lovers. Besides nimble hands and a serviceable voice, he 
brings to bear a dry, offbeat sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
"It started one night when I was playing in Minneapolis in about 1967," Kottke 
said, recalling how he learned the value of a joke. "I had been playing for a 
number of years and not saying one word. I couldn't look up. But I found myself 
struggling with a gooseneck on the microphone stand, and it reminded me of the 
time I tried to kill a chicken and failed. I couldn't bring myself to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Kottke started talking about that childhood experience with the chicken, and 
his audience began to laugh. "I realized how much I enjoyed it, and I couldn't 
help but notice how much the audience enjoyed it." 
</P>
<P>
He has pursued a humorist's approach to performing ever since. "On the other 
hand," he said, "a waitress in Santa Cruz the other night told me I talked too 
much." 
</P>
<P>
Kottke is winding up a 3-month tour with Lovett, one of the hottest and most 
critically heralded performers in country music. The two became friends and 
mutual admirers several years ago after they shared a bill in Texas. Now they 
share the same management company and booking agency, which Kottke said made a 
joint tour "almost inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
Kottke said it has been interesting to watch the buzz build around Lovett. As 
for himself, while he said the wry vocal numbers on "My Father's Face" have a 
chance to win him his first substantial radio airplay in quite some time, he is 
content to keep his career on an even keel as a solo performer. 
</P>
<P>
(Among the album's assets are detailed but unobtrusive production by T-Bone 
Burnett and a star supporting band that includes David Hidalgo of Los Lobos on 
accordion and second guitar.) 
</P>
<P>
"I've had more than I can handle of mobs and notoriety," Kottke said. "I had a 
riot in Milan, Italy. It was about 1978, when there was a real wave of interest 
in the acoustic guitar throughout Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"I took great advantage of that. In Milan, there were 4,000 people in the 
theater, and another 2,000 who couldn't get in and decided they would get in 
anyhow. There were four doors caved in, traffic was stopped, people got into 
fights and there were broken windows down the street. I was hiding in a trailer 
behind the theater. It was very flattering. 
</P>
<P>
"I still play Italy, but I don't have riots anymore."

SCOTTISH ROCKER MIDGE URE POSES SOME BIG QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For someone who named his latest album "Answers to Nothing," a title oozing 
skepticism, Scottish rocker Midge Ure certainly sounds interested in finding 
answers to some big questions. 
</P>
<P>
"Dear God," the song that has helped Ure gain his first foothold with American 
audiences, asks the biggest question of them all: "Dear God, is there somebody 
out there? Is there someone to hear my prayer?" 
</P>
<P>
Hoping against hope, Ure (pronounced "your") turns the song into a grand-scale 
pop prayer for world peace and plenty. 
</P>
<P>
During the first half of the 1980s, when he fronted the British techno-pop 
band, Ultravox, Ure didn't dwell much on the fate-of-the-world questions that 
crop up often on "Answers to Nothing." The band traded in a lush, ballroom 
romanticism built on swirling layers of synthesizers and Ure's atmospheric 
guitar playing. 
</P>
<P>
On his own, Ure has gone for a less symphonic sound and a lyrical approach full 
of troubled reflection on global realities rather than romantic escapes. 
</P>
<P>
Ure jumped into reality-in-music late in 1984, when Bob Geldof drafted him to 
help write "Do They Know It's Christmas?" the theme song for Band Aid, the 
British rock community's project to raise money for Ethiopian famine relief. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's any doubt about it" that involvement in Band Aid changed 
his perspective in a way that has made his music more socially concerned, Ure 
said recently over the phone from a tour stop in San Francisco. "Pre-Band Aid 
and Live Aid (which he also helped organize), I wasn't overly conscious of what 
was going on around me." 
</P>
<P>
Also, Ure said, "my personal life changed quite drastically over the past 4 or 
5 years. You tend to be single-minded being a single guy." Now married and the 
father of a 2-year-old girl, "I have a lot more responsibility that I never had 
before. You start looking at the world around you. It's quite frightening. With 
the bond (of fatherhood) comes an awful lot of worry." 
</P>
<P>
And, apparently, an urge to pray -- as Ure does on "Dear God," even if he is a 
confirmed skeptic about religion. 
</P>
<P>
"I have that cynical edge when it comes to religion," stemming from his 
experience with sectarian intolerance while growing up in Glasgow. "I was 
brought up believing Catholics have it totally wrong and Protestants had it 
right. I was almost dragged into fights because of it," Ure said. "What I can 
see (of) what man has done to religion is pain and anguish." 
</P>
<P>
The title song of "Answers to Nothing" knocks preachers and politicians for 
selling phony answers to a gullible public. The same, Ure acknowledges, could 
also be said for what a lot of pop musicians are selling. 
</P>
<P>
"Most pop songs don't say anything at all. It's a very lightweight, disposable 
medium. But it can be very effective. There are songs with a real strength 
about them. I heard 'Imagine' on the radio today. It still stands up. 
Somebody's got serious feelings in that." 
</P>
<P>
To Ure, rather than looking to a preacher, a politician or a pop singer, it's 
best to believe -- as John Lennon himself concluded in a song entitled "God" -- 
in oneself. 
</P>
<P>
"It's inner strength. I don't want to sound like a hippie, but you've got to 
believe in yourself, rather than stories written down 2,000 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Ure sounds secure about his standing in the pop biz, even though his success in 
the United States has not been firmly established. While Ultravox had nearly 30 
hit singles in England, it never caught on with a mass American public. And 
while "Dear God" has brought Ure to American listeners' attention, they haven't 
stampeded to buy his album, which so far hasn't been able to advance past No. 
88 on the Billboard chart. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until the last couple of months I'd given America up as a great loss, or 
America had given me up as a loss," Ure said. "If (success in) America happens 
for me, that's a bonus. I'm very well set. I've been lucky enough to be 
immensely successful elsewhere in the world. I have the (ability) to do exactly 
what I like."

DISCOVERY: FROM THE TOP, THE VIEW IS WIDE-ANGLE AND PANORAMIC 
</P>

When the folks at the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel and Tennis Club built a new 
wing and tower onto their hotel 2 1/2 years ago and decided to put a cocktail 
lounge on top, the predictable what-to-name-the-bar question undoubtedly came 
up. 
</P>
<P>
It's nice to think that some local Solomon, after rejecting names such as Rich 
Corinthian Leather Lounge and The Doo Dah Room, stepped forward and said: "Why 
don't we all go up there and just blurt out the first thing that comes to mind, 
and that's what we'll call it." 
</P>
<P>
Surprise! They called it The View. 
</P>
<P>
It may not be the greatest view in Orange County (the best is probably at a 
private home on top of Spyglass Hill a couple of miles away, where the view is 
enhanced by a tile-lined pool, a deck-side vault full of crisp C-notes and a 
butler with a tray full of pina coladas in the foreground), but it's easily in 
the top two. 
</P>
<P>
The overlook is advertised as a 180-degree view of Newport Harbor and the 
surrounding landscape, but the hotel's beverage manager, Steve West, says the 
big windows in the bar wrap around to "at least 220 or 230 degrees." 
</P>
<P>
Thinking of moving out of Orange County and settling in, say, Nova Scotia? Want 
to talk yourself out of it? Simply take the Marriott elevator to the 16th floor 
on a crackling clear day, stroll into the bar and ease into a window-side seat, 
order up and stare. It may be the most potent weapon the county Chamber of 
Commerce has. 
</P>
<P>
"People come in here all the time with people from out of town to give them a 
perspective on Orange County," West said . 
</P>
<P>
In fact, West said, during the week much of the clientele is from out of town, 
mostly guests of the hotel. As the work week wears on, however, more and more 
locals arrive, so that by Friday evening "it's standing room only in here," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the appeal, West said, is what the hotel calls "Hungry Hour," the 
period from 5 to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday when The View offers a 
price-per-item seafood buffet. Among the menu items are half a dozen 
peel-and-eat shrimp or Cajun shrimp ($3.50), half a dozen oysters on the half 
shell ($3) and linguine with scallops ($3). The food is grilled at a small 
table in the center of the room. 
</P>
<P>
There is also live music from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m. Monday and Tuesday and from 9 
p.m. to 1:30 a.m. Wednesday through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
However, West said, the main attraction is on the other side of the window 
glass. Facing the ocean on a clear day and beginning on the far right, the view 
extends from the San Gabriel Mountains south to Los Angeles and Long Beach, 
along the coast to Newport Harbor with Santa Catalina Island beyond, down the 
Irvine coast with Spyglass Hill and Harbor Ridge in the foreground and finally 
ending at Saddleback. Immediately below is Newport Center, Pacific Coast 
Highway and the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, West said, he becomes involved in his work and forgets about the 
sight -- for a good 5 minutes at a time. 
</P>
<P>
"I love working up here," he said. "You have to stop sometimes and remind 
yourself where you are. Then you just stop and look out the windows like 
everyone else." 
</P>
<P>

ANN CONWAY: EXCITEMENT, PRIDE AND HYPE ARE PLENTIFUL AT 'ABUNDANCE' PREMIERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Beth Henley wasn't about to be interviewed by the press before or after the 
world premiere of her play "Abundance" at South Coast Repertory on Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"She's shy, an introvert," a protective SCR director David Emmes explained at 
the post-performance bash staged for SCR supporters in the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
But the words "I'm ecstatic!" were written all over the Pulitzer Prize-winner's 
("Crimes of the Heart") face when she swept into the party in a demure dress to 
participate in photo hype with SCR benefactors. 
</P>
<P>
Emmes probably spoke for both of them when he pronounced the play "powerful" -- 
definitely this night's buzzword. 
</P>
<P>
"We're honored to launch it onto the American scene," he said. "Producers are 
flying in from all over the country to see it." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Emmes said, four other major U.S. theaters had wanted to premiere 
"Abundance." "Five top theaters in this country were sent the play, and all 
five wanted to do it. But we were chosen." 
</P>
<P>
As guests piled their plates with vittles -- hush puppies, homemade potato 
chips and biscuits (a nod to the play's western theme) -- they critiqued the 
production that had kept them spellbound for 2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was powerful," Barbara Bowie said of the tale about two 
mail-order brides and the tough life they face in the Wyoming of 1868. "It was 
terrific! Thought-provoking." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, at the pre-performance bash at the Center Club, guests were buzzing 
about the play's title. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County certainly knows what abundance is all about, said Larry Holt, a 
regional veep with AT&amp;T, the play's honorary producer. "I've only recently 
moved here from New Jersey, and I'm already impressed with Orange County's 
affluence." 
</P>
<P>
For SCR board President Ron Merriman, an example of Orange County's abundance 
was the opportunity it had to premiere Henley's play. "A world premiere in 
Orange County, California. How good can it get?" 
</P>
<P>
Not much better, agreed Jim Coffman, another regional vice president of 
AT&amp;T, host of the party and donor of $15,000 to help underwrite the play. 
"This is AT&amp;T's fourth consecutive year for underwriting a new work at SCR. 
And as long as we can keep our relationship strong, keep our foundation in New 
York involved and excited about what's going on here, we'll be able to 
continue. Let's just say it was very helpful that SCR won a Tony Award last 
year for best regional theater in the country. That helped a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Out to Lunch: "I felt like I was in the middle of a Doris Day movie!" That's 
what one fashionable guest said as she trotted out of the Irvine Hilton on 
Friday after attending "Spring in the Park." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. The benefit, sponsored by the Sophisticates support group of the 
Assessment and Treatment Services Center, did seem to have all of the glamorous 
trappings of one of Doris Day's '50s films: devilishly handsome men (hawking 
raffle tickets in black-tie and tennies), stunningly dressed women (blond 
chairwoman Maria Deremiah, for example, sported a boxy, white crepe ensemble by 
Anne Klein and pearly ropes a la Chanel), and pretty-as-a-picture food -- 
salmon trickled with pesto sauce plus a dessert for which even Doris might have 
traded her wasp-size waist (mocha ice cream bombe presented in a swirl of 
caramel sauce). 
</P>
<P>
And more: a Nordstrom-style show that began with a lineup of breathtakingingly 
chic mannequins, all artfully posed on a Ziegfeld-esque stairway. On parade 
were fashions fit for the ladies who lunch and dine (often back to back): day 
into evening black and whites -- the color combo for spring -- by Victor Costa, 
A.J. Bari and Nolan Miller; elegant blacks paired with triple-hot salmons and 
mustards by Donna Karan and Claude Montana, and pricey combos -- dubbed "metro 
sizzle" in the program -- by Gianfranco Ferre (one sexy, red wool wrap dress 
brought the SRO house down). 
</P>
<P>
On the scene: Todd Nicholson, vice president of ATSC, a juvenile counseling 
program with the motto "Arrest the problem, not the child"; Martha Green, 
president of the Sophisticates; Beverly Salata; Mary Sabatasso; Darlene 
Drummond, and Nancy Weisbrod, Sophisticates treasurer, who, during lunch, gave 
her explanation for what makes a Sophisticate truly a sophisticate: "She's a 
woman with the wherewithal to sit home and eat bonbons, but she doesn't. She 
helps others." Proceeds were estimated at $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
Luncheon of Champions: The bold and unique fashions of D. N. Evans of Laguna 
Beach were on parade last Thursday at the Irvine Hilton. Proceeds of about 
$20,000 will go to Chariot Champions, a support group for the National 
Foundation of Wheelchair Tennis. The foundation supports the annual Junior 
Wheelchair Sports Camp program. Jennifer Yelland was chairwoman. Actress Rhonda 
Fleming (looking drop-dead gorgeous), a part-time resident of Laguna Beach, was 
honorary chairwoman.

CASA TERESA SUPPORTERS GO WESTERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
It ain't broke, so they don't fix it. 
</P>
<P>
As they have for the past three years, the Guilds of Casa Teresa rustled up 
some 300 supporters at $75 a pop for a Western-themed fund-raiser Saturday in 
South Coast Plaza's Jewel Court. 
</P>
<P>
This year's "Casino de Casa" benefit netted an estimated $30,000 for the 
privately funded Orange facility, which provides temporary shelter and 
counseling for pregnant single women between the ages of 18 and 25. Casa Teresa 
can accommodate 20 young women at a time, according to program coordinator 
Sister Ellen, and is "always full, always has a waiting list," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Guests arrived at the shopping mall dressed in jeans and Stetsons, skirts and 
boots, bandannas and big-buckled belts. 
</P>
<P>
After checking in beside a stand of giant cacti, they moseyed along a line of 
silent auction tables, noshing spicy beef empanitas, barbecued 
chicken-on-a-stick and corn muffins stuffed with smoked turkey. Cowpokes never 
had it so good. 
</P>
<P>
Then it was down the escalator (ride 'em!) to the gaming tables, the bandstand 
and much-ignored dance floor, and buffet tables loaded with Southwesternish 
standards (taco fixings, chiles rellenos, baby back ribs) and innovations 
(tequila lime-cured gravad lax of salmon, for instance). 
</P>
<P>
Among the first and the evening's few dancers were Ken and Dianne Schautschick 
of Fountain Valley, in-laws of event chairwoman Merrill Plou. 
</P>
<P>
Also seen Texas two-stepping were Lynne and Peter Tremble, who accessorized 
their duds with playing cards tucked into their belts and pockets and hatbands. 
Peter also sported dice cuff links and dress studs, a shark's tooth dangling on 
his gold watch chain and an ace in his vest pocket. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Hand bellied up to a blackjack table with a .357 Magnum holstered on his 
hip "for quick draw," he said, setting his (cartridge-less) weapon on the table 
by his cards. 
</P>
<P>
Where another man might wear a gun, Rich Goodman sported a red bandanna. "I got 
shot in the leg coming in," he said, joking about the kerchief tied around his 
thigh. 
</P>
<P>
Goodman, president of the Orange County chapter of the American Jewish 
Committee, called himself "pro-choice" in matters of childbirth and abortion. 
But he said he supports the mission of Casa Teresa to assist young, often 
homeless mothers who have chosen to carry their babies to term. 
</P>
<P>
"As a pro-choice person, I believe that one of the choices should be having 
children," he said.

DON NELSON HAD WARRIORS ROLLING UNTIL RECENT SLIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
On Otis, on Winston, on Donner and Blitzen! 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-5 guy with the cowlick spilling Huck Finn-like over his reddening 
face bounces off his seat on the visitors' bench in the Sports Arena, yells a 
last critique at a referee . . . and is forthwith dismissed for the rest of the 
night. He pads off in sport coat, tie, slacks, tennis shoes -- don't tell Huck 
how to dress, the league tried and he just taped over the designer stripes on 
his sneakers -- and ignominy. 
</P>
<P>
Ask Don Nelson, being prescient most of the time is no guarantee of earthly 
reward, none at all. 
</P>
<P>
It's comeuppance time in the real world and the coach of the Golden State 
Warriors watches his miracle trickle into the sands. He is in the process of 
accomplishing the National Basketball Assn.'s fourth-greatest turnaround in 
history with this band of geeks, but they've just hit the wall. They will end 
the season with six consecutive losses and a prettier crew from Phoenix will 
pass them to post the third-best turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
This, in turn, is almost certain to make the longtime itinerant, Cotton 
Fitzsimmons, coach of the year, since the writers are tired of giving it to 
Nellie every other season, and have begun, instead, looking for holes in his 
game . . . and finding them? 
</P>
<P>
The holes aren't where you can see them right off, because what Nelson has just 
done is amazing. His rotation includes Winston Garland, Otis Smith, Rod Higgins 
and Terry Teagle, who have been waived six times among them. He started a 6-8 
center and no one else over 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
In reserve, he kept his Thin Towers -- Manute Bol, who weighs about two ounces 
per foot and is useless on offense inside the three-point line, and Ralph 
Sampson, who is either hurting, has retired without telling anyone, or is 
trying to get himself traded. 
</P>
<P>
Wasn't it just last year that everyone was saying that the day of the 6-foot 
point guard was over, and if your front line didn't have a 7-foot center, and a 
power forward who went 6-10 and 250, you were sissies? 
</P>
<P>
All of a sudden, the Warriors were throwing this horde of dwarfs out there and 
opposing coaches were benching their own big guys so they could "go small to 
match Nellie." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone can go small. 
</P>
<P>
No one really matches Nellie. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody says I'm so brilliant and everything else," Nelson says. "Actually, 
our lineup is due to injury, not to any imagination that I had or any 
intelligence that I had. 
</P>
<P>
"When Ralph went down with an injury (Sampson underwent arthroscopic knee 
surgery in December), there was only one thing to do -- go with a small lineup 
and change our philosophy. And that's what we did." 
</P>
<P>
What does this man know that no one else does? When he acquired the Thin 
Towers, who by then were thought to add up to 15 feet of bad attitude and 
developmental problems, he was thought to be overdue for commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Now, everyone notices the mayhem that Bol causes in his brief appearances. On 
this night, Benoit Benjamin the 7-foot Clipper center whose right leg probably 
outweighs Bol, puts a move on him in their first encounter and fires a fadeaway 
jump shot while seemingly in violent retreat toward an exit. Many more 
fadeaways follow. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the mayhem cuts both ways. Manute throws one outlet pass the length 
of the court -- on a fly -- and out of bounds, into the row of photographers 
behind the court. He misses a three-point shot on an important possession. 
</P>
<P>
If Sampson's stints aren't as impressive, well, let's wait to see what happens 
next season when he's had a summer to build up the knee. 
</P>
<P>
After all, this is Nellie we're talking about. He may look like a country 
bumpkin and talk like he just rode in on a turnip truck, but Nellie's no fool. 
</P>
<P>
In Boston, where he built a long -- not to mention longshot -- career after 
being waived by the Lakers and Chicago Zephyrs, Nelson is remembered for 
scoring 10,000 points off the bench; for leading the league in field goal 
percentage at age 35, even though the only layups he ever got were on fast 
breaks or when the opposing center took a nap; for his 
hit-the-back-of-the-iron, bounce-up, fall-through jump shot against the Lakers 
in that famous Game 7 in 1969; for other moments too numerous to mention. 
</P>
<P>
He was the stickum champion of the league. He already had big hands, but when 
he up-faked some high-jumper, he wanted to know he had control of the ball. He 
even used to let some of the kids block his first shot now and then, so they'd 
get the idea they owned him, and would take the fakes the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Stickum was illegal but who could catch him? He was a veterans' vet. He knew 
shortcuts to places the rest of the world hadn't heard of. Today, his No. 19 
flies above Boton Garden with all the rest, and he earned his place. 
</P>
<P>
When his playing days were ending, he decided to stay on . . . as a referee, 
and actually attended an officials' camp that summer. 
</P>
<P>
Fate hauled him back. Instead, he landed an assistant coach's job at Milwaukee 
under Larry Costello. Seventeen games into his apprenticeship, the Bucks were 
3-14 and Costello was gone. Nelson was a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
The Bucks had recently traded Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and were ostensibly headed 
south. In his third full season, Nelson went 49-33, and in the seven that 
followed never won fewer than 50. 
</P>
<P>
"Nellie did a lot of innovative things and made them work," says Junior 
Bridgeman, who was one of Nelson's first 6-5 swing men. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a lot of a lot of things that weren't the norm in the league. People 
will say, 'Well, you can't win consistently like that,' but for the talent we 
had, and the size we had, I don't think you could have gotten any more out of a 
team. What he did was just being on the cutting edge, basically." 
</P>
<P>
On the cutting edge of what? 
</P>
<P>
Defense, mostly, Bridgeman says. 
</P>
<P>
In the '70s, teams without dominating offensive centers had begun to compensate 
by pulling them out onto the floor and "posting up" smaller players with good 
one-on-one skills. The defenses usually didn't compensate, so World Free and 
Sidney Moncrief, both guards with great jumping ability, pounded their 
defenders into the floor in the low post. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, double-teaming anyone was controversial. In the 1974 finals, the 
lordly Celtics, who had never deigned to double Wilt Chamberlain or anyone 
else, steadfastly played Abdul-Jabbar with one man -- the 6-9 Dave Cowens -- 
and watched Kareem destroy him for six games. 
</P>
<P>
After Abdul-Jabbar won Game 6 in Boston with a sweeping hook from the baseline, 
sending the series back to Milwaukee, there was a famous bull session with 
Coach Tommy Heinsohn and announcer Bob Cousy that turned into the decision to 
double-team, at last. In Milwaukee, the Celtics swarmed over Abdul-Jabbar, the 
Buck forwards missed their jump shots and the Celtics prevailed easily. 
</P>
<P>
As much as anyone, it was Nelson who came up with an answer to all the posting 
up, which was to double-team not only centers, but anyone in the pivot with the 
ball. This forced opponents to throw the ball out and settle for a jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
This has become standard practice in the NBA. They pound the ball inside. You 
double down. They throw it out. You pursue. If they hit the outside shot, 
congratulations to them. The percentages are better if you're giving up 
20-footers than two-footers. 
</P>
<P>
"I was probably one of the people who started it," Nelson says. "I found you 
can't be afraid to leave some openings. You can take some things away and that 
leaves other openings. 
</P>
<P>
"But the offense has to find 'em. Where a Larry Bird or Magic Johnson can find 
'em every time, there ain't that many Birds and Magics around. The other guy, 
he doesn't find 'em, or he sees 'em late. By the time he sees 'em, they're 
covered. 
</P>
<P>
"Go ahead and make people make decisions. Don't let a coach just come down and 
go to his players' strengths. Make those other players, who he's trying to stay 
away from, or make rebounders of, or beat you up on the weak side with, let 
them come out and play." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson's idea of the game is focused on those decisions. It was an insight he 
developed in Boston, where the Celtics institutionalized team play and 
unselfishness as precursors to winning, which in turn became the only tolerable 
outcome. Nelson was perfect for them. He played that way all along, since he 
possessed no physical attributes, such as running and jumping ability, to make 
it any other way. 
</P>
<P>
At Iowa, he was a 6-5 center. As a Celtic, he was the consummate role player. 
As a coach, he would invariably praise the players doing the little things and 
the dirty work -- setting screens, blocking out, rebounding, moving without the 
ball. Bridgeman says Nelson would give out 10 compliments for those things, 
before he'd say anything about a guy scoring 30 points. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson says: "Once you played with players who really saw the game, who were 
able to pass and cut and do just basic basketball things to perfection, and you 
ever got in a game with those kind of players, way back in college or in the 
summers every now and then in a pickup game, when all of a sudden three-four 
guys would be able to really play, and the feeling that you had playing, just 
cuttin' and screenin' and rolling early and shooting and getting people caught 
in between, it's just so much fun. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't rely on set plays to carry you. They always break down and you never 
run 'em to perfection. You always end up in a decision-making posture. And the 
more players you have who make those good decisions, the easier the game is. 
You put Bird or Magic in any set in any style and everything works to 
perfection. You put Larry Bird out with an injury and run the same things with 
other people, they don't run so well. 
</P>
<P>
"The secret is to find guys, maybe not with their talent, but who know how to 
play basketball. Find 'em and teach 'em. And everything runs a lot easier." 
</P>
<P>
In Milwaukee, Nelson found them, taught them, took what they had to give . . . 
and learned how to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
He started the "point forward," making a playmaker of small forward Paul 
Pressey, so he could play two shooting guards -- 6-3 Moncrief and 6-5 Ricky 
Pierce. If someone bigger posted up Pressey, who was wiry and pretty good at 
taking care of himself in the pivot, Nelson made sure help was forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
Since he didn't have one outstanding big man, he used a "three-headed center," 
getting a little bit out of Alton Lister (shot-blocker, rebounder, if also the 
Human Personal Foul), Randy Breuer (low-post player) and Paul Mokeski (bulky, 
outside shooter). 
</P>
<P>
It ended abruptly in Milwaukee, in the spring of 1986. Nelson's old sponsor, 
Jim Fitzgerald, sold the team to a new owner, Herb Kohl, a local supermarket 
magnate and now a U.S. senator. With the team in gentle decline, Kohl started 
jerking Nellie's reins for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, unhappy, went so far as to exclaim, during an emotional playoff series 
with the Celtics, "I am the Milwaukee Bucks!" 
</P>
<P>
He was greatly embarrassed by it, and tried to explain it away, even if there 
was more than a measure of truth in it. By this time, he was more than just the 
Milwaukee Bucks, After founding "Nellie's Farm Fund" and touring the state on a 
tractor, he was wildly popular. 
</P>
<P>
He fell dramatically. The Bucks fell behind in the Celtic series, 3-1, rallied 
to force a seventh game in Boston Garden, led all the way into the middle of 
the fourth quarter, by 110-103 with 5 minutes 14 seconds left . . . but lost. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson resigned, and joined the Warrior front office, where Fitzgerald had just 
bought in. He is sanguine enough about the blowup. 
</P>
<P>
Says Nelson: "I was probably spoiled." 
</P>
<P>
His days on the bench were supposed to be over. The coach was the young and 
promising George Karl, whom Nelson recommended years before. Karl guided the 
team into the playoffs, and even won a game from the Lakers, who went 12-3 in 
the '87 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
But the Warriors buckled. Karl, nervous about the constant speculation that 
Nelson was about to take over, asked for a vote of confidence and resigned when 
he couldn't get it. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson was forced to return. He says he asked four men to take the job, but all 
turned it down, so he was forced to stay. 
</P>
<P>
But what was he going to do with this team? They'd torn it apart the season 
before, in the trade for Sampson. He had some nice mid-sized players, including 
a kind of poor man's Bird in Chris Mullin, who was returning to form after 
undergoing rehabilitation for alcohol dependency. He traded up to draft another 
6-5, inside-outside guy, Mitch Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
In training camp, Nelson decided to go to a constant motion offense. It was put 
in as much by fired San Antonio Coach Bob Weiss, as by Nelson, but what the 
heck? 
</P>
<P>
"He was supposed to be learning from me and I ended up learning from him," 
Nelson says. "Which is the way I usually do it." 
</P>
<P>
It turned out, he was going to need a lot of motion. When Sampson went down, 
Nelson built an offense around opening up the floor for his two stars, Mullin 
and Richmond. For relief, comic and otherwise, Bol came in as the back line in 
a press and batted down shots. It worked, spectacularly. 
</P>
<P>
"I never, ever in my whole career, including when I played, ever feared big vs. 
small," Nelson says. "Unless there was a big talent differential. Size has 
never bothered me that much, and especially if you have good team defensive 
techniques and philosophies. 
</P>
<P>
"I played centers in my career. I had the largest rebounding night -- 20 
rebounds -- when I played against Chamberlain. Someone was ill, or (Bill) 
Russell missed a game, so I had to play against him, and I couldn't believe the 
open shots I got. It was like shooting H-O-R-S-E. Big guys are afraid you're 
going to drive on them and they give you open shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I always had strange ideas. I still do, probably. Some of 'em work, some of 
'em don't work. I came up with the bank pass. We were going to bank the ball 
against the backboards and get it. It made so much sense, because of the size 
of our big players, Manute and Ralph. We worked on it most of training camp and 
basically had to junk it because we couldn't even hit the board. If we just had 
hit the backboard, it would have been all right, but we were throwing it over, 
under . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Although he's accused of having developed a large ego, Nelson brings up his 
failures without being asked and gives credit for the things he borrowed. He is 
a writers' favorite, although he doesn't particularly put on a happy face and 
play to the press. He'll be short at times, but he has great credibility. He is 
considered one of the league's kingmakers, whose recommendation can make a 
career. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, coaches generally develop large egos if they don't already come 
equipped with them, which is appropriate for men who think it only right and 
natural that they make a living telling other men what to do. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson won't necessarily argue. 
</P>
<P>
"If ego means that I want credit given to me, that's not me," he says. "If ego 
means that I want to see my name and my picture in the paper, that's not me, 
'cause that does not matter to me. 
</P>
<P>
"If ego means that it must be done my way, then I've got a big ego. Because 
basketball-wise, it's got to be done my way. There can't be two ways to do it. 
I think I have a secret of success within a franchise. I think I can make it a 
winner. I have the ability, maybe because of my background and who I played 
for, to get in an organization and say, 'If you want to be a winner, this is 
what you have to do.' And if they do it, you can win. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe I'm good at that. If that's ego, then I've got that." 
</P>
<P>
That's ego, but who's complaining? His players like him and always have. The 
first thing Bridgeman remembers is that Nelson combined the knack of being able 
to rage at people with being able to keep it friendly. 
</P>
<P>
It's Nelson's second time around. He's now well off, courtesy of investments 
set up by Fitzgerald. He has nothing much left to prove, but the fire still 
burns within him. 
</P>
<P>
It's a slow morning, a week before the end of the season, the day of a Clipper 
game in Los Angeles. Nelson is seated at a table in the concierge lounge of one 
of the airport hotels. He says that although his mother may like this story, 
he'd rather be watching film than getting interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Bridgeman says no one can ever know how hard Nelson worked, and that was before 
the videotape days when every second of every game was available to coaches, if 
they could just get some rookie to lug around enough portable equipment. Now 
they can study those Clipper back screens all day. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's not fun at this moment, but I'll look back on this year as probably 
the best I've ever had," Nelson says. "I will. I can't right now. 
</P>
<P>
"All the coaches at this time are tired and stressed out. That's part of the 
territory. These are the dog days. (Looking downward) I'm putting on weight 
again." 
</P>
<P>
As if to prove his own point, he gets ejected that night. The Warriors fall in 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Downcast, Nelson makes a perfunctory statement to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
What the heck, for the prescient as well as the pedestrian, it's a living.

LIVING WITH THE REAL GORBACHEV; 
</P>
<P>
HARD AS IT IS TO DIVINE HIS MOTIVES, WE STILL MUST RESPOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT E. HUNTER, Robert E. Hunter is vice president for regional programs 
and director of European studies at the Center for Strategic and International 
Studies in Washington.

"Will the real Mikhail S. Gorbachev please stand up?" 
</P>
<P>
Many Americans are asking that question, especially after the Soviet 
president's latest round of jet-set diplomacy followed by his assertion of 
domestic authority by cleaning out more aging "dead souls" from the Communist 
Party's Central Committee. The question is important, because it could 
determine whether the United States proves able to compete with the phenomenal 
leader in the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
Item: In Cuba, Gorbachev publicly opposed the export of revolution -- a pointed 
lesson for his host, Fidel Castro. But he also opposed the export of 
counterrevolution. This was a reference to the so-called Reagan Doctrine, under 
which the United States has supported the fight against pro-Soviet governments 
in Nicaragua, Afghanistan, Angola and Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
Item: Gorbachev said that he would not introduce nuclear weapons into the 
Western Hemisphere. But he also linked the reduction of other Soviet activities 
to a halt in U.S. meddling elsewhere, especially in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
Item: In London, Gorbachev reiterated his European peace plan, which bedazzled 
many Western observers when he unveiled it last December at the United Nations. 
But he then hinted at disrupting East-West conventional force talks if the 
countries in the Atlantic Alliance modernize short-range nuclear weapons. The 
Soviet leader knew that he was stirring the Western pot because his hostess, 
Margaret Thatcher, supports modernization and the West German government can't 
touch it, politically. 
</P>
<P>
Item: Gorbachev has been bidding to join Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. He 
pushed Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, to 
recognize Israel, and he has proposed to cooperate with the West in countering 
terrorism. But U.S. Defense Department sources say that the Soviets sold some 
advanced SU-24 fighter-bombers to Libya that, by Pentagon account, could reach 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
So which is the real Mikhail Gorbachev? Clearly, he is all of the above. And 
just as clearly, the West must learn to live with this fact. 
</P>
<P>
Making sense of Gorbachev is especially difficult in the United States. For the 
past 40 years, attitudes toward the Soviet Union have swung wildly. First, 
there was the Cold War, when nothing seemed possible in U.S.-Soviet relations. 
Then, in the 1970s, came detente and euphoric expectations that were dashed 
when Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan. Remarkably, Ronald Reagan hung onto the 
pendulum as it again swung from the "evil empire" to "my friend Mikhail." 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the risk lies in expecting too much from the Soviet president. 
It is easy to see on television the rough and tumble of an unprecedented Soviet 
election and mistake it for Western democracy. It is tempting to witness a 
drastic reduction in Cold War tensions and believe it also means the end of 
significant East-West competition. 
</P>
<P>
The dilemma is that the Gorbachev era could permit the most radical 
restructuring of East-West relations -- the best chance for reducing the 
military burden of confrontation -- in 40 years. But at the same time, the 
Soviet Union is no more willing and able to abandon all pursuit of power than 
it is to repeal the law of gravity. 
</P>
<P>
This Manichaean dilemma is illustrated by Western efforts to divine the Soviet 
leader's motives. 
</P>
<P>
Yet given the expectations that Gorbachev has raised about fundamental change 
in East-West relations, Western leaders cannot wait until one or another motive 
is proved. Inordinate delay poses twin risks -- the erosion of popular support 
for still-needed military security or the missing of an opportunity that, if 
now lost, might not return again soon. 
</P>
<P>
As the West's leader, the United States is particularly hard pressed. At home, 
George Bush is the first President who cannot escape the need to explain to the 
American people the dual nature of U.S.-Soviet relations: cooperation and 
competition, feast one day and famine the next. He must find a way to dampen 
the swinging pendulum of public opinion in order to craft sensible and 
sustainable policies toward Gorbachev's Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration faces an equal task abroad. The European allies are becoming 
impatient that the Western champion has yet to take the field against the 
challenger from the East. In London, Gorbachev taunted the United States for 
its delay. 
</P>
<P>
Time, however, has not yet run out. There is merit in the Administration's 
careful strategic review of a world in flux. And for all his diplomatic cheek, 
Gorbachev is playing a hand much weaker than that held by the American 
President. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, when the U.S. review is done, the President must have something 
to show for it. No later than next month's NATO summit, he must present a 
strategy to allies hungry for leadership in uncertain times. This was 
underscored this week by the hasty visit to Washington of West Germany's 
foreign and defense ministers, looking for a U.S. answer to Gorbachev's 
initiatives. Bush must provide a political rationale for preserving Western 
military strength, devise credible tests of Gorbachev's intentions and offer a 
long-term blueprint for a new breed of relations between East and West. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, by starting early and acting boldly, Gorbachev has presented Bush with 
perhaps the greatest task of statesmanship to face a U.S. President in 40 
years.

ACTING AFFIRMATIVELY; 
</P>
<P>
GLENDALE BEGINS TO MOVE TOWARD INTEGRATING THE CITY'S WORK FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jose Manuel Feliciano has always been one to believe that nothing is beyond the 
reach of determined minds, regardless of race or social condition. 
</P>
<P>
The son of a poor Pentecostal minister, Feliciano lived during his childhood 
years in a converted garage in a small town in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
But his humble background, he proudly points out, did not prevent Feliciano, 
39, from getting two college degrees and fulfilling his lifelong dream of 
becoming a public servant. 
</P>
<P>
These days Feliciano is facing the biggest challenge of his life. As 
coordinator of Glendale's newly revamped affirmative action program, his job is 
to persuade other minorities that they can also succeed. 
</P>
<P>
It is by no means an easy task, given Glendale's less than exemplary efforts to 
recruit minorities and its recent history of racial incidents. In the past four 
years, Glendale has lost a major discrimination lawsuit filed by a Latino 
police officer; been home to a white supremacist group; attracted a rally by 
another white supremacist group that ended in a near riot, and seen homes, 
cars, a Jewish temple and a school smeared with racist graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
None of which is surprising to Feliciano, he is quick to point out. After all, 
the city is going through an at-times painful transition from what was once a 
white, conservative community to an ethnically diverse California melting pot. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sad commentary to make," Feliciano said in his small, cluttered City 
Hall office. "But it's going to get worse before it gets better. As immigrants 
continue to come, I predict more incidents of racial tension in the San 
Fernando Valley, including Glendale." 
</P>
<P>
To ease such tensions, the city has launched a major offensive to integrate the 
municipal work force. Critics say that Feliciano's efforts are in the wrong 
direction and that the city is not doing enough to make up for the damage 
created by years of neglect. 
</P>
<P>
But Feliciano will have none of it. Just watch me, he seems to say, his words 
and gestures denoting confidence about the job he began in November. 
</P>
<P>
Feliciano arrived to Glendale in 1977 as a personnel trainee and quietly rose 
through the ranks. Ten years and five promotions later, he became the city's 
personnel services administrator. 
</P>
<P>
A devoted family man and proud father of two, along the way Feliciano became a 
real estate investor and prospered. "Let me tell you," he grinned. "I've made a 
lot more money in real estate than I have in this job this year." 
</P>
<P>
Affirmative action coordinator since 1981, Feliciano acknowledges that he and 
the city did not begin recruiting minorities aggressively until virtually 
forced to in 1986. That year, Carlos Jauregui, a Latino police officer, 
successfully sued his department for discriminatory promotional practices. 
</P>
<P>
What was once a marginal occupation that took up "about 20%" of his office time 
has now become Feliciano's main responsibility -- affirmative action duties 
account for "more than 60%" of Feliciano's workload. 
</P>
<P>
"I see an emphatic, positive change on the commitment of public officials since 
around 1986 toward welcoming a more integrated work force," Feliciano 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, in two years the percentage of minorities in the work force jumped 
from 24.4% in 1986 to 29.2% of the city's 1,419 employees in 1988. It had taken 
the city 11 years before that to raise its minority representation from only 
10%. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, city officials also began hiring consultants, commissioning 
studies, sponsoring ethnic festivals and establishing seminars and workshops to 
increase awareness of cultural, gender and age differences among city 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Starting last month, all new employees are given a two-hour crash course 
conducted by Feliciano on cultural diversity. Posters preaching tolerance and 
praising diversity ordered by Feliciano cover the employee orientation room. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent orientation class, Feliciano addressed a group of seven employees, 
of whom five were minorities. He said the mix is typical of the kind of 
employees the city is hiring. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recruitment Stepped Up 
</P>
<P>
The city has also stepped up its recruitment efforts. In February, the city 
contracted the Los Angeles-based consulting firm of Glenda Madrid and 
Associates to establish specific minority hiring goals based on "relevant 
market" analysis -- a study of the ethnic makeup of the different labor pools 
the city draws on to fill its positions. 
</P>
<P>
Also, last month the Glendale City Council allocated $142,000 to hire a 
minority recruiter and a clerk and to pay for advertisements to attract 
minorities. Feliciano wasted no time in putting the money to use -- last week 
Sandra Houlemard became the city's first full-time minority recruiter. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the changes stem from an independent study of the Glendale police 
hiring and promotional practices ordered by U.S. District Judge Dickran 
Tevrizian in his ruling on the Jauregui case. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-month study was completed last November by the Latino law firm of Ochoa 
and Sillas. It concluded that the Glendale Police Department had disregarded 
its own promotional practices and built a force led by white officers who were 
slow to act on racial complaints. 
</P>
<P>
It also made a number of specific recommendations to improve the entire city's 
hiring and promotional practices and to deal more effectively with future 
harassment complaints. 
</P>
<P>
In a joint public statement, then-City Manager James Rez and Police Chief David 
J. Thompson said they accepted the study's findings and vowed to carry out most 
recommendations immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Herman Sillas, who wrote the report, was retained as an adviser by the 
city to help Feliciano make those changes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Long, Hard Look' 
</P>
<P>
"The Ochoa and Sillas report made us take a long, hard look at ourselves," City 
Manager David Ramsay said. 
</P>
<P>
The Jauregui ruling, however, fell short of imposing minority hiring quotas on 
the city or any of its departments. "Our affirmative action program is 
completely voluntary," Feliciano explained. 
</P>
<P>
The court case, Feliciano said, addressed problems in only one of the city's 
departments and was limited to the Police Department's promotional policies -- 
not hiring problems or work- force harassment. 
</P>
<P>
Doris Woods, enforcement manager of the federal Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission's Los Angeles office, said cities are required only to be equal 
opportunity employers to be eligible for federal contracts. 
</P>
<P>
She said her office handles individual complaints but does not monitor city 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale has had since 1972 an affirmative action policy plan that resembles 
many others throughout the country. In the plan, Glendale says its goal is to 
"place the ethnic composition of the permanent full-time Glendale work force on 
par with the composition of the labor market. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
For years, however, the city did little more than some advertisements in black 
and Latino newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
"Before 1986 we were concentrating on internal processes, like changing the 
classifications of 'policeman' to 'police officer' and 'fireman' to 
'firefighter,' things like that," Feliciano explained. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Lot of Selling' 
</P>
<P>
"To get an affirmative action program going, you have to do a lot of selling, 
changing minds, education, understanding . . . and it takes time." 
</P>
<P>
Results from the Madrid study are expected in July, but Feliciano does not need 
a report to know that the city badly needs more minority employees. "When you 
can't go down any further, the only way is up," Feliciano said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the renewed commitment to affirmative action, city employment has 
fallen far short of reflecting the rapid demographic changes occurring in 
Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
A recent Glendale school board study shows that the number of students whose 
primary language is not English has jumped from 18.4% in 1981 to 59% this year, 
said Alice Petrossian, the school district director of intercultural studies. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is the city anywhere close to reflecting the diverse makeup of its 
immediate labor market -- Los Angeles County. According to data from the 1980 
census, minorities account for 46.9% of the county's work force. And by all 
accounts, the minorities' share of the labor market has increased significantly 
since then. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Glendale Fire Department, which contains the city's 
least-integrated employee roster, is still 94% white and has yet to hire a 
black, an Asian-American or a woman. 
</P>
<P>
And the perception of racial harassment in the work force has yet to disappear. 
Glendale Employees Assn. Vice President Art Sandor said he has received three 
complaints of alleged racial harassment so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Complaints Passed On 
</P>
<P>
He said two of the complaints have been passed on to the city manager, while 
the merits of the most recent complaint are still being evaluated. Ramsay said 
his office is conducting a thorough investigation in both cases, which remain 
confidential to protect the alleged victims. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, critics contend that the city's affirmative action program has not 
prevented whites from retaining a near-monopoly over the city's top jobs. City 
statistics filed with the Federal Equal Employment Agency last year show that 
94.1% of the city's executive-level and 80.6% of the city's management-level 
positions are held by whites. 
</P>
<P>
"The affirmative action movement started in 1965 . . .," said Glendale 
Community College administrator Ray Reyes, a longtime critic of of the city's 
minority hiring policies. "When is Glendale going to find that out? When are 
they going to stop wasting time in studies and seminars and start opening 
choice jobs to minorities?" 
</P>
<P>
Easier said than done, replied Feliciano. And taking shots from people like 
Reyes, he said, does not help the process. It's hard enough, Feliciano said, to 
overcome the negative publicity that has rocked Glendale in the last four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The string of incidents revived unpleasant memories that the city had been 
quietly trying to outlive -- such as being the home to the American Nazi 
Party's Western Region headquarters between 1966 and 1968 and the violence that 
followed the first wave of Latino immigrants in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
If only the press got off the Glendale-bashing bandwagon, Feliciano snapped. 
"But the press continues to alienate people by looking at the past, instead of 
the future, and I resent that," he said. "I happen to think the city is truly 
committed to affirmative action. We are way ahead of what everyone else is 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Called Me a Coconut' 
</P>
<P>
On a recent recruiting trip for the Police Department to East Los Angeles, a 
group of Latino activists Feliciano won't name, "called me a coconut," he said. 
"You know, brown in the outside, white in the inside." 
</P>
<P>
Feliciano said the remark did not anger him as much as he was saddened by the 
lost opportunity. "I felt these people were screening themselves out of the 
competitive process, and I know the process is fair. 
</P>
<P>
"But it takes a long time for people to change their preconceived notions. They 
want to be sure we're for real and not just putting up a front." 
</P>
<P>
Echoing statements made by several top city officials in recent years, 
Feliciano dismissed the city's racial problems as "isolated incidents that do 
not reflect the views of the wide majority of this city's residents." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he said, Feliciano himself is the perfect example of the city's 
commitment to hiring and promoting minorities. 
</P>
<P>
When he came to California, Feliciano said, he applied for work in at least a 
dozen cities and government agencies. Fresh out of college with a master's 
degree in public administration and having done some social work in New York 
state, Los Angeles and Glendale, he soon found out that not too many 
organizations were interested in a relatively inexperienced Puerto Rican who 
could not communicate well in English. "Glendale was the only city that gave me 
a chance," he said. "All the others turned me down." 
</P>
<P>
Whether Feliciano and the city develop enough credibility among minority groups 
to attract quality recruits and see them rise up the ladder remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
After all, as Reyes pointed out, employment records -- not seminars and studies 
-- ultimately determine the success or failure of affirmative action programs. 
</P>
<P>
Let the skeptics talk, Feliciano said, because no matter what they say today, 
"in five years you'll be writing the biggest success story in Glendale's 
history."

MEN'S GROUP AT OCCIDENTAL;

<P>
BONDING FOR THE ENLIGHTENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When a group of college men reserve a room on campus to meet, start talking 
about women and give themselves a three-letter name, that usually means that 
they are starting a new fraternity. 
</P>
<P>
Not this time. 
</P>
<P>
They call themselves Men for Egalitarian Philosophy, or MEP. And they are about 
as far from the fraternity boys of old as it is possible to be. 
</P>
<P>
Men for Egalitarian Philosophy is a group of college seniors trying to do 
something new at Occidental College, a liberal arts school with a conservative 
history: They have formed a group that attempts to understand the new role of 
men against the background of the women's movement. 
</P>
<P>
They speak about such things as "empowerment" and "gender roles" with an 
earnestness usually employed by campus feminists. And among the 1,650 students 
at Occidental, their philosophy is catching on. This week, the group is holding 
a series of evening seminars, dedicated to such issues as men's sexuality, 
stereotyping and father-son relationships, that are drawing crowds of 60 or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Focus 
</P>
<P>
"It's a new type of male bonding," said Scott Figenshow, a senior who is one of 
the group's founding members. "Why does the only kind of male bonding 
recognized in our society have to be one that involves heavy partying and 
putting down women? We want the focus to be on heterosexual men who want to 
talk about something else." 
</P>
<P>
The discussion Monday night was titled "Stale Roles and Tight Buns: Images of 
Men in Advertising." A video of advertisements featuring images such as the 
"Marlboro Man," cologne bottles shaped like phalluses and construction workers 
eyeing women -- or presumably their pantyhose -- drew guffaws and groans. It 
also drew a heated discussion about the stereotypical behavior that MEP says 
men are conditioned to adopt. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is, society keeps staring back into the mirror and it's a 
self-perpetuating thing," Robert Mansour, 20, said. "The question is, how do we 
get away from it?" 
</P>
<P>
Male responses to the women's movement are nothing new, academics say. Since 
the suffragettes marched for the vote and the women activists of the 1960s 
marched for sexual equality, there have been men who marched with them. 
</P>
<P>
But during the late 1970s, feminist activism on college campuses went into 
something of a hibernation, academics say. In recent years, there has been a 
new focus on women's issues at colleges such as Occidental, spawning an 
often-defensive response among men of a younger generation, they say. Today, 
groups organized to discuss men's lives with the introspection normally 
reserved for women are once again new, they say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Positive Sign' 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very positive sign that these men have decided to take responsibility 
for these changes rather than just letting them happen to them," said Karen 
King, a professor of religious studies at Occidental and an adviser to women's 
groups on campus. 
</P>
<P>
The group is not without its detractors. Some feminists at Occidental see MEP 
as an attempt by men to co-opt the language of the women's movement. The 
group's founders angered feminists on campus by suggesting that the women's 
studies program at the college be renamed "Gender Studies." And some women say 
men are being disingenuous when they say they understand women's problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the women students get sort of mad," said Mary Weismantel, a 
professor of anthropology who heads the women's studies program at Occidental. 
"They feel that this has stolen the limelight from them." 
</P>
<P>
But the largest organization of feminists at Occidental, the Feminist 
Consciousness Coalition, supports MEP. The two groups have met together several 
times, and women who have participated in the discussions say the men in MEP 
have learned a great deal about themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"They started out thinking it just takes a couple of men who present themselves 
in a way that says it's OK to be men who care," Sarah Charnes, 22, said. "The 
truth is, they're realizing that it's a lot more then deciding these 
'sensitive' men need a voice. They're realizing they aren't as sensitive as 
they thought." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Committed to Equality 
</P>
<P>
At the start of what a brochure advertises as "Men's Issues Week" Monday night, 
the 15 or so Occidental students who call themselves MEP clustered around a 
podium on stage while one of them recited their manifesto. The document says 
they are committed to equality between the sexes, "and at the same time pledged 
to the consideration of these attitudes as they concern men." 
</P>
<P>
The week of discussion continues tonight with a lecture by Bernie Zilbergeld, 
the author of a book called "Male Sexuality." The lecture will be held in 
Alumni Auditorium at 8 p.m. On Friday in Pipal Lounge, a lunch and discussion 
at noon is devoted to "Father-Son Relationships." 
</P>
<P>
The founders of MEP say they are not out to steal the symbols of the women's 
movement but to broaden its meaning. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of swinging the scope of power from men to women, we're trying to 
swing it back to center," Figenshow said.

REPLACEMENT HOUSING FEE PLAN GAINS IN SANTA MONICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEXANDRA SMITH, Community Correspondent 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Developers in Santa Monica who have been required to replace rental apartments 
they demolish may soon be given the option of paying fees that the city would 
use to build replacement housing. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted 4-2 Tuesday night to prepare an ordinance that would 
establish the fee plan, known as Program 10, which was called for under a 
larger housing plan adopted in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Program 10 was developed in response to a decline in the number of rental units 
in Santa Monica, especially affordable housing, since the mid-1970s. The 942 
rental units built from 1976 to 1986, city records show, were only 63% of the 
number demolished during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, a developer or landlord who removes rental units from a site by 
demolishing or converting them to another use is required to include an 
identical number of units in the new development on the site. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fee for Each Unit Approved 
</P>
<P>
Under Program 10, developers would be allowed to build anything within 
applicable zoning laws and would not have to build replacement units. However, 
they would have to pay a fee to the city for each unit they removed. 
</P>
<P>
The fees for units removed and not replaced would range from $27,000 for an 
efficiency apartment to $63,000 for a four-bedroom apartment. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have said the fees could be paid in a lump sum or over 10 years, 
with the money earmarked for moderate- and low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Christine Reed argued that the council was being inconsistent in 
blaming the housing shortage on developers. Because of an emphasis in recent 
years on lowering density in many areas of the city, she said, the council has 
also contributed to the rental housing shortage. 
</P>
<P>
"We are downzoning; we are saying we want less housing and less people," she 
said. "You have a direct contradiction in policy here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposed by Developers 
</P>
<P>
Although Reed and Councilman William H. Jennings ultimately voted against the 
proposal for that and other reasons, it passed by a two-vote margin. 
(Councilman Herb Katz was absent.) 
</P>
<P>
Opposition at Tuesday's meeting also came from developers and property owners 
who insisted that the plan unfairly penalizes them -- just as they have 
maintained in the past that they are unfairly penalized by the requirement to 
replace rental units. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a practical prohibition on development in general, not a response to (the 
need for) affordable rental housing in the city," said attorney Christopher 
Harding, who represents developers opposed to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, "it is a direct violation of property owners' constitutional 
rights. . . . They're going to be sued on this ordinance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Harding argued that property owners who have pulled out of the rental market 
under the Ellis Act -- a state law passed in 1985 that allows landlords to go 
out of business if they can't turn a fair profit -- should be exempt from 
Program 10. Currently, such property owners are not required to replace the 
rental units they take off the market. 
</P>
<P>
"The key issue is, once you're under the Ellis Act, does the city still have 
jurisdiction over you?" Harding said. 
</P>
<P>
Courts have ruled against Santa Monica in two cases involving the city's 
attempt to override the Ellis Act. 
</P>
<P>
When questioned by council members, City Atty. Robert M. Myers admitted that 
there are "judicial concerns" about Program 10 but argued that it was proposed 
as part of the overall housing plan before the Ellis Act was passed. He urged 
the council to adopt the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Harding also complained that the replacement fees under Program 10 would be 
"extraordinarily high" and were designed simply to discourage people from 
demolishing existing buildings, not as a legitimate response to the housing 
shortage. 
</P>
<P>
However, Assistant City Atty. Laurie Lieberman, who helped devise the plan, 
rejected the idea that the program would penalize developers, saying it would 
provide them with more options. 
</P>
<P>
"There are lots of developers who would prefer to pay a fee rather than be 
forced to construct rental units on the property," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city Rent Control Board and various community organizations have 
argued that the fees are too low and that further subsidies are needed to 
replace lost units. 
</P>
<P>
According to a city staff report, the fund would provide only partial help in 
replacing affordable rental units. 
</P>
<P>
Not only developers spoke against the program Tuesday night. Ed Simonian, an 
engineer who owns a three-unit building on 26th Street, said Program 10 will 
keep him from converting the three 1920s apartments into residences for 
himself, his sister and his mother-in-law. The fees for taking the rental units 
off the market will be prohibitive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is sheer blackmail; it's ransom money," Simonian told the council. "Why 
should I pay for housing for some stranger? You should shoot higher than pick 
on the small property owners of Santa Monica." 
</P>
<P>
The Program 10 fee schedule would require Simonian to pay the city $128,000 to 
convert the property to his own use -- money he said he doesn't have. 
</P>
<P>
The program last came before the City Council in June, 1988, before nearly 10 
months of refinement. The next step will be a preliminary environmental report. 
A formal vote on the ordinance putting Program 10 into effect is probably four 
to six months away, Lieberman said.

<P>
HEARING ON TRAFFIC PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency will hold a public hearing 
Wednesday on proposals to manage traffic in Hollywood and revitalize Hollywood 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Commissioners will hear testimony on drafts of the Hollywood 
Transportation Plan and the Hollywood Boulevard District Urban Design Plan. 
Both proposals are elements of the broader Hollywood Redevelopment Plan, which 
was adopted in 1986 for an 1,100-acre section of central Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The transportation plan will attempt to manage traffic and congestion problems 
over the next 20 years, while the Hollywood Boulevard plan will establish 
development guidelines for that thoroughfare. After they have been reviewed by 
the commissioners, they will be forwarded to the city's Planning Commission and 
the City Council for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing will be held at 9 a.m. in the Redevelopment Agency's fourth-floor 
board room, 354 S. Spring St., Los Angeles. The commissioners will accept 
written testimony until June 1. Comments may be mailed to the agency's 
Hollywood Project Office, 6255 Sunset Blvd., Suite 711, Hollywood, Calif. 
90028.

AROUND THE FOOTHILLS: AS A FAMILY BUSINESS, SPORT CHALET SEEMED TO GROW WITHOUT 
PLAN . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A great American success story turned 30 last week in La Canada Flintridge. 
</P>
<P>
It's the story of a German immigrant couple of the late 1950s who settled in a 
rural suburb beside the mountains. They went into business, renting a line of 
merchandise that was still more appreciated back home than in L.A. They stuck 
with it doggedly as Americans acquired a taste and the taste became a passion. 
</P>
<P>
It's the story of a business that plugged along modestly at first, then became 
successful, then too successful, some thought. It leapfrogged across Southern 
California, establishing eight satellite stores. Yet it always kept its base 
right where Norbert and Irene Olberz had shrewdly opened their ski shop, at the 
foot of Angeles Crest Highway, the point where Angelenos converge on their way 
to the snow. 
</P>
<P>
As a family business, Sport Chalet seemed to grow without plan, adding new 
lines of merchandise, budding into a compound of unimaginative brown stucco 
buildings that came to dominate their part of Foothill Boulevard. Norbert 
turned his money back into the community in a simple but effective way. He 
started buying property near his store. In 20 years, he acquired 28 parcels, 
most of them houses. His holdings now total almost 12 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Today, as head of a sophisticated corporation, Norbert has drawn up a plan to 
transform the uncomely intersection into a trendy shopping center that he hopes 
to call La Canada Village. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents of the executive-class bedroom community that La Canada 
Flintridge has become don't welcome the idea, preferring uncomely and quiet to 
stylish and frenetic. The airing of their discontent will come soon, when the 
plan goes to the Planning Commission, possibly in May. 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday evening, the town's elite put the controversy out of mind and 
simply celebrated the irresistible Norbert and Irene story. 
</P>
<P>
A party sponsored by the La Canada Chamber of Commerce was held where that 
story began, in the Sport Chalet ski shop. The setting was perfect in its 
awkward simplicity. Guests signed in at the cash register counter, just inside 
the one public entrance. Behind the counter, the shop unfolded as a series of 
chambers, one for apparel, one for boots, one for skis and so on. 
</P>
<P>
The celebrants flowed easily toward the rear chamber -- the rental shop -- 
where a no-host bar was in swing. Along the way, they received the essentials 
of the story as told by Sport Chalet's publicity department in an exhibit of 
photo enlargements on easels, with pithy captions. 
</P>
<P>
"The storefront of Sport Chalet in 1964," said one, under a picture of the 
store. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1959, standing in my lederhosen, next to the newly acquired cash register," 
said another under the image of a slender, young and smiling man in his 
lederhosen, at the cash register. 
</P>
<P>
That same face, only a few years later, looked up from a portable typewriter. 
"In the early days, we worked many long and hard hours as sales clerks and 
accountants," the caption said. 
</P>
<P>
Others showed a young Irene, "Norbert's favorite saleswoman," and the couple at 
home in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The party started shortly after the business day was done. Soon about 200 
people filled all the rooms. Among them were the community's bankers, realtors, 
auto salesmen and, of course, the political set. A councilman ousted in last 
year's election shared the space amicably with a victor. 
</P>
<P>
The mood was effervescent. Spread out as they were, most guests chatted right 
through the formal remarks, which were tastefully brief. Rep. Carlos Moorhead 
(R-Glendale) and Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale) delivered words of praise 
and the obligatory proclamations. 
</P>
<P>
Norbert and Irene, both handsome and trim, accepted self-consciously. He wore a 
blue blazer, slacks and old running shoes. She wore a brown business dress. 
</P>
<P>
Then they cut a three-foot-long cake topped with kiwi fruit and strawberries. A 
team of caterers put aside their trays of quiche and endive tidbits and carried 
cake squares to everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Sam Allen, the company's young chief executive officer, took up a 
position beside a large architect's rendering of La Canada Village and answered 
dozens of questions. 
</P>
<P>
Allen stated his employer's case with unapologetic pride, and he wasn't ashamed 
to throw in a little quiet desperation. 
</P>
<P>
In the four years he's been at Sport Chalet, Allen said, its business has 
doubled while its executive offices remain squeezed into the same corner of the 
loft in the sporting goods shop across the street. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just out of space, like rats in an alley," he said. "I'm not sure we are 
going to last." 
</P>
<P>
It was a forgivable exaggeration. The office across the street does look 
cramped and weary. Yet it is equipped with up-to-the-minute tools, even a paper 
shredder. 
</P>
<P>
And Norbert Olberz still presides there every day with the same equanimity he 
showed 30 years ago standing in his lederhosen over his first cash register.

APPROVAL NEAR FOR COLLEGE CHILD-CARE PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After years of delay, Glendale Community College officials this week said they 
are close to creating a preschool child-care center that would also serve as a 
teacher training and parent education facility. 
</P>
<P>
College trustees late Wednesday were expected to approve a contract to build a 
day-care center for 60 youngsters, primarily children of teachers and students 
but also for the general public. The center is scheduled to be completed by 
fall, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"The college has been trying to get a program like this for 25 to 30 years," 
said Melita Baumann, associate professor of child development. "The need is 
dramatic." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Survey of Needs 
</P>
<P>
The college and the Greater Glendale Child Care Council, a public advocacy 
group, are conducting a survey to determine child-care needs in the Glendale 
area. Results are expected to be released in June. Earlier studies by various 
agencies have estimated that 2,500 to 4,000 preschool children living in 
Glendale are in need of day care. 
</P>
<P>
Baumann said her phone "rings all the time" from parents in search of child 
care. 
</P>
<P>
However, she warned that the cost of the program at Glendale College may be 
high -- probably more than $100 per week per child -- because many of the staff 
will be credentialed teachers hired to train other professionals. Baumann said 
the college is attempting to seek grants and donations to reduce the cost of 
child care for low- and moderate-income parents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Financing 
</P>
<P>
College officials hope that about 90% of the estimated $1-million cost of the 
child development center will be paid through state funds. A state public works 
review board is scheduled to hold a hearing Friday to determine the state's 
share of the project, said Clarence Wolfe, college director of facilities. 
</P>
<P>
He said the lowest bid for the project -- $910,383 by the general contracting 
firm of Pearson and Johnson -- is $122,000 higher than the budget approved by 
the office of the state chancellor of community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfe said that "bids came in higher than anticipated because the project was 
delayed." He said construction "is over a year behind schedule" because the 
college has encountered soil stability problems on the construction site and 
was awaiting the passage of a school bond issue last November. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfe said the facility, to be built on college-owned land at the upper end of 
the campus near Mountain Street and the Glendale Freeway, would have four 
classrooms and a central laboratory-teaching area as well as offices, play 
areas, a kitchen and restrooms. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the facility would cover more than 6,000 square feet. The college's 
preschool teaching laboratory is now housed in a 690-square-foot classroom in 
the school's administration building, Wolfe said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Need for Children 
</P>
<P>
Without a child-care center, the school has had "to beg, borrow and steal 
children" to study in its preschool training program, Baumann said. Students 
are assigned to work in other child-care facilities in the community to gain 
first-hand experience. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most day-care centers that do not accept children under the age of 2 
years, 9 months, Glendale College plans to start toddlers in its program as 
young as 18 months old. Baumann said an understanding of the educational growth 
of infants will be integral to training student-teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Care of very young children will require a higher-than-normal ratio of staff to 
children, Baumann said. "We want to make sure there is a good one-on-one 
training program," she said, which accounts for part of the high estimated cost 
of day-care services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
60 Children 
</P>
<P>
Baumann said the program initially will be limited to 15 children in each of 
four classrooms. Additional classrooms may be added later, if possible. 
</P>
<P>
Jill Larson, coordinator of parent education, said the day-care center also 
will be used for parenting classes. She said more than 500 adults are enrolled 
in 22 such classes, which are now held on the college's Montrose campus.

GLENDALE EXTENDS MORATORIUM ON APARTMENT, CONDO CONSTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale City Council extended its moratorium on apartment and condominium 
construction for the second time and instructed staff members to come back in a 
month with proposals to lower the city's population density. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted unanimously Tuesday to extend the moratorium to give itself 
more time to evaluate changes to the city's zoning code, which would require 
all new apartment construction to be smaller, shorter and better looking. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said that the proposed ordinance should be ready for further 
review by June 1 and that they would vote on it by mid-July. The ordinance 
would become effective 30 days after its adoption. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moratorium Extended 
</P>
<P>
The initial 150-day moratorium was adopted Sept. 27 to prevent an overflow of 
building permit applications during reevaluation of the city's building and 
zoning codes. It was extended into April on Jan. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the proposed zoning ordinance in council chambers for the first 
time after more than two months of public hearings, most council members seemed 
satisfied with the staff proposal and asked for only minor changes. 
</P>
<P>
They did say, however, that additional legislation will be required to control 
growth of the city's population, which stands at 165,000 and could go up by as 
much as 100,000 if the zoning code is not changed. Council members have said 
they want a maximum of 200,000 residents, as projected in the city's general 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
"When we saw the ordinance, we knew it wasn't enough. It didn't address the 
basic issue, which is population growth," Mayor Jerold Milner said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Oppose Proposal 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Larry Zarian proposed sending letters to neighborhoods and 
individual homeowners to ask them if they wanted to see their home or 
neighborhood downzoned, which means reducing the number of allowed units on any 
given lot. 
</P>
<P>
Some developers, real estate agents and homeowners have said they oppose 
downzoning because it lowers property values. 
</P>
<P>
"Let the populace decide," Zarian said. "A lot of people want to go to heaven, 
but nobody wants to die." 
</P>
<P>
Milner asked staff members to look at an innovative method of limiting 
population growth: by limiting the size of parking garages to half the size of 
any given property. This, added to the proposed stringent parking requirements, 
would limit roughly by half the number of units a developer can build on an 
average lot, Milner said. 
</P>
<P>
Zarian, however, questioned Milner's idea, which would also limit the number of 
cars to two per unit, noted Zarian. "What about families with more than two 
cars?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Have to Live With It' 
</P>
<P>
"I'd have to tell them, 'Tough, guys, you'll have to live with it,' " responded 
Milner, pointing out that the city's need to reduce traffic congestion and air 
pollution will have to be made a priority. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Carl Raggio, Dick Jutras and Ginger Bremberg said they would 
support more downzoning and asked the staff to change the proposed height 
limitation from a maximum of three stories to an undetermined but roughly 
equivalent number of feet. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand feet better than stories," Bremberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Raggio and Milner also asked staff members to look into requiring the creation 
of a "buffer area" between single-family and multifamily neighborhoods that 
would force apartments adjacent to houses to be no bigger than two stories. 
</P>
<P>
Before the council began its deliberations, it heard a request by an attorney 
of a developers group that about 30 projects in the final plan-approval stage 
that were delayed by the moratorium be given relief. 
</P>
<P>
"My client has participated in the process of reevaluating the city's building 
regulations and it has done so in good faith . . . now we ask you for some kind 
of relief," said Dana Sherman, attorney for the Fair Growth Coalition. Milner 
answered that the council will look into it.

PACIFIC PALISADES CLAMPS LIMITS ON HOUSE SIZES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite criticism that the guidelines aren't appropriate for many 
neighborhoods, the board that governs building design rules in Pacific 
Palisades has approved a plan to halt the number of "monster homes" being built 
in the affluent Westside community. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Palisades Civic League voted to set a maximum single-family house 
size of 2,000 square feet plus 28% of the lot size and restrict the height of 
new and remodeled homes to 28 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The building limits were approved and went into effect this month after nearly 
a year of study and several heated community meetings. Many residents and two 
members of the 19-member board, Len Becker and Jack Allen, objected to the 
guidelines. They said they are too restrictive for some areas of town and too 
lax for others. They contend that the plan offers no guidelines for specific 
neighborhoods, where in some cases a large two-story house would be out of 
character. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I think that we should have set a lower standard and then allowed 
applicants to come in and justify that they need more space," said board member 
Allen, one of those who opposed the plan. "The way it's set up now, projects 
will slip through that should not be approved merely because the board won't 
modify projects even if they aren't in harmony with the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Variances Allowed 
</P>
<P>
The criticism prompted the board to allow property owners to seek a variance 
from the guidelines "based on special circumstances of a particular project," 
but Allen said that the amendment did not go far enough. For example, he said 
building guidelines for homes on narrow streets should be more restrictive than 
others "because large houses simply wouldn't fit there." 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, a homeowner with a 5,000-square-foot lot would be limited to a 
3,400-square-foot house. The biggest home allowed on a 10,000-square-foot lot 
would be 4,800 square fee. The guidelines also call for a maximum second-story 
addition of 800 square feet plus 12% of the lot area. 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions were imposed after homeowners bombarded the civic league with 
complaints about the recent wave of "mansionizing" in the Palisades. The trend 
to tear down existing homes and build massive houses, nearly filling the lot, 
has plagued other Westside communities, such as Santa Monica, Brentwood and 
Beverly Hills, in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't sit down and figure out every factor, so this is the best 
compromise we could get," said board member Ron Dean. "It was a real struggle, 
and if everybody built up to the guidelines, we would have a mess. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changes Later 
</P>
<P>
"But we've tried to stimulate individuality with these guidelines. I'm not 
unhappy with them and I'm not happy with them. But later on we'll probably be 
better able to tell what changes we need to make." 
</P>
<P>
Lila Gordon, president of the board, said earlier that the goal was to make the 
building guidelines more restrictive "because the current guidelines are not 
working." 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting earlier this month, several property owners expressed concern that 
the restrictions would make potential buyers wary and might decrease the value 
of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the homeowners agreed unanimously that some stricter guidelines were 
necessary to keep residential developers from building huge homes to maximize 
profits during the recent real estate boom. 
</P>
<P>
Current guidelines, approved by the board last year, restrict the height of 
houses to 32 feet. But there are no other restrictions on the size of new and 
remodeled homes, and several developers have been tearing down existing homes 
and building massive houses that look out of place on blocks filled with small 
two- and three-bedroom properties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Countywide Problem 
</P>
<P>
During the past three years, the trend toward erecting huge homes has forced 
city councils and planning boards throughout Los Angeles County to begin 
grappling with the difficult issue of size restrictions for single-family 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Planning Commission is studying a proposal to place a 
25-foot height limit on house lots under 7,500 square feet. Homes on lots up to 
15,000-square-feet would have a height limit of 35 feet. In the city of Los 
Angeles, the height limit for all single-family homes is 45 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The Palisades guidelines are similar to restrictions proposed in Beverly Hills, 
where city officials are looking at a cap of 1,500 square feet for homes on 
small lots plus 35% of the lot size. Two years ago, the Beverly Hills City 
Council adopted a temporary ordinance limiting the size of houses to 55% of lot 
size. The council made the ordinance permanent last June to allow the Planning 
Commission more time to study the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The Palisades civic league is responsible for design and building guidelines 
for about 60% of the commercial and residential property in the community, with 
the rest governed by private deeds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BUILDING GUIDELINES 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Palisades Civic League, the board that governs building design 
rules, has approved a plan to halt the number of "monster homes" in the 
community. The new guidelines: 
</P>
<P>
* Set a maximum single-family house size of 2,000 square feet plus 28% of the 
lot size. 
</P>
<P>
* Restrict the height of new and remodeled homes to 28 feet. 
</P>
<P>
* Call for a maximum second-story addition of 800 square feet plus 12% of the 
lot area.

DIVING FOR COINS LED TO MORE THAN NICKEL-AND-DIME CAREER

<P>
Diving for coins as an 8-year-old in Honolulu started Tommy Wright of 
Wilmington on a career of sportfishing, spearfishing and commercial diving. 
</P>
<P>
Wright arrived on the Wilmington scene 26 years ago and met diver Jim Smith of 
Palos Verdes, and he credits Smith with turning his hobby into a profitable 
career. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years ago, Wright purchased a boat, the Iwalanii, and during the season 
he dives for abalone at San Nicholas Island. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent trip there he jumped into a shallow rock crack, retrieved his take 
and discovered hundreds of small lobsters. 
</P>
<P>
He said they could be large enough by next lobster season to be brought up from 
traps. 
</P>
<P>
On a sportfishing trip last year, Wright worked Cortez Bank and, with deckhand 
Henry Church, brought aboard a 201-pound big-eye tuna after a 33-minute fight. 
</P>
<P>
Returning from Cortez on a slow troll, he landed a stray albacore that weighed 
33 1/2 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
When diving in his native Hawaii, Wright would spear the ulua, a fish that 
resembles the local pompano but is larger and can weigh up to 95 pounds. But 
unlike the pompano caught off South Bay rocks and piers, the ulua feeds best at 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Now 50, Wright said he no longer spearfishes with heavy tanks on his back and 
just dives shallow to check out reefs. 
</P>
<P>
News note: 
</P>
<P>
The Annie B barge inside the L.A. Harbor breakwater will play host Saturday to 
75 wheelchair anglers, some of whom have never had the opportunity to fish the 
ocean. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: 
</P>
<P>
Bob Keever of San Pedro, fishing aboard the Melong J, caught the whopper of the 
week. Fishing in shallow water at Cherry Bank, he boated a 35-pound cow cod. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Gotoko of Long Beach, at San Clemente Island aboard the Pacifica, won 
the jackpot with a 28-pound cow cod. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Escala of Harbor City won the jackpot on the Sportking with a 23 1/2-pound 
white sea bass pulled out of the kelp. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Ross of Long Beach, on the Topgun at Catalina Island, caught a limit of 
halibut, the largest weighing 15 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Lon Dittrich of West Los Angeles, fishing aboard the Hanky Panky of Torrance 
Beach, caught a 14-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Freshwater Notes: 
</P>
<P>
Donald Campfield of Long Beach landed a tagged rainbow trout at Irvine Lake 
that won him $250. 
</P>
<P>
Jade Ostoya of Venice, fishing Irvine lake, caught a 9 1/2-pound trout. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Baker of Redondo Beach used green grubs and landed a 6 1/2-pound bass at 
Castaic Lake.

7 FORMER BRUINS JOIN UCLA SPORTS HALL OF FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven new members have been inducted into the UCLA Athletic Hall of Fame: 
football players Pete Dailey and Tom Fears; Vic Kelley, a golfer, golf coach 
and sports information director; Carl McBain and Pat Turner, who competed in 
track and field; swimmer Karen Moe-Thornton and volleyball player Ernie Suwara. 
</P>
<P>
Dailey was a single-wing fullback and tailback on top UCLA teams during 
1951-53. In his senior year the Bruins won the Pacific Coast Conference 
championship. He also played defense, was a place-kicker and returned punts and 
kickoffs. An advertising man who also served in the administrations of 
Presidents Nixon, Ford and Reagan, he was U.S. ambassador to Ireland in 
1982-83. 
</P>
<P>
Fears had a fabled football career as an offensive and defensive end with the 
Bruins and as a record-setting receiver with the Los Angeles Rams. He was 
UCLA's Most Valuable Player in 1947 and from 1948 through 1956 caught 400 
passes for 5,397 yards for the Rams. He also was a head coach in professional 
football and is a member of the NFL and National Football Foundation halls of 
fame. 
</P>
<P>
Kelley, who retired as sports information director in 1981 and is UCLA's sports 
historian, was a golfer from 1934 through 1936 and sports information director 
for 36 years and head golf coach for 27 years. He is a member of the Golf 
Coaches and Sports Information Directors halls of fame. 
</P>
<P>
McBain was a top hurdler during 1938-40 and was team captain as a senior. In 
1940 he won the National Amateur Athletic Union hurdles championship, setting 
an American record of 51.6. After serving in the Navy in World War II, he was a 
medical researcher for the Atomic Energy Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Moe-Thornton was one of the school's first women to receive an athletic 
scholarship and swam during 1974-76. A gold medalist at the 1972 Olympics in 
the 200-meter butterfly, she also set four world records in that event. She was 
captain of 1976 Olympic swim team. The head women's swim coach at Berkeley, she 
was named an NCAA Coach of the Year in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Before volleyball became an NCAA sport, Suwara was a U.S. Volleyball Assn. 
All-American four times and played on UCLA national championship teams in 1965 
and 1967. In 1964 he was the Most Valuable Player on the U.S. Olympic 
volleyball team and also played in the 1968 Olympics. He works for Dean Witter 
and the Kansas City Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
Turner placed third in the broad jump (now called the long jump) in the 1939

day after the frenzy, lottery officials waited for two computers to finish a 
mind-boggling search of wagered numbers before letting the world know if anyone 
won a record $100 million-plus jackpot, but 15 claimants stepped forward. 
</P>
<P>
Reports circulated that 14 brick factory workers from Ohio were on their way to 
lottery headquarters in suburban Harrisburg to claim at least a share of the 
prize. Another unconfirmed report said a woman from southwestern Pennsylvania 
also believed she had a winning ticket from Wednesday's drawing. 
</P>
<P>
George Andersen, lottery deputy executive director, said that no winners had 
been confirmed and that it may be Friday before the computers will complete the

A 21-year-old man was shot to death during an argument outside a Reseda

</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred about 3 a.m. outside the Seoul Seoul restaurant in the

who was not identified pending notification of relatives, was pronounced dead 
at the scene, Conmay said.

Witnesses told police that the victim had been arguing with Inho Kim, 23, of 
Los Angeles. At one point, Kim went to his car in the restaurant's parking lot 
and allegedly returned with a handgun and shot the victim once in the upper 
body, Conway said. Kim was arrested at the scene and is being held without bail 
at County Jail.

DEATH VERDICT REPEATED FOR TUSTIN KILLER; 
</P>
<P>
ORIGINAL SENTENCE OVERTURNED BY HIGH COURT UNDER BIRD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Galen Davenport, the last of four Orange County men to be retried after 
death penalty reversals by the state Supreme Court under former Chief Justice 
Rose Elizabeth Bird, received a new death verdict from a jury today. 
</P>
<P>
Davenport, 34, of Tustin had been convicted eight years ago in the March 27, 
1980, stabbing death of 30-year-old Gayle Ann Lingle in a vacant Fullerton 
field. She had been stabbed more than a dozen times and was found impaled on a 
four-foot wooden stake. 
</P>
<P>
The Bird court upheld Davenport's conviction but ordered a new death penalty 
trial, ruling that errors had been made by both the trial judge and the 
prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
Davenport had previously served a four-year prison sentence, from 1975 to 1979, 
for the stabbing of a young Tustin woman, Suzanne Tewes. He had been out of 
prison less than eight months when Lingle was killed. Tewes was the key witness 
against him in the penalty phase at his first trial in 1981 and again at his 
new trial. 
</P>
<P>
Davenport admitted stabbing Tewes but denied killing Lingle. He testified at 
length at his first trial. At the new trial, his lawyers put him on the witness 
stand only for the limited purpose of getting his prison artwork into evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Davenport was known as "Honda Dave" to his friends and, during his first trial, 
his bright red-and-white Honda 350 motorcycle sat in front of the judge's bench 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
It was the key evidence against him, because Davenport had put two kinds of 
tires on the bike, each with a unique tread. Both treads, almost on top of each 
other, were cleanly reproduced in plaster casts by crime lab specialists from 
prints found at the scene where Lingle's body was discovered in a vacant field 
at Myford Road and Michelle Drive in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Lingle had last been seen leaving the Sit 'n Bull bar in Tustin with Davenport 
at about 1 a.m. on the morning she was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Everett W. Dickey set formal sentencing for June 23. 
</P>
<P>
The three other men who won new death penalty trials in Orange County -- 
Marcelino Ramos, Rodney Alcala, and Theodore Frank -- all received new death 
sentences.

The City Council approved an ordinance today that would ban plastic packaging, 
despite an effort in the Legislature to block the local restriction. 
</P>
<P>
Council Member Thomas Dimond said community concern about the city's waste 
disposal problems led to the 6-1 vote. "When you see that groundswell, we're 
certainly headed in the right direction," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted to ban non-degradable, non-returnable, non-recyclable 
packaging. The local ordinance, identical to one approved last month in the 
twin city of Minneapolis, would become effective in July, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
A state Senate Tax Committee refused Tuesday to remove from a recycling bill a 
provision that would block such local plastics bans.

A mentally disabled, AIDS-stricken 7-year-old stepped into a classroom for the 
first time in her life today, with bows in her hair, a knapsack on her back and 
the cheers of supporters surrounding her. 
</P>
<P>
Her adoptive mother, Rosa Martinez, who fought a 2 1/2-year court battle 
against school officials who feared a health risk and had required that the 
girl be confined to a glass isolation booth, called today the most important 
day in her daughter Eliana's life. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters cheered as mother and daughter walked into the one-story, red-brick 
Manhattan Exceptional Center, where 201 students are enrolled. Eliana's teacher 
said many pupils hugged the girl when she came into their classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez is a nurse who adopted Eliana as an infant in her native Puerto Rico. 
Eliana was stricken with AIDS after receiving transfusions of tainted blood 
shortly after her premature birth.

Dan Quayle, noting he is the first American vice president born after World War 
II, celebrated with Australians today the Allied operation 47 years ago that 
beat back Japanese forces advancing toward this nation. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle, on a five-day visit to commemorate Australian-American Friendship Week, 
said the two countries must dedicate their relationship "to keeping peace in 
this region." 
</P>
<P>
At a black-tie dinner, Quayle, 42, discussed the spirit of cooperation that 
took place in May, 1942, when American and Australian naval forces turned back 
the Japanese at the Battle of the Coral Sea off the northeast coast of 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
The vice president, who arrived here from Canberra, read a proclamation from 
President Bush that said the relationship between the United States and 
Australia "has thrived in peace because of our mutual respect, shared ideals 
and coordinated strides toward a more secure and prosperous world." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Quayle, who has recently taken a keen interest in space policy as the 
head of the National Space Council, toured a National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration facility deep in the Australian bush. Asked about the recent 
resignations of six top NASA officials, Quayle said it is an "interesting 
problem" that the Administration must confront.

West Germany will halt an unpopular tax on investment earnings July 1, just 
four months after its introduction, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said today. 
</P>
<P>
In a major speech to Parliament on domestic and foreign policy, Kohl said West 
Germany must tackle increased global competition to maintain its position as a 
leading exporter. 
</P>
<P>
"It is right that the experience of the last months makes some corrections 
necessary," said Kohl. "The withholding tax will be abolished from July 1, 
1989." 
</P>
<P>
The 10% levy, imposed in January and deducted at the earnings source, has 
prompted many West German investors to shift funds to countries such as 
Luxembourg, weakening the usually strong mark. 
</P>
<P>
The tax would have earned the state $2.3 billion this year.

New cases of baby food tampering were reported today across England as well as 
in Ireland and Northern Ireland, and three babies were treated by doctors after 
eating food tainted by extortionists, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper reports said that food companies had paid $850,000 to extortionists 
and that the extortionists were demanding another $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph said police believe that a gang that extorted $85,000 from 
a large supermarket chain this year is responsible. Scotland Yard refused 
comment on the reports. 
</P>
<P>
Parents today reported finding glass, pins, needles and caustic soda in jars 
and cans of baby food and in one case, powdered milk. Police did not say how 
many new cases were reported, but as of Wednesday there had been at least 50 
cases in England alone. 
</P>
<P>
Three babies were taken to hospitals in Leicester, Exeter and Leeds and later 
released. One mother found glass fragments in her baby's food, and another 
discovered two pieces of metal. The third baby became ill when eating a banana 
dessert, police said. 
</P>

2 Firms Offer Rewards 
</P>
<P>
New cases turned up in the province of Northern Ireland as well as across the 
border in the Republic of Ireland, police said. 
</P>
<P>
H. J. Heinz Co. Ltd. and Cow &amp; Gate Ltd., two of Britain's leading food 
manufacturers, on Wednesday offered a total of $169,000 for information leading 
to the conviction of the extortionists. 
</P>
<P>
Heinz, whose parent company is the Pittsburgh-based food giant, and Cow &amp; 
Gate said they had received extortion demands but refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph said police suspected a gang of extortionists who 
reportedly got $85,000 from a supermarket chain this year after threatening to 
poison food on its market shelves. The gang threatened to spike baby food 
unless it was paid $1.7 million, the newspaper said. It did not name the 
victimized supermarket chain.

The prices Americans pay for imported goods rose 1.7% during the first three 
months of 1989, down slightly from the pace in the previous quarter, the 
government reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said the first-quarter rise followed a 2% increase in the 
final three months of last year and a 1.3% decline during the third quarter of 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
The January-March increase was primarily due to an 18.3% jump in prices for 
imported fuels, led by a 27.8% surge in prices for imported crude oil in 
response to a November agreement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries. 
</P>

Excluding fuels, import prices rose a modest 0.5% during the first quarter 
after climbing 2.4% in the previous quarter. The advance in prices for 
non-energy imports was held down in part by the appreciation of the U.S. dollar 
during the period, the Labor Department said.

<P>
Ford Motor Co. today said its first-quarter earnings rose nearly 1% to $1.64 
billion, the second-most profitable three-month period in automotive history. 
</P>
<P>
Ford, the nation's second-largest auto maker after General Motors, said its 
first-quarter results translated to $3.44 per share, and compared with earnings 
of $1.62 billion, or $3.31 per share, in the first three months of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue totaled $25.87 billion, up 11.5% from $23.2 billion during the first 
three months of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Ford said its first-quarter profit was buoyed by increased profits overseas, a 
continuing source of money for the auto maker. The company said its U.S. 
profits fell 5.6% to $800 million during the quarter, principally because of 
sluggish sales and costs of incentives. 
</P>
<P>
GM last week reported first-quarter earnings of $1.55 billion. Chrysler Corp. 
is expected to release first-quarter results next week.

Mats Wilander and Boris Becker, the top two seeds, played streaky tennis but 
still qualified for the quarterfinals of the $607,500 Monte Carlo Open tennis 
tournament today. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander, ranked second in the world, ran off four games in a row in both the 
first and second sets to beat Uruguay's Marcelo Filippini 6-4, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
The Swede, a two-time French Open champion, was joined in the quarterfinals by 
two-time Wimbledon champion Becker. The No. 2 seed downed 16th-seeded Jordi 
Arrese of Spain 6-1, 6-3, winning six games in a row in the second set. 
</P>
<P>
In other third-round play, Carl Uwe Steeb of West Germany made short work of 
Paolo Cane, Monday's winner over Jimmy Connors, 6-4, 6-1. Horst Skoff of 
Austria, the 13th seed, ousted last year's finalist, Martin Jaite of Argentina, 
7-5, 7-6 (7-5). Alberto Mancini of Argentina, seeded 14th, topped Carl 
Limberger of Australia 6-1, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Ronald Agenor of Haiti, the No. 10 seed, eliminated the last Frenchman, 
Guy Forget, 6-2, 7-5; Guillermo Perez-Roldan of Argentina, seeded eighth, beat 
ninth-seeded Jonas Svensson of Sweden 7-5, 7-6 (7-5); and Jan Gunnasson of 
Sweden defeated Patrick Kuhnen of West Germany 7-5, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Good Mental Test' 
</P>
<P>
After an early rain, the sun broke out in the afternoon, but it started raining 
again in the middle of Wilander's match. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult conditions to play in, but it's a good mental test," Wilander 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander came from 2-4 down in both the first and second sets, turning his game 
around and forcing mistakes from the 21-year-old Uruguayan, rated 46th in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander has had a poor season after losing his No. 1 ranking after the 
Australian Open. He has failed to go past the third round of any tournament in 
1988 and lost twice in the Davis Cup against Austria, although Sweden won. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not putting any pressure on myself yet. Maybe later, before the French 
Open," Wilander said. "But I'm happy with every win."

The Denver Nuggets have sold fewer than 6,000 tickets for Game 3 of the 
first-round playoff series with the Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
The first two games in the best-of-five series will be played Friday and Sunday 
nights in Phoenix. Game 3 is Tuesday night at Denver's McNichols Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the fifth year I've been in Denver, and all five years it seems like 
the same story," team President and General Manager Pete Babcock said. "Whether 
we're coming off 54 wins or 37 wins, no matter what the extreme, it seems that 
our fans want to wait and see what happens before they buy tickets." 
</P>
<P>
The Nuggets plan to break with tradition and televise all home playoff games, 
regardless of turnstile count.

Women's sports in the Summer Olympics received a boost today as 21 new events, 
ranging from baseball to yachting, were officially added to the schedule for 
the 1992 Games. 
</P>
<P>
The International Olympic Committee's executive board also agreed to increase 
the number of players in the women's singles tennis tournament from 32 to 64, 
bringing it in line with the men's field, and to retain the men's and women's 
50-meter freestyle in swimming. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Events Finalized 
</P>
<P>
New events finalized by the board were men's and women's singles and doubles in 
badminton; an eight-team baseball tournament, which had been granted medal 
status 2 1/2 years ago; seven weight categories in women's judo; the women's 
10-kilometer walk in track; women's sailboard and single-handed dinghy sailing; 
four white-water canoe races; a 10-meter running target event in shooting, and 
a women's individual pursuit cycling race. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the board decided to replace the quadruple sculls with coxswain 
with a coxless quadruple sculls event. 
</P>
<P>
It also said it will consider increasing the number of teams in women's 
handball and volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Avoiding Bias 
</P>
<P>
IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch today expressed concern about the growth 
in the size of the Summer Games. He said more than 10,000 athletes are expected 
at the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona and added: "The day will come when we 
shall have to take some drastic decisions and eliminate some events in some 
sports." 
</P>
<P>
Samaranch said the need to avoid discrimination against women's events was one 
of the reasons for the growing size of the Games. 
</P>
<P>
The Olympic authorities and leaders of the 25 sports in the Summer Games 
program also agreed on new measures to eradicate doping. 
</P>
<P>
The unanimous agreement is aimed at unifying the existing anti-doping measures 
undertaken by the International Olympic Committee and the governing bodies of 
each sport.

A doctor told a federal inquiry today he gave Canada's top female sprinter 
anabolic steroids "for no medical reason" because she thought it would improve 
her track performance. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to 10-year-old medical charts and records, Dr. Gunter Helge Koch told 
a federal inquiry he injected Angella Issajenko with depotestosterone -- a 
derivative of male hormone -- "for no medical reason." 
</P>
<P>
"It was on demand," Koch said, adding he first gave her the drug in 1979 to 
treat chronic anemia. But by early 1980, she had overcome the anemia and was 
using the steroids to enhance her performance on the track, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Koch was named as a steroid supplier by Issajenko, her coach Charlie Francis 
and others at the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to notes, Koch said that at the time he doubted the drug's 
performance-enhancing effects. 
</P>
<P>
Koch said he originally thought it was "a reasonable treatment" for anemia 
although he knew the substance was banned in international athletic 
competition.

Injured Oakland Athletics superstar Jose Canseco pleaded innocent to a pair of 
weapons charges today before a packed courtroom filled with fans, city office 
workers and celebrity watchers. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco, dressed in a beige suit, quietly answered Judge David A. Garcia, who 
released the American League slugger on his own recognizance over the protest 
of the district attorney's office. The judge ordered a June 8 preliminary 
hearing on the charges. 
</P>
<P>
The judge drew chuckles from the gallery with his comments that Canseco should 
not have any problem making any future court appearances despite the fact that 
"I understand he occasionally is out of this jurisdiction for business reasons. 
I have heard he's even been as far away as Toronto on occasion." 
</P>
<P>
Canseco was arrested April 21 by UC San Francisco campus police after a 
passer-by saw a pistol on the floor of his cherry-red Jaguar in the medical 
center parking lot. Canseco was at the facility having his injured wrist 
X-rayed. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Shapiro, Canseco's Los Angeles-based attorney, said his client was 
carrying the gun because of telephone threats to Canseco and his wife. He said 
Canseco also did not know he was on a university campus at the time of the 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been getting threatening phone calls for two to three weeks," Shapiro 
said. "People are calling, breathing heavily, using obscene language and saying 
other things. This happens to people who are in the light as Mr. Canseco is, 
and he's scared." 
</P>
<P>
Canseco, who signed autographs while awaiting his turn in court, was greeted by 
cheers and clapping as he left the courtroom. However, he did not speak to 
reporters because his attorney claimed the A's slugger had a wisdom tooth 
removed Wednesday night and had not slept. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro said the 1988 American League MVP is very much distressed by the case. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants it to be resolved as quickly as possible," Shapiro said. "He wants 
his public image to be as good as his image on the baseball field."

The federal judge who came under fire for criticizing baseball's investigation 
of Pete Rose has removed himself from sentencing an Ohio bookmaker who claims 
he took bets from Rose. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Carl B. Rubin sent a one-line order to the court clerk 
taking himself off the case of Ronald Peters, who has said he will plead guilty 
to tax evasion and drug trafficking charges. 
</P>
<P>
The court has assigned Judge S. Arthur Spiegel to sentence Peters. No 
sentencing date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
A story in the Cleveland Plain Dealer this morning quoted Linda Kloth, chief 
administrator of the federal court in Cincinnati, as saying Rubin would remove 
himself because "he just felt there was an appearance of impropriety" because 
of his publicly stated views on the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin accused baseball Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti last Friday of 
"entering into . . . a vendetta against Pete Rose," according to a transcript 
of a conference in the judge's chambers.
