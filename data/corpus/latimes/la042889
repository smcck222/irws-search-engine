CLEAR, WARMER DAYS DUE TO ADD UP FOR A NICE WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Should be a nice weekend for the Southland, the forecasters said Thursday, with 
slightly warmer temperatures today and Saturday and no rain in sight. 
</P>
<P>
Highs both days will probably range from the mid-70s to the lower 80s, 
according to meteorologist Pat Cooper of WeatherData Inc., which provides 
forecasts for The Times. However, Cooper noted, a low-pressure system 
developing over the deserts should increase the on-shore wind currents, making 
Saturday a little cooler at the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service said there will probably be some low clouds and 
local fog along the south coast late tonight and early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Civic Center high Thursday was 70 degrees after an overnight 
low of 51. Relative humidity ranged from 80% to 40%. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California mountains and deserts should get winds up to 25 m.p.h. 
afternoons and evenings for the next day or so. 
</P>
<P>
Surf is expected to be 2 to 3 feet from Santa Barbara to San Diego today and 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
With no storms on the horizon and the normal rainy period slipping away, the 
total rainfall for the season is a skimpy 8.03 inches. Normal to date is 14.53.

PAGAN DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the members of the Truth Missions really knew the "truth" (Only in L.A., 
April 20), they would lighten up. That Christmas was originally a pagan 
festival is beyond all doubt, the tree being equally common in pagan Rome and 
pagan Egypt. Take a trip to the library of your choice and relax; "only 249 
shopping days until Pagan Day," aka Christmas.

The column by Harold Willens (Editorial Page, April 15) describing how American

INFANT MORTALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to Sen. Bill Bradley's (D-N.J.) column "Infant Mortality: A 
National Disgrace," Op-Ed Page, April 21: 
</P>
<P>
The national disgrace is that so many Americans irresponsibly become parents. 
The associated mortality is simply the unfortunate bed that these parents have 
made for their children. If we continue to hold individual freedom as the 
highest value, then we have to accept the results; including high rates of 
unwanted infant mortality, and even worse, high rates of unwanted infant 
survival and the subsequent misspent lives. 
</P>
<P>
If America were to elevate fairness, compassion, and sensible economy to high 
values, then shoveling money at infant mortality prevention would be necessary; 
but also logically and ethically, we would have to promote individual 
responsibility in various ways, including restrictions on inappropriate 
parenthood. I believe America will not accept that sort of restriction. 
Nevertheless, our collective guilt will cause the proposed funding to be found. 
It is hard to imagine a clearer case of treating a symptom while the disease 
runs rampant.

CHENEY'S HOLDING ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush's honeymoon was short, but Defense Secretary Richard B. Cheney 
got none at all in his first few weeks at work. He was overruled by Bush on his 
first major weapons decision and he will be overtaken on his first budget. But 
he can both get even and get ahead if he can explain to the White House and to 
American taxpayers generally what the Pentagon's mission is in this changing 
world and what the mission will cost. No other defense secretary has done that. 
Few have tried. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's first budget is a holding action. It does not cut spending by enough 
-- particularly in research on "Star Wars" -- and it does not come any closer 
than past budgets to drawing a direct connection between money the Pentagon 
proposes to spend and the reason for spending it. As in the past, it fails to 
describe in some intellectual, strategic and tactical detail the dangers that 
make the expenditure so crucial. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney submitted the budget when he did to meet a procedural deadline, one that 
happened to occur before, and perhaps long before, the Bush Administration had 
finished its exhaustive review of national goals and strategies, foreign and 
domestic, on which it says it will base decisions about national security 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Cheney budget would invest money in both a railroad-based 
system of MX missiles with 10 warheads each -- something that the Soviet Union 
would bend every effort to monitor -- and a single-warhead, truck-mounted 
Midgetman missile -- something that the Soviets could ignore because it could 
not be used in a surprise attack. That compelling feature of the Midgetman, 
which makes it less provocative than bigger missiles, is based on the fact that 
only 300 or so are planned, far too few to knock out enough Soviet missiles so 
that they could not fire back in retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wisc.), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, says 
that the partisan politics in Congress mean that the Pentagon cannot get either 
missile unless Republicans and Democrats can each vote for both. It is possible 
that the country could get along without either if it worked hard at 
negotiating away the existence of both large and small mobile missiles during 
future sessions of START arms control talks in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
On that subject, Aspin, whose political judgments are in part molded by 
experience as a serious analyst at the Pentagon years ago, says that the Bush 
White House has been entirely too timid about the utility of arms-control 
agreements in its reappraisal of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Aspin is right about that. It does not make sense to base major Pentagon budget 
decisions on the threat posed by some nuclear weapon if the threat could be 
made negligible by stronger arms-control agreements and new procedures for 
verifying that neither superpower was secretly rearming. 
</P>
<P>
Congress should consider the Pentagon budget a rough draft and put off serious 
consideration of it until the White House review of America's long-range 
military strategy is completed. If the second draft of the Pentagon budget 
comes no closer to reality than the first, it should write its own. Our 
impression is that Richard B. Cheney is too smart to let that happen.

THE ABORTION REVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At today's traditional Friday meeting, the nine U.S. Supreme Court justices 
will take a preliminary vote on their newest abortion case. Whatever the 
justices decide and whatever court opinion they fashion in the coming weeks 
will not end the debate over abortion. The decision will, however, clarify what 
legal battles, if any, remain to be fought, and where. 
</P>
<P>
The justices' questions during oral argument Wednesday revealed the issues that 
are likely to sway the swing votes. Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. 
Kennedy both probed the validity of state intervention in procreation. In 
dialogue with Charles Fried, the former U.S. solicitor general who was arguing 
the government's anti-abortion case, O'Connor asked pointedly, "Do you say 
there is no fundamental right to decide whether to have a child or not? Do you 
deny the Constitution protects that right?" 
</P>
<P>
In his turn, Kennedy referred to a 1965 Connecticut case that legalized the 
sale of contraceptives. To him, the fundamental right of privacy enunciated in 
that case appeared similar to that on which turns the 1973 ruling that 
legalized abortion. Fried argued that the 1965 ruling was right and the 1973 
application was wrong. Logic dictates against that view, and Kennedy's line of 
questioning was a hopeful sign for those who favor keeping the law that now 
allows a woman to choose to terminate a pregnancy by abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The state of Missouri was asking the court to reinstate its law that prohibits 
public hospitals or public employees from performing abortions unless necessary 
to save a woman's life, prevents use of tax money for programs that involve 
abortion counseling and requires tests to ensure that a fetus older than 19 
weeks would not be viable outside the womb. The law, held unconstitutional by a 
federal appeals court, also declares that life begins at conception. 
</P>
<P>
Any provision of that law, once upheld, would become a punitive weapon to be 
used against women, not only in Missouri but wherever anti-abortion forces 
could duplicate it in other state legislatures. The high court can thus stop 
short of heeding the government's request to overturn completely Roe vs. Wade, 
the 1973 case that legalized abortion, but still harm women. 
</P>
<P>
By banning any public conduct or financing of abortions, the law especially 
strikes at the poorest women. If existing law is substantially changed, the 
more affluent would still be able to seek qualified private doctors or travel 
to states whose laws were less hostile to abortion. The poor would either bear 
unwanted children or take their chances with back-alley quacks. 
</P>
<P>
Ours is a government of the people. A substantial number of those people do not 
want legislators or judges in far-off cities dictating their most personal of 
decisions, that is, whether to complete or end a pregnancy. They do not want to 
decide what choices others make; they want simply for government to leave them 
alone to make their own choices, choices that can never be lightly made.

GARDENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As I work in my weed-infested garden daily, I realize, for me, gardening is one 
of the best exercises. 
</P>
<P>
I sit down on my little rug, because when I stand up and chop weeds, I get too 
tired. My whole body gets a workout this way. No spa for me these days! 
</P>
<P>
The pleasures of home gardening are several. I get close to the earth -- it 
seems to soothe me. When I plant my seeds, to see them pop up shortly, growing 
bravely to maturity. Tomato seeds to luscious ripe tomatoes for my salad. My 
very own produce! 
</P>
<P>
Ever since I can remember, right here in central city L.A. where I was born, 
I've had a garden. I remember specializing in carnations -- a dark-red variety 
called Roosevelt. That was many years ago. Also turnips and radishes were 
satisfying to a schoolgirl. In fact, our school had a healthy garden in which 
the students worked during the week. Why, oh why, aren't school gardens popular 
these days in L.A.? I haven't seen any -- maybe they abound in different 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, for our young people here in L.A. to transfer their energies to healthy, 
prideful activities! Right around them are the ingredients -- a lovely climate 
-- where things grow easily -- not snow and excessive heat. Even a little 
ground around a disadvantaged neighborhood could be cultivated and bring forth 
thrilling, little plants. 
</P>
<P>
Gardening education is vital, I like to think.

NEW PIERCE PRESIDENT VOWS TO REVITALIZE AGRICULTURE PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The newly appointed president of Pierce College assured Woodland Hills 
residents Thursday night that the school's agriculture program will grow -- 
even if its farmland shrinks. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Means told members of the Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization that a 
special committee is completing a study of ways of revitalizing Pierce's 
struggling agriculture curriculum. He said a second panel will soon be formed 
to come up with a long-range master plan for use of campus land. 
</P>
<P>
"I can guarantee you that the agriculture program at Pierce will continue," 
Means told about 60 residents meeting at the Pacific Boys Lodge in Woodland 
Hills. "We may not need all the land . . . we don't know yet." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the homeowners group, which recently sued the Los Angeles Community 
College District to overturn the lease of 17 acres of surplus Pierce land, 
listened solemnly as Means pledged that the group will have a voice in college 
land-use planning recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
But Means, who begins full-time work as Pierce's president on June 1, stressed 
that it will be up to him or college trustees to determine how the 400-acre 
campus is used in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"We think there is a need for an agriculture program in the San Fernando Valley 
and in the Los Angeles area," Means said. "But how it is put together and the 
size of it . . . will probably change. It would be an absolute shame to do away 
with the agriculture program at Pierce." 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was the first between Means and community representatives since his 
selection a month ago by college district trustees. He admitted that he is Los 
Angeles-born and raised, and has no farm background. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Rely on the Experts' 
</P>
<P>
"I'll rely on the experts to tell me where we should go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that the Pierce agriculture department has been split by debate 
over how to solve problems of sagging enrollment, Means said an early goal will 
be to "try to mend all those wounds." 
</P>
<P>
Rosemary Woodlock, president of the homeowner group, said Means' background as 
a college district labor negotiator could help with that task. 
</P>
<P>
But because the homeowners will go to Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday 
to press their case against the college district over the lease, she declined 
to let organization members question Means specifically about that issue. 
</P>
<P>
Means told the group that he is not fully aware of all of the issues 
surrounding the controversial Warner Ridge office project proposal outside the 
southwestern edge of the college campus.

TV SESSION TO BE TAPED TODAY; 
</P>
<P>
BERNARDI, CHALLENGER TO FACE OFF IN 3 DEBATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi and challenger Lyle Hall, who 
sparred by remote control during the primary campaign, said Thursday that they 
have agreed to three debates, starting with a taped-for-television session 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The pair, pitted against one another in the June 6 runoff election, relied 
largely on mailers before the April 11 primary, with Hall attacking Bernardi's 
age and council attendance record and the 77-year-old councilman criticizing 
Hall, a city Fire Department captain, as a tool of organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
They are expected to try to emphasize the same issues in today's taped 
half-hour debate, which will be broadcast at 9:30 a.m. Sunday on KCBS-TV, 
Channel 2. 
</P>
<P>
The 49-year-old Hall, saying he was "delighted he has at last agreed to a 
debate," nonetheless criticized Bernardi for declining a joint appearance 
Thursday at a Greater San Fernando Valley Lions Club luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi said he passed up the event because it was in Studio City, outside his 
7th District, "and I was busy with things in the district. Also, we're going to 
get plenty of chance to debate with these three sessions." 
</P>
<P>
The pair will also face off at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at Mary Immaculate Catholic 
Church in Pacoima. The debate will be sponsored by Valley Organized in 
Community Effort, a grass-roots organization formed by Valley churches and 
synagogues. 
</P>
<P>
At 7 p.m. May 9, they will debate at the Branford Park community building in 
Arleta. That session will be sponsored by the Arleta Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi, who with 28 years of service is the senior member of the council, 
received 42% of the primary vote, short of the majority required to avoid a 
runoff against Hall, who was second with 26%. It is Bernardi's first runoff 
since he was elected to the council. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bernardi Hires Consultant 
</P>
<P>
The councilman, who relishes his public image as a maverick who disdains 
conventional political behavior, said Thursday that he has hired veteran 
consultant Allan Hoffenblum to write his mailers and advise him on campaign 
strategy -- the first time in more than two decades that he has employed such a 
professional. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough race and I'm not so stubborn that I won't get the kind of help I 
need to win," Bernardi said. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffenblum, based in the South Bay, has worked mostly for Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Political analysts view Hall's flurry of hard-hitting mailings, which were 
drafted by Newport Beach-based campaign consultant Harvey Englander, as 
responsible for forcing the race into a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi on Thursday also offered no apologies for a fund-raising reception, 
sharply criticized earlier in the week by Hall, being organized on the 
councilman's behalf by council President John Ferraro. 
</P>
<P>
At least 10 other council members are expected to attend, and a Ferraro 
spokesman said they have been asked to bring along veteran campaign 
contributors, including lobbyists, to boost Bernardi's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Hall said the event, scheduled Wednesday at the private Los Angeles Athletic 
Club, "has the potential of smacking of elitism and being an attempt of the 
system to perpetuate itself." 
</P>
<P>
He also charged that the anticipated presence of lobbyists means that Bernardi 
supporters were "bringing in the influence brokers to muscle them for 
contributions." 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi said Thursday that his knowledge of the event was limited to newspaper 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
"But make no mistake about it, I welcome the support from John," he said. "And 
I trust that what he arranges will be done in a proper manner."

JUDGE URGES DEATH FOR MAN IN RAPE, BEATING, FATAL BURNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge Thursday recommended the gas chamber for a Palmdale man who said he was 
possessed by an evil alter ego when he raped a woman, beat her into a coma, 
then set her bed afire. 
</P>
<P>
James Scott, 26, was sentenced in 1986 to 26 years in prison for raping, 
beating and burning 24-year-old Wanda Jensen. He was charged with first-degree 
murder after the comatose victim died in 1987 of complications from her burns. 
</P>
<P>
The murder charge was heard in a non-jury trial before Superior Court Judge 
Margaret M. Grignon, who recommended the death penalty Thursday. Grignon will 
review the case before she imposes final sentencing on May 18. 
</P>
<P>
Scott surrendered to Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies four days after the 
April, 1986, attack on Jensen. He told investigators that "Tony" took over his 
body and caused him to rape the woman, beat her with a baseball bat and set her 
bed afire. 
</P>
<P>
"He does horrible things," Scott was quoted as saying. "He's inside me, and he 
comes out at night." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Kent C. Cahill said that story eventually 
hurt Scott's defense, and Scott abandoned it during the murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
"No one bought Tony," Cahill said. "Instead of being remorseful, he came into 
court with this wild story." 
</P>
<P>
At the murder trial, Scott maintained that poor medical care caused Jensen's 
death, so he should be found innocent. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney William Allen Clark had agreed to a non-jury trial, saying the 
facts of the case were so appalling that the average juror would be too 
horrified to render a fair verdict. 
</P>
<P>
The possible death penalty for the charges made a non-jury trial unusual, but 
not unprecedented in the state. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, nurse Robert Diaz was convicted of murdering 12 elderly nursing home 
patients by lethal injections of a muscle relaxant. Riverside County Superior 
Court Judge John H. Bernard sentenced Diaz to death at the non-jury trial.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO ATTACK WITH NEEDLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 38-year-old Northridge man pleaded guilty Thursday to sexual battery in 
connection with an incident in which authorities said the defendant used a 
livestock needle to inject a woman with unknown substances. 
</P>
<P>
Fernando Ramos was originally charged with assault with a deadly weapon and 
another count of sexual assault in the Feb. 24 incident involving a 30-year-old 
Chatsworth woman. Those charges, however, will be dismissed as part of a plea 
agreement, Deputy Dist. Atty. Meredith Rust said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim met Ramos when he answered an ad she placed in a newspaper seeking a 
roommate, according to court documents. Ramos told the woman he was a 
registered nurse and a professional masseur and offered to treat her for back 
pain, the documents said. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos injected the victim with the high-gauge veterinary needle while pinning 
her down and sexually assaulting her, Rust said. Authorities were unable to 
determine what substance was used in the injection. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos is free on $20,000 bail and was ordered to return to court on June 8 for 
sentencing. Rust said she will seek a minimum of six months in County Jail and 
three years probation.

<TEXT>
<P>
A21-year-old man was shot to death during an argument outside a Reseda 
restaurant early Thursday, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred about 3 a.m. outside the Seoul Seoul restaurant in the 
8200 block of Louise Avenue, Detective Pat Conmay said. The victim, who was not 
identified pending notification of relatives, was pronounced dead at the scene, 
Conmay said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police that the victim had been arguing with Inho Kim, 23, of 
Los Angeles. At one point, Kim went to his car in the restaurant's parking lot 
and allegedly returned with a handgun and shot the victim once in the upper 
body, Conmay said. 
</P>
<P>
Kim was arrested at the scene and is being held without bail in Los Angeles 
County Jail, Conmay said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OPERATIONS BEING PHASED OUT AT ENCINO BRANCH 
COURT BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Operations at the Encino branch court building, a former grocery store plagued 
by a sagging roof supported by 66 posts, will begin to be phased out Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Small claims cases, formerly heard at the facility, will be handled at the new 
10-story Van Nuys Municipal Court building at 14400 Erwin St. beginning next 
week, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The court will continue to hear other civil matters until mid-July, when the 
building's doors will be closed for good, said Peggy Shuttleworth, chief of the 
court's Van Nuys division. All of the court's business will then be transferred 
to the new Van Nuys facility. 
</P>
<P>
Workers and visitors at the Encino branch in the 5700 block of White Oak Avenue 
have had to maneuver around the support posts, which were installed in 1986 
after the demolition of two neighboring structures caused the building's roof 
to sag, Shuttleworth said.

Hungry? How about a steak dinner with all the trimmings, followed by a 
strawberry sundae piled high with whipped cream? If vinyls, polyurethanes and 
resins are to your taste, this is the place for you. Iwasaki Images of America 
is a practitioner of the arcane art of food replication: making lifelike 
foodstuffs from synthetic materials. Long used in Japan, fake food is 
increasingly used in the United States for restaurant displays, film props and 
even as novelty gifts. When durability is required, a complete salad bar -- 
fake right down to the crushed ice -- will look fresh and green into the next 
century. The company can create an attractive "menu" from its catalogue of 
ready-made items, or it will bake, drill, paint and glue a customized item on

Images counts among its customers Disneyland, Anheuser-Busch, Hickory Farms and 
Burger King.

MCA THREATENS TO SUE BRONFMANS IN BATTLE FOR CINEPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the directors of embattled Cineplex Odeon gathered Thursday in Toronto for a 
board meeting that promised to be tense, new skirmishing broke out among the 
three prominent factions struggling to shape the movie theater concern's 
future. 
</P>
<P>
MCA Inc., the largest shareholder, threatened to sue representatives of the 
powerful Bronfman clan who revived efforts to sell privately a 30% stake to 
Cineplex Chairman Garth H. Drabinsky and certain associates. MCA indicated that 
it would also name Drabinsky and three allied directors in its suit. 
</P>
<P>
A few hours later, the Bronfmans and the Drabinsky group appeared to retreat, 
telling the the Quebec Securities Commission that they were not prepared to 
conclude their agreement, which would require the commission's approval. If the 
deal goes through, Drabinsky will control more than 34% of the common shares 
and have an upper hand over MCA, which is limited to a 33% voting stake 
although it holds nearly half of Cineplex's stock. 
</P>
<P>
MCA has accused Drabinsky of trying to avoid making a tender offer to all 
shareholders and urged the Cineplex board to appoint a committee "made up of 
directors having no interest in the proposed transaction" to weigh the deal and 
determine whether the board should seek outside bids. 
</P>
<P>
There were few clues Thursday evening, however, about the progress of the board 
meeting, which was expected to begin in the late afternoon. Cineplex Executive 
Vice President Lynda E. Friendly said she would not comment on any aspect of 
Cineplex's affairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Notified Firm 
</P>
<P>
If MCA prevails in the formation of a committee, its five representatives on 
the Cineplex board would outnumber the four remaining directors who are not 
involved in the proposed Drabinsky-Bronfman transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Cineplex, in a prepared statement, said it had received written notice that MCA 
intended to apply for permission to file suit on behalf of Cineplex in the 
Supreme Court of Ontario against Drabinsky and three other directors who have 
joined him in the effort to acquire a controlling block of stock from the 
Charles R. Bronfman family. The other three directors identified as potential 
defendants in the suit are Bronfman representatives on the Cineplex board. 
</P>
<P>
Cineplex said it was unaware of any grounds for the legal action and said the 
company would resist "if and when it is brought." 
</P>
<P>
The Bronfmans have submitted two previous proposals for the transfer of 
Cineplex shares to the Drabinsky group, only to be turned down by the Quebec 
Securities Commission. Late Thursday, the commission said it would cancel a 
public hearing today regarding a third proposal because "the Bronfman and 
Drabinsky groups informed the commission they weren't ready to conclude an 
agreement." 
</P>
<P>
Details of the third proposal have not been made public, but it reportedly 
involves about 6.5 million Cineplex shares, or 27% of the outstanding common 
stock.

ICA CONSIDERING MARRIAGE WITH A STRONG PARTNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under pressure to increase its capital, Imperial Corp. of America is 
considering a merger with a stronger institution, Chairman Kenneth Thygerson 
told shareholders during the savings and loan's annual meeting Thursday in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Thygerson also revealed that preliminary discussions during the past year have 
failed to generate any substantive offers. 
</P>
<P>
ICA, which has been ordered to bolster its capital base by the Federal Home 
Loan Bank Board, is considering a merger because "the public markets today are 
simply not providing equity capital or . . . debt capital to the thrift 
industry," Thygerson said. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement with the regulators, ICA created $109 million in reserves 
during the fourth quarter of 1988 and the first quarter this year to offset 
anticipated losses in its car, mobile home and real estate portfolios. The 
reserves contributed to Imperial's fourth-quarter loss of $15.6 million and a 
slender first-quarter profit of 
</P>
<P>
$900,000. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to capital requirements included in the agreement with regulators, 
ICA probably will need more capital to alleviate a crunch Thygerson and other 
S&amp;L industry executives expect to occur when federal legislators complete a 
complicated bailout of the financially ailing Federal Savings &amp; Loan 
Insurance Corp., which insures S&amp;L deposits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bolster Capital 
</P>
<P>
That expected bailout is likely to include new, risk-based capital standards 
for S&amp;Ls that will be driven by the credit risks associated with different 
assets. Imperial, which has entered many riskier and non-traditional 
businesses, probably would have to bolster its capital to meet the new 
requirements, Thygerson said. 
</P>
<P>
Thygerson and industry analysts have predicted that regulators will urge 
capital-short institutions to address the capital shortfall by merging with 
stronger institutions. But ICA's non-traditional S&amp;L businesses could make 
it difficult for ICA to find a suitable merger partner, according to industry 
analysts. 
</P>
<P>
A merger "is conceivable (if ICA finds) someone who's active in the businesses 
it's in," according to David Hochstim, a New York-based industry analyst with 
Bear, Stearns. "But it seems to me that most of the big California companies 
would not be a good match." 
</P>
<P>
"At this juncture, ICA's in something of a bind," according to Allen G. Bortel, 
a San Francisco-based analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton. "The feds are 
calling for everyone in the S&amp;L industry to make more capital available. 
They are also calling for (more capital from) those whose capital is thin and 
those who are in non-traditional (S&amp;L) businesses. And unfortunately, ICA 
is in both of those categories. 
</P>
<P>
"A merger is one route to solve that problem. An investment by a deep-pocket 
investor is another option," Bortel said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, ICA's board is open to an investor who is willing to "take a major 
stake in the company," Thygerson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Meet Minimums 
</P>
<P>
Although ICA has agreed to bolster its capital base, the institution has ample 
capital to meet regulatory minimums, Thygerson said. ICA's regulatory capital 
total of $428.5 million on Dec. 31 surpassed its Federal Home Loan Bank Board 
requirement by $80.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
ICA in January took two immediate steps to bolster its capital position: it 
withheld dividend payments to build capital through retained earnings and it 
agreed with a federal bank board demand that it halt asset growth. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not be paying dividends to shareholders," Thygerson repeated on 
Thursday. "With respect to growth, we've in effect gone into an agreement with 
the (bank board) that we won't grow." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the "poor performance" of its car and mobile home loans, ICA has 
"changed our strategy" and is disposing of those businesses, Thygerson said. 
ICA hopes to improve the profitability of its remaining businesses through 
"added and improved controls." The company also will hire a chief credit 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
ICA was "very disappointed with 1988, coming off two great years in '87 and 
'86," Thygerson told shareholders. "We reported earnings of $14.9 million . . . 
but core earnings (net interest and fee income minus operating costs) were $35 
million, after-tax." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the poor year in 1988, the core earnings give ICA "a very solid base 
from which to move forward," Thygerson said.

EDITORIAL STAFF AT DAILY NEWS VOTES FOR UNION; 
</P>
<P>
MARGIN IS 114-60; GUILD SEEKS OTHER EMPLOYEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Reporters, photographers, copy editors and artists at the Daily News voted 
114-60 for the Los Angeles Newspaper Guild as their union representative, 
according to results made public Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The election comes about three years after editorial employees, who have been 
nonunion, first contacted the union about representing them as their bargaining 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Smith, administrative officer for the local unit of the Guild, said that 
the union will continue trying to organize employees in the newspaper's 
circulation, advertising, finance and marketing departments. Pressmen, 
composing room employees and paper handlers at the newspaper already are 
represented by other unions. 
</P>
<P>
The Daily News, based in Woodland Hills, is owned by sports and 
cable-television entrepreneur Jack Kent Cooke, who paid $176 million in 1985 to 
buy the newspaper from the Tribune Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Circulation Figures 
</P>
<P>
In the six months ended last Sept. 30, the newspaper's circulation averaged 
170,809 daily and 197,311 on Sunday, according to numbers reported to the Audit 
Bureau of Circulations. Cooke could not be reached for comment. In a prepared 
statement, Daily News Editor Robert W. Burdick said: "Our employees have voted 
for a union and so be it. Our goal remains to produce the very best newspaper 
we can for Daily News readers and we have every intention of doing this." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said the vote in favor of the Guild was expected and that the main issue 
in the campaign was "participation in the workplace," although money also was 
an important issue. He said most of the editorial employees at the newspaper 
make from $550 to $650 a week. By contrast, Smith said, the minimum scale for 
editorial employees with five years experience at the Long Beach 
Press-Telegram, a smaller Guild-represented newspaper, is $709 a week. 
</P>
<P>
Sidney Rosen, assistant to the regional director at the Westwood office of the 
National Labor Relations Board, said that under federal law the newspaper has 
until next Thursday to file any objections to the election. 
</P>
<P>
If the Daily News does not object, he said, then NLRB officials would certify 
the results, which would clear the way for bargaining to start.

NORTHERN CALIFORNIA BUSINESS BANKS TO MERGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS FRANTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two successful business banks in Northern California have agreed to merge, 
creating a strong new competitor in Silicon Valley and an inviting acquisition 
target when interstate banking arrives in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The merger will bring together the owners of Plaza Bank of Commerce, with 
assets of $448 million and headquarters in San Jose, and Silicon Valley Bank, 
which is located in Santa Clara and has assets of $304 million. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting bank will be called Plaza + Silicon Valley Bank of Commerce. Jack 
W. Conner, chairman of Plaza, will be chairman of the new institution and Roger 
V. Smith, president and chief executive of Silicon Valley, will be its CEO. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very intelligent deal," said Robert Huret, senior consultant at the 
San Francisco investment firm of Montgomery Securities. "It merges two banks 
with excellent performance records and complementary skills." 
</P>
<P>
Both banks specialize in a market of small and medium-sized businesses and are 
highly rated performers among industry analysts. Plaza emphasizes banking for 
service-industry companies and traditional businesses while Silicon Valley has 
built a strong customer base among the technology firms in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Conner said there is little overlap between the banks. "We are a nuts-and-bolts 
kind of lender and they have this technology expertise and the merger just 
seemed to make an awful lot of sense." 
</P>
<P>
Conner said a Plaza director and Silicon Valley director, who are friends, had 
been boasting to each other for a long period about the quality of their two 
banks. He said that about six weeks ago, the directors suggested that Conner 
and Smith get together to discuss a possible merger. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting deal, which was announced Wednesday, must be approved by 
shareholders of both institutions and regulators at meetings scheduled for this 
fall. The transaction involves exchanging shares of Silicon Valley for Plaza 
Commerce in a ratio to be determined later. 
</P>
<P>
Full interstate banking is set to begin in California in 1991. That means banks 
from outside the West will be able to take deposits and acquire banks in the 
state for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
As successful commercial banks in a prosperous and growing area, Plaza and 
Silicon Valley would have been inviting targets for acquisition in 1991 without 
the merger. But the combined bank, with assets of $750 million, probably 
willcome under even closer scrutiny from outside institutions because of its 
new size and customer base. 
</P>
<P>
Conner acknowledged that the new bank will be more visible to outsiders. But he 
said the added size and combined expertise also will create an institution that 
can compete more effectively with big California banks, such as Wells Fargo, 
and outsiders who arrive in 1991.

Japonica Makes Bid for CNW: Paul Kazarian and his Japonica Partners investment 
group have stepped up their efforts to acquire CNW Corp., making a formal offer 
to acquire the Chicago-based railroad holding company for $721.6 million. The 
offer exceeds by more than $213 million the value that Japonica placed on the 
company in proxy materials mailed to CNW shareholders. CNW's board will meet 
promptly to consider the bid, CNW spokesman Fred Bloedorn said. Japonica asked

$39.50 in cash and $4.50 in preferred stock if the board would agree to a 
merger.

SAVINGS RATE UP IN MARCH; GROWTH IN SPENDING EASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The government said Thursday that consumer spending rose a slim 0.2% in March, 
its weakest performance in six months and a sign, analysts said, that consumers 
are contributing to an economic slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
The sluggish spending came even as personal income rose a strong 0.8%. That 
combination boosted the personal savings rate to its highest level in nearly 
four years, the Commerce Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Thursday's reports provided new confirmation that economic growth 
is slowing and that consumers are helping apply the brakes. 
</P>
<P>
"It is consistent with this view of the wary consumer, of consumers not being 
sure that their paychecks are going to stretch to cover the rising costs of 
things in their budgets," said economist Cynthia Latta of Data Resources Inc. 
in Lexington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Personal income in March rose sharply to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
$4.35 trillion after advances of 1% in February and 1.7% in January. 
</P>
<P>
Personal spending, meanwhile, edged up to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
$3.39 trillion after gains of 0.5% in February and 0.7% in January. Last 
month's 0.2% advance was the weakest performance since spending held steady in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
With the advances in income consistently outstripping the gains in spending, 
the personal savings rate has been edging up and in March hit 6.3%, the highest 
level since it was at 6.4% in May, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The savings rate -- savings as a percentage of after-tax income -- has been on 
the increase since it hit a 40-year low of 3.2% in 1987. Last year, the savings 
rate was 4.2%. In January, it was 5.1%; in February, 5.8%. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts cautioned, however, that the savings rate has been inflated in recent 
months by strong farm income and slower sales of autos and other expensive 
items that have a disproportionate effect on the rate. 
</P>
<P>
The March increase in personal income was due partly to special factors, 
including profit-sharing payments to auto workers, a big increase in 
retroactive Social Security benefits and farm subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
Even excluding those factors, however, income rose a solid 0.6%. 
</P>
<P>
The weakness in spending was concentrated in purchases of durable goods, "big 
ticket" items expected to last at least three years. Spending on durables 
declined 1.5% last month, largely due to slow auto sales. 
</P>
<P>
Purchases of non-durable goods, meanwhile, rose 0.4%; spending on services 
advanced 0.5%. 
</P>
<P>
With consumer spending accounting for two-thirds of the nation's economic 
activity, any slowing trend there can be widely felt. 
</P>
<P>
However, economist Michael Evans, head of a Washington consulting firm, said 
that so far in the slowdown, "consumers are contributing a little bit . . . but 
they're not the main reason." 
</P>
<P>
Added Sandra Shaber of the Futures Group in Washington: 
</P>
<P>
"A major slowdown in consumer spending can tip the economy into a recession, 
but I don't think it's going to be consumers who will do that." 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts expect smaller advances in exports and business investment to 
play a big role in slowing the economy this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve for a year has been pushing up interest rates in an effort 
to relieve inflationary pressures by restraining economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
More information about inflation became available Thursday when the Labor 
Department reported that the prices Americans paid for imported goods rose 1.7% 
in the first quarter while prices of U.S. goods sold overseas advanced 1.4%. 
</P>
<P>
Data Resources economist Nigel Gault said the increases are "consistent with 
the fact that the industrialized nations as a whole are getting close to full 
capacity" at their factories, a condition that can create shortages and 
bottlenecks that drive up prices. 
</P>
<P>
Gault said it will take some time "for the tightening of monetary policy in the 
U.S. and in other industrialized countries to slow down the economies enough to 
have a significant impact on the inflation rate."

UAL, DELTA, USAIR REPORT ROBUST 1ST QUARTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK

<TEXT>
<P>
UAL Corp. and Delta Air Lines Inc. reported record first-quarter profits 
Thursday while USAir Group Inc. turned a profit after suffering a significant 
loss a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UAL Leads the Pack as Its Profits Double 
</P>
<P>
Chicago-based UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines, the nation's largest 
carrier, led the pack, reporting that first-quarter profit from continuing 
operations more than doubled to a record $65.4 million, compared to $27.9 
million for the year-ago period. The results exclude a gain of $548.5 million 
from the sale of operations in the first quarter of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Operating revenue rose to $2.33 billion from $2.06 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
UAL said United Airlines had the highest load factor of the major carriers in 
the quarter as well as much improved revenue yields. The company noted that it 
made the gains without the extensive benefits that other airlines reaped from 
the strike by Texas Air Corp.'s Eastern Airlines unit. 
</P>
<P>
United Airlines on Wednesday ordered up to 370 aircraft from Boeing Co. for 
$15.74 billion, the largest such order in U.S. history, indicating that it 
expects further growth. UAL shares closed up $1.50 at $131.50 in trading on the 
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf told the company's annual meeting in 
Washington that although he has discussed acquiring some of Eastern's assets he 
did not think United would ultimately be a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern, crippled by a machinists strike that began March 4 and pushed it into 
bankruptcy proceedings, is seeking to sell off assets and reorganize as a 
smaller carrier. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Delta's Net for Period Is Company Record 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines Inc. said its net income rose 51.5% to $85.0 
million in its first quarter, compared to $56.1 million in the year-ago period. 
It attributed the gains to sharp growth in passenger revenue, boosted partly by 
the Eastern Airlines strike. 
</P>
<P>
Delta said good economic conditions, continuing benefits from a merger with 
Western Air Lines and growth in domestic and international operations also 
contributed to the increase. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the profit was a record for the period. Operating revenue rose 
19% to $2.04 billion, compared to $1.71 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The key to the increased earnings was the 20% growth in passenger revenues," 
Thomas Roeck, chief financial officer, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
"The strike against a major competitor during the month of March resulted in 
increased revenue passenger miles," he said, "but traffic growth was strong in 
January and February prior to the strike, and in many markets not affected by 
the strike." 
</P>
<P>
He said passenger traffic increased 13% in Atlanta, one of the areas most 
affected by the Eastern strike. 
</P>
<P>
"Yet traffic for the first three months of the year was up 8% in Dallas-Fort 
Worth, 37% in Honolulu, 15% in Los Angeles and 10% in Salt Lake City -- all 
markets where Eastern is not a competitor," Roeck said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
USAir Posts a Profit; Had Loss a Year Ago 
</P>
<P>
Washington-based USAir Group Inc. reported a first-quarter profit of $15.5 
million contrasted with a loss of $18.8 million in the year-ago period. 
Operating revenue rose 18% to $1.48 billion, compared to $1.25 billion a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the results reflected significant improvements in yield at 
both USAir and Piedmont, increasing benefits of last year's merger with Pacific 
Southwest Airlines, which has resulted in the expansion of long-haul flying 
linking the West Coast with the Midwest and Northeast, and improved scheduling 
efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Both USAir and Piedmont also benefited during the quarter from the disruption 
of most operations at Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the consolidated results are USAir Group's principal operating 
subsidiaries, USAir and Piedmont Aviation and four wholly owned commuter 
airlines. Piedmont was acquired by USAir Group on Nov. 5, 1987, and will be 
merged with USAir on Aug. 5, 1989.

that the consolidation is progressing smoothly. The bank said the cost of its 
new signs and advertising came to $2 million in the quarter. Non-performing 
loans decreased slightly from year's end, dropping to $253.9 million from 
$271.6 million, and the ratio of loan-loss reserves to total loans improved to

Management Company Entertainment Group Inc. announced plans Thursday to finance 
and produce at least one film directed by a graduate of USC's School of 
Cinema-Television and to develop at least one student screenplay each year. The 
entertainment company also plans to underwrite most of the costs of USC's 
twice-yearly student film festival (24 student films will be debuted at the 
inaugural festival, June 13-22), according to Jonathan D. Krane, the company's 
chairman and chief executive officer. "I'm always looking to sign up young 
talent," said Krane, who said he had wanted to formalize a relationship with 
USC because "students (are) coming out of there knowing how to make films, 
knowing how to realize their vision on the screen." CLAUDIA PUIG and SHAUNA

In her "School of Velocity" paintings, Robin Palanker pursues one of the old 
lures in 20th-Century art: capturing the moments between significant actions, 
pinning down the look of pure motion. But the works -- with their softly 
rounded forms and their muted grays and pinks -- offer instead a reassuring 
kind of simplicity more closely identified with American regional artists of 
the 1930s. Part of the retro appeal of her work lies in its traditional, 
sometimes rural subject matter: a singer in a swirling pink dress about to 
settle into the curve of a baby grand; two women in long sundresses running 
(with backs to us) down a country road; two pigs rushing forward, ears 
flapping. 
</P>
<P>
The title painting, depicting a soft-gray barn mounted on a circular track-like 
platform, looks a tad too Hopper-esque, although the curious platform provokes 
a weird, closed-circuit anxiety that is specifically Palanker's. Her other 
images of houses -- slightly blurred, perhaps as they would look to someone 
driving by -- are disappointingly bland. 
</P>
<P>
"I-5" is a medley of gray curves of highway seen from the soft grass below; an 
absurdly tranquil scene, really (not a car in sight) except for a slightly 
disquieting, abstract patch of red. In "BFO (Buffalo)," rows of dark tree 
trunks grow in a blue-white pad of snow against a pink sky. This image doesn't 
in the least suggest a landscape seen from a plane (as the title would 
indicate). In fact, it dances with out-and-out triteness (trees in a winter 
sunset -- are you kidding?). But somehow, because of the rhythm of the forms, 
it has the freshness of utter simplicity, honestly achieved. Speed, after all, 
isn't everything. (Krygier/Landau Gallery, 2114 Broadway, to May 19.) CATHY

Anyone who has seen those 1968 photos of sculptor Beverly Pepper clad in 
calf-length boots standing next to her enormous polished aluminum cubes has 
wondered how this statuesque woman could craft those Gargantuan, imposing 
forms. Well, 20 years and a major Brooklyn Museum retrospective later, Pepper 
is still peeling off expectations as fast as we form them. Without missing a 
beat, Pepper has switched from the airy Bauhaus precision of her aluminum work 
to "urban altars" and "columns" -- stalwart, dense forms made from rough hewn, 
dark cast iron with crusty surface textures that take our minds forward to 
factory debris and backward to fertility totems or votive grave markers. 
</P>
<P>
The columns predominate in this show. Set on clunky little mounds or small 
stepped stages, the long lean shafts slice the air, looking like second cousins 
to those spare, mythical sculptures Noguchi made to accompany Martha Graham's 
dances. Structurally the works are based on complex variations of elongated 
hexagonal or octagonal tubes, which tends to give works the look of giant tools 
for tightening bolts. In some pieces, Pepper divides the multi-sided shafts 
into two abutting mirror halves with the thinnest strip of air running up their 
center so that they look like giant, perfectly perched tuning forks. Names such 
as "Vertical Presence I" or "Ritual Sentinel" confirm some personal mythology 
operating here, and completion dates from 1981 to 1989 indicate that every 
subtle counterpoint of weight, balance, internal vs external pressure we 
experience but cannot articulate has been rigorously planned. Whether this work 
is your cup of tea or not, Pepper is a major sculptor who merits attention.

Tony Scherman specializes in sidelong glances and magnetic first impressions. 
His paintings, tenderized with layers of encaustic, often offer dreamy images 
of single women who leap out -- as in a lover's vision -- from the duller 
stream of humanity at bars and restaurants. Backgrounds are more or less 
monochrome, textured rectangles that nonetheless suggest the feel of cozily 
wood-paneled places with lustrous mahogany table tops. Women's outstretched 
arms and shoulders, a dangling earring, a purple blur of lipstick become 
instant objects of desire. 
</P>
<P>
Faintly rendered double-images or extra limbs in some of these works seem ill 
at ease with such a comfortably traditional style; rather than adding temporal 
complexity, they call awkward attention to themselves. In "The Red Leash," for 
example, the Toronto artist peers under the tablecloth and lights on the legs 
of a waitress in a swirled skirt, the demurely crossed ankles of the customer 
and her perky dog. Scherman's easy painterliness -- the leash is just a curling 
red brush stroke -- gives the little genre scene a pleasurable fillip. But the 
floating, lightly outlined arm that curls down from the top of the table -- 
presumably showing a gesture the waitress makes either before or after this 
moment -- seems an overly self-conscious distraction. 
</P>
<P>
In a group of airy black paintings on paper -- the darkness is eaten away by 
waxy incursions -- Scherman nails down quick takes of dogs, a rabbit, still 
lifes and women's faces. The viewer senses that the artist likes to pounce on 
ordinary things at odd, disjointed moments. A few of the full-scale paintings 
venture into realms beyond bustling eateries -- in one canvas, a couple dally 
in a moonlit pool; in another, a black servant tends to a white woman in bed. 
But these images somehow lack the extra spark of the heady stare in 
semi-darkness that picks a single, entrancing detail out of the rushing world.

Ynez Johnston's paintings are sui generis. They are rather like a cross between 
tattoos and pieces of embroidery from a proud non-Western culture that abhors 
vacuums and loves brightly colored, multifarious detail. Recent works, in oil 
and mixed-media (or acrylic and casein) on rice papier-mache mounted on canvas, 
have a thickness and porous texture that belie the delicate, continuous drizzle 
of imagery. Tiny markings and wandering outlines create rambling, fanciful 
universes -- rectangles filled with teeming patterns, picturesque structures 
and enigmatic processions -- that are bordered by rows of fanciful outlined 
creatures. 
</P>
<P>
In collaboration with her husband, John Berry, the artist -- who will be 79 
next month -- also makes tabletop sculptures (she adds the fine details to the 
wood carvings he makes after her initial drawings, which are subsequently cast 
in bronze). These are structures peppered with tiny three-dimensional beasties 
-- balancing on top, posing in little niches -- and a steady drumbeat of 
incised pattern. Sometimes mask-like, sometimes animal-like, sometimes 
reminiscent of ancient monuments, the chimerical forms these sculptures take 
look as though they might have been created by some lost civilization -- which 
probably could while away 1,001 nights telling the tales encapsulated in the 
works' ornate surfaces and eccentric silhouettes. (Mekler Gallery, 651 N. La

'K-9' A SERVICEABLE OUTING FOR BELUSHI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"K-9" (selected theaters) is a buddy movie with a difference: one of the guys 
is a dog. That's just fine because James Belushi and his handsome co-star, a 
German shepherd named Jerry Lee (on screen and off), are as spiffy a team as 
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Jerry Lee, named for Mr. Lewis, is a real 
killer, too. 
</P>
<P>
Cast as a member of the San Diego Police Department K-9 Corps, Jerry Lee can go 
for the throat (and other vulnerable parts of the body) if you're one of the 
bad guys. At other times, Jerry Lee is the complete charmer, albeit always 
independent and unpredictable. He never cottons to the notion that Belushi's 
Detective Tom Dooley is the senior partner of the team just because he is the 
human. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Jerry Lee is just what Dooley needs. Dooley is a headstrong, 
corner-cutting chance taker, the kind of cop forever in hot water and who has 
always resisted working with a partner. (You've met the type a million times 
before on the screen and on the tube; thankfully, Belushi is able to play 
Dooley deftly for laughs.) In helping the detective go after a drug kingpin 
(Kevin Tighe, gleefully nasty), Jerry Lee proves he is far more valuable to 
Dooley than for his ability to sniff out narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
In Steven Siegel and Scott Myers' serviceable rather than inspired script, the 
plot is standard, even stale cops-and-robbers fantasy, a throwaway device 
setting up the funny and touching relationship between Dooley and the German 
shepherd. Jerry Lee may be an exceptionally bright animal, but his trainer Karl 
Lewis Miller deserves much credit for making him seem so human. There is a 
warm, robust, good-natured quality to Belushi that makes his Detective Dooley 
easy to take. Mel Harris certainly is a good sport as Dooley's rich, elegant 
lady who clearly adores Dooley for his love-making abilities rather than his 
intellect. (She was, Dooley recalls, reading Celine on the beach at La Jolla 
when he first noticed her.) 
</P>
<P>
That the plot is never developed beyond the routine and that the jokes are not 
all thigh-slappers, although there are a few, keeps "K-9" (PG-13 for some 
violence and raunchiness) from being more than a minor effort. But as such, 
it's enjoyable, thanks not only to its charismatic duo, but also to the skilled 
comedy direction of Rod Daniel, whose strong sense of pacing is enhanced by 
Miles Goodman's driving but not overpowering score.KEVIN THOMAS

'STEALING HEAVEN' UPDATES HELOISE AND ABELARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is something fascinatingly retrograde about the movie "Stealing Heaven," 
(Westside Pavilion). Set in 12th-Century France, it's based on the legendary 
affair of Heloise and Abelard. But instead of the year 1118, or yesterday, the 
movie suggests the '60s: decade of turbulence, idealism, sex and riot. 
</P>
<P>
The film, shot in Yugoslavia, apes the style of the big '60s costume pictures. 
And writer Chris Bryant paints the lovers as a quintessentially '60s pair: 
long-haired beauties trapped in a cloistered society, battling the hypocrites 
and meanies, the crooked parents, frigid nuns, cops, sneering churchmen, who 
want to stifle their passion. 
</P>
<P>
"Heaven's" Peter Abelard (Derek de Lint) is a charismatic teacher who drinks 
with his students and encourages them to question orthodoxy. And Heloise (Kim 
Thompson) looks like a pseudo-hippie rich girl, Burne-Jones mixed with 
Haight-Ashbury, blasting convention at every opportunity, twitting her 
twitching uncle Fulbert (Denholm Elliott) about his phony religious relics. 
</P>
<P>
One thing that doesn't peg this film as a '60s product is the unblinkered 
sexuality. The eroticism and the ideas get overripe early on. Bryant has the 
pair getting hot for each other by discussing philosophy; they leer over 
theological ripostes, as if each juicy premise were a chicken thigh from Tom 
Jones' banquet seduction. There are more bad ideas: such as the scene where 
Abelard's rascally students plant a naked prostitute in his bed. And another 
where a group of nuns is thrown out of the convent by a heartless bishop; as 
they go struggling up a hillside in the rain, one of them lugs a 6-foot wooden 
cross. (Couldn't they wait and pick up a cross at the next convent?) 
</P>
<P>
By the time we get to the crucial episode, Abelard's castration by the 
hirelings of crazy Canon Fulbert, it's played with incongruous (for here) 
restraint, as if the mutilation purged him of passion, making him a photogenic 
male saint, like Gregory Peck in "The Keys of the Kingdom." 
</P>
<P>
All of the characterizations are hard to swallow, but the actors are easy to 
watch. De Lint glows with dedication, Thompson tosses her great Cosmo 
cover-girl mane ravishingly. Elliott is a fine, squirrelly, sweating villain; 
he seems capable not just of castration, but of sneaking in and pulling hairs 
out of your nose in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
The director of "Stealing Heaven," Clive Donner, may be nostalgic. He made his 
best known and most admired films in the '60s: "The Caretaker," "Nothing But 
the Best" and "What's New, Pussycat?" -- which, unfortunately, may have typed 
him as a king of high-style naughty camp. But, here, Donner shows some feeling 
and style. There is a grating soft-rock score, but the images look 
incongruously rich. The clever production designer Voytek, who did Polanski's 
"Cul De Sac," shows us Notre Dame in mid-construction, and Mikael Salomon's 
cinematography is crisp, burnished and deep; full of plush interiors, 
mist-draped forests and hills. 
</P>
<P>
True to '60s type, "Stealing Heaven" (MPAA rated R for copious nudity, sex and 
strong language) attacks repression as evil. But, what's beautiful about the 
story is the fruit of repression: the letters the lovers wrote after their 
passion was frustrated and which the movie rarely bothers to quote. In a 
different key, made with either the chaste austerity of a Robert Bresson or the 
flamboyant screwiness of a Ken Russell, the film might have worked. In this 
middle ground, it becomes over-pretty, comic. The lovers turn into 
scamp-saints, exiled from a Zeffirelli movie into one by Zinnemann: "The Nun's 
Story" with an emasculated theologian as suffering swain. MICHAEL WILMINGTON

RUSSIAN COMEDY STRIKES RIGHT CHORD IN 'FLUTE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"A Forgotten Tune for the Flute" (AMC Century 14) is a post-glasnost Russian 
sex comedy, fascinating just as much for what it suggests about the Soviet 
Union's current social and political transition as for its sprightly tale of 
love battling hypocrisy. In parts of the movie, writer-director Eldar Ryazanov, 
projects the oddball ecstasy of a man racing out into the sunlight and turning 
somersaults in the snow. 
</P>
<P>
This exuberance gives the material a shine, a bite. It's obvious why "Flute" 
was a big hit in the Soviet Union: It's a salty piece of comic nose-thumbing. 
The film, set in modern Moscow, is audacious in a variety of ways. It ridicules 
the old government, shows some of its representatives as corrupt or stupid, 
blasts censorship and liberally laces its story with sex. 
</P>
<P>
In this story of a Soviet entertainment bureaucrat who falls in love with a 
nurse he sees in an experimental production of Gogol's "The Inspector General," 
Ryazanov emphasizes everything unpleasant, stiff and spurious about the 
government officials. They are unimaginative career drudges from the Brezhnev 
era, trying maladroitly to cope with the new cultural openness. When they see 
avant-garde paintings or plays, works that suggest the artistic movements of 
the 1920s, these Stalinist fogies mutter and get shocked. It's too modern for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Ryazanov, a popular Soviet comic director since his musical "Carnival Nights" 
in 1957, portrays these leaders as dumbbells and secretive snakes, just as 
Gogol did. His central character, Leonid (Leonid Filatov) is a phony bureaucrat 
with a bad heart, a one-time flutist who never plays any more, a social climber 
who married the daughter (Irina Kupchenko) of a bureaucrat above him. He is no 
different, really, from the sell-outs or lecherous executives in American 
romantic comedies, from Fred MacMurray in "The Apartment" to William Hurt in 
"The Accidental Tourist," all those rich stiffs or walking corpses looking for 
a lively, flaky sex-bomb to pull them out of the dumps. 
</P>
<P>
As Nurse Lida, his redeemer kook and life embracer, Tatyana Dogileva is a 
knockout. And, though she has descended from the same plucky worker-heroines 
Soviet films have given us often, she has a new set of post-perestroika 
antagonists: bureaucratic curs rather than counterrevolutionaries. 
</P>
<P>
"Flute" shows the layers of Soviet bureaucracy the way some of the better 
Eastern European comedies have, like Zanussi's "Contract": as a silly parody of 
the class system in Western countries. Soviet comedies may have satirized the 
targets Ryazanov takes a bead on here -- stuffy bureaucrats, chilly wives, 
doltish superiors -- but, when they did, the stories were usually carefully set 
in the past, before the Revolution. Even so, the audience probably skipped past 
all that, responded to the period stories as if they were actually about the 
present. 
</P>
<P>
Ryazanov is a an assured director with a breezy comic style. He is not too 
audacious: a lot of the attitudes here may be shared by Mikhail Gorbachev, who 
is said to be a big movie fan. But he keeps the film lively. The actors punch 
up their performances; the camera moves incessantly; Ryazanov has the pop comic 
movie-maker's knack for peeling away layers of propriety. 
</P>
<P>
There is one withering moment in "A Forgotten Tune for Flute" (Times-rated 
Mature for sex, nudity and adult content). Right after Lenny imagines, in a 
long dream, that he has given it all up, run off to join his lover, he is 
suddenly back in real life, at an office window, watching her walk away. His 
face looks ashy and horrible. He has let freedom get away from him, blown his 
chance. There he is, trapped in the gray room with Brezhnev's old bunch.

'CRIMINAL LAW' A WASTE OF ITS ACTORS' TALENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Criminal Law" (citywide) is a doggedly routine thriller that doesn't deserve 
the vital presence of Gary Oldman, not to mention that of Kevin Bacon and Tess 
Harper. Ever since Oldman first attracted attention in "Sid and Nancy," the 
young British actor has been a brash, distinctive force on the screen. As a 
hotshot Boston attorney successfully defending Bacon's rich aristocrat for 
murder, Oldman is once again electrifying, but he and the capable, rather than 
inspired, British TV director, Martin Campbell, are short-circuited at every 
turn by Martin Kasdan's trite plotting and often pretentious dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
In a bravura display of courtroom maneuvers, Oldman successfully defends Bacon 
on a charge of an exceptionally brutal murder of a young woman. Too flush with 
lucrative success to examine his conscience about the possibility that Bacon 
might well have been guilty, Oldman agrees to meet his client at a park during 
a rainstorm, only to stumble over the still-burning corpse of a second young 
woman. Certain details convince Oldman that Bacon is in fact her murderer, 
perhaps even a budding serial rapist-killer, whom he vows to nail. 
</P>
<P>
Why isn't Oldman, who reports his discovery of the smoldering body to the 
police, ever for an instant under suspicion himself, especially considering 
that the investigating detective (Joe Don Baker) loathes him and that Baker's 
partner (Harper) has become disillusioned with him? The innocent man turning 
detective to save his own skin was a favorite Hitchcock device, and it could 
have given Oldman's quest much-needed dimension and urgency. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, "Criminal Law" proceeds from one weakness to another. Bacon's 
perpetual smirk, coupled with the icy demeanor of his dominating mother 
(Elizabeth Sheppard), telegraphs the plot needlessly from Day One. And why 
should the roommate (Karen Young) of the woman murdered in the park so speedily 
begin an affair with Oldman, whom she has angrily blamed for he friend's death? 
At one point writer Kasdan actually resorts, Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew-style, to 
the discovery of a secret tunnel to further a plot with even more holes than 
have already been related. 
</P>
<P>
Kasdan points up the chasm between law and justice -- hardly news -- overlaid 
with Freudian notions of behavior and Nietzschean considerations of the nature 
of evil. (Not once but twice Oldman has conversations with his tiresomely sage 
old professor.) Yet we know absolutely no more about Oldman's background at the 
end of the film than at the beginning; Oldman's excellent American accent 
sounds as if it might be meant to be smoothed-over Boston blue-collar Irish. 
</P>
<P>
The film also could have benefited from Oldman and Bacon spending more time 
together, from them having developed a kind of friendship. As it is, Bacon has 
a decidedly supporting role, one that requires him only to sound the same note 
of clever craziness over and over. Baker is straitjacketed in a standard tough, 
angry cop role, but Harper's detective is actually the film's best-written 
part, that of a smart, sensible professional. She's the kind of cop you want 
when you're in trouble, and Harper plays her beautifully. 
</P>
<P>
"Criminal Law" (rated R for sex and graphic depictions of the result of extreme 
violence against women) is the latest in the unending parade of films in which 
Canadian cities stand in for American ones and here Montreal and Quebec City 
are ineffective stand-ins for Boston. Seeming neither truly American or truly 
Canadian in flavor "Criminal Law" is in trouble right from the start. KEVIN

Beer is becoming a big deal in restaurants. Some places pride themselves on 
their variety, offering all sorts of exotic brews from faraway places. Some 
actually make it on the premises and prove it by proudly displaying their 
expensive equipment. 
</P>
<P>
But one of the best beers I've had recently is being quietly served at Duplex, 
where there is neither a long list nor expensive equipment. Chef Mark Carter 
does, however, offer his homemade "Carter's Little Pils" in specially marked 
glasses. And if you want a burger with your brew, you'll be glad to know that 
the restaurant's new lunch menu is featuring those as well.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: INDIGO: A LITTLE PLACE WITH MUCH TO OFFER

<TEXT>

What this town needs -- almost anyone will tell you -- is more good 
neighborhood restaurants. Well, another one has just been added to the ranks. 
Indigo, 8222 1/2 W. 3rd St., Los Angeles, (213) 653-0140, is a pretty, crowded 
little place at times where people wander in off the street to eat pizza and 
pasta and eclectic appetizers. It's not a big deal sort of restaurant, but the 
food is sophisticated and most dishes are below $10. And it's already so 
popular that when the heaters in the little patio went out a couple of nights 
ago quite a crowd gathered to wait for inside tables. 
</P>

Once seated they munched on vegetarian "potstickers," skewered chicken with 
peanut sauce, crunchy breaded calamari and pizzas topped with just about 
anything you can think of. They ate big bowls of pasta and garlicky marinated 
skirt steak. And they topped it all off with desserts such as espresso creme 
brulee. While they waited for their food they talked to their neighbors -- the 
tables are really very close together -- and what a lot of them seemed to be 
saying was how nice it is to have a little restaurant like this move in around 
the corner.RUTH REICHL

BRIGHT, INVENTIVE ENTRIES ON BELLINI'S MENU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY

<TEXT>
<P>
Things aren't always as stark as they seem. Bellini's looks like just a little 
neighborhood trattoria -- and not in the most elegant Pico Boulevard 
neighborhood, either -- and it is a bit bleak inside. Gray walls. Butcher paper 
on the tables. Pen-and-ink drawings of old men's faces. 
</P>
<P>
But the menu is full of bright spots. The food tends to be light and inventive, 
most of it in effect vegetarian, including a couple of cheeseless pizzas. There 
is a decided personal tone to it, including a mild mania for fennel. 
</P>
<P>
The fennel thing begins before the meal, in fact, with the plate of fresh bread 
studded with fennel seed. Then there is an eggplant and goat cheese calzone 
with fennel in it, and even a dish of spaghetti mixed with fennel seed and 
fennel bulb sauteed in butter, which has a subtle aromatic flavor and a 
strangely pacifying quality. 
</P>
<P>
The antipasto is mostly just prosciutto and salami, but it includes two 
radishes partly hollowed out and stuffed with spiced ricotta, and some rather 
quaint olives, ordinary black California jumbos with a shred of orange zest in 
each. The cozze alla Rudy are just mussels in lemony broth, but incredibly 
plump and fresh-tasting. 
</P>
<P>
Among the pastas, farfalle Delfi are probably the most unusual, bow-tie pastas 
with browned baby artichoke hearts and chopped walnuts. Because of the wine or 
the walnuts, the pasta has an eerie purplish-brown color, but the combination 
of mildly bitter flavors is fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
I don't mean to say everything is great. In fact, there are some basic flaws 
here, above all with the rice. The special of veal involtini steamed (steamed!) 
in spinach -- "an upscale hot dog," as someone described it -- came in a 
delicious sauce that wasn't much more than pureed porcini mushrooms and black 
pepper. But alongside this was rice (wonderfully flavored with lemon and basil) 
of a positively mushy consistency. The saffron risotto, likewise, was full of 
jolly saffron, but overdone and porridgy. 
</P>
<P>
I hasten to add that the saffron pastas, of which there are more than one, are 
very good, such as the saffron linguine with fresh tomato coulis. 
Unfortunately, since they're pastas the saffron adds more color than flavor. 
</P>
<P>
The pizzas, at least the ones I've had, are rather sharply flavored, One of the 
three made without cheese consisted simply of fresh tomatoes topped with 
reconstituted porcini. It would be hard to imagine making a main course of 
this, though it would be OK split with a couple of people as an appetizer. 
Ditto the rather sharp calzone melanzane. 
</P>
<P>
There are only about three desserts, the best of them a ricotta cheesecake with 
white and dark chocolate on a crust that tastes a little like crumbled oatmeal 
cookies. The tiramisu is an unusual model that will disappoint chocoholics, 
though it's actually pretty good: mostly a fantastically deep layer of 
mascarpone (this tiramisu is served in a bowl, not on a plate) with chocolate 
shavings on top and some ladyfingers way down at the bottom, soaked with 
anisette. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, though, not bad for a plain little trattoria on Pico. 
</P>
<P>
Bellini's Trattoria, 12021 W. Pico Blvd., West Los Angeles; (213) 477-4057. 
Open for lunch Monday through Friday, for dinner Monday through Saturday. Full 
bar. Street parking. American Express, MasterCard and Visa accepted. Dinner for

FLEDGING SANTA CLARITA VALLEY ARTS COUNCIL NEEDS MONEY TO REACH GOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Civic arts groups have long graced such communities as Moorpark and Thousand 
Oaks. Last fall, Simi Valley got its own professional theater troupe. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Santa Clarita Valley has its own arts council, a new organization that 
aspires to promote music, dance and theater in such communities as Newhall, 
Valencia and Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
"People have realized that there is a place and a need in our lives for 
cultural events," said David Bozman, an engineer who is co-chairman of the 
fledgling organization. "People said, 'Let's go ahead and do it. The time is 
now.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clarita Valley Arts Council's long-range goals will be to arrange for 
regular arts performances in the valley and to help the city of Santa Clarita 
raise money for a performing arts center, Bozman said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clarita's recent cityhood inspired several residents to form the group. A 
little more than a month ago, flyers were sent throughout the valley to attract 
anyone interested in forming an arts council. More than 50 people attended the 
first meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Council members now are wrestling with such immediate duties as drafting bylaws 
and electing a board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Once those tasks are taken care of, the council hopes to begin some small 
fund-raising efforts and organize a summer concert series that would showcase 
local talent. The group said it has already booked the San Francisco Opera 
Company to perform "Carmen" at William S. Hart High School for one night in 
March, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big deal for us," said Carmen Sarro, a Santa Clarita City Council aide 
and arts council member. "Now all we have to do is come up with the money for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The council also has committed to offering the Nutcracker Ballet at the high 
school in December. 
</P>
<P>
The next meeting of the Santa Clarita Valley Arts Council will be at 7 p.m. on 
May 8 in the student dining hall of The Master's College, 21726 Placerita 
Canyon Road, Newhall.

<P>
THE JOFFREY ON CHANNEL 28 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Invaluable but congenitally uneven, the PBS "Dance in America" series sometimes 
meticulously preserves the form and content of stage choreography and sometimes 
trashes it with disorienting camera work and incoherent editing. The newest 
episode, "A Night at the Joffrey," includes samples of both extremes. 
</P>
<P>
Studio-taped in Denmark, the hour-long telecast is scheduled for 9 p.m. tonight 
on Channels 28, 15 and 24; Saturday at 9 p.m. on Channel 50. 
</P>
<P>
Frederick Ashton's serene trio "Monotones II" (1965, music by Satie) and Gerald 
Arpino's elegiac septet "Round of Angels" (1983, music by Mahler) are each 
lovingly transcribed for television with astute camera placements, long 
(unbroken) takes and near-perfect transitions between shots. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, William Forsythe's bitter, abrasive "Love Songs" (1979, set to pop 
ballads sung by Aretha Franklin and Dionne Warwick) is flayed alive. Sometimes 
the camera is so close, the dancers seem about to be bludgeoned by the lens -- 
and what they do is often cut into snippets that don't connect. The opening 
section has even been photographically reprocessed to make the movement look 
jerky and unnatural. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, Forysthe himself was responsible for these innovations -- plus 
adding loads of dancers, furniture and dramatic action to the work that aren't 
in the stage version. There's also a new ending -- with clips from the previous 
sections -- that's MTV to the max. 
</P>
<P>
The dancers look splendid through every challenge, of course, especially Leslie 
Carothers in the Forsythe and Arpino ballets and Beatriz Rodriguez in a "Love 
Songs" duet. Incidentally, the program forthrightly treats the Joffrey as a New 
York company, ignoring the illusion of bicoastalism that continues to linger 
locally and nowhere else. Thomas Grimm directed the dance sequences, Judy 
Kinberg the helpful choreographer interviews.LEWIS SEGAL

AT THE GALLERIES /DAVID LEWINSON: THE SIEGFRIED LINE: IT FAILED FIRST IN WAR 
AND NOW AS A WORK OF ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Lewinson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1938, Adolf Hitler ordered the construction of a 400-mile long, 2 1/2-mile 
wide fortified rampart. Running from the Lowland countries to Germany's 
southern border with France, this Siegfried Line or Westwall, was intended to 
guard against invasion from the west. With plans already in mind to leapfrog 
over the older but equivalent structure in France, the Maginot Line, Hitler 
knew the uselessness of such defenses. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, 8 million tons of concrete, a million tons of iron and steel, and 
a million tons of wood were poured into the project, as was a lot of 
"volunteer" labor. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Westermann, a German-born New York based artist with interests in 
architecture and urban planning, responds to the phenomenon in her 
"Westwall/Crossing the Siegfried Line," an installation at the La Jolla Museum 
of Contemporary Art's token downtown space, located at 835 G Street. 
</P>
<P>
In the modest sized gallery, Westermann has arranged 104 concrete forms cast in 
a shape similar to one prong of the jacks that kids play with. These are 
aligned in rows that take up most of the floor except for an aisle through the 
middle rows and an area that transects the aisle at one end. These voids 
produce a cross; presumably the "cross" referred to in the show's title and, 
perhaps, a specifically Christian reference. 
</P>
<P>
At the far end of the gallery, atop a pedestal, is plaster mold that looks like 
you might get the form of a tree stump out of it, or maybe a foot and ankle. In 
fact, you get the concrete forms, but no added meaning. 
</P>
<P>
Less uncertain is a historic photograph mounted on the wall opposite the 
plaster element. It shows a couple of workers constructing the original wall. 
They carry a large, wooden form used to cast pyramid-shaped defenses against 
tanks. In the background are row upon row of pyramids, stretching to the 
horizon. The bland documentary character of the image, with only these two 
people in it, does little more than hint at what must have been a very awesome 
earthwork, a Great Wall of Germany, as it were. In fact, it takes considerable 
effort to make the photo yield any sense of the impressiveness inherent in its 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
Westermann's installation only hints at impressiveness, too. The concrete forms 
soon look like large, gray Hershey kisses rather than reflections of stern 
military deterrents. Even hunkering down on the floor next to the outer row of 
forms, to try to enhance the perspective through a kind of dramatic close-up, 
leaves a sense that something is missing. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that the scale is wrong; too large to achieve the kind of 
explosive compression that a small model produces; too small to generate a 
feeling of resistance and mass. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of the crucifix in the arrangement of the concrete elements also 
seems weak. The behaviors that the artist is commenting upon -- whether 
manifested in the Siegfried Line, the Maginot Line, the Berlin Wall, or the 
Great Wall of China; even in the walls that we build around ourselves as 
psychological defenses -- reflect a sad but universal human reality that 
transcends particular religions. By injecting a purely Christian symbol into 
the work, Westermann draws attention away from this universal aspect and the 
work's ability to communicate suffers for it. 
</P>
<P>
This exhibition remains on view through July 9. For more information, call 
454-3541. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, across the street, and offered by a very different kind of 
institution, is an exhibition of new photographs by Walter Cotton. The place is 
Java, a coffeehouse which has become the hub of downtown San Diego's modest but 
tenacious avant-garde art scene. Thus, it's an institution of a sort, and a 
valuable one. The nine Ektacolor photographs on view in a quiet back room 
reveal Cotton's new and on-going exploration of interfaces between photography 
and painting. The results are attractive and provocative. 
</P>
<P>
Cotton draws his imagery not from the "real world" that constitutes 
photography's habitual domain; instead he creates sparse compositions of forms 
in his studio and photographs these. He paints the floor and the walls, 
producing apparent spatial divisions by abutting contrasting light and dark 
shades. In this, he is a painter. He then places within this environment few 
items that might also be painted. These include tools, chunks of metal, wood 
blocks, shelves, folding screens, strips of white and black tape, and parts of 
dolls. Here, he acts as an installation artist, or sculptor. 
</P>
<P>
The photography that is the final outcome of Cotton's activity strikes the eye 
as marvelously rich and subtle. His manipulations in the studio produce images 
of a flattened space more suggestive of painting than of photography; while the 
spareness of details and their distribution across the scene framed by the 
camera produce compositional effects most readily associated with two 
dimensional design. 
</P>
<P>
The works' expressive qualities engage the focused serenity of minimalism, with 
an added twist of mystery that is a delightful consequence of Cotton's 
confounding of expectations concerning what one sees in what media. 
</P>
<P>
This is smart work that's very alert to the operations and ideas of 
photography, of art, and of the two in combination. His response to these 
achieves formal and expressive results very much worth looking at. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition continues at Java, 837 G Street, through May 26. For more 
information, call 235-4012.

JUSTICES SHARPLY LIMIT EMOTIONAL DISTRESS SUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Supreme Court sharply limited emotional distress suits Thursday, 
ruling over a harsh dissent that a mother who did not actually see her child 
hit by a car cannot collect money damages. 
</P>
<P>
The court by a 5-2 vote said direct family members can collect damages for 
emotional distress only if they actually witness an injury-producing event and 
suffer emotional distress "beyond that which would be anticipated in a 
disinterested witness." 
</P>
<P>
Writing for the majority in a closely watched case, Justice David N. Eagleson 
said he was seeking to draw a clear line to govern emotional distress suits in 
the future and avoid "limitless liability out of all proportion to the degree 
of the defendant's negligence." 
</P>
<P>
Eagleson reasoned that if the court had opted to allow emotional distress 
claims by family members who do not witness accidents, insurance companies 
would be unable to issue insurance policies without "imposing unacceptable 
costs" on their policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
"That relatives will have severe emotional distress is an unavoidable aspect of 
the human condition," Eagleson said. He was joined by the court's four other 
conservative members. 
</P>
<P>
"The emotional distress for which monetary damages may be recovered, however, 
ought not to be that form of acute emotional distress or the transient 
emotional reaction to the occasional gruesome or horrible incident to which 
every person may potentially be exposed in an industrial and sometimes violent 
society." 
</P>
<P>
The court went on to emphasize that unrelated friends or unmarried partners may 
not collect for emotional distress -- "regardless of the depth of feeling or 
the resultant physical or mental illness that results from witnessing violent 
events." 
</P>
<P>
Dissenting Justice Allen E. Broussard called the ruling "myopic," and said it 
"will deny recovery to victims whose injuries from the negligent acts of others 
are very real." 
</P>
<P>
Broussard said the majority's "arbitrary standard" will "lead to unjust 
results." Under the new rule, Broussard said, a mother could not sue even if 
she saw "her 6-year-old son immediately after he was electrocuted, lying in a 
puddle of water in a dying state, gagging and choking." 
</P>
<P>
The decision overturned a Court of Appeal ruling in a San Diego case that would 
have allowed the mother, Maria E. Thing, to sue for emotional distress. She had 
been in her Lemon Grove home in December, 1980, when her daughter ran inside to 
say a car had run over her son, John. 
</P>
<P>
Thing rushed outside to find her son bleeding and unconscious. She thought he 
was dead. A Superior Court in San Diego dismissed the suit, finding that since 
she did not actually see the accident, she could not sue. 
</P>
<P>
The boy suffered a head injury and collected about $100,000 in a separate 
action against the motorist and his insurance company, according to the 
family's lawyer, Patrick F. O'Connor of El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
"This ruling restricts access to the courts for people who undeniably suffered 
harm from someone else's wrongdoing," O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that, when he told the family of the verdict, "They were disappointed, 
but realistic. I think they kind of expected it. I don't think he had held out 
a lot of hope for a success in the California Supereme Court." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor described the insurance company's argument as "baloney." 
</P>
<P>
"They make that argument every time there's a possibility they can get a court 
or a legislator to restrict injured victims' rights to access to the court." 
</P>
<P>
"What this means is a mom or a dad, who comes upon their injured child lying in 
the street 5 or 10 seconds after the accident, is arbitrarily cut off from 
access to the courts. Whereas if they were fortunate enough to be standing 
there when the child was hit, then they can sue." 
</P>
<P>
Marcelle E. Mihalla, the San Diego lawyer who represented motorist James V. La 
Chusa on behalf of the Automobile Club of Southern California, hailed the 
ruling, saying that "once you allow a plaintiff who wasn't at the scene to 
collect . . . the floodgate is opened." 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have reasonable limits to liability," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The case drew friend-of-the-court briefs from insurance companies that urged 
the tighter standard enunciated by the court on Thursday. The California Trial 
Lawyers Assn. argued for a looser standard. 
</P>
<P>
"The fear of a flood of lawsuits and claims of increased insurance rates has 
never been demonstrated to be true," said Douglas deVries, who wrote the trial 
lawyers' brief. 
</P>
<P>
"It's best left to a jury to decide whether the event really happened and the 
person really suffered the injury," DeVries said, adding that the ruling 
suggests that the court has a "distrust" of letting juries decide such issues. 
</P>
<P>
In the opinion, Eagleson criticized a landmark 1968 California Supreme Court 
ruling that allowed emotional distress suits by family members who saw, heard 
or in some other manner sensed an accident. It was the first ruling by a high 
court anywhere in the country that allowed such suits. 
</P>
<P>
Eagleson said the 1968 case, "like a pebble cast into the pond," created a 
proliferation of lawsuits and "ever-widening circles of liability" because of 
its "murky" standards. 
</P>
<P>
He went on to attack several emotional-distress opinions issued since the 1968 
case as evidence of the "expansive progression" of court decisions allowing 
emotional distress suits. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, a suit was allowed to proceed after a family member was told the 
circumstances of an accident. In another, a mother was allowed to sue because 
she may have mentally reconstructed the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Eagleson, citing confusion in the lower courts, said the high court was under 
an "obligation to create a clear rule under which liability may be determined."

WEEKENDER: CINCO DE MAYO FESTIVITIES WILL LIGHT UP THE SOUTH BAY FOR NEARLY A 
MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gerald Faris 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cinco de Mayo is a specific date on the calendar. But the South Bay will spend 
almost a month celebrating the Mexican patriotic holiday with free festivals, 
entertainment, dances, a parade and a luncheon scheduled over the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Kicking off local festivities this weekend, Wilmington and Carson expect big 
turnouts for fiestas marking the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862, in which 
outnumbered Mexican troops defeated a large force of French soldiers. Although 
the French dominated Mexico for several more years, the battle came to 
symbolize Mexican resistance to foreign intervention. 
</P>
<P>
If the first Cinco de Mayo was all about fighting, today's holiday is all about 
fun, with food, and singing and dancing that mingles traditional Mexican 
culture with Latin rock. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the people of the Harbor area to celebrate," said John Mendez, who 
heads the Wilmington Fiesta Committee sponsoring the celebration Saturday from 
11 a.m. to 10 p.m. at Wilmington's International Longshoremen's &amp; 
Warehousemen's Union hall at 231 West C St. 
</P>
<P>
Community organizations will operate food and game booths to raise funds. 
Headlining the entertainment will be Mariachi Los Camperos, which backed Linda 
Ronstadt on her "Canciones de Mi Padre" album. "They're like the Glenn Miller 
of mariachis," Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
Carson's 15th annual Cinco de Mayo celebration will be held Sunday from 11 a.m. 
to 6 p.m. at Carson Park, 21411 Orrick St. "It's a joyous afternoon, a 
celebration," said Park Director Dan Cisneros. "It's become a popular event and 
we get more than 2,000 people." 
</P>
<P>
This year's entertainment includes amateur boxing and, in the musical vein, 
Mexican recording artist Mari Jimenez, a Wilmington band called Chiyle, and the 
Grupo Xochitlan Folklorico Dancers from Carson. The colorfully costumed dancers 
keep the regional dances of Mexico alive, said Cisneros. "Kids don't understand 
it, so they try to expose them to this type of music and culture, explaining 
each dance in detail," he said. 
</P>

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SPORTS COURTS ORDINANCE PASSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Palos Verdes Estates has adopted an ordinance governing the construction of 
sports courts in the city. The measure, which bans court lights and requires 
that all fencing on court perimeters be screened from public view by plantings, 
becomes effective May 25. 
</P>
<P>
The new measure also stipulates that courts occupy no more than 25% of a lot 
and be at least 50 feet from an adjacent house. The ordinance applies to such 
facilities as tennis and racquetball courts. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1987, the City Council passed and let lapse a 30-day moratorium on 
construction of such courts.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COMPTON BLVD. TO BE RENAMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Compton Boulevard in Gardena will be renamed Marine Avenue by Nov. 1, in accord 
with a City Council vote on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The change will mean that the name Compton Boulevard will disappear from the 
area west of the Harbor Freeway, except for two sections that run through 
Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
Gardena officials approved the change following a mail survey of Compton 
Boulevard merchants, property owners and residents. The results of the survey 
showed 68.4% approved the change and 31.6% were against it. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Public Works Department estimated that the cost of changing streets 
signs along the city's two-mile stretch of Compton would be $1,855. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Lawndale, who had already approved renaming the street, have begun 
putting up Marine Avenue signs, but will mark major intersections with both 
names for several months. 
</P>
<P>
In Manhattan Beach, the street has been known as Marine Avenue since the early 
1900s. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne officials have discussed changing the name of the boulevard but have 
not done so. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's Gardena council meeting, 19 of 22 residents and business owners 
who addressed the council were in favor of the change, saying that Compton 
Boulevard "is neither a boulevard nor does it go to Compton." Residents also 
said the change would improve the street's image and make the name consistent 
with other South Bay cities. 
</P>
<P>
The Post Office will continue to deliver mail to Compton Boulevard in Gardena 
for at least a year after the name change becomes official in November, city 
officials said.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SURVEY PLANNED ON POOL CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group working to restore the run-down Roessler Pool in Malaga Cove is 
conducting a survey of Palos Verdes Estates residents to determine if there is 
support for running the city-owned pool as a membership club. 
</P>
<P>
The committee was appointed early last year by the City Council, which wanted 
to make the historic pool financially self-sustaining. The proposed Palos 
Verdes Beach and Athletic Club would be operated by a concessionaire through a 
lease with the city. The pool was built in 1929. 
</P>
<P>
An open house to promote the idea will be held Saturday from 10 a.m. to noon at 
the pool. 
</P>
<P>
The club would have two heated pools, a professionally staffed fitness center, 
barbecue and volleyball facilities and improved beach access. Family 
memberships -- including a $2,000 initiation fee and $50 monthly dues -- would 
cover the estimated $1.5-million in restoration and equipment costs, as well as 
operation costs, the group said.

SUCCESS HASN'T SPOILED PILOT'S COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY GONZALEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cathy Blankenship, softball coach at Banning High School, was giving a reporter 
statistics about her team. After relating impressive numbers, such as ace 
pitcher Kricket Kern's 0.82 earned-run average and shortstop Laura Espinoza's 
.491 batting average, Blankenship said: "It's no big deal, I just punch in the 
numbers, and the computer does everything." 
</P>
<P>
Well, Blankenship must be doing something. Her personable, easy-going style has 
her team in second place in the L.A. City Section's Pacific League with a 7-1 
record. Overall, the Pilots are 16-2 and one of the City's top five teams, 
according to Jerry Weiner of High School Sports America, who ranks girls 
softball. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its success, Banning has enjoyed media attention. On Monday the team 
appeared on Prime Ticket cable network in a high school feature segment. Last 
Thursday's game against San Pedro attracted many reporters and fans. 
Unfortunately it didn't attract umpires, forcing the game to be rescheduled to 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
"The media attention is nice, but it's inconsistent," Blankenship said. 
</P>
<P>
The attention may be new to Blankenship, but the success isn't. In 1982 she 
took a team of 17- to 21-year-olds to the Miss Softball America national 
championship. At Banning, where she first coached in 1978, she has consistently 
produced winners. She is also a health and sex education teacher at Banning. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the success is family related. Blankenship's husband, Marty, is the 
baseball coach at rival Carson High. 
</P>
<P>
Blankenship thinks her senior-dominated team is on its way to big things after 
losing in the second round of the playoffs last year to eventual champion and 
perennial powerhouse El Camino Real, currently ranked No. 1 in the City. 
Banning lost a 10-inning game to the top-ranked Lady Conquistadores, 3-2, in a 
preseason tournament, but Blankenship is confident of her team's chance in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot more enthusiasm and the willingness to play together this year," 
she said. "If one person doesn't shine, another will pick up the slack." 
</P>
<P>
Leading the way is pitcher Kern (13-1). As of Tuesday, she has pitched 75 
innings, given up eight earned runs and struck out 98. 
</P>
<P>
The Pilots lost Wednesday to San Pedro, last year's Pacific champs, 2-0. Both 
runs were unearned. Weiner says the Pilots will remain in the top five despite 
the loss. 
</P>
<P>
Before the loss, the Pilots were flying through the league. On Tuesday, Banning 
beat Narbonne, 13-2, at Dolphin Park. In the first inning the Pilots committed 
four errors, allowing one unearned run. 
</P>
<P>
"We hadn't played since spring break," Blankenship said at the time. "We're a 
little rusty." 
</P>
<P>
In the bottom half of their inning, the Pilots showed why they are one of the 
best teams in the City, taking the lead on aggressive base running. 
</P>
<P>
Claudia Delgadillo walked to lead off and immediately stole second. Two hits 
later, the bases were loaded, and the Narbonne catcher let a ball slip past 
her. As she retrieved it from five feet behind her, Delgadillo streaked toward 
home. The pitcher and catcher were surprised and the Pilot center fielder 
scored easily. Another wild pitch in the inning led to another Banning run. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I encourage them to be aggressive on he basepaths," said Blankenship. 
"Many times opponents don't have the most accurate arms." 
</P>
<P>
Blankenship says she will take the outs that go along with aggressive base 
running, but she is also constantly telling her players to "think out there." 
During practice, the Pilots work on sliding head-first and other offensive 
moves. 
</P>
<P>
When her players commit an error, Blankenship is bothered -- but not upset. She 
understands her players are only in high school. 
</P>
<P>
"She (Blankenship) helps us with softball, schoolwork, personal problems or 
whatever," Delgadillo said. "She's not just a coach." 
</P>
<P>
Blankenship's style is calm, under control. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen too many coaches yell; it just magnifies the play and makes the 
player feel worse," Blankenship said. "They know what they did wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Before the season is over, Banning has a chance to avenge its loss against San 
Pedro and probably against El Camino Real in the playoffs. But Blankenship has 
the whole thing in perspective. She says she doesn't want her players to 
remember her only for her winning teams. "I don't want them to say, 'She didn't 
give time to talk to me.' "

LOYOLA HEADS INTO CRUCIAL 2 WEEKS OF WCAC BASEBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alan Drooz 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The battle for the West Coast Athletic Conference baseball title has boiled 
down to a three-team race that will be decided in the next two weekends. 
</P>
<P>
"It comes down to who can win two series" is the way Loyola Marymount Coach 
Chris Smith sums it up. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola has won 12 straight conference games to move into the lead with a 14-1 
record. Right behind is Pepperdine at 13-3, then Santa Clara at 11-5. The four 
other WCAC teams have losing records. 
</P>
<P>
The disparity between the haves and have-nots in the WCAC is reflected in the 
national polls: Loyola's hot streak has swept the Lions to a No. 16 ranking in 
Collegiate Baseball and No. 17 in Baseball America. Pepperdine is rated 17th in 
Collegiate Baseball, Santa Clara 19th in Baseball America. 
</P>
<P>
This is where the fun starts: Loyola's final conference series are against 
Santa Clara this weekend -- starting today -- and Pepperdine next week. Santa 
Clara will close with its San Francisco Bay area rival, USF, the fourth-place 
team capable of playing the spoiler. Pepperdine plays host to USF this week. 
Loyola and Santa Clara play a single game at 2:30 p.m. today, a noon 
doubleheader Saturday and a 1 p.m. game Sunday, all at Loyola's Page Stadium. 
Pepperdine and USF play a similar series in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
"We're about where we'd like to be. We've taken care of business pretty well," 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
To this point, however, Loyola has beaten the teams it was expected to beat. 
"Realistically, the large job is ahead of us," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions, 32-18 overall, are 15-1 since early April and have turned on the 
offense. They lead the WCAC in hitting (.323), home runs (48) and runs batted 
in (345) and are hitting .342 in WCAC games. In individual statistics, catcher 
Miah Bradbury, coming off a .500 week, has taken the conference lead at .402 
and outfielder Travis Tarchione is fourth at .374. Third baseman Rick Allen 
leads in home runs (10) and RBIs (56). 
</P>
<P>
However, the WCAC's series format of four games in three days puts a premium on 
pitching, and Loyola may have to hit well against the league's two best 
pitching staffs to overcome its own pitching inconsistency. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions have gotten a lift lately from left-hander Steve Surico, who is 3-0 
in WCAC games after a slow start. Kalani Bush continues to lead the staff with 
a 10-2 mark. However, Smith virtually exhausted his staff last weekend in a 
four-game sweep of Nevada-Reno. 
</P>
<P>
The pitchers, including Bush, had a particularly rough day in Saturday's 
doubleheader. Smith made eight pitching changes and two hurlers had to work in 
both games as Loyola won each in its last at-bat. "I hate that. I hate having 
to be in that position," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions need to get some innings out of the starters against Santa Clara, 
which has an offense close to Loyola's in run production and power. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos, 35-16, who had an 11-game winning streak snapped Monday by St. 
Mary's, have one of the WCAC's leading hitters in second baseman Ed Giovanola 
at .393 and one of the top power hitters in catcher Troy Buckley (eight homers, 
50 RBIs). Outfielder Bruce Powers is hitting .397 in conference games. The 
Broncos, who have a team average of .311 overall and .339 in conference, have 
outscored Loyola, 390-386. 
</P>
<P>
If Santa Clara has an edge, however, it's the pitching combo of Greg Gohr, 
10-4, and reliever Larry Donahe, 7-0. Gohr is scheduled to start today. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine, 32-13, batting .307, doesn't score as much as the other two but has 
power -- 41 home runs -- and may have the best 1-2 pitching punch in Sean 
Casey, with seven victories including two shutouts, and Britt Craven, who is 
8-2 and leads the WCAC with 79 strikeouts. He has three straight complete-game 
victories. Also doing well is Wayne Helm, 4-3 with 73 strikeouts in 71 innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves have two of the WCAC's top hitters in Rick Hirtensteiner (.372) and 
Matt Howard (.358) and are easily the most aggressive running team with 100 
steals -- well ahead of Loyola and St. Mary's, who each have 71 steals. 
</P>
<P>
Said Smith: "These are pretty good teams. Realistically, the season comes down 
to these two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
College Notes 
</P>
<P>
Loyola catcher Miah Bradbury was named WCAC baseball Player of the Week. The 
junior had 10 hits in 20 at-bats. . . . One of Loyola's hottest hitters in its 
conference win streak is designated hitter Mark Grafitti, who has returned from 
an injury to bat .500 in WCAC games. In conference games only, Loyola has the 
top three batters -- Grafitti, Joe Ciccarella (.457) and Bradbury (.454). . . . 
Loyola freshman Joe Caruso has been the winning pitcher in three of the last 
four games. . . . Dominguez Hills pitcher Rick Davis is second among all U.S. 
collegians in strikeouts with 139 in 121.2 innings. With three more starts, he 
has a shot at the CCAA record of 170 set by Mark Wiley of Cal Poly Pomona in 
1971. . . . The Dominguez Hills golf team finished sixth overall against mostly 
Division I competition in the UCLA Invitational at Industry Hills. They beat 
Division II foe Cal State Northridge.

LOYOLA CHEERED AS 'THE BANK' RETURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Westhead and Loyola Marymount will be able to go to the Bank for one more 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's announcement by Hank (the Bank) Gathers that he would return for his 
final basketball season at Loyola, forgoing an early departure for the National 
Basketball Assn., drew a sigh of relief around campus and took the weight of 
several months of decision-grappling off Gathers' broad shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, who had to make a decision by May 13 to enter the NBA draft, made up 
his mind this week and called a press conference Thursday. With cameras 
whirring and reporters poised over notebooks, Gathers strode to a podium, took 
out prepared notes and slyly announced: 
</P>
<P>
"I've decided to give up basketball totally and go into boxing." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Gathers is at ease with his real decision: "I've decided to stay for 
my senior season. It would be difficult to leave. I truly have a love for the 
faculty, students, my teammates and the coaching staff." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-7 forward this year joined Xavier McDaniel as the only collegians to 
lead the country in both scoring (32.7) and rebounding (13.7). He consulted NBA 
officials and scouts as well as family and friends and said he was led to 
understand that he would have been a late first-round selection this year but 
that scouts question his shooting touch despite his prolific scoring. A final 
college season and work on his shooting, he hopes, will enhance his draft 
standing. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers said he consulted Lakers General Manager Jerry West and NBA scout Marty 
Blake, whose Court Report publication can greatly affect the NBA draft. Both 
applauded Gathers' decision to stay put. 
</P>
<P>
"He should stay in school," West said, adding that Gathers might not have been 
chosen in the first round. "People question his shot. Most people don't think 
he's 6-7. You've got to be excited by the fact he plays the game so darn hard 
and accomplishes so much. He'll have a chance to improve his skills the way 
they play (at Loyola)." 
</P>
<P>
Blake, contacted in his Atlanta office, said staying "is what I recommended 
both to him and the school. I think it's in his best interests. I think he will 
be a fine pro player, eventually. He's making a very smart decision." 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, who will be working on a degree in communications, is turning down a 
chance at quick money, a major consideration because his family lives in 
downtrodden north Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really in the game for money," Gathers said. "My family has been in 
poverty since I can remember. My mother's OK. One more year won't make much 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
Westhead said he will encourage Gathers to show an expanded perimeter game next 
season. He said he didn't directly advise Gathers to leave or stay but tried to 
give him the facts to weigh. 
</P>
<P>
The coach applauded what he felt was a mature decision. "That's the sign of a 
player who saw his career -- his life -- with some distance: 'There's the 
instant, and there's the better things if I wait.' I think his talents will now 
unfold closer to the maximum." 
</P>
<P>
There was another factor Gathers considered -- the return of Bo Kimble, his 
running partner since childhood. "It was a bit too early to close the curtains 
on the Hank and Bo show," Gathers said. "I don't think I want to give that up 
now. We've been through thick and thin together." 
</P>
<P>
Kimble, however, said he had little input in the decision. "We didn't talk that 
much at all. The few times I tried to bring it up, we couldn't see eye-to-eye," 
Kimble said. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers said that he leaned toward leaving until recently. Kimble tried to 
suggest he wasn't quite ready. "I'm pleased he's staying," Kimble said. "He'll 
keep the other teams honest. We can put together a dominating year." 
</P>
<P>
The return of the two Philadelphians gives Loyola an outstanding core of 
lettermen, including starters Jeff Fryer and Per Stumer and swingman Tom 
Peabody. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers has a busy schedule before next season. He's one of the top invitees to 
Colorado Springs for tryouts to the U.S. team for the World Games. He'll also 
play in his hometown Sonny Hill summer league, where he has honed much of his 
game. He also figures to make several trips to be photographed for various 
preseason All-American teams. Playboy magazine has tabbed him for its 10-man 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers said by next season he expects to lift his foul shooting accuracy to 
75% or better and to try his hand at three-pointers. "Why not?" Westhead joked. 
"Everyone else (at Loyola) does." 
</P>
<P>
Gathers is also eyeing a double-double that has never been accomplished 
collegiately -- leading the country in scoring and rebounding for two straight 
seasons.

"I want to show some people I can do things I didn't do last year," Gathers 
said. "My dreams have always been to play in the NBA, to help my family. I 
respect the opinion of Jerry West and Marty Blake, who feel I would truly 
enhance my image. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to come back and win another West Coast Athletic Conference title and 
try to get Loyola into the NCAAs. We have a nice schedule (including a game in 
Philadelphia) and I don't want to pass that up."

<P>
Clearly, this is one Bank with no fear of failure.

SAN DIEGUITO'S GOLD THROWS ONE-HITTER BUT LOSES TO VISTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID McKIBBEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is rare for a pitcher to throw a one-hitter and lose. It is also rare for a 
pitcher to strike out three batters in an inning and give up two runs. And is 
almost absurd for a high school baseball game to last just an hour and 40 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for San Dieguito, all three were part of Thursday's 2-0 loss at 
home to Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Vista improved to 6-1 in the Palomar League to stay a game behind first-place 
Mt. Carmel. San Dieguito dropped to 2-5 in league. 
</P>
<P>
San Dieguito pitcher Jeff Gold (3-5) was the unlucky loser, striking out seven 
and walking just two. The only hit he surrendered, a leadoff double in the 
third by Vista designated hitter Billy Rounsiter, did not even figure in the 
scoring. 
</P>
<P>
"Jeff just pitched a great game," San Dieguito Coach Darold Nogle said. "You 
know when you pitch a one-hitter and lose, you're going bad." 
</P>
<P>
Vista's John Land, who was beaten by Mt. Carmel, 8-0, in his last start, threw 
a four-hitter and raised his record to 4-1. He struck out five and walked one. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept under control today," Land said. "I kept it low and made them hit it on 
the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Just four San Dieguito players hit the ball in the air. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gold was at his best -- and had his most trouble -- in the first, 
when he allowed both runs. 
</P>
<P>
Vista's Scott Collins struck out to lead off but reached on a wild pitch in the 
dirt. Collins advanced to third when Brian Fleming's grounder was thrown into 
right field by third baseman Chad Newman. Fleming took second. 
</P>
<P>
Vista's Rodney DeLeon drove in the first run with a fly out to right, Fleming 
taking third. Fleming then scored on a passed ball by San Dieguito's Nate 
Fleck. Land and Ryan Tamburrino struck out to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
San Dieguito's most severe threat came in the second, three singles. But in 
between the first and the second was a double-play ball. In all, San Dieguito 
(10-10-1) left five runners on base. 
</P>
<P>
San Dieguito's Justin Machado had two of the Mustangs four hits. 
</P>
<P>
Vista Coach Butch Smith, whose team improved to 14-4-1, didn't seem to mind all 
the oddities. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll take them any way I can get them," he said. DAVID McKIBBEN

TRIBAL LEADERS COMPLAIN TO SENATE PANEL ABOUT LACK OF MONEY, URBAN INTRUSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H. G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An overflow crowd packed the Escondido City Council chambers Thursday as Indian 
leaders from throughout Southern California testified before a U. S. Senate 
committee about a host of problems besetting local tribes and their 
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii) chaired the hearing of the Select Committee on 
Indian Affairs and told the estimated audience of 250 that he is "aware of the 
sad and tragic history of Indians in California." 
</P>
<P>
Inouye began the hearing by reminding representatives of the various tribes 
about the hundreds of Indian treaties violated by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
"The history of Indians in the United States is not a bright chapter. . . . 
That is the history of the U. S. government," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some speakers blamed their tribes' problems on the muddled bureaucracy of the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs, but others addressed a variety of issues, including 
the shortage of money for reservation health programs and a disparity in 
federal funding for San Diego County tribes. 
</P>
<P>
Several speakers pointed out that larger tribes on the East Coast and in the 
Midwest receive a greater share of the funds. Inouye said he is aware of that 
and explained that the BIA believes the tribes are "too small" and refers to 
them as "tribalettes." 
</P>
<P>
He advised the local bands of Mission Indians to form a confederacy, much like 
the Iroquois, to lobby Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Fletcher, tribal administrator for the Rincon Indians, said it is the 
larger tribes that have the financial resources to hire attorneys and lobbyists 
to press Congress for more funds. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher, who lives on the Pachanga Reservation in Riverside County, was one of 
a handful of tribal leaders at the hearing who addressed the problem of urban 
encroachment on reservations. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't think about it. You don't see it. But we see the problem from the 
reservation, and it's getting worse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tribes want to work with the county and local planning commissions on 
development and density issues, Fletcher said. 
</P>
<P>
"Reservations have little or no input on development issues. . . . Our survival 
depends on our being able to work with the county and local governments on 
development issues." 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher cited as an example the new community of Rancho California, north of 
Temecula, where more than 6,000 housing units have been built next to the 
Pachanga Reservation. 
</P>
<P>
"The county sent us notices about the development," Fletcher said, "but nobody 
really asked for our input. . . . The tribes are concerned because developments 
often desecrate our burial grounds and other sacred sites."

ESCONDIDO TEENS ADMIT SETTING SCHOOL FIRES, DAMAGING CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four Escondido teen-agers pleaded guilty Thursday in Juvenile Court to a 
variety of charges in connection with four Escondido school fires that caused 
$1.2 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
The four youths were charged with participating in one or more of the fires on 
March 10 and 18. Three of the teen-agers were also charged with breaking into 
and vandalizing the Church of the Resurrection Feb. 18. 
</P>
<P>
One 17-year-old youth pleaded guilty to four counts of arson involving fires at 
Escondido High School, Orange Glen High School and Del Dios Middle School and 
to a break-in at the Church of the Resurrection, all in Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
Five other charges against him, involving burglary and vandalism, were 
dismissed by Hideo Chino, Juvenile Court judge pro tem, who set a May 10 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
A 16-year-old boy pleaded guilty to the same charges, and five other counts 
against him were dismissed. He will be sentenced May 19. 
</P>
<P>
Both teen-agers face maximum sentences of 10 years and eight months. 
</P>
<P>
A 16-year-old girl involved in two arsons pleaded guilty to two counts of 
setting fires at Orange Glen and Del Dios, and a 17-year-old boy pleaded guilty 
to one count of arson at Escondido High and one count of vandalism at the 
Catholic church, where, he admitted, he overturned several crosses. 
</P>
<P>
Two burglary charges were dismissed against each of the two during morning 
negotiations with Deputy Dist. Atty. Karen Walter. 
</P>
<P>
The girl faces a maximum sentence of seven years and four months in custody; 
the boy could be sentenced to six years, eight months. Both will be sentenced 
in Chino's court May 10. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the teen-agers were charged with involvement in arsons the night of 
March 18 in which classrooms at Del Dios and Orange Glen were severely damaged 
and a cafeteria/dramatic arts building at Escondido High was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Chino, in agreeing to dismiss some of the charges against the four, said he may 
take the dropped charges into account at sentencings next month when 
considering restitution due in the costly school fires.

CHARGES NOT EXPECTED IN ABDUCTION OF SECT FOLLOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Based on a telephone conversation, the San Diego Police Department believes 
that a 37-year-old member of the religious group Great Among the Nations does 
not intend to file charges against her parents or the four men who abducted her 
last week, an investigator in the case said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Jim Clain said police Detective David Morris spoke with Dina Geerlings on 
Thursday morning but authorities do not know Geerlings' whereabouts, nor have 
they spoken with her in person. 
</P>
<P>
Clain said that Geerlings' parents have told Morris she has been "successfully 
deprogrammed." 
</P>
<P>
Geerlings was abducted from a parking lot in the 8300 block of Vickers Street 
in Kearny Mesa on April 20, near a bookstore where she was employed. The men 
reportedly shoved her into a car after an altercation between the abductors and 
three women who are members of Great Among the Nations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Geerlings a Longtime Member 
</P>
<P>
The 17-member group claims to be a fundamental Bible study and evangelism 
ministry, although its critics say it is a cult. Geerlings is a longtime member 
of the organization, which now has headquarters in Coronado. She is the 10th 
member of the group to have been taken from it over the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
"David is confident that Geerlings is the one he talked to, and she says she 
doesn't want to prosecute," Clain said. "To some extent, this concerns us. It 
would be much nicer if we could talk to her face to face, so that we'd know 
everything was on the up and up. I wish we knew more. 
</P>
<P>
"If she doesn't want to prosecute, I guess we'll have to wait -- wait and see 
if there are further developments. We have no way of knowing if she was making 
these statements to us (while under duress). She says she's not being held 
against her will, but we really don't know. At this time, we'll have to be 
satisfied with the telephone account." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Does Not Know Whereabouts 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Altschul, the founder and pastor of the controversial group, said he 
does not know Geerlings' whereabouts or how to reach her on the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
"Her parents are coming down personally to speak to the police, but they will 
not tell the police where she is," Altschul said. "They're telling the police 
that she's seeking rehabilitation and that she's OK. I believe the police need 
to see her and want to see her. I find it curious that they aren't being 
allowed to see her." 
</P>
<P>
In a related case, the district attorney's office is prosecuting family members 
and two deprogrammers who are alleged to have kidnaped and falsely imprisoned 
last year Ginger Brown, who was released after four days and returned to the 
group.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: VALLEY CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A wrongful-death lawsuit was filed in Superior Court on Thursday against former 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Charles Van Dusen, who pleaded guilty last December to 
vehicular manslaughter in the Sept. 2 drunk-driving crash in Valley Center that 
killed an Escondido woman. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was filed by Patricia F. Hodges, the sister and estate 
administrator for Carol Benson, the 45-year-old schoolteacher killed when her 
vehicle was struck head-on by Van Dusen on Cole Grade Road. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the crash, Van Dusen's blood-alcohol level was measured at 0.18% 
by a breath analyzer and 0.20 by a blood test. A blood alcohol level of 0.10 is 
considered legally intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
Van Dusen, 37, who resigned as a prosecutor shortly after the accident, was 
sentenced to six years in state prison. The suit against him seeks unspecified 
damages on behalf of Benson's estate.

GOLDING, IN SHADOW OF HUSBAND'S ARREST, CURBS CAMPAIGN PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With her husband under indictment on money-laundering charges, San Diego County 
Supervisor Susan Golding said Thursday that she will not seek statewide office 
next year so that she will have time to "lend emotional and moral support" to 
her family. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that a statewide race is "emotionally draining and time-consuming under 
the best of circumstances," Golding said the charges facing her husband, La 
Jolla businessman Richard T. Silberman, "make it obvious this is not the right 
time" to campaign for the 1990 Republican nomination for lieutenant governor. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be able to divide my time and emotion between my job and my family," 
Golding said. "Running a statewide race would require me to be away from San 
Diego more than I want to be over the next year. This is the time when I want 
to be there for my husband and my family." 
</P>
<P>
Golding's decision came as no surprise in political circles. Since Silberman's 
April 7 arrest on charges that he laundered $300,000 that he thought came from 
Colombian drug traffickers, most political observers have expected Golding to 
end her flirtation with next year's campaign for lieutenant governor. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those same political activists, however, argue that Silberman's legal 
woes are not necessarily, as one consultant put it, "a terminal political 
disease for Golding." 
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing that point herself, the 43-year-old Golding said Thursday that she 
has not ruled out future races for other offices -- statewide or local -- or 
seeking reelection in 1992.

CUBS, HELD TO 3 HITS, STILL WALK AWAY WITH WIN OVER DODGERS, 1-0

<P>
The ultimate sign of respect for Eddie Murray became a double dare for Mike 
Marshall Thursday at Wrigley Field, the kind Marshall has been expecting from 
the first day of spring training. 
</P>
<P>
By twice ordering intentional walks to Murray -- the first in a scoreless game 
in the fourth inning, the second when he represented the potential winning run 
in the sixth -- Chicago Cub Manager Don Zimmer twice threw down the gauntlet to 
Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
But Marshall tapped out twice and the rest of the Dodgers were putty in the 
hands of Cub right-hander Greg Maddux, who emerged a 1-0 winner over Orel 
Hershiser on a day that the Cy Young Award winner permitted only three hits and 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
Two of those hits, however, were in succession, one a two-out single by Maddux 
in the fifth, the other a triple by Gary Varsho, a ballplayer moonlighting as a 
schoolteacher -- or is it the other way around? 
</P>
<P>
Don't ask Hershiser, whose computer was lacking its usual byte. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't even spell his name," said Hershiser, who won the only 1-0 games he 
was involved in last season -- they came in consecutive starts during his 
59-inning scoreless streak -- but couldn't avoid his second loss against three 
wins this season. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy gets his first RBI of the season, and he's hitting what, .167?" 
</P>
<P>
Not quite. Varsho, who was playing only because the Cubs' starting center 
fielder, Jerome Walton, pulled a hamstring in the third inning, entered the 
game batting .083. But Varsho, who spent the off-season as a student teacher in 
Wisconsin, jumped on a fat 2-and-0 fastball from Hershiser and launched a drive 
that bypassed right fielder Marshall in two directions, clearing Marshall's 
head on the way to the outfield wall, then blasting back past him on the carom. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a brick wall out there," Marshall reminded his questioners. "It 
rebounded off the wall at about 100 m.p.h." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't help that Wrigley Field was missing some of its usual charm. The ivy 
that normally blankets the bricks has yet to grow this spring. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been nice if the ivy had killed that hit," Hershiser said. "But 
the ivy's dead right now, or dormant." 
</P>
<P>
Until the last week, Murray's bat was as dormant as Wrigley Field's plant life. 
But with 11 hits in his last five games, including five for seven in the first 
two games here, both Dodger victories, Murray was clearly the most dangerous 
Dodger, one Zimmer decided was best artfully dodged. 
</P>
<P>
So, when Mickey Hatcher singled and Mike Davis singled him to third, then took 
second on the throw with one out in the fourth, Maddux issued his first free 
pass to Murray. Marshall, the next batter, was badly jammed and dribbled a 
roller to third, which Curtis Wilkerson turned into a force at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Scioscia followed with a sinking liner to left, but Varsho, who only moments 
before was waved in a few steps by Zimmer, made a diving catch to end the 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth, Hatcher was on second after singling and advancing on an infield 
out when Murray was walked again. This time, Marshall rolled out to short. 
</P>
<P>
"I said it in spring training, I've said it all along, they're going to make me 
beat them," said Marshall, who has three hits in his last 28 at-bats after an 
earlier 10-game hitting streak. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no different than when Pete (Guerrero) was here. Sometimes I'm going to 
come through, sometimes I won't. Today I swung at a bad pitch, a ball way 
inside. I just didn't come through. 
</P>
<P>
"Today (Zimmer) put the winning run on. If I double or we get back-to-back 
hits, you'd be asking him why he put the winning run on base. But he's a genius 
today." 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson's absence from the lineup for the second consecutive day helped, of 
course, to make Zimmer look all the wiser. 
</P>
<P>
"But Moose (Marshall) will get hot, too," Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said. "You 
put the winning run on like that, and one time you're going to get burned. 
Moose can swing that bat. He's not exactly chopped liver." 
</P>
<P>
While the hitters on both teams appeared to be easy pickings in this series -- 
in three games, they produced a total of nine runs -- the pitchers had a 
powerful ally in breezes that blew only plateward. 
</P>
<P>
"When the wind is blowing in like it did the whole series, this becomes a 
tremendous pitchers' park," said Dodger catcher Scioscia, who thought he had at 
least an extra-base hit when he hit a 3-and-1 pitch from Maddux after a two-out 
single by Marshall in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Even Maddux was thinking the worst. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the ball would wind up in the basket," he said, referring to the 
wire netting that juts above the outfield wall. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the ball blanched in the breeze short of the warning track and landed 
in the glove of Cub right fielder Andre Dawson. 
</P>
<P>
"Exciting game," said Hershiser, the sarcasm as intentional as the walks to 
Murray. "You should just be glad we got it over with under two hours (1 hour 55 
minutes). 
</P>
<P>
"I'll take that outing for the rest of the year -- except the final score." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, winners of two of three here and eight of their last 11, are on to 
St. Louis for three games before returning home next Monday night against 
Pittsburgh. . . . Third baseman Jeff Hamilton, who hasn't started since 
spraining his right ankle last Saturday, said he plans to test the ankle before 
the game tonight. If he can run the bases pain free, Hamilton said, he should 
be ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs, who have scored just 21 runs in their last 10 games, broke a 
four-game losing streak. They have won two of their last 11 games. . . . 
Defensive play of the game was recorded by Cub second baseman Ryne Sandberg, 
who backhanded Willie Randolph's grounder to the shortstop side of second and 
threw out Randolph on a two-bouncer to first.

The UC Santa Barbara Faculty Legislature voted 31 to 7 to require an ethnic 
studies course as part of the school's basic undergraduate education. The 
course will replace one of two American history and institutions classes now 
required. A vote on requiring two ethnic studies courses failed 13 to 31. The 
faculty group also voted to form a seven-member committee to implement the new 
ethnic studies requirement. One professor has vowed to force the issue to a 
mail ballot of the entire UCSB faculty. University rules require such a vote if 
25 or more faculty members sign a petition.

A spring snowstorm swept across the Rockies, dumping up to eight inches of 
heavy, wet snow in Montana, while winds and new snow created near blizzard 
conditions in parts of Wyoming. Heavy snow warnings were posted through today 
over the northern mountains of Wyoming, with up to a foot of snowfall expected 
by late today in the Laramie Range. Near Cheyenne, Wyo., about six inches of 
new snow combined with strong and gusty winds to create near blizzard 
conditions. In south-central Montana, eight inches of snow fell on Red Lodge, a 
ski resort community. Great Falls, Cut Bank, Helena, Butte, Bozeman and 
Livingston all had accumulations of two to four inches.

Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said he has moved back the timetable for 
resuming production of a scarce gas needed to make nuclear warheads. He assured 
Congress the delay would not weaken the national defense. Watkins said he hoped 
to restart production at the Savannah River reactors, near Aiken, S.C., early 
in 1990. The three reactors, which have been plagued by safety and technical 
flaws, are the nation's only source of tritium, a perishable, radioactive gas 
that boosts the explosive power of warheads. More retraining of reactor 
operators and a fuller assessment of other safety issues are needed before the 
plant can be allowed to resume operation.

A Food and Drug Administration chemist was charged with accepting cash payments 
from companies whose products need FDA approval, and a pharmaceutical executive 
was charged with giving an illegal gratuity to an FDA employee, federal 
prosecutors said. "These charges represent the first of what I expect to be a 
series of prosecutions against government employees, consultants and 
pharmaceutical concerns and their executives," U.S. Atty. Breckinridge Willcox 
said. The charges stemmed from an ongoing investigation of the FDA's Division 
of Generic Drugs in Rockville, Md., which is responsible for the review and 
approval of applications submitted by manufacturers seeking to market generic 
drugs.

Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), chairman of the House committee that 
investigated the Iran-Contra scandal in 1987, said that he will formally ask 
Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the Permanent Select 
Committee on Intelligence, to examine whether the White House withheld key 
documents from the congressional inquiry into the scandal. The Senate 
Intelligence Committee already has been asked to open a similar inquiry by 
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) and Sens. Daniel K. Inouye 
(D-Hawaii) and Warren B. Rudman (R-N.H.), chairman and vice chairman of the 
Senate Iran-Contra panel. Documents that had not been given to the 
congressional inquiry have been introduced at the trial of former Lt. Col. 
Oliver L. North, raising questions about how complete White House cooperation 
with the committees had been.

The State Lands Commission has banned plastic foam containers at food service 
stands within its jurisdiction and also ordered prepared food to be served in 
containers that decay within two years. Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, chairman of the 
commission, and state Controller Gray Davis, also a member, said plastic foam 
was being targeted because the manufacture of the materials is believed to be a 
contributor to global warming.

Seoul and seven other cities, and dissidents announced plans for weekend 
demonstrations in defiance of a government ban. Officials said two riot 
troopers were seriously injured in the industrial city of Changwon, where about 
10,000 striking workers fought police with rocks and firebombs, demanding 
freedom for jailed strike leaders. About 1,000 students in Kwangju clashed with 
police after a campus rally at which they burned effigies of President Roh Tae

JOYNER, HOWELL DELIVER AS ANGELS ROUT TIGERS, 10-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They used to be roommates, but through the first month of the 1989 baseball 
season, the only thing Jack Howell and Wally Joyner shared was a batting stroke 
that belonged on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
Entering Thursday night's game at Anaheim Stadium, Howell owned the American 
League's darkest hitting slump -- a .100 batting average, with just 6 hits and 
one run batted in in 60 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner, only a little warmer at .205, hadn't homered since last Sept. 1, a 
power outage totaling 182 regular-season at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Together, Howell and Joyner represented a major reason why the Angels, despite 
astonishingly good starting pitching, were only 11-10 and in fourth place in 
the AL West standings before their series finale against the Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
But in the Detroit pitching staff, Howell and Joyner finally found deliverance. 
Howell had a pair of run-scoring singles, Joyner struck a two-run home run and 
the Angels defeated Detroit, 10-3, before a crowd of 25,895. 
</P>
<P>
The hits were only three of 14 managed by the Angels -- everyone in the Angel 
lineup had at least one hit -- but these three were worthy of headlines. 
</P>
<P>
Howell was hitless in his previous 10 at-bats and had just three hits in 46 
at-bats (.065). He had struck out 15 times and hadn't driven in a run since 
April 15. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner, meanwhile, was nearing his second full month without a home run. After 
hitting 20 home runs in the first half of 1986 and 34 during 1987, Joyner had 
seen his home-run output slow to a drip. He hit only 13 last year and counting 
a homerless training camp, Joyner hadn't cleared the fences in 256 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
But by the fourth inning Thursday, Tiger pitcher Charles Hudson (0-1) was 
witness to the end of both droughts. 
</P>
<P>
In the second inning, Hudson yielded Howell's first RBI single and, in the 
fourth, he surrendered Joyner's two-run home run to right field. That erased 
the 3-0 lead Detroit has built on first-inning home runs by Lou Whitaker (with 
a runner on base) and Alan Trammell. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Howell delivered his second run-scoring single, in the seventh 
inning off Tiger reliever Ramon Pena, the Angels had scored their ninth of 10 
unanswered runs as they made a winner of Bert Blyleven for the third time in 
four decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven worked 7 1/3 innings after barely scraping his way out of the first. 
From the first inning on, Blyleven allowed Detroit only five more singles. 
</P>
<P>
Bob McClure pitched the final 2 2/3 innings for the Angels, limiting the Tigers 
to a ninth-inning single by Chris Brown. 
</P>
<P>
"Bert persevered," Angel Manager Doug Rader said. "He didn't have a real 
outstanding fastball early and tried to throw a couple by some people. That 
didn't work too well. 
</P>
<P>
"But he made some nice adjustments, some experienced mid-course corrections, 
and started locating the ball much better." 
</P>
<P>
Howell and Joyner also persevered -- and for Rader, that was the best news of 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to see Howell get a couple of hits," said Rader, who watched a 
three-week slump take virtually all the aggressiveness out of Howell's swing. 
"As soon as Jack lets the bat head go, he'll be fine." 
</P>
<P>
And Joyner? 
</P>
<P>
"The home run took away a burden . . . ," Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
That burden has recently been accompanied by boos at Anaheim Stadium, which 
only two years earlier was decorated with WALLY WORLD bed-sheet banners in the 
right-field bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
Such word-of-mouth reviews haven't gone unnoticed by Joyner. 
</P>
<P>
"I've recognized it," he said of the booing. "They can do what they want. I 
have to continue to work." 
</P>
<P>
Joyner cleared the air in the fourth inning by homering with Brian Downing on 
base, forging a 3-3 tie. An inning later, Claudell Washington, trying to hit 
behind Kent Anderson on first base, deposited another two-run home run into the 
right-field seats. 
</P>
<P>
"Nice hit-and-run," Rader noted. "It went 420 feet." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels added three more runs in the sixth inning, when they knocked Hudson 
out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner began the inning by reaching base on Tiger second baseman's Lou 
Whittaker's error, took third on a double by Lance Parrish and scored on a 
two-run double by Washington. Howell, who was intentionally walked before 
Washington, scored on a single by Johnny Ray. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels scored their ninth and 10th runs on Howell's second RBI single and a 
run-scoring single by Dante Bichette in the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 runs were two more than the Angels had scored in their previous five 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"The nature of offense is basically inconsistent," Rader said. "We have 
aggressive free swingers and we're going to go through some periods where we're 
not too efficient. 
</P>
<P>
"But when it really gets rolling, it looks like a pretty nice lineup." 
</P>
<P>
Particularly when Howell and Joyner return from the ranks of missing in action. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
While Dick Schofield is on the disabled list, his replacement, rookie Kent 
Anderson, continues to carve a niche for himself. Anderson's play at shortstop 
-- .308 batting average and only one error in nine games -- has been enough to 
make the Angel coaching staff reconsider its original plan of opening the 
season with Glenn Hoffman as the club's lone utility infielder. Another name to 
consider in the two-utilityman scenario, if and when, is Mark McLemore, who has 
been taking ground balls at third base for about a week. . . . Brian Downing 
left Thursday night's game after bruising his right knee while trying to 
stretch a single into a double in the fifth inning. Downing, out on the play, 
was replaced by Dante Bichette and is listed on a day-to-day basis.

LAKERS HAVE THAT SAME PLAYOFF SPARK; 
</P>
<P>
JOHNSON HAS 30 POINTS IN ROUT OF PORTLAND, 128-108 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Little, it seems, has changed. First-round playoff games are still about as 
dangerous for the Lakers as the morning shoot-arounds that precede them. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, maybe they are even less hazardous now. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday morning, a railing leading to the locker rooms in the Forum put up 
more resistance to onrushing Laker guard Michael Cooper than the Portland Trail 
Blazers did to the Lakers in Game 1 of the Western Conference quarterfinals 
Thursday night. Cooper required 21 stitches to close a gash on his forehead, 
but that was nothing compared to the way 
</P>
<P>
the Lakers tattooed the Trail Blazers in a 128-108 victory before a Forum crowd 
of 17,505 that has come to expect as much in playoffs past. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers have never lost a first-round playoff game since the five-game 
series was implemented in 1984. Their 16th consecutive first-round victory may 
not have been among their most dominant, but it certainly wasn't the struggle 
even some of the Lakers had predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Starting fast, finishing strong and using 30 points from Magic Johnson and 29 
from Byron Scott, the Lakers easily dispatched the Trail Blazers, just as they 
had done in all five regular-season games and 23 of these teams' last 24 
meetings in the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
But, cautious types that they are at this time of the season, the Lakers 
weren't about to say that the 20-point victory was reminiscent of previous 
first-round blowouts. 
</P>
<P>
"Portland is a tough team, not like some of our other (first-round opponents)," 
Coach Pat Riley said. "Give us credit. We came in prepared. When we get to the 
playoffs, we really step up our play a notch, and you saw that tonight. This 
blowout is nice, but we have to come out and do it again to maintain home-court 
advantage. . . . And they'll be back." 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers have to come back for Game 2 Sunday at the Forum. And, the 
way the Lakers systematically took Portland out of its strategy in Game 1 
certainly gives the Trail Blazers much room for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
Without question, the biggest reason for the Lakers' big victory was the lack 
of production by Portland's big men. 
</P>
<P>
Center Kevin Duckworth, harnessed by early foul trouble, fouled out late in the 
game with only five points and five rebounds in 21 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Johnson, Duckworth's main backup, had only five points and four rebounds. 
More effective was oft-injured 7-footer Sam Bowie, who had 15 points. But Bowie 
did most of his scoring from the perimeter, while the Lakers dominated the 
inside game. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers had a 48-39 rebounding advantage, and their defensive limited drives 
to the basket by Clyde Drexler and Jerome Kersey. Drexler still had 30 points 
and Kersey 24, but they could not compensate for little production inside. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Lakers were proficient in all aspects. Johnson, hobbled a little 
after bumping a knee, not only led the team in scoring but also had 16 assists 
and seven rebounds. Scott punched up his total by making five of six 
three-point attempts and 10 of 16 overall from the floor. 
</P>
<P>
But production from the Laker backcourt is nothing unusual. It was the 
dominating front-line play that made the difference. 
</P>
<P>
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar responded to the playoffs with one of his most effective 
games. Abdul-Jabbar scored 11 points and had eight rebounds but, more 
important, he played sound defense against Duckworth and drew the Portland 
center into foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to play them tough inside," Abdul-Jabbar said. "That's one of the 
keys. I think I had a hand in the game. I was more active on defense, clogging 
the middle. Kersey and Clyde are tough going to the hoop." 
</P>
<P>
When Abdul-Jabbar wasn't around to stop the Trail Blazers, Mychal Thompson 
stymied his former team. Thompson, who was a member of the Trail Blazers when 
the teams last met in the playoffs in 1985, made eight of 11 shots for 20 
points and had six rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Those big guys got in foul trouble early," Thompson said. "For them to win, 
their big guys have to be on." 
</P>
<P>
Drexler did the best he could. He made 14 of 27 shots and had nine assists. And 
he received help from Kersey, who outscored Laker small forward James Worthy, 
24-17. 
</P>
<P>
But the Lakers' tough defense translated into easy baskets via the fast break. 
When the Lakers went to their half-court offense, they still shot well, making 
55% overall. 
</P>
<P>
Just as they did in the first half, the Lakers had a double-figure lead midway 
into the third quarter before a Trail Blazer run cut it to 75-70 after a basket 
by Drexler with 5:39 left. 
</P>
<P>
But then Duckworth was called for his fifth foul and left the game, and the 
Lakers put away Portland with a 20-6 run in the final five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the surge were two Johnson free throws coming after technical fouls 
were called on Portland Coach Rick Adelman and Kersey in a span of less than a 
minute. Both were upset over a perceived inequity in fouls between the teams. 
</P>
<P>
So frustrated were the Trail Blazers after one technical foul that assistant 
coach Maurice Lucas, a former Laker, grabbed Cooper's ankle as he was 
inbounding the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper shook free, as did the Lakers. They led, 95-76, entering the fourth 
quarter and extended it to as many as 22 points on Scott's three-point shot to 
open the final quarter. Portland was not heard from again. 
</P>
<P>
Portland did not begrudge the Lakers the victory, but was upset by the 
officiating. The Trail Blazers had 26 fouls, the Lakers 22. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time we'd get within striking distance," Drexler said, "there would be a 
handful of calls that could have gone either way. The Lakers seem to have 
gotten all those calls. They are a good enough team already. They don't need to 
be getting all the close calls." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, on the other hand, credited their third-quarter surge to tough 
defense and their offensive execution. 
</P>
<P>
"We were standing around, but when I came in, we picked up the pace," said 
Thompson, who had seven points in the surge. "We have to win this series 
because I spend my summers up (in Portland) . . . and I'd have to hear it from 
those guys all summer." 
</P>
<P>
Based solely on Thursday night's game, and on the Lakers' first-round history, 
Thompson should have no worries. 
</P>
<P>
But the Lakers still are cautious. 
</P>
<P>
"Sunday will be a tougher game," Magic Johnson said. "They'll be more ready." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Robert Kerlan, the Lakers' physician, examined reserve center Mark McNamara's 
sprained right ankle before Thursday's game. Laker trainer Gary Vitti said that 
McNamara is on schedule to return in another two weeks. "I think we'll get him 
back by (the second round of the playoffs)," Vitti said. McNamara has yet to 
run on the ankle. He is undergoing electronic stimulation and ultrasound 
therapy and rides and exercise bicycle to try to maintain fitness.

A KINDER, GENTLER BARKLEY HEADS INTO NBA PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WILLIS, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PHILADELPHIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Listen to Charles Barkley talk and it seems he would rather be playing for the 
New York Knicks than the Philadelphia 76ers, two teams that are playing in a 
first-round best-of-five NBA playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
"They play the way I'd like to play one day," Barkley said of the Knicks when 
it became apparent the two teams would tangle in the first round of the NBA 
playoffs. "I like their style where you have a lot of talent and you just run 
and gun. I wouldn't want to trap as much as they do. But I'm a firm believer 
in, 'Hey, let's just go out and run-and-gun and have fun and enjoy the game.' " 
</P>
<P>
Of Knicks Coach Rick Pitino, Barkley said, "I like him a lot. He's like (76ers 
coaches) Jimmy Lynam and Fred Carter. Those are the kind of guys you can go to 
war with. Those are the kind of guys you can go out and have a beer with, and 
if a guy starts a fight with you, you know you aren't by yourself. I respect 
guys like that a lot, and I'm very selective as to whom I have a lot of respect 
for." 
</P>
<P>
Kind words coming from someone considered among the most relentless and 
intimidating players in the NBA. Then again, this has been a kinder, gentler 
season for Barkley. It's been far different from the 1987-88 campaign, when he 
often played on the brink of explosion, received 30 technical fouls for salty 
language and publicly ridiculed his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
These days, Barkley can flatter foes because he's happy with his environment, 
happy with his teammates and happy with his life. "He's really what I'd call a 
teddy bear," said rookie guard Scott Brooks, who lived with Barkley for the 
first three weeks of the season. "On the court he's a monster, a big, macho 
tough guy who's a dominating player. But off the court he's as kind as any 
other person." 
</P>
<P>
The same couldn't be said several months ago when Barkley was enduring his most 
troubling off-season since turning pro in 1984. Though Barkley ranked among the 
top six in scoring (28.3), rebounding (11.9) and field-goal percentage (.587) 
in 1987-88, the 76ers tumbled to a 36-46 record. It was the club's fewest 
victories since 1974-75 and ended a streak of playoff appearances that began in 
1975-76. 
</P>
<P>
A frustrated Barkley became vocal about the lack of supporting talent on the 
club, calling some of his teammates "wimps, whiners and complainers." 
</P>
<P>
He started another fire during the playoffs when he told a national TV audience 
that he expected to be traded to the Clippers. The 76ers admit there were some 
preliminary discussions, but nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
Things got more troublesome Aug. 17 when Barkley was arrested in New Jersey for 
illegal possession of a loaded handgun. A state trooper spotted the gun when 
she searched his black 1988 Porsche after pulling him over for speeding on the 
Atlantic City Expressway. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley, who contends the incident was overblown, had a permit to carry the gun 
in Pennsylvania but not in New Jersey. He was released on his own recognizance, 
and the charges were eventually dropped Sept. 19 when a judge ruled that the 
car had been searched illegally. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the problem with his finances. Barkley ordered an audit of his 
investments after two Newsday articles last April linked his agent, Lance Jay 
Luchnick of San Antonio, Texas, to payments to high school and college coaches. 
Reportedly, $200,000 of Barkley's money is unaccounted for, and he is in the 
process of switching agents. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a nightmare," Barkley said of the incidents. "I had three devastating 
things happen. I had an audit of my investments, I heard the rumors about me 
being traded to the Clippers, and I had the thing with the gun. With all three 
I was really distressed." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever bad memories existed at the beginning of the season have been replaced 
with the pleasure he's gotten from watching his team develop into a 46-36 
playoff qualifier. The acquisition of forward Ron Anderson from Indiana and the 
emergence of rookie Hersey Hawkins have helped take some pressure off Barkley, 
who has become adept at drawing a double team and passing to the open man. 
</P>
<P>
"It was brutal on me last year, trying to score 30 points and get 15 rebounds a 
night," he said. "That's impossible. Five or six times I played the entire 
game. It was like going to war with a BB gun. This year, we've got better 
players who can produce." 
</P>
<P>
It's almost a given that Barkley will produce. His numbers this year are worthy 
of MVP consideration. He was eighth in the league in scoring with a 25.8 
average, tied for second in rebounding (12.5) and second in field-goal 
percentage at .579. All this from a guy who at 6-5, 245 pounds is considered 
undersized for a power forward, despite his tree-trunk legs and vise-like 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
He's just 26, but the constant pounding underneath the glass is taking its 
toll. "I haven't played as well as I would have liked to because of the nagging 
injuries," said Barkley, whose back has bothered him for most of the season. "I 
feel like for the first time in my life, I'm going to have to do something to 
restructure my body. I think I'm going to have to start lifting weights and 
maybe play at 235 (pounds) next year. These guys are getting stronger and I'm 
getting older. I used to get by them with quickness. But now they're so strong, 
it takes away from me sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
Barkley's stats speak for themselves, but his value to the 76ers extends beyond 
what he does on the court. He leads his team by example. 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie doesn't miss practices and he doesn't miss games and he doesn't miss 
flights," Carter, an assistant coach, said. "So from those intangibles, that's 
positive leadership. Some so-called superstars miss flights or they say they 
can't play today because 'my ankle hurts' or 'my toenail hurts.' But Charlie's 
here every night. Sometimes he's not as spectacular as always, but he's there, 
and that's important." 
</P>
<P>
One appointment Barkley is hoping to keep is to be at his wife's side when she 
gives birth to their first child. The baby is due within the next seven days 
and Barkley hopes the arrival won't conflict with a playoff game. "Hopefully, 
things will work out," said Barkley, who has added Lamaze classes to his busy 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife, Maureen, were married in a private ceremony Feb. 9 during the 
All-Star break. Though he's anxious about the pregnancy -- there have been at 
least two false alarms, he said -- Barkley has tried not to let it affect his 
game. "Those things happen," he said. "I still have to play well." 
</P>
<P>
His $13 million contract runs through 1993-94, and Barkley plans to retire when 
it expires. Before he leaves, he'd like to earn a championship ring. To do 
that, he says, the club needs to add a true power forward to give him more 
freedom to operate along the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't mean he's conceding anything to the Knicks, a team he's 
averaged 30.8 points and 11.3 rebounds against in their six meetings this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a great series and I'm excited for it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then he paused for a moment to imagine the raucous atmosphere, boos and taunts 
that will greet him at the Garden. "In New York on a Thursday night. I'd better 
get my bullet-proof vest ready," he said, smiling slyly. "This is going to be 
fun."

PROSPECTORS GAMBLE SCORES SPEEDY VICTORY IN $40,000 HOLLYWOOD PARK SPRINT 
FEATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prospectors Gamble, ridden by Robbie Davis, was never seriously challenged as 
he handily won the $40,000 feature race Thursday by three-quarters of a length 
at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Frost Free, ridden by Laffit Pincay Jr., finished second 6 1/2 lengths in front 
of Hermes, with Eddie Delahoussaye, in a field of six in the race for 
4-year-olds and up. 
</P>
<P>
Prospectors Gamble covered six furlongs in a fast 1:08 4/5 and earned $22,000 
for the victory, raising his career earnings to $287,525. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second victory in five starts for the roan son of Crafty Prospector, 
and he paid $5.40, $2.60 and $2.40. Frost Free returned $2.40 and $2.20, and 
Hermes paid $3 to show. 
</P>
<P>
Prospectors Gamble shot out of the gate and was clear early to take the win. 
Frost Free, who lost for the first time in four starts, stayed close to the 
winner but did not challenge in the closing yards. 
</P>
<P>
Hermes was outrun early and lacked the needed late response.

NEWSWIRE: JUDGE DROPS OUT OF CASE INVOLVING ROSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge disqualified himself Thursday from a case involving an Ohio 
bookmaker linked to Pete Rose, one day after law professors said he should step 
down for remarks defending the Cincinnati Reds manager. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Carl B. Rubin of Cincinnati filed a one-sentence order with 
the court clerk, taking himself off the case of Ronald Peters, who said he took 
bets from Rose. 
</P>
<P>
Linda D. Kloth, chief administrator of federal court in Cincinnati, said Rubin 
removed himself from the case because "he just felt there was an appearance of 
impropriety." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, five law school professors criticized Rubin, who last Friday said 
baseball Commissioner Bart Giamatti was engaging in a vendetta against Rose.

PURTZER BIRDIES FINAL HOLE TO TIE GLASSON AT LAS VEGAS

<P>
Tom Purtzer birdied his final hole for a six-under-par 66 Thursday and tied 
Billy Glasson for the second-round lead in the five-day, $1.25-million Las 
Vegas Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
Purtzer played the Las Vegas Country Club, one of three desert resort courses 
used for the first three rounds of this 90-hole tournament, and finished 36 
holes of play with a 132. 
</P>
<P>
Glasson, who won the Doral tournament in February and was one of four players 
tied for the first-round lead, also was 12 under after a 67 at the Desert Inn. 
</P>
<P>
Gil Morgan and Scott Hoch, a playoff loser in the Masters earlier this month, 
were at 133. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan birdied six of his first eight holes at Las Vegas and went on to a 
nine-under-par 63, the best round of the tournament. Hoch had a 64 at Spanish 
Trail and said it could have been better. The man who missed a two-foot putt 
that would have won the Masters, missed two Thursday from less than four feet. 
</P>
<P>
The teams of Al Geiberger and Harold Henning and Bob Charles and Bruce Devlin 
each shot nine-under-par 61s to share the first-round lead in the $650,000 
Legends of Golf tournament at Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner Dickinson and Dave Hill were one stroke back in the two-man, 
better-ball event over the 6,367-yard Onion Creek Club course. 
</P>
<P>
The Legendary Champions division for players over 60 was led by George Bayer 
and Kel Nagle and Bob Goalby and Sam Snead, each at 64. Snead, 76, injured his 
back during the round, in which he had two of the team's birdies. A doctor 
examined Snead immediately after the round, and Senior PGA Tour officials said 
they expected him to continue.

Boxers need mandatory health and safety standards established through federal 
legislation to protect them from injury and exploitation in an industry unable 
to regulate itself, a congressional panel was told. 
</P>
<P>
"The sport has had more than 100 years to attempt self-regulation. The decision 
is in; boxing lost the decision," said Rep. Pat Williams (D-Mont.), co-sponsor 
of a bill to establish a nonprofit, Washington-based federal corporation to 
govern the sport. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the proposed United States Boxing Corp. and its 12-member board 
of directors would establish uniform regulations and assist states in 
implementing them; create a computerized national registry to track boxers, 
their records and injuries; and establish uniform minimum safety and health 
standards.

The International Olympic Committee's executive board agreed in principle to 
drop rhythmic gymnastics from the 1992 Games at Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
The final decision will be made after hearing from the Soviet Union's Yuri 
Titov, president of the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG), in an IOC 
session at San Juan, Puerto Rico, in August. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, the executive board agreed to add 21 events in eight 
sports for Barcelona. In addition, it increased the size of the women's singles 
tennis field from 32 to 64 players and agreed to retain the men's and women's 
50-meter freestyle in swimming. It also will consider increasing the number of 
teams in women's handball and volleyball.

<P>
CARDINALS' TERRY A HIT AT PLATE, A WINNER ON MOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pitcher Scott Terry of the St. Louis Cardinals, a former minor league 
outfielder, showed Thursday at St. Louis that he still feels comfortable at the 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
While winning his third consecutive decision, the 29-year-old right-hander went 
three for three, hitting a three-run homer, a double and a single as the 
Cardinals defeated the San Francisco Giants, 10-1. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always enjoyed hitting," said Terry, who was an everyday player in the 
Cincinnati Reds' organization for 3 1/2 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Terry lowered his earned-run average to 1.80, giving up eight hits in eight 
innings while striking out two and walking one, and raised his batting average 
to .231. 
</P>
<P>
Terry, who hit 12 home runs for Class-A Cedar Rapids in 1982, hit his first 
major league home run in the sixth inning off reliever Joe Price, clearing the 
414-foot mark in center field. Jose Oquendo and Tony Pena were on base at the 
time and gave the Cardinals a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
It caught Terry unprepared. 
</P>
<P>
"It really didn't dawn on me that I had homered until everyone in the dugout 
was calling, 'Curtain call! Curtain call!' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Terry emerged from the dugout to acknowledge the cheers of a crowd of 30,825. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt real funny and I didn't want to do it," he said. "It's the first time 
I've ever done it, and it'll probably be the last." 
</P>
<P>
Terry lost a shutout in the eighth when Will Clark singled with two out and 
scored on a double by Kevin Mitchell, who had three extra-base hits. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 8, Pittsburgh 1 -- Carmelo Martinez hit a grand slam and Ed Whitson 
allowed six hits over eight innings as the Padres completed a three-game sweep 
at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the Padres swept a three-game series at Pittsburgh was in August, 
1980.

SCENE OF CRIME; 
</P>
<P>
LAKERS' BIGGEST OBSTACLE CAME EARLY IN DAY, WHEN COOPER CRASHED THE BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Evidence was everywhere at the scene. The small clump of hair wedged in the 
wood, bent itself from the collision. The several drops of blood a few feet 
away in the hall, left behind as the wounded victim staggered for help. 
</P>
<P>
And there it was. The outline of Michael Cooper's body, or at least something 
that was supposed to pass for it, in chalk on the cement floor. For dramatic 
effect, "OUCH!" had been drawn inside the balloon-like drawing of the head. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an usher not an artist," Gary Kass said, reluctantly taking credit for the 
police-style sketch while guarding a door that leads to the locker rooms at the 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper is a Laker guard, not a '69 Chevy. So when he went mano-a-mano with a 
plywood-and-metal railing inside a tunnel that leads off the court, some damage 
could be expected. 
</P>
<P>
"A serious headache," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That may be the short-term effects. More serious are the 21 stitches he took in 
the front of his scalp. 
</P>
<P>
The Coop-a-Bloop that resulted in a pair of cuts on the front of his head and a 
trip to Centinela Hospital Medical Center occurred just after the Lakers' 
morning shoot-around at the Forum. He sprinted off the court, bound for the 
locker room, and, with the structure partially hidden by curtains, collided 
with it, head first. 
</P>
<P>
That he came back to get eight assists, four rebounds and three points in the 
Lakers' 128-108 victory over Portland in Game 1 of the Western Conference 
quarterfinals made him a candidate for some sort of Purple Heart. 
</P>
<P>
That he survived the accident also made him a target for teammate abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"We call him Scarface now," backup center Mychal Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Coach Pat Riley: "He did that on purpose. He wanted to let the guys know 
he was ready. He wanted some battle scars." 
</P>
<P>
He got them. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a little bit hard to concentrate on the court," said Cooper, who made 
one of two three-point shots to raise his National Basketball Assn. all-time 
playoff high from that range to 251 attempts and 101 baskets. "That hurt my 
head. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of a gruesome hit, but I had to do it. I had to shake the fear of 
charging into that end of the Forum, in case I had to go for a loose ball or 
something." 
</P>
<P>
Forget that the area in question was halfway down Century Boulevard toward LAX. 
</P>
<P>
"Coop feels a lot more comfortable when he's battered and bruised," said 
Thompson, who did some hard-hat work inside for 20 points, on eight-of-11 
shooting, and six rebounds in 27 minutes off the bench. "It gets him ornery and 
mean. He came to the Forum in a bad mood and took it out on the court. That's 
the way you have to be in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, in his 10th year of postseason play, only wishes the accident could 
have been staged for motivational purposes. Then he wouldn't have had those 
headaches and that awful feeling inside his gangly 6-foot-7 body. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, if only it could have been an arranged stunt. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kind of queasy for a while," said Cooper, who revisited the scene later 
and saw the hair he had left behind. "But I'm over it now. It's good to get the 
pain out of the way." 
</P>
<P>
And, for some people, Game 1. The Portland Trail Blazers knew all along who 
their competition was. 
</P>
<P>
But Michael Cooper, who found out the hard way what was behind curtain No. 2? 
</P>
<P>
He has met the enemy, and it is he.

CASEY MAY GET FRONT-OFFICE JOB WITH CLIPPERS

Don Casey will return from New Jersey today without getting the job to coach at 
Rider College but apparently in position to land a spot with the Clippers, 
albeit not the one he wants. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Rider, the 3,000-enrollment Division I school in Lawrenceville, 
N.J., have scheduled a news conference for today and are expected to name Kevin 
Bannon of Trenton State in New Jersey as the new coach. He replaces John 
Carpenter, who retired after 23 years but will remain as athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos went 5-23 last season while playing in the East Coast Conference. 
Bob Dukiet, the former coach at Marquette, had also interviewed for the spot. 
</P>
<P>
Casey, the Clippers' interim coach since Jan. 19, withdrew from consideration 
for the Rider job and will meet with team officials early next week. No member 
of Clipper management will comment publicly, but most seem to agree that he 
will be offered some position, even if not head coach, his first preference. 
</P>
<P>
There is a possibility that a front-office spot will be created for Casey that 
will keep him involved in the team's day-to-day operations. SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER

<P>
KERR, SMITH HELP FLYERS TIE SERIES WITH PENGUINS 
</P>

Tim Kerr and Derrick Smith each scored twice as the Philadelphia Flyers beat 
the Pittsburgh Penguins, 6-2, Thursday night and tied their Stanley Cup playoff 
series at three games apiece. 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers and Penguins meet Saturday night at Pittsburgh for the Patrick 
Division title. The winner advances to the Stanley Cup semifinals, beginning 
Monday night at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers, who shut down Pittsburgh star Mario Lemieux, scored two 
first-period goals, and twice answered after Pittsburgh came within a goal at 
2-1 and 3-2 in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers took a 2-0 first period lead on Kerr's 13th and 14th goals of the 
playoffs, including nine in this series. Kerr beat goalie Tom Barrasso high to 
the glove side from the top of the slot at 4:28 for a 1-0 lead. He took a pass 
from behind the net by Mike Bullard. 
</P>
<P>
Kerr's second goal came at 18:22 on a deflection of a shot by Mark Howe from 
just inside the blue line. 
</P>
<P>
The Penguins cut it to 2-1 at 2:18 of the second period on a power-play goal by 
Randy Cunneyworth. Cunneyworth followed his shot off the boards to beat Flyer 
goalie Ron Hextall, who misplayed it as he slipped to the ice at the side of 
the net. 
</P>
<P>
But the Flyers struck back 70 seconds later as Smith scored from the right of 
the crease. 
</P>
<P>
Less than two minutes later, at 5:24, the Penguins' Dan Quinn faked a shot and 
passed to Cunneyworth, who pushed it past Hextall's stick side to make it 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the Penguins got a bad break. Ron Sutter was credited with a goal at 8:40 
that made it 4-2. Actually, Sutter dumped the puck in front of the net to Brian 
Propp, and Pittsburgh's Rod Buskas tipped it in. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's second goal increased the lead to 5-2 with 59 seconds left in the 
second period. Smith put a shot between Barrasso's pads after taking a pass 
from behind the net by Scott Mellanby. 
</P>
<P>
Propp scored the Flyers' final goal, his 11th of the playoffs, with 64 seconds 
to play.

A GAY OFFICER'S LONELY PATROL; 
</P>
<P>
FORMER POLICEMAN MITCHELL GROBESON'S SUIT AGAINST LAPD RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT 
WHAT MAKES A GOOD COP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the summer of 1985, police officer Mitchell Grobeson responded to a silent 
alarm at a jewelry store on Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, black-and-whites would converge from all over the Rampart division to 
back up an officer answering a reported robbery in progress, Grobeson said. But 
that day, despite the dispatcher's repeated pleas, no one showed. 
</P>
<P>
At the Los Angeles Police Academy four years earlier, Grobeson's fellow cadets 
had elected him class president. Now he stood alone, crouched in the street 
behind his squad car with his shotgun aimed across the hood, wondering why an 
entire watch was disregarding the cardinal rule of police work: Back up your 
brother officer. 
</P>
<P>
At least that's how Grobeson tells the story, and he's been telling it often in 
the last few months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One of the Best 
</P>
<P>
Because of that and similar alleged incidents, Grobeson, by all objective 
criteria one of the best officers on the force, resigned from the Police 
Department on June 13, 1988. On Sept. 28, he filed a 22-claim lawsuit against 
the city of Los Angeles, Police Chief Daryl Gates, the Los Angeles Police 
Commission, 15 named police officers and 100 John Doe officers, charging that 
they effectively forced him to resign from the force because he was suspected 
of being homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
With the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and law enforcement agencies 
nationwide under pressure to recruit gay officers, Grobeson's story is stirring 
up considerable interest in the homosexual community. 
</P>
<P>
But his story goes beyond one group's concerns about the issue of how 
thoroughly a police agency represents the diversity of the community it 
protects; even those who don't believe his charges are likely to find 
themselves pondering more basic concerns, such as, "What makes a good police 
officer?" and "What makes a good police force?" 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department and Police Commission refer all questions about 
Grobeson's suit to the City Attorney's office. In its written response to what 
Grobeson said is the first suit of its kind, the office argued that his claims 
are unfounded or are stated so vaguely that a response requires more 
information. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me be frank," Deputy City Atty. Arthur Walsh said this week. "The city and 
the Police Department don't like this lawsuit. We don't have a policy of 
discrimination against people because of their sexual orientation -- as a 
matter of fact there are city laws and ordinances (mandating) directly the 
opposite. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think (Grobeson's claims of systematic harassment and endangerment) 
took place, and we'd like to do something to make Mr. Grobeson, who was a good 
cop, feel better about the treatment he received when he was a police officer. 
On the other hand, we're not about to give away millions of dollars of city 
money. 
</P>
<P>
". . . The city's position has been that we didn't do the things Mr. Grobeson 
said. If we did, if it can be established that there was an official policy, 
albeit a secret one, there will be some serious changes made throughout the 
Police Department and city government," Walsh said. ". . . If it turns out that 
individual members in fact acted inappropriately toward Mr. Grobeson or anyone 
else, disciplinary measures will be taken." 
</P>
<P>
Grobeson says he's heard that before. 
</P>
<P>
Ten months after he turned in his badge, Grobeson still looks and acts like a 
television cop. His posture exudes confidence. His voice projects authority -- 
even as he tells audiences that he still is being "harassed" by Police 
Department internal affairs investigators and that he fears his lawsuit may 
have put his life in danger. 
</P>
<P>
A moment later, though, he sounds more like a police recruiter than a 
dissident. 
</P>
<P>
Police officers, he says, are the only real altruists. 
</P>
<P>
"When it comes down to it, there's only one class of people that risk their 
lives to help others. . . . There's only one profession that truly saves lives. 
That's police work. 
</P>
<P>
"And LAPD," he maintains, "is the finest force in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Grobeson doesn't recall playing cops 'n' robbers much as a kid. But he did know 
early on that he wanted to help people, he said. When he got the chance at age 
15 to join the first Explorer Scout Law Enforcement unit in his hometown of 
Culver City, he signed up. 
</P>
<P>
Not that he was lacking in activities. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of broke all the records in high school," he said, rattling off an 
adolescent vita worth a million Brownie points. 
</P>
<P>
Twice he was elected student body president at Culver City High. He edited the 
school newspaper, wrestled on the junior varsity team, served on the YMCA 
board; he was appointed to a seat on the Culver City Board of Education; and he 
pressed for and received a student seat on the Culver City human relations 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
"I graduated with more honors than any other person," he said with his standard 
"just the facts, ma'am" delivery. 
</P>
<P>
At Chapman College, he earned a degree in criminal justice, graduating "with 
more honors than anyone -- at least with more honors than anyone I knew." 
</P>
<P>
His father drove a catering truck. His mother was an executive secretary, and 
Grobeson worked to help support himself from age 15 as a camp counselor, a meat 
cutter, a stock boy, a security guard at Bullock's, and an appliance salesman 
at J.C. Penney. 
</P>
<P>
Given that schedule, he never had time to socialize, let alone date; in 
retrospect, he thinks his hyper-achieving was in part a smoke screen to 
distract his peers -- and himself -- from his growing uncertainty about his 
sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
From age 8, Grobeson knew he was "physically and emotionally" attracted to men. 
It didn't take an anthropologist, though, to know such attractions were taboo. 
</P>
<P>
So Grobeson kept his feelings buried. 
</P>
<P>
For years, he figured they would go away. By high school, though, he began to 
suspect otherwise. So he worked even harder in other areas of his life. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 9, 1981, he arrived for his first day at the Police Academy with a new 
haircut and a new suit. Immediately, instructors ordered the cadets to drop to 
the floor and do push-ups for an hour. 
</P>
<P>
It bothered Grobeson that cadets "were treated like dirt," but he decided, "I'm 
going to beat them at their own game." And when he graduated as the "honor 
cadet," with the highest scores overall, Chief Gates shook his hand and 
presented him with awards in academics, physical fitness, self-defense and 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
To top things off, Grobeson put on the academy graduation dance at the 
California Yacht Club in Marina del Rey. "The guy who puts on the dance doesn't 
need to have a date," he said. 
</P>
<P>
No one suspected he was gay, and, in fact, "I didn't have any gay identity 
yet," he said. "So outside of being lonely, it wasn't awkward for me." 
</P>
<P>
Grobeson had his first sexual experience after he left the academy, he said. 
But there was nothing in the way he lived to draw attention to his sexuality, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave up my social life to be the best police officer I could. . . . I know 
you're supposed to have a life that's separate (from your work). I'm just not 
sure I did." 
</P>
<P>
Digging though a cardboard box filled with Lions Club and YMCA awards and 
stacks of documents about his career, Grobeson pulled out a letter of 
commendation from his probationary year in Central Division, which covers some 
of the city's meanest streets, from Skid Row to the corridors of City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Dated Jan. 24, 1983, the letter describes how he and another officer responded 
to a call about an assault with a deadly weapon in a downtown apartment. A man 
had gone on a rampage with a steak knife, slashing and stabbing his 5-year-old 
child and an infant. 
</P>
<P>
As his partner drove to the hospital, Grobeson placed his notebook on the 
baby's bloody chest and began two-finger CPR. According to the commendation, 
signed by a deputy chief, "throughout the Code Three run to the hospital, 
Grobeson cuddled the wounded child and continued artificial respiration." The 
child died at the hospital. But the letter commended both officers for their 
compassion. 
</P>
<P>
Like most new officers, Grobeson was unprepared for his sudden exposure to the 
full spectrum of human behavior. He sensed the protective layers of cynicism 
building. But an old training officer at Central showed him the wisdom in 
treating everyone "as if they were a member of your family," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That approach served Grobeson well. In late '84, he was promoted to training 
officer himself, and was to transfer to the Rampart Station, which oversees Los 
Angeles' Silver Lake district. 
</P>
<P>
Just before his transfer, he was stopped in West Hollywood by a Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's sergeant. Because he was with another man in a predominantly 
gay area, the sergeant assumed they were lovers, Grobeson said. 
</P>
<P>
Discovering a police ID, he immediately called the Police Department. Grobeson 
said he remembers the sergeant's message well: "Send a supervisor, your man's a 
fruit." 
</P>
<P>
In the next days, Grobeson charges in his suit, officer J. J. Williams at 
Pacific division called officers at Rampart and told them "a faggot" was 
transferring in. Sgt. Jake DeLeon then announced that accusation to the entire 
Rampart watch, Grobeson said -- charges that both officers deny in a response 
filed by the City Attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Grobeson said that when he arrived at Rampart, a supervisor took him aside in a 
police car and asked him if he were gay. Grobeson said no, to which the 
supervisor reportedly replied: "Good. Because there are two types of people who 
can't do the job -- gays and women. They're too emotional." 
</P>
<P>
"The macho mystique of cops has never appealed to me," Grobeson said. "I think 
it's probably the greatest problem that the Los Angeles Police Department has 
going against it. . . . If you're macho, you're not supposed to have feelings, 
and if you don't have feelings, you can't empathize -- with criminals, victims 
or the community you're hired to serve." 
</P>
<P>
Which is not to say that Grobeson doesn't have a Dirty Harry streak, as 
revealed when he recently spun his favorite war story -- with more than a touch 
of melodrama -- to a gay and lesbian student group at California State 
University, Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
A Latino gang called Aztlan had, in effect, been holding hostage an apartment 
building in Rampart division, he said. The gang was so brazen, its leaders 
placed a placard over the building and signed their names to it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Partners 
</P>
<P>
By then, Grobeson said, he was having a difficult time finding partners, so he 
took it upon himself to rout the gang. "Every day I'd go put a new one in jail, 
a new one in jail, until finally . . . I got the leader." 
</P>
<P>
He climbed a ladder and took down the sign. As he walked through the building 
courtyard, a mother with two young children stepped out of her apartment for 
"the first time ever," and thanked him: "Gracias, official." 
</P>
<P>
Even as that gang bust was unfolding, though, word continued to circulate among 
officers at the Rampart station that a homosexual was in their midst. Few 
suspected him at first, because they knew he was a sharpshooter, which would 
have been impossible for "someone with a limp wrist," he said sarcastically. 
</P>
<P>
But slowly the station house graffiti began to focus on Grobeson; it followed 
him as he was promoted and transferred to other stations. 
</P>
<P>
Someone glued his locker shut. Someone taped a picture of Rock Hudson to it, 
with the inscription "To Mitch -- Love, Rock Baby." He received a package 
marked "AIDS Survival Kit," and someone wrote "BEWARE" in the dust on his squad 
car. Moreover, Grobeson contends in his suit, several supervisors encouraged 
the harassment. 
</P>
<P>
His problems intensified in summer 1985, when he decided to break the legendary 
police "code of silence" after a confrontation between police and a crowd of 
revelers at an outdoor fair. 
</P>
<P>
An officer had clubbed unconscious a man involved in a fight, and a near-riot 
resulted, Grobeson said. He chose to testify to internal affairs investigators, 
he said, because he believes in telling the truth and because as an instructor 
in baton technique, he felt that the officer's repeated "head shots" could have 
killed the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
But the main reason he testified is because he watched the accused officer "get 
so caught up in his emotions, that he risked the lives of his fellow officers. 
The point wasn't to burn him. He endangered the lives of his fellow officers by 
turning the crowd on us. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"There are people who became police officers because they like bullying people, 
beating up on people," Grobeson said. "The good cops became cops because they 
care about people." 
</P>
<P>
But skewed notions of machismo have engendered a process for selecting law 
officers that systematically eliminates a whole segment of the population -- 
including some who are drawn to police work for all the right reasons, Grobeson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Department candidates, for instance, must take the Minnesota 
Multi-Phasic Personality Inventory test, which he and gay activists contend is 
designed to rate people on a scale of heterosexuality and homosexuality based 
on antiquated notions of masculinity and femininity. 
</P>
<P>
Grobeson took the test in college, and "I didn't come out as high as I would 
have liked in the masculine categories," he said. "Consequently, when I took it 
for the Police Department, when there came a question like, 'Do you want to be 
a florist?' I answered no. . . . Literally, the way they eliminate people who 
are homosexual is by eliminating people who want to be florists." 
</P>
<P>
When answers are suspicious or when candidates raise suspicions about sexual 
orientation during the background investigation, the department invariably 
finds an unrelated reason to reject them, Grobeson charges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Open Homosexuals 
</P>
<P>
The result, he said, is that there is not a single openly gay or lesbian 
officer among the 7,000 officers in Los Angeles department, nor is there one 
among the 20,000 peace officers in more than 100 Southern California agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"To the best of my knowledge . . there is not an openly gay (officer) on the 
force, and as a matter of sheer statistics, there certainly must be a 
significantly large number of them," said Walsh of the City Attorney's office. 
"Why they choose not to be open is another matter. Whether it is because of 
fear of the treatment they would receive, as Mr. Grobeson seems to think, or 
simply because they wish to keep it as part of their personal life and not 
advertise it, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Grobeson said gays and lesbians hide their identities for one reason: "They 
live in absolute fear for their lives and careers." And anyone who is found 
out, he said, is driven from the force. 
</P>
<P>
He decided that wouldn't happen to him. But things "got worse and worse every 
day." At one station, officers posted his photo with the caption: "Would you 
buy a used (sexual device) from this man?" Someone put up a sign reading 
"Faggot Get Out!" at another, he said. And more than once he found himself 
chasing bad guys with the supposed good guys refusing to back him up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, "I considered eating my gun," he said. But finally, "I decided 
this is completely wrong, and started documenting the harassment." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Grobeson transferred back to the Pacific division, where he was put in 
charge of a controversial effort to address the Venice Beach homeless problem. 
As the situation improved, Grobeson began showing up on national telecasts and 
in newspaper stories. Commendations and more than 100 citizen letters poured 
in. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, lawyer Stephen Yagman, the police gadfly who recently won a 
judgment against Chief Gates, witnessed an arrest Grobeson and other officers 
made on the Venice boardwalk and wrote a rare letter of praise. The letter is 
in Grobeson's file, with a note from Gates: "You have impressed the 
unimpressible." 
</P>
<P>
But even as the praise rolled in, Grobeson alleges, several officers, 
encouraged by supervisors, stepped up efforts to undermine his "perfect 
package." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, a habitue of the Venice Beach drug scene filed a complaint against 
him. A letter signed by Capt. Vance Proctor states that on Nov. 12, 1987, 
Grobeson "failed to take appropriate action" in detaining the suspect and he 
caused him "to partially disrobe." 
</P>
<P>
Grobeson denied the charges and demanded that the case go to a trial board. At 
the trial, his accuser testified under oath that eight officers had told him 
Grobeson was "a faggot," and that he was granted preferential treatment for 
filing the complaint, Grobeson said. 
</P>
<P>
Acquitted, Grobeson asked the trial board to investigate the officers who 
allegedly had solicited false testimony. The investigation never occurred, and 
evidence was destroyed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
On June 13, 1988, Grobeson turned in his resignation and a complaint demanding 
that Lt. Al Corella be investigated and punished for allegedly asking officers 
to solicit complaints against him; for following Grobeson when he was off duty, 
and for repeatedly taking him into an interrogation room and grilling him about 
his sexuality -- charges Corella has denied in a formal response to Grobeson's 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of punishment, "every supervisor that was assigned to harass me, every 
single one with the exception of one, has been promoted," Grobeson alleges. 
</P>
<P>
He went to the Police Commission, Chief Gates and the mayor but he could not 
get anyone to investigate his charges that his civil rights had been violated 
by 3 1/2 years of harassment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In September, with the backing of a group called National Gay Rights Advocates, 
he filed his lawsuit and began speaking out about his case, which is becoming a 
cause celebre in the gay community. (Tonight, for instance, he will participate 
in a UCLA panel discussion on constitutional protections for gays and lesbians 
with three homosexual men and women who have filed suit against branches of the 
U.S. military.) 
</P>
<P>
Virtually everyone agrees, apparently, that Grobeson was an excellent 
policeman. 
</P>
<P>
"When he resigned, everyone who commanded him recommended that he be rehired," 
attorney Walsh said. But the city maintains it has yet to find any credible 
evidence to suggest that Grobeson was hounded off the force. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a big gap between perceiving yourself to be discriminated against and 
proving that specific individuals did bad things to you or the city had a 
policy of doing bad things to you," Walsh said. ". . . One thing we need to 
resolve is, how much (of the alleged harassment) was just the sort of broad 
humor that would take place in any predominantly male organization like a 
police force?" 
</P>
<P>
A large photograph of Mitch Grobeson at his bar mitzvah hangs on one wall of 
Grobeson's mother's home. Over a bookcase is a large framed photograph of 
Marilyn Grobeson seated on the hood of a squad car, as her uniformed son stands 
proudly behind the "Serve and Protect" emblem on the door. 
</P>
<P>
To transform himself from the boy in the first photo to the policeman in the 
other, Grobeson "worked hard, he sacrificed," his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
As a child, she recalled, he watched the Sheriff John show on television and 
told her that's what he wanted to be. "He couldn't say 'policeman,' so he said 
'peace man.' I remember that, 'peace man.' " 
</P>
<P>
His mother learned that her son was gay two weeks before he resigned. That 
wasn't easy to hear, she said, but "him being gay was not as difficult to deal 
with as the fact that his life's dream was shattered. 
</P>
<P>
"In our religion, there's a book called 'The Ethics of the Fathers,' " she 
said. "In it, there's a saying: 'Where there is no man, be one.' Mitchell has 
always stepped out to fill that role. The fact that he is gay makes him no less 
a man." 
</P>
<P>
If other gay and lesbian Los Angeles officers stepped forward and supported 
Grobeson in his litigation, there's a chance the case, which is now expected to 
take roughly four years to resolve, could be expedited through the courts as a 
class-action suit, his lawyers have said. 
</P>
<P>
As it stands now, Grobeson is still on his own, squared off against those he 
perceives as bad guys, with no backup in sight.

SHAKING YOUR FAMILY TREE!: TRACING RECORDS OF ORPHANED ANCESTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRA VANDERPOOL GORMLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: My ancestor was born after the death of his father in 1813 in 
Pennsylvania. His mother died when he was 10 days old and he was reared by a 
paternal aunt. If his parents did not own any property, would he have had a 
guardian named, or could just anyone have taken him to raise without creating 
any records? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: If his parents owned real property, there would have been a guardian 
appointed for your ancestor. However, you probably will find some court records 
about a guardian for your ancestor, even if his parents were poor. Consult 
county records pertaining to probate and Orphans' Court that may contain a 
great deal of information. Never assume anything in genealogy: Check the 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Where can I write to obtain the passenger lists of those arriving by ship 
from Oslo, Norway, to New York from 1906 to 1909? 
</P>
<P>
A: There were about two ships per month arriving in New York from Scandinavian 
ports during this four-year period. Fortunately for you, the New York passenger 
lists are indexed from 1897 to 1943 and the National Archives will check these 
indexes for you. 
</P>
<P>
Write to National Archives, 8th and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 
20408 and request several copies of NATF Form 81 (if you are researching more 
than one family who came during this time, you will need separate forms for 
each person). When these forms arrive, fill them out and return as instructed. 
You need the full name of the passenger, port of entry and approximate date of 
arrival. 
</P>
<P>
After your order is searched, photocopies will be made of records that relate 
to your request and National Archives will inform you of the cost to obtain 
these copies -- normally less than $5. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Does the term heirs at law always mean the wife and children, and would this 
have applied in Warren County, Ky., in 1809? 
</P>
<P>
A: Heirs at law simply means the persons who inherit or have a right of 
inheritance in the real property of one who has died without leaving a valid 
will. However, while the term generally refers to cases of intestacy, it is 
frequently used in a popular sense to designate any successor to property 
either by will or by law. 
</P>
<P>
The term does not necessarily mean the wife and children, although in most 
cases this would be true. In the example you sent from a book of abstracts of 
deeds, you will note that all the "heirs at law" have the same surname and that 
Elizabeth Key is designated as the widow of Simon Key. However, the interesting 
one is Elizabeth Hinton Key. Is she a Key by marriage or by blood? Possibly, 
Hinton is her middle name and was a way to distinguish her from her mother, 
Elizabeth. But in genealogy we cannot guess, we must try to prove each 
connection. 
</P>
<P>
Since your source is secondary, obtain copies of the actual deeds and read it 
for yourself. Fortunately Warren County, Ky., has numerous records dating back 
to 1796.

SMALL THINGS

<TEXT>
<P>
Enid Harris thinks little girls definitely ought to be seen -- maybe in a 
full-length fake leopard coat or a red plaid jacket with what could be called 
matching jodhpurs, except only one leg is plaid. The other is houndstooth 
check. 
</P>
<P>
The pattern mix led one store buyer to ask: "That's a mistake, isn't it?" 
recalls Harris over coffee and croissants in her Santa Monica cottage. 
"Actually, it's my biggest seller." 
</P>
<P>
Only last year, the blue-eyed brunet, who likes to combine her grandmother's 
genuine pearls with a T-shirt and jeans, was an unemployed Hollywood costume 
designer during the writers' strike. When she turned to a friend for advice, he 
suggested she try clothing design and "start small." So she did, with a line of 
playfully sophisticated garments for female fashion plates, Size toddler to 
6-X. 
</P>
<P>
When she was ready to approach retailers, Harris says, "there was no sense 
wasting time. I wanted to start at the top. I knew I was onto something 
unique," which is how her wares, retailing for $20 to $160, ended up in Fred 
Segal and Maxfield on Melrose Avenue, Bloomers for Kids on Sunset Boulevard, 
about 100 other stores nationally and Saks Fifth Avenue's fall catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
Harris loves children but she can't stand traditional kiddie concepts, such as 
"pink and blue frilly dresses. Children have no personality in those things." 
Inspiration comes from her own closet and travels in adult circles. Back from 
New Orleans where she was designing costumes for a Disney television pilot, 
Harris is now talking about putting the vivid colors she saw there in a future 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
Her previous lines -- which include anything from a chic suit and velveteen hat 
to a simple slip dress in washable silk -- are hip rather than hokey. "It's how 
I dress," Harris explains. "I just took my own clothes and shrunk them down." 
</P>
<P>
She dislikes trendy -- as in pint-size motorcycle jackets -- almost as much as 
frilly. It's not a word she would use to describe even her faux animal-print 
pieces: "Leopard has been around forever. I don't see it as trendy. I see it as 
wonderful fun fashion. I think little girls should be spoiled. They should wear 
creative, expressive clothes. It's an extension of costume design for me. I go 
into their little personalities and bring them out." 
</P>
<P>
A local product, Harris is a graduate of Birmingham High School in Van Nuys and 
studied art history in Europe. In pursuit of the perfect career, she went from 
makeup artist with Jon Peters in his celebrity hairdresser days to executive 
secretarial positions at both ABC and Paramount. She left "the glamorous, 
rarefied atmosphere" of the studios for a learning stint at Western Costume. 
"All of a sudden I was sizing waistbands and had dust in my eyes from hanging 
period-piece underwear," Harris muses. "Sometimes I would cry, but I wanted to 
break out from being a secretary." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her screen credits ("Fall Guy" with Lee Majors, "Commando," starring 
Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the CBS-TV series "O'Hara"), Harris feels her kiddie 
concepts "are more wearable than dramatic." She was so sure she was onto 
something special, she went through all her savings to start her company. "I 
had been shopping for a house," she says. 
</P>
<P>
But so many moppets are sporting her faux leopard and mismatched jodhpurs, she 
predicts she will have enough money to go house hunting again next year.

Accessories designer Isabel Canovas, at an informal event in her Madison Avenue 
store, was among the last to unveil her new fall collection here. 
</P>
<P>
The Paris-based designer with the international clientele has turned over a new 
leaf. Several leaves, to be exact. Gold oak leaves dappled with glass raindrops 
dangle from a bracelet. Maple leaves attached to acorns have been fashioned to 
decorate earlobes. A rustle of purple crushed velvet leaves turns out to be a 
muff, one of the more unusual cold-weather accessories in the new collection. 
And a bark-patterned shoe has a leaf attached to the toe. It looks as if it is 
blowing in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all about a nostalgia for fall," says the designer, who in the past has 
themed her twice-yearly collections to things as various as Russian icons, wild 
animals and "surrealistic fruit" (for spring '89). 
</P>
<P>
Though her accessories are among the most expensive in the world, she says she 
prefers to design them with a sense of humor and wit. 
</P>
<P>
This season, snails or "escargots" are one expression of it. A snail has taken 
a few bites out of a maple leaf pin. Another playful idea is a handbag that 
looks like an acorn of black velvet and green felt. A spectacular pair of green 
suede gauntlets are patterned like a chestnut tree on the outside and lined in 
bark-patterned silk stitched to resemble the veins of a leaf. 
</P>
<P>
Born and raised in Paris, Canovas never studied design, though her Spanish 
father was a textile designer and worked with the legendary couturier Cristobal 
Balenciaga. (Her brother, Manuel Canovas, is a noted fabric designer.) 
</P>
<P>
She does remember the first accessory that made a strong impression -- an 
Hermes blanket she bought 20 years ago and converted into a shawl. 
</P>
<P>
She learned her craft on the job at Christian Dior, where she worked for seven 
years before opening her first shop in Paris in 1982. She has subsequently 
opened shops in New York in 1985 and Madrid in 1988, and says she projects 
opening a Los Angeles location in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Canovas, who ranks with Frances Patiky Stein and Paloma Picasso in the realm of 
fine accessories, says she thinks the field has grown as women have grown more 
sophisticated about fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started on my own eight years ago, very few women were interested in 
accessories," says the striking brunette, who could pass for an enigmatic 
heroine in a Spanish art film. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to be recognized as dressed by Yves Saint Laurent. Now I think 
they want to be more individual and express themselves with accessories. 
Working women also want to change their look from day to evening, which they 
can do easily with accessories. It's also an easy way to change your mood." 
</P>
<P>
Canovas needs to be in the mood to design. To get there she settles into her 
midnight-blue studio. Her boutiques are decorated in the same inky shade. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very obscure -- midnight blue -- it's like the night. It's almost like 
black, and it makes all the other colors I work with more vivid. I prefer the 
night to the day." 
</P>
<P>
Canovas' designs retail for about $350 to $3,500.

CASHING IN ON A SELLER'S ART MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, Times Art Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who is cashing in on art at New York's upcoming round of big-ticket auctions 
and why are these collectors unloading their treasures? 
</P>
<P>
Most of the sellers aren't telling. 
</P>
<P>
While the auction houses thrive on highly publicized "single owner" sales 
featuring celebrated collections, the majority of items listed in auction 
catalogs are sold anonymously. In the catalogue for Christie's May 3 sale of 
contemporary art, for example, owners of only 11 of the 64 items offered are 
identified. In a comparable sale of 85 lots, on May 2 at Sotheby's, owners of 
only 18 works are named. 
</P>
<P>
Secrecy is essential in a business that prides itself on protecting the privacy 
of clients who don't want publicity about their financial affairs. But a survey 
of May auctions suggests several categories of sellers: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Private collectors who plunge into a bull market when their taste has 
changed or their passion for the chase has cooled. Los Angeles collector Max 
Palevsky, for one, is selling "Shot Red Marilyn," a striking painting of 
Marilyn Monroe by Andy Warhol. The 1964 silk-screened canvas, valued at $1.5 
million to $2 million, is for sale on May 3 at Christie's. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the best Pop image," Palevsky said. "It's a vacuum. It's empty. It's 
completely blank, and that's what Warhol's art is about." 
</P>
<P>
Why sell such a quintessential Warhol? 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very good time" in the market, Palevsky said, referring to the artist's 
death in 1987 and his current retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art. 
Furthermore, the portrait "is not a picture that I'm attached to." A set of 
eight variously colored "Marilyn" lithographs in his collection suit him better 
than the painting because "the repetition and changes in tonalities in the 
lithographs moderate the vacuity that's so hard to live with," said the 
collector whose acquisitive interests have shifted to Japanese prints and 
Arts-and-Crafts-period objects. 
</P>
<P>
A 1949 triptych by Jackson Pollock from the Los Angeles collection of Betty W. 
and Stanley K. Sheinbaum will go on the block in the same sale. Christie's 
expects the three panels to bring between $1.5 million and $2 million. The 
couple, who no longer collect contemporary art, decided to sell their Pollock 
as part of an attempt to "simplify" their lives and to make room for other 
artworks, Betty W. Sheinbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Avid collectors who have been priced out of a rapidly escalating area of 
the market, some of whom sell their collections to finance their habit in less 
expensive territory. One example is Sotheby's May 9 auction of eight 
Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works, valued at $55.7 million to $66.8 
million, from the collection of Jaime Ortiz-Patino, a grandson of Simon I. 
Patino, who made a fortune in the tin mines of Bolivia. Ortiz-Patino said in a 
press release that he got into the Impressionist market too late and will use 
proceeds of the sale to acquire paintings from less expensive periods as well 
as silver, rare books and manuscripts. 
</P>
<P>
Another is a $20-million sale of 17 landscape paintings, May 10 at Christie's, 
from a collection formed by the founders of G.D. Searle &amp; Co. 
pharmaceuticals. The decision to sell "reflects the fact that the market in 
those areas of the greatest interest to us, Impressionist and 
Post-Impressionist paintings, has outpaced our collecting resources," said 
Daniel Crow Searle in a prepared statement issued by the auction house. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Museums that are pressured to marshal their resources as they attempt to 
build distinctive collections. The Newport Harbor Art Museum, which 
concentrates on post-war California art, is selling an 11-foot-by-9-foot 
painting of a palm tree by East Coast artist Jim Dine, valued at $70,000 to 
$100,000. The museum is selling the work because it already has a better 
example of Dine's work than the atypical "Palm Tree" (which was commissioned 
for the Newporter Resort and given to the museum when the hotel changed hands), 
said museum director Kevin Consey. Proceeds from the sale can be used to buy 
one or more works that are better suited to the collection, Consey said. 
</P>
<P>
Several other museums are auctioning works to benefit their acquisitions funds, 
which can't easily cope with today's prices. Sotheby's May 9 and 10 sale of 
Impressionist and modern art, for example, offers a Dresden landscape by Oskar 
Kokoschka and a Paris street scene by Kees van Dongen from the Art Institute of 
Chicago, two Renoirs from the Metropolitan Museum of Art and five works from 
the Philadelphia Museum of Art, including a small portrait by Henri Matisse and 
a Chaim Soutine still life. 
</P>
<P>
In the same auction, the Walker Art Center in Milwaukee is selling a bronze 
portrait of Rembrandt by late 19th- and early 20th-Century French artist 
Emile-Antoine Bourdelle to establish a purchase fund for contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Charitable foundations with significant art assets that suddenly seem too 
valuable to keep. Two current examples have disappointed museums by removing 
long-term loans and hoped-for gifts from their walls. The Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art lost the late film producer Hal B. Wallis' collection of 
Impressionist art, put on loan there two years ago but now slated for sale May 
10 at Christie's. The collection of nine paintings, valued at more than $20 
million, is being sold to support medical research and conservation of natural 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
"Portrait of Duke Cosimo I de'Medici" by Jacopo da Carucci, a Florentine 
Mannerist known as Pontormo, which had hung for 19 years at the Frick 
Collection in Manhattan, will go on the block on May 31 at Christie's. Proceeds 
from the sale, expected to exceed $20 million, will go to the Homeland 
Foundation. The late Chancey Devereaux Stillman, the painting's owner, 
established the foundation to benefit Wethersfield House (his estate, now open 
to the public) and Catholic welfare and education programs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Heirs of collectors, some of whom have left instructions for their 
collections to be sold. Two groups of contemporary art offered on May 2 at 
Sotheby's fit this category: the Los Angeles-based collection of land developer 
Edwin Janss Jr. ($8.9 million to $11.5 million) and 19 pieces of Pop art from 
the collection of German industrialist Karl Stroher ($3 million to $3.9 
million). In the same sale, Pollock's "Number 19," a 1949 drip painting billed 
as "the most important Pollock to come to auction," will be sold from the 
estate of Baltimore collector Israel Rosen. Sotheby's has valued the work at $3 
million to $4.5 million, just under the artist's record of $4.8 million, set 
last May. 
</P>
<P>
May and November mark the high tides of New York art auctions. This year, 
during the first two weeks of May, Christie's and Sotheby's will offer an 
estimated $85.9 million to $113.1 million worth of contemporary art and $317.2 
million to $422.5 million of Impressionist and modern art. The Pontormo 
portrait will go on the block May 31 in a sale of Old Master paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Highlights of Sotheby's contemporary auction are the May 2 sales of the Janss 
and Stroher collections. The spotlight of Sotheby's May 9 Impressionist and 
modern sale is on the Ortiz-Patino collection. 
</P>
<P>
The May 10 sale of the Wallis and Searle collections are the big events for 
Christie's in the first half of the month, but talk about that auction is 
likely to fade by May 31, when the Pontormo goes under the gavel. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, auction watchers continue to wonder how much higher prices can rise 
and if there is any top of a market that has already left museums on the 
sidelines. Answers are not to be found by consulting the stock market or even 
the general economic climate because "art objects are unique and the art market 
is driven by the objects," said John L. Marion, chairman of Sotheby's. 
</P>
<P>
One must know what's coming up for sale in future auctions to predict the 
health of the art market, Marion said. "What's in the pipeline now is pretty 
incredible. I don't look for any slackening at all."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: MAKING HISTORY BEFORE IT HAPPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Television is history's microwave. 
</P>
<P>
CBS is about to present "Guts &amp; Glory: The Rise and Fall of Oliver North," 
even though the extent of North's fall -- or even whether he has fallen -- has 
not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
North's trial in connection with the Iran-Contra scandal has just ended. But 
the jury is not expected to have reached a verdict when this two-part docudrama 
airs at 9 p.m. Sunday and Tuesday on Channels 2 and 8, starring David Keith as 
the charismatic Marine lieutenant colonel who gained celebrity from the 
Iran-Contra hearings and emerged a national hero or national disgrace, 
depending on your point of view. 
</P>
<P>
Four hours of "Guts and Glory" surely won't decide the issue for anyone, and 
it's difficult finding a rationale for television -- a supposedly definitive 
account of a work in progress -- with such a built-in contradiction. 
</P>
<P>
Based on a book by Ben Bradlee Jr., "Guts and Glory" was completed before the 
North trial and thus excludes, for example, recently renewed suspicions about 
then-Vice President George Bush's role in the Iran-Contra affair. Hence, it 
also omits conflicts between the trial testimonies of North and former National 
Security Council adviser Robert C. McFarlane, a key clash of Iran-Contra 
accounts on which the North verdict may partially rest. 
</P>
<P>
When last seen in "Guts and Glory," McFarlane (Paul Dooley) is leaving his 
National Security Council post while lauding North for bringing "integrity" to 
government. What a difference five years make. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, "Guts and Glory" also ends before the start of those 1987 televised 
congressional hearings that introduced then-anonymous North to America and 
helped build the Iran-Contra scandal into a melodrama every bit as mesmerizing 
as "Dallas" or "Dynasty." 
</P>
<P>
Polarized public reaction to those hearings and its diverse cast of characters 
said as much about America and its values as Iran-Contra did about North. 
</P>
<P>
Although ably acted and nicely staged, "Guts and Glory" is instant, short-order 
history, a truncated perspective made minus the benefit of time and rushed on 
the air by CBS for the May ratings sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
The Oliver L. North at the center of director-writer-executive producer Mike 
Robe's story is an ambitious, calculating political player and 
ultraconservative ideologue. There are no shadings in North's character or 
universe. He is guided by rigid views of patriotism and of right and wrong, and 
also by an unswerving allegiance to his career that puts recurring severe 
strains on his marriage. 
</P>
<P>
As a character study of North, "Guts and Glory" is rather flat. It works best 
as a generic study of power and its impact on those positioned to exert it. 
"Arrogance of power" is a cliche that perfectly fits this shadowy milieu in 
which the self-righteous appoint themselves to make American foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
As CIA Director William Casey (Barnard Hughes) tells his protege North here, 
there are "no rules but one: Do what's right." Their version of "right." 
</P>
<P>
We meet North as a Commie-bashing, flag-waving midshipman at the Naval Academy 
with a strong personal code of honor and a meticulously detailed life plan that 
includes switching to the Marines and finding "the right wife" to advance his 
career. He chooses Betsy (Annette O'Toole). 
</P>
<P>
A tour in Vietnam feeds North's contempt for anti-war protesters at home and 
"the politicians" who won't let the U.S. fight to "win." In 1981, showing a 
talent for ingratiating himself to those in a position to help him advance, 
he's named a military aide with the NSC in the Administration of new President 
Ronald Reagan (Bryan Clark). There he hires Fawn Hall (Amy Stock-Poynton) to 
join him on "the cutting edge of history," passionately endorses Reagan's 
support of the Contras fighting Nicaragua's Sandinista government and begins 
viewing CIA chief Casey as his mentor. 
</P>
<P>
Later, North will help Casey circumvent the Boland Amendment that prohibited 
U.S. intelligence agencies from providing money or military help to the 
Contras. Plus we see the seeds of the alleged "missiles for hostages" deal with 
Iran that went awry and evolved into a scheme to secretly divert Iran arms 
sales profits to the Contras without the approval of Congress. We see the plan 
endorsed by Casey, approved by then NSC chief John Poindexter (Peter Boyle) and 
executed by North, all of them ends-justifies-the-means people. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter tells North that even Reagan didn't know about "the diversion." But 
is Poindexter being truthful or merely protecting the President? 
</P>
<P>
As for Bush, more than merely out of the "loop" here, he's out of the story. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, we get the cover-up, the damage control, the shredding and the 
alleged scapegoating of North, all building toward those congressional hearings 
that you won't see. 
</P>
<P>
Bearing the crushing burden of playing a real-life character who has been 
burned into the consciousness of America, Keith conveys the crusading passion 
and commitment, but in no way the personal magnetism that has been attributed 
to North. 
</P>
<P>
You can envision strangers being swayed by the real North's sales pitches to 
fund the Contras. You can envision legions of disciples following him, but not 
Keith over the hill. 
</P>
<P>
O'Toole is more convincing as the lesser-known Betsy North, whose outsider 
status in her husband's life makes her a casualty in this scenario, along with 
the North children. 
</P>
<P>
Although a head shorter, Hughes is especially effective as the late Casey, who 
wears the label of main malefactor here along with North, a label that will 
stick at least for the time being. Dead men don't refute charges. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the single character as central to this story as North, is not even 
a real character. He's Aaron Sykes (Terry O'Quinn), identified as one of 
North's NSC colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Although viewers have no way of knowing it, there is no Sykes. He's a 
composite, Robe's interjection of a moral voice to rebut and repeatedly 
question North's ethics, actions and priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"What you guys tried to pull was nothing short of a secret government," Sykes 
lectures North. 
</P>
<P>
"A Marine does what it takes...," North responds. 
</P>
<P>
TV docudrama, too, it seems.

KTTV TO AIR 'LUCY' SPECIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KTTV-TV Channel 11 will pay tribute to Lucille Ball on Saturday with a 10-hour, 
commercial-free "I Love Lucy" marathon, beginning at 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
During periods between the episodes and at what would normally be the 
commercial breaks within the shows, KTTV will run newly taped spots featuring 
Ball's friends and co-workers sharing their favorite Lucy stories, said Don 
Tillman, Channel 11's vice president of programming. 
</P>
<P>
Because there will be no commercials, Tillman said Thursday, episodes will not 
necessarily begin on the half-hour. The last four episodes to air during the 
tribute, he said, will be the favorites of the actress, who died Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Tillman said the marathon was intended as "a celebration of life, not a 
mourning situation." 
</P>
<P>
He said he could not estimate how much the station stands to lose in 
advertising revenue. Another Los Angeles station estimated the figure at 
$150,000.

HOGAN MAKES SENSE OF 'IDIOGLOSSIA' AT ODYSSEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When most actors learn their lines, they learn words. Beth Hogan learned 
gibberish. 
</P>
<P>
"It must sound more difficult than it actually is," said the actress who plays 
Nell, a young Appalachian woman -- isolated from the outside world -- who has 
developed her own language in Mark Handley's "Idioglossia" (at the Odyssey 
Theatre). "Hotten is hot, guh-few is food. Rye-prow means very good. Durdadaw 
is during the time. Rye hong is hungry. Duray, done rye hong means today, very 
hungry. And holdate is hold the potato." 
</P>
<P>
At the onset of the story, Nell is found in a lonely cabin, and comes under the 
care of a team of behavioral and speech therapists, who set about to decipher 
her "Nellish" and introduce her to English. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark (Handley) made a tape of the Nellish, with that Appalachian-hillbilly 
accent," Hogan said. "The lilt of the language really helps, because it does 
have a rhyme and cadence to it. Of course," she said with a smile, "initially 
you have to get over feeling like a nerd-head. But it also gives you a great 
sense of freedom. Suddenly you're not restricted to the way people think you 
can say the line -- because they don't know what you're saying." 
</P>
<P>
If the role wasn't challenge enough, Hogan had her friends' funereal reactions 
to contend with. "Well," they said gamely at the end of the first preview, 
"it's always good to see you on stage." 
</P>
<P>
But the next night, Hogan says, the audience was totally different. "They 
accepted the play -- and that gave me confidence. I have felt uncomfortable in 
that (theater) before. But not with this character. She doesn't have any 
anxieties, because she's not trying to prove anything. So she lets everyone 
into her world. If you want to be there, fine; if you want to leave, you can. 
It's the same thing with her communication. She says: 'It's important what I'm 
saying. It's less important that you hear it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hogan began acting at a Catholic women's college in her native Iowa. "It was 
one of those theater departments where you didn't have men around, so you got 
to do everything," she said with happy nostalgia. "We built the set, did the 
lights, acted in the plays, made the costumes. You really got a sense of not 
just acting, but being in a community and how a play happens -- that community 
feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Accompanying a friend on an audition for the graduate acting program at UC San 
Diego, Hogan was encouraged to do a reading -- and was later chosen for the 
program, one of four women picked from nationwide auditions. 
</P>
<P>
"So I went to La Jolla with my big Midwestern shoes and a car my dad had bought 
me," she said. "We called it Desiree. It was a huge white boat, a Chrysler 
Newport -- it was just not cool. That was also the first time I had acting 
classes. Before, we'd just done the play. I didn't know anything about 
studying, what honesty was supposed to be about, breaking down a script. I felt 
so left out: the car, the clothes, the shoes, the haircut, the accent." 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, Hogan moved to Los Angeles, where she began teaching poetry, English 
and morality at a private high school. One night she happened upon a Grotowski 
workshop conducted by Odyssey artistic director Ron Sossi; out of that came a 
role in the Odyssey's "An Evening of Dirty Religious Plays." 
</P>
<P>
She later became a member of the theater's ensemble, appearing in "Three Top 
Hats," "A Voyage to Arcturus," "Edmond," "Mary Barnes" and "Mother Courage." 
Nowadays -- in addition to performing in this play -- she divides her time 
between the theater's subscription office and teaching acting at Santa Monica 
College. 
</P>
<P>
But that's where she parts company with most of her colleagues. In an industry 
town, where every actress really wants to be a star, Beth Hogan is on a 
different track. She tells her age (36) without a moment's hesitation, balks at 
the phoniness that's expected of her in a casting situation. And she refuses to 
chase the almighty dollar. 
</P>
<P>
"You have just so much time," she said. "And to drive all over town (to read) 
for four lines, then drive somewhere to go 'Yum!' in a commercial -- well, it's 
hard for me to say, 'That's what I'm going to dedicate my life to doing.' I 
have a real pride about theater. And the nice thing about (the Odyssey) is if 
they like you, you can stay."

CINCO DE MAYO AT SCHOOL GOES UP IN FLAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It may not be much of a Cinco de Mayo for the students at Malabar Street School 
in Boyle Heights. An arson fire early Thursday swept through a three-story 
building at the predominantly Latino campus, causing an estimated $250,000 in 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the classrooms, textbooks and equipment lost in the blaze, teachers and 
students were most upset about the loss of 20 brand new folklorico costumes 
that were to be worn next Friday during the school's festivities marking the 
May 5, 1862, victory of a small, ragtag Mexican army over French troops. 
</P>
<P>
"We got the costumes in yesterday," moaned second-grade teacher Lorena Fuentes. 
"Now they're gone." 
</P>
<P>
She had stored the brightly colored clothing in Room 35, where authorities said 
the fire apparently was set about 1:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Some students fretted about other props to be used in next week's 
long-anticipated festivities. 
</P>
<P>
"Our (hand-made) machetes got burned up," said Jose Omedo, a dejected 
7-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
Hearing the youngster's lament, Fuentes ventured: "Maybe we'll use rulers." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 50 firefighters went to the Eastside school in the 3200 block of East 
Malabar Street when a fire was reported in the middle floor. Fire officials 
said the flames spread from Fuentes' classroom, eventually gutting three other 
classrooms and burning a hole in the roof. The fire was controlled in 45 
minutes. It was contained to one of several buildings on the school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Arson investigators were certain that the blaze was intentionally set. 
Obscenities were scrawled in red paint in some of the damaged classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
School Vandalized 
</P>
<P>
Principal Alma Pena-Sanchez said the fire may have been the work of young 
street toughs who in the past have vandalized the school for no apparent 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the work of some misguided young people," Pena-Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
As work crews and fire investigators sifted through the charred classrooms, the 
principal and other administrators scrambled to keep the school open. 
</P>
<P>
Malabar is used as a voting precinct for local elections, and in the fire's 
aftermath the cardboard polling booths were pressed into service as temporary 
classroom walls, allowing four classes to meet in the school auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
It was a noisy scene as Room 40 in one corner fashioned crayon-decorated 
folders for personal papers while, in another, Room 39 struggled with 
multiplication problems. Two other classes, including Fuentes' second-graders, 
were squeezed into the school library. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pupils to Be Bused 
</P>
<P>
Next week, at least two sixth-grade classes will be bused to two Eastside 
elementary schools, Harrison and Kennedy, for the rest of the school year 
because of fire damage. And administration of the state assessment program test 
for third- and sixth-graders, scheduled for Thursday, was put off until next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, though, the talk came back to the Cinco de Mayo celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, we'll keep going," Pena-Sanchez vowed. "We'll have it, but it may not be 
much."

CONVICT THWARTS REAGAN ON CAVE PAINTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BAKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a beloved ex-President, Ronald Reagan almost always gets what he wants these 
days. 
</P>
<P>
But this week, one of Reagan's personal wishes was blocked by a federal convict 
with a typewriter. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Reagan personally telephoned the National Park Service in 
Washington to add his support to proposed national historic landmark status for 
a mitten-shaped hill in the Santa Monica Mountains that includes prized Chumash 
Indian cave paintings. 
</P>
<P>
But on Monday, when the Park Service's advisory board met, it concluded that 
its hands were tied. The owner of the land, Ronald Semler, who has veto power 
over landmark designation, had written a letter opposing the proposed 
designation. 
</P>
<P>
"I have had my fill of U.S. government bureaucrats and U.S. government 
employees," Semler's letter said. "I have had more than enough experiences, all 
of them negative." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pleaded Guilty 
</P>
<P>
Semler, 44, is sitting in Lompoc Federal Prison after pleading guilty to 
charges stemming from an indictment alleging that his North Hollywood export 
company sold helicopters to North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Procedurally, landmark status does not mean much. It offers no protection when 
the landmark is on private property. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of Semler's opposition, the Park Service's National Park Advisory 
Board could do no more than get Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. to declare 
the cave paintings "eligible for designation." That assured only that federal 
agencies must pay heed to the cave's existence if they engage in construction 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the minds of anthropologists and historians conversant in the 
history of the 15,000 Chumash Indians who once flourished from Los Angeles to 
San Luis Obispo counties, the lack of landmark status is a severe 
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
According to these experts, the cave paintings on Semler's 360-acre Saddlerock 
Ranch above Malibu include an imagination-stirring scene that captures one of 
California's most important slices of history. 
</P>
<P>
Among a hundred pictographs of animals, celestial objects and medicine men on 
rock walls, beneath a massive pink-boulder roof, is a depiction of four men on 
horses -- animals that were not found here until Spanish explorers began 
settling California in the mid-18th Century. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Meeting 
</P>
<P>
The images are widely believed to represent the first meeting between Chumash 
Indians and one of two early parties of Spanish settlers who trekked from 
Mexico through California: Gaspar de Portola, who, accompanied by Father 
Junipero Serra, led an expedition to establish missions in 1769, or Juan 
Bautista de Anza, who commanded 240 men, women and children on a journey in 
1775 that led to the founding of San Francisco. Some historians say 
descriptions in diaries kept by Portola's party conform dramatically to the 
Indians' paintings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very important for this to be designated as a landmark. This is the first 
time that an Indian portrayed a man on horseback," said Campbell Grant, a 
Carpinteria author who is a leading authority on Indian rock art in North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Chumash Monument' 
</P>
<P>
"There is no other place in Chumash territory where you have a European motif 
intermixed with the Chumash motif," said John Johnson, curator of anthropology 
at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History. "It is sort of a Chumash 
monument in the way we want to make it a national landmark." 
</P>
<P>
Chumash rock paintings, believed to be as old as 2,000 years at some locations, 
recorded significant cultural and sacred events. To acquire the bright colors 
needed for the paintings, the Chumash ground minerals, such as limonite and 
hematite; mixed them with water, animal fat or plant juice, and daubed cave 
walls with elaborate narratives in yellow, white, black, red and blue-green 
paints. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan had long been aware of the historic value of the Saddlerock Ranch's 
Chumash site because he once owned the adjoining Yearling Row ranch, 
subsequently purchased by the state as part of Malibu Creek State Park. He 
often rode horses on Saddlerock property during his acting days, according to 
Mark D. Weinberg, a spokesman at Reagan's Century City office, and Grant 
Gerson, co-owner of Calamigos Ranch in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the Park Service attempted to buy Semler's ranch, which it viewed as a 
potentially choice section of the new Santa Monica Mountains National 
Recreation Area. But Semler refused, saying he wanted to live there. He 
subsequently made the property less attractive to park planners by building a 
two-story home and planting 11,000 avocado trees on the hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby ranch owner Gerson said he believed that Semler's refusal to sell the 
land was based on principle, not money, and said Semler had been "wonderful" 
about permitting private outdoor-education programs to view the cave paintings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strike a Deal 
</P>
<P>
But David Brown, a Malibu-area civic activist and adviser to the Sierra Club, 
said he believed that the Park Service might have been able to strike a deal 
with Semler if the agency's hands had not been tied by budget cuts during the 
Reagan Administration. The cuts eliminated three-quarters of the Santa Monica 
Mountains park's acquisition budget between 1980 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"I see a great deal of irony" in Reagan seeking federal recognition of a site 
that could have been taken out of private hands and protected under an 
Administration more respectful of parks, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
One advocate of protecting the Chumash site who caught Reagan's ear was 
Courtney Trisler, who once worked on the Saddlerock Ranch before Semler 
purchased it and now works on Reagan's Santa Barbara ranch. 
</P>
<P>
For the last decade, Trisler has been the most passionate advocate for the 
caves. Two years after negotiations between the Park Service and Semler broke 
down, Trisler wrote a letter to Saudi Arabian billionaire Sheik Mohammed 
al-Fassi asking for a donation to help purchase the ranch. The sheik did not 
reply, but his brother-in-law, Prince Turki bin Abdul Azziz, sent $200. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Asked Questions 
</P>
<P>
"Courtney drove us absolutely wild pressing for this (landmark designation), 
but we never took him seriously until gradually he wore us down, and we started 
to ask questions (about the cave paintings) of honest-to-God archeologists," 
said Ben Levy, manager of the Park Service's national historic landmarks 
program, who said Reagan alluded to Trisler when he telephoned the Park Service 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
"When Ronald and Nancy Reagan hired me four years ago, I mentioned the cave to 
them and they both said they'd been inside it," Trisler said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he saw Reagan at his ranch last week and told him about the 
upcoming advisory board meeting and urged him to lend his support. 
</P>
<P>
To Semler, the obsessive Trisler was someone to be dismissed as "a pain," a 
characterization he made in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
But Semler began having more pressing pains in the mid-1980s. Federal 
investigators began probing reports that Semler's import firm, Associated 
Industries, was selling scores of Hughes helicopters to North Korea in 
violation of the federal Trading With the Enemy Act. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
False Statements 
</P>
<P>
After being indicted by a federal grand jury, Semler and his brother, Monte 
Barry Semler, pleaded guilty last year to lesser charges that included making 
false statements in export declarations. Ronald Semler drew a three-year 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Semler attempted to arrange an early release by asking a federal 
judge to let him trade his remaining jail time to run a $900,000 community 
service program for poor children with learning disabilities at his ranch. The 
judge turned him down. 
</P>
<P>
Thus it was with evident bitterness that Semler -- typing on Saddlerock Ranch 
stationery -- sent the Park Service a letter saying thanks but no thanks to the 
proposal to make the Chumash rock art site a national landmark. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not want, need or wish to have any further dealings with government 
agencies or government bureaucrats," he wrote, adding that he believes that he 
has taken great pains to preserve the Indian art, and concluding: 
</P>
<P>
"I, of course, will not be attending your meeting on April 24 on this matter.".

STATE INSURANCE DEPT. HANDICAPPED BY FIRE, CONSUMER GROUP SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ability of the state Department of Insurance to regulate the insurance 
industry and process consumer complaints has been handicapped as the result of 
a recent fire at its mid-Wilshire District headquarters, consumer advocates 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
State officials acknowledged that the displacement caused by the fire has 
resulted in some problems, including the temporary shutdown of the department's 
computer system. But they said the disruption of services has been "minimal." 
</P>
<P>
About 500 state office workers from six agencies were displaced by the March 2 
fire on the 15th floor of the 19-story CNA Building at 600 S. Commonwealth Ave. 
</P>
<P>
State inspectors discovered asbestos fibers in the building and ordered some of 
the workers to leave in mid-March. The remainder of the workers were told to 
leave April 3. 
</P>
<P>
The results of a test of asbestos levels conducted by the state Department of 
General Services will be released Monday, said department spokeswoman Anne 
Garbeff. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City fire officials said Thursday that the blaze, which started in 
a computer workroom of the state Department of Savings and Loan, was the work 
of an arsonist. A Fire Department spokesman said there were no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the displaced agencies, including the Department of Insurance, moved to 
a Wilshire Boulevard high-rise. But workers in other departments -- including 
the Department of Corporations -- are still working out of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Miller, executive director of the Insurance Consumer Action Network, 
said that because of the Insurance Department's displacement, many department 
records were no longer available to the public. Some insurance customers have 
complained to his organization because they were unable to reach the 
department's offices, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that this has been going on for so long and that the governor has not 
ordered General Services to treat this as a crisis and a high priority is 
inexcusable," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said that when his group asked the department for public documents 
relating to a recent request by State Farm for a rate increase, the department 
said the documents could not be found. Eventually, the department asked State 
Farm to provide the consumer advocates with copies of the documents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of disruption is going to disable the department's statutory 
regulating functions and their mandate to protect consumers," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Carey Fletcher, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Department in San Francisco, 
said, however, that the Los Angeles office is operating at "nearly 100% 
capacity." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Up and Running' 
</P>
<P>
"People are doing the absolute best they can under the circumstances," she 
said. "We are up and running." 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher said the department's computer system has been disconnected since 
April 6. She said the system would be removed from the Commonwealth Avenue 
building and reconnected at the department's new offices in "the next day or 
two." The department will rent a second computer system to handle the "minimal 
backlog of cases," she added. 
</P>
<P>
One employee in the department's Los Angeles office who did not wish to be 
identified said the office's temporary shutdown came at an especially bad time 
because of the confusion caused by Proposition 103, the recently passed 
insurance initiative 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the Department of Defense shutting down in the middle of World War 
III," the employee said. 
</P>
<P>
Many workers in the department have spent five weeks without typewriters or 
computer processors, the employee said. 
</P>
<P>
"We still don't have the capability to send a letter to someone," he said. "All 
of this mail is stacking up waiting to be answered." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday afternoon, calls to numbers listed for the Insurance Department's 
Los Angeles office were either unanswered, or answered with recorded messages. 
Calls to the department's consumer hot line were unanswered.

DELI OWNER CARRIES ON, FEARS HE'LL BE REMEMBERED ONLY FOR DRUG CHARGES 
</P>

<P>
At Nick's Deli on Seal Beach's Main Street, the pastrami is hot and the pickles 
crisp. There are baseball pictures on the wall and domestic beer is $1.25 a 
bottle. And on Thursday, there was a good lunchtime crowd, as if nothing had 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
Proprietor Dominic Zampino took orders behind the counter and let customers 
help themselves to soft drinks and beer while waiting for their sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old Zampino (Nick to friends) wasn't worried about someone sneaking 
a drink without paying. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's honest," he explained with a good-natured smile. 
</P>
<P>
Not quite everyone, according to the undercover narcotics agents who had 
visited Nick's Deli just 1 day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Zampino was arrested at the deli Wednesday on suspicion of possession of 
cocaine and marijuana for sale. He was freed on $25,000 bail. At the restaurant 
and at Zampino's Long Beach home, authorities said they confiscated about 
$8,500 in cash, about 20 pistols, shotguns and rifles, 2 ounces of cocaine and 
a pound of marijuana with a combined street value of about $13,000. 
</P>
<P>
"He told us he was a gun collector," said a spokesman for the state bureau of 
narcotics enforcement, which was still checking the registration of the 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Zampino, who for 12 years has operated the deli once run by his mother and 
father, said he is saddened because when people in town see him now, they will 
remember him as the guy busted for cocaine, "not for anything good that I have 
done." 
</P>
<P>
"It will hurt (my) reputation," Zampino told a reporter Thursday. "You get 
remembered for one thing, good or bad, and this is my bad thing." 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be rough. It'll be really tough," he added. 
</P>
<P>
As for the alleged drug activity, Zampino said that authorities had advised him 
not to speak about the case. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the state bureau of narcotics enforcement said they had received a 
tip that Zampino was selling cocaine at his deli, a popular eatery 2 blocks 
from the pier. 
</P>
<P>
After contacting Seal Beach police, state agents were told that Zampino had 
sold cocaine at the restaurant "since at least 1984," said Bennie Rincon, 
supervisor of the narcotics enforcement bureau in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Local police had been unable to prove a case, however. 
</P>
<P>
"They had tried," Rincon said. "But it's real difficult with the community of 
Seal Beach being as close-knit as it is for them to go in there without being 
recognized. 
</P>
<P>
"When we made contact with them, they were real excited that someone would give 
them assistance. It required more than a couple of hours of just sitting out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
The surveillance of Nick's Deli paid off, Rincon said, and agents arrested 
Zampino and two other men there Wednesday, serving search warrants on the 
delicatessen and Zampino's home. 
</P>
<P>
One of the other men was arrested for an outstanding drunk-driving warrant, but 
the other was arrested for possession of a bindle of cocaine, believed to have 
been purchased at the deli and stuffed in his sock, Rincon said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighboring merchants, many of whom eat regularly at Nick's, said they were 
surprised and saddened by Zampino's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
A shopkeeper on Main Street told how local merchants and customers were abuzz 
with the news on Wednesday, stopping on the sidewalks to share the gossip. And 
Zampino lamented that two daily newspapers had already carried the story and 
that scores of people had clipped out copies for him "just in case" he hadn't 
seen it. 
</P>
<P>
His telephone hadn't stopped ringing with calls from others who wanted to ask 
him about it, Zampino said, and "next week the local paper will have it." 
</P>
<P>
But even in cozy Seal Beach, where everybody knows everybody, not everybody had 
heard the news yet. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few doors to the south, a clerk selling newspapers and used books who 
had been to the deli only moments before to buy coffee said that he was 
astonished to learn that such a thing had happened. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a terrible thing; he's a terrific guy," said Ken Bartel, owner of the 
Picture Show Gallery, an art shop a few doors north of the deli. "He's got a 
family restaurant. He's got tons of friends in town. He's just a nice guy." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it got blown way out of proportion," Bartel added.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AQUATIC PROJECT WILL GET $1 MILLION MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pasadena is clearing the way for construction of one of the nation's largest 
swimming complexes near the Rose Bowl, voting to more than double its 
contribution to the project to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Project officials said that ground will be broken within a few weeks for the 
Rose Bowl Aquatics Center -- a complex of swimming pools and a clubhouse at the 
southern end of Brookside Park -- and that the facility should be open by the 
summer of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Board of Directors has agreed to provide construction financing by 
issuing certificates of participation and to pay about 20% of the project's 
$4.9-million cost. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Donald F. McIntyre recommended that the board approve the 
financial assistance in light of the aquatic center's success in attracting 
private donations.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BALLOT MEASURE ON BENEFITS DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council has voted to delay a ballot measure calling for a 
reduction in the time survivors of police officers and firefighters killed in 
the line of duty have to wait for cost-of-living adjustments to their benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a projected $600,000 bill to place the Charter amendment measure on 
the ballot, the council voted 12 to 0 to rescind an earlier resolution to place 
the measure before voters in a June 6 special election. Under the motion by 
City Councilwoman Gloria Molina, the measure could come up for a vote during 
the next citywide election, most probably in June, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Buzzell, vice president of the firefighters union, said firefighters 
and police officers "could not in good conscience" urge the council to have the 
issue placed on the ballot when the estimated benefits to widows and surviving 
children would be about $89,000 in the first year, while the cost to the city 
would be so much higher. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would have removed the five-year delay that survivors must wait 
until they are eligible for cost-of-living adjustments.

3 PEOPLE INJURED IN COLLISION OF 2 PORSCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Costa Mesa man thrown from a car was in critical condition Thursday and two 
others were being treated for major injuries after a head-on collision on 
Irvine Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Robert K. Elliott, 21, suffered serious head injuries after he was ejected from 
the 1972 Porsche his friend was driving. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about 6:30 p.m. on the winding section of Irvine Avenue 
just north of Private Road, police said. Dale Cross, 22, who was driving, 
apparently lost control and drove over the center divider into oncoming 
traffic, police said. 
</P>
<P>
That car collided with Paul Dolkas' 1969 silver Porsche, then careened into a 
Volkswagen and a Mercedes-Benz. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott and Cross, also of Costa Mesa, were taken to United Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana, where Cross was in stable condition after suffering head and 
leg injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Dolkas, 35, of Newport Beach was in serious condition Thursday after being 
airlifted to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Robert Oakley said Cross worked at Coast Detailing shop in Newport 
Beach, where the Porsche had been brought for detailing. Cross did not have 
permission to drive the car, Oakley said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GAS CHAMBER URGED IN VICIOUS MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge Thursday recommended the gas chamber for a Palmdale man who contended 
that he was possessed by an evil alter ego when he raped a woman, beat her into 
a coma, then set her bed afire. 
</P>
<P>
James Scott, 26, was sentenced in 1986 to 26 years in prison for raping, 
severely beating and burning 24-year-old Wanda Jensen. But he was charged with 
first-degree murder after the comatose victim died in 1987 of complications 
from her burns. 
</P>
<P>
The murder charge was heard in a non-jury trial before Superior Court Judge 
Margaret M. Grignon, who recommended the death penalty Thursday. Grignon will 
review the case before she imposes final sentence on May 18. 
</P>
<P>
Scott surrendered to Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies four days after the 
April, 1986, attack on Jensen.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ADVOCATE OF ANIMAL RIGHTS ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A leader of the local anti-vivisection group holding rallies around Los Angeles 
this week was arrested Thursday at UCLA for allegedly trying to steal a pair of 
handcuffs from a campus policeman. Jack Carone, 41, was arrested on suspicion 
of grand theft involving an alleged incident that UCLA authorities said took 
place Monday during the arrests of 22 fellow demonstrators after a sit-in 
outside the office of the university's chancellor. Carone was taken Thursday to 
the sheriff's station in West Hollywood and released after posting a $1,500 
bail bond, a sheriff's spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Carone and about 70 other members of Last Chance for Animals were back at the 
Westwood campus Thursday, marching with signs proclaiming their opposition to 
the use of animals in medical research, according to a UCLA spokesman. However, 
a group of about 150 UCLA students and medical patients held a counter rally in 
favor of continuing such research in hopes that it will lead to cures of 
diseases. Carone could not be reached for comment.

SOCIOLOGIST CALLS FOR MORE DIVERSITY IN UC MULTICULTURAL EDUCATION EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN DAVIDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UC Berkeley sociologist Neil Smelser, whose 1986 report on undergraduate 
education fueled the University of California's push to require multicultural 
courses, told educators Thursday that the movement must grow because "education 
and diversification are the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
Smelser, acting director of the Center for Studies in Higher Education at 
Berkeley, told colleagues at a UC conference on cultural diversity that the 
most important function of the university is to expand the way students think 
so they learn to critically analyze and appreciate the world beyond their 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
"The first principle to remember is the student is always wrong," he said in a 
keynote speech at 2-day conference at the Irvine Hilton and Towers. "After we 
undermine the foundations of their critical thought . . . we have to give 
students the capacity to put it back together again." 
</P>
<P>
Smelser praised faculty members at UC Irvine and UC Berkeley for their recent 
requirement of classes to promote multicultural diversity, but he added that he 
favors making such classes optional so instructors will be forced to engage 
students with exciting course material. 
</P>
<P>
Such classes should emphasize cultural, racial, ethnic and gender issues, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see implementation either less radical or more radical," 
Smelser said, and urged UC campuses either to offer 15 to 20 optional courses 
that would attract most students sometime during their college careers or to 
undertake an ambitious effort to incorporate issues centered on cultural 
diversity throughout the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
"We sought to have more of a package, rather than just a bit," Smelser said. 
"What we passed (at Berkeley) is a bit." 
</P>
<P>
Berkeley's Academic Senate, which establishes curriculum for the campus, ended 
a year of controversy Tuesday when faculty representatives approved an American 
Cultures undergraduate requirement, which can be fulfilled by taking a course 
examining blacks, Latinos, Asians, American Indians and Americans of European 
heritage. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise requirement, passed in a 227-194 vote, mandates study of three 
of the five groups in proposed courses. 
</P>
<P>
UCI's multicultural requirement, approved unanimously by its Academic Senate on 
April 13, is potentially broader. Beginning in fall, 1990, entering 
undergraduates would be required to take a course examining the historical, 
social and political aspects of minorities in the United States or the cultures 
and histories of foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
UC Santa Barbara was the first campus of the university to require a 
multicultural course of all undergraduates. Students majoring in the College of 
Humanities and Sciences at UC Riverside must also take such a course; the four 
other general UC campuses are considering similar requirements.

FIRST MEETING HELD; 
</P>
<P>
MORE LATINO LEADERS SOUGHT BY NEW GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN R. CHURM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the first gathering of its kind in Orange County, a group of locally elected 
Latino officials met Thursday to discuss ways to recruit and groom Latinos for 
public service, including political office. 
</P>
<P>
Spearheaded by Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, the highest ranking and most 
visible Latino officeholder in the county, the nonpartisan group was formed to 
encourage Latinos to seek careers in public service as well as to provide 
leadership and promote discussion on issues such as education. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Vasquez said, attempts to solve the problems confronting the 
county's burgeoning Latino population have been isolated and sporadic. By 
coming together, he said, the county's Latino leaders can pool their clout as 
well as their resources to deal more effectively with the needs of the Latino 
community. Before that can happen, however, Latinos who hold elected or 
appointed offices must become familiar with one another. 
</P>
<P>
There are now 30 Latinos in elected offices at the city, county and judicial 
level in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Platform Adopted 
</P>
<P>
"If nothing else, at least many of the Latino leaders in this county had a 
chance to meet one another," Vasquez said after the private luncheon at La 
Brasserie in Orange. Eighteen Latino officials were there. "Literally, we had 
some situations" at the luncheon, Vasquez said, "where people didn't know the 
person across the table from them." 
</P>
<P>
The group, called the Latino Elected and Appointed Officials of Orange County, 
unanimously adopted a nine-point platform Thursday intended to expand the 
"Hispanic political base and the Hispanic agenda" in the county, according to a 
statement released by the group. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Latinos made up 15% of Orange County's population. By 1987, nearly 24% 
of the county's 2.2 million residents were Latino. But the numbers of Latinos 
on school boards and city councils and also in key administrative posts have 
not kept pace, Latino officials contend. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, for example, Latinos account for more than 50% of the city's 
225,000 residents, yet only two of the seven seats on the City Council are held 
by Latinos. The disparity is even greater for the city's school board. Eighty 
percent of the 41,000 students in the Santa Ana Unified School District are 
Latino, yet only one of the five school board members is Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Latino community leaders place part of the blame on Latinos themselves for not 
being more aggressive and better organized. Correcting that situation, they 
said, was one of the reasons for forming the new group. Another of its 
objectives is to provide role models for young Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
"Because we are elected officials, we are role models for the Hispanic 
community," said Sal Mendoza, a member of the Santa Ana school district board. 
"We have a responsibility to network as Hispanic leaders to create more 
opportunities for other Hispanics." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana City Councilman Miguel Pulido emphasized that education will be a top 
priority for the group. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the high dropout rate for Latino students, Pulido said Latino 
officials "have an obligation above and beyond other elected officials' " to 
encourage young people to stay in school. That message, he said, should be 
carried by the newly formed group. 
</P>
<P>
Because the group is nonpartisan, Vasquez said, there are no plans to designate 
specific school boards or cities for the election of Latinos.

SECRET SERVICE OFFERS REWARD IN AGENT'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Secret Service announced Thursday that it is offering a $100,000 
reward for information leading to the indictment of the killers of a special 
agent who was shot to death in Los Angeles nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the reward in the murder of Secret Service Agent Julie Y. 
Cross was timed to coincide with a televised re-creation of the killing 
scheduled to be broadcast on NBC's "Unsolved Mysteries" next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Cross -- described by officials as the first female federal law enforcement 
officer killed in the line of duty -- was fatally shot during an apparent 
robbery attempt on June 4, 1980, while she was on surveillance duty on a 
counterfeiting case near Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
After shooting Cross with a shotgun, her attackers wounded her partner, who 
survived and provided descriptions of the assailants. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite extraordinary efforts by the Los Angeles Police Department and the 
Secret Service, the assailants still remain unidentified," said Robert R. Snow, 
a Secret Service official in Washington. "We are appealing to the public for 
any information which would solve this tragic homicide." 
</P>
<P>
Richard J. Griffin, special agent in charge of the Los Angeles office of the 
Secret Service, said he believes the case will be solved as a result of the 
reward and the publicity that next week's television show is expected to 
generate. Griffin said rewards were offered twice earlier in the case, but 
withdrawn when they failed to produce any investigative breakthroughs. 
</P>
<P>
He said anyone with information about the murder should contact the Secret 
Service in Los Angeles at (213) 894-4830.

CONVICTION REVERSED IN SLAYING OF WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal appeals court on Thursday reversed the conviction of a South-Central 
Los Angeles man for the shotgun murder of a U.S. postal worker as she was 
delivering mail to his house. 
</P>
<P>
Ruling that the trial judge improperly admitted evidence of the defendant's 
past violent acts, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously ordered a 
new trial for Kerry Lynn Brown, who is serving a life sentence for the 
first-degree murder conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 28, was found guilty by a federal jury of the April 26, 1986, killing of 
mail carrier Dale J. Hooker, a 12-year postal employee who was struck by a 
single shotgun blast as she stood on the porch of Brown's parents' home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defense Strategy 
</P>
<P>
Brown himself had been shot in the jaw by an unidentified assailant three weeks 
before the killing. His lawyer attempted to mount a diminished capacity 
defense, arguing that Brown had an honest but unreasonable belief that he was 
in danger and had a mental problem stemming from the earlier shooting. 
</P>
<P>
To counter the defense claims, prosecutors introduced evidence that Brown had 
been involved in two earlier wrongful acts. They said he fired shots into the 
home of an acquaintance and, on another occasion, armed with a loaded rifle, 
placed his finger on the trigger and approached an acquaintance, demanding that 
he return a handgun that he had allegedly taken from Brown. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon had not allowed prosecutors to present all 
the evidence they wanted to. For instance, the jury never heard that Brown 
subsequently shot the acquaintance, Louis Lee, to death at point-blank range 
and served three years in the California Youth Authority for involuntary 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
They prosecution was also barred from disclosing that in 1979, Brown allegedly 
tried to rob a Department of Motor Vehicles office by presenting a note that 
said: "This is a robbery. Don't make it a murder." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Evidence Improper 
</P>
<P>
Still, in an opinion written by Judge Edward Leavy, a three-judge panel held 
that the evidence of prior wrongful acts that was presented was improper. Such 
evidence is not admissible when it shows only that a defendant has a bad 
character and is therefore more likely to have committed a crime, the court 
said. Rather, the judges said, the evidence would have to show that Brown was 
more likely to have intended to murder the postal carrier. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. David Katz, who prosecuted the case, said he did not know 
whether the government will appeal. "It's very sad for the family (of Hooker), 
because a retrial would be very hard on them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was the second major setback this week for Judge Kenyon. On 
Tuesday, the appeals court reversed the conviction of Richard W. Miller, a 
former FBI agent who had been convicted after two trials in Kenyon's court on 
charges of passing secrets to a Soviet spy. 
</P>
<P>
Once the appeals court's order becomes final, Brown's lawyer could move to have 
him freed on bail.

JOYNER FEELS A WARMING TREND APPROACHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angel Manager Doug Rader was watching Wally Joyner take batting practice the 
other day when someone asked if he had detected the struggling first baseman's 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"He's in a slump," Rader deadpanned. 
</P>
<P>
Could he be more specific? 
</P>
<P>
"OK. A bad slump," Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
But seriously, was he expecting Joyner, a career .290 hitter, to catch fire at 
any moment. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just hoping he'll catch warm," Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
And that, folks, was serious. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner, who was in a four-for-31 deep freeze going into Thursday night's game 
against Detroit, finally might be in a thawing trend. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, Joyner ended speculation on how long his eight-month home run 
drought would last, slamming a two-run shot into the seats in right field in 
the fourth inning of the Angels' 10-3 victory over the Tigers at Anaheim 
Stadium. The homer tied the score, 3-3, after the Tigers had taken a 3-0 lead 
in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner's most recent home run was Sept. 1, 1988 and -- counting spring training 
-- he had gone to the plate 256 times without hitting one out of the park since 
then. Rader has said all along that he isn't overly concerned, but those Wally 
World fans who watched Joyner belt 20 homers before the All-Star break in 1986 
have to be wondering about the power outage. 
</P>
<P>
"The most pleasing thing was to see Wally really turn on the ball and get the 
home run," Rader said. "That's one burden he no longer has to carry. The next 
one will come a lot easier." 
</P>
<P>
Joyner said he hadn't thought much about his lack of homers -- "I wasn't 
counting at-bats," he says -- but some of those feeble waves of the bat that 
were passing as his hitting stroke were beginning to weigh on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"It wears on you," Joyner admitted. "When you're in a slump, you just don't 
have a good approach to hitting. I was very uncomfortable up there and I was 
swinging at some bad pitches. When you can lay off the pitcher's pitches, the 
balls and the borderline strikes, then your pitches will come. That's what 
happened tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Joyner, who has had a hit in each of the last four games, says he feels as if 
he's breaking out. He's certainly worked at it, watching old videotapes of when 
he was in a groove (Remember that week in April of 1987 when he hit .480 with 
five home runs and 13 RBIs in seven games?) and taking extra batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I'm one-for-four in fast starts," said Joyner, whose lifetime 
batting average in April is .274. "I got off to a slow start last year. 
Hopefully, what we've done this week will get things going. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've finally got my swing corrected. I've been hitting the ball with 
a lot more authority the last few games." 
</P>
<P>
Rader, however, thinks slumps are more a matter of the mind than the 
mechanical. 
</P>
<P>
"Slumps are mostly mental," Rader said. "If you think you can hit, you usually 
can. If you have any doubts, you generally don't. When you're going bad, every 
negative emotion runs through your head. You just don't want to be embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
"You may try to be outwardly aggressive, but something inside holds you back, 
makes you tentative. But one thing about Wally, he wasn't fighting himself that 
much, which most guys do when they're in a slump. He was dealing with it pretty 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Monday night, Joyner was booed by the once-adoring Big A fans after striking 
out with a particularly sorry swing. He admitted that he "recognized" their 
displeasure and managed to rationalize . . . even joke about his momentary fall 
from grace. 
</P>
<P>
"They can do what they want and I have to continue to come out here and work 
hard," he said. "Anyway, I didn't think they were booing me. I thought Donnie 
Moore had walked in somewhere."

MAI TARGET REPORTS $5-MILLION QUARTERLY LOSS; 
</P>
<P>
PRIME COMPUTER TIES RED INK TO TAKEOVER FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID OLMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Computer Inc. said Thursday that it lost $5 million in its latest quarter 
and blamed the red ink on the cost of fighting a hostile takeover bid by MAI 
Basic Four Inc. of Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
The Natick, Mass., minicomputer maker said the loss for its fiscal 1990 first 
quarter, which ended April 3, includes a $6.3-million charge for expenses 
incurred in defending itself against MAI's $1.3-billion takeover offer. 
</P>
<P>
Prime reported revenue of $387 million for the quarter, an increase of 6% over 
the corresponding period a year earlier. The first-quarter loss compares with 
earnings of $14.5 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
MAI launched its $20-a-share tender offer for Prime's stock last November. If 
the Orange County firm manages to take over Prime, the transaction would rank 
as one of the computer industry's biggest acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
The offer has been on hold since December, when a federal judge in Boston 
issued an injunction blocking the bid on the grounds that MAI and its 
investment banker, Drexel Burnham Lambert, had made inadequate financial 
disclosures. The judge recently said he will lift the injunction if Drexel 
provides certain financial information to Prime shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, MAI said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
that it will enter into a confidentiality agreement it has previously rejected 
if another bidder tops its $20-a-share offer for Prime. 
</P>
<P>
Prime, which has fiercely resisted MAI's bid and termed the $20-a-share 
offering price inadequate, recently said it is seeking other offers for the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
In an April 27 letter from MAI Chairman Bennett S. LeBow to Prime Chairman 
David J. Dunn, LeBow said it is unlikely a higher bidder will emerge without 
access to confidential information provided by Prime, according to the SEC 
filing. 
</P>
<P>
"We are clearly the logical party to top (a rival bid), assuming you have 
supplied us with the same information and good-faith cooperation," LeBow wrote 
in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
MAI previously had refused to sign a confidentiality agreement with Prime.

SAN DIEGO FIRM'S AUDIOCASSETTES TURN NEWSLETTER INDUSTRY ON ITS EAR

<P>
When most corporate executives realize their company is headed for disaster, 
they worry. They fret about their futures; they suffer high anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
But when then-Senior Vice President Vicki Krantz learned that Central Savings 
&amp; Loan Assn. would inevitably be a casualty of the great shakeout in the 
thrift industry, she reacted differently. Although she knew the end of her job 
was in sight in 1985 when it became clear that Central would have to be 
acquired by a healthier institution, she kept calm. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a wonderful experience," Krantz said of the period before Central's 
demise and acquisition by Coast Savings in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increased Responsibility 
</P>
<P>
As the situation at Central was worsening, making it harder to attract new 
executives, Krantz, 42, who had joined the company as vice president and 
personnel director in 1978, assumed increasing responsibility. By 1985, she was 
in charge of Central's 50-plus branches and was chief executive officer of the 
bank's luxury hotel development at Lake Arrowhead. 
</P>
<P>
Those duties put her on the road a lot. While driving in her BMW 733, she often 
thought about the work she had left at the office, particularly the mountains 
of reading she had to complete to stay abreast of developments in human 
resources, perhaps her most important responsibility as Central's business 
wound down. If only she could read in the car or have the information recorded 
so she could listen while driving. 
</P>
<P>
One day it occurred to her that, when her job at Central ended, she could 
produce a newsletter on audiocassette summarizing the key issues facing human 
resource professionals. As a past president of the Personnel Management Assn. 
of San Diego, a former district representative to the American Society of 
Personnel Administration and a personnel executive at RCA and May Co. before 
coming to Central, she certainly had the proper credentials. 
</P>
<P>
True, she didn't know anything about audio publishing, but she felt she could 
learn, having majored in journalism at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
So, when Central's struggle finally came to a close in 1986, Krantz took her 
$40,000 completion bonus for staying to the bitter end and set up Professional 
NewsScan in her home in Solana Beach. She gave herself 2 months to see whether 
the concept would work. 
</P>
<P>
It did. Now, with more than 2,000 subscribers paying $144 a year for a dozen 
45-minute summaries on human resource issues -- culled from the trade and 
general business press -- Krantz has carved a small but unusual niche in the 
burgeoning field of audio publishing. The company was profitable after 18 
months, and Krantz hopes to double its subscriber base this year. In addition 
to four regular news categories concentrating on legislation and legal 
developments, each tape covers 10 to 12 topics such as age discrimination and 
severance-pay plans. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing Krantz did was write a business plan. Working with her husband, 
Fred -- now a management consultant but formerly a vice president and general 
manager at General Dynamics Electronics Division and Topaz Electronics -- she 
calculated the price she would have to charge to have a viable business. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Studio Located 
</P>
<P>
Next, she turned to the Yellow Pages to find local recording studios, quizzing 
them on how to produce professional-quality audiotape. She eventually struck a 
deal with Lightning Corp. in Kearny Mesa, where, she said, employees "were 
ready to roll up their sleeves to help out." 
</P>
<P>
Then she began to read. She reviewed 90 magazines, ranging from the Academy of 
Management Journal to Working Mother, and wrote a script summarizing human 
resource issues in the news that month. She said she spends more than $5,000 a 
year on subscriptions to periodicals. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1986, at a cost of more than $9,000, Krantz sent 5,000 sample tapes 
to members of the American Society for Personnel Administration. What followed 
was "the longest two weeks of my life, waiting to see what would come back," 
Krantz recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Although the returns, at nearly 2%, were not overwhelming, they fell into the 
range she had predicted in her business plan. "Then we knew we had a business," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
What Krantz didn't know was that the business she had entered could be on the 
brink of significant growth. According to Seth Gershel, director of sales for 
Simon &amp; Schuster's audio division and the organizer of the Audio Publishers 
Assn., audio publishing (which most people know as books on tape) has had 
double-digit growth for 3 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Big Business' 
</P>
<P>
"It is big business," said Mark Hinckley, editor of Magazine and Bookseller 
magazine, a trade publication that has tracked the industry for three years. 
"And the potential seems greater." 
</P>
<P>
According to Publishers Weekly, another trade magazine, commonly accepted 
research indicates that audio publishing is a $100-million industry evenly 
divided between retail sales and direct mail. Audio versions of best-selling 
fiction represent about 41% of the market. Business information represents 
about 11%. 
</P>
<P>
"We think those numbers are low," said Paul Houston, president of ManagersEdge 
Corp. in Denver, which markets audiotapes, including Krantz's, to senior 
executives of small and medium-size companies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not That Ambitious 
</P>
<P>
Houston believes that more than 500,000 people a year buy business-oriented 
audiotapes through the mail. The acknowledged market leader is Chicago's 
Nightingale-Conant, with revenues of $40 million. "The total market is at least 
$60 million to $70 million," Houston said. ManagersEdge has 11,000 subscribers, 
and Houston foresees a total potential customer base of 60,000. 
</P>
<P>
Krantz, who reads for the cassettes herself, is not that ambitious. There are 
about 40,000 human resource professionals in the country, she noted. 
</P>
<P>
She said she would be content with 5,000 subscribers, and wants to have 4,000 
within the next year. 
</P>
<P>
Busy commuters who want to make maximum use of their time represent the best 
target audience for audio publishing products, according to Houston. "Our 
biggest competitor is probably car phones," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Krantz is prepared to compete with those. Nearly 90% of her listeners say they 
listen to the tapes while in their car. The national average commute time is 22 
minutes, Krantz said, the approximate length of each side of her tapes. 
</P>
<P>
"I listen to and from work," said Dee Tielhet, personnel section manager at 
Hewlett-Packard in San Diego. "I live about 20 minutes away from the office." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Others Listen Too 
</P>
<P>
Her department of 16 people is responsible for the human resource needs of 
1,500 Hewlett-Packard employees. When Tielhet finishes listening to a cassette, 
she passes it on to others in the department. ManagersEdge research indicates 
that, for every subscriber to such tapes, two more people listen. 
</P>
<P>
Bea Betterton, personnel director of the YMCA of San Diego County, lives just 
15 minutes from her workplace. But she listens to Professional NewsScan when 
she travels from branch to branch for meetings. N. Bruce Ferris, manager of 
personnel and employee relations at Maxwell Laboratories, listens on his way to 
and from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Why do they listen? 
</P>
<P>
"It is a unique, super service," according to Ferris. 
</P>
<P>
Krantz's tapes cover some of the most sensitive issues confronting corporate 
America today: managing health-care benefits, dealing with AIDS, new federal 
guidelines to ensure a drug-free workplace.

Cinco de Mayo is coming, when all good Mexican restaurants celebrate the 
ousting of the French from Puebla in the late 19th Century. Las Brisas in 
Laguna Beach will present a "warm-up" party May 4 with complimentary hors 
d'oeuvres and dancing; there will also be festivities there on May 5 itself. . 
. . Cano's in Newport Beach will be jumping both days, too, as the restaurant 
brings on the mariachis, a complimentary buffet, and food and cocktail 
specials. . . . On the 5th only, Peppers in Garden Grove will offer drink 
specials and a free Mexican buffet, and the Hacienda in Santa Ana will open 
early (4 p.m.) for cocktails, help-yourself, Southwestern/Mexican hors 
d'oeuvres, games and dinner, all to a mariachi beat. 
</P>
<P>
AND THE WINNERS ARE: More than 170 Orange County restaurants won accolades at 
the Southern California Restaurant Writers' awards dinner April 9 at the 
Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles. However, the creme de la creme -- the Golden 
Sceptre awards, reserved for "the grandest of the grand" -- went to a select 
four: Antoine at Le Meridien Hotel in Newport Beach; JW's at the Anaheim 
Marriott hotel; The Wine Cellar in Newport Beach and Antonello Ristorante in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County winners of Golden Bacchus awards for superb wine lists and wine 
service are the Bouzy Rouge, Newport Beach; the Cellar, Fullerton; Chez Cary, 
Orange; Five Crowns, Corona del Mar, and Mr. Stox, Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
CHANGING COURSES: Mongkut Thai presents "authentic Thai" cuisine at the site of 
the old Savories in Laguna Beach. It's the second Mongkut Thai for owner 
Siriwan Laitipaya; his restaurant in San Clemente has been "so busy, customers 
wanted us to open another." 
</P>
<P>
Fritz Rechberger and Diane Hickling have sold A'la Carte Bistro in Huntington 
Beach to Martyn Sells. Rechberger and Hickling move on to ownership of a 
B&amp;B near the Korbel Winery in the Sonoma area (and yes, they'll serve 
dinner there), while Sells promises that any changes at A'la Carte will be 
"evolutionary, not revolutionary -- changes of style, not substance." His plans 
include an English/California (lots of fruit) afternoon tea. 
</P>
<P>
The Restaurant at Cameron Court replaces the Court House in Santa Ana. New 
owner Jonas Stoltzfus says his emphasis is on upgrading the service, with some 
changes planned in cuisine, accenting fine continental. 
</P>
<P>
There's a new sign and new owners at the former Sabatino's in Capistrano Beach. 
The name is now Ristorante Agostino, with the DiFante family (father Luigi, 
sons Gino and Agostino) orchestrating lunch and dinner. The DiFantes come from 
just south of Rome, so the cuisine is central Italian. The ocean-view 
restaurant differs from Agostino in South Laguna, which is owned by the same 
family but functions primarily as a take-out. 
</P>
<P>
A new Texas Loosey's is open on Beach Boulevard in Westminster, featuring 
barbecue, Mexican fare and gourmet burgers. 
</P>
<P>
And Tony Montella, part-owner of the late Metropolitan Grill in Irvine, is now 
maitre d' at the Arches in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
NO CHANGE: It's business as usual at Hemingway's in Corona del Mar, even though 
the restaurant has filed under Chapter 11 bankruptcy laws for protection from 
its creditors. Owner Randy Johnson says he filed because of financial problems 
in fiscal 1986, stemming from "problems with employees and the internal 
accounting system and other restaurant partnerships that took me away from 
daily mangement. We generated profit in '87, '88 and," he predicts "will for 
'89." Johnson says he is still offering the same range of food, with dinner 
entrees from $16 to $24. Louis Manginelli, who was his chef for 8 1/2 years, is 
back on a part-time/consulting basis. 
</P>
<P>
NEW AND/OR DIFFERENT: The Glider Inn in Seal Beach has introduced early-bird, 
complete dinners, tabbed at $5.95 (fettucini Alfredo), $7.95 (seafood crepes, 
halibut almondine and more), and $9.95 (prime rib) . . . Gandhi Indian Cuisine 
in Santa Ana has expanded its menu and lowered its prices. Among the new 
offerings: aloo chat, tandoori fish tikka, shrimp biryani . . . Bayou St. John 
in Seal Beach is now open for lunch Tuesdays through Saturdays. Poor boy 
sandwiches, homemade clam chowder and pecan chicken salad is available, along 
with four daily specials at $5 or less, three other salads and three additional 
soups. 
</P>
<P>
WHAT'S COOKING: Mr. Stox in Anaheim will present a class on barbecuing and 
smoking May 10 at 10 am. $35. (714) 634-2994. 
</P>
<P>
The Royal Thai in Newport Beach has scheduled Monday evening cooking classes on 
June 5, 12, 19 and 26, at 6:30 p.m. $30 per class. (714) 645-THAI. 
</P>
<P>
SMOKE RINGS: The good news for both cigar smokers and nonsmokers is that the 
Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point has inaugurated a "smoker room," designating its 
wood-paneled library (where afternoon tea is poured) as a haven for those who 
wish to light up after dinner. Cordials, desserts and coffee are available 
there nightly from 8 to 12. 
</P>
<P>
AND ALL THAT JAZZ: Just Like Perry's, the seafood restaurant on the lake in 
Mission Viejo, will present live jazz this Sunday from 2 to 5 p.m. to help 
raise money for KSRB, Saddleback College's all-jazz radio station which is 
holdings its annual fund-raising campaign this week. Cover charge: $5.

The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Pinnacle Peak, 9100 Trask Ave., Garden Grove. (714) 892-7311. Open Mondays 
through Fridays 5 p.m. to 9:30 p.m., weekends till 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Crazy Horse Steak House, 1580 Brookhollow Dr., Santa Ana. (714) 549-1512. Open 
Mondays through Fridays 11 a.m. to 2 a.m., Saturdays and Sundays 5 p.m. to 2 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
While everyone else is busy disavowing addiction to good steak, sneak off to 
one of these places. Leave the tie at home when you visit Pinnacle Peak; 
someone will sneak up on you and cut it off. Honest. The restaurant's trail 
boss steak, cooked over an open flame, is a char-broiled monster, a great value 
at $9.95. The Crazy Horse is a bit longer on atmosphere but, apart from the 
high-grade beef, it's run-of-the-mill. Many of the side dishes have been 
frozen, and the whole place has a packaged feel about it. 
</P>
<P>
Garduno's Ristorante Italiano, 298 E. 17th St., Costa Mesa. (714) 645-5505. 
Open Mondays through Thursdays 11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Fridays till 10 p.m., 
Saturdays noon to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Garduno's may be the quintessential Italian sidewalk cafe-except the sidewalk 
is missing. Mark and Julie Garduno, an engaging young couple, run the place as 
if it was a small family room, serving fresh, home-cooked fare that often 
delights. Standout dishes include a killer carbonara loaded with fresh peas, 
pancetta and sauteed mushrooms; and a fabulous fusilli, twirly pasta spirals in 
a chunky tomato sauce with big pieces of homemade sausage. The regular menu has 
all the favorites, the cappuccino is frothy, and there are wonderful creamy 
cheesecakes to boot. 
</P>
<P>
California Wok, 4466 Cerritos Ave., Los Alamitos. (714) 527-0226. Open Mondays 
through Thursdays 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Eat health conscious, pan-Asian food in this spotless little gem, owned and 
operated by a Thai microbiologist who is a gem herself (her name, Baiyok, means 
jade leaf.) Chinese dishes here are excellent, prepared with pure soy oil. 
Especially good are vegetarian egg rolls, and stir fried chicken in an edible 
basket of straw potato. Thai dishes are equally fine. Nam sod is fiery ground 
pork with chili. Pad Thai are fried flat noodles. And tod mun plar, rubbery 
fish cakes with mint and cilantro, are wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
The Cellar at Villa Del Sol, 305 N. Harbor Blvd., Fullerton. (714) 525-5682. 
Open Tuesdays through Saturdays 6 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Cellar is one of those "occasion restaurants" in the grand manner; whatever 
the kitchen lacks in imagination is made up for handsomely by quality and 
consistency. Pass on the ready-made items like smoked salmon, caviar and the 
various salads. They miss the point. The chef here can cook. See that he does. 
Best are lamb, pheasant, veal Florentine and the ethereal desserts. The 
souffles, naturally, are perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Far Pavilions, 1520 W. Coast Highway, Newport Beach. (714) 548-7167. Open seven 
days, 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., 5 to 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Elegant, beachfront Indian dining. Far Pavilions has a surfeit of specialties 
hard to find in other local restaurants: minced chicken balls in a spicy tomato 
puree; bhindi masala, a.k.a. curried okra; Bihari kabab, a saucy chicken dish 
from north central India. Some flavors run together here, but you can avoid 
that problem by sandwiching dishes in the fine tandoori breads from the 
restaurant's clay oven. Meats from the same oven are so good they should be 
eaten bareheaded, kneeling. 
</P>
<P>
Caliente, 1910 Main St., Irvine. (714) 975-1220. Open seven days, 11 a.m. to 10 
p.m., to 11 on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Caliente is Spanish for hot, and that is exactly what this stylish new 
restaurant is. It's the latest jewel in the El Torito crown, and its modest 
adobe exterior conceals a stunning design -- a faint red, '80s-chic motif 
complete with dramatic lighting, an open kitchen, and a comal, the high-tech 
version of a stone tortilla cooker. The restaurant smokes its own meats, and 
you can wash them down with premium margaritas made from vintage tequila. 
Desserts, such as burnt cream and apple crisp, are wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
Rutabegorz, 211 N. Pomona Ave., Fullerton (714) 738-9339 and 158 W. Main St., 
Tustin (714) 731-9807. Open seven days, 11 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greenery Natural Kitchen, 119 E. Commonwealth Ave., Fullerton (714) 
870-0981 and 323 S. Magnolia Ave., Anaheim (714) 761-8103. Open Monday through 
Fridays, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., Saturdays 10 to 5. 
</P>
<P>
Rutabegorz in Fullerton looks as if it belongs on a college campus; the food 
they serve does too. Best avoid the frozen poultry casseroles in favor of the 
meatless dishes like stuffed squash or veggie lasagna. Desserts like carrot 
cake and apple pie are reminiscent of a church bake sale. 
</P>
<P>
The Greenery is a modest, unadorned storefront restaurant with homey, 
health-conscious fare. Best dishes are the lentil burrito, with guacamole, and 
the unburger, made from ground nuts and brown rice. 
</P>
<P>
Both restaurants are inexpensive, with few dishes over $5. 
</P>
<P>
Five Feet, 328 Glenneyre St., Laguna Beach. (714) 497-4955. Open Mondays 
through Thursdays 5 to 10 p.m., to 11 Fridays through Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Michael Kang has some of the most compelling art around decorating this 
restaurant's somber, postmodern walls, and he serves plates of food very nearly 
as artful. Dishes of pot stickers or steamed dumpling are no better than you 
would get in any Chinese restaurant, but the eclectic lamb, scallop, and 
catfish entrees demonstrate Kang's flair. The catfish is particularly fine. 
</P>
<P>
Crocodile Cafe in the Brea Marketplace, 975 E. Birch St., Brea. (714) 529-CAFE. 
Open seven days 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., to 12 on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Smith is doing more than just promoting the new American cuisine; he's 
making it into a populist movement at this small, laughably inexpensive cafe. 
Enjoy wonderful hamburgers grilled over smoking embers of oak, wood-fired 
pizzas with designer toppings, and trendy homemade pastas like fettucine with 
roasted Pasilla chili and ancho-cream. Sit under the 30-foot vinyl crocodile 
sipping boutique wines. You can bet your Beamer that this restaurant is a good 
value. 
</P>
<P>
Almagreb, 23700 El Toro Road, in the Saddleback Valley Plaza, El Toro. (714) 
859-9393. Open Tuesdays through Sundays 6 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Almagreb, a Moroccan restaurant in El Toro, has one of the most dramatic 
dining areas anywhere: clustered tent canopies among a maze of mirrors with an 
almost mystical dimension. Meals are taken in the traditional style, with no 
utensils, and are finger-licking good. Among the better offerings: b'stilla (a 
sugar-dusted chicken pie), couscous (cracked semolina wheat in a savory 
vegetable stew), and Tanya, belly dancer extraordinaire. The Arabic music 
accompanying her is deafening. 
</P>
<P>
Thien Thanh, 5423 W. 1st St., Santa Ana. (714) 554-7260. Open weekdays 10 a.m. 
to 10:30 p.m., weekends until 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Thien Thanh is more than just one of the area's best restaurants: It is a 
crossroad of Vietnamese and American culture: The crowd is as diverse as the 
menu. Cua rang muoi (cooked salted crab) and bo dam (garlic-centered beef) are 
two dishes not to miss, but lighter appetites can indulge in more than 50 
noodle dishes. While away the day listening to Asian pop music, gawking at the 
New Wavers and sipping filter coffee and tropical freezes made from durian and 
jackfruit.

TUTTOMARE IS PLANNING TO CHANGE ITS MENU OFTEN -- AND THAT'S WELCOME NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Spectrum Foods may not be a household name, but chances are that one of its 
many upscale restaurants is: Prego, MacArthur Park and Chianti are just three 
on Spectrum's growing list of successful ventures. That's why it's puzzling 
that Tuttomare, the company's newest restaurant, should be so rough around the 
edges. 
</P>
<P>
It's not for lack of trying. Many of Spectrum's innovations (e.g., hanging 
pastas, the Grissini bread sticks on every table) are missing, but the usual 
staff espirit de corps is apparent in everyone from the bus boy to the general 
manager. Enzo de Muro, a Spectrum veteran, is running the dining room with 
style. I heard the waiter at the next table say that he had come down from San 
Francisco just because de Muro would be his boss. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant is in the building that formerly housed Savannah Grill, and all 
the beautiful character of that dining room has been retained: deeply hued 
wooden columns, elaborate French windows, a long and luxuriously crafted bar 
and a stunning inlaid marble floor. 
</P>
<P>
Add touches like wonderful Art Deco-style posters, blue lights and an open 
kitchen with a tile tangle of bas-relief crustaceans above it, and the result 
is richly appealing. No wonder the restaurant has been standing room only on 
weekends since the first week it opened. 
</P>
<P>
The name Tuttomare means "everything from the sea." I'd say this was an odd 
choice. Apart from the inclusion of whole baked fish and an extra seafood salad 
or two, the restaurant's menu resembles almost any current palaccio of "la 
nuova cucina." But as our solicitous waiter pointed out, "we plan to change the 
menu quite often." 
</P>
<P>
I hope they change it soon; only a few dishes made a strong impression on me. 
One that did was the wonderful, yeasty focaccia bread that is brought as soon 
as you are seated. Tiny cruets of pale green olive oil and pungent balsamic 
vinegar sit on the tables, and you may find yourself eating far too much bread, 
using the oil and vinegar as dipping sauces. 
</P>
<P>
An excellent insalata di mare, a simple seafood salad with olive oil and lemon, 
provided a fine foil for the bread. The salad is composed of raw scallop, baby 
octopus, fresh prawn, cold steamed mussels and sliced green olive. 
</P>
<P>
Pomodoro e mozzarella al pesto -- bufala mozzarella with sliced tomato -- was a 
disappointment. The tomatoes and subtle pesto were delightful, but the dish was 
ruined by dry, tasteless cheese. I've had this same dish at Prego and loved it, 
so perhaps the cheese just had a bad night. I hold little hope, however, for 
the Belgian endive, radicchio and arugula salad -- a plain bowl of cut 
vegetables with absolutely no embellishment. Without dressing, garnish or 
presentation, it looked like lunch for a Park Avenue pet rabbit. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen gets fancier when it comes to pastas, but that doesn't necessarily 
mean better. Sea bass gnocchi were all flour and, despite a wonderful tomato 
sauce with clams, too gummy to finish. Ravioli filled with spinach and ricotta 
were annoyingly grainy, and orecchiette alla Barese, advertised as ear-shaped 
pasta with wild broccoli, were utterly flavorless. 
</P>
<P>
 Triangoli di pesce, black and white triangles filled with fish in a garlic and 
tomato sauce, were better, delicate and savory with a sweet aftertaste. And 
paglia e fieno (literally straw and hay), green and white noodles in a butter, 
cream and Parmesan sauce, was pleasing, although the pasta was too sticky. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondi, or main dishes, are mostly quite good. The whole sea bass was baked 
in the restaurant's wood oven so that it had sweet, smoky overtones and crisply 
charred skin. Spedini di gamberi, grilled skewered prawns, were even better, so 
skillfully grilled on mesquite that it was easy to overlook the watery, 
unappetizing cannellini beans underneath them. Best of all was lombata di 
vitello, a fat veal chop with prosciutto and Fontina cheese, a trencherman's 
version of saltimbocca. Sausage with polenta was forgettable: The polenta 
tasted like Cream of Wheat a la griglia. 
</P>
<P>
The vegetables were particularly annoying. All the main dishes come with a huge 
pile of roughly cut boiled squash and broccoli without butter or seasoning. To 
have to pay for something like this is a major irritation. 
</P>
<P>
Soothe yourself, as we did, with the good desserts. Vanilla bean ice cream with 
sliced berries was terrific, as was crostata al limone, a racy lemon tart with 
frothy, sweet meringue atop it. Tirami su -- that ubiquitous dessert of 
ladyfingers with espresso, mascarpone cheese, Marsala wine and powdered cocoa 
-- was not so distinguished; the ladyfingers were stale. 
</P>
<P>
And that's the problem with Tuttomare: the basic ingredients are fine, but 
occasionally the food seems a little tired. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttomare is high-end moderate. Antipasti are $4.50 to $7.95. Soups and pastas 
are $3.50 to $10.50. Secondi are $9.75 to $19.50 (for whole fish). Desserts are 
$3.75 to $4.95.

THERE'S NO EXCUSE, ARTS GRINCHES, FOR MISSING 'A NIGHT IN FULLERTON'S' LOCAL 
TALENT 
</P>

Art cranks, beware. Organizers of "A Night in Fullerton" -- tonight's 4-hour 
showcase of music, dance, drama and visual art at a dozen-plus venues around 
the city -- are about to spoil your best excuses for skipping the local arts 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
You say tickets to county arts events are too expensive? All performances and 
exhibits at "A Night in Fullerton" are free. You say traffic is too heavy and 
parking is impossible? Ample parking is available at most sites, plus free 
shuttle bus service is offered among sites. You say long performances are 
boring? Most of the performances for this event will be snack size, some 
running just 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
You say "The Jim Henson Hour" is on tonight? Hey, Kermit's a performer, he'll 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
According to founder Dorian Hunter, "A Night in Fullerton" was begun in 1965 as 
a way to "heighten people's awareness of the arts (and to) let them know this 
kind of thing goes on all year in our community." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, annual attendance has grown from 1,500 to an expected 25,000 for 
tonight's 25th anniversary celebration. 
</P>
<P>
The evening's format gives a new meaning to the words "traveling show." From 7 
to 11 p.m., guests can travel from site to site, taking in everything from

BREEDING BIRDS: ANNA'S HUMMINGBIRD; 
</P>
<P>
ANNA'S HUMMINGBIRD (CALYPTE ANNA) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Description: Male's head and throat are deep rose red. Female's throat usually 
shows red flecks, often forming a patch of color. Underparts are grayish in 
both sexes, mixed with varying amounts of green. Back is an irridescent green 
in both sexes. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat: Open woodland, chaparral, gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Diet: Primarily nectar, also spiders and tree sap. 
</P>
<P>
Displays: Male flight traces arc of vertical circle before female; rising very 
high, plummets downward making chirp sound at lowest point, then rises straight 
above female, 
</P>
<P>
hovers and faces her at top of ascent, delivering brief squeaky song. 
</P>
<P>
Nest: The cup-shaped nest is built in oak, vine, brush and human-built 
structures. It is thick and made of plant down bound with spiders' silk, lined 
with plant down and feathers. Building continues after the eggs are laid. 
</P>
<P>
Eggs: White, unmarked; about one-half inch long. 
</P>
<P>
Natural history notes: Once these birds wintered primarily in Mexico, but 
widespread planting of eucalyptus and cultivation of year-round garden flowers 
have led to permanent residency by many birds in coastal California. It is the 
most common and widespread of Orange County's hummingbirds.

STYLE: ESTHER WILLIAMS OFFERS SWIMSUITS TO LURE MATURE WOMEN BACK IN THE WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN NEWELL YOUNG, Karen Newell Young is a regular contributor to Orange 
County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It happens every spring. The weather warms up. The clothing racks begin to 
bloom with swimsuits and thoughts turn to that depressing chore: choosing what 
to wear in the water. 
</P>
<P>
Mature women often find slim pickings. The tops are low-cut, the bottoms are 
high-cut and a hankie would hide more than some of the suits. Little strings 
tied together are designed more for perfect bodies in repose than older women 
who want to go swimming. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with such skimpy choices, some women just stayed out of the water. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the legendary queen of chlorine, Esther Williams, is hoping to nudge these 
women back into the pool with her new swimsuit line, called the Esther Williams 
Collection for Misty Swimwear (a division of Los Angeles-based Excelsior Inc.). 
The collection is available in the county at The Broadway, Bullock's and May 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
Unveiled locally at a recent fashion show at Crystal Court's Broadway, the 
collection of 96 one- and two-piece suits (ranging in price from $38 to $66) 
includes some modern full-cut designs and some "retro" (i.e., old-fashioned) 
looks with shirred midriffs, halter tops and high waists -- the kind of styles 
that kept Williams slick in such aquatic musicals as "Dangerous When Wet" and 
"Neptune's Daughter." 
</P>
<P>
"Women don't have to be hanging out of their suits like their daughters 
anymore," Williams said at The Broadway show. "I've been working over a year 
with Misty on these suits. We went over my scrapbooks and discussed what worked 
for me and what worked when it was wet." 
</P>
<P>
Trim and glowing in a royal blue jacket, red blouse and white skirt, Williams 
told the women watching the slim models that the suits were designed for women 
of all ages and sizes, as much for the imperfect as the perfect. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand your bodies," said the veteran of 26 MGM pictures. "I know what 
will stay put. I know what swimming has done for my life, and I want it to be 
the same for you. I want you to go in the water." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, 65, said the two keys to proper fit and structure of her suits are 
their Lycra fabric and fuller cuts. The suits she wore in her musicals were 
made of Lycra, and they never inched up or down when they weren't supposed to, 
she said. And the fuller cuts are reminiscent of Williams' bathing beauty 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
"It was important to me that the styles were wearable for all women," Williams 
said. "Not every woman is running to a plastic surgeon or exercising in a gym 
three times a day. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working on big bosoms and big hips, for all your problem areas," she 
told the women before the show. 
</P>
<P>
"I know you're going to look at these skinny models and say, 'Oh, no!' but 
remember, (the swimsuits) come in all sizes." 
</P>
<P>
The collection includes bottoms that can be pulled up to the waist or lowered 
down to bikini size. Most suits are cut high under the arms to prevent 
"spillage," the legs are cut lower to cover up the hips. Many of the one-piece 
suits have shirring around the midriff or draping across the bodice, which 
serves as a flattering camouflage for figure flaws. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said she was persuaded to design the line after Irwin Greenblatt, 
president of Excelsior, conducted a survey and found that the majority of the 
respondents both remembered her from her movies and wanted more conservative 
swimsuits. 
</P>
<P>
John Rogoff, senior vice president of Excelsior, said his company surveyed 
women ages 17 to 65 on their preferences in swimwear. Eighty-eight percent said 
they prefer one-piece swimsuits with a V-neck and regular-cut legs (cut 
straight across the leg rather than cut high toward waist) with bra lining and 
support. The majority also said they prefer suits in solid colors rather than 
prints. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Rogoff said, his company is finding that "more and more women 
in the 35-to-45 age range are beginning to wear two-piece suits again, as long 
as there is adequate coverage." 
</P>
<P>
"They are looking for a conservative suit with some style," he added. "We have 
found in our retail sales that a two-piece suit with coverage in the rear and 
on the sides accounts for 25% of the sales." 
</P>
<P>
Department store buyers seem to finding the same thing. According to Nordstrom 
Orange County swimwear buyer Katie Waites, the biggest sellers for young 
shoppers are the Brazilian- and French-cut suits, which reveal most of the 
derriere and hip. Older Nordstrom shoppers, however, are flocking to fuller 
cuts in brighter colors than last year. 
</P>
<P>
Two-piece suits with bottoms that can be raised or lowered were introduced 2 
years ago by a small number of swimsuit manufacturers, Waites said. That design 
and styles with shirring or draping are both extremely popular this year with 
older buyers, she added. 
</P>
<P>
"This indicates they are looking for a more stylish suit with coverage," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The trend toward more coverage is consumer evidence that the population is 
aging, according to the president of Swimwear Industry Manufacturers, a Los 
Angeles-based trade group. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a trend toward more construction within the swimwear, more coverage, 
more control for the midriff and stomach and lower leg lines," said John 
Weingarten, head of the trade association and president of DeWeese Inc., makers 
of DeWeese and Jag swimwear. 
</P>
<P>
"And the reason that this is happening is . . . our population is aging. The 
baby boomer who drove the big bikini business into prominence in the 1960s and 
'70s is now in her 40s. She's no longer that young customer, but she still 
wants to have a young look and a young attitude. But she also needs more 
support." 
</P>
<P>
The crowd at the Costa Mesa show nearly hooted for the retro styles in the 
Esther Williams collection. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way I'd wear a two-piece is with that bottom," said one middle-aged 
woman viewing a strapless black two-piece with a high-waisted bottom. She 
seemed to appreciate the suit's ability to hide the waist. Her companion said 
some of the leg styles were still too high cut for her. 
</P>
<P>
In working with Misty designers to create the suits, Williams said she tried to 
make "classic swimsuits that women would feel glamorous wearing." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not trendy," she added. "I'm what you call a classic."

ANN CONWAY: ORANGE BLOSSOM BALL IS 'IN' EVENT FOR ELITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just drop "The Ball" and cognoscenti know of which gala you speak. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the ball -- the Orange Blossom Ball that benefits the Orangewood 
Children's home -- has become the glitzy night out that is de rigueur for the 
county's social elite, the Board of Supervisors and a smattering of senators 
and congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
And it's a mere babe of 5. How have they done it? 
</P>
<P>
According to William Steiner, it's been a piece of cake. "Because we have an 
incredibly good cause that is recognized by the entire community," said the 
director of the Orangewood Children's Foundation. "And we've had incredible 
catalysts -- ball chairwomen such as Judie Argyros, Kathryn Thompson and Willa 
Dean Lyon." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, when the ball was brand new, $68,000 was raised. In each of the next 
two years, it netted $100,000. Last year, proceeds more than doubled, with a 
staggering $203,000 realized. 
</P>
<P>
"That's almost a 300% increase within four years," Steiner marvels. 
</P>
<P>
How did it make the megajump of an additional $100,000 last year? The 
underwriting party staged at Willa Dean and Gen. William Lyon's mansion made 
the whopping difference. One month before the ball, Orangewood supporters 
shared a regal night out with cocktails served up in the Lyons' automobile 
museum and dinner served up under the stars. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, a laid-back auction was conducted with supporters bidding on chances 
to pay individual ball costs. 
</P>
<P>
The good news: On May 6, supporters will gather again at the Lyons' to bid on 
the ball's underwriting expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The bad/good news: Even without an invitation in the mail, the June 10 gala at 
the Irvine Hilton and Towers is a sellout. 
</P>
<P>
A Yankee Doodle Dandy: She likes to play the celebrity down, keep a very low 
profile. But Theresa Cagney Morrison, niece of actor James Cagney, has begun to 
take some baby steps on the local social circuit. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Newport Beach resident was spotted at a Roundtable West event at 
the Balboa Bay Club. And only last week she was among the dressed-to-the-nines 
crowd at a fashion show in Irvine staged by the Sophisticates, a support group 
for the Assessment and Treatment Services Center. 
</P>
<P>
Corner her for a second, and she'll share a memory or two of her famous uncle. 
"I spent several summers at Martha's Vineyard with him -- from 1965 into the 
'80s. He was a caring person -- about the environment and about people. 
Actually, he was one of the first crusaders for the preservation of the 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
The supremely polished superstar came from a hungry background, Morrison said. 
"His parents died early. So the children (Cagney, his three brothers and 
Theresa's mother, Jean) had to really pull together as a family." 
</P>
<P>
That hunger was something Cagney never forgot and something his niece is 
helping to assuage among the poor in Orange County. She serves on the board of 
directors of the Food Distribution Center in Santa Ana. And yes, her uncle's 
deprived childhood is one of her reasons for becoming involved. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks for the memory, Ruth: Few will forget Shirley Temple's visit to Orange 
County last November when she appeared at the Irvine Marriott to sign copies of 
her autobiography, "Child Star." The Thanksgiving-themed event -- attended by a 
galaxy of Temple's co-stars -- was the highlight of the holiday social season. 
</P>
<P>
But the benefit for the American Cinema Awards Foundation might not have been 
so memorable if it hadn't been for comedian Milton Berle's wife, Ruth, who died 
of cancer last week at the age of 67. 
</P>
<P>
Learning that the gala was so oversold that committee members planned to divide 
the crowd into two rooms at the Newporter Resort, Ruth flipped. She said: 
"Noooooooo way!" according to John Crean of Newport Beach, co-host of the event 
with his wife, Donna. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth knew a house divided would rob the starry night of its magic. After all, 
guests had signed up to hang out next to the stars, to break bread right beside 
them in one glittering ballroom. And besides, how could her dear Uncle Miltie 
be expected to run back and forth, telling gags in one room and repeating them 
in another? 
</P>
<P>
"She insisted we move the event so we could all be together," John Crean said. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't easy. Hundreds of "we've moved" notices had to be hustled together 
and mailed, and arrangements had to be canceled and then made again. 
</P>
<P>
But it was worth it. The star-struck crowd absolutely wallowed in 5 hours of 
sublime togetherness. And they departed with stacks of signed books in their 
arms and thanks-for-the-memory smiles on their faces. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks for the memory, Ruth.

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: MAUREEN REAGAN PUSHES LIFE WITH FATHER SAGA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During her father's presidential campaigns in 1980 and '84, Maureen Reagan's 
days were a whirlwind of speeches, interviews, hotel rooms, fast food and 
airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
This month Maureen Reagan is once again barnstorming the country. This time, 
however, it's book buyers rather than voters she's trying to woo. 
</P>
<P>
The eldest daughter of Ronald Reagan is winding up a 4-week, 18-city publicity 
tour to promote her memoir, "First Father, First Daughter" (Little, Brown), an 
affectionate chronicle of her life with her father -- from Hollywood in the 
'40s through Washington in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday Reagan will swing through Orange County to speak at a 
book-and-author luncheon sponsored by The Times' Orange County Edition at the 
Red Lion Inn in Costa Mesa. Also speaking at the sold-out luncheon will be 
biographer A. Scott Berg ("Goldwyn: A Biography") and novelist Amy Tan ("The 
Joy Luck Club"). 
</P>
<P>
Speaking by phone from her Cleveland hotel room -- a brief interview sandwiched 
between a talk show and a flight to Chicago -- Reagan said she purposely held 
off having her book come out while her father was still in office. 
</P>
<P>
"I insisted it not be published because I didn't want to be one of Sam's 
questions at the helicopter," she said, referring to ABC's ubiquitous White 
House correspondent Sam Donaldson. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been asked for years to write a book. It just seemed to me we had come 
to the end of a unique experience and it seemed a perfect time to reflect. It's 
not an autobiography. I'm too young to write an autobiography. But a political 
memoir of the time seemed fair." 
</P>
<P>
Digging into her past came easy to Reagan, 48, who lives in Los Angeles with 
her third husband, Dennis Revell, owner of a Sacramento and Washington public 
relations company. "I've always been the historian in the family," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan speaks glowingly of her father. ("He's the warmest person I've ever come 
across," she writes, "and it's a warmth that runs so deep inside him, it just 
kind of pulls you along like a magnet.") 
</P>
<P>
Yet her childhood growing up in Hollywood was far from ideal. When her father 
and mother, actress Jane Wyman, divorced when she was 7, "Mermie," as she was 
called, was sent off to boarding school. Adopted brother Michael joined her 
when he was 5. 
</P>
<P>
They'd return home every other weekend and, she said, because the motion 
picture industry was a 6-day-a-week business at the time, "it depended on who 
was working who we'd see." 
</P>
<P>
In the book, young Maureen comes across as a rather lonely child. 
</P>
<P>
"I was," she acknowledged. But rather than feeling abandoned after her parents' 
divorce, she said, it was more a matter of "you don't have anyone to go home to 
with your problems anymore. So you'll take care of them yourself." 
</P>
<P>
That turned out to be the case during her brief marriage in 1961 to a 
Washington policeman when she was 20 and working as a Washington secretary. 
</P>
<P>
It was, she writes, "the single worst mistake I've ever made in my entire life. 
By the time I finally discovered the strength to leave him, I had been brutally 
beaten, abused, battered and kicked about the face and head by this man on more 
occasions than I care to count." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan said she did not attempt to seek help during this period. ("Very few 
do.") She simply lived through it. 
</P>
<P>
If there is a lesson to be learned from this chapter in her life, she said, it 
is "that in this society we tend to blame the victim for almost anything that 
happens to them. A lot of women today are still in that situation. Every once 
in a while something needs to be said so another generation of women will 
realize it's OK, it's not your fault and you can get out and go on -- and there 
are places now you can go and help that you can get." 
</P>
<P>
Despite such personal revelations, Reagan is adamant that "First Father, First 
Daughter" is not an autobiography. "It's not," she said. "It's the story of my 
father and me . . .. The book addresses three areas: politics, Ronald Reagan 
and Maureen." 
</P>
<P>
Politics has always held a fascination for Maureen Reagan, who unsuccessfully 
ran for the 1982 Republican Senate nomination in California. "Politics was a 
way of getting things done and making things different and I liked that," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's visit to Orange County next week will be a homecoming of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-'60s, as Ronald Reagan's political star began its ascent, Maureen 
and her second husband, David Sills, a Marine Corps lieutenant stationed at 
Camp Pendleton, lived in San Clemente. Later, when Sills became an associate in 
a law firm, they lived in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
It was here, Reagan acknowledged with a chuckle, that she "cut her teeth" on 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
During this period, she served as a full-time political volunteer, doing 
precinct work and recruiting other volunteers. She also became first president 
of the Walter Knott Republican Women's Club. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, who is well-known for her efforts on behalf of women's issues, 
completed a 2-year term as co-chairman of the Republican National Committee in 
January. She said she has no current political ambitions of her own. 
</P>
<P>
"I have other things I'd like to do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Such as?

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: TALENTED HOME-GROWN CHEF IS BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doug Organ, the peripatetic wunderkind (and, at times, enfant terrible) of San 
Diego cooking, has come home to roost, and not a moment too soon. 
</P>
<P>
Older and perhaps wiser after a brief apprenticeship in the kitchen at the 
celebrated Taillevent in Paris, Organ has returned to his forte, which is 
serving San Diegans imaginative, thoughtful cuisine of the kind that nearly 
vanished from the scene when Gustaf Anders closed its doors. 
</P>
<P>
Organ, who began cooking at Frederick's in Solana Beach while still in his 
teens (and proved so talented that proprietor Chuck Frederick soon found 
himself working as sous chef under his own employee), is one of a tiny handful 
of home-grown chefs to have made a name for himself in the county. After 
spending some years at Frederick's, he opened the much-praised but ultimately 
unsuccessful 926 in Pacific Beach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Menu Proved Popular 
</P>
<P>
With wine expert and partner Gary Parker, Organ opened the WineSellar &amp; 
Brasserie in late December. The two originally expected the Brasserie to be 
something of an adjunct to the wine shop, and opened the restaurant on a 
restricted basis that included lunch service on weekdays and dinner on weekend 
nights only. Organ's menus, however, generated sufficient interest that dinner 
now is offered Tuesday through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that dinner reservations can be difficult to obtain on short notice 
testifies to Organ's popularity, because the restaurant is well off the beaten 
track on Waples Street, a short thoroughfare in the new zone of industrial and 
office developments springing up along the western stretch of Mira Mesa 
Boulevard. The wine shop occupies ground-floor space in the middle of an 
immense, warehouse-like structure, and the Brasserie is up the stairs in a 
pleasant, low-key room that looks across a wine bar at Organ's open kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Organ pairs a standing menu with a daily supplement that lists several extra 
appetizers and entrees as well as the evening's selection of desserts. At many 
restaurants, the most interesting dishes consistently will be found on the 
specials card, but at the Brasserie, both sides of the menu are reliable guides 
to good eating. 
</P>
<P>
The showiest first course, the grilled lamb salad, is substantial, pretty and 
typical of Organ's style, which can be regarded as updated classic French, and 
could be called, quite simply, contemporary cuisine. Slices of rare meat fan 
out over a bed of wilted spinach and other greens, with crumbles of salty, 
pungent feta cheese used almost like a spice to point up the flavors of hot, 
savory lamb and cool greenery. 
</P>
<P>
One evening's supplementary menu offered a ravishingly beautiful arrangement of 
braised rabbit livers and asparagus that was almost as beguiling to consume as 
to regard. The livers crowned a fleur-de-lis arrangement of all the things that 
rabbits like to nibble, including match-stick cuts of crisp apple, chopped 
tomato, leaves of Belgian endive and a lush bouquet of adroitly cooked 
asparagus. The livers, cooked very rare and served chilled from the 
refrigerator, would have been better at room temperature and superb served hot 
from the pan, with a bit of vinegar added to the cooking juices, but even as 
they were, this was quite a dish. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Elegant and Unusual Soups 
</P>
<P>
The standing menu offers two elegant and unusual soups. A deep, murky taste 
underlies the roasted eggplant soup, a thick, suave puree that is "painted" 
with bands of pureed herbs and centered with a crouton spread with a piquant 
chopped olive mixture. The green gazpacho excludes tomato and is cool, creamy 
and redolent of cucumbers and herbs -- the sort of variation on a theme that 
overshadows the original. 
</P>
<P>
Special entrees have included such offerings as sea bass with green lentils 
(not common hereabouts) and rosemary, and a grilled, marinated rabbit served on 
a crisp wild rice galette, or sauteed cake. A grilled veal chop garnished with 
a compote of ginger and lemon was less demure than such chops can be, and 
likable. 
</P>
<P>
Only two desserts were sampled, and neither was notable. The creamy rice 
pudding in strawberry sauce was nice in its way, but needed a little spark of 
something to bring it up -- a sprinkle of cinnamon might have done the trick. A 
lemon tart featured a vividly flavored filling, but offered it in a tough 
crust.

Rookie Ken Griffey Jr. of the Seattle Mariners had his streak of eight straight 
hits end Thursday night when he walked in the second inning of a 6-1 defeat to 
the Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
The walk extended Griffey's streak of reaching base to 11 consecutive trips to 
the plate, but that ended when Mike Flanagan struck him out in the fifth. His 
streak tied the club record. 
</P>
<P>
The major league record for consecutive hits is 12, set in 1938 by Pinky 
Higgins of the Boston Red Sox and matched by Walt Dropo of Detroit in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan (1-1) allowed seven hits in 8 1/3 innings and lost his shutout in the 
ninth when Jeffrey Leonard and Dave Valle hit consecutive doubles. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto's Fred McGriff hit a three-run homer and a triple, driving in four 
runs.

DIVING FOR COINS AS AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD LED TO MORE THAN A NICKEL-AND-DIME CAREER

<P>
Diving for coins as an 8-year-old in Honolulu started Tommy Wright of 
Wilmington on a career of sportfishing, spearfishing and commercial diving. 
</P>
<P>
Wright arrived on the Wilmington scene 26 years ago and met diver Jim Smith of 
Palos Verdes, and he credits Smith with turning his hobby into a profitable 
career. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years ago, Wright purchased a boat, the Iwalanii, and during the season 
he dives for abalone at San Nicholas Island. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent trip there he jumped into a shallow rock crack, retrieved his take 
and discovered hundreds of small lobsters. 
</P>
<P>
He said they could be large enough by next lobster season to be brought up from 
traps. 
</P>
<P>
On a sportfishing trip last year, Wright worked Cortez Bank and, with deckhand 
Henry Church, brought aboard a 201-pound big-eye tuna after a 33-minute fight. 
</P>
<P>
Returning from Cortez on a slow troll, he landed a stray albacore that weighed 
33 1/2 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
When diving in his native Hawaii, Wright would spear the ulua, a fish that 
resembles the local pompano but is larger and can weigh up to 95 pounds. But 
unlike the pompano caught off South Bay rocks and piers, the ulua feeds best at 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Now 50, Wright said he no longer spearfishes with heavy tanks on his back and 
just dives shallow to check out reefs. 
</P>
<P>
News note: 
</P>
<P>
The Annie B barge inside the L.A. Harbor breakwater will play host Saturday to 
75 wheelchair anglers, some of whom have never had the opportunity to fish the 
ocean.

EX-ARMY COMMANDER TAKES OFFICE AS HEAD OF INTERIM GOVERNMENT IN JORDAN

<TEXT>
<P>
King Hussein on Thursday swore in his former army commander as head of an 
interim government and said that elections will be held soon to replace the 
Cabinet that was forced to resign during nationwide rioting over prices. 
</P>
<P>
The temporary government leader, Sharif Zayed Shaker, is a longtime adviser to 
the king. He was the armed forces' commander in chief until last year, when 
Hussein made him adviser on security affairs and head of the Royal Court, the 
formal assembly of the king's palace advisers. 
</P>
<P>
State-run Jordan TV said that Hussein issued 19 directives to the new 
government, including calls for freedom of the press, support for the Palestine 
Liberation Organization and stamping out corruption. The king also told the 
government to "put an end to the involvement of religion in politics," an 
apparent reference to Islamic fundamentalists accused of encouraging the 
unrest. 
</P>
<P>
Shaker, 55, still holds the rank of field marshal and enjoys high prestige in 
the army. That should help him in quelling lingering unrest. 
</P>
<P>
The government "will be a temporary one" charged with "overseeing the general 
elections which will take place very soon," Hussein was quoted as telling the 
Kuwaiti newspaper Al Siyassah. They will be Jordan's first general elections in 
22 years. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's riots, caused by price increases imposed under a government 
austerity program, killed nine people.

NAVY PLAN FOR CONTROL OF MISSILE WARHEADS ASSAILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the first sign of a looming interservice conflict, the Navy has put forward 
a plan that would give it control over more than four-fifths of the ballistic 
missile warheads permitted under the strategic arms reduction treaty being 
negotiated with the Soviet Union, eight Democratic congressmen concerned with 
military issues charged Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The treaty is intended to reduce the total number of nuclear warheads permitted 
in the United States and Soviet strategic arsenals, and the legislators, led by 
House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.), expressed concern 
that the Navy's proposal would allocate too many warheads to submarines. 
</P>
<P>
This would leave too few warheads for land-based missiles and thereby upset the 
balance in the "triad" of land-based, submarine-based and bomber forces, they 
told President Bush in a letter released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Aspin and the other congressmen also complained that the Navy's plan "seems 
incompatible with the current arms control framework." They called on the White 
House to come up with a coherent strategy for allocating the warheads that 
serves U.S. strategic military needs and does not conflict with the proposed 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
"Under scenarios proposed to Congress," the letter said, "the Navy would retain 
over 4,000 strategic warheads" in its missile submarines. START, the Strategic 
Arms Reduction Talks, will permit a total of 4,900 missile warheads (as well as 
about 1,100 bomber-carried nuclear weapons), which leaves only 900 missile 
warheads for the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
Although starting earlier than expected, a battle royal between the Air Force 
and Navy has been long expected over the issue of how to divide up the smaller 
nuclear "pie" that will exist after the treaty is concluded. Its aim is to 
reduce these weapons by 50% in the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Numbers at Present 
</P>
<P>
At present, the Navy's submarine missiles carry about 6,700 warheads and the 
Air Force has 2,350 warheads on its land-based missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Simply cutting each of those forces by 50% is not feasible, in part because the 
Navy has been building its submarines bigger.

L.A. HONORS LUCY; FUNERAL WILL BE FOR FAMILY ONLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley ordered city flags at half-staff Thursday in 
tribute to Lucille Ball while the comedienne's family disclosed that her 
funeral will be private. 
</P>
<P>
And Gary Morton, her husband of 27 years, expressed his gratitude for the 
sentiments expressed following his wife's death. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never seen or heard of such an outpouring of affection and love for 
anyone as the world is showing for Lucille," Morton told United Press 
International from the Beverly Hills home the couple shared. 
</P>
<P>
"It helps me personally to know that my wife was so beloved and attracted as 
much affection and good will as any head of state." He said a private funeral 
service open only to members of the family will be held for Miss Ball "within 
the next day or so." 
</P>
<P>
"That's the way Lucy wanted it," Morton said, "and that's the way it will be. 
I'm just enjoying the solitude now, being alone with my thoughts of Lucy. I'm 
managing to hold myself together." 
</P>
<P>
Morton said there may be a public memorial service "sometime in the future. But 
right now, I don't know when that will be." 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, a spokesman for Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where Miss Ball died 
Wednesday at age 77, said the family has asked that donations in lieu of 
flowers be sent to the Lucille Ball Foundation. The foundation, established by 
Miss Ball several years ago, has as its beneficiaries Childrens Hospital, City 
of Hope, Center for the Partially Sighted and Los Angeles public television 
station KCET. 
</P>
<P>
Checks may be sent in care of Irella-Manella, a legal firm, 1800 Avenue of the 
Stars, Suite 900, Los Angeles 90067. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, it was announced that the city of Jamestown, N.Y., Miss Ball's 
hometown, will name a street in her honor. It will be called Lucy Lane.

ACTOR GEORGE COULOURIS; KNOWN FOR VILLAIN ROLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Coulouris, an English actor who played a series of devastatingly cruel 
villains both on stage and in films and who was an original member of Orson 
Welles' fabled Mercury Theater, has died, his wife said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
He was 85 and died Tuesday of heart failure brought on by Parkinson's disease, 
Elizabeth Coulouris said from their home in north London. 
</P>
<P>
Coulouris, with his forbidding demeanor and menacing stare, played in more than 
40 feature pictures, starting with "Christopher Bean" in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
His other credits included "All This and Heaven Too," "Assignment in Brittany," 
"For Whom the Bell Tolls," "Watch on the Rhine" (an Oscar nomination for 
supporting actor), "None But the Lonely Heart," "Joan of Arc," "King of Kings," 
"Arabesque," "Papillon," "Murder on the Orient Express," "Shout at the Devil" 
and many more. 
</P>
<P>
He also was Walter Parks Thatcher, the financier-guardian of the young Charles 
Foster Kane, in Welles' immortal "Citizen Kane." 
</P>
<P>
In writing of Coulouris' work as gangster Jim Mordinoy in the 1944 film "None 
But the Lonely Heart," New York Times critic Bosley Crowther called him "the 
very essence of cultivated wickedness." 
</P>
<P>
Born Oct. 1, 1903, to a Greek father and English mother in Salford, central 
England, Coulouris ran away from home to become an actor against his 
businessman father's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
He attended the prestigious Central School of Speech and Drama, studying with 
Peggy Ashcroft and Laurence Olivier. 
</P>
<P>
He went to New York in 1929, landed his first major stage roles, and worked at 
the Mercury Theater in New York, later following Welles to Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps his best-known evildoer was his portrayal of Teck de Brancovis, a 
blackmailer with Nazi connections in the 1943 film of Lillian Hellman's "Watch 
on the Rhine." 
</P>
<P>
During World War II he became the pluperfect Nazi in several other films. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he thought of himself as someone who only worked as a villain," 
Elizabeth Coulouris told the Associated Press. "But I don't think he minded. He 
enjoyed it because he did it well." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, Coulouris returned to England and continued playing a range of 
characters on stage, including Big Daddy in "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof." He once 
listed his favorite stage roles as Othello, Macbeth and King Lear. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977 he appeared in Los Angeles as Lear, appearing for "expenses only," he 
told an interviewer. "It gives me a chance once more to do Shakespeare and to 
spend some pleasant weeks in the Southern California sunshine."

The comatose victim of a Central Park attack has developed pneumonia and her 
"life hangs by a thread," doctors said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the problems we had worried about, a small focus of pneumonia in the 
right lower lung, developed," said Dr. Robert Kurtz, assistant chief of surgery 
at Metropolitan Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
As a precaution, the woman, a Wall Street investment banker, was put back on a 
respirator. She has remained in a coma since she was brought to the hospital 
following the savage gang rape involving at least nine attackers in Central 
Park last week.

POLICY MEETING AIMED ATTACKS AT GORBACHEV 
</P>

<P>
When Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev ousted a quarter of the members of 
the Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee this week, he appeared to 
have won another of his stunning political victories, removing many of his 
critics from the party leadership and replacing them with supporters. 
</P>
<P>
When his strong reaffirmation of thorough-going reforms was published after the 
meeting, he seemed, from the initial reading, to be putting the country on a 
course of rapid and more radical change and committing the party to break out 
of the present stalemate between reformers and conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
But when the full debates of the Central Committee meeting were published 
Thursday, Gorbachev appeared surprisingly beleaguered, under attack from the 
right and the left within the committee, criticized both for his policies and 
his style of leadership and winning only two half-hearted endorsements from 
presumed supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Such are the complexities -- and the very sharp divisions -- of current Soviet 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's mastery of the deft, swift Kremlin maneuvering, all of it behind 
the scenes, that is necessary to hold power here was clear at the Central 
Committee meeting, and Gorbachev's political skills on this level are unrivaled 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, he had already realigned the ruling Politburo, bringing in 
supporters and easing critics to the sidelines. He had led the party through a 
soul-searching conference last summer to win broader agreement on the scope of 
the needed reforms. And he had brought in a new parliamentary system and last 
month put the country through its first contested elections since the earliest 
days of the Soviet state, receiving a strong popular mandate. 
</P>
<P>
This is important for Gorbachev because it secures his flanks from attack, 
particularly by party conservatives concerned about his flouting of political 
orthodoxy. The recent changes in the Politburo and Central Committee, moreover, 
help ensure that he is not ousted, as was Nikita S. Khrushchev, another 
reformer, by a conservative party coup. 
</P>
<P>
But little of Gorbachev's political strength has translated into direct, 
tangible change -- the improved living standards that people expect, the 
takeoff in economic development that Gorbachev's advisers had predicted, the 
"modern socialism" that he himself had spoken of. 
</P>
<P>
And the reason, long suspected but never so clear, was evident in the sustained 
attacks on the reforms by the Central Committee members who spoke at the 
closed-door Kremlin meeting on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
There, all the doubts, the misgivings, the fears, the anger spilled out as 20 
speakers took the floor to endorse the retirement of 110 members and nonvoting 
members of the party Central Committee and the Central Auditing Commission, a 
watchdog body, and then to appraise, sometimes in almost tragic terms, the 
present state of the party and country. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorbachev dominates but does not control the Central Committee members," said 
a senior Soviet journalist who has close contacts with the leadership. "This 
means that he can move them around, even beat up on them, but he cannot 
necessarily make them do what he wants." 
</P>
<P>
Even the purge of most of the conservative rump of the Central Committee, the 
political leftovers from the "era of stagnation" under President Leonid I. 
Brezhnev and those already moved out of top positions within the party and the 
government, does not guarantee immediate or enthusiastic implementation of 
Gorbachev's reforms. 
</P>
<P>
While he can command enough support within the Central Committee for proposals 
he puts before it, Soviet sources said, he has no way, short of a massive 
purge, of ensuring their implementation. 
</P>
<P>
And a major reason, perhaps the principal one, lies in the conservative 
character of the Central Committee, most of whose members, now 251, are 
longtime members of the party, government or military bureaucracy and identify 
with its interests. 
</P>
<P>
One speaker after another at the committee meeting criticized the scope, the 
speed and the implementation of Gorbachev's reform program, known as 
perestroika. The need for reform was not disputed, but the way that Gorbachev 
was implementing change was sharply criticized. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, people do not have confidence in tomorrow," Vladimir I. Melnikov, the 
outspoken party leader from the Komi region in northern Russia, bluntly told 
the meeting, blaming poor implementation of the reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow Mayor Valery T. Saikin, who lost in the parliamentary elections when he 
was unable to defeat a challenge from the forewoman of a team of house 
painters, said, "The people feel uncomfortable, alarmed, and have lost their 
optimism." 
</P>
<P>
The country's mass media, suddenly alive with criticism, exposes and 
provocative new ideas under Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, after 
more than 50 years of deadly direct government censorship, were repeatedly 
attacked for going too far, for abusing their new freedom, for causing people 
to question government policies and doubt the party's leadership. 
</P>
<P>
The intelligentsia, whose early support was critical for Gorbachev in breaking 
with past policies, was accused of propelling the country into changes that had 
not been fully thought out, that so far had created many more problems than 
they had solved and that suited them but not the working class. 
</P>
<P>
Last month's parliamentary elections, a key Gorbachev reform, had been foisted 
upon the country, the critics charged, as the road to democracy; yet the 
results -- meaning the extensive losses by party officials, even when unopposed 
-- proved that they were against the party's interests and undermined its 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
"The minuses here significantly exceed the pluses," Yuri F. Solovyev, the 
Leningrad party leader and a candidate, or nonvoting, member of the Politburo, 
said, perhaps reflecting as much on his defeat in the elections, although he 
was unopposed, as on the political reforms in general. 
</P>
<P>
Cooperative businesses, an important if only an initial step toward a mixed 
economy advocated by Gorbachev, were characterized as legalized "speculation" 
because of their readiness to charge whatever price the market will bear and to 
pay whatever price was required to obtain materials, equipment and skilled 
labor in competition with state enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
New legislation, which will not only implement the reforms but which will be 
the foundation of a shift toward what Gorbachev calls a "law-governed country," 
was harshly criticized as unworkable half-measures. A strong preference was 
evident for continuation of the old system in which the government was based 
largely on party decisions, elaborated by occasional decrees of the leadership 
and administrative regulations promulgated by the bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
On ideological issues, many serious questions -- issues that involve the 
country's basic political orientation -- had arisen for which party officials 
complained they had no answers because of drift within the top leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"Various generations of people, separate social lawyers and even regions are 
quarreling among themselves," Saikin said, adding that the popular loss of 
faith in the party was such that it no longer exercised its "vanguard role." 
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee Secretariat, which Gorbachev has reduced in size and 
restaffed with his own people, was denounced repeatedly for its alleged 
isolated from the people, its orientation toward intellectuals rather than the 
working class and its theoretical approach to problems. 
</P>
<P>
And Gorbachev's own political conduct as the party leader was criticized as 
well. He had become isolated from the people, the outspoken Melnikov said, and 
the Secretariat was "protecting him from the severity of the situation that 
exists down below." 
</P>
<P>
On and on, the criticism rolled -- the speeches filled seven full pages of the 
Communist Party newspaper Pravda on Thursday -- as Gorbachev and his opponents 
on the Central Committee compressed into a day the sharpening struggle over the 
future of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Delivering one of his most brilliant expositions of perestroika at the end, 
Gorbachev not only defended the need for reform but also challenged critics to 
stop looking through "yesterday's eyes." 
</P>
<P>
"I do not agree with the extreme judgments that the party is nearly losing its 
position in the country or that it has turned into a debating society," he 
said. "The party's dialogue with working people is not a weakness, nor is it 
making the party a debating society. If it is weakness to conduct a dialogue 
with all segments of society, then I do not know what courage is."

AIR-FARE WAR TAKES OFF ON ROUTES IN STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fare war broke out Thursday among airlines serving major California cities, 
giving consumers discount air fares not seen since the days before PSA and 
AirCal were bought by major carriers. 
</P>
<P>
The intensified competition in the nation's busiest air corridor between 
Southern and Northern California came as American Airlines slashed fares and 
other big carriers said they will match them. 
</P>
<P>
American's new discount fares -- as low as $29 one-way between Northern 
California and Ontario Airport in San Bernardino County -- spurred other big 
carriers, including USAir and United Airlines, to say they will match them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Will Match It' 
</P>
<P>
"Where we compete with American, we will match it," a United spokesman said. 
USAir said it would announce details of matching fares today. 
</P>
<P>
American is not the first carrier in recent months to announce low fares on 
limited routes in the California market. But American's announcement is the 
first wide-scale price cut, particularly on the Los Angeles-to-San Francisco 
route. Its new fares go into effect May 1. 
</P>
<P>
American put most emphasis on its $98, seven-day advanced purchase, round-trip 
fare from Los Angeles International, Burbank and Orange County to San Francisco 
or San Jose. Those are the most popular routes that "we think peo ple will pay 
attention to," American spokesman Ed Stewart said. Those routes will also 
feature a new, one-day advanced purchase fare of $118 round trip. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the lowest seven-day advanced purchase fare for major carriers 
flying between Los Angeles and San Francisco is $124 round trip. The regular 
unrestricted fare is $296 round trip. 
</P>
<P>
"This is best for the average person, and the smaller companies on very tight 
budgets will obviously benefit," said Gordon Erenberg, manager of the Ask Mr. 
Foster travel agency in Century City. 
</P>
<P>
Business travelers -- the most frequent fliers along the busy routes -- were 
among the most vocal last winter when major carriers raised fares. In 
particular, some businesses were pleased to see a cut in the rate for one-day 
advanced purchase. "It's better than it was; it's been costing us $296," said 
Nancy Godfrey, travel manager for Chevron Oil Co. 
</P>
<P>
"If the client is flexible, how can you beat it," said Marilyn Rosensweig, an 
agent with Century 21 Travel in Tarzana. Passengers always benefit from 
discounting that affects several airlines, she said, "but the problem is with 
people who buy tickets in advance and have to cancel. The rules are so 
restrictive and they don't always remember what you told them about the 
restrictions." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Heffer, senior staff member of San Francisco-based Consumer Action, said 
the fare restrictions dampen the good news somewhat because many people 
traveling between San Francisco and Los Angeles can't make advanced 
reservations, but "we certainly welcome any sign of price competition in the 
San Francisco-Los Angeles market. It's been a long time coming." 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 200 flights a day between Northern and Southern California, 
shuttling thousands of people between the state's population centers. 
</P>
<P>
While most carriers are expected to match the fares, airline industry analysts 
said they do not believe that the discounting signals the beginning of a 
protracted and vicious fare war. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone loses in a fare war. No one is more conscious of that than American," 
said Edmond Greenslet, an analyst with ESG Aviation Services in Greenwich, 
Conn. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a local tactic, not a broad-based strategy," he said, explaining that, 
generally, air fares are rising throughout the nation. 
</P>
<P>
American has a smaller share of the intrastate market than United or USAir, he 
said. "American is under no illusion that they won't match the fare, but the 
advantage is that it gives American name recognition and it buys them good 
will," he said. 
</P>
<P>
American has also recently established a new hub at San Jose in an attempt to 
make it an alternative to San Francisco, he said. The fare announcement is 
"part of a marketing strategy to heighten attention to San Jose," he added. 
</P>
<P>
American's Stewart said, "The bottom line is that this is what our marketing 
folks said we had to do to remain competitive." 
</P>
<P>
The first fare cutting began with Dallas-based Southwest Airlines. It announced 
a $98 unrestricted, round-trip fare, beginning on May 15, for flights between 
Ontario and Oakland and San Diego and Oakland. It will also offer a $58, 21-day 
advanced purchase ticket for those routes. 
</P>
<P>
American's announcement is "their reaction to our introductory fares," said 
Charlotte Goddard, a Southwest spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the other reductions, American is matching Southwest's fares 
with the $58, 21-day advanced purchase ticket between Northern California and 
Ontario, and between Orange County and San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
It will also offer an unrestricted $198 round-trip fare between Burbank and San 
Jose; Los Angeles International and San Francisco or San Jose; and from Orange 
County to San Francisco or San Jose. However, the fare will be available for 
only a limited number of seats on each flight, Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
California consumers have seen steadily increasing rates for intrastate travel 
since USAir bought PSA and American bought AirCal in 1987. Rates rose 
throughout the country as deregulation spurred a wave of airline mergers, 
decreasing competition. When PSA was purchased, consumers could buy a 
full-fare, round-trip ticket between San Francisco and Los Angeles for $140. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to increases last year, the major carriers in January raised fares 
an additional 15%, bringing the regular Los Angeles-San Francisco round-trip 
fare to $296.

The bandits locked about 80 workers in a company truck and at gunpoint forced 
20 other workers to load up the gang's trucks with the toilet articles. The 
gang then forced the rest of the workers into the company truck and drove off, 
according to the police account.

NEW CASES OF TAINTED BABY FOOD PLAGUE BRITONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN FISHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
British police said Thursday that they have been on the trail of an extortioner 
who contaminates baby food with glass and pins since last August but that their 
search has been vastly complicated by what appears to be scores of new, 
publicity-inspired copy-cat cases. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives investigating the scare said that by Thursday night, there have been 
220 reported instances of tainted baby food, up from 28 only a day before. New 
cases were reported throughout much of the British Isles, setting off ripples 
of anger and panic among parents from Dublin to Edinburgh. 
</P>
<P>
At least five infants have been hospitalized after eating tainted food, but all 
are believed to have been released after doctors assured themselves that the 
children had not been seriously harmed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Area Spared 
</P>
<P>
The new cases reported Thursday included more than a dozen in Scotland, five in 
Northern Ireland and two in the independent Republic of Ireland. The first 
instances revealed publicly had been centered in the southeast of the country, 
around London, although there were also some in Wales and the British Midlands. 
</P>
<P>
"The real blackmailer or blackmail gang simply could not have got around all 
those places to contaminate food," said one detective quoted by Britain's 
domestic news agency, the Press Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they know of two cases tied to a plot to extort 1 million pounds 
($1.7 million) from H. J. Heinz Co. Ltd., the British subsidiary of the 
American firm. A dozen other instances of tampering are being checked for 
possible links to the extortioner, they added. However, said one, "if there are 
links established in more than a handful, we will be very surprised." 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the cases, they believe, are probably the work of "copy-cats, 
people getting on the bandwagon, cranks" and some cases of parents actually 
tampering with the food themselves just for the publicity. 
</P>
<P>
Police said their investigation began in Leicestershire, northeast of 
Birmingham, last August when an extortioner threatened to contaminate the 
products of an unnamed company unless it paid him 1 million pounds. 
</P>
<P>
They said the company put about 20,000 pounds ($34,000) in a bank account as 
part of a controlled police operation. But by last January, the extortionist 
had managed to withdraw almost all the money through cash machines without 
getting caught. 
</P>
<P>
After the payments were stopped, a person believed to be the same extortioner 
demanded 1 million pounds from Heinz. Detectives say that to underline his 
demand, the extortioner contaminated one can of Heinz baby food with caustic 
soda and pins and another with eight pieces of a broken razor blade. The 
contaminated containers were discovered earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Heinz confirmed Thursday that it had received an extortion threat but denied 
rumors that it had paid extortion money and vowed that it would not do so. 
</P>
<P>
"This stance has been taken with the full agreement of the police with whom the 
company is working in closest cooperation," according to a company statement. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Cow &amp; Gate Ltd., a British baby food manufacturer which 
has also been subject to tampering, said that firm "has not received any 
threats of blackmail or threats of any other nature." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the two baby food firms have together offered a 100,000 pound 
($170,000) reward for information leading to the arrest of those responsible 
for the contamination. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to glass and pins, containers of baby food have been discovered in 
the last two days contaminated with needles, pieces of bone and a metal washer. 
</P>
<P>
Home Office Minister John Patten said police have "considerable evidence" that 
the tampering is not occurring at the factories. He added that those 
responsible will be charged with attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
Police stressed that while most of the new cases may not be linked to the 
extortion scheme, parents are well advised to be on the alert. "People are 
genuinely finding contaminants in food," said one detective. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Consumer Terrorism' 
</P>
<P>
Patten referred to the scare as "consumer terrorism," and one British newspaper 
branded the perpetrators "baby food beasts." 
</P>
<P>
Mandy Bentham said she "just panicked" when she discovered glass fragments in a 
jar of Cow &amp; Gate's spaghetti Bolognese dinner she was feeding her infant 
son, Kayne. 
</P>
<P>
"They must be mentally ill," she said of the tamperers. "It just terrified me 
to think someone tried to take my baby from me." 
</P>
<P>
Parents have been warned to check the seals on jars of baby food and to spoon 
the contents into a separate dish rather than feeding their infants directly 
from the container. 
</P>
<P>
Heinz said it would not order a general recall of its products from supermarket 
shelves because that would not solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Problem Would Reappear 
</P>
<P>
"The problem would reappear at any future date on Heinz products or any other 
food products sold in grocery outlets," according to the company statement. 
"Our energies are concentrated on assisting the police in apprehending a 
criminal who is prepared to put babies' lives at risk." 
</P>
<P>
The company said that the contamination incidents reported so far represent a 
tiny percentage of its total annual sales of 170 million containers of baby 
food. However, it added, "the current threat against ourselves and other food 
companies has to be stopped. If not there is a real risk that this sort of 
problem will spread industry-wide."

SOVIET DEFENSE CUT 1.5%, SCIENTIST SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT C. TOTH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The long-anticipated cut in the Soviet defense budget has begun this year with 
a 1.5% reduction, Roald Z. Sagdeyev, a widely respected Soviet scientist and 
newly elected representative to the Soviet Congress, said here Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, he said, the cut will reach a total of 7%, and in 1991, it will 
achieve the previously announced goal of 14.2%. 
</P>
<P>
While the overall cutback has been disclosed publicly by Soviet officials, 
Sagdeyev's remarks in a meeting with reporters provided the first details on 
how it will be phased in over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
The defense reductions announced earlier this year have received intense 
international attention as a reflection of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
economic reform program and his campaign to improve relations with the West. 
</P>
<P>
However, the fiscal forecasts will continue to be treated skeptically by U.S. 
analysts. A U.S. intelligence report last week asserted that Soviet military 
spending last year had actually increased 3% in real terms, for example, and 
noted that the Kremlin has yet to reveal the true size of its defense budget. 
</P>
<P>
Sagdeyev, who is in Washington for scientific meetings, predicted that full 
details of the Soviet defense and space budgets will be published in the fall. 
The budget figures will not be a true measure of how much the defense and space 
programs actually cost the Soviet Union, however, because accurate price 
determinations on items will not be available by then. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of products and programs in the Soviet Union has long been unclear 
because of the extent of government subsidies for their production. Reforms to 
set actual prices, once promised for this year, will not be accomplished on 
schedule, Sagdeyev said. 
</P>
<P>
In other remarks to reporters, Sagdeyev: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Counseled the Bush Administration to resist making changes in the U.S. 
position in the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks that will resume soon. He 
indicated that the proposed treaty, which will cut offensive weapons by roughly 
half, could be improved but argued that such improvements should wait for a 
subsequent treaty to be adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Admitted that the Soviet space program, and particularly its space shuttle 
project, is troubled because of its high cost. Sagdeyev, a space scientist of 
international stature, said that the failure of the Soviet probe toward Phobos, 
a Martian moon, has contributed to strong criticism of the space program. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Applauded what he said is the responsible approach taken by the Soviet 
people to elections this month. In the voting, all 15 candidates supported by a 
neo-Fascist organization were defeated, he noted. Sagdeyev was elected by the 
Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
Sagdeyev indicated that, although full details of the defense and space budgets 
will not be released for several months, the levels have already been set. 
</P>
<P>
Space expenditures are "not modest," he said, and will underscore criticism 
that too much has been spent. But he also claimed that the figures are "several 
times smaller" U.S. expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
On the defense budget, the recent report of the CIA and Defense Intelligence 
Agency on the Soviet economy estimated that defense spending last year, in 
constant 1982 rubles, "grew by roughly 3% -- in line with the growth rates of 
the past several years." Thus, a 14.2% cut by 1991 will only return the 
military budget to its level five years ago, just before Gorbachev took power. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about possible shifts in U.S. positions at the strategic arms talks by 
the Bush team, Sagdeyev said that "it will not be a tragedy if the 
Administration came with modifications" to previous positions. The Soviet 
official noted, however, that "lots of time" has been lost in the White House 
review of arms control issues, which has postponed resumption of the 
negotiations since Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
"I would urge that (the United States) not reopen the negotiations with 
different figures. Consider the START figures a quick fix, with future arms 
negotiations based on better (positions)," he said.

IRAQ SAID TO DOWN AIR SHOW GUEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Iraqi government invited Egypt to fly its home-built Alpha fighter bomber 
to Baghdad last week for an air show, only to shoot down the Egyptian plane as 
it descended to land in Iraq's capital, Administration officials disclosed 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Secret intelligence reports making the rounds of U.S. government offices say 
that the Egyptian jet was shot down by a shoulder-fired missile, apparently 
because some Iraqi soldier failed to get word that the plane was an invited 
guest. 
</P>
<P>
The two Egyptian fliers in the Alpha jet ejected safely, according to the 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-aircraft weapon that downed the Alpha was likely a Soviet-built 
missile that homes in on the heat of a plane's engines and explodes on impact, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Ahmed Zaki, assistant military attache at the Egyptian Embassy in 
Washington, said he knew there was an international air show in Baghdad but had 
no information about the reported downing. Iraqi military officials could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier case of mistaken identity or a breakdown in communications, an 
Iraqi pilot flying a Mirage F-1 fighter bomber on May 17, 1987, shot two Exocet 
missiles into the U.S. frigate Stark, killing 37 sailors during the Iran-Iraq 
War. Iraq said the pilot mistook the ship for an Iranian vessel. 
</P>
<P>
The Alpha was developed by French and West German aircraft firms. Egypt buys 
Alpha kits from France and assembles them in a plant south of Cairo.

A walkout stalled trains, buses and subways in Spain on Thursday as 
transportation workers pressed demands for higher wages and improved working 
conditions. The state railway ran only a skeleton service on the first day of a 
three-day strike that coincided with a one-day stoppage by public transport 
employees in Madrid, Barcelona and several other cities.

It took firefighters 12 hours to control fires that started about 8 p.m. 
Wednesday. Moshe Rivlin, chairman of the Jewish National Fund, which is in

trees. The forest, several hundred acres of pine, is named for the late

ROCKETS RAIN ON KABUL, A DAY AFTER CELEBRATION 
</P>

KABUL, Afghanistan

<TEXT>
<P>
Rebel rockets rained on the Afghan capital throughout the day Thursday, killing 
16 people, injuring 46 and spoiling President Najibullah's celebration of the 
11th anniversary of the Marxist coup that brought his party to power. 
</P>
<P>
The attack by the U.S.-supported Islamic rebels known as the moujahedeen 
apparently was timed to coincide with the anniversary. It appeared to be 
intended as a show of force even as the rebels are losing ground to the 
government, which has managed to stay in power even after the last of 115,000 
Soviet troops were withdrawn from Afghanistan in February. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing such an anniversary attack, Najibullah had staged his own show of force 
a day earlier, with a military parade that included the army's latest Soviet 
weapons. Officials said the event was moved up 24 hours in order to avoid 
putting visiting dignitaries in jeopardy, along with the hundreds of soldiers 
who took part in the parade. 
</P>
<P>
One of the rockets that hit Kabul on Thursday exploded just 100 yards from the 
reviewing stand where Najibullah had stood the day before. It came in at 7:15 
a.m., the hour at which the parade had originally been scheduled to get under 
way Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Two civilians sitting on the river bank nearby were killed, and the government 
took a group of visiting foreign reporters to the site to show them the 
victims' bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry officials also took the reporters to several houses where 
other people have been killed by the rockets, most of which are made in China 
and paid for by the United States, which has been the rebels' principal 
provider of arms. 
</P>
<P>
In an hourlong anniversary address to party leaders and delegates from many of 
the world's Communist nations, Najibullah did not once use the word communism. 
He emphasized his government's commitment to private initiative and promised to 
remain committed to the teachings of Islam. He appealed to Western nations for 
foreign investment and vowed that the state will protect all such investment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Critical of His Party 
</P>
<P>
Najibullah was sharply critical of the performance of his People's Democratic 
Party of Afghanistan in the years since the so-called Saur Revolution, a name 
taken from the Pushtun word for the month. He said it had ignored and 
oversimplified the complexities of Afghanistan's religious- and tribal-based 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
"We have made mistakes, even big ones," he declared from the podium in the 
assembly hall of the heavily fortified presidential palace, as the rebel 
rockets fell around the city. 
</P>
<P>
He said the rebels were the aggressors and said they had failed to respond to 
his call for reconciliation and negotiations on power-sharing, a call he has 
issued repeatedly since the Soviet withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
He made no reference to the rocket attack, but a government spokesman said that 
more than 54 rockets hit the city during the day. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the Afghan government will succeed in its campaign to alter its image 
in the international community is not yet clear, but in Kabul there are few 
signs of increased popularity. 
</P>
<P>
There were no celebrations in the streets Thursday. Najibullah stayed in his 
palace, which is protected by tanks and troops.

TEST OF ROCKET THAT WOULD DESTROY MISSILES SUCCEEDS 
</P>

In what officials called a major first step toward developing space-based "Star 
Wars" weapons, Defense Department scientists announced Thursday that they have 
successfully tested an experimental space vehicle designed to destroy incoming 
nuclear missiles by crashing into them. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-second flight of the 6-foot rocket took place Monday inside a cavernous 
Air Force laboratory at Edwards Air Force Base near Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Pentagon's Strategic Defense Initiative Office said the test 
significantly boosted efforts to develop and deploy the first phase of a much 
larger space-based defensive network. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Proved That It Could Walk' 
</P>
<P>
An earlier test of the vehicle "proved that the baby could stand up," Pentagon 
spokesman Dan Howard said. "This one proved that it could walk." 
</P>
<P>
But skeptics of the Pentagon's "Star Wars" program said successful tests of 
such components, although positive, do not demonstrate that the space-based 
interceptors would provide an effective and affordable defense against Soviet 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a modest step and they have much to be modest about," said John Pike, a 
space analyst with the Washington-based Federation of American Scientists. 
</P>
<P>
"To use a sporting analogy, each of these players is doing well in batting 
practice, but let's see how the team does in the World Series," Pike said. 
"While it's not surprising that individual gadgets would work, that doesn't 
mean the overall system would work as anything militarily useful." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Next Test in June 
</P>
<P>
The next test flight of the projectile is scheduled for late June, when the 
Pentagon will seek to determine whether the vehicle's on-board homing sensor 
can detect the presence of a target designed to look like a ballistic missile 
in flight. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's test was intended to prove that the test vehicle could take off and 
orient itself, using tiny on-board rockets, toward a computer target. 
</P>
<P>
"The components themselves represent an order-of-magnitude improvement in 
technology," program manager Alan Weston said of Monday's test. "Integrating 
them and demonstrating them as a flight vehicle was a first as well." 
</P>
<P>
Weston said that in one of the test's most significant results the test vehicle 
pointed with "very fine" accuracy at the tiny computer target and stayed homed 
in on it. "This has never been done before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Program officials believe that such tests are proving the viability of 
technologies that will be used in the earliest phase of "Star Wars" 
deployments. Those are expected to concentrate on small rockets that slam into 
missiles in flight, destroying them. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most promising of such systems has been dubbed "Brilliant Pebbles" 
-- swarms of small computer-equipped rockets in space, ready to intercept 
Soviet missiles. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has identified Brilliant Pebbles 
as the focus of intensive development efforts in coming budgets. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're demonstrating here applies directly to Brilliant Pebbles as well as 
to any system that's launched from the ground into space," said Lloyd 
Stoessell, the official in charge of the program at the Pentagon.

FIRST LADY BELIEVES AMERICAN PARENTING IS IN STATE OF DECAY

<P>
The recent violence in New York in which 32 youths randomly assaulted at least 
nine people demonstrates a fundamental flaw in changing American society, First 
Lady Barbara Bush suggested Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"People are going to have to reevaluate their lives and put their children 
first," Mrs. Bush said at a White House luncheon with a group of reporters. 
Many parents simply don't spend enough time with their children, she indicated. 
"Children do things in a group that they would never do (alone). You ought to 
know who your children are with." 
</P>
<P>
She said that she believes poverty, drugs and illiteracy are "interconnected" 
with some children's lack of direction. 
</P>
<P>
She also characterized the dual-career marriage as something "we haven't 
learned to live with. Life is too fast, and it's tough on family life. I have 
children who work, and it's exhausting to work and take care of children. 
People put in eight-, nine-, ten-hour days and they're tired when they get 
home. But they need to understand this (child-rearing) is a very short time in 
your life. I used to think I'd be a mother for a thousand years." 
</P>
<P>
The decaying state of American parenting was one of several subjects Mrs. Bush 
touched on during lunch and a tour of the White House private family living 
quarters, which were seldom seen by outsiders during the Reagan years. The 
President has his collection of toy soldiers spread across the fireplace mantle 
of his home office, along with a children's toy chest off in a corner. 
</P>
<P>
With the Bush Administration marking its 100th day Saturday, the 63-year-old 
First Lady seemed pleased with the performances of both her husband and 
herself. The President has "been wonderful. He acts and doesn't react," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As for her own role, Mrs. Bush said, "I happen to see mine as a real 
opportunity to do things for other people." She has made visits to homeless 
shelters and facilities for literacy programs and AIDS treatment among other 
places. She has avoided the controversy that plagued the early months of Nancy 
Reagan as First Lady. Mrs Reagan was criticized for ignoring social causes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting plenty of visibility, plenty!" Mrs. Bush said. "I just try my 
hardest. I never set goals. I just try to do my best and get my desk cleaned 
off." 
</P>
<P>
Although Mrs. Bush had seemed to reverse an earlier position that she once 
stated in favor of banning AK-47 semi-automatic assault rifles, she said she 
had not been "muzzled." 
</P>
<P>
"No," she replied. "And I don't think you know either me or George Bush if you 
think that. He never tells me what to say." 
</P>
<P>
She said that the President "of course . . . talks to me about things that are 
going on." But she sidestepped an inquiry about whether she has discussed the 
issue of abortion with him. "What I talk about with George Bush is none of your 
business," said Mrs. Bush, who is widely suspected of favoring the right to 
abortion -- contrary to her husband's position. 
</P>
<P>
In a new twist on her literacy campaign, Mrs. Bush said that "one of the very 
happiest times is bathtub reading," and revealed that both she and the 
President read while soaking.

The Navy Thursday pushed back the next test date for a submarine-launched 
Trident 2 missile from April to mid-July to make necessary design changes in 
the nozzle guidance system in the wake of last month's crash. In the first sea 
test of the $26.5-million missile on March 21 off Florida, the missile 
cartwheeled off course and exploded.

SESSIONS TO SNUB TWO FBI OFFICIALS IN FILLING NO. 2 POST 
</P>

<P>
In a major shake-up at FBI headquarters, FBI Director William S. Sessions plans 
to pass over senior FBI executives to fill the agency's long-vacant No. 2 post 
and to tighten management because of growing dissatisfaction by Atty. Gen. Dick 
Thornburgh, government sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Sessions intends to elevate to the powerful associate director's post Floyd I. 
Clarke, an official who had been promoted only two months ago to the top 
management level. In doing so, he will bypass two veteran FBI officials who had 
been considered possible heirs to the director's job. 
</P>
<P>
Sessions has been meeting frequently with Thornburgh in recent weeks about the 
attorney general's concerns that the bureau has not been moving quickly enough 
to resolve management shortcomings, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last year, the bureau has been sharply criticized for its treatment of 
minority agents and for an investigation that allegedly violated the rights of 
activists opposed to the Administration's El Salvador policies. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh has approved the elevation of Clarke and related moves, but word of 
the shifts has been held so tightly that some of the principals said Thursday 
that they had not heard of the changes. Announcement of the action in the next 
few weeks is expected to be a bombshell at the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
The management shifts are coming after reports that Thornburgh was searching 
for a way to ease Sessions out and that he had considered recommending him for 
a vacancy on the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. Thornburgh, however, denied 
those reports. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver B. Revell, one of the senior officials passed over, oversees all FBI 
investigations. John Otto, the other official not promoted, had served as 
acting director before Sessions took command of the agency in November, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Revell and Otto are 50 and thus eligible for full retirement under FBI rules. 
Otto said that Sessions had not discussed Clarke's appointment with him and 
that "I enjoy what I'm doing here." Revell could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
In other shifts approved by Thornburgh, Sessions has downgraded the office of 
congressional and public affairs and is having each of those functions report 
separately to him. Milton Ahlerich, who has headed the joint office as 
assistant director, is expected to be named a special agent in charge of one of 
the bureau's 58 field offices, which an official noted is "the next logical 
step in his career." 
</P>
<P>
Clarke, 47, was a deputy under Revell in 1982 when Revell headed the FBI's 
criminal investigative division. When Revell was promoted to executive 
assistant director in 1985, Clarke took over the criminal investigative 
division -- the FBI's highest-profile unit. In February, Clarke was named to 
one of the three executive assistant director posts. 
</P>
<P>
On April 5, Sessions brought William Baker back from the CIA as assistant 
director in charge of the criminal division. Baker, a veteran FBI official, had 
moved to the CIA with former FBI Director William H. Webster when he became 
head of the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke, who has been with the FBI for 25 years, served as assistant special 
agent in charge of the FBI's Philadelphia office and headed the bureau's Kansas 
City office before moving to headquarters in 1982.

REBELS TARGET U.S. OFFICIALS IN PHILIPPINES

<P>
In what American officials described as a "very ominous" change in tactics, 
Communist rebels in the Philippines have decided to target U.S. officials 
involved in counterinsurgency operations there for assassination, 
Administration sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The killing of Army Col. James N. Rowe in Manila last week provided the first 
firm evidence of the rebel decision, which was made recently, according to U.S. 
officials speaking on condition that they not be identified by name. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist New People's Army has drawn up a specific list of American 
military and civilian targets for assassination, according to U.S. intelligence 
sources. And it has decided to attack U.S. military installations as part of a 
larger plan to intimidate the government of President Corazon Aquino and drive 
Americans from the Philippines, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
A special team of State Department officials and FBI agents have been sent to 
Manila to investigate Rowe's murder, but intelligence sources traced the 
killing directly to the high-level rebel decision to attack American targets. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels are targeting "not only people but facilities," one knowledgeable 
State Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is our belief that they have taken this decision very recently," declared 
another Administration official. "It is very ominous." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials called the Rowe killing "part of a carefully conceived plan" 
timed to coincide with difficult negotiations over leases on two major U.S. 
military bases in the islands, Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base. A total 
of 16,700 U.S. military personnel are stationed in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
The 25-year lease on the bases expires in 1991, and renewal talks have stalled 
over how much the United States should pay to retain rights to the massive 
facilities. Philippine domestic politics have also slowed the talks as the 
Aquino government has sought to portray itself as a bulwark against continuing 
American colonialism. 
</P>
<P>
The new rebel policy sends "a heavy political message to both the Aquino 
government and the U.S. -- they want us out of there," one senior 
Administration official said. "They don't want us to have any bases there." 
</P>
<P>
Rowe, part of the 46-member Joint U.S. Military Assistance Group, was ambushed 
a week ago by gunmen who riddled his lightly armored sedan with automatic 
weapons fire in a traffic circle in Quezon City near Manila. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
West Point Graduate 
</P>
<P>
Rowe, 51, was a highly decorated West Point graduate who spent five years as a 
prisoner of war in Vietnam. He was assigned to assist Philippine government 
troops with training and logistical programs and was not a military 
counterinsurgency adviser, a Pentagon spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. estimates, the rebel army numbers about 20,000, with half or 
more equipped with modern weapons that were captured from Philippine troops, 
provided by foreign sympathizers or bought on the open market. The Communists 
control about 20% of the former U.S. colony's territory. 
</P>
<P>
The last coordinated attack on U.S. targets in the Philippines occurred in 
October, 1987, when three Americans, two of them in military service and one 
retired, were shot to death in ambushes outside Clark Air Base. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. analysts at the time suspected that the attacks marked a change in rebel 
tactics, but there were no further killings. In succeeding months, the rebels 
issued numerous public threats against Americans and others helping Philippine 
government counterinsurgency efforts, but the attacks never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the New People's Army has begun a new campaign against 
Americans installations and officials, U.S. sources said. Early this month, 
rebels laid a land mine near an American firing range outside of Clark Air Base 
and attacked a U.S. Navy transmitting station near Manila, damaging an antenna 
and some power lines. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels, in a statement, said that the raids were in retaliation for 
"escalating U.S. military intervention in the country." The rebel statement 
said that U.S. advisers are directing Philippine troops in the 
counterinsurgency campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"The NPA has long made public calls for withdrawal of the bases," a State 
Department official said Thursday. "The goal appears to be one of two things: 
either to drive the U.S. out or draw the U.S. into active involvement in the 
counterinsurgency, which would then arouse nationalist feelings of the Filipino 
people and lead them to support the NPA rather than the government." 
</P>
<P>
The State Department has warned Americans against traveling in rebel-held 
territory, and security has been stepped up for certain U.S. officials.

<P>
PUBLIC, WILLING TO WAIT AND SEE, GIVES BUSH A 'C' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Americans are giving President Bush only a "C" grade for his first 100 days in 
office, according to the Los Angeles Times Poll. 
</P>
<P>
People are not very excited about the new President. But neither are they 
really upset with him. They basically are reserving judgment until later and 
not paying a lot of attention at present, the Times survey found. 
</P>
<P>
"Give him a chance," people told the Times poll. "He wants to do the right 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, Bush's marks are not as high as Ronald Reagan's were at this 
comparable stage in their presidencies. The public graded Reagan with a "B" 
after 100 days, the poll found eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan had been shot 70 days after entering the Oval Office and his ordeal 
boosted his popularity. But the assassination attempt accounts for only part of 
the difference in attitudes toward the two presidents, various surveys have 
indicated. For example, a Times poll a few days before Reagan was shot found 
that the public's impression of him even then was higher than it currently is 
of Bush. 
</P>
<P>
One of the raps on Bush has been that his Administration is "adrift." And the 
poll found evidence that Americans tend to agree with this criticism, with 
two-thirds saying the President's "goals are not very clear." 
</P>
<P>
The Times poll, directed by I. A. Lewis, interviewed a random sample of 2,160 
American adults by telephone for four days ending last Tuesday night. The 
margin of error for this size survey is 3 percentage points in either 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
When people were asked, "What kind of report card would you give President 
Bush?" the result was a "C" average, with only 11% awarding him an "A." By 
contrast, Reagan after 100 days was given an "A" by 35%. 
</P>
<P>
Offered eight comments about Bush and asked to name the one or two best suiting 
him, people mostly chose this statement: "We ought to give him a chance." Next 
came the observation: "He wants to do the right thing." After that, far down 
the list, a relatively small percentage of people chose such comments as: "He 
doesn't seem to know where he's going," "He's a nice person" and "He doesn't 
care about people like me." 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the people have a positive impression of Bush -- 67% favorable, 20% 
unfavorable and 13% not sure. But at this stage eight years ago, when Bush was 
merely the vice president, people had an even higher impression of him. It was 
86% favorable then. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Lewis Law 
</P>
<P>
"This is a near-perfect example of Lewis' law, which says that if you don't 
know much about somebody, you like him," pollster Lewis said of Bush's higher 
popularity during the early months of his vice presidency. 
</P>
<P>
During that 1981 period -- 100 days into Reagan's first term -- 83% of those 
surveyed held a favorable impression of Reagan, illustrating that he was 
considerably more popular than Bush is now. And as an example of the contrast 
in excitement levels generated by the two men, twice as many people had a 
"very" favorable impression of Reagan as now do of Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Less than half the people interviewed by The Times (47%) "approve of the way 
George Bush is handling his job as President." Only 18% disapprove, but 35% 
have not formed an opinion about how the President is doing. 
</P>
<P>
At this juncture of Reagan's Administration, by comparison, more than 
three-fourths of the people (80%) approved of the President's job performance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oil Spill Seen Hurting 
</P>
<P>
One recent event that probably led to a slippage in Bush's stock was the 
Alaskan oil spill. Critics accused the Administration of dragging its feet 
before taking control of efforts to clean up the 11 million gallons of crude 
oil that leaked into Prince William Sound when the tanker Exxon Valdez ran 
aground on March 24. The public generally agrees with the critics, the poll 
found. 
</P>
<P>
Of those surveyed, 52% disapproved "of the way President Bush has handled the 
oil spill." Only 25% approved and 23% weren't sure. 
</P>
<P>
Also, public suspicion about Bush's involvement in the Iran-Contra scandal has 
increased during the trial of former White House aide Oliver L. North, the poll 
showed. More than one-third of the people say the trial has convinced them that 
Bush was more involved than they previously thought. And roughly half believe 
the President "has told lies" about the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
75% Like Bush Personally 
</P>
<P>
Although Americans tend to like Bush -- three-fourths say they like him 
personally and almost half say they like him now better than during the 
election campaign -- they are not especially impressed with his initial moves 
as President. 
</P>
<P>
When asked "all things considered" whether they think Bush "has gotten off to a 
strong start or a weak start," the vast majority (61%) described the start as 
"somewhere in-between." About twice as many people characterized it as weak as 
did strong. 
</P>
<P>
Only roughly one-fourth (26%) said they "have a good idea where George Bush 
wants to lead the country." About two-thirds (65%) lamented that "his goals are 
not very clear." 
</P>
<P>
People are inclined to think that Bush "is continuing the policies of Ronald 
Reagan" rather than leading the country in a new direction. But two-thirds said 
that Bush, indeed, "should point the country in a new direction." 
</P>
<P>
On some specific issues, people indicated they do not have a lot of confidence 
in the new President but their feelings are not strong. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Handling of Economy 
</P>
<P>
For example, only one-third approves of Bush's "handling of the nation's 
economy." But less than one-fourth disapproves. The biggest block of people, 
nearly half, have no opinion at all. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, two-thirds of those surveyed in a similar Times survey eight years 
ago approved of Reagan's handling of the economy, which then was suffering from 
high inflation and was about to begin plunging into a deep recession. 
</P>
<P>
The public seems ambivalent about the present economy. Nearly one-fourth says 
it is "good," a little more than one-fourth describes it as "bad" and roughly 
one-half puts it "somewhere in-between." However, people tend to be pessimistic 
about the future economy. Roughly twice as many believe it will be worse next 
year as think it will get better. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly two-thirds of the people said they have no confidence that Bush "will be 
able to make significant reductions in the federal budget deficit." 
Interestingly, almost half those surveyed eight years ago were confident that 
Reagan actually would be able to balance the annual budget, which was only $79 
billion in the red when he took office and more than twice that when he left. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest poll, three-fourths also doubted that Bush will be able to avoid 
asking for a tax increase, despite his repeated "read my lips -- no new taxes" 
pledge during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
On a related matter, those surveyed more often than not regarded the 
much-ballyhooed 1986 tax overhaul as "a bad thing." Three times more people 
told interviewers they are paying higher income taxes than said they are paying 
less. 
</P>
<P>
But again illustrating their fuzziness about Bush, people basically either were 
not aware or were divided in their views concerning the President's positions 
on banning military-style assault rifles, bailing out troubled savings and loan 
institutions and aiding the Nicaraguan Contras. 
</P>
<P>
The jury also is still out on whether Bush will be able to keep his promises to 
become "the education President," protect the environment and create "a kinder, 
gentler America." 
</P>
<P>
On foreign affairs, 40% approve of Bush's performance. But eight years ago, 68% 
approved of how Reagan was handling foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Half of those surveyed felt that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has 
"taken more forceful positions in foreign policy" than has Bush. Only 
one-fourth believe that Bush has been the more forceful. But nearly two-thirds 
think that Bush ultimately will sign an arms control treaty with the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
When asked, "What is the most important problem facing this country?" nearly 
two-thirds answered drugs. But three-fourths lacked confidence that Bush "will 
be able to bring the drug crisis under control." 
</P>
<P>
Ranking next in importance, but far behind drugs, were the budget deficit and 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Comparing Bush to Reagan, people tended to think that the new President would 
"know more about what's going on in his Administration." 
</P>
<P>
But whatever problems with popularity Bush has pales when compared to his vice 
president, Dan Quayle. The public's impression of Quayle is not very high -- 
31% favorable, 29% unfavorable and 40% not sure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
EVALUATING BUSH'S FIRST 100 DAYS

<P>
Americans generally have an open mind about George Bush....

<P>
Q. What phrases best fit President Bush?

<P>
We ought to give him a chance: 50%He wants to do the right thing: 34He doesn't 
seem to know where he's going: 15He's a nice person: 15He doesn't care about 
people like me: 13He's too close to special interests: 9He doesn't tell the 
truth: 9He's a great leader: 7(Adds up to more than 100% because of multiple 
responses) 
</P>
<P>
....but he has yet to win major support on many specifics.

</P>
<P>
BRADLEY AMASSES DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In trading that has increased in intensity over the last several years, Los 
Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley has built up his personal investment portfolio with 
stocks, valuable real estate and, in one notable gamble, junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
A Times study showed the diverse portfolio has been accumulated, in part, by 
trading in stocks and bonds involved in some big corporate financial deals, 
including three handled by Drexel Burnham Lambert and its junk bond operation 
headed by Michael Milken. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has received some of his largest political contributions from Drexel 
and Milken's brother, Lowell Milken, and was instrumental in launching a 
congressional lobbying effort to persuade the Securities and Exchange 
Commission into allowing the firm to keep its junk bonds operation in Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Milken has since been indicted on charges of racketeering, insider trading and 
securities fraud. While there is no indication that Bradley had any connection 
with Milken's troubles, an intensifying investigation into the mayor's personal 
finances prompted him to announce Thursday that he has placed his portfolio 
into a blind trust. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, I voluntarily take another step to reinforce my bond of trust with the 
people," Bradley said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The action is the latest in the series of moves the mayor has taken since 
disclosure that he has accepted more than $100,000 in fees from two local 
financial institutions that have had dealings with the city. Those disclosures 
set off a furor, and prompted an investigation by City Atty. James K. Hahn, who 
has asked for Police Department assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Under heavy criticism, the mayor in recent weeks has returned $18,000 in 
adviser fees to Far East National Bank. Then, a day after his surprisingly 
narrow reelection victory, Bradley resigned from the board of Valley Federal 
Savings &amp; Loan Assn. He also established a committee to write a tougher 
ethics code for city officials. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last two weeks, The Times has researched the financial holdings that 
Bradley disclosed in the statements of economic interests that public officials 
are required to file. The information was supplemented by data from financial 
reporting services and interviews. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Broad Ranges 
</P>
<P>
Because elected officials are required to disclose the value of their 
investments only in broad ranges, it was impossible to accurately determine the 
current worth of the holdings Bradley will put into the trust. 
</P>
<P>
Asked in an interview Thursday how much he is worth, Bradley replied, "I have 
no idea, I couldn't tell you that." 
</P>
<P>
While the mayor agreed to an interview only on grounds that questions would be 
restricted to his blind trust, he did comment on his investing. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no magic in it," he said. "I don't know any expert. My losses will 
justify that. . . . The market is a risk and you buy from the judgment of 
people. Sometimes they are right. Sometimes they are wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley declined to say who his broker was in any of his transactions. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he likes to "play" in the securities market, Bradley demurred. "Next 
you'll want to know if I play the horses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Among Bradley's investments was Beatrice Foods Inc. preferred stock he bought 
in March, 1986 -- one month before the company was acquired by BCI Holding Inc. 
in a controversial takeover financed by Drexel Burnham's high-yield junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The $6.2-billion leveraged buyout was one of the largest acquisitions of its 
kind. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's statement of economic interest shows that he purchased between 
$10,000 and $100,000 of Beatrice Foods stock. After he purchased the stock, its 
value rose sharply. That was because of a BCI stock conversion and other 
aspects of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
After the takeover, investigators for a congressional subcommittee looked at 
the deal, and last year reported that they found evidence that Drexel Burnham 
and its employees acquired significant equity in the Beatrice takeover 
transaction and profited from junk bonds that were later made available at an 
escalated price to customers. 
</P>
<P>
Questions also have been raised about the investment of Rep. Tony Coelho 
(D-Merced) in the Beatrice transaction. Coelho's involvement was particularly 
controversial because he obtained debentures (a form of corporate bonds) not 
normally available to individual investors. The investment netted Coelho a 
profit of $6,882 over six months. 
</P>
<P>
Wickes Corp. was another Bradley investment. He reported purchasing between 
$1,000 and $10,000 worth of Wickes Corp. common stock in June, 1985, shortly 
after the firm made a preferred stock offering to raise cash. After the 
offering, the price of the stock rose and Bradley sold his shares in March, 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment of Milken alleges that he manipulated the market to keep up the 
price of Wickes stock in April. But by that time, Bradley had reported that he 
had sold it. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor also purchased debentures in a successful leveraged buyout of 
Metromedia in 1984, when a group of executives took over the company in a deal 
involving Drexel Burnham. 
</P>
<P>
It was one of the largest junk bond deals at the time and the debentures were 
considered risky. But by the following year -- when Bradley sold them -- the 
bonds ultimately paid off at a premium, several brokers said, when financier 
Rupert Murdoch led another takeover of the firm. 
</P>
<P>
sh Political Supporter 
</P>
<P>
As one of the mayor's biggest political supporters, Drexel Burnham and its 
employees have given Bradley $72,700 in campaign contributions since 1983, 
including $8,600 from Lowell Milken. Bradley also has received $51,880 from 
employees of Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Assn., a Beverly Hills thrift that has 
invested heavily in junk bonds through Drexel. Michael Milken is a close 
acquaintance of Tom Spiegel, the president of Columbia who has had Bradley over 
for dinner at his home, according to the mayor's calendar. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley and Milken, who could not be reached for comment, have worked together 
on behalf of several community charity foundations, a source close to Milken 
said. Several months ago, Milken's personal public relations spokesman 
suggested that a Times reporter interview Bradley and a number of other Milken 
supporters for a profile story on the junk bond king. 
</P>
<P>
But on Thursday, the spokesman, Ken Lerer, said that he furnished the reporter 
with the name of William Elkins, the mayor's longtime aide, not Bradley's. 
Elkins sits on the board of directors of Columbia Savings. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley played a key role in helping to successfully bring pressure on the 
Securities and Exchange Commission in January to drop its demand as part of a 
securities fraud lawsuit that Drexel close Milken's junk-bond operation in 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel spokesman Steve Anreder told The Times that the firm solicited Bradley's 
help by asking him to call Rep. Coelho to arrange what one Coelho aide 
described as "some kind of coordinated effort" to persuade the SEC to drop its 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Acknowledges Contact 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the mayor acknowledged that Bradley contacted Coelho, but 
said that the phone call was spontaneous and was not made at the request of 
Drexel Burnham. 
</P>
<P>
In other investments, Bradley has traded in Gibraltar Savings &amp; Loan 
stocks, Mattel, Discovery Oil, Coast Savings &amp; Loan, Columbia Savings &amp; 
Loan, and Valley Federal, on whose board he had served. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley also is an investor in a Riverside County land deal put together by an 
old friend, Juanita St. John, who is also head of the Task Force for Africa-Los 
Angeles Relations. That organization's finances are being investigated by the 
city attorney and city controller. 
</P>
<P>
Records show that the mayor had been a relatively passive investor until the 
early 1980s, tending to buy and hold stocks for longer-term appreciation. But 
beginning in about 1983, the mayor became much more active in the market, in 
some cases buying and selling stocks in a matter of weeks or months. For 
example, in early 1986 the mayor bought and sold between $10,000 and $100,000 
of stock in Coast Savings &amp; Loan in a month. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said he began to think about setting up the blind trust immediately 
after the election. 
</P>
<P>
"I began tossing the idea around with various people, they all seemed to concur 
it would be a good step to take," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think in light of the time, a question of ethics has been raised . . . 
and we in this city need to at least take actions that will reinforce 
confidence of people in their elected leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said he has not named the person in charge of the trust.

JUSTICES SHARPLY LIMIT EMOTIONAL DISTRESS SUITS 
</P>

<P>
The state Supreme Court sharply limited emotional distress suits Thursday, 
ruling over a harsh dissent that a mother who did not actually see her child 
hit by a car cannot collect money damages. 
</P>
<P>
The court by a 5-2 vote said direct family members can collect damages for 
emotional distress only if they actually witness an injury-producing event and 
suffer emotional distress "beyond that which would be anticipated in a 
disinterested witness." 
</P>
<P>
Writing for the majority in a closely watched case, Justice David N. Eagleson 
said he was seeking to draw a clear line to govern emotional distress suits in 
the future and avoid "limitless liability out of all proportion to the degree 
of the defendant's negligence." 
</P>
<P>
Eagleson reasoned that if the court had opted to allow emotional distress 
claims by family members who do not witness accidents, insurance companies 
would be unable to issue insurance policies without "imposing unacceptable 
costs" on their policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
"That relatives will have severe emotional distress is an unavoidable aspect of 
the human condition," Eagleson said. He was joined by the court's four other 
conservative members. 
</P>
<P>
"The emotional distress for which monetary damages may be recovered, however, 
ought not to be that form of acute emotional distress or the transient 
emotional reaction to the occasional gruesome or horrible incident to which 
every person may potentially be exposed in an industrial and sometimes violent 
society." 
</P>
<P>
The court went on to emphasize that unrelated friends or unmarried partners may 
not collect for emotional distress -- "regardless of the depth of feeling or 
the resultant physical or mental illness that results from witnessing violent 
events." 
</P>
<P>
Dissenting Justice Allen E. Broussard called the ruling "myopic," and said it 
"will deny recovery to victims whose injuries from the negligent acts of others 
are very real." 
</P>

'Arbitrary Standard'

<P>
Broussard said the majority's "arbitrary standard" will "lead to unjust 
results." Under the new rule, Broussard said, a mother could not sue even if 
she saw "her 6-year-old son immediately after he was electrocuted, lying in a 
puddle of water in a dying state, gagging and choking." 
</P>
<P>
The decision overturned a Court of Appeal ruling in a San Diego case that would 
have allowed the mother, Maria E. Thing, to sue for emotional distress. She had 
been in her Lemon Grove home in December, 1980, when her daughter ran inside to 
say a car had run over her son, John. 
</P>
<P>
Thing rushed outside to find her son bleeding and unconscious. She thought he 
was dead. A Superior Court in San Diego dismissed the suit, finding that since 
she did not actually see the accident, she could not sue. 
</P>
<P>
The boy suffered a head injury and collected about $100,000 in a separate 
action against the motorist and his insurance company, according to the 
family's lawyer, Patrick F. O'Connor of El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
"This ruling restricts access to the courts for people who undeniably suffered 
harm from someone else's wrongdoing," O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
Marcelle E. Mihalla, the San Diego lawyer who represented motorist James V. La 
Chusa on behalf of the Automobile Club of Southern California, hailed the 
ruling, saying that "once you allow a plaintiff who wasn't at the scene to 
collect . . . the floodgate is opened." 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have reasonable limits to liability," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The case drew friend-of-the-court briefs from insurance companies that urged 
the tighter standard enunciated by the court on Thursday. The California Trial 
Lawyers Assn. argued for a looser standard. 
</P>
<P>
"The fear of a flood of lawsuits and claims of increased insurance rates has 
never been demonstrated to be true," said Douglas deVries, who wrote the trial 
lawyers' brief. 
</P>
<P>
"It's best left to a jury to decide whether the event really happened and the 
person really suffered the injury," DeVries said, adding that the ruling 
suggests that the court has a "distrust" of letting juries decide such issues. 
</P>
<P>
In the opinion, Eagleson criticized a landmark 1968 California Supreme Court 
ruling that allowed emotional distress suits by family members who saw, heard 
or in some other manner sensed an accident. It was the first ruling by a high 
court anywhere in the country that allowed such suits. 
</P>
<P>
Eagleson said the 1968 case, "like a pebble cast into the pond," created a 
proliferation of lawsuits and "ever-widening circles of liability" because of 
its "murky" standards. 
</P>
<P>
He went on to attack several emotional-distress opinions issued since the 1968 
case as evidence of the "expansive progression" of court decisions allowing 
emotional distress suits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cases Allowed to Proceed 
</P>
<P>
In one case, a suit was allowed to proceed after a family member was told the 
circumstances of an accident. In another, a mother was allowed to sue because 
she may have mentally reconstructed the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Eagleson, citing confusion in the lower courts, said the high court was under 
an "obligation to create a clear rule under which liability may be determined." 
</P>
<P>
"In doing so, we balance the impact of arbitrary lines which deny recovery to 
some victims whose injury is very real against that of imposing liability out 
of proportion to culpability for negligent acts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, in a dissent, Justice Stanley Mosk attacked the majority for "callous 
disregard" of rulings by the high court and courts of appeal, "some prevailing 
for three decades."

NO CAUSE FOUND FOR CRASH OF GUARD JET

<P>
An investigation of the crash of a California Air National Guard jet fighter 
that killed two officers in 1987 failed to establish the cause of the mishap, 
the Legislature was told Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The probe by the state auditor general, an investigative arm of the 
Legislature, was ordered by the Senate last year after charges by the widow of 
one victim that the National Guard and Air Force had "covered up" the 
circumstances of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate told the auditor general to examine aircraft maintenance, air crew 
training and flight safety activities of the Air Guard's 144th Fighter 
Interceptor Wing at Fresno, where the F-4 jet and its crew was assigned. 
</P>
<P>
However, Kurt R. Sjoberg, acting auditor general, said in his report to the 
Legislature that although certain records were made available to his 
inspectors, the report on the Air Force's own investigation of the accident was 
withheld and other key documents were routinely destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials, Sjoberg said, declined to give a reason for withholding 
the accident report, invoking "executive privilege." 
</P>
<P>
Killed in the low-altitude maneuver over the desert in Arizona in June, 1987, 
were the pilot, Capt. Wesley Deane, 27, of Modesto, and the weapons officer, 
Maj. John Jordan Jr., 39, of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan's widow, Toni, had waged an eight-month effort to learn details of the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
She said the Air Guard had ignored recommendations for reform of its management 
and safety procedures made before the crash that killed her husband. She 
contended that if the recommendations had been implemented the crash might not 
have occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Jordan said the Air Guard has refused to acknowledge the existence of a 
document she managed to obtain independently. It showed, she said, that 
although the pilot was qualified to fly the F-4, his training records had been 
falsified to indicate that he also was qualified to make the type of tricky 
high-speed, low-altitude maneuver she said he was making at the time of the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
The auditor general's report, based in part on documents made available by the 
Air Guard, confirmed that "the pilot logged into his training records 
low-altitude training events that he did not actually fly" so as to make it 
appear he was qualified to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Sjoberg said records dealing with flight safety, training and aircraft 
maintenance before the flight had been routinely destroyed in accordance with 
Air Force rules and that the records "that did exist were either not available 
to us or were not complete enough for us to review."

The Communist Party has restored membership to dissident historian Roy A. 
Medvedev, whose writings about the personality cult of dictator Josef Stalin 
prompted his expulsion in 1969, Tass said today. 
</P>
<P>
Medvedev had asked the party's Central Committee Control Committee to be 
restored as a party member, and the request was approved, the official news 
agency said without giving a date for the action. Like many Soviets who had 
fallen out of official favor, Medvedev has gradually been restored to good 
graces. He was elected April 9 as a deputy to the new Soviet parliament, the 
Congress of People's Deputies.

A 9-year-old boy with a history of arson confessed to police today that he and 
an 8-year-old friend vandalized and set fire to their school in Boyle Heights, 
causing $275,000 damage. 
</P>
<P>
Hollenbeck Station Juvenile Detective Ben Lovato said he took the boy into 
custody at 7:30 a.m. at the youngster's home. The boy admitted that he and his 
companion -- neither a gang member -- spray-painted gang graffiti on the 
classroom walls and piled items in the center of the room before setting the 
fire, Lovato said. Police were still looking for the 8-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was set in a second-floor classroom at the Malabar Elementary School 
at 1:29 a.m. Thursday and was extinguished about 40 minutes later. No one was 
hurt.

NO BAIL FOR 4 IN N.Y. PARK CASE; RACISM ALLEGED

Four more youths indicted in the Central Park attack on a woman jogger that a 
prosecutor called "the most vicious and brutal assault" in New York City 
history were denied bail today in court sessions that exploded with charges of 
racism. 
</P>
<P>
The bail hearing for one of the youths, Michael Briscoe, 17, was interrupted 
when black activist attorney Alton Maddox Jr. violated an agreement that he 
remain silent as Briscoe's attorney, Joseph Mack, spoke to State Supreme Court 
Justice Carol Berkman. 
</P>
<P>
When he persisted in trying to speak, the judge ordered Maddox to join the 
spectators behind the courtroom rail. 
</P>
<P>
"You're a bunch of racists! This is a kangaroo court!" two dozen black 
supporters led by the Rev. Al Sharpton shouted. They surged forward as a dozen 
court officers rushed to form a human wall at the rail. 
</P>
<P>
Berkman left the bench and returned only after the group followed Maddox's 
instructions to sit down. 
</P>
<P>
Maddox and Mack then wheeled and stormed from the courtroom, followed by their 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Maddox and Sharpton were figures in the case last year of Tawana Brawley, a 
black teen-ager whose tale of abduction, rape and abuse was eventually 
discredited. 
</P>
<P>
In all, seven youths are being held without bail in the rape and beating of a 
Wall Street investment banker who was jogging through Central Park on April 19. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, from the Pittsburgh suburb of Upper St. Clair, remained in a coma 
for the eighth day at Metropolitan Hospital today. 
</P>
<P>
Her accused attackers are Kevin Richardson, 14; Steve Lopez, 15; Kharey Wise, 
16; Raymond Santana, 14; Antron McCray, 15; Yusef Salaam, 15, and Briscoe. 
</P>
<P>
An eighth youth arrested in the rape, Clarence Thomas, 14, was released to his 
mother's custody Thursday after a grand jury failed to indict him within the 
legal time limits. An indictment against him is still possible.

BUSH GIVES GO-AHEAD TO JAPAN FIGHTER DEAL

<P>
President Bush today decided to go ahead with the controversial FSX fighter 
deal with Japan after reaching agreement with Tokyo on several key conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The project is controversial because, critics say, it would result in the 
United State giving its technology to Japan that would hurt America's 
competitive advantage in aviation. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has deliberated for many weeks on the pros and cons of the deal, which 
would involve production of the fighter plan known as FSX by General Dynamics 
and Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. 
</P>
<P>
The plane is a modified version of the U.S.-built F-16. 
</P>
<P>
The President had said he wanted to go ahead with the joint venture as long as 
the agreement would safeguard U.S. technology. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional sources, who spoke on condition they not be identified, said the 
Japanese government had agreed to ensure that 40% of the estimated $5-billion 
production run on the plane will be handled in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese had already agreed to give U.S. companies a 40% share of the FSX's 
estimated $1.2 billion development work. 
</P>
<P>
On another key point, the congressional sources said, the Japanese agreed to 
U.S. requests for protection of sensitive source codes used for computers 
aboard the plane. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan Administration negotiated the arrangement initially after Japan 
refused to buy any U.S. F-16 fighters and indicated it would build its own 
fighter plane.

14 BRITONS SENTENCED TO 3 YEARS FOR ROLES IN 1985 BELGIAN SOCCER RIOT THAT

Fourteen British soccer fans were convicted of involuntary manslaughter today 
and sentenced to three years in prison for their roles in a 1985 riot that 
killed 39 people at Heysel Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The fans, all from Liverpool, also were fined $1,538 each. Eleven fans were 
acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
The three-judge panel that handed down the verdicts suspended half of each 
prison sentence. Afterward, the 14 convicted fans left Belgium. They have 15 
days to appeal their sentence. 
</P>
<P>
The 14 have already served six months in pretrial custody, which means that 
they probably will serve no more than a few months behind bars. In Belgium, 
convicts generally serve a third of their sentence. 
</P>
<P>
After the May 29, 1985, disaster, English soccer clubs, such as Liverpool and 
Manchester United, were banned from European competition. The ban did not 
affect England's national teams, which can still compete for the European Cup 
and the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
The verdicts came in the wake of Britain's worst sports disaster. On April 15, 
95 people were killed in a stadium stampede when fans tried to crowd into a 
standing-room-only section during a match between Liverpool and Nottingham 
Forest in Sheffield, England. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Roosens, the former Belgian Soccer Federation chairman, was given a 
six-month suspended sentence for negligence and poor organization of the Heysel 
soccer match. 
</P>
<P>
A senior police officer, Johan Mahieu, received a nine-month suspended sentence 
for grave omissions of duty. 
</P>
<P>
Five officials were held blameless. 
</P>
<P>
They included Jacques Georges, president of the European Union of Football 
Assns., Europe's ruling soccer body; former organization General Secretary Hans 
Bangerter, and Michel Kensier, a Belgian police officer. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish wholeheartedly we will never have to face court again and that soccer 
will only bring family entertainment from now on," Georges said. 
</P>
<P>
Also acquitted were Brussels Mayor Herve Brouhon and Viviane Baro, a former 
Brussels alderman for sports. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 39 deaths, more than 500 people were injured when Liverpool 
fans rioted at Belgium's Heysel Stadium just before the start of the 1985 
European soccer championship final between Liverpool and Juventus Turin of 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Belgian authorities had requested the extradition of 26 Britons based on 
videotapes and pictures showing British fans tearing down the flimsy fence 
separating them from Italian supporters. 
</P>
<P>
The invasion of the stands caused a panic during which victims were trampled to 
death as they tried to flee. Most of the victims were Italian.

Former Teamsters Union President Roy Lee Williams died today at his farm home 
after a lengthy bout with emphysema and heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, 73, was released from federal prison in September after serving three 
years of a 10-year sentence for attempting to bribe a senator over trucking 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Williams served as international president of the Teamsters Union from 1981 to 
'83. 
</P>
<P>
He was forced to resign after he was convicted in December, 1982, of trying to 
bribe former Sen. Howard Cannon of Nevada to influence trucking deregulation. 
Cannon was not charged in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Though he maintained his innocence during the 1982 trial, Williams acknowledged

'NICOTINE PATCH' USED TO KICK HABIT

<TEXT>
<P>
More than three-quarters of the people trying to quit smoking were able to do 
so with the help of nicotine patches in a study at the Mayo Clinic, researchers 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
In a six-week study that started last fall, 77% of the people who wore nicotine 
patches had stopped smoking, said Dr. Richard Hurt, director of the Mayo 
Clinic's Smoking Cessation Center and one of the investigators. 
</P>
<P>
The silver-dollar-sized patches slowly release nicotine through the skin to the 
bloodstream. A control group in the study wore patches not treated with 
nicotine, and 39% of them quit smoking. 
</P>
<P>
While cautioning that a long-term follow-up study is needed, Hurt said the 
patch could be a "remarkable advancement" as a tool for helping people stop 
smoking.

<P>
A bitter 18-month effort by the United Auto Workers to organize the Mack Trucks 
Inc. assembly plant ended with 53% of the employees voting to accept union 
representation. 
</P>
<P>
Mack Trucks said today it will contest Thursday's election, which the UAW won 
with 453 votes to 398 for the company. An employee group, which offered to 
represent workers, received two votes. 
</P>
<P>
"It is totally on hold until it is settled," company spokeswoman Deb Woolley 
said. "Mack is not finished fighting this battle." 
</P>
<P>
Observers predicted the outcome of the election could affect the way business 
is conducted in South Carolina, which historically has ranked among the least 
unionized states. Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. moved quickly to assure business 
owners and workers that "right-to-work" labor laws will not change in South 
Carolina.

The historic firearms business that gave Colt Industries Inc. its name will be 
sold, company officials in New York announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Colt is trying to find a buyer for Colt Firearms, which employs 1,100 workers 
at two plants in West Hartford and Hartford, spokesman Michael G. Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
The firearms division, which has been mired in a 3-year-old strike, also 
recently lost its contract to manufacture M-16 rifles for the military. But 
Dunn said neither was a factor in today's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Colt management decided the company should focus on its aerospace, automobile 
and industrial services sectors, Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn refused to disclose sales and revenue figures for the firearms division. 
Colt Industries, based in New York, is a privately held company and does not 
publicly disclose its financial statements. 
</P>
<P>
Colt was founded in 1836 in Hartford by Samuel Colt, the inventor of the famous 
Colt .45 handgun. Dunn said he would expect a purchaser of the gun manufacturer 
to retain the Colt name.

The European Community's Executive Commission today proposed banning the import 
of furs from animals caught in leg-hold traps. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would ban imports of furs or fur products originating "in a country 
where the leg-hold trap is still used or where the trapping methods used for 
the listed species do not meet internationally agreed humane trapping 
standards," the commission said. Listed species included beaver, otter, coyote, 
wolf, lynx, bobcat, sable and raccoon. 
</P>
<P>
The leg-hold trap has been banned in more than 60 countries -- but not in 
Canada, the United States or the Soviet Union.

Liverpool has turned down an offer from West Berlin authorities for a charity 
soccer match to raise money for the relatives of the 95 victims of the 
Sheffield disaster, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The English club turned down the offer to play in West Berlin because of a 
crowded league schedule until the end of the season that made it impossible at 
this time to find a free date for the proposed charity match. Officials of the 
West Berlin Senate said Mayor Walter Momper is hoping to arrange the match at a 
later date. 
</P>
<P>
British military authorities had agreed to provide a plane to fly the Liverpool 
team to West Berlin, officials said.

Mats Wilander of Sweden and Boris Becker of West Germany, the top two seeds, 
continued on a collision course today as they won their quarterfinals at the 
$607,500 Monte Carlo Open tennis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander, top-seeded and ranked No. 2 in the world, topped Ronald Agenor of 
Haiti, the No. 10 seed, 6-3, 7-6, 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the longest I've gone in a tournament since the U.S. Open," Wilander 
said. In 1988 he won three of the four Grand Slam tournaments but has had a 
poor start in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Becker, second seeded and ranked third in the world, whipped a clay-court 
specialist, Guillermo Perez-Roldan of Argentina, 6-3, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
"I played good tennis and had a good time. I enjoyed it," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
In another quarterfinal, Horst Skoff of Austria, seeded 13th, gained a 6-4, 6-4 
decision over Jan Gunnarsson of Sweden. Skoff also made the semifinals at Monte 
Carlo two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Alberto Mancini of Argentina downed Carl Uwe Steeb of West Germany 6-3, 
6-3. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament, the first major clay-court event of the season, offers a 
$122,900 first-place prize. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander, who won Monte Carlo in 1987, was down 1-3 in the first set when he 
won five straight games.
