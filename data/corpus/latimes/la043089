That chorus of clicks heard throughout the land on April 16 was not a castanets 
recital, nor was it an invasion of crickets. It was the sound of television 
sets being turned off after about 15 minutes of "Around the World in 80 Days."

A WILL ROGERS FOR THE LATE '80S; 
</P>
<P>
REFLECTIONS IN A JAUNDICED EYE BY FLORENCE KING (ST. MARTIN'S PRESS: $15.95; 
198 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Pratapaditya Pal, Pal has cultivated his own jaundiced eye as senior curator 
of South Asian art at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not everyone will agree with Florence King's assessments of America and the 
American way of life, but few readers will remain unaffected by her insouciant 
wit, even if it is true, as she claims, that "wit has never played well in 
America." How can one suppress a chuckle when one reads: 
</P>
<P>
"I went home, mixed a martini, and turned on the television. Three commercials 
in a row assured me that Eastern Air Lines, Allied Van Lines and Ex-Lax -- 
movers and shakers all -- were my friends. Moreover, Ex-Lax was my family 
friend because it's gentle." 
</P>
<P>
King continues in her firm but gentle way to point out that "the phrase 'gentle 
laxative' is oxymoronic to the sane mind." In America, she writes, "the need to 
be nice is so consuming that nobody would dare take a laxative that makes you 
run up the stairs two at a time, pushing others aside and yelling 'Get out of 
the way!' " 
</P>
<P>
Until I received a review copy of "Reflections in a Jaundiced Eye," I was 
unfamiliar with King and her earlier books, "Southern Ladies and Gentlemen" and 
"Confessions of a Failed Southern Lady." Publishers of the present volume claim 
that, "both books have delighted hundreds of thousands of readers and won King 
a reputation as a wit to be reckoned with, and as a writer of style and power." 
Generally one should accept a publisher's blurb with several pinches of salt, 
but in this instance, I trust their claim. And however many readers she has, 
they will all be delighted with this new offering. 
</P>
<P>
King's chapter headings -- "Spinsterhood Is Powerful"; "From Captain Marvel to 
Captain Valium"; "Sex and the Saxon Churl"; "Phallus in Wonderland," and "Deja 
Views," to cite a few -- are as intriguing as they are satirical. My favorite, 
however, is "Democrazy." It is amazing how by simply replacing one letter, this 
much misunderstood and elusive word becomes so appropriate in characterizing 
the American political experience, or, as some would claim, the American 
kaleidoscope. King did not coin the expression. Ironically, it was used in 1946 
at the Japanese War Trials by Shumei Okawa, a former propaganda minister of 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
As King rightly comments, "We get democrazier by the minute." How else can one 
characterize such passionate and undemocratic discrimination against smokers, 
against women who want to decide what to do with their unborn babies, or 
against AIDS victims (even the unwitting ones)? "If you want to watch Americans 
throw democracy and equality to the winds and enshrine them at one and the same 
time," writes King, "get tapped for jury duty and listen while one side 
eliminates Catholics who went to college and the other side eliminates 
Protestants who went to high school, until there's nobody left but 12 people 
incapable of understanding the case. That's the jury." 
</P>
<P>
Although King appears on the surface to be a humorist, it would be a mistake to 
consider her social commentary lightweight. She is seriously concerned about 
such matters as the emasculation of the American male and the feminization of 
the nation as a whole. Her advice to her fellow women: "It's time for American 
women to stop wailing 'He never talks to me!' and let men be men, instead of 
fashioning dross out of gold and calling it 'humanized.' " While some feminists 
may ignore this piece of wisdom, surely everyone will admit that "self-help 
books are making life downright unsafe." And who can doubt that "America is not 
a democracy, it's an absolute monarchy ruled by King Kid"? "Reflections in a 
Jaundiced Eye" is replete with such delectable one-liners. 
</P>
<P>
If Will Rogers, that quintessential American nice guy, were alive today, 
watching television commercials, reading self-help books, being seated in the 
few remaining smoking sections, would his benign eye not have grown a bit 
jaundiced? I think so. And I urge those unfamiliar with Florence King's 
jaundiced eye to sacrifice a few hours with the idiot box and read her book. 
More than any of her male competitors, she is the Will Rogers of our day.

THE SPELL OF A SOFT VOICE; 
</P>
<P>
WE ARE STILL MARRIED; 
</P>
<P>
STORIES &amp; LETTERS BY GARRISON KEILLOR (VIKING: $18.95; 328 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lawrence Christon, Christon is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Garrison Keillor, as you must know from those serpentine, rapt monologues he 
spun out weekly in front of his "Prairie Home Companion" radio microphone, is a 
born storyteller -- you could almost hear his thoughts gather and carry like 
quickening weather. He isn't confined to Lake Wobegon's home-cooked anecdotes 
in "We Are Still Married," however. America is the recipient of that soft, 
ruminant voice's report, even when momentarily transported to Denmark or 
Greece. 
</P>
<P>
The book is a compilation of stories, letters and some of the unsigned pieces 
he wrote for The New Yorker magazine's "Talk of the Town" section. Few of them 
are directly autobiographical, but in almost all you can make out the tall 
figure of this (prematurely) "old and irritable man" shunting between 
indignation over the Reagan years -- and the fathomless disappointment America 
has visited on the lives of its adults -- and the continuous wonder and 
anticipation of setting out, whether from the anvil-hard flatland of 
Fundamentalist Anoka, Minn., or on a horrible subway ride to New York's 
Woodlawn cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
Most of his satire is tinder dry. "Who We Were and What We Meant by It" is a 
sendup of every arts movement in America in the last 30 years that 
self-destructed the moment the matchstick of reality touched the cloud of its 
flatulence, only to be enshrined in the memory of its True Believers -- people 
who were never there in the first place. "The Current Crisis in Remorse" rivals 
his earlier gem, "Jack Smith, Arts Administrator," for its handling of cynical 
social service bureaucracy, and not incidentally, a phenomenon quite in keeping 
with our current moral dislocation, where the first thing we want to do in the 
wake of something terrible is to forget about it, "put it behind us." 
</P>
<P>
"A Little Help" applies lethal paper cuts to the overblown sanctimoniousness of 
show-biz celebrities bent on Good Causes. "Meeting Famous People," conversely, 
shows us a celebrity ignominiously and fatally victimized by fans and other 
parasites. "Lifestyle" describes a quick arc of Yuppie gentrification and 
collapse of a town called South Roxy, imploded in a paper economy, a boutique 
mentality. 
</P>
<P>
That increasingly busy, trashy emptiness yawning under America like a 
continental toxic dump is something that draws Keillor's concern and even anger 
(he calls television "that sleaze hole"). He's equally fascinated with the 
benign image of Ronald Reagan that floats over the landscape like a happy face. 
Of Reagan, he writes: "He himself was a huge success, the most outrageously 
successful, high-flying Irish politician of his day, with a honey voice and a 
twinkle and a wave and a duck of the head, the most boyish seventy-five-year 
old man in America, hard to lay a glove on, as light as a kite. Nothing he said 
ever came back to haunt him. His mastery of the air baffled and dazed his 
enemies, who couldn't take seriously a man who refused to face up to the facts 
of the American decline." 
</P>
<P>
But Keillor is not a polemicist. If you hear the gloom of mistrust in the voice 
of this shy man out of synch with the various hustles that surround him, the 
character that peers out from these composite pages has an enormous capacity 
for tolerance and wonder. Anoka was a place to flee from, but it gave him a 
religious gift. Few writers could get away with a passage titled "The Meaning 
of Life," for example, without having you glance over at the liquor cabinet for 
a stiff reprieve from a good man's tedious earnestness. 
</P>
<P>
"Even in a time of elephantine vanity and greed," he writes, "one never has to 
look far to see the campfires of gentle people. If we had no other purpose in 
life, it would be good enough to simply take care of them and goose them once 
in a while." The vulgarity of "goosing" someone may be what saves this passage 
from sentimentality, but the segment as a whole is characteristic of Keillor's 
faith in regeneration; that tone of sharp-eyed appreciation permeates the book. 
And his characters stay true to themselves. In "What Did We Do Wrong?" a tough 
tobacco-chewing young woman named Annie Szemanski becomes a huge success as a 
major league ballplayer, but won't otherwise play to anyone's expectations -- 
either feminist or front office or fan -- and packs it in, as intractable as 
Bartleby the Scrivener. 
</P>
<P>
Early on Keillor writes: "My cash crop is humor, a bastard genre of literature 
that includes Mark Twain and the gentleman of the old firm of Benchley, 
Thurber, Perelman &amp; White and also includes 'How to Talk Suth'n,' 'Buddy's 
Big Book of Booger Jokes' and 'Funny Fotos of Cats in Hats,' a mixed field." 
</P>
<P>
Keillor is well-placed in the old firm. His prose is clear and adroit (though 
his poetry is tone-deaf), and his humor works in the tradition of corrective 
clear-sightedness. The underlying impulse of this book is the gathering of 
wisdom. Even in the title story, an allegory of a fairly ordinary married 
couple thrust into fame by a snoopy magazine reporter, the process of celebrity 
distorts their lives into hideous tabloid blowups and nearly wrecks their 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the characters in "We Are Still Married" click apart like billiard 
balls. But many more gather each other in. Willa returns to Earl in Minnesota 
from New York with the corpse of Biddy, their dog. 
</P>
<P>
"My friends can't believe I took her back after all those things she said about 
me, but I can't see where it's any of their business. I told her there was no 
need for her to apologize, so she hasn't. She did scrap the movie project and 
the book, though. The substitute-host deal fell through when the regular host 
decided he wasn't so tired after all. Except for our two dogs, Betty and Burt, 
we're almost where we were last summer. The ice has melted on Lake Larson, the 
lilacs and chokecherries are in bloom, soon the goslings will hatch and their 
mothers will lead them down to water, and everything will be as if none of this 
ever happened."

"The Wonder Years" is a wonderful program. I hope ABC does not discontinue it. 
When the network advertised the premiere of "Have Faith," I was afraid it was 
scheduled to replace "The Wonder Years." Fortunately, it did not. That was when 
I decided to write. I don't want to feel guilty for not telling someone that 
the high quality of "The Wonder Years" is appreciated.

NEW ROCK ALBUM EXORCISES YEARS OF DRUGS, INSECURITIES

Well, I was wise in my own eyes 
</P>
<P>
 I awoke one day and I realized 
</P>
<P>
 You know this attitude comes from cocaine lies. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lyrics by Dion and Bill Tuohy 
</P>
<P>
On the day after he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Dion 
DiMucci sat in an Italian restaurant near Times Square and spoke about how 
drugs almost ruined his life. 
</P>
<P>
Dion, 49, had recently completed his first secular album in a decade, and on 
the record's key moments he sounds as if he's still exorcising some of the pain 
he felt in those drug-plagued years. Titled "Yo Frankie," the album is due 
Tuesday from Arista Records. 
</P>
<P>
But Dion's words at the restaurant didn't represent yet another tale of how 
someone struggled all his life to achieve fame, only to get involved with drugs 
and see the success all slip away. 
</P>
<P>
In Dion's case (DiMucci has always been known professionally by just his first 
name), the involvement with drugs began well before he broke onto the pop scene 
in the late '50s with such classic hits as "A Teenager in Love" and "The 
Wanderer." 
</P>
<P>
Raised on the mean streets of the Bronx, Dion turned to drugs and gangs in a 
search for confidence and self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
He was hooked on heroin at 15, survived an overdose at 16 and eventually formed 
a vocal group, the Belmonts, that was named after an avenue in the 
neighborhood. The quartet's snappy "I Wonder Why" was a hit in 1958 for tiny 
Laurie Records, and Dion was off on a hectic pop merry-go-round that lasted 
more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
With the Belmonts and then on his own, Dion registered a dozen Top 10 hits. He 
was rivaled perhaps only by Bobby Darin as the '50s' most compelling young 
white singer outside of the Southern brigade of Elvis and Jerry Lee. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia Records was so impressed in 1962 that the industry giant signed Dion 
to a five-year contract for $500,000 -- a staggering commitment, considering 
that RCA had paid less than $50,000 seven years earlier for Elvis Presley's 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
But it was a confusing period for Dion. He loved rock 'n' roll, but industry 
hotshots kept telling him that rock was just a fad -- kid stuff. If he was 
serious about a career, they said, he'd have to move over into the adult pop 
arena. 
</P>
<P>
Even back at Laurie Records, he had been encouraged to sing old pop standards, 
including "Fools Rush In" and "One for My Baby," and dress up in a sport jacket 
and a silk ascot for the cover photo of his first solo album. 
</P>
<P>
The pressures and the drugs had caught up with Dion by the mid-'60s, turning 
his life into a nightmare darkened by thoughts of suicide. Alienated, Dion 
moved to Florida in 1968 with his wife and baby daughter in hopes of rebuilding 
his life. 
</P>
<P>
"I made $2 million by the age of 22 . . . had 10 top 10 records . . . was at 
the height of my profession," Dion said about those early days during the 
restaurant interview. 
</P>
<P>
"I had all the bases covered. . . . Fame, fortune and romance. I had even 
married my childhood sweetheart. But I was empty. I was looking out the 
penthouse window and saying, 'What the hell is wrong?' What I finally 
discovered was that I had others' esteem, but I didn't have self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
 Schools gave me nothing needed 
</P>
<P>
 To my throne, I proceeded 
</P>
<P>
 Every warning went unheeded. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, king of the New York streets 
</P>
<P>
 -- From Dion's "King of the New York Streets." 
</P>
<P>
Dion was at an unpretentious family-style restaurant to shoot a video for his 
new album. The idea was to show him in the old milieu which is reflected in new 
songs such as "King of the New York Streets." 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant is several miles from the Bronx intersection of 187th Street and 
Cortina Avenue -- the real center of Dion's world in the '50s. But the 
atmosphere was similar enough for the video. You get a sense there is sometimes 
trouble in this neighborhood, too, when you notice that the Guardian Angels 
hotline number is written in much bigger letters on the wall near the pay phone 
than the police department's emergency number. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his tough-guy past, Dion seemed unusually patient and soft-spoken. He 
appeared very much at peace with himself. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing his ever-present cap, Dion smiled warmly when some restaurant employees 
asked for an autograph. Back home in Boca Raton, Fla., where he lives with his 
wife and the youngest of his three daughters, he can go weeks at a time without 
anyone recognizing him. 
</P>
<P>
But Dion is part of the pop history of New York. When he stepped outside the 
restaurant for a photo, a man in his 30s spotted him immediately. The passer-by 
said he had read in the paper about the Hall of Fame dinner and asked if Dion 
was going to have a new album soon. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, pretty soon," Dion said. "Hope you like it." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I still love 'The Wanderer.' Got anything like that in it?" 
</P>
<P>
"These are new songs, but yeah," Dion replied. "There's a song like 'The 
Wanderer' but it's like about a guy bragging about his girl, not about 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
"Sounds cool," the fan said as he reached into his pocket for a piece of paper. 
He, too, wanted an autograph. 
</P>
<P>
Dion fell in love with country music at an early age, and before he was in his 
teens he sometimes sang at social clubs and local bars. Later, Dion fell in 
love with rock 'n' roll -- both the rockabilly sounds coming out of Memphis and 
the doo-wop vocal harmonizing associated with New York street corners. 
</P>
<P>
In his 1988 biography, "The Wanderer," Dion described the excitement of having 
his own hit record. "One minute we were four mooks on the street, the next, 
everyone wanted to get close to us. . . . You never wanted it to stop, and the 
only way to keep it going, it seemed to us, was to smile, sing and try to sort 
it all out later." 
</P>
<P>
There was a vocal swagger in his most memorable recordings, including "The 
Wanderer" and "Ruby Baby," that defined New York cool so well that Lou Reed -- 
the epitome of New York cool to later generations of rock fans -- reminisced at 
the Hall of Fame induction dinner about how much Dion's records meant to him. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately after their first hit, "I Wonder Why," Dion &amp; the 
Belmonts were on Dick Clark's "American Bandstand" TV show and touring the 
country with Buddy Holly and Richie Valens (he turned down an offer to join 
Holly, Valens and the Big Bopper on the fatal 1959 plane ride). 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to imagine those years being anything but thrilling, but the memories 
eventually became painful for Dion. He felt such shame about the period that he 
refused to sing the early hits. 
</P>
<P>
"When the light finally shined through, I realized the shame had nothing to do 
with the songs," he said in the restaurant. "To be honest, I think the shame 
was way before I even started drugs. I think it came from my whole background. 
I just never felt right about myself. 
</P>
<P>
"There was never a word of praise in my house. . . . A lot of demeaning talk 
and criticism. I never felt good about myself -- and the success didn't change 
things." 
</P>
<P>
The turning point in rebuilding his life, Dion said, came shortly after he 
moved to Florida in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
"I had simply run out of excuses," he said. "I was using a lot of drugs, 
drinking heavily and I just looked up to the heavens and said, 'God, help me' 
and He did. In a split second, the compulsion and the obsession to drink and 
drug came right out of me. 
</P>
<P>
"I started to read the Bible and different spiritual writings and I started to 
see that my values came from how much God loves me, not from how many records I 
sell." 
</P>
<P>
After embracing Christianity in 1968, he gave up drugs and continued to make 
records. The poignant "Abraham, Martin and John" was a Top 10 hit in 1968, but 
his folk-flavored albums for Warner Bros. in the '70s went largely unnoticed, 
and Dion spent most of the '80s singing and recording on the gospel music 
circuit. 
</P>
<P>
The return to the pop world began on an emotional night in the summer of 1987. 
Some old friends at a New York radio station asked Dion if he wanted to be part 
of an oldies show at Radio City Music Hall. 
</P>
<P>
His first instinct was to say no, but Dion saw the evening as a way to make 
peace with himself and his past. It was time to stop blaming the songs for his 
early pain. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell Cohen, now vice president of East Coast artists and repertoire for 
Arista Records, was in the audience that night and later contacted Dion. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, that evening was like coming full circle," Cohen, 38, explained in a 
separate interview. "Dion was the headliner on the first rock show I ever saw . 
. . 1961 at the Brooklyn Paramount. It just struck me that night (at Radio 
City) that he was still a performer with a tremendous amount of vitality and 
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
"When we got together later, he said he was doing some songwriting and he gave 
us the impression that he was ready to take another shot." 
</P>
<P>
With English rocker Dave Edmunds as producer, Dion went into the studio last 
year and recorded "Yo Frankie." He wrote or co-wrote seven of the 10 tunes. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the tracks seem too polished and predictable, but the heart of the 
album -- including the playful nostalgia of "Written on the Subway Walls" and, 
especially, the wry introspection of "King of the New York Streets" -- bursts 
forth with a sense of triumph and survival. 
</P>
<P>
The album's most poignant moment may be Dion's version of a tender 1974 Tom 
Waits song. Though it was written as "San Diego Serenade," Dion likes to think 
of the tune as "New York Serenade" because, he said, it seems to summarize so 
well his feelings about not realizing what you've got until it's gone. 
</P>
<P>
The song's opening lines: 
</P>
<P>
 Never saw the morning till I stayed up all night 
</P>
<P>
 Never saw the sunshine until I turned out the light 
</P>
<P>
 Never saw my hometown till I stayed away too long 
</P>
<P>
 And I never heard the melody till I needed the song 
</P>
<P>
 Dion's early hits alone would have been reason enough for record executives at 
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction dinner here in January to give the 
singer a standing ovation when he walked on stage to accept the honor. But the 
executives' applause also seemed to acknowledge Dion's struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in the restaurant the next day, he said: "Last night was great because 
. . . you are in the business 30 years, and songs are like a diary in which you 
share yourself with people. . . . Your love, your hates, your joys, your 
dreams. The applause was like everyone saying, 'Hey, you touched us' . . . . It 
was a validation after all those years of people telling me in the beginning 
that my music and all rock 'n' roll was somehow illegitimate." 
</P>
<P>
Dion, who's looking forward to touring this summer, paused. He seemed to want 
to make sure the reporter didn't think that music again was becoming the way he 
measured his worth. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very grateful," Dion said finally. "I've been married to the girl of my 
dreams for 25 years and we have three healthy children that love me. The music 
is only part of me. It just happens to be what other people see. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you all the times I've had people look at me like I was an 
8-by-10 glossy of someone who existed 10 or 20 years ago. They are talking to 
an image that they think they know. It's like Bob Dylan said: 'Just because 
they know my record, they don't know me.' The important thing for someone in 
this business is to realize that distinction . . . not to get into thinking you 
are that 8-by-10 glossy."

"I'm 50," says Ted Turner with a melancholy moan. "It's amazing how it sneaks 
up on you, isn't it? Seems like only yesterday I was younger." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, yesterday he was younger. And tomorrow he'll be older still. But 
something about Ted Turner still suggests the bloom of youth. He still has 
visions, some of them goofy, and still has dreams. Whatever one may think of 
him -- and just about everyone has an opinion -- no one can take away his place 
in modern communications history. 
</P>
<P>
He made his mark, and the mark is CNN, the Cable News Network, launched by 
Turner in 1980 when cable was still a soggy baby. The first 24-hour all-news 
network, CNN has survived some rough early years to become a prominent and 
valued landmark on America's electronic horizon. 
</P>
<P>
But as Turner's empire has grown, his own role within it has shrunk. Top-heavy 
with debt, Turner had to bring in other investors and share control of his 
company with them. Only recently, when Turner wanted to make a bid on the 
Financial News Network (FNN), another cable outfit, the board of directors of 
Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc. put the kibosh on the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"It slows us up some over what it was before," Turner acknowledges. 
</P>
<P>
He speaks in his trademark sleepy drawl, his droopy eyelids at half mast. But 
Ted Turner is hardly out of energy. He is not a man to run from a fight, and is 
much more likely to start one. Lately he's been attacking NBC, owners of CNBC, 
the new "consumer news" cable channel that signed on April 17. Chartered not to 
be a duplicate of CNN, Turner is nevertheless suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
"What's 'consumer news' ?" he asks. "News of interest to consumers. Like, what 
happened in the world today." 
</P>
<P>
That's the mild version of his objection. A more Turneresque torpedo was fired 
during a speech to Washington's Metro Cable Club on March 8. He called GE, 
which owns NBC, "the most corrupt corporation in America." 
</P>
<P>
Ah, Captain Outrageous, ever unvarnished. But another of Turner's controversies 
has to do with varnish he does apply: the computer coloring of old 
black-and-white movies from the MGM, Warner Bros., and RKO libraries that 
Turner bought. He is completely unapologetic about it, though he does concede 
that colorizing was pretty ghastly when first introduced. 
</P>
<P>
Turner's old movies, colorized and uncolorized, are unreeled on WTBS, the 
Atlanta-based SuperStation that goes to hundreds of cable systems, and on TNT 
("Turner Network Television"), the latest venture, set up mainly to help 
amortize the costs of buying the movies in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to all these enterprises, Ted Turner has one other big passion: 
saving the planet Earth from destruction. He started the Better World Society 
to encourage pacifist and ecologically minded programming. He himself ordered 
production of "Portrait of the Soviet Union," a seven-part glasnosty travelogue 
that was so glossy and rosy a view of the U.S.S.R. that the Soviets themselves 
ran a disclaimer when they showed it on state-owned television. 
</P>
<P>
Again, Turner has no apologies. He says "Soviet Union" was no more positive 
than was his "Portrait of America" series, shown previously on his cable 
channels. "That's why I didn't say 'picture.' I didn't say 'Accurate Picture of 
the Soviet Union.' I said 'portrait.' And when you're painting a portrait, you 
leave out the blemishes, right?" 
</P>
<P>
There would be plenty of blemishes to leave out of a portrait of Ted Turner. 
But there is also much to admire. He scoffs at those who play it safe -- 
whether individuals or companies -- and who shy away from new risks. "The 
golden age of cable is dawning," Turner says. If so, he has played an enormous 
role in bringing it about. He's the Charles A. Lindbergh of cable television, 
still flying bravely by the seat of his pants.

THE EYE THAT REINTERPRETS; 
</P>
<P>
MINOR WHITE EXHIBIT: IS THE ADMIRATION SHAPED BY THE EXPERIENCE OF THE WORK OR 
CURATORIAL FLIMFLAM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Minor White was surely an exceptionally nice man. As dedicated to photography 
as a cloistered monk, he believed its practice could act as a tool of spiritual 
self-discovery. He taught that odd faith until his death in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
He is just as surely the least well-known of classic American "straight" 
photographers whose ranks include such heroes as Alfred Stieglitz, Edward 
Weston and Ansel Adams, all friends and mentors. White admired and emulated 
them just as he sifted through esoteric religions, the I-Ching and astrology in 
his search for enlightenment. He was the very model of the artist who 
approaches his work like a religious suppliant and it is poignant to remember 
him in these cynical times. If his kind of photography has evolved into an 
academic cliche it is because of its enduring substance 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Museum of Modern Art hosts the very first major retrospective of 
White's work. After closing here June 18, it will travel to cities where he 
worked and taught -- Minneapolis, Rochester and Boston. Its closest approach to 
Los Angeles will be San Francisco where he worked after World War II. It will 
appear at that city's Museum of Modern Art in June, 1990. In 1991, it will go 
to rest in Princeton where he bequeathed his archive. 
</P>
<P>
A survey that includes 185 prints and probes even unknown aspects of White's 
life and art certainly ought to prove whether Minor was great or Minor was . . 
. minor. The compendium is subtitled "The Eye That Shapes." Unfortunately, this 
attempt to do White justice raises questions so large and troubling that one is 
not certain in the end whether one's admiring eye has been shaped by its own 
experience of the work or gently coerced by suave curatorial flimflam. 
</P>
<P>
The show was organized by Princeton University professor and curator Peter C. 
Bunnell. It is not unusual for curators to clarify works through various forms 
of grouping and juxtaposition. Bunnell, however, has shaped this material to a 
point where we are obliged to wonder whether the work has been distilled to its 
own essence or so entirely reinterpreted as to become at least as much 
Bunnell's artwork as White's. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than pursuing the musty but effective convention of setting the work out 
in simple chronological order, Bunnell presents it in thematic sequences that 
seem significant to him. That act is all the more questionable since White 
himself came to believe less in the dominance of individual "masterpiece" 
photograph and more in somewhat cinematic sequences of images. Rather than 
respecting White's order, Bunnell simply created his own from the thousands of 
images in the archive. This may not be quite as intrusive as pasting together 
your own version of "Birth of a Nation" but it is somewhere in that territory. 
</P>
<P>
In some instances, Bunnell's juxtapositions are too cunning for their own good. 
The cover of the handsome catalogue, for example, sets a male nude of 1948 next 
to some tree branches shot in 1951. The boy's hands and the branches make the 
same gesture. It's a nice conceit but the rhyme is Bunnell's, not White's. The 
coupling is revelatory, but of what? 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition and catalogue suffer from what we might call the "Lust for Life" 
syndrome. The catalogue begins with an extensive biographical chronology that 
tugs at our heartstrings with accounts of White's troubled childhood in 
Minneapolis, his early interest in science, poetry and theater, his military 
service and his evolution into an itinerant photographer and teacher -- moving 
from Portland to a beloved San Francisco to depressing Rochester. 
</P>
<P>
If we are not made sufficiently sympathetic by this factual account we then get 
a long section of writings derived from his own letters and journals. A granite 
boulder would be touched by White's selfless dedication to his students and 
friends. He signed his letters "Lufffff" as if just "Love" was not enough. He 
practiced photography with the ecstatic naivete of a convert and came to 
identify it with the tao, the Oriental "right way" to put one's spirit in touch 
with transcendent nature. He studied esoteric religions of both East and West, 
finally joining the Gurdjieff sect. He started life looking like a leprechaun 
and ended it with the aura of a kindly guru. He managed the whole thing without 
once sounding like a demagogue or a flake. 
</P>
<P>
Reading all that is like reading "Lust for Life," the biography of Vincent Van 
Gogh, before you've ever seen a Van Gogh. When you do, you cannot at first tell 
if you love the art because of the man or vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
In White's case, at least according to Bunnell, it was all because he loved the 
man, or rather men. Minor White was a homosexual and that heretofore veiled 
fact appears to be the central touchstone of the curator's thematic 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition begins with the shadowed face of a sloe-eyed youth taken in 
1975. It is followed by an image of a thrusting chimney (Erection!), a wave 
crashing against a rock (Orgasm!) and a piece of twisted driftwood 
(Self-loathing and Agony!) 
</P>
<P>
Come on. Is somebody kidding us here or what? Art-making is often an act of 
sexual sublimation. Is this news? When did Freud say that? Nineteen-aught-six 
or something. 
</P>
<P>
And yet the very next pair of images are the tender face of a young chap set 
next to a stone visage from Peru. 
</P>
<P>
The entire exhibition is anchored on heretofore unshown images of homoerotic 
nudes whose penises, navels and shadowed behinds are then linked to 
progressively more abstract images that resemble them -- often vaguely. One has 
literally seen this sort of thing done in arty-erotic heterosexual photo 
essays. It was cliched and pretentious then and it's worse in the hallowed 
halls of the Museum of Modern Art. 
</P>
<P>
The organizational principle casts an excessively literal 
this-happened-because-of-that aura over the work. The curator finds an image of 
a woman with a flower in her hair, so every flower becomes a symbol of feminine 
fecundity. The curator finds an image of a handsome strong lady next to a rough 
stone cliff and every outcropping becomes White's fear of furious femininity. 
</P>
<P>
By now we have been railroaded into such a symbolic and autobiographic frame of 
mind White can't even take shots of some charming street urchins without 
causing us to think, "Hmmph, just self-pity over his tough childhood." 
</P>
<P>
It was the last thing he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
In 1961, he wrote to a student whose pictures conveyed homosexual Angst he knew 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"Your photographs," he wrote, "are still mirrors of yourself . . . the images 
raw, the emotions naked. To present these to others they need appropriate 
clothes. These are private images, not public ones. They are 'expressive 
meaning,' a direct mirror of yourself rather than 'creative' meaning so 
converted as to affect others as 'mirrors of themselves.' " 
</P>
<P>
White wanted his art to transcend the merely autobiographic but this exhibition 
tends to the opposite and trivializes the work. At best it looks like a 
well-intentioned attempt to expose the anatomy of the creative process. 
Excessive literalism delivers it into a mechanistic 19th-Century realm where it 
was believed that El Greco painted square halos because he was astigmatic. 
</P>
<P>
No one should suppress the known facts of an artist's life but no one should 
forget that White did not make his best work because he was gay or Picasso 
paint his masterpieces because he was a satyr. They made their best work by 
transcending their temporal limits. Every artist looks at his own best work 
with the awed conviction that it was done by somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
It is very tiresome to spend this much time on an exhibition and still not know 
with certainty what its author accomplished -- or even exactly who its author 
is. 
</P>
<P>
If the machete of the mind is capable of hacking through the surrounding 
tangle, it seems that there was something almost willfully minor about Minor 
White. He chose to use photography -- that most obdurately prosaic of mediums 
-- to try to convey the unseeable and the unknowable. 
</P>
<P>
He was perfectly capable of producing a grandiose mountainscape in the manner 
of his friend Ansel Adams but such work feels exactly like the homage that it 
is. We glimpse White when he finds a mountain surrounded by clouds that look 
like smoke signals from some playful deity. 
</P>
<P>
White was at his best in the application of his sweet longing for transcendence 
to stubbornly realistic subjects. A peeling doorway becomes beatific as a holy 
light expands across it. A lyricism not of Eros sparkles in a dandelion puff. 
Crackled wood grain takes on the delicate complexity of a Bach sonata. There is 
real mournfulness in the realization that the eye of God is a porcelain fixture 
with a burned out bulb. 
</P>
<P>
White felt most at peace with meditative Oriental philosophies and he 
photographed with the gentle accuracy of a Zen calligrapher. Worldly ambition 
is not part of such an enterprise

PARIS OPERA RISES ON BUNKER HILL; 
</P>
<P>
SETTING THE STAGE FOR OPENING OF 'THE PHANTOM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

There are plastic tarps everywhere at the Ahmanson. Covering the carpets, 
covering the seats. Huge light boxes are stacked in the lower lobby. Electric 
cables crisscross the floors backstage. Dozens of props -- the Phantom's organ, 
a bed, the famous chandelier -- are unceremoniously piled together on stage. 
Gold-leaf figurines smile down from the rafters. Drills are humming, machinery 
is moving up and down, walkie-talkies are abuzz with workmen conferring. 
</P>
<P>
"The Phantom of the Opera" is moving in. 
</P>
<P>
"This production will be as spectacular as the original, (designed in London by 
Maria Bjornson) -- if not more so," promised associate designer Dana Kenn, who 
oversaw "The Phantom's" Broadway staging, as well as one in Toyko last spring. 
In this staging, work began at the Ahmanson the first week of March, with more 
than 50 full-time workers in various posts. For Kenn, the responsibility will 
continue way into the run, when she will periodically come in from New York to 
inspect the show and issue a "report card" on its status. 
</P>
<P>
"This production is larger than the one in New York," the designer said. "The 
actual stage space is deeper here, the proscenium is a bit larger. So the show 
has also gotten bigger -- and it feels more expansive." 
</P>
<P>
Expensive too. Although Kenn is not giving out exact numbers, she admits the 
pre-production has cost "several million dollars." She adds: "But it's also 
been put in like a permanent installation -- they're thinking (of being here) 
two or three years." 
</P>
<P>
Backstage, there are six painted draperies, 10 full-stage "fancy Victorian" 
ones. Bleachers hold 20 life-size mannequins (for a joke, someone's outfitted 
them with sunglasses); nearby is a 12-foot-high gray elephant replica that 
appears in the "Hannibal" opera number. Large sculptures, constructed from 
fireproof resin and Fiberglas, have been flown in from England; smaller ones 
were built in New York. Most of the decorative pieces are painted in shimmering 
gold leaf -- the better to see from the Ahmanson's second balcony. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the most extensive part of the renovation has been the stage itself. A 
new floor was constructed -- and with it, a specially devised basement 
structure to accommodate the machinery to conjure up the on-stage magic: 167 
traps have been drilled in the stage floor, from which a group of silver 
candelabras and 125 candles will rise. The effect takes place during the 
Phantom's gondola ride (on a "lake" simulated by dry ice and fog) when he takes 
the soprano Christine to his lair. 
</P>
<P>
Kenn (who began working on this staging last July and is currently preparing 
the national company tour) noted: "There are 37 men running scenery and lights, 
16 dressers for 35 actors, 8 wig people, 5 makeup artists. It's a city back 
there. And it's all moving so fast." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the technical controls -- such as those for the sound and lighting -- 
are via computer devices, while the motorized effects (such as the Phantom's 
gondola) are powered by a radio-controlled mechanism. " 'Les Miserables' has 
maybe six or seven special effects," Kenn pointed out. "We have 57. So there's 
a huge amount of mechanisms." Which, she acknowledged, occasionally break down: 
"We had a final dress rehearsal in New York where a lot of things went wrong; 
it was like a train wreck. But it was all fixed the next day. And it never 
happened again." 
</P>
<P>
Seth Felson isn't vaguely theorizing that "The Phantom of the Opera" will be a 
merchandising bonanza in Los Angeles. He's counting on it. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a special kind of show to support a merchandising program," said the 
president of Loring &amp; Matthews, merchandisers for DeWynters Advertising, 
the London-based concessionaire for "Les Miz" and "Phantom." 
</P>
<P>
"Visually, musically, philosophically, the show has to be huge. You're selling 
a mystique, especially with this one. My spiel is, 'Take the Phantom home with 
you.' " 
</P>
<P>
The memory makers come in various forms -- some of which are already available 
at the Music Center Gift Shop. Since last November, $9,740 worth of Phantom 
merchandise has been sold. The in-house concession stands will feature: 
T-shirts ($15), sweat shirts ($22), mugs ($10), matches ($5), buttons ($2), 
window cards ($12), songbooks ($15), records ($22), cassettes ($22), compact 
discs ($40), "Phantom perfume" ($35), silver-plated key rings ($15), "The 
Complete Phantom" (a history of the show, $30), souvenir programs ($5) and 
postcards ($1). 
</P>
<P>
But note: These are not just ordinary T-shirts, sweat shirts and mugs. The 
garments are emblazoned with a white Phantom logo that glows green in the dark, 
thanks to phosphorescent ink. And the white-mask logo mysteriously appears on 
the plain black "magic mug" when the container is filled with hot liquid (a 
special oxidized ink creates the effect). "We're shipping thousands of 
everything," Felson added. "I've already sold $2 million in 50 weeks in New 
York; we're anticipating sales of $40,000 a week in L.A. We're in this for the 
long haul."

THE FEAR NO AMERICAN WOMAN DARES FORGET; 
</P>
<P>
THE FEMALE FEAR BY MARGARET T. GORDON AND STEPHANIE RIGER (THE FREE PRESS: 
$19.95; 225 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Laura J. Lederer, Lederer is the editor of Take Back the Night, a collection 
of articles by women against pornography. It was published by William Morrow in 
1980. She is now director of social concerns at The L. J. and Mary C. Skaggs 
Foundation, a private philanthropic group in Southern California.

<TEXT>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir liked to tell a story about a Cabinet meeting 
she attended in which the ministers were discussing an outbreak of sexual 
assault on women at night. One minister suggested a curfew: Women should stay 
home after dark in order to avoid being raped. "But," said Meir, "it's the men 
who are attacking the women. If there's to be a curfew, let the men stay home, 
not the women." 
</P>
<P>
In "The Female Fear," authors Margaret T. Gordon of Northwestern University and 
Stephanie Riger of Lake Forest College use an innovative and original study to 
demonstrate how our attitudes toward rape in the United States closely parallel 
those of the minister who suggested a curfew: It is women, they write, who are 
held responsible for preventing rape. As a result, they suffer devastating 
emotional consequences and severe limitation of opportunity to be active 
participants in public life. 
</P>
<P>
In a startling survey designed to prove the pervasiveness of female fear in our 
society, Gordon and Riger interviewed nearly 400 men and women in three major 
U.S. cities. Respondents were asked a series of questions about how they 
conduct their daily lives -- questions that might seem insignificant in and of 
themselves, but which, taken together, demonstrate beyond a doubt that women 
restrict their activities in order to protect themselves, that they often 
create small strategies to deal with the fear of rape, and that they spend a 
good deal more time than men do worrying about assault. 
</P>
<P>
For example, respondents were asked, "how often do you drive rather than walk 
because of fear of being harmed?" (women, 56%; men 18%), or "how often do you 
carry keys in your hand when going to your car?" (women, 82%; men, 44%), or 
again, "how often do you cross the street when you see someone who seems 
strange or dangerous?" (women 52%, men, 25%), or finally, "how often do you go 
out with a friend or two as protection?" (women, 51%; men 4%). There are a 
series of 30 such questions and in each case the answers are strikingly 
gender-stratified. The authors conclude that "rape is of significant concern 
for most (women), and all women are forced to live their lives in its shadow." 
</P>
<P>
Incredibly, the United States has the highest rate of rape in the world. In a 
fascinating chapter called "The Realities of Rape," the authors take a close 
look at rape statistics in our country. They compare and contrast numbers from 
the Uniform Crime Reports (which are based on local police reports and are 
compiled by the FBI) with the numbers from the National Crime Survey (conducted 
in conjunction with the U.S. Census). Police reports recorded a total of 90,434 
forcible rapes in 1986, which is a rate of 73 women raped per 100,000 women 
(one rape every six minutes). But census figures are much higher, indicating 
that 220 women of every 100,000 are raped (one rape every two minutes). The 
authors note that the FBI definition of rape is quite stringent, and that there 
are many errors and omissions. For example, each crime is tabulated in a single 
crime classification according to the most severe offense. Thus, a rape-murder 
would be classified solely as a murder. In addition, say the authors, many 
women do not report sexual assault to the police, but they may indicate that 
they have been raped in answer to a census question. 
</P>
<P>
There have been dozens of books about rape written since Susan Brownmiller's 
1975 ground-breaking work, "Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape." But most 
have been psychological studies, political treatises, prevention handbooks, 
victim's rights analyses, firsthand accounts of women who have been raped and, 
of late, books examining rape survivors' tactics. This book is clearly in a 
class all its own. Calmly, but relentlessly, it explores what one researcher 
calls, "the male prerogative as a social support for rape and other abuses of 
women." It succeeds in shifting the focus from the individual woman who is 
raped to the social institutions and agents in this country that contribute to 
a climate where rape is accepted as a fact of life. This must change, the 
authors insist: "The freedom to walk safely through city streets should be a 
right enjoyed by every citizen in a nation which calls itself the land of the 
free." 
</P>
<P>
A chapter titled "Society's Responsibility" suggests nine major steps we can 
take to allay female fear of sexual assault and reduce rape, the authors touch 
on the role of the mass media, college educators, legislators, policy-makers, 
communities, police departments and individual citizens in creating a 
rape-resistant culture, and call for the "full weight of social institutions" 
to be brought to bear against the conditions that cause rape. They conclude 
with a moving chapter about a 33-year-old minister who was raped while five of 
her colleagues were tied up in her living room. A year after the rape, the 
minister gathered with a number of her friends in a ritual "rite of passage" -- 
to mark what she hoped would be the end of a difficult year of anxiety, 
mourning, grief, fear and anger. Friends were asked to bring a special symbol 
of hope and healing to give to her. They were also asked to share their 
thoughts about the rape, and about sexual assault in general. The authors 
describe the ritual in detail, and in so doing, evoke for the reader the 
emotional pain of all the participants, whose lives had been permanently 
changed by the assault of their friend: "Most of them had not before known a 
rape victim, and they understood, for the first time, the depth of the 
devastation wrought by the crime. They saw how important it was to express 
their caring to Susan and to one another. They shared Susan's pain, and learned 
that Susan's rape and its aftermath were not just Susan's problems, but also 
theirs. They saw that rape is not only a problem for victims, but for our 
entire society." 
</P>
<P>
This is a powerful book that begins with a scientific study and ends with 
individual human experience. It is research and writing at its best: executed 
with technical care and scientific expertise, but never for a moment separated 
from its specific purpose of improving the quality and value of life for women 
and men in our society.

HAVING IT ALL IN THE 14TH CENTURY; 
</P>
<P>
A VISION OF LIGHT BY JUDITH MERKLE RILEY (DELACORTE PRESS: $19.95; 442 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If all the chronicles of earthly life were recorded with such drama, flair and 
wit, the world would be filled with history majors. 
</P>
<P>
This fascinating and factual historical romance, rooted in the real life and 
hard times of 14th-Century Europe scarred almost beyond recognition by the 
Black Plague, is a richly brocaded text that illumines this barely civilized 
but highly charged pre-Renaissance period. 
</P>
<P>
Similar in some ways to Barbara Tuchman's stately but more academic "A Distant 
Mirror," which meticulously delineates that same period but uses instead the 
life of a nobleman to personalize the record, Judith Merkle Riley in her "A 
Vision of Light" plucks one imaginary woman from those hazard-strewn days and 
follows her perilous journey to selfhood. No mean feat for a woman in those 
days. But Margaret was no ordinary woman. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret of Ashbury, unusual in her struggle to learn -- even high-born women 
were illiterate in medieval times and some even rather proud of it -- is an 
early model of determination coupled with tenderness, the ideal marriage of 
both her masculine and feminine natures. 
</P>
<P>
From childhood on, Margaret manages to retain her goodness, her faith in God 
and her grit. Added to these uncommon character traits is her gift for healing, 
which manifested itself as a light one day in an abandoned church not far from 
a hut in the forest where she lived with a midwife named Hilde. This encounter 
occurred while she was recovering from her near death during childbirth. Once 
well again, thanks to Hilde's herbs and potions, the two women and Hilde's 
idiot but harmless teen-age son embark on a journey that plunges them into 
perilous adventures and new opportunities to follow their independent natures. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to her basic intelligence and powers of observation, Margaret is an apt 
pupil, and in time both of them earn well-deserved good reputations as 
midwives. Margaret's gift of healing and her charitable nature produces a loyal 
following of those who love and admire her. She also generates a following 
among those who fear and envy her. Notable are bishops in the church, who 
perceive her gift as a threat to their authority and control and take steps to 
eliminate her. Her cruel first husband -- long thought dead in the plague -- 
turns up to haunt her too. 
</P>
<P>
But Margaret's healing gift finally brings her to a love-blessed marriage with 
a much older man who sees nothing at all unusual in her wanting to learn to 
read and write. With the help of Brother Gregory, an impoverished priest who 
serves as her scribe, Margaret of Ashbury pours out the story of her dangerous, 
exciting and variegated life, and we follow her every step of the way. 
</P>
<P>
"A Vision of Light" is a first novel for author Riley, who teaches government 
studies at Claremont McKenna College and the Claremont Graduate School of 
California. Most of her research for the book was done at the Huntington 
Library.

THE HOUSE THAT PIZZA BUILT; 
</P>
<P>
DOMINO'S MANSION; 
</P>
<P>
THOMAS MONAGHAN, GUNNAR BIRKERTS AND THE SPIRIT OF FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT BY GORDON 
P. BUGBEE (SOUTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY PRESS: $40; 184 PP.; ILLUSTRATED; 
0-9621045-0-7) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ross Miller, Miller writes on architecture and lives in Connecticut. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas Monaghan is a postmodern American entrepreneur. Where the old-style 
capitalist built railroads, made steel and dug for oil, the contemporary type 
produces nothing durable. Ray Kroc's McDonald's is the best-known of the 
postwar fortunes made from the new service economy. Fast food is more 
profitable than steel and a lot cheaper to produce. Monaghan's Domino's Pizza 
business grew from one store in Ypsilanti, Mich., run by him and his brother in 
1960, to a vast pizza empire. Gordon Bugbee's "Domino's Mansions" describes the 
chairman's self-conscious transformation from college dropout to a significant 
patron of American architecture. 
</P>
<P>
The story has been told at least once before. Monaghan and Robert Anderson 
chronicled the company's history in "Pizza Tiger" (1986). Why another book? 
Bugbee, described as a "Harvard-trained architect," has assembled a strange 
mixture of fact and legend in this beautifully illustrated book. He struggles 
to integrate the pizza baron's business success with his obsessive interest in 
Frank Lloyd Wright. Monaghan has bought houses, furniture and drawings of the 
architect. His new Ann Arbor corporate headquarters houses his collection in 
what he calls The National Center for the Study of Frank Lloyd Wright at 
Domino's Farms. But he is no ordinary collector. Monaghan has gone a few steps 
further and, in effect, hired Wright as a posthumous collaborator for Domino's 
ambitious building program. 
</P>
<P>
Delivering pizza in fewer than 30 minutes was the corporation's great 
conceptual breakthrough. Hiring Gunnar Birkerts, a competent modernist 
architect, to adapt some of Wright's unbuilt projects, specifically the early 
prairie-style McCormick House and his Golden Beacon, a 1950s tower on Chicago's 
Gold Coast, made Domino's an oddball mixture of art patron and corporate 
booster. Bugbee finds nothing unusual in any of this. 
</P>
<P>
He humorlessly recalls the story of how Wright's Taliesin Fellowship was asked 
to unearth the master's moribund plans for the Golden Beacon. Monaghan's grand 
plans for Domino's Farms call for a tower rising above both the Michigan 
flatlands and Birkert's low-slung Prairie-esque buildings. Bugbee's tone is 
ever respectful: "Tailoring the Golden Beacon to the needs of Domino's Pizza 
risked diluting the majesty of the concept. The company wanted a 30-story tower 
instead of the original 50-plus. (The number 30 has canonical meaning to 
Domino's Pizza; company policy insists that a pizza be delivered no longer than 
30 minutes after the order is taken over the phone.)" 
</P>
<P>
Bugbee's use of words like majesty and canonical is typical of the book's 
overinflated rhetoric and a key to its essential dishonesty. Had this work been 
presented as a pure exercise in vanity and self-promotion or just a catalogue 
to Monaghan's remarkable cache of Wrightian objects it might have joined a long 
list of glorified self-presentations from Andrew Carnegie's to Donald Trump's. 
But Bugbee is involved in a serious confusion of motives. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to mind-numbing portraits of Monaghan, Birkerts and a gaggle of 
Domino corporate officers, he offers a condensed history of modern American 
architecture. This is a confusion further encouraged in a foreword to the book 
by Yale's celebrated architectural historian, Vincent Scully. He too joins the 
uncritical celebration of the chairman's love of the automobile, the land and 
all things American. 
</P>
<P>
Domino's includes a working farm next to its Ann Arbor headquarters. Prof. 
Scully volunteers his own imprimatur to establish at least a rhetorical link 
between the Monaghan-Birkerts-Wright project and the more complex history of 
modern architecture. Bugbee goes on at length to insinuate this project into a 
list of acknowledged masterpieces that include Louis Sullivan's Guaranty 
Building (1894), Eliel Saarinen's Tribune Tower proposal (1922), and Ludwig 
Mies van der Rohe's Crown Hall (1952-56) on the campus of the Illinois 
Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
Scully adds to the list, "When fully occupied by a number of going business 
concerns, and accompanied by its complementary tower, the long, low-rise office 
building between the superhighways will inevitably be read as a bold emblem of 
Broadacre City itself and a glorification of Wright's beloved image of urban 
decentralization along the automobile roads." Wright's Broadacre City was to be 
a democratic experiment out in the country. It was not to be a city owned by 
one man. In real admiration for their subject, Bugbee and Scully twist history 
into an ornament for the top of Monaghan's tree. This kind of gassy promotion 
makes you run for relief under the Golden Arches or to the soft kitsch of the 
red-and-blue dominoes. 
</P>
<P>
Monaghan should be encouraged in his quest for "quality" and "excellence." His 
Domino's Farms complex is in the tradition of sterile campus corporate 
headquarters pioneered by the General Motors' Technical Center (1951-57) 
designed by the Saarinens with whom Birkerts apprenticed. 
</P>
<P>
Bugbee misses the opportunity to question the assumptions that led Thomas 
Monaghan to locate his business away from the city and in a 19th-Century 
fantasy pastoral of cows and happy workers. One of the illustrations has this 
caption: "The EBA Club is an upgraded cafeteria where all Domino's Pizza people 
may feel at home. Once a month, all Domino's Pizza staff don the uniform of 
pizza throwers as a gesture of solidarity with the franchises." It's this kind 
of goofy stuff that makes this book entertaining. "Domino's Mansion" is neither 
an objective history of Domino's nor American architecture, but more like a 
pizza, a messy mixture of cheese, sauce and dough.

BAY COUNTRY Reflections on the Chesapeake by Tom Horton (Ticknor &amp; Fields: 
$7.95) 
</P>
<P>
Winner of the 1988 John Burroughs Medal, this collection of essays by a 
Baltimore Sun environmental writer combines a genuine love for the landscape 
and wildlife that surrounds us with a measured assessment of the incursions 
made by man into the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"I never met a tree I didn't like," Horton begins his essay about the vanishing 
elm. His language is nostalgic as he writes about Windmill Point on Maryland's 
Eastern Shore where he caught the "biggest silver- and black-striped rockfish a 
boy of 12 ever saw. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
While it was the rockfish, or striped bass, that put a stop to New York City's 
controversial Westway project ("a federal judge found that a landfill, needed 
for the project to achieve its lucrative commercial potential, would illegally 
devastate acres of rockfish habitat along the Hudson's edge"), Horton also 
notes that it was the 33rd-floor ledge of a high-rise building in downtown 
Baltimore that saw the hatching of wild peregrine falcon chicks. 
</P>
<P>
Horton "is no wilderness freak," wrote Richard Eder in his review. "He loves 
wilderness and he also loves the shaping gestures that mankind has made upon it 
for all the centuries before powerful technology turned each gesture into an 
obliterating Gulliver's footprint." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TWICE AS LESS Black English and the Performance of Black Students in 
Mathematics and Science by Eleanor Wilson Orr (W.W. Norton: $8.95) 
</P>
<P>
"The car traveling twice as fast would take twice as less hours to cover each 
mile," Orr quotes one of her students as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike teachers who simply dismiss black English vernacular (BEV) as "badly 
learned English," Eleanor Wilson Orr (founder of the Hawthorne School in 
Washington and a high school teacher of mathematics and science for more than 
30 years) shows that mathematical stumbling blocks for some black students lie 
not in an unwillingness to learn but in a misapprehension of specific words in 
standard English and hence a misunderstanding of quantitative relations. 
</P>
<P>
Most instructive is Orr's explanation of "how the students combine the standard 
English as and than modes of expressing comparisons and how the resulting 
combinations are related to a lack of distinction between addition and 
multiplication and between subtraction and division and thus to a confusion 
between twice and half." 
</P>
<P>
Black English vernacular, "like any other language, is rule-governed," Orr 
maintains. As a judge ruled in Ann Arbor, Mich., in 1979, teachers "could do a 
better job teaching BEV speakers if the teachers knew more about the features 
of the language the children brought to school." 
</P>
<P>
"Orr has a revealing story to tell," Milton Chen wrote in these pages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE KNOCKOUT ARTIST by Harry Crews (Perennial Library/ Harper &amp; Row: $7.95) 
</P>
<P>
Eugene "Knockout" Biggs had been a professional boxer with 72 knockouts to his 
name, but these days the only person he knocks out is literally himself: With 
the theme of "Rocky" as background music, he spins out in the center of a 
boxing ring, shows swift, lateral movements, blows his mouthpiece out of his 
mouth, lets his glass jaw go entirely slack, catches himself on the chin with a 
vicious right cross and down he goes -- for a large sum of money. 
</P>
<P>
The characters Eugene meets after his manager abandons him in New Orleans are a 
far cry from the kind of folks he knew back home on the farm in Georgia. 
"Oyster Boy," an adult homosexual businessman (J. Alfred Blasingame), has a 
penchant for crawling naked on all fours with a leash around his neck. Pete, 
another former boxer, now runs the movie projector in a theater specializing in 
"snuff" films -- where the murders seen on the screen depict real-life murders. 
Most are hookers, transvestites, transsexuals, homosexuals and drug addicts. 
</P>
<P>
The plot hinges on Blasingame's desire to acquire a real professional boxer. 
Knockout and Pete find a promising Cajun boy and his training begins. In the 
end, Knockout decides that the old dirt-poor Georgia farm wasn't so bad after 
all. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE RETURN OF MR. HOLLYWOOD by Josh Greenfeld (Carroll &amp; Graf: $8.95) 
</P>
<P>
Larry Lazar, director, auteur and hero of Josh Greenfeld's wry, comic novel, 
has "a terrific office" and "a terrific parking space too." He also has "a 
terrific wife, two sensational kids and no problems with fuel injectors, 
anti-smog devices or turbochargers in any of his cars." What he does not have, 
however, is "a winner." In other words, his last movie is a dud. 
</P>
<P>
"The Return of Mr. Hollywood" is a deadpan account of what happens when one of 
Hollywood's biggest sleazes (Lazar) confronts "real reality" (real life) when 
his mother dies and he must fly to New York for her funeral. 
</P>
<P>
Lazar's family saga is wild and amusing, but "The Return of Mr. Hollywood" is 
at its best in its dead-on send-up of Hollywood and Realpolitik big studio 
gamesmanship: Lazar hustling the neurasthenic studio proxy to sign off on his 
latest project; Lazar dodging an irate former "collaborationist" (a pretentious 
director's word for his screenwriter) who believes, accurately, that Lazar has 
stolen his idea (a guy has an affair with his girlfriend's daughter) for a 
movie called "Remember, Remember." 
</P>
<P>
As Joan Didion writes in her introduction, "The Return of Mr. Hollywood" is "an 
inside job, and a fine one, true to Hollywood because it is about more than 
Hollywood, as is Hollywood itself."

TRIPMASTER MONKEY His Fake Book by Maxine Hong Kingston (Alfred A. Knopf: 
$19.95; 339 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
"Kingston's first novel is fantastic, an eminent brush with a wild romancer. 
The Monkey King is the paramount metaphor in these stories; the simian moves 
are comic transformations."

FIRST FATHER, FIRST DAUGHTER A Memoir by Maureen Reagan (Little, Brown: $19.95; 
415 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
"A tale of perseverance. If personal growth is one of the fairest measures of 
people, this book convinced me that Maureen Reagan deserves more credit than 
she often gets." -- Keith Love

JULIE BROWN, QUEEN OF THE VALLEY; 
</P>
<P>
AT LONG LAST, SHE GETS TO THE SCREEN IN 'EARTH GIRLS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perched in the middle of a noisy Ventura Blvd. singles hang-out, working on her 
second bottle of mineral water, Julie Brown held her earrings out for 
inspection. 
</P>
<P>
From her left ear, she produced a silver heart which dangled below a matching 
silver ball. From her right, a huge ruby globe attached to a gold hoop. 
</P>
<P>
Hardly a matching set. "That's OK, I have four holes in my ears so I have lots 
of choices," Brown said, brushing back a tangled mane of henna-red hair. 
</P>
<P>
If invaders from Mars crash-landed in Studio City and demanded an audience with 
the Valley's Cinderella of Cool, you'd send them to Julie Brown's castle. Armed 
with a barbed wit and a fondness for the kookiest corners of pop culture, this 
tiny, red-headed dynamo is quickly making the leap from video cult heroine to 
showbiz personality. 
</P>
<P>
To use Brown's Valley Speak lingo -- she's a goddess in progress. 
</P>
<P>
Initially known for goofy novelty hits ("The Homecoming Queen's Got a Gun"), 
she's graduated to MTV stardom, courtesy of "Just Say Julie," a weekly 
half-hour spoof which bashes every video pop tart from Tiffany to Tawny Kitaen 
-- and has quickly become one of MTV's highest-rated programs. 
</P>
<P>
After years of delays, Brown makes her film debut May 12 in "Earth Girls Are 
Easy," a colorful musical-comedy which, she also co-wrote. Despite the critical 
kudos the movie is now receiving, the film sat on a shelf for two years waiting 
for a distributor. In between movie-promotion junkets, Brown has also been 
shooting "Julie Brown: The Show," the pilot for a proposed CBS-TV comedy series 
which is described as a "Dinah Shore for the '90's gone awry." 
</P>
<P>
"I think she's totally unique," said co-producer Ann Beatts, whose comedy 
credits include writing-producing stints on "Saturday Night Live" and "Square 
Pegs." "You always hear people described as multi-talented if they can simply 
read cue cards and open supermarkets. But Julie is smart, funny, loveable and 
has a great body. She can write, sing, dance -- I bet she can even roller-skate 
and paddle a canoe. 
</P>
<P>
"She's very reminiscent of Lucy and of Gilda Radner. They all have this very 
direct rapport with their audience -- they make you feel that it's incredibly 
important that you like them." 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to see why the ebullient, busty comedienne is such a hit as MTV's 
resident sex-bomb satirist. As hostess of a show set in a kitchen with an ocean 
liner-shaped sink, a stuffed white poodle (with shades) and a couch made out of 
artificial grass, Brown celebrates Valley schlock in all its giddy, 
giraffe-print splendor. Like Pee-wee Herman and Buster Poindexter, she's 
created a real-life cartoon character who tightropes across the border between 
camp and cool. 
</P>
<P>
A parody of an over-amped, bitterly-competitive airhead, Brown's MTV alter-ego 
gets most of her laughs from heaping abuse on the channel's endless parade of 
video vixens. 
</P>
<P>
On a now legendary "PMS" episode, Brown throws herself tearfully in front of 
her TV set, snacking on dog food and dissing a Debbie Gibson video, growling 
"How does she get guys like that? She's only 16 -- what sexual tricks could she 
know?" Later, having mistakenly aired a Tiffany clip, Brown tears the video out 
of the machine, heaves it across the room and -- waving a rifle -- shoots it 
like a skeet target, screeching, "Kill it before it multiplies!" 
</P>
<P>
In person, Brown is considerably less frenetic, but still appealingly fiendish. 
Exhausted after a long day of rehearsals for her CBS show ("How do you like my 
stress cough?" she said, hacking away) she marshalled enough energy to take a 
visitor on a mini-tour of the Valley. The first stop: a neon-drenched Gap 
outlet on Ventura Boulevard. Brown quickly darted inside, cruising for V-neck 
sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
As she left the store, two bags under her arm, she pondered her other vices -- 
besides shopping. "Let's see," she said. "Iced coffee . . . Hair dye . . . Is 
that a vice?" She laughed. "Wait a minute. How about boys? It was so obvious I 
forgot about it for a second. You don't ruin your life over coffee, do you?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it was Julie Brown's biggest break that almost ruined her life. After 
knocking around doing stand-up comedy and bit parts in sit-coms, Brown 
collaborated with writing partner Charlie Coffey and ex-husband Terrence 
McNally on "Earth Girls Are Easy," a musical fantasy about a trio of horny 
aliens whose spaceship lands in a Valley Girl's swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
The trio sold the script in 1985, with Brown slated to play the leading role. A 
star was not born. 
</P>
<P>
"I really crashed and burned,' " she explained, heading east on Ventura Blvd. 
"It was the ultimate professional nightmare. The whole point of me writing it 
was that the part was for me. But then they told me I couldn't star in it. They 
could only get it made with a name actress. I wasn't big enough. They wanted a 
real star." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the producers landed Geena Davis. Brown settled for the second-lead 
of Candy, a ditzy Valley beautician. 
</P>
<P>
"After all that, the movie went into turnaround," she recalled. "Finally, it 
got picked up by (the DeLaurentiis Group) which made the movie -- and then they 
went out of business! So we had to screen it for everybody and finally Vestron 
got interested and they've been real enthusiastic about distributing it and 
then Geena won an Oscar, which is just a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
Brown shrugged. "It's been 4 1/2 years since I first started doing this movie. 
I mean, I could've had children or gone to college already!" 
</P>
<P>
"Earth Girls" is such an affectionate satire of the Valley's loopy life style 
that it makes you wonder where Brown got such a keen eye for pop excess? 
</P>
<P>
"My family was very middle-class in the sense that everything looked perfect," 
she explained. "It was very Beaver Cleaver. But I don't think it was very real. 
It was like we were all on TV or something." 
</P>
<P>
At the movies one afternoon as a kid, Brown saw "Bye Bye Birdie." "It changed 
my life," she said. "I still want to go see Ann-Margret. That scene in 'Birdie' 
where she squeezes her breasts together . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Brown beamed. "I think it finally made me understand what it was like to be a 
woman." 
</P>
<P>
This new sensibility did not make Brown an ideal parochial school student. "I 
think I got my attitude that the world was totally bizarre by going to Catholic 
school," Brown said. "It was like Nazi prison camp. The nuns made you into 
robots. They'd scare you, even sneak up behind you and hit you. It was the most 
repressive environment." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Catholic school gave Brown a sense of theatre. "The Bible 
stories were all so theatrical, so melodramatic. It's the same way with the 
Valley. It's essentially suburbia, but it's so close to Hollywood -- with all 
the studios in Burbank -- that the the theatricality has seeped into suburbia 
and made it -- well -- suburbia, but bigger than life. So it has this great 
cheesy side to it." 
</P>
<P>
Always eager to find new material, Brown often drags her friends off in search 
of the lowest rungs of pop culture, whether it's a pit-bull contest in 
Riverside, a swap meet in Pasadena or a Dean Martin lounge show in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to put a lot of stuff into my head," she said. "My writing partner and 
I went to a Connie Francis concert and it was so amazing -- we got the whole 
concept and feel for our next movie. We were laughing so much we had to cover 
our mouths. We kept furiously scribbling all the plot points on our Connie 
Francis programs." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
"Earth Girls' " bumpy progress taught Brown a valuable lesson. "You have to 
separate yourself from your work and learn to value yourself as a person," she 
said over dinner. "I think show business is a great job, but it's not your 
life. You just can't let all the show business stuff take over your life. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned to value my friends and my personal life, because it's important to 
have people you can depend on, that you can be vulnerable with and just be 
normal with." 
</P>
<P>
Her friends value Brown's loyalty in return. "What makes Julie special is that 
she didn't wait around for someone to write her movies or shows -- she did it 
herself," says songwriter pal Allee Willis, who designs the sets for "Just Say 
Julie." "And let me tell you, she definitely looks out for her friends. We do 
similar work, but she's never competitive. In fact, she's tossed a lot of work 
my way." 
</P>
<P>
Brown took her personal-improvement regime one step further. "I kicked all the 
psychos out of my life," she said firmly. "I had a crazy relationship, which I 
got out of. I stopped working with some crazy producers. I cut myself off from 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
She sighed. "The thing about psychos, especially Hollywood psychos, is that 
they can be very fascinating and totally compelling. They are never boring. But 
it gets a little scary when you try to have a real life with them." 
</P>
<P>
Brown rolled her eyes. "I mean, I loved the Sex Pistols, but would you want to 
be in a relationship with Sid Vicious?" 
</P>
<P>
She laughed. "Hey, Madonna. Some free advice. Find a nice accountant!" 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Promoting one of her pop parodies on MTV, Brown sat in for Julie Brown, MTV's 
black veejay of the same name, who was off quietly having a nose job -- at 
least until her namesake announced it on the air. "I came on and said, 'Hi, I'm 
Julie Brown after plastic surgery,' " recalled the comedienne, who is now known 
in MTV circles as Julie (West Coast) Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Impressed by her tart sense of humor, MTV eagerly gave Brown her own show. With 
a kitschy atomic-age set designed by Willis, "Just Say Julie" has become a camp 
classic. Shot on a low-low budget ("the whole thing costs about $1.50" says 
Willis), "Julie" is videoland's first self-referential satire. Asked to show 
current clips during each show, Brown mercilessly lampoons MTV's non-stop array 
of videos adorned with scantily-clad models and dancers. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent show, titled "How To a Model Day," Brown aired a popular Whitesnake 
video which features the band's shaggy-maned lead singer, David Coverdale, and 
sexy footage of model (and Coverdale girlfriend) Tawny Kitaen. Pretending to be 
Kitaen, Brown narrated the clip in a breathless whisper. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever Kitaen popped up in the clip, Brown would squeal "That's me!" When 
Kitaen and Coverdale performed a steamy love scene, she cooed: "Look, I'm 
sticking my tongue in his ear. That's always important to do in a video, 
because then they ask you back to do more videos!" 
</P>
<P>
Brown loves to joke that she was a Homecoming Princess in high school because 
she got both "the cheerleader and the low-rider vote." She's clearly a Valley 
insider -- only a gal who drove her Volkswagon through the hallways of her high 
school science building ("Hey, I got laughs!") could offer such a dead-on 
imitation of this vacuous Valley chatter. 
</P>
<P>
So what does Julie Brown, a lowly earth girl who's become the princess of 
Planet MTV, really want? "I'd love to just have a regular job," she said, 
almost wistfully. "It would be great if this CBS show happened, so I could go 
to work everyday, see the same people and come home at night and have dinner 
and watch TV. 
</P>
<P>
"My life has been so chaotic, that a normal job looks pretty good to me. I know 
it sounds so predictable, but predictability can be very reassuring." 
</P>
<P>
She shrugged. "And hey -- having your own TV show is a pretty fun job. Who's 
going to argue with that?"

<TEXT>
<P>
MAYBE, I'll swim with the whales tomorrow," my husband says. Is he out of his 
mind? I wonder. How will I bring his remains back to his parents? I wonder. 
What am I doing in this dark, far-from-immaculate hotel room in Ciudad 
Constitucion in Baja California? 
</P>
<P>
What I'd hoped would be a romantic Mexican holiday is turning into the 
relationship equivalent of that automotive endurance classic -- the Baja 
Torture Test. Travel broadens the mind, but it also broadens the differences 
between even the most compatible couples. For example, my husband's wayfaring 
fantasy role model leans toward Amundsen mushing his huskies toward the South 
Pole, while mine is more like Cleopatra lounging on her barge floating 
majestically down the Nile. 
</P>
<P>
We are not the only mates with travel conflicts. "I throw running clothes, a 
pair of jeans and a change of underwear into a suitcase, and I'm gone," says my 
friend Don. "Meanwhile, Linda is calling Bekins. She won't go anywhere without 
the whole closet." 
</P>
<P>
My friend Claire won't even pack. "Fred and I don't travel well," she declares. 
"I only like to go places where they speak English so I can be in control. And 
he likes to venture out into The Great Unknown and be lost. There's nothing I 
hate more than that." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Claire should talk to Joseph A. Broger, a Pacific Palisades travel agent, 
who routinely acts as a marriage counselor. "The artistry of my job is to 
ferret out disagreements in the first interview, long before the first 
reservations are made," he explains. "I let both parties have their say, and 
then I try to find a travel feature that satisfies both. It's not as difficult 
as it seems." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, he saved a couple from marital hell in the Himalayas. "She was dead 
set to go on a trek in the high mountains of Nepal," Broger recalls. "And he 
just didn't want that. So I found a situation where there was a short, very 
easy walk of about four days rather than the two-week march. She's happy 
because she gets the exposure she was looking for. And he's happy he doesn't 
have to walk so much." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Broger didn't plan our trip. I had no objections when Duke 
suggested that we go see the California gray whales wintering in Bahia 
Magdalena. But I naively assumed that the whale-watching expedition he had in 
mind was a pleasant day cruise aboard a large, bright and shiny white boat with 
an observation deck, free margaritas and maybe even a snack bar. 
</P>
<P>
I was wrong. "I'm going to find a fisherman," Duke announced, as we drove into 
Puerto San Carlos along a dirt road littered with broken Corona beer bottles 
and overturned rusting car hulks. He stopped by a ripped tent fronted by a 
colossal mound of scallop shells. I watched in horror, anxiously chanting my 
travel mantra, "Be a good sport," as he negotiated with men who didn't look 
like staff members of the Princess Cruises line. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all set," Duke reported happily when he returned to the car. "Ramiro will 
take us out tomorrow morning in his ponga." What's a ponga? "I don't know," 
Duke admitted. "But don't worry. It'll be fun." 
</P>
<P>
One thing you learn when you're traveling with your mate is that your 
definitions of fun may not be the same. My friends Annie and Jeremy recently 
returned from a monthlong vacation in Europe. "It wasn't a 
let's-go-visit-the-museum trip; it was more a cows-in-the-country trip," says 
Jeremy, who planned the journey. "But Annie mostly wanted to buy shoes. We hit 
every shoe store in every city in Europe. She was looking for the perfect pair 
of black flats. She never found them." 
</P>
<P>
"He hated to shop," Annie agrees. "He liked going down streets that went to 
nowhere." But not exactly to nowhere. "The area had to be listed in his bible, 
the Michelin guide." Not surprisingly, Annie and Jeremy are no longer living 
together. "When two people go off on a trip before they get married, it's a 
good bet they'll either get married or it will be the end of the relationship," 
says psychologist Gary Emery, director of the Los Angeles Center for Cognitive 
Therapy. "When you're traveling, there are so many reasons to get negative." 
</P>
<P>
Like what? "In normal day-to-day life, there are not that many decisions to be 
made," Emery says. "But when you're traveling, there are countless decisions: 
where to buy a stamp, where to make a phone call, how to talk to the desk 
clerk. And every decision is a potential conflict." 
</P>
<P>
Don't I know it. Take the other night in San Jose del Cabo. We pulled up to a 
luxurious beach hotel, after a "relaxing" seven-hour drive, during which a 
kamikaze vulture narrowly missed our windshield. My heart swelled with hope as 
the bellhop showed us a sunny spacious room with an ocean view, a deep bathtub 
and no strange stains on the king-size bedspread. "Let's look around some 
more," Duke said. "We can do better." 
</P>
<P>
Better? We wound up in a subterranean closet with a sink in the shower and a 
view of two water heaters. "Give me one good reason that we couldn't stay in 
that beautiful place," I shouted. 
</P>
<P>
"I once stayed there with someone else," Duke confessed. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe he should swim with the whales tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
But the next day, the air is too cold and the sea is too rough for swimming. 
However, it doesn't stop us from boating. I grit my teeth as we climb into what 
looks like a heavily patched bathtub with a motor. There are no life jackets or 
oars in the boat. "Be a good sport," I chant as my husband instructs Ramiro to 
get as close to the whales as he possibly can. 
</P>
<P>
Still, I have to admit that seeing a gray barnacled fluke rising gracefully 
over the waves 10 feet away is a breathtaking experience. "Honey, thanks for 
bringing me here," I say sincerely. "Where are we going next?" 
</P>
<P>
Duke puts his arm around me to stop me from shivering and asks, "Would you mind 
if we checked into a romantic hotel on the beach?"

"Field of Dreams," that Kevin Costner baseball flick set in Iowa farm country, 
is reaping a harvest of hospitality in the Hawkeye State. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Hoffman, an exec with the Excellence Theaters Chain, tells us the movie 
has lured near-sellout crowds since opening exclusively in Iowa at Des Moines' 
Capri Theater April 21. A total of 3,109 tickets were sold during the three-day 
opening weekend at the 522-seat theater. 
</P>
<P>
"The theater was even almost filled to capacity last Sunday," said Hoffman from 
Iowa's capitol and largest city (pop. 191,000). "It's unusual for Des Moines to 
have a theater full on a Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
"Dreams" had a charity premiere April 20 in smaller Dubuque, where much of the 
shooting took place. Cast members Costner, James Earl Jones, Amy Madigan, Ray 
Liotta and Burt Lancaster were unavailable, but exec producer Brian Frankish 
and baseball tech consultants Rod Dedeaux and Don Bufford showed up to a 
cheering crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"The excitement level on this thing is astronomical," said Lindy Strodel of the 
Iowa Film Office. "In Dubuque, especially, people feel it's their own. For 
eight weeks this film crew invaded the community, in a good way, and the 
community has grown very attached to it." Stacy Jenel Smith

"Last Crusade" doesn't come cheap: Exhibitor sources tell us that theater 
owners have already paid Paramount Pictures an estimated $40 million in 
non-refundable guarantees for the right to show the sequel. A head film buyer 
for a West Coast-based chain called the figure "the highest in movie history in 
certain markets, with the possible exception of 'Return of the Jedi' ." 
</P>
<P>
The studio also has negotiated a minimum run of 12 weeks in every theater, the 
source added: "Since Paramount's debuting the film Memorial Day weekend, it 
locks up those screens all summer -- and keeps out the competition." Craig

THE NEW WAVE IN POOL DESIGN GOES BEYOND THE BASICS TO CREATE THE TOTAL AQUATIC

Building a pool today is a lot like buying a car; the options seem endless and 
can add up quickly. 
</P>
<P>
A basic, 18x36-foot pool / spa combination from a high-volume Southern 
California company starts at about $18,000. For $5,000 more, you can add some 
landscaping and perhaps a built-in barbecue. "The cost of building the pool's 
shell isn't going to vary more than 10% to 15%," a local pool designer says. 
"It's the 'flatwork' -- what's above the ground -- that increases the cost." 
</P>
<P>
A custom pool by an independent pool or landscape designer, however, can start 
at about $50,000. Why the price leap? Large companies build hundreds of 
standard pools each year using their own in-house designers and fast-working 
construction crews. Smaller independents -- landscape designers and architects 
-- build fewer pools, usually no more than 12 a year, and offer customized 
extras. 
</P>
<P>
Trendy options are an important consideration for many who are in the market 
for a pool. Today's upscale homeowners are choosing waterscapes -- total 
aquatic environments -- rather than mere pools. A leading look is the "natural" 
lagoon, created with a free-form pool surrounded by real or man-made rocks, 
sometimes with waterfalls, water slides and recirculating streams that meander 
through the rocks before spilling into the pool. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, the height of fashion was the black-bottom pool, touted for its 
energy-saving potential (actually, such savings are minimal) and dramatic, 
reflective quality. But many homeowners now choose lighter shades of gray that 
make the water an inviting deep blue -- less foreboding than the seemingly 
fathomless black-bottom look, especially for serious lap swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
Families with small children often opt for wading areas and "beaches" -- edges 
of the pool that slope gradually for walk-in entry. Probably the year's most 
in-demand options are wet walls and other recirculating-water features that 
create soothing, trickling sounds; surprisingly, these are among the least 
expensive options. Other homeowners want to enhance their pools with bridges, 
steppingstones and sunning and diving decks. One contractor builds spas with 
deep wells measured to the owner's height so that he or she can stand with jets 
aimed at specific areas of the back. 
</P>
<P>
Newly improved remote controls that operate spa jets and heaters, pool lights 
and landscape lighting are also popular options. The same equipment can be 
operated from inside the house via programmed gauges (similar to a thermostat) 
installed on an interior wall. Even pool lighting is entering a new era: Fiber 
optic strips that use no electricity can be installed around the pool's 
perimeter, or even underwater, to accent steps. 
</P>
<P>
Since the early '60s, pool and car prices have remained comparable. Today, you 
can buy a small, basic BMW for about the same price as an average standard pool 
and spa from a large company. Likewise, a custom waterscape by an independent 
designer will set you back about as much as an option-loaded prestige car.

Photo, COLOR, What was once a flat, triangular yard in Beverly Hills is now a 
natural-looking "poolscape" reminiscent of a country spring. After raising the 
ground level at the narrowest end of the yard, Don Goldstone of Beverly 
Hills-based Ultimate Water Creations built a recirculating "stream" that 
meanders down a sloping, man-made-rock waterfall. The cascade eventually spills 
into a free-form, lagoon-style pool. A spa, unobtrusively tucked into the 
lushly landscaped "hillside," increases the amount of water pouring over the 
falls. Plantings are by landscape designer Mark David Levine of Tarzana. ; 
Photo, COLOR, Pasadena homeowners Margaret Morrow and Paul Boland wanted a pool 
that would not dominate the back yard of their circa-1900 bungalow. To 
accomplish this, landscape architect Mark Berry of Aptos-based Mark Berry &amp; 
Associates replaced their large, 40-year-old pool with one of an oval design. 
The effect he created looks somewhat like a back-yard pond. The pool's contours 
are plastered in a soft shade of green that imparts a bluish-green color to the 
water and helps the pool blend with the landscape. R. B. Perry &amp; Associates 
of Pasadena was the pool contractor; Ron Osti of Pasadena was the planting 
contractor. ; Photo, COLOR, The rounded, contemporary architecture of Carol and 
Mike Milligan's hilltop home in Ventura is complemented by an equally sleek, 
ultramodern pool. The semicircular design, created by Santa Barbara-based 
landscape architect John Montgomery, surrounds a perfectly round spa that is 3 
feet above the pool's water level. The spa's booster jets produce a cascading 
sheet of water that heightens the drama of the clean, symmetrical environment. 
Decks and stairs are of a concrete aggregate, and the blue-tile edging and gray 
plaster turn the water a deep blue. ; Photo, COLOR, This free-form pool, at the 
Beverly Hills home of Barbara and Elliott Wax,appears to be built near a sheer 
drop that sends water flowing past boulders down a hillside.Actually, the 
design by Venice-based Galper / Baldon Associates directs the water over an 
almost-invisible edge, which empties into a trough just inches below it. The 
water then recirculates. Man-made steppingstones lead to a "floating" spa, 
surrounded by the pool. The spa is rimmed in Bouquet Canyon stone, man-made 
rock and hardy plants. Pebble-and-stone paving provides traction in the pool's 
shallow wading area. ; Photo, COLOR, Aneoclassical theme best suited this 
Beverly Hills home. The pool is a simple rectangle with entry steps that extend 
across the width of the shallow end. A tile wet-wall is the focal point at the 
deep end. Landscape architect Andrea Gardner of West Los Angeles separated the 
spa from the pool, although the two appear to be connected by a bridge that 
leads to the pergola and sitting area. Coping and raised seat walls are made of 
precast concrete. The multilevel patio is paved with Arizona flagstone squares, 
with black granite accenting each corner. ; Photo, COLOR, This geometric design 
integrates a spectacular view of the beach. Landscape architect Greg Grisamore 
connected the pool to the spa above it with stone steps bordered by real and 
man-made boulders. The black-bottom pool, which seems to end where the ocean 
begins, has a mirror-like surface, and its length is ideal for lap swimmers. It 
was built by California Pools &amp; Spas' South Bay branch. DOUGLAS KENNEDY

A SECOND PREMIERE FOR THE LOST 'COTILLON'; 
</P>
<P>
THE JOFFREY BALLET RECONSTRUCTS GEORGE BALANCHINE'S 1932 BALLETS RUSSES 
BALLROOM MASTERWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Ballets generally live or die according to their place in the repertory. Let 
too many years slip by and suddenly, in spite of the best intentions, a ballet 
has become "lost," the province of history books and photo archives. 
</P>
<P>
That might have been the fate of George Balanchine's "Cotillon," one of the 
most conspicuously lamented "lost" ballets of the 20th Century. But thanks to a 
couple of amateur films, the remembrances of a few performers and two dedicated 
and experienced historians, the work has been reconstructed. It will be given 
its Los Angeles premiere during the Joffrey Ballet's spring season at the Music 
Center beginning May 9. 
</P>
<P>
"Cotillon" was created for the inaugural season of the Ballets Russes de Monte 
Carlo in 1932. Balanchine choreographed its central role on Tamara Toumanova, 
at 13 one of the three soon-to-be famous "baby ballerinas." (The other two, 
Tatiana Riabouchinska and Irina Baronova, also performed leading roles in the 
work in the years following its premiere.) 
</P>
<P>
It became a staple of the Ballets Russes repertory as the company toured 
Europe, North and South America and Australia. Its last known performance was 
in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
The eminent critic Edwin Denby called "Cotillon" the glory of the company's 
repertory and wrote that "this piece profoundly affected the imagination of the 
young people of my generation." 
</P>
<P>
In her book "De Basil's Ballets Russes," Katherine Sorley Walker wrote: " 
'Cotillon' has haunted the memory of everyone who saw it. Many feel that it 
should be revived." 
</P>
<P>
Balanchine himself was clearly not among those "many." "He talked about the 
ballet, but he never talked about bringing it back," recalls Barbara Horgan, 
the late choreographer's longtime assistant and the administrator of the George 
Balanchine Trust. 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Joffrey, whose fervent study of dance history resulted in many 
significant revivals that have helped shape the Joffrey Ballet's profile, felt 
differently and had been trying since the mid-1970s to reconstruct "Cotillon." 
Balanchine met Joffrey's requests with amiable dissuasion (although Horgan 
recalls that Balanchine "was actually rather interested in the research Bob had 
already started"), but Joffrey continued to press the matter with Balanchine's 
heirs, who eventually gave him the go-ahead. Last fall, half a year after 
Joffrey's death, "Cotillon" went on stage for the first time in more than 40 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Dance historian Millicent Hodson and art historian Kenneth Archer, the team 
responsible for the Joffrey Ballet's 1987 reconstruction of Nijinsky's "Le 
Sacre du Printemps," were enlisted by Joffrey to research and reconstruct 
"Cotillon." 
</P>
<P>
Joffrey's preliminary research on the project had included making contact with 
former Ballets Russes dancers whose memories of the ballet could offer crucial 
guidance. In the fall of 1987, Hodson and Archer spent their final evening in 
New York getting a crash course in the ballet's history and the available 
research material from Joffrey, who was already ill at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"He mentioned various books and references, and the names of many former 
dancers. He wanted us to use the same techniques and methodologies we had used 
for 'Sacre,' " Archer recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Bringing "Cotillon" back to life presented a very different challenge from that 
offered by the "Sacre" project. In some ways, the Balanchine work offered a 
luxurious wealth of documentation: two amateur films from the 1930s were 
available. One was a black-and-white Australian one, which Hodson and Archer 
had to track down; the other was in color and is in the Dance Collection of the 
New York Public Library. Both are silent, brief and fragmentary, but both 
provided information from which the reconstructors could work. 
</P>
<P>
"The essential style of the movement is very visible in the films," remarked 
Hodson. But while they provided a valuable starting point, the films also left 
many gaps and discrepancies and required close critical scrutiny. The color 
film offered important information on the palette of the Christian Berard 
costumes and scenery, but Archer notes that it had faded considerably and was 
therefore not a completely reliable reference point. 
</P>
<P>
In one filmed segment of the female ensemble, Hodson noticed that "if you 
looked at the girls during the opening movement, they were all doing it 
differently. You have 12 variations on one fact." Balanchine's ties with the 
Ballets Russes were abruptly 
</P>
<P>
severed after that first season (he moved on to his next venture, Les Ballets 
1933), and Hodson surmises that without his eye to keep the ballet in top 
shape, things had gotten a bit sloppy. 
</P>
<P>
In teaching the work to the Joffrey dancers, Hodson had to select a convincing 
way to perform this particular movement -- one of many such interpretive 
decisions she and Archer made. 
</P>
<P>
They were aided in these decisions by a group of former Ballets Russes 
luminaries, whom they sought out and consulted in New York, Los Angeles, Paris 
and Buenos Aires. These included, in addition to the three "baby ballerinas," 
Alexandra Danilova, Sono Osato and Tamara Grigorieva and Roman Jasinski; Boris 
Kochno, who created the scenario for "Cotillon"; and Antal Dorati, who 
conducted many performances of the ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Having access to so many survivors with first-hand performing experience (after 
working on "Sacre," from which no dancers survive) was a welcome luxury that 
also led, in some cases, to contradictory information. "We met with three 
generations of dancers who performed the ballet over a decade and a half, and 
the ballet had changed during that period," explained Archer. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Cotillon' involved a very different kind of guesswork from 'Sacre,' " Hodson 
noted. In some cases, she filled in missing material by working with the 
particular dancer involved; when there was a choreographic gap for two bars of 
music, she asked Tina LeBlanc, who dances the Toumanova role, what felt right 
with the music and in keeping with the surrounding steps. 
</P>
<P>
The ballet's haunting, mysterious "Hand of Fate" pas de deux called for quite a 
few interpretive decisions. Beatriz Rodriguez, who performs it (with Glenn 
Edgerton), remembers that each of the veteran dancers who came in to offer help 
with that section presented a slightly different version. After collating all 
the available information, she and Hodson tried to synthesize them according to 
"what looks right and creates the right illusion. We're still working on some 
of those ideas, to create more of that atmosphere," Rodriguez explains. 
</P>
<P>
Atmosphere is a key element of "Cotillon"; its quasi-narrative depiction of a 
young girl's coming-out ball was cherished primarily for its undertones of 
decadence and ominousness within a surface of youthful frolic. 
</P>
<P>
The ballet represents an intriguing period in Balanchine's career, one that 
found him between his stint as Diaghilev's house choreographer -- which 
culminated triumphantly with "Apollo" (1928) and "Prodigal Son" (1929) -- and 
his arrival in America, where he created the repertory by which he is known and 
measured today. Some have speculated that "Cotillon" was so much of its 
particular time and place -- Europe in the final moments of the 1920s' heady 
glory, on the eve of political turmoil and war -- and so bound up with the baby 
ballerinas that it had outlived its persuasiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Hodson, while recognizing that "Cotillon" is very much the work of a European 
Balanchine who predates the master of speed and angularity he was later to 
become, sees the seeds of several subsequent Balanchine works in "Cotillon." 
The section for the women in the cast, subtitled "The Magic Lantern," is the 
model for "Serenade" (1934), in her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
When Darci Kistler, the current New York City Ballet principal who was 
something of a "baby ballerina" herself in the early 1980s, saw the Joffrey 
production of "Cotillon" last fall, she found elements she could recognize even 
though she felt the ballet was clearly from a different era. 
</P>
<P>
"I could see similarities with several other ballets. Some of the steps and the 
eeriness of it reminded me of 'La Sonnambula (1946).' It's very witty and 
glamorous; I found it was like looking in at a beautiful world you'd like to 
get into." 
</P>
<P>
Kistler was wary of comparing the ballet's technical demands with today's ideas 
of Balanchine technique because "those ballets evolved and changed under his 
guidance and tutelage. I didn't look at it to compare it with a Balanchine 
ballet of today that . . . people have looked at every night year after year. 
It is something that will grow with the company."

MUSIC NEWS: SEARCH FEVER: LOOKING FOR A CONDUCTOR

one expected, one surprising -- of conductors Herbert von Karajan and Andre 
Previn from their respective orchestras just a few days ago, plus the recent 
appointments of new music directors to four prominent symphonic posts in 
California, this has been a month of flux in the world of orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
And the flux goes on. 
</P>
<P>
In San Bernardino, the Inland Empire Symphony announced Friday that its new 
music director will be Stewart Robertson, the Scottish conductor who now leads 
the Santa Fe (N.M.) Symphony. He beat out an impressive list of competitors, 
including the Los Angeles Philharmonic's assistant conductor, David Alan 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
At the Santa Monica Symphony, which bids goodby to music director Yehuda Gilad 
on May 14, the search has just begun. According to spokespersons for the 
orchestra, that search may take up to two years. 
</P>
<P>
And in Orange County, the Pacific Symphony, second-largest symphonic operation 
in Southern California -- and said to be the largest regional orchestra in the 
nation, with an annual budget of more than $4.7 million and a playing schedule 
of 52 performances this season -- continues its search for a new music director 
to succeed outgoing orchestra founder Keith Clark. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a phenomenally exciting time for us," says Louis J. Spisto, executive 
director of the 10-year old symphonic body. 
</P>
<P>
So far, four candidates for the post have led the orchestra. Next season, 
another five will assume the podium. Will the next music director be one of 
these nine? 
</P>
<P>
"For sure," replies Spisto, unhesitatingly. 
</P>
<P>
"And now, our audiences have got the fever of the search. Somehow, it happened 
at the time Vakhtang Jordania appeared with the orchestra (two months ago). 
</P>
<P>
"We got a lot of letters after that, not necessarily for his candidacy, but 
because the audience suddenly realized this search was going on. A lot of them 
liked him, of course, but mostly they got involved." 
</P>
<P>
Something similar happened in Long Beach, where the L.B. Symphony two weeks ago 
announced the appointment of JoAnn Falletta as music director. 
</P>
<P>
According to Margie Masterson, who headed the search committee, the interest in 
competition for the post was "amazing. People attended the pre-concert lectures 
in larger numbers than ever before, they couldn't stop talking about the 
candidates, and they never missed a concert." 
</P>
<P>
Presumably, some of that excitement will die down after Falletta takes the 
reins, in September, as it will also in San Diego -- where Yoav Talmi was named 
new music director last week, and at the Glendale Symphony, which appointed 
Lalo Schifrin its leader two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at the philharmonics of Los Angeles, Berlin and New York City, the 
searches are just beginning . . . . 
</P>
<P>
MORE FESTIVALS: Music of West Coast composers is the main thrust of the 27th 
Cabrillo Music Festival, this year holding forth July 20-30 in locations in and 
around Santa Cruz County. Dennis Russell Davies remains music director; among 
other conductors at the 1989 festival will be William McGlaughlin, Neil Varon 
and Henry Brant. Featured composers will be Lou Harrison, Chinary Ung, David 
Cope, Gordon Mumma, Olly Wilson, Mel Powell, Robert Erickson and John Geist. 
For a brochure, write Cabrillo Festival, 6500 Soquel Dr., Aptos, CA 95003. . . 
. The 17th Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival, July 9 to Aug. 21, offers music 
from Adams fo Zwilich. Among the musicians are pianists Lee Luvisi, Christian 
Zacharias and Alicia Schachter; violinists Nina Bodnar, Federico Agostini and 
Christian Altenburger; singers Judith Nelson and Katherine Ciesinski, and 
cellists Laurence Lesser, Gary Hoffman and Carter Brey. For a brochure, write 
P.O. Box 853, Santa Fe, N.M. 87501-0853. . . . And, as announced earlier, the 
Ojai Festival in 1989 takes place June 2-4, and will be led by Pierre Boulez. 
Among other promised performances are Stravinsky's "Les Noces," in which the 
four pianists will be Ursula Oppens, Alan Feinberg, Leonard Stein and Bryan 
Pezzone, and a Boulez program expanded now to include "Livre pour Cordes," 
"Eclat" and "Improvisations sur Mallarme". The festival management has 
announced that composer Gyorgy Ligeti will not be able to attend the festival; 
he still will be represented by five of his major works, including the West 
Coast premiere of his orchestral piece, "Apparitions." 
</P>
<P>
ENDING WITH A SMILE: Announced last week, the demise of the Glendale Chamber 
Orchestra, after seven years of service to its community, came as a surprise to 
some. But not to Christopher Fazzi, the conductor and composer who founded the 
ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
"We ended our latest season by breaking even financially on a budget of over 
$75,000," Fazzi told The Times after the announcement. "We were within $100 of 
that point," but with no surplus for next season. And small prospects. 
</P>
<P>
"We had applied, as usual, for grants from city, county, state and federal 
sources," Fazzi said. "And, this year, they all turned us down. 
</P>
<P>
"So I had the choice of spending all summer long trying to raise about $100,000 
for next season, or throwing in the towel." 
</P>
<P>
With several commissions waiting on his desk, and other ventures pending -- 
Fazzi is a film and television composer as well as a writer in classical forms 
-- the conductor decided to go back to the creative side. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not bitter," he said. "We've accomplished a lot, and have brought music to 
a lot of people -- including 3,000 students we gave free tickets to in those 
seven years. What we've done has been positive. We just decided it was better 
to quit now, before we have a deficit." 
</P>
<P>
ANOTHER INSTITUTE: For the second summer, cellist Lynn Harrell will again serve 
as artistic director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute, one of the more 
visible educational arms of the orchestra. On the faculty for 1989 will be 
conductors Yuri Temirkanov, David Zinman, Swiss musician Mario Venzago Neeme 
Jarvi, Polish composer Witold Lutoslawski (who will conduct a program of his 
own music at UCLA) and the Emerson Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
Ernest Fleischmann, managing director of the Philharmonic and founder of the 
institute, told The Times that chamber ensembles made up of institute orchestra 
players will again give public concerts at a number of venues around the city. 
And, besides its three scheduled Hollywood Bowl appearances (July 16 and 30, 
and Aug. 13), the 100-member LAPO Institute Orchestra will perform four 
concerts in Royce Hall at UCLA.

ON THE RECORD: NEW LIFE FOR OLD MASTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A welcome side effect of the escalating expense of producing new CD product is 
the raiding of the pre-digital (even pre-stereo and pre-LP) archives -- 
unthinkable in 1983, when the digital compact disc was the new technological 
Wunderkind on the block. Then, industry-wide wisdom dictated that the new 
system would succeed only if represented by the sonic state of the art. 
</P>
<P>
Such reasoning was responsible for new-tech remakes of much of the piano trio 
repertory by its most famous purveyors, the Beaux Arts Trio, who by the '80s 
were well past their prime. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome, then, an intrepid little French firm, Ades (distributed by Harmonia 
Mundi), to remind us how the Beaux Arts achieved its stature, the evidence 
being 1962 recordings (originally for Philips) of Dvorak's "Dumky" and 
Mendelssohn's D-minor Trios, in superbly clear, full-bodied pre-digital stereo 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
Here (on CD 13.273) is playing as fierily, fearlessly emotional as the works 
themselves from the original Beaux Arts personnel: the group's perennial, 
evergreen pianist, Menahem Pressler, violinist Daniel Guilet, cellist Bernard 
Greenhouse. 
</P>
<P>
This was a powerhouse combination, less refined in tone and technique but far 
more incisive than their later incarnations, when the elegantly aloof Isidore 
Cohen became violinist and Greenhouse just seemed to lose interest. 
</P>
<P>
One imagines the Beaux Arts Trio growing up with the legendary 1920s recordings 
of Beethoven's "Archduke" and Schubert's B-flat Trios by pianist Alfred Cortot, 
violinist Jacques Thibaud and cellist Pablo Casals: three superstars, each more 
or less going his own way in matters of phrasing and articulation, but finding 
common ground often enough to keep the music together. 
</P>
<P>
But these gentlemen did more than make pretty sounds while maintaining a 
semblance of structural integrity. Each was in his physical prime at the time 
of these recordings and each clearly felt deeply about the music. 
</P>
<P>
The string playing is luscious, Cortot's piano a marvel of subtle fluency, and 
the interpretations, whether or not quite of a piece, are grandly 
communicative. The reissue, quite decent-sounding in view of the age of the 
originals, is in EMI/Angel's mid-priced "Great Recordings of the Century" 
series (61024). 
</P>
<P>
Violinist Daniel Phillips, pianist Richard Goode and hornist William Purvis, 
though decidedly in our midst, are not living legends. They are simply three of 
the kingpins of chamber music in America and they combine their gifts for a 
superbly well-knit reading of Brahms' Horn Trio, Opus 40 (Bridge 9012) -- no 
less mechanically secure and a good deal less sentimental than the celebrated 
Perlman-Ashkenazy-Tuckwell edition. 
</P>
<P>
The Brahms is imaginatively coupled with Gyorgy Ligeti's 1982 "Hommage a 
Brahms" -- specifically an homage to Opus 40, which it resembles by way of a 
common reference point in Beethoven's "Les Adieux" sonata and frequent 
employment of natural horn harmonics. 
</P>
<P>
But Ligeti's Trio would not be confused with a work of the Romantic era, least 
of all in the final movement, music of the most profound pessimism, delivered 
in an intensely dissonant, harshly emotive language. 
</P>
<P>
The Ligeti performers, in addition to the seemingly superhuman Purvis, are 
contemporary music masters Rolf Schulte, violin, and pianist Alan Feinberg. 
</P>
<P>
Notable among a mass of new string quartet CDs -- even the big labels have come 
to realize that it costs less to record the most expensive string quartet than 
the least expensive symphony orchestra -- are outstanding releases by two 
youthful American ensembles. 
</P>
<P>
In a stimulating, offbeat release, the Muir Quartet impersonates the 
"orchestra" in Mozart's own chamber arrangements of two great early Viennese 
piano concertos, in A, K. 414, and in C, K. 415, as well as the earlier 
Concerto in B-flat, K. 238 (EMI/Angel 49156). 
</P>
<P>
The pianist, hitherto not identified with Mozart, is Jean-Philippe Collard, who 
emerges a nimble, sensitive interpreter, in perfect accord with the Muir's 
suavely punctilious but by no means precious ensemble execution. 
</P>
<P>
Mozart again, this time from the even younger Colorado Quartet: the familiar 
"Dissonance" Quartet and the less-known and perhaps most unique of the six 
quartets dedicated to Haydn, the work in A, K. 464 (Fidelio 8813). 
</P>
<P>
The Colorado's Mozart is sharp-edged and rhythmically crisp, their ensemble 
buoyantly light-toned. Their overall excellence in this coupling is highlighted 
by splendidly lithe projection of the infinite, elusive wonders of the slow 
movement of K. 464.

SINGING FOR ADULTS LONELY

<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONNIE RAITT "Nick of Time." Capitol. *** 
</P>
<P>
The adult world Bonnie Raitt sings about is lightyears away from the 
black-and-white pains and pleasures of teen rock. It's where people run out of 
time, out of patience, out of love and out of luck, but never out of hope and 
compassion. In an album that's as eclectic emotionally as musically, Raitt 
moves gracefully from the silky R&amp;B of the poignant title tune to the wise 
and sassy rock of John Hiatt's "Thing Called Love" to the heartbreakingly 
elegant balladry of "I Ain't Gonna Let You Break My Heart Again" to the 
Fabulous Thunderbirds-backed roadhouse blues of "The Road's My Middle Name." 
The LP could have done with a sharper focus, and without a couple of the songs. 
Even so, there's nary a trace of calculation or false emotion. RANDY LEWIS

STANDING UP TO JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the surface, "Standing Up to Japan" seemed a witty, cute picture of 
California life in the suburbs. Unfortunately, Fallows missed two important 
points in the 1980s relationship between Japanese and American cultures. 
</P>
<P>
First, what America is copying from Japan is not its discipline, rigidity and 
diligence, but quite the contrary -- a new, open, collegial, flexible, creative 
approach to problem-solving and technological innovation. 
</P>
<P>
The second point reveals that Fallows' Chevy got stalled in the 1950s and was 
never recharged: American education has done far more than stratify society by 
its SAT scores. Rather than separate "professionals" (doctors, lawyers) from 
all the other less prestigious and lucrative workers, American higher education 
has historically been the springboard for thousands of people into new, 
never-thought-of-before careers -- careers that facilitate and support a 
constantly changing technological society. Has Fallows wandered around a 
college campus lately?

STANDING UP TO JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Interestingly, in "Standing Up to Japan" (March 12), James Fallows does not 
dwell on Japan but rather devotes most of his essay to attacking the American 
realization of a meritocracy. Furthermore, he argues that unless the trend 
toward stratification is reversed, it will be one cause of our society's 
economic decline. He laments the evidence of his thesis in the observance that 
"the best and the brightest" are flocking to the law and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, it is unfortunate that the sciences, teaching and manufacture have 
taken a back seat to the more glamorous professions, but this is not a result 
of a highly efficient meritocracy. Rather, it is partly a result of a 
meritocracy that doesn't function well enough. An incompetent doctor or lawyer 
can still buy a house in Beverly Hills, while a brilliant scientist or teacher 
struggles to provide. The economic problem that Fallows has identified is more 
the result of taxing and financing policies that have encouraged the large 
concentration of wealth within the corporate structure. This large 
concentration of wealth can be expensed to medical insurance, legal fees, 
consultant fees and investment banking fees, before taxes, while the services 
procured through these expenses can help ensure management survival in the 
short run. The inevitable result of these strategies has been the incredible 
growth in incomes for parasitic professions. This is a gross distortion of 
meritocracy.

STANDING UP TO JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
True, we could learn things from the Japanese about being less spendthrift, 
less self-indulgent, more careful about quality. Still, there's much in the 
American world view that bodes well in the long run. Our tolerance, our passion 
for newness and diversity, our willingness to take criticism and readiness for 
self-renewal: These will serve us at least as well as homogeneity and 
discipline serve the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1950s, we almost responded to the threat of communism by adopting 
our enemy's methods -- creating a closed, paranoid society. Instead, we chose 
to keep faith with our nature. Today we see a Soviet Union that is, in effect, 
surrendering to our way of looking at things. 
</P>
<P>
No. The solution isn't to learn how to make better VCRs or TVs than Tokyo. The 
answer is to let them make those things if they're good at it. Let's go do 
things we are intrinsically better at.

POP EYE: STARS HAVE THAT BOXED-IN SENSATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL GREIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Better find some space on your record shelves. Lots of space. 
</P>
<P>
Elton John, Barbra Streisand, the Who, Steve Winwood, Jeff Beck and Bob Marley 
are among the pop stars whose careers will soon be saluted in multi-disc boxed 
sets. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, multi-record career retrospectives are in the works for the Allman 
Brothers, the Bee Gees, Van Morrison, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, the Byrds, the 
Moody Blues, Rush, Kiss, Muddy Waters, Bo Diddley and Howlin' Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
The boxed-set boom owes a lot to the success in recent years of boxes by Bob 
Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and Eric Clapton, all of which have gone gold (sales 
of more than 250,000). 
</P>
<P>
One of the main reasons for the surge is the arrival of the compact disc. Now 
fans with CD players have added incentive to acquire definitive collections by 
their favorite artists in the new format. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg Geller, who compiled Elvis Presley's six-record "Elvis -- A Golden 
Celebration" set in 1984, pointed to another factor: the maturation of rock 'n' 
roll. 
</P>
<P>
"There is sufficient history to our current pop music at this point that there 
are a good many artists that lend themselves to this treatment," said Geller, 
who is assembling a five-CD/cassette retrospective of CBS Records' greatest 
country hits and a box saluting guitarist Jeff Beck. 
</P>
<P>
"Jazz artists have always done it," said Andy McKaie, an MCA Records executive 
who compiled widely admired boxes by Chuck Berry and Willie Dixon. "Now that 
rock and pop have been entrenched as long as they have been, why shouldn't they 
enjoy the same type of respectful overview?" 
</P>
<P>
McKaie, who is planning a seven-record/five-CD Elton John box and a 
six-record/three-CD Muddy Waters retrospective, said that boxes have an 
inherent fan appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people don't want to buy everything by an artist, but they want more than 
a greatest-hits album," he said. "They use the box as the centerpiece of their 
collection." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Levenson, PolyGram Records' director of catalogue development, said he 
isn't concerned that a glut of boxed sets might exhaust the market. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you can do the giants of the business and it doesn't matter if you 
have 10 or 50 of them out," he said. "Each has its own audience. I just hope 
that they continue to be done for the right reasons and not just to capitalize 
on what seems to be a trend." 
</P>
<P>
Levenson, who won a Grammy for compiling Clapton's "Crossroads" box and has 
assembled a similar box for the Allman Brothers, added: "I'm sure boxes are 
going to come out that will be shoddily packaged, but they'll all find their 
own level. The good ones will surface and the bad ones will just be sold 
casually and then go away." 
</P>
<P>
The Allman box, "Dreams," will be issued in June, but most of the others will 
be released to coincide with the lucrative Christmas sales season. The Bee 
Gees, Marley and Muddy Waters boxes and the CBS country collection are set for 
this Christmas, but a final decision hasn't been made on several of the 
superstar boxes -- including Streisand and Elton John. Some of those probably 
won't come out until Christmas 1990, when compilations by Winwood, Beck and the 
Who are also slated. 
</P>
<P>
NEWS NOTES: The Madonna/Pepsi-Cola union isn't pop's only corporate sponsorship 
deal to hit the rocks. Belinda Carlisle has filed a cross complaint in Superior 
Court against L.A. Gear, a top fashion athletic footware and apparel company, 
charging it with -- among other things -- "deceptively altering a photograph of 
Carlisle." The filing claims that the Mar Vista-based company airbrushed a 
picture of an L.A. Gear watch onto her wrist for a print ad. The complaint asks 
for damages of $6.7 million. A spokeswoman for L.A. Gear declined comment, 
saying that executives there hadn't seen the complaint. . . . The Grateful Dead 
and Tracy Chapman are part of an benefit concert for AIDS research, set for May 
27 at Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum. Also on the bill: Robin Williams, Los 
Lobos, Huey Lewis &amp; the News and the retooled Jefferson Airplane. . . . 
Stevie Nicks' fourth album, "The Other Side of the Mirror," is due May 23. 
Nicks duets with Bruce Hornsby on one cut, "Two Kinds of Love." Rupert Hine 
(Tina Turner, Howard Jones) produced the album, which also features guest work 
by Kenny G, and Mike Campbell of the Heartbreakers. Nicks is slated to tour 
this summer. . . . Paula Abdul, the second choreographer to land a No. 1 pop 
hit (following Toni Basil), is set to choreograph the film version of "Evita," 
which stars Meryl Streep. (Robert Stigwood is producing and Oliver Stone is 
directing.). . . . E.U. is contributing music to Spike Lee's next film, "Do the 
Right Thing," due this summer. The group was featured in Lee's comedy "School 
Daze," singing their Grammy-nominated hit "Da Butt." Lee also directed their 
subsequent "Buck Wild" video. 
</P>
<P>
PLAY BALL: Two great American pastimes -- baseball and rock 'n' roll -- will 
come together May 20 at the annual T.J. Martell Rock 'n' Charity softball games 
at USC's Dedeaux Field. The highlight of the four games will be one that pits 
the Rockers (captained by Vince Neil of Motley Crue) against the Rollers 
(captained by comedian Sam Kinison). The teams will be drawn from members of 
Whitesnake, Van Halen, Dire Straits, REO Speedwagon, Jethro Tull and the L.A. 
Kings hockey team. Other games will feature deejays from local radio stations 
KLSX, KLOS, KNAC and KEDG and the cast of "Married . . . With Children." 
Tickets are $7 for the four games and are available at most outlets. The New 
York-based Martell Foundation is a music industry charity that benefits cancer, 
leukemia and AIDS research. 
</P>
<P>
AND FINALLY: Many weekly TV series are spicing their sound tracks with pop 
hits, but few are as adventurous in their selections as Fox Broadcasting's "21 
Jump Street." Tonight's episode of the teen hit -- which airs locally at 7 p.m. 
on KTTV -- features three songs by local faves X: "Hungry Wolf," "Blue Spark" 
and "Come Back to Me." And it's not a one-shot stunt. The May 14 installment 
will feature three songs by rapper Tone Loc. Other episodes this season have 
featured songs by the Stones, Concrete Blonde, Robert Cray, R.E.M. and Steve 
Winwood. . . . Aretha Franklin and Elton John are slated to film a video this 
week for their fast-rising Top 40 duet, "Through the Storm." But the big 
question is whether the Queen of Soul and the Godfather of Soul, James Brown, 
will be able to film a video of their duet, "Gimme Your Love." Working out the 
logistics won't be easy because Brown is still in prison in South Carolina and 
the Detroit-based Franklin refuses to fly or take the train. The only solution 
may be a weekend pass for Brown. Let's hope Southern wardens have soul.

NOTEBOOK: FENNEL OWNERS CONSIDERING A BRASSERIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There have been rumors recently that Fennel, the popular new Santa Monica 
French restaurant at which a quartet of top chef-restaurateurs from France 
share cooking chores on an alternating basis, plans to clone itself. 
</P>
<P>
That's not quite true, says Fennel proprietor Mauro Vincente (who also runs 
Pazzia on La Cienega and Rex Il Ristorante downtown). But he admits that he and 
his French associates are investigating the possibility of spinning off from 
Fennel "a kind of brasseria" -- an Italian-French brasserie. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea," he says, "would be to have a casual, less expensive place, with 
Italian chefs doing pizza and pastas and French chefs, the same ones involved 
with Fennel, doing meat and fish. We are considering several possible locations 
in Santa Monica -- but the project is probably a year or two off." 
</P>
<P>
EXPENSE ACCOUNTING: About this time four years ago, the Reagan Administration, 
as a part of its massive tax reform program, proposed to limit business meal 
deductions to $15 per person for lunch and $25 per person for dinner, plus 50% 
of the amount over that figure. The American restaurant industry was vehemently 
opposed to the measure, predicting that it would force scores if not hundreds 
of upscale eating places out of business. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, I asked half a dozen prominent L.A.-area restaurateurs with 
substantial expense-account clienteles -- Patrick Terrail of the since-closed 
original Ma Maison, Tony Bill of 72 Market Street, Jimmy Murphy of Jimmy's, 
Wolfgang Puck of Spago and Chinois on Main, Piero Selvaggio of Valentino and 
Michael McCarty of Michael's -- how they thought the measure would affect them. 
</P>
<P>
As it happens, the $15/$25 formula did not become law, but a measure limiting 
business meal deductions to 80% of the amount actually spent did, as of 1987. 
In honor of the tax season we just squeaked out of, I asked those same six 
operators how the limitation had in fact affected them. Here are excerpts from 
their comments four years ago, together with their replies today: 
</P>
<P>
Piero Selvaggio, Valentino: (THEN) I personally don't think the tax proposal 
will pass . . . but if it does, we'll get used to it. It won't have any real 
effect in the long run. (NOW) I may have been wrong about the measure passing, 
but I was right about it not having any real effect. Maybe there's a little 
more awareness of cost, a feeling of being a little bit careful about spending 
on a certain bottle of wine, but people who want to entertain still entertain 
-- and if they can get away with charging it to business somehow, they will. 
</P>
<P>
Michael McCarty, Michael's: (THEN) "Expletive deleted! Expletive deleted! I 
think the whole idea is terrible . . . It's going to hurt a whole lot of 
restaurants . . . I don't want to sound like a crybaby, but if the proposal 
passes, I'd have to seriously consider whether we could continue to do business 
as we do now. (NOW) I can't imagine anybody in the restaurant business telling 
you with a straight face that business is great today -- but whether it's the 
business-meal deductions or the Wall Street crash or new health habits or just 
the fact that a lot of our old customers are having children and staying home 
more, I don't know. I'm sure the deduction limits have had an effect, but it's 
not as drastic as I had feared. But if you ask me, food and wine should always 
be deducted, just like the mortgage! It ought to be an American right! 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Murphy, Jimmy's: (THEN) I hope it won't go through . . . (A) lot of jobs 
are created through business meals in restaurants like ours. (But) I'm sure 
people will find ways around it if it does pass. (NOW) I don't think the 
limitation has affected us. Our business has been steady. It doesn't seem to 
have had a noticeable effect. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Bill, 72 Market Street: (THEN) The (proposed) limits seem in line with the 
average checks at my restaurant. (But the measure would) put a severe cramp in 
my style when I go to other restaurants. (NOW) I haven't noticed any effects at 
all. Life goes on, without missing much of a beat. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Terrail (formerly Ma Maison, now food and beverage manager for the 
recently opened Ma Maison Sofitel Hotel and director of a new version of Ma 
Maison immediately adjacent to it): (THEN) I don't feel either way about the 
proposal, really, (though) some other, more expensive restaurants . . . are 
going to get hurt. (NOW) (My restaurant is) too new at this point to be able to 
have any standards of comparison over the past few years. But I'll tell you 
something interesting: If you called half a dozen of my customers at random and 
asked them what the deduction limits were, I'll bet most of them wouldn't even 
know. I'll bet most of them have forgotten all about it. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Puck, Spago; Chinois on Main: (THEN) At the beginning, I think people 
will complain a lot, but they'll adapt . . . They'll still go out. (NOW) I 
haven't noticed any effects of the limitation at all. We had the best year 
we've ever had in 1988. I think these limits are something people just learn to 
live with. You know, gas prices keep going up, and still you drive. No matter 
how expensive gas is, people don't want to car-pool. 
</P>
<P>
A SNOOTFUL OF BLUE: Forget cigarette smoke, overzealously applied perfume, and 
the odor of burnt food. There's a new old factory menace showing up in 
restaurants today -- glass cleaner. I mean that usually-blue, 
usually-ammoniated liquid that always seems to get squirted onto the 
glass-topped table next to you just about the time your swordfish arrives. The 
odor of the stuff is all-pervasive. A haze of it can sting your eyes, burn your 
throat, and leave a nasty metallic taste in your mouth. 
</P>
<P>
By definition, it doesn't show up at restaurants with tablecloths, but it can 
appear unexpectedly in some very pricey places -- as it did to me recently, for 
instance, in the middle of an otherwise superb dinner at the ultra-posh Rex Il 
Ristorante downtown, where the substance was applied not to a glass-topped 
table but to one of shiny black marble. Maybe restaurateurs don't realize just 
how unpleasant a snootful of glass cleaner can be. Well, I'm hereby telling 
them. Cut it out, you guys. Clean the glass later -- or try warm water and mild 
soap on a soft rag, or maybe a weak vinegar solution. OK? Thank you. 
</P>

THE BLACK EXPERIENCE IN HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Goldstein's April 17 article, "The Hollywood Shuffle," Spike Lee is quoted 
thusly: "Lots of people -- even black people -- thank Cleopatra was a white 
woman just 'cause Elizabeth Taylor played her in the movie." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, lots of people think Cleopatra was white 'cause she was! 
</P>
<P>
The last of the Ptolemy rulers of Egypt, Cleopatra was descended from the Greek 
general of the same name, one of the men who helped Alexander the Great conquer 
the known world. 
</P>
<P>
When Alexander died, his generals divided up his territories and Ptolemy chose 
Egypt. He and all his descendants (including Cleopatra) married Greeks -- quite 
often their sisters or aunts or, in Cleo's case, brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, in spite of ruling Egypt for centuries, the Ptolemys remained almost pure 
Greek -- with just a touch of Iranian (Aryan) blood and no African blood at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
In the film to which Mr. Lee refers, Marc Antony (Richard Burton) responds to a 
question from Cleopatra (Elizabeth Taylor) as to what he prefers in life by 
saying " . . . and most things Greek." To which Cleo replies that they should 
get along together well since she was a "mostly Greek thing."

ANOTHER FILM CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with interest your April 9 article "Orlando, Fla. -- Will It Become 
Hollywood East?" You dedicated a number of pages to the limited business being 
generated by the Disney/MGM and Universal Studios in Orlando and ignored the 
hub of the film industry in Florida. South Florida in general and North Miami 
in particular have been and continue to be the center of film production in 
this state. In fact, in 1988 in terms of dollars spent just by feature films 
alone, we surpassed the Orlando area about 10 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
We may not have the (Orlando-style) glitz that comes with E.T. or Mickey Mouse 
ears, but we have talent, production facilities, technical know-how and 
postproduction facilities that can't be found anywhere else outside of Los 
Angeles or New York.

AN "A" FOR THE CRITIC

<TEXT>
<P>
Poor Jayne Simon (Letters, April 16). She gives critic Dan Sullivan an "F" for 
his comment that Los Angeles actors need "a Brit . . . who will teach them how 
to speak Shakespeare in American." Then she asks how could splendid 
performances already given in this area be "improved by an English accent?" 
</P>
<P>
Ask any responsible high school drama teacher preparing for the annual 
Shakespeare Festival here about working to rid students of phony, stagey 
British accents and of fighting to get them to love the words and really say 
the words. The Bard was a poet! 
</P>
<P>
Too bad Ms. Simon doesn't understand that Dan Sullivan knows that and was not 
talking about laying on accents.

THE BLACK EXPERIENCE IN HOLLYWOOD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Goldstein's articles indicated that there is a shortage of black writers. 
Actually, there isn't a shortage of black writers, merely a shortage of 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Without proper representation there is no way for a writer, black or white, to 
gain access to the Hollywood community. 
</P>
<P>
The real dilemma starts with literary agents. Most of the major literary 
agencies won't represent black writers. They feel that our product isn't 
commercial enough, that since we are a minority we write about the minority 
experience and the agencies don't envision this as marketable (unless it's a 
comedy). Thus we have films such as "Mississippi Burning" and "Cry Freedom," 
told through the eyes of whites.

Re Patrick Goldstein's series on blacks in the movie industry: 
</P>
<P>
Blacks for years complained about how a racist Hollywood wouldn't make films 
for us, so we went out and made our own films. Then we turned back around to 
negotiate with the same racist Hollywood to show these films to the black 
community. That was a bad move on our part. 
</P>
<P>
Developing an independent industry, lock, stock and barrel, is our challenge, 
and we may not necessarily choose to be affiliated with certain factions of 
Hollywood in the process. 
</P>
<P>
You have to remember, Hollywood built this system on the backs of black, brown, 
yellow and red people. We are aware that whites would not like to see this 
privilege disappear in Hollywood.

BUSH CLEARS WAY FOR FSX FIGHTER DEAL WITH JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush announced agreement Friday to proceed with a hotly debated deal 
with Japan to produce the FSX advanced fighter jet after he received assurances 
that U.S. jobs and technology would be protected. 
</P>
<P>
After months of negotiations on a deal that at one point seemed in danger of 
being scrapped, Bush said the two nations finally "reached understandings that 
will allow us to proceed with joint development of the FSX fighter aircraft." 
</P>
<P>
During a brief appearance in the White House press room, the President also 
said the proposed arrangement would bolster the security of Japan and the 
United States without compromising U.S. technology. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Strategic Considerations' 
</P>
<P>
"We weighed this matter from the standpoint of trade, of our industrial growth 
and technology transfer, as well as strategic and foreign policy 
considerations," Bush told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Congress has 30 days to review the agreement, signed Friday by Secretary of 
State James A. Baker III and Japan's Ambassador Nobuo Matsunaga. The House and 
Senate can reject it by a joint resolution of disapproval. 
</P>
<P>
The plane, to be jointly produced by General Dynamics Corp. and Japan's 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, is an advanced version of the U.S.-built F-16. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to controls to safeguard sensitive computer technology, the 
Japanese government agreed to ensure that the United States have a 40% share of 
the FSX's estimated $1.2 billion early development work. The full run is 
estimated to cost 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that the United States would produce "a similar share" in the later 
production stages. Japan plans to build 130 of the planes for deployment in the 
late 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be no cost to the American taxpayer and at the same time the 
Japanese will improve their ability to carry their share of the defense burden. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Strictly Controlled' 
</P>
<P>
"I want to assure you that sensitive source codes for the aircraft's computer 
will be strictly controlled," Bush said, addressing a major concern of many on 
Capitol Hill. "Access will be granted to only those codes that are essential to 
complete the project." 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that codes 
for the new F-16 digital flight control computer, for instance, which just came 
out last year, will not be released to the Japanese. However, other software 
source codes needed for the FSX computer will be released. 
</P>
<P>
Any new technology developed by the Japanese during the FSX program will be 
available to U.S. firms, but Japan will be banned from transferring to third 
countries or firms any technology derived from the U.S.-built F-16 plane, the 
officials added. 
</P>
<P>
Because the FSX has a new generation of engines and avionics systems, 
safeguarding U.S. technology was a major sticking point in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
A Defense Department official stressed that the United States would not provide 
Japan with highly sophisticated, top-secret software used in the most advanced 
F-16 jets. He also said the FSX would not be a better plane than American-built 
fighters. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to be superior, it's going to be different," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Administration sources said the deal would be sent to Congress for review on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan Administration first negotiated the arrangement after Japan refused 
to buy any U.S. F-16 fighters and indicated it would build its own fighter 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposition Surfaced Immediately 
</P>
<P>
Opposition to the plan surfaced almost instantly on Capitol Hill, where critics 
contend that the arrangement amounts to a giveaway of advanced technology that 
Japan may use to help propel the its civilian aircraft industry into 
head-to-head competition with the United States in the world market. They say 
Tokyo should purchase American-made planes to help offset the $50-billion U.S. 
trade deficit with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
But supporters of the idea said the project is a way to add fighters to Japan's 
inventory at Tokyo's expense. It also would provide jobs for the United States, 
and give Washington access to sophisticated radar technology developed by 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations reached an impasse last month when Japan and the United States 
failed to agree on the exact proportion of the work to be guaranteed to 
U.S.-based companies and on what kind of technology the two countries would 
share. 
</P>
<P>
The United States demanded -- and finally got -- a Japanese commitment to 
allocate at least a 40% share of FSX production to American companies and 
workers and to clearly define the existing technology in the plane, so that the 
United States would be able to claim access to any advances that come out the 
joint project. 
</P>
<P>
Reports from Tokyo earlier Friday said the agreement was near on the project as 
the Defense Agency decided to retract a demand that more than 50% of engine 
production work be given to Japan and that Japan receive all computer software 
for flight control of the U.S. F-16, which is the basis for the FSX jet.

Soviet Jewish immigrants living in Israel have submitted a record number of 
invitations for their relatives to come from the Soviet Union, Israel Radio 
reported. It said about 79,000 invitations were submitted to Soviet authorities 
last year, the highest annual figure since the late 1960s. An invitation from 
relatives living abroad is a necessary step for a person wishing to emigrate 
from the Soviet Union. Uri Gordon, head of the Jewish Agency's immigration 
department, was quoted by the radio as estimating that Soviet Jewish emigration 
will reach 50,000 this year.

LOUISIANA VOTERS REJECT TAX REVISIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Voters rejected a plan to overhaul Louisiana's tax system that had been 
heralded by Gov. Buddy Roemer as a chance to end the state's lengthy recession. 
With 3,181 of the state's 3,285 precincts reporting, about 97%, the proposed 
constitutional amendment to authorize the Legislature to change the tax system 
was rejected 531,392, or 55%, to 432,483, or 45%. About 45% of the state's 
registered voters turned out, a spokesman for the secretary of state said. 
Under Roemer's package, the tax base would have been shifted by putting more of 
a load on individuals through the income tax, cutting sales taxes and giving 
businesses incentive to move to the state and expand. The plan included a 
$1.4-billion program to improve highways, airports and shipping ports that 
would be funded by a gasoline tax increase of 4 cents a gallon.

A black trade union is seeking to stop the sale of Mobil Corp. assets in South 
Africa until it negotiates a disinvestment procedure providing job security and 
other benefits, the union said. The Chemical Workers Industrial Union, which 
represents 1,200 of Mobil's 1,500 South African black workers, said it applied 
for relief to the Industrial Court, a government labor tribunal. Mobil said it 
is selling its operations to General Mining Union Corp. Ltd. "Far from being 
moral or politically progressive, Mobil has seriously disadvantaged its work 
force by selling to one of the most notoriously anti-union South African 
corporations," a union statement said. However, Mobil has said General Mining 
agreed to honor all existing labor agreements.

The state chose two sites in Imperial County for new prisons that will house 
4,400 inmates. The new prisons will be near Calipatria in the central part of 
the county and near Mt. Signal in the southern part, Corrections Director James 
Rowland said. The state already has legislative authorization for a 
$208-million, 2,200-bed maximum-security institution near Calipatria, Rowland 
said. The department will seek legislative authorization for the second site, a 
2,200-bed medium-security facility, to be funded from a 1990 prison 
construction bond issue, Rowland said.

John Galen Davenport, the last of four Orange County men to be retried after 
the state Supreme Court reversed their death sentences, has been sentenced to 
death again. Davenport, 34, of Tustin was convicted eight years ago of the 
March 27, 1980, murder of Gayle Ann Lingle, 30, in a Fullerton field. She had 
been stabbed more than a dozen times and was found impaled on a 4-foot wooden 
stake. The state Supreme Court under Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird upheld 
Davenport's conviction but ordered a new death penalty trial, ruling that 
errors had been made by the trial judge and the prosecutor.

AMERASIANS: VIETNAM'S MISBEGOTTEN LEGACY

HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The war was still raging that day 15 years ago when Vietnamese nuns heard the 
cries of a baby boy stuffed in a garbage can and took him inside their 
orphanage to raise. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Nguyen Thanh Binh, the son of a black American who went home and a 
Vietnamese mother who abandoned him, shares the plight of thousands of 
Amerasian youths languishing in the decay of Vietnam, desperately trying to get 
out and find their fathers. 
</P>
<P>
"My circumstances are miserable," says Lam Anh Hong, 18, whose mother gave her 
away to a relative. "I always live with hope. I don't give up hope." 
</P>
<P>
Like Binh and Hong, many of the Amerasians born of American fathers and 
Vietnamese mothers were abandoned by both parents, left in orphanages or with 
relatives or friends, often to fend for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jobless, Unwanted 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Amerasians are jobless, homeless, uneducated, unwanted, barely able 
to speak English. They sleep at night on the sidewalks and in the parks. Some 
turn to prostitution to stay alive. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks like Binh also are victims of a Vietnamese caste system. White 
Amerasians may be at the bottom in the clannish Vietnamese society, but they 
are at the top within the Amerasian society. The black Amerasians are at the 
bottom. 
</P>
<P>
All suffer the taunts of their Vietnamese peers, "Amerasians no good. Go to 
America." 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Brown Phuong, at 25 one of the older Amerasians, was one of those 
abandoned by their mothers. "She don't want I be her son," he says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Nobody Helps Us' 
</P>
<P>
Phuong was raised in a Roman Catholic orphanage in Da Nang but ran away when he 
was 11 and boarded an evacuation ship to Ho Chi Minh City as North Vietnamese 
forces swept southward to conquer South Vietnam in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Now he sells newspapers, cigarettes and bread and sleeps in a park. "Nobody 
helps us," he says. "Look at my eyes. They are very old because I work very 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
But some get lucky. Nguyen Thi Thu Huong, an 18-year-old wearing a blue ribbon 
in her brown hair and pink slippers on her mud-caked feet, was found one day 
selling postcards for nickels and dimes, washing herself in a fountain in the 
center of the city. Her father left Vietnam when she was 2. 
</P>
<P>
"Only foreigners help," she says. "I feel lonely. I feel sad. I want to be in 
the U.S. to study, work and have friends. I go, I have a job and a good house." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dream Came True 
</P>
<P>
Then, a short time later, she is a Cinderella, on her way to America with her 
mother, one hand carrying a suitcase, the other affectionately wrapped around 
her 8-year-old Vietnamese half-brother. A small group of Amerasian street kids 
went to Tan Son Nhut Airport to see them off. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials say help is also on the way for the 10,000 Amerasians that they 
estimate still remain. Vietnamese authorities put the estimate at 16,000 but 
that is hard to pin down because no official census has been taken. More than 
6,000 Amerasians and 11,000 of their relatives have left Vietnam legally since 
the start of the U.S. Orderly Departures Program in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce A. Beardsley, director of the Orderly Departures Program in Bangkok, 
Thailand, has cut much of the bureaucratic paper work and persuaded the 
Vietnamese to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been pushing the best I can to get departures to go at a much more 
rapid rate," he says. "We're trying to expand the transportation net." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5,500 Were Waiting 
</P>
<P>
At one point early this year, 5,500 Amerasians and their family members already 
approved for resettlement in the United States were awaiting transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the Amerasians camp out in a park next to the Foreign Ministry, 
awaiting the roll of the dice, the anticipated approval that will be their 
ticket to America. In the interim, they hang out in front of the hotels, 
clinging to American tourists, begging not only for money but for affection. 
</P>
<P>
Some Amerasians carry the physical scars of war as well as the mental pain of 
rejection. 
</P>
<P>
Pham Thi Lan, 22, never knew her father. Her mother died of heart disease when 
she was 8. When her stepfather remarried, he threw her out of the house and she 
went to live with her grandmother. Her neck and chest are scarred by napalm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Los Arm in War 
</P>
<P>
Vuong Thanh Hai, 20, has a hole in his head and only one arm. His father left 
when he was born, his mother died when he was 6. Shrapnel from a 155-millimeter 
artillery shell cut away his right arm. 
</P>
<P>
The Amerasians are the legacy of some 2.7 million Americans who served in 
Vietnam until the last were withdrawn in 1973. Other Americans, including 
military and civilian employees of the U.S. Embassy, remained until the 
U.S.-supported Saigon government of South Vietnam fell to Communist North 
Vietnam in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Many Amerasians and their fathers have been trying for years to find each 
other. But some Amerasians were rejected by fathers who want nothing to do with 
them. Some of the fathers, already married, went back to their American 
families. Others returned and married American women after the war and started 
new families. Some may be unaware that they left offspring behind. 
</P>
<P>
But for some who do know, the wrenching memories have driven them into 
post-traumatic stress disorder and counseling, unable to resolve the guilt of 
leaving their child in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Government Cooperation 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government lately has been cooperating more in efforts to send 
the remaining Amerasians to America, promoting it as a humanitarian gesture. 
But U.S. officials say the real motive is to establish better relations with 
the United States in hope that it will lead to diplomatic recognition and badly 
needed American aid. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure it's not just humanitarian instincts which are pushing things in the 
direction they're going," Beardsley says. "They've got an economy that's in a 
hell of a mess." 
</P>
<P>
So bankrupt is Vietnam's economy that the government until recently insisted on 
booking all refugees including Amerasians and their families on Air Vietnam, 
the official government airline, because it so desperately needs the U.S. 
dollars. But often the Air Vietnam flights are unreliable because of mechanical 
problems or the bumping of refugees, whose fares are discounted, for 
higher-paying passengers, U.S. officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Now refugees are permitted to travel on other airlines, and U.S. officials have 
been working to add charters. The other carriers that service Ho Chi Minh City 
-- Air France and Thai Airways -- are booked with so many regular passengers at 
full fare that it is difficult to get seats for refugees at reduced fare. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cultural Orientation 
</P>
<P>
Last December, some flights were begun directly to the Philippines, where 
Amerasians and relatives spend six months for language training and cultural 
orientation that will help them adjust quicker in the United States. The usual 
routing is through Bangkok. 
</P>
<P>
The International Committee for Migration based in Geneva, an organization that 
assists refugees, is now coordinating all transportation out of Ho Chi Minh 
City for them. 
</P>
<P>
In efforts to help the dirt-poor Amerasians in the countryside who could not 
otherwise afford the travel and lodging for their interviews in Ho Chi Minh 
City, the United States has approved in principle a Vietnamese proposal to 
establish an Amerasian transit center to be financed by the United States. The 
center would provide transportation and a place to stay for the Amerasians and 
their families while they are being processed. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the promises, for some it is too late. They are no longer the cute, 
cuddly children of the war years of the '60s and '70s. They have grown into 
teen-agers and young adults, as old now as their fathers were then. Some gave 
up hope, took jobs, married, had children of their own and changed their minds 
about leaving. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Search Is Futile 
</P>
<P>
For many Amerasians, the desperate search for their fathers is futile. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been contacted by probably just over 200 men who are looking for kids 
or know where their kids are at," says Bruce Burns, a San Jose, Calif., 
attorney and tracer of Amerasians and their fathers. "If you compare that to 
how many Amerasians there are, it's a very small number." 
</P>
<P>
Burns has been successful in locating some fathers. But many of them have 
settled into the "real world," as opposed to what they saw as the unreality of 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"In most cases," Burns says, "the father said, 'I don't want anything to do 
with the child. Don't bother me. I don't want to disrupt my family or my life. 
That was a long time ago when I was young and I want to forget about it.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rejected by Father 
</P>
<P>
Burns recalls helping one girl find her father, an Army chaplain during the 
war. She was attractive, bright, fluent in English and a medical school 
student. 
</P>
<P>
"He's still a minister in the United States," Burns says. "He just told her to 
get lost. He didn't want anything to do with her. He didn't want her to 
infringe on his life. He acknowledged that this is his child but he didn't care 
about her." 
</P>
<P>
Burns says the Vietnamese government is concerned that some Amerasian women are 
selling sex, attracting mostly Soviet and other Eastern European soldiers and 
civilians. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're living on the streets and you don't know who your family is and 
you have the opportunity to make money through prostitution, it's very 
attractive to them," he says. "The alternative is to continue to not have 
enough to eat and to barely survive." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Minimum Requirements 
</P>
<P>
Beardsley says the United States has cut the documentary requirements for an 
Amerasian to leave Vietnam to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
"Essentially an Amerasian's face is his passport," he says. "If you look like 
an Amerasian, we don't care if you have any documents at all. You don't have to 
have an identified father to move somebody out." 
</P>
<P>
Beardsley says no one has been denied resettlement because they are suspected 
of prostitution, but he says he has seen reports that "some of them have been 
continuing in this profession on resettlement in the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
Luu Van Tanh, vice chief of the Consular Section, denies his government 
discriminates against the Amerasians, but concedes that other Vietnamese 
children mock them and other Vietnamese discriminate against them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mothers Forced to Choose 
</P>
<P>
Some of the mothers later married Vietnamese men who forced them to choose 
between them and their Amerasian children. Others had difficulty finding a job 
because they had Amerasian children. 
</P>
<P>
Other women tried to protect their children by hiding them in the home or 
moving them from the cities to the country, by putting charcoal on their face 
or dying their light hair black to disguise them, and by destroying all of the 
documents and photographs showing that they had an American father. 
</P>
<P>
One child was virtually a prisoner in her apartment until she went to the 
United States because her mother did not want her subjected to the taunts of 
the other kids. 
</P>
<P>
"Those children are the victims of the war and we . . . must help them," Tanh 
says.

British authorities are investigating the nation's biggest arms deal following 
bribery allegations over $34 billion in contracts with Saudi Arabia, the 
Observer newspaper said. It said investigators are looking at claims that huge 
commission payments, alleged to have been made to British Aerospace agents, 
inflated the export sale price of Tornado fighter-bombers. Government officials 
were unavailable for comment. British Aerospace concluded an $8.5-billion deal 
with Saudi Arabia in 1986 to supply military aircraft and weapons systems. Last 
July, Britain signed a second agreement estimated at up to $26 billion.

Violence continued in Senegal as thousands of youths rampaged through the 
capital of Dakar in an anti-Moor frenzy. Soldiers and police fired tear gas as 
gangs defied a state of emergency and tore through the streets, smashing and 
burning Mauritanian shops. A Reuters news agency correspondent counted 33 
bodies at the main hospital morgue. The victims were mainly light-skinned Moors 
of Arab and Berber descent. Most Senegalese are black.

NEWSMAKERS: QUAYLE REPORT CARD: GOOD MARKS FOR IMAGE REPAIR

Much is being made of President Bush's performance during his first 100 days in 
office. But little has been written about Dan Quayle's first 100 days as vice 
president. In Quayle's case, the questions usually center on how well he's been 
able to regain his confidence and his composure and rebuild his image after 
being battered during last year's presidential race. The Quayle jokes have 
begun to subside. He's been moderately successful in appearing at ease at 
public forums and at sessions with reporters. And, by many standards, he has 
earned good marks in his role as a presidential representative on his official 
trips to Venezuela, El Salvador and, currently, the Pacific. "As damaged as he 
was coming in, I don't think you can expect any more than him trying to negate 
some of the damage that was done," said Phil Truluck of the conservative 
Heritage Foundation.

 -- The good name of Henry Flipper has been restored -- thanks to the state of 
Georgia. In a special ceremony in Thomasville, Atty. Gen. Michael Bowers placed 
a marker at the grave of Flipper, the first black to be graduated from West 
Point. Bowers said it was time "we righted this great wrong." Flipper was 
graduated from West Point in 1877 and four years later, as the officer in 
charge of the Ft. Sill, Okla., commissary, he was charged with embezzling 
$3,791 and conduct unbecoming an officer. He was acquitted of the theft charge 
but convicted of unbecoming conduct. However, it took 96 years more for the 
Army to exonerate the man West Point would later name part of its library 
after. Flipper's niece, Irsle King of Valdosta, Ga., and Gwinnett County 
teacher Ray MacColl had fought for 18 years to secure proper recognition. The 
man who was born into slavery in Thomasville died in 1940 at the age of 84 -- 
long before a world was able to express its regrets.

 -- The recent rampage in New York's Central Park in which a woman jogger was 
beaten and raped by a gang of young thugs has prompted real estate tycoon 
Donald Trump to pay $85,000 for full-page ads in four New York newspapers 
calling for a return of the death penalty. In an interview with United Press 
International, Trump said: "The criminal is being protected and the victim is 
getting zero protection." He said the message in his ads, which are running 
today, "is going beyond the death penalty -- this is giving back the policemen 
their power. . . . " JAMES MARNELL

Poland will suspend plans to build its second nuclear power plant because of 
the "doubts and fears expressed by society," state radio said. Plans to 
construct the nuclear plant in the Pila province town of Klempicz had aroused 
protests in western Poland. The plant, to have been finished by the year 2000, 
would be about 30 miles north of Poznan, a city of 585,000. Industry Minister 
Mieczyslaw Wilczek met with governors from western Poland whose provinces are 
near the proposed plant and told them he favored a "comprehensive review of the 
development program of the nuclear power industry in Poland." Poland's first 
nuclear power plant, scheduled to begin producing power in 1991, is being built 
in Zarnowie, on the Baltic coast.

SORROW AND HARDSHIP FOR RETIRED PARENTS; 
</P>
<P>
MANY AIDS PATIENTS MOVING TO FLORIDA

<P>
The tranquil life style many people came here to enjoy in their later years is 
coming to a jarring end for a growing number of retirees whose grown children 
want to move back in -- and have AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"Some parents find out for the first time their child is gay, and at the same 
time that he also has AIDS. This is a real blow," said one 56-year-old woman 
whose son learned that he has the disease two years ago. (She requested 
anonymity to protect his identity.) "Parents always think they should die 
first, before their children." 
</P>
<P>
"And AIDS can split families," she added. "Some members of the family accept, 
others reject him. That makes it worse for everybody. And you lose friends. 
Some churches even reject you." 
</P>
<P>
And, said Roger Lane of the Health Crisis Network in Miami, the $50,000 to 
$120,000 it costs to care for someone suffering from acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome puts an extra burden on elderly parents with limited incomes. 
</P>
<P>
Social workers and AIDS help-network officials say that more and more AIDS 
patients are coming to Florida. Some hope that the warm climate will help them 
avoid the pneumonia and flu infections to which they are susceptible. Others 
come from smaller states to get better medical care. Many of them have family 
here. 
</P>
<P>
State officials have no firm data, but some clinics estimate that 10% to 15% of 
their AIDS patients came to Florida after diagnosis. The number of reported 
cases in the state, which officials said would not include some diagnosed 
elsewhere, has tripled since January, 1987, to 6,856, placing Florida third, 
behind New York and California. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't turn patients away," said Jim Cobb, administrator of the state AIDS 
clinic in Palm Beach County, "but we can't be the front doorstep for the 
country. We don't want to resemble the Statue of Liberty." 
</P>
<P>
As education about AIDS improves and relatives learn that the deadly virus is 
not transmitted by casual contact, instances of family rejection are becoming 
fewer, Lane said. "Think about being at the terminal stage of your life and you 
have been rejected by the ones you feel close to, and you feel isolated from 
your relatives." 
</P>
<P>
"The scariest thing for a young person is to be alone," said Mary Meeker, who, 
through a Roman Catholic Church program, works as a volunteer with the Pasco 
AIDS Support Community. 
</P>
<P>
"I found that gays are the first ones to turn and run when they find out you 
have AIDS," said a 26-year-old Hudson man who learned he has AIDS in October, 
"but my family has been very supportive. I'm glad they're there." He asked not 
to be identified to protect his lover. In small towns such as this one 30 miles 
north of Tampa on the Gulf Coast, news that someone is infected with AIDS 
travels quickly. 
</P>
<P>
The Hernando-Pasco Hospice, which cares for terminally ill people at home, 
started a Pasco support group in October, 1987. The participants have painful 
memories: a son whose parents changed the locks; a youth whose brother-in-law 
told him to hurry up and die so he wouldn't burden the family. 
</P>
<P>
The hospice group has grown from four to 36 members, and two others have been 
started in Pasco County, where 44% of the 260,000 residents are older than 55. 
</P>
<P>
"We have so many elderly people here, so many parents in one place, that we're 
seeing AIDS patients from other cities, coming here to die with their parents," 
said Peter Pavich, a support group member who has learned he carries the human 
immune deficiency virus, HIV, which causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Pavich said his work with the group has helped him understand his own family's 
feelings of rejection. "It's really unfair. It's supposed to be their golden 
years and everything's going great, and then they're hit with this brick wall 
and everything changes." 
</P>
<P>
In this county, which is typical of rural areas being discovered by land 
developers, a relatively small influx of people with AIDS quickly strains 
services. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many things we need in this area. We need food, medical 
attention, outpatient care, dental treatment," said Eva Sylvester, a hospice 
services coordinator. She said she recently called seven dentists before she 
found one who would treat an AIDS patient. 
</P>
<P>
"We get frustrated, we get angry. What we need is more information and more 
education."

BAGFUL OF EXTRA CHARGES, SPECIAL REGULATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
WITH NO DUMP, TRASH IS A STICKY ISSUE

<P>
Sanitation workers tore into a plastic garbage bag, searching for clues. The 
giveaway could have been a receipt, a letter. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, an unopened envelope from a mail-order publishing contest was the 
telltale evidence needed to trace the smelly bag to its source. 
</P>
<P>
A police officer who follows the local garbage truck as part of the new detail 
tracked down the culprit -- one of the many people who, since January, have had 
to be told they were mishandling their garbage. About 20 have been arrested and 
fined for violating city codes on trash disposal. 
</P>
<P>
Garbage -- and how to throw it away -- has taken on a whole new meaning for the 
7,900 residents of Hudson since last fall, when the county landfill was closed 
for pollution violations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disposal Requires Effort 
</P>
<P>
People in Columbia County do not simply drag the week's trash to the curb 
anymore. Disposal takes thought, time and money. 
</P>
<P>
City residents must place $2 stickers on their garbage bags or they will not be 
picked up. That is because the county has to come up with an estimated $6 
million to pay for shipping the trash elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Hudson residents who consistently refuse to use the stickers can be assessed a 
$15 service charge, plus a $5 charge per bag, which is placed on their 
quarterly water and sewer bills. 
</P>
<P>
But even the sticker system is not foolproof. 
</P>
<P>
When the program began in December, there were some complaints of sticker 
stealing. Then, the stickers did not adhere well in cold weather, and more than 
one resident has been seen chasing after one on a cold and windy day. Now the 
county is considering giving up the stickers and selling garbage bags instead. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult. It really is," Paulette Riegel said from behind the counter in 
her furniture and crafts store. "You never knew garbage was worth so much." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sections for Recycling 
</P>
<P>
"My animals love it, because they are getting more scraps from the table than 
ever," says Riegel, who seems to be taking the new regulations in stride. At 
least one customer had already ordered a special wooden bin divided into 
sections for recycling, which soon will be mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
Down the main street, another store owner said she called the county to ask how 
best to dispose of hundreds of cardboard boxes from shipments to her store. 
Because cardboard recycling had not yet begun, she was told to cut the boxes 
into little pieces, place them in garbage bags and put them at the curb -- with 
the mandatory sticker on the bag. 
</P>
<P>
The boxes remained at the store until she gave them to a community group. 
</P>
<P>
Other people have not been that conscientious. 
</P>
<P>
Early resistance to the new rules prompted the special police garbage team. 
</P>
<P>
"People who reside outside the city were bringing their garbage into the city 
and dumping it in the alleys," Police Chief James Dolan Jr. said. On the 
upside, he said, compliance is improving. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Response Mixed 
</P>
<P>
Reaction from residents has been "a very mixed bag," county Board of 
Supervisors Chairman Francis Blake says. 
</P>
<P>
Liquor store owner Julie Goldweitz says the recycling and sticker program is "a 
pain in the neck, but other than that, it makes perfect sense to me. We're 
doing what we should have been doing for years. If that's the real cost of us 
living here on this planet, then we have to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
The rest of New York state -- and the nation -- might do well to learn from the 
misfortune of Columbia County, if they are not already in the throes of garbage 
disposal problems, government and industry officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not unusual in these times for counties or municipalities -- in the 
East, especially -- to find themselves with no disposal alternative," Joe 
Salimondo, editor of Waste Age magazine in Washington, said. 
</P>
<P>
Some big cities have already run out of landfill space and now export their 
garbage at very high cost, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The notorious Long Island barge that spent eight weeks at sea in 1987 and was 
rejected by several states and three countries, was a prime example of garbage 
with no place to go. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
14,000 Tons of Ash 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia had a similar experience with a freighter that was laden with 
14,000 tons of ash and was at sea for two years. It was rejected by at least 11 
countries and eventually turned up empty in Singapore, under a different name 
and ownership. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst situation for waste disposal is in the northeastern part of the 
United States, because of the population density and the lack of availability 
of disposal sites," says Ross Patten, vice president of Browning-Ferris 
Industries, a nationwide waste hauler based in Houston. "Other parts of the 
country are not as acutely affected, other than California." 
</P>
<P>
"Columbia County should serve as a warning to a lot of other communities who 
haven't taken affirmative action toward resolving their solid waste problems," 
says R. W. Groneman of the state Department of Environmental Conservation. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, where 20 million tons of garbage are produced annually, the state 
has implemented tough new standards on landfills and has a set a goal of 
reducing or recycling 50% of the waste by the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Landfills 
</P>
<P>
A number of New York communities are opening landfills, composting leaves, 
instituting recycling and requiring use of special garbage bags to raise 
revenue for increased disposal costs. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Columbia County's problem was a political football and nothing 
was done until the issue reached crisis proportions. 
</P>
<P>
"The landfills that we as a nation have built over the years are filling up," 
Salimondo says. "But the public reaction to landfills -- thanks to the whole 
earth movement of the last 18 years -- have made people aware that they don't 
want a landfill in their back yard."

A wildfire on Friday burned 4,000 to 6,000 acres of the Osceola National Forest 
and sent smoke 45 miles away, over Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still burning uncontained," said Scott Enos, duty officer and supervisor 
of the state Division of Forestry in Lake City. "We don't expect any relief 
from the weather before Monday." 
</P>
<P>
Westerly winds carried the smoke and the National Weather Service warned of 
dense smoke in Jacksonville over the weekend unless the fire is brought under 
control. Enos said the smoke was not blowing over major highways. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Forest Service said 100 firefighters were fighting the blaze in 
Pinhook Swamp, 23 miles northeast of Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
Enos said no structures have been damaged, and there have been no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working at keeping it within the forest boundaries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two helicopters and a U.S. Forest Service air-tanker plane using fire retardant 
chemicals dropped water on the fire Thursday, a state spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"The air-tanker has not been very effective because the flames are so high and 
the fire is running so rapidly," said Cheryl Summers, information officer for 
the Florida Division of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
Summers said the swamp area made it difficult to reach the fire, which was also 
fueled by dry conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Several commercial paper companies joined state and federal firefighters to 
battle the blaze. Lumber companies were helping fight the fire by cutting down 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire, which began Thursday, was under investigation. It began 
on land adjacent to the forest owned by a subsidiary of Container Corp.

ACUPUNCTURE TRIED AS WAY TO EASE CRAVINGS FOR DRUGS

The balding man with the black-and-gray beard leaned his head back with his 
eyes closed, relaxing, as if in a trance. Three needles protruded from each ear 
and another was stuck into the top of his head. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce, a 36-year-old alcoholic and cocaine addict, was undergoing what some 
doctors say is a promising treatment for drug abusers -- acupuncture. 
</P>
<P>
In the city-run clinic around Bruce, 30 people relaxed in armchairs after being 
stuck in each ear with three, four or five half-inch-long stainless steel 
needles. One man read the morning paper. A woman held her baby in her lap. 
Another man sang softly to himself in Spanish. Others dozed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clinic in South Bronx 
</P>
<P>
They were all drug addicts and had come from throughout New York City to 
Lincoln Hospital's acupuncture detoxification clinic in the South Bronx, a 
neighborhood where drug-dealing, arson and violent death are a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors and patients at the clinic say acupuncture helps alcoholics and addicts 
relax and relieves their intense cravings. Other doctors say that there have 
not been enough scientific studies to determine if acupuncture actually eases 
withdrawal symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 centers have been modeled after the South Bronx program, including 
clinics in the Netherlands, Britain and Nepal, said Dr. Michael O. Smith, 
Lincoln Hospital's medical director for substance abuse treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Acupuncture, developed more than 2,500 years ago by the Chinese, relieves pain 
and stress by inserting needles into specific points on the body that are 
believed to affect organs and bodily functions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Helps Endure Withdrawal 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln's acupuncture program was begun in 1974 as an alternative to giving 
heroin addicts methadone, a synthetic narcotic. Like methadone, acupuncture 
does not cure addiction -- it helps patients get through the withdrawal period. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic also has used acupuncture to treat more than 500 AIDS patients in 
the last six years. Some of them reported relief from symptoms of the deadly 
disease such as diarrhea, night sweats and skin rashes. 
</P>
<P>
Smith and many other doctors initially thought the idea of using acupuncture to 
treat drug addicts seemed far-fetched. 
</P>
<P>
"I must say that I was sympathetic to the idea of a drug-free treatment, but I 
was skeptical that something as genteel as acupuncture would have any effect in 
the drug world. And I think that is a common attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"But, when we gave the treatment, we saw right before our eyes that it relieved 
the patients' symptoms and made them feel better." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Receive Counseling 
</P>
<P>
Once the patients are beyond the immediate symptoms of withdrawal, he said, 
they receive regular counseling at the clinic and are encouraged to attend 
meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or another support group. 
</P>
<P>
"I was doing a lot of cocaine," said Bruce (not his real name). "I was sniffing 
large quantities. I started hearing a lot of voices and stuff. Paranoia set in. 
I had a lot of suicidal thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
At the peak of his habit, Bruce said, he was drinking as much as a case of beer 
a day and sniffing up about $150 worth of cocaine on weekends. "I was losing 
everything: my home life, the house, myself -- but I couldn't stop." 
</P>
<P>
Since he began the acupuncture with counseling and joined Narcotics Anonymous, 
Bruce said, he has been able to stay off cocaine and booze for more than two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
"The desire, the compulsion to do any drug is gone," he said. "I've even quit 
smoking, and I had started when I was 12 or 13 years old." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unsure How It Works 
</P>
<P>
Western scientists aren't sure how the ancient therapy works, but some believe 
the needle punctures stimulate the brain to produce endorphins, a natural 
pain-killer. Others theorize that the needles may interrupt pain messages to 
the brain. 
</P>
<P>
The American Medical Assn. last took a position on acupuncture in 1981, calling 
it "an experimental procedure" that could "provide temporary relief from pain" 
and deserved further study, AMA spokesman Dan Maier said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's inconceivable to me that acupuncture can have a genuine pharmacological 
effect on something like drug abuse," said Dr. Stephen Barrett, a psychiatrist 
and board member of the National Council Against Health Fraud. "I think it 
flies in the face of common sense that needling somebody would make any 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
Other doctors involved in drug-abuse treatment say they have heard anecdotal 
reports that acupuncture relieves withdrawal symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Enough Studies 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that, to date, there haven't been (enough) controlled studies 
documenting whether acupuncture works," said Dr. Robert Millman, director of 
drug and alcohol abuse services at New York Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Without that scientific research, "there's no way of knowing whether it works 
or not," said Dr. Jack Blaine, chief of the treatment research branch at the 
National Institute on Drug Abuse in Bethesda, Md., which recently approved a 
$140,000 grant for a study of Lincoln's acupuncture program. 
</P>
<P>
The journal "Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research" in 1987 reported 
that a study of 54 alcoholics found that acupuncture helped prevent relapses. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Mindy Fullilove, an assistant professor of clinical psychiatry in the 
University of California system, is studying heroin addicts to see whether 
acupuncture or methadone is more effective.

CAPITAL'S CRIMINALS UNWELCOME IN THE SUBURBS

<P>
Eighty years ago, federal officials told the District of Columbia to build its 
new prison 20 miles outside the capital, in the rolling hills near Lorton, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Today that prison is an unwanted neighbor in the suburbs that have grown up 
around it. The overcrowded and antiquated complex is a source of anxiety to 
residents of the area. 
</P>
<P>
District officials say their efforts to ease problems at the Lorton corrections 
complex have been blocked at every turn, and there's little they can do. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lost control," said Charlie Peelie, one of the guards charged with 
keeping order among the 8,600 inmates at Lorton. "It's just that there are too 
many people here." 
</P>
<P>
"We live on a powder keg," said Helen Thacker, who lives nearby. She said she 
hopes her household alarm system and the heavy locks on her back yard gates 
will protect her the next time a prisoner escapes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
D.C. Mayor's Lament 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wants everybody locked up, but not in their neighborhood," Marion 
Barry Jr., the district mayor, said. "We have to do something." 
</P>
<P>
But what? 
</P>
<P>
Barry has proposed building a new prison inside the district and also expanding 
Lorton. Preservationists are trying to block the proposed facility in the 
district and Virginia officials, led by a congressman, are opposing expansion 
of the prison. 
</P>
<P>
All the while, conditions inside the 200-acre prison complex grow ever worse. 
</P>
<P>
The facility is 1,400 prisoners over capacity and expects at least 4,000 more 
inmates to be added by the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Men stand in line for hours at mealtime. Showers and toilets are too few and 
recreational facilities are so scarce that some men sit around for lack of 
anything better to do. Two men sleep in cells built for one. 
</P>
<P>
"The inmates are very uncomfortable and tempers are short," a chaplain, the 
Rev. Manning Moore, said. "There are men who are cursing for attention and 
can't get it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inauguration Day Riot 
</P>
<P>
One such eruption of tempers drew the nation's attention just hours after 
President Bush was sworn in on Jan. 20. An inmate was stabbed to death, and 
fires set by prisoners running amok destroyed two buildings. 
</P>
<P>
No one escaped then, but 12 men got out last year and three of them are still 
at large. One was convicted of manslaughter; the others were serving time for 
first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Fairfax County, some of whom live within a block or two of the 
prison, say they have seen escapees walking around their neighborhoods at 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Walker frets when her 5-year-old son goes outside to play. She hopes the 
family Doberman pinscher will stand off any intruder. 
</P>
<P>
"I have guns," she added, "and if I need to protect myself or my son, I'll do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
District officials say that such fears are unfounded, however. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Escapees Go Home 
</P>
<P>
"People in Fairfax County are so scared, but we have never had an incident in 
Fairfax." Pat Wheeler of the Corrections Department said. Lorton escapees, she 
said, "almost always go back to Southeast (quadrant of the district). If you 
watch the homes of their family and friends long enough, you'll usually find 
them." 
</P>
<P>
The people of Fairfax, one of the wealthiest counties in the nation, wonder 
about the prison's future, and so does the Barry administration. Barry has 
proposed a $350-million, 10-year modernization of Lorton, along with expansion 
of the district's halfway house program and building a second prison near the 
jail in Southeast Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The projects would add 3,525 beds to the 7,200 now considered the maximum at 
Lorton. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the district's program focuses on Lorton, where only 200 acres of the 
2,000-acre site are in use. "The most appropriate place" for a new prison, 
Wheeler said, "would be to build it in Virginia." 
</P>
<P>
Wrong, says Rep. Stan Parris (R-Va.), whose constituency includes the Lorton 
area. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation at Lorton reached crisis proportions a decade ago, and it has 
continued to deteriorate," Parris said after the uprising in January. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prison Funds Denied 
</P>
<P>
Last October, he succeeded in having Congress turn down the district's request 
for $45 million to build an 800-bed addition at Lorton. Although the city 
operates the prison, it is federal property and the government would have to 
pay for any improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only penal institution in the nation that's located outside the 
political boundaries it's supposed to serve," Parris said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the penal requirements of the District of Columbia are best served by 
the construction of a new and modern facility within the district . . . but, 
like a sewage plant or a dump or anything else, nobody wants it in their 
neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
At least not those who live near the district jailhouse. They stalled the plan 
by seeking historic designation for the chosen site. 
</P>
<P>
Late last year, however, the capital's Historic Preservation Board rejected the 
community group's arguments, and officials now hope to begin construction this 
spring.

FEARING COURT RULING, WOMAN TELLS OF ILLEGAL ABORTION; 
</P>
<P>
REMEMBERING DAYS BEFORE ROE VS. WADE

<P>
Beulah, a 74-year-old widow from New York City, remembers the one time she 
broke the law as if it were yesterday. Forty-three years ago, she had an 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"I was greeted at the door by a woman in white. She asked me for the money -- 
$800 -- and led me to the kitchen to a man wearing a surgical mask who one 
assumes was a doctor." 
</P>
<P>
Women like Beulah, who went to untrained "back alley" abortionists, do not want 
to see the days of illegal abortion return. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spoke at Manhattan Forum 
</P>
<P>
Recently Beulah spoke at a Manhattan forum that marked the 16th anniversary of 
Roe vs. Wade, the Supreme Court decision declaring abortion legal throughout 
the country. Though she used her full name at the forum, Beulah did not want to 
give her last name for this story because she has come to fear reprisals from 
anti-abortion groups. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court last week began weighing a Missouri statute designed to limit 
access to abortion. The Reagan Administration had asked the Supreme Court to 
use the statute to overturn Roe vs. Wade. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that we have to get as many people as possible to fight against its 
overturn," Beulah said. "Abortions should be performed under legal, safe, 
sanitary conditions at low cost with counseling." 
</P>
<P>
There are no accurate figures available for the number of abortions performed 
secretly before 1973, when Roe vs. Wade was decided. In 1985, 1.3 million 
abortions were performed in the United States, according to the latest data 
available from the National Center for Health Statistics. Of 272 
pregnancy-related deaths in 1986, three were the result of abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Most provisions of the Missouri statute, which could limit public funds for 
abortions or counseling about the procedure, were struck down by the federal 
district court in Missouri and the U.S. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. The 
Supreme Court is now faced with the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Married People Also 
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays, many people think that it's just the young, single people who need 
abortions. But married, mature people need them too," Beulah said. 
</P>
<P>
Beulah and her husband had been married nine years when they discovered that 
she was pregnant again. They already had two children. Beulah worked as a 
secretary before she started rearing her family. Her husband was a salesman. 
Money was tight -- they could not afford to rear another child, Beulah said. 
Though they discussed an abortion, her husband left the decision to her. Beulah 
does not regret her choice. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not know what the future held. We had just come through the Depression 
and World War II," Beulah said last year during an interview on the "Sally 
Jessy Raphael" television talk show. "I wanted to bring up two children, who 
are now adults and parents on their own, whom I wanted to take care of properly 
from all angles. And we felt that if we had more, or I felt that if we had 
more, we could not bring them up properly and nurture them and care for them 
the way they should have been cared for." 
</P>
<P>
Using the pseudonym "Cecile," Beulah appeared on the talk show with a 
representative of the National Abortion Rights Action League and the leader of 
Operation Rescue, an anti-abortion group that stages protests at abortion 
clinics. Operation Rescue members try to prevent women scheduled for abortions 
from entering the clinics. 
</P>
<P>
"It's those who tend to be poor or low income who are hit" when access to 
abortion is limited, said Judy Epstein, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood, a 
nonprofit health agency. "The people who are wealthier can pretty much find a 
way to have it handled." 
</P>
<P>
Beulah said she worries about the position the Supreme Court might take on the 
Missouri statute. As a volunteer at Harlem Hospital, she cares for babies 
abandoned by their parents. 
</P>
<P>
"The babies just languish in the hospital," Beulah said. "They don't get 
adopted, and they don't get foster care."

THATCHER TARGETS BRITISH HEALTH SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN JOHNSON, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With plans for sweeping changes in Britain's free health system, Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher's free-market revolution has reached a national institution 
as sacrosanct as the royal family. 
</P>
<P>
After years of increasing spending on an ever-more costly ideal of free and 
equal treatment for all 56 million Britons, Thatcher recently announced the 
most radical shake-up of the National Health Service since its foundation 40 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The health service will remain free to the customers. But the prime minister's 
plan is to create an "internal market" in state medicine by 1991, with a price 
on everything from aspirin to a heart transplant. Doctors and hospitals will 
compete for state-funded fees. 
</P>
<P>
The 320 biggest hospitals will be able to become self-governing, setting 
individual pay scales and wooing private and state patients. Patients over age 
60, the biggest burden on the state health service, will get tax breaks for 
having private insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"The National Health Service will continue to be available to all, regardless 
of income, and to be financed mainly out of general taxation," said Thatcher. 
"We aim to extend patient choice . . . and to secure the best value for money." 
</P>
<P>
The system Thatcher envisions is a far cry from the mainly private U.S. system, 
widely perceived in Britain as a recipe for greed and wastefulness and one that 
dumps the poor and chronically ill in substandard public hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
But critics on the left charge that her proposals are the first step down a 
favorite Thatcher road: privatization. 
</P>
<P>
In the nearly 10 years since Thatcher won power, her front-line targets have 
been the bureaucracies and the vested interests of the left. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, the National Health Service, with 1 million employees treating 
30 million people a year, kept growing. The cost has soared by a third to $37.8 
billion since 1979 -- always trailing demands for ever-more expensive drugs and 
sophisticated surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Every working Briton has to pay 10% of his salary toward the state health and 
pension plan, and 90% of the people -- not including Thatcher -- use the state 
service as opposed to private doctors and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Most Britons suspect that Thatcher would like to dismantle the system, the 
cornerstone of the welfare state. 
</P>
<P>
The prime minister ordered the review of the health system a year ago in an 
effort to break the cycle of spending money and earning political criticism 
from a service in which children die waiting for heart surgery and nurses are 
driven to pay strikes. 
</P>
<P>
The new proposals are virtually certain of implementation because of Thatcher's 
big majority in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition Labor Party said the plan reflects a Conservative Party 
government that "will always put a healthy balance sheet before healthy 
patients." 
</P>
<P>
The country's major health union calls it a "charter . . . (for) a commercial 
circus," and the doctors' organization, the British Medical Assn., also 
expressed doubts. 
</P>
<P>
The government says the plan will increase efficiency and cut waiting lists. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want the health service run as a business," argued Health Secretary 
Kenneth Clarke, on a nationwide tour to sell the plan. "I just want it to be 
more businesslike." 
</P>
<P>
This means taking a closer look at the performances of family doctors and 
consultants. 
</P>
<P>
Consultants, who get about $87,500 a year from the health service, will be 
monitored on whether they are neglecting state commitments to treat private 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
Salaries of the 32,500 state-employed general practitioners, now earning an 
average $47,000 a year more or less irrespective of competence, will be more 
closely related to the number of patients on their books. 
</P>
<P>
Big practices will get budgets to buy hospital treatment at the best price. 
Doctors will be fined for prescribing drugs too readily.

FALLING EUROPEAN BIRTH RATE IS NEW PROBLEM FOR NATO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. WIELAARD, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CASTEAU, Belgium 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is facing a manpower shortage because of 
falling birth rates in its 16 member nations. 
</P>
<P>
One remedy, officials here at NATO headquarters say, is the talks with the 
Soviet-led East Bloc in Vienna, which could bring an accord on reducing troops 
and conventional arms in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Institute for Defense Analysis has forecast that by the year 2000, 
NATO members will see an average 12.4% drop in draft-age males while there will 
be a 15.2% increase among the seven Warsaw Pact nations. 
</P>
<P>
One reason is what the West Germans call the pillenknick (pill dip), a falling 
birth rate due to greater use of the birth control pill in recent decades. 
</P>
<P>
According to statistics supplied by the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers, 
Europe, the problem is most acute in West Germany, whose supply of draft-age 
males will decline 45% from 1985 to 2000. 
</P>
<P>
In that same period, the statistics indicated, the Netherlands will see a drop 
in males in the 18-to-24 age group of 30%, followed by Belgium, 27%; Britain 
and Luxembourg, 25% each; Italy, 23%; Denmark, 17%; France, 13%, and Portugal, 
9%. 
</P>
<P>
Greece's supply of draftable males will remain even over the next decade. Only 
Turkey expects an increase. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. armed forces also face a declining manpower base. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, 2.2 million Americans were old enough to sign up for military service. 
This fell to 1.9 million last year and will dip to 1.6 million by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
To maintain adequate defenses, NATO is considering improving the combat role of 
reserve forces, possibly by amending the way they are deployed in times of 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"The need to tap this potential has taken on a new urgency," said Gen. John 
Akehurst, the deputy supreme allied commander in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In wartime, under present plans NATO forces would include 5 million people, 
half of them reserves or volunteer citizen-soldiers whose key wartime task 
would be to provide logistical support for combat troops. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has begun strengthening its military reserves. Since 1980, 
their numbers have increased from 1.4 million to 1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany also has begun doubling the number of reservists for military 
excercises, but with mixed results: in 1985, a third of its reservists never 
showed up for their service. 
</P>
<P>
Reservists do not enjoy equal prestige in all allied nations, and there are a 
variety of rules regarding their function. 
</P>
<P>
"The education and training periods are different, the time a country is really 
going to use its reservists, i.e. keep them trained and keep them on the list 
for active duty, is different," one NATO official said. 
</P>
<P>
"As a result, there is a large pool of reserves . . . not trained to the extent 
required." 
</P>
<P>
The increased use of reserves would offset the effect of falling birth rates, 
but the "graying" of NATO populations also will reduce the ranks of reserves. 
</P>
<P>
This is already evident in West Germany, which has 1.6 million reservists but 
will have only 1 million by the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Finding enough manpower poses special problems for the volunteer armed forces 
of Britain, the United States and Canada, which compete with private industry 
for a shrinking pool of personnel.

COLLEGES TACKLE INCREASE IN RACISM ON CAMPUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEB RIECHMANN, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In February, amid two weeks of protests against racial incidents at Penn State 
University, a young white man grabbed a black student by the arm and punched 
her in the eye. "Why don't you protest this," he told her. 
</P>
<P>
During the last two years, 160 U.S. colleges have reported incidents aimed at 
black, Latino, Asian and homosexual students and faculty members, said Howard 
J. Uhrlich of the National Institute Against Prejudice and Violence. 
</P>
<P>
"Between 20% and 25% of all minority students on campus have been victimized at 
least once during an academic year," Uhrlich said, citing incidents of verbal 
harassment, cross-burnings, hate literature, beatings, brawls, anti-homosexual 
graffiti, swastikas and racially motivated slurs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grew Up in Suburbs 
</P>
<P>
"The heart of the problem for many large campuses like ours is that a majority 
of our white students grew up in suburban areas or small communities. They have 
had no positive experiences with minorities," said Grant Ingle, acting director 
of human relations at the University of Massachusetts, where an argument over 
the 1986 World Series erupted into a racial brawl. 
</P>
<P>
Pressured by student minority groups, colleges increasingly are naming provosts 
for minority affairs, recruiting and retaining more non-white teachers and 
creating programs to improve interracial understanding. 
</P>
<P>
* A mini-course, titled "Race and Rutgers," began this semester to review race 
relations at the New Jersey university since the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
* William Chace, president of Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., sent 
students a letter about racial relations on campus and the film "Mississippi 
Burning" about the 1964 murders of civil rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
* Stanford University President Donald Kennedy reported in February on an 
incident in which two students were barred from campus housing for two quarters 
for drawing caricatures of a black on a Beethoven poster and leaving it near a 
black student's door. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Studies Requirement 
</P>
<P>
* At the University of Wisconsin, 88% of freshmen this fall will have to 
fulfill a new ethnic studies credit requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Some minority students, calling attention to the issue with protests and 
sit-ins, have labeled these efforts window dressing. They charge that colleges 
have not responded quickly enough and have not set stiff enough penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Other critics question the administrators' commitment to diversity. 
</P>
<P>
"Some universities have created a (minority affairs) office or program and say 
they solved the problem. I see on many campuses where the minority affairs 
officer doesn't have any power," said Reginald Wilson, senior scholar at the 
American Council on Education in Washington, D. C. 
</P>
<P>
"Yet when you ask people on campus who is responsible, they point to that 
person," Wilson said. "Generally, the colleges that seem to be responding, 
unfortunately, are the ones where something has happened." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tougher Conduct Code 
</P>
<P>
Since the October, 1986, World Series brawl at the University of Massachusetts, 
the school has instituted a tougher conduct code that more clearly defines what 
disciplinary action can be taken. It also has reinstated a freshman orientation 
program that encourages racial harmony. 
</P>
<P>
"Our World Series event was the most visible major racial clash on a U.S. 
campus. I think we've been forced to do more in response than others," said 
James Langley, an associate vice chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
Today's students "did not live through the civil rights movement. Some don't 
know the significance of Martin Luther King Jr. Some don't even know who he 
was," Langley said. Despite efforts to recruit minorities and to keep the issue 
in the forefront, "We have a situation that needs close watching. This campus 
is not settled. It's not calm," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This university has not had any true commitment to diversity," said Traci 
Davis, 20, of Springfield, Mass., a member of a minority-rights group on the 
Amherst campus. She said the university needs to redouble its efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State a year ago hung at its 22 campuses posters proclaiming that "Racism 
Has No Place at Penn State." The posters, which bore telephone numbers for 
reporting incidents, were a way for the university to acknowledge that some 
people thought racism was a problem on campus, said Patricia Peterson, 
assistant vice president for campus life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Black Women Accosted 
</P>
<P>
Black students, who said five black women were accosted by whites as they 
walked downtown near the campus, demonstrated in February. Chanting "Racism no! 
Racism must go!" they demanded harsher penalties for racist acts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Surface Changes' 
</P>
<P>
"Right now (administrators) are doing surface changes," said Yvette Dudley, 
president of the NAACP chapter at Penn State. "They say they are open to 
changes, but we haven't seen any structural changes." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a year after the Madison Plan, a blueprint for increasing minority 
participation, was begun on the University of Wisconsin campus, the 
Interfraternity Council expelled a fraternity in November for incidents that 
included a slave auction in which pledges in blackface and Afro wigs mimicked 
contemporary black entertainers. The action came a week after a university 
committee announced it could not punish the fraternity.

BEAUTY QUEST TOUCHES OFF A GOLD MASSAGE IN JAPAN 
</P>

<P>
Want your skin to have that golden glow? Get it massaged with the precious 
metal. 
</P>
<P>
"With its rich, bright shine, gold offers smoother skin than any massage 
cream," said the manager of a beauty salon in Osaka, western Japan, which 
offers gold massage. 
</P>
<P>
Japan is now one of the world's largest importers of gold, largely due to a 
growing demand among newly affluent Japanese for all things golden. 
</P>
<P>
Some Japanese sushi bars offer the rice and raw fish delicacy with thin gold 
belts wrapped around it. Others offer dried seasoning with gold in it to 
sprinkle on noodles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Golden Sake 
</P>
<P>
Some sell sake with small pieces of gold floating in it. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese have a long history of eating gold -- they think it's good for the 
health. 
</P>
<P>
The full "Goldfinger" body treatment at the Osaka clinic, which takes about an 
hour, costs $230, while a facial massage is $60 -- more than double the prices 
for normal massages. 
</P>
<P>
"It stimulates blood circulation much more than any other massage cream and 
eventually makes the skin shine more than regular cream massages can," a 
beautician at the clinic says. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic uses about a handful of ultra-thin gold foil sheets for each full 
body massage. All of the gold is absorbed into the skin, the manager says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demand Is Growing 
</P>
<P>
Despite the high price, demand for the service is growing. 
</P>
<P>
"An average of one customer a day shows up for a gold massage. Business has 
been going well," she said, adding that quite a few customers return at least 
once a month. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic said it has received several inquiries about the service from men 
but has had to turn them down. 
</P>
<P>
"Our clinic is not large enough to have separate rooms for men and women," the 
spokeswoman said. "We have to refuse men because customers must be naked for a 
session." 
</P>
<P>
One woman who requested anonymity said she had tried the gold massage and felt 
her skin was smoother after the treatment. But, she added, she could not afford 
the treatment again. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mental Benefits Stressed 
</P>
<P>
A doctor specializing in dermatology who declined to be identified said the 
positive effects of such treatment are likely to be more mental than physical. 
</P>
<P>
"All one can get from this kind of massage is psychological satisfaction, no 
physical benefits at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Gold is one of those materials that is nearly impossible to absorb. From that 
point of view, I can see no medical merit in a gold massage." 
</P>
<P>
He added that as long as the gold is pure, no skin problems should result from 
the treatment. However, if it contains lead or zinc, some customers could 
suffer allergic reactions.

'BATTERED SON' DEFENSE LIKELY IN FATAL BEATING OF VALEDICTORIAN'S MOTHER 
</P>

<P>
To his valedictory address to the LaSalle High School Class of 1988, Billy 
Shrubsall added a tribute to his mother, Marianne (Marge) Shrubsall: 
</P>
<P>
"On a personal note, I would like to thank my mother, who taught me my reach 
should exceed my grasp. Thank you, Mom." 
</P>
<P>
The words of gratitude to a mother who pushed a son toward academic excellence 
were never spoken, however. Just 12 hours before he was to give the speech, 
police say, Shrubsall bludgeoned her to death with a baseball bat. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of crowning a high school career that brought him to the top of a class 
of 250, Shrubsall found himself in jail, charged with second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
And this city, known for spectacular waterfalls, found itself trying to 
understand what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
"When I heard, the first thing I said was, 'No way; it wasn't Bill,' " said 
Billy Hartman, a classmate who knew Shrubsall for six years. "It still doesn't 
seem true to me now." 
</P>
<P>
Another friend, Terry Adamec, added: "He had everything going for him. A class 
valedictorian wouldn't do something like that. He was the smartest guy in the 
whole school." 
</P>
<P>
When the case comes to trial, probably this summer, defense attorney Paul G. 
Cleary won't deny that Shrubsall clubbed his mother several times with a 
baseball bat in the early morning hours of June 25, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Although an automatic plea of innocent has been entered, Cleary will likely 
reprise a defense he used successfully in another highly publicized case in 
nearby Allegany County several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
That client, Leslie Emick, was convicted of second-degree manslaughter for 
shooting her common-law husband while he slept in the family motor home. 
</P>
<P>
Cleary argued that she was a "battered wife" who had finally snapped after 
years of brutal sexual torture. 
</P>
<P>
"The 'battered woman syndrome' applies also to other types of violence or abuse 
within a household," Cleary maintains. The scenario, he says, is physical 
and-or mental domination "in which the abusee develops almost a total 
dependence on the abuser." 
</P>
<P>
The Shrubsall case has elements of both physical and mental domination, Cleary 
says. Although Shrubsall is a sturdy six-footer, his mother outweighed him by 
more than 100 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence of mental domination is clearer. Marge Shrubsall was always a 
strict authority figure in the home, according to friends, and she became even 
more so after the death of her husband, William, three years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Her goal for her son was academic excellence. 
</P>
<P>
"We all knew how the mother pushed him," said a neighbor, Tony Kobler. "She 
expected him to be a whiz-bang." 
</P>
<P>
Cleary would not permit Shrubsall to talk with a reporter, but in a statement 
he gave police following the killing, Shrubsall said he had begun to rebel 
against his mother's strict house rules and she had responded with violence. 
</P>
<P>
"The more you so-call brow-beat her, the more you argue your point, the worse 
she gets, until she gets to the point where she starts to hit me, and I mean I 
have been hit several times," he told police. "Her hits ranged from slaps to 
backhands." 
</P>
<P>
David Zacher, a friend of Shrubsall's since junior high school, said, "He had 
bruises on his arms and I never really thought about it much." 
</P>
<P>
The situation grew more tense when Shrubsall entered his first serious romantic 
relationship, with 15-year-old Gretchen Rowe. Marge Shrubsall was not happy 
about it, according to a statement Rowe gave police. 
</P>
<P>
"She has also accused him of loving me more than her, but that's wrong, because 
he did love his mother very much," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The night before the commencement, Shrubsall was at Rowe's house. Told to be 
home by midnight, he was late after going back to retrieve some things he'd 
left at the girl's house. 
</P>
<P>
Marge Shrubsall was in her car in the driveway ready to drive to the Rowe house 
to get her son when he arrived, according to his statement to police. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the house, a heated argument ensued. Marge Shrubsall called Rowe "a 
slut" and him "slime," according to Shrubsall's statement. She started to phone 
Rowe to demand that the two end their relationship. When Shrubsall tried to 
stop her, she elbowed him and he pushed back. 
</P>
<P>
Shrubsall told police his mother then threatened to kill him and backed him 
down a hallway. 
</P>
<P>
Feeling she was going to strangle him, Shrubsall said he "turned around and 
picked up the first thing and I hit her a lot of times. So many times out of 
fear, and then, after that, I don't know. I was genuinely scared and I was 
protecting myself." 
</P>
<P>
Cleary said that while others might have fled the situation, state law "does 
not impose upon a person the duty to retreat when confronted with a threatening 
situation in his or her own home." 
</P>
<P>
Niagara County District Attorney Peter Broderick, whose office will prosecute 
the case, doesn't think that a defense patterned after the Emick case will 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"I would think that's an awfully tough defense to establish, even in a spousal 
situation, never mind a mother and son," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick called Shrubsall's statement to police "loaded with self-serving 
declarations." He said he could see "a lot of background circumstances which 
probably dictated (Shrubsall's) conduct," but that they are not enough to 
justify his actions. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides said there has been no attempt at plea-bargaining, but second-degree 
manslaughter was added in a second grand jury indictment, perhaps to set up a 
lesser charge to which Shrubsall might plead guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick said that a plea bargain is discussed in almost every case, but 
added: "Frankly, I have a lot of difficulty with that at this point." He said 
that a manslaughter plea would make Shrubsall eligible for youthful-offender 
status, "and that minimizes the penalties significantly. The maximum then 
becomes nine years (in prison) as opposed to 25." 
</P>
<P>
Broderick said he also realizes the problems of trying a defendant who even the 
police have called an all-American type. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it's easy, it's clear-cut," said Broderick. "A lot of times it's not 
very easy, and in this case, it's difficult."

M. B. (MICKEY) FINN; POLICE BEAT LED TO RANCH FOR BOYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marshall B. (Mickey) Finn, the handsome and athletic policeman who grew weary 
of seeing the youngsters on his beat spend their days in idle mischief and gave 
them first a club and then a ranch where they could become productive, has 
died. 
</P>
<P>
The retired Los Angeles police officer, sheriff's corrections officer and 
one-time stunt man and actor was 70 when he dropped dead Thursday while walking 
a horse near his retirement home in Rancho Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Millie, said doctors had told her that he suffered a massive heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
Fittingly, she added, he was working with some youngsters at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Finn became a minor legend in postwar Los Angeles, soon after he was discharged 
from the Army. He was the son and brother of LAPD officers and gravitated 
easily to police work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lacked Purpose, Hope 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot, 3-inch, 200-pound rookie cop was assigned a beat in downtown Los 
Angeles. There he found an ethnic mix of impoverished parents whose children 
were in school spasmodically, if at all, and who because of that lacked purpose 
and hope. 
</P>
<P>
Wanting to make a difference, he rented a truck one hot summer day, drove it 
through his district and loaded it with some curious and bewildered Latino 
boys. He hauled them to Santa Monica, where they swam and had a barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
Within two weeks he had formed a police-sponsored Boy Scout troop with his 
Latin beachboys. To them he added some Oriental kids he found hanging around 
New Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
With limited personal funds and some help from the department, he next formed a 
Sea Scout troop. The Police Department set aside a cell in the abandoned 
Central Jail for meetings, and Finn and his kids rigged it with hammocks and 
other seagoing gear. There they planned how they were to remodel a 40-foot Navy 
landing craft that had been donated to them, getting it ready for sea duty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sought Recreation Hall 
</P>
<P>
Finn next formed a Chinese youth organization for both boys and girls, and they 
staged fund-raising dances while they sought a permanent recreation hall that 
would house all of Finn's young friends. 
</P>
<P>
That was born within a year or so as the Mickey Finn Youth Foundation at 215 
1/2 S. Spring St. 
</P>
<P>
There members of such old-time gangs as the Hope Street Boys, the Court Hill 
and Bunker Hill gangs and the Alpine and Bartlett Social Clubs came together to 
mingle around a blaring jukebox while Finn stood by proudly. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood helped, particularly actress Ann Sheridan, who helped finance summer 
camperships and became a regular hostess. 
</P>
<P>
The club proved such a success (eventually there were 300 members) that Finn's 
reach came to exceed his grasp. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Started a Ranch 
</P>
<P>
He quit the department in 1954 to start a ranch near Idyllwild in the San 
Jacinto mountains, taking some of his kids to a newly acquired, 160-acre site. 
There he provided overnight pack trips, hiking, crafts and a swimming hole. 
</P>
<P>
"I got tired of seeing the kids roam the streets," he said in an interview as 
they were loading the truck that took them away. "I wanted to get them away 
from the city where they will be too busy to get into trouble." 
</P>
<P>
But, his wife said Friday, the donations that had sustained his club were not 
enough to maintain the ranch and they eventually had to sell what they had. 
</P>
<P>
Finn joined the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department as a corrections officer and 
then turned to stunt work and acting in films, where he had several minor 
roles. He eventually retired from the Sheriff's Department on a disability. 
</P>
<P>
"I need to get these kids across the tracks," Finn used to say to whoever would 
listen. "Far away across the tracks." 
</P>
<P>
Besides his wife, he is survived by his mother, two sons, a daughter and two 
grandchildren.

LEONIDAS DUDAREW-OSSETYNSKI, 78; POLISH-BORN WRITER, DIRECTOR, ACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leonidas Dudarew-Ossetynski, an internationally known drama teacher, writer, 
director and actor, died Friday at West Los Angeles Veterans Hospital. He was 
78 and had been battling cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Dudarew-Ossetynski, a native of Poland and a graduate of the National Academy 
of Drama in Warsaw, came to this country in 1941 after service in the Polish 
army in France. In Los Angeles, he worked with famed actor-director Michael 
Chekhov, co-authoring the book, "To the Actor" and teaching the Chekhov Method 
to drama students here. 
</P>
<P>
On his own, he established the Ossetynski Actors Laboratory on Melrose Avenue. 
From there, he trained hundreds of students, many of whom went on to work in 
film and television. Among his productions was "Matka," which he staged in 1983 
at the Cast at the Safe Harbor theater. The production received 11 awards. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Dudarew-Ossetynski performed on stages throughout the United States 
and Canada and directed several Off Broadway plays in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Dudarew-Ossetynski was a featured actor in "Walk Don't Run," "The Man in the 
Glass Booth" and "Alias Mike Fury." He also was seen in many episodic 
television shows playing a variety of foreign characters. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by a daughter, Valerie Hunken, and two granddaughters. A Mass 
will be said at Blessed Sacrament Church in Hollywood at 10 a.m. Tuesday. He 
will be buried in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
In lieu of flowers, the family suggests contributions to the American Cancer 
Society.

AFRICA FACES ALARMING NEW PARADOX: RECORD HARVESTS, RECORD HUNGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT M. PRESS, Christian Science Monitor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Much of Africa will have above average or even record harvests this year, as it 
did last year. But many Africans are still going hungry. 
</P>
<P>
The surge in food production, due chiefly to improved weather conditions, 
highlights what one World Bank official describes as the paradox of "full 
silos, empty stomachs." 
</P>
<P>
Big harvests are not helping poorly paid or jobless city residents who cannot 
afford to buy enough food, even if prices fall slightly. And in rural areas, 
many small farmers who cannot grow enough for their families lack the money to 
buy extra food. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, even as many experts seek ways to further boost Africa's food production, 
a smaller number are looking for ways to boost incomes to help the hungry poor 
afford decent diets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consumption Declining 
</P>
<P>
According to the World Bank, nearly one-fourth of Africa's population -- more 
than 100 million people -- do not get enough to eat. Food consumption per 
person has been declining for most Africans since 1980, the bank says. 
</P>
<P>
Large-scale famine continues in southern Sudan, due to a five-year civil war. 
War also hampers farm production in at least three other countries -- Angola, 
Mozambique, and Ethiopia. 
</P>
<P>
But elsewhere, "The basic part of hunger (in Africa) is an income problem," 
says G. Edward Schuh, a former economic aide to Presidents Gerald R. Ford and 
Jimmy Carter, and ex-World Bank director of agriculture and rural development. 
"It's basically a poverty problem." 
</P>
<P>
There is a growing recognition among experts of a poverty-hunger link. In a 
recent issue of the publication Africa Report, World Bank vice-president for 
Africa, Edward Jaycox, said: "Hunger is not mainly caused by transitory 
droughts or crop failures or interruptions in the market. . . . Rather, chronic 
food insecurity is caused by poverty. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Income Declining 
</P>
<P>
Per capita income has been declining in Africa for several decades, falling by 
25% since 1980, Jaycox says. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot treat the hunger problem as (only) a food supply problem," says 
Sholom Reutlinger, a World Bank official. 
</P>
<P>
World Bank President Barber Conable has called for more efforts to help the 
poor afford more food. But for now, most World Bank and other aid efforts 
remain directed at boosting food production rather than income. 
</P>
<P>
Diverting more international and African attention to incomes will not be easy, 
Reutlinger says. Larger farmers and equipment manufacturers push to keep the 
focus on increasing crop production. And donors and African bureaucracies are 
long accustomed to such a focus, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Reutlinger and other specialists interviewed support efforts to boost food 
production. But, they say, with the improved harvests, now is a good time to 
try harder to find ways to help more people afford the food already available 
in their countries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Programs Urged 
</P>
<P>
They call for such programs as: 
</P>
<P>
* Hiring small farmers in the off-season to build rural roads and bridges and 
paying them with vouchers that can be exchanged for food. 
</P>
<P>
Malawi has begun such a program, and the World Bank is considering helping fund 
it. If such programs are not run during the slack farming season, however, they 
may pull farmers away from regular farm work, one expert says. 
</P>
<P>
*Paying rural children with food for each week of school they attend. 
</P>
<P>
This would help many families by reducing their expenses on food, and would 
encourage school attendance, says Schuh, now dean of the Humphrey Institute of 
Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota. A few programs like this have 
been launched in schools in India, but he is not aware of any in Africa, Schuh 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Schuh says the more common types of aid to farmers also help feed the poor. For 
example, assisting export-crop farmers through government programs such as 
credit and improved roads often leads to their hiring more labor, giving the 
laborers more income. 
</P>
<P>
And government aid to farmers growing staple food crops also helps the poor by 
reducing food prices, he adds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inadequate Storage 
</P>
<P>
The challenge in Africa this year is what to do with the bumper crops already 
in or expected. Storage facilities in most countries are inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
Where storage is available, Reutlinger suggests that the local governments buy 
the surplus and use it to pay for work projects carried out by the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Schuh says countries should export what they cannot use or sell, and save 
the foreign exchange that is earned to import food during lean years. 
Cumbersome as that may sound, it would avoid losses of food in storage to 
rodents and insects, he says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Potential for Growth 
</P>
<P>
Africa has the potential to produce enough food for its people, says Curtis 
Farrar, a World Bank expert on agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
And although he acknowledges that a continuing high population growth rate -- 
Africa's is the highest in the world -- could offset production increases, 
Farrar says the growth rate is almost certain to slow. It will slow as incomes 
and education rise along with urbanization and couples have fewer children. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts are not so optimistic. Family planning programs in Africa have 
made some progress but no major gains so far. 
</P>
<P>
Farrar is executive secretary of the World Bank's Consultative Group on 
International Agricultural Research, which has several research centers in 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Dominant Crop 
</P>
<P>
No "green revolution" is likely to happen in Africa the way it did in Asia in 
the 1960s, Farrar says. Africa lacks the kind of single dominant crop that Asia 
(rice) had, he explains. 
</P>
<P>
But some crops are showing major potential. Sorghum production has doubled in 
some parts in recent years, and has more potential. Local crops such as cow 
peas are also showing significant promise, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Improved corn seed has tripled yields in Ghana, Zimbabwe, and Kenya, says 
Michael Cowlinson, a social scientist at CGIAR headquarters in Washington. Such 
increases have been accompanied by more effective use of fertilizers, better 
planting methods, and local research, he says. 
</P>
<P>
But Farrar and Cowlinson point to a weak link in efforts to boost food 
production: In most of Africa, long-range research is inadequate. They also 
cite lack of focus and coordination among donor nations aiding agricultural 
production efforts.

CHARTERS OFFER DAY TRIPS TO ATLANTIC CITY CASINOS; 
</P>
<P>
ONCE A MONTH, SERIOUS GAMBLERS FLYING HIGH 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tony Cassiani, a retired recreational therapist with a cool grand in his 
pocket, parlayed his winnings at a West Virginia dog track into a one-day, 
round-trip jetliner joy ride to the craps tables in Atlantic City, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Linda, an Ohio factory worker unemployed for four months, flew to the Boardwalk 
with $480 in her purse, hoping a hot streak at the slot machines would finance 
a trip to "the better casinos" in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
They were among the 90 serious gamblers and dreamers of fortune from the 
Pittsburgh area who recently invested $119 in a 300-mile chartered flight to 
Atlantic City's gaming tables and slot machines. They were deposited back in 
Pittsburgh some 15 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
Gamblers like those aboard the Emerald Air DC-9 have helped turn the 
once-moribund seashore resort into the nation's most popular recreational 
destination. 
</P>
<P>
Atlantic City, with 12 casino hotels, attracted 33.1 million visitors last 
year, most of them repeat day-trippers who gambled, according to the New Jersey 
Expressway Authority. Only 1.3% of the visitors arrived by air. Most came in 
cars or buses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Repeat Trip 
</P>
<P>
The passengers aboard the recent gambling flight from Pittsburgh were given $20 
in coins after they were dropped off at a Boardwalk casino hotel, and a voucher 
good for $10 more if they repeated the trip within two months. 
</P>
<P>
"One day's enough. I figure if I can't get lucky in one day, that's it," said 
Cassiani, 65, of nearby Carnegie. "You can go through a lot of money in three 
days in Atlantic City." 
</P>
<P>
Gamblers like Cassiani lost a total of $2.73 billion in the casino hotels here 
last year, according to the New Jersey Casino Control Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Apex Travel, the suburban Murrysville agency that organized the one-day flight 
from Pittsburgh, runs the trips monthly "and sometimes we turn people away," 
said owner Mary Ann Sood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On the Floor 82 Minutes Later 
</P>
<P>
Agency guides herded the gamblers from the airport waiting room to the 
jetliner. They boarded buses in Atlantic City and were on the casino floor of 
Bally's Park Place just 82 minutes after departure. 
</P>
<P>
All were ready for action. None seemed interested in the beach or Boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
Sood said her clients are under no obligation to gamble, but the promised $20 
is available only from casino cashiers. 
</P>
<P>
Cassiani said his being single and "a good state pension" from his years 
working at a mental hospital allows him to bet on the greyhounds four times a 
week, the horses now and then, the Pennsylvania Lottery for $5 a day and a 
bimonthly flight to Atlantic City or Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Cassiani on this trip shunned Park Place's craps tables for those at Resorts 
International Hotel Casino up the Boardwalk "because they just feel good." 
</P>
<P>
Banking on his experience in back-room games in Pittsburgh, Cassiani bet the 
dice for four hours, riding as much as $40 on a single roll and at one point 
losing $250. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$72 Ahead 
</P>
<P>
On previous trips, Cassiani has lost as much as $500 and has won as much as 
$375. This day, he recovered his $250 and figured he walked away $72 ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"I was lucky. I've been lucky all my life in a lot of things," he said with a 
shrug. "I got my money back and paid my expenses, so I'm satisfied. I really 
had a good time. I only came down here for rest and relaxation." 
</P>
<P>
Linda, 38, of Youngstown, Ohio, asked that her last name not be used. "I guess 
I really shouldn't gamble if I'm not working," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A divorced mother of a 12-year-old girl, Linda plays cards at home with 
girlfriends for $2 a hand, bets the horses occasionally, and plays Ohio Lottery 
numbers with bookies "because the odds are better and they come and get your 
money for you." 
</P>
<P>
In Atlantic City and Las Vegas, she plays slot machines, roulette and blackjack 
with a passion. 
</P>
<P>
"I love gambling," she says. "I just have it in me. I was married in Vegas in 
'76, so that's why I was a loser in love, I guess. 
</P>
<P>
"I still pay my bills. I'm still not in debt, but I'm not working, so I 
shouldn't gamble. I'm not compulsive-compulsive." 
</P>
<P>
On this day Linda intently played quarter, half-dollar and dollar slot 
machines. She treated herself to a $15 prime rib dinner at Caesars Hotel Casino 
and bought $60 worth of souvenir sweat shirts, caps and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Thinking ahead, Linda did not bring her bank credit cards for fear of the 
temptation to get extra money from casino cash machines. 
</P>
<P>
On the flight home, Linda figured her purse was about $280 lighter. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not too bad for all day, is it?" she smiled. "I enjoyed it. I laughed 
with my girlfriends. I had a good time." 
</P>
<P>
The gamblers got some practice while still in the air. En route to Atlantic 
City, they wrote their seat number on a dollar bill for two drawings from a 
paper bag left over from someone's breakfast. The winners each picked up an 
extra $45 for the challenge ahead. 
</P>
<P>
By 9:15 p.m., still eager to play after more than 11 hours, several cursed tour 
guide Donna Auckerman when buses for their homeward journey were a half-hour 
late and they were waiting at curbside. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Time Is Money' 
</P>
<P>
"We could have been up at the tables longer. After all, time is money," one 
young woman grumbled. 
</P>
<P>
When Auckerman announced that their plane would leave two hours late, most 
cheered her and rushed back into Park Place's casino for still more action. 
</P>
<P>
Lottie Kalish, 62, a former supermarket clerk from Carnegie, flies to Atlantic 
City once a month. This time, her bankroll was $500 for the 50-cent slot 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was younger, I'd like to work here," she said, looking out over the 
glitter of Boardwalk and Park Place. "I'd like to give out change or work with 
the slot machines. It looks better than the A &amp; P." 
</P>
<P>
Kalish was $150 ahead at one point, she said, but finally lost $250 for the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"If I went on vacation I'd spend that much, too," she said cheerfully. "I 
really enjoyed it. You can't gamble in your own town, so you have to come to 
Atlantic City. But, oh no, you can never get ahead if you gamble."

TAFT HIGH SCHOOL WINS NATIONAL ACADEMIC SUPER QUIZ 
</P>

<P>
A team of seniors from Taft High School in Woodland Hills defeated 38 other 
schools Saturday to win the nationally televised final event of the U.S. 
Academic Decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
The nine-member Taft team, representing California, scored 25 out of a possible 
30 points to win the Super Quiz, the only event in the contest open to the 
public. In past years, the winner of the Super Quiz has gone on to win the 
national title. 
</P>
<P>
Taft team members cheered and leaped into the air after learning they had won 
the Super Quiz, defeating their chief rival, Texas state champion Deer Park 
High, a suburban Houston school. The Taft team last year finished second in 
both the Super Quiz and the national contest to former Texas champions, J. J. 
Pearce High School of Richardson, a suburb of Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised at how hard it was," said team member Andrew Goodman of the 
battery of seven written tests that led up to the Super Quiz on Saturday. "But 
whatever happens, at least it's all over." 
</P>
<P>
Goodman's team members said that after nine months of study as well as two 
contests to win the Los Angeles County and state titles, they are relieved that 
their academic decathlon obligations are over. 
</P>
<P>
The Taft team must wait until Monday for the announcement of overall winner of 
the academic decathlon by contest officials. The only previous California 
winner was Los Angeles' Marshall High School in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The Super Quiz score is the only one released before tomorrow's awards 
luncheon. The students are competing for $30,000 in scholarship money that will 
be awarded to top scoring individuals. 
</P>
<P>
The other tests in the academic decathlon are in mathematics, geography, fine 
arts, literature, science and economics. Students are also graded on prepared 
and impromptu speeches as well as interviews and essays. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I did well but the math test was impossible," said Taft team member 
Marc Sarti, who was the top scorer among all students competing in the state 
finals last month. 
</P>
<P>
In the Super Quiz, students answered questions for their team in front of about 
300 cheering spectators who packed the gymnasium of the Community College of 
Rhode Island. The event was televised in cities nationwide, including Los 
Angeles, over public TV stations. 
</P>
<P>
The Taft team took an early lead in the 45-question Super Quiz, correctly 
answering the first 22 questions in a row. The team's final tally is based on 
the scores of the top six team members, who were each given five questions and 
could score a possible total of 30 points.

S.D. POLICE ARREST 128 PROTESTING ABORTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego police using "pain compliance" methods arrested 128 anti-abortion 
demonstrators Saturday in a hallway at the Midway Medical Center, where they 
blocked women from entering the offices of a doctor they say performs 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
In a maneuver designed to trick police and counter-demonstrators, the abortion 
protesters picketed quietly outside three other locations in the Hillcrest area 
Saturday morning, allowing patients to enter. Those protesters dispersed just 
before noon. 
</P>
<P>
While police and pro-choice advocates focused on the Hillcrest locations, 
another group of anti-abortion demonstrators converged about 11:45 a.m. in a 
first floor hallway at the Midway center outside the office of Dr. Phillip 
Rand, an obstetrician and gynecologist. The center is next to Sharp Cabrillo 
Hospital in the Loma Portal neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
By the time police and pro-choice counter demonstrators arrived, the 
anti-abortion goup was firmly ensconced inside the medical center hallway. They 
apparently prevented all of Rand's patients from entering Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know. I think that's fairly obvious," said Dave Cohen, a spokesman 
for the San Diego Police Department. "We assumed the demonstration was over, 
but obviously they had planned this." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that after the demonstrators arrived, a woman who had gone to Rand's 
office because she was experiencing a tubal pregnancy had to be escorted on 
foot to the emergency room at Sharp Cabrillo Hospital. "She was very 
distraught," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Through his answering service, Rand said he did not enter the office Saturday 
and had no further comment on the day's events. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego demonstrations were part of a nationwide anti-abortion push 
called "Operation Rescue," which brought hundreds of arrests Saturday in cities 
throughout the country and prompted a large turnout of counter-demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego demonstrators, who call 
</P>
<P>
themselves Project Rescue, are under a federal court injunction won by the 
American Civil Liberties Union ordering them not to block the entrances to the 
clinics and offices. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
117 Arrested 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, 117 people were arrested as they tried to block access to the 
office of a Hillcrest doctor. 
</P>
<P>
There were no federal officials on hand Saturday to enforce the injunction at 
the Midway Medical Center. Instead, about 60 San Diego police officers, acting 
on a complaint from medical center officials, gave the demonstrators at least 
two opportunities to leave, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
"They have been repeatedly told they are in violation of the law," he said. 
"None of them got up and left." 
</P>
<P>
Police then began a tedious process of arresting the demonstrators one-by-one 
and removing them from the building. After several hours, the demonstrators 
agreed to leave in groups of about 20. 
</P>
<P>
Protesters who resisted or went limp were put in "pain-compliance holds," Cohen 
said. Frequently, this involved the use of nunchakus, hard plastic handles with 
nylon rope strung between them. The rope is wrapped around a subject's arms and 
squeezed with the handles to cause pain sufficient to make the person stand up 
and walk on his own. A number of demonstrators left the building walking, but 
groaning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charged With Trespassing 
</P>
<P>
All were charged with trespassing and those who would not walk out on their own 
also were charged with resisting arrest. All 128 arrested were cited and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goals and objectives are always the same, to prevent the killing of unborn 
children," said Sylvia Sullivan, a spokeswoman for Project Rescue. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, about 150 men, women and children from Project Rescue sang 
religious songs and prayed as they paced the sidewalks in front of Womancare 
Clinic at 2850 6th Ave., and the building that houses the offices of Dr. Donald 
G. Byrnes at 3330 3rd Ave. They also picketed another of Rand's offices, at 
3367 4th Ave. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Photos of Fetuses 
</P>
<P>
The anti-abortion protesters displayed photographs of fetuses, while about 40 
counter-demonstrators representing Planned Parenthood and the National 
Organization for Women carried signs and shouted slogans at the Project Rescue 
marchers across the street. 
</P>
<P>
Members of pro-choice groups were waiting with a long net early Saturday as the 
anti-abortion demonstrators arrived at the Womancare offices. The pro-choice 
advocates strung the net in front of the building, closing off a courtyard and 
preventing the demonstrators from getting close to the building entrance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Escorted Women 
</P>
<P>
"Operation Rescue's efforts have totally failed," said Patricia O'Neil, 
associate director of Womancare who, along with about 20 others donned 
fluorescent orange vests and escorted women into the building. O'Neil said the 
clinic saw its normal load of about 40 women Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the anti-abortion demonstrators apparently had not prevented anyone 
from entering the offices at any of the three Hillcrest locations. 
</P>
<P>
"All the babies who were scheduled to die today were, in fact killed," said Dr. 
Robert Barron Jr., a physician who picketed with Project Rescue outside 
Womancare. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-abortion protesters approached women as they stepped out of their cars 
in the near the Hillcrest locations and asked them if they were there to have 
an abortion. Almost immediately, pro-choice "escorts" intervened to help the 
women past the demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Womancare workers tried to pass out condoms to the anti-abortion 
demonstrators.

BRADLEY RETURNS TO HIS ROOTS AMID FINANCIAL INQUIRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY and FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley spent Saturday in the comfort of the neighborhood 
where his political career began, talking with children and knocking on old 
friends' doors. But he refused to answer questions about an investigation into 
city involvement with a bank that hired him as an adviser. 
</P>
<P>
"When the inquiry is over, we will have the facts we need," he told a reporter 
who interviewed him in the Crenshaw District, which he represented in the City 
Council from 1963 until he was elected mayor in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Facing political crisis, Bradley went back to his roots. After praising 
corporations that are financing a tree planting project on Martin Luther King 
Jr. Boulevard in Southwestern Los Angeles, Bradley headed down the street. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The City Still Works' 
</P>
<P>
He stopped at two or three houses of old political supporters, knocked on the 
doors and chatted with the residents, just as he did when he first ran for the 
council. His aides, after weeks of damage control, drew comfort from the signs 
of the mayor's popularity. "It still works, the city still works," said one of 
the aides, who, for the most part, are men and women in their 20s and 30s, 
thrust into a crisis they had not envisioned when they signed on the Bradley 
team. Deputy Mayor Mike Gage, Bradley's main adviser, has been out of the 
country on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, city officials -- and Bradley's lawyers -- prepared for the first 
City Council committee hearing Wednesday on his connection with Far East 
National Bank and his tenure on the board of directors of Valley Federal 
Savings &amp; Loan Assn., for which he was paid up to $24,000 a year. Valley 
Federal had zoning matters before the city while Bradley was on the board. 
</P>
<P>
Sources in the office of City Atty. James K. Hahn, who is in charge of the 
inquiry, said investigators are interviewing some city officials as many as 
eight times for the details of Bradley's relationship with Far East National 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
In coming weeks, sources said, the investigation will broaden to include the 
mayor's involvement with Valley Federal and the Task Force for Africa/Los 
Angeles Relations. That city task force, formed to improve business and 
cultural ties between Los Angeles and Africa, is headed by Juanita St. John, 
with whom Bradley has real estate investments. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Bradley's daughter, Phyllis, worked for the task force as a 
secretary for almost 10 months in 1985 and 1986, according to mayoral press 
aide Bill Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
The furor has erupted around a mayor who has prided himself on never having 
been involved in scandal in a public career that began when he joined the Los 
Angeles Police Department. And it is happening to a man who has always insisted 
on as much privacy as possible about his financial affairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Records Law Invoked 
</P>
<P>
That shield of privacy was broken Friday when Bradley's staff, faced with 
newspaper requests under the California Public Records Act, released documents 
that spelled out Far East National Bank's relations with the city while Bradley 
was serving as a paid adviser. 
</P>
<P>
As the furor developed, Bradley gave back to the bank his $18,000 payment in 
March. He said he had resigned as an adviser in December but had not realized 
until March that the city did business with the bank, so he returned the 
payment to bank Chairman Henry Hwang, with a letter saying he had not realized 
the city had a relationship with the bank. 
</P>
<P>
But the documents appeared to indicate otherwise. They show that Bradley's 
office made inquiries last year to the city treasurer's office and to the Los 
Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency on behalf of Far East, during the time 
Bradley was being paid by the bank. The documents also indicate that Bradley 
knew the city was doing business with the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the documents, and interviews with city officials, also show that 
actions taken by Bradley's office prompted the city treasurer to work more 
closely with the bank. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to returning Far East its money, Bradley also resigned from Valley 
Federal's board of directors. He also created a commission to write a stronger 
ethics code for the city and, on Wednesday, said he was putting his substantial 
stock portfolio and real estate investments in a blind trust. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview in his office this week, Bradley seemed to show the strain of 
having to put his private affairs on public display. 
</P>
<P>
Although his face was impassive, as usual, his voice was so low that it was 
sometimes difficult to hear his response to questions. He managed a joke. When 
he was asked if he liked to play the stock market, he said, "Next thing you'll 
want to know is do I play the horses." 
</P>
<P>
But when he was asked the extent of the holdings to be placed in the blind 
trust, the mayor said, "I couldn't give you any idea, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
He answered many questions with a single syllable reply. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed clear that the decision to create a blind trust was not an easy one. 
"It took some time for it to be settled in my mind about whether or not to do 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he said "we are living in new and different times. At the local level, 
nobody ever thought of the need for a blind trust. I just think in light of the 
times, the question of ethics has been raised all over the world. We in this 
city need to take actions which will reinforce the confidence of people in 
their elected leadership and I think this is one way of doing it. It removes 
all speculation about whether you, by your actions, may influence the success 
or failure of a business you may have invested in."

PROTEST WAS IN WRONG PLACE AT WRONG TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE CALKINS and ROSEMARY SHELTON, Diane Calkins has worked as a volunteer 
at the central shelter since December, 1987, and is a former member of STOP. 
Rosemary Shelton has been a volunteer at the shelter for three years. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last Saturday, Stop Taking Our Pets (STOP) held a demonstration at the central 
San Diego County Animal Shelter to protest the selling of shelter dogs to UC 
San Diego for research. 
</P>
<P>
As members of several animal rights groups, including People for the Ethical 
Treatment of Animals, Friends of County Animal Shelters, Animal Protection 
Institute and the National Anti-Vivisection Society to name a few, we could 
have been expected to join the protesters. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, as shelter volunteers, we found ourselves on the other side of the 
fence -- literally and figuratively. 
</P>
<P>
Although we too are adamantly opposed to any shelter animal being used or 
abused by researchers (or anyone else, for that matter), we were equally 
opposed to this demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
After last year's demonstration, we and other concerned shelter volunteers 
lodged a protest with the organizers of the march. Our concerns were totally 
ignored. 
</P>
<P>
One of those concerns was that the central shelter is the wrong place to hold 
such a demonstration, because no animals are taken from central for research 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Even more important, the decision to contract with UCSD is not made by the 
Department of Animal Control. The Board of Supervisors directs the department 
to sell dogs for research. 
</P>
<P>
Just as the shelter is the wrong place, the timing of the demonstration 
couldn't have been worse. Saturday is our busiest adoption day. This year and 
last we saw potential adopters drive up, see the picketing and drive away -- 
without one of our animals. 
</P>
<P>
Even worse, perhaps, was the interference with people bringing animals into the 
shelter. Leaders of the group boasted that, during last year's demonstration, 
no animals were turned in to animal control. Instead, they claimed that all 
were taken by demonstrators who found them homes. When asked recently if the 
new homes were good homes, one of the leaders replied: "How would I know?" 
</P>
<P>
To some people, any home is a good home. To those of us who see the results of 
neglectful, abusive owners every day, we know animals can suffer fates far 
worse than ending up at the shelter. Shelter staff and volunteers are committed 
to a careful screening of all potential pet adopters. 
</P>
<P>
Another concern is that people who need to relinquish animals are turned away 
by demonstrators. Animals not left at the shelter are far too likely to be 
abandoned to starvation, illness or death on the highway. 
</P>
<P>
Those who did brave the picket lines to relinquish an animal were subjected to 
jeering and abuse. One elderly gentleman had trapped a sick, mange-ridden, 
starving cat in order to prevent its further suffering. The demonstrators 
heaped insults and worse on him, even telling him, "God knows who you are." 
</P>
<P>
People relinquishing animals were not the only ones subjected to verbal abuse. 
One longtime volunteer who always gives up her Saturday morning to exercise 
adoption dogs was accosted by at least six brave demonstrators. They accused 
her of not having the interest of animals at heart, of being responsible for 
taking animals and selling them for research, of killing animals rather than 
saving them. They even questioned her right to wear a Friends of County Animal 
Shelters sweat shirt. 
</P>
<P>
When the shelter closed, soon after this confrontation, we nursed our tension 
headaches and discussed alternatives for STOP to consider. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of demonstrating at the central shelter and disrupting the adoption of 
our animals, we suggest they direct their attention to the decision makers and 
picket the meetings and homes of county supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Better yet, we invite them to join us in the trenches where the real battle to 
save animals is fought. 
</P>
<P>
How hard is it to attend meetings and hold a picket sign for a couple of hours 
a year? Easier we imagine than waking up every night and seeing the frightened 
faces and pleading eyes of the animals we come to know and love. 
</P>
<P>
Shelter volunteers work every day to find suitable homes for these animals and 
to educate the public about responsible pet ownership. With the help of 
additional volunteers, we could come even closer to our goal of emptying the 
kennels of dogs and cats -- thereby leaving nothing for UCSD.

HOUSING MODEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Oceanside City Council is to be commended for its precedent-setting 
decision to provide emergency housing for low-income families in their 
community. Their determination to proceed in the face of considerable hostility 
and misunderstanding on the part of a very vocal opposition is both courageous 
and enlightened. 
</P>
<P>
So staggering are the problems of providing shelter for the homeless that it is 
often easier to avoid taking action altogether, or to resort to inappropriate 
action -- such as calling on the health department to drive migrant workers 
from one encampment to another, without thought of the incredible hardship 
being inflicted on innocent human beings. Instead, Oceanside and the good 
sisters of Mission San Luis Rey, who provided the land, have chosen to light a 
candle in the darkness. May their actions serve as a model for other 
communities in San Diego County, which so far have failed to confront the 
reality of the crisis in housing and the desperate need for practical and 
humane solutions.

Chevron's proposal ("Torrey Pines Research Park Approved," April 13) to skim 
off 2 million cubic yards of soil from the tops of hills and relocate it in 
canyons to build offices to accommodate thousands of employees will generate 
16,000 additional auto trips daily, disturb the habitat of endangered birds and 
destroy acres of valuable coastal sage scrub. All of this to take place in an 
already heavily compacted and trafficked area. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron's well-publicized advertising that it protects tiny blue butterflies, 
eagles and fish fails to mention preserving the well-being of humans. What

GARDENA MEMORIAL MAY BE NEXT TO BAR PARAMEDIC PATIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A wave of threatened closures of hospital emergency rooms in Inglewood and 
Hawthorne to patients who are transported by paramedics could spread to another 
South Bay hospital, this time in Gardena, hospital officials disclosed 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I've tried to hold out as long as possible," Gardena Memorial Hospital 
Administrator Phyllis Van Crombrugghe told a community forum at Inglewood City 
Hall. "The problem must be solved, or our hospital will have to downgrade as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Centinela Hospital Medical Center in Inglewood and Robert F. Kennedy Medical 
Center in Hawthorne recently announced plans to downgrade their emergency 
rooms. They will no longer accept patients delivered by paramedics. Both cite 
major financial losses from treating poor, indigent or uninsured patients. 
</P>
<P>
James D. Grant, director of emergency services at Gardena Memorial, said the 
small for-profit community hospital has seen a 25% increase in emergency room 
patients in the last year as other hospitals have closed their doors to 
paramedics or reached the saturation point. 
</P>
<P>
"We're left as the only emergency room in a very, very large area," Crombrugghe 
said. "It is truly a case of dominoes falling. We're the domino right in the 
line and we can't avoid it. We're a small domino and we can't afford it." 
</P>
<P>
Speaker after speaker at the forum, called by freshman Assemblyman Curtis R. 
Tucker Jr. (D-Inglewood), warned that Los Angeles County's network of trauma 
centers and emergency rooms is falling apart because of financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The emergency medical care system in Los Angeles County is in a state of 
crisis," said Bayliss Yarnell, emergency department director at Daniel Freeman 
Memorial Hospital in Inglewood. "It is a system that is collapsing. . . . The 
certain result of this will be a loss of life and limb." 
</P>
<P>
Yarnell said "the system is simply starving for money." 
</P>
<P>
Timothy D. Wilson, emergency medical services commander for the Los Angeles 
City Fire Department, said the consequences of emergency room closures are 
being felt throughout Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Before the forum, Wilson said he stopped at the scene of a serious traffic 
accident in West Los Angeles and found that paramedics had been trying without 
luck for 15 minutes to find a hospital that would accept the accident victims. 
</P>
<P>
"What is happening out there is not just affecting the citizens of Inglewood, 
East Los Angeles or West Los Angeles," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
He said ambulances are being forced to take patients to more distant hospitals, 
which means longer travel times and longer response times to other paramedic 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
William Delgardo, administrator of the Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew Medical 
Center said that when an accident victim cannot be taken to the nearest trauma 
center, "you increase the potential for mortality. That is a fact, plain and 
simple." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Tucker told the audience that "middle- to lower-income communities 
in our state have lost access to health care" and that "the emergency rooms are 
becoming the primary contact for medical assistance." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blames Governor 
</P>
<P>
Tucker blamed Gov. George Deukmejian for refusing to earmark $330 million for 
health care from an increase in the cigarette tax approved by the voters last 
year. He announced a petition drive aimed at convincing the governor to devote 
the new tax money to health care. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Price Hastings, Los Angeles County Trauma Hospital program chief, said 
the county needs revenues from Proposition 99. "We're banking on that money and 
it has not materialized." 
</P>
<P>
A battle over funding for health care has become a spring ritual in Sacramento 
as legislators and the governor struggle to put together a final budget for the 
fiscal year that begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker said the threatened emergency room closures are not just rhetoric in the 
heat of a budget battle, but a life-and-death matter. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking extremely real here. This is not the regular song and dance," 
Tucker said. "Two years ago, it was burdensome. Last year, it was critical. 
This year, it is catastrophic."

THIS FOOT PATROL STALKS BEAUTY AND SERENITY ON LONG MARCH TO THE SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He would appear in the late afternoon, walking south through the hills toward 
Mulholland Drive -- a man in his early 60s in ordinary street shoes, his head 
covered by a terry cloth cap. 
</P>
<P>
He carried no water, and Jill Swift of Tarzana, coming down the mountain from 
her afternoon hikes, was curious and concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"Where are you bound for?" Swift finally asked one day. Just walking home, he 
replied, to the other side of the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
His name was Chris Clegg, and he was an Englishman who had competed as a race 
walker on three continents. For exercise and diversion, Clegg would hike from 
the San Fernando Valley through the Santa Monica Mountains to Pacific 
Palisades. There were many ways to do it, and he was so familiar with the 
network of fire roads and trails that he sketched his own maps. 
</P>
<P>
Swift, a Sierra Club member, was impressed by this and something else: Clegg 
did not have a car. He came by bus to the Valley to start his hikes and walked 
or rode a bus to his Beverly Hills apartment after reaching the other side. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Unique Outdoor Experience' 
</P>
<P>
"I had never known anybody who did not have a car and was able to get around on 
the mountains this way," Swift recalled. "To me, he epitomized some of the 
things that we're lacking in the Los Angeles area in terms of . . . using 
public transportation and being able to get to some of these natural areas for 
a very unique outdoor experience." 
</P>
<P>
And Swift also thought: "If he can do it, we can do it too." 
</P>
<P>
Swift's meeting with Clegg more than eight years ago inspired the 
"Valley-to-the-Sea" hike, now something of an institution among local hiking 
enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
One Sunday a month, hikers meet at the end of Reseda Boulevard for the trek to 
Pacific Coast Highway, a distance of 10 to 15 miles depending which trails are 
used. And although a few hikers leave cars on the other side, most return to 
the Valley by RTD bus -- as rare an adventure for some as the hike itself. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a destination hike," said Swift, 60, who usually serves as leader. 
"People love to be able to say, 'I've walked from the San Fernando Valley to 
the ocean.' " 
</P>
<P>
"When you tell people, 'I walked from my house, practically, to the ocean' . . 
. I love the reaction," said Ruth Reingold of Woodland Hills. "I mean, they 
didn't know it could be done." 
</P>
<P>
Normally about 25 hikers show up, with others choosing from a smorgasbord of 
hikes the Sierra Club leads in area mountains on Sundays. But to avoid 
competing with volunteer trail building last Sunday at Point Mugu State Park, 
the selection of hikes was limited, creating a heavy turnout for 
"Valley-to-the-Sea." 
</P>
<P>
A mob of 48 hikers showed up last Sunday at the trail head at the end of Reseda 
Boulevard in day packs, lug soles and T-shirts exhorting "Support Your Local 
Cat House" and "Save the Chocolate Mousse." They were from Northridge, 
Chatsworth and Woodland Hills, but also Long Beach, Pico Rivera, Fullerton and 
Costa Mesa. There were college professors, aeronautical engineers and 
homemakers, a bank teller, a real estate salesman, a film projectionist and 
others. And although a majority were in their 40s and 50s, others were in their 
60s or 70s. 
</P>
<P>
Most did not look their age, which one man attributed to hiking. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm actually 150 years old," he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
"And I'm his father," another said, "that's the amazing part." 
</P>
<P>
The group moved out just after 8 a.m., heading south along Fire Road 28. The 
dirt road climbed gently along the floor of Caballero Canyon, past sycamores 
lining the sandy bed of Caballero Creek. In the early morning damp, the land 
was like an herb garden, with the pungent smell of wet sycamore and sage, and 
showy white blossoms, called pearly everlasting, leaving a lemony smell on the 
fingers when touched. 
</P>
<P>
In less than a mile, the road crossed into Topanga State Park, bent sharply 
southeast and climbed steeply to the hard earthen surface of Mulholland Drive. 
In front of the hikers, Rustic Canyon, loaded with dense, green growth, opened 
to the south, while at their backs, Reseda Boulevard etched a line across the 
Valley to the Santa Susana Mountains, rising in pale blue haze to the north. 
</P>
<P>
It was 8:45 a.m., and time for the day's only speech. Swift pointed to a nearby 
ridge that is to be heavily graded for a housing development. "I want you to 
look at that ridge and remember," she said. "When the bulldozers come, please 
don't call me and say, 'Why didn't you do something?' " 
</P>
<P>
Crossing over Mulholland Drive, the hikers turned southwest along the Bent 
Arrow Trail, a rugged footpath clinging precariously to the wall of Rustic 
Canyon. Much of this trail was built by a man who was going through a divorce 
and by another then separating from his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Swift would come up the canyon with sandwiches and drinks and hear them 
pounding away. They had no choice but to cut the trail along a steep slope, 
"with all kinds of impediments to construction, such as rocks, tree stumps, 
poison oak . . . ticks etc.," Swift said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was great therapy," she said. Their need "to work off negative energies is 
quite evident in the construction of that trail." 
</P>
<P>
It may be the sweat and physical exertion, the riot of sights and smells, or 
maybe just the lack of indoor plumbing, but hiking seems to bring out a certain 
earthiness in otherwise proper people. One man stopped along the Bent Arrow 
Trail, announcing as he waved on the last of the women hikers: "Go ahead, I've 
got to water my lily." 
</P>
<P>
About 9:15 a.m, the hikers reached a saddle, a low point between hills, and 
paused briefly in an open meadow knee-high in wild oats. Then they turned south 
onto the Garapito Creek Trail, which corkscrews to the bottom of Garapito 
Canyon, a deep cleft full of bird song and dense, jungle-like greenery. 
</P>
<P>
The trail turned to the southwest as it climbed from the base of the canyon, 
opening up to beautiful views of the summits to the west. Just before 10:45 
a.m., the trail turned onto Chocolate Ridge and reached Eagle Rock, a huge tan 
outcropping of conglomerate rock that, at 1,957 feet above sea level, was the 
highest point on the hike. 
</P>
<P>
Turning down a fire road and then onto the Musch Trail, the group tramped 
through hilly grasslands into the heart of Topanga State Park. Often during 
this season, these meadows are ablaze with color, but this has not been a good 
year for wildflowers. Still, scores of flowers and plants were on display along 
these trails, including: nicotiana, purple filaree, wild mustard, yellow and 
sticky monkey flower, golden yarrow, fireweed, deadly nightshade, mountain 
lilac, wild cucumber, buckwheat, chemise, yucca, morning glory, solanum, showy 
penstemon, lupine, Mariposa lily, prickly phlox, blue-eyed grass, bird vetch, 
wild rose and Chinese houses. 
</P>
<P>
By noon, the hikers had covered seven miles, reaching Trippet Ranch, the area 
of the state park that is accessible by car. Just beyond, they turned onto the 
East Topanga Fire Road, where the ocean came into view. Ascending a narrow neck 
of land dividing Topanga and Santa Ynez canyons, the hikers looked down on a 
study in contrasts: Topanga with its rugged, largely unspoiled green slopes, 
and Santa Ynez, with its red-tiled roofs in cookie-cutter housing tracts. 
</P>
<P>
On another day -- say, of torrential rain or 109-degree heat -- these people 
might have wished they had slept in. But this was a day of brilliant sunshine 
and cool breezes, and a mood closer to rapture. Asked why they go hiking, here 
is what some of them said: 
</P>
<P>
"It's very invigorating. It's a basic thing," said John O'Sullivan of Woodland 
Hills. "You go from point A to point B, and you feel like you've accomplished 
something. And you've done it without a skateboard or turbo power." 
</P>
<P>
"I like the exercise. I like the fresh air. I like the people," said Dave 
Morafka of Los Angeles. "There's a sense of accomplishment in making it to the 
sea. It's sort of impressive to look on a map and see the difference between 
your starting and ending points." 
</P>
<P>
"Every weekend I go on a hike at least 10 miles long," said Doug Demers of 
Canoga Park. "I burn off excess energy from sitting in an office all week . . . 
I like this hike because when I'm done I can soak my feet in the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
"If you're mentally depressed or you have a heartbreak or something that's 
bugging you . . . a good hike just seems to clear your mind," said Reaven 
Barnes of Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
"I hike once a week, and I hike for the beauty," said Cathy Govaller of Pico 
Rivera. "This is my beauty fix . . . Then also there's the camaraderie of 
kindred spirits, all out for the beauty of it." 
</P>
<P>
"I can't get to the Sierra very often, but I have this in my own back yard, and 
I feel very fortunate," said Marcia Ehrlich of Tarzana. "We wear our old 
comfortable clothes . . . and whatever our titles are during the week that our 
jobs bestow on us, we're all people interacting, enjoying the same thing -- 
nature." 
</P>
<P>
"I get out every Sunday. I've taken many 12-, 14-, 16-mile hikes," said Robert 
Shoemake of Northridge. "It changes a person's outlook so much . . . I can get 
home, and I feel like maybe I've been on two or three weeks' vacation." 
</P>
<P>
Said Richard Pardi of Woodland Hills: "That's the purpose of the whole hike: to 
get to Gladstone's" fish restaurant on Pacific Coast Highway "for a cold beer. 
After 15 miles, they're waiting . . . The mug is in the ice. They see me 
coming. They just pour." 
</P>
<P>
About 1:30 p.m., the hikers reached Parker Mesa above Pacific Palisades. To the 
south and east, foam piled up along the beach and boats scooted in front of the 
fog-shrouded hump of the Palos Verdes Peninsula. The Century City skyline stood 
out to the east, with the towers of downtown Los Angeles beyond. 
</P>
<P>
No one would have confused the scene with Yosemite or Alaska, but it was very, 
very nice. In the middle of one of the world's biggest cities, the hikers had 
covered a dozen miles of semi-wild lands, accompanied by bird song and 
astonishingly little trash. Even the austere steel buildings on the horizon did 
not mar the panorama, conveying instead a sense of natural possibilities in the 
heart of urban sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
Turning off the East Topanga Fire Road, the hikers descended steeply through 
dense thickets and a garden of ferns to Los Liones Drive. 
</P>
<P>
A short distance beyond, Pacific Coast Highway served up a rude dose of 
reality. It took a full five minutes for a red light to part the sea of cars 
rushing by at near-freeway speeds. But finally there opened a path to the 
beach, and a chance to dip tired feet in the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
It was a little after 2 p.m. All over Los Angeles, people were coming off the 
back nine, or battling the crowds at shopping malls, or watching the game of 
the week. And 48 hikers were completing a walk from the Valley to the sea.

TAFT WINS U.S. SUPER QUIZ

<P>
Representing California, a team of seniors from Taft High School in Woodland 
Hills defeated 38 other schools Saturday to win the nationally televised final 
event of the U.S. Academic Decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
The nine-member Taft team scored 25 out of a possible 30 points to win the 
Super Quiz, the only event in the contest conducted in front of an audience. In 
past years, the winner of the Super Quiz has gone on to win the national title. 
</P>
<P>
Taft team members cheered and leaped into the air after learning they had won, 
defeating their chief rival, Texas state champion Deer Park High School, a 
suburban Houston school. The Taft team last year finished second, in both the 
Super Quiz and the national contest, to last year's Texas champions, J.J. 
Pearce High School of Richardson, a suburb of Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly Difficult 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised at how hard it was," team member Andrew Goodman said of the 
battery of seven written tests that preceded the Super Quiz on Saturday. "But 
whatever happens, at least it's all over." 
</P>
<P>
The Taft team studied for nine months and won the Los Angeles County and state 
titles before their latest victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It was worth it, but right now it feels like a weight has been lifted off my 
shoulders," team member Deborah Sim said. 
</P>
<P>
The Taft team must wait until Monday for contest officials to announce the 
overall winner of the academic decathlon. The score of the Super Quiz was the 
only one released before Monday's awards luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
The other six tests in the academic decathlon are in mathematics, geography, 
fine arts, literature, science and economics. Students are also graded on 
prepared and impromptu speeches, interviews and essays. 
</P>
<P>
The nine top-scoring students will receive scholarships amounting to $30,000. 
The top three will get $5,000; the next three $3,000, and the last $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I did well, but the math test was impossible," said Taft team member 
Marc Sarti, who was the top scorer among all students competing in the state 
finals last month. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Rosenthal, a Taft parent and one of 30 or so people who accompanied the 
team from Woodland Hills, said he told his son, Andy, "to just play it cool" in 
the Super Quiz. 
</P>
<P>
Students answered questions for their team in front of about 300 cheering 
spectators in the gymnasium of the Community College of Rhode Island. The event 
was televised in cities nationwide, including Los Angeles, over local public 
broadcasting stations. 
</P>
<P>
The Taft team took an early lead in the 45-question Super Quiz, answering the 
first 22 questions in a row correctly. The team's final tally is based on the 
scores of the top six team members, who each were given five questions and who 
could score a total possible of 30 points. 
</P>
<P>
Questions in the Super Quiz were based on the 1988 presidential campaign and 
the history of the U.S. presidency. One question, for example, was: "What is 
the total number of electors in the electoral college?" (Answer: 538.) Another 
asked the students to identify the first vice president who resigned from 
office. (John C. Calhoun.) 
</P>
<P>
The Taft students said Saturday's Super Quiz was more difficult than the one in 
the state contest. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Rapoport said he was very disappointed at missing three of the five 
questions he was asked. "I feel almost guilty; maybe if I had just studied 
another hour," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Rapoport's mother, Yona, said before the quiz Saturday that regardless of

POLO MATCHES RETURN TO EQUIDOME; 
</P>
<P>
VETERINARIANS, EXPERTS DEFEND HORSES' TREATMENT AFTER DEATHS OF 2 PONIES 
</P>

<P>
It was a horrifying scene played twice that night at the weekly polo match at 
the Los Angeles Equestrian Center in Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
Just two minutes into the match between the Los Angeles Stars and a Buenos 
Aires team at the indoor Equidome arena, a chestnut mare named Whisper 
stumbled, breaking a front leg. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, it happened again before the hushed crowd of 2,500. This time a 
bay gelding named Rubio snapped a front leg as he spun around. His rider, a 
prominent Argentine player, sat on the ground, cradled his head in his hands 
and cried as the horse was removed from the arena. 
</P>
<P>
As the game resumed -- with the crowd stunned and the players subdued -- both 
horses, two of the Stars' top mounts, were put to death by veterinarians out of 
view of the spectators. 
</P>
<P>
The tragedy on March 11 cast an even more ominous cloud than usual over the Los 
Angeles Equestrian Center, a facility that at times has faced an uncertain 
future because of financial and legal woes. The horses' deaths raised pointed 
questions about the operation of the center and its treatment of horses. 
</P>
<P>
But polo officials, veterinarians and equine experts defended the equestrian 
center. They said in interviews last week that the center has a commendable 
safety record and is regarded as an outstanding training, boarding and 
exhibition facility. 
</P>
<P>
Recent complaints about the polo club "have been blown way out of proportion," 
said Dr. Madison Richardson, a Los Angeles neurosurgeon who is safety committee 
chairman for a Western polo circuit and a member of the Los Angeles Polo Club. 
"The equestrian center is getting a bum rap." 
</P>
<P>
Some critics had charged that polo ponies at the center were mistreated and 
that polo at the Equidome might be too fast-paced and brutal, endangering both 
horse and rider. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Department of Animal Regulation officials launched an 
investigation. For three days last week, the polo program was in jeopardy as 
officials examined the arena's condition and treatment of the horses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long-Term Investigation 
</P>
<P>
The center was quickly cleared of the accusations. But the mystery lingers 
about what led to the injuries of two horses in one match. A long-range 
investigation into those injuries will continue. 
</P>
<P>
The experts described the accidents as flukes or freak occurrences. While it is 
not uncommon for horses in this rigorous sport to be injured, they said, it is 
uncommon that two horses would be injured in the same way on the same night 
within minutes of each other. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Scherer, executive director of the United States Polo Assn., called the 
deaths "a very unfortunate accident . . . just a happenstance." 
</P>
<P>
He said the association does not keep statistics on horses' injuries and 
deaths. But he added, "It is not a very common thing, nor is it uncommon for 
horses to get hurt. It happens." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, when the center first started holding polo matches, at least six 
horses have died because of injuries suffered in the games, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, when the first match since the deaths was held, avid fans 
who had feared that the sport would be halted instead celebrated its return. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel so happy now because I was so scared it would be shut down," said Mabel 
Dippold, 62, who has attended every center match since 1984. "I know there are 
pros and cons about the sport, but things are really well taken care of here." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Rich, 42, a construction executive, said he has never seen anything 
remotely approaching abuse of the horses and he is glad the games have resumed. 
"I'm relieved it's going on, and I hope people don't get the wrong impression 
about what's happening here," said Rich, who has been attending matches for two 
years. "It's a great sport, and all I see is concern for the animals." 
</P>
<P>
Polo accounts for about 15% of the activities at the equestrian center, which 
sits on 70 acres owned by the city of Los Angeles, officials said. The center 
houses a polo riding school, stables for boarding polo ponies and facilities 
for the Los Angeles Stars' fleet. 
</P>
<P>
Other center activities include horse shows and lessons where members of the 
public can learn other forms of riding, such as dressage and jumping. 
</P>
<P>
The center owns the 27 polo horses used in the Saturday night polo matches, 
which often are attended by movie stars and other entertainment figures. During 
a match, 18 horses are ridden. The players are professionals ranked in the 
United States Arena Polo League and are based locally and in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
The horses are thoroughbreds obtained from private owners or dealers. Some were 
bought from Wyoming cattle ranches, center officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Vince Azzaro, the center's director of polo, and Tom Goodspeed, captain of the 
Los Angeles Stars, test ride the horses to see if they have polo ability before 
they are selected. If a particular horse is chosen, it is then inspected by a 
veterinarian for soundness. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. J. David Wheat, the center's veterinarian, inspects the polo ponies about 
three to four times a week, giving them vaccinations and other types of 
preventive health care. Wheat also cares for Los Angeles Police Department 
horses. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat said the two ponies who were fatally injured were in top physical 
condition and had no history of health problems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Exceptional Equine Athletes' 
</P>
<P>
"They were two of our best horses, with no past instances of lameness or 
anything," he said. "They were both exceptional equine athletes. The accidents 
happened in the first few minutes, so it wasn't because of fatigue that these 
things happened." 
</P>
<P>
He said that in addition to inspections during the week, match horses are 
examined by him before, during and after an exhibition. If a horse has a 
problem or any soreness, that horse doesn't play, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"To put a player on a polo pony that has any sort of injury is taking a 
significant risk," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat makes the final determination. He said he has argued, sometimes bitterly, 
with riders who wanted to mount ponies he did not think were healthy enough to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Walton, a Modesto dermatologist and chairman of the polo 
association's arena committee, said indoor polo is "a young man's game that 
involves more body contact" than outdoor polo. But he denies allegations that 
horses are constantly subjected to injuries by bumping into arena walls. 
</P>
<P>
"Horses have quick reflexes and turn very rapidly," he said. "It is more likely 
that a rider will be thrown into a wall." 
</P>
<P>
Both of the horses injured on March 11 were away from the main action of the 
game when the accidents occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Goodspeed, who was riding Whisper, said he was trying to maneuver the horse 
toward the main action. "I was moving the horse in a slow circle toward the 
ball, and it just took a bad step," said Goodspeed, a top-ranked player. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Holding Lame Leg 
</P>
<P>
Whisper buckled, and Goodspeed fell forward to the ground. When he saw the 
horse in front of him holding up its lame leg, he knew what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
"It's happened to me before, and it's a truly awful thing," he said. "These 
animals are like our friends. We're emotionally attached to them and don't want 
to see them hurt for anything in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Polo players insist that their mounts, which cost from $2,000 to $40,000, are 
far too valuable to be abused. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat said both of the injured ponies broke bones in the lower part of their 
legs. He said horses sometimes break those bones trying to catch themselves 
after taking a bad step. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about a 1,200- pound animal here that's on little legs," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics wonder whether the injured horses might have been saved by the 
technology of modern equine medicine. But owners and veterinarians say that 
while broken bones can be mended, requiring a horse to stand immobile for 
months is not easily accomplished and injuries usually permanently impair the 
animal. 
</P>
<P>
Valiant efforts to save the famed racehorse Ruffian after she shattered her 
foot in a 1975 match race failed when the mare fought violently to scramble to 
her feet after surgery. And the cost of surgery and rehabilitation, which may 
exceed the horse's value, is a consideration, owners said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Severe Injuries Uncommon 
</P>
<P>
"Severe debilitating injuries among polo ponies are relatively uncommon," said 
Dr. Calvin Kobluk, assistant professor of large animal surgery at the 
University of Minnesota and an authority on injuries in performance horses. 
</P>
<P>
"But let's be realistic. They're athletes, and athletes suffer injuries," said 
Kobluk, who conducted a recent survey on racing injuries that was financed by 
the Morris Animal Foundation for the American Assn. of Equine Practitioners. 
</P>
<P>
He said that by far the most dangerous sport for horses is racing, which places 
tremendous stress on the immature limbs of 2- and 3-year-old horses driven at a 
pounding gallop for more than a minute. 
</P>
<P>
Polo ponies are highly trained and highly conditioned performers whose muscular 
bodies are more capable of withstanding physical stress, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance experts place the mortality risk of polo ponies below that of 
racehorses but equal to hunting and jumping, the second most risky equine 
sport. Bob Pringle, a vice president of American Bankers, a leading livestock 
mortality insurer in Florida, said few owners of polo horses insure their 
mounts because the rates are high. Most choose to be self-insured. 
</P>
<P>
The indoor polo games are played in the 3,500-seat Equidome, which is 150 feet 
wide by 300 feet long. The playing surface is a mix of dirt and sand loam that 
is watered, cushioned and smoothed before each game. Azzaro said about two 
inches of cushion on the field is allowed to help the horses pivot. 
</P>
<P>
The 4 1/2-foot Equidome walls are made of concrete blocks. Azzaro said that 
despite the game's intense action, the horses rarely slam into the walls. "A 
horse is smart enough to know where the wall is, and they won't go where they 
don't want to go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Polo games at the Equidome consist of six 5 1/2-minute periods, called 
"chukkers," in which three players on each of two teams attempts to hit a 
rubber ball through a goal with a mallet. A single horse usually plays for one 
chukker, although an exceptionally good mount may play in a second chukker 
after resting for at least two periods, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Horse experts say the Equidome has been used as a model for the design of other 
arenas in the nation and the world. 
</P>
<P>
Outdoor polo is played on a field, usually grass, 160 yards wide and 300 yards 
long -- three times the length of a football field. Each team consists of four 
members and a chukker lasts 7 1/2 minutes. A hard ball is used. 
</P>
<P>
The game consists of much bumping of horses and riders, although strict rules 
prohibit bumps at angles of more than 45 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Polo enthusiasts say that horses in all sporting events are subject to injury. 
George Haas Jr., chairman of the polo association's safety committee, said 
horsemen "do occasionally have to put a horse down. It happens on the race 
track, in the show ring, in every horse-related event I know of." 
</P>
<P>
The experts say indoor polo places horses at no greater risk than outdoor polo 
or a number of other equestrian sporting events. Critics have likened outdoor 
polo to football and indoor polo to ice hockey. 
</P>
<P>
Scherer said the risk may even be greater for players and horses on the 
traditional polo field because the game is played at greater speeds than in the 
arena, increasing the risk of a serious fall. 
</P>
<P>
Sue Sally Hale of Moorpark, a 40-year player, trainer and pioneering woman in 
the sport, is a member of the Los Angeles team. She said critics sometimes 
complain that the horses are thin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Marathon Runners' 
</P>
<P>
"They are marathon runners," she said. "Have you ever seen a fat marathoner? 
They eat twice as much as a show horse and are conditioned and trained every 
day. It breaks our hearts when something happens to one of these horses." 
</P>
<P>
Spectators say they are attracted to arena polo by the sport's action and the 
skill of horses and riders. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles radio personality Michael Jackson and his family often attend the 
Equidome games "because polo is probably more spectacular as a spectator sport 
indoors than out," he said. "Spectators sit right up close to and looking down 
on the horses and riders. I truly believe the horses like it as much as the 
riders." 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood celebrity Johnny Grant said arena polo "is right in your lap. It 
takes two great athletes to make a play in polo, both horse and rider. That's 
exciting to me." 
</P>
<P>
But spectators and horse owners scoff at the idea that the equestrian center 
caters only to the wealthy. "People at the equestrian center are from all walks 
of life," Jackson said. He called the center "80 drug-free acres in Los Angeles 
where whole families are able to recreate together." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Bradley, an equine veterinarian who has been practicing in the San 
Fernando Valley for 26 years and has owned polo horses, said any mount without 
a taste for the game could never be trained to perform. "If those horses didn't 
like the game," he said, "you damn sure wouldn't get them to play it."

HANG GLIDER COMPETITION IN SYLMAR HONORS LEGENDARY 'BIG BIRD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY KAZMIN, Times Staff Writer

<P>
When Debbi Renshaw-Armenta began hang gliding 10 years ago, Jeff Scott was a 
guy she looked up to -- in more ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, 6 feet, 7 inches tall, stood out because of his height and because of 
his stature as a hang glider. He had set a long-distance record, gliding from 
Palmdale to Santa Monica in 1979, and could fly under the most difficult 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the sky god," said Renshaw-Armenta, 33, of Green Valley Lake. "He would 
stay up when nobody else could." 
</P>
<P>
Renshaw-Armenta was one of more than 60 hang gliders who paid tribute to Scott 
on Saturday, the first day of the Jeff Scott Hang Gliding Competition. Scott 
died last September at the age of 32 after a nine-year battle with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Local hang gliders established the four-day competition, which they hope to 
repeat annually, to honor the man who inspired so many of them. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing T-shirts bearing the slogan, "A Guy You Could Look Up To," 40 
competitors launched off Kagel Mountain on Saturday, at an elevation of 3,300 
feet above sea level, for a race along the ridges of the San Gabriel Mountains. 
More than a dozen others made a recreational flight along the same course. 
</P>
<P>
To spectators at the landing field in Sylmar 2,300 feet below, canvas-wing 
gliders appeared to be giant paper airplanes in the sky or a flock of fowl. 
</P>
<P>
"Hang gliders are our local bird," said John Riggs of Sylmar, who came to 
observe the competition. 
</P>
<P>
And it is largely thanks to pioneering pilot Scott, often called "Big Bird," 
that the skies of Sylmar have become one of the nation's most popular gliding 
sites. He first launched his glider off the Kagel Mountain summit in 1972, when 
hang gliding was still in its infancy. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't have any lessons. People were still just experimenting with the 
sport," his sister, Janet McDonald, said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Scott was widely known for his willingness to help new pilots, offering 
friendly tips and suggestions to improve their techniques. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a nice guy, not pretentious. He kept his eye on me and gave me tips 
that let me know he was really paying attention to what I was doing. That's the 
kind of guy he was," Renshaw-Armenta said. 
</P>
<P>
To support himself, Scott worked as a maintenance man for the Los Angeles 
Unified School District. He participated in national and international gliding 
competitions and tested new glider designs. He continued to glide until six 
months before his death. 
</P>
<P>
His parents said they were touched at the outpouring of affection for their 
son. 
</P>
<P>
"It is such an honor that they did this. This was his whole life," said Joel 
Scott, his father.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: TORRANCE POLICE KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH TRAFFICKERS, BUT 
WHAT ABOUT THE DRUGS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Torrance Police Department has a problem that every police force would love 
to have. 
</P>
<P>
It has busted so many drug buyers and dealers in recent years that it has no 
place to put all the confiscated drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The police property room is overflowing with marijuana, heroin, amphetamines 
and other assorted drugs. But most of the bounty is cocaine, according police 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
In order to accommodate the huge stash, the Police Department asked the City 
Council this week to allocate $14,890 to enlarge the property room by 1,650 
square feet. (For security reasons police officials would not give the property 
room's current size.) 
</P>
<P>
The heavily reinforced room will be completed in about five weeks, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"When they designed this place years ago it never entered anyone's mind that we 
would confiscate so many drugs," said police spokesman Sgt. Ron Traber. 
</P>
<P>
The source of these illicit drugs is an emerging wave of international drug 
traffickers who have made Torrance and surrounding cities a national 
distribution center for their multibillion-dollar industry, according to Lt. 
David Marsden, the head of the narcotics detail. Major drug dealers choose to 
operate in these cities because of their proximity to freeways, the Port of Los 
Angeles and to Los Angeles International Airport, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not satisfied with simply arresting drug dealers in the city, Torrance 
detectives began in late 1984 to work with federal agents in tracing the 
international drug supply line as it branched out from the airport and the 
port. As a result, Torrance police have made busts and confiscated dope and 
money as far away as Santa Ana, East Los Angeles and Orange. 
</P>
<P>
"We just began following the organization and we started crossing paths with 
federal investigators," Marsden said. 
</P>
<P>
One benefit for the city is that the Police Department gets a portion of the 
seized money. From 1985 to 1988, Torrance detectives impounded more than $3 
million in cash, receiving back $350,000 from federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
Proof of just how badly the department needs a bigger drug storage room is in 
the figures: from 1984 to 1986 police say they grabbed cocaine worth $28.4 
million. Last year the department confiscated about 1,700 pounds of cocaine, 
worth about $170 million, Marsden said. During the first three months of 1989, 
the department has already matched that amount. 
</P>
<P>
"Eighty-eight was one of our better years," he said. "But every year we are 
getting better." Hugo Martin

Before Ken Kuniyuki, a straight-A junior at Torrance High, got to the question 
that knocked him out of contention for first place in the first California 
Citizen Bee, he had correctly defined the term "stagflation." 
</P>
<P>
"I said that stagflation is a unique economic condition in which a recession 
and inflation are combined," the 16-year-old said. 
</P>
<P>
Kuniyuki's coach, Torrance High government teacher Pat Wright, was in the 
audience. "He knew it right off and I was so amazed," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Citizen Bee, a national competition encompassing American history, 
geography, economics, politics, culture and current events, Kuniyuki placed 
third in the state finals Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Kuniyuki, whose favorite subjects are social studies and mathematics, stumbled 
on a question about President George Bush's gun-control policy. 
</P>
<P>
"I said he put a ban on automatic guns," Kuniyuki said. 
</P>
<P>
Judges ruled his answer incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
"I forgot to say it was a ban on imports," he said. "I presumed that they knew 
that I didn't mean all guns, but you can't second-guess the judges. I learned 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the gaffe, Kuniyuki garnered a third-place prize of $750 and a spot in 
the national finals in Washington on June 17. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really excited," Kuniyuki said. "I wasn't expecting to win third place. 
And going to Washington -- it will be my first time there, so I am even more 
excited." 
</P>
<P>
The other California entrants are Stephanus Philip, a Moorpark junior who 
placed first, and Margaret Kuo of San Clemente High, who placed second. 
</P>
<P>
Kuniyuki is a member of the Torrance High Service Club, the Science Club, the 
Chess Club, the Debate Club and the academic decathlon team. 
</P>
<P>
He is also a student of the 19th Century German philosopher Arthur 
Schopenhauer, whose writings he analyzed in a term paper for an honors English 
class. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the way that he emphasized compassion in relationships," said Kuniyuki. 
On the other hand, he said, Schopenhauer "was extremely pessimistic. Maybe he 
was too pessimistic." 
</P>
<P>
Kuniyuki, who typed hundreds of facts into his Apple IIe computer to study for 
the state round of the Citizen Bee competition, said he has begun preparing for 
the final round. 
</P>
<P>
And he isn't taking anything for granted. "I've already made some notes for 
myself," he said. George Stein

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LEEUWENBURGH CHOSEN MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rolling Hills City Council has selected Councilwoman Ginny Leeuwenburgh 
mayor and Councilman Thomas Heinsheimer mayor pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
Leeuwenburgh, a community volunteer who has been on the council since 1982, 
said she will leave office next year. 
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to spending my last year on the council as mayor," Leeuwenburgh 
said. She said the eight years she will have spent on the council "is enough." 
</P>
<P>
She said the key issue before the council is "to maintain the city's rural 
atmosphere." The council has an established rotation system for mayor and 
council members, and it was Leeuwenburgh's and Heinsheimer's turn for the 
ceremonial positions. Both have previously served as mayor.

A motorist plunged to his death early Saturday morning while driving east on 
the Simi Valley Freeway near Topanga Canyon Boulevard, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
They said the car drifted off the road, dropped 300 feet to the bottom of the 
embankment, and caught fire. The driver, a man in his early 40s, police said, 
died at the scene of the accident, which occurred at 2 a.m. He carried no

CARWASH OPERATOR MEETS PRESIDENT AFTER TREK; 
</P>
<P>
WALKIN' WILLIE DELIVERS HIS MESSAGE ON CANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For a carwash man from Hawaiian Gardens, the feeling is still overwhelming. 
After completing his second cross-country walk for cancer awareness he had sat 
in the White House with the President. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my greatest triumph," William Croker said last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Starting Feb. 6 from Seal Beach, Croker walked 3,341 miles, arriving 72 days 
later on April 18 in suburban Washington. He realized his goal April 21 when he 
met with President Bush, who, upon seeing his visitor, exclaimed: "Here comes 
Walkin' Willie!" 
</P>
<P>
The trip took a toll. The 41-year-old Croker, a carwash operator at a Lakewood 
gasoline station, developed chronic pain in his legs, and his feet hurt from 
the time he reached Texas in late February. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aching Knees 
</P>
<P>
"My knees felt like someone put a needle in them," said Croker, who flew home 
April 22. 
</P>
<P>
The highways, steamy during Croker's summer crossing in 1987, had this time 
been cruelly cold. Temperatures usually were in the 30s. In Odessa, Tex., where 
Croker's water bottle froze, snow was two feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know the wind-chill factor was 10 below," he said. "People said, 
'Hey, you shouldn't walk out here.' I had two pairs of gloves and a ski mask 
on, trompin' down the road." 
</P>
<P>
There were also thunderstorms "like 150 howitzers going off" in Arkansas, and 
hail in Illinois and Indiana, where it was "ugly every day . . . black, the 
wind blowing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Elvis Tapes 
</P>
<P>
But Croker, inspired by Elvis Presley tapes he listened to as he walked, 
averaged 50 miles a day despite the elements and depressing brown countrysides 
that seemed to change only in Missouri, which already wore a lush green spring 
coat. 
</P>
<P>
To each town's media, he told his story: how his mother, father and sister had 
died of cancer; how a doctor told him in 1970 that if his mother had come to 
him a year earlier, she might have been saved; how he has dedicated the years 
since to encouraging people to have early cancer checkups, and how, because of 
his crusade, Congress is expected soon to designate April as Cancer Awareness 
Month. 
</P>
<P>
"We spread the word," said Croker, who does not have cancer. "So many more 
people were interested this time in the cancer aspect, and also the athletic 
part of it. A lot were amazed a man could walk that far. Reporters watched the 
miles go off and couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
During the first walk, Croker had complained of an apathetic media. "In '87 we 
were the 32nd film clip on the nightly news," he said. "Now I was the feature 
story." 
</P>
<P>
The Springfield, Ill., State Journal-Register published a large color photo of 
a bearded Croker, under which was his quote: There are a lot of people walking 
down the street today with cancer and they don't even know it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Besieged by Senators 
</P>
<P>
In Jefferson City, Mo., Croker was besieged by state senators. "Every one 
wanted a picture of me," he said. "There were about 26 of them in a walkers 
group. Each morning, before they go legislate, they walk 10 miles to relieve 
their stress." 
</P>
<P>
Outside of St. Louis, Croker was made aware of his message's value. "A woman 
who was working at the hotel where we were staying had heard about us," he 
said. "She had gone for a checkup and they found traces of cancer. Because they 
found it early, she won't have to lose a breast. I remember how much she was 
crying when she got to meet us." 
</P>
<P>
In Tennessee, Croker met with Gov. Ned Ray McWherter, and a record company 
asked him if he had a favorite country singer he would like to meet. Dolly 
Parton, he told them, but she was not in town. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Others Joined Him 
</P>
<P>
Croker did not always walk alone. "People who had seen me on TV joined me," he 
said. "It seemed that they were proud to be out there." 
</P>
<P>
On a cramped, four-lane bridge high above the Mississippi River in Memphis, 
about 20 walking enthusiasts accompanied him, along with three TV crews. "It 
was scary," he said. "There was nowhere to go unless you wanted to jump in the 
Mississippi." 
</P>
<P>
When he got across the bridge, Croker changed his socks. "My feet were bloody," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
By April 15, when he arrived in Columbus, Ohio, the pain was so bad that Joann 
Dill had to put his shoes and socks on him each morning. Dill and her husband, 
Bob, went ahead of Croker in a motor home. Also on the trip was Jimmy Doyle, 
20, who rode a bicycle and brought Croker water, bandages and fresh socks. 
</P>
<P>
The trip was easier than the one in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have to worry about money or whether we had enough gas to get to the 
next town," Croker said. He said $10,000 had been raised at a rally the day the 
walk began and that former baseball star Reggie Jackson had made a sizable 
donation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Steak This Time 
</P>
<P>
In '87, with only $80 to start out with, Croker had to eat baloney sandwiches 
and sleep in bug-infested campgrounds. This time, Joann Dill fixed him steaks. 
As a result, the 6-foot-2 Croker, who had lost 36 pounds during the first trip, 
dropped only from 210 to 198. 
</P>
<P>
Many nights were spent in hotels, courtesy of the Ramada Corp. His shoes (two 
pairs) and socks (114 pairs) were furnished by Nike. 
</P>
<P>
Discomfort, however, was a steady companion. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so tired I would go to sleep and wouldn't want to get up," Croker said. 
"I was concentrating so much that I never knew what time it was or what day it 
was. You lose all consciousness out there. All you look for is the next city. 
You just plug on." 
</P>
<P>
With his knees plaguing him, he plugged on past the farms of the Midwest and 
into the Allegheny Mountains of Pennsylvania and West Virginia. "Jesus, they 
were awesome," he said. "Just big ol' mountains." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Maryland Arrival 
</P>
<P>
As he descended into Maryland, his anxiety rose. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to get it over with," Croker said. "There was a lot of emotion. I 
started to cry. I felt proud, but I had my doubts if I was going to be able to 
see the President. I knew this thing couldn't be a success until I saw him. But 
I could smell it in my blood." 
</P>
<P>
He had doubts because two years ago President Reagan had been unavailable when 
Croker arrived in the capital. But Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) had promised 
Croker that a visit with Bush would be arranged. 
</P>
<P>
There was a reception, complete with Walkin' Willie posters and balloons, when 
he arrived just outside Washington in Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
At his hotel there, he received a call from the White House. "My hand was 
shaking so much I could hardly hold the phone," he said. "A woman said that the 
President would like to see me Friday and asked if I could arrange it in my 
schedule. I told her, 'Does a bear like honey?' " 
</P>
<P>
After appearing on the Today Show on Friday morning, he went by cab to the 
White House gate. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have any ID," said Croker, who has never had a driver's license. "So 
I pulled out a Times article that had been written about me." He said the 
guards were a little leery. "They're looking at me and it's as if they're 
thinking, this guy's got an appointment with the President? 
</P>
<P>
"Then this beautiful lady came out and said, 'I'm here to escort you back.' " 
</P>
<P>
And so, dressed in a black suit, a nervous Croker was led into the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
"I stood at the door and the President looked at me and said, 'Here comes, 
Walkin' Willie!' He grabbed my hand and I said, 'How you doin', Mr. President?' 
</P>
<P>
"He checked my legs; he looked so much bigger than me. I turned to my right and 
I never seen so many media people in my life. Flashes were going." 
</P>
<P>
Croker described his work in cancer awareness to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him I lost my family to cancer," Croker said. "He turned his head and I 
could see a tear in his eye. I knew I was with a man who really cared. He kept 
talking, as if a world leader was sitting there with him. I'm just a carwash 
man. I was totally humbled. It was beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
Croker estimates that he has walked 17,500 miles during his 19-year crusade. He 
intends, after a little rest, to add more. 
</P>
<P>
When Bush inquired about his plans, Croker told him that next year he wants to 
walk across the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got the momentum now," he said, holding a tie clasp he received from Bush 
as tightly as his memories.

COUNCILWOMAN LED 5-YEAR PICKET; 
</P>
<P>
ALHAMBRA WOMAN NOW FIGHTS FROM CITY HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH LU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Barbara Messina of Alhambra sets out on a political mission, there's no 
stopping her, even if she is confronted with threats or public disdain. 
</P>
<P>
Take the case of El Cid, an adult bookstore targeted for closing by community 
groups shortly after it opened on Main Street in 1975. Unfortunately for the 
store owner, Messina headed the picketing campaign, which lasted five years, 
ending only after the store burned down in 1980. Fire officials suspected arson 
but closed the case due to insufficient evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Seven days a week, rain or shine, Messina dispatched picketers to the store, 
where volunteers took one- or two-hour shifts from 9 a.m. to midnight. Messina 
was frequently in the picket line herself, carrying placards and marching 
quietly. 
</P>
<P>
Some passing motorists honked in support, Messina said, whereas others heckled 
them, accusing them of infringing on free speech. 
</P>
<P>
"They took a lot of abuse, especially at night," Messina said of her fellow 
picketers, who were members of a group called People Against Obscenity. On at 
least one occasion, occupants of a passing car "mooned" them, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Influential Councilwoman 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, Messina, 49, is championing her principles from City Hall, where she 
has become influential after 2 1/2 years on the City Council. As a 
councilwoman, she also sits on the redevelopment agency board, and her vote has 
often decided the fate of major Main Street projects crucial to revitalizing 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
She is also a member of a committee that will advise the City Council on the 
development of Valley Boulevard, and as such will play a key role in the 
development of one of the city's key commercial strips. 
</P>
<P>
A short, energetic woman whose black curls are trimmed in an easy-care, 
no-nonsense style, Messina juggles a hectic schedule of family and city 
affairs, dashing from City Hall meetings to ribbon-cutting ceremonies to the 
family's new pizza restaurant, Artino's, which, it is planned, will be renamed 
Messina's Trattoria, or Messina's Little Eatery, to add a family atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1970s, when she was caring for three young daughters, Messina said, 
she joined People Against Obscenity after she saw grammar school children being 
allowed inside the adult bookstore. She visited more than a dozen Alhambra 
church and community groups to sign up scores of picketers. On Mondays, members 
of St. Thomas More Catholic Church took the shift. Tuesdays it was Atherton 
Baptist Homes, and Wednesdays it was the Knights of Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
"I lived my life on the picket line," Messina said. The campaign took its toll, 
nearly breaking up her marriage, she said. Her husband, Michael, who had helped 
to schedule the picketing shifts, said the campaign got boring. 
</P>
<P>
"It took a lot of time, and it seemed nothing was happening," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Barbara Messina never considered giving up the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I'm just a stubborn Italian," she said. "It just became a matter of 
principle with me." Even after an anonymous sender mailed her a tarantula as a 
warning to quit, she held her ground. 
</P>
<P>
As a council member, Messina has a reputation for being outspoken and 
accessible to people. Critics, however, say she can be obstinate and emotional 
in her decision-making. But all agree that she is hard to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
Messina sits on a council that includes two attorneys, an accountant and a 
health administrator. She is credited with doing her homework before meetings 
but often consults her husband, a former mayor and councilman whom she 
succeeded in office, for advice. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all the council people in Alhambra, Barbara Messina is the most loyal to 
the people of Alhambra," said Ralph Gilliam, a former Planning Commission 
member who is a regular at council meetings. "She speaks out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vocal at Meetings 
</P>
<P>
Herman Schwab, a 42-year Alhambra resident, agrees. In 1986, when Schwab and 
his neighbors on Violeta Drive were fighting a proposed theater complex near 
their homes, Barbara Messina met with the residents and spoke up for them at 
council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Messina met with and agreed to help Ramona Avenue residents 
opposed to a controversial 78-foot sign. Resident Clifford Chen said that 
Councilman Michael Blanco, who also opposed the sign, "let his vote speak for 
itself," while Messina "talked to us." The city obtained an injunction to halt 
the sign's construction. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to put myself in the other person's position," she said. "I'm a bleeding 
heart, as they like to put it. It's true." 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam said that after being called for the least little thing, Messina "will 
call City Hall and make things happen." As a result, Messina receives 20 or so 
calls a week from residents, and she follows up on all of them, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stubborn Under Stress 
</P>
<P>
Messina admitted to being stubborn when she is under stress, but added, "If you 
show me I'm wrong, I'm flexible." 
</P>
<P>
For example, she said, she had originally opposed installation of a dance floor 
at a proposed restaurant downtown, but after learning that there would not be 
nightly dancing there, she voted to approve it. 
</P>
<P>
When Messina first took office, her relations with other council members were 
"a little strained," she said, because they probably believed accounts of her 
stubbornness circulated by her opponents. But tension eased after council 
members attended a retreat and "put their cards on the table," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Messina's colleagues on the council said she is hard-working but can be 
hardheaded. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy working with Mrs. Messina," Boyd Condie said. "I think she feels 
fervently about things." 
</P>
<P>
Blanco, who backed one of Messina's opponents during her 1986 bid for office, 
said: "It's easier to work with Michael than it's been working with Barbara." 
He said he felt Michael Messina was better at understanding city issues. But 
Councilman Talmage Burke said Barbara Messina is good at talking with 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
"If she has all the facts and listens to all the discussions, she comes to a 
reasonable conclusion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Parker Williams, a former council member who at times had clashed with Messina 
over redevelopment and other issues, said: "She's got a heart of gold, but she 
doesn't understand things." 
</P>
<P>
"I can say the same thing about him," she responded. 
</P>
<P>
She said Williams thinks she doesn't understand the economic consequences of 
city policies. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand," she said. "I just don't agree with him." She said she tends to 
side with the underdog, mainly residents and small business owners. 
</P>
<P>
Messina acknowledged that 20 years ago she was thin-skinned, but said she feels 
that now she has learned to take criticism in stride. What made the difference 
was the 1973 death of her daughter Kathleen, 10, from a brain tumor. 
</P>
<P>
"Life is too short," Messina said. "I don't harbor any hard feelings for 
anybody that's done anything to me. I just don't think it's worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Now her biggest problem is learning how to say no so that she doesn't stretch 
herself too thin, she said. 
</P>
<P>
She is close to her daughters, two of whom are married -- but "no grandchildren 
yet," she said. Teresa Messina Juarez, 27, and Maryann Messina-Doerning, 25, 
are both teachers in Alhambra. Kristen, 18, is a cheerleader at Alhambra High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
"We really grew up with a sense of civic responsibility early on," said Juarez, 
who is a library board member. Daughter Maryann helps manage the family 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Messina knows that the restaurant's location on Main Street may raise a 
conflict-of-interest issue if future city projects are proposed nearby, but she 
said she has informed the city attorney that she will disqualify herself from 
voting based on his advice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hates to Cook 
</P>
<P>
Messina admittedly hates to cook but agreed to help run the restaurant as a 
family investment. She works there four or more hours a day and whips up a 
10-gallon batch of spaghetti sauce and meatballs every Monday. 
</P>
<P>
One recent weekday, Messina, dressed in a tailored gray skirt, white blouse, 
and black pumps because she had just come from a city-related meeting, stood 
behind the restaurant stove and served up a heaping portion of the spaghetti 
lunch special. The mild sauce, made from her grandmother's recipe, is jazzed up 
with sweet bits of fresh garlic, which she loves. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a better spaghetti sauce," said Steve Francis, a 19-year-old who 
started working at the restaurant before the Messinas bought it in February. He 
also credits the councilwoman for getting him back on the job, which he had 
quit after an argument with Michael Messina. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my fault," Francis said. "She helped me own up to it." Michael Messina, 
who said his wife is much better than he is at dealing with people, now mainly 
concentrates on the business side of the restaurant while she supervises the 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Messina shuttles to her appointments in a new Cadillac sporting 
personalized plates that say "HOT ITLN," for Hot Italian. "It caused such a 
stir," she said, wincing in disbelief. The plate elicited uninvited comments 
from truck drivers and raised eyebrows from neighbors, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Politically, she has come a long way since 1969, when she headed a citizens 
group to defeat proposals for a new courthouse and library that would have 
raised taxes for homeowners such as the Messinas, who had just bought a house. 
</P>
<P>
Picketing the bookstore further piqued her interest in politics by introducing 
her to Sacramento legislators she described as "so liberal." But she did not 
run for the council until 1986, when she won a close race to fill a seat 
previously held by her husband. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, after then-Mayor Mike Rubino left office after a conviction for 
accepting a bribe, Messina's husband urged her to run, but she demurred, saying 
she didn't feel she was qualified. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I did have the housewife syndrome at the time," she said. She said she 
no longer suffers from that but acknowledges that she frequently consults her 
husband on city policy. 
</P>
<P>
"I respect him, and I respect his opinion," Messina said. She said her husband, 
who owns Messina Development Co. in Alhambra, is an expert on development 
issues and also the person she most admires. He said his company does not take 
on projects in Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to name the accomplishment she is most proud of, the councilwoman names 
the renovation of Almansor Park, a project completed when her husband was on 
the council and she was his field representative. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Blanco said that Messina's penchant for consulting her husband has 
made it more difficult for the council to reach decisions on various projects. 
</P>
<P>
"At times she sounds like what he says is what she's going to do," Blanco said. 
"But he's not there (at council meetings) to discuss things." He said that as a 
result, progress on the city's redevelopment projects has slowed. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Messina said he advises his wife, but they do not always agree and she 
often turns out to be right. "We each have certain talents and skills," he 
said. "We feed off each other." 
</P>
<P>
He dismisses as "typical political talk' accusations that although his wife is 
on the council, he is running the show. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is quieter than his gregarious wife. When he was a councilman, he 
said, the talk was that "he may be running, but it's her that's running 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
The Messinas' team approach did get them into trouble in 1985. Then Councilman 
Michael Messina, saying his job was requiring him to travel more, offered to 
resign -- but only if the council named his wife to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
Critics accused Messina of trying to broker the selection of his successor, and 
the council rejected the conditional resignation on a 2-2 vote. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just taken the wrong way by people," Barbara Messina said of the 
resignation offer. "I just didn't feel it was out of line." 
</P>
<P>
For some politicians, such as former Monterey Park Councilman Matthew G. 
Martinez, who went on to be a state assemblyman and now U.S. congressman, a 
City Council seat has turned out to be a steppingstone to higher office.

THEY CALL HIM FLASH;

<P>
KOREAN-BORN RICHARD PARK OF RANCHO PALOS VERDES MAY BE THE BEST 12-YEAR-OLD 
HOCKEY PLAYER IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. TROUBLE IS, IF HE WANTS TO GET EVEN 
BETTER, HE'LL HAVE TO LEAVE.

<P>
They call him "Flash," this 12-year-old Rancho Palos Verdes kid touted in 
international hockey circles as the next Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Park's stick-handling and passing are so crisp, comparisons to The 
Great One are inevitable. On the ice, boys his own age are no match. He has 
dominated teen-agers four years older than he. Born in Korea, raised in 
Southern California, Park is living a power play in a sport long dominated by 
Easterners and Canadians. 
</P>
<P>
"At his age he does things on the ice that I guarantee not all the pros can 
do," said UCLA club hockey team Coach Jack White. 
</P>
<P>
A center/defenseman, Park recently led the Los Angeles Junior Kings to the 
California Pee Wee Division title in only his first season. He scored 10 goals 
in a single game. In international tournaments in the United States and Canada 
this past winter, he was so brilliant that his picture popped up in 
International Hockey Weekly. His story has been told in French, Korean and 
English-language newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the best 12-year-old I've seen in a long time," said Junior Kings Manager 
Nick Racanelli. 
</P>
<P>
An ultra-elitist amateur hockey club in the Midwest is trying to persuade his 
parents to move him there. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid's a gem," said Al Thomas, manager of the Chicago Young Americans, a 
Triple-A amateur team composed of some of the best teen-age prospects in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Park is unique in hockey because of his heritage, his size and the area he 
lives in. There has never been a Korean-born professional hockey player. Only 
two or three Asians have ever played professional hockey, according to the 
National Hockey League. That's one of the reasons Park has drawn so much 
attention as he travels the country. 
</P>
<P>
"Word travels. There aren't too many Oriental kids that play hockey," said his 
20-year-old sister, Christina, who often travels with him. 
</P>
<P>
At 5-foot-8, Park is large for his age and he uses that to his benefit on the 
ice. 
</P>
<P>
"People think Koreans are always small, but that is just not true," said 
Christina. An older brother is 6-foot-1. Richard, who has grown four inches 
since last summer, thinks he can reach at least 6 feet. 
</P>
<P>
And Park also lives in Southern California, where in young people's minds 
hockey ranks right up there in importance with homework and a new pair of 
snowshoes. 
</P>
<P>
"He has the pure hockey sense that you don't see very often in players from 
Southern California," said his local coach, Dave Kizanis. 
</P>
<P>
All the attention has been a little overwhelming for young Park. 
</P>
<P>
Said Christina: "Richard doesn't like the attention. He's really shy." 
</P>
<P>
Park's reputation precedes him. He was mobbed in Minnesota, where "the 
attention was unreal," Christina said. In Quebec, young girls asked for 
autographs. In Washington state he was credited with boosting attendance at a 
national tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, "he's not a regular 12-year-old," said Christina. "He has had to 
mature real fast." 
</P>
<P>
Park's mother, Jean, isn't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," she said with a nod when asked if she thinks the pressure is sometimes 
too intense. "I think it does bother him." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the time, Richard Park just wants to hang out with friends, go to a 
shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
"I get kind of tired of (the attention) sometimes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When a reporter and photographer showed up one recent Saturday afternoon at Bay 
Harbor Olympic Ice Arena in Harbor City to watch Richard practice with his 
local team, the young star was less than thrilled. He fussed about posing for a 
photo with his mother and sister, which drew a stern look from Jean. When 
practice ended, he hid out in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
Kizanis coaxed him. Park tugged at the dark strands of hair on the back of his 
neck, protruding from under a Los Angeles Kings hockey cap. His shoulders 
rested against a cold concrete wall. He stared at the ceiling. An icy silence 
as thick as the rink outside stifled the room. 
</P>
<P>
But when the talk turned to surfing, Park's eyes suddenly lit up, and with a 
youthful grin he spoke of his day, which began at 5 a.m. at the Manhattan Beach 
Pier with a borrowed surfboard. 
</P>
<P>
"Man, I hurt my butt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't really being aloof by hiding out, he said later. 
</P>
<P>
"Seems kind of strange that a 12-year old gets all this attention when there 
are older guys out there just as good as me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A friend and local Bantam Division teammate, Eric Kizanis, who is Dave Kizanis' 
son, says Richard is basically a regular guy. As for how he handles his hockey 
status: "He wouldn't be the same (person) if he wasn't that good." 
</P>
<P>
After all, family members point out, Richard is only 12 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Richard said he sometimes feels the eyes of two nations staring at him. He has 
lived in the United States since he was 4 and considers himself a regular 
American kid. Christina says he wants to become a naturalized citizen when he 
turns 18, but he would still be eligible to play Olympic hockey for his 
homeland if he chooses. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't speak Korean that well," Richard said. Yet the Korean work ethic that 
puts family and education ahead of all else is precisely why he is so good on 
the ice. 
</P>
<P>
"The family is 100% behind him," said Kizanis. 
</P>
<P>
Park attends hockey camps around the country. There are weekly clinics in 
Burbank, the next night in Pasadena, sometimes in Van Nuys. Jean says she never 
counts how much money the family spends on hockey each year, only that it is 
substantial. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really like hockey. I just love to watch my son," said Jean, a 
serious-looking woman. 
</P>
<P>
The Park family, two boys, two girls, Jean and her husband Paul, moved to the 
United States and settled in Brea almost eight years ago. Paul is in the import 
business. Christina took ice skating lessons soon after the family arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to do something I couldn't have done in Korea," she said. 
</P>
<P>
One day she took her little brother to the rink. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave him a lesson and the teacher told us that he was just too good, that 
he already had an ability to skate," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The family moved to the Palos Verdes Peninsula when Richard was 5. That's where 
Kizanis got to know him. Park wanted to skate every day. 
</P>
<P>
"His dedication comes right from his parents," Kizanis said. 
</P>
<P>
But dedication alone may not be enough. Korean society is very strict, said 
Jean. Sometimes her beliefs have clashed with those of her rapidly 
Americanizing young son. 
</P>
<P>
Explained Christina: "In Korea parents live for us, the kids. American parents 
give and expect to get back from their kids. If Richard didn't become a pro, 
Mom wouldn't be that upset." 
</P>
<P>
Richard should treat hockey as a hobby, his mother said. To Koreans, education 
is more important, and because Richard gets "only Bs," he is sometimes scolded 
by his family. 
</P>
<P>
"Without an education, you are only a dumb hockey player," said Christina, a 
pre-med student at Loma Linda University. 
</P>
<P>
Richard describes himself as "kind of a smart-ass" in his parents' eyes, but 
Christina says he's really a momma's boy. 
</P>
<P>
"Mom is too strict sometimes," Richard said. "When I ask her if I can go out 
with friends to the mall, she says no. My friends' parents let them go." 
</P>
<P>
Jean says she would do anything for her son. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to copy the American people," she said. "But school first, hockey 
second." 
</P>
<P>
The Parks face a dilemma. If Richard wants to stay on top of his game, experts 
agree he has to leave Southern California to play against better competition. 
The problem here, they say, is that there just aren't enough ice rinks and ice 
time to go around. Consequently, very few hockey players of Richard's caliber 
develop here. 
</P>
<P>
"In another year, they'll have to be doing some serious thinking about getting 
him into an area where he can develop," said White. 
</P>
<P>
Park has been "an exception to the rule" among players here, said Racanelli, a 
former Canadian. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem in Southern California is that you just don't get the good 
coaching. He'll have to leave here and go somewhere where everybody is good." 
</P>
<P>
Canada, the Midwest or the Northeast are good bets for the Parks. They recently 
began discussing a move. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe in a year," said Jean, who said she will follow her son wherever he 
goes. "I have more kids. Richard is my baby." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Park knows he must go, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe one more year. But I would miss my friends," he said. He stared across 
the Bay-Harbor locker room at Eric Kizanis. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Kizanis, who has coached Richard for five seasons, leaned against a wall. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm kind of reliving hockey through these guys," he said of the two boys. "But 
I know Richard definitely has to go now. There just aren't enough older guys 
here to teach him anything." 
</P>
<P>
Jean left to go to the coffee shop, where Thomas of the Chicago Young Americans 
wanted to discuss moving Richard now. He promised more ice time and a $52,000 
budget that would pay for most of Richard's travel expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"Put in a good word for me, huh?" Thomas asked a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard wasn't interested at that very moment. Night time was approaching; 
the hockey playoffs were on TV. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe he would go to the mall later with some friends.

LIONS CHEW UP SANTA CLARA'S WCAC HOPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The West Coast Athletic Conference baseball race has apparently been whittled 
to a two-team affair after Loyola kayoed Santa Clara in two seven-inning games 
Saturday, 4-3 and 8-2, at Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's victories gave the Lions three straight over the 19th-ranked Broncos 
and probably knocked third-place Santa Clara out of WCAC title contention. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions, 17-1 in the WCAC and 35-18 for the season, have won 16 straight 
conference games and 13 straight overall. Santa Clara fell to 11-8 in the WCAC 
and is 36-19 overall. The teams conclude their series with a 1 p.m. game today 
at Loyola, the Lions' last home game. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions' dousing of Santa Clara sets up next week's season-ending series at 
Pepperdine, which is 16-3 after sweeping USF Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In the first game, each team scored a run in the first inning. Loyola took a 
3-1 lead in the second by bunching two walks, two hits and a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
However, Loyola 10-game winner Kalani Bush again failed to make it through four 
innings. The Broncos tied the game with two runs on three hits and a walk 
against three pitchers in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
The game then settled into a pitchers' duel. Darryl Scott, the fourth Lion 
hurler, came out of the bullpen to pitch the sixth and seventh innings, and 
earned the victory when Loyola finally scratched out the winning run in the 
sixth. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions, who had been three-hit to that point by Broncos curveball pitcher 
Vince Fultz, scored on an inning-opening walk and stolen base by Rick Allen and 
a single by Brian Turang. 
</P>
<P>
Scott improved to 5-6 with the win, while Fultz fell to 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions collected nine hits in the nightcap, but the second game belonged to 
sophomore left-hander Jon Willard, who was overpowering for five innings. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola took advantage of Bronco starter Burch Boehner's wildness and some 
shoddy defense to build a 8-1 lead after four innings. 
</P>
<P>
Deuces were wild in the second as Loyola used two hits, two walks and two 
errors to score four times. Outfielder Robert Cannon had the key hit, a two-run 
single. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions scored three more times in a nightmarish third inning for Santa 
Clara, which made two more errors and saw reliever Tom Hotchkiss injure his 
arm. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola's eighth run came in the fourth when Cannon singled, stole second and 
third and scored on Travis Tarchione's single. 
</P>
<P>
Willard struck out five and allowed only five hits before being lifted with two 
outs in the sixth. The victory raised him to 2-0. Boehner, who surrendered four 
walks and three hits in 1 2/3 innings, fell to 5-5.

MUSTANGS DEFEATED IN VARSITY CLASSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the long run, Saturday's Redondo/Mira Costa Varsity Classic means little to 
the Mira Costa Volleyball team, win or lose. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs were eliminated from the tournament in the quarterfinal round by 
dropping a 16-14 decision to Newport Harbor after winning four straight matches 
to get there. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the loss, the tournament was very important for the Mustangs, who are 
ranked No.1 in the CIF Southern Section 4-A Division after compiling a perfect 
15-0 overall record and a 10-0 mark in the Ocean League. 
</P>
<P>
The 25-team tournament, which was held at Redondo High, provided the Mustangs 
with their biggest challenge of the season but the results were less than 
encouraging for coach Mike Cook. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar, a team that trails the Mustangs in the 4-A Division at No. 4, 
defeated Loyola (4-A, No.7) by scores of 15-8, 15-12 for the title. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great tournament and there's a lot of competition," said Cook, whose 
team now looks forward to the start of the playoffs on May 12. "Anything can 
happen in a one-game playoff and we made a few too many errors." 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs built a 6-3 lead before hitting three straight balls out of bounds 
to allow Newport Harbor back into the match. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a good lead and all of a sudden we hit three nice sets out of bounds," 
said Cook. "We have too much talent to keep doing that, but this tournament 
doesn't really mean anything to us; we'll be all right." 
</P>
<P>
The only other local team to advance past the pool play besides Mira Costa was 
Palisades, which was also eliminated in the quarterfinals.

THE WEALTHY LEADER OF A SHIITE SECT INVESTS IN THIRD WORLD HEALTH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Harry Nelson, Harry Nelson, formerly a Times medical writer, specializes in 
Third World health issues. 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
KARACHI, PAKISTAN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the world's richest men is creating what may be the most ambitious 
private program anywhere to correct the crippling inequities that deprive 
people in developing countries from the basic benefits of housing, education, 
health care and social advancement. 
</P>
<P>
He is a 52-year-old, Harvard-educated British citizen residing in France, 
Prince Karim Aga Khan, the 49th hereditary spiritual leader of the Ismaili sect 
of Shiite Muslims, who number 15 million. 
</P>
<P>
For 30 years the Aga Khan (the title means "great leader") has carefully 
expanded the programs of social and economic development begun early in this 
century by his grandfather, whom he succeeded as spiritual leader of the 
Ismailis in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
The list of social and economic development programs now include 300 
educational institutions, 200 health-care centers, diagnostic clinics, 
dispensaries, five general hospitals and scores of business enterprises 
self-initiated by poor people in such countries as Pakistan, Kenya, Tanzania, 
India and Bangladesh. All are funded primarily by Ismaili religious tithings 
and are available to everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Last month the Aga Khan came to Karachi, Pakistan's largest and most 
slum-ridden city, to attend ceremonies at what is planned to become the 
centerpiece of the Aga Khan Health Services stretching from Africa well into 
the Asian heartland. 
</P>
<P>
The event was the graduation of the first class of 42 physicians from the Aga 
Khan University Medical College, a $300-million institution with an ultramodern 
721-bed hospital that is by far the best in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Experts familiar with the problems of training and maintaining health personnel 
in developing countries fear that here may be another example of sincere 
intentions destined to falter and finally be ground into inferiority by the 
same merciless forces that create inequity. 
</P>
<P>
Countless programs funded by international agencies have so withered. But the 
considerable educational, financial and political forces behind this movement 
-- plus a community-based involvement that is the cornerstone of all Aga Khan 
development enterprises -- raise its chances of succeeding. 
</P>
<P>
There is also the significant impact of a religious sect that is both intense 
and well directed. Ismailis have been called the "calm corner of Islam." In the 
words of the Aga Khan: "It is important that the industrialized world not see 
the Islamic world as being exclusively the somewhat strident voices which are 
not representative of the majority." 
</P>
<P>
Ismailis place a high value on education -- particularly of women, who have 
long been subjugated in many Muslim countries. English and science are the 
"global intellectual currencies," as the Aga Khan has said. 
</P>
<P>
Pakistan does not need more doctors so much as a different kind of doctor. The 
country paradoxically has more physicians than it can now employ -- not because 
the need is lacking but because of economics and the failure of existing 
government schools to prepare physicians and organize a delivery system that 
meets public health needs. 
</P>
<P>
Pakistan spends less than 1% of its gross national product on health. The 
government system has no slots for public health nurses. Rural health centers 
are either underutilized or overwhelmed with patients but seldom have active 
programs to teach preventive health. 
</P>
<P>
The Aga Khan's stated goal is not to replace the government health system but 
to create programs as models that can be duplicated by other developing 
countries as well as Pakistan, to meet the needs of all the people. The Medical 
College, in a unique program, immerses students in the social and living 
conditions of the masses of poor -- who are the bulk of Pakistan's 100-million 
residents. From virtually the first day of class, each student is assigned to 
spend 20% of his or her five school years among Karachi's poorest residents or 
in backward villages designing and running health programs. 
</P>
<P>
It is there, say faculty members, where future doctors will learn the causes -- 
mostly preventable -- of infant and maternal mortality, malnutrition and 
infectious diseases that curb economic development and make life insufferable. 
The official infant mortality rate is 126 deaths in the first year for every 
1,000 live births -- more than 10 times the U.S. rate -- and in many areas of 
the country the rate is far higher. 
</P>
<P>
But the university is not satisfied trying to meet only primary needs. In what 
some see as a threat to maintaining its community health program, the Medical 
College has also decided to provide the specialized training required to 
perform high-tech procedures typical of health care in developed nations. 
</P>
<P>
While agreeing with that goal, the dilemma, said Dr. Jack Bryant, an American 
who heads the department of community health services, "is that the largest 
needs of Pakistan will be met mainly through community-based health services in 
poor and remote settings, whereas the largest part of the training of the 
students takes place in an elegant setting where technology is supreme." 
</P>
<P>
A concern is that students -- as has occurred in the United States -- will be 
lured away from working to meet critical community needs by higher earnings in 
more sophisticated pursuits, and that such conflicting human drives will hamper 
efforts to remedy health problems that afflict more than half the world's 5 
billion people. 
</P>
<P>
One hope lies in the network of educational and economic development programs 
fostered by tithes and gifts from faithful Ismailis to the Aga Khan. A key 
feature -- and one of the firm tenets of all community development -- is that 
the incentive to raise living standards must spring from the poor in the slums 
and rural villages, rather than from outside imposition. A grass-roots 
philosophy pervades all of the Aga Khan programs. 
</P>
<P>
Before any health program is begun in a city slum or a rural village, leaders 
of that community are consulted and asked what they see as their most pressing 
problems. Eventually they choose several residents to attend basic training 
courses and become that community's own health workers. Once trained, these 
workers are contacted frequently, to be consulted, resupplied with simple drugs 
-- and with encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
From these communities many future doctors, nurses and students are expected. 
The theory is that such students are the most likely to return to the villages 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
Mumtaz Mughan, a 1988 graduate of the university nursing school, was born in 
the Gilgit region of Northern Pakistan among the majestic snowcapped Karakoram 
Mountains not far from China. Today she is the community-health nurse in 
Singul, a village where Aga Khan Health Services has built a satellite health 
center that serves perhaps 10,000 persons living in villages strung along the 
Gilgit River Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I could make more money if I stayed in Karachi, but I came back because I 
wanted to help," she said. Her sentiment echoed many faculty members who 
returned from greener pastures abroad to help build a better health system in 
their native land. Most of the full-time faculty of 140 are Pakistani doctors 
who have returned home after years of training and working in Britain, Canada 
or the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Halfdan Mahler, former director of the World Health Organization, captured 
the spirit pervading the program with a Chinese adage he cited in an address to 
new graduates: 
</P>
<P>
 Go to the people. 
</P>
<P>
 Live with the people. 
</P>
<P>
 Learn from them. 
</P>
<P>
 Start with what they know. 
</P>
<P>
 Build on what they have. 
</P>
<P>
 When the task is finished, 
</P>
<P>
The people will say, 
</P>
<P>
 "We did it ourselves."

GOING WITH GLASNOST: A TESTIMONY BY TRAIN

<P>
On my last reporting trip before being expelled as Newsweek's Moscow bureau 
chief in 1982, I was accused by authorities in the Central Asian city of 
Dushanbe of telling young men that the Soviet Union should abolish the draft. 
The basis for the charge: During discussions with young Muslims about the 
Afghanistan War, I had mentioned the United States having an all-volunteer 
Army. To the KGB, that was tantamount to advocating draft resistance. 
</P>
<P>
I recently returned to the Soviet Union and found that, like so much else, 
attitudes towards the West and Westerners are changing, although often 
unevenly. Conversations that once would have been branded "provocative" are now 
commonplace, and the authorities have largely given up trying to insulate 
society from the outside world. Like their American counterparts, Soviet 
citizens exhibit uninhibited curiousity about the other superpower. And, as in 
the United States, there is a lively debate about possible interaction between 
Western policy and Mikhail S. Gorbachev's perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic change is government willingness to tolerate, even encourage, 
the opening of communications channels that present a picture of the West 
wholly at odds with the old imagery. Taking full advantage of his fluent 
Russian, U.S. Ambassador Jack F. Matlock Jr. regularly delivers speeches to 
Soviet audiences, including military academies. Soviet publications have run 
lengthy interviews with him which he characterizes as "absolutely fair." 
Western radio broadcasts are no longer jammed and Soviet emigres are allowed to 
return home for visits, spreading word about their lives in the West. A small 
but growing number of Soviet citizens are traveling to the West on private 
visits, not as members of official delegations. 
</P>
<P>
Traveling by train, I found people more interested than ever in details of 
Western life -- prices, wages, ethnic relations -- and comparing them to their 
own situation. As a Western reporter, I encountered less fear and harassment 
than before, particularly in the Baltic republics. But in provincial Russia, 
old instincts die harder. In the northern city of Vologda, a young man 
contacted me and made a classic KGB entrapment pitch: Would I help relay 
information about "police and troop deployments in the region" to American 
correspondents in Moscow? 
</P>
<P>
Some once-standard questions were significantly absent this time: Who lives 
better, the West or us? Why does America want war? They were never asked by the 
people with me in the "hard" or second- class cabins of trains, since the 
answer to the first question was now obvious and the second deemed laughable. A 
young engineer recalled the old propaganda line that the United States was to 
blame for Soviet food shortages, since the "American threat" necessitated heavy 
defense spending. "Now that we have good relations, who will we blame?" Then he 
grinned. 
</P>
<P>
The only time I heard the old line was in a first-class compartment through the 
Ukraine. Two middle-aged Communist Party officials claimed they knew for a fact 
that "some Americans, not ordinary people, but the neo-fascists," want war. But 
as we were pulling into the station, a young man who had stayed out of the 
discussion attacked the two officials for representing "the era of stagnation," 
the current term for the Leonid I. Brezhnev era. Something like that would not 
have happened before. 
</P>
<P>
Deeper divisions exist on the more fundamental question of whether the West 
should serve as a model for the Soviet Union. Activists in the Baltic republics 
openly push for Western-style democracy and capitalism. Some Russians are 
similarly inclined -- but others fear unleashing "anarchic" forces. Writer 
Vasily Belov asked if I believed it was a good thing that glasnost has already 
opened the doors to "narcotics, eroticism and pornography," which he clearly 
identified as products of Western-style liberalism. Dmitri Vasilyev, leader of 
the Russian ultranationalist group Pamyat and an avowed monarchist, argued that 
"the West is not an ideal and may be even worse than what we have here." 
</P>
<P>
But as recent elections demonstrated, many citizens, Russians included, are 
eager to open their system further, emulating Western ways. Among official 
propagandists for perestroika and among dissidents pushing for still broader 
changes, debate focuses on a familiar question: How can the West help Soviet 
reform? 
</P>
<P>
Veteran Izvestia correspondent Melor Sturua hailed my return as a sign of the 
improved U.S.-Soviet climate. He had reason to be pleased: in tit-for-tat for 
my expulsion in 1982, he had been expelled from Washington. Now the slate was 
wiped clean and we both were allowed to return to old stomping grounds. As a 
faithful proponent of every policy twist since Stalin's day, Sturua is 
currently a fervent advocate of perestroika -- and eager to discuss the West's 
"moral obligation" to help the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"The experience of history shows that if you are economically strong, you are 
less aggressive and more predictable," he said. The implicit warning: Without 
Western aid, perestroika may fail and the Soviet Union will again threaten the 
world. Somehow the blackmail element never disappears, even in better times. 
</P>
<P>
The real veterans of battles to open up the Soviet system -- and of the prisons 
and labor camps -- take a radically different view of the Western role. "The 
support Gorbachev gets in the West gives him the feeling that he can delay 
changes in this country," argued Sergei Grigoryants, the editor of the samizdat 
journal Glasnost. 
</P>
<P>
I heard the same argument at a meeting of Ukrainian nationalists in Lvov, but 
with a more embittered edge. "In times of crisis, the West has saved the Soviet 
Union and it is doing so again," Sergei Noboka declared. "The West does not 
want destabilization of the Soviet Union and it will do everything to allow us 
to be put away for another 15 years." Baltic nationalists expressed similar 
worries, that the West would sacrifice the republics' interests on the altar of 
a new detente. Most people I met had little confidence in the ability of 
Westerners to understand the current situation. 
</P>
<P>
Westerners traveling to the Soviet Union are not helped in that task by a 
duplicity that still exists. In Moscow, I met an old friend who occupies a 
senior academic position. He exuded utter pessimism about the durability of 
glasnost and the chances of perestroika arresting the deterioration of the 
Soviet economy -- but only to people he knows well. My friend described a 
recent meeting with a group of visiting American Sovietologists, whom he 
described as euphoric: "They said everything was wonderful." He shrugged and 
smiled sadly. "So who was I to say anything different? I said it was wonderful, 
too."

MAKE DRINKERS PAY THE SOCIAL COSTS OF IMBIBING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

University professor of health policy and management; Emmett B. Keeler is a

<P>
Most Americans are familiar with that staple of 1988 campaign rhetoric: "Read 
my lips -- no new taxes." But how many, including the President, are aware that 
there are other reasons to raise a tax besides raising new government revenues? 
</P>
<P>
One good reason to tax a commodity, for example, is if its use imposes costs on 
others. If the tax isn't at least equal to those costs, it ought to be raised 
accordingly. That, in essence, is why we believe federal taxes on alcoholic 
beverages ought to be boosted -- not in order to reduce the budget deficit, 
although that would be a side effect, but to ensure that heavy drinkers bear 
more of the social burden they create. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent study for the RAND Corp., we found that alcohol taxes cover 
slightly less than half the costs drinkers inflict on society. In effect, the 
public subsidizes every other swallow. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally the alcohol tax should focus only on abusers. (Along with most studies, 
we define abuse or heavy drinking as consumption in excess of five drinks per 
day.) But since it is impractical to identify and tax only those individuals, 
we averaged the costs over all alcohol consumption. 
</P>
<P>
The largest single cost alcohol abusers foist on their fellow citizens is also 
the most obvious -- the price paid by innocent victims of drunk-driving 
accidents. Drunk driving, plus alcohol-related expenses of the criminal justice 
system, imposes costs of 19 cents per drink. 
</P>
<P>
Other effects are more subtle. Heavy drinkers have higher health-care costs, 
most of which are financed through group insurance premiums or taxes. The 
excess medical costs amount to 2 cents per drink. Additional sick leave taken 
by drinkers contributes another cent per drink. Because heavy drinkers tend to 
die earlier, they do not collect as much in Social Security benefits. But this 
is more than offset by their greater rate of collection on group life insurance 
and on disability insurance policies. The net effect of Social Security, 
private pensions, group life insurance and disability insurance is to add 
another penny per drink. 
</P>
<P>
Many social-welfare programs are financed through payroll taxes; because heavy 
drinkers do not work as many years, they do not pay in as much in payroll 
taxes, another penny per drink. (These cost estimates have been adjusted for 
numerous differences between heavy drinkers and others, including their age, 
sex, race, education, family income and other health habits, including how much 
they smoked and exercised.) 
</P>
<P>
All this adds up to 24 cents per drink in costs that heavy drinkers impose on 
others. This compares with a tax that at present is around 11 cents per drink. 
The 11 cent figure considers average state and federal excise and sales taxes 
and also averages taxes on beer and wine together with the higher taxes on 
distilled spirits. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, despite the enormous toll of smoking on personal health, we 
computed that smokers do pay their social way. Total taxes per pack of 
cigarettes average about 37 cents nationally and are even higher in California, 
while the costs to others are 15 cents per pack to those outside the smoker's 
family, or 38 cents per pack if we include costs imposed on other family 
members by the smoker. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest cost of smoking falls directly on the smoker: more than two hours 
less to live for each pack smoked. But callous as it may seem, this loss of 
life is not a financial cost to society. Smokers' payments for the pensions 
they don't live to collect offset a large fraction of their higher medical and 
disability costs. 
</P>
<P>
With alcohol's costs more than double current average taxes, a tax increase is 
clearly in order. But why should moderate drinkers pay 24 cents per drink to 
cover the costs of those who overdo it? Two reasons: First, to the degree that 
additional taxes deter alcohol abuse -- and there is evidence that states with 
higher tax rates have lower vehicle fatality rates and lower rates of death 
from cirrhosis of the liver -- all, including moderate drinkers, will benefit. 
Second, to the extent that alcohol taxes are an alternative to other types of 
taxes, moderate drinkers will come out ahead. After all, the 10% who are heavy 
drinkers consume two-thirds of the alcohol; they will pay the bulk of any tax 
increase on alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
The federal budget deficit aside, there is good reason to raise excise taxes at 
federal, not state, level. If one state raises taxes, there are not only 
incentives to bootleg alcohol across state lines but also incentives to drive 
to a nearby state to drink, thereby increasing the probability of an auto 
accident on return. 
</P>
<P>
Some have argued that raising alcohol taxes will hit hardest at the poor. Poor 
people who are heavy drinkers will be worse off, but poor people drink less on 
average than others. More important, excise taxes on alcohol account for less 
than 1% of federal revenues, whereas individual income taxes account for 40%; 
minor adjustments in the income tax can readily compensate for any increase in 
alcohol taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1951 and 1985, the Consumer Price Index quadrupled, while federal taxes 
on distilled spirits were raised only 19%; taxes on beer and wine were raised 
not at all. Yet it is beer and wine taxes that most need raising. The tax on 
wine is a little more than a penny per glass (less than a penny in California, 
which has by far the lowest taxes on wine in the country). The tax on beer is 
less than a nickel per glass -- and beer is the drink of choice for teen-age 
drunk drivers. An increase in taxes will lead people to reduce their 
consumption of alcohol -- and reduce the magnitude of its social costs. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't make any sense, Mr. President. Read our lips: No more such 
subsidies.

The song "Little Tin Box" is from the 1959 musical "Fiorello." Jerry Bock and 
Iwrote the music and lyrics respectively. It satirized the testimony of various 
corrupt officials in the administration of New York Mayor James J. Walker, in 
the early 1930s. One man was asked where he got the money to pay for certain 
things he could not possibly have afforded on his salary. His answer: "The 
money came from a little tin box my wife kept on the kitchen shelf." 
</P>
<P>
Any resemblance to Oliver L. North's recent testimony -- he said he was able to 
buy a $7,000 horse for his daughter and an $8,000 car for himself from pocket 
change he had collected in a "little tin box" -- is purely coincidental, and

Robert Shogan's "Bush's Dilemma in Dealing With a Contrary Hill" (Opinion, 
April 16), states that President Bush has two options; confront Democratic 
lawmakers for partisan reasons or compromise with them to reach political 
objectives. The former could lead to a stalemate in Washington, while the 
latter could potentially limit the power of the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
What is truly frustrating is that neither of the options should be 
considerations. It is necessary for the President to work with Congress in 
order to reach national objectives. Also, Congress must compromise with the 
President while not stepping into the shoes of the executive branch. 
</P>
<P>
The American people are tired of partisan politics and are looking for a 
nonpartisan government to look after the needs of the country, not simply 
Republican or Democratic factions.

PHOTOSYNTHESIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times reported that results of experiments in the Antarctic show that 
photosynthesis has declined 25% in the top 3 feet of the Antarctic Ocean 
("Study Is Said to Confirm Fears of Damage From Ozone 'Hole,' " Part I, April 
6). Photosynthesis is the start of the earthly food chain. Everything on earth 
is dependent on it -- everything! 
</P>
<P>
The decline in photosynthesis is cause by the increased ultraviolet radiation 
now hitting the Earth, particularly in the Antarctic region. The increased 
radiation is cause by the loss of ozone in the Earth's upper atmosphere, which 
absorbs most the the UV radiation. The loss of the ozone is caused by man-made 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) -- the things we use to make air conditioning work, 
to clean computer chips, and so on. In other words man-made activity is causing 
the destruction of the Earth's food chain. 
</P>
<P>
The article quoted Ted DeLaca, head of the polar programs of the National 
Science Foundation, as saying the findings are "provocative." Provocative? Why 
are scientists always looking for more evidence to confirm the obvious? 
</P>
<P>
It is no longer an overstatement to say that we are flirting with annihilation! 
Is anybody noticing? The limited international agreements to slow our 
production of these destructive chemicals are not enough. 
</P>
<P>
Today two things are needed: an immediate halt to the production of CFCs and 
subsequent steps to begin a man-made replenishment of the ozone that has been 
destroyed. Both can be done, and if we place any value on life on this planet, 
we had better move rapidly.

CUTTING SURTAX ON MEDICARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First, you accept the concept that the beneficiaries should foot the bill. This 
is the first time in our history that the cost of a program has not been spread 
over the whole population. Removing the cap on income taxable by the Medicare 
tax portion of the Social Security tax would be a more equitable approach. 
</P>
<P>
Second, it should be pointed out that the vast majority of the 40% of the 
seniors with enough income to pay income tax are most likely low-middle income 
people. The surtax, scheduled to rise to 28%, means a drastic cut in their 
living standards. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the benefits of the bill affecting only a small percentage of the 
elderly, are minimal due to the very large deductibles. As regards President 
Bush, he would much rather cut the capital gains tax for the rich than ease the 
burdens of the poor and middle-income Americans.

CUTTING SURTAX ON MEDICARE

<TEXT>
<P>
According to the article, I am one of the "affluent elderly." That's news to 
me. Elderly, OK, but "affluent"? I wish I had the income to match the 
appellation. 
</P>
<P>
Only due to a lifetime of prudence have I achieved "comfortable." Now, in spite 
of "no new taxes," the catastrophic health care surtax wipes out, to the penny, 
my state teacher's retirement cost of living raise for this year. Add to that 
the rise in Medicare Part B premium as well as the sharp rise in medi-gap 
supplemental insurance, and more to come yearly, how much longer will 
"comfortable" apply? 
</P>
<P>
The catastrophic coverage is a catastrophe for some of us. The percentage who 
will benefit from it is minuscule. 
</P>
<P>
If I were "affluent" I wouldn't be writing this letter. I would gladly pay up 
and shut up.

TAX POLICIES RULE OUT A KINDER, GENTLER NATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALFRED LoPINTO, Father Alfred LoPinto is executive director of Campaign for 
Human Development-United States Catholic Conference. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Does President Bush realize that, despite the paltry relief provided the poor 
in the 1986 reforms, federal tax policies as they exist today make it all but 
impossible for the United States to be a kinder and gentler nation? 
</P>
<P>
The evidence is now voluminous and conclusive that the wealthiest Americans are 
getting wealthier each year, and the poorest Americans are becoming hopelessly 
poorer. 
</P>
<P>
When Bush says that there will be no significant changes in our tax policies, 
does he mean that he wants this terribly wrong trend to continue? 
</P>
<P>
Recently the House Ways and Means Committee issued a study showing that 
American families on the bottom of the income scale suffered an 11% reduction 
in income adjusted for inflation in the period from 1973 to 1987. Most of that 
drop for the 20% of our lowest-income people occurred in the period from 1979 
to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also found that the top 20% of American families benefited the 
most, with a gain of 24% in purchasing power from 1979 to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
This study came on the heels of similar news from the nonpartisan Congressional 
Budget Office, which found that after inflation, most American families in 1988 
had lower incomes than they did in 1977. And the poorest 10% of our population 
gave 20% more of its income to the federal government, while the richest 10% 
paid 0.4% less than in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
The most stunning findings of the Congressional Budget Office were as follows: 
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1988, 80% of our families had seen their incomes decline since 
1977 when adjusted for inflation. But the richest 10% of Americans saw an 
average increase of 16%. The top 5% averaged a 23% rise and the wealthiest 1% 
saw their incomes grow by 50%. 
</P>
<P>
The sobering image that emerges from these statistics is that there has been a 
major new stratification of American society along class lines, despite three 
tax reform efforts in 1978, 1982 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 was hailed for removing 6 million working-poor 
people from the income tax rolls as a result of increased personal exemptions. 
And recent legislation establishing the "earned income credit" also was meant 
to give relief to the working poor. But the Congressional Budget Office study 
concludes that these gains were wiped out by higher Social Security taxes and 
by higher taxes on alcohol, tobacco and gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
We also should not forget that tax-reform concessions to the working poor do 
not justify a tax policy that extracts a higher price from our most vulnerable 
people when we spend less for housing, education and health care in our 
attempts to deal with the federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The clear reason for this drastic shift in income distribution was an attitude 
shared by the Reagan-Bush Administrations and Congress. That attitude holds 
that progressivity, for many years a valid idea that proposes that those who 
can afford it should pay more to sustain the whole of America, has now become a 
dirty word. 
</P>
<P>
Where can we begin to stop the economic punishment of the working poor and once 
again proclaim the social contract that made America a sign of hope for the 
poor and oppressed of the world? 
</P>
<P>
We can start with that absurd 28% top rate. 
</P>
<P>
When Ronald Reagan came to Washington in 1981, his first major proposal was for 
an across-the-board 25% tax reduction for every American. The maximum rate 
would drop from 70% to 50%. That sounded good to tax-weary American workers. 
</P>
<P>
The President sold that across-the-board idea wherever he traveled, and people 
bought it without realizing that 25% of $1 million is an awful lot of money 
compared to 25% of $1,000, especially when the poor and middle class had to 
give their windfall back in the form of higher Social Security taxes. 
</P>
<P>
That was the first torpedo fired at progressivity, and the Congress saw nothing 
wrong with it. 
</P>
<P>
After Reagan won reelection in a landslide in 1984, it was only a matter of 
days before Treasury Secretary Donald Regan unveiled another tax-revision plan. 
This time the maximum rate would drop precipitously once more, from 50% to 35%. 
</P>
<P>
Congress struggled fitfully with the new proposal, and in return for the 
elimination of some egregious shelters and loopholes, a House-Senate conference 
committee brought forth an astonishing two-tier rate that saw the middle class 
paying 33% maximum and the richest people in America paying only 28%. 
</P>
<P>
What a coup for the most affluent people in the United States. Think of it. 
Donald and Ivana Trump pay their taxes at a lower rate than John and Margaret 
Suburbanite. 
</P>
<P>
The poor in America are sinking, Mr. President. Nevertheless, they still try 
mightily to improve their condition. But our poorest people need more help. 
They need a more compassionate and fairer government, and they need your help 
to give it to them.

VOLATILE SOVIET SITUATION NEEDS NO 'HELP' FROM OUTSIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. FREDERICK STARR, S. Frederick Starr, president of Oberlin College, was 
founding secretary of the Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian Studies. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Early in the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln wrote Horace Greeley that "my paramount 
object . . . is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy 
slavery." 
</P>
<P>
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's position on the crisis in the Soviet Union's minority 
republics is similar to Lincoln's in 1862. "Perestroika," he said, "is not 
breaking up the national structure of the country. We are against that." 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln failed to hold the Union together. Gorbachev's present policy will fail 
to keep the Soviet Union together, too, unless he backs it up with brute force. 
Here's why. 
</P>
<P>
Millions of people in five non-Russian republics of the Soviet Union have been 
in ferment for months. Georgians, and before them Latvians, Estonians, 
Lithuanians and Armenians have all taken their complaints against Moscow out on 
the streets. Troops have been called in twice, and there has been bloodshed, 
most recently in Tbilisi. It has been easy for the Kremlin to paint all this as 
the work of ethnic hotheads out to settle a score with Moscow or with other 
national groups. A Kremlin spokesman, Gennady I. Gerasimov, said as much, 
adding disdainfully "they have no program." 
</P>
<P>
But what are they really after? The question is the more complex since these 
are the Soviet Union's five richest republics. By comparison, Russians live 
like paupers. And herein lies the problem. Knowing they can live better in the 
non-Russian republics, Russians by the millions have flocked to them. 
Naturally, the non-Russians object, especially when their native language 
disappears from street signs and in schools through a process of Russification. 
The "ethnic" component of their program is thus to preserve their language and 
culture by reversing the influx of Russians. 
</P>
<P>
Their other concerns are equally pointed. Members of several of the Soviet 
nationalities believe that the Russians are draining them economically. All 
want the benefit of trade with the Russian market but they also demand greater 
control of their local economies so they will not be forced to sell goods to 
Moscow at artificially low prices. To gain this control, they demand greater 
home-rule. Independent political movements have sprung up in all five republics 
to press for rule by elected representatives of the people. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these political groups are socialist, others anti-socialist. Still 
others are composed of factions from both sides. All, however, stand for 
expanded civil rights, including freedom of speech, assembly, religion and the 
press. All seek an independent judiciary. All are convinced, too, that only a 
multiparty system can protect these rights in their land. 
</P>
<P>
The tactics used by these embryonic parties go far beyond yelling in the 
streets. Nearly all the candidates they backed in the recent national elections 
won. Now they are organizing for regional and local elections, scheduled for 
autumn. The parties issue position papers and newsletters. Most are organizing 
down to what we call the precinct level. At the same time, they maintain close 
ties not only with movements in other non-Russian republics but with 
sympathizers among the independent Popular Front and Democratic Front 
organizations in Russia proper. The Baltic states are even building ties abroad 
-- Latvia with Sweden, Lithuania with Poland and Estonia with Finland and 
Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
What do these movements really want from Moscow? Some in each group want to 
exercise the right to secede from the Soviet Union, as guaranteed in the Soviet 
constitution. Most, however, would settle for less. After all, geography will 
link their fate to their Russian neighbor whatever political arrangements may 
exist between them. Given this, most stop short of advocating disunion, calling 
instead for a loose federation in which all rights not explicitly assigned to 
Moscow remain with the local republics. 
</P>
<P>
Given the programs and tactics of the national movements, Gorbachev's brusque 
effort to stonewall them is puzzling. Moscow has taken no steps to mollify or 
co-opt the home-rule movements, let alone to introduce a true system of 
federalism that would meet their demands. There are many successful models of 
such a system, including more than a few schemes devised by Russians during the 
century before Lenin took power. Gorbachev has ignored them. In the absence of 
such measures, radicalization is proceeding apace, both in the Caucasus and the 
Baltic regions. Increasingly, the minority republics are a tinderbox that could 
be ignited by the smallest spark. 
</P>
<P>
What position should the United States take on all this? Americans naturally 
respond with sympathy to the image of democratic Davids taking potshots at the 
Russian Goliath who thwarts their self-determination. But the dangers of 
outsiders -- even well intentioned ones -- toying with so volatile a situation 
are huge. No one can foresee whether events will lead to a crackdown from 
Moscow or to the institution of new constitutional structures that protect 
pluralism. One thing is for sure. An explosion would prove as disastrous for 
further reform in the Soviet Union as a whole as the bloody rebellion of 
Russia's Polish subjects in 1863 did for the "Great Reforms" being instituted 
at that time by Czar Alexander II. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has no interest in fanning chaos in the Soviet Union. 
Instability there would slow or stop reforms that are changing totalitarian 
rule. It would make the Soviet Union a less reliable partner in efforts to 
resolve conflicts in the Third World. It would reduce Soviet interest in arms 
control, and hence hurt our efforts to reduce the U.S. federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Far better would be to maintain our present policy favoring measured, 
controlled change in the Soviet Union. This means keeping up steady contact 
with authorities in Moscow and, informally, with public movements in the 
republics. It means exercising patience and a willingness to look beyond 
short-term excesses that might be committed either by Gorbachev or by the 
various national movements. Above all, it means suppressing our national 
passion for "getting involved." In the end, we cannot resolve this grave 
dispute among neighbors.

'COERCED TO BEAR' POINTS TOWARD WOMEN BEING 'FORCED TO ABORT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN GOODMAN, Ellen Goodman is a syndicated columnist in Boston. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the spectators tried to read the lips and minds of the justices there 
followed a seminal exchange between Charles Fried and Sandra Day O'Connor, the 
justice who may be pivotal to this case. "Do you say there is no fundamental 
right to decide whether to have a child or not?" O'Connor asked Fried. 
</P>
<P>
He answered hesitantly and she pursued. What if, she said, in a future century, 
we had a serious overpopulation problem. Does the state have a right to require 
abortions? 
</P>
<P>
This was not some question that professors use to trip up first-year students. 
It went to the heart of the matter. The government wants the court to 
"reconsider" who has the right to decide the question of abortion: the woman or 
the state. If it's the state, she asked, couldn't a legislature that disallowed 
abortion today force it tomorrow? 
</P>
<P>
Fried's response was as quick as it was obtuse. There is a difference, he 
insisted, between preventing an operation and forcing one. A forced abortion 
would mean "violently . . . laying hands on a woman and submitting her to an 
operation . . . ." A forced pregnancy, however, was what? Nonviolent? Benign? 
</P>
<P>
Such distinctions would seem obscure to a woman pregnant against her will for 
nine months. They would seem specious to the doctor calculating the medical 
risks of her condition. But George Bush's lawyer saw nothing intrusive in such 
a pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
It was O'Connor alone who raised the issue of coercion. Like others who have 
reservations about Roe vs. Wade and about abortion itself, she had concerns as 
well about individual liberty. If, as she once wrote, abortion was on a 
collision course with medical technology, then "pro-life" is on a collision 
course with liberty. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the scenario that she described is not as far-fetched as it sounds. We 
do not have to look to the future or to China to see state attempts to control 
reproduction. We've made our own. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in this century, there were numerous forced sterilizations in the 
United States. It was 1974 before the courts ruled that the poor or mentally 
incompetent couldn't be coerced into such procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Six years ago, in Massachusetts, a court ruled in favor of a husband who wanted 
to force his wife into a cervical operation so she wouldn't miscarry. She was 
only protected from this "violently . . . laying on hands" by the Roe reasoning 
of a higher court. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1980s, we have seen as many as 11 Caesarean sections ordered by 
courts. We have had at least one pregnant woman accused of fetal neglect and 
had others put in protective custody -- protective of the fetus. 
</P>
<P>
Even now there is serious debate about whether a pregnant women could be forced 
into testing and treatment for her fetus. There are suggestions among those who 
talk of fetal rights that the government could constrain a pregnant woman's 
diet and physical activities, stomp out her cigarettes, empty her wine glass . 
. . or else. 
</P>
<P>
If that is true today, what if the protection of Roe were shattered, and a 
woman's rights transferred piecemeal to the government? How freely would the 
state intervene? 
</P>
<P>
The specter of forced pregnancy is serious enough. There is no real need to tap 
into O'Connor's fantasy of forced abortion to see the dangers of gutting Roe. 
But pendulums swing. How hard is it to imagine the first financially strapped 
state practicing coercive family planning? How hard to imagine another group of 
eugenicists in a statehouse insisting that the brain-damaged fetus of a welfare 
mother be aborted? 
</P>
<P>
As Harvard Law School's Lawrence Tribe says, "There's no principled way to say 
that the government can use women's bodies against their will to nurture the 
unborn without accepting the other serious and totalitarian implications about 
privacy." While the court deliberates the Missouri case, it is worth 
remembering that if you take away the right of individuals to make decisions 
about their lives, you cede it to the state. And that is just the beginning.

GARCIA MARQUEZ SKEWERS A HERO -- AND OUTRAGES A NATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM R. LONG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BOGOTA, Colombia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gabriel Garcia Marquez has broken the rule of reverence for historic heroes, 
and the faithful are up in arms. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Belandia, secretary of the Colombian Academy of History, was 
fulminating the other day over Garcia Marquez's latest novel. 
</P>
<P>
"He uses history to darken the prestige of our institutions and heroes," said 
Belandia, a portly man with gray hair and a small bow tie. "It is an 
anti-patriotic book." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The Liberator' 
</P>
<P>
The book, "The General in His Labyrinth," is about Simon Bolivar, South 
America's greatest hero. It depicts "the Liberator" in his latter days as a 
feeble insomniac with bad breath and gas, feverish and often delirious, 
rejected by Colombians and dejected by the failure of his health, the loss of 
his glory and the death of his dreams. 
</P>
<P>
While such aspects of the Liberator's life are not unknown, they are not 
usually emphasized. Nor is his fickle pattern of womanizing or his bitter 
quarrel with Francisco Santander, the other great hero of Colombian 
independence. But Garcia Marquez insistently probes these and other cracks in 
the legend. 
</P>
<P>
"He unloads all his anger against the lofty Santander and against Colombia 
itself," Belandia said at the Academy of History, where a Caesar-like bust of 
Bolivar faces the entrance from a colonial courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
Belandia is not alone in his outrage. Since its publication here in March, "The 
General" has blown up a controversy echoed in hundreds of newspaper columns of 
often-blustery commentary. Enrique Santos, director of the daily El Tiempo, 
said there has been a torrent of letters to the editor, overwhelmingly 
indignant. 
</P>
<P>
"Of every 10 persons who write, eight are against the book," Santos said. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia Marquez has further enraged his critics by saying, according to an 
interview granted to the Associated Press, that the profits from the sale of 
"The General" will go toward the creation of a research foundation that will 
set out to write Colombia's true history. 
</P>
<P>
"All I know is that we know nothing about history in Colombia," Garcia Marquez 
was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy has as much to do with Garcia Marquez's legend as with 
Bolivar's. South America's leading novelist and Colombia's only winner of the 
Nobel Prize, "Gabo" is also a strident leftist and close friend of Communist 
Cuba's Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
For conservative historians like Belandia, writers who defend "The General" as 
"humanized" history are part of an insidious trend. 
</P>
<P>
"Writers of the left and especially historians, young historians, are intent on 
darkening the prestige of our republican and democratic institutions, attacking 
their creators and organizers," Belandia said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hints of Marquez's Return 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, while the novel has triggered a barrage of criticism against 
Garcia Marquez, it has coincided with hints that he may soon return from years 
of self-imposed exile. 
</P>
<P>
He left Colombia in the late 1970s after hearing that he was under 
investigation for alleged links to anti-government guerrillas. Authorities said 
no proof had been found, but the author's fame and political leanings made him 
a potential lightning rod in Colombia's violent political climate. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Garcia Marquez won the Nobel Prize for Literature, consolidating the 
international prestige that had grown steadily with the publication of "One 
Hundred Years of Solitude," "The Autumn of the Patriarch" and other books. 
</P>
<P>
After the publication of "The General in His Labyrinth," the author told 
reporters in Mexico, where he lives, that he would like to return to Colombia's 
Caribbean coast, where he was born. Gen. Jaime Guerrero Paz, the Colombian 
defense minister, told reporters here that Garcia Marquez was welcome to come 
home, and the author responded to the invitation with what he called "immense 
emotion" and "enormous gratitude." 
</P>
<P>
"I would return to Colombia at any moment," he said. He told the Spanish 
magazine Cambio 16 that his next book, also planned as a historical novel, will 
be set in Colombia's 18th-Century Caribbean port of Cartagena. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia Marquez makes no apology for the controversy over "The General." He 
accuses many Latin American historians of contributing to a Bolivarian myth and 
cult that hides the Liberator's human nature. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Colombian news magazine Semana, he declared, " 'The 
General' was written, among other reasons, so that they would not keep doing 
such things to the memory of Bolivar." 
</P>
<P>
Most histories of Bolivar concentrate on his battlefield genius in leading the 
liberation of five South American countries from Spanish colonial rule, 
starting with Venezuela and finishing with Peru and Bolivia, the nation named 
for him. They describe his youth as an aristocratic and wealthy orphan in 
Caracas, his plotting as a young exile in Europe and the Caribbean and his 
crowning glory as president of Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador and dictator of 
Peru. 
</P>
<P>
Bolivar's great dream was to unite the countries he freed in a huge nation that 
would rival the United States in power. The histories tell how that dream 
crumbled in regional rivalries, political differences and personal quarrels. 
But most of them have little detail on Bolivar's final journey to his death on 
the Caribbean coast after the political winds in Bogota turned against him. 
</P>
<P>
That painful journey, over craggy mountains, down the Magdalena River and 
finally to the city of Santa Marta, provides the story line for Garcia 
Marquez's novel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Pathetic Figure 
</P>
<P>
In the book, the general sometimes pauses for days, unsure of where he is 
going, as he agonizes in his poverty, sickness and disgrace. He is a pathetic 
figure, sometimes deeply depressed as he lies naked and sweating in his 
hammock, sometimes poignantly nostalgic as he recalls his youth, his women and 
his victories. At one low point, a faithful servant hears him crying in his 
sleep. 
</P>
<P>
"Hearing the little whines, Jose Palacios thought they were from a stray dog 
taking shelter by the river. But they were from his master," Garcia Marquez 
writes. 
</P>
<P>
And sometimes, the general is consumed by regret. "I got lost in a dream 
looking for something that does not exist," he laments in the book. Garcia 
Marquez infuriates many readers here by depicting Bogotanos as ungrateful 
persecutors of Bolivar and Colombians as divisive and conspiratorial. 
</P>
<P>
"Every Colombian is an enemy country," the general says in exasperation. 
</P>
<P>
Some white Colombians also bridle at Garcia Marquez's notion that Bolivar had a 
strain of African blood "from a paternal great-grandfather who had a son with a 
slave." But the worst insult for many is Garcia Marquez's portrayal of 
Santander as a villain. 
</P>
<P>
"He treats him in the most contemptuous way, as if he were a liar who has 
betrayed Bolivar," said Gabriel Camargo-Perez, another member of the Colombian 
Academy of History. 
</P>
<P>
The book does have its prominent defenders. Maria Susana de Ojeda, a historian 
who administers a museum in what was once Bolivar's Bogota home, said in an 
interview that "The General" should be read not as history but as a novel that 
artfully shows the hero as a human being. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not going to lower the Liberator from the pedestal on which we have 
him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
At a publication ceremony, former President Alfonso Lopez Michelsen presented 
"The General" as a masterpiece of literature. 
</P>
<P>
But an editorial in El Tiempo said Garcia Marquez subtly plays up Bolivar's 
dictatorial personality "to create an impalpable comparison with that of Fidel 
Castro." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Demented Newspaper' 
</P>
<P>
Garcia Marquez counterattacked, calling El Tiempo a "demented newspaper." The 
newspaper retaliated with another salvo: "The gigantic vanity of Gabriel Garcia 
Marquez allows only praise, reverence, hand kissing, bows and adulation over 
his works." 
</P>
<P>
Felix Burgos, sales manager for Garcia Marquez's Colombian publisher, 
acknowledged that the controversy is good for sales of "The General." The first 
edition was 700,000 copies, and Burgos said 80% of it has been sold. Normally, 
a Colombian best seller reaches a maximum of 60,000 copies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 250,000 copies of "The General" were exported to other Andean countries 
where the publisher, Oveja Negra, has distribution rights. Burgos predicted 
that a second edition will come out in June or July. 
</P>
<P>
Rights for publication in other countries have been negotiated by Garcia 
Marquez's agent in Spain. Burgos said the English translation, to be published 
by Alfred A. Knopf of New York, will probably not be ready for the presses 
until next year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FROM 'THE GENERAL IN HIS LABYRINTH' 
</P>
<P>
"When he returned to the bedroom he found the general at the mercy of his 
delirium. He heard him utter fragmentary phrases that fit into a single one: 
'No one understood anything.' His body burned in a bonfire of fever. . .The 
general himself would not know the next day whether he was talking in his sleep 
or raving while awake, nor would he be able to remember it. It was what he 
called 'my crises of dementia.' " 
</P>
<P>
"It was the end. General Simon Jose Antonio de la Santisima Trinidad Bolivar y 
Palacios was leaving forever. He had seized from the Spanish dominion an empire 
five times as vast as the Europes, he had directed twenty years of war to keep 
it free and united, and he had governed it with a firm hand until the previous 
week, but at the hour of his departure. . .the only one who was lucid enough to 
know he really was leaving, and where he was going, was the English diplomat 
who wrote in an official report to his government: 'The time he has remaining 
will barley be enough to reach the tomb.' ".

ROGER SIMON: CITY BOY FINDS A SECRET IN THE COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Roger Simon 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We would open up the want ads on Sunday mornings and read them aloud to each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
"Hge. views! Wooded. 10 acre tracts. Southern views. Some w/springs, deer &amp; 
turkey galore. Telephone/elect. available." 
</P>
<P>
"Unique mtn. resort! 4 Season Amenities. Slopeside, lakeside or secluded. 
Spectacular views &amp; cool mtn. climate. Trout stream flows by your door! 
This is your vacation home!" 
</P>
<P>
My wife was especially good at reading these ads. You could almost hear the 
trout splashing in the streams when she did it. 
</P>
<P>
I was not impressed. I had been a city boy all my life and my distrust for the 
countryside was considerable. The country was where pink-eyed children out of 
"Deliverance" played banjos from the back of pick-up trucks while their kinfolk 
eyed you with evil intent. 
</P>
<P>
"Listen to this one," my wife said. " 'All cedar mtn. chalet overlooking pond. 
Loft, cellar, wood stove. Good timber. Deeded access to state forest. Financing 
avail.' " 
</P>
<P>
I snorted. I do things like that on Sunday mornings. It prepares me for the 
coming week. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we should at least take a look," my wife said. "I would like to see a 
hge. view with deer and turkey galore. Just once." 
</P>
<P>
I snorted again. Just to keep in practice. 
</P>
<P>
The next Sunday we drove to the mountain mentioned in one of the ads. It took 
about three hours, but it was a pleasant drive. The trees and bushes were in 
full bloom, traffic was light and nobody seemed to be in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
The real estate agent had given us directions to a pharmacy in a tiny town. He 
would meet us there in his four-wheel-drive Jeep, which we would need to get up 
the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing we noticed as we waited outside the pharmacy in the 
sweet-smelling sunshine was that everyone going in and coming out said hello to 
us. 
</P>
<P>
Do we know these people? I asked my wife. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just being friendly," she said. "That's why you find it so strange and 
disconcerting." 
</P>
<P>
The real estate agent arrived on time. He had moved to the region from North 
Carolina and retained a soft Southern accent. He was not a hard-sell kind of 
guy. I could tell that because his first question was not whether I had brought 
my checkbook. 
</P>
<P>
He just stood for a while looking at the mountaintops, which spread all around 
us. Some were close by and dark green. Others were farther away and kind of a 
hazy lavender. 
</P>
<P>
We got into his car. We drove down a country road. The only things we passed 
were an elderly man on a folding chair by a wood pile and a cat. 
</P>
<P>
"That man, Ben, is there every day selling that wood and nobody is real sure 
whether it's his wood," the agent said with a chuckle. "And that cat waits out 
there for the road crews to cut the grass. Then it goes after the mice. It's a 
very patient cat." 
</P>
<P>
I kept pinching myself to keep from liking this guy. 
</P>
<P>
We passed a country store that had a sign in its window offering "bear tags." 
My wife asked what they were. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, we have a short bear-hunting season here," the agent said a little 
sadly. "I'm not a hunter, but some folks around here, well, their daddy hunted 
bear and their daddy's daddy hunted bear and so they have to hunt bear." He 
shook his head. "Don't see it myself." 
</P>
<P>
He drove in silence for a few minutes. "If you have bear on your property, it'd 
be up to you whether you'd want to hunt them," he said. "Didn't mean to be 
judgmental." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, we wouldn't hunt them," my wife said. 
</P>
<P>
Bear? I was thinking. All the sudden we are making plans about what to do with 
our bear? 
</P>
<P>
Are these large bears? I asked. Or sort of teddy-bear-sized bears? 
</P>
<P>
The agent pounded the steering wheel while he laughed. "That sure is a funny 
one," he said. "I'll have to remember that one." 
</P>
<P>
We turned up a freshly cut dirt road. "The 'dozer just cut it two days ago," he 
said. "Before then it was only a Jeep track. So you folks will probably be the 
first to see this." 
</P>
<P>
We climbed and climbed and climbed. When the wheels of the car began to slip, 
the agent eased into four-wheel-drive and we spurted forward, climbing higher. 
</P>
<P>
Every now and then, we would get out and and walk through the trees and take a 
look at the view. It was magnificent. Stunning. Breathtaking. There were 
overlapping mountain ridges in the distance. A bright green valley floor below. 
And occasional hawks making slow circles in the air. 
</P>
<P>
"In the real estate business," the agent said, "we call this a huge view." 
</P>
<P>
Hge. Real hge. 
</P>
<P>
I cleared my throat. Uhh, I said, what would land up here cost. I mean, 
money-wise. 
</P>
<P>
He mentioned a figure for 10 acres. It would not buy you a quarter-acre with 
view of dumpsters in the alley in any city in America. The reason was not hard 
to figure out. This place was hours away from anywhere. You would need a 
four-wheel drive to get to it. And all you really had around you was a place to 
buy bear tags, a guy who sold wood of questionable origin, a cat who waited 
patiently for mice and a pharmacy where folks said hello to strangers. 
</P>
<P>
You may have noticed I have not told you where this place is. And while I am 
making up my mind about it, I don't think I will. 
</P>
<P>
I wouldn't want a lot of city folk coming in and scaring away my bears.

SMOKELESS TOBACCO AS A LESSER EVIL; 
</P>
<P>
RISKS MAKE A STRONG CASE FOR NOT TAKING THAT FIRST CHAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Question: I don't like to see people, especially youngsters, smoke, and I don't 
like to see them using smokeless tobacco. But at least people don't become 
addicted to smokeless tobacco. If a young person did start to chew tobacco, at 
least he'd be able to stop any time he wanted to. Wouldn't this be an 
advantage? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Whether or not a product is addictive, I fail to see any advantage to 
using it when it's associated with the development of cancer, dental problems 
and an increased heart rate and blood pressure, to name just a few of its 
adverse effects. Besides that, your assumption is wrong; smokeless tobacco 
contains nicotine, which is considered a dependence-producing substance by the 
National Institute on Drug Abuse. 
</P>
<P>
In one study, the amount of nicotine in the blood of people who used smokeless 
tobacco was found to be comparable to that in the blood of cigarette smokers. 
Cigarette smoking and smokeless tobacco should both be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I read in the papers where a ballplayer had an operation for a shoulder 
injury. I had the same injury, but my doctor did not recommend an operation. 
Isn't my arm the same as a ballplayer's arm? If that's the case, why is there a 
difference in treatment? 
</P>
<P>
A: A professional athlete whose livelihood depends on the ability to perform 
requires the kind of treatment that will enable him to return to active 
participation at the earliest possible moment. This is not an important 
consideration with most people, probably including you. 
</P>
<P>
With an athlete, the question isn't only the best form of treatment for a 
particular condition, but the treatment that will enable him to return to 
competition as early as possible without jeopardizing his career. 
</P>
<P>
Q: When I was younger, we used to read a lot. Today, most kids seem to spend 
their time with their eyes glued to television. Aside from the fact that it 
would do a lot of these kids more good to read a book, aren't we in danger of 
raising a bunch of people whose eyes will be damaged because of the hours and 
hours they sit in front of a television set? 
</P>
<P>
A: While I do not doubt that some children spend an excessive amount of time 
watching television, damage to the eyes is not one of the consequences. 
Watching "too much" television or using the eyes in other ways will not damage 
them. It's possible the muscles around the eyes may become tired, but simply 
resting them periodically should be sufficient to take care of it. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My sister has trouble with her fingers during the winter. She says her 
doctor told her that she has Raynaud's phenomenon. I would appreciate an 
explanation of what this is. 
</P>
<P>
A: Some individuals experience spasms in the small blood vessels of their 
fingertips or toes when they are exposed to cold or even after emotional 
stimulation. This causes the toes or fingertips to whiten, and may result in a 
great deal of pain because of the decrease in the blood supply. This syndrome 
is called Raynaud's phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have seen members of my family taking their insulin shots, and they seem 
to take the injections a lot better than I would if I were in their place. 
Isn't it possible for insulin to be taken like a pill or in syrup, the way 
other medicines are taken? 
</P>
<P>
A: Insulin cannot be taken by mouth because the body's digestive juices would 
destroy it. It must be given by injection so that it can be absorbed directly 
into the patient's blood stream. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have been hearing about tired blood for so long that it has made me tired. 
Is tiredness a symptom of tired blood? 
</P>
<P>
A: The condition that some people refer to as "tired blood" is called iron 
deficiency anemia by physicians. Fatigue may be a symptom, but very often there 
are no obvious symptoms.

SOUK-CESSFUL: The Pasadena Art Alliance can be counted on for original 
wackiness. And now that its annual Treasure Sale -- Super Souk (a souk is a 
Middle-Eastern marketplace) -- is over, they're $77,000 richer, president Sally 
Hurt says. 
</P>
<P>
Under chairman Marsha Bohr and committee members Jane Palmer, Edith Maguire, 
Betty Urban, Marcy Fowler, Maybelle Wolfe, Betty Duker and Ricki de Kramer, 
members collected treasures for months -- including all the costumes that Jane 
Brewer and her late husband, Dr. Lyman Brewer, wore to the annual Bachelors 
Ball.

<P>
Of course, there's always the preview party: Carol Bramhall, Diane Bedford

Rose Mary Mitchell hurriedly moved her pink-clothed tables indoors because of 
chilly vibes at the drop-in luncheon for friends, including Eileen Zimmerman, 
Dee Maecheling, Peggy Galbraith, Joni Baker, Gabriella Barrett, Cheryl Baker, 
Penny Bianchi and more; those in woollies were toasty, but those in spring 
couture were frosty. 
</P>
<P>
UPSCALE: J. Shelton Ellis Jr., executive director of Gump's, says that La Scala 
Museum, adjacent to Milan's famed Opera House, and the government of Italy have

The Chrysalis Center raises funds Thursday at the Biltmore to assist Downtown 
Skid Row residents. Johnny Mountain will emcee. . . . The Assistance League of 
Pasadena's "Evening of Polo" was chaired by Sharon Pelton, aided by president 
Lynn Paulson. It enables the league to maintain its California House for Senior 
Citizens. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Music Center Reachout Committee partied at Doheny Mansion for its 15th 
anniversary chaired by Delores S. Kerr. . . . Edie Frere chaired the Emphysema 
Foundation "Breath of Life" family day at Magic Castle in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
PLAUDITS: To the Huntington Library for outfoxing the weather. Its Christmas 
Party was blown out by wind in December; its Easter Egg Hunt was done in by 
rain, but Saturday was an OK day for a crowd loving the flowers at the 
library's spring luncheon and garden party. 
</P>
<P>
KEEPING UP: Smoke Tree Ranch in Palm Springs has been awash in frivolity such

TAKE MY WORD!: NOT RELUCTANT TO 'DENIGRATE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MIDDLETON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man named Jim Marugg, who evidently has an admirable concern for the niceties 
of language and for precision in its use, has written to ask, "Would you join 
me in stamping out the word denigrate? It is always misused, it being mistaken 
for disparage, I suppose; whereas it is clear from its root that it means 
blacken (one's reputation) or defame. I thought I had the job pretty well done 
about 10 years ago, but it has popped up again. 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect reticent isn't far behind, mistaken as it was for reluctant some 
years back. 
</P>
<P>
"These things are contagious. One misuse begets another. No one is immune." 
</P>
<P>
I feel as though I must have slept through something or other, but I admire Mr. 
Marugg's discriminatory powers. There's a hiatus in my consciousness regarding 
the temporary loss of the word denigrate. I hadn't noticed its disappearance; 
nor had I marked the confusion of reticent with reluctant. I don't mean to 
imply that Mr. Marugg simply imagined these phenomena. I wouldn't be at all 
surprised if denigrate had disappeared in a total eclipse for 10 years or so, 
and I just hadn't noticed. 
</P>
<P>
As for the reticent-reluctant muddle, I feel reasonably sure that it is quite 
common, since the two words not only bear a resemblance to each other, but have 
similar, though not identical, meanings. Reticent means "shy, reserved, 
undemonstrative," while reluctant means "unwilling, grudging." 
</P>
<P>
Reticence implies a less forceful personality than reluctance. The reluctant 
person might go along grudgingly, but he'd probably let you know that he 
thought it was a lousy idea. The reticent one, going along, perhaps grudgingly, 
would keep his feelings to himself. Refusal to go along at all displays 
reluctance, not reticence. Stating your unwillingness is a mark of reluctance; 
saying nothing at all or just shrugging and saying, "What the heck . . ." would 
be a pretty good sign of reticence. The two words are so close to each other 
that it would be astonishing if they didn't occasionally cross-breed, but they 
are hardly interchangeable. 
</P>
<P>
Most people are quite casual about words, taking them for granted and giving 
them hardly a thought. The other day, I heard a perfect example of this 
thoughtless use of words -- an example of a misuse we've all heard thousands of 
times. During an excellent show on National Public Radio called "Morning 
Edition," an articulate young woman, discussing the famous pyramid that has 
been installed at the entrance to the Louvre, mentioned that the pyramid is 
"literally the tip of an iceberg." 
</P>
<P>
In time that would lead to a lake, or, au moins, a wading pool, at the Louvre. 
Literally means, literally, "literally," that is, "according to the letter, not 
figuratively or metaphorically." So if that rather large pyramid were literally 
the tip of an iceberg, and a spring thaw hit Paris -- well, think about it. 
</P>
<P>
"It literally blew me away!" "She was literally coming apart!" "He was climbing 
the walls! Literally!" I'll never forget hearing a senator complain about 
having "Senate bills literally coming out my ears." A disconcerting image. As 
far as I know, no one has actually taken a count, but it is my impression that 
this application of literally is the most common misusage in the language, at 
least in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
There's another blooper that has proliferated in recent years. Apparently, a 
lot of people think penultimate is a really impressive word, and, without 
checking it out for meaning, they use it to mean "the most" or "the last word." 
"Man! That movie was the penultimate!" "The skiing up there is the absolute 
penultimate!" The word actually means, "almost the last" -- paene, almost and 
ultimus, last. It is properly used for "next to last." "They blew the pennant 
race in the penultimate game of the season." 
</P>
<P>
Possibly those who misuse penultimate harbor a vague mental overlay of 
penultimate with another polysyllabic p-word, pluperfect. The pluperfect is 
essentially a verb tense. Verb tenses have apparently been given short, if any, 
shrift in the schools during recent decades, so for any of you who might have 
missed out, the present perfect is, typically, "I have arrived"; the 
pluperfect, or past perfect, is one step removed from the present perfect: "I 
had arrived." 
</P>
<P>
I've often heard pluperfect used in a non-grammatical sense, as in "That guy is 
a pluperfect swine" and less respectable variations on the theme. Purists will 
argue that "pluperfect," meaning "more than perfect," is an abomination, since 
perfection is an absolute and cannot be improved upon. They might as well knock 
the coach who says, "I'm leaving him in at tackle because he always gives a 
hundred and fifty percent." 
</P>
<P>
"A hundred and fifty percent" is superpluperfect, but sensible people accept 
that sort of thing as locker-room-style poetic license, I think.

HIGH-ENERGY DISPUTE

<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding "Fear of Fusion," I haven't heard such astounding drivel since the 
Carter Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The quote attributed to Paul Ehrlich: ". . . like giving a machine gun to an 
idiot child," actually came from one of his articles, "An Ecologist's 
Perspective on Nuclear Power," published in Public Issue Report from the 
Federation of American Scientists, May/June 1975. Ehrlich's specialty is not 
energy, but population control, which, he has stated, should be accomplished 
through coercive means if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Commoner, a one-time presidential candidate, is a self-avowed Marxist. I 
quote from his article on the energy crisis ("A Reporter at Large; Energy III," 
the New Yorker, February 16, 1976): "Economists and other students of 
capitalism will recognize that the basic ideas I have discussed are among those 
first put forward by Karl Marx." 
</P>
<P>
What these two, and others that you didn't include, have in common is not that 
they are ecologists; they are not. Neither are they particularly concerned 
about mankind's survival as a whole. They are anti-energy activists dedicated 
to the development of the industrialized free world so as to achieve their 
bucolic vision of Utopia. 
</P>
<P>
If this seems extreme, imagine Commoner explaining to a throng of 
famine-stricken citizens of any Third World nation you choose that they will 
continue to die by the thousands while a bunch of elitist limousine liberals 
withholds the solution to their problems. Tell them, Mr. Commoner, that they 
must die so that we can pursue your Weltanschauung. Mr. Ehrlich, tell the young 
mother with the infant struggling against acute malnutrition that her child and 
millions like him must die because you don't trust any government with a cheap, 
abundant source of energy.

HIGH-ENERGY DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the spirit of their 19th-Century predecessors, today's neo-Luddites such as 
Jeremy Rifkin and his ilk are not out to protect nature or the environment; 
they are out to destroy science and technology ("Fear of Fusion" by Paul 
Ciotti, April 19). 
</P>
<P>
For decades they have called for sacrificing the quality of human life made 
possible by the abundance of natural energy sources for the sake of fish, trees 
and inanimate nature. If the preservation of nature were their concern, one 
would think that they would enthusiastically welcome the discovery of the 
process of cold fusion, which could provide a source of clean, pollution-free 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, they react quite differently: An inexhaustible energy source would 
give man the ability to destroy the planet's "fragile balance," Rifkin argues. 
</P>
<P>
In the pre-industrial age to which Rifkin wishes to return us, the average life 
expectancy was 30 years, and the "excess" population was wiped out by periodic 
famines and plagues. This is still the case in the non-industrialized parts of 
the world, such as Ethiopia. Rifkin's argument bespeaks not of a love of 
nature, but of a profound hatred for man and for any human progress that has 
been made beyond that sorry state.

UNDESERVED PUBLICITY FOR 'SHADOWS'

<P>
Re "Shadows on a Legend," I feel the record must be set straight (regarding) 
the gossipmonger's false story about Randolph Scott, whom we have known since 
1936. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Scott was the finest gentleman in every way, best husband and father, too. 
</P>
<P>
We enjoyed his friendship through his 43 years of happy marriage, therefore, 
positively state that Charles Higham's story is a fantasy.

UNDESERVED PUBLICITY FOR 'SHADOWS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article, "Shadows on a Legend" (by Garry Abrams, March 24), gives 
undeserved publicity and recognition to two authors whose journalistic 
credibility has been questioned on several previous occasions. Their book is 
composed of false allegations, rumors and contorted interviews. Simple facts 
such as how my grandfather died are incorrect as are the insulting charges 
about my father, Randolph Scott. At least twice, the authors used anonymous 
sources casting doubt over the specific allegations as well as the integrity of 
the total book. 
</P>
<P>
It was hard to believe that The Times would give such prominent attention to a 
book that maliciously strives to tarnish the reputation of distinguished 
individuals. The book reads like a hard bound copy of the National Enquirer. 
Its main goal is not enlightenment of the reader but enrichment of the authors. 
Why would you consider helping them?

STAFF OF MAINE RESORT MAKES MUSIC OF NOTE

CENTER LOVELL, Maine 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By day, David Nish garnishes food in the kitchen. At night, Nish, a talented 
pianist who graduated from the Juilliard School and is working on his 
doctorate, changes roles. He gives recitals of Beethoven, Chopin and Bartok and 
takes part in chamber music concerts. 
</P>
<P>
Alice Porte is a cabaret singer with a distinctive voice and a wonderful sense 
of the comical. As the lead in a recent performance of Stephen Sondheim's 
"Company," she brought down the house. She clearly has a chance of ending up on 
Broadway someday. She's a waitress. 
</P>
<P>
And Gloria Borbridge, an office worker, stands out as a high soprano. Recently 
she starred as Miss Pinkerton in "The Old Maid and the Thief," an opera by Gian 
Carlo Menotti, and as Mrs. Ford in "The Merry Wives of Windsor." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Talented Staff 
</P>
<P>
These three young people are only a small part of the talented, youthful 
aspiring musicians who make up the staff at Quisisana, a somewhat unusual and 
very popular resort for lovers of good music here on Lake Kezar. Its 
advertisements, promising a combination of "Maine and Mozart," tell it all. 
</P>
<P>
Quisisana's musical staff (the ratio of guests to workers is 2 to 1) is 
recruited from some of the nation's most prestigious music schools, including 
the Oberlin Conservatory of Music, the Eastman School of Music and the New 
England Conservatory of Music. 
</P>
<P>
Jobs are coveted, and some of the staffers come back year after year. 
Eventually many go on to successful professional careers. Cellist/cabin boy 
Greg Dubay, for example, has just lined up a job with the Honolulu Symphony 
Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
During the day Quisisana is much like other summer resorts. It has two white 
sandy beaches, plenty of rowboats, sailboats, motorboats and canoes, plus water 
skiing and windsurfing. There's badminton, volleyball and shuffleboard. And 
there are enough clay courts to handle the very large tennis crowd it attracts. 
</P>
<P>
Guests can go climbing on Mt. Sabbatus three miles away, and there's an 18-hole 
golf course down the road. Bridge is also a popular activity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Precise Meal Times 
</P>
<P>
The dining room serves its three meals at precise times. Arrive late and you 
might go hungry. Guests are seated together at community tables for the length 
of their stay. (Quisisana policy requires a week's stay, with Saturday arrival 
and departure.) Most tables seat four to eight people. 
</P>
<P>
Lasting friendships have been made. Some guests who met at Quisisana (Italian 
for "a place where one heals oneself") return at the same time every year, even 
though many don't see each other during the winter months. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel is very informal. No jackets or ties required in the evening. The 
staffers are encouraged to mingle with guests during their time off. 
</P>
<P>
During the day you can find clues that everywhere there is something different, 
something special, about the place. As one leaves the dining room it is not at 
all unusual to hear a high-pitched opera voice coming from the kitchen. When 
someone has a birthday the entire dining room staff joins in the celebration, 
which resembles a scene from "Aida." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Music All Day 
</P>
<P>
There is music, somewhere, all day long. You hear sounds of a flute or a 
clarinet on the tennis court. Everywhere someone is rehearsing or just playing 
or singing for personal enjoyment. But it is in the evening that the place 
really comes to life. 
</P>
<P>
Dinner is early (6:30 p.m.), so it does not interfere with the evening's 
musical fare. The waiters, waitresses, busboys and kitchen helpers hustle to 
finish their chores. They change into costumes. The guests stroll on 
pine-shaded paths to the Music Hall overlooking the 10-mile-long lake. Then 
it's on with the show. 
</P>
<P>
The entertainment ranges from an evening of instrumental music to the "Best of 
Broadway." There are professionally staged operas and cabarets. 
</P>
<P>
Quisi, as it is endearingly called by many of the guests who have vacationed 
here for many years, is more like an adult camp than a luxury hotel. Most of 
its 150 guests live in cabins on the beach or deep in the woods. 
</P>
<P>
Even the bungalows have musical names: Intermezzo, Pianissimo and Sonata. Daily 
rates for the cabins during the peak periods of July and August are between $95 
and $120 per person, with three meals. In the larger, multiroom lodge, rates 
are a bit lower. 
</P>
<P>
During the off-peak period, June 22 to July 1, rates are $75-$80. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cookies and Milk 
</P>
<P>
Though drinks are served at meals, Quisi doesn't attract a drinking crowd. It 
has no bar. After the evening's entertainment, which never lasts later than 11 
p.m., a snack of lemonade, milk and cookies is served. Within half an hour 
everyone has turned in. 
</P>
<P>
Quisi attracts a largely professional crowd from across the nation -- doctors, 
lawyers, journalists, judges and business people. 
</P>
<P>
A New England magazine,DownEast, described Quisi's guests as "a bookish crowd, 
one that does the New York Times crossword puzzle in one sitting -- in ink." 
</P>
<P>
Quisi was founded in 1917 as a resort for musicians and music lovers. Over the 
years it has had about half a dozen owners and, until recently, always retained 
its original flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Then the hotel began falling on hard times. Its reputation for its food and the 
quality of its music began to slip. But the hotel's loyal guests wouldn't let 
it die. To the rescue came Jane Orans, a 53-year-old widow who had been coming 
to Quisi with her family as a guest for many years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Back to Its Roots 
</P>
<P>
She bought the hotel and, according to some guests who have vacationed here for 
30 years or longer, has returned it to its original character. 
</P>
<P>
Quisi's most famous guest was Vladimir Horowitz, who came in 1962 to prepare 
for his return to the stage after a long retirement. Old-timers remember that 
he didn't give a performance, but guests used to surround his cottage to 
eavesdrop on his practice sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Which leaves today's guests pondering the question: Is there a future Vladimir 
Horowitz on the staff? 
</P>
<P>

Center Lovell is a three-hour drive from Boston, seven hours from New York. 
Best bet is to fly into Portland, Me., then drive 1 1/2 hours to Center Lovell. 
For a fee of $60 Cuisisana will send a driver to pick you up at the Portland 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
For more information on Quisisana, contact Jane Orans, P.O. Box 142, Larchmont, 
N.Y. 10538, (914) 833-0293 (until May 30). Or write to the hotel at Center 
Lovell, Me. 04016. After May 30, call (207) 925-3500.

ST. JOSEPH IS HOME TO WHERE JAMES ONCE ROAMED

<P>
ST. JOSEPH, Mo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Local historian Sheridan Logan's voice gets a touch of melancholy when he talks 
about his hometown, here in the heart of the heartland. 
</P>
<P>
"The young people mostly go away, so there hasn't been enough new to take over 
the old," he says. "So the whole town is sort of like a museum." 
</P>
<P>
That pretty well sums it up. This once-lively frontier town of fur trappers, 
Westward adventurers and Pony Express riders thrived during the 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
Now St. Joe, as the locals like to call their city, is mostly a place to visit 
if you happen to be on your way to another destination. 
</P>
<P>
But it is a worthwhile stop if you're interested in Western Americana, 
Victorian mansions or eclectic museums. 
</P>
<P>
A horse-and-outlaw nostalgia predominates in this historic town of 76,000 on 
the bluffs of the Missouri River, 50 miles north of Kansas City. It's "where 
the Pony Express began and Jesse James ended." 
</P>
<P>
The first Pony Express rider galloped out from St. Joseph on April 3, 1860. He 
had applied for the hazardous job from a help-wanted ad that asked for "young, 
skinny, wiry fellows, not over 18. Must be expert riders willing to risk death 
daily. Orphans preferred. Wages $25 per week." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hostile Indians 
</P>
<P>
The teen-age riders, who had to contend with hostile Indians and adverse 
weather, changed their horses every 10 to 15 miles and rode about 10 m.p.h. for 
an average of 75 to 100 miles a day. 
</P>
<P>
The mail they carried was destined for Sacramento, nearly 2,000 miles west. It 
usually arrived 10 days later. The cost was $5 for a half-ounce letter. 
</P>
<P>
All this is explained at the Pony Express Museum in the original stables that 
once held 200 horses. The museum provides a 12-minute historical film, assorted 
displays and exhibits from old photographs to period blacksmith and wheelwright 
shops. 
</P>
<P>
Two blocks away a small wood-frame building attracts visitors who want to see 
the house where Jesse James was killed on April 3, 1882. 
</P>
<P>
The notorious "king of the outlaws" was living there with his wife and two 
children under an assumed name when he was shot from behind by a member of his 
gang for the $10,000 reward. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, souvenir hunters have snitched small hunks of plaster from the 
original bullet hole in the wall so that the spot measures nearly six by three 
inches (it's now covered with glass for protection). 
</P>
<P>
Somewhat at odds in ambiance is the sentimental cross-stitch sampler, "God 
Bless Our Home," crafted by James' mother, which hangs above it. 
</P>
<P>
Next door the four-story Patee House Museum, an 1858 luxury hotel and the Pony 
Express headquarters in the 1860s, overshadows the James house. 
</P>
<P>
Two floors are devoted to exhibits representing early communications and 
transportation, including an 1860 Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad wood-burning 
steam locomotive, horse-drawn buggies and the replica of an early railway depot 
and mail car. 
</P>
<P>
A large section is devoted to recreated shops of the late 19th Century, among 
them a barbershop, post office, bank and the office of a dentist, Walter 
Cronkite Sr., the former news anchorman's father. 
</P>
<P>
The 1854 Buffalo Saloon recreated here provides soft drinks, popcorn and the 
music of ragtime composer Scott Joplin, played by a local pianist. 
</P>
<P>
In 1850 city founder Joseph Robidoux (the town was not named after him, but 
after his patron saint) built seven row houses for newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
Now known as Robidoux Row (it's on the National Register of Historic Places), 
the four remaining units have been restored and partially refurnished, some 
with original Robidoux memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Attractions 
</P>
<P>
Depending on your tastes, you'll other museums here such as: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The 1881 Kember Home, a 15-room Queen Anne mansion with seven fireplaces, 
chock full of Victorian furnishings and memorabilia, from old-time glass baby 
bottles in the birthing room to original funeral notices from the 1850s and 
'60s (funerals were still held in the home on a doily-covered oak hallway 
table). 
</P>
<P>
 -- The St. Joseph Museum, a 43-room, three-floor 1879 Gothic mansion with 
Tiffany stained-glass windows. It holds a fine collection of Indian artifacts 
and local and natural history exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Missouri Theater, a 1927 movie palace with a Persian/Egyptian decor, 
renovated in the late 1970s for $1.25 million. It serves as St. Joseph's home 
for the performing arts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The 1881 Schuster-Rader Mansion, restored and furnished with Victorian 
antiques as a tour house and B&amp;B. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Missouri Valley Trust Co., a beautiful 1860 bank with massive Victorian 
wood carvings on the walls, ceiling and cashier cages, plus tile floors, leaded 
glass windows, even a fireplace in the lobby. The vault walls are reinforced 
with vertical railroad rails. 
</P>
<P>
St. Joseph also offers a few off-the-wall attractions. "You can even have a 
tour of a funeral home here," says historian Logan, "but they just don't 
advertise it." 
</P>
<P>
A bit too macabre? Then how about a tour of the Psychiatric Museum, one of five 
in the nation? In a former hospital ward, the museum chronicles mental health 
treatment and techniques spanning 400 years. 
</P>
<P>
Among dozens of relics, devices and contraptions on exhibit, the museum holds a 
collection of reproductions of bygone psychiatric "treatment" devices, such as 
the 17th-Century Bath of Surprise, where the patient was dropped from an 
overhead scaffolding (like a hangman's) into a huge wooden tub filled with ice 
water (ancient shock therapy). 
</P>
<P>
And the 19th-Century "Tranquilizer Chair," where disturbed patients were 
confined (sometimes for six months or longer) so that doctors could perform 
bloodletting or water dousing, when as many as 100 buckets of ice water would 
be dumped on them to bring them "back to their senses." 
</P>
<P>
St. Joseph also is the home of Aunt Jemima Pancake Flour, Big Chief school 
tablets and Stetson hats. 
</P>
<P>
The Stetson hat factory, in an industrial park about a mile south of the city 
limits, offers free tours where you can watch the likes of an Indiana Jones hat 
(a Stetson) evolve along a series of assembly lines. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, of course, you can stop in at its outlet and buy a hat, maybe a 
Western straw or a suede cloth cap. 
</P>

Despite last month's tragic Alaska oil spill, none of the nine ships scheduled 
to sail through the Gulf this summer has changed itineraries. 
</P>
<P>
Only nine of the 19 ships heading north will be sailing in Prince William Sound 
and the Gulf of Alaska. The other 10 will cruise the Inside Passage between 
Vancouver and pristine Glacier Bay, more than 400 miles from the spill area and 
in the opposite direction to the prevailing oil flow. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prince William Sound 
</P>
<P>
The first cruise ship scheduled to reach the Gulf this season is Regency 
Cruises' Regent Sun, sailing from Vancouver on May 14. The Regent Sun and 
sister ship Regent Sea cross Prince William Sound on northbound seven-day 
itineraries and call at Valdez on the reverse southbound sailings. 
</P>
<P>
"A few passengers have called and asked how it might affect their cruise," said 
marketing vice president Jennifer Urquhart, "but we've had no cancellations. 
They're worried about the environmental impact, but not afraid it will ruin the 
cruise. . . . I think they're concerned whether they'll see the ecological 
damage." 
</P>
<P>
Urquhart said Regency is in constant touch with Valdez. "While we're very 
concerned about the ecological damage, it's not impacting our plans at all," 
she said. "We could change and go to other ports, but our commitment to Valdez 
came about because people want to see the oil pipeline." 
</P>
<P>
Cunard's Sagafjord, which pioneered the Gulf of Alaska itinerary five years 
ago, will see no changes in its 10- and 11-day Route of the Glaciers 
itineraries that cross Prince William Sound and the Kenai fiords and call at 
Valdez and Seward. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Travel Advisory 
</P>
<P>
"The ship won't be there until the second week in June," said Cunard 
spokeswoman Susan Alpert. "There's been no travel advisory against cruise ships 
coming into the (Valdez) area. We wouldn't want to go up there if it were going 
to damage the ship. And our passengers are not going to be in the water or on 
shore at any of the islands." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Jim Sano, general manager of Innerasia Expeditions in San 
Francisco, says his company's little 10-passenger boat Discovery, which sails 
from Cordova in the eastern end of Prince William Sound, has had some 
cancellations, including a group from the Cincinnati Museum of Natural History 
who elected to wait for another year for their Alaskan wilderness cruise. 
</P>
<P>
"Prior to the oil spill, our season was completely sold out, but we had some 
cancellations afterward, due to the media (coverage)," Sano says. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to persuade some passengers that the whole sound is not covered in 
oil. We usually land on beaches and dig for clams and fish for salmon. The 
people who canceled were significantly worried that these sorts of experiences 
would be spoiled." 
</P>
<P>
But Sano said that Mike Wiedmer of the Alaska Fish and Game Department reported 
no influence on the wildlife along the Discovery's itinerary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spill Has Drifted 
</P>
<P>
"The spill has drifted southwest out of the sound, and our cruises operate on 
the eastern end of the sound, so we're not affected," Sano said. "Since our 
ship carries only 10 passengers, we can pretty easily maneuver around and get 
to places the big ships cannot." 
</P>
<P>
Discovery captain Chuck Irvine recently flew over the vessel's normal route, 
and Stephen Johnson, a 40-year resident of Cordova who works with Innerasia, 
went ashore to check on the island beaches where the boat usually lands. 
Neither saw any damage on the eastern side of the sound, Sano said. 
</P>
<P>
"But," he added, "I think if you were to go up to the west side you'd see 
considerable environmental impact." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman at San Francisco-based World Explorer Cruises said its ship 
Universe will continue to Valdez on all of its sailings. 
</P>
<P>
"We may try to get someone from the Coast Guard or an environmental group to 
come on board there and speak to the passengers about the effect of the spill 
on the community," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, I have a feeling people may be curious to see for themselves what this 
biggest spill in the United States is like." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Line Keeps Schedule 
</P>
<P>
After firsthand investigations, a team from Seattle-based Holland America 
decided not to change any of the scheduled seven-day sailings of its flagship 
Rotterdam between Vancouver and Seward, all of which call briefly at Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
"We made a trip up there last week to check it out," said a spokesman. "We flew 
over the face of Columbia Glacier and up College Fjord. There's nothing there; 
(the oil) didn't go in there. You can't see anything until Seward, and that 
should be cleared up by the beginning of the season. But environmentally it's 
awful." 
</P>
<P>
He said Holland America Westours and its employees have contributed $100,000 
toward wildlife rescue efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Skinner added that his company has had very few cancellations, probably no more 
than the normal fallout for any season. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based Princess Cruises, with three ships scheduled to cruise the 
Gulf of Alaska and the Columbia Glacier area, will also stay with its published 
itineraries for the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no interruption to shipping," said vice president Max Hall. "We adhere 
to what the Coast Guard tells us, and we haven't heard anything from the Coast 
Guard, pilots or port authorities, even from the port of Valdez, so we assume 
everything will be normal." 
</P>

In other cruise news, Aloha Pacific's Monterey, tied up at at a pier in 
Honolulu since March 4 in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization filing, began 
cruising again April 22. The nine-month-old line and its U.S. flagship were 
bailed out with $1.7 million in operating expenses, mostly from Pacifico 
Creative Services, a tour wholesale affiliate of Japan Creative Tours (JALPAK) 
and a subsidiary of Japan Air Lines, and Sequoia Ventures, an affiliate of 
Bechtel Investments. 
</P>
<P>
The court is reviewing a proposed $12-million reorganization plan that provides 
for a new company, S. S. Monterey Management Co. Inc., to be the general 
managing partner. There is also an agreement under negotiation for a U.S. hotel 
company (Radisson) to take over the hotel management and an affiliated tour 
company (Carlson Travel Group) to take over marketing for the ship. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers who had booked cruises canceled during the bankruptcy proceedings 
will be offered special packages.

LLAMAS HELP WILDERNESS TREKKERS TO NEW HEIGHTS

After seven years of steady growth, llama trekkers are flocking to Colorado, 
where backpacking has become a big hit. 
</P>
<P>
Although llamas can't carry full-grown adults, the animals can easily shoulder 
camping essentials as well as frills. 
</P>
<P>
This includes the heavy or bulky items hikers wouldn't carry, such as real food 
(not freeze-dried) and bottles of wine, instead of packets of Kool-Aid. 
</P>
<P>
A llama is a strong, undemanding porter. For the wilderness traveler they offer 
help in reaching out-of-the-way places, as well as chic companionship. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sign of Status 
</P>
<P>
"Llama trekking is a status symbol," says Pegg Osowski, a nurse from Grand 
Rapids, Mich., who was brushing the thick fur of Dudley, an 8-year-old male 
llama. 
</P>
<P>
The pair walked 10 miles over a steep trail to an open-air tea party at glacial 
Sanchez Lake, then one-quarter of a mile more to a 10,000-foot ridge above a 
color-splotched wildflower meadow. 
</P>
<P>
From there, on the Continental Divide, they could see a ring of snowcapped 
peaks below them. "You can go backpacking or hike in the woods in Michigan or 
almost anywhere," Osowski said. "But to get to go with llamas . . . that's 
status." 
</P>
<P>
"Being out in the woods and not having to work is what attracted me," said 
Barry Fisher, a 28-year-old psychiatrist from Pittsburgh. Fisher is reclining 
in a camp chair, under a pitched canopy, warming his toes by a campfire. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher and Osowski are guests on an Elk River Valley Llama Co. trip, camped in 
a pine grove at Trail Creek in Colorado's Zirkel Wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
Llamas have been used as pack animals for centuries in the Peruvian Andes, 
where their good-natured demeanor, stamina, sure-footedness and relatively 
small size make them preferred over less-agile burros, mules or horses. 
</P>
<P>
The average weight of a llama is 350 pounds, and it can carry a load of about a 
third of that. They require little water, their padded feet are easy on fragile 
mountain ecology and they thrive at high altitudes, making them well suited for 
the Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not real friendly or affectionate, like a dog," Fisher says, "but they 
are very tolerant and easy to work with." 
</P>
<P>
Llamas will follow whoever pulls on their lead. Tug on a thick, 10-foot rope 
and they step merrily along on split hoofs, happy to keep up a steady pace. 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Creek trip starts with a 1,000-foot gain in elevation over a 
five-mile route. The path coils through forests of aspen and fragrant pines, 
crossing glimmering creeks good for fishing or picnics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Well-Equipped Camp 
</P>
<P>
The first day across the Continental Divide leads to a camp complete with tall 
tents, cots equipped with foam mattresses, sleeping bags and flannel liners. 
</P>
<P>
On day-hikes from this camp, hikers set the pace. Gameness and good spirits are 
more important than fitness. 
</P>
<P>
"We get all kinds of people," said Bonnie Lyttle, a 29-year-old guide. "One 
woman told us she started preparing six months before her trip -- running, 
walking, doing aerobics and lifting weights. She finally admitted that she 
expected a lot rougher trip." 
</P>
<P>
Another trekker confessed that he had done nothing special to get in shape. 
"I'm not in great shape, and that cot sure feels good after a day of hiking, 
but I've been ready to go again every morning." 
</P>
<P>
Hikers in their 70s have successfully completed these wilderness trips with 
raves about the hospitality, plus the rewards of dining on llama-carted menu 
items such as steak and lobster brochette, barbecued Cornish game hens, grilled 
halibut steaks, lemon-marinated chicken, fire-baked sourdough bread and fresh 
cherry cheesecake. 
</P>
<P>
There's wonderful untouched scenery to enjoy. Climbs can include the 
12,180-foot top of Mt. Zirkel. And there are special fishing holes. It's an 
ideal experience for first-time campers, and as challenging as hikers want to 
make it. 
</P>
<P>
Other llama packers offer somewhat different trips, from day-hikes to weeklong 
excursions. 
</P>
<P>
In between the extremes of do-it-yourself and do-nothing-yourself are the 
"moving" llama trips offered by Robert Getz of Lost Trail Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Guests spend five days hiking and moving from camp to camp in the San Juan 
Mountains and the Weminuche Wilderness between historic Silverton and Creede. 
</P>
<P>
After a first-night's stay at Lost Trail Ranch, originally a stagecoach stop, 
participants hike among rugged 10,000- and 11,000-foot peaks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
The cost of most llama trips averages between $75 to $125 per person a day, 
including all gear and supplies other than personal items.

FLIGHT A DELIGHT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Remember when it was pleasant to fly -- even tourist class? Well, there's still 
one airline in North and South America that makes you feel special. It's Lan 
Chile. It has a sensible seat arrangement. On the long flight from Miami to 
Santiago, Chile, it was two-three-two. There was a full and well-trained crew 
who started by handing out free newspapers. We were served free cocktails, then 
a good hot meal with a choice of wine. After the meal, free liqueurs were 
offered. Even on 1 1/2-hour local flights a hot meal was served. During the 
flights the restrooms were frequently checked and we found them always neat and 
clean. There were free movies. Small souvenir gifts were distributed as a 
memento. So if you want a wonderful flight, we suggest you try Lan Chile. We 
enjoyed it.

THEIR GOLDEN MEMORIES ABOARD ROYAL SCOTSMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gena Reisner's story, "Scotland By Train" (April 2), was most interesting, 
especially (in mentioning) the Royal Scotsman. In celebration of our 50th 
wedding anniversary, my wife and I took the six-day tour. Words cannot describe 
the luxury of this train. We had a stateroom, including all private facilities. 
The dining car was used by Earl Haig in World War I. The train includes 
carriages from the late Victorian and Edwardian periods and is limited to 28 
people. And side trips to such things as historic sites and castles not open to 
the public are arranged. It is about $9,000 per couple for the six-day tour, 
but everything is included. We consider the food the best of any train in the 
world, and excellent wines are served. A red carpet is rolled out and you are 
piped aboard the Royal Scotsman at Waverley Station in Edinburgh for either the 
three- or six-day trip into the Scottish Highlands. For further information, 
contact your travel agent or Abercrombie &amp; Kent International, 1420 
Kensington Road, Oak Brook, Ill. 60521, (800) 323-7308.

CONSUMER REPORT: AMTRAK AGAIN ASKING FOR PERMANENT FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congress again has been asked to establish a "dedicated funding source" to 
support Amtrak, the nation's passenger rail operator. 
</P>
<P>
In his annual budget request to the Senate Appropriations Committee, Amtrak 
President Graham Claytor asked the government for $712 million in funding and 
equipment purchase and improvement grants for fiscal 1989-90. That's $132 
million more than the current funding level. A decision may be forthcoming 
before Congress adjourns this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Claytor, in an effort to end his yearly "cap-in-hand" appeal to 
legislators, proposed -- and not for the first time -- that a special trust 
fund, supported by the gasoline tax, be established to maintain the passenger 
rail system in years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
The money would go to Amtrak, and the federal government would not have to 
haggle each year over Amtrak financing. 
</P>
<P>
Claytor's proposal has been turned down before. Some observers believe, 
however, that his chances of trust fund approval improves every day. 
</P>
<P>
Many transportation experts are attaching new importance to passenger train 
service, mostly because of what is happening in other modes of travel. 
</P>
<P>
Many of our interstate highways, local roads and bridges are badly in need of 
upgrading. The federal government has acknowledged this. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Airports Jammed 
</P>
<P>
Our airports are jammed. They need massive and rapid expansion to cope with the 
expected increase in volume. 
</P>
<P>
It is in this environment that Claytor made his latest appeal for funding until 
such time as Amtrak might be able to make a profit. His reasoning, and that of 
other Amtrak boosters, is sound. 
</P>
<P>
Trains are clean and energy-efficient, probably more so than any other mode of 
transportation. They are safe and reliable and relieve traffic pressure on 
freeways and airways. 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak has become the nation's sixth-largest carrier, trailing only four 
airlines and Greyhound buses. It transported 22 million people last year. 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak's survival will not be cheap. Track maintenance is costly. The rail 
operator's major problem right now, however, is a chronic shortage of rolling 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
Without equipment, expansion is impossible. Without expansion, Amtrak's chances 
of getting by without a government subsidy are slim. 
</P>
<P>
Expansion opportunities exist. Claytor said that six states are asking Amtrak 
to establish new routes. The states were turned down only because Amtrak had no 
trains available. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposition to Subsidies 
</P>
<P>
No real expansion can be undertaken when Amtrak is dependent on the good will 
of Congress for its funding. There even have been times when some congressmen 
have called for an end to all Amtrak subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
A certain irony exists in the proposal that the trust be funded by a gasoline 
tax. Those who pay the tax would be helping to build and expand an alternative 
transportation system. 
</P>
<P>
They may find one day that such a system could whisk them to Southland cities 
in 125 m.p.h. comfort, far from the crush of freeway traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak's business has been improving. The rail operator's passenger loads are 
up 20% in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Also, in that same period, Amtrak has reduced its dependency on government 
assistance from more than half of its costs to just 30% in the last fiscal 
year. So encouraging have the results been that a bill before Congress seeks 
binding government support. 
</P>
<P>
The dozen senators who authored the bill said that such a commitment was 
necessary in the interests of "a balanced transportation system." 
</P>
<P>
With that kind of sentiment in Congress, with the states calling for new rail 
transportation services, and with no immediate end to the problems of our 
congested airports and freeways, Claytor's call for permanent funding may 
finally be answered.

THE TIMES SHOPPER: CENTER'S SHOPS ARE HIGH-CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER MERIN, Merin is a New York City free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The shops at the World Financial Center, lower Manhattan's new soaring granite 
and reflective glass office towers, offer high-class merchandise in an elegant 
setting. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by Cesar Pelli and Associates and opened last October, the center has 
a spacious, peaceful and calm environment. 
</P>
<P>
The complex's hub is the Winter Garden, a 120-foot-high, 
vaulted-steel-and-glass enclosed courtyard, flanked by handsome shops. 
Additional boutiques line marble-floored corridors and lobbies on the ground 
and second levels. And most shops have magnificent views of the Hudson River. 
</P>
<P>
The shop roster includes Ann Taylor, Mark Cross, Caswell-Massey, Bree and 
Bally, plus nationwide retailers and locals. 
</P>
<P>
Barneys New York, a leading clothier, offers men's clothes. 
Conservatively-styled business suits from Armani, Ferre, Zegna, Grieves and 
Hawkes, H. Huntsman &amp; Sons, Ralph Lauren, Hickey Freeman and other labels 
cost from $495 to $1,200. Custom-made suits are 20% more. Madras cotton ties 
are $13, conservative silk ties $22 and up. 
</P>
<P>
There are sporty cotton-and-linen blend sweaters for $105 and handsome 
Baker-Benjes tasseled loafers for $185. Rainwear ranges from Burberry's tan 
trench coats ($495) to Carol When's yellow slickers ($375). In addition, there 
are leather attache cases and wallets, beautiful cuff links and other 
accessories. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nautical Theme 
</P>
<P>
Northshore on the Hudson features private-label men's and women's casual 
clothing, often with a nautical theme. Cotton sweaters in colors are $80 and 
up, plaid shirts ($35) and shorts ($45) and cotton knit shirts ($48). Men's 
navy blazers are $280. Women's nautical-style suits with gold braid are about 
$500, soft terry robes $85 and patterned sweat shirts $110. 
</P>

"Mona Winks," by Rick Steves and Gene Openshaw, surveys art in 20 of Europe's 
top museums. It explains how to avoid miles of twisting hallways and boring 
exhibits, and details a collection of self-guided tours in text, room maps and 
where-to-start diagrams. Descriptions and reproductions of the treasures won't 
turn you into an art historian but should enhance your knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
The guide will serve as a quick introduction to the art, including supplemental 
information on the artists and their styles. The humor and opinions in the text 
will leave you enlightened but not overwhelmed. Museums and cultural areas in 
London, Paris, Amsterdam, Munich, Rome and Madrid are described. Other details 
include hours, admission costs, services and food (John Muir: $14.95). 
</P>

The "Travel Survival Kit" guides offer information to many destinations. Most 
recent editions are "Colombia" by Krzystof Dydynski ($11.95), "Bolivia" by 
Deanna Swaney ($10.95), "Papua" by Tony Wheeler ($11.95), "Solomon Islands" by 
David Harcombe ($9.95) and "West Africa" by Alex Newton ($12.95). 
</P>
<P>
The guides offer a concise text with a mixture of color photos and maps. The 
introduction and facts chapters preface the vignettes for cities or towns while 
introducing the history, culture and people of the area. 
</P>
<P>
The where-to-stay, eating and getting-around information is good for starters, 
especially in some countries where dramatic contrast and surprise often prevail 
(Lonely Planet).

HOT PROPERTY: 'CROCODILE' STAR SNAPS UP HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LINDA KOZLOWSKI, who co-starred with Paul Hogan in the "Crocodile Dundee" 
movies, has purchased a house in the Hollywood Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Sellers were CRAIG NELSON, star of the new ABC-TV program "Coach," who also 
played the father in the "Poltergeist" movies, and his wife, Doria. The Nelsons 
had lived in the house for four years when they decided to move to Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski paid the Nelsons about $725,000, and the Nelsons bought a 2-acre 
estate for nearly its $1.5-million asking price. 
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski's new house was described as "light and airy, with a lot of French 
doors and windows, but very private." It is behind gates in the Sunset Plaza 
area above the Sunset Strip. Built in 1957, it was updated recently and has 
four bedrooms and a lagoon-like swimming pool with a black bottom and a spa. 
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski apparently bought the house sight unseen, except in photos; she was 
in Australia when her business manager negotiated the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"She had seen the area enough to know that the house was a fabulous buy," said 
Ronna Brand, the Beverly Hills real estate broker who represented the Nelsons 
in their sale and purchase. She also represented them when they bought the 
Sunset Plaza house. 
</P>
<P>
The Nelsons bought in Malibu, "because Craig had visions of fairways when he 
saw the property there. He is such a golf fanatic," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
"And it is the perfect house for them, because ever since I've known Doria, she 
has taught tai chi chuen (a Chinese system of meditation and self defense). 
She's even producing a documentary (film) on it. The Malibu house was built for 
the previous owners using feng shui, the Chinese technique for arranging a 
floor plan." 
</P>
<P>
British rock-star GEORGE MICHAEL'S new, three-bedroom home in Santa Barbara, 
which is believed to be his first home in California, is modern with 5,669 
square feet on 5 acres with a swimming pool and tennis court. He paid about $3 
million for it and a half-acre next door, which he bought for added privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks Barton of Coldwell Banker was involved in that transaction as well as 
the sale of 5,669 acres of Oregon timberland for another Brit -- SIR JAMES 
GOLDSMITH, the corporate raider. Goldsmith sold the land to a Chicago 
industrialist for an estimated $5 million. Southern California real estate 
sources say Goldsmith has been looking for a house in the Los Angeles area for 
some time. 
</P>
<P>
Still up Santa Barbara way, the house of the late actor RONALD COLMAN, is back 
on the market for $5.5 million, says Paul O'Keeffe of Gibb Realty, who has the 
listing. 
</P>
<P>
The 1941 country house was sold in 1987 to a psychologist and his wife, who 
turned it into a Mediterranean villa. Investor Jon Sorrell, who sold the place 
to the psychologist, designed and supervised construction, preserving Colman's 
gated entrance to a driveway framed by olive trees. 
</P>
<P>
The Montecito Inn, opened by CHARLIE CHAPLIN and ROSCOE (FATTY) ARBUCKLE in 
1929, has been sold for $6.45 million. 
</P>
<P>
New owners are De Wayne and Kathy Copus, a Montecito couple who have managed 
the recently renovated 52-room hotel since last December. 
</P>
<P>
"We sold three apartment complexes of theirs, and then they bought the Inn," 
said Jim Slaught, a commercial broker with the Beaver-Free realty firm, who 
handled the sale. Jim Taylor, a developer of shopping centers all over 
California, and Rob Barrett, owner of the Pineapple Beach Club in Antigua, were 
the sellers. 
</P>
<P>
Real-life designer GAIL CLARIDGE, who recently appeared on "Designing Women," 
is getting ready to air her own TV show, on a cable network. "It will be like 
'Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous' but will focus entirely on decorating, 
featuring celebrities' homes and interviews of other designers," she said from 
her Northridge offices. 
</P>
<P>
Claridge just sold her Tarzana estate, with a house she restored and named 
"Cranberry Knoll," for $2.9 million, minus 2.2 acres. She subdivided the 
3.5-acre property and now has the remaining parcel for sale at $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
The buyer, a stockbroker, was represented by Chris Summer of Mike Glickman 
Realty. Claridge was represented by Jim Pascuci of Merrill Lynch and Cecelia 
Waeschle and Joyce Rey of Rodeo Realty. 
</P>
<P>
QUESTION OF THE WEEK: Will director STEVEN SPIELBERG and his actress wife, AMY 
IRVING, sell their remodeled and expanded Pacific Palisades dream house now 
that they plan to get a divorce? "No, not that I'm aware of," Rob Friedman, 
their spokesman, said after the divorce announcement last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The house, which is featured in the May issue of Architectural Digest, was 
purchased by the Spielbergs in '85, but they didn't move into it until January, 
1988, because of the extensive work, which included doubling its size -- to 
20,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Among other famous former owners who also remodeled the house, built at the 
turn of the century, were actor Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and singer Bobby Vinton. 
Cary Grant and Barbara Hutton rented the house from Fairbanks, and David O. 
Selznick purportedly lived there while producing "Gone With the Wind." 
</P>
<P>
Talk about hot property -- If you think home prices are astronomical here, get 
this: Beverly Hills realtor Stephen Shapiro returned the other day from 
Australia, where he had gone for the opening of a Hard Rock Cafe, and he said, 
"Little old houses on the beach in Sydney are going for (U.S.) $5 million to 
$20 million each."

DESIGNING A ZOO THAT MEETS NEEDS OF ANIMALS, CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL KORNMAN, Kornman is a free-lance writer who lives in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Keeping tarantulas cool was not something architects John Grist and Ara 
Zenobians had ever had to plan for in their work on Southland hotels, shopping 
centers and upscale homes. 
</P>
<P>
But they were hired to be flexible, think simple and work fast on what would be 
the most primitive-looking project in their portfolio -- the new Los Angeles 
children's zoo, which opens Friday at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a stretch in one sense," Grist said recently as workers prepared 
Adventure Island for the arrival of its first tenants. "We had to do a lot of 
research, but architects being the egotists that they are, think they can do 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
The $8.3-million job was complicated by the fact that the zoo's future 
occupants couldn't help the architects with the design. So the architects had 
to poll the zoo's in-house experts before they could sit down at the drawing 
board. 
</P>
<P>
And this was to be a zoo that doesn't look like a zoo. 
</P>
<P>
It had to incorporate an aviary, tide pool, petting zoo, an animal nursery 
built hacienda style, high-tech interactive devices, an outdoor theater for 
animal performances, a cave built into a mountain, a fast-food restaurant and 
bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The project would be built across four distinct biomes, or habitats, (mountain, 
meadow, desert, shoreline) that seem to flow from one to the other in a 
2.5-acre corner of the Los Angeles Zoo, which is located in Griffith Park near 
the interchange of the Golden State (5) and Ventura (134) freeways. 
</P>
<P>
The architects had to find ways to accommodate features they had never used in 
their previous work: A wired-for-sound mountain lion hopscotch game -- with 
squares having real paw prints cast in bronze -- on a busy pathway and a scary 
(but not too scary) vampire bat imaging device inside the cave that seems to 
move the bats from one stalactite to another, within reach of young visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Every phase of the project, from planning to completion, was monitored by the 
Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn., which raised the budget from donations. The 
largest gift, $3 million, was provided by the Weingart Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Architect Riener Nielsen, who usually designs hotels and upscale homes, had no 
zoo experience when he was hired by GLAZA as project manager, to serve as both 
buffer and trouble-shooter on the project. Getting it off the ground was the 
hardest part. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ground Broken in July 
</P>
<P>
"For this project," Nielsen said, "there's no comparison to cost relationships 
like there would be for a hotel or an office building, where you would have 
dollars per square foot. We needed to get subcontractors on board early to 
define it and verify the pricing." 
</P>
<P>
Ground breaking was last July, after the deteriorating original children's zoo, 
built in 1963, was demolished. 
</P>
<P>
The project, the largest in the zoo's history, was nearly a full-time challenge 
for the architects. 
</P>
<P>
"There were weeks Ara lived over there," Grist said. "There were phone calls by 
the hour every day." 
</P>
<P>
Although the project was a melding of complex relationships, Zenobians said he 
tried to keep all structures generically Southwestern and simple, with few 
flourishes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe a building should be complicated to be nice," he said. "I 
believe in simplicity very much. I go to basic design that can be appreciated 
by all people." 
</P>
<P>
The need to put safety first for human visitors and animal occupants required 
extensive reworking of some of the plans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scaled for Youngsters 
</P>
<P>
Adjustments were made in "window coverings" for outdoor habitats to restrain 
the animals comfortably and keep visitors at a safe distance, but close enough 
to enable even toddlers to see the creatures up close. 
</P>
<P>
Step-ups were added in front of exhibits to give smaller children a better 
view, and some facade work was designed especially to bring adult-scale 
buildings down to a comfortable level for young visitors. 
</P>
<P>
But there was the occasional gentle conflict between builder and zookeeper. 
</P>
<P>
The fencing at the petting zoo, or hacienda, looks like wood but is made from 
textured concrete. Zoo Director Warren Thomas was concerned that the animals 
would chew on the concrete posts and hurt themselves, but a decision was 
reached to go with concrete anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Grist thought air-conditioning the tarantulas seemed ridiculous. "They seem to 
do very well in the desert without it," he said. But Thomas explained that life 
in captivity is stressful to spiders and that air conditioning is essential to 
their survival. 
</P>
<P>
Fancy technology is scattered throughout the zoo to make each visit an 
interactive adventure. It was created by ex-Disney wizards who formed their own 
Burbank-based company, Art &amp; Technology, which uses contemporary technology 
to design and build educational devices for zoos and amusement parks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stimulate Senses 
</P>
<P>
Adventure Island's 20-plus interactive devices are intended to amuse both 
children and adults and stimulate a variety of senses, said Art &amp; 
Technology's Joe Garlington. 
</P>
<P>
One device inside the cave will let visitors see a lifelike Betty White -- the 
actress and animal lover -- in three dimensions and in miniature, explain how 
and why skunks stink. 
</P>
<P>
In the Little House Under the Prairie, also inside the cave, children will see 
a cross section of a prairie dog burrow outfitted with three-dimensional models 
defining each prairie dog "room." 
</P>
<P>
Art &amp; Technology also created a series of "photo spots," humorous, colorful 
bas-reliefs that will allow children to pose in life-size fantasies scattered 
throughout Adventure Island. 
</P>
<P>
At one, a giant vulture bears down on a rock slab. When a child has his picture 
taken, he'll look like he's being attacked by the bird. Another provides a 
photo opportunity with a snake and a third will give children a chance to 
"hang" like a bat. You turn the snapshot upside down for this one. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the white stucco hacienda-style petting zoo, nursery and 
Southwestern-flavored Greek theater, Grist and Zenobians also drew the plans 
for the earthquake-safe concrete bunker that is the firm foundation for the 
mountain/cave at the entrance to Adventure Island, located past the gift shop 
in the regular zoo. 
</P>
<P>
The cement-and-steel structure, fine-tuned by structural engineer Grossman 
&amp; Speer, not only came up to city code, but it's so solid, Grist said, that 
"when the bomb comes, where you want to be is in that cave. The footings are 
higher than me, and I'm 5-foot-8. It's built like Ft. Knox." 
</P>
<P>
The rugged-looking mountain with a wet and dry cave inside it was crafted with 
dental tools, spray-painted and fitted inside with a dripping slime wall by the 
Larson Co., a Tucson-based design and construction firm that builds grottoes 
for millionaires in the South of France, waterfalls in Japan, water hazards for 
golf courses and naturalistic habitats for zoos. 
</P>
<P>
The landscape of Adventure Island was designed to enhance the various habitats 
and make the zoo animals feel at home, but also to conserve water and guarantee 
low maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Plants and trees selected for the site had to be nontoxic to children and zoo 
animals, and had to blend in with the overall architectural design. 
</P>
<P>
The job was done for $120,000 by Jon David Cicchetti Landscape Architect of 
Long Beach and Irvine, which specializes in using native and ornamental plants 
"to create (a) natural environment, whatever it happened to be." 
</P>
<P>
"The idea was to have these zones -- mountain, desert, meadow -- but at the 
same time have the zones come off as a total landscape," Cicchetti said. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the complexity of this project and the push to finish it by spring, 
Grist and Zenobians said building Adventure Island was very enjoyable. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it was a very successful collaboration or it would not have come 
together as quickly or as cleanly as it did," Grist said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to do another zoo."

Orange County "credit dentist" Dr. Robert F. Beauchamp has stopped plans to 
lease most of Ventura Harbor's financially troubled retail area, saying the 
price is too high. 
</P>
<P>
Bank of America, the largest creditor of Ventura Harbor Village, says the 
100-business center owes $10 million, which must be paid before another 
operator can take over. The previous operators declared bankruptcy in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Beauchamp Enterprises and the Ventura Port District have estimated the debt of 
the village at $6.5 million to $8 million. Beauchamp Enterprises, which 
operates two commercial marinas with 560 slips at Ventura Harbor and has assets 
estimated at $500 million, said it would reconsider if the bank lowered its 
demands.

2 to loosen city restrictions on front-yard parking, sending the ordinance to 
the Planning Commission for review. 
</P>
<P>
"This ordinance is an attack on every single person's property values in this 
city," said Randy Brendia, who raised the specter of Dog Patch. Other 
residents, including Steve Mino, have lobbied for an ordinance that would let 
them widen their driveways to allow an extra parking space on the front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
The city's present ban on front-yard parking was adopted in 1984. Planners 
generally view the practice as an eyesore in residential neighborhoods, said 
Mark Winogrond, a former Lawndale planning director who now heads the West 
Hollywood Planning Department.

Wynyate, the rambling Queen Anne Victorian at 851 Lyndon St. in South Pasadena, 
has been carefully restored by its present owners, Ian and Barbara 
White-Thomson, to preserve its historical integrity as a link to the city's 
past. 
</P>
<P>
The house, a historical city landmark also listed with the National Register of 
Historic Places, was built in 1887 by Donald M. Graham and his wife, author 
Margaret Collier Graham. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year before the city was incorporated and Graham, chosen as its 
mayor, signed an anti-saloon ordinance as his first official action. His wife 
later described the historic meeting at Wynyate. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Graham was opposed to saloons but was not 
</P>
<P>
a Prohibitionist. After the board adjourned he came to me in great amusement 
and said: 'It would have been well to remove the wine glasses and the whiskey 
bottle from the sideboard before meeting to organize a Prohibition town,' " she 
wrote in her memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
Graham, a lawyer who spoke Greek, Latin and Hebrew, had also served his 
community as the local mail carrier and driver of a second-hand buggy stage 
between Pasadena and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Wynyate currently sits on about two acres of land that originally overlooked 
grape vineyards, hence its Welsh name for vineyard. In 1889, naturalist John 
Muir planted a lemon eucalyptus that still flourishes on the west side of the 
house. The only major change to the structure is the absence of the original 
porte-cochere and glass enclosure of its third-floor open porch.

BLAMING APPRAISERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In answer to a question from a reader (Real Estate Q&amp;A, April 16), Robert 
J. Bruss has charged the appraisal profession with fee gouging, internecine 
warfare and, if I understand correctly, conspiracy to jeopardize the loan 
portfolios of all the mortgage lenders. 
</P>
<P>
I would answer the first charge by saying the profession of which he is a 
member is considered standard reference on the topic; thus he may be a closet 
authority. I would agree that fees should not depend on the value of the 
property being appraised. But they do depend on the amount of time necessary to 
complete an appraisal. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeding to his second charge, Bruss says, "Yet the appraisal societies are 
fighting among themselves." That is true. They are fighting over the quickest 
way to enter government regulation Nirvana: become certified, licensed, 
sanctified and maybe rise to the rarefied ethical atmosphere occupied by the 
American Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
His final charge is: "Ask most mortgage lenders, and you will find bad 
appraisals are the major cause of their loan losses." There it is. Forget 
conventional wisdom attributing the national S&amp;L crisis to deregulation 
consequences, ineffective regulatory agency supervision and incompetent or 
dishonest management. The appraiser did it. 
</P>
<P>
Most mortgage brokers or loan officers with S&amp;Ls live or die on commission 
income paid only for loans funded. Loans based on values documented and 
established by the appraiser's opinion of fair market value. Does an appraiser 
work for them twice if he, in good faith, undercuts one of their deals?

GARDEN NEWS: GET TO ROOT OF GOPHER GOBBLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS, Times Garden Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those who have the little critters claim that there is nothing harder to get 
rid of than a gopher, and that just about the only sure-fire method of 
protecting plants from their below-ground gobbling is to encase the roots in 
wire cages. Difficult to make, these cages are now commercially available in 
1-gallon sizes ($23.50 a dozen), 5-gallon sizes ($38.50 a dozen) and 15-gallon 
sizes ($28.50 for six). 
</P>
<P>
They are hot-dipped in zinc to guard against corrosion, and the little bit that 
shows above ground is green in color. The openings in the wire mesh are only 
3/4-inch, so the little guys can't get their heads inside for even a sample. 
</P>
<P>
Root Guard Gopher Barriers are available from the Natural Gardening Co., 217 
San Anselmo Ave., San Anselmo, Calif. 94960, (415) 456-5060. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focal Points 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the only thing a garden design needs is a point of focus -- a place 
to look first before the eye wanders to other delights in the garden. To make 
the garden appear larger, this focal point should be in the distance and it 
should be interesting enough to invite further inspection, thus drawing one out 
into the garden. 
</P>
<P>
At the French formal garden of Versailles, the focal point is a several-story 
tall statue of Hercules. In Spanish gardens it is usually a fountain. In your 
garden it might be a dragonfly. 
</P>
<P>
The totem-like landscape sculpture shown here is just one of several offered by 
a new company in Michigan named Placer Design, and they are available by mail 
(write for a catalogue, to Placer Design, P.O. Box 7371, Dearborn, Mich. 
48121-7371). They are made of red cedar and have been influenced by native 
American designs and other primitive art. Several also have bird houses and 
attached feeders, and they stand about 6 feet tall and sell for around $170. 
</P>
<P>
Placer Design also makes decorative bat houses for the garden. Bats are 
voracious insect eaters and they do exist in Southern California, and are 
sometimes seen feeding at dusk. Whether our bats will move into a bat house is 
an open question, though on the East Coast they do move into these specially 
darkened dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rose Ratings 
</P>
<P>
The American Rose Society published a handy little book that rates all the 
roses -- from 0 to 10 -- and will fit in your pocket so you can take it rose 
shopping. 'Mister Lincoln' gets a 9.1, 'Double Delight' a 9.0, while 'Gray 
Pearl' gets a 3.2, which is probably why you've never heard of it. The "1989 
Handbook for Selecting Roses" costs $1 and a self-addressed stamped envelope. 
Send to The ARS, P.O. Box 30,000, Shreveport, La. 71130-0030. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hope in the Shade 
</P>
<P>
As gardens grow older, they get shadier, as trees and shrubs cast their shadows 
on ever more ground. For those in this predicament, here are some suggestions 
from the Professional Plant Growers Assn. for annual bedding plants that will 
grow in shady situations -- four hours of sun or less. 
</P>
<P>
All of the following can be planted now: ageratum, alyssum, aster, bedding or 
tuberous begonia, browallia, Chinese forget-me-not, coleus, forget-me-not, 
impatiens, lobelia, nicotiana, pansy, salpiglossis and torenia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Manual Mowers 
</P>
<P>
Gardens used to be very peaceful places until most of the gardening machinery 
from mowers to blowers became motorized. Now people often retreat indoors for a 
little peace, where the television and kids seem so quiet in comparison with 
the racket outside. 
</P>
<P>
It is perhaps not too surprising then to find out that manual lawn mowers are 
making a comeback (pictured are three models by American Lawn Mower Co., P.O. 
Box 369, Shelbyville, Ind. 46176). They make a pleasant whirring noise, have no 
exhaust, are easy to store, will not fling rocks or other objects at walls and 
observers and cost less than a power rotary mower. However, in Southern 
California they have a difficult time cutting tough St. Augustine or Kikuyu 
grass lawns and sometimes stumble on Bermuda as well, though these can be cut 
if the lawn is not too large. They do a very neat job of mowing the new tall 
fescue lawns and, if kept halfway sharp, will not cause the tips of the blades 
to turn brown after mowing because their reel action cuts cleanly.

GARDENING: IT'S TIME TO GIVE ROSES A 'TUNEUP'; 
</P>
<P>
TO KEEP BLOOMING CYCLES GOING, BUSHES NEED SOME PERIODIC CARE AND ATTENTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS, Times Garden Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like cars, roses need periodic maintenance -- minor tuneups if you will -- to 
keep them growing and flowering. These should occur after every cycle of bloom 
(rather than after every 5,000 miles), and while a rose will not quit and leave 
you stranded on a freeway should you miss one, it will certainly grow a lot 
better. 
</P>
<P>
Though roses seem to be perpetually in flower in Southern California, the 
blossoms actually come in fairly distinct cycles. The first flowering is in 
early April (though it was a little late this year), the next usually in late 
May, one in early July and so on, right up to Christmas. This varies somewhat 
with the weather and certainly with where you live. 
</P>
<P>
To speed up this process, you need to promptly remove the spent flowers after 
each cycle, otherwise much energy goes into the production of seeds in the form 
of rose "hips" or fruits. The rule for cutting off spent flowers couldn't be 
simpler -- make your cut just above a five-part leaf (the true leaf appears to 
be five smaller leaves). 
</P>
<P>
You can fine-tune the bush by making the cut above a five-part leaf that faces 
in the direction you want the new growth to go, usually out from the center of 
the plant. 
</P>
<P>
At this time of the year you should also look for weak growth and dead or 
damaged canes and cut these out or back to the first strong five-part leaf. You 
should also strip off any yellowed leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Roses need lots of water and fertilizer, and while most serious rose growers 
fertilize every month of the growing season, it is sometimes easier to 
fertilize at the same time you cut off the spent blossoms. There is no end to 
the recommendations on how and what to feed roses, but all you really need to 
do is fertilize them with something. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only Nitrogen Counts 
</P>
<P>
I've seen abundant roses on plants fertilized with fish emulsion, a rather weak 
fertilizer that usually contains only about 5% nitrogen. I also know people who 
fertilize with very strong stuff, such as ammonium sulfate, which contains 
about 21% nitrogen and is a real bargain but is strong enough to burn plants if 
too much is used. 
</P>
<P>
It's important to note, however, that the nitrogen content of the fertilizer is 
just about the only thing that counts in California, according to tests 
conducted by the University of California. The other ingredients -- the 
potassium and phosphorous, iron and acidifying agents -- do little or nothing 
unless they are mixed into the soil at planting time. The important thing is to 
supply nitrogen in some form after every bloom cycle or every month -- 
whichever is the easier to remember. 
</P>
<P>
Scatter a granular fertilizer around the base of the plant in a circle about 6 
feet across or apply a liquid fertilizer, following label directions, and then 
thoroughly water to push it into the soil. 
</P>
<P>
Don't underestimate how much water a rose wants. It can get by on very little, 
as countless roses growing on abandoned properties attest to, but it only 
thrives with lots. On the other hand, don't drown it -- let the soil dry a 
little between irrigations. A thorough watering once a week during spring, 
summer and fall is usually enough. 
</P>
<P>
Be a little careful with new roses planted this past winter. They need less 
fertilizer (some people say none) and less water. 
</P>
<P>
If you have now tuned up the rose for another run, but notice that the canes 
are getting old and woody, and that no new growth is coming from the bottom of 
the plant, you can try a trick that helps roses make basal breaks, a term for 
new sprouts that come from the base of the plant. Don't confuse these with 
suckers, which are sprouts coming from the roots. Suckers should be snapped off 
at the roots; basal breaks encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Promoting Basal Breaks 
</P>
<P>
Jon Bastian, the editor of "Santa Barbara Roses," the excellent publication of 
the Santa Barbara Roses Society (P.O. Box 3082, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93130) 
told me that the use of Epsom salts to promote basal breaks is not folklore but 
fact. 
</P>
<P>
Epsom salts are available at pharmacies, usually sold for soaking your feet or 
as a laxative, and are not to be confused with table salt or any other salt. 
Epsom salts are magnesium sulfate and will not add to the salt content of the 
soil (which is harmful to plants). 
</P>
<P>
To encourage basal breaks, add this to your after-bloom routine: sprinkle one 
tablespoon to 1/4 cup (the recommendations vary) around the base of the bush. 
</P>
<P>
Should you get strong new growth from the base of the plant, you might try a 
trick Bastian learned from an Italian gardener. Snap off the top of the growth 
when it reaches about mid-thigh. His source simply called this procedure 
"snapping the canes" and they will break with a snap, just like an asparagus 
stalk. The break will encourage the shoot to branch and flower sooner.

10-year deal valued at $2.7 million. Royce Co. represented both the law firm 
and the owners of the towers, a joint venture of The Prudential and an 
affiliate of JMB Realty Corp.

NEW STYLES OF ELECTRICAL PLUGS ARE SAFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You can increase your safety and protect your appliances from abuse by 
replacing old and worn electrical plugs and receptacles with newer styles 
offering extra safety features and conveniences. 
</P>
<P>
Maintenance Technology magazine says that to secure a plug that might be easily 
knocked out of the receptacle, a straight-blade plug with a locking screw can 
be used. This type of connection is especially important for appliances such as 
refrigerators, where the result of an accidental disconnection can mean real 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
An angle plug should be used when you want to place furniture or an appliance 
closer to the wall. An angle plug lays flat against the wall instead of 
protruding from it. As for receptacles, isolated ground receptacles should be 
used whenever sensitive electrical equipment such as computers require a pure, 
noise-free ground. Surge suppression receptacles help protect electronic 
equipment from damage caused by transient voltage spikes.

PATIO FURNITURE WILL LAST WITH PROPER UPKEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New designs and materials make porch, patio and garden furniture tougher than 
ever. Good quality outdoor furniture often is expensive, and tender loving care 
will protect the investment for years. Follow these tips to help keep your 
casual furniture looking great: 
</P>
<P>
 -- When you take your aluminum furniture out of winter storage for summer use, 
inspect it for damage. Tighten loose screws and replace rusty ones with the 
corrosion-resistant kind. Replace worn cords or webbing, using materials from 
kits. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Spray stiff joints of folding furniture with silicone lubricant. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Remove white blotches on aluminum with a coat of aluminum rust dissolver. 
Hose it off after a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Restore a satiny look with a commercial aluminum brightener or fine steel 
wool dipped in kerosene. For a protective finish, apply clear lacquer or 
automobile paste wax. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wash color-coated aluminum with a mild detergent. Cover scratches with 
matching touch-up paint. Protect with automobile wax. 
</P>
<P>
Wrought-iron furnishings require some special care: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Remove rust with a wire brush and sand with coarse steel wool. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Repair broken or loose joints with epoxy cement. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Apply a rust protector that leaves a polymer coating. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Retouch with acrylic or oil-based paint. If you're repainting an entire 
piece, use a paint that is specifically designed for metals. Don't use latex. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Protect with a top coat of automobile paste wax. 
</P>
<P>
Outdoor furniture made of molded synthetics or PVC (polyvinyl chloride) 
shouldn't show wear for several years. Some tips for keeping them in shape: 
</P>
<P>
 -- To freshen, wash with a mild detergent, or better yet, a creamy car polish. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If your chairs have cushions, store the cushions when they're not in use to 
avoid fading and stains.

THE KING OF HORROR; 
</P>
<P>
AUTHOR OF 'INCREDIBLY CREEPY STUFF' THRILLS 'EM IN PASADENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What do you do with a man who takes a perverse pleasure in scaring the living 
daylights out of you? You celebrate him, of course. You give him standing 
ovations, respond to his jokes with wall-shaking laughter and wave your fist in 
the air, shouting "Yeah!" when he mentions the titles of his books. 
</P>
<P>
"Pet Sematary." "Yeah!" 
</P>
<P>
"The Shining." "All right!" 
</P>
<P>
"This is sort of like Stephen King's greatest hits," said the horror story 
writer during a jocular, confiding address to an audience of youthful King 
aficionados at the Pasadena Public Library on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
For many of the 250 people packed into the little auditorium, some of whom had 
stood in line in front of the library all night Sunday to buy the last tickets 
for the sold-out speech, this was the literary event of the era. They hauled in 
crates of King novels to be autographed, jabbered excitedly about the latest 
King film ("Pet Sematary," which opened last week) and exchanged notes on their 
idol's diabolical literary powers. 
</P>
<P>
"He can write some incredibly creepy stuff," said one man. "Yeah, he can keep 
you up at night." 
</P>
<P>
King mesmerized them. 
</P>
<P>
When the author appeared at a side door, a tall, slouching figure in jeans and 
a rumpled shirt, with glasses as thick as Coke bottles, audience members 
erupted into applause, jumping to their feet when he reached the stage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rare Trip 
</P>
<P>
King had made a rare trip to California from his home in Maine not just to give 
a lecture to an adoring audience, he said. "The fact is that, in some odd way, 
this is a research trip," said King, 41, whose novels are perennial entries on 
the best-seller list. His two dozen books -- including "The Drawing of the 
Three," currently on top of the New York Times' Paperback Best Sellers list -- 
have sold a combined total fast approaching 100 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm working on a book called 'The Library Police,' whose central character is 
a woman vampire and sexual psychopath," he said, launching into a riveting 
discussion of the sources of his ideas and the secrets of his success. 
</P>
<P>
"The ideas can come from any place and no place at all," King added. 
</P>
<P>
Successful horror stories, King suggested, always have a kind of split 
personality. "As a writer, you're talking with two voices," he said. "At one 
level, you're screaming at your audience about ghosts and vampires. At another 
level, you're whispering to them about real fears." 
</P>
<P>
The "whispering" was obvious in the "thousand bad horror movies" of the 1950s, 
which provided the young Stephen King with a shaping influence. Take the early 
Japanese monster movies, with their references to nuclear holocaust, he said. " 
'Godzilla,' with his radioactive halitosis, stomps Tokyo flat and makes real 
the unspoken nightmare of the whole nation," said King. 
</P>
<P>
American movie thrillers of that period sometimes seemed to echo the communist 
scare of the 1950s, King added. " 'The Invasion of the Body Snatchers,' " with 
its pod people subtly replacing good Americans, really suggested that "there's 
a Red under every bed," said King. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Turned Into Movies 
</P>
<P>
Half a dozen of King's books have been turned into movies, with plans for more 
in the works. King shamelessly plugged the movie version of "Pet Sematary," for 
which he wrote the screenplay and in which he played a small role. 
</P>
<P>
King's stories whisper of up-to-date fears: disease, mass murder, family 
pathology. 
</P>
<P>
Television sitcoms never prepared him for the grinding stresses of raising a 
family, King said. "On 'The Donna Reed Show,' Dad was always cool," he said. 
"He wore a tie at the dinner table and his hair was combed. The mother never 
said, 'Get outa here. I've got PMS, and I'm gonna kill you.' " 
</P>
<P>
The author came to realize, he said, that anyone can have the impulses of the 
murderous father in "The Shining." 
</P>
<P>
"When you get up in the middle of the night to give the baby his bottle," King 
said, "out of some sewer back there (in one's mind), there's an alligator 
saying, 'Kill it. Use the pillow.' The whispering says, 'Jack Torrance is you.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
King's latest theme came to him, the author said, from his 12-year-old son, 
Owen, who provided unwitting fodder for the prolific King horror machine. The 
boy had wanted his father to check a book out of the library for him, rather 
than putting it on his own card. Why? "I'm afraid of the library police," Owen 
confessed to his father, saying that a family member had once told him that a 
corps of enforcers punished derelict library patrons. 
</P>
<P>
It was one of those frivolous childhood fears that King has made so much of -- 
half superstition, half kids' scary game -- and which is treated as hideously 
real by King's characters. 
</P>
<P>
"Immediately, my antennae went up," said King, shooting his familiar grin. 
"What was this kid afraid of? There might be millions of dollars in this. 
(Appreciative applause from the audience) Suddenly, I'm a concerned parent. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Colorful Wonderings 
</P>
<P>
The exchange with his son sent King's imagination reeling. "I started to wonder 
what library police look like," he said. "Look at all the unmarked doors in the 
library. They're there, 10 feet tall, with silver eyes, trench coats and 
horrible weapons." 
</P>
<P>
All of his novels have sprung from such random intrusions into his life, King 
said. "The Shining," a novel (turned into a movie by Stanley Kubrick), set in a 
deserted resort hotel, came from an actual trip to such a hotel in Colorado. 
"We got up there the day before the season ended," he said. "We checked in 
while everybody else checked out. . . . In the restaurant, all the tables 
except ours were covered with plastic and there was a forest of upturned chair 
legs." 
</P>
<P>
"Cujo," in which the villain is a mass murderer inhabiting the body of a rabid 
dog, came from a face-off between King and a dog at a mechanic's garage. "There 
was this noise, like a motorboat at a low idle," said King, exulting in the 
story, "and here was the biggest St. Bernard I'd ever seen in my life. He was 
dirty, he had his head down and his tail down, and he knew what he wanted. He 
wanted me. 'Don't worry,' said Joe (the mechanic), 'he always does that.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Ornamental Doodad' 
</P>
<P>
King, describing Stephen King the author as "the ornamental doodad on the 
automobile of civilization," also made these points: 
</P>
<P>
What makes horror stories truly gripping is the human condition. "None of us 
are going to walk out alive," he said. "We're going to croak, folks. As Steve 
Martin once said, 'We're having a pretty good time tonight considering we're 
all gonna die.' " 
</P>
<P>
He saw a ghost five years ago, after a house party in Maine, while retrieving 
his wife's coat from an upstairs bedroom. As King sorted through a pile of 
coats on a bed, "I realized there was a man sitting by a window across the 
room. He was about 70 years old, in a blue pinstripe suit, with a bald head and 
brown glasses." The man's head was "tanned and tough looking, with freckles." 
But the apparition disappeared suddenly. 
</P>
<P>
He expects to die in the month of February. "Everything bad in my life happens 
in February." 
</P>
<P>
His characters assume their own destinies. "The boy in 'Cujo' -- I was real 
sorry when he died. He literally died one day on the page. His mother gave him 
mouth-to-mouth, and I thought he'd come around. But he never did." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Satisfied Audience 
</P>
<P>
The audience floated out of the library in small groups, with freshly 
autographed copies of "The Stand" and "Carrie" and the rest. "It was more than 
satisfying," said Norma Vega, a student at Cal State L.A. who had paid $30 for 
the library's six-author lecture series just so she could see King. "I would 
have paid triple." 
</P>
<P>
Jessica Ackerburke, 15, said she had been hooked on King novels for several 
years. "It's kind of like getting away from yourself," said the John Muir High 
School sophomore. "You don't have to worry about it. It's in the book." 
</P>
<P>
Is there a word describing "Kingophiles"? Vega didn't hesitate. "Obsessed," she 
said.

LIGHT SNACK FOR ANTS LEAVES TEMPLE CITY DRIVERS IN THE DARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIOK-HIAN TAY KELLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first Temple City traffic light blacked out in September. Another 
short-circuited in December, sparking a small, underground flash fire. A third 
signal went dead in January. 
</P>
<P>
Neither power outages nor pranksters were responsible. Ants, munching away at 
the insulation on wires, were the culprits. 
</P>
<P>
"People think it's sort of a joke. It's really not," said Public Works Director 
Chris Peterson. Rewiring the three lights cost the city more than $22,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Familiar Phenomenon 
</P>
<P>
Temple City is having its first serious taste of a phenomenon familiar to many 
cities and to engineers at the state Department of Transportation and the 
county Public Works Department. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim-based Signal Maintenance Inc. services traffic lights for about 70 
cities, including Temple City, in Los Angeles and Orange counties. Operations 
manager Walter Cuk said almost every city has had the problem at one time or 
another. 
</P>
<P>
Last month Peterson sent out questionnaires to 27 cities to find out how 
prevalent the problem is in the San Gabriel Valley and how others are handling 
it. 
</P>
<P>
According to partial survey returns, West Covina has resorted to a wasp and 
hornet killer. San Dimas uses Raid. Arcadia isn't doing anything because damage 
is minor. Montclair declared that nothing is effective against the ants. 
Monterey Park and Azusa have never had the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Repairmen from the county Public Works Department, which helps 58 cities 
maintain their traffic signals, make the rounds of 1,200 intersections armed 
with cans of ant and roach killer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a part of routine maintenance," said Terry Green, director of 
technical services for the department. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what kind of nutrition they get out of (eating wires)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Smells Like Food 
</P>
<P>
None, according to Roy Snelling, collections manager in the county Museum of 
Natural History's entomology section. Something -- he has no idea what -- in 
the plastic insulation apparently emits a smell that makes ants think it's 
food. 
</P>
<P>
"They find out it isn't, but they keep on trying," he said. "Ants aren't 
terribly smart." 
</P>
<P>
Concerned that more signals might succumb to the insects in Temple City, 
Peterson is seeking contracts for "ant-proofing" the wiring at the city's 27 
intersections. Proposals received so far would cost the city about $150 a year 
per intersection, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen ant-ravaged wires dangle from the wall in Peterson's office, some 
merely nibbled at, others stripped to the bare metal. A copper blob hangs from 
a cable where two bare wires crossed, short-circuited and melted. 
</P>
<P>
"We hadn't recognized this as a serious problem. We're hoping poisoning will 
stop further damage," he said, referring to the different pesticides he is 
experimenting with. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said he is less concerned about cables for street lights because most 
are above ground. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Ant-Resistant' Wire 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Caltrans created a special committee to deal with chronic 
blackouts, said department spokesman Thomas Knox. The group came up with an 
"ant-resistant" wire insulated with a different plastic. It has been used for 
all rewiring since last year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena is beginning to investigate alternate types of wiring. The city 
replaced wiring at eight intersections last year, said traffic maintenance 
supervisor Bob Gonzales. An aerosol pesticide was also used, but it was 
discontinued after six months when repairmen started becoming ill, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Provenza, an associate electrical engineer at Caltrans who teaches 
maintenance classes for the Traffic Signal Assn., said he advises using flakes 
of bathroom deodorizer as an ant deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
Gophers occasionally chew on the insulation too, Provenza added, and lizards 
have been a problem in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Cuk of Signal Maintenance remembers a contract he undertook in the late 1950s 
to install traffic signals at 10 intersections on Lakewood Boulevard in Long 
Beach. After the three-month project for Caltrans was completed, he flipped the 
master switch. Nothing happened. 
</P>
<P>
The curb-side cabinets containing the signal controllers were infested with 
dark-brown ants, Cuk said. They were so densely packed together that they 
blocked the electrical contacts so that the lights could not be activated. Cuk 
said he had to pick them out with tweezers. Underground wires were found 
completely stripped of insulation. 
</P>
<P>
"Those damned things ate 4 1/2 miles of cable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When he stepped on the ants, Cuk said, they seemed to spring back up and crawl 
off -- maybe because of all the rubber insulation they'd eaten.

TAIWANESE COMMUNITY MOURNS A DISSIDENT AND RENEWS DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH LU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man burns himself to death in Taipei rather than surrender to police to face 
charges of sedition. News of his death rocks Chinese communities worldwide, and 
a martyr is born. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Gabriel Valley, supporters of Nan-jung Cheng, a leader in the Taiwan 
independence movement, are still recovering from shock over his death April 7. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't sleep," Walnut resident Joshua Su said of his reaction upon hearing 
the news. Su was one of more than 300 Cheng admirers, from Hacienda Heights to 
Irvine, who gathered in El Monte last weekend for a memorial service. 
</P>
<P>
For some supporters, Cheng's death has strengthened their own commitment to the 
establishment of a country not ruled by the present Kuomintang government or 
the People's Republic of China. They maintain that only independence will 
guarantee residents democracy and freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not the Solution' 
</P>
<P>
For others, such as moderates who call for democratic freedoms but do not 
necessarily seek a different government, Cheng's death is viewed as a senseless 
sacrifice. Even some members of Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party, a major 
opposition party that Cheng identified with closely, had reservations about his 
action. 
</P>
<P>
"Burning himself to death is not the solution," Shin-chieh Huang, head of the 
Democratic Progressive Party, told television reporters in Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
Huang's comments, criticized by some fellow party members as inappropriate, 
highlighted the party's internal frictions -- frictions mirrored in Taiwanese 
communities here. 
</P>
<P>
Just as in Taiwan, support for the independence movement in the San Gabriel 
Valley represents a minority viewpoint, said Charles Ho, a developer active in 
Alhambra's Chinese community. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they are really accepted well," Ho said. "A lot of people do not 
agree with independence. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's fair to say that everyone would like to see Taiwan be more 
democratic," said Ho, a mainlander who spent his youth in Taiwan before moving 
to the United States. "His death only gives a small group of people some excuse 
for propaganda, that's all," Ho said. 
</P>
<P>
Rowland Heights resident Yu-ping Hsia, a chemistry professor at Cal Poly 
Pomona, said he does not support the independence movement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Respect His Spirit 
</P>
<P>
"I respect (Cheng's) spirit, but I don't think his method is right," Hsia said. 
"It's abnormal. 
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan independence, these two words I'm not in favor of," said Hsia, who 
emphasized he is not a Kuomintang member. "I think Taiwan is part of China." 
</P>
<P>
The independence movement is not viewed favorably by the Kuomintang, People's 
Republic of China or U.S. governments, all of which espouse a one-China policy. 
Under that policy, Taiwan is viewed as a province in China. 
</P>
<P>
But while the United States in 1979 officially recognized the Communist 
government on the mainland, Kuomintang officials in Taiwan continue to view 
themselves as representing the legitimate government of China. The Kuomintang 
became the government in exile after communists took over mainland China in 
1949. Hundreds of thousands of mainlanders fled to Taiwan to escape the 
communists. 
</P>
<P>
The relationship between mainlanders, who fled after 1949, and Taiwanese, 
mainly immigrants from Fujian province who moved to Taiwan in the 1800s, has 
been marked by decades of friction over Kuomintang rule and the Taiwanese 
minority representation in the Taiwan legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, although Cheng was born in Taiwan, the government considers him a 
mainlander, because his father did not move to Taiwan until around World War 
II. In fact, when Cheng was courting his wife, Ju-lan Yeh, a Taiwanese, her 
father objected to the marriage because he considered Cheng a mainlander. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, one of the major organizations sympathetic to the 
independence movement is the Taiwanese Assn. of America, which has 10,000 
members and 60 chapters nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, there are six chapters -- San Gabriel, Long Beach, West 
Los Angeles, East Los Angeles, Orange County, and West Orange -- each with 100 
to 200 members, said the organization's national president, Maysing Yang. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Weeks of Observances 
</P>
<P>
The memorial service in El Monte capped two weeks of meetings and protests in 
the Los Angeles area marking Cheng's death. 
</P>
<P>
The only clash occurred on April 15, after more than 30 Cheng supporters went 
to the Los Angeles office of the Coordination Council for North American 
Affairs, which represents the Kuomintang government in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police arrested three persons and charged them with trespassing. 
According to council spokesman Shih-chi Chen, those arrested put glue into 
front door locks at the office, and a woman hurled a jar of petroleum jelly at 
a safety glass above the service counter.

<P>
On April 9, more than 700 people met at Monterey Park's Lincoln Plaza for a 
memorial service and raised $5,000 for Cheng's family. 
</P>
<P>
The organizers of the Monterey Park gathering do not favor independence but 
praised Cheng and emphasized how his death will spur a demand for greater 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of men and women at the El Monte service dabbed away tears as they 
listened to eulogies and watched a videotaped press conference by Cheng's widow 
in Taipei after her husband's death. 
</P>
<P>
Speakers underscored the importance of Cheng's death in the independence 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
"What is lacking in the movement is commitment," said Yung-hsin Chen, a 
pro-independence activist and close friend of Cheng's who flew from Taipei for 
the El Monte service. "The movement especially needs those who are not afraid 
to sacrifice their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Yung Hsu, a Hacienda Heights resident who attended the service, said it is 
difficult to estimate the impact, after the initial shock, of Cheng's death on 
the community. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of changing people's minds, I can't see it," Hsu said. 
</P>
<P>
But some in the audience, such as Frank Wu of Anaheim, said they were moved by 
Cheng's death and have decided to become more active in the independence 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
It was Cheng's decision to publish a draft constitution for an independent 
Taiwan that got him into trouble with government officials and eventually led 
to his death. 
</P>
<P>
For five years, Cheng, a political activist and a magazine publisher, had been 
printing articles critical of the government, attacking former President Chiang 
Kai Shek's family and accusing the Kuomintang and military leaders of 
corruption. He managed to stay ahead of censors by periodically changing the 
name of his weekly magazine, which always kept the word "Era" in the title. 
</P>
<P>
But Cheng went one step too far last December by publishing in "The Freedom Era 
Weekly" a draft constitution for a new republic. 
</P>
<P>
"How can an American citizen ask for independence for California?" said Chen, 
the Coordination Council spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Officials issued a warrant to arrest Cheng on charges of sedition, but Cheng 
refused to appear in court. He barricaded himself in his magazine office and 
vowed not to be caught alive. 
</P>
<P>
"If the police catch me, they'll only get my corpse," Cheng told friends. His 
wife, Ju-lan Yeh, said her husband kept three cans of gasoline in his office in 
preparation for the police visit. She suspected his intentions, but said she 
knew if she took away the gasoline, he would never forgive her. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Officers in Riot Gear 
</P>
<P>
There is dispute over whether Cheng threw Molotov cocktails at police and 
whether authorities acted appropriately in dispatching officers in riot gear to 
the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Chen of the coordination council said authorities were only being cautious 
because they feared Cheng's supporters might riot at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
By the time police got into his office, Cheng had burned himself to death. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Huang, who teaches political theory part time at several California state 
universities, believes that Cheng's death was not a waste. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a challenge to the law and order in Taiwan," said Huang, a 
Taiwanese who is a member of the Kuomintang Party. "He gave us a lot to think 
about -- what the future of Taiwan should be." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SHORT HISTORY OF TAIWAN 
</P>
<P>
1590-1661 -- European Half-Century 
</P>
<P>
Portuguese navigators arrived in Taiwan in the 16th Century and named it "Ilha 
Formosa," meaning "beautiful island." During the 17th Century, the Dutch and 
Spanish established settlements there. The Dutch East India Co., based in 
Taiwan, controlled the southern coast of the island for about 40 years. This 
era is known as the European half-century. During this time Christianity was 
introduced. 
</P>
<P>
1662-1683 -- The Kingdom of Koxinga 
</P>
<P>
In 1662, 18 years after the Ming Dynasty of China was overthrown by the 
Manchus, Kuo Hsing-yeh (called Koxinga by the Dutch) led the remnants of the 
Ming government from China to refuge on Taiwan and expelled the Dutch. From 
Taiwan Koxinga harassed the Manchu (Qing) dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
1683-1895 -- The Qing Dynasty 
</P>
<P>
In 1683, the Qing emperor sent an expedition force to Taiwan and, with 
assistance from the Dutch, gained authority over Taiwan. For the next two 
centuries, however, the Qing government exerted only nominal control over the 
island. Abortive independence movements occurred so often that a popular saying 
referred to the state of affairs as, "Every three years an uprising; every five 
years a rebellion." 
</P>
<P>
1895 -- The Republic of Taiwan 
</P>
<P>
In 1895, Taiwan was ceded to Japan after China lost the first Chinese-Japanese 
War. The treaty allowed for a period during which the Taiwanese could opt for 
Chinese nationality and move to the Chinese mainland or remain in Taiwan. Most 
of the population stayed on the island, revolted against becoming part of Japan 
and established the Republic of Taiwan. Within a year, however, the Japanese 
invaded Taiwan and suppressed the revolt. 
</P>
<P>
1895-1945 -- Colony of Japan 
</P>
<P>
Japan annexed Taiwan to its empire. 
</P>
<P>
1945-1949 
</P>
<P>
After its surrender in World War II, Japan relinquished control of Taiwan to 
China. 
</P>
<P>
1949 
</P>
<P>
Chiang Kai-shek, defeated by Chinese Communists, moved his government to 
Taiwan, making the island the seat of government for the Republic of China. 
</P>
<P>
1971 
</P>
<P>
United States announced support of U.N. membership for the People's Republic of 
China (Communist China) but recommended that the Republic of China (Taiwan) 
also retain its seat. The United Nations expelled Taiwan and admitted the 
People's Republic of China to membership. 
</P>
<P>
1972 
</P>
<P>
President Richard M. Nixon visited the People's Republic of China and agreed to 
gradually withdraw U.S. military forces from Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
1978 
</P>
<P>
U.S. ended formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
1979 
</P>
<P>
United States established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of 
China. Mutual defense treaty between United States and Taiwan ended.

LYNWOOD BODIES AGREE TO NEGOTIATE OVER RENEWAL; 
</P>
<P>
CITY, SCHOOL DISTRICT DECLARE PEACE, DROP SUITS 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After more than eight months of legal battles sparked by a school district 
lawsuit challenging a city redevelopment project, the Lynwood Unified School 
District and the city of Lynwood have decided to settle their differences 
outside of the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides have agreed to drop lawsuits against each other and "negotiate a 
peaceful agreement," said City Manager Charles Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
Four suits had been filed since the squabbling started last summer over a plan 
by the city redevelopment agency to add more acreage to its existing 
redevelopment areas. The project is designed to redevelop blighted and rundown 
commercial and industrial areas over the next 35 years, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The school district filed two suits against the city and the Lynwood 
Redevelopment Agency. City Councilman Robert Henning, acting as a private 
citizen, filed suit alleging that the school district's suits were "frivolous 
and a waste of the taxpayers' money." The city and the redevelopment agency 
also filed a suit against the district. 
</P>
<P>
The school district filed the first suit in August against the city and the 
Lynwood Redevelopment Agency, which is made up of the five-member City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The suit said the redevelopment project would bring in more families with 
children that would burden already overcrowded schools. However, in February, 
Superior Court Judge Kenneth Gale dismissed the suit, ruling that the 
redevelopment plan would not have an impact on the schools. 
</P>
<P>
School Board President Richard Armstrong said the suit was filed because "We 
wanted to get the attention of the city." Armstrong said the district was due a 
certain amount of money under the redevelopment project but city officials 
would not discuss the issue with the district. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez said, however, that the district wanted more money than it was entitled 
to under state redevelopment law. He said the district is entitled to 2% of the 
property taxes that would be created by the city-expanded redevelopment 
project. "We were offering 2% and they kept saying they wanted more. Then they 
filed the lawsuit," Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
A second suit, filed by the district in September, alleged that the 
redevelopment project would create a financial burden for the school district. 
The suit claimed that an estimated $40 million in property taxes would go to 
the redevelopment agency instead of the district. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Henning's suit was filed in January. Judge Gale ruled that Henning's 
suit was incomplete but he was allowed to refile. The case is pending, but 
Henning said he will drop the suit. 
</P>
<P>
The last suit was filed in April by the city and the Lynwood Redevelopment 
Agency to challenge the school district's plan to build a two-story 
administration building to relieve overcrowded conditions. The proposed site is 
in the city's redevelopment area. The suit alleges that the district should 
prepare an environmental impact study. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tit-for-tat suit," said Gomez, who also is executive director of the 
redevelopment agency. "They filed a suit against us and we filed the same kind 
of suit against them." 
</P>
<P>
However, Gomez said he hopes all the legal battling is over. At a joint meeting 
last Monday, members of the school board and council agreed to cooperate with 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
The board said it would drop all suits on certain conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The council agreed to the district's conditions and voted 4 to 0 to drop its 
remaining suit against the district. Mayor Evelyn Wells was not present. 
</P>
<P>
Without giving details, the council agreed not to interfere with the district's 
construction of the $4-million administration building on a part of the 
recreational area at Hosler Junior High School. Council members agreed to help 
the district provide security for Hosler Junior High students who use part of a 
city park for recreational activities. 
</P>
<P>
The council also agreed to help find potential buyers for the district's old 
administration building, and said it would discuss the 2% property tax share 
with the district. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the school board voted 4 to 0 to drop its suits. Board member 
Thelma Williams was not present. 
</P>
<P>
City and district officials say they have not yet determined the legal fees 
that resulted from the suits.

DISTRICT MAY TAKE OVER JOB AT GARDNER ELEMENTARY; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOL CONTRACTOR GIVEN 'LAST' DEADLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Unified School District officials have vowed to use district 
workers to complete the long-delayed construction project at Gardner Elementary 
School if the contractor hired to do the job fails to finish by the end of 
June. 
</P>
<P>
The officials made the promise to a group of parents last week as the $700,000 
project to add air conditioning, an elevator and other improvements to 
Gardner's 66-year-old main building stretched more than a year and a half 
behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The school has remained open during the construction, and teachers, parents and 
students have been complaining about the conditions for months. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just more of the same thing," said Judith Drury, a parent. "They make 
promises and never deliver. It's been one delay after another." 
</P>
<P>
During the construction, there have been shortages of toilets, drinking 
fountains and wash basins for the nearly 500 students at the school. Books and 
supplies were distributed late because they were packed away because of 
construction work over the summer. During the winter, students were assigned to 
bungalows where the heating systems worked only sporadically. The school 
library has been shut down, and there is no computer lab. 
</P>
<P>
The project, which was supposed to be completed in late 1987, was delayed 
because of asbestos removal, squabbles between the contractor and architect and 
equipment failures. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, the contractor signed a work schedule indicating that the job 
would be completed by April 25. But parents were told last week that the job 
was only 80% finished, and a new completion date was slated for the end of 
June. 
</P>
<P>
"If the job is not completed by then, then the district will either hire 
additional contractors or subcontractors to finish it, or we'll bring in our 
own crews to do it," said Mel Ross, an official in the district's building 
services division. 
</P>
<P>
Ross said the contractor needs to finish work on the painting, air 
conditioning, electrical system, elevators, ceilings and some paving and clean 
up. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the contractor, Levin Construction Co. of North Hollywood, did 
not return calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
The contract with the construction firm called for a $500-a-day fine for 
unnecessary delays beyond the 271 days allotted in the contract to complete the 
job. However, school officials said a determination of whether the contractor 
has violated the agreement will not be made until after the job is completed, 
in keeping with standard practice. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles school board member Alan Gershman, whose district includes the 
school, described the project as a "disaster where rules and regulations have 
been stretched to the limit by the contractor. He has taken every legal 
loophole, and we don't have a solid foundation to go after him on." 
</P>
<P>
Gershman, who faces a June runoff for reelection, said he supports the call for 
tough action against the contractor. However, Gershman has been criticized by 
parents who say he has not done enough to force completion of the project. 
</P>
<P>
"He came to the meeting, but it was like he didn't know what was going on. He 
had no answers. It was like it was all new to him," said Angie Ranslem, a 
parent. 
</P>
<P>
The project continues to be a source of frustration for many. The controversy 
forced the principal to take a leave earlier this year, and since then, the 
school has had two interim principals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bad situation," said Jeff Sweeney, the school's current principal. "But 
the teachers are professionals, and I don't believe the children are losing 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Laureen Mitchell, a kindergarten teacher and a union spokeswoman, said everyone 
has been under a strain. "We have had three administrators since September. 
That has caused problems," she said. "It's hard having to adapt to different 
management styles, different expectations."

GERSHMAN WORDS CALLED 'DISGRACE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the comments of Alan Gershman, in which a member of the school board 
referred to actions of (United Teachers-Los Angeles) members as "political 
terrorism" (Times, April 16): Gershman's hyperbole disgraces his high office 
and further pollutes the discussion between the (Los Angeles Unified School 
District) and UTLA that is nearing a flash point. 
</P>
<P>
This is indeed the time for quieter voices. His comments suggest that he has 
lost his ability to rationally represent the parents and voters of the 
Westside. At a time when most skilled politicians would be searching for a way 
to resolve the dispute before picket lines are established, Gershman continues 
to lash out at teachers who have demonstrated a commendable willingness to obey 
the law while teaching our classes, working to elect responsible board members, 
organizing our membership and still making time for our friends and families. 
</P>
<P>
This has been a very challenging year. As the end approaches, I look back on it 
as one more year filled with efforts to improve public education in Los Angeles 
in spite of a Board of Education that is, with two notable exceptions, 
indifferent to the real needs of kids and concerned only with preserving their 
political power over the teachers. 
</P>
<P>
But the days of teachers passively accepting the dictates of board members and 
incompetent school administrators are over. They have been over since last 
September. A strike will only demonstrate what has been obvious to every 
classroom teacher in Los Angeles for months. We will never again surrender to 
the whims of these petty bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
It's over, Alan. No one listens to you anymore. The voters will have their say 
in June, then you can call us anything you want, but your comments won't find 
their way into the news and teachers will be too busy teaching to listen.

NATIONAL FOREST GETS GRANT TO REMOVE TRASH, GRAFFITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Angeles National Forest has received a $45,000-grant to remove graffiti and 
litter from areas such as San Gabriel Canyon, which has been hit hard in recent 
years, according to a park official. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Forest Service grant must be matched with local contributions of 
volunteer time and private money, said Janice Gordon, assistant recreation 
officer for the Mt. Baldy Ranger District. So far, close to $10,000 has been 
raised, most of it in commitments of volunteer time counted at $10 an hour, 
Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
"We plan to have a fairly steady work force of people coming up to the forest 
to eliminate graffiti, within a 48-hour period if at all possible," she said. 
"Graffiti really seems to breed graffiti . . . and we find there's a connection 
between litter and graffiti." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the park has been lent a sandblasting machine by the Big Santa Anita 
Historical Society. The grant money will pay for a supervisor, vehicle fuel and 
maintenance and a second sandblasting machine, which uses water from creeks and 
streams instead of a tank, Gordon said. Such a machine can be carried farther 
into the wilderness, where graffiti is spreading. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the park hopes to begin a weekend education program in which 
volunteers would contact park visitors and advise them to pack out their trash. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon said trash has been a problem in the Angeles National Forest for years, 
but graffiti began appearing only about two years ago. She said at first she 
ignored it, but then hikers and picnickers began to complain. 
</P>
<P>
The cleanup will officially begin May 12.

MANAGER CALLS SHOTS AT NO-FRILLS TENNIS TOURNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Yes, as a matter of fact, the hat has seen better days, but what is a 
67-year-old man who is set in his ways supposed to do, wear something else? 
</P>
<P>
He tried that once and all it got him was ignored. Friends didn't recognize 
him. 
</P>
<P>
True, it is soiled above the brim, faded and a bit tattered, but so what? The 
hat shows its age. Is there something wrong with that? 
</P>
<P>
Fred Lamb, its owner, thinks not. 
</P>
<P>
The hat is a symbol, he says, of something else old but still treasured by its 
caretakers -- the Ojai Tennis Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
39 Playing Sites 
</P>
<P>
The tournament, which started Thursday and ends today, was being played at 39 
sites in and around the Ojai Valley. It is in its 90th year. Lamb has presided 
over 31 of them as tournament manager. The hat has been around for 20. 
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon has strawberries and cream, an international television audience, the 
cup and a $5.3-million purse. Ojai has 500 volunteers, orange juice, cookies 
and tea, Lamb's hat, and, for the winners, medallions and handshakes. 
</P>
<P>
Champions of the tournament's open division have accounted for more than two 
dozen Wimbledon titles. Jimmy Connors played Ojai, as have Bill Tilden, Jack 
Kramer and Billie Jean King. 
</P>
<P>
But those are names from the past. Ojai's present consists of players who are 
ranked with triple digits, if at all. This should be considered a direct result 
of the tournament's purse: There are lots of zeroes, but no prime number to 
anchor them. 
</P>
<P>
The funny thing is, the exclusive Ojai Valley Tennis Club, which organizes the 
tournament, couldn't care less. The image of corporate sponsorship doesn't suit 
its fancy. Fred and his hat might get lost in the shuffle of money. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, enough players still come out -- more than 1,500 this year -- and so 
do a multitude of fans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's Magic' 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wants to play Ojai. The name, it's magic," said Paul Xanthos, a high 
school and junior college tennis coach for 43 years. "It is the amateur 
tournament. When you mention Ojai, everybody wants to go there." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, there is still something to be said for a tournament with riches of 
setting and substance. 
</P>
<P>
Ojai's history is as colorful as the flowers that adorn Libbey Park, where the 
tournament's championship matches were scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament was started in 1896 by William Thacher, the associate headmaster 
at Ojai's Thacher School. The school served as host during the tournament's 
infancy, when matches were played on a dirt surface cleared of pebbles by hand. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High School Player 
</P>
<P>
Lamb, whose father was a Los Angeles-based screenwriter, attended Thacher and 
played in the Ojai twice as a high school student. He has participated in the 
tournament in some way for most of the past half century. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1954, Lamb has been a history teacher and tennis coach at his alma mater, 
where tuition is $14,350 and freshmen are required to have horses. His job at 
the school was at first considered temporary. He was hired to replace a teacher 
who was taking a one-year leave of absence. "It's been a long year," Lamb said 
while relaxing at the school last week after a tennis match. 
</P>
<P>
He has only rarely thought of leaving. "I've been down there almost every day 
since I started teaching here," said Lamb, gesturing toward Thacher's tennis 
courts, "and I'm never tired of the vista and the broad sweep of the valley 
down below." 
</P>
<P>
Thacher School is nestled in the hills bordering Los Padres National Forest, 
tucked amid orange groves and oak trees at the northeast tip of the Ojai 
Valley. The view of the expanse below Lamb's afternoon office is, indeed, 
inspiring. 
</P>
<P>
On this afternoon it inspires memories. 
</P>
<P>
Lamb played in five Ojai tournaments, but one in particular is most memorable. 
As a Thacher School freshman, Lamb registered to compete in the under-15 
division, but it got overdrawn. So, rather than sitting out the tournament, 
Lamb requested any spot that might become available. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll find a place for you," he was told. Lamb didn't find out that he had 
been placed in the Open division until the day before the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Round Draw 
</P>
<P>
His first-round draw: Jack Tidball, an NCAA champion from UCLA who then was the 
No. 4-ranked player in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Worse, the match was to be played on the courts at Thacher, "so my humiliation 
took place before the entire school," Lamb said. 
</P>
<P>
Tidball dispatched Lamb, 6-0, 6-0, but the match was not com- pletely without 
excitement. 
</P>
<P>
Lamb managed a 40-15 lead in one game, drawing a roar of anticipation from the 
home crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was real excited," Lamb said. "He had to take his sweat shirt off. 
That was my big triumph. He realized he was in danger of losing a game, so then 
he poured it on." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eventual Champion 
</P>
<P>
At least Lamb could say later that his exit from the tournament came courtesy 
of the eventual champion. 
</P>
<P>
Lamb has been tournament manager since 1959, when he took over at the last 
minute after his predecessor became ill. 
</P>
<P>
The job had been a paying one, but it didn't stay that way for long. The 
tournament treasurer happened to be Newton K. Chase, Thacher's headmaster and 
Lamb's boss, who was convinced Lamb would be happier as a volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
"Wouldn't it be rather embarrassing to accept even a modest check?" Chase asked 
Lamb. "Yes, of course," was the sheepish reply. 
</P>
<P>
Chase was probably the last person to have bullied Lamb in relation to his 
position with the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
As manager, Lamb has the responsibility of judge and jury when it comes to 
defaults, and he rules with an iron hand. There are few good excuses when a 
player's tardiness forces the tournament to run behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear some very tragic stories that make me feel just terrible," Lamb said 
with more than just a trace of a smile. 
</P>
<P>
One player claimed he was late because he had been in jail. Another time, USC's 
team claimed it had been stuck in the elevator of a Ventura hotel for 45 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"A UCLA guy was seen lurking around," Lamb quipped. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Matches 
</P>
<P>
With about 750 matches scheduled for Thursday and hundreds more over the course 
of the tournament, Lamb had to handle any requests for defaults. The decision 
is essentially his, although, Lamb says, "if they take affront, or are outraged 
by my unfairness, then they can always appeal to the referee." 
</P>
<P>
The process became somewhat comical during the four years Lamb served in both 
capacities. 
</P>
<P>
Said Lamb: "They would ask for an appeal and I would turn around, tip my hat 
and say, 'Is there a problem?' " 
</P>
<P>
The top players are rarely involved in controversies, Lamb is happy to report, 
but he can remember one exception. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Smith, the Wimbledon champ who is among Lamb's very favorite players, was 
once 40 minutes late for a final. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Stan Smith' 
</P>
<P>
"He was always on time and always very generous about the way he played and, 
wouldn't you know, after I boasted about him, 1 o'clock passes and no Stan 
Smith," Lamb said. "Ten minutes after and people started to ask, 'Are you going 
to default Stan Smith?' " 
</P>
<P>
When 20 minutes -- the normal grace period -- had passed, Lamb was confronted 
by a player he had defaulted earlier in the tournament. "You're making 
exceptions, now aren't you, just because it's Stan Smith," the man said. 
</P>
<P>
That was exactly what he was doing, Lamb conceded. But not just because it was 
Smith. A large contingent of fans had paid money to witness the finals and Lamb 
wanted to give them every opportunity to see a good show. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Smith appeared, calmly sauntering across the lawn before checking in. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Mr. Smith, I wouldn't believe this,' " Lamb said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith: "What?" 
</P>
<P>
Lamb: "You let me down. I said you were always 20 minutes early." 
</P>
<P>
Smith: "I am 20 minutes early." 
</P>
<P>
Lamb: "No, you're 40 minutes late." 
</P>
<P>
Smith: "But it's . . . oh no . . . daylight savings . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"He turned as red as his hair," Lamb said. 
</P>
<P>
Delays, however, have been rare over the years. Considering the tournament is 
for amateurs -- and run by them as well -- things usually go off without a 
hitch. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Donating Their Time 
</P>
<P>
Exactly how it is all so smoothly accomplished Lamb can't say. In all, about 
500 people -- some of whom have never played a game of tennis -- donate their 
time and talent each year. 
</P>
<P>
"The tennis club does so much in the way of preparation that the actual running 
of the tournament is really amazingly simple," Lamb said. Still, he admits, 
"there have been times I remember thinking that there must be easier ways of 
passing time." 
</P>
<P>
Easier, perhaps, but not necessarily better. 
</P>
<P>
In 10 days, there will be a meeting to start the planning for next year's 
tournament. Lamb plans on being there for the 32nd time, his 21st with the hat 
-- a trademark that will likely follow him to the Ventura County Sports Hall of 
Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Lamb, whose Thacher teams have won seven Southern Section tennis championships, 
is scheduled to be inducted during a ceremony on May 27. 
</P>
<P>
It's a prestigious feather in his cap, but not more important than the cap 
itself. "I've worn it so long now that it's become part of the tournament," 
Lamb said of his chapeau. "It used to be bright red, but the dust and sweat of 
the ages have put an end to that."

UNBELIEVERS CRUSADING FOR CONTROL OF ATHEIST'S FORTUNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
During his long life, there were many things the eccentric and outspoken James 
Hervey Johnson detested, among them blacks, alcohol, Jews, lawyers, Catholics, 
people on welfare, modern medicine, Mexicans, meat, liberals and communists. 
But there was one thing he hated most of all: religion. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a devout atheist and notorious tightwad, worshiped money. And now, 
several months after his death at age 87, atheists, including the most well 
known in the nation, Madalyn Murray O'Hair, are fighting for control of 
Johnson's estate, worth $16.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
According to his will, the millions were to be placed in a trust and the income 
used to "expose religion as against reason . . . and to publicize my views on 
religion and health" as well as to continue the Truth Seeker, a monthly 
magazine Johnson published and edited and which, at 116 years, is the oldest 
atheist publication in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts a stubborn and cantankerous man, Johnson left legal control of 
his estate in the hands of his former banker, who happens to be a church-going 
Episcopalian, and the magazine is being run by a woman who is a Mormon. To 
O'Hair, this is blasphemy. 
</P>
<P>
She contends that Johnson's money was left to promote atheism and that it's 
ridiculous to think that anyone who believes in God has any notion of how to do 
that. Then why didn't Johnson leave his estate to O'Hair? Because he despised 
her. 
</P>
<P>
And she loathed him. She continues to refer to the man she says she knew for 40 
years as "James Scurvy Johnson." 
</P>
<P>
That so much attention is being paid to a man who had no close friends, was a 
chronic complainer and who routinely angered many of his acquaintances seems 
ironic. If it wasn't for the money and his will, his niche in history might 
have been that of "village atheist," in the words of Jack Schebesta, 58, who 
calls himself a humanist and freethinker and who knew Johnson for about 25 
years. 
</P>
<P>
James Hervey Johnson was born in Ohio in 1901 and as a child moved to San 
Diego. For many years he ran a downtown bookstore that dispensed atheist books 
and literature and led to contacts with people such as Schebesta and Bonnie 
Lange, the woman who today publishes the Truth Seeker and who remains his 
biggest supporter and praises him as a staunch individualist. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Elected Assessor 
</P>
<P>
Johnson trumpeted his prejudices and beliefs in several ways. He posted 
hand-painted signs in his Hillcrest yard and staged seminars devoted to 
rationalists such as Voltaire, Thomas Paine and Robert Ingersoll. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1930s, Johnson was elected San Diego County assessor, and later 
stunned those with Establishment views when he advocated taxing church 
property. He was removed as assessor after he was convicted on a charge of 
misusing public funds because he had exceeded his authority in giving back tax 
refunds. 
</P>
<P>
In 1952, Johnson's sick mother, then 79, took him to court on charges that he 
had assumed control of her money, cutting off her access to $31,000, and had 
failed to pay her $2,000 hospital bill. A hospital administrator testified that 
Johnson hadn't responded to numerous requests to pay the bill. In typical 
fashion, Johnson refused to discuss the case with acquaintances, telling them 
it was none of their business. Others say he took over because his mother was 
senile. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a vegetarian, was also a vehement booster of natural foods and 
holistic health concepts, but even here, he went to the extreme. Some of his 
associates said his excessiveness was part of a "Loony Tunes" diet. 
</P>
<P>
He fasted often, sometimes for a few days, sometimes for longer, to remove, he 
said, toxins from his body. He would go for long periods consuming nothing more 
than orange juice and condensed milk. He distrusted modern medicine and refused 
to take even the mildest of drugs, such as aspirin, because he believed he was 
a better master of his health. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Had Skin Cancer 
</P>
<P>
Johnson had skin cancer, and it led to his left ear simply crumbling away. It 
was common for him to stick a paper towel in his ear hole. About three years 
ago, his condition became severe and he was hospitalized with bacterial 
meningitis. 
</P>
<P>
He died alone in an austere Hillcrest apartment last August, felled by a heart 
attack as he soaked for hours in his bathtub, a practice he found eased his 
pains. 
</P>
<P>
While still healthy, Johnson remained a bitter and hostile opponent of 
religion. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1960s, he took over publication of the Truth Seeker and assumed 
control of the American Assn. for the Advancement of Atheism (AAAA) and the 
National League for the Separation of Church and State, two old-line atheist 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine's former publisher had used it to rail against blacks and Jews, 
and under Johnson's reign the attacks against a broad range of purported 
enemies continued, ranging from those on welfare to those critical of South 
Africa. Through the Truth Seeker, Johnson offered publications such as "Racial 
Loyalty Pro White Paper," "White American Resistance" and wrote articles 
abusing Catholics and communists. He wrote statements such as "The 
Negro-breeding do-gooder does not understand geometrical increase of human 
beings," and "If gorillas could speak, equalists would denounce as racists 
whoever would refuse to accept them as brothers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small Circulation 
</P>
<P>
It was vile and it was revolting and drove many people away, including those 
who tried to befriend him, according to several longtime associates. At his 
death, circulation of the magazine, an amateurish publication filled with 
typographical errors, was no more than a few hundred. 
</P>
<P>
According to his lawyers, Johnson amassed his fortune by selling property his 
family owned in San Diego and using the money to invest in the stock market. 
O'Hair and her supporters contend that he "stole" the money from wills left in 
his name by dead atheists. The accusation, however, has not been proven, and 
O'Hair's critics make the same charge about her. 
</P>
<P>
There is no dispute that when he died, he left behind a $16.5-million estate, 
most all of it consisting of tens of thousands of shares of blue-chip stocks. 
</P>
<P>
At least since 1983, O'Hair had been trying to get Johnson to relinquish 
control of his estate and the two atheist organizations. But in typical O'Hair 
fashion, her tact was bombastic. 
</P>
<P>
"You are a dying, defunct, discredited, old man who will grow moldy in an 
unmarked grave, having squandered atheist funds on the stock market," she wrote 
him six years ago. "In the interests of a movement which you have injured by 
your presence in it, it appears to me that you should be now making 
arrangements to turn everything over to American Atheists, which can do 
something since it is a viable, militant organization of excellent leadership, 
organization and elan." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lawsuit Filed 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Johnson wrote a will giving control of the Truth Seeker to the AAAA. 
O'Hair was sent a copy of the document anonymously. In the fall of that year, 
O'Hair and her associates filed a lawsuit in federal court in San Diego, 
claiming that they were members of AAAA and held stock in the Truth Seeker's 
parent company. Additionally, the suit alleged that Johnson had commingled 
funds from the atheist organizations with his own personal bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
The suit asked the court to recognize O'Hair and her supporters as the true 
owners of the corporations and the magazine, and O'Hair launched a duplicate of 
the Truth Seeker. 
</P>
<P>
And because there was a dispute over who owned stock in the Truth Seeker 
corporation, O'Hair allegedly printed up her own stock certificates, held a 
board meeting attended by her and her supporters and voted Johnson out of 
power. 
</P>
<P>
He might have been ill, but Johnson immediately launched a counterattack. 
O'Hair and the others, he said, were trying to take his money away, and they 
wanted to make sure that his non-atheist executor had nothing to do with the 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson did one more thing: he filed a hand-written, one-paragraph codicil to 
his will that took control of the Truth Seeker from the AAAA and essentially 
left it in control of the executor of his estate, Lawrence Y. True. And now, 
Johnson's lawyers have accused O'Hair in a civil lawsuit of racketeering for 
her alleged manipulations to take control of Johnson's organizations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Challenged 
</P>
<P>
A month after Johnson's death, O'Hair broadened her legal attack, formally 
challenging the will in probate court, disputing among other things the fees 
being paid to lawyers to defend the estate and the $10,000 a month being spent 
to produce the Truth Seeker, an amount she called "grotesquely large." 
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, O'Hair and other atheists received a crushing setback when 
Superior Court Judge Peter E. Riddle ruled against their probate lawsuit, a 
judgment punctuated when a disgruntled atheist in the audience rose and asked 
the judge what religion he was and whether he attended church on Sundays. A 
lawyer for O'Hair, Georgine Brave of San Diego, said it's likely there will be 
an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling allows True to begin spending money from the estate for, among other 
things, publishing the Truth Seeker and defending against O'Hair's other 
lawsuit in federal court, in which she is seeking control of the magazine and 
the two atheist organizations operated by Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that True is executor of the estate riles atheists almost as much as 
religion. "We can't stand by and watch this given away to a Christian," said 
atheist Stephen Thorne, 34, a mental health worker for San Diego County who 
briefly worked with Johnson. "That's like giving B'nai B'rith to Yasser 
Arafat." 
</P>
<P>
Although his salary for handling the estate has yet to be determined by the 
court, it's likely that True will receive about $80,000 a year for his 
services. His salary, plus payments to attorneys, accountants and others, will 
likely consume several hundred thousand dollars from the estate, a prospect 
that enrages atheists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Business Relationship 
</P>
<P>
For True, the entire episode has been disconcerting and has caused him grief in 
his own church. A lawyer by training, he spent much of his working life as a 
trust officer at Security Pacific Bank in San Diego. True knew Johnson for 25 
years because True had tried to get some of Johnson's business. "He did open a 
small trust account . . . but it was very difficult to get his business," True 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The two were never close, talking only a few times a year, with Johnson, who 
changed lawyers as often as most people change socks, calling him for advice. 
</P>
<P>
True, 66, retired last year to work full time on the estate. He says Johnson 
was well aware of his religious background when Johnson asked him to be 
executor in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he trusted atheists, and especially Mrs. O'Hair," True said. 
Even so, True says he and his wife agonized between his role as the trustee of 
a multimillion-dollar fund created to "expose religion" and his being an 
Episcopalian who is active in his congregation and regularly attends church on 
Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of thinking about that. My family at one point early on said, 
'Don't do it. Don't accept.' So we went to see our parish priest and in a 
private meeting told him about (the dilemma). He said it was our moral 
obligation to carry out this edict," True said. 
</P>

'That Hurt Me' 
</P>
<P>
But that didn't stop some pillars of the church from open skepticism. "They'd 
see me and ask, 'What are you doing down there?' That hurt me to the quick." 
</P>
<P>
Atheists aren't the only threat to Johnson's estate. True and Johnson's last 
lawyer, Roy R. Withers of San Diego, say that, because of Johnson's 
obstinateness, nearly $9 million of the $16.5 million may be eaten away by 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to fight like cats and dogs," Withers says of his former client, who 
wrote articles damning lawyers. Some of those fights centered on Johnson's 
vociferous refusal to shelter his estate from taxes by creating, for example, a 
tax-exempt foundation. "He just didn't want to listen," True says. 
</P>
<P>
O'Hair says she would rather have all the money consumed by taxes than have 
what's left of the estate be "run by anybody religious." 
</P>
<P>
Under the tutelage of True and Lange, who was appointed president of the Truth 
Seeker company by True, the Truth Seeker bears little resemblance to the 
magazine published by Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Look 
</P>
<P>
The latest issue, produced at a cost of $10,000, is printed on high-quality 
stock and slick paper, runs 36 pages and is heavy with articles such as "Carbon 
Dioxide and the Greenhouse Effect," "Can More Touching Lead to Less Violence in 
Our Society?" "GAIA: The Goddess of Science and Poetry," and "Invoking the 
Spirit of Eco-Feminism." 
</P>
<P>
Only near the last page is there any sign of Johnson or his beliefs, and that 
is in the form of a first installment of the serialization of "Superior Men," a 
book written by Johnson in 1949. The book apparently contains none of the 
racism and anti-Semitism that were to mark the author a little more than a 
decade later. 
</P>
<P>
Some atheists and others -- including those who have no allegiance to O'Hair 
and are alienated by her tactics -- believe the revitalized publication has 
nothing at all to do with fulfilling Johnson's intentions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's dreadful to say the least," said Schebesta, a retired pianist who says he 
is repulsed by what he calls O'Hair's vulgarity. "This is the most garbled, 
muddled metaphysical mush . . . that emphasizes the abolition of everything 
that is controversial. It's verbal nonsense. There is no reflection of 
(Johnson's) thought. Zero. Mr. Johnson might have been a bigot and a racist but 
at least he was clear." 
</P>
<P>
True and Lange say they have attempted to remove the racism and anti-Semitism 
from the Truth Seeker and want it to reflect a broader range of philosophy and 
promote more mainstream holistic health. True says he is even considering using 
some of the money from the estate for scholarships so students can study 
religion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lange Not an Atheist 
</P>
<P>
Lange, who is being paid $3,000 a month as president of the Truth Seeker 
company, maintains that Johnson was no longer a strict atheist when he died. 
Johnson, she says, had changed into a freethinker, a philosophy she said 
includes atheists, agnostics, humanists, "all kinds of people," and it is the 
intent of the new Truth Seeker to reflect that. Lange, who says she knew 
Johnson better than anyone and that he never made derogatory statements about 
blacks or Jews in her presence, is not an atheist.

LOW-KEY BUSH ABANDONS SLICK IMAGE STRATEGY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few months ago, when Stephen Studdert signed on as an aide to newly elected 
President Bush, he was put in charge of selecting something known in White 
House jargon as "the theme of the week." 
</P>
<P>
Studdert was supposed to sift through the President's agenda each week and pick 
out a single point the White House would emphasize in everything it said and 
did -- from speeches and press briefings to television appearances and "photo 
opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
The idea, developed by earlier presidents and raised to a high science by 
Ronald Reagan, was to avoid internal babble and maximize the Administration's 
impact on public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diversity of Governing 
</P>
<P>
Yet in the scattershot White House of George Bush, the task proved unexpectedly 
tough. By the week of April 17, Studdert was about ready to give up. Surveying 
the untidy bundle of unrelated matters the President considered important that 
week, the only theme Studdert could come up with was no theme at all: He called 
the week's schedule "the diversity of governing." 
</P>
<P>
Studdert's experience reflects one of the most striking features of Bush's 
young presidency: With little fanfare, the new chief executive and his team 
have abandoned the elaborate, tightly controlled machinery developed in recent 
years to project, manipulate and polish a presidential image -- machinery so 
pervasive and ingrained that it came to seem an indispensable tool of national 
leadership. Indeed, some considered it the soul of the presidency in the 
television age. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Bush has returned to media-massaging techniques perfected years before 
the audience of the television show "thirtysome-thing" were ever born -- 
inviting reporters to lunch, to play horseshoes, see a movie or coo at the 
White House puppies. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, some admirers say, Bush is posing a basic question: Can the 
President of the United States really lead simply by trying to develop popular 
policies -- without slick television packaging and elaborate schemes to 
manipulate the news media? As a political consultant might put it, is substance 
enough? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High in Opinion Polls 
</P>
<P>
With public opinion polls showing Bush's popularity as high as 71%, the White 
House argues that the approach is working. The Wall Street Journal even quoted 
sources suggesting that Bush's low-tech approach was actually the height of 
cunning, for it distinguished him from perceptions that Reagan was a shallow 
actor. 
</P>
<P>
But the Bush approach is not without its critics. Some question whether the 
Bush team's failure to communicate its vision for the future reflects the lack 
of anything to communicate. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing that's missing at this point in this presidency is a sense of 
where this President wants to go," said Republican political analyst David 
Keene of the American Conservative Union. "Being everyone's next-door neighbor 
is, frankly, not sufficient for national leadership." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Question Support 
</P>
<P>
Others wonder whether Bush's aversion to grand themes and dramatic gestures 
will leave him without a core of passionate supporters to fall back on if 
things turn sour at home or abroad. The problem with not communicating a vision 
is that it leaves you without a "political base for the long haul," said former 
Reagan White House Communications Director David Gergen, now editor-at-large of 
U.S. News &amp; World Report. 
</P>
<P>
"We have seen presidents who were high up in the polls," Gergen said, "but 
without a solid safety net of support there is an enormous potential to slide 
very fast. . . . You need symbols, things that people can relate to." 
</P>
<P>
Even now, he argued, people can remember moments about the Reagan era -- the 
return of the hostages from Iran just after Reagan took office, his decision to 
decertify the air traffic controllers union, the 40th anniversary of the 
Normandy invasion. These came to represent something larger about the man and 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
While Bush has succeeded in demonstrating his warmth, Gergen thinks his 
generally low-key approach may blend his message into the background. "It is 
important for the White House to see presidential activities as more than 
wallpaper and Muzak," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush advisers profess puzzlement at such complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"Eight years ago, the press was beating up on the White House for managing the 
news," said a senior White House staff member. "Eight years later, that same 
press corps is beating up on the White House for not managing the news." 
</P>
<P>
The media tactics represented by the "theme of the week" evolved over the past 
decade and more, but may have reached their zenith under Michael K. Deaver in 
the early Reagan years. It was then that media strategy and tactics became 
major considerations in almost every White House decision. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's public actions were meticulously choreographed for maximum media 
impact. Moreover, to enhance White House influence over what subjects would 
dominate the news, his public appearances, comments and availability were 
strictly rationed and controlled so that the news media often had little choice 
but to use the images and comments Deaver and his lieutenants had planned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foreshadows Reagan 
</P>
<P>
Reagan was not the first President to travel that road. Jimmy Carter brought 
advertising executive Gerald Rafshoon into the White House as an adviser on 
media and politics -- the so-called "Secretary of Symbolism." 
</P>
<P>
Bush himself followed the advice of such experts during his campaign last year. 
He stuck with themes carefully scripted to work well on the emotional medium of 
television, such as the Pledge of Allegiance and the prison furlough program 
that released convict Willie Horton. 
</P>
<P>
But with the campaign over, Bush began to change, arguing that running for 
office is different from governing. 
</P>
<P>
In the early weeks of his presidency, advisers talked about Bush's wanting to 
establish his "values" and themes. He spoke frequently about education, drug 
abuse and ethics in government and business. 
</P>
<P>
But once he had done that, even this pattern to his activities -- and thus too 
the message he sought to leave with the American public -- became less clear. 
</P>
<P>
To hear senior aides tell it, communications strategy is something that no 
longer always comes up in the morning session of top staff members. Rather, it 
is often catch-as-catch-can. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small-Scale Activities 
</P>
<P>
Bush has devoted much of his schedule to small-scale activities with which he 
feels comfortable: frequent trips outside of Washington that generally do not 
involve major speeches, ceremonies in the Rose Garden and personal encounters 
with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The result has been a less visible President. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Center for Media and Public Affairs in Washington, during his 
first 60 days in office, Bush received about one-half the network television 
coverage Reagan received during the same period in 1981, and about 57% of the 
coverage given Jimmy Carter during the first 60 days of Carter's tenure. 
</P>
<P>
When Bush announced his much-anticipated plan for education, for instance, he 
did so with only a Rose Garden ceremony at which no children were even on stage 
-- and the New York Times put the story inside. When he delivered on a campaign 
promise to help working parents meet child-care needs, Bush left it to 
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater to disclose the details on camera. 
</P>
<P>
Bush aides say their approach to communications is designed for the long haul. 
</P>
<P>
First, Bush's approach fits the man. Just as the previous Administration's 
media strategies were developed to take advantage of Reagan's singular talents 
for delivering a script on television, Fitzwater said, "What I have tried to do 
is develop techniques for communicating that take advantage of President Bush, 
and they're quite different." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outlines New Approach 
</P>
<P>
Viewing Bush as "good on his feet" and comfortable with "the give and take of 
dealing with the press," Fitzwater wrote a memorandum in December outlining new 
ways that the President could be accessible to the media. Since then, Bush has 
used such approaches as conducting interviews with small groups of reporters, 
dropping into the White House pressroom on short notice and inviting reporters 
to impromptu lunches. 
</P>
<P>
The idea, in part, was to avoid some of the episodes of the Reagan White House 
that Bush had thought undignified, such as having questions shouted at the 
President during photo sessions with foreign dignitaries and over the whirring 
roar of a waiting helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
Second, Bush's relatively low profile suits his more quiet and conciliatory 
approach to governing. 
</P>
<P>
Where Reagan as a Washington outsider used the club of public opinion to 
pressure Congress to support often-controversial programs, Bush so far has 
relied on face-to-face meetings, often in private, and usually involving 
compromise. The back-room agreement to sustain aid to the Nicaraguan Contras 
and the negotiations on the federal budget are two examples. 
</P>
<P>
White House Communications Director David F. Demarest talks about the 
small-scale events over time creating "a mosaic of impressions the public will 
have of the presidency." 
</P>
<P>
Or as White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu put it: "The President's agenda 
has a long-term perspective in it." And he and his colleagues are certain the 
public will see it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doubt Persists 
</P>
<P>
Yet doubt persists over how well-thought-out Bush's approach to communications 
really is. 
</P>
<P>
"There was never a conscious decision made initially to present Bush 
differently from President Reagan," said one senior aide privately. 
</P>
<P>
"The communications plan for this Administration is not in the files," said 
another. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it is a practical matter -- the only approach that Bush will allow. 
And for Bush, news media manipulation is simply not a high priority. 
</P>
<P>
He is a man, as one aide put it, with "a healthy ambivalence toward the 
headlines." 
</P>
<P>
It is no surprise. To get to the White House, this President overcame the tag 
of being a wimp, a verbal bumbler and a certain loser to, at various times, Bob 
Dole and Michael S. Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
Like others who have entered the White House by defying the consensus, Bush has 
developed a natural skepticism toward the conventional wisdom about how to 
build public support through communications. Some at the senior levels at the 
White House seem almost scornful of letting media strategy dictate overall 
planning. 
</P>
<P>
When asked why the President had not considered touring the devastation of the 
Alaska oil spill, for instance, one senior adviser said: "I don't think he has 
to embrace an oiled-up sea otter. . . . There is something tawdry about going 
up there and posing with an oil spill. There is a show business aspect that has 
nothing to do with cleaning it up."

INGENIOUS TACTICS BY ATTORNEYS MAY OFFSET LONG ODDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If anyone seemed destined for the gas chamber at San Quentin, it was Robert 
Anthony Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
The Redwood City, Calif., drug dealer was facing first-degree murder charges in 
two execution-style killings. His accomplice already had cut a deal with 
prosecutors and would be testifying against him. The outlook was grimmer still 
because Nelson had boasted of the killings to four people. They, too, were to 
be government witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Then Nelson's lawyer, Tom Nolan, hit on a decidedly unorthodox approach. He 
hired a talented writer to dig up as much sympathetic information as possible 
on Nelson. During trial, the attorney from Palo Alto used that information to 
portray Nelson as a life-long coward who had boasted of the killings merely to 
impress others. At one point, many of the jurors were in tears, Nolan recalled. 
</P>
<P>
They eventually convicted Nelson -- but only after nearly deadlocking on the 
question of Nelson's guilt. And rather than condemning him to die, they voted 
for life without parole. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan's unusual tactic is characteristic of the ingenuity of criminal defense 
lawyers when representing clients who face seemingly overwhelming evidence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The Wrong Move' 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of lawyers panic. That's the wrong move," said Larry Pozner, a Colorado 
attorney and lecturer. "Sometimes the bigger the case and the more evidence 
there is, the easier it is to pick it apart. Even the strongest cases can show 
great weakness." 
</P>
<P>
But not always. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, the legendary F. Lee Bailey conceded, there is little to do but "sit 
back and hope for two things: 1, that the government makes a mistake or, 2, 
that the judge makes a mistake -- so you get another crack." Added Harvard law 
professor Alan M. Dershowitz, "Sometimes the best you can do is go through the 
paces." 
</P>
<P>
One such seemingly difficult-to-defend case, based on prosecution evidence, is 
the current trial of Night Stalker suspect Richard Ramirez, who is charged with 
13 murders and 30 other felonies, including robbery and sexual assaults. 
</P>
<P>
With the prosecution having rested its case in Los Angeles Superior Court after 
about two months, six surviving victims have identified Ramirez as their 
attacker. Two others also have placed him at scenes of alleged Night Stalker 
attacks. There also appears to be a wealth of incriminating physical evidence 
against him, including shoe prints, fingerprints and firearms results, as well 
as a web of circumstantial evidence -- plus an alleged confession to boot. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez's attorneys are scheduled to begin presenting the defense case May 1. 
"It's a case of mistaken identity," said Ray G. Clark, one of his defense 
lawyers. "He's no choirboy, but Mr. Ramirez was nowhere near these incidents." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Negotiated Pleas 
</P>
<P>
Most criminal prosecutions, of course, never go to trial. About 90% of all 
criminal filings throughout the country are disposed of through negotiated 
pleas, according to Gregory Thompson, chief deputy district attorney for Los 
Angeles County. Of the remainder, about 80% end in guilty verdicts, he said. 
But the more serious a case, the less the likelihood of a plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
And to be sure, not all criminal defendants are guilty. Just most of them. 
</P>
<P>
"Any criminal lawyer who tells you that most of his clients are not guilty is 
either bluffing or deliberately limiting his practice to a few innocent 
defendants," said Dershowitz. "Almost all criminal defendants are, in fact, 
guilty." 
</P>
<P>
Still, criminal lawyers must concede nothing when defending a case with 
seemingly overwhelming evidence, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"Most cases, at least initially, appear overwhelming -- until you start 
investigating," said Mary Broderick, an attorney with the National Legal Aid 
and Defender Assn. in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
A sometimes-overlooked approach is to focus on what evidence the government 
doesn't have, according to law professor Edward J. Imwinkelreid of UC Davis. 
"The path not taken is one of the best ways to create reasonable doubt. Look 
for the gaps." 
</P>
<P>
Pozner agreed. "When you first get a case, it may seem overwhelming. That's 
because the reports are written by the police, who think your client is guilty. 
And so they include only the information they want you to know, which is 
usually less than all there is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"So you have to go out, redo the entire investigation, and then you may find 
out that the facts aren't nearly as harmful because they fit with innocence as 
well as guilt," Pozner said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'You Can't Give Up' 
</P>
<P>
Added Wilbur F. Littlefield, the chief Los Angeles County public defender: 
"Lots of times, the case on paper looks better than it really is. So you can't 
give up. You may find witnesses who will say, 'That's not the man who did it.' 
But these people aren't in the police reports." 
</P>
<P>
He continued: "If there is an oral confession, why wasn't it written? If it was 
written, why wasn't it tape-recorded? Sometimes prosecutors are so enamored 
with the 97% that they do have that they forget to explain the 3% that they 
don't have." 
</P>
<P>
Imwinkelreid's advice: "Ask yourself: If what witnesses say is true, then what 
else should be true? Pointing to the lack of evidence is both a legitimate and 
often effective way of generating doubt." 
</P>
<P>
As illustration, he cited a recent, seemingly open-and-shut murder case in 
Philadelphia in which the prosecutor was confidently predicting a swift guilty 
verdict while the jury deliberated. After acquittal, several jurors explained 
that they were persuaded by the lack of fingerprints -- an issue the prosecutor 
never addressed, Imwinkelreid said. 
</P>
<P>
"With the proliferation of scientific advances, including genetic DNA testing, 
jurors expect to have such evidence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For prosecutors and defense lawyers alike, it is the complex case with 
multiple, first-degree murder counts that is rife with potential land mines. In 
these cases, said Imwinkelreid, "the sheer weight of a case can overwhelm a 
defense lawyer -- even when the client is innocent." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Spillover' Effect 
</P>
<P>
But for prosecutors, loading up a case with so many different counts can 
backfire, he said. A defense lawyer's ability to rebut just one charge may have 
a "spillover" effect that casts doubt on the other charges, Imwinkelreid said. 
The risk of jury confusion is also great in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
"Especially in serial-crime cases, if you can alibi one count -- by showing 
that it was done by someone else -- it really begins to weaken the prosecution 
case overall. So don't let the cumulative weight get to you. Tell the jury, 
'Let's take them one at a time.' Divide and conquer," Pozner added. 
</P>
<P>
But the ripple effect may cut the other way as well, said Dean Gerald Uelmen of 
the Santa Clara University College of Law. "If jurors are inclined to believe 
that the evidence is strong on one count, they are more likely to convict on 
all counts." 
</P>
<P>
Another key to defending seemingly lost-causes, according to attorney Gerald L. 
Chaleff of Los Angeles, is to develop a theme from the outset. If a client is 
unsavory, and the evidence appears incontrovertible, he said, a defense lawyer 
may need to focus on the "why" of a crime in order to gain jury sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
Another pervasive defense tactic is to delay a case endlessly. Witnesses may 
die. Their memories can fade. Evidence may be lost. And even if a defendant is 
eventually convicted and sent to prison, he will have received credit for time 
served in the local jail while awaiting trial. In the meantime, he has had the 
benefit of being closer to friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deputy D.A.'s View 
</P>
<P>
But such tactics border on the unethical, said Los Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Sterling E. Norris, a veteran prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obstructionism. They do it not just to delay but to frustrate jurors in 
hopes that just one -- and that's all it takes -- might become so angry that he 
will vote (against the government) to 'teach the system a lesson,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The goal of most defense lawyers is not winning, but hanging, a case," Norris 
fumed. 
</P>
<P>
Defense tactics, according to Uelmen, must also be driven by the prospect of an 
appeal, particularly in death penalty cases. 
</P>
<P>
"During such a trial, much of what a defense does is making and preserving a 
record in terms of issues that might lead to a reversal of appeal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dershowitz put it more bluntly: "You try to create a situation where there's 
error at trial -- so you can have an appeal." 
</P>
<P>
The Harvard professor elaborated: "It is the job of the defense lawyer -- 
especially when representing the guilty -- to prevent, by all lawful means, the 
'whole truth' from coming out. It is not only proper but also obligatory for a 
defense lawyer to object to the admission of truthful evidence if that evidence 
was improperly obtained or is prejudicial." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not our duty to walk on water," added Ephraim Margolin, a San Francisco 
attorney and current president of the National Assn. of Criminal Defense 
Lawyers. "But we have to ensure that our clients get a fair trial. Our job is 
to make sure the government is put to the duty of carrying the burden of proof 
in every conceivable way." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Penalty Phase 
</P>
<P>
In Uelmen's view, it is in the penalty phase of capital cases where defense 
lawyers "most frequently fall short . . . because they tend to focus so much 
energy on the guilt phase that they run out of steam by the penalty phase." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Uelmen said, when trying a death penalty case, a defense lawyer must keep 
in mind the eventual likelihood of having to ask a jury to spare his client's 
life. It is precisely for that reason that Palo Alto's Nolan took the novel 
approach of hiring a writer as a member of his defense team for the 1981 trial. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before taking on Nelson as a client, Nolan had read Norman Mailer's 
highly acclaimed "The Executioner's Song," based on the life of convicted 
murderer Gary Gilmore, who was executed by a Utah firing squad. 
</P>
<P>
The book persuaded Nolan that a good writer can create a sympathetic story 
about even a despicable criminal. So he hired Lacey Fosburgh, a one-time New 
York Times reporter and author of "Closing Time," a book about the so-called 
Mr. Goodbar murder in New York in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
After spending hundreds of hours interviewing Nelson and his family and 
friends, Fosburgh produced what Nolan called a richly textured and highly 
interpretive mosaic of Nelson that "no lawyer or private investigator I know 
of" could have come up with. 
</P>
<P>
Using that portrait, Nolan sought to demonstrate that Nelson was a timid person 
who had boasted of the killings because "he really wanted to kill the two 
people, but didn't have the nerve to do it and that his accomplice had done the 
actual killings." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Jurors in Tears' 
</P>
<P>
Nolan recalled: "The character of this person was very difficult for me to 
understand. But Lacey was able to paint a picture of Nelson which, by the time 
of the penalty phase had the jurors in tears." 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the San Mateo County Superior Court jury complained to the judge 
that it had had no option of a lesser sentence than life without parole, 
according to Fosburgh's subsequent account of the case in Forum, a magazine 
published by the California Attorneys for Criminal Justice. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors said they had barely considered the death penalty at all. 
"Furthermore," Fosburgh wrote, "they revealed they had been split 6 to 6 during 
the guilt phase on whether Nelson had committed one of the homicides." 
</P>
<P>
One juror explained the panel's ultimate verdicts by saying the killings had 
been "out of character," according to Fosburgh. 
</P>
<P>
The trial's dramatic high point came when defendant Nelson "fell apart over 
several hours of tortured testimony in which he said he wished he had killed 
the two people and would give anything to have his wife and his father -- 
sitting in the courtroom -- be able to look up at him and think he had done it 
rather than know he was a coward who hadn't," Fosburgh wrote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Background Investigations 
</P>
<P>
Many psychiatrists, psychologists, probation and parole officials do precisely 
the kind of background investigations that Fosburgh undertook in the Nelson 
case. 
</P>
<P>
But as Fosburgh noted: "First, they work exclusively with the defendant and do 
not seek out potential witnesses. In addition, their information about the 
defendant is often circumscribed by a conceptual framework that ends up as 
nothing but jargon to attorney and jury alike." 
</P>
<P>
Nolan's approach "is certainly not a formula for every case," she concluded. 
</P>
<P>
"But every case has its own particular puzzle, its own dilemma; and always 
there is an individual at the heart of it who has something about him that 
someone, somewhere, loves, that someone understands, and that someone finds 
appealing. The issue is to find the key to the puzzle and use it to the hilt."

WARMING TREND ADDS URGENCY TO STUDY OF ANCIENT SEQUOIAS

SEQUOIA NATIONAL PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thriving in pockets on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada, California's 
giant sequoias have bucked the odds for millions of years, surviving raging 
fires, glacial ice and the violent upheavals that create mountain ranges. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that, despite their tumultuous history, the Sequoia groves are 
in good shape and growing vigorously. 
</P>
<P>
But now the trees are facing a new peril, a relatively sudden global warming 
that may occur as a result of the greenhouse effect. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists are discovering that the sequoias are sensitive to subtle 
temperature variations associated with global climate changes. To survive, as 
they have in the past, the trees must have time to adjust, the experts report. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sense of Urgency 
</P>
<P>
These new findings have added a sense of urgency to a study of sequoias under 
way here and in Yosemite. By analyzing tree growth rings, sediments cored from 
nearby meadows and the mummified droppings of pack rats that lived in caves 
along the Kings River 35,000 years ago, the experts hope to learn more about 
how the trees have lived so long and what it will take to ensure their 
continued existence. 
</P>
<P>
The Sequoiadendron giganteum is one of the oldest and largest living things on 
the planet. The prime specimen is the 2,700-year-old General Sherman Tree, 
standing nearly 275 feet tall, with a base diameter of 36 feet and a trunk 
weight of 1,385 tons. 
</P>
<P>
Fossil evidence of these giants has been found in Colorado, Wyoming and Nevada, 
indicating that the great forests existed there before the tectonic upthrust of 
the Sierra 6 million years ago. The towering Sierra blocked the flow of Pacific 
storms over the Great Basin, drying out the land, dooming the sequoias east of 
the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Today thousands of these trees are clustered in 75 groves on the pine-forested 
western Sierra slopes. The northernmost groves are in federal forests near Lake 
Tahoe, and they range south 250 miles to the Tule River drainage in Tulare 
County. Nearly half of the trees are in national parks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bypassed Groves 
</P>
<P>
One riddle researchers are trying to solve is how the trees survived the Ice 
Age that ended 10,000 years ago. Originally, they theorized that perhaps the 
glaciers somehow had bypassed the groves. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, scientists were surprised to discover that the present-day 
groves date back only about 5,000 years. That meant that the groves surviving 
today did not come into existence until 5,000 years after the glaciers had 
melted away. 
</P>
<P>
New research, although far from conclusive, suggests that the groves survived 
by moving as the climate changed. Each new generation took root in a slow-step 
march up or down the mountains, seeking suitable climate, adequate soil 
moisture and nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
As the glaciers advanced, the sequoias moved to lower elevations, and after the 
ice flows melted, the groves moved to their current locations. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery that the trees may, in fact, move in response to global 
temperature changes was made by paleo-ecologist Scott Anderson, director of 
Northern Arizona University's pollen laboratory in Flagstaff. Anderson studies 
the pollen found trapped in sediments in Log Meadow in Giant Forest to find out 
what kind of plants have lived in this part of the park since the glaciers 
melted. 
</P>
<P>
By coring 30 feet into the sediments, Anderson discovered that until 4,500 
years ago, the dominant plants were pines, huckleberry and chinquapin bushes -- 
vegetation typical of a dry, open forest, a place without enough moisture to 
support sequoia growth. 
</P>
<P>
"There was virtually no sequoia pollen in Log Meadow 6,000 years ago," Anderson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
From that time forward, evidence of the big trees began to accumulate in the 
sediments, indicating that the Giant Forest grove grew rapidly, expanding until 
it began to dominate the landscape. Meadow grasses and other plants requiring 
plenty of moisture also began to flourish, Anderson found. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence suggests that immediately after the last glacial period, the area 
was warm and dry. This bit of information coincides with a known warming period 
that lasted several thousand years because Earth's solar orbit and the tilt of 
its axis put the Northern Hemisphere closer to the sun. 
</P>
<P>
During this time, summer temperatures rose enough to dry out the soils. When 
cooler, wetter climate returned, the soil moisture increased and meadow-like 
conditions made the area ideal for sequoia growth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Provide Clue 
</P>
<P>
All this may provide some clue as to how the sequoias may react to the kind of 
rapid global warming many scientists expect as a result of the greenhouse 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
"The altithermal (warm, dry period) is the best analog of what might happen if 
the greenhouse effect does occur," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
If temperatures do go up several degrees, as predicted, he said, "we would 
expect the type of vegetation that had grown in Log Meadow 6,000 to 10,000 
years ago . . . but no sequoias." 
</P>
<P>
The question then becomes what would happen to the sequoias. The supposition 
now is that the groves have survived climate changes by slowly moving and 
adapting to new locations, a natural process that requires thousands of years, 
park scientist Dave Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
The latest information suggests that the sequoias move long distances in their 
struggle to survive. The evidence has come from an odd source: ancient pack rat 
nests found in limestone caves in a rugged, low-elevation canyon along the 
Kings River. 
</P>
<P>
No sequoias grow in this hot, dry canyon now, but contents of the pack rat 
middens strongly suggest that the trees once grew here, according to 
ranger-scientist Ken Cole. The rats use the same nests, generation after 
generation, accumulating twigs, rocks, bones, nesting materials and anything 
else they find and can carry back to the den. The rat's urine mummifies these 
droppings, preserving them for eons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pack Rats 
</P>
<P>
Cole found several pack rat middens in the caves in Kings Canyon National Park, 
just north of Sequoia Park. In these ancient nests, there were mummified pieces 
of sequoia twigs and pollen, evidence that thousands of years ago the trees 
were growing close by, at elevations as low as 3,000 feet. The closest sequoias 
today are miles away, at much higher elevations. 
</P>
<P>
Carbon dating revealed Cole's findings were 18,000 to 35,000 years old. That 
meant the trees were here during the coldest part of the last glacial period. 
</P>
<P>
This, according to Cole, is the first direct evidence that the sequoias grew at 
these lower elevations during the Ice Age. The supposition is that as the globe 
warmed and the glaciers melted, the trees marched back up the steep mountains 
to their present location at around 7,000 feet elevation. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the sequoias can out-maneuver the kind of rapid global warming 
scientists now are predicting as a result of the greenhouse effect is open to 
question. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Release Gases 
</P>
<P>
Nature's slow-moving atmospheric clock has being speeded up by the impact of 
modern technology. As autos and industrial plants release more carbon monoxide 
and other gases into the air, more heat is trapped inside the atmospheric 
greenhouse. Some experts predict that temperatures could rise two to nine 
degrees over the next century. 
</P>
<P>
There is general scientific agreement that this global warming will occur at a 
rate 10 to 100 times faster than ever before, according to Stephen H. Schneider 
of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to temperature changes, scientists also are studying how sequoias 
react to fire and drought. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until the late 1960s that national park officials realized that fire 
was an essential ingredient in the sequoia ecosystem. By suppressing fires for 
a century, rangers had literally disrupted the sequoia's reproductive cycle. No 
new sequoias were sprouting. 
</P>
<P>
Now rangers systematically torch off small sections of the groves in control 
burns designed to return fire to its natural place in the ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fewer Seedlings 
</P>
<P>
They set the blazes without fully understanding the role of fire, Ranger Bill 
Tweed explained. The new studies are showing that the hottest fires seemed to 
be followed by rapid regeneration of sequoias, while cooler, more deliberate 
burns produced fewer seedlings and a lower survival rate. The reason why is not 
known. 
</P>
<P>
To learn more, scientists from the University of Arizona Laboratory of Tree 
Ring Research were given a $60,000-a-year contract to study fire and climate in 
the groves. The work is being directed by Tom Swetnam, one of the country's top 
tree-ring specialists. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with a chain-saw and an old truck, Swetnam has spent the last two summers 
prowling the Sierra, collecting cross-sections from sequoia stumps and downed 
trees, carting tons of wood back to the university's lab in Tucson for 
analysis. From the annual growth rings, Swetnam's staff can tell a tree's age, 
determine when it sprouted and plot it's year-by-year growth. 
</P>
<P>
In good years, when there's plenty of moisture, the rings are wide apart and 
full of growth, in drought years there is less growth and the rings compressed 
tightly together, like lines on a topographical map. Two- and three-year 
periods of drought are not uncommon, the most recent occurring in the mid-1970s 
and again between 1959 and 1961, Swetnam said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big Fire 
</P>
<P>
In the years immediately after a big fire that scars a tree, abnormal ring 
growth patterns swirl like storm clouds around the wound, showing how the tree 
tries to heal itself. Many of the big trees have huge fire scars. Some have 
been hollowed by fire and blasted by lightning, but still they have survived. 
</P>
<P>
One cross-section shows a tree had gone through 32 fires between AD 519 and AD 
1297. In the AD 1100-1200 period, the sequoias document a long period of 
drought that gripped much of the West. During wetter times, there were fewer 
fires, but the burns were hotter and more widespread, burning off entire stands 
of smaller pine and fir. 
</P>
<P>
"There was one huge fire in 1297 AD in Mountain Home (State Forest) . . . that 
seems to have killed off all of the understory (smaller pine trees)," Swetnam 
reported. "During the next few years, there was a tremendous growth release in 
the sequoias." 
</P>
<P>
Without the competing smaller trees, the growth rate among the sequoias 
tripled, and new stands sprouted in the burn scar.

END VIOLENCE, POPE URGES IN MADAGASCAR

ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pope John Paul II on Saturday warned this nation's youth, who within the last 
two weeks have been participating in a wave of lethal political riots, to 
"reject violence, lies and scorn" and to overcome their uneasiness over their 
future in a land of rising unemployment and poverty. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope's remarks came as he addressed a rally of about 20,000 young people 
from all over Madagascar on his first full day on the island nation off the 
east coast of Africa. The Pope also held a Mass in the old Portuguese port of 
Antsiranana at the island's northern tip. 
</P>
<P>
John Paul will continue his fifth African tour with stops in the French island 
colony of La Reunion, Zambia and Malawi before returning to Rome on May 6. 
</P>
<P>
His address to the Malagasy youth at a soccer stadium here in the capital 
largely took the form of responses to questions prepared by church youth 
leaders. He took the opportunity to admonish the youth to "respect your bodies, 
not risking thoughtlessly disease or accident . . . by turning to alcohol or 
drugs, which will reduce you to slavery." 
</P>
<P>
The pontiff did not specifically refer to AIDS as a disease, but then 
Madagascar may be the only African country where such a warning is unnecessary. 
Presumably because of the country's isolated geography and insular culture, at 
last count there were only three Malagasy people who have tested positive for 
the AIDS virus. All were said to be sailors with ports of call on the African 
mainland. 
</P>
<P>
Turning to the nation's deteriorating economy, the Pope seemed to acknowledge 
only in passing the concrete obstacles standing in the way of a higher standard 
of living in Madagascar. The country's crop of rice, a staple of which these 
people consume more per capita than any other nationality on earth, was 
decimated by cyclones in 1982, 1984, 1986 and 1987. The storms ruined 
Madagascar's goal of self-sufficiency in the crop and necessitated costly 
imports of rice instead. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Austerity Program 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a fiscal austerity program imposed by the International Monetary 
Fund as the price of millions of dollars in development grants and loans has 
forced up the cost of living in the cities more than threefold over the last 
two years. The IMF program included a devaluation of the Malagasy franc by more 
than half. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope did suggest Saturday that the developed nations must shoulder more 
responsibility toward the Third World. The problem of development, he said, 
"Stands at the level of the planet: It engages the most favored nations toward 
the poorest." But for the most part he laid the responsibility for development 
at the feet of the Malagasy people themselves. 
</P>
<P>
And in an apparent reference to the recent riots, which were sparked by 
allegations that vote fraud contributed to President Didier Ratsiraka's 
election to a third seven-year term, he urged the audience to begin "the 
defense of right and justice" by "your own personal comportment."

SALVO BREAKS LEBANON TRUCE; BOTH SIDES REFUSE TO LIFT BLOCKADES

A brief salvo of shells slammed into a Christian area of Lebanon on Saturday, 
violating a day-old cease-fire in the civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Each side in the conflict refused to lift blockades affecting the other's 
territory, and most shops and businesses stayed shut amid doubts that the truce 
would hold between Christian-led forces, and Syrian troops and their Muslim 
militia allies. 
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire, mediated by the 22-nation Arab League, took effect at midday 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Security sources said at least 20 artillery shells were fired at the Christian 
area of Amsheet near the ancient town of Byblos north of Beirut. Most landed in 
the sea. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Christian leader, Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, said late Friday that he will 
maintain a blockade of ports run by Muslim militias. The blockade had sparked 
artillery duels that killed more than 200 people in the last six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-Syrian political sources said Syria and its militia allies will continue 
blockading Christian areas until Aoun's forces lift their blockade. 
</P>
<P>
The Arab League, meeting in Tunis last week, had called for an end to the 
blockades as part of the cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
In Tunis, sources close to the league said Saturday that a Kuwaiti and an 
Algerian diplomat will visit Beirut early this week to arrange details for the 
deployment of an Arab observer force to monitor the cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
Beirut newspapers said an Arab League delegation will arrive within 24 hours 
and deploy along the so-called Green Line dividing Beirut into Muslim and 
Christian sectors. They are also to monitor mountains outside the capital 
separating Aoun's troops from the Syrian and Muslim forces, the newspapers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said only a few people risked passing through the Museum checkpoint 
on the Green Line on Saturday after Aoun ordered it reopened Friday. It is one 
of seven crossing points that in calmer periods of the civil war have linked 
the two sides of the city. 
</P>
<P>
In Kuwait, a key member of the Arab League, Prime Minister Sheik Saad Abdullah 
al Sabah, warned Saturday that Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war, in which 
hundreds of cease-fires have come and gone, is unlikely to end soon. 
</P>
<P>
"The tragic events the country has witnessed since 1975 cannot be ended 
overnight or within weeks," the Kuwaiti news agency quoted him as saying in 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Christian sources said Aoun, who has vowed to drive Syria's 40,000 troops from 
Lebanon, was dismayed that the Arab League did not refer to Syria's role in the 
fighting when declaring the truce.

IN ROME, IT'S SAME OLD STORY: CONGESTION, CRIME, CONFUSION

<TEXT>
<P>
Bedecked for spring with colorful sprays of azaleas and pickpockets, Mama Roma 
observed a new birthday not long ago, troubled by old complaints: Is the 
Eternal City governable? Is it livable? Is it safe? 
</P>
<P>
Romans and visitors wondered as both, con molto brio, marked April 21, 753 BC. 
On that day, legend says and Rome believes, Romulus and Remus, adopted sons of 
a providential wolf, laid the foundation of what would become one of the 
world's most beloved cities. 
</P>
<P>
In intervening centuries of splendor and sack, the city's administration, along 
with the security of Rome's people, have always been paramount civic 
preoccupations. Juvenal satirized imperial Rome's urban mess 19 centuries ago. 
Popes, consuls and emperors employed a gamut of guardians, from walls to geese, 
in futile attempts at keeping the barbarians at bay. 
</P>
<P>
Today is no different. In many aspects, a city that was once capital of the 
world is now Third World. If, as ever, Rome's beauty is unsurpassed, it is also 
tarnished. 
</P>
<P>
As it passed its 2,742nd birthday, Rome quite literally, had no city 
government. The mayor had quit after being accused of taking kickbacks on 
school lunches, and wrangling politicians had been unable to find a successor. 
</P>
<P>
In the piazza before a city hall designed by Michelangelo for greater pomp and 
circumstance sits an empty pedestal. One of the city's most powerful symbols, 
an equestrian statue of 2nd-Century Emperor Marcus Aurelius, belongs on the 
pedestal, but like so much of monumental Rome, it was damaged by air pollution. 
After lengthy restoration, the emperor and his horse are still absent from 
their place in the piazza. Debate rages over the future of the world's oldest 
bronze statue. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the doctors, and we have cured the patient," said Alessandra Melucco, 
the chief restorer. "What happens next is a political decision, but we know 
that if the statue is again displayed outdoors, it will die." 
</P>
<P>
Visitors are often disappointed, but Romans are by now inured to the endless 
monumental restorations that are so much a part of both the city's travail and 
its splendor. The continued absence of Marcus Aurelius from public view is 
muted this spring by the return of the Arch of Constantine and Trajan's Column 
from years of envelopment in restorers' cocoons. Other favorites, including the 
Trevi Fountain and the Pantheon, are newly encased in scaffolding. 
</P>
<P>
Of particular concern this year to the tourist hordes that are as much a 
fixture of Roman spring as the reopening of outdoor trattorie is a sharp rise 
in petty crime. It is no secret that 20th-Century vandals are inside the gates. 
Watch your purse and stay off the No. 64 bus to the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
Crimes of violence are still atypical, but purse snatchers, pickpockets and 
burglars are among the busiest of all Romans: They strike at an average of one 
every 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Tanja Trabost, a long-time British resident, had a tough March: She was mugged 
in Trastevere, her pocketbook was picked on a bus and her apartment was 
burgled. An American woman whose tire went flat on the historic Old Appian Way 
was delighted when a courtly Italian stopped to help. He jacked up the car, 
removed the flat, took her purse and drove off. 
</P>
<P>
Police, reporting a 25% increase in petty crime, blame heroin addicts in 
general and, in particular, bands of South Americans, Yugoslavs, North Africans 
and Gypsies. About 2,175 petty thieves were arrested in the first quarter of 
1989, nearly half of them foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
"People are getting worried, beginning to feel unsafe," said Vittorio Sgroi, 
the ranking criminal judge for Rome. Jammed buses like the No. 64 that ferry 
Romans and tourists around the choked city center are favorite targets of the 
pickpockets. 
</P>
<P>
A British couple were injured in a mugging last month, but even counting such 
incidents, Rome remains a unique open-air museum as safe as it is alluring. 
Among the American visitors who spent a total of nearly 2 million nights in 
Rome last year, 877 suffered the theft of their passports. 
</P>
<P>
"Petty crimes are more by stealth than violence," said U.S. Consul General 
Dudley G. Sipprelle. "In my three years here, we haven't had a single American 
hospitalized as a result of a mugging or robbery. My 76-year-old mother from 
Los Angeles just wandered all over the city for nine days without any trouble. 
Of course she didn't ride the buses, and she didn't carry all her documents or 
money when there was no need for them." 
</P>
<P>
What is galling about Rome for residents and visitors alike is that it lags 
woefully behind other European capitals in infrastructural improvements. These 
have not kept pace with a growing population. 
</P>
<P>
Rome, whose population has swelled by persistent migration from the countryside 
since World War II, is the only major European capital that is still growing. 
Services of all sorts lag: roads, schools, public transport, hospitals, 
parking. Tiberius got dispatches quicker from Gaul than today's Romans receive 
letters from relatives in the United States. And how many other metropolises of 
3 million these days have telephone numbers ranging anywhere from four to eight 
digits? 
</P>
<P>
Rome's arteries are so hardened that expert Bernard Winkler has been summoned 
from West Germany to mastermind yet one more effort to conquer the city's 
2,000-year-old traffic jam. Winkler earnestly promised that vehicular order 
"will be my Christmas present to the city this year." 
</P>
<P>
"Rome's current difficulties are the consequence of a sharp decline of the city 
in the last 20 or 30 years," Deputy Prime Minister Gianni De Michelis noted 
over a cup of inky espresso one recent morning. "Other European cities like 
Paris, Frankfurt and Milan have gone one way, closer to Europe. Rome has gone 
the other. More and more, it is like a Third World capital. 
</P>
<P>
"In two or three decades of great change in Europe, nothing was done to prepare 
Rome for a new way of life as an urban center," De Michelis added. 
</P>
<P>
Proposals to modernize local governments with clearer lines of authority are 
pending in Parliament -- and have been for years. 
</P>
<P>
The rites of this Roman spring also were leavened by a juicy scandal at City 
Hall, where Mayor Pietro Giubilo resigned after he and 31 others were accused 
of corruption by an investigating magistrate. 
</P>
<P>
Other magistrates are probing allegations of corruption in the traffic police, 
the city bus company and the municipal licensing and housing departments. The 
knaves, if they are uncovered, can only be featherbedding descendants of petty 
Roman functionaries who tried the patience of the Caesars.

JIM MURRAY: ONE MAN'S SUN-BAKED THEORY ON ATHLETIC SUPREMACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few days ago, NBC, which should have known better, presented a one-hour 
seminar-type TV program that undertook to show that blacks are better athletes 
than whites. Next week, presumably, they're going to have one to show the earth 
is round. Water is wet. 
</P>
<P>
But it's when they got into the reasons for blacks being superior that they got 
into water they couldn't tread. They brought in grave scientists to give 
learned discourses. And when they traced it to physiological racial 
differences, they raised the hackles on large segments of the populace. 
</P>
<P>
Any sportswriter could have told them that would happen. 
</P>
<P>
You see, none of us likes to be told we're different. Even if the differences 
are advantageous. With the exception of a few Anglo-Saxon eccentrics who 
despise the rest of mankind, we're a conformist lot. 
</P>
<P>
If we're good at something, we don't like to be told it's because we have this 
twitch muscle not given to the rest of human beings. It's like being able to 
see better because you've got three eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Great athletes, like great musicians, of course, have some gift the rest of 
mankind doesn't. Sam Snead, the great golfer, is double-jointed. Ted Williams, 
in his prime, had the eyesight of a hungry hawk. But these were hardly group 
legacies. 
</P>
<P>
Do black athletes have some edge that accounts for their preponderance of 
representation in all sports they undertake? Well, of course they do. There's 
an old saying that when a thing happens once, it can be an accident. Twice, it 
can be a coincidence. But if it keeps happening, it's a trend. 
</P>
<P>
The poor doctors on the network, a physiologist and an anthropologist who stuck 
their test tubes into this liquid dynamite of an issue, appeared on television 
to be politically and sociologically naive. 
</P>
<P>
They seemed startled that their innocent research could arouse such vehement 
passions as when the Berkeley sociologist, Harry Edwards, with whom few dare to 
cross adjectives and prepositions, thundered that their study was racist. You 
learn never to cross points of view with Harry. He's bigger than you are. Also 
louder. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists are not only naive, they were a little unscientific. To 
understand why American blacks were succeeding in such boggling numbers, they 
studied West Africans. Figure that one out. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take Harry Edwards long to point out -- correctly -- that American 
blacks are a long way genetically from any African blacks. The American black, 
like the American anything, is a mixture of races, cultures and pigments. 
Sherman's army has descendants in every ghetto in America, you can bet me. 
Edwards himself reminded the panel that he had great, great grandparents who 
were Irish. So did I but I never had a good jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
Harry likes to think racism and segregation drove the young blacks into the one 
avenue open to them in a closed society -- sports. They got good at them 
because they were desperate. 
</P>
<P>
I can buy that. Up to a point. Deprivation is a powerful motivating force. So 
is hatred. There's very little doubt raging hatred made Ty Cobb excel after the 
day he came home and found that his mother had shot and killed his father by 
"accident." Cobb set out to make the world pay. 
</P>
<P>
But I would like to offer my own theory of athletic supremacy. 
</P>
<P>
Unweighted by any scientific gobbledygook, not bogged down by any documented 
research, not even cluttered by facts, Murray's Law of Athletic Supremacy is 
beautiful in its simplicity, based on a longtime non-balancing of the issues, a 
resolute refusal to entertain any other points of view. Charles Darwin, I'm 
not. I base my findings on that most incontrovertible of stances -- total 
ignorance. Compared to me, Darwin was equivocal. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, I don't think it is twitch muscles or long tendons or larger 
lungs or even that old standby, rhythm, that contrives to make 
African-Americans superior athletes. 
</P>
<P>
In the second place, I have never been able to understand the convoluted 
scientific efforts to explain away the darker pigment on some human beings. To 
me, it is a simple matter of geography. The closer you get to the Equator, the 
darker the skin. 
</P>
<P>
I mean, aren't southern Italians darker than Swedes? Skin coloring is a 
function of climate. I will cling to this notion until a blond, blue-eyed baby 
is born to natives in Zimbabwe or a black-skinned child emerges in Scandinavia. 
</P>
<P>
I am absolutely positive that if you had put a colony of Irishmen in the Sudan 
in, say, 5000 BC, their descendants would be black today. If you had put a 
Sudanese population in Dublin in 5000 BC, their descendants would have red 
hair. 
</P>
<P>
Now, we come to athletic prowess. Murray's Law is simple: Athletic prowess is 
bestowed on that part of the population that is closer to the soil, deals with 
a harshness of existence, asks no quarter of life and gets none. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing in my business, journalism, makes me laugh louder than to pick up a 
paper and find some story, marveling wide-eyed, at how some deprived youngster 
from a tar paper shack in Arkansas, one of 26 children, rose to become 
heavyweight champion of the world, all-world center in the NBA, home run 
champion or Super Bowl quarterback. Well, of course he did. That's 
dog-bites-man stuff. 
</P>
<P>
A much bigger, more astonishing story would be if a youngster came out of a 
silk-sheets, chauffeur-to-school, governess-at-home atmosphere in the mansions 
of Long Island to become heavyweight champion of the world, or even left 
fielder for the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
You always get great athletes from the bottom of the economic order. That goes 
back to the days of ancient Rome, when the gladiators were all slaves (later 
Christians, and we all know the early Christians were the poor). 
</P>
<P>
In this country, the lineups of professional teams were always filled with the 
names of farm boys or the sons of the waves of immigrants who came over here 
from the farmlands of Ireland or Germany or Italy or Poland. How do you think 
Shoeless Joe got his nickname? Why do you think he couldn't read or write? 
</P>
<P>
The African-Americans are simply taking up where the Irish-Americans, 
German-Americans, Jewish-Americans, Italian-Americans and the home-grown farm 
boys left off. Like their predecessors, they come from a long line of people 
who worked long, hot hours in the sun, growing grapes, chopping cotton, cutting 
cane. This makes the belly hard, the muscles sinewy, the will stubborn but 
accustomed to hardship. This is the edge the black athlete has. The same edge 
the boys from the cornfield, the boys who came from a long line of Bavarian 
stump-clearers, had in another era. 
</P>
<P>
And what happened to them may happen to the American black. Already, as blacks 
migrate from the levees and cotton fields of the Old South and get more than 
one generation away from it to the metropolises of the North and East and live 
their lives by radiators and soft beds and eat junk food instead of soul food, 
they are losing their places, increasingly, to the hardy breeds from Central 
America and the Caribbean. That's the way it goes. 
</P>
<P>
Don't ask me to explain any of this. Trust me. I'm fresh out of test tubes. 
Don't burden me with facts. Or twitch muscles. As Harry Edwards and I could 
tell you, Irishmen don't have twitch muscles.

REMEMBERING THE DAY LOU GEHRIG SAT DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM DONAGHY, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On June 2, 1925, Wally Pipp had a headache and was replaced at first base in 
the New York Yankee lineup by a quiet hometown kid named Lou Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
It took 14 years, 2,130 games and an incurable illness to put Gehrig back on 
the bench. 
</P>
<P>
And when the Iron Horse took himself out of the lineup 50 years ago, on May 2, 
1939, he also moved out of the shadow of Babe Ruth and into baseball 
immortality. 
</P>
<P>
The shy son of German immigrants living on New York's East Side never captured 
the imagination of the public the way the flamboyant Ruth did, but when his 
remarkable consecutive-game streak ended he took with him numbers comparable to 
anyone who ever played the game: 
</P>
<P>
 -- 493 lifetime homers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1,990 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A .632 slugging percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A major-league record 23 grand slams. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Four home runs in a game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 1927, he hit .373 with 47 home runs and 175 runs batted in. He also had 
52 doubles, 18 triples, walked 109 times and scored 149 runs. Yet it was a 
season lost to Ruth's 60 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the 13 full seasons he played, Gehrig averaged 147 RBIs a season. Henry 
Aaron, Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle never drove in that many runs in a seeason 
even once. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In four seasons during the peak of his career he averaged only 37 
strikeouts a year. Reggie Jackson averaged 129 strikeouts a season for his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
But it is his 2,130 consecutive games played that is considered one of 
baseball's unbreakable records. The next best is the mark Gehrig broke -- 1,307 
straight games by Everett Scott, 823 games (more than five seasons) short of 
Gehrig's mark. 
</P>
<P>
If a rookie was to start a consecutive-game streak in 1989, he would have to 
play every game from now until early in the season of 2,002 to surpass Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1939, no one has even come close. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Garvey holds the National League record with 1,207 consecutive games from 
Sept. 3, 1975, to July 29, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Garvey retired after the 1987 season, but if he had kept the streak going in 
1983 and was playing today, he would still be a few games short. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone will ever break Lou Gehrig's record," Garvey said. "I 
know I played with a lot of nagging injuries to keep the streak alive and I 
didn't even get close." 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore shortstop Cal Ripken recently surpassed playing in 1,100 consecutive 
games. He would still need another six-plus seasons to reach Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not really something I'm thinking about," Ripken said. "I can't even 
imagine reaching that point. Hey, I'm surprised I've gotten this far. 
</P>
<P>
"I just play one game at a time." 
</P>
<P>
A star at Columbia University, Gehrig was scouted by Paul Krichell and signed 
with the Yankees when offered a $1,500 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
After two short stints with New York in 1923 and 1924, Gehrig started his 
streak on that June day in 1925 when Pipp, who had been the Yankees' first 
baseman since 1915, told Manager Miller Huggins he had a headache and asked to 
take the day off. 
</P>
<P>
Gehrig took over at first base, and stayed there for 15 years. He stayed 
through muscle pulls, broken bones, and yes, even a slump or two. 
</P>
<P>
Gehrig turned 35 in 1938 and his average slipped to .295 with 29 homers and 114 
RBIs. While million-dollar numbers by today's standards, it was far below his 
norm and provoked concern for Gehrig and the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Gehrig, whose top salary was $39,000, had a sluggish spring training in 1939 
and a routine play at Yankee Stadium in April told him something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
A ball was hit back to pitcher Johnny Murphy and Gehrig had trouble getting to 
the bag. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy told the Iron Horse, "nice play," but Gehrig knew it was nothing 
special. 
</P>
<P>
In his first 28 at-bats in 1939, Gehrig had four hits with no homers and one 
RBI. 
</P>
<P>
Gehrig knew something was wrong, he just didn't know what. 
</P>
<P>
May 1, 1939, was an off day and Gehrig spent some lonely hours in a Detroit 
hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Gehrig told Manager Joe McCarthy: "I'm taking myself out of the 
lineup." 
</P>
<P>
"I decided last Sunday night on this move," Gehrig said in announcing his 
decision to the press. "I haven't been a bit of good to the team since the 
season started. It would not be fair to the boys, to Joe or to the baseball 
public for me to try going on. In fact, it would not be fair to myself." 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy thought Gehrig just needed some much deserved time off and would be 
back soon. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him it would be as he wished," McCarthy said at the time. "Like 
everybody else I'm sorry to see it happen. I told him not to worry. Maybe the 
warm weather will bring him around." 
</P>
<P>
But the weather had nothing to do with Gehrig's problems. 
</P>
<P>
He visited the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, and it was discovered he had an 
incurable disease. He was diagnosed as having Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. 
But the world has come to know it as Lou Gehrig's disease.

HOUSTON EXONERATED AFTER GOING TO TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LOUISVILLE, Ky. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Surrounded by a roomful of reporters, trainer Wayne Lukas watched on television 
Saturday as Houston, his maligned 3-year-old colt, recovered from the Santa 
Anita Derby disaster to win the one-mile Kentucky Derby Trial by five lengths 
at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
Before the race, Lukas said he wasn't superstitious, but, still, he sat in the 
same swivel chair in the track superintendent's office where he watched Winning 
Colors last year as the filly gave him his first Kentucky Derby win. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, the Trial was little more than a glorified workout for Houston, a 
colt that cost Lukas $2.9 million as a yearling and then won his first three 
races before beating only one horse as the heavy favorite in the Santa Anita 
Derby three weeks ago. Houston defeated five horses of lesser skill in a good 
time of 1:36 1/5 over a drying-out track that was called muddy most of the day 
but was listed as good for the Trial. 
</P>
<P>
Houston ran the last quarter-mile in :26 1/5 and did nothing in the stretch to 
suggest that he will be a serious threat in next Saturday's 1 1/4-mile Kentucky 
Derby. Nevertheless, Houston should be the fourth betting choice, behind the 
entry of Easy Goer and Awe Inspiring, Santa Anita Derby winner Sunday Silence 
and Western Playboy. 
</P>
<P>
Belek, who had been undefeated in three starts, finished second, seven lengths 
ahead of Affirmed's Image. In His Cups ran fourth, Pulverizing was fifth after 
leading for a half-mile in a speedy time of :44 4/5 and One That Got Away 
finished last. 
</P>
<P>
Houston, earning $54,502 of the $83,850 purse, paid $3, $2.40 and $2.40. Belek 
paid $2.60 and $2.60, and Affirmed's Image paid $3.40. The temperature was 
about 75 degrees, but the humidity reminded Lukas of the Santa Anita Derby, in 
which Houston wilted in the heat. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Lukas nor jockey Laffit Pincay did flip-flops over Houston's race. 
Houston went to the track calmly before an opening-day crowd of 24,281. The 
well-bred son of Seattle Slew and Smart Angle broke well and settled into 
second place, a couple lengths behind Pulverizing, as the field left the chute 
for the run down the backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
Houston ranged up on the outside to take the lead away from Pulverizing on the 
turn and won easily. Pincay did not need to use the whip. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be the best work on the tab," Lukas kiddingly said. "I would have 
preferred that he run it a little slower, but it's better for a horse to run 
fluidly than have him go slower. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Laffit to get him off the fence coming through the stretch and he did. 
The track was a little sticky on the inside. This race was more of a challenge 
than the other horses he beat. It gives him a race over the (Derby) track, 
we've got the horse back (from the Santa Anita defeat) and if he bounced back 
from this, then we'll move on to the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether he wins the Derby or not, this is a good horse and he'll have a good 
career. It's a lot of fun to speculate on who is doing what, but the Derby 
isn't a mythical championship, it's a dogfight on the race track." 
</P>
<P>
Bob French, Lukas' long-time partner from Midland, Tex., who bought a 
controlling interest in Houston after the trainer got him at a Keeneland 
auction, was relieved that the colt won. 
</P>
<P>
"The Santa Anita Derby knocked the wind out of us," French said. "This was very 
nice, it was exactly what we wanted. What happened at Santa Anita really got to 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Five of the winners of the Trial came back to win the Derby, but none since Tim 
Tam in 1958, when the race was only seven furlongs. Since 1982, when the Trial 
was moved from four days before the Derby to a week ahead, no horse has come 
out of the race to win the Derby. "I just sat with my horse most of the way," 
Pincay said. "We were just waiting. I wasn't worried about the speed horse 
(Pulverizing), I wasn't worried about him at all. I'm satisfied with this 
race." 
</P>
<P>
A couple of weeks ago, the 115th Derby figured to have one of the smaller 
fields in recent years, but now there's going to be the usual mob. A field of 
15 is definite, and if Flying Continental comes from California, there could be 
16. Jack Robbins, one of owner Jack Kent Cooke's advisers, said that there's a 
60-40 chance that Flying Continental will run. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Easy Goer, Awe Inspiring, Sunday Silence, Western Playboy and Houston, 
the field should include Dansil, Triple Buck, Faultless Ensign, Hawkster, 
Clever Trevor, Notation, Majesty's Imp, Irish Actor, Northern Wolf and Wind 
Splitter. 
</P>
<P>
Majesty's Imp joined the group Saturday, even though he finished fifth last 
Tuesday in the Lexington Stakes at Keeneland. His principal owner, Chuck 
Tanner, managed the Pittsburgh Pirates to a World Series victory, but he is new 
to the horse racing business and has never been to the Derby. He can get a 
better seat with a horse in the race. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer worked quickly Saturday morning, running five furlongs in :59. 
Although the track was muddy, trainer Shug McGaughey said that it was easier 
for Easy Goer to grip than it was when he ran second in the Breeders' Cup 
Juvenile at Churchill Downs last November. . . . Sunday Silence worked a mile 
in 1:39 3/5 and trainer Charlie Whittingham said: "The track was a little 
tiring and he probably had 125 pounds (exercise rider Steve Bass and a heavy 
saddle), but he came out of it and wasn't even blowing." . . . Hawkster worked 
a mile in 1:41 1/5 with Marco Castaneda, who will be his rider in the Derby, in 
the saddle for the first time. . . . Dansil's owner, John Franks, is 
considering a jockey change for the Derby, even though Larry Snyder rode the 
colt to victory in the Arkansas Derby.

<P>
Michael Spindler, running the anchor 1,600-meter leg, led Cal Poly Pomona to 
victory in the college division distance medley relay Saturday at the 80th 
Drake Relays in Des Moines, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
It was Cal Poly's second relay title of the meet. The Broncos won the 
3,200-meter relay Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Spindler, who led throughout his leg, held off Emporia State's David Kipelio in 
the final 50 meters as Cal Poly won in 9:57.48. 
</P>
<P>
Stephane Franke led off for Cal Poly on the 1,200-meter leg and was followed by 
Dario Robinson in the 400 and Marc Spina in the 800. 
</P>
<P>
Franke, Spina and Spindler also ran on the winning 3,200 team, joining TeFere 
Gebre. 
</P>
<P>
Olympic gold medalist Paul Ereng, a Virginia sophomore from Kenya, won the 800 
meters going away in 1:47.0, well short of the meet record of 1:45.86, but 
Ereng said he was satisfied considering the 50-degree weather. 
</P>
<P>
"The weather bothered me a lot, but just at the start of our race it became 
sunny for about three minutes and I think that was good for me," Ereng said. "I 
like to run when it's about 75 degrees." 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Arizona outran crowd favorite Iowa State to win the 
university division distance medley in 9:37.39. John Quade caught and passed 
Iowa State's John Nuttall on the anchor leg. 
</P>
<P>
In the university-college 100-meters, Texas A&amp;M's Andre Cason zipped to a 
meet record 10.1, which was hand-timed. 
</P>
<P>
That's the fastest ever at the Drake Relays, although meet statistician Mike 
Henderson decided to leave Calvin Smith's 10.11 in the record books as the best 
automatic time. The event was hand-timed because of a malfunction in the 
automatic timing device. 
</P>
<P>
LSU's Tananjalyn Stanley set a meet record of 13.05 in the women's 100-meters 
hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas won its second relay title at the 95th Penn Relays in Philadelphia, 
taking the 6,000-meter relay. The Razorbacks won the distance medley Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Falcon, who ran the anchor lap in the distance medley, also anchored the 
6,000 team, which was timed in 15:16.26. 
</P>
<P>
Texas finished second in the 6,000, while the Longhorn women, directed by U.S. 
Olympic Coach Terry Crawford, became the first women's team to win four relays 
in one weekend, taking the 400, 800, 1,600 and sprint medley. 
</P>
<P>
Mount St. Mary's, which lost to Arkansas in the distance medley, came back to 
win the sprint medley in 3:18.04. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Peter Rono, Olympic 1,500-meter champion, ran the 800 anchor for Mount 
St. Mary's.

A SECOND CHANCE WITH ONCE-IN-LIFETIME HORSE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For a boy raised in the bosom of horse country, in by-God Lexington, Ky., Shug 
McGaughey sure took his time reaching the conclusion that the race track was a 
lifeblood running through his veins. From the day he came to understand this, 
though, a couple years shy of his 20th birthday, he was imbued with a raging 
ambition. He wanted to be a trainer, and he wanted to be one of the best. 
</P>
<P>
He still is a boy in the game, not even 40, young enough to be Woody Stephens' 
grandson. But, his dreams already have crystallized from the fiction of his 
imagination to warm, wonderful truths. As he stood in the dusty, cluttered 
office of Ogden Phipps' stable at Belmont Park early the other morning, a cup 
of coffee and the world in his hands, he allowed a smile to escape. "This does 
exceed what I ever thought about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He is a small man, 5 1/2-feet tall, with a round, red face that makes you 
smile, a gentle toss of gray and brown hair, eyes tinted gray and blue. He has 
a pleasant, little belly that pushes forward, and he speaks with a thick 
Kentucky accent that evokes the slow drip of molasses and the laziness of pole 
fishing. He looks you in the eye. He trained horses that won more than $7 
million in purses last year. 
</P>
<P>
Phipps, one of the last pillars of old-guard racing still standing, picked him 
to train his private stable in 1985. There may not be a better job in the 
business, but McGaughey has taken it to a higher plane. He guided the career of 
Personal Ensign, the filly who became the first horse in 80 years to retire 
undefeated. Now, he has Easy Goer, who, next weekend at Churchill Downs, will 
be the first prohibitive favorite at the Kentucky Derby in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
McGaughey understands that there is poetry in his returning to Louisville with 
a Derby favorite, a prodigal son coming home. Louisville is the city where he 
cut his teeth as a trainer, Churchill the track he used as a base in the 
mid-1980s while operating a public stable that grew and grew and grew -- as 
many as 80 horses -- as word spread about the little trainer who had a knack. 
</P>
<P>
"Churchill and Keeneland (in Lexington) will always be special to me," said 
McGaughey, who has lived outside Manhattan with his wife and young son since 
Phipps hired him. "Coming back with the Derby favorite is something I have 
dreamed about all my life." 
</P>
<P>
He attended his first Derby 22 years ago, at 16. "Proud Clarion beat Damascus," 
he said, and if that makes him sound like a historian, don't be fooled. The son 
of a real estate agent, he knew little about racing as a youngster other than 
what he gleaned from occasional trips to Keeneland with his father. He played 
high school golf -- as low as a 3-handicap -- and went off to Ole Miss. 
</P>
<P>
Much to the surprise of everyone, he dropped out after two years to work for a 
trainer at Keeneland. The lure of the racetrack had snagged him. He found he 
enjoyed being around the barn, working with horses. He started out walking hots 
and mucking stalls. Within a few years, he was working for David Whitely in New 
York. Across the road at Belmont was Phipps' barn. 
</P>
<P>
He looked across the road and dreamed of being in charge. "It was the only job 
I wanted," he said. "Jimmy Johnson probably dreamed about coaching the Dallas 
Cowboys. This was always where I wanted to go." 
</P>
<P>
He got his trainer's license in 1979 and began building his public stable, a 
wild confluence of owners and horses. Sometimes he had horses running at four 
tracks. "I'd work all day at Churchill, go to the airport, get on a plane, get 
somewhere at 10 or 11 at night, no time for dinner," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It took five years for him to begin to see real results. He had the 
second-place horse in the 1984 Belmont, Pine Circle. The next year he had 
Vanlandingham, who won the International and Jockey Club Gold Cup. On the 
afternoon he was preparing Vanlandingham for the Woodward in 1985, he was 
struck with a moment of clarity. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd walked that horse in the barn until I didn't have any soles left," he 
said. "I was nervous. I used to get so nervous that it wasn't any fun. I got to 
the paddock and was putting on the girth, and I found myself asking, 'Is all 
this worth it?' I looked around and saw (the trappings of a big race) and 
decided, yeah, it was. That day, it hit me that it was a lot more fun to be 
playing in the eighth (feature) race than the first race." 
</P>
<P>
The Phipps telephoned that fall, ensuring that he would be in the eighth race 
for years. He had been recommended by Seth Hancock, president of Claiborne 
Farm, where Phipps' mares stand. Hancock had been watching McGaughey's ascent 
and recognized an astute, prudent horseman. "Shug is knowledgeable about horses 
in a way that's kind of magic," John Ed Anthony, one of the owners for whom 
McGaughey used to train, told Sports Illustrated magazine. 
</P>
<P>
That he has arrived seems above doubt. He won the Eclipse Award as the nation's 
top trainer in 1988 and has heard his name lumped with those of Lukas, Stephens 
and Whittingham. His response is to lateral the credit. "You hope for one 
once-in-a-lifetime horse," he said. "Personal Ensign was one. Now, Easy Goer 
is. I'm in awe of Easy Goer. I don't know how he wound up in my barn, but he 
did." 
</P>
<P>
His Kentucky blood bubbles when he discusses what it would mean for Easy Goer 
to win. "No matter what happens the rest of my life," he said, "it won't be 
complete" without a Derby victory. Even if he doesn't win, though, the Phipps' 
stable of 2-year-olds is "the best I have ever seen," he said. He will be back, 
assuredly. The little trainer is one of the big boys now. Was it all worth it? 
Must we ask?

MAKING THE PROFIT TURN MIGHT BE EASY GOING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BEYER, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Easy Goer delivered an exceptional performance to win the Wood Memorial Stakes 
Saturday, but something even rarer than the emergence of a superhorse occurred 
in the race at Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
The Wood offered bettors at the track a genuine sure thing -- an opportunity to 
make a profit regardless of the outcome. No quirky result or act of God could 
have thwarted the bet. The rate of return wouldn't have been huge. But inasmuch 
as U.S. Treasury bonds yield interest of 9 percent a year, a guaranteed return 
of 2 or 3 percent in two minutes isn't bad. 
</P>
<P>
Making the proper wager to get this profit isn't easy; it requires quick 
thinking and a little flair for math. But Maryland racing fans might spend some 
time practicing with a hand-held calculator, because the opportunity that was 
present in the Wood could arise in the Preakness, if Easy Goer wins the 
Kentucky Derby in a romp and comes to Baltimore looking like the unbeatable 
favorite in a small field. 
</P>
<P>
Take out your notebooks, class, and pay careful attention. 
</P>
<P>
This special situation arises when a seemingly unbeatable horse is entered in a 
small field (ideally, a field of five or six) where show wagering is permitted 
and many plungers are making big bets on the supposed "sure thing." It seemed 
inconceivable that Easy Goer could finish out of the money against his five 
rivals in the Wood. Since tracks must pay a minimum of $2.10 for $2, a plunger 
could put up $20,000 to make a quick $1,000 profit. And plenty of them did. A 
total of $866,533 was bet to show on Easy Goer. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble with this approach is that strange things can happen in horse 
racing -- jockeys fall off, favorites get disqualified, horses break down. 
That's why peope who make these big show bets have long been known as "bridge 
jumpers." A show-bet plunger has to be right 19 times out of 20 just to break 
even; in the long run this is not a good way to play the horses. 
</P>
<P>
On the rare occasions when one of these big favorites finishes out of the 
money, the show payoffs on the one-two-three finishers will be exceptionally 
large. When a horse is bet as heavily as Easy Goer was Saturday, and the 
potential payoffs on the other horses are astronomical, it is possible to make 
a large bet on the favorite and small saver bets on everybody else that will 
yield a profit no matter what happens. To do this, it is necessary to know how 
to calculate show payoffs. It's not too difficult. 
</P>
<P>
1. Take the total amount of money in the entire show pool. 
</P>
<P>
2. Subtract the percentage that the state and track get from each wager -- 17 
percent in both New York and Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
3. Subtract from the result the total wagered on the first three finishers. 
This leaves the money that will be distributed as profits to winning bettors. 
</P>
<P>
4. Divide this figure by three. This leaves the amount that will be distributed 
to bettors on each of the first three finishers. 
</P>
<P>
5. To find the odds that an individual horse will return, divide the amount 
wagered on him into the figure from Step 4. 
</P>
<P>
In the Wood Memorial, these were the amounts bet to show (rounded to the 
nearest $100): 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer, $866,500. 
</P>
<P>
Triple Buck, $6,800. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond Donnie, $6,400. 
</P>
<P>
A.M. Swinger, $6,200. 
</P>
<P>
Rock Point, $4,700. 
</P>
<P>
Militron, $3,500. 
</P>
<P>
Total pool, $894,100. 
</P>
<P>
If Easy Goer finishes in the money, everybody pays the minimum of $2.10. But if 
Triple Buck, Diamond Donnie and A.M. Swinger run one-two-three, what does 
Triple Buck pay to show? 
</P>
<P>
1. The total money in the pool is $894,100. 
</P>
<P>
2. Take 17 percent out of the pool and $742,103 is left to be distributed to 
winning bettors. Round it off to $742,100 for simplicity's sake. 
</P>
<P>
3. Subtract the $19,400 bet on the first three finishers to get the figure 
$722,700. 
</P>
<P>
4. Divide $722,700 by 3. That is $240,900, which will go to bettors who had 
their money on Triple Buck. 
</P>
<P>
5. Divide the $6,800 on Triple Buck into $240,900. The resultant figure of 35.4 
means that Triple Buck odds to show would be 35.4 to 1. For a $2 bet, he would 
pay $72.80 to show (since the original $2 wager is always added to the odds). 
</P>
<P>
This 35.4-to-1 return on Triple Buck would be the smallest of all the show 
payoffs, because he was the second choice in the wagering pool. But let's 
suppose, for simplicty's sake, that all of the payoffs would be 35.4 to 1 if 
Easy Goer ran out of the money. 
</P>
<P>
We ar planning to make a big show bet on Easy Goer, but want to take insurance 
by putting $20 to show on each of the five other horses -- a total of $100 for 
the insurance bet. If Easy Goer ran out of the money, we would collect $728 
(the result of a $20 bet at 35 to 1 three times) for a total return of $2,184. 
That's a profit of $2,084. 
</P>
<P>
This means we could bet $2,084 to show on Easy Goer and protect the wager by 
putting $20 on each of the others. But by wagering a bit less than $2,084, we 
can assure a profit regardless of the outcome. So we bet $2,000 to show on Easy 
Goer, $20 to show on everybody else -- a $2,100 investment. 
</P>
<P>
If Easy Goer finished out of the money, as we have seen, we would collect at 
least $2,184 -- a return of about 4 percent. But as the race actually turned 
out, we would get back $2,100 on our Easy Goer wager and $21 on both the 
second- and third-place finishers, a return of $2,142, or about 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
By calculating the expected show payoffs on each other horse more precisely -- 
instead of using our 35 to 1 for all of them -- it is possible to squeeze out a 
somewhat larger guaranteed profit. There is only one small risk attached to 
this strategy. A bettor can't wait until the very last instant to make his 
wager. If he goes to the window even a minute before post time, other people's 
wagers could alter some of the payoffs that he anticipated. But with so much 
money already in the pool, as there was in the Wood Memorial, it is unlikely 
that the odds could change too much. 
</P>
<P>
This may not be the glamorous way to play the horses, but it is nice to know 
that on rare occasions this chancy sport may indeed offer opportunities that 
are almost as solid as money in the bank.

MIKE DOWNEY: DOUBTING THE LAKERS IS A BAD BET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Downey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let's see, do the Lakers have their game heads on? Uh, yes, they do. Magic 
Johnson has shaved off his whiskers. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has Naired clean his 
pate. Pat Riley has moussed his tresses. Michael Cooper has tattooed his 
forehead with a 21-stitch Frankenstein zipper. Serious games require serious 
faces. 
</P>
<P>
Yesterday, I even shaved off my own beard. Where Magic leads, others must 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers are out to win championships back to back to back. This time, there 
are no guarantees. No refunds or rebates. No penalties for early withdrawal. 
The Lakers even go into 1989's National Basketball Assn. playoffs as -- gasp -- 
underdogs. The favorites clearly appear to be the Detroit Pistons, the NBA's 
Garbage Pail Kids. 
</P>
<P>
So, maybe you would like to know if I believe the Lakers will repeat. 
</P>
<P>
Uh, no, I don't. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, what do I know? I'm the guy who went into the playoffs thinking 
this would be the year of the Utah Jazz. I'm the guy who figured the Lakers 
would be eliminated by the Salt Lakers. Now, I'm not even sure Utah will 
survive the first round. I suppose Frank Layden will waste away to a waistline 
like Oprah Winfrey's before Utah wins the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
Anyhow, I should know better than to doubt the Lakers. Any night now, Magic 
should be coming up with basketball's first 40-20-20 triple-double. He will 
become the Jose Canseco of baseball. Forty points, 20 rebounds and 20 assists. 
There is only one thing wrong with Earvin Johnson, and that is that there are 
not two of him. 
</P>
<P>
What sort of incentive do the Lakers need to beat the Portland Trail Blazers 
today and to keep on beating them until they are permitted to move along in the 
playoffs to beat somebody else? 
</P>
<P>
Well, there is pride, of course. The pride of being and remaining the best. The 
pride of distinguished achievement. The pride of doing something -- three 
straight titles -- that has not been done by anybody in the NBA since 1966. 
And, not to be forgotten, the pride of being and remaining the principal tenant 
of the Forum. Remember, the hockey team lasted two rounds. 
</P>
<P>
If the Lakers get bumped off in one round, they should be forced to change 
their uniform colors to silver and black. On a classy guy such as, say, James 
Worthy, it would be the next best thing to a tuxedo. This purple-and-gold thing 
is beginning to have a very Sunset Boulevard at midnight look. 
</P>
<P>
Next, there is the win-one-for-Kareem factor for the Lakers. Although frankly, 
I am beginning to think maybe Kareem should win one for them. Anytime your 
associates get together and buy you a Rolls-Royce, the least you can do is give 
them a lift. If the Lakers lead Abdul-Jabbar to the title, as opposed to those 
bygone years when he led them, shouldn't Kareem, at the very least, give each 
of his teammates a Toyota as a parting gift? 
</P>
<P>
I am going to go under the assumption that the Lakers will handle the Trail 
Blazers in the opening round. I am not expecting much in the way of trouble 
from any team that gives Kiki Vanderweghe away for $24 in cash and trinkets, or 
whatever it was Portland got from New York. Never forget, this is the franchise 
that drafted Sam Bowie over Michael Jordan. This is some way to blaze a trail. 
</P>
<P>
Who is there in the Western Conference who can defeat the Lakers? Well, almost 
anybody, I'm afraid. After all, Utah and Dallas both took last year's Lakers to 
seventh games before Detroit did. But there is a big difference between being 
able to beat the Lakers and actually beating them, which the Phoenix Suns 
probably will have a chance to find out. 
</P>
<P>
The good news about this Laker squad is that the five starters all seem to be 
in fine form, although Johnson and Byron Scott have had nagging physical 
problems and the starting center is actually more of a combination of two men, 
Abdul-Jabbar and Mychal Thompson. Better still, Cooper is shooting like his 
1987 self, not his 1988 self, and looks good on a basketball court when he 
isn't walking into walls. 
</P>
<P>
The bad news about this Laker squad is that the two best reserves are no longer 
kids, at 33-plus, and the two other top reserves, Orlando Woolridge and Tony 
Campbell, play defense from the manual of the Denver Nuggets. Woolridge and 
Campbell ought to be forced to stay on the offensive side of the court, like 
Iowa girls' basketball. 
</P>
<P>
The bad thing about next season's Laker squad is that these guys had better 
locate a center somewhere, somehow. David Robinson got away. Mike Gminski got 
away. 
</P>
<P>
A little voice in my ear keeps telling me that Ralph Sampson is eminently 
available, having become a wallflower with the Golden State Warriors, but the 
question is, do we really want Ralph Sampson? This guy may not be the biggest 
bust in the NBA, but he is definitely the tallest. 
</P>
<P>
OK, now the good thing about this season's Laker squad. His name is Pat Riley, 
and in our book he is coach of the year, year after year, and therefore does 
not need be presented one of those chintzy trophies they are always giving to 
Doug Moe or Don Nelson or somebody else who will be receiving no other trophies 
come season's end. 
</P>
<P>
Riley makes (lets) the Lakers play his way, which also happens to be their way. 
We're happy to have him and hoping to keep him. 
</P>
<P>
OK, on with the playoffs. Everybody go take a shave. This year, the Lakers 
might really be cutting it close.

San Diego Manager Jack McKeon said the only thing he liked about Saturday 
night's game at Chicago's Wrigley Field was the final score. 
</P>
<P>
It read: San Diego Padres 5, Chicago Cubs 4. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight? Eleven errors: Padres six, Cubs five. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't proud of that, but who cares when you win," McKeon said. "No, I've 
never seen that many errors in a game, even in the minor leagues." 
</P>
<P>
Bullpen ace Mark Davis stopped a seventh-inning rally to earn his 11th save in 
11 opportunities, but he needed a two-run homer in the eighth inning by John 
Kruk. 
</P>
<P>
Davis gave up solo home runs to Mark Grace in the eighth inning and to Curtis 
Wilkerson in the ninth. "It was the worst game I've ever seen," said Cub 
Manager Don Zimmer. The tough part of it is they capitalized on our errors and 
we didn't (on San Diego's). In one inning they made two errors and we didn't 
get a thing." 
</P>
<P>
The six errors tied a San Diego club record accomplished four times, the last 
coming July 31, 1977, against the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the Cubs committed five errors in a game was April 28, 1986, 
against San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The two-team major league record for errors in a game is 15 set by the Cubs and 
Boston in 1904. Boston had 10 errors in that game. 
</P>
<P>
The second basemen had most of the problems. Roberto Alomar made three of the 
Padre errors and Ryne Sandberg, a six-time gold glove winner, made two for the 
Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
"The field was terrible," Sandberg said. "They didn't water it all they. I 
don't know. Maybe they expected rain. You could see by the infielders' 
reactions that the ball was eating them up." 
</P>
<P>
Winning pitcher Walt Terrell (3-2) left in the seventh inning after the Cubs 
had scored a run on Alomar's third error of the game and successive singles by 
Phil Stephenson and Wilkerson. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 8, Cincinnati 0 -- Chris James hit a grand slam and Mike Maddux 
allowed just two hits as the Phillies beat Danny Jackson at Cincinnati in a 
game halted by rain in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
The start of the game was delayed 2 1/2 hours by rain. It was stopped in the 
bottom of the fifth after another delay of 1:32. 
</P>
<P>
Maddux (1-0) struck out four and walked one in his first start of the season. 
Jackson (1-5), who lost his fifth consecutive decision, was 4-0 with a 1.35 
earned-run average against the Phillies last season. 
</P>
<P>
James' second career grand slam came during a six-run fourth inning. Steve Lake 
drew a leadoff walk and, one out later, Jackson fielded a bunt by Maddux but 
threw late to second base for a force play. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Schmidt had two runs batted in to give him a career total of 1,585, moving 
him past Al Kaline and Harmon Killebrew into 17th place on the all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 9, Atlanta 7 -- Tim Raines singled twice and hit two sacrifice flies 
to drive in four runs at Montreal as the Expos dealt the Braves their fifth 
consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
Raines, who tied his career-high for RBIs in a game, has driven in 10 runs in 
his last three games and has 17 RBIs. He has driven in 15 runs in 14 at-bats 
with runners in scoring position. He's batting .428 in that situation. 
</P>
<P>
The Expos overcame a 6-5 deficit by scoring four runs in the seventh inning. 
Hubie Brooks drew a leadoff walk from Charlie Puleo and Tim Wallach singled off 
reliever Jim Acker. Damaso Garcia's run-scoring single tied the score, 
pinch-hitter Wallace Johnson had an RBI single and reliever Paul Assenmacher 
walked Spike Owen, loading the bases. Nelson Santovenia singled home a run and 
Raines hit a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 4, Pittsburgh 3 -- Kevin Mitchell and Terry Kennedy hit solo home 
runs in the ninth inning to give the Giants the win at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates scored in the eighth for a 3-2 lead before the Giants rallied. 
Mitchell hit reliever Jeff Robinson's first pitch of the ninth for his sixth 
home run and Kennedy connected with two outs for his second homer. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the game, the Giants had been held scoreless in 25 of their last 27 
innings. They left 14 runners on base Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants scored in the first when Butler walked with the bases loaded, ending 
a streak of 17 innings without a run. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Krukow pitched five innings in his first start of the season for the 
Giants. He had been on the disabled list with tendinitis in his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
New York 5, Houston 1 -- Ron Darling won his first game of the season with a 
two-hitter over seven innings and Howard Johnson had four hits, including his 
fourth homer, as the Mets extended their winning streak to six games. 
</P>
<P>
Darling got help from Don Aase and Randy Myers as they combined on a 
four-hitter at Houston. Myers pitched the final 1 1/3 innings for his fifth 
save. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets took a 2-1 lead on consecutive singles by Johnson, Keith Hernandez and 
Darryl Strawberry.

LONNIE SMITH'S CAREER AND SPIRIT ARE REBORN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAIRE SMITH, The Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lonnie Smith reluctantly sat down in front of his locker and lit a cigarette 
and then, moments later, another. It was the only sign of nervousness found in 
a man who very much understands his lot in life. 
</P>
<P>
Lonnie Smith, dragged down in the early 1980s by a drug scandal, is enjoying a 
rebirth of spirit as well as career. 
</P>
<P>
Flourishing as the left fielder for the Atlanta Braves, Smith is the improbable 
early candidate for comeback player of the year. He knows he is a good story, a 
poignant story, not because of where he is and what he is, but because of where 
he had been and what he had become. 
</P>
<P>
"When I talk to youngsters, now, I bring up the fact that during those days I 
wasn't considered human and I didn't consider myself human," Smith said. 
"Because I did a lot of unnatural things, in my way of thinking and acting. And 
when I went into rehab, I went in to not only clean up my life, but to learn 
how to be a human being." 
</P>
<P>
Unnatural? 
</P>
<P>
One night in Philadelphia in 1983, Smith, then a St. Louis Cardinal, stood in 
left field at Veterans Stadium and invited the obligingly hostile Phillies fans 
to throw any object they chose at him in an eerie "hit me if you can" dare. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred because Smith had been teased by the Phillies' mascot and 
he had so viciously tackled the Phanatic between innings the mascot, David 
Raymond, sprained both ankles. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was a favorite target in Philly to begin with. His career started 
bizarrely there years before. He was the athlete gifted with speed but cursed 
with an inexplicable inability to stay on his feet. He was derisively nicknamed 
"Skates" because of his constant slipping on the basepaths and in the outfield. 
That night, the Phanatic was mimicking Smith when the mascot was blind-sided by 
the player. 
</P>
<P>
When Smith took the field again, beer bottles and cans rained around him in 
left field, so many that Smith considers it a miracle he was not hit. The 
umpires suggested to St. Louis Manager Whitey Herzog that he remove Smith from 
the game for Smith's own protection. 
</P>
<P>
It was obvious something was very wrong. "The thing I did on Dave Raymond could 
have actually broken his ankle or kneecap," Smith says now. "As it turned out, 
he was pretty hurt. Fortunately, he wasn't seriously hurt." 
</P>
<P>
But Smith was hurting, seriously. He was living in a cocaine and marijuana 
haze. To this day, he does not even know if he was high or not that night. He 
does know he scared himself enough to take action. Shortly after that incident, 
Smith -- a marijuana user since 1974, a cocaine user since 1977, not to mention 
other drugs -- voluntarily checked into a drug rehabilitation center. 
</P>
<P>
He has been in different forms of rehabilitation ever since, some voluntary, 
some not (the baseball commissioner's edict on drug users cost Smith 10 percent 
of his salary in 1986 and he was ordered to donate 200 hours to community 
service. That indictment still embitters Smith; he refers to Peter Ueberroth's 
punishment as his "sentence.") 
</P>
<P>
But Smith also knows he could be dead from a drug overdose. "I think back on 
some of those things and wonder how in the heck I could do things like that," 
he said. "But that's how far gone I was. That's how much control the drug had 
over me." 
</P>
<P>
It was Smith's responsibility to change his lifestyle. It was his obsession to 
save his career. 
</P>
<P>
He was not Keith Hernandez or Dave Parker. His talents did not make it 
mandatory that the game make room for him. When his "sentence" was handed down, 
he was a Kansas City Royal. When he spoke out against the commissioner, the 
Royals were angered. 
</P>
<P>
"The press is always bringing it up because it's a good-interest story, but I 
don't mind talking about it," he said. "But they (the Royals) didn't 
understand. I used it as a way of therapy." 
</P>
<P>
By the winter of 1986, the Royals decided they could live with Smith, only if 
the player-turned free agent agreed to a full-time role as designated hitter 
and outfielder and accepted a salary cut. Smith refused and found himself out 
of Kansas City and in free-agent limbo, caused by the now-proven collusion by 
the owners. 
</P>
<P>
When Kansas City was allowed to re-sign him May 1, 1987, Smith came back 
admittedly out of shape. That physical state and the deteriorating relationship 
with the Royals started a skid to the minors. 
</P>
<P>
That December, the Royals, citing bad attitude and deteriorating skills, 
released him. By the following March, no team would even listen to Smith's 
agent. "I started calling around myself," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Only two people listened -- Atlanta General Manager Bobby Cox and Hank Aaron, 
the Braves' vice president in charge of player development. They were 
interested, but there was a catch. He had to go to Richmond, the minor leagues. 
He had to go to winter baseball in Puerto Rico. He had to fight all the way 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, then 32, could have easily walked away. But, he said, "I was in a 
position where I had no choice. I wanted to continue playing. I was willing to 
try anything." 
</P>
<P>
Smith proceeded to hit .300 in Richmond last season. This past winter, his .366 
average won him an MVP of the Puerto Rican League. He now plays every day for 
the Braves in left field. 
</P>
<P>
Smith may seem to fly in the face of the Braves' youth movement but, says 
Manager Russ Nixon, the Braves' farm system had turned out a host of 
youngsters, but mostly pitchers. It did not produce a young leadoff hitter. It 
did produce Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed him," Nixon said. "And he needed us. It's worked out great."

QUICK-FIXES PUT THE AL EAST IN QUITE A FIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HENNEMAN, The Baltimore Evening Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In case you haven't been paying attention to anything other than the Orioles' 
captivating play of late, the American League's Eastern Division has already 
received a stern message. 
</P>
<P>
And it has nothing to do with the local team's surprising appearance in first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Remember when they used to refer to the divisions as the American League East 
and the American League Least (or Worst)? Well, that has been gradually 
changing over the last five seasons and it's now official: The joke has moved 
to the other coast. 
</P>
<P>
It has been more than a decade (1977) since the American League West posted a 
winning record against the American League East, but that is about to change 
and it could get ugly. 
</P>
<P>
There were times when the fourth- and fifth-place teams on the east side of the 
country had records good enough to challenge, if not beat, the best in the 
west. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, in 1976 the Orioles won 88 games and finished 10 1/2 games out; 
two years later they won 90 and were nine games back. As recently as 1984, when 
they started to slide, the Orioles managed 85 wins (fifth place, 19 games out), 
and the next year they won 83 (fourth, 16 games behind). 
</P>
<P>
Now, we at least have an idea that a major reason the Orioles crashed so 
rapidly was the steady improvement of the teams in the West. The Orioles just 
got the message before the rest of their division. 
</P>
<P>
Barely 10 percent of the 1989 season has been played and already the Western 
Division teams are 14 games over .500 against teams from the East. Chances are 
strong this isn't a fluke. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Minnesota won 91 games, more than any team in the East, and finished 
13 games behind Oakland. Remember we're talking about a "balanced" schedule 
here, where a team plays four more games per year against the "other" division. 
</P>
<P>
There was only a five-game difference between the two divisions in 1988, the 
closest the two have been in 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1981, every team in the American League East except Cleveland has won a 
title, with Boston the only team to do it twice. 
</P>
<P>
The American League East produced pennant winners in nine of 10 years (1975-84) 
and was classified as the dominant division in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
However, halfway through the decade, parity replaced power in the East. 
Meanwhile, Kansas City, Minnesota and Oakland were developing in the West. 
</P>
<P>
In the last four seasons, only the 1986 Red Sox have given the East an American 
League champion. Boston won the division again last year (89 wins), but the 3 
1/2 games that separated the first- and fifth-place teams showed that 
mediocrity had taken over. 
</P>
<P>
So, what happened to the mighty American League East? It's called what goes 
around, comes around. The American League West is showing its first signs of 
muscle since the age of free agency. 
</P>
<P>
And that is probably another message for the American League East, where 
power-parity-mediocrity has every team looking for the quick fix. 
</P>
<P>
The easiest way to explain the rise of the West -- specifically the Royals, 
Twins and A's, and more recently the Texas Rangers and California Angels -- is 
the number of high draft choices they have accumulated over the lean years. 
</P>
<P>
But, a bigger reason is the retention of those draft choices. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the American League East "pretenders" have relied to a great 
extent on free agent help, giving up amateur draft choices that provide 
organizational continuity and long-range stability. 
</P>
<P>
A late first-round pick is better than none at all. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles, perhaps more than any other team, have been on both sides of that 
dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, because they lost pitchers Ross Grimsley and Dick Drago and outfielder 
Elliott Maddox to free agency, they picked up three extra draft choices to 
stock a farm system that was just starting to show signs of decay. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, only one year after winning the World Series and coming off an 85-win 
season, the Orioles made what appeared to be a logical short-term move and 
signed free agents Fred Lynn, Don Aase and Lee Lacy. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, they lost their first three draft choices in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
That proved to be devastating, because they had already surrendered a No. 1 in 
1984 (for Tom Underwood) and their first two picks in 1981 (for Jim Dwyer and 
Jose Morales). 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees haven't had a significant draft since Jimmy Carter was president. 
Not coincidentally, they haven't won a division title since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
It's no accident that the two teams with the most talent in the American League 
East, Toronto and Boston, have stayed within the system. 
</P>
<P>
So has Cleveland, but the Indians were dormant for so long that the process has 
seemed eternal. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee bottomed out in much the same fashion as the Orioles, with a solid 
team that took the natural course and phased itself out. Detroit appears only a 
heartbeat away from following that same pattern. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers have made a relatively painless recovery, and much faster than the 
Orioles, by staying within the organization. 
</P>
<P>
It will remain to be seen how the Tigers react to their seemingly inevitable 
fall, but General Manager Bill Lajoie has already taken notice. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want the same thing to happen to us that happened to the Orioles," 
Lajoie said. 
</P>
<P>
The moral of the story is that the quick fix makes sense only as an occasional 
option. If you don't think so, just ask the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
Or better still, ask the New York Mets, another team whose progress can be 
traced to the minor-league system. Once upon a time, in 1977, the Mets felt 
Maddox could fortify their outfield. 
</P>
<P>
Had they refrained from the urge to patch their outfield, the Mets might have 
drafted an infielder who could have been the glue on a team that still might be 
the best of this generation. 
</P>
<P>
There is no guarantee that the Mets would have had the foresight to select Cal 
Ripken, but he would have been available. 
</P>
<P>
With the Mets' second-round choice, obtained when Maddox took the free agent 
route, the Orioles drafted Larry Sheets and later tabbed Ripken with their own 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott Maddox for Cal Ripken? Think about that one. 
</P>
<P>
That's the kind of message the American League East should be getting from the 
American League West. 
</P>
<P>
The imbalance isn't going to be solved overnight -- and it will take some teams 
a lot longer if they insist on a series of short-term investments. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask the Orioles -- or the Mets.

VOLUNTEERS RESCUE 1,500 TROUT; CONFLICTS MAR HIGH SIERRA OPENER 
</P>

<P>
There was a storm of conflict blowing over the Eastern High Sierra as the trout 
season opened Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The weather was clear and the temperatures balmy for the season, but fishermen 
were at odds with the State Department of Fish and Game on two fronts and the 
Los Angeles City Department of Water and Power on another. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jim Becker of Arcadia caught the region's biggest fish of the day, a 
22-pound 4-ounce German brown, from the north end of Upper Twin Lake near here 
shortly after dawn. 
</P>
<P>
One dispute concerned the emergency rescue by 14 citizen volunteers of more 
than 1,000 trout from a stream overflow ditch that suddenly went dry two days 
before the opener. The other involved "loophole" fishing on the Upper Owens 
River by members of the Mammoth Flyrodders the last two winters when trout 
season was closed. Because they weren't keeping any of their catches, the 
anglers, if challenged by game wardens, could say they were fishing for other 
species that were legal at the time. 
</P>
<P>
The rescue operation was late Thursday afternoon between Rock Creek and the 
smaller Crooked Creek near Tom's Place resort 30 miles north of Bishop. 
</P>
<P>
A 1940s agreement with the DWP assures residents of receiving the first 15 
cubic feet per second of Rock Creek's flow into Lower Rock Creek, but any over 
that is automatically spilled out of a pond into a ditch leading to Crooked 
Creek, which runs into L.A. City-owned Crowley Lake to help provide 
hydroelectric power at the dam. 
</P>
<P>
With heavy spring flows filling the three-quarter-mile-long ditch, trout 
customarily enter about the first 300 feet to spawn. But when a cold snap hit 
the area Wednesday night, the overflow stopped and the fish were trapped, 
"flopping around on the rocks and in little pools of water," one witness said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Mammoth Times, two members of the Flyrodders discovered the 
problem and alerted club president Dick Dahlgren, who rounded up more than a 
dozen members who "herded" most of the fish downstream to Crooked Creek. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper headlined its report: Town Volunteers Rescue 5,000 Trout . . . 
While DWP, DFG Snooze." 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Wong, a DFG fishery biologist based in Bishop, said: "Our warden 
estimated about a thousand. I'd say a thousand to 1,500." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the number, Wong said: "It wasn't anything the DWP did actively. 
Legally, they can't put any more water down there, even if we had contacted 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"It dropped so fast (the fish) couldn't find their way out. That's unusual. It 
was an unfortunate situation that normally doesn't occur this time of year. But 
we're 70% of normal (precipitation) this year." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Wilson, assistant district engineer for the DWP in Bishop, was quoted by 
the Mammoth Times: "We have to let this water flow (into Lower Rock Creek). We 
would have no desire to stop the water going down that ditch." 
</P>
<P>
But Rick Rockel of Bridgeport, a leader of the Mono County Wildlife Council, 
said the DFG shouldn't have been caught by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been here a long time," Rockel said. "The attitude toward wildlife and 
fish in this particular case is way too casual on the part of the DFG and the 
DWP. They've got to be responsible about things like this." 
</P>
<P>
Dalhgren and Rockel also initiated the "loophole" fishing on the Upper Owens 
above Crowley in the winter of 1987-88 after failing to persuade the DFG to 
study opening that stream, the East Walker River and Rush Creek to year-round 
fishing. 
</P>
<P>
With a couple of insignificant exceptions, Dahlgren said, "(Mono) is the only 
county in the western United States that has no year-round fishing," and 
therefore no recreation to offer anglers between October and May. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to Dahlgren and Rockel, after then-Fish and Game Commission 
President Al Taucher of Long Beach encouraged them that such a proposal for a 
study would be accepted, DFG Region 5 chief Fred Worthley asked them to wait so 
they could discuss an arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
Rockel: "Fred Worthley made a deal with us and said if we would back off, he 
would have a biologist work specifically on that and give us an answer by last 
June. It never happened." 
</P>
<P>
Dahlgren: "We feel like fools now. We got nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Worthley could not be reached for comment, but Bill Rowan, supervisor of the 
DFG's Eastern Sierra hatcheries, said year-round fishing would harm the 
spawning process. 
</P>
<P>
"They get out there in their waders, stomping through the gravel, and you don't 
know how many little guys or eggs they kill," Rowan said. "People can go in 
there 'perch' fishing, you know, and say, 'Whoops, I happened to catch this 
trout,' and put it back." 
</P>
<P>
Wardens have monitored the situation but issued no citations. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, though, according to the Mammoth Times, Ken Brown, the DFG's 
chief of wardens in Inyo and Mono Counties, asked county District Attorney Stan 
Eller to write Dahlgren warning him that his group may be breaking the law. 
</P>
<P>
Eller did so -- then withdrew the warning when the anglers protested and he 
learned the DFG was planning to make year-round, catch-and-release fishing on 
the Owens legal next season. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Jim Becker of Arcadia took his 22-pound 4-ounce German brown trolling with a 
Rapala lure at Upper Twin Lake out of Bridgeport. It was 33 inches long, with a 
girth of 22 1/4 inches. The state record is 26-8 by Danny Stearman of 
Bakersfield. The largest trout caught anywhere in the Eastern Sierra last 
season was 16-9. . . . Erin Thomas, 6 1/2, of Bakersfield, caught a 3-pound, 
4-ounce brown at Grant Lake in the June loop, using pink Power Bait. Blake 
Vitali, Long Beach, and Joe Schonert, Highland, each had 5-4 rainbows at June 
and Silver Lakes, respectively, and Dale Fleming, Altadena, caught a 1 
1/2-pound cutthroat, 15 inches long. 
</P>
<P>
At Crowley Lake, among 6,000 anglers in 1,200 boats and along the shore, Ben 
Tow of Bakersfield won the H. Werner Buck trophy and $100 for the biggest 
opening-day catch, a six-pound brown. . . . Around Mammoth Lakes, Hot Creek fly 
anglers said the fish were running "larger than they'd ever seen 'em," 
according to Fred Rowe. Lots of 21-23-inch spawning rainbows were going for 
gold-ribbed hare's ears and blackstone fly nymphs. Float fishermen and trollers 
were doing best at the Twin Lakes.

DALE MURPHY'S BAT SHOWING SOME SIGNS OF LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDY KEENAN, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, Dale Murphy, a two-time National League MVP, was about all the 
Atlanta Braves had going for them. Not anymore. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta organization is stocked with promising young pitchers, a number of 
starters are hitting in the .300 range and the Braves are battling for first 
place in the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
All this and Murphy's bat has been mostly invisible. His spring training was 
horrible and he began the season the same way -- 3 for 27 in his first eight 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Through 15 games, he was at .136 with just five RBI. "And it wasn't like I 
didn't have chances," Murphy said before Tuesday night's 2-1 loss to the New 
York Mets. "The guys in front of me are all hitting over .300." 
</P>
<P>
Things got so bad that last Wednesday, when a stray dog was brought into the 
Braves' clubhouse and Murphy decided to take it home, his wife, Nancy, 
suggested they call the dog "Slumper." Always the optimist, Murphy opted for 
"Candy." 
</P>
<P>
Before striking out three times against the Mets Tuesday night, the career .274 
hitter gave strong indications that he was breaking out of the worst and 
longest drought of his career. But as unwelcome as Murphy's slump has been, it 
has shown the Braves they can at least tread water without their franchise 
player. "We won a lot of games without him getting hits at all," Manager Russ 
Nixon said. "It makes it a lot easier when he does -- as witnessed Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
On that day, Murphy went 4 for 5, driving in six runs as the Braves defeated 
the San Diego Padres, 9-4. In the four-game series against San Diego, Murphy 
broke out, going 8 for 17 with three home runs and 10 RBI. "I've always been 
kind of streaky," said Murphy, who is unconvinced this is the end of his 
troubles. "For me, it's not all of a sudden and it's over with. It's a 
day-to-day thing I have to work on. I don't feel I have a swing that's always 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Until this winter, everyone figured the 33-year-old would forever be a Brave. 
But after his sub-Murphy season in 1988 -- .226, 24 homers, 77 RBI -- his name 
was bandied about in trade talks with the Mets, the Padres and the Houston 
Astros. 
</P>
<P>
"It really hasn't been a big hassle or a big problem," Murphy said of the trade 
talk. "It has stopped. All I've told the Braves is, if something comes up that 
they feel is beneficial to me, I'd look at it. Every player in the game 
realizes he may not be on the same team forever." 
</P>
<P>
All talk of moving Murphy was stopped by the slump. Midway through it, Nixon 
decided to move him out of the cleanup spot. But unlike some other managers, he 
moved his heavy hitter up to the No. 2 spot, not down, for more at-bats and 
less pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"That was when he was going really badly and we wanted to get his mind off 
being in the cleanup spot and let him stop worrying about driving in runs and 
just loosen up," Nixon said. "He's worked extremely hard at it." 
</P>
<P>
"Russ has shown great patience with me," Murphy said. "But I don't think anyone 
owes me anything." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy took extra batting practice and worked with batting coach Clarence 
Jones. "I felt he was letting the ball get too close to him," Jones said. "He 
was waiting too long for the ball. I think he's out of it now." 
</P>
<P>
After the hitting spree against the Padres, Murphy is a month ahead of his 1988 
RBI pace of 77. He is hitting .200 (16 for 80) with four homers and 15 RBI. 
</P>
<P>
But for almost three weeks, the Braves were carrying Murphy and not vice versa. 
"It's been frustrating, but it helps when you're not doing exactly what you 
want to be doing and the team's winning anyway," he said. "It means there are 
24 guys on this team who can play. It doesn't matter how good one person does."

AUSTRIAN CREATES GAME COMBINING SOCCER AND TENNIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

VIENNA, Austria 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
And now for the latest spesoc scores: Austria 3, the United States 2. 
</P>
<P>
Spesoc? Of course. 
</P>
<P>
It's a combination of soccer and tennis created by a former Austrian soccer 
league player to get round the lack of players at the school where he once 
coached. 
</P>
<P>
"Spesoc or Special Soccer is a game for the world," Wolfgang Anderl said in an 
interview. "You need only two things: goalie ability and a good leg to score." 
</P>
<P>
"People like to watch direct duels between players like in tennis. And I'm sure 
that many, including prominent athletes, like to play soccer in singles or 
doubles." 
</P>
<P>
Dreaming of the future, Anderl has already designed a 20,000-seat arena, 
devised a full set of rules and even laid the groundwork for a WSA -- World 
Spesoc Association -- governing body. 
</P>
<P>
Such grandiose plans seemed far removed from the chilly field where Austria 
recently downed a U.S. team in a Saturday afternoon game watched by just a few 
dozen spectators. 
</P>
<P>
As in conventional soccer, the object was to score goals with kicks. Only the 
goalie could handle the ball. 
</P>
<P>
But each team had only two or three players. The 100-foot by 100-foot field was 
divided into two halves, each containing zones for defense, attack and free 
play. 
</P>
<P>
In the attack zone, players could touch the ball only twice before taking a 
shot on goal. Only in the free zone could the ball be kicked around and 
dribbled as in conventional soccer. 
</P>
<P>
Like tennis, spesoc has no time limit. Games are over the best of five sets, 
each set lasting until one team scores six goals. Where games are tied at two 
sets all, teams have the option of playing a penalty shootout or a fifth set. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an interesting game, particularly in a city where there is the problem of 
space. You can play it anywhere," enthused David Hagan, a sports professor at 
the American School in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
Hagan, who used to play with English third division club Aldershot, coached the 
U.S team which battled Anderl's Austrians. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is to create a grassroots basis and find people to play it," 
admitted the coach, whose American squad consisted of a Yugoslav, a Turk, an 
Austrian, a Dane and a Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
"Spesoc is more goal oriented and it has more action than classical soccer but, 
on the minus side, it takes dribbling and technical combinations out of the 
game. It's all shoot," Hagan said. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans won the first two sets 6-4, 6-4. But then Anderl brought another 
twist of Spesoc into play. 
</P>
<P>
He resorted to a "risk play," pitting just one Austrian against two opponents. 
In that situations, the lone player scores two sets by winning only one. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Sir, 17, booted in six goals for Austria against just one for the 
visitors to tie the scores at 2-sets all. Austria then proved superior in the 
decisive penalty shootout. 
</P>
<P>
Enthusiastic cheers from the small pro-Austria crowd were scarcely matched on 
the field, however. 
</P>
<P>
"As a variation it's good. But we like more the big soccer," said Makoto 
Niiyama from Kagoshima, Japan, the U.S. goalie. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, Anderl still hopes to export the game to the United States, home to 
1994 World Cup soccer tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"In Vienna there is less and less interest for soccer in general," he lamented. 
"In America the atmosphere is better."

INJURY-HAMPERED U.S. NEEDS A VICTORY TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The United States national soccer team is likely to be without both its most 
experienced player, Rick Davis, and its most creative player, Hugo Perez, when 
it plays Costa Rica in a vital World Cup qualifying match today at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who has been the backbone of the U.S. team for more than a decade, is 
questionable because of an injury, and Perez, arguably the most inventive and 
technically skilled of the American players, is definitely sidelined with one. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves Coach Bob Gansler with a problem. Having lost the first of its 
eight qualifying games, 1-0, to Costa Rica in Costa Rica on April 16, the U.S. 
team is faced with a virtual must-win situation today if it is to avoid falling 
further behind in the five-team qualifying group. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the five teams plays a home-and-home series against the other four. Two 
points are awarded for a win, one for a tie and none for a loss. The top two 
teams in the final standings will advance to next year's World Cup in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica leads the standings with four points after two wins and a loss. 
Guatemala is second with two points after splitting its series with Costa Rica. 
The United States has no points after one loss. The two other teams in the 
group, El Salvador and Trinidad &amp; Tobago, have yet to play. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans controlled much of the play at San Jose two weeks ago, but were 
unable to overcome a slow start, during which they allowed Costa Rica to take 
the lead in the 14th minute. With a crowd of 26,271, including Costa Rican 
President Oscar Arias, cheering them on, the Costa Rican players hung on for 
the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We came out tentative and lackadaisical in the first half," Gansler told 
Soccer America magazine. "It picked up in the second half, but we didn't create 
enough (scoring) chances for ourselves. . . . Whether it was the sun, the 
crowd, the wrong breakfast, whatever. We just played too slowly." 
</P>
<P>
Davis and Perez missed the first game, too, and their absence showed. Without 
Davis' stabilizing influence in the midfield and defense, the United States at 
times appeared shaky under pressure. On attack, meanwhile, it missed the skills 
that Perez brings to the game. Tab Ramos was impressive, but the Americans 
would have posed a greater threat had he been able to team with Perez. 
</P>
<P>
Gansler, who has been criticized for playing Perez in the Marlboro Cup games at 
Miami before he had fully recovered, recognized the need for more creativity on 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
"We were setting up well," he said of the game in San Jose, "but either the 
pass wouldn't come or our movement off the ball was nonexistent. Our players 
were not creating the great passing angle so we could play behind their 
players. We needed to go forward with more urgency." 
</P>
<P>
The United States is likely to do that today at St. Louis Soccer Park in 
suburban Fenton, Mo. The 8,500-seat stadium has been sold out for the game, 
which will be televised live on ESPN at 1 p.m. (PDT). 
</P>
<P>
"We're capable of playing better than we did," Gansler said. "We'll be ready 
for them in St. Louis." 
</P>
<P>
After today's match, the U.S. team heads west to begin preparing for its May 13 
qualifying match against Trinidad &amp; Tobago at El Camino College in 
Torrance.

Juan Martin Coggi of Argentina retained his World Boxing Assn. junior 
welterweight title, surviving two knockdowns on his way to a unanimous 12-round 
decision over Japanese challenger Akinobu Hiranaka at Vasto, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The champion appeared on the verge of being upset in the third round, when he 
was floored twice by Hiranaka (17-1) and received an eight-count from British 
referee John Coyle. Coggi (40-1) regained control of the fight with a 
succession of left hooks. 
</P>
<P>
Coyle scored the fight 117-109, judges Rose Grabble of New York had it 117-108

NEWSWIRE: ROSE MAY HAVE BEEN ASKED TO 'STEP ASIDE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pete Rose rejected a suggestion by the baseball commissioner's office to "step 
aside" as manager of the Cincinnati Reds until its investigation into his 
gambling activities was completed, it was reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"The commissioner's office did not order him to step aside, did not request him 
to step aside," said Hal Bodley, baseball editor for USA Today said on CNN's 
Baseball '89. ". . . but it's one of these things where they would have liked 
for him to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete said 'No.' I think it was the right thing to say, frankly, because if he 
had stepped aside, that would have been a clear admission of guilt on his 
part." 
</P>
<P>
Bodley is a longtime friend of Rose's and the Reds' manager was the best man at 
Bodley's wedding. 
</P>
<P>
Said Rose: "He wrote that last week. Because it was on TV, does that make a 
difference? How would Bodley know, he wasn't there. To my knowledge, Bodley 
wasn't there when it happened."

Afterward, a Soviet official said the line of Larionov, Vladimir Krutov and

</P>
<P>
In the second game, Cal Lutheran pitcher Kevin O'Neil (5-2) went seven innings 
and gave up two runs on six hits. 
</P>

Cal State Northridge 12-9, Southern Utah State 1-6 -- Craig Clayton helped the 
Matadors sweep the Thunderbirds by striking out seven batters in the last five 
innings of the second game in Cedar City, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
The freshman also had two doubles in the game and Greg Hansen hit a two-run 
home run in the second inning for the Matadors (26-15-1). 
</P>
<P>
In the first game, Vale Lopez threw a five-hitter while CSUN pounded out 18 
hits off three Southern Utah pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge dropped a one-inning make up of Friday's snow-delayed game when 
Southern Utah (15-26) scored a run to win, 10-9. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard 13, Moorpark 2 -- Steve Sisco doubled and added a solo home run in the 
eighth inning for host Moorpark (22-15, 11-9) in the Western State Conference 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard's John Stuart pitched a complete game, allowing one earned run and eight 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura 8, Pierce 2 -- Scott Cadenhead went one for three and drove in both 
Pierce runs in the Brahmas' WSC loss at home. 
</P>
<P>

hits and five walks. He also had four strikeouts. Tony Dello was two for four 
and Billy Morris was two for four with a double for Pierce (15-19, 8-11). 
</P>
<P>
Ventura clinched at least a share of the conference title. Canyons can tie 
Ventura for the WSC title with a victory Monday over Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
SOFTBALL 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge 4-5, Cal State Bakersfield 0-8 -- Heather Lindstrom gave 
up three hits and posted her 11th shutout in the first game as the Lady 
Matadors split a California Collegiate Athletic Assn. doubleheader at CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
Lindstrom had four strikeouts and Lisa Erickson and Leilani Artis each had two 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
In the second game, CSUN committed three errors in Cal State Bakersfield's 
five-run third inning. All five runs were unearned against starter Debbie 
Dickmann (26-5). 
</P>
<P>
Anna Getherall, Erin McGuire and Artis each had two hits for the Lady Matadors 
(54-16, 16-4), who already had clinched their eight consecutive conference 
title. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran 4-11, Loyola Marymount 1-0 -- Cal Lutheran (31-16) won its final

SWINTON WEATHERS ACADEMIC DIFFICULTY AT WASHINGTON STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BAXTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While he was making the grade on the football field last fall, Washington 
State's Rich Swinton was posting unsatisfactory grades in the classroom. But 
after a semester on academic probation, the former National Merit Scholar from 
Montclair Prep said that the crisis is over. 
</P>
<P>
"I got caught up in the college life -- partying -- and I lost sight of my 
goals," he said. "It took this big kick in the rear to wake me up. I'm awake 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Swinton became only the sixth ballcarrier in Washington State 
history to rush for more than 1,000 yards, running for 1,018 yards and 12 
touchdowns as the Cougars posted a 9-3 record and earned an Aloha Bowl bid. But 
WSU's best performance on the field since 1930 did not carry over into the 
classroom, where the team's grade-point average dropped to 1.94. 
</P>
<P>
Five players, including Swinton and fellow 1,000-yard rusher Steve Broussard, 
did so poorly that the school's academic review board placed them on probation. 
In order to qualify for reinstatement to the university, the players had to sit 
out spring practice, which concluded with Friday's intrasquad game. 
</P>
<P>
Washington State's spring semester ends this week, but Swinton already has 
taken two finals that, he says, he "passed with flying colors." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be around here whether they want me back or not," Swinton said by 
phone from Pullman, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Swinton graduated from Montclair Prep with a 3.4 GPA and considered attending 
Harvard before joining high school teammate Tim Stallworth at Washington State. 
Stallworth was held out of Friday's game for failing to complete his football 
physical. 
</P>
<P>
Swinton, who redshirted his freshman year, will be a junior next season. He 
changed his major from business to sociology this semester after his college 
GPA dropped to "about two." 
</P>
<P>
"Last semester damaged my GPA a little bit, but when the new grades come in, it 
will be in the mid-two range," Swinton said. "I'm OK. I'm no longer in the 
red." 
</P>
<P>
Swinton, an honorable mention All-Pacific 10 selection last fall, will remain 
in Pullman to attend summer school and to get ready for the football season.

CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE SPRING FOOTBALL; 
</P>
<P>
SCRIMMAGE DOMINATED BY DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is a sure bet that Joe Rice will never inspire comparisons to Jerry Rice, 
but the Cal State Northridge receiver can at least say he was the most 
impressive player on offense as the Matadors concluded spring drills with a 
scrimmage Saturday night at North Campus Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
That, however, is not saying much. 
</P>
<P>
The defense, which was given points for interceptions, stopping first downs and 
recovering fumbles, defeated the offense, 18-7. 
</P>
<P>
A preview of things to come? Bob Burt, Northridge's coach, can half hope so. 
Perhaps the defense will make a lot of teams look bad. 
</P>
<P>
For now, attribute the Matadors' sluggishness on offense to jitters brought on 
by a new quarterback -- Sherdrick Bonner -- at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
And, perhaps more so, to the absence of four offensive linemen who are out for 
the spring because of injury or temporary ineligibility. 
</P>
<P>
That left Rice, a 5-foot-10, 168-pound junior, to impress. And he did just 
that, catching five passes for 50 yards and the offense's only touchdown on a 
17-yard pass from Bonner. 
</P>
<P>
Burt said that Rice was one of a handful of players to "up their stock at bit" 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Rice, who has been to four colleges -- Pierce, Glendale, Cal State Long Beach 
and CSUN -- since leaving Verdugo Hills High, seemed content with that 
assessment afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I had to really get out and prove myself," he said. "I'm just glad they 
felt confident enough to give me a shot out there." 
</P>
<P>
Bonner, who played caddy for Rob Huffman at quarterback the past two seasons, 
completed 13 of 21 passes for 97 yards, but he threw two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"There were some flashes of what we expect him to do," Burt said of Bonner. 
</P>
<P>
The interceptions -- by Ed Mitchell and Baron Atkinson -- came on back-to-back 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
"It always looks like the quarterback's fault, but there were some routes that 
weren't right," Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Bratten, the No. 2 man on the quarterback depth chart, completed eight of 
12 passes for 68 yards, and Chris Folsom was two of eight for 12 yards with an 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was concerned about the prospect of entering the season without an 
experienced backup at quarterback, Burt was polite. 
</P>
<P>
"I know one thing," he said. "If Sherdrick is not in there sometime this 
season, we're definitely going to run it down their throats until they stop 
it." 
</P>
<P>
A ringing endorsement it was not. 
</P>
<P>
A lighter and stronger player will be starting at tailback for the Matadors 
when they open the season Sept. 2 at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
No, Albert Fann, a two-time All-Western Football Conference selection, has not 
been replaced. But he has shed 12 pounds from last season's playing weight. 
</P>
<P>
Fann, a junior, played at 225 pounds last season but plans to stay between 210 
and 215 this fall. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so light it feels weird," Fann said. "I'm a lot faster because I'm still 
used to carrying all that weight. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I'm stronger, too, because I get more forward motion going." 
</P>
<P>
Fann, who gained 973 yards last season, will work out under the supervision of 
a personal trainer this summer. 
</P>
<P>
A sprained left foot cut short Fann's participation in Saturday's scrimmage. He 
carried four times for nine yards and caught one pass for two yards.

TISCH GETTING REPUTATION AS MEDIA'S 'WRONG WAY CORRIGAN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No matter how lustily they cheer you one moment, an audience can turn sullen 
and sour the next. That's a fact well known to show business pros, and one that 
a relative newcomer to the business, CBS Inc. Chief Executive Laurence A. 
Tisch, may be learning. 
</P>
<P>
Tisch was applauded mightily for the prices he got when he sold off CBS' 
magazine, record and music publishing businesses in 1986 and 1987. But at least 
some in his audience now say this acknowledged master of corporate husbandry 
might have missed a run-up in media prices and sold too cheaply. 
</P>
<P>
The critics point out that the magazine division was sold for $650 million in 
June, 1987, to a buyer who in 10 months had resold it in pieces for a total of 
$1 billion. The music publishing unit, unloaded by CBS in December, 1986, for 
$125 million, was resold last January for $337 million. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, executives such as David Geffen, chairman of Geffen Records, and 
Bob Buziak, president of RCA Records, believe that CBS could have gotten 
another $1 billion when it sold CBS Records to Sony for $2 billion in early 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wish Larry Tisch would sell me something," said Geffen, whose record 
company is an affiliate of Warner Communications. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some industry executives have come to view Tisch as the Wrong Way 
Corrigan of the media business as they have watched him sell properties when 
others were snatching them up to build communications conglomerates. 
</P>
<P>
The contrast between CBS and the pack has been striking recently as Time Inc. 
has agreed to merge with Warner Communications, Sony has prowled for a movie 
studio, and foreign conglomerates Bertelsmann A. G., Hachette S. A. and Rupert 
Murdoch's News Corp. have sought to expand their empires. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody else has been scrambling to prepare for the competition of global 
media companies, and CBS has been bailing out," says RCA's Buziak. 
</P>
<P>
Tisch staunchly defends the prices CBS got as the best available at the time, 
or now. He notes that when CBS unloaded the properties, the conventional wisdom 
was that buyers had overpaid. 
</P>
<P>
"We sold at peak prices," he says, defining the top price as "what you can get 
in cash -- not in conversation." 
</P>
<P>
CBS' asset sales have been a sensitive subject virtually since the board room 
coup in September, 1986, that gave the chief executive's title to Tisch. While 
Tisch had wide support for his plan to restore stability after two years of 
takeover threats and low morale, some employees, investors -- reportedly even 
directors -- opposed a divestiture strategy that they felt ran counter to the 
original vision of CBS founder William S. Paley. 
</P>
<P>
But Tisch persevered, believing that the non-broadcast divisions weren't worth 
the distraction to management. The other businesses hadn't been as profitable 
as broadcasting or, like the record business, were dangerously volatile, he 
felt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Peeling Away Layers 
</P>
<P>
In peeling away CBS' layers, Tisch was applying the strategy that earned him 
profit and praise when Loews Corp., of which he is chairman, took over CNA 
Financial Services in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Loews won the insurance company in a bitterly contested takeover battle, then 
sold off such extraneous properties as CNA's nursing home, dental supply and 
second-mortgage businesses. With a tighter focus, CNA boomed. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently with that success in mind, Tisch sold CBS' 21 consumer magazines in 
June, 1987, to an investor group that included CBS Magazines Chief Executive 
Peter Diamandis, other managers and the Prudential Insurance Co. The magazine 
group was one of the biggest around and included such titles as Woman's Day, 
Stereo Review and Car &amp; Driver. 
</P>
<P>
The price of $650 million was dizzying when considered as a multiple of the 
company's cash flow, the standard often used to measure such deals. (Cash flow 
is net income plus depreciation and other non-cash charges.) The price 
represented 14 times CBS Magazines' cash flow at a time when other magazine 
companies were going for between eight and 10 times cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
Some in the industry wondered whether Diamandis would be able to pay off his 
prodigious debts. 
</P>
<P>
A disappointed bidder was Hachette S.A., the French publishing conglomerate 
that was searching the world media market with hungry eyes. Hachette officials 
had opened talks at a price under $500 million, moved up to $570 million and 
then "wouldn't go a penny higher," says Tisch. 
</P>
<P>
Within a few months of the sale, the newly formed Diamandis Communications Inc. 
sold off seven of its new titles in several deals. Then, to everyone's 
astonishment, Diamandis announced that Hachette had bought the remaining 14 
titles for $712 million. It was $142 million more than Hachette had previously 
bid for the whole 21-magazine group, and it brought the Diamandis group's gross 
profit from the magazines' resale to $350 million. 
</P>
<P>
Hachette topped its earlier bid partially because Diamandis had cut overhead to 
streamline the company. But the higher bid was also a sign of a growing 
interest in magazine concerns and the steady stream of cash they provide to 
companies that own them. 
</P>
<P>
That new interest has helped lift prices for top magazine properties to between 
12 and 14 times cash flow, investment bankers say. 
</P>
<P>
The most striking example of the new demand for top-tier magazines came last 
August, when Rupert Murdoch paid a dizzying $3 billion, or 15 times cash flow, 
to buy Triangle Publications, owner of TV Guide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defends Prices 
</P>
<P>
Diamandis defends the price he paid and the one he got. "When I bought, I made 
CBS look smart; when Hachette bought they made me look smart," he said. "In a 
couple of years, the French will look smart, too." 
</P>
<P>
Tisch seems less sure of that. He considers Hachette's purchase a "fluke." 
</P>
<P>
"By any standard of business, they overpaid," he said. "But if they're happy, 
fine. I can't be responsible for what people do." 
</P>
<P>
Some people wondered whether a partnership called SBK Entertainment World 
overpaid when they bought CBS' music publishing business, called CBS Songs, in 
December, 1986. The $125-million price set a new record for music publishing 
companies, which own the rights to songs and profit by collecting royalties 
when anyone plays them. 
</P>
<P>
CBS Songs had an inventory of 250,000 titles, including such timeless tunes as 
"Singing in the Rain," and "Over the Rainbow." But the unit had never been of 
much interest to CBS' top brass; some insiders said flatly that it was poorly 
managed. 
</P>
<P>
So Tisch was happy to agree when CBS Records boss Walter Yetnikoff suggested 
that the company open negotiations to sell the property. 
</P>
<P>
When SBK outbid a management-led investor group to win, it began streamlining 
the company and got more aggressive in making anybody who used its songs pay up 
for the privilege. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the partnership quickly drove up a key measure of its 
profitability, the so-called net publisher's share, or revenues minus artists' 
royalties. Within two years, net publisher's share rose 70% to $37 million. 
</P>
<P>
But those improvements were part only part of the reason that Thorn/EMI, a 
London conglomerate, was willing to buy the company last January for three 
times what SBK paid for it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heating Up 
</P>
<P>
The other key factor was the market for music publishing businesses, which was 
heating up rapidly. Music publishers' profitability had begun to rise because 
of an increase in the standard royalty that publishers receive and an explosion 
of foreign demand for Anglo-American songs with the wider international 
penetration of television. 
</P>
<P>
While these publishing units formerly sold for four to eight times their annual 
net publisher's share, now some were going for 11 times that figure, or more. 
Among other pace-setting deals was Warner Bros. Music's 1987 purchase of the 
400,000-song Chappell &amp; Co. for about $250 million. 
</P>
<P>
Tisch says he can't take responsibility for the CBS Songs deal, since the price 
was negotiated by Yetnikoff and the divestiture had been approved by his 
predecessor, former CEO Thomas Wyman, when Tisch joined the company. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he defends the price. "It looked like a hell of a sale at the time," 
Tisch says. 
</P>
<P>
CBS Records' sale price of $2 billion looked equally impressive when CBS 
negotiated the deal with Sony Corp. in December, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it seemed startlingly high compared to the $1.25 billion that Tisch 
initially asked. Some wondered whether the Japanese company hadn't gone too far 
in its desire to buy up the "software" needed to complement its audio hardware. 
</P>
<P>
But some evaluations changed as the surging profits in the record business 
helped drive up prices and sparked buyers' interests. Last year turned out to 
be a red-letter year for the industry, partly due to continued strong domestic 
sales of CDs and partly to the growth of demand for American music overseas. 
Many executives in the business expect the gravy train to keep rolling. 
</P>
<P>
"CD players are in 12% of homes, but by 1995 that will be 60%," says record and 
movie magnate Geffen. "A lot more players means a lot more CDs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shared in Prosperity 
</P>
<P>
CBS Records has shared in the prosperity. Its pretax earnings surged to $340 
million in 1988 from $187 million in 1987. Chief Executive Yetnikoff has told 
associates that, so far this year, the company's sales have topped those of 
1988 on a month-to-month basis. 
</P>
<P>
Tisch, like some other analysts, is not nearly so bullish. CBS had a management 
consultant study the future of the music business, he says, and decided that 
the profitability of CDs would fall off sharply. 
</P>
<P>
"We were making $4 a disc, but new capacity comes on, competition comes in -- 
these things never last forever," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Tisch says CBS Records' recent profits are misleading. While 1988 pretax 
earnings reached $340 million, over the past five years earnings averaged about 
$125 million, he says. And before the sale, CBS executives were concerned that 
the labels of competitor Warner Communications were eating into its U.S. market 
share. 
</P>
<P>
Tisch maintains the CBS Records deal is better than most outsiders have 
recognized because the contract provided that more than $200 million in CBS 
Records assets would revert to CBS. By that measure, CBS actually got $2.2 
billion for the property, Tisch says. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts and industry officials sympathize with Tisch's view that CBS sold 
near the top, got good prices and shouldn't be faulted for later changes in the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
"J. P. Morgan made a fortune selling too early," said Ernest Levenstein, 
analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton. 
</P>
<P>
Tisch is certainly making no apologies for selling off CBS' non-broadcast 
properties, though most of the media herd is thundering in the opposite 
direction. In his view, arguments about building worldwide media powers are 
"nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
"How do our magazines help anybody compete worldwide?" he asks. "Knowing in 
hindsight what I do today, I'd do it all over again."

WALL STREET / JOHN CRUDELE: EVEN THE EXPERTS DISAGREE ON THE MARKET'S DIRECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CRUDELE, JOHN CRUDELE is a financial columnist for the New York Post. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stock prices have risen almost 10% since last fall, but the climb hasn't always 
been smooth. The market dipped sharply for a while in February and then again 
in March as Wall Street wrestled with the fact that interest rates were 
climbing at a quicker pace than at anytime in the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, most of the thinkers on Wall Street -- the market strategists, 
analysts and money managers -- are euphoric about the stock market's impressive 
showing over the past few weeks. In April, the closely watched Dow Jones 
industrial average rose to its highest level since the October, 1987, crash. 
</P>
<P>
But many traders -- the folks on the front line, as well as a small minority of 
strategists -- still aren't celebrating. They're concerned that if interest 
rates go up another notch or so, the smiles will fade quickly and the market 
will be bowled over. They also are bothered by the fact that a slowdown in the 
economy -- one of the chief factors that could bring interest rates down -- 
also might create a concern that corporate profits will be hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Last week I asked three Wall Street pros with widely different opinions of 
what's in store for the stock market to argue their cases. Here's what they had 
to say: 
</P>
<P>
* Joseph Feshbach, senior vice president of market analysis with 
Prudential-Bache Securities, has long been very high on the stock market's 
chances for success. He hasn't changed that opinion one iota, except that he 
now believes prices could backtrack a bit temporarily from current levels. 
</P>
<P>
"Investors and Wall Street are of the mentality that they have to be protective 
of their assets at this point. The whole planet has become very risk averse," 
says Feshbach, who doesn't believe people have yet gotten over the crash. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a complete disinterest and distrust of equities," says Feshbach. 
</P>
<P>
He believes that the best thing an investor can do is go against the prevailing 
mood. "You always look for where investors are not. That's where the greatest 
potential is," Feshbach adds. At the current time, that's the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
People who get into the market now could see their investment appreciate nicely 
over the next few years, Feshbach believes. "I think we will average a 15% to 
20% gain in the market in each of the next four to five years," he says. "It's 
the bull market that never was. And I think the market will go up without the 
excesses of the last few years." 
</P>
<P>
Feshbach believes that the dollar has been stabilized and won't be subject to 
the wide swings of recent years. That, he says, will bring foreign investors 
back into the U.S. stock and bond markets. Foreigners, especially the Japanese, 
have been much less a factor in the U.S. stock market in recent years because 
of concern about the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Feshbach doesn't think investors have to worry about interest rates either. 
"Interest rates will be stable for the rest of the year. They will be a 
non-event," he predicts. Likewise, the economy will continue to grow at a 
steady, non-inflationary pace that won't create unusual concerns about 
inflation. But Feshbach does concede that an occasional monthly economic figure 
could still either excite or horrify Wall Street, depending on whether or not 
it forecasts inflation. 
</P>
<P>
* Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer for First Albany Corp., is concerned 
about the stock market's recent performance. "I feel the way I felt in the 
summer of 1987," says Johnson. "I feel uncomfortable with current stock market 
levels." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson is not predicting another crash, but he does think that the Dow could 
easily fall about 270 points from the 2,400 level that it reached this month. 
The fall could be even greater if -- as Johnson believes -- stock prices climb 
a bit more before suffering a reversal. 
</P>
<P>
Why is Johnson concerned about the stock market down the road? "If interest 
rates are high, it's hard to justify (buying) stocks. And interest rates are 
high," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Even worse, rising oil prices probably will increase concern over inflation in 
the months ahead and "it may demand that the Federal Reserve respond by raising 
interest rates." 
</P>
<P>
Also, if interest rates go up overseas (as they did in West Germany two weeks 
ago), that could force rates up in the United States. If the Fed does not 
respond by raising interest rates, the dollar could suffer and even more 
foreign investors could be driven out of America's financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also said his analytical work suggests that corporate profits aren't of 
the same "quality" as they were in the early 1980s because of changes in the 
tax laws. By "quality," Johnson means that companies are not generating as much 
cash from their operations as they once did. 
</P>
<P>
Without the cash, Johnson says, it will be harder for companies to restructure 
themselves or buy other companies. And mergers, acquisitions and restructurings 
were one of the prime components of the stock market's good fortune during the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson says the risk of a recession later this year or in early 1990 also 
could make the stock market treacherous. "Common sense tells you, at the 
minimum, be vigilant, but most likely you should be defensive." 
</P>
<P>
After 1990, Johnson thinks that stocks will be a good investment again. The 
economy will slow, labor shortages will ease and factories won't be cranking 
out widgets at such a frantic pace. Inflation fears then will ease, interest 
rates will decline and investors will be looking for a good place to put their 
money. "Then I like stocks," Johnson concluded. 
</P>
<P>
* Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist at Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben, 
Cleveland, probably represents the majority of experts when he predicts that 
the stock market won't do much in the short run. "It's not going to be bullish 
because it's fully priced. It's not going to be bearish, either, because there 
is too much money on the sidelines," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates may go up a bit, Chalasani says. But, he says, "I believe the 
market has already taken this into account." 
</P>
<P>
Gulf &amp; Western Inc. announced a few weeks ago that it no longer wants to be 
in the financial services business. And an investment banker who puts together 
deals in that industry says this could be the start of a trend. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Stearns, of Shearson Lehman Hutton, says corporations that bought 
financial service companies years ago in diversification efforts may be having 
a change of heart. He says that, while these financial businesses have done 
well, they also have been a drag on stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
There is one problem that Stearns sees. "Who's going to buy them?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
Since banks are legally able to loan out 20 times the amount of capital they 
hold, and financial services organizations only seven times their capital, 
banks are in a superior competitive position. So banks are, therefore, the most 
natural buyer of these financial organizations. 
</P>
<P>
But banks have more than enough things to buy these days, especially with 
failing savings and loans coming on the market by the bushel-full. 
</P>
<P>
Have you noticed that there aren't many takeover attempts being initiated these 
days? 
</P>
<P>
While there are still plenty of rumors about takeovers and a lot of folks on 
Wall Street who think that they know what a company would be worth if taken 
over, there has been, in fact, a sharp falloff in the number of actual deals. 
</P>
<P>
One investment banker who represents a number of very acquisitive clients says 
rising interest rates, climbing stock prices and the recent chaos in the "junk 
bond" market have sent the people he works for running. Will things pick up 
soon? "I'd take a vacation," this investment banker advises. 
</P>
<P>
According to M&amp;A Database, Philadelphia, there were 1,069 deals announced 
between January 1 and last week. In that same period last year there were 1,505 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-nine percent of workers who've ever been fired were let go because of 
incompetence, according to a survey by Robert Half International, the 
recruiting consulting firm. But 17% were fired because they didn't get along 
with co-workers, 12% for dishonesty or lying and 10% because they had a 
negative attitude. The consulting firm also said one-quarter of all employees 
will be fired at some time . . . 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the outplacement consulting firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas 
Inc. says only one out of every five job seekers is willing to go to work for a 
troubled company. "To the risk taker, a situation where a company has lost 
substantial share of market or has undergone large-scale cutbacks in facilities 
and personnel is exciting," says James Challenger . . . 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Lawrence Harris of Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, whose prediction of 
a restructuring at Lockheed was right on the money, thinks that Martin Marietta 
and Raytheon are the next two aerospace companies that eventually will undergo 
shake-ups . . . 
</P>
<P>
The rumor that Robert Maxwell is interested in acquiring McGraw-Hill has been 
around for a long time. But a Wall Street source close to the British 
publisher/investor says the rumor wasn't true the first half-dozen times it 
made the rounds and wasn't true last week when it made the rounds again. But 
the source does add that McGraw-Hill might be interesting enough for someone to 
go after . . . 
</P>
<P>
Believe it or not, NWA Corp. is said to be thinking about selling off some 
assets -- including its Japanese real estate -- to help avoid a takeover. 
Proceeds from sale of the assets presumably would be used to pay a special 
dividend to shareholders. While most experts think that it's a little too late 
for this tactic, NWA is said to be seriously looking into this possibility and 
making contact with prospective buyers . . . 
</P>
<P>
Prudential-Bache Securities analyst B. Alex Henderson estimates that Xerox 
would be worth $100 to $125 a share if it were broken up. That's almost twice 
what the stock is selling for. But Henderson thinks the likelihood of a breakup 
is slim. Nevertheless, Xerox's stock rose sharply on his report.

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / ALLAN H. MELTZER: INFLATION AND ITS AFTERMATH; 
</P>
<P>
ALLAN H. MELTZER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN H. MELTZER is J.M. Olin Professor of Political Economy and Public 
Policy at Carnegie Mellon University and a visiting scholar at the American 
Enterprise Institute.

<P>
The overstatement that characterizes much of what is called news has been 
directed, once again, toward inflation. Much of the recent excitement was 
caused by a spurt in the producer price index. This measure, heavily weighted 
toward prices of imports and raw materials, rose by 1% in January and February 
before subsiding in March. Responding to the threat, the Federal Reserve Board 
raised interest rates, and its members tried to seem determined when they 
talked about the problem of renewed inflation and their commitment to a return 
to price stability. 
</P>
<P>
Memories of the 1970s and the recession of 1981-82 are so recent that few need 
to be reminded about the costs of inflation and disinflation, the latter 
including recession. Critics of the Federal Reserve, particularly on Wall 
Street, express concern that the Federal Reserve has not responded more 
aggressively to counter inflation. Although I have urged for many years that 
inflation should be eliminated totally, I find these criticisms misdirected and 
misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
The greater risk at the moment is not that the Federal Reserve will do too 
little but that it has done too much. The driving force in any sustained 
inflation is the prior rate of money growth. Without excessive money growth, 
inflation cannot persist. Recently, the growth rates of all monetary aggregates 
have been reduced, many to the lowest rates in years. These reductions began in 
early 1987 and gained momentum in the summer of 1987. Money growth remained at 
a low rate through 1988. Since late last year, money growth has fallen further. 
</P>
<P>
A recent spurt in oil prices increases the risk that monetary policy will 
remain restrictive too long. The oil price rise is the result of disruptions in 
supply, particularly in North Sea oil production. Events of this kind are 
distinct from the sustained inflation produced by excessive stimulus to demand. 
</P>
<P>
The rise in oil prices will at most raise the price level for a few months 
while inflation, if unchecked, results in a continuing stream of price 
increases that affect a wide range of goods and services. The problem is that 
the effects of the oil shock will be interpreted as evidence of a sustained, or 
increasing, rate of inflation that requires additional monetary contraction. 
</P>
<P>
The initial response to slower money growth is slower growth of spending and 
output. Evidence of slower growth has now become apparent. 
</P>
<P>
Most measures of domestic spending on housing, autos and retail sales, and on a 
variety of related items, give evidence that the economy's growth has slowed. 
Growth of foreign demand for our exports has slowed also in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
There are rising concerns about a recession, which is defined as two quarters 
of negative output growth. It does not matter much for current purposes whether 
we face a mild recession lasting two quarters or positive, but sluggish, growth 
of output for a few quarters. Economic forecasters have difficulty 
distinguishing between these alternatives, so there is not much point in 
sifting through their forecasts or guessing how much the economy will slow. 
What we know with reasonable reliability is that the first effects of 
restrictive Federal Reserve policy are now being felt. 
</P>
<P>
A period of slow growth, or even a mild recession, would be a small price to 
pay for getting the economy on the path toward price stability. The problem is 
that slow growth or recession is likely to set in motion forces that would, in 
time, lead to higher -- not lower -- inflation. The reason is that the Federal 
Reserve would be pressured from many sides to stimulate the economy by raising 
money growth to reduce interest rates. Concerns about farmers, bankers, Latin 
American debt, unemployment, thinly capitalized savings and loans and the 
increased government budget deficit (as tax collections fell) would be used to 
justify a more expansive policy. 
</P>
<P>
If the Federal Reserve would respond by pushing up money growth, we would be 
back to the stop-go-stop policy that brought us rising inflation, rising 
unemployment and rising interest rates from the mid-1960s to the early 1980s. A 
return to this policy now would mean that the recent 4% or 5% inflation would 
become the floor from which inflation would rise in the 1990s. This would be a 
costly mistake. 
</P>
<P>
The current inflation is the result of high money growth in 1986, when money 
growth soared under the Federal Reserve and Treasury policy of devaluing the 
dollar. The surge in money growth devalued the dollar, encouraged exports and 
stimulated domestic spending. Gradually, the increased money growth worked its 
way through the economy and has now emerged as higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
In my first column in this space, in August, 1987, I warned that higher 
inflation was the likely result of what was then called the Volcker standard, 
in honor of Paul A. Volcker, the Fed's chairman when the policy was in effect. 
That policy was mistaken. We are now paying for the mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, the Federal Reserve has recognized that inflation can best be 
eliminated by steady, non-inflationary policies. In his February testimony, 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan emphasized that "maximum sustainable 
economic growth over time is the Federal Reserve's ultimate objective. The 
primary role of monetary policy in the pursuit of this goal is to foster price 
stability." And he recognized that "inflation cannot persist without a 
supporting expansion in money and credit." 
</P>
<P>
The problem lies not in the goals but in the implementation. The Federal 
Reserve has been basing its recent actions on the belief that the economy 
cannot grow more than 2.5% or 3% a year without causing inflation to rise. When 
the economy shows signs of growing faster than 2.5%, the Federal Reserve raises 
market rates and reduces money growth. This is the main reason for slower money 
growth and a principal reason for higher interest rates in the past six months 
and rising concerns about recession. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed's principal mistake has been to use monetary policy to accomplish 
multiple objectives. In 1986, the objective was devaluation even if it produced 
a surge in prices. In 1988, the objective was slower real growth and 
disinflation. The result of this shifting about is likely to be the return of 
stagflation -- continued inflation, slow growth or possibly a brief recession. 
</P>
<P>
It is encouraging to have the Federal Reserve accept the restoration of price 
stability as its goal and to announce targets for money growth that, if 
achieved, would move toward that goal. Alas, there is no sign that the Federal 
Reserve is trying to achieve its targets. It continues to act as if there are 
only two speeds -- too fast and too slow. As long as that is true, stable 
prices will elude us.

UTILITY BLOCKING UNION EFFORT TO GAIN MEMBERSHIP ON BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the letter from Pacific Enterprises Chief Executive Paul A. Miller 
("Southern California Gas Co. Is Proud of Stock Ownership Plan for Workers," 
April 23): 
</P>
<P>
Miller's response to Harry Bernstein's April 18 column ("Utility Resists Adding 
Union Official to Firm's Directors") is a masterpiece of misleading 
information. He claims that I have been offered the shareholders list in the 
drive to get representation for the thousands of shareholders (many of them 
unions workers at Southern California Gas) who are unhappy with both the 
performance of Pacific Enterprises stock and the state of labor relations at 
its gas company subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific offered us the list excluding all participants in the employee stock 
ownership plans -- more than 20% of the list. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific's refusal was absolute until a Superior Court judge ordered the company 
to provide us with a list of participants who don't object. And access to the 
list has been made prohibitively expensive. To get the full list, our 
shareholders action committee must pay more than $15,000 over and above what 
Pacific has cost us in legal fees to get a judge to make a ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's concern about privacy might be more understandable if he were 
concerned about everyone's privacy. But he seems only concerned about the 
privacy of the 20% of shareholders who are most likely to give us their vote. 
</P>
<P>
Unions at Southern California Gas Co. have united to support a union member for 
the board of directors, and we have a chance of winning. Miller has stated that 
he only wants people of the "highest caliber," clearly implying that union 
members are not. That suggests what he really thinks of the shareholders who 
are the gas company's employees. 
</P>
<P>
As Bernstein pointed out, it is commonplace for European companies to have 
worker representatives on their boards, and employee stock ownership plans are 
growing rapidly. While it appears that Miller intends to retire in the near 
future, he and his successors are likely to face the apparently unnerving 
prospect of having to share power and the board room with people who have 
actually worked for the gas company.

SPEAKING OUT: EVERYBODY IS AN EXPERT EXCEPT FOR ME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY COWLE, Jerry Cowle is a Pacific Palisades homeowner. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I used to think I knew a few things. Always managed to earn a good living for 
my family. Sometimes I even finish a crossword puzzle, providing it isn't too 
hard. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, a man has to get accustomed to accepting constructive criticism 
-- from fellow workers, superiors and customers. Keeps you from getting too 
self-satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
But certain things have been happening lately that make me wonder if perhaps I 
shouldn't have tried a career other than business. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, I was engaged in the many transactions that accompany buying and 
moving into a new house. And I found out that there are an awful lot of experts 
around these days. They charge top dollar, which is to be expected. But they 
get a little extra fringe benefit too: the chance to lord it over me, tell me 
things I've never known before. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I'm quite willing to concede that my lawyer is an expert. He studied long 
enough to be one. So let's bypass him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blue-Collar Experts 
</P>
<P>
My real estate agent knows her job too. But when she says, "Let's check the 
CC&amp;Rs," I have to ask her what she means. She looks at me strangely and 
says, "covenants, conditions and restrictions" as if any idiot should have 
known that. 
</P>
<P>
But then come the blue-collar experts and they really rub it in. 
</P>
<P>
The movers are the first experts I have to contend with. 
</P>
<P>
"What size truck will we need?" he asks over the phone, as if I ought to able 
to the calculate cubic volume of my possessions. 
</P>
<P>
On moving day, they tell me that people who move a lot don't fool around with 
such-and-such type of bed frame because it's so hard to take apart. 
</P>
<P>
"OK," I say humbly. "Next time we buy a bedroom set, we'll make sure it's easy 
to take apart. After all, looks are secondary." 
</P>
<P>
At our new house, the foreman says, "Have you decided where you're going to put 
the extra mattress?" 
</P>
<P>
"In the garage, I guess. That's where we kept it at all our other houses," I 
said. "Why?" 
</P>
<P>
He scratched his head. "Well . . . I suppose it isn't any of my business, but 
we go through this everyday. You store a mattress flat, and it sags. If it was 
my mattress, I'd rest it on its side." 
</P>
<P>
Stupid of me, of course. "All right," I said, "you're the doctor." 
</P>
<P>
My dull-wittedness carried over to the moment of truth, when he presented me 
with my bill. I noted the quitting time listed. "But it isn't 4 o'clock yet," I 
protested. "In fact, it's only 3:30." 
</P>
<P>
"But we aren't back at the warehouse yet, are we?" he said, winking 
indulgently. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proper Door Hanging 
</P>
<P>
My next ordeal was with the carpentry expert, a man with all the earmarks of a 
laconic New England Yankee. Until he opened his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
"I need weather stripping on this door," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, sir," he said, scratching his head. (Have you noticed how often these 
experts scratch their heads?) "I don't believe in weather stripping. No, sir. 
If a door is hung properly, there's no need for weather stripping. Why, one 
time when I. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
At $30 an hour, who needs anecdotes? "OK," I interrupted, "never mind the 
weather stripping. Just make the door as airtight as you can." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, that's just what we'll do then," he said cautiously. "Of course, we 
might find a striker plate problem and maybe a little warping. But we'll take 
it off and then we'll see. OK?" 
</P>
<P>
"OK," I said, trying to fade away so he could work in peace. 
</P>
<P>
"Better stick around and see what's wrong when I get it off," he said, plucking 
at my sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
So I was coerced into becoming an admiring audience of one as yet another 
expert went into his mumbo-jumbo routine. 
</P>
<P>
On his heels came the plumber, an expert if I've ever heard one. "What's wrong 
with this furnace?" I asked. "It makes a lot of noise." 
</P>
<P>
"Let me tell you about these forced-air gas furnaces," he said, leaning against 
the wall. "You get a furnace put in -- a brand-new furnace -- and you think 
you're set for a while. Right?" 
</P>
<P>
I nodded in agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"But," he said, pausing for effect, "it doesn't always work out that way. Why, 
take for instance. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
So I got a long lecture on furnaces and water heaters. If I ever decide to go 
into the plumbing and heating business, I'll have a head start on becoming an 
expert myself. 
</P>
<P>
Next we needed a gas lighter capped, so the gas company expert came out. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell you something," he said confidentially. "Lots of folks think there's a 
gas leak just because they smell gas. But I go on calls every day, and half the 
time it's just their imagination. Why, you never would believe it, but. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
And for the next 10 minutes, I was regaled with story after story of his 
adventures in the wonderful world of natural gas. The only saving grace was 
that the gas company doesn't charge for service calls. 
</P>
<P>
Next came the exterminator, in answer to our SOS on mouse droppings. And there 
are no experts who are more so than these guys. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell you what happens," he said. "Ol' Mister Mouse comes up, tracks his paws 
in this here pink powder and then licks 'em clean. He gets thirsty, so he goes 
outside to find water. As soon as he drinks it, he's a goner." 
</P>
<P>
"Suppose he finds water inside?" I asked in all innocence. 
</P>
<P>
"Didn't I tell you? He's not supposed to. You're going to have to check all the 
water leaks too." 
</P>
<P>
"Stupid of me," I mumbled. 
</P>
<P>
"I been in this business for 12 years," he said, "working all over this area. I 
know every pest, and how to get rid of him. You just relax, and we'll fix this 
up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Becoming Straight Man 
</P>
<P>
But he wanted me around while he did the fixing. Did he need me? Perhaps as an 
audience. I'm getting to be a great straight man. "No kidding?" and "Really?" 
when spoken with the proper deference can get you a lot of extra information 
from these experts. 
</P>
<P>
Then just about the time I was starting to regain my self-confidence, we had to 
call the pool maintenance man to help us get started on the right foot. Now, 
these fellows are really experts. 
</P>
<P>
"Hmmm, this water looks a bit hard," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"What does that mean?" I ask nervously, expecting the worst. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't disappoint me. "We may have to drain," he said. It was in the same 
tone of voice my doctor might have used for "We may have to operate." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, well, if we do, we do," I said casually. "What's little extra water on my 
bill?" 
</P>
<P>
"But that's only the half of it," he said. "If it turns out you have scaling, 
you may need an acid bath." 
</P>
<P>
Sounded more like a gangland torture, but I went along with it. After all, he's 
the expert. 
</P>
<P>
No sooner did he leave, than in walked another expert we had to summon to our 
aid. The specialist on automatic garage door openers. 
</P>
<P>
"Hmmm," he said, "you sure got an unusual one here." He looked over our 
contraption, all the while shaking his head. To his credit, he never once 
scratched his head. 
</P>
<P>
"It figures," I said wearily, reaching for my checkbook. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, if it was a modern kind," he said apologetically, "it could take a 
portable triggering unit. That way, one unit works in either car. Can't do it 
in this one, it being a discontinued model." 
</P>
<P>
Then I made the mistake of saying, casually, "I never knew there was so much to 
learn about garage door openers." 
</P>
<P>
"Well," he said, brightening considerably, "I've been installing them for 
more'n 12 years, and you'd be amazed at some of the things I've seen. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Even the bottled water man has a store of bottled water folklore that would 
amaze you. The postman can entertain you with anecdotes of how he managed to 
jam a Sears catalogue into a slot only 4 inches wide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nod and Take Notes 
</P>
<P>
The electrician will shake his head and commiserate with you on the inadequate 
wiring in your home, which naturally was built before the advent of inexpensive 
air conditioners. The home cleaning service will show you why you've been using 
the wrong floor cleaner, the wrong wax, the wrong detergent all these years. 
</P>
<P>
The simplest thing to do is just nod your head and take notes. This way, you'll 
learn how to make a career out of home upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone know of a good trade school that takes broken-down businessmen and turns 
them into experts? What kind of experts? I don't much care. Just some simple 
little job where I can have the floor and tell someone else something he or she 
didn't know before. 
</P>
<P>
The words, "You don't say!" would be music to my ears.

REDISCOVERING AMERICA'S VALUES BY FRANCES MOORE LAPPE (BALLANTINE: $22.50; 352 
PP.; 345-32040-9) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Walter Russell Mead, Mead is the author of Mortal Splendor: The American 
Empire in Transition (Houghton Miffln). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At times of great religious or ideological change, when two contending world 
views threaten to tear civilization apart, concerned intellectuals have tried 
to frame the issues as clearly as possible in dialogues, literary discussions 
between two imaginary speakers on opposite sides of the chief controversies of 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
This is what Frances Lappe, author of "Diet for a Small Planet," has tried to 
do in her new and unusual book, "Rediscovering America's Values." She quite 
rightly sees that the debate between two related but conflicting philosophies 
-- liberal and conservative -- lies at the heart of contemporary American life 
and hopes to clarify the issues while advancing her own preference for what we 
might call the post-liberal option: not the centralized system of 20th-Century 
socialisms but a decentralized, communitarian alternative that has roots in 
American radicalism and affinities with the "small is beautiful" movement. 
</P>
<P>
Often, though not always, Lappe succeeds in clarifying, if not reconciling, the 
differences between these rival voices in American life. Unlike many left-wing 
critics, she both understands and is prepared to discuss the passionate 
commitment to freedom which lies behind the opposition of many on the right to 
the welfare state. To recognize the insight contained in an opposing point of 
view is one of the hardest things to do, and the mark of a generous mind; Lappe 
succeeds brilliantly in this difficult task. 
</P>
<P>
Over the course of this book, unlike any other you are likely to see anytime 
soon, the two voices conduct a running argument over subjects as diverse as 
welfare, defense policy, employee ownership, affirmative action and the minimum 
wage. In a pyrotechnic exhibition of erudition the arguments of both sides are 
supported by statistics and by citations from philosophers, economists and 
statesmen who have grappled with these questions through the ages. For much of 
the book, both liberals and conservatives will feel that Lappe has succeeded in 
presenting their views fairly and completely. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone will agree that she has succeeded everywhere, and total success is 
ruled out by the dialogue form, which limits to two the number of views that 
can be aired on any one subject. This can sometimes cause problems. Differences 
among conservatives, for example, are wide and deep; some conservatives are 
libertarians who want to see the state out of the bedroom as well as the 
boardroom; on foreign policy issues a substantial and possibly growing 
conservative minority would like to see the United States pull troops out of 
Europe and confine its military strategy to the defense of the national 
territories. Given the dialogue form, only one conservative position can be 
expressed, and it is not always clear that Lappe has chosen the strongest 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Lappe's relentless fair-mindedness helps make this a remarkable and 
valuable resource for groups in churches and other organizations who are 
seeking common understandings and approaches to social problems. It will also 
help individual readers clarify their own personal values and one hopes that it 
will be widely used in college programs on current affairs. 
</P>
<P>
A running dialogue between two unnamed speakers on a variety of political 
topics may not seem like the most entertaining read on offer today, and this is 
certainly not a book to be swallowed in a single sitting. But the questions the 
book addresses are so important, and Lappe manages to engage us so thoroughly 
in the unfolding argument, that we get involved in the running debate. We cheer 
and hiss as different points of view are put forward; at times one wants to 
throw the book across the room in frustration; at times one wants to cheer 
Lappe's ability to reduce the conflict of our time into a clear outline. 
</P>
<P>
But since debates over values will never be settled, the argument over them in 
Lappe's book sometimes gets stuck. The topic may change from chapter to 
chapter, but the underlying debate is the same all through the book. As a 
result, the book lacks a dramatic quality of moving toward a conclusion and 
sometimes sinks into a stale reiteration of old arguments on both sides 
</P>
<P>
As a child, Lappe would listen to her parents and their friends debating the 
issues of the day in their Texas kitchen and in their church groups. She pays 
tribute to the work of Robert Bellah and the co-authors of "Habits of the 
Heart" in exploring the connections, or lack of them, between the religious and 
political values that shape American life. Yet there is very little explicit 
discussion of religion in "Rediscovering America's Values." 
</P>
<P>
The relative absence of religion from a book about values reflects the extreme 
difficulty of the task Lappe set for herself. "America's Values" grow out of a 
large number of sometimes contradictory religious and philosophical movements. 
The debate over our values is not so much a dialogue as a deluge of voices, and 
Lappe's effort to bring order out of this Tower of Babel necessarily 
oversimplifies and sometimes misleads. 
</P>
<P>
However, these difficulties do not detract from the real accomplishments of 
this book. Indeed, if more Americans had Lappe's willingness to subject her 
deepest moral and political convictions to such searching scrutiny, we would be 
a less divided, more moderate, less ideological and more thoughtful nation. 
Unusual, original, provocative, sometimes exasperating, always striking, 
"Rediscovering America's Values" deserves a wide and attentive audience. 
</P>
<P>
You can't blame poverty on crime when crime rates didn't rise, and might even 
have fallen, when poverty was much more widespread -- during the Great 
Depression. Rising crime rates reflect a shift in social mores, the breakup of 
the family, and the decline in the role of religion. They reflect an embrace of 
self-expression as a value in itself, further eroding self-discipline. And high 
crime rates also result from a law enforcement pattern that encourages 
lawbreakers by making penalties so weak that, in effect, crime does pay. 
</P>
<P>
But violent crime rates in America are several times higher than in other 
industrial countries, despite much harsher anti-crime attitudes and more severe 
punishment here. Crime is linked to the deprivation of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Poverty's cost to society can also be measured in the loss of potential 
wealth. Each class of high school dropouts represents roughly $240 billion in 
lost earnings and tax revenues alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in a five-fold increase Headstart could be covered by reinstating only a 
fraction of the $60 billion lost in the 1980s tax cuts for the rich. 
</P>
<P>
 Iknew you would answer by increasing our taxes! Tell me, if your defense of a 
burgeoning welfare state held water, why are so many people in Western 
industrial countries revolting against it? Why? Because most people know that 
at least half of what the federal government spends is wasted. From Margaret 
Thatcher's England to the Scandinavian countries, by the Eighties the majority 
of voters had begun to challenge cradle-to-grave welfarism. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Western Europeans are seeking more efficient ways to continue or 
extend the protections they have achieved. Almost two-thirds of Britons said in 
the mid-Eighties that government services should be extended, even if it meant 
higher taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The sad irony is that a blind distrust of government leads to heavier public 
spending; for even when we (Americans) do establish public provision, we let 
private interests call the tune. Example: In the U.S., the public covers about 
half of all medical costs, but we allow the businesses providing the care to 
maximize profits by maximizing costs charged to the government. So the public 
gets had; government outlays for Medicare have doubled in less than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Any such problems, of course, would never arise if we kept government out of 
the picture.

FEEDING THE RAT Profile of a Climber by A. Alvarez (Atlantic Monthly Press: 
$17.95; 152 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
The compulsion to go climb a rock is inexplicable to those of us who shudder 
while simply reading about the experiences the author finds so thrilling: 
climbing straight "up a vertical wall," for instance, "with nothing but air and 
the wheeling swallows between my feet and the scree far below." Mountaineering 
mostly seems to be hard work: a struggle against gravity in unforgiving terrain 
offering none of the rewards of most wilderness adventures, such as the 
rollicking thrill of white-water rafting, or the primal mystery of deep-sea 
diving. 
</P>
<P>
A. Alvarez doesn't entirely demystify the mountaineer's motivations in these 
rousing, sensitive and evocative pages, but "Feeding the Rat" is unquestionably 
one up on the traditional explanation, "Because it's there." A British writer 
("The Savage God") and poet whose books on gamblers, roustabouts, paranoiacs 
and divorcees have painted him as a hagiographer of people living on all sorts 
of edges, Alvarez devotes most of these pages to profiling his friend, Mo 
Anthoine, a professional mountaineer. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez met Anthoine in 1964, after Anthoine had left his stepmother, a 
"Dickensian tyrant," to join a 1960s community of other young English rebels in 
a small Welsh town, "all of them self-made internal exiles, like Russian 
dissidents, who had gone there to climb and then stayed on, taking odd jobs to 
keep themselves fed." Anthoine's goal was to keep the jobs as odd as possible, 
for he feared that the workaday world would ruin his "feeling for climbing." 
And indeed, as Alvarez presents it here, climbing emerges as a metaphor for all 
types of escape from a predominately drab ethos. 
</P>
<P>
Towns often appear as "dank," "dingy," and "mournful," but in rebels such as 
Anthoine, Alvarez finds a colorful individual, his character brightened by 
continual striving for the better. "If you just tootle along you can think 
you're a pretty slick bloke until things go wrong and you find you're nothing 
like what you imagined yourself to be," Anthoine says. "But if you deliberately 
put yourself in difficult situations, then you get a pretty good idea of how 
you are going." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
UNFRIENDLY SKIES Reflections of a Deregulated Airline Pilot by Captain "X" and 
Reynolds Dobson (Doubleday: $18.95; 236 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
While the name suggests a character in a Buck Rogers' space opera, "Captain X" 
is in fact a senior captain at a major American airline who felt obliged to use 
a pseudonym, as journalist Reynolds Dobson writes, to avoid the "disciplinary 
action" that is mandatory for any licensed air transport pilot who admits an 
error, "no matter how ancient, no matter how unavoidable." 
</P>
<P>
Our captain's anonymity has its drawbacks, encouraging him to play a bit too 
easily with the facts: He alludes to a recent survey where "a majority of 
commercial pilots" said their planes were "less airworthy" than in recent 
years, but doesn't cite the survey or offer any details about it. The pseudonym 
also encourages an emotional honesty that might trouble those of us who prefer 
to see him as a fatherly captain to whom we are entrusting our fate: "Captain 
X" views some flight attendants as sex objects, for instance (registering 
disappointment when they "slam their (hotel room) door and, click, shove the 
bolt behind them"), and admits that "when there's word of an air disaster (and) 
. . . it's your line that's involved . . . the feeling is electric. . . . The 
crash of that Eastern (jet) would create some seniority advancements, for the 
pilot and his crew were all killed by the impact." 
</P>
<P>
There is at least some compunction behind these words, though, and they do not, 
of course, invalidate what he has to say about deregulation, a 1978 act that 
ended price restrictions, opened all markets to all domestic carriers and 
sanctioned buyouts and mergers of route structures. By allowing massive mergers 
such as the Texas Air binge (which added 177 new cities to the company's route 
structure and shifted about 8,000 pilots), deregulation has forced captains to 
fly unfamiliar routes with unfamiliar flight crews. "It was not unusual for a 
pilot from one airline to be teamed with a co-pilot from another," Captain X 
writes, "and the two of them sent off to some hell-and-gone airport neither one 
of them had ever seen before. That's a formula for disaster." And indeed, since 
1982, there have been almost 4,000 near-collisions, with the '87 figure more 
than double that of 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Much of "Unfriendly Skies" is cursory, not discussing the dangers of the new 
"hub-and-spoke" system of controlling traffic, for example (it requires 
additional take-offs and landings, thus heightening the chance for an 
accident). Captain X does target a host of other problems, though, and advocate 
some promising solutions, such as computers that can prevent the crew's 
attention from waning on the new super-automated planes; these computers can 
"act like gadflies," he writes, "asking pilots questions that the pilots must 
answer so that the machine will be satisfied that it's got a mentally alert 
companion flying with it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BYZANTIUM by John Julius Norwich (Alfred A. Knopf: $29.95; 408 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
John Julius Norwich sheds a lurid light on the Dark Ages in these pages, 
evoking the superficial spectacle of Byzantine wealth as well as the underlying 
political dreams, machinations, and palace vice. Though sometimes verging on 
"Life-styles of the Medieval Rich and Famous," "Byzantium" is generally an 
engaging account of a period that few of us are likely to have studied in 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Norwich envisions history as an art, selecting only those details that will 
enhance the drama of his narrative, rather than as a science, where 
cause-and-effect is objectively determined. These pages illustrate the dangers 
of taking that philosophy too far, however, for by emphasizing the human drama 
he thinks will interest us the most, Norwich overlooks the social, cultural and 
economic movements that gave form and direction to the Middle Ages. Norwich 
doesn't explore, for instance, the implications of declining urbanization in 
the 6th and 7th centuries (it frustrated intellectual advancements in the 8th 
Century) or of the shift in spiritual allegiance from Roman deities to a single 
Christian God (it introduced the concept of "Orthodoxy" to the world). Thus, 
it's no surprise that Norwich is often mystified by the Byzantine people's 
behavior. "That a plebeian mob," he writes at one point, "should be inflamed to 
fury not by political slogans but by such questions as the relation of the 
Father to the Son or the Procession of the Holy Ghost puts a great strain on 
our understanding, but is true none the less." 
</P>
<P>
His treatment of the Muslims is similarly dismissive. "Insofar as anyone knew 
anything about them, they were presumed to be little better than savages . . . 
making not the slightest attempts toward unity or even stable government." 
Then, Norwich writes, "in the twinkling of an eye, all was changed" as the 
Arabs expelled the Byzantine army from Syria in AD 636. Armies organized "in 
the twinkling of an eye" rarely overthrow empires, of course, and this case is 
no exception: Prior to 636, the Arabs had, in fact, developed culture as well 
as political unity. Many lyric odes about the nature and power of God, for 
example, had been composed by Muslims from the 4th Century to the 7th Century. 
</P>
<P>
It is somewhat ironic that Norwich's account should depart from the notion that 
the past exists to enlighten the present, for the Middle Ages themselves were 
darkened by a similar departure. Norwich never claims to be a scholar, though, 
and so this work remains compelling, if not enlightening, for its lively 
enthusiasm and curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RELIGIOUS CHANGE IN AMERICA by Andrew M. Greeley (Harvard University Press: 
$25; 128 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
The rather bizarre premise of this book -- using something as secular and 
scientific as government and university public-opinion polls to illuminate 
something as ethereal as spirituality -- seems particularly striking in 
"objective" charts such as "Figure 9.1: Model for explaining contact with the 
dead among widowed." Andrew Greeley knows that social science has its limits, 
though: "There are no social indicators," he writes, "which can be used to 
measure" the changing impact religious doctrines have on people's daily lives. 
Greeley does argue persuasively that changes in the practice of religion can be 
measured, however, discrediting the predictions of many social scientists that 
America is rapidly becoming "secularized": "Rates of church attendance, prayer 
and belief in life after death have remained remarkably steady." 
</P>
<P>
Greeley, a novelist and sociologist at the University of Arizona, occasionally 
strays from his dispassionate style, offering ethnocentric interpretations: At 
one point, for example, he calls Americans "the best-educated and most 
modernized" people in the Western world and suggestively links this "fact" to 
the unusually high percentage of Americans who believe in an afterlife. 
"Religious Change in America" is a responsible and intriguing work on the 
whole, though, for Greeley reports many important trends with great clarity, 
such as the feeling that science is diminishing our spiritual awe: "It is, as 
the German Scripture scholar Rudolph Bultmann remarked, 'difficult to believe 
in the mystery of lightning when one can control electricity with the flick of 
a light switch.' "

A BIO-REALIST AMONG THE ARCHITECTS; 
</P>
<P>
NATURE NEAR; 
</P>
<P>
LATE ESSAYS OF RICHARD NEUTRA EDITED BY WILLIAM MARLIN (CAPRA: $18.95; 224 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sam Hall Kaplan, Kaplan, The Times' design critic, is the author of L.A. 
Lost &amp; Found (Crown) and most recently L.A. Follies (Southern California 
Books). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Neutra was one of the more prolific architects ever to practice in the 
Los Angeles area, producing in a career that spanned nearly half a century 
about 200 varied projects. He also was one of the more public, generating 
lectures, essays and drawings that have filled 11 books, "Nature Near" being 
the last. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that almost from the moment he arrived in Los Angeles in 1925, 
encouraged by fellow Austrian emigre architect R. M. Schindler, until he died 
in 1970 at age 77, Neutra was a self-appointed missionary of sorts for an 
enlightened modernism fashioned to serve man's physical and psychological 
needs. Heightening his zeal was the region's benign climate and youth. 
</P>
<P>
"The climate of California, at least in those halcyon days before the citrus 
groves and bean fields were crowded out by freeways, parking lots and 
subdivisions, was conducive to the germination of a fundamentally fresh form of 
architectural growth," he recalls in one of the essays. "I saw that buildings 
agleam with the materials of our own time might fraternize with the soil and 
the psyche of this unspoiled region." 
</P>
<P>
The resulting range of buildings he designed were very much in the machinelike 
International Style, with an emphasis on clean lines and an expressive 
structural system, responding to both interior and exterior spaces. His 
writings exploring the role of the biological and behavorial sciences in the 
art of architecture were a bit more Baroque. No doubt this reflects Neutra's 
early schooling in the humanities in an imperial Vienna at the turn of the 
century that included six years of Greek and eight years of Latin. 
</P>
<P>
Writing style aside, Neutra's theories, which he labeled "biorealism," 
constituted a refreshing approach to design in a profession then, and now, 
often preoccupied by the way things look rather than the way things work. As 
William Marlow notes in the introduction, "Neutra was really the first 
architect of any enduring consequence to think systemically and comprehensively 
about the intimate relationship of the biological and behavioral sciences to 
architectural and planning issues." For this reason alone, he deserve our 
attention, and respect. 
</P>
<P>
Just as many of Neutra's designs appear to have been a variation on a theme, so 
were his writings. His arguments for a more user- and site-sensitive design 
were well stated in his definitive "Survival Through Design," (first published 
by Oxford University Press in 1954, and in subsequent paper editions by the 
Institute for Survival Press), clearly explained and illustrated in Thomas 
Hines' "Richard Neutra and the Search for Modern Architecture." (Oxford, 1982), 
and made more personal, in "Richard Neutra: Promise and Fulfillment, 1919-1932" 
(Southern Illinois Press, 1986). 
</P>
<P>
Still, in these last essays culled from a rich archive of writings Neutra 
offers a clearer vision of his humanistic design theories; certainly a more 
compelling personal one. It seems that knowing his career, and life, were soon 
to end, Neutra wanted to make sure his reasoning for a more humane and 
harmonious man-made environment would be heard. "By way of my beliefs as well 
as buildings, I have worked to leave behind a guiding trail of experience, 
insights, and -- yes -- passion, hoping this will deepen the values and raise 
the sights of those coming along," he declares in the last essay in the book. 
</P>
<P>
As such, it would have been helpful to know exactly when these essays were 
written -- none is dated -- and the rationale behind their organization. Neutra 
the architect, ever concerned with details, no doubt would have wanted it that 
way, and more, striving as he did in his work for perfection, however 
impossible to achieve in the social art of architecture. 
</P>
<P>
The book also presumptuously assumes a knowledge of Neutra's work. Some 
biographical material to put his essays into a broader perspective would have 
been helpful, such as his education at first as a humanist, then as an 
architect, his apprenticeship under Frank Lloyd Wright, among others, his 
partnership with Schindler, and some of his more challenging commissions where 
he tried to put his theories to test.

FRESH OIL SHEEN SEEPS FROM EXXON VALDEZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Valdez, Alaska, the Coast Guard confirmed Saturday that a fresh oil sheen 
has seeped from the ruptured Exxon Valdez and that a complete cleanup of the 
damaged tanker is impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day in Juneau, a package of bills aimed at protecting Alaska from 
another devastating oil spill like the one that fouled Prince William Sound was 
passed by the state Senate with little trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"Oil is clinging to the tanks inside," said Vice Adm. Clyde Robbins, the 
federal on-the-scene coordinator. "What we're getting is that clinging oil 
mixed with water that causes sheen. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, it's impossible to completely remove the oil unless you 
steam-clean the tanker, and nobody intends to do that," Robbins said.

He said he doubted the vessel, which is undergoing temporary repairs 30 miles 
from the March 24 site where the Exxon Valdez ruptured on a reef, will be moved 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm estimating at least a month to six weeks," he said. "Obviously, this

going to a foreign port."

Reacting to the largest oil spill in the nation's history, the Republican-led 
Senate acted with unusual speed to move the six bills through the chamber and 
to the House.

However, it appeared unlikely that the Democrat-controlled House would approve

The Senate bills would increase civil fines for spill damage; impose a 
surcharge on oil producers to boost the state's spill-response fund; prevent

ABORTION APPEAL RENEWS LONGSTANDING DEBATE ON CONSTITUTION'S IMPLIED RIGHTS 
</P>

<P>
The Bush Administration's direct attack Wednesday on the constitutional right 
to abortion forces the Supreme Court to reconsider one of the most difficult 
areas of legal theory: Does the Constitution give Americans rights that it does 
not spell out? 
</P>
<P>
It is this issue that squarely separates the Supreme Court's conservative and 
liberal factions. It is also the issue that helped to sink the Supreme Court 
nomination of Judge Robert H. Bork, who maintained in Senate hearings that 
millions of Americans watched on television, that there is no constitutional 
"right to privacy" because the Constitution does not contain those words. 
</P>
<P>
The issue looms large in the Missouri case currently before the court that 
could determine whether the 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling that established an 
implied right to abortion will be overturned or scaled back. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conservatives' View 
</P>
<P>
Conservative jurists such as Bork and Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist long 
have said that the Constitution requires courts to protect explicitly provided, 
written rights such as "freedom of speech," but nothing more. Other matters 
should be left to the decisions of elected government bodies, they have 
maintained. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, liberals such as 83-year-old Justice William J. Brennan Jr. 
maintain that the Constitution obliges the court to go beyond its narrow words 
to protect "overarching principles" of human freedom and dignity. 
</P>
<P>
Over the 33 years of Brennan's tenure, the high court has declared that 
Americans have a number of fundamental rights not spelled out in the 
Constitution, including a right to marry, a freedom to associate with whom one 
pleases, a right to privacy, a right to "bear a child . . . without 
governmental intrusion," and most controversially, the right to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Charles Fried, a conservative Harvard law professor representing 
the Bush Administration's position in the Missouri case, urged the court to 
overrule the abortion right -- while upholding all the rest. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not asking the court to unravel the fabric of unenumerated and privacy 
rights which this court has woven in cases" dating back 50 years, Fried said. 
"Rather, we are asking the court to pull this one thread." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Call Approach Smart 
</P>
<P>
Legal experts said Thursday that Fried's approach was a smart one, even if it 
proved troublesome for some of the justices. 
</P>
<P>
"Tactically, it was a necessary move for him," said University of Chicago Law 
School Dean Geoffrey R. Stone. "If there is one lesson of the Bork hearings, it 
is that Americans believe they have a right to privacy, even if it isn't 
spelled out in the Constitution." Nevertheless, Fried's argument quickly raised 
the eyebrows of Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Sandra Day O'Connor, considered 
key swing votes on the abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
Both pressed Fried during his oral argument on how it could be that the 
Constitution includes a "marital right to privacy" and the "right to bear or 
beget a child . . . without governmental intrusion," but nothing about whether 
or not a woman has a right to terminate her pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you say there is no fundamental right to decide whether to have a child or 
not?" O'Connor asked. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, who joined the court last year and has yet to vote in an abortion 
case, also seemed troubled by how the justices can draw a line between the 
"right to procreation" in a birth control case and the right to choose abortion 
in Roe vs. Wade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hard to Draw Line 
</P>
<P>
"It's a hard line to draw," said Stone. "I don't see a principled way to 
distinguish the right in those two situations." 
</P>
<P>
Harvard law professor Frank Michelman agreed. "Once you say there is a 
fundamental right to procreational choice, it would seem apparent that a woman 
also has a fundamental right to choose whether or not to go ahead with her 
pregnancy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But both constitutional law experts pointed out that the state's interest -- 
the other side of the equation in any constitutional case -- is much different 
in the birth control and abortion cases. 
</P>
<P>
States can argue, as Fried did Wednesday, that "abortion is different" because 
the life of an unborn child is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
"Depending on how the court weighs the state's interest, you can say there is a 
huge difference between (the birth control case) and Roe," Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Justices Differ 
</P>
<P>
In past abortion cases, the court's conservatives have enunciated two views. 
Rehnquist and Byron R. White said that there is no right to an abortion, so Roe 
vs. Wade should be overruled. O'Connor has suggested that a woman does have a 
right to choose abortion in some circumstances but has said that the state also 
has a "compelling interest" in protecting fetal life. She has not spelled out 
at what point a state's interest in fetal life would permit it to override the 
woman's right to choose an abortion, but her writings suggest that she has a 
different view of the matter than Rehnquist or White. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the justices voted behind closed doors on the Missouri case and 
prepared to draft opinions. If Rehnquist got four other votes to uphold the 
state law, he decided who writes the court opinion and what it says. 
</P>
<P>
But the conservative majority could split into factions based on their past 
approaches. Several of them, such as White, Rehnquist and Antonin Scalia, may 
favor a broad ruling overturning Roe vs. Wade entirely, legal analysts say. 
Others, including O'Connor and perhaps Kennedy, may favor a narrower opinion 
that upholds the Missouri law -- which bans the use of public funds or 
facilities for abortions -- but says nothing about the underlying right to 
abortion in Roe. 
</P>
<P>
"We may end with more than one opinion," said Michelman. Even if the Missouri 
law is reinstated, it may not produce a clear court precedent.

In an emotional outpouring of support, hundreds of letters and donations are 
streaming into a private fund set up for the families of the 47 sailors who 
were killed in the April 19 explosion aboard the battleship Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
The cards and letters come primarily from the southeastern Virginia area, near 
the Norfolk Naval Base, the Iowa's home port. However, letters have come from 
as far away as New York, Michigan and California. 
</P>
<P>
The often-poignant letters range from a message sent by a high-ranking Pentagon 
official to handwritten cards from elementary schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
"USS Iowa -- America remembers," reads a colorful card by a first-grader from 
Lakes Elementary School in Hartland, Mich. The card includes the drawing of a 
ship. 
</P>
<P>
The USS Iowa Fund was set up less than 24 hours after the Navy had announced 
that the sailors had been killed in a fiery explosion in the battleship's No. 2 
gun turret. 
</P>
<P>
As of last Friday, the fund had received more than $42,500.

A swamp fire in the Osceola National Forest grew to 8,200 acres Saturday, 
dimming firefighters' hopes of containing the flames by tonight. 
</P>
<P>
More than 140 firefighters battled the blaze, using a tanker plane and 
helicopters to dump water on hot spots, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, which began Tuesday, did not threaten any buildings, and no injuries 
were reported. The flames burned within half a mile of Florida Highway 2, 
forcing authorities to close a five-mile stretch of the highway because of 
smoke.

INVISIBLE TOXIC EMISSIONS CAST A CLOUD OVER 'CLEAN' FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The collection of buildings on West Bernardo Drive is a showcase of clean 
industry: manicured lawns and freshly planted trees sweep up to angular 
structures where hundreds of workers assemble television parts and electronic 
circuitry. 
</P>
<P>
There are no clouds of menacing black smoke coming from the factory stacks of 
Unisys, Sony, Northern Telecom and Hewlett-Packard, all situated a mile up the 
hill from a major housing development, gasoline stations and several new 
hotels. 
</P>
<P>
But the suburban scene doesn't mean these high-tech factories west of 
Interstate 15 are pollution-free. In fact, recently released government figures 
show that the four companies released nearly 50,000 pounds -- about 25 tons -- 
of colorless toxic substances into the air in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Figures Compiled Nationwide 
</P>
<P>
And they are far from the worst. In all, the county's largest manufacturers 
spewed 2,519 to 2,534 tons of toxics and carcinogens into San Diego skies 
during 1987, according to the figures, released under a new federal 
Environmental Protection Agency program. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego numbers were among those compiled by the EPA nationwide to 
determine how much toxic material industry is dumping into the air, water and 
land. Under the federal community "right to know" law, the nation's largest 
manufacturing plants were required to report their emissions beginning in 1987, 
with smaller firms to be phased in later. 
</P>
<P>
The first compilation of figures, made public last month, reveals that industry 
dumped nearly 112.5 million tons of toxics into the environment nationwide, an 
amount three times greater than first thought. Although cautious to draw 
conclusions from the raw numbers, EPA officials said the figures are "startling 
and unacceptably high." 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego County, environmental activists were just as critical of the 
amounts and types of substances released. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at the numbers realistically, you can't come to a conclusion that 
industry is being a responsible San Diego citizen," said Ted Nordhaus, who 
directs a local toxic-use reduction campaign for CalPIRG, a statewide 
environmental watchdog group. "They are exposing the community to tremendous 
health hazards. 
</P>
<P>
"Your fate ends up being determined on which way the wind is blowing, and that 
gets a little scary . . . " Nordhaus said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Substitutes Needed 
</P>
<P>
Diane Takvorian, executive director of the nonprofit Environmental Health 
Coalition, agreed, adding that the numbers show that the current governmental 
philosophy of "managing" potentially hazardous substances isn't working. The 
answer is to make industry find environmentally safe substitutes for toxic 
chemicals, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The reality is that we don't use them very safely," Takvorian said. "In fact, 
the rate of air pollution is not decreasing, it's increasing." 
</P>
<P>
But Bill Anderson, executive vice president of the Industrial Environmental 
Assn. of San Diego, said many of the San Diego companies reporting their 1987 
emissions are working to reduce the releases of toxic and environmentally 
damaging gases from their plants. 
</P>
<P>
He also said there is no proof that the toxic air emissions pose a public 
health hazard. 
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely safe," said Anderson, whose industrial trade group includes 
environmental officers from some of the companies reporting the greatest volume 
of toxic releases under the EPA program. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (the figures) should be reviewed, carefully evaluated with all the 
rules and regulations that we have, because we live in this community along 
with everyone else," he said. "And we are just as anxious to make sure that we 
live in a community that is free of adverse pollutants." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2.2 Pounds Per Person 
</P>
<P>
In all, EPA statistics show that 51 San Diego County companies, many of them 
near populated areas, reported at least 2,519 tons of toxic air pollution 
during 1987. The total amounted to about 2.2 pounds of airborne toxics for 
every man, woman and child in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that: 
</P>
<P>
* More than half the toxic releases, or 1,367 tons, were made up of three 
suspected carcinogens: methylene chloride, tetrachloroethylene and propylene 
oxide. Preliminary scientific screening indicates that the last two substances 
are suspected of causing, in addition to cancer, infertility and either genetic 
or birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
Two other compounds used as solvents in the high-tech industry made up another 
26% of the county's toxic air releases. Freon 113 and 1,1,1-trichloroethane are 
both known to deplete the Earth's ozone layer; the latter is suspected of 
causing infertility and birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
* Only 1,444 tons, or about 57%, of the air pollution came from industry 
smokestacks, traditionally the site where companies connect pollution-control 
devices. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the 1987 emissions, about 1,075 tons, or 43%, were classified as 
"fugitive," meaning they were released straight into the atmosphere through 
ventilation systems or evaporation. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, these are unanticipated and are uncontrolled and they don't know 
where they are going," Takvorian said of the fugitive releases. 
</P>
<P>
* Signet Armorlite, a San Marcos optical lens manufacturer, was the company 
with the highest toxic emissions during 1987. The company, in an industrial 
park a few blocks south of Palomar College, dumped nearly 450 tons of toxics 
into the air, the EPA figures show. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the company's emissions consisted of the suspected carcinogen 
methylene chloride, which is used to clean the lenses for inspection. Company 
President Richard Ormsby said this week that his company's use of the chemical, 
which is unregulated by local air pollution officials, is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
Caspian, a Kearny Mesa firm that chemically "mills" airplane parts, reported 
the second-highest amount of emissions, with 417 tons. Most of that was 
carcinogenic tetrachloroethylene, which the company uses in a process to reduce 
the weight of the parts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's bad news, we admit to it," Caspian President Cyrus Jaffari said in an 
interview this week. 
</P>
<P>
Jaffari said the problem with emissions bothered him so much that he committed 
85% of the firm's net worth in a quest over the past two years to finding a 
substitute for solvent-based chemicals such as tetrachloroethylene, which is 
also used in the dry-cleaning business. 
</P>
<P>
The gamble has paid off, said Jaffari, and Caspian has found a way to use 
environmentally safe, water-based compounds to take the place of the toxic 
chemicals. The result: The company is expected to reduce its toxic emissions to 
only 1 1/2 tons, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to stay in this business, and we are dedicated to the proposition that 
it can be done without damaging the environment," Jaffari said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Installing New Scrubbers 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, officials of Kelco, in Logan Heights at the foot of the San 
Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge, are spending $2.5 million to install new scrubbers 
this summer to remove 90% of their emissions. EPA figures show that the 
kelp-processing plant was the No. 3 company for dumping toxics into the air, 
with a total of 344 tons. 
</P>
<P>
Most of that was propylene oxide, a substance Kelco uses to make food 
emulsifiers, said Don E. Conner, the company's manager of community and 
government affairs. The substance was also recently added to the state's list 
of suspected carcinogens. 
</P>
<P>
Conner said propylene oxide has been used by Kelco for 20 years and that the 
amount of the substance is "diluted" when it comes out of the company's 
smokestack. 
</P>
<P>
"In our experience with this, we are not aware of any type of chronic health 
problem with our workers or anybody else," Conner said. But he added that the 
new scrubbers should virtually eliminate any worry. 
</P>
<P>
On a smaller scale, in scenic Rancho Bernardo, a company spokesman for Unisys 
said his company's 1987 release of 3.6 tons of 1,1,1-trichloroethane translates 
into an amount well below the federal health standard of 350 parts per million 
for worker exposure. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time that is disbursed in the airstream and it goes a mile, you are 
going to be less than any 350 parts per million," said Gary Garrison, Unisys' 
manager for safety and the environment. "If you were standing up on our roof 
with your nose in our exhaust, you might get enough there to make you sick to 
your stomach." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Plans to Stop 
</P>
<P>
At Signet Armorlite, the county's biggest toxic emitter, Ormsby said his 
company will continue its heavy use of suspected carcinogenic methylene 
chloride unless the EPA and the county's Air Pollution Control District express 
concern over health hazards. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect the Air Pollution Control District to provide us that input if there 
is that type of concern," Ormsby said. "In the case of methylene chloride . . . 
we have never heard that concern expressed. 
</P>
<P>
"We report our usage to the APCD and the EPA yearly," he said. "We never have 
been cited for using this material, and it is a non-regulated solvent. Until 
this time, we have had no contact by any agency relative to its usage and vapor 
release." 
</P>
<P>
Dick Smith, the APCD's deputy director, said the agency has no reason to ask 
the company to reduce its emissions of the suspected carcinogen, although the 
state is developing regulations for the substance. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no real reason to believe they are creating a local health problem," 
Smith said, adding that the agency has not received complaints from the 
company's workers or of health problems in areas near Signet's San Marcos 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
But Takvorian, of the Environmental Health Coalition, said it would be foolish 
for the district to wait for health complaints before forcing Signet to curtail 
its emissions of the suspected carcinogen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Onus on Companies 
</P>
<P>
"Down the street, at Palomar (College), there's hundreds of thousands of young 
people who have been exposed to some concentration of this material," Takvorian 
said. "We probably won't know what the effects will have been. They are 
experimental guinea pigs . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Although Takvorian applauded companies like Caspian for voluntarily reducing 
the amount of toxic emissions by finding environmentally safe substitutes, she 
also said the recent EPA figures should put the onus on local companies to 
"prove that these chemicals are safe" for workers and those living near the 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to wait around for the health studies to prove that these people 
will get cancer or did get cancer. We want to protect them before they get 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to reverse the system," Takvorian said. "People are innocent until 
proven guilty. Chemicals are guilty until proven innocent."

THE DAY GEHRIG SAT DOWN; 
</P>
<P>
ON MAY 2, 1939, HIS CONSECUTIVE GAME STREAK ENDED 
</P>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On June 2, 1925, Wally Pipp had a headache and was replaced at first base in 
the New York Yankee lineup by a quiet hometown kid named Lou Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
It took 14 years, 2,130 games and an incurable illness to put Gehrig back on 
the bench. 
</P>
<P>
And when the Iron Horse took himself out of the lineup 50 years ago, on May 2, 
1939, he also moved out of the shadow of Babe Ruth and into baseball 
immortality. 
</P>
<P>
The shy son of German immigrants living on New York's East Side never captured 
the imagination of the public the way the flamboyant Ruth did, but when his 
remarkable consecutive-game streak ended he took with him numbers comparable to 
anyone who ever played the game: 
</P>
<P>
 -- 493 lifetime homers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1,990 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A .632 slugging percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A major-league record 23 grand slams. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Four home runs in a game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 1927, he hit .373 with 47 home runs and 175 runs batted in. He also had 
52 doubles, 18 triples, walked 109 times and scored 149 runs. Yet it was a 
season lost to Ruth's 60 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the 13 full seasons he played, Gehrig averaged 147 RBIs a season. Henry 
Aaron, Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle never drove in that many runs in a seeason 
even once. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In four seasons during the peak of his career he averaged only 37 
strikeouts a year. Reggie Jackson averaged 129 strikeouts a season for his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
But it is his 2,130 consecutive games played that is considered one of 
baseball's unbreakable records. The next best is the mark Gehrig broke -- 1,307 
straight games by Everett Scott, 823 games (more than five seasons) short of 
Gehrig's mark. 
</P>
<P>
If a rookie was to start a consecutive-game streak in 1989, he would have to 
play every game from now until early in the season of 2,002 to surpass Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1939, no one has even come close. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Garvey holds the National League record with 1,207 consecutive games from 
Sept. 3, 1975, to July 29, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Garvey retired after the 1987 season, but if he had kept the streak going in 
1983 and was playing today, he would still be a few games short. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone will ever break Lou Gehrig's record," Garvey said. "I 
know I played with a lot of nagging injuries to keep the streak alive and I 
didn't even get close." 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore shortstop Cal Ripken recently surpassed playing in 1,100 consecutive 
games. He would still need another six-plus seasons to reach Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not really something I'm thinking about," Ripken said. "I can't even 
imagine reaching that point. Hey, I'm surprised I've gotten this far. 
</P>
<P>
"I just play one game at a time." 
</P>
<P>
A star at Columbia University, Gehrig was scouted by Paul Krichell and signed 
with the Yankees when offered a $1,500 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
After two short stints with New York in 1923 and 1924, Gehrig started his 
streak on that June day in 1925 when Pipp, who had been the Yankees' first 
baseman since 1915, told Manager Miller Huggins he had a headache and asked to 
take the day off. 
</P>
<P>
Gehrig took over at first base, and stayed there for 15 years. He stayed 
through muscle pulls, broken bones, and yes, even a slump or two. 
</P>
<P>
Gehrig turned 35 in 1938 and his average slipped to .295 with 29 homers and 114 
RBIs. While million-dollar numbers by today's standards, it was far below his 
norm and provoked concern for Gehrig and the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Gehrig, whose top salary was $39,000, had a sluggish spring training in 1939 
and a routine play at Yankee Stadium in April told him something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
A ball was hit back to pitcher Johnny Murphy and Gehrig had trouble getting to 
the bag. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy told the Iron Horse, "nice play," but Gehrig knew it was nothing 
special. 
</P>
<P>
In his first 28 at-bats in 1939, Gehrig had four hits with no homers and one 
RBI. 
</P>
<P>
Gehrig knew something was wrong, he just didn't know what. 
</P>
<P>
May 1, 1939, was an off day and Gehrig spent some lonely hours in a Detroit 
hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Gehrig told Manager Joe McCarthy: "I'm taking myself out of the 
lineup." 
</P>
<P>
"I decided last Sunday night on this move," Gehrig said in announcing his 
decision to the press. "I haven't been a bit of good to the team since the 
season started. It would not be fair to the boys, to Joe or to the baseball 
public for me to try going on. In fact, it would not be fair to myself." 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy thought Gehrig just needed some much deserved time off and would be 
back soon. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him it would be as he wished," McCarthy said at the time. "Like 
everybody else I'm sorry to see it happen. I told him not to worry. Maybe the 
warm weather will bring him around." 
</P>
<P>
But the weather had nothing to do with Gehrig's problems. 
</P>
<P>
He visited the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, and it was discovered he had an 
incurable disease. He was diagnosed as having Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. 
But the world has come to know it as Lou Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
"I was there," said former Yankees broadcaster Mel Allen. "But sometimes it 
doesn't seem real now. There was a real Lou Gehrig. A guy who joked with his 
teammates and argued at bad calls. 
</P>
<P>
"But after his last game, he became a legend." 
</P>
<P>
Others have had great numbers, but few more impact on the game of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the first time I played first base at Yankee Stadium thinking I was 
in the same place Lou Gehrig played," first baseman Don Mattingly said. "It 
almost gave me chills." 
</P>
<P>
Yankee Stadium is the "House that Ruth Built," but as long as a team plays 
there, Gehrig will be the pride of the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Said Allen, "He's what made wearing a Yankee uniform special."

The Rev. Jim Friedrich moved there because it "was the only place that didn't 
seem to have this air of unreality about it, that was within a reasonable range 
of affordability." 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Hanks moved there from Fullerton with her husband and their then 
5-week-old baby because "the drive was a killer and the things we like to do 
were up there." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Johnsen "looked in all the normal places" and then moved there with his 
wife and daughter because "we fell in love with our house." 
</P>
<P>
"There" is Highland Park, an older community of rolling hills covered with 
distinctive single-family houses, halfway between downtown Los Angeles and 
Pasadena. The largely Latino area is undergoing re-gentrification, an influx of 
younger homeowners with higher income levels. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago, people wouldn't even get off the freeway to look at homes 
here," says Bill Raftery, a realtor with Uptown Properties. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, with the preservation movement -- there are some 30 historic register 
homes where once there were only five -- combined with the affordability and 
the need for people to move back into the city, we're getting a wave of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looked in Other Areas 
</P>
<P>
Friedrich, 44, is one of the new wave of residents transforming the once-sleepy 
community. An Episcopal priest at St. Augustine by-the-Sea in Santa Monica and 
president of Cathedral Films in Agoura, a religious media company, Friedrich 
looked in Topanga Canyon, Pasadena and Santa Monica before settling on top of a 
hilltop in Highland Park. 
</P>
<P>
A renter in Studio City for the past 16 years, Friedrich paid "something over 
$250,000" for his first home, a 2,200-square-foot house built in 1905 that only 
needed light detail work. 
</P>
<P>
"My street has stability and residential stillness, the block is kind of an 
anchored neighborhood," he said. The area is "close to everything but tucked 
away. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Hanks also bought an old house. Since moving in last October, Hanks, 31, 
an analyst with the Los Angeles County Treasurer's office, said she and her 
husband, Michael, 32, a finance analyst in the county's Chief Administrative 
Office, are busy "restoring the period fixtures, redoing plumbing and 
electrical while working around our new baby." 
</P>
<P>
Both wanted to end the commute from Orange County to their downtown jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rent Out Apartment 
</P>
<P>
"We heard about the great bargains here," Mike Hanks said, "and next thing we 
knew, we were signing on the bottom line. We both fell in love immediately" 
with the 86-year-old, four-bedroom, two-bath 1,800-square-foot Craftsman-style 
house. 
</P>
<P>
The house cost $230,000; a one-bedroom apartment out back helps them meet the 
mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
The only problems so far: Their car has been broken into and they have to go to 
the San Fernando Valley to find large discount home fix-it stores. 
</P>
<P>
But these are small concerns. Kathy Hanks said they "really love L.A." and love 
not having to make "that killer commute." 
</P>
<P>
The Hankses' experience with their car is typical, according to Northeast 
Division Police Sgt. Mike Nichol. "The major crime is theft from autos (radios, 
etc.). Highland Park has the second-lowest crime rate in our division, after 
Silver Lake," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And, outside of an outbreak of gang violence in 1985, "crime in Highland Park 
usually remains about status quo," Nichol said. The local gangs "are still 
there, but pretty quiet." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Early Suburb 
</P>
<P>
Like Mt. Washington on its western border, Highland Park in the early 1900s 
became one of the first suburbs of Los Angeles, home to a new middle class and 
a large contingent of artists and writers attracted to the hills and canyons. 
</P>
<P>
There was a significant religious component as well: Monte Vista Street has 
many churches that were built a half-century ago as well as one of the earliest 
synagogues in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The coming of the Arroyo Seco Parkway -- now known as the Pasadena Freeway -- 
signaled the beginning of the area's decline. North Figueroa Street, which had 
become a strong commercial district in the 1930s, was bypassed by potential 
customers on their way to and from Los Angeles and Pasadena. Highland Park 
settled into its sleepy ways. 
</P>
<P>
It remains a community in search of a center. Two landmarks have gone under in 
recent years: The Northeast Division police headquarters on York Boulevard was 
moved to Atwater (the two-story brick building, vacant since 1983, is now a 
popular film location used for its old-fashioned jail cells and booking room). 
</P>
<P>
And Iver's department store on Figueroa Street closed in 1984 after 71 years at 
the same spot, leaving a large vacuum. The once-proud family-owned store is now 
a mini-mall, and there is no large or well-known store to anchor the 
10-block-long shopping strip along North Figueroa Street between Avenues 50 and 
60, Highland Park's main drag. 
</P>
<P>
The cultural attractions are scattered, but well worth searching out: 
</P>
<P>
The Southwest Museum houses the nation's greatest collection of American Indian 
artifacts; Heritage Square is a collection of one-of-a-kind 19th- and 
20th-Century houses moved to a vacant field next to the Pasadena Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Another is El Alisal, the home of Highland Park's most famous resident, Charles 
Lummis, a pioneer in the preservation of Southwest architecture and artifacts 
and founder of the Southwest Museum (1914), who walked to California in 1885 
from Ohio to become the first city editor of The Times. Lummis died in 1928. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Johnsen, 36, a free-lance graphic designer, said the cultural attractions 
are just one of many reasons that he and his wife, Pearl Beach, a free-lance 
illustrator, moved to Highland Park with their daughter in late 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"Highland Park has a small-town atmosphere in the middle of this huge city," 
Johnsen said. "We're five minutes from downtown, and it feels like we're miles 
and miles away. We love the culture here, the people -- it's a colorful 
community." 
</P>
<P>
Realtor Bob Taylor of Harnsberger &amp; Associates. showed the couple around 
the area; they had never been there. Taylor said they were among the first 
trickle of young professionals moving into the community. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve and Pearl were among the 'pioneers,' " Taylor said. "As artists, they 
were very open to my showing them interesting houses. It's fun to show 
newcomers the hidden treasures here." 
</P>
<P>
Johnsen and Beach had looked in Laurel Canyon, the La Brea area, Silver Lake 
and Echo Park before finding their house, which Johnsen describes as a 
"charming little place built from stone from the arroyo, very unique." 
</P>
<P>
The 1,500-square-foot two-bedroom, one-bath house, built before the turn of the 
century and located on what became known as "Professors' Row," because it 
housed educators from Occidental College in the 1920s, has since been declared 
a cultural monument. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prices Have Climbed 
</P>
<P>
Johnsen says the house had a beautiful garden and the exterior "was pretty 
clean -- what can you do to stone?" They are restoring the interior room by 
room; the bedrooms are finished, the bathroom is next. 
</P>
<P>
Like much of Los Angeles, Highland Park house prices have gone up dramatically, 
particularly in pockets like the Pine Crest area bordering pricey South 
Pasadena, some sections north of York Boulevard, and the area near Avenue 64 on 
the Pasadena border. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, prices broke through the $200,000 ceiling; this spring it is not 
uncommon to see houses listed at or near the $300,000 mark. Not surprisingly, 
hillside homes with a view and/or the quiet woodsy ones generally command the 
most money. 
</P>
<P>
There are also a few expensive exceptions, including the magnificent Queen 
Anne-style hilltop home purchased by Los Angeles Deputy Mayor Mike Gage on El 
Mio Drive for nearly $450,000 a year ago and a huge turn-of-the-century charmer 
on Figueroa Street currently listed for $525,000. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the area remains affordable. Classified ads in a recent issue of the 
Highland Park News-Herald &amp; Journal, the local newspaper, showed a number 
of houses for sale for under $200,000, including a small group of "starter" 
homes near $125,000. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Pilgreen, who has a chiropractic practice on Avenue 64 and who moved a year 
ago from Sherman Oaks to Glassell Park near the Highland Park border, is 
investing in two houses in Highland Park because "the area is just so prime." 
</P>
<P>
"Prices here are cheap compared to most places and there are wonderful homes 
available," Pilgreen said. "I think York Boulevard -- with its proximity to 
Pasadena, Glendale and downtown -- could be the next Melrose Avenue." 
</P>
<P>
Pilgreen, who is rebuilding one of his Highland Park houses, a large, 
two-story, three-bedroom clapboard house that was damaged in a fire, thinks the 
area is "severely undervalued." 
</P>
<P>
But even though prices are climbing -- helped by the preservation movement and 
proximity to major work centers -- the area remains one of the last affordable 
housing markets in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
For long-term residents and newly moved-in yuppies alike, the goal now is to 
restore Highland Park's former luster, to make it as grand a place entering the 
last decade of the 20th Century as it was at the beginning.

REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS ARE FASTER ROAD TO RICHES THAN 
SAVING MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: My husband and I own our 4-bedroom home. We agree it was the best 
investment we ever made when we bought it about seven years ago. Although we 
had to pay 14% interest, we refinanced and are now paying only 9.5% interest on 
our mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
But, I can't get my husband to buy any more real estate. We have about $60,000 
in various certificates of deposit earning from 7% to 10% interest. Although 
that is good, I feel we should take some of this money to buy a nearby rental 
house as an investment. But, my husband is perfectly satisfied to keep earning 
meager interest on our money, which, after income taxes, is a pretty poor 
return. What do you advise? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Keep trying to persuade your husband that nobody ever became rich by 
saving money. The meager yields paid on savings seem high, but after income 
taxes and inflation you are lucky to break even. To earn big profits you must 
take risks, preferably as small as possible. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, sound, well-located homes usually appreciate at least 5% annually. 
More important, thanks to the magic of leverage, you can earn annual yields of 
50% or more. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate, suppose you buy a $100,000 home for a $10,000 cash down payment 
and obtain $90,000 financing. If that house appreciates 5% in market value in 
the next year to $105,000, that $5,000 increase is a 50% increase in your 
$10,000 investment. Even if you have a small negative cash flow, meaning the 
rent is less than the expenses, over the long term such a rental house should 
be a very profitable investment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lender's Insurance Doesn't Protect Buyer 
</P>
<P>
Q: We were caught in a very bad situation. The man from whom we bought a house 
forged his ex-wife's signature on a deed to him. Then he sold the house to us. 
She was out of the country, but when she returned, she claimed her half of the 
house. The title insurance company paid off the mortgage, but left us twisting 
in the wind. They say the lender's title insurance doesn't protect our $45,000 
equity. Is this correct? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. There are two types of title insurance. One is a lender's title policy, 
which protects the mortgage lender from loss due to unexpected title risks, 
such as forged signatures, claims of undiscovered heirs and many other risks. 
The other is an owner's title policy, which for a slight extra cost would have 
insured your equity. It was foolish economy not to buy an owner's title policy. 
Please consult your attorney regarding your claims against the dishonest 
seller. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Tax Benefits for Buying Vacant Land 
</P>
<P>
Q: I want to invest in vacant land, which I would hold several years until it 
appreciates in value. Are there any tax benefits of land investments? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Vacant land is probably the worst investment unless you are 100% certain 
that it will go up in market value. There are no special tax benefits. Of 
course, you can deduct mortgage interest and property taxes, but land is not 
depreciable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Improvement Loan Less Than Refinancing 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are planning to spend about $25,000 to upgrade our home. Should we 
finance these improvements with a home-improvement loan or refinance our entire 
first mortgage, which currently has a 9.75% interest rate? 
</P>
<P>
A: I wouldn't touch that nice 9.75%-rate mortgage. Your best alternative is to 
obtain a bank home-improvement loan, currently around 12% to 13% interest in 
most areas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Is Time Good to Start Selling Real Estate? 
</P>
<P>
Q: One of my friends recently went back to work selling real estate. In her 
first month, she earned about $5,600 in sales commissions. Although I don't 
have a real estate sales license and would have to take classes and study for 
the exam, do you think today is a good time to get into real estate sales on a 
part-time basis? 
</P>
<P>
A: If you are just becoming a real estate salesperson for the high income, 
please don't do it. But, if you sincerely want to help property buyers and 
sellers, while earning a high income for yourself, then you should get your 
sales license and give realty sales a 100% effort. 
</P>
<P>
However, if you can't devote full-time to selling real estate, perhaps you 
should find another line of work because it is very difficult to become 
successful on a part-time basis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Why Are So Many Deals Falling Apart? 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am a real estate agent who has been selling homes for more than 10 years. 
But I have never had so many home sales fall apart as in the last few months. 
The buyers have various reasons, such as change of mind, problems obtaining 
mortgages, financial reverses. One couple decided to divorce, and several 
buyers found other houses they liked better. I realize I could sue for the 
sales commissions, but my firm does not believe this is good public relations. 
Do you have any idea why so many home sales are falling apart? 
</P>
<P>
A: My real estate agent friends share your problem. There is no easy solution, 
other than to constantly remind the buyers that they are getting a good deal. 
Your aim should be to prevent buyer's remorse, that dreaded illness that 
affects virtually every home buyer, especially first-timers. 
</P>
<P>
The most successful realty agents prevent home sales from falling apart by 
anticipating problems. These difficulties can include inspections, financing 
and closing problems. Failure to remove contingencies on time is another major 
trouble spot. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most successful realty agents I know uses the "we" strategy. For 
example, she says, "I think we should do this" and "Our next step is to do 
this." By leading the buyer gracefully, but firmly, she remains in control and 
never lets the buyer wander or get lost in the home-buying maze. Perhaps you 
should adopt a similar strategy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Book on Buying Home With Little Cash 
</P>
<P>
Q: Please recommend a book or other source on how to buy a home and investment 
property for a low down payment. As we have no alternative, but have good 
income, we need all the help we can get before realty prices go higher. 
</P>
<P>
A: The best book about buying real estate with little or no cash is Robert G. 
Allen's "Nothing Down," available at larger bookstores and libraries. Study it 
very carefully and you will find at least 53 ways to buy real estate with 
virtually no cash. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Are Apartments a Good Investment? 
</P>
<P>
Q: You often recommend buying single-family homes for personal use and for 
investment as rentals. But, I can't recall your recommending apartments for 
investments. As a novice investor who realizes most fortunes are made in real 
estate, what do you think of apartments? 
</P>
<P>
A: As a former apartment investor, I can say with great authority that houses 
are much easier to buy, finance, manage and resell profitably. 
</P>
<P>
When I owned apartments I learned that I had to increase net income to increase 
the property value. However, the market value of houses depends on neighborhood 
supply and demand rather than net income. If you own well-located houses in 
good condition, you can enjoy rental income while inflation drives home prices 
gradually up. Better yet, do as I do and buy run-down junker houses that can be 
fixed up for resale profit. 
</P>
<P>
But, a special word of warning: Watch the quality of the school district 
especially closely. Families will flee bad schools, thus hurting the value of 
even the best-located homes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Is Title Insurance Required by Law? 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am buying some rural land for cash. Someday I want to build a retirement 
home there. A local attorney is handling the title transfer. But the realty 
agent says I have to buy title insurance. Is this true? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Title insurance is not legally required in any state. But you would be a 
fool not to buy an owner's policy to protect your equity. 
</P>
<P>
Although I'm sure you have great confidence in the attorney handling the title 
transfer, if he makes a mistake or fails to carefully check the title status 
and can't pay your resulting loss, you are up the creek. Title insurance is 
cheap peace-of-mind protection for property buyers, especially those who don't 
have a mortgage. If you had a mortgage, the lender would insist that you obtain 
title insurance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Delays Buying Home, Fearing Recession 
</P>
<P>
Q: My husband is reluctant to buy a home because he thinks tough times are 
coming and we might lose a home we buy. He says we should continue saving our 
money and forget about buying a home until the economic conditions settle. What 
do you think? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think your husband doesn't want to buy a house and will use any excuse he 
can find to avoid buying. The country is booming, economically. Employment was 
never higher. The unemployment rate is dropping. 
</P>
<P>
There is never a perfect time to buy a home. Yet millions of homeowners took a 
chance, bought their homes and now realize it was the best investment they ever 
made. You can either join them or continue wasting money paying rent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How to Sell House in Competitive Market 
</P>
<P>
Q: Several months ago, I inherited a house from my late father. As I live about 
350 miles away, I decided to sell the house. It has been listed with a fine 
realtor, who is trying hard to find a buyer. The asking price is slightly below 
recent neighborhood sales prices. But, the problem is the market where the 
house is located is overbuilt. For every house that sells, the realtor tells me 
there are six houses still for sale. Any suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
A: To sell a home for top dollar in a good or bad market, wrap it in an 
attractive package. In a very competitive market, your house must offer special 
advantages. 
</P>
<P>
First, check the home's physical condition. Be sure it is freshly painted 
inside and outside. Also, make necessary repairs, clean up the grounds and 
landscape if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Second, look at the home's financing package. Make certain the realtor has 
mortgage alternatives lined up for prospective buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Third, if you can carry back financing for the buyer at an attractive 
below-market interest rate with a low down payment, you will make the home 
stand out from the crowd. Since you inherited the house and paid nothing for 
it, providing seller financing will give you welcome extra income from both 
principal and interest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What Is Best Way for Group to Invest? 
</P>
<P>
Q: My brother, a cousin and I want to pool our resources to invest in run-down 
properties, which we will fix up to resell for profit. Should we form a 
corporation to hold title? 
</P>
<P>
A: I do not like holding title to real estate in the name of a corporation 
because it can be difficult to pass through all the ownership benefits to the 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Another alternative is to form a limited partnership to hold title. This method 
limits the liability of the partners, just like a corporation. However, if the 
partners actively participate in managing the property, the limited liability 
benefits are lost. 
</P>
<P>
Still another possibility is a general partnership. But, a serious drawback is 
that any general partner can obligate the partnership assets without approval 
of the other partners. 
</P>
<P>
While none of the methods of group ownership is perfect, you definitely need a 
written agreement to specify the obligations and benefits each investor will 
encounter. I do not recommend just taking title as tenants in common and hoping 
everything works out as planned. Consult a real estate attorney to draw up a 
written contract to prevent misunderstandings. 
</P>

RESTAURANT REVIEW: KOREAN PINE TREE: WILD MEALS IN BLAND LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Northridge Fashion Center is just about a shopping paradise, but there's one 
thing you can't get there: abalone porridge. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the little restaurant row that has grown up nearby, on Nordhoff and 
Tampa, the food ranges cautiously from burgers to Greek. Some of it is quite 
good, but if you want a meal on the wild side you're out of luck. 
</P>
<P>
Except for one place: the Pine Tree Restaurant. It draws customers from the 
local Korean community plus the occasional mall shopper and students from Cal 
State Northridge whose dining universe does not end at Reseda Boulevard. And, 
I'm sure, abalone porridge lovers from all over too. 
</P>
<P>
Now, "abalone porridge" is not really what I'd call this particular dish. The 
name brings to mind oatmeal mush, and in fact when you ask the waitress to 
describe the dish, that's unfortunately what she compares it to: oatmeal. It 
sounds like the worst English breakfast idea you've ever heard of. 
</P>
<P>
Wrong. This is a rice dish. It has the consistency of risotto and a clean 
flavor from the strips of abalone that swim in it and the dried seaweed 
floating on top. There are also a few jolly spots of color (squash and carrot 
chunks, a tiny raw quail egg) that don't suggest the breakfast tray either. 
Call it risotto de abalone a la nouvelle and you'd sell a million of them. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, not everything is wild. Korean food cuts its own swath through the 
forest of culinary possibilities. It certainly includes things you might not 
imagine anybody would eat, starting with the rank-smelling pickled cabbage 
called kimchi that accompanies everything. 
</P>
<P>
That is, you might not imagine anybody would eat kimchi the first time you 
taste it, but the stuff grows on you. In the end you're liable to find that for 
all the rank smell, the principal impression kimchi gives is freshness. (On the 
other hand, I must say I'm still working on developing a taste for the 
fermented bean paste that sometimes shows up among the five or six side dishes 
that automatically come along with any entree.) 
</P>
<P>
But there are also plain and simple meat dishes that could almost come from the 
Midwest. The meal always begins with an excellent beef bouillon with some mild 
radish slices floating in it. The short rib stew, kal bi gim, is hearty, almost 
supernaturally meaty-flavored short ribs braised with carrots, bits of green 
squash and a couple of mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Korean barbecue is well-known as being easy to take. The Pine Tree has a gas 
grill at every table for you to do your own barbecuing (as long as two or more 
people at the table order barbecue; otherwise it will be cooked for you in the 
kitchen). An efficient hooded fan removes the smoke as you play with the beef 
strips or chicken pieces on the grill with your chopsticks and then dip them in 
soy sesame sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Well, to tell the truth, instead of beef or chicken you could barbecue tongue 
slices, or either of two cuts of intestine. But for the cautious, the barbecued 
beef ribs are particularly neat, the meat sliced off the bone in a single strip 
like an orange peel. 
</P>
<P>
Sang soo back ban, confusingly described as "wrapped with lettuce and beef," is 
actually some barbecued beef brought out on a sizzling platter accompanied by 
about half a head of romaine lettuce, a mild herb that looks like baby celery 
and the usual array of Korean side dishes: kimchi, radish salad, spinach, 
sprouts and whatever. You wrap up the beef in the lettuce, dip it in thick 
sweet soy sauce and eat it like a taco. 
</P>
<P>
There are also noodle dishes, notably jalchap (transparent noodles with bits of 
beef and vegetables), which is featured in several of the bargain lunches, such 
as the barbecued beef and jalchap combo. Fish tends to be roasted very plainly, 
but there are seafood casseroles that are more complex, such as the hot crab 
casserole with tofu, transparent noodles and green onions in a sharp, thin red 
pepper sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Among the appetizers, there are nice dumplings filled with a little beef and 
some green leaf vegetable, either steamed or fried. I think I prefer the smooth 
and luscious steamed dumplings (mool man doo) to the fried ones. There are also 
more familiar things like tempura in lightly cooked batter, mostly prawns but 
including some carrots and (I think) sweet potato as well as onion rings for 
the surprise factor. 
</P>
<P>
What's for dessert? A stick of Juicy Fruit, that's what. If dessert's what you 
want, pally, go back to the mall. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes: mool man doo, $6.50; abalone porridge, $11; sang soo back 
ban, $8.95; kal bi gim, $9.50.

ART NOTEBOOK: CHINESE ARTIST BUILDS ON IDEALS OF 2 CULTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN ALLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ye Wu-Lin, a well-known landscape painter in his native China, is having his 
first U.S. exhibit at the Couturier Gallery in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Sian, China, in 1944, Ye spent the years of the Chinese cultural 
revolution in the countryside, learning to grow crops, according to his 
American translator, Monica Hsu. Thereafter, he began working for the 
government designing postage stamps. In 1976, one of his state-commissioned 
paintings received an award at the International Stamp Exhibition in Italy. 
Since then, his work has been displayed widely in China and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
In China, "landscape painters brought their own spirit and personality to the 
painting instead of merely copying from nature," Ye said. "This is the perfect 
state all Chinese landscape painters try to achieve." 
</P>
<P>
Chinese landscape painting, a genre at least 15 centuries old, is rich in 
tradition and subtle meaning in ways that American landscape painting has never 
been. As early as the Tang Dynasty, Chinese landscape painters were less 
concerned with what Americans would consider traditional realism than with 
poetic images reflecting the balance between man and nature. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, Chinese landscapes tend to put too much emphasis on abstract notions 
and neglect visual vividness," Ye said. "Western landscapes, on the other hand, 
have never reached the artistic height of figure or history painting. To the 
Chinese eye, Western landscape painting seems to lack maturity and profundity." 
</P>
<P>
Ye's technique incorporates the ideals of centuries-old Chinese landscape 
painting with the realism traditionally prized by Westerners. He now has 
permanent canvases in China's National Art Gallery and the Historical Museum in 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Ye is living in Los Angeles for a year, planning to travel to paint native 
landscapes in California, the Grand Canyon and elsewhere. The artist is here as 
a visitor solely on his on; the Chinese government played no active role in 
bringing him to the United States, according to Hsu. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition continues through May 27. 
</P>
<P>
Couturier Gallery, 166 N. La Brea Ave., Los Angeles. (213) 933-5557. Open 
Tuesday through Saturday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. and by appointment. 
</P>
<P>
ELWES AT CAZ: The CAZ Gallery in West Hollywood is exhibiting the second Los 
Angeles show of works by Damian Elwes, the young British figurative painter 
popularized by art impresario Robert Fraser. 
</P>
<P>
Elwes is the grandson of society portraitist Simon Elwes, whose 
Postimpressionist brush captured many crowned heads of European society in the 
'20s, '30s and '40s. He also painted many American philanthropists of those 
decades. Like his grandfather's, Damian Elwes' paintings have found a wide 
society audience in the United States and Europe. His busy abstract portraits 
incorporate Expressionist images with the shapes and colors made familiar by 
urban graffiti artists. 
</P>
<P>
The combination has produced sellout crowds at his last New York and Los 
Angeles shows and a client list that includes Gene Kelly, Al Pacino, Emilio 
Estevez, Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, Pierce Brosnan and Rob Lowe. His 
inaugural show, under the auspices of Fraser, was in 1985 at the Edinburgh 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
The CAZ exhibit, which opened yesterday, continues through May 7. 
</P>
<P>
CAZ Gallery, 8715 Melrose Ave., West Hollywood. (213) 652-6952. Open Monday 
through Friday, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Saturday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
FROM HOLLAND HOSPITAL: The Outside-in Gallery in West Hollywood will present 
the local debut of artist Dewey Blocksma beginning Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Blocksma was until recently an emergency room doctor in Holland, Mich. He left 
the job to travel across the United States in his Volkswagen, producing 
drawings, canvases and sculptures influenced by rural America in terms of 
subject matter and the use of simple materials. 
</P>
<P>
Framed screen doors, painted and hung with everyday items, are a major part of 
this new show, according to gallery owner Liz Blackman, who curated last year's 
successful exhibit of the works of the Rev. Howard Finster, a Georgia folk 
artist. 
</P>
<P>
Outside-in Gallery, 834-B Westmount Drive, West Hollywood. (213) 657-6369. By 
appointment only.

Twenty-two employees at Compaq Computer Corp. in Houston have been charged with 
stealing computer chips and trading them for cocaine and marijuana, police 
said. The arrests capped a six-month undercover investigation that began after 
police were tipped to the illegal activities, said Capt. Mike Smith of the 
Sheriff's Department. The company, which has 4,000 employees and is the 
nation's third-largest maker of personal computers, hired a private 
investigator who posed as an employee to help police in making drug 
transactions, he said.

A three-member federal appeals court panel has upheld the dismissal of suits by 
Pacific islanders claiming damages from U.S. nuclear tests. "Congress has 
stripped the courts of jurisdiction over these claims," declared the appeals 
court opinion. U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan had ruled in 1987 that 
federal courts have no jurisdiction to assess the validity of an agreement 
giving the government of the Marshall Islands authority to press claims of 
citizens for damages from the atomic tests between 1946 and 1958. The Marshall 
Islands and the United States in 1986 signed a Compact of Free Association 
giving the islands self-government status. Under the independence settlement, 
the United States gave the Marshall Islands government $150 million to pay 
people claiming damages from the U.S. nuclear tests in the 1940s and 1950s.

THE SEARCH FOR DEEP POCKETS; 
</P>
<P>
OBSERVERS OF THE ORANGE COUNTY ARTS SCENE ARE WONDERING WHO WILL PAY FOR THE 
PROFUSION OF PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Last weekend, for the first time in its history, the Newport Harbor Art Museum 
canceled a fund-raising event for lack of ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
The museum's director of development, Margie Shackelford, said the "Good 
Vibrations" affair, which was to have coincided with an exhibition of pop art 
from the '60s, was called off because of unforeseen competition from private 
parties. Still, some observers of the local arts scene are wondering whether 
the explosion in projects is plumbing the depths of the county's deep pockets. 
</P>
<P>
A marketing report released earlier this month has recommended that the Orange 
County Center for the Performing Arts build as many as three new theaters -- at 
a cost of up to $119 million. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding the cost of programming and endowments, other capital projects now 
either under construction or on the drawing board -- from Costa Mesa south to 
Laguna Beach alone -- could exceed $50 million more. These include the Newport 
Harbor Art Museum ($20 million), the 750-seat Irvine Theatre ($17.6 million), 
expansion of the Laguna Playhouse ($2.8 million) and a new, 1,500-seat theater 
in Mission Viejo, which has no cost estimate. 
</P>
<P>
"Population in Orange County is growing rapidly," according to the Center's 
marketing study, prepared by the Harrison Price Co. of Torrance. "Estimated 
population in the year 2000 is approximately 2.7 million persons. To maintain 
the same ratio of population attending performing arts events as is currently 
being achieved, the county must increase both the level of programming and the 
number of theater seats. . . . If Orange County is to provide programs for its 
growing audience, it must build new theaters." 
</P>
<P>
Although a significant portion of the funding of these projects has been 
provided from public sources or already has been raised from private sources, 
still more needs to be raised. These needs include up to $10 million, for 
example, for the Newport Harbor Art museum (the museum declined to say how much 
more has been raised since it announced that it had reached the halfway point), 
$3.2 million for the Irvine Theatre and $2 million for the Laguna Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Even on the local level, the hunt for private money to help build and renovate 
arts institutions is growing. Backers of Huntington Beach's new Municipal Arts 
Center, sensing a shift of sentiment on the newly elected City Council, 
announced plans earlier this month to raise more than $300,000 through a 
nonprofit foundation. . In Fullerton, supporters of the Muckenthaler Cultural 
Center are hoping to raise $300,000 for major renovations, also from private 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
With all this construction under way and in the wind, "certainly the issue will 
have to come up of where the dough is going to come (from)," says David Emmes, 
producing artistic director of South Coast Repertory Theatre, which expanded 
its own facilities in Costa Mesa to the tune of $1.7 million 2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Professional fund raisers affiliated with various county arts organizations are 
upbeat. Newport Harbor's Shackelford, for instance, is unconcerned by the other 
campaigns. She said the drive for the museum, which is slated to open in 1992, 
is going "very well," and she said that her organization's fund-raising 
probably would be completed by the time the Center's expansion campaign was 
getting under way. 
</P>
<P>
"There is certainly plenty of money to go around in Orange County," she said. 
"The county's booming." 
</P>
<P>
All the major campaigns, she said, had feasibility studies done before they 
began. 
</P>
<P>
"The county is ready for these institutions," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Goldstein, a New York fund-raising consultant now working for the 
museum's campaign, agreed that private giving for the arts in Orange County is 
"nowhere near the limit" of what can be done. With the median age rising to the 
late 30s, he said, "marginal and incremental supporters will later become 
serious supporters." 
</P>
<P>
Henry Segerstrom, perhaps the best known performing arts patron in the county, 
said he believes that the Center's forthcoming capital campaign will not 
compete with any of the projects now under way. 
</P>
<P>
But James L. Vandeberg thinks arts "organizations need to bear in mind that 
there's a finite amount of money out there." Vandeberg is secretary and 
corporate counsel for Carter Hawley Hale and vice president of South Coast 
Repertory. Carter Hawley Hale has contributed $50,000 to SCR and between 
$50,000 and $100,000 to the Performing Arts Center's $73-million building fund 
around the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Raising tens of millions of dollars for the various new building projects 
should be "a real challenge," Vandeberg said. "That's a lot of money. They 
might have to expand out of Orange and L.A. counties to raise it." 
</P>
<P>
At its recent board meeting, the Center established a division of national 
gifts. But based on the Center's experience in building the existing facility, 
two-thirds of the money contributed by businesses will be from those with 
headquarters in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, some of the same names pop up whenever the hat is passed for major 
donations for the arts: 
</P>
<P>
* The Segerstrom family, which donated the land for the Performing Arts Center, 
valued at the time at $5 million, as well as $6 million for construction. One 
of the most likely sites for the proposed Center expansion is owned by family 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
* The Irvine Co., which contributed the site for the Newport Harbor Art Museum, 
$1.75 million to the Performing Arts Center building fund and $600,000 to the 
Irvine Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
* The Harry and Grace Steele Foundation, which gave $1 million to the Center's 
building fund, $500,000 in matching funds to the Laguna Playhouse's capital 
campaign and $50,000 to SCR's 1987 expansion, and has pledged $1 million to 
Newport Harbor Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
* The Mission Viejo Co., which contributed between $100,000 and $250,000 to the 
Center's building fund and an unspecified amount to the Laguna Playhouse 
expansion. The company is also expected to be a major supporter of the proposed 
Mission Viejo theater, which may be built on the campus of Saddleback College. 
</P>
<P>
Like the major corporate givers, the number of foundations who are likely to 
participate in capital campaigns is limited. Relatively few national 
foundations, like the Kresge Foundation, make "brick-and-mortar" grants to 
build facilities, according to fund-raiser Goldstein. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Steele Foundation, major players in Orange County include 
the James Irvine Foundation (not affiliated with the Irvine Co.), which 
contributed more than $1 million to the Center's building fund; the W.M. Keck 
Foundation of Los Angeles, which donated a similar amount; the Security Pacific 
Foundation, which gave between $500,000 and $1 million, and the Ahmanson 
Foundation, which gave between $250,000 and $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
At some point, major donors may begin making choices about their giving, 
although most were reluctant to be quoted on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
The Mission Viejo Co., for example, supports the idea of a theater on the 
Saddleback campus. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too early in that proposal to decide much else," said Wendy Wetzel, 
director of corporate affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how that support would affect the company's participation in building new 
theaters at the Center in Costa Mesa, Wetzel said only that "projects in our 
planned community do have our first priority." 
</P>
<P>
Another question that looms is whether the reliance on these major contributors 
can continue. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas C. Rankin, general director of the Irvine Theater, has a unique 
perspective. His $17.9-million institution is being watched as a model of 
local, state and private partnership. 
</P>
<P>
The site for the theater was donated by UC Irvine, which also contributed $1.8 
million in cash, and the city of Irvine has approved $11.3 million in building 
support. That still left $4.8 million to be raised from the private sector. To 
date, $1.6 million of that has been raised. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the Irvine Co. has made the largest private contribution to date -- 
$600,000 -- Rankin thinks institutions like his need to look beyond the usual 
sources of major givers. 
</P>
<P>
His strategy has been to "develop new leadership and new contributors who are 
out there. I believe that if you can first find them and then create the 
interest for your project in their minds, those individuals and corporations 
will grow over time and have the potential of becoming major donors later on. . 
. . We're in this for the long haul." 
</P>
<P>
But, at least for the foreseeable future, Segerstrom says he expects the 
traditional pyramid configuration of fund-raising, with its heavy reliance on 
major givers, to apply: the top 10 donors account for one third of the total, 
the next hundred largest donors provide the second third of the total and all 
the remaining givers provide the rest. 
</P>
<P>
It's even possible, said Bob Sharp, a Santa Ana-based consultant, that reliance 
on large donors is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp, who directed the Center's building campaign and is now directing the 
Irvine Theatre's efforts, said that recent figures on efforts similar to the 
Center indicated that as much as 95% of the money was coming from 5% of the 
donors. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest challenge to fund-raisers is the Performing Arts Center, primarily 
because of the hefty price tag for the Center's new theaters and the Center's 
policy of not accepting government funds. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, the Center has so far only accepted the Harrison Price survey's 
recommendations and is in the very preliminary stage of looking for a site for 
the new theaters. And while the survey recommends building three new theaters, 
for up to $119 million, it suggests that one of these could be "deferred." Even 
building two of the three theaters -- a concert hall being first in order of 
priority -- probably will require a capital campaign of $90 million over the 
next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
John Miltner, vice chancellor of UCI and a member of the Center board, thinks a 
$90-million capital campaign is realistic, but he doesn't disagree with Rankin 
that newer sources of funding will be needed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's realistic if (Center officials) start right now expanding their 
constituency," said Miltner, who has served as chairman of the National Society 
of Fundraising Executives. "I don't think they can do it on the existing donor 
base."

Many arts projects requiring private donations are under way in Orange County. 
Some fund raisers see only a finite amount of money available from patrons. 
Other say private giving is "nowhere near the limit."

RANDY LEWIS: HAPPY ABOUT THAT LOVELY SAD JAZZ; 
</P>
<P>
THE BLUES HAS SLIPPED INSIDE THE PERFORMING ARTS CENTER'S BACK DOOR. NOW IT'S 
TIME FOR THE BIG STAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
What is "the blues"? Depends on whom you ask. 
</P>
<P>
Webster's defines the blues as: "Black folk music characterized by minor 
harmonies, typically slow tempo, and melancholy words." 
</P>
<P>
The folks at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, who sponsored several 
performances last week by blues musicians John Cephas and Phil Wiggins as part 
of the Imagination Celebration for children, were (predictably) higher of brow: 
</P>
<P>
Quoting from the Encyclopaedia Brittanica, the Center's program told of 
"Afro-American vocal and instrumental style, characterized by expressive pitch 
inflections (blue notes), unique tone qualities, a text-phrase construction 
based on a three-line stanza and, typically, a 12-measure form." 
</P>
<P>
What -- no iambic pentameter? 
</P>
<P>
The program writer went on to add that in the blues, "African influences are 
apparent in the call-and-response pattern, the falsetto break, the blue 
tonality and the imitation of vocal idioms by instruments. The blues 
contribution to music is immense, as it has been a major influence on all forms 
of jazz, as well as contemporary popular and rock music." 
</P>
<P>
Got that? 
</P>
<P>
For 13-year-old Eva MacGillivray of Irvine, though, it took just two words to 
define the blues: "It's sad jazz." 
</P>
<P>
Eva and three girlfriends from Irvine were at the Center on Monday night as 
guitarist Cephas and mouth harpist Wiggins, both from Washington, presented 
"Chewing the Blues," a touring concert-cum-play designed as a blues primer. 
</P>
<P>
Walking into the Center's small Founders Hall theater, the four girls didn't 
know much aboutthe blues -- exactly the sort of people the program was designed 
for. Twelve-year-old Gusti Lind's mother, Shirley, brought the girls because, 
she said, "I think it is important that children be exposed to different kinds 
of arts and culture." 
</P>
<P>
When Eva heard that, she rolled her eyes and said, "That's what my mom says. Do 
you guys have meetings or something?" 
</P>
<P>
It would be easy to nit-pick about the Center's cautious, stilted handling of 
this least stilted of musical forms. Instead of expounding on "blue tonality" 
and "text-phrase construction," why not get down to earth with these kids, who 
have grown up mostly unaware of the musical sources that mysteriously mutated 
into Madonna and Bon Jovi? 
</P>
<P>
Why not just tell 'em that the blues is what you sing when you lose your love, 
your money, your job; that it's the song to sing when you feel sad, so that you 
won't feel so sad? 
</P>
<P>
We're talking about music that wells up out of a tortured or enraptured soul. 
Not microchip technology. I could also have done without the quasi-theatrical 
setting -- a mock recording session -- that set up an unnecessary barrier. The 
blues should be a dialogue between performer and audience, not a "show." 
</P>
<P>
But in the end, the program was successful despite all the Center's attempts to 
dress the blues up, because when it got down to the music, the show gave us the 
genuine article. And it recognized, however stiffly, that blues -- the music 
created by uneducated, "uncultured" blacks -- is as crucial to U.S. culture as 
opera is to Europe's. 
</P>
<P>
Cephas and Wiggins mostly stuck to up-tempo blues -- which always plays better 
to short attention spans than moaning, country blues. Still, theirs was 
authentic, rural folk-blues, not far removed from the kind born nearly a 
century ago on the porches of sharecroppers' shacks overlooking dusty dirt 
roads of the Deep South. 
</P>
<P>
They kept the children entertained and engaged. After the show, Adrienne Cohen, 
13, said: "It was better than we expected. We thought it was going to be 
stupid." Sarah Pemberton, also 13, agreed that "it was good" (though she 
allowed that "it's not something I'd listen to on a monthly basis.") 
</P>
<P>
What reached these students wasn't some silly attempt to intellectualize the 
blues but the direct person-to-person power of the music itself. "That guy on 
the harmonica was really good," Adrienne said. 
</P>
<P>
And now that a little real blues has gotten a foothold at the Center -- albeit 
through the back door, for a kids' show in the tiny downstairs theater -- maybe 
the powers that be will heed Shirley Lind's advice about the importance of 
exposure to all forms of arts and culture. 
</P>
<P>
Wouldn't it be great to see the likes of B.B. King, Robert Cray, Etta James or 
John Lee Hooker playing in prestigious Segerstrom Hall? 
</P>
<P>
(Though I'd hate to read the program notes: "Mr. King has gained renown in 
postwar American music as a virtuoso of the six-string, electronically 
amplified guitar. His skillful juxtaposing of the secular and the spiritual is 
illustrated when he vocalizes the two-bar stanza: 'I got a sweet li'l angel/I 
love the way she spread her wings.' ") 
</P>
<P>
Heck, we've gotten plenty of opera, i.e., sad musical theater. How about 
finding room for a little of that sad jazz?

CHAINS PLEDGE TO INVESTIGATE; 
</P>
<P>
ALAR FOUND ON O.C. APPLES IN STORES DISCLAIMING USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARCIDA DODSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Red apples purchased from four of five Orange County supermarkets were found in 
independent tests to have residue of Alar, a possibly carcinogenic chemical 
that each of the stores claimed was not used by their apple suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
The tests, conducted for The Times Orange County by a private San Francisco 
laboratory, found the highest levels of Alar -- 4.59 parts per million -- in a 
sample of McIntosh apples from Albertson's in Cypress, where signs had been 
prominently displayed claiming that all apples were Alar-free. 
</P>
<P>
Upon hearing of the test results, the store's manager said he planned to "pull 
them (the McIntosh apples) off the racks right now." 
</P>
<P>
All levels of Alar residue detected in the tests of apples bought in Orange 
County were significantly lower than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's 
allowable limit of 20 p.p.m. But that limit -- set before the chemical was 
linked to cancer in animals -- could cause health problems over the long run, 
though not in the short run, an EPA spokesman said, adding that no detectable 
level of Alar is without risk. The EPA is expected to ban the chemical next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Apples with Alar residue also were found at Irvine Ranch Farmers Market in 
Irvine, an upscale market specializing in gourmet food, as well as at Vons 
Pavilions in Buena Park and Alpha Beta in San Clemente. All claimed either in 
signs or in response to questions before the testing that the apples were free 
of the controversial chemical. 
</P>
<P>
In all, only six of 25 samples of red apples purchased from April 18 through 20 
at five Orange County stores showed Alar residue. The markets were chosen 
randomly for a geographic sampling from Buena Park to San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the store chains expressed surprised at the test results, saying 
they had been assured by their suppliers that the apples were not Alar-tainted, 
and all pledged to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
A representative of one of the growers that supplied apples with Alar residue 
to two stores angrily refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Alar -- the trade name for the chemical daminozide, which is used on some apple 
crops to extend shelf life -- has been linked to cancer. Consumer advocates 
contend that children are particularly at risk because they eat 
disproportionately large amounts of apples, apple juice and applesauce. 
</P>
<P>
Of the five stores selected by The Times to have their apples tested, only 
Mother's Market in Costa Mesa -- a large health food store with a smaller 
branch in Huntington Beach -- had red apples that showed no detectable traces 
of Alar. 
</P>
<P>
The independent tests call into question the EPA's estimates that Alar is used 
on only 5% to 10% of the nation's apple crop and dramatize the need for an 
immediate ban on the chemical, according to a scientist with an environmental 
group that released a controversial study earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
And even the lowest level detected in the tests, 0.97 p.p.m., is high enough to 
indicate that the chemical was used during the crop's growth and is not a 
residual trace left over from the spraying of previous crops, agreed spokesmen 
for the EPA and the Natural Resources Defense Council, the environmental group 
that released the study earlier this year about the chemical's effect on 
children. Tests have shown that most apples from crops sprayed with Alar have 
levels of 1 to 5 p.p.m., consistent with the findings in the tests done for The 
Times, according to a senior scientist with NRDC. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier testing for The Times at Los Angeles-area stores found Alar ranging 
from 0.59 p.p.m. to 9.48 p.p.m. in apples purchased at four upscale markets -- 
Mrs. Gooch's Natural Foods Market in Beverly Hills, Gelson's Markets in Century 
City, Bristol Farms in South Pasadena, and Farmers Market in Los Angeles. Tests 
on apples bought at two major supermarket chains, a Hughes market in Monterey 
Park and a Lucky store in Bell, had residues ranging from 0.97 p.p.m. to 9 
p.p.m. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest tests, Albertson's officials said they were surprised by the 
results showing Alar residue in McIntosh apples. The grocery chain has had a 
policy since August, 1986, to not purchase apples treated with Alar, a policy 
that the suppliers are aware of, said Steve Hilton, manager of quality 
assurance at the supermarket chain's headquarters in Boise, Ida. "The supplier 
of that product is, I think, going to read this news with chagrin. . . . We 
will certainly be in touch with him." 
</P>
<P>
He said Albertson's periodically requests and receives test reports on some 
shipments, "although we don't do it on all shipments." 
</P>
<P>
Three other types of red apples purchased at the Orange County store -- small 
and large Red Delicious and Rome Beauty -- showed no detectable levels in The 
Times' tests. 
</P>
<P>
At the Los Angeles headquarters of Irvine Ranch Farmers Market, general manager 
Doug Sweeney said he was surprised and disappointed to learn that two of the 
six types of red apples sold at the chain's store at 14443 Culver Drive, 
Irvine, had traces of Alar. The tests found 3.93 p.p.m. in Cortland apples and 
1.2 p.p.m. in small Red Delicious apples, while Gala, Rome Beauty, large Red 
Delicious and McIntosh apples showed no detectable traces in the tests. The 
supplier had assured him that all apples were free of the chemical, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The wholesaler in Los Angeles that we buy from gave us a letter saying his 
packer, shipper and growers do not use Alar," Sweeney said. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Ranch Farmers Markets used to contract with a laboratory to test apples 
but had to stop after the store sought protection under bankruptcy laws last 
July 22. "The expense is such that under bankruptcy conditions, we couldn't 
afford it anymore," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sweeney said last week that his supplier, when informed of the test results, 
indicated that he can produce letters from growers stating they do not use 
Alar. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't deal directly with the growers so until (the supplier) further 
investigates, we won't know what is going on," Sweeney said. "The supplier will 
have to pinpoint from what source he purchased the apples. The Cortland apple 
comes out of New York, and they are gone for the year, so we may not get 
results back. But with the Washington Red Delicious, we ought to find out why 
they contained Alar." 
</P>
<P>
At two other stores, Alpha Beta and Vons Pavilions, Alar-tainted apples came in 
prepackaged bags from the Evans Fruit Co. in Yakima, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Evans Fruit were asked to comment on the finding of Alar, but a 
woman who identified herself only as the co-owner of the company hung up during 
a telephone call. Before doing so, the woman said angrily: "Do you consider 
yourself the watchdog of the community? Well, you just go ahead and do what you 
do, and what we do is immaterial." 
</P>
<P>
Apples from a 3-pound bag of Evans Fruit Co.'s "Washington State" brand Red 
Delicious apples, purchased at Alpha Beta in San Clemente, showed 2.73 p.p.m., 
the testing laboratory reported. Unpackaged small Red Delicious apples from the 
same Alpha Beta also tested positive, at 0.97 p.p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Wade, a spokesman for the Alpha Beta Co. headquarters in La Habra, said 
the grocery chain's policy is to sell only apples from non-Alar-treated 
orchards. 
</P>
<P>
"We've instructed all our growers not to use Alar on products sent to us," Wade 
said. "We're very clear about that. The state Food and Agriculture Department 
does the testing (on Alpha Beta apples and other produce), and we accept their 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
"But a residual amount (of Alar) can remain on trees from previous years of 
use, and it can show up in low levels. Nonetheless, we want apples free of 
Alar, and we'll be checking on this situation." 
</P>
<P>
But the NRDC scientist disagreed, saying such levels do indicate that Alar was 
used on the current crop. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Vons Pavilions -- the source of the second 3-pound 
prepackaged bag of Evans' Fruit "Washington State" apples, this one with 1.08 
p.p.m. of Alar -- said the grocery chain will investigate the grower's apples. 
</P>
<P>
The sign over the apple bins at the chain's Buena Park store, where the bag was 
bought, had this sign: "We only buy apples that HAVE NOT been grown with the 
chemical Daminozide, better known as Alar." 
</P>
<P>
Vickie Sanders, a spokeswoman for Vons Cos. Inc. at its El Monte headquarters, 
said the chain has random tests performed by the state Food and Agriculture 
Department, in addition to performing its own "quality assurance" checks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's impossible to test every apple," Sanders said. "But in cases like this, 
as soon as we learn of any traces of Alar, we pull all those apples, because 
we're taking every effort to safeguard the consumer's health. 
</P>
<P>
"We will take steps to visit with that company (Evans Fruit) and see that this 
does not happen again, but this does not mean that Evans' apples are unsafe to 
eat." 
</P>
<P>
At Mother's Market in Costa Mesa, manager Sharon Macgurn said the store 
occasionally asks an employee of the state Food and Agriculture Department who 
lives in the area to test fruit. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel pretty confident, and we're glad you've confirmed it," said Steve 
Markell, the store's nutritional biochemist. 
</P>
<P>
Mother's Market sold six varieties of red apples last week, but only the 
organic apples -- which must be certified to have been grown in a field where 
no fertilizers, pesticides, growth regulators or any other chemicals have been 
used for a year -- had signs attesting to their purity. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrie Mott, senior scientist with the NRDC, said the tests done for The Times 
demonstrate the need for swift EPA action to remove the "non-essential 
chemical" from the market. "Retailers are in a difficult position. They have to 
accept suppliers' claims, or they have to pay for their own expensive testing," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
There is no known "safe level," Mott said. 
</P>
<P>
"Any level of exposure carries some risk. The higher the exposure, the higher 
the risk," Mott asserted. "I think it's a chemical we need to have taken off 
the market as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
EPA spokesman Albert Heier agreed that there is no "safe level" for Alar. 
"Whenever you have a pesticide that is a carcinogen, we don't talk about a safe 
level," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Heier said the level of 20 p.p.m. was set for field testing of apples. Alar 
breaks down quickly after the apples leave the field, and as it dissipates, the 
risk to humans lessens too, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the fact that more than one-fifth of the apples in tests conducted for 
The Times were Alar-positive does not indicate that the EPA estimates of Alar 
treatment are wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The apples for sale in markets now have been stored for many months, so it is 
possible that a higher percentage of them have been treated, because Alar 
lengthens shelf life, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Times' tests were performed by Anresco Inc., a San Francisco laboratory. 
Each sample consisted of eight to 10 apples and was plainly packaged and coded 
so that the laboratory did not know the variety of apple or its source. The PAM 
II method -- the official test method for daminozide -- was used. It can detect 
levels of Alar from 0.5 p.p.m. and above. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Bill Billiter and Carla Rivera contributed to this story.

ALAR LEVELS IN ORANGE COUNTY APPLES 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five samples of red apples were purchased from five Orange County 
supermarkets from April 18 through 20 and tested for the presence of Alar. 
Alar, the trade name of daminozide, has been linked to cancer in animals. Each 
store had indicated it was selling Alar-free apples. Each sample contained 
seven to 10 apples. Six of the samples tested by a private lab indicated levels 
ranging from 0.97 to 4.59 parts per million. The U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency has set an allowable limit of 20 p.p.m., although a spokesman said no 
level is without risk.

When Debbi Renshaw-Armenta began hang gliding 10 years ago, Jeff Scott was a 
guy she looked up to -- in more ways than one. Scott, 6 feet, 7 inches tall, 
stood out because of his height and because of his stature as a hang glider. He 
had set a long-distance record, gliding from Palmdale to Santa Monica in 1979, 
and could fly under the most difficult conditions. "He was the sky god," said 
Renshaw-Armenta, 33, of Green Valley Lake. "He would stay up when nobody else 
could." Renshaw-Armenta was one of more than 60 hang gliders who paid tribute 
to Scott on Saturday, the first day of the Jeff Scott Hang Gliding Competition. 
Scott died last September at the age of 32 after a nine-year battle with 
cancer. Local hang gliders established the four-day competition, which they 
hope to repeat annually, to honor the man who inspired so many of them. Wearing 
T-shirts bearing the slogan, "A Guy You Could Look Up To," 40 competitors 
launched off Kagel Mountain, at an elevation of 3,300 feet above sea level, for 
a race along the ridges of the San Gabriel Mountains. More than a dozen others 
made a recreational flight along the same course. To spectators at the landing 
field in Sylmar 2,300 feet below, canvas-wing gliders appeared to be giant 
paper airplanes in the sky or a flock of fowl.

A candlelight vigil will be held tonight in Laguna Beach in support of 
preserving Laguna Canyon. The last of three nightly events is presented by 
Light Around the World and will start at midnight on Main Beach in Laguna. The 
purpose of the event is to support preservation and to protest any future 
development of Laguna Canyon. The vigil will feature music, speakers and silent 
meditation. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, construction is scheduled to begin Monday on a planned 600-foot 
mural along Laguna Canyon Road, made from more than 40,000 snapshots. 
Spearheaded by photographers Jerry Burchfield and Mark Chamberlain, the project 
is named "The Tell" (the archeological term for a mound of buried artifacts) 
and is part of a larger effort to document changes in the canyon during a time 
of heavy development.

KRAFT JURORS DELIBERATE FOR A SECOND DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jurors in the Randy Steven Kraft serial murder trial broke at noon Saturday, 
completing their second day of deliberations, and returned to the hotel where 
they have been ordered sequestered by Judge Donald A. McCartin. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, now 44, a Long Beach computer consultant, is on trial in Santa Ana 
charged with 16 murders of young men in Orange County between 1972 and 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors, 10 women and 2 men, not only have hundreds of exhibits to pore 
over, they have a multitude of verdict forms to complete. 
</P>
<P>
There are five forms for each of the 16 victims: guilty or not guilty of 
first-degree murder, second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter and 
involuntary manslaughter. Besides those, the jurors must decide on three 
additional charges: two counts of sodomy on two of the victims, and a count of 
mayhem on a third one. 
</P>
<P>
McCartin ordered the jury sequestered -- a rare step in modern criminal cases 
-- over the objections of Kraft's attorneys, who feared that jurors 
subconsciously would feel pressure to rush a verdict so they could return home. 
The Saturday deliberations were also highly unusual. McCartin said he would 
eliminate the Saturday sessions if the jurors objected, but none of them did. 
</P>
<P>
The judge has not disclosed the name of the hotel where the jurors are staying. 
McCartin also decided not to reveal which testimony the jurors had asked to 
have reread on Friday. Lawyers, in their closing arguments, urged jurors to 
have much of the testimony reread before deciding on verdicts on any of the 
murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft was arrested May 14, 1983, when two California Highway Patrol officers 
found a dead Marine in the front passenger seat of his car. That led to an 
investigation by Orange County law enforcement officials that resulted in 
prosecutors linking Kraft to a total of 45 murders in Southern California, 
Oregon and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
If Kraft is convicted, his trial would move into a penalty phase, where Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown will ask for a death verdict. The seven alternate 
jurors in the trial have been ordered not to discuss the case, even though they 
are not involved in the deliberations, because there is always a chance they 
could be placed on the regular jury during the penalty phase. 
</P>
<P>
Since testimony in the trial began in September, two of the regular jurors have 
had to leave the panel, one because of illness and a second on the judge's 
order after a request by defense lawyers, who learned she may have violated the 
judge's order not to discuss the case. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors are scheduled to resume their deliberations Monday morning at 9 a.m.

DISAPPOINTED GRATEFUL DEAD FANS ARRESTED AT CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 10 people were arrested Saturday night after about 100 police officers 
were brought in to control a crowd of about 500 disappointed fans who could not 
get into the Grateful Dead's concert at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine police Officer Bob Lennert said police moved in after fighting broke out 
between some members of the crowd and the concert's security officers. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the crowd broke up shortly after a dispersal order was issued at 8:30 
p.m. by Irvine police. The remainder left after about 100 officers -- who were 
called in by Irvine police from several surrounding communities -- began 
walking in formation toward the entrance to the concert, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers at the scene reported that some members of the crowd had been throwing 
rocks and bottles. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred about an hour after the concert began before 15,000 
people in the amphitheater.

Two Costa Mesa police officers climbed to the roof of a 3-story building and 
one tackled a woman who was threatening to jump Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the 29-year-old woman was hospitalized for observation. 
</P>
<P>
Officers Jim Wilke and Tim Starn arrived at the building at 132 Virginia Place 
at about 11:30 a.m. and climbed to just below the roof. The woman threatened to 
jump, but Wilke got close enough to tackle her, police said. 
</P>

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Ana police, called to the scene of an early-morning shooting Saturday, 
found one man dead and another seriously wounded after what neighbors said was 
an argument about drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred in the 1200 block of Highland Street around 3 a.m., 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The police said late Saturday that they had not yet identified the dead man, 
who had been shot twice. 
</P>
<P>
The other man, identified as Jose Rodriguez Nambo, 20, of Santa Ana, had been 
shot in the throat and was taken to United Western Medical Center-Anaheim, 
where he was listed in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said they found no weapons at the scene and are looking for other 
suspects.

DRUG-BUST PROCEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last Tuesday's public relations circus in which the President flew to the 
remote wilds of Orange County to present a large check representing drug-bust 
proceeds in front of 1,500 selected important citizens is a clear example of a 
shallow commitment to a better environment on the part of our government, and a 
thoughtless waste of taxpayer money by our county management. 
</P>
<P>
The pollution and expense of travel for the presidential party by jet and 
helicopter to the site, and the county's expense in improving roads with 
several hundred truckloads of gravel and removal of several old trees so that 
this crowd could be bused in with our newest buses to witness a helicopter 
landing on a remote ranch must nearly have equaled the value of that check. 
</P>
<P>
I should hope there were few drug abusers in this crowd to learn the error of 
their ways from this exciting spectacle. But the rest of us might be tempted to 
try drugs to blot out the silliness of this non-event. That ranch could be made 
into a good park or conference grounds for the public. Or it might be sold to 
help care for the perpetually under-funded county park system we have today.

DRUG-BUST PROCEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jeffrey Perlman's article (April 22) "Costly Preparations -- Drug Money to Pave 
Way for President" indicates that Sheriff Brad Gates will spend in excess of 
$100,000 for a photo opportunity that could have been scheduled in many other 
Orange County locations instead of in a remote country area requiring extensive 
and expensive preparation for probably less than 10% of this cost. 
</P>
<P>
We are so underfunded in our efforts to reduce drug use that such a waste of 
money is unconscionable. And the Republicans call the Democrats spendthrifts! 
</P>
<P>
We all welcome our President to Orange County, but this scenario makes no sense 
at all.

Is Gov. George Deukmejian fighting for the other side in the war against drugs? 
I suppose I shouldn't be shocked anymore when I find out about another 
irresponsible cut by Deukmejian in his budget, but when I read that he plans to 
close Juvenile Camps, cut drug rehabilitation funds and end numerous 
drug-prevention programs I blew my top ("Youth Camp Closures Seen as Result of 
Proposed Cuts," April 11). His myopic decision means thousands of delinquent 
youths will either be simply released or sent to other more crowded centers, 
increasing their detention costs in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
The removal of drug rehabilitation and prevention programs will certainly save 
a few dollars today, but will cost this state millions in the near future, as 
these youths are given no opportunity to get out of the vicious drug cycle and 
progress towards more drug use and violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
I was also astonished to find that our "victim's rights" governor has chosen to 
cut the nonexistent "surplus" from an underfunded victims compensation program. 
Is this another of his plans to fight crime and its repercussions? Do 
Californians agree with Deukmejian's vision of our state as a state having no 
planned parenthood, crippled emergency rooms, feeble mental health facilities, 
a lack of youth drug rehabilitation and prevention facilities? No reasonable 
person could. I certainly do not. 
</P>
<P>
I applaud The Times for its fair and informative coverage of the governor's 
budget proposals. His infantile rebuttals show just how low he can go.

THE POSSIBLE CLOSURE OF STATE'S JOPLIN YOUTH CENTER IN COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Hopping mad" under-describes my reaction to the possible closing of the Joplin 
Youth Center reported in your article (April 23). Before Gov. George Deukmejian 
and Supervisor Tom Riley continue to press for this unwarranted action, they 
should read a Los Angeles Times article (March 31) on the role Saddleback 
Kiwanis Club plays in helping to turn the Joplin boys around. 
</P>
<P>
Riley is quoted as saying: "I don't see how we could come up with the money . . 
. now." This is nonsense! Riley implies that he has other priorities. One can 
easily agree that a need exists to cut government spending. One can further 
agree that there are legitimate concerns about society and its will to get a 
handle on crime, delinquency and drug abuse before the fabric which holds it 
together comes apart. 
</P>
<P>
But solutions require priorities where they count most, where government funds 
have a reasonable chance to turn children and youth into productive and 
law-abiding citizens.

MEETING IN DORNAN'S OFFICE ON ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read Carol Gentry's letter to the editor (April 23) regarding her recent 
visit to Rep. Robert K. Dornan's office and, as a participant in that meeting, 
felt compelled to respond. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan's leading role in the pro-life movement is well known. Nevertheless, it 
is his policy to always make time for those holding opposing views on any 
issue. That is why, in his absence that day, the congressman directed me to 
meet with representatives from the National Organization for Women, the 
National Abortion Rights League and Planned Parenthood during their recent trip 
to Washington. Dr. Jerry Gideon sat in as well, since we both handle this issue 
for Congressman Dornan. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion is perhaps the most difficult issue for those with opposing views to 
find common ground on which to agree. For a brief period of time there were 
multiple discussions taking place. I think it is unfair to say that any 
individual was being "rude" or "loudly pontificated." It was simply a spirited 
discussion between two opposing sides -- something Gentry is very familiar with 
as a former Democratic candidate for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Gideon and I tried to make the point that the issue of abortion is not a matter 
of "choice" but of taking responsibility for conceiving a human being. Killing 
a child is not and can never be a matter of choice or convenience. Both sides 
know well that 99% of all abortions performed are for convenience and not to 
protect the life of the mother. 
</P>
<P>
In response to a question concerning abortions, Jerry responded that he 
believes that many women become emotional and physical victims after having an 
abortion. However, he stated quite clearly that the congressman does not 
believe that the woman should be treated as a "criminal." He added that when 
and if abortion becomes illegal there should be stiff criminal penalties for 
the physician only. 
</P>
<P>
I am sorry that the representatives of Planned Parenthood, the Abortion Rights 
League and NOW left the office with such a negative opinion. That was not the 
case when Planned Parenthood representatives met with Dornan last year and sent 
him a follow up letter of appreciation for that meeting. I fear, however, that 
in this instance these representatives are attempting, with their complaints, 
to make our disagreement on this critical issues purely gender-based. Women 
across the country are the power behind the pro-life movement just as they were 
in successfully stopping passage of the Equal Rights Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Any attempt to dismiss the pro-life movement as rooted in chauvinism and 
Victorian male-centered thought is not only seriously misguided but an act of 
evasion from the real issue in this debate -- protecting innocent life.

AMERICAN HISTORY, A SAGA OF IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Interesting letters on April 23 regarding Vietnamese immigrants. For instance, 
I wonder where Sal Giardino learned his American history? He never knew that 
there was no country called "Italy" in 1492? That Christopher Columbus was 
Genoese, not Italian, and that nobody on the Italian peninsula would give him a 
penny to make his famous trip? It was Spanish money, Spanish ships and Spanish 
sailors that made that trip possible, and Columbus claimed the land he found 
for the Queen of, yes, Spain! I have never understood why the Italians claim 
Columbus Day. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, it was the English who originally colonized our part of North 
America, and immigrants from Ireland, Germany, Scandinavia, Russia, Poland, 
China, Japan, Mexico, and, yes, even Italy, and on and on who settled, built, 
and are still building our beautiful country. When the first generation got 
here from any of these places they did nothing but hard work, which is exactly 
what the first generation of our new Asian immigrants is doing. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the "garish urban-blight type buildings" Jennifer T. Moore 
complains about. Now, which of us can remember the failing businesses, sleazy 
used-car lots, trashy signs and vacant lots that lined Garden Grove and 
Westminster Boulevards before the Asians began building? And what do we have 
now? Clean, interesting, successful businesses that generate a lot of tax 
money. Personally I prefer the latter. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose as much as anything we should feel pity for people who are so 
profoundly ignorant of the country they proudly call their own. The immigrants 
who don't "succeed" are criticized for "living off our welfare system"; the 
ones that do succeed are criticized for having the nerve to actually get 
"rich." 
</P>
<P>
What a pity the grandparents of the Giardinos and Moores and others of their 
attitude aren't around to remind them of how they were treated when they came 
here "yearning to be free." What a pity that so many of us still don't 
understand what the inscription on the Statue of Liberty really means!

AMERICAN HISTORY, A SAGA OF IMMIGRANTS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading the editorial letters "Westminster Vietnamese and Former CIA 
Chief" (April 23), I was totally disgusted at a few negative letters 
criticizing an ethnic group: the Vietnamese in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Being one of the "boat people" a few years back and now a U.S. citizen, I am 
very proud of my adopted country, the United States, as the country with the 
greatest history of immigration. 
</P>
<P>
Our ancestors, as well as our people today, have welcomed millions of 
immigrants from the poor countries, war torn lands and even our former enemy 
countries, to come over here to fulfill their American dreams. Because this is 
the land of freedom and opportunities, the land of liberty and justice, we are 
proud to call ourselves Americans.

PORTLAND IN TEMPORARY DILEMMA; 
</P>
<P>
BUT LAKERS MAY ADD PERMANENCE TO ADELMAN'S STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More immediate concerns occupy Rick Adelman's thoughts these days than his 
interim status as coach of the Portland Trail Blazers. Instead, his concern is 
how to prevent his team from being a victim of another Laker onslaught today in 
Game 2 of the National Basketball Assn. Western Conference quarterfinals in the 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
But, still Adelman wonders whether he will lose that interim qualifier or 
simply lose his job if and when the Trail Blazers are ousted from the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
A strong showing today (12:30, Channel 2), after an unimpressive performance in 
Thursday night's opening-game loss, certainly won't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, quick elimination against the two-time defending NBA 
champions might have the opposite effect. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing they've told me is that they're going to make the decision when 
the season's over," said Adelman, who grew up in Downey and played at Loyola 
Marymount. "That's all that's been said. I just try to take it one day at a 
time and do the best you can do. It's something you can't control at this 
point." 
</P>
<P>
After six seasons as an assistant and two months as a head coach, Adelman has 
the necessary coaching cliches memorized. He has also turned the Trail Blazers 
into a happier, more cohesive unit after a half-season of trade requests and 
friction under Coach Mike Schuler. 
</P>
<P>
The players are seemingly playing as much for Adelman, 42, as for themselves, 
something that couldn't be said during the latter stages of Jack Ramsay's long 
tenure and almost all of the Schuler's 2 1/2-season reign as head coach. 
</P>
<P>
Adelman, who played for Portland in the early 1970s, is as flexible as Schuler 
was strident, as unflappable as Ramsay was intense. But players say he has 
taken charge and gained the respect of the team. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a lot happier under Rick," said guard Clyde Drexler, who feuded with 
Schuler and barely co-existed with Ramsay. "The guys feel they can relax more 
and play the game. I think if we played well (against the Lakers) it would 
really improve his status. 
</P>
<P>
"But either way, I think Rick deserves the job." 
</P>
<P>
Owner Paul Allen has remained noncommittal. 
</P>
<P>
However, rumors are circulating that Charlotte Hornet Coach Dick Harter, 
formerly of the University of Oregon, or former Cleveland and Golden State 
Coach George Karl, will take over next season. Other names being heard are Dick 
Motta and Bill Fitch, who last held jobs at Dallas and Houston. Adelman's case 
has not been strengthen by the fact the Trail Blazers were 14-21 under him 
after going 25-22 under Schuler. But Drexler and other players point out that 
Adelman took over during the roughest part of the schedule and that the team 
had a lot of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really unfair how he (Adelman) was thrown into the job," Drexler said. 
"He had the toughest part of the schedule. Kiki Vandeweghe had just been traded 
(to New York). I think Rick deserves a shot at a full year, going into training 
camp with his way of doing things. Then, I think he'd prove he was a very good 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
"When you think about it, we've had guys you don't know whether they are going 
to play or not. We haven't had this team together long enough to get any kind 
of consistency. That's not Rick's fault." 
</P>
<P>
Adelman, however, may not be absolved by management if the Trail Blazers lose 
the next two games to the Lakers and are eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, Adelman believes he should be rehired regardless of the outcome of 
this series. Adelman, unassuming even while stalking the sidelines, said he 
cannot prove his worth unless given time to implement his system. 
</P>
<P>
"When you take over a team in the middle of a year, it's really difficult 
because you don't start the season, you have your own ideas of what you want to 
do," he said. "We had a lot of things go on, and players out with injuries. 
It's been a really tough year." 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't figure to get much easier for the Trail Blazers today, although they 
have had two days to regroup after a 128-108 loss in Game 1. In that game, 
center Kevin Duckworth got in early foul trouble and eventually fouled out with 
only five points. Steve Johnson basically was ineffective against Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar and Mychal Thompson. Sam Bowie, who had 15 points, is doubtful 
today because of a flare-up of his right ankle injury. And power forward 
Caldwell Jones went without points and rebounds but managed to play strong 
defense against A.C. Green. 
</P>
<P>
The inside game is perhaps Portland's only advantage, but the Trail Blazers 
must make their outside shots to open the middle allowing Duckworth to post-up 
and Drexler and Jerome Kersey to drive to the basket. That didn't happen in 
Game 1, when the Trail Blazers made just 46% of their shots. 
</P>
<P>
Adelman said Saturday that the Trail Blazers have two troublesome areas -- 
offense and defense. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave them a lot of easy opportunities for shots," Adelman said. "When you 
give the Lakers a chance to get the ball up court with Magic, they are hard to 
stop. We were also giving Byron Scott open shots. That's a lack of (defensive) 
concentration. 
</P>
<P>
"We also need to make sure we get decent shots and try to control the tempo of 
the game. If there's a bright spot, it's that I don't think we played well (in 
Game 1) and we still closed to within five points a couple times. If we play to 
our capabilities, we can play with the Lakers." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers said they would not take the Trail Blazers for granted after the 
Game 1 blowout. Forward James Worthy, among others, said he expects Portland to 
move the ball inside to Duckworth and try to establish an inside game. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Coach Pat Riley reminded his players that, in terms of talent, the Trail 
Blazers are not a typical first-round opponent. 
</P>
<P>
And Riley, who played with Adelman with the San Diego Rockets in the late 
1960s, said he believes Adelman could turn the Trail Blazers around next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Rick will be an excellent coach," Riley said. "I always remember him 
as serious-minded as a player, very intelligent. He has a great demeanor to 
deal with players, and he deserves a full year to see what he can do. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of hidden baggage (dissension, rebellion) with that team that 
didn't have anything to do with Rick." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Laker guard Byron Scott missed his second straight practice with a sore right 
wrist, and Scott said Saturday he is not sure whether he will play today. 
However, this is a chronic condition, and Scott most likely will play. 
"Hopefully, I can play," said Scott, who had 29 points in Game 1. "But it's so 
bad that I might not. We're treating it twice a day, so maybe I'll be all right 
for the game." . . . Magic Johnson, who missed Friday's practice with a bruised 
right knee, practiced Saturday and will play today. . . . Portland reserve 
center Sam Bowie did not practice again Saturday, and the Trail Blazers said 
they will not know until game-time whether he will be available. "The schedule, 
with two days off between games, really helps Sam," Trail Blazer trainer Mike 
Shimensky said. . . . According to Coach Rick Adelman's calculations, the Trail 
Blazers attempted 67 of their 95 shots in Game 1 after making only one or two 
passes. "When you're shooting 38%, you can't do that," Adelman said. "We were 
playing right into the Lakers' hands. We have to move the ball around more." . 
. . Laker Coach Pat Riley on his team's defensive strategy against Portland: 
"We can't let them be a three-pronged team and give them the layups, post-up 
game and jumpers. So, you shut off one or two areas (the inside game) and make 
them beat you from somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Will the Lakers be overconfident after posting a 20-point victory in Game 1? 
"I'd love for that to happen," Adelman said. "But they've been through this too 
many times to act like that." Added guard Clyde Drexler: "That's a possibility. 
They might take us lightly. But we still have the same mentality. We still 
think we can beat them." . . . Trail Blazer players spent Friday night enjoying 
the diversities of Southern California. A few went to Disneyland and then to 
the Angels-Toronto Blue Jays game. And four players -- Drexler, Kevin 
Duckworth, Terry Porter and Bowie -- watched the taping of the Arsenio Hall 
Show in Hollywood. "I can't control what the players are going to do," Adelman 
said. "I think Utah (last spring) came in and saw the town and then won here. 
Maybe, go ahead and do it. Maybe we'll win." . . . Laker guard Michael Cooper, 
who had headaches after running into a railing in the Forum and requiring 21 
stitches, said he is feeling no pain now. "Gary (Vitti, the trainer) gave me a 
little better headache pill than, uh, Advil," Cooper said. "It certainly 
alleviated the headache."

PAQUETTE POWERS GOLDEN WEST PAST ORANGE COAST, 10-9

<P>
It took four home runs and four pitchers, but Golden West College held on for a 
10-9 victory over Orange Coast in an Orange Empire Conference baseball game 
Saturday at OCC. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West got a solo home run and a grand slam from Craig Paquette and solo 
home runs from Ken Lynch and Frank Herman to help build a 10-3 lead going into 
the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
But OCC rallied for four runs in the seventh to chase starter Toby Foreman, who 
was replaced by Dave Turner. Turner was then replaced by Todd Long, who got the 
final out in the seventh. OCC loaded the bases with two outs in the eighth, but 
Larry Perry flied out to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Long retired the first batter in the ninth, but hit Mike Kelly and Hector Santa 
Cruz and was replaced by Ken Pope. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Nixon grounded into a force play to leave runners on first and third with 
two outs. Kelly scored and Nixon went to second when Pope made a wild pickoff 
throw to first base. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Young singled to score Nixon and make the score 10-9, and continued to 
second when right-fielder Steve McKowen let the ball get past him. With first 
base open, Golden West Coach Burt Villarreal had Scott Talanoa, who leads the 
conference with 16 homes runs, walked intentionally. Pope then got Marty 
Cordova to ground into a force play for the final out. 
</P>
<P>
The victory moves Golden West (19-13-1 overall and 13-8 in conference play) 
back into the playoff race. Golden West is two games behind first-place Rancho 
Santiago (26-13, 15-6), a game behind second-place Cypress (28-13, 14-7) and 
one-half game behind third-place OCC (27-11-1, 14-8) with three games left. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the conference will get an automatic berth into the Southern 
California Regional playoffs, and the second- and third-place teams most likely 
will get at-large berths because of the overall strength of the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West plays host to Cypress Tuesday and is at Rancho Santiago Thursday. 
Riverside is at Golden West in the final conference game Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback is at OCC Tuesday and OCC is at Fullerton Thursday. The Pirates have 
a bye Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been calling it hell week all season," Villarreal said about playing 
conference powerhouses OCC, Cypress and Rancho Santiago in consecutive games. 
"But other teams are doing it, too. We knew if we didn't win today, we were 
through. Now we have life for at least one more day." 
</P>
<P>
Paquette started the scoring with a solo home run in the third. OCC tied it in 
the third on a throwing error by Paquette. But Paquette came back and hit a 
grand slam on a changeup from OCC starter John Douris in the fourth, but it was 
an at-bat he never should have gotten. 
</P>
<P>
With two on and two out, McKowen hit a sharp grounder to shortstop Mike Van 
Blaricom, who booted it for an error. Paquette followed with a fly ball that 
just got over the left-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth time Paquette, who has 11 home runs, has hit two in one game 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch and Mike Willie had RBI singles and Herman had an RBI groundout as Golden 
West scored three more times in the fifth to take an 8-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Young had an RBI single in the fifth and Kelly had an RBI double in the sixth 
as OCC cut the lead to 8-3. Herman and Lynch hit home runs in the seventh and 
Golden West led, 10-3. Eddie Pierce had a two-run single and Perry had an RBI 
triple and scored on a wild pitch as OCC cut the lead to 10-7 in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress 12, Riverside 8 -- Chris Hunt hit a grand slam, Jim Short hit a two-run 
home run and Bobby Thome hit a solo home run for Cypress, which moved into 
second place. Jason Friedman had a two-run single for Cypress, which built a 
12-3 lead going into the ninth. Dennis Burbank (11-4) pitched the first seven 
innings for the victory. Riverside is 6-25-1, 3-18-1. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback 5, Fullerton 4 -- Brent Ferguson hit a three-run home run in the 
seventh to help Saddleback (15-16-1, 7-13-1) defeat host Fullerton (12-24, 
7-15). Ferguson's homer gave Saddleback a 4-3 lead. Eric Patton got the 
victory, allowing seven hits in eight innings.

MORE FROM MORELAND; 
</P>
<P>
WHEN HE LEFT SAN DIEGO FOR THE DETROIT TIGERS, HE DID NOT GO QUIETLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Keith Moreland, San Diego's favorite ex-Padre, returned last week to the land 
he says made him goofy: Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
He was toting a blue duffel bag that said "Detroit Tigers." He stood in Anaheim 
Stadium, about 100 miles north of San Diego, where he was previously employed 
by the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
"I've played 11 years in the big leagues now," he said, "and one in the minor 
leagues in between. And that was in San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
It has been six months since Moreland and Chris Brown were traded for pitcher 
Walt Terrell. In that time, Moreland's soft, Texas drawl has uttered some of 
the most acerbic lines about San Diego this side of Chicago Tribune columnist 
Mike Royko. 
</P>
<P>
The day Moreland was traded to Detroit, he said he was "going back to the big 
leagues." This spring, he told columnist Mitch Albom of the Detroit Free Press 
that walking into San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium was "like walking into a spring 
training B game." 
</P>
<P>
And Moreland, 34, hasn't stopped swinging despite the fact that he swung 
himself right out of Detroit's everyday lineup with an embarrassing spring 
training. His spring batting average (.119) turned him into a platoon 
designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
"I was ecstatic to be traded from San Diego," Moreland reiterated. "I did not 
want to be there, I didn't like it from the start, and I do not like it now." 
</P>
<P>
Moreland hasn't hit anything hard yet this season (11 singles, one extra-base 
hit), but he was swinging hard now. On the subject of San Diego, he went for 
the cycle -- hitting the city, the fans, the organization and even Yuma, Ariz., 
the Padre spring training home. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just not conducive to good baseball," Moreland said of San Diego. 
"There's too much to do. The fans are not into it, and the organization itself 
doesn't know anything about the game of baseball. I hated it." 
</P>
<P>
The organization? 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who would have the top management they had when I was there," Moreland 
said. "Chub Feeney . . . it was amazing. It's not oriented around a winning 
tradition. It's just, 'Hey, we're a big league team, we're going to go out and 
play ball.' 
</P>
<P>
"And the fans are rooting for the other team. Everybody down there is a 
transplant. The Mets come in, and there are 20,000 people rooting for the Mets. 
It seemed like we were on the road all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Moreland does not hesitate to say what's on his mind. He already has 
said that if Detroit isn't planning on playing him every day, he wishes they'd 
"get me out of here." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, sure, I'd much rather be in a situation where I could play every day, but 
I'm not going to scream and holler about it," he said. "I'd much rather be 
someplace where I'm playing, either the field or DH, every day. But I don't 
make the decisions, and I'm not upset at anybody. I just want to play." 
</P>
<P>
He is not playing largely because of what happened this spring, a time when he 
raised eyebrows around the Tiger camp in Lakeland, Fla., for all the wrong 
reasons -- the .119 average (seven for 51), the two doubles without a home run 
and the three runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a dead spring, to be honest," said Vada Pinson, Detroit's batting 
coach. "Rigor mortis had set in. Quite a few people were concerned. I know I 
was. I just didn't see him being aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
The point where concern seeped into conversation, and conversation turned into 
action, came one morning about the fourth week of spring training. A handful of 
Tigers were on the bench before a B game, and Pinson and Moreland started 
talking. 
</P>
<P>
"There comes a time when you say, 'OK, it's time to turn it on now.' We were 
sitting on the bench, and I asked him about things," Pinson recalled. "He had a 
blank stare like he was confused. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I'm looking at you when I talk to you, looking for eye contact. I didn't 
get any. He was staring out at the field. He admitted he didn't know what he 
was doing." 
</P>
<P>
After that game, Pinson and Moreland made the first of two trips to the batting 
cage. The second came later in the week. Pinson was standing by the clubhouse 
when he heard someone call out his name. It was Moreland. 
</P>
<P>
"He was standing flat-footed at the plate," Pinson said. "You use your hips to 
guide the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Moreland said he tried to do some things differently in spring training. He 
also said his shoulder, which he injured last year, was still tender. 
</P>
<P>
He experimented with standing in different locations in the batter's box and 
trying to do various things with the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you shouldn't mess with success or try to change anything you've done, 
but once in a while you try to see if something different might work for you," 
Moreland said. "I lost my idea of how to approach hitting." 
</P>
<P>
By the time Moreland's swing and shoulder were fixed, he had been supplanted at 
first base by rookie Torey Lovullo, a 1987 All-American at UCLA. Thus, Moreland 
became the first major leaguer to be replaced by a guy whose father was the 
producer of the old television series "Hee Haw." 
</P>
<P>
Manager Sparky Anderson was enamored with Lovullo and told Moreland and Dave 
Bergman that they wouldn't be getting as much action at first base as they 
would like. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been honest with both of them," Anderson said. "That's the only way to do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
So Moreland has been sharing the designated hitter duties with Bergman and Pat 
Sheridan. Although he's hitting .273 (12 for 44), he has 11 singles, one double 
and just two RBIs. And he has more stolen bases (two) this season than extra 
base hits (one). Not much power for a power kind of guy. 
</P>
<P>
"I just haven't had the right situations," Moreland said. "I've hit some balls 
good, but we've been in cold weather. Our whole team has been hitting the ball 
extremely hard. We played a whole series in Milwaukee (April 21-23) where we 
could have had a bunch of extra-base hits. Playing in a place like California, 
some of those balls would have been extra-base hits." 
</P>
<P>
Ah, California. The place where Moreland dropped from a career-high 27 home 
runs in 1987 with the Cubs to five for the Padres in 1988. He finished the year 
batting .256 with 64 RBIs. He went 67 games, from June 2 through Sept. 5, 
without a homer. When he finally hit one in San Francisco, he turned a 
cartwheel. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just stupidity on my part," Moreland said. "I've never done anything 
and never will again to show up another team. It had just been 200 and some 
at-bats without a home run, and it was like, 'Hey, I finally hit a home run.' 
</P>
<P>
"It was a freak of nature that playing down there will get you into." 
</P>
<P>
Playing down there in San Diego, where it's like a spring training B game? 
</P>
<P>
"Exactly," Moreland said. "That's exactly the way it is. There was nobody (in 
the stadium), and the people who were there didn't know what was going on. It 
was pretty much a case of putting in your three hours and getting the hell out 
of Dodge. That's all it is down there, and all it's ever going to be as far as 
I'm concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"There may be people who think it's a great organization, and that's great for 
them. But I personally couldn't stand it. It started in Yuma, Ariz. Anybody who 
has to go to Yuma can figure out that it's going to be a rather rough 
situation. And it progressively gets worse. I was elated to leave. They were 
probably elated to get rid of me." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego might be out of Moreland's sight, but it's certainly not out of his 
mind. He admits to reading the papers to follow the team -- or, at least, some 
of the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I follow Randy Ready and John Kruk," Moreland said. "They are two really good 
guys. I've looked in the box scores every day to see how they've done. I wish 
both of them the very best. As far as the other end of it, I could care less."

BRAJDAS: AN EARLY RISER; 
</P>
<P>
'MUNDANE PRODUCTS' DELIVER FOR FIRM MAKING ITS DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Brajdas Corp., which zoomed into the ranks of The Times 100 at the No. 4 spot, 
admittedly but unintentionally has a low profile. Despite commendable results, 
a company official says, Brajdas has failed to make some lists of top 
California companies simply because publications literally haven't heard of it. 
</P>
<P>
"We distribute mundane products," said Allan Klein, vice president, chief 
financial officer and chief operating officer of the distributor of electronic 
components, with offices in Warner Center in Woodland Hills. "Unless you are a 
monster company with hundreds of millions of dollars in sales, distribution 
does not get a lot of notice." 
</P>
<P>
By those standards, Brajdas (pronounced Braddas), with $61.4 million in 1988 
sales, is well shy of the monster status of industry leader Avnet Inc., which 
had about $1.8 billion in 1988 sales. But Brajdas' average return on equity 
during the past two years has been a monstrously good 48%. (Last year, the 
company did not meet The Times 100 list's sales criterion.) 
</P>
<P>
Brajdas, actually a holding company for several distributors, sells connectors, 
sockets, switches and semiconductors to 10,000 small and medium-sized 
manufacturers of computer, aerospace and medical equipment in eight Western 
states. 
</P>
<P>
Its biggest customer is Sun Microsystems, which has maintained a loyal tie 
because Brajdas was the only distributor that would sell to Sun when it was a 
garage start-up. Klein considers Brajdas' strength to be "small orders 
delivered promptly." 
</P>
<P>
Brajdas' results belie the company's modest beginnings. It sprang to life from 
a Monrovia company, Micro-Z, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 
in 1983 after sales of its computerized reservations systems dried up. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills venture capitalist Jack Salzberg helped the company through 
bankruptcy proceedings with a $500,000 loan. He bought two electronics 
components distributors and renamed the company Brajdas, combining the initials 
of his children and grandchildren. The company's chief division is Cypress 
Electronics, which has major branches in Buena Park and Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, Salzberg, who served as chairman, president and chief executive, 
severed his ties with the company, surrendering his titles and selling his 
shares, for a tidy $2-million profit, to partner Donald Zimmerman. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman is president of Barclay &amp; Co., a rich San Francisco investment 
firm that owns 58% of Brajdas. Beyond that, about 25% of Brajdas is in the 
hands of "a very few people," Klein said. The remaining 400,000 or so shares 
are held by about 3,000 investors, many of them unsecured creditors of Micro-Z 
who were paid off in stock. 
</P>
<P>
Challenges lie ahead, however. Segments of the electronics industry are 
experiencing a slowdown in growth. The slump in semiconductors eroded margins 
and contributed to a recent steep earnings drop, although Klein maintains now 
that "we think of ourselves as doing well, against the trend." 
</P>
<P>
And Klein realizes that the company will have to expand beyond its regional 
scope within the next year if it is to grow. 
</P>
<P>
But by far the biggest risk, he noted, is the company's hefty revolving debt. 
To finance its growing business and reduce its debt, Brajdas is constantly 
"going to the bank" for loans, and rising interest rates have been damaging the 
bottom line. Although growth thus appears to be a two-edged sword, Klein points 
to "extremely strong and deep" backing from Barclay &amp; Co. as a saving 
grace.

CHEVRON RETURNS AS MOST PROFITABLE FIRM, HELPED BY DECLINE IN PRICE OF OIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The volatile oil situation didn't cramp Chevron's style in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The giant San Francisco-based energy concern, which dwarfs most other oil 
companies, topped The Times 100 list of 25 companies with the biggest bottom 
lines in 1988, reclaiming the lead from its much smaller rival, Atlantic 
Richfield. 
</P>
<P>
Like other major oil companies, Chevron reaped the benefits of having extensive 
refining and gasoline marketing, or "downstream," operations that thrive on 
cheap crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
"Downstream had probably its best year ever," said Kenneth T. Derr, who on Jan. 
1 became chairman and chief executive of Chevron. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron's profit of $1.768 billion on revenue of $25.2 billion, down slightly 
from 1987, reflected high margins in its gasoline business, which benefited 
during the last three quarters of 1988 from declining crude oil prices and 
strong demand from drivers. In addition, Derr said, the company had an 
excellent year in the chemical business, where supply and demand finally came 
into balance after "years of struggle" and oversupply. 
</P>
<P>
Truth be told, Los Angeles-based Arco technically held the lead spot only 
temporarily last year. Soon after The Times 100 list was published, Chevron 
restated its earnings to allow for accounting changes. The restated figure of 
$1.25 billion for 1987, up from the $1.007 billion initially reported, would 
have topped Arco's $1.224 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The same factors that drove Chevron's figures higher also helped Arco, noted M. 
Craig Schwerdt, an analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities in Los Angeles. So far 
this year, the recent oil spill in Alaska and other short-term factors have 
caused spectacular run-ups in crude prices, but, Schwerdt said, "refining 
margins have kept up." So "integrated companies" such as Chevron and Arco, he 
said, "are doing very well indeed right at the present." 
</P>
<P>
A third oil company, Occidental Petroleum, made the list at No. 17, up two 
spots from last year. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell, a big defense and aerospace company with headquarters in El Segundo, 
made the list in fifth place. The company was formerly based in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
California's major banks, unchained by writeoffs on foreign loans, staged a 
powerful comeback in 1988. Security Pacific Corp., in seventh place, is one of 
the big commercial banks that roared back to life in 1988 after hard times in 
1987. And formerly troubled BankAmerica Corp. surged back into the black in 
1988 after three years of heavy losses, making the list at No. 9. Wells Fargo 
came in No. 11. 
</P>
<P>
High-tech firms, including old-timers such as Hewlett-Packard and Intel, also 
turned in an improved showing, reflecting their industry's fast growth in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Hewlett-Packard, which moved up two places to No. 4, enjoyed strong growth and 
acceptance of its basic backbone products -- computer systems used in offices 
and laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
Semiconductor maker Intel, which placed 23rd last year, moved to No. 12. Its 
proprietary chips, used in many of the nation's leading personal computers, 
contributed to the overall gains in technology at other companies as well. 
</P>
<P>
Amdahl, a maker of big mainframe computers that compete with IBM's, made the 
list because of a strong recovery in profit. The company benefited from 
confusion among customers over new product lines and production delays at IBM. 
</P>
<P>
And Apple Computer moved ahead three spots to No. 13, reaping the rewards of 
greater acceptance among offices and school campuses of its user-friendly 
Macintosh computer. 
</P>
<P>
Signs of belt-tightening are surfacing at Teledyne, a conglomerate that makes a 
range of products from shower heads to defense electronics. The Los 
Angeles-based company sank to No. 14 from ninth place last year in profit and 
reported a shrinking need for workers.

GORDON CAMPBELL GETS SWEET REVENGE ON DOUBTERS WITH CASH-RICH CHIPS &amp; 
TECHNOLOGIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When Gordon A. Campbell went in search of seed money for a high-tech start-up 
in 1985, he talked to 60 venture capital companies. All turned him down -- 
partly because of his spotty track record. 
</P>
<P>
Many are probably kicking themselves around the block today. Campbell's 
venture, Chips &amp; Technologies, zoomed to the top of The Times 100 list, 
making an impressive debut with a two-year average of 66.5% in return on 
equity, the profit a company earns for each dollar that shareholders invest. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for a little venture that scraped by in a tough first year with $1.5 
million of initial financing. Not bad for an outfit that started with Campbell 
and one assistant, and now has 450 employees. Not bad for a bootstrap upstart 
with $12.7 million in 1986 sales that one high-tech analyst projects will top 
$215 million in sales for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the San Jose-based firm did not even qualify because it did not meet 
the criterion for length of public ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, 44, humbly acknowledges that luck might have had a little to do with 
this raging success. Chips &amp; Technologies was in the right place at the 
right time with a technology that made possible the production of inexpensive 
clones of IBM personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
At the time the company got its start, PC clone makers needed 150 chips to make 
one computer. Chips &amp; Technologies devised sets of chips that performed 
more functions but reduced the number of components. 
</P>
<P>
"It saved manufacturers money and gave them higher performance and more 
features," said Campbell, chairman, president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
High-powered customers such as Wyse Technology, AST Research, Tandy and others 
took to the new product immediately. By Campbell's estimate, Chips &amp; 
Technologies now has 70% of its market. 
</P>
<P>
"Chips &amp; Technologies was a crucial piece in the development of clones," 
said Benny Lorenzo, an analyst with the Volpe &amp; Covington investment firm 
in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Chips &amp; Technologies is loaded with cash and has very little debt. For 
fiscal 1989, Lorenzo expects the company to have gross margins of more than 50% 
and net margins of more than 14%, compared to net margins of about 5% for the 
average Standard &amp; Poor's 500 company. (Gross margin, which is expressed as 
a percentage of gross revenues, is sales minus the costs of producing the 
goods. Net margin is the profit left after also paying taxes and costs for 
administration, marketing, and research and development.) 
</P>
<P>
Campbell acknowledges that giant semiconductor companies could eventually try 
to squeeze out their small rival, but, he notes, "they gave us a head start." 
</P>
<P>
For Campbell, a former Intel marketing executive, the success of Chips &amp; 
Technologies has been sweet revenge. Several years ago, with lofty ambitions 
and millions of dollars in venture capital, he left Intel and founded Seeq 
Technology. 
</P>
<P>
Intel sued, contending that Campbell and his colleagues would illegally be 
using Intel technology to begin their business. The suit was settled out of 
court. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell developed a reputation for a lavish management style, with elegant 
headquarters and expensive parties featuring entertainers such as Ray Charles. 
The company, meanwhile, was not measuring up to its backers' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
When Seeq nearly foundered, the venture capitalists were so annoyed that they 
booted him out. Later, nobody would touch Campbell's new venture, according to 
Richard A. Schaffer, publisher of the Technologic Computer Letter in New York. 
(Under different management, Seeq is now staging a comeback.) 
</P>
<P>
After Chips &amp; Technologies started booming, though, Campbell got letters 
from some of those venture capitalists.

Frustrated by the slow pace at which Xerox brought out new products, John E. 
Warnock and Charles M. Geschke six years ago left Xerox's Palo Alto Research 
Center and struck out on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by Hambrecht &amp; Quist, a high-tech venture capital firm, the two 
technical wizards borrowed the name of the creek that ran in back of their 
homes in Los Altos, Calif., and created a software company that has become one 
of the wonders of Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Adobe Systems, based in Mountain View, has nearly doubled its sales every year. 
From $2.5 million in 1984, the company has grown to $83.5 million in revenue in 
1988. On The Times 100 list, the company scored third with a two-year average 
return on equity of 55.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Like other high-tech counterparts at the top of the list, Adobe made its debut 
on The Times 100. (The company, which went public in 1986, did not meet the 
criterion for public ownership for inclusion on last year's list.) And like 
Chips &amp; Technologies, which emerged as No. 1, Adobe's success has come 
primarily from one product that dovetailed with a pressing need that had not 
previously been met. 
</P>
<P>
Simply put, Adobe's PostScript software made desktop publishing possible by 
enabling laser printers, typesetting equipment and other such devices to 
produce pages integrating text and graphics. The product has become 
indispensable for advertising agencies, packaging designers, newspaper art 
departments and businesses that publish their own brochures and reports. 
</P>
<P>
Today, 80% of the company's sales come from royalties on the product. 
</P>
<P>
"The printing solutions that we've brought to the market give you enormous 
productivity over traditional typesetting," said Warnock, 48, Adobe's chairman 
and chief executive. "It's a cost-benefit thing." 
</P>
<P>
Customers include most big computer and printer makers, such as IBM, 
Hewlett-Packard and Digital Equipment Corp., Ricoh, Canon and Fujitsu. An 
important partner is Apple Computer, which uses the product extensively for its 
Macintosh and Apple LaserWriter and accounts for 25% of Adobe's sales. It also 
holds 17% of the company. Apple founder Steven Jobs has also licensed the 
product for his Next line of computers. 
</P>
<P>
Adobe is also finding markets for other software programs. With Display 
PostScript, graphic elements can be rotated, scaled, skewed or otherwise 
adjusted on the screen. The company also has put together collections of more 
than 300 Roman typefaces, as well as two Japanese Kanji fonts that could prove 
a boon to the company if Japanese demand explodes. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Q. T. Wiles, a 69-year-old general partner at Hambrecht 
&amp; Quist, resigned as chairman of Adobe. But, analysts point out, he had 
little hand in the day-to-day operations and, with Warnock and Geschke in 
place, the management team is intact. 
</P>
<P>
"Thus far, they've done an outstanding job," said Bruce M. Lupatkin, senior 
technology analyst with Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Given their near-monopoly, however, they should be prepared for "assaults from 
all sides" as other companies might try to seize some of their lucrative 
business, Lupatkin said. "Copyright and patent law are never strong enough" to 
protect intellectual property, Warnock acknowledged. The company is lobbying 
with the U.S. Copyright Office to get some protection for typeface designs, 
which have no protection under current laws. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Warnock noted, the annual doubling of revenue is undoubtedly a thing 
of the past. Analysts project 1989 sales at $120 million or so, still a sizable 
increase. But Adobe could be vulnerable as growth in the computer business 
slows from the heated pace of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Warnock is mindful that high-tech success stories can sour in a hurry. "In the 
computer business," he said, "if you ever think you have a formula for success, 
you'd better figure out how to change it from year to year."

They are small and maybe years away from reaching their full potential, but 
exotic high-technology firms in the Golden State continue to be popular among 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
A ranking of "Wall Street's Favorites" among California stocks -- measured by 
comparing a company's value in the stock market to its total sales -- is 
dominated by firms on the cutting edge of technology. The story was much the 
same in last year's ranking. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the firms are in biotechnology. Cetus Corp., ranked No. 6, has focused 
on products, such as Proleukin interleukin-2, which are aimed at attacking 
cancer and infectious diseases. Reflecting the volatility of the industry, 
though, Genentech sank to No. 19 from No. 2 on last year's list -- its 
anti-blood clot drug having fallen short of expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Medical technology firms in general were also favorites. Alza Corp., ranked No. 
4, sells products that allow the controlled release of drugs into the body over 
an extended period. One product, for example, is attached to the skin behind 
the ear and releases medicine through the skin and into the bloodstream. 
</P>
<P>
New and fast-growing companies, like those in biotechnology, generally show up 
as big favorites when their stocks' value is measured against sales. With sales 
expected to soar in the future, investors tend to bid up stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the more familiar price-earnings ratio, which measures price per share 
divided by earnings per share, the market value-sales ratio is determined by 
dividing a firm's market value by annual sales or revenues. The ratio is 
considered more stable and perhaps more reliable because a company's earnings 
can change dramatically because of one-time gains or losses. Small start-ups 
also tend to have an artificially high price-earnings ratio because their 
profits tend to be small or non-existent. 
</P>
<P>
The market value-sales ratio is best suited "when looking at fast-growing 
companies," said Kevin Colosimo, vice president of MZ Group, which compiled the 
information for The Times. "It is useful when examining companies that don't 
have earnings yet." 
</P>
<P>
But some of the firms on the list do not fall into the high-growth category. 
No. 1 Tejon Ranch Co., involved mostly in ranching, owns 270,000 acres north of 
Los Angeles. The attraction here is not sales but the potential value of the 
land when it becomes developed for commercial or residential use. (Tejon Ranch 
is 50% owned by Times Mirror Co., publisher of The Times, and by affiliates of 
Times Mirror.) 
</P>
<P>
Those companies that fare poorly when measured by the market value-sales ratio 
are those firms deemed to have relatively poor prospects for future growth. 
Some of these companies on the "Wall Street's Forlorn" list include Gibraltar 
Financial Corp., ranked No. 1, which recently filed for bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
Investors were apparently troubled by the reduction of a major government 
contract for Perceptronics of Woodland Hills. Ranked No. 15, the firm depends 
for most of its revenue on government research contracts for computer 
simulation and training. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street took a dim view of potential sales growth at Los Angeles-based 
Carter Hawley Hale Stores, ranked No. 11, according to retail analyst Sarah 
Stack at Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, a Los Angeles brokerage firm. 
</P>
<P>
Investors may also be turned off because Carter Hawley, owner of the Broadway 
department stores, has made itself a tough takeover target, in part because of 
its high level of debt. The owners of Carter Hawley, Stack said, have 
"basically insulated themselves against any takeover." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WALL STREET'S FAVORITES 
</P>
<P>
Companies with highest ratio of stock market value to sales.

<P>
You don't necesarily have to be high tech to be a hot stock. The high flyers on 
Wall Street included a wide range of California companies, among them the 
state's largest bank, a maker of swimming pools and fishing tackle, and an 
exotic lingerie maker. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the shares of California high-technology firms were among the 
fastest rising. Cadence Design Systems, a computer software company, saw its 
stock soar 119% for the year ended April 3. 
</P>
<P>
But Cadence was the only high-tech firm among the top 10 stocks on the 
"Charging Ahead" list that posted the greatest increases in value. Last year, 
seven companies involved in high technology dominated the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
Investors "believe the only way to make meaningful gains in the stock market is 
to invest in high tech," said securities analyst David S. Leibowitz at American 
Securities, a New York brokerage firm. "That's part of the misconception of 
investors. Many of the biggest winners are in mundane or prosaic businesses." 
</P>
<P>
It also helps if the company is on the road to recovery or a takeover target. 
</P>
<P>
Ailing New World Entertainment saw its stock appreciate 117.4% during the year, 
mostly as a result of takeover efforts. Last month the company was sold to 
Ronald O. Perelman for $145 million. 
</P>
<P>
After struggling for years, a resurgent BankAmerica Corp. impressed investors 
with a stunning turnaround. As a result, BankAmerica stock -- ranked No. 5 -- 
leaped 134.9%. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 1 ranked company, Maxxam Inc. of Los Angeles, saw its stock shoot up 
225% in the wake of major acquisitions that changed the face of the company. 
Last May, the firm bought a real estate management and forest products company 
and later acquired KaiserTech. 
</P>
<P>
"The company has undergone tremendous change in 1988 as a result of a number of 
acquisitions and mergers," said Maxxam Senior Vice President Howard Bressler. 
"It's really a different company today." 
</P>
<P>
Some companies have benefited by trying to sharpen a muddled image among 
investors. Los Angeles-based Anthony Industries, which began as a builder of 
swimming pools, has become a small conglomerate that makes everything from 
fishing tackle to fibers used for industrial purposes. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, however, Anthony has emerged as a company with an emphasis on 
leisure products. The company-owned subsidiaries that make Shakespeare fishing 
tackle and K2 skis are leaders in their industries. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been quietly trying to get our house in order," said John Rangel, senior 
vice president at Anthony. "What we are trying to do now is focus on businesses 
and try and expand on our strengths." 
</P>
<P>
Womens' lingerie also proved a hot seller on Wall Street. From its purple 
outlet on Hollywood Boulevard, Frederick's of Hollywood has grown into 
approximately 150 stores nationwide and a large mail-order operation. 
</P>
<P>
The company has dropped sportswear and swimwear in its stores and now carries 
only lingerie. It has boosted sales in its catalog by dropping more risque 
products -- a process a company executive described as "desleazing" -- to 
appeal to a broader group of customers. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy has been well received on Wall Street. Frederick's stock soared 
104.8%, placing the company No. 12 in stock appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
"The management team has clearly been putting the right program into position," 
said Leibowitz at American Securities. 
</P>
<P>
High-tech firms, far from dominating the list of stocks "Charging Ahead," made 
up a significant portion of stocks on the "Falling Behind" list. 
</P>
<P>
Micropolis Corp., ranked No. 3, saw its stock fall 71% after stiff competition 
in the computer disk-drive business ate into profits. 
</P>
<P>
The stock of Wyse Technology,ranked No. 5, dropped 70%. The company has been 
hit hard by a drop in demand for its personal computers. Wyse President Philip 
E. White resigned in January. 
</P>
<P>
United Education &amp; Software suffered the most severe drop. The stock of the 
Encino-based firm dropped 89% during the year ended April 3. 
</P>
<P>
United's stock, which traded as high as $16 a share last year, has fallen 
sharply after a government-led probe found major problems at a former company 
unit that tracked student loans for lenders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<P>
Like comedian Rodney Dangerfield, many California companies get no respect -- 
from Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
For a variety of reasons, investors have stayed away from these companies. In 
some cases, these "lowest-priced" companies, as measured by the market 
value-to-book value ratio, are still haunted by past failures. Sometimes, 
investors have good reason to be wary. 
</P>
<P>
(The combined worth of a company's stock determines market value. Book value is 
the value that a firm's assets are carried on its balance sheet.) 
</P>
<P>
"They may be undervalued or they just might be lousy values," said Kevin 
Colosimo, vice president of MZ Group, which compiled The Times lists of 
highest- and lowest-priced companies. 
</P>
<P>
Savings and loans account for 11 of the 25 lowest-priced firms. S&amp;Ls have 
generally fared poorly when market and book value are compared. The books of 
many S&amp;Ls carry low-rate mortgages made 20 years ago that are now worth 
much less, given higher interest rates. S&amp;L stock prices in general have 
been hurt by the problems of a relative few. And while many institutions have 
continued to grow and remain profitable, they have suffered on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
"These are bad times for S&amp;Ls and the good guys are being punished along 
with the bad guys," said Allan G. Bortel, a savings and loan analyst with 
Shearson Lehman Hutton. "It does hurt them when they try raising new equity 
capital." 
</P>
<P>
But, Bortel said, "it doesn't hurt their basic business otherwise. Their 
average customer is not looking at the company's stock price." 
</P>
<P>
Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Assn., for example, ranked No. 89 on The Times 100 
return-on-equity list, but topped the list of lowest-priced companies. 
</P>
<P>
Investors may be wary of Columbia's heavy investments in high-yield "junk 
bonds" and commercial real estate. In early April, company officials said 
federal investigators were looking at whether the company took part in an 
illegal trading scheme with the junk bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analyst Gerlad S. Haims at Seidler Amdec, a Los Angeles brokerage, 
said there is some concern that federal legislation could force S&amp;Ls like 
Columbia to beef up its traditional home-mortgage business at the expense of 
its investments in junk bonds and commercial real estate. 
</P>
<P>
A troubled past continues to haunt some companies. One victim is Tosco, which 
despite recent financial improvement, was ranked 12th on the lowest-priced 
companies list. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s and late 1970s, the Santa Monica-based company converted 
shale into oil. But the process took longer than expected -- a drawback in an 
environment of falling oil prices -- and Tosco entered the oil refinery and 
distribution businesses. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, its stock was depressed in part by a decline in the price of oil. 
Since then, the company has recovered and operates a highly efficient and 
profitable oil refinery in Avon, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
"I think primarily the problem is perception," said Thomas C. Lewis, who 
follows the energy industry for the firm Duff &amp; Phelps. "It's a company 
that has undergone significant change in terms of the type of business they are 
involved in as well as management." 
</P>
<P>
"The amount of improvement that has taken place at the company has been 
dramatic," said Lewis. But referring to the stock price decline, he added: "A 
lot of people still remember what Tosco did to them long ago." 
</P>
<P>
While such companies have turned the corner, some still have a long way to go. 
One is Guy F. Atkinson, a construction company based in South San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson had staked out a profitable share of the construction business by 
working on medium-sized public works projects, like roads, dams and bridges. 
But in recent years, much larger rivals, like Bechtel Corp., have entered 
Atkinson's domain after seeing big public works and petrochemical projects dry 
up. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole engineering and construction industry has had a rough time," said 
David Bartlett an analyst with Sterling &amp; York, a New York research and 
investment banking group. "The business got so bad that the heavyweights came 
into the market and shook things up. They took all the profit out of the 
business." 
</P>
<P>
Although Atkinson has begun to show signs of improvement, investors remain 
skeptical. "I think the street is waiting for a positive earnings trend," 
Bartlett said.

Gold was the first engine to drive the California economy. 
</P>
<P>
But in the 140 years since gold-hungry '49ers put it on the map, California has 
grown into the nation's wealthiest state -- it is the world's eighth-largest 
economy -- by virtue of a richly varied business community that has spanned a 
spectrum from gold nuggets to fruits and vegetables to airplanes and missiles 
to silicon wafers. 
</P>
<P>
This economic diversity remains as strong today as ever. In fact, after fueling 
an economic growth rate during the 1980s that consistently outpaced the 
nation's, this diversity is expected to cushion the state against the slowdown 
that most economists expect to hit with full force later this year or early in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
"Our image is kooky and distinct," observes Larry Kimbell, director of the UCLA 
Business Forecast. "But the reality is that California all by itself is a 
mirror of the rest of the nation when it comes to its businesses. We are the 
most diverse state in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
And this variety has been an invaluable blessing. According to a study released 
earlier this year by the Bank of America, torrid growth in the state's defense 
and construction industries from 1982 to 1985 offset slowdowns in its 
agriculture and consumer electronics sectors. Since 1986, red-hot growth in 
agriculture, commercial aerospace and consumer goods manufacturing has buffered 
the effects of slowing in the defense and real estate industries. 
</P>
<P>
Further, during the next two years, growing strength in export operations -- 
largely with Pacific Rim countries -- and skyrocketing orders for new 
commercial aircraft and related parts are expected to help the state weather 
the recession that many economists predict is just over the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
The Times list of the 100 fastest-growing California companies underscores the 
diversity of the state's economy. 
</P>
<P>
The top three companies on this list of "fast trackers" represent three 
separate segments of the economy. Further, a more detailed analysis of the 
growth rates for all 921 public companies surveyed reveals a remarkably even 
rate of growth among the 13 industry groups into which the businesses fall. 
</P>
<P>
Eight groups -- biotechnology, computer products, consumer goods, electronics, 
entertainment, industrial, retail and services -- posted growth rates in the 
double digits. Four -- aerospace and defense, energy, financial services and 
utilities -- had growth rates of less than 10%, and just one industry -- 
wholesale operations -- suffered a sales setback for the year. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the 921 companies surveyed for The Times Growth 100 posted an average 
sales growth rate of 9.8% in 1988. Of the 100 fastest-growing companies, a list 
that admittedly favors smaller companies, the median growth rate -- the 
mid-point on the tally -- was about 37%. To be ranked in the Growth 100, a 
company had to have sales of $30 million in 1986 and must have been publicly 
traded for the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
The fastest-growing companies represent the stars of the state's economy in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Topping the list was Maxxam Inc., a Beverly Hills-based holding company with 
operating subsidiaries in lumber, real estate development and chemicals. The 
company, which most recently acquired the Kaiser-Tech aluminum and chemicals 
company in Oakland, had sales last year of $519 million, a figure representing 
a two-year average sales growth of 158%, a figure due entirely to the company's 
recent acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Gear, the trend-setting manufacturer of women's and girls' athletic shoes 
and casual clothing, was a close second. The Los Angeles company's sales for 
1988 were $224 million, and its two-year average growth rate was 148%. 
</P>
<P>
In third place, with annual sales last year of slightly more than $1 billion 
was Sun Microsystems, a manufacturer of powerful computers for engineers and 
scientists, with a two-year average annual growth rate of about 124%. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the outstanding characteristics about 1988 wasn't just the raw sales 
numbers," says Jeanette Garretty, a Bank of America economist. "It was that we 
saw growth in a lot of sectors of the economy. In the past, the growth has been 
a lot more uneven."

California's public companies racked up a 47.4% increase in 1988 profits as the 
921 firms surveyed for the Times 100 listings reported strong earnings in 
almost every sector. Net income totaled $19.5 billion last year, up from $13.3 
billion, while sales rose 9.8% to $388.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The year was marked by some spectacular turnarounds. Most dramatically, there 
was a 178% increase in income -- $3 billion in a single year -- reported by the 
167 financial services institutions. The total $4.8 billion accounted for about 
a quarter of all earnings among the state's publicly traded companies. 
</P>
<P>
The financial-services rebound was led, of course, by BankAmerica, which left 
its bad foreign loans behind and climbed from nearly a billion-dollar loss in 
1987 to a $547-million profit. Similarly, First Interstate went from a 
$556-million 1987 loss to a $102-million profit. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, energy prices continued relatively strong during the year, favoring 
the state's huge oil firms (but running up costs for public utilities, a sector 
in which income declined 7.5%). Chevron dislodged Arco from its position as the 
state's leading company in absolute profits with $1.768 billion in earnings, up 
from slightly more than $1 billion. Arco finished second as earnings rose to 
$1.58 billion from $1.22 billion. 
</P>
<P>
After the two energy giants, only Pacific Telesis' earnings topped the 
billion-dollar mark. Continued strong growth in demand for telecommunications 
services -- including cellular phone service -- and improved productivity 
helped boost earnings to $1.19 billion from $950 million. 
</P>
<P>
A beneficiary of the state's continuing population growth was retailing. 
California companies continued to add new stores -- and employees -- with 
shopping centers and strip malls springing up in the Southland deserts and 
Central Valley farming communities as younger families move ever farther from 
the urban core in search of cheaper housing. 
</P>
<P>
"Mall construction is dead outside California," said Sarah Stack, who follows 
retailing for the Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards brokerage in Los Angeles. One 
result: Retail employment within California increased 10% last year, compared 
to 7% outside the state. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, "last year was a year of solid growth," said Pauline Sweezey, head 
economist for the state Department of Finance. 
</P>
<P>
Adrian Sanchez, associate economist at Security Pacific Bank, said the strong 
earnings results reported by consumer-product, wholesale and retail businesses 
stemmed both from population growth and an increase in personal income that 
outpaced the national average by 1.5 percentage points. Per-capita income in 
California is 15% higher than the national average. 
</P>
<P>
That profitability was shared even by the state's budding and volatile 
biotechnology sector, in which the 27 firms surveyed saw combined income 
increase by nearly 25% to $35 million from $28 million in 1987 (and a net loss 
of $13 million the year before). 
</P>
<P>
But the general gain was not without some individual pain. For example, 
Genentech of South San Francisco slipped last year in market value, income and 
sales growth even after introducing its much-awaited product, TPA, which is 
used to dissolve blood clots. The problem for Genentech was TPA's disappointing 
sales results. 
</P>
<P>
If commercialization of biotechnology eventually means rapid growth and 
increased profitability, the industry would be following in the footsteps of 
the state's computer and electronics industries. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole high-tech area has been one of California's strengths for a long 
time," said Sweezey. "A lot of the innovative work is done in small firms." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the public companies' strong profitability in 1988, there remain some 
concerns for 1989. This is especially the case in aerospace and defense, whose 
share of the total state economic pie has been shrinking for the past few years 
as the big buildup of the early Reagan years gives way to defense cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes awhile to ramp down once you build up," said Larry J. Kimbell, 
director of UCLA's Business Forecasting Project. But the buildup is clearly 
over, he said. 
</P>
<P>
While income increased 15%, sales rose just 2.4%. Both income and sales have 
shrunk from 12% of the total reported by California-based public companies in 
1986 to 10% last year. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, employment declined only slightly, to 163,000 in California 
last year from 168,000. But, Kimbell said, the full effect of defense cuts is 
probably being softened by increased new orders for commercial aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Those big airplane contracts underline the fact that California's economy has a 
number of strengths, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the arguments we have been making for years," Sweezey said, "is that 
California has such a diverse economic structure. There can be hard times in 
one sector while other sectors remain strong." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, for example, income earned by the financial-services sector 
represented 25% of all income among the publicly traded companies after having 
shrunk to 13% in 1987. This largely offset the tighter earnings registered by 
utilities -- from 21% of total earnings in 1987 to 13% last year -- as 
regulators cut revenues and trimmed companies' rates of return to reflect 
productivity gains and lower business costs. 
</P>
<P>
All the same, Sweezey said, the outlook for 1989 remains clouded at best. "We 
wonder about interest rates, the Fed's reaction to the inflation numbers coming 
out, whether business will restrain price increases and what is the threshold 
on interest rates that will choke off activity." 
</P>
<P>
Added Kimbell of UCLA: "We're going to stick to being a little bit 
pessimistic." One likely strong performer this year, however, is heavy 
construction, which continues strong in the state, said Sanchez of Security 
Pacific. But continued strong growth seems unlikely in consumer spending 
generally, where some signs of slowing (such as new home construction) are 
already developing. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year was a very strong year," Sanchez said. "In recent years, only 1984 
was stronger, but our outlook for 1989 is for decidedly slower growth because 
of high interest rates and inflation."

<P>
The 921 firms surveyed for The Times 100 special section are surely a diverse 
lot. But by tracking only California-based, publicly held companies, the group 
doesn't cover a huge chunk of enterprises that help make the state's economy so 
robust and resilient. 
</P>
<P>
Chief among the missing is virtually all of farming in what has been, for the 
past 40 years, the nation's leading agricultural state. California's 83,000 
farms (about half of which are part-time farming operations) collected more 
than $16 billion last year from the sale of nearly 250 commercial crops. 
Moreover, agriculture contributes an estimated $64 billion in annual pay for 
jobs directly related to production and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Missing are such marketing giants as Sherman Oaks-based Sunkist Growers, a 
billion-dollar cooperative owned by more than 6,000 citrus farmers and packers, 
and Sacramento-based Blue Diamond Growers, with 4,000 employees and sales of 
$450 million in almonds and other nuts. 
</P>
<P>
Also excluded are 1.9 million state and local government employees, including 
school teachers and staffs of special-service districts. These account for 13% 
of all the jobs in California, but that has shrunk from 21% of the state's work 
force in 1976, before enactment of Proposition 13, limiting property taxes, and 
the subsequent Proposition 4, which limited government spending. Civilian 
federal employees raise the public-sector share to 16% of all California jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Among the significant others who aren't surveyed for this special section are 
scores of big, privately owned companies, thousands of much smaller firms and 
partnerships, plus an array of very large nonprofit organizations, including 
Kaiser Foundation, Blue Cross health plans (44,000 and 4,500 employees, 
respectively) and Automobile Club of Southern California (5,400 employees). 
Nonprofit research and development companies include El Segundo's Aerospace 
Corp. with 4,200 California employees and Santa Monica's RAND with 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
The giant profit-seeking firms include Oakland-based Safeway, which went 
private in 1986 to avoid a hostile takeover. Though Safeway has since sold its 
Southern California supermarkets, the company still employs 24,000 in 
California; rival Lucky Stores with more than 32,000 employees in the state, is 
now a subsidiary of American Stores, Salt Lake City. Southern Pacific 
Transportation is now a subsidiary of Santa Fe-Southern Pacific but still 
provides more than 10,000 jobs in California. 
</P>
<P>
Other major privately owned firms: Modesto's E &amp; J Gallo Winery, the 
world's largest, with 2,000 employees and annual sales thought to exceed $1 
billion. Certified Grocers, erroneously included as a publicly owned company in 
last year's Times 100 listing of sales leaders, is a Los Angeles-based food 
wholesaler with nearly $2 billion in sales and 2,600 employees. San Francisco's 
giant Bechtel Group and Pasadena's employee-owned Parsons are construction 
outfits with projects girdling the globe. Denny's, a restaurant chain 
headquartered in La Mirada, employs 12,500 within the state, and clothing 
manufacturer Levi Strauss of San Francisco employs 2,400. 
</P>
<P>
Even that listing scarcely exhausts the ranks of significant others, said 
Pauline Sweezey, chief economist for the state Department of Finance. "There 
are a lot of companies that may not be headquartered in California but do a lot 
of business here." 
</P>
<P>
For example, St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas has 121,421 employees, of which 
50,000 turn out aircraft in the Long Beach area. Another St. Louis giant, 
Anheuser-Busch, employs 4,200 at its California breweries; the independent 
distributors and other private contractors who bring the beer to market account 
for about as many more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are General Motors' GM Hughes Electronics subsidiary in Los Angeles, 
which employs 62,000 Californians, and Ford Motor's Ford Aerospace unit in 
Newport Beach, with 9,500 workers. 
</P>
<P>
In telecommunications, GTE California in Thousand Oaks, whose 21,000 employees 
provide local telephone service along the Southern California Coast and in 
parts of the interior, is the largest of many local phone companies owned by 
GTE of Stamford, Conn. Contel-California in Victorville is the state's 
third-largest local phone company but belongs to Atlanta-based Contel. And soon 
to disappear through pending foreign ownership is PhoneMate, the Torrance-based 
purveyor of telephone answering machines, which will soon become a subsidiary 
of Japan's Asahi Corp., its longtime supplier. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there are lots of small firms that Sweezey credits with providing "a 
lot of growth" to the economy. These enterprises include start-up companies and 
garage workshops that may be tomorrow's Hewlett-Packard, Apple Computer or, for 
that matter, PhoneMate. But mostly they provide the endless range of 
specialized services that consumers take for granted: real estate services, 
private contracting, auto repair and painting, cleaning, lodging and meals, 
professionals of all sorts, travel agents. 
</P>
<P>
The state, Sweezey said, compiles no financial data on this volatile segment of 
the economy. But in 1986, the Employee Development Department surveyed nearly 
608,000 California companies and found that 94% have 49 employees or fewer -- 
and 57% employed no more than four. 
</P>
<P>
And what of tourism? 
</P>
<P>
While large concerns catering to tourists may be found under such Times 100 
categories as entertainment-leisure, retail, wholesale and services, there are 
countless businesses of all sorts to be found in constant flux in such 
otherwise out-of-the-way but spectacular places as the Tahoe Basin or, for that 
matter, Palm Springs.

In some quarters, Maxxam Inc. wouldn't rate as anybody's favorite corporation. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based real estate development company has a history of 
attracting negative publicity, including a loud chorus of condemnation over the 
accelerated cutting of redwood trees after its move into California's lumber 
industry in 1986. But investors applauded last year when Maxxam bought 
KaiserTech, the parent of Oakland-based Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical. 
Maxxam's shares rose 225% in the past year, showing the greatest stock price 
appreciation of all California companies surveyed by MZ Group of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"Aluminum companies have been experiencing record profitability," said John C. 
Tumazos, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Whether impressed with bold acquisitions or a steady, plodding record of 
performance, investors in the past year found quite a few Los Angeles County 
concerns to be attractive buys. Five of the top 10 gainers on the statewide 
"Charging Ahead" list of companies ranked by stock appreciation are based in 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
However, none of last year's top stock performers in the county are on the list 
this year. In fact, United Education &amp; Software of Encino -- No. 2 on the 
statewide stock appreciation list and No. 1 on county stock appreciation list 
last year -- tops this year's statewide list of those whose stock declined the 
most. 
</P>
<P>
United Education &amp; Software's share price has been hurt by a continuing 
controversy over its performance in processing loans under the U. S. student 
loan program. The Encino-based firm is at the center of the most expensive 
foul-up in the history of the program. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Los Angeles County companies were disproportionately represented among 
the state's top companies based upon total revenue, revenue growth, absolute 
profits and number of employees. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County-based companies showing the highest stock price gains 
include St. Ives Laboratories, the Chatsworth maker of cosmetics and skin 
creams; Vons Cos. of El Monte, a leading Southern California grocery retailer; 
Anthony Industries, the City of Commerce maker of recreational equipment, and 
New World Entertainment, the Los Angeles television and film production 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Shares of St. Ives, which sells personal-care products under the "Swiss 
Formula" label, rose primarily because of buyout speculation. Rumors began in 
March, when Stephen Redding, vice president of Nexxus, a rival personal-care 
products maker in Santa Barbara, acquired a 5.3% stake. St. Ives' top two 
executives control 53% of the shares, ruling out a hostile takeover. But 
Redding's purchase still fueled rumors of a possible buyout of public holders. 
The company's shares also benefited from 18% revenue growth and a 10% profit 
surge in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Vons strengthened its position in the huge Southern California food retailing 
market when it acquired Safeway's Southern California stores, even though costs 
associated with the move contributed to a $23.9-million loss last year. The 162 
Safeway stores make Vons the largest chain in the region -- unless American 
Stores is finally allowed to combine its Lucky and Alpha Beta chains under the 
Lucky banner. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Anthony Industries' identity was a little fuzzy on Wall Street, 
although the company was known in Southern California as a maker of swimming 
pools. That was the major reason the company launched an extensive campaign 
last year to raise its profile among Wall Street analysts, Chief Executive 
Bernard I. Forester said in December. The campaign apparently helped. Anthony's 
shares more than doubled in value in the past year. Net income also increased 
37%. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony's Shakespeare Fishing Tackle Group is one of the leading makers and 
distributors of fishing rods, reels and boat motors in the United States. Its 
K2 Corp. is the largest U.S. maker of alpine skis in the United States. K2 also 
expanded in Europe last year by acquiring 70% of Scandinavia's oldest and 
largest cross country ski maker. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony's task last spring, Forester said, was to convince Wall Street "that 
there are a lot of synergies in what we do." 
</P>
<P>
Only one of the county's top stock performers -- Vons -- ranks among the 
county's 15 largest companies as measured by annual revenue. The top stock 
performers list is composed largely of smaller service companies such as 
Frederick's of Hollywood, which has reduced its offerings of racy lingerie in 
favor of more demure styles appealing to a broader market. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County is home to several of the state's largest and 
fastest-growing concerns. Firms based in the county make up about 36% of the 
state's public companies, but they account for over half of the combined 
revenue of the group and 49% of the combined profits, said Kevin Colosimo, vice 
president of MZ Group of San Francisco, which conducted The Times' survey. The 
county also accounted for half of the combined work force of the companies, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Energy and aerospace account for Los Angeles County's largest concerns in terms 
of annual revenue. Occidental Petroleum and Atlantic Richfield, rank second and 
third in the state. A newcomer this year is Rockwell International -- the third 
largest in the county and fourth largest in the state -- which moved its 
headquarters to El Segundo from Pittsburgh. It is followed by Lockheed, the 
state's fifth-largest concern. 
</P>
<P>
Maxxam topped the state and county rankings of the fastest growing in terms of 
two-year average sales growth. Acquisitions account for Maxxam's 158% average 
growth. But L.A. Gear, best known as a retailer of stylish athletic shoes for 
teen-age girls, has expanded its product line of apparel and jeans. The 
company, one of last year's top-performing stocks, ranked second in revenue 
growth in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Only three of last year's fastest growing in revenue made the list of the 15 
fastest growing in 1988 -- the Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Corp. real estate 
concern, the Neutrogena consumer products company, and Rexon, a computer 
products company. 
</P>
<P>
Among the missing is Maxicare Health Plans, which grew by acquisitions in 1986 
but was forced to divest almost all of its acquisitions in 1988, when its 
financial plight worsened. The health maintenance organization filed for 
protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code in March. 
</P>
<P>
While Los Angeles County dominates the state's economy, it differs in some 
respects from statewide economic trends, Colosimo said. Overall, the county's 
rate of growth last year was slower than the state as a whole -- but only 
marginally so, he said. Statewide, he said, the economic strength was across 
the board. But "weakness in high technology held back the overall performance 
of Los Angeles County," he said, noting that the high-technology companies in 
the greatest difficulty are in Southern California.
