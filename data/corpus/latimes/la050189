A baby eagle named Suzanne was fed a trout over the weekend by an adult bald 
eagle, that wildlife biologists hope will adopt the fledgling and help 
reestablish a colony in Southern California. The 3-week-old chick, taken from a 
nest in Northern California Thursday, was placed in the nest of a pair of 
eagles on Santa Catalina Island Friday morning. After several hours the female 
adult landed and began feeding the fledgling, said biologist David Garcelon. 
The young bird won't be able to fly for about 10 weeks. Previous eggs laid by 
the female eagle, introduced to the island habitat in 1980, had failed to hatch 
because pesticide contamination weakened their shells. Bald eagles disappeared 
from the island in the 1950s, victims of pollution and egg poachers.

A drenching thunderstorm reduced a 13,000-acre fire, much of it in the Osceola 
National Forest in northern Florida, to only a few smoldering hot spots, fire 
officials said. About 200 firefighters and 41 bulldozers remained on the scene 
to watch the hot spots that remained from the fire, which doubled in size 
Saturday after shifting winds drove an 80-foot-high wall of flames northward 
toward State Road 2. The firefighters, including 40 members of a specially 
trained squad from the Ozark National Forest in Arkansas, succeeded in stopping 
flames from spreading northward Saturday night, ending the threat to virgin 
pine land and the Okefenokee Swamp across the border in Georgia. Authorities 
said that the fire apparently started when the transmission in a log-moving 
vehicle used in commercial timber operations broke down and ignited woods just 
outside the national forest.

Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner has asked four nations to accept 
U.S. anti-terrorism agents who would gather intelligence and check airport 
security, U.S. News and World Report said. Bush Administration officials were 
unavailable for comment. This week's edition of the magazine named the 
countries as Britain, Italy, West Germany and Israel and said that if 
permission were granted, agents of the Federal Aviation Administration could be 
in place by year's end. The publication also said that Skinner earlier told 
aviation officials abroad that the White House would soon ask Congress to make 
it a crime for any airline flying in and out of the United States to leak 
information from the U.S. government about terrorist threats.

White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu said President Bush has told him that 
there was no quid pro quo discussion of expedited military and economic aid to 
Honduras in return for that country's assisting the Nicaraguan Contras when 
Bush met then-President Roberto Suazo Cordova there in March, 1985. Documents 
released at the Oliver L. North trial have implied that Bush played some role 
in a U.S. plan to expedite aid to Honduras in return for its assistance to the 
Contras. White House officials said secret documents will be released to 
buttress the claim that Bush's visit was not part of the quid pro quo deal. 
They will include a State Department cable from then-Ambassador John 
Negroponte, which, Sununu said on NBC's "Meet the Press," "makes it very 
obvious that there was no quid pro quo."

STUDY DISPUTES RAILROAD SAFETY FIGURES

A study of five major companies suggests some of the nation's railroads are 
under-reporting accidents and injuries and failing to keep proper records on 
such incidents, the General Accounting Office said. The study concluded that 
the shortcomings were because of inadequate internal railroad procedures, some 
of which have since been corrected. The GAO, the congressional investigative 
agency, did not accuse any of the railroads of purposely withholding 
information from the Federal Railroad Administration. Nonetheless, the 
investigators said the problem "raises questions about the overall 
effectiveness of FRA's safety program." Dan Lang, a spokesman for the Assn. of 
American Railroads, said "there could be room for disagreement" over whether 
particular accidents satisfied the thresholds for injury and damage above which 
federal regulations require a report to the FRA.

TWO MISSING OFF U.S. SUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three crew members on a U.S. Navy submarine fell overboard when a wave swept 
over the vessel as it conducted surface operations off Japan's southwestern 
island of Kyushu, and two are still missing, U.S. military officials said in 
Tokyo. One of those who fell from the 2,145-ton vessel was picked up by the 
Barbel itself after a search aircraft spotted him, the officials said. His 
identity and condition were withheld. The identity of those missing was also 
withheld. A spokesman for Japan's Maritime Safety Agency said three Japanese 
aircraft and four vessels, including three Japanese patrol boats, have joined 
the hunt for the two missing men. According to Jane's Fighting Ships, the 
Barbel is a diesel-powered submarine commissioned in 1959 that normally carries 
a crew of 85.

Taiwan, in a decision breaking an important political barrier, sent a 
high-level delegation to Beijing to attend a regional banking meeting. Taipei 
officials have been banned from China since 1949, when the Nationalist 
government was driven from China into political exile on Taiwan. However, 
Finance Minister Shirley Kuo, who is heading the delegation, told a news 
conference in Taipei that the visit's sole purpose is to attend the annual 
meeting of the Asian Development Bank. "Our mainland Chinese policy is a 
completely separate issue," Kuo said, ruling out the possibility of holding 
talks with Beijing leaders.

An international fleet of planes repatriated thousands of Mauritanian and 
Senegalese fleeing bloody communal rioting in both West African countries. 
Mauritanian refugees in Dakar, the capital of Senegal, boarded planes from 
France, Morocco and Spain for the 300-mile flight to the Mauritanian capital, 
Nouakchott. The aircraft then brought back to Dakar some of the 7,000 
Senegalese who had taken refuge in a mosque in Nouakchott. Both capitals were 
reported calm after a week of violence, sparked by a dispute over border land, 
that left more than 200 people dead.

BRADLEY'S ROLE AS PAID ADVISER SHOCKS SOME CITY POLITICIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY and FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley's previously unknown role as a paid adviser to a bank doing 
business with the city has come as a disappointing surprise to some of his 
political colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"At best, this is the consequence of carelessness," said Los Angeles City 
Councilman Marvin Braude, who is one of Bradley's strongest supporters on the 
municipal legislative body. "At worst, it is a matter for the city attorney." 
</P>
<P>
Braude and others commented in interviews Sunday as the City Council prepared 
to hold a Governmental Operations Committee hearing Wednesday on disclosures 
that Bradley and his staff interceded with city agencies on behalf of Far East 
National Bank while Bradley was a paid adviser to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expert Legal Team 
</P>
<P>
The Times learned that Bradley's legal team in the investigation includes a 
specialist in conflict-of-interest laws, attorney Ronald B. Turovsky of the 
firm of Manatt, Phelps, Rothenberg &amp; Phillips. Also on the team are Mickey 
Kantor of Manatt, Phelps, an expert political strategist, and Daniel Fogel, a 
civil and trial attorney with the firm of Fogel, Feldman, Ostrov, Ringler &amp; 
Klevens. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Far East National Bank paid Bradley $18,000 to serve on its board of 
advisers, and he was the only one of 46 advisory board members to receive 
payment. Asked why the bank paid Bradley, bank President Henry Hwang said it 
was because the mayor was helpful in bringing foreign trade to the institution. 
"You generally have to pay people for things . . . for, you know, for services 
rendered in the future, whatever," Hwang said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee will hear a report from City Atty. James K. Hahn, who is in 
charge of an investigation of Bradley's affairs. Hahn will also investigate 
Bradley's tenure as a board member of Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn., 
for which he was paid up to $24,000 a year. The thrift had zoning matters 
before the city during the years that Bradley was on its board. 
</P>
<P>
The release of documents detailing the role of Bradley and his aides in 
contacting city agencies on behalf of Far East has persuaded Braude and others 
that Bradley faces serious political trouble when the committee convenes 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Braude said he was shocked by the news. "The mayor is not unethical, venal or 
corrupt," he said. "Quite the contrary. The mayor is quite honorable." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Errors of Oversight' 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "there is a strong tendency (among public officials) to neglect 
their personal affairs with the press of official activities. Errors of 
oversight are bound to occur and that has caught up with the mayor. But that is 
no excuse." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores said: "I believe what I've read, but I want to 
hear what the mayor says about it. 
</P>
<P>
"It is really too bad that this happened," Flores said. "I don't always agree 
with the mayor but I have never had the least doubt that he was a man of 
integrity. I really believe the mayor is an honest man." 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't know what led him to do these things. I don't know whether he got 
bad advice or just got greedy. But it is so unlike the mayor." 
</P>
<P>
City Council President John Ferraro, who once ran against Bradley, said "we all 
(city elected officials) make phone calls for people, but we are not on their 
payroll. I certainly would not call if I had a financial interest or served on 
a board." 
</P>
<P>
Another old Bradley political associate, and friend, who declined to be 
identified, said: "I've never questioned his integrity. I can't conceive of him 
participating in any kind of illegal activity. But one can never be too prudent 
and sometimes one doesn't think enough and gets involved in things they 
shouldn't get involved in. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks bad, the public reaction looks bad," the associate said. 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro, Braude and Flores will be key City Council players as the Bradley 
investigation unfolds, and their statements indicate that Bradley will undergo 
scrutiny from a council that has shown increasing signs of being willing to 
oppose the mayor. That has been especially true since Bradley's surprisingly 
narrow reelection victory last month. 
</P>
<P>
As council president, the veteran Ferraro will take a prominent role in shaping 
the council's course, advising the chairman of the Governmental Operations 
Committee, Michael Woo, who is just finishing his first term. Ferraro has had 
an up-and-down relationship with Bradley, running against him in 1985 in a 
vitriolic campaign but traveling with him last year to the Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Braude is another veteran. While he was angry with the mayor's support of 
proposed oil drilling in the Pacific Palisades in Braude's district, the 
councilman has always had a high regard for Bradley and has given him key 
support in tough political situations. Braude is respected by council 
colleagues and is expected to have a behind-the-scenes role in shaping events. 
</P>
<P>
Flores has also won considerable respect on the council, first as an aide to 
the late Councilman John Gibson, then as his successor when he retired. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Flores and Braude supported Ferraro for council president. They are 
all part of an informal leadership cadre that comes together on major occasions 
to chart a course for the council. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stronger Role Considered 
</P>
<P>
Some council members had discussed the council taking a stronger role in the 
investigation by hiring a special counsel and issuing subpoenas. 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro did not rule that out, saying: "If after the committee meets on 
Wednesday, and they feel they need expertise, maybe we could get an adviser to 
the committee. But I think we ought to wait until the hearing on Wednesday."

'LEVITATION' FOR ABBIE; 
</P>
<P>
TRIBUTE TO ACTIVIST IS CHARACTERISTIC MIX OF MOURNING AND MIRTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY PASTERNAK, Times Staff Writer

<P>
In ties and shirts, and tie-dyed shirts, the friends of Abbie Hoffman gathered 
Sunday to mourn and joke and talk politics at the First Unitarian Church near 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow Chicago Seven defendant David Dellinger was there. Fellow Youth 
International Party founder Paul Krassner was there. Hundreds who never met 
Hoffman, but who wanted to recharge their memories of the turbulent '60s, came 
too, for a "memorial levitation and congregation" 18 days after the activist's 
reported suicide. 
</P>
<P>
At a wake subtitled, "One for the Yipper," they shared reminiscences of a man 
who, like Shakespeare's jesters, spent his life mixing mirth with pointed 
social statements: burning money at the New York Stock Exchange in 1967; 
stomping on judicial robes during his trial, along with six other defendants, 
on charges of inciting riots at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in 
Chicago; working as an environmentalist under an assumed name during six years 
as a fugitive from drug charges -- and appearing on television and before 
Congress in the process. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Symbols of an Era 
</P>
<P>
Inside, the crowd filled a wood-paneled, red-carpeted auditorium adorned with 
posters of doves and ban-the-bomb symbols. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, the overflow watched the proceedings on a courtyard television 
monitor. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman, 52, was found dead April 12 in his apartment in New Hope, Pa. A 
coroner said he committed suicide with an overdose of phenobarbital. Friends 
said that Hoffman, who had been diagnosed as manic depressive, had been hurt in 
an auto accident and upset that students on campuses where he lectured appeared 
to be more interested in wealth and careers than in activism. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Krassner said Sunday from the stage, Hoffman "is busy writing his next 
book: 'Resurrection for the Hell of It.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Series of Tributes 
</P>
<P>
Onstage, '60s activists who worked with Hoffman to mobilize people against the 
war in Vietnam were joined by latter-day celebrities -- including director 
Oliver Stone and comedian Whoopi Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hoffman's funeral was held in his home town of Worcester, Mass., on 
April 20, tributes were also planned in San Francisco and New York, said Jay 
Levin, founder of the L.A. Weekly and an organizer of the Los Angeles memorial. 
</P>
<P>
Appropriately, Sunday's event combined humor and anger. As Hoffman himself said 
in a taped television interview aired at the wake, "I've never seen being funny 
as the opposite of serious." 
</P>
<P>
Appropriately, there was a disruption. Jonathan Elliott, 24, a Silver Lake 
guitarist, rose uninvited from the audience to join two former members of The 
Doors playing, "When the Music's Over." 
</P>
<P>
Wavy Gravy, in the full clown regalia of his heyday as the counter-culture's 
mascot, was prevailed upon to herd the intruder offstage, to scattered boos 
from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"The other day," Krassner told the audience, "in Abbie's honor, I was rolling a 
joint with the cover of People magazine." The crowd laughed appreciatively. 
</P>
<P>
And he recalled Hoffman's scheme to call a press conference to announce a new 
drug that was an aphrodisiac. The idea was for Krassner to pretend to be a 
reporter "accidentally" sprayed with the chemical. He would then grab a 
prearranged woman and the two would soon be entwined. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, there was a scheduling conflict. I had to go to the University 
of Iowa," Krassner said. So Hoffman told him, "OK, your assignment is to bring 
back some cornmeal for the levitation of the Pentagon." 
</P>
<P>
Dellinger struck a more sober note. He remembered the time his bail was revoked 
during the Chicago Seven trial and he was led off to Cook County Jail. Others 
made statements to reporters, but Hoffman went to Dellinger's 13-year-old 
daughter and embraced her. 
</P>
<P>
And Dellinger implied that Hoffman's death was not a suicide. Although some 
friends had been quoted as saying Hoffman's auto accident was a failed suicide 
attempt, Dellinger said Hoffman told him later "he thought his brakes had been 
tampered with." 
</P>
<P>
"There is a field of inquiry here," he said. "It must be followed up." 
</P>
<P>
Others spoke of Hoffman's continuing commitment to political activism. He kept 
speaking out during the 1980s, getting arrested at a University of 
Massachusetts protest against CIA recruitment, along with former President 
Jimmy Carter's daughter, Amy. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Ellsberg, who publicized the Pentagon Papers, told the audience that the 
best way to honor Hoffman is "to keep doing what he was doing." Ellsberg 
unfurled a banner given to him by some 22-year-olds at an anti-nuclear protest 
after Hoffman's death. 
</P>
<P>
"Sweet dreams, Abbie," was the message written there. "You helped start it. 
We'll help finish it." 
</P>
<P>

Lowery's Stand Garners Both Brickbats, Bouquets 
</P>
<P>
When Sharon Rogers' van exploded March 10, the city's major politicians reacted 
quickly to the horrifying possibility that terrorism had hit the streets of San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor, Supervisor Susan Golding, U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson and 
Rep. Bill Lowery all talked about the need to remain calm and let law 
enforcement do its job. 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks that followed, however, only one politician stayed publicly 
involved in the case: Lowery, who blasted La Jolla Country Day School for 
removing Rogers from her teaching job and then encouraged her to seek legal 
counsel to negotiate a better deal. 
</P>
<P>
At the Friday press conference to announce a $135,000 settlement from the 
school, Rogers was direct: "Bill Lowery is my hero." 
</P>

Not all the parents at the exclusive school agree, and Lowery may yet reap a 
political backlash. As a group that includes many lawyers, doctors, professors 
and business executives, the Country Day parents have the ability to make their 
political displeasure evident. 
</P>
<P>
Some parents have talked of working against the five-term Republican in his 
next election, possibly finding a candidate to oppose him. 
</P>
<P>
"Once Lowery got involved in the process, all chance at a calm compromise was 
impossible because he was grabbing headlines bashing the school," said one 
parent. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost a ton of respect for Lowery," said another. "I think it was a 
grandstand play on his part. I'm a staunch Republican but that SOB will never 
get my vote again." 
</P>
<P>
Said a third parent: "I'm sick of Lowery using my school and my kids to get his 
name in the newspaper. He was playing to the crowd by portraying us as a bunch 
of rich cowards." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Lowery is not without supporters among Country Day parents. In fact, 
some say he should be congratulated for "shaming" the school into an equitable 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, there are some parents mad at Lowery, but there are far more who are mad 
at the way the headmaster bungled the issue from the start," said a parent. 
</P>
<P>
Lowery's chief aide, Karl Higgins, accompanied Rogers' attorney, Pat Shea, to 
the Friday press conference and released a statement from Lowery. 
</P>
<P>
Higgins said Lowery's only desire has been to urge the community not to be 
intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
"I know absolutely in my heart that this was not political grandstanding," 
Higgins said. "This was strictly an attempt by Bill Lowery to raise the public 
consciousness to a higher level and educate the community that we cannot 
respond to terrorists in a way that invites additional acts of terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the settlement, Lowery is not finished. 
</P>
<P>
He has a public meeting planned Saturday morning at Wangenheim Junior High 
School in Mira Mesa to hear what the voters think about the Rogers incident and 
terrorism in general. 
</P>
<P>
Lowery sent notices recently to all 225,000 households in his district 
advertising the session, and restating his view that "when we give in, they 
win." 
</P>

The Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego has quietly dropped any plan to 
resume holding "smokers" -- boxing matches between recruits. 
</P>
<P>
MCRD is the only Marine base in the country to dump smokers. The move is in 
response to the death of a recruit during a boxing match in August, 1987.

From Moscow With Fun 
</P>
<P>
Moscow Circus clown Alexander Frish, known to his fans simply as Sasha, has 
signed on as a roving ambassador for this fall's Soviet arts festival in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Sasha's goal will be to involve schoolchildren in the festival's free 
activities by escorting performers to the schools. Among other things, he will 
be part of the festival kickoff: an outdoor gala at Balboa Park on Oct. 22, to 
be called Superpower Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
A festival organizer will leave soon for Moscow in hopes of signing up more 
mimes, jugglers and acrobats from Soyuzgoscirk, the talent agency for circus 
performers.

American science is missing "superb opportunities," the head of the National 
Academy of Sciences said last week, calling for federal research support to 
double to $20 billion during the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the group's annual meeting, Frank Press called on the government 
to "double federal investments in basic science over five years for all 
agencies with science in their missions." Currently, about $10.2 billion is 
allocated for such work.

Scientists last week reported evidence debunking the theory that a distant 
relative of the AIDS virus that causes leukemia could be spread by insects. The 
researchers said they produced evidence that mosquitoes and ticks do not 
transmit HTLV-1, the human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type 1, a virus related 
to the AIDS virus that causes leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
"This is reassuring," said Dr. Edward Murphy, an assistant professor of 
laboratory medicine at UC San Francisco, who headed the research reported in a 
letter in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Some researchers had speculated that HTLV-1 may be spread by insects because it 
is found mostly in the tropics and other areas where insect-borne diseases are 
common. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers tested 90 Jamaican patients who had antibodies to HTLV-1 for 
antibodies to other viruses transmitted by ticks and mosquitoes and compared 
them to 110 subjects who did not have HTLV-1 antibodies. They found no 
significant evidence that those infected with HTLV-1 were more likely to have 
been exposed to mosquitoes or ticks.

A high-blood-pressure drug has shown promise in mouse studies as an 
anti-inflammatory ointment, possibly offering a new way to treat eczema, 
allergic reactions and other skin problems. 
</P>
<P>
Much more research is needed to evaluate the drug, but the findings indicate 
amiloride or agents like it may offer a safer, more effective alternative to 
existing treatments such as steroid creams, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if this doesn't work in humans, it may lead to the development of a new 
class of agents that are anti-inflammatory," said Dr. Richard Granstein, a 
dermatologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Granstein and his colleagues expect to begin testing the drug on humans within 
six months, probably on patients who have skin allergies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
If effective, the drug may offer an alternative to steroid creams currently 
used to treat a variety of skin conditions, the most common of which are 
allergic reactions like poison ivy and eczema. Steroid creams have a variety of 
side effects, including thinning of the skin and a form of acne. 
</P>
<P>
Amiloride may also have side effects, such as thinning of the skin, Granstein 
said, but the researchers suspect that any side effects would be minimal 
because the activity of the drug is short-lived, he said.

NEW ZEALAND'S KIWI PROVES ASTONISHING, BUT ITS FUTURE IS GRIM

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Obscured by a hide that he had constructed from the fronds of giant tree ferns, 
John McLennan had squatted for five hours under the stars of the Southern 
Cross, watching a 3-foot-deep hole. 
</P>
<P>
With light-gathering, infrared binoculars raised, the New Zealand scientist 
waited for the emergence of a bird so strange that when it was first described 
in 1813, English naturalists dismissed the report as a hoax: With barely 
visible stumps for wings, no external tail and a bill bordered with bristles at 
the face and nostrils at the tip, the burrowing, cone-shaped kiwi is an avian 
enigma wrapped in shaggy, hair-like feathers. 
</P>
<P>
Because it is stealthy and active only at night, the habits of New Zealand's 
national bird have remained largely unknown since the time of its discovery. 
Today, however, McLennan's studies of this 2-foot-long, flightless bird reveal 
that the kiwi's behavior is even more astonishing than its appearance. The 
silly-looking kiwi of shoe polish fame is actually a sort of super-bird whose 
behaviors may harken back to a lofty ancestry: its closest relative is now 
thought to be an extinct monster that stood 11 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Death of a Symbol 
</P>
<P>
But the most alarming finding of his six-year study is that New Zealand is fast 
eradicating its national emblem. The New Zealand press has taken to calling it 
"kiwicide." 
</P>
<P>
Kiwis were once so numerous that Maoris, Polynesians who invaded the island 
1,000 years ago, made full-length cloaks from their feathers. Early European 
explorers feasted on their gamy flesh. But today, the smallest of the three 
kiwi species, the little spotted kiwi, now survives only on a single island 
sanctuary, Kapiti Island off the mainland. Populations of brown kiwi, the 
national bird, may have declined by 90% this century. The greater spotted kiwi, 
the largest species, are few but the exact numbers are unknown. 
</P>
<P>
McLennan waited at the hole for a male kiwi to leave its burrow for its nightly 
hunt. With its long, nostril-tipped bill, the kiwi finds its prey by smell, 
stabbing the earth to seize invertebrates such as the 9-inch New Zealand 
bushworm. McLennan wanted to examine the burrow: He wondered if the 5-inch egg 
the male was incubating had hatched. 
</P>
<P>
Then, shortly after 1 a.m., the red-bearded ecologist heard the crashing of an 
approaching animal. The female kiwi was coming. 
</P>
<P>
McLennan waited in silence for many minutes, wondering what the female would do 
next. And then, he recalled, "I felt this little tap on my foot. Her nose was 
right on my boot." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fearless Males 
</P>
<P>
McLennan was lucky it was a female. He has found that males, during the 
breeding season, will fearlessly attack intruders, including humans, slicing at 
invaders with razor-sharp, toxin-tipped toenails. "I've been walking alone, and 
they dash out like a hit-and-run driver -- they'll hit you hard on the leg, 
striking out with the feet, and dash away," McLennan said. 
</P>
<P>
Although kiwis seem dull-witted, nearly blind and defenseless in captivity, the 
wild kiwi is nothing of the sort. McLennan has discovered that the kiwi's 
eyesight is excellent; although flightless, the kiwi can cross rushing streams 
and scale huge boulders. Further, McLennan found that female brown kiwis are 
capable of staggering feats of reproduction. Laying the largest egg for its 
body weight of any bird that ever lived, a 4-pound brown kiwi can, if its nest 
fails or is destroyed, produce as many as five, 1-pound eggs in a single 
breeding season -- the equivalent of an average-sized woman bearing five, 
30-pound babies. 
</P>
<P>
The giant eggs reveal the kiwi's likely lineage. The kiwi's closest relative is 
probably the moa, some species of which stood 11 feet tall. Its egg could make 
an omelet for 12. DNA studies also suggest the link. Today's studies of kiwis 
may yield the best guesses yet advanced about how this enormous bird, 
extinguished after Polynesian man arrived on the New Zealand islands 1,000 
years ago, may have lived, McLennan said. 
</P>
<P>
New Zealand is the only place in the world where the kiwi is found. And it 
would seem a safe haven: The usual culprits in recent extinctions -- pollution, 
poaching and illegal trade in endangered species -- aren't big problems in this 
pristine and peaceful nation, where sheep farming is the primary industry. Yet 
according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural 
Resources, New Zealand faces one of the most rapid rates of extinction in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem is development, as forests are cleared for farms and homes. 
Another part are the pets and pests Europeans brought here 300 years ago: 
stoats, dogs, cats, ferrets, pigs, rats, Australian possums, Japanese deer, a 
United Nations of species. Many of them have overrun the country. And even 
though New Zealanders are now trying to get rid of some of the invaders, kiwis, 
as well as other species, are caught in the cross-fire. 
</P>
<P>
"I could lead you to the deathbeds of thousands of kiwis," said Mike Rudge, who 
like McLennan works for the New Zealand Department of Scientific and Industrial 
Research. 
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely amazing," he said, "that this is our national bird, and kiwis 
are under literally under siege." 
</P>
<P>
One of those deathbeds would be Waitangi forest, formerly one of the brown 
kiwi's major strongholds. More than a thousand kiwis lived there in August, 
1987. By the end of that September, the population had been halved. 
</P>
<P>
The culprit was found on the last day of that month: it was a single German 
shepherd bitch that had run wild. 
</P>
<P>
Kiwis evolved in the absence of mammalian predators, which is why there was 
never any reason to fly. Though they will fearlessly defend breeding territory, 
adults will leave their young (usually under the daytime care of the male) for 
long hours while they go on their nighttime hunts. By its fifth or sixth night 
of life, the chick emerges from the burrow and tries to feed itself. "They're 
really nice to watch then, shuffling around the burrows," McLennan said. 
</P>
<P>
When it first emerges, the chick "is a perfect adult kiwi in miniature, a 
little powder puff of feathers on the forest floor," McLennan said. "They're 
really terribly vulnerable to stoats, cats and ferrets then." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kiwi Census 
</P>
<P>
McLennan counted only three pairs of brown kiwi, and two unmated adults, in his 
700-hectare study area. They laid 21 eggs in two years. Fifteen eggs failed or 
were destroyed by predators. Six hatched. Three chicks were killed before 
fledging. 
</P>
<P>
Only three chicks fledged in two years -- a per-year gain of half a chick per 
pair. And what happens once the chick leaves the nest a month later? "We don't 
know," answered McLennan. 
</P>
<P>
The picture looks so bad for kiwis that some hopeful organizations have 
launched kiwi rescue schemes. The idea is to find and capture kiwis in areas 
slated for development and move them to new areas. But the kiwi's nocturnal 
stealth usually thwarts such efforts. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1981, Royal Forest and Bird Society branch Chairman Peter Winter was 
invited to participate in one such rescue attempt five days before 50 acres of 
North Island forest -- prime kiwi habitat -- were to be burned and crushed to 
make way for a new farm block in North Taranaki. 
</P>
<P>
Winter related: "We made five visits in all. The number of kiwi-catchers (all 
volunteers) ranged from 10 on one night to four. We mimicked kiwi calls and 
learned to distinguish the real from the false, but we did not catch kiwi. In 
fact, nobody even saw one." Although the volunteers estimated that about 12 
kiwi pairs lived in the area, none could be rescued before the burn-off. 
</P>
<P>
The North Taranaki was a relatively small tract. Last year, New Zealand's Lands 
and Survey Department cleared 3,200 hectares of North Island scrubland to 
create 12 farms under a land settlement scheme. "When that development went 
in," ecologist Rudge said, "you probably annihilated the last large bastion of 
kiwi in Northland." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Endangered by Trappers 
</P>
<P>
In captivity, kiwis are known to live for more than 20 years. But among the 
threats they face in the wild is one that left a lasting mark on three of the 
eight birds McLennan studied in Northland: Missing toes indicated that these 
adults were caught in leg-hold traps, set by fur-trappers to catch introduced 
Australian possums. From reports he had heard from area residents, a dozen 
kiwis in the study area were killed in these traps in the previous 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand government encourages possum trappers. After all, the 
Australian possums destroy acres of trees, pilfer from farmers, and usurp 
habitat and food from native animals. The foreign animals, brought here to 
start a fur trade, now so overrun some forested areas that entire hillsides are 
collapsing from erosion. But in the effort to preserve New Zealand's forests 
and scrub, trappers may be unwittingly eradicating the bird that symbolizes the 
country's uniqueness. 
</P>
<P>
The irony does not escape McLennan. "In this country, people can take over 
prime forest, knowing they are going to wreck kiwi habitat, destroy kiwi nests, 
and place traps that may well disable kiwis. But if they shot a kiwi and were 
caught, they'd be fined. It just doesn't make sense."

TABLE TOP FUSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent dramatic announcement at a press conference in Salt Lake City, that 
nuclear fusion had been achieved at room temperature, seems to have produced a 
state of hysteria that interfers with normal scientific communication. 
</P>
<P>
Concerning the Utah experiments: 
</P>
<P>
If one accepts that heat is generated and that neutrons appear in far too few 
numbers to account for that heat, one is led to consider reactions in which the 
two deuterons form Helium-4, rather than Helium-3 and a neutron. The experts 
dismiss this possibility by saying that a high-energy gamma ray must also be 
produced, and it is not observed. They are thinking of reactions in essentially 
empty space. This one takes place within an atomic lattice. A nearby Palladium 
nucleus might play the role of the gamma ray. 
</P>
<P>
But, theoretical speculations aside, this line of thought suggests a crucial 
experiment, one that I have tried, without success, to bring to the attention 
of the appropriate people. 
</P>
<P>
Would someone, with access to an apparatus producing heat and neutrons, please 
look at the evolved gases to see whether Helium-4 is present? Should it be -- 
and mindful of the large energy released in this reaction -- are there 
sufficient numbers to account for the heat generated? 
</P>
<P>
According to your April 18 article ("Helium Find Gives Lift to Fusion 
Chemists," Part I), Helium-4 has indeed been detected by University of Utah 
chemists. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the news article described Helium-4 as "a rare form of helium." 
It is, in fact, by far the predominant form.

QUESTIONABLE APPOINTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The James Watt legacy lives on in spite of George Bush's campaign promise to 
put the very best people to work on his environmental agenda. Bush has made one 
outstanding appointment in William K. Reilly as chief of the Environmental 
Protection Agency. But his selections for other critical natural-resource jobs 
raise serious questions about the Administration's pledge to safeguard the 
nation's parks, wilderness and coastline. 
</P>
<P>
Two former aides to one-time Interior Secretary Watt have been chosen to 
positions overseeing 70% of the public lands. James Cason has been nominated as 
assistant secretary of agriculture in charge of the U.S. Forest Service and Cy 
Jamison has been selected to be director of the Bureau of Land Management in 
the Department of the Interior. Cason is a former Oregon real estate developer 
who constantly ran afoul of the nation's environmental organizations as deputy 
assistant secretary of the interior. Jamison was a legislative liaison for Watt 
and for the past eight years has been an aide to Rep. Ron Marlenee (R-Mont.) 
assigned to the House Interior Committee staff. Marlenee has a reputation as 
one of the most anti-wilderness members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Other critical Interior Department appointments include two Midland, Tex., men 
who are close to the oil industry -- one of them a friend of President Bush 
going back to his oil days -- and two Indiana political supporters of Vice 
President J. Danforth Quayle. None of these appointments reflects any 
distinguished environmental credentials. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's friend is Martin L. Allday, a member of a prominent Midland law firm and 
past chairman of the Oil, Gas and Mineral Section of the State Bar of Texas. He 
was a young attorney in Midland when Bush moved there following World War II. 
Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan has announced Bush's plan to name Allday 
as department solicitor, the secretary's chief legal adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Also from Midland is Barry A. Williamson, former owner of an independent oil 
and gas development company. He had worked since February, 1988, at the 
Department of Energy before being chosen by Lujan to run Interior's Minerals 
Management Service, which is in charge of the department's offshore oil 
program. In the wake of the Exxon Valdez spill, Williamson issued a press 
release announcing offshore drilling rigs could expect "a stepped-up series of 
surprise visits" from department inspectors. There's nothing like having 
advance notice of a surprise visit. 
</P>
<P>
The Quayle supporters are Frank A. Bracken, chairman of the board of Ball-InCon 
Glass Packaging Corp. in Muncie, who was chosen to be undersecretary of the 
Interior, and James M. Ridenour, head of the Indiana Department of Natural 
Resources 1981-88, to be director of the National Park Service, replacing 
California's William Penn Mott. Bracken's previous resource experience was 
service during 1969-72 as a legislative counsel at Interior. Ridenour was an 
executive of Great Lakes Chemical Corp. before taking the Indiana resources 
job, where he clashed repeatedly with environmental groups over commercial 
developments on state lands. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly, at the Environmental Protection Agency, is an important anchor for the 
Bush environmental policy. But Bush's determination to build a strong 
environmental record will be severely undermined -- or doomed -- unless he also 
has managers at Interior and the Forest Service who are willing to put 
conservation and protection of the nation's dwindling natural estate ahead of 
the business-as-usual practice of commercial exploitation. The new appointees 
should be given a chance to demonstrate such a commitment, but so far, the 
record is not encouraging.

TRAUMA CENTERS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the closure of St. Joseph's Hospital trauma center, public officials 
should now admit that the ill-conceived, expensive and overblown trauma system 
in Los Angeles is finished, kaput, no more. 
</P>
<P>
Trauma systems in Los Angeles, San Diego and Orange counties have never been 
proven to improve patient survival. In the five years since the L.A. system 
began, mortality from motor vehicle accidents has not improved at all! How long 
will the taxpayers have to subsidize this white elephant which does us no good? 
</P>
<P>
Emergency care at St. Joseph's and in the rest of L.A. County will continue to 
be excellent without the dead weight of the trauma system. It will worsen if 
paramedics have to bypass good emergency hospitals to transport patients to 
trauma centers.

<TEXT>
<P>
Lee Dye's article "Fusion Claims Are at Odds With Basic Laws of Physics" (Part 
I, April 12) fails to point out that the history of physics (and mathematics) 
is marked by a recurring pattern of formulation of "good laws"; discovery of 
"something wrong" in seeming violation of the "good laws," then enlargement of 
the "good laws" to include the "old laws" as a special case, and handily 
including the new phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
According to this time-honored pattern, physicist Charles Barnes should now 
have a first opportunity to look for ways of enlarging the basic laws of 
physics; a sure way to a Nobel Prize and perhaps even Hollywood fame. 
</P>
<P>
When all is said and done, physics will be richer for this "illegal" phenomena.

Photo, Open House Draws Protest -- More than 300 opponents of laboratory 
experiments on animals marched Sunday at UC San Diego's annual open house, 
using graphic symbols to illustrate their points. Above is a mock graveyard, 
with about 100 "tombstones," placed on a hill in front of the campus' main 
gymnasium. The protest, organized by San Diego Animal Advocates, included 
Crystal Dunn, left, dressed as a Frankenstein monster. Her sign refers to 
Stuart Zola-Morgan, a UCSD psychiatry professor. Police reported no violent 
incidents during the protest. STAN HONDA

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO

<P>
An American man who served 18 years in a Mexican prison was released at the 
border Sunday, only to be jailed again in San Diego because of outstanding 
arrest warrants in other states. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Kenneth Wangrow, 59, was convicted of murder and narcotics violations in 
Mexico and spent the last 18 years in a Mexican prison, San Diego police 
spokesman Bill Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before 6 a.m. Sunday, Mexican authorities notified the U.S. Immigration 
and Naturalization Service that they had released Wangrow from prison and 
intended to deport him via the San Ysidro Port of Entry, Robinson said. Police 
Officer Rodney Johnson was sent to pick up Wangrow to escort him back to the 
United States -- but when Johnson ran a routine records check on Wangrow, it 
turned up five outstanding warrants. 
</P>
<P>
Wangrow is wanted in Cook County, Ill., on three felony warrants for burglaries 
that occurred between 1965 and 1969, Robinson said. In addition, Wangrow had 
two no-bail federal warrants in 1969 and 1970 from the U.S. Marshals' 
headquarters in Arlington, Va. Robinson said he did not know the nature of the 
federal crimes Wangrow is accused of, but the warrants were issued because 
Wangrow failed to appear in court. 
</P>
<P>
Both the U.S. Marshals' office and the authorities in Cook County still want to 
prosecute Wangrow, Robinson said. Wangrow is being held in the County Jail 
downtown pending extradition proceedings.

WWII DEBT OF GRATITUDE IS PAID IN KIND;

<P>
JEWISH HOME ADMITS NON-JEW WHOSE WIFE HID REFUGEES 
</P>

<P>
The penalty for helping Jews escape the German Gestapo during World War II was 
death. 
</P>
<P>
But that did not stop Polish teen-ager Irene Opdyke from hiding 12 Jewish 
friends in the basement of a German officer's villa, where she worked as a 
housekeeper. She saved countless other Jews by sharing information she 
overheard from Gestapo officers planning roundups in Jewish communities. 
</P>
<P>
In gratitude to Opdyke, who is 68 and lives in Orange County, administrators at 
the Jewish Home for the Aged in Reseda violated all their admissions policies 
and admitted the heroine's husband into their Alzheimer's disease unit last 
week. William Opdyke, 80, will be one of a handful of non-Jews at the home, 
which provides communal living for senior citizens from throughout Los Angeles 
County. He will also be one of the only people ever admitted directly into an 
intensive nursing care unit there. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, a requirement for admittance to the 875-bed facility has been that 
the residents be able to care for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Rules 
</P>
<P>
"We violated all the rules -- he's not from our region, we are sectarian, we 
are so short of beds -- but there are certain times when there are no rules. 
This is one of those times," Executive Director Sheldon Blumenthal said. "In 
caring for Bill, we are repaying a debt to her. We owe her." 
</P>
<P>
Irene Opdyke's parents had taught her to respect all people, regardless of 
religious or ethnic background, she said in an interview. So the teen-age 
nursing student was horrified when she saw how Jews were treated after Hitler's 
armies invaded Poland in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
Once, she said, she watched as Nazis rounded up Jews from a residential 
neighborhood and took them to a forest where they were shot. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a nightmare that changed my life. I witnessed unbelievable things that 
I will never forget. The street was blocked up with barbed wire, and people 
were running all around. I saw a man with a white beard and a little white hat, 
running carrying a Torah. Little ones were screaming 'Mama, Mama!' " she said. 
"I saw a soldier pull a baby out of its mother's arms and throw him to the 
ground. Later, I heard shooting. They were killing innocent people." 
</P>
<P>
"I vowed then that if the opportunity arrived, I would help." 
</P>
<P>
Opdyke took her chance while working in a German officers' club. She was a 
waitress, serving meals to German military men and Gestapo agents, and she also 
supervised the laundry crew -- a dozen Jewish people. As a waitress, Opdyke 
overheard Gestapo agents planning roundups in Jewish neighborhoods, and she 
passed the information to her friends in the laundry room. 
</P>
<P>
"We created a grapevine. I became the ears and eyes for the Jewish people and 
they spread the information around. We were able to save many lives," Opdyke 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the war, Gestapo chatter turned from roundups to labor camps to the 
"final solution" -- the planned liquidation of all Jews in Europe. "I knew if I 
didn't help, my friends will be dead. I started praying and a miracle 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Places to Hide 
</P>
<P>
A German major asked Opdyke to take a job as a housekeeper in his new villa. 
She accepted the job and her Jewish friends hid there for nearly eight months. 
Sometimes they hid in the attic; sometimes in the basement. They also 
discovered a tunnel that led from the house to a small hiding space underneath 
the gazebo in the back yard, where they hid when the officer held large 
functions in his home. 
</P>
<P>
But they were not always careful in the huge villa. Halfway through the eight 
months, the German major came home unexpectedly and found four of the Jewish 
women helping Opdyke in the kitchen. Terrified that her friends would lose 
their lives, Opdyke pleaded with him not to turn them in. 
</P>
<P>
"He put me in his lap and said 'I will keep your secret, but you have to be 
mine. Give an old man his last joy in his life.' I have to do what he said. 
There were too many lives at stake," Opdyke said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Righteous Gentile' 
</P>
<P>
All 12 of her friends survived the Holocaust and in 1982, the Israeli Holocaust 
Commission honored Opdyke as a "righteous Gentile." She is one of only 5,000 
people to be so honored and the only "righteous Gentile" living in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish Home for the Aged administrators said they have a special obligation to 
care for Opdyke's husband, suffering from the advanced stages of Alzheimer's 
disease, because of the sacrifices she made for the Jewish people. 
</P>
<P>
"She risked her life and this is the return we want to give her," said Dena 
Schulman, spokeswoman for the home. 
</P>
<P>
Blumenthal said: "We feel very privileged to have an opportunity to help. You 
can never do enough for this woman." 
</P>
<P>
Opdyke said she has heard many horror stories about nursing homes and was very 
worried about finding good care for her ailing husband, whom she married in 
1956, shortly after arriving in the United States. She is pleased that the 
Jewish Home for the Aged is willing to break their rules to admit him. 
</P>
<P>
"I love him, and I want him to have the best. Who but the Jewish people, who 
understand suffering so much, would be able to care for him so well," she said.

3 CARS SLAM INTO HORSES ON FREEWAY NEAR CASTAIC

<P>
Horses wandering loose on the Golden State Freeway near Castaic caused 
accidents involving four vehicles that left one man and three horses dead and 
another man seriously injured, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"The highway was strewn with dead horses and wrinkled cars for about a mile," 
said Los Angeles Fire Capt. Mike Carrick. 
</P>
<P>
A 19-year-old La Mesa man driving a Chevrolet Monte Carlo was killed about 8:30 
p.m. Saturday when his vehicle struck one of the horses broadside. The impact 
threw the animal into the car's windshield with such force that it partially 
sheered off the vehicle's roof, said California Highway Patrol Officer Mark 
Fessia. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles County coroner's investigator said the man's name was being 
withheld until relatives could be notified. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Passenger Hurt 
</P>
<P>
A passenger in the car, Jonathan Rhodes, 19, of La Mesa, was in fair condition 
with a concussion Sunday at Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital in Valencia, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Fessia said the vehicle was southbound near Templin Highway when it struck one 
of three horses running on the highway. The impact of the collision threw the 
car out of control, causing it to hit another vehicle before stopping more than 
one-third of a mile away. The second car was damaged slightly, but its 
occupants were uninjured, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two other vehicles struck and killed horses, but no one was injured in those 
collisions. 
</P>
<P>
Fessia said he did not know where the horses had come from or how they had 
gotten onto the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Five other horses were on the freeway minutes earlier but were not hit by 
traffic, Fessia said. The drivers of other cars herded the animals off the 
pavement, and they ran away into a canyon, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Fessia said he suspected that the horses had escaped from a nearby ranch. 
Whoever was responsible for the animals' care could face misdemeanor 
manslaughter charges, he said.

CLASSES AT HOSPITAL HELPING YOUNGSTERS TO GET READY FOR THE NEW BABY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sisters are in. Brothers are out. As trends go this spring, baby girls 
overwhelmingly seem to be the sibling of choice. 
</P>
<P>
At least that's the consensus of a group of 3- to 7-year-olds -- whose mothers 
are expecting a second child -- who were asked recently if they wanted a little 
brother or sister. 
</P>
<P>
These children, and their parents, recently participated in a "Sibling 
Preparedness Class" at Scripps Memorial Hospital in Chula Vista. Using dolls, 
storytelling and a tour of the nursery, children as young as 3 are helped to 
grasp the concept of a new brother or sister. Part of the idea, too, is to help 
dispel some of childrens' resentment toward a new sibling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accepting the Sibling 
</P>
<P>
Children, the theory holds, will be more accepting of a new baby if they have 
some basic knowledge of what a newborn looks and acts like, as well as what a 
hospital, where their mothers will be spending time, is like. 
</P>
<P>
The two-hour class is limited to 10 children between the ages of 3 and 8 and is 
taught by obstetrical nurse Linda Castiloeja. Not only does she teach the 
children the fine art of diapering, but she shows them the positive things they 
can do with their new brother or sister. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to make the kids more aware that they have something that belongs to 
them," Castiloeja said. "This is not Mommy's or Daddy's baby, all by 
themselves. I want to let them know this is their baby, too. That way they 
don't get the jealousy." 
</P>
<P>
Castiloeja has been teaching the class for five months and says even the 
youngest participants benefit. "The young kids have images of what's going to 
happen. The big kids are the ones with the questions. If all they (the young 
children) can do is come to the class, they can feel comfortable and allay some 
of their fears of 'What is a hospital?' 'What happens to Mommy?' " 
</P>
<P>
"They can see that this is the nursery and this is what their baby is going to 
look like. If they can just think that, that's fine," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parental Input, Too 
</P>
<P>
The class is an extension of the education these children are receiving from 
their parents, Castiloeja said. Gone are the days when Mommy is unexpectantly 
and inexplicably whisked off to the hospital only to return a few days later 
with a sweetly powdered bundle that all the adults fawn over. 
</P>
<P>
These days, parents are involving their children more with various aspects of 
pregnancy, and classes like the one at Scripps help prepare families for the 
stark reality of a new child joining the family circle. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to show the kids, 'Hey, this is what a baby is like. They kind of look 
funny and smell funny and they might wake you up at night, but it's OK.' I 
think that's the most important thing, to let these kids know that those guilty 
feelings of not feeling comfortable with the baby are normal." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to acclimating the children to the sights, sounds and smells of 
newborns, the class gives parents some tips. Parents are told to place a 
picture of their child in the new baby's hospital crib, which makes it easier 
for their child to pick out his baby among all the others in the nursery. 
</P>
<P>
During class, mothers have their baby's heart beat electronically monitored. 
The subsequent printout is given to their child as a "love letter" from the 
baby to the child. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Popular with Parents 
</P>
<P>
Although the hospital has no statistics on the effectiveness of the sibling 
preparedness program, families have continued to flock to it by little more 
than word of mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Pamela Hay, who recently moved with her family to San Diego from England, heard 
about the program from friends. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to find out how the hospital system worked anyway, so we inquired with 
friends at the church we go to. They told us about the sibling class," Hay 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hay said she wanted to make sure that her 3-year-old daughter, Lorna, would not 
be unduly jealous when the new baby is born. The class is a good follow-through 
to the encouragement they've been giving Lorna at home, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We keep telling her what's happening and what's going to happen," Hay said. "I 
think it's important to see other children going through the same thing as 
well, especially when you've only got one at home. It's a bit more difficult 
for them." 
</P>
<P>
Ari Mora learned about the program from her doctor at the hospital. She brought 
5-year-old Dani to the class because she wants her daughter to know more about 
babies than she did at her daughter's age. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now kids know more than we knew. Our parents kind of treated us like we 
were ignorant. They didn't want to tell us anything about anything. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought this class would be good for her," Mora said of her daughter. "She's 
already helping me with the nursery. We listen to her ideas. I'm trying to keep 
her informed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kids Like It, Too 
</P>
<P>
Seven-year-old Matthew Schneider gave a resounding "Yeah!" with two thumbs up 
when asked if he was excited about his new baby brother, who is due this month. 
His father Gregg was equally enthusiastic about the sibling program. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in the Navy and when we went on CHAMPUS, this was one of the programs we 
read about. We're thrilled. They should of had this when I was a kid." 
</P>
<P>
The class was born out of necessity. Nine years ago, the president of Bay 
Hospital Medical Center (the hospital was taken over by Scripps in 1986) came 
to occupational therapist Norma Horine and obstetrical nurse Ventura McCart 
with a problem. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital executive, concerned about the resentful behavior his 9-year-old 
grandchild was displaying toward a new baby, asked if there was a program that 
could help a child adjust to a new brother or sister. Hyran and McCart came up 
with the Sibling Preparedness Class. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the class was the first of its kind in the state, and Bay Hospital 
was only the fifth hospital in the country to offer it. The sibling class is 
now offered monthly at Scripps in Chula Vista and Scripps in La Jolla. There is 
a nominal fee. 
</P>
<P>
"We put this program together because we felt there was a need for the kids who 
were coming in and showing some resentment toward being new brothers or 
sisters," said McCart, 55, who has been an OB nurse for 36 years and is working 
on her third generation of delivering children. "We had a psychologist involved 
and we did a lot of research based on what other hospitals were doing." 
</P>
<P>
"We were looking for information of what type of need there was, what the 
children needed, what they needed to be exposed to," McCart said. "We looked at 
what could be done in this short class and still be able to help the child cope 
with being a brother or sister." 
</P>
<P>
McCart said that Scripps in Chula Vista delivers about 350 babies a month, 
second only in number to Sharp Memorial Hospital. In the South Bay, where 
families often have more than one child, the sibling class proves especially 
helpful. 
</P>
<P>
"This particular thing I definitely approve of," McCart said. "This is a good 
means of communication, between not only the nurses and these Moms, but with 
their children, too.

ANTI-RACIST ACTIVISTS PICKET, BUT TARGETS ARE NO-SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
About 20 anti-racist activists picketed the Glendale Masonic Lodge on Sunday to 
protest a Bible study conference, but they were a bit late. The final session 
of the three-day conference was called off at the last minute by organizers to 
avoid confrontations, police said. 
</P>
<P>
That announcement, however, did not discourage demonstrators from marching 
around the lodge entrance for more than two hours chanting "No racists, no KKK, 
no fascist USA" and other anti-racist slogans. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was incident-free, but it attracted the largest number of 
Glendale police personnel since white supremacist advocates and anti-racist 
groups clashed in a 1987 mini-riot. 
</P>
<P>
Protesters said the ministers, who had gathered for the Message Prophetic Bible 
Conference this weekend, use religion to conceal and legitimize their racist 
beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Church Denounced 
</P>
<P>
"The so-called 'Christian Identity' or 'Kingdom Identity Church' is not a 
religion, but a racist theology that unites the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis and 
paramilitary survivalists into a national network," said Mike Nadel, spokesman 
for the Glendale-based People Against Racist Terror, organizers of the protest. 
</P>
<P>
Several protesters carried signs denouncing the Identity Church doctrine as a 
form of racism. "Identity preaches hatred," one of them read. 
</P>
<P>
The protest failed to attract a large crowd, but it got the Police Department's 
full attention. 
</P>
<P>
More than 80 Glendale police officers surrounded the demonstration site, 
setting up a headquarters tent in a parking lot across the street. A police 
helicopter provided extra surveillance and an anti-riot unit monitored the 
gathering from nearby rooftops. At least three other policemen filmed and 
photographed the demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Better Be Prepared' 
</P>
<P>
"Better be prepared than come up short-handed," said police spokesman Dean 
Durand. "When we prepared for this incident we had no idea that one of the 
factions would not show up." 
</P>
<P>
Durand said the demonstrators were filmed because "we always videotape 
incidents. It's useful in court presentations, and it's an excellent training 
tool." 
</P>
<P>
Pastor Robert Record, who hosted the conference, could not be reached for 
comment at his Escondido home. Record has a Los Angeles-area radio program 
called National Message. 
</P>
<P>
Nadel said Record preaches in his monthly radio broadcasts that descendants of 
people from Britain and Scandinavia are God's Chosen People, that interracial 
marriages are against God's will and that Blacks are "pre-Adam" humans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anti-Semitism 
</P>
<P>
"Under the guise of religion he preaches anti-Semitism, racism and hatred 
towards gays," Nadel said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the protesters called themselves "skinheads," a group known for holding 
pro-Nazi views. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to clear the skinhead name," said Jonehen E., who would not give his 
last name but said he was a spokesman for Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice, 
or SHARP. "Skinhead stands for patriotism and individualism, not racial hatred. 
That's why we're here, and we'll keep going to demonstrations to change that 
perception." 
</P>
<P>
Durand said he was happy to see the afternoon go by peacefully. "We had every 
intention of not allowing another incident like the one at the Holiday Inn," he 
said, referring to the mini-riot after a 1987 public appearence by avowed white 
supremacist J.B. Stoner at the Glendale Holiday Inn.

ONE ERROR IS 1 TOO MANY FOR PADRES; 
</P>
<P>
COLLISION OF GWYNN AND WYNNE LEADS TO 7-3 VICTORY FOR CUBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was just another one of those "I've got it . . . no, you've got it . . . no, 
I've got it" afternoons with the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
After surviving six errors to defeat the Cubs here Saturday night, the Padres 
were burned by just one on Sunday, losing, 7-3, in a game that was over as 
quickly as you can say "Heads up." 
</P>
<P>
Second inning, score tied 2-2, two Cubs on base but two out. Chicago's Ryne 
Sandberg apparently ends the inning with a drifting fly ball to center field. 
Or is that left field? Padre outfielders Tony Gwynn and Marvell Wynne, two 
polite sorts who normally stay out of each other's business, couldn't agree. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn, the center fielder who has veto power over every ball hit into the 
outfield, ran toward left field with his eyes fixed only on the ball. It was an 
easy catch and the end of an inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm shouting, 'I've got it, I've got it,' " Gwynn explained. 
</P>
<P>
With one exception, those three words are usually sufficient when claiming a 
fly ball most anywhere in the English-speaking world. 
</P>
<P>
The exception is, when somebody is within 10 feet shouting the same three 
words. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Wynne, in left field as a starter for the first time in eight games. He 
acted as if it was his ball and, according to Gwynn, "Marvell said he was also 
shouting, 'I got it, I got it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn has to take Wynne's word for it, because Gwynn never heard him. Never saw 
him either. And Wynne obviously didn't see Gwynn. As the ball hung up in the 
cool air, it was one of those plays in which everyone in the park knows there 
will be a collision -- except the two unfortunates who are about to collide. 
</P>
<P>
The ball and Wynne reached the web of Gwynn's glove at precisely the same time. 
Wynne, being a few pounds heavier than the ball, won. He barreled into Gwynn's 
glove and knocked the ball down to the grass and by the time they had this 
thing figured out, Sandberg was on third base and two runs had scored and the 
Cubs never trailed again. 
</P>
<P>
And Gwynn still hasn't seen Wynne. 
</P>
<P>
"I never knew he was coming," Gwynn said. "I was so far in center field when 
the ball was hit, I couldn't look at him, I had to keep concentrating on the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I felt something hit me . . . but I still thought I had the ball. Then I 
looked down and man, it wasn't there." 
</P>
<P>
Wynne, who has family in Chicago, left the clubhouse quickly afterward and was 
unavailable for comment. But the fact that he was given a three-base error, and 
the fact that those two runs stood up for the rest of the afternoon, spoke for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"You never know what a difference that made," Manager Jack McKeon said. "That 
out is made, you've still got a 2-2 game, and who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly trailing and frustrated, the Padres turned Cub starter Scott Sanderson 
into Rick Sutcliffe, only touching Sanderson for one run on three hits in 
Sanderson's five innings of work after the error. 
</P>
<P>
The error didn't do much for Padre starter Eric Show's karma either. Just when 
it looked as if he would be out of the inning safely, he was knocked silly by 
the two-run punch and wound up allowing two more runs two innings later, one of 
them on a rare wild pitch, to finish with his worst start of the year (four 
innings, four earned runs). 
</P>
<P>
"The mistakes I made today were ridiculous," said Show, who allowed, among 
other things, Sanderson's first base hit since 1987 and Mitch Webster's first 
hit in his last 30 at-bats, a grounder that bounced off the resin bag behind 
the mound for a single. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I'm at the stage where I should overcome those things," added Show, 4-2 
with a 3.79 ERA. "But today it was like, I was standing on the mound saying, 
'What the heck is going on?' And it had nothing to do with the error. It was 
all my fault. I handed them the game." 
</P>
<P>
All told, in front of 28,735 jeerers at Wrigley Field, it wasn't a pretty way 
to end a pretty good trip. The Padres still flew home Sunday night with an 8-5 
trip record, their most wins on a trip since 1985. But they have lost two of 
their last three games, and could have easily lost all three because they 
committed those six errors in the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's a team people are picking to win a world championship, and we just take 
two of three from them," Cub Manager Don Zimmer said energetically. 
</P>
<P>
Admitted Gwynn: "You like to have a nice flight home, you like to end a trip 
with a win. If you can only win one out of three games in a town, you always 
like it to be the last one, so you can go home thinking and talking about it." 
</P>
<P>
But the Padres, who have ended April 14-12 and in second place, one game behind 
West Division-leading Cincinnati, are still in good shape, right? 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn paused. "Yeah. I hope so." 
</P>
<P>
The worries center around the hitting and fielding, which if nothing else is a 
tribute to the work of reliever Mark Davis and the starting pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres batted just .224 on the trip, scoring just 44 runs, or 3.4 runs per 
game. Then there was the trip's fielding -- committing 15 errors in 13 games 
will not win as much as it will embarrass. 
</P>
<P>
"But look at it -- even with all that, we still had a good trip and have a 
pretty decent record," McKeon said. "That should show that when everything 
comes around, we'll be OK." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Clark, who was rested Sunday, agreed. "Look how we're not letting the 
close games slip away (7-0 in one-run games, best in the National League)," he 
said. "We could easily be five or six games under .500. Until we get rolling, 
we have to hold on. But that's OK, because we're holding on." 
</P>
<P>
With the National League East's top three teams on their agenda in the next 
couple of weeks -- St. Louis, New York Mets and Montreal -- their grip will 
have to tighten. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a great trip," Clark said. "But coming up, we're going to have to play 
better. And we know it." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Alomar was rested Sunday, missing his first start of the season and 
leaving Tony Gwynn as the only Padre to start in all 26 games thus far. Alomar 
made the first pinch-hit appearance of his career in the seventh inning and 
flied out against Scott Sanderson to end the inning with a runner on first. The 
reason Alomar was finally benched was obvious -- he had an horrendous trip, 
during which he batted .212 (11 for 52) with six errors in 14 games, giving him 
11 errors overall. Late Saturday, after committing three errors in the Padres 
5-4 win here, Alomar said, "I'm just not going to worry about it anymore, man. 
I'm just going to play ball and not think about it. That's the only way I can 
handle it. I get a lot of errors because I cover a lot of ground, so I'm just 
going to play my game and put it out of my mind." Alomar is expected back in 
the lineup today against St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Clark doesn't sound very excited about meeting his old teammates from St. 
Louis today for the first time since leaving them to join the New York Yankees 
in the winter of 1987. "I'm looking forward to getting it over with," he said. 
"I've got a lot of old friends over there, it will be nice to see them . . . 
but as far as extra energy or juice is concerned, nah, I just want to win the 
game. It will be just another one of those distractions that we have to get 
through before we can get on with our season."

<P>
Dan McAdoo's one-out single to left field scored Chuck Graham from second base 
in the bottom of the 10th inning to give the University of San Diego a 7-6 
victory over visiting Nevada Reno in the Toreros' final Western Conference 
Athletic Conference baseball game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Toreros scored four runs in the eighth inning to take a 6-5 lead, but 
Nevada Reno tied the score in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Keen went three for four with a triple for USD (20-30-1 overall, 5-17 in 
the conference). Tony Battilega (4-5) was the winner in relief. Nevada Reno is 
26-26, 9-11.

JACK SMITH: THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF A PANTS-CHASER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that John Tower has tumbled into the abyss of celebrities past, there may 
be no point in trying to find a feminine counterpart for the word womanizer. 
</P>
<P>
Womanizer is defined as "a man who is sexually promiscuous with women." As 
applied to Tower by the media, however, it had the added meaning of a man of 
political power who used that power to attract and dominate women. 
</P>
<P>
Because relatively few women hold positions of power in Washington, and because 
those few are known to be exquisitely circumspect in their relations with men, 
there hardly seems any need for an opposite to womanizer. 
</P>
<P>
However, as more and more women reach positions of power, and as we cannot 
expect them to be any less aggressive than men in its use, perhaps the media, 
at least, should have a word handy in case the need arises. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Wahl of Pacific Palisades suggests vamp, "a woman of seductive charm and 
sensuality who is unscrupulous in her exploitation of men." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Barnard of San Clemente suggests femme fatale -- "an alluring woman, 
especially one who leads men to their downfall and ruin." 
</P>
<P>
Excellent words, though somewhat mildewed; their fault is that they imply women 
who destroy men, not merely use them. 
</P>
<P>
Olivette Sprague says, "What's wrong with nymphomaniac?. . . . It comes on 
pretty strong, but I'm sure the media would have found much worse things to 
call a female who was under fire as was John Tower." 
</P>
<P>
Maurice Zolotow, the Hollywood historian, confesses long and exhausting 
liaisons with not one but two nymphomaniacs, one after the other, when he first 
came to Hollywood. After they took up with other men, he searched for yet 
another nymphomaniac, but never found one. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of these not entirely disagreeable experiences, Zolotow feels, as I 
do, that nymphomaniac designates a mentally unbalanced woman, not simply one 
whose enjoyment of sex is indiscriminate and unrestrained. He suggests, 
instead, nymphomaniste. "It has a better feel to it and besides it has the 
soupcon of Gallicism which is necessary in amorous matters." 
</P>
<P>
But my colleague Doc Johnson favors nymphomaniac. "I fancy that a nymphomaniac 
would revel in the attentions of a womanizer, and vice versa." 
</P>
<P>
But he thinks nymphomaniacs are no easier to find than Zolotow's third one. 
"I'm quite willing to concede that womanizers exist and that nymphomaniacs are 
as ephemeral as the mayfly, as easy to hold in one's hands as the 
will-o-the-wisp, a Chimera (impossible or foolish fancy). . . ." 
</P>
<P>
I do not concede, in any case, that nymphomaniacs are the opposites of 
womanizers; and if there are such females, I doubt that a womanizer would be 
interested in pursuing one, any more than a nymphomaniac would be interested in 
pursuing a womanizer. Both of them, I should think, would be drawn toward the 
young and innocent. Just as a womanizing senator might be expected to use his 
power on a dependent secretary, so a nymphomaniac senator, if one should ever 
be elected, would be interested in virile young men of a lower political order. 
</P>
<P>
For the sake of our country's moral welfare, let us hope that Johnson is right, 
and that the nymphomaniac is but a fancy. 
</P>
<P>
Gerhard Henschke of Van Nuys notes: "The German language that had not the 
Puritanic and Victorian traditions had the very colorful word Mannertoll (mad 
for men) while the word for womanizer is Schurzenjager (apron hunter), which 
clearly indicates the class consciousness of the 'Herren' who abuse the maids."

<P>
Finally, I am obliged to correct at least half of my friend Sara Boynoff's 
statement: "There is no feminine counterpart for the word womanizer. Just as 
there is no feminine counterpart of the word cuckold." 
</P>
<P>
"Your reader was wrong about there being no word for a female cuckold," writes 
Barry S. Rein of Azusa. "It is cuckquean. Look it up in the Oxford English 
Dictionary." 
</P>
<P>
I did. And it's there. But it's obsolete. Probably hasn't been used (until 
today) since the 17th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Frank W. Ellis of Los Alamitos raises another question. "There is 
also no equivalent female term opposite to avuncular. Walter Cronkite is often 
described as avuncular. What is Betty Friedan?" 
</P>
<P>
That's an interesting question.

From the fog of London to the glitter of Hollywood to the sands of the Sahara, 
there are no boundaries for Sissy Harrington-McGill and her holistic pet food. 
Whether it's royalty's horses, a celebrity's chow chow or a sheik's camel, when 
pampered pets get hungry, their concerned owners look to El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
What started out as a small dog food business in 1974 out of 
Harrington-McGill's La Mesa home has now turned into a multipurpose pet product 
center -- Solid Gold Animal Nutrition Center at 1483 Cuyamaca St. 
</P>
<P>
So what makes the Queen of England and so many other celebrities go for the 
Gold? The answer is in the food's ingredients, some of which are said to be 
unique to the pet world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stumbled Upon Business 
</P>
<P>
According to Harrington-McGill, her introduction to the pet products field came 
by accident while searching overseas for Great Danes. 
</P>
<P>
"I bred Great Danes as a hobby," Harrington-McGill said. "After losing three of 
them to bloat, I decided to go to Germany to buy another. I visited 44 kennels 
until I found the dog I was looking for. In fact, I bought two of them." 
</P>
<P>
While there, she asked the owner of the kennel, Baron Hans-Georg von Maischack, 
if he knew what caused bloat. To her surprise, he said he had never heard of 
the canine ailment because it doesn't exist in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Bloat, according to Dean Gahring, president of the San Diego County Veterinary 
Assn., kills about 500 dogs a week in the United States. The specific cause is 
unknown, he said, but it's mainly because of gastric torsion -- where the 
stomach twists from 90 to 100 degrees or more, causing the juncture between the 
stomach and the esophagus, and the stomach and small intestines to close. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe he had never heard of it." Harrington-McGill said. "There 
wasn't even a word for it. This baffled both me and the kennel owner, so we 
began to explore the cause of bloat." 
</P>
<P>
After the two talked, they discovered that dogs in Germany and the United 
States have different diets. German dog food contains mainly fish and no animal 
fat, preservatives or soybeans. In the United States, some of the main 
ingredients are chicken, animal fat, sugar and soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
Her conviction that bloat stemmed from dietary differences led 
Harrington-McGill to purchase a recipe Von Maischack had developed over the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"Since Great Danes were originally from Germany, it made sense to me that they 
should eat the food they had eaten for generations," she said. "I wasn't sure 
if diet was the main cause for the ailment, but it sounded like the most 
logical one." 
</P>
<P>
After buying two Great Danes, and with her new dog food recipe in hand, she 
returned to this country. For several months after that, she crisscrossed the 
states in search of a mill that would put together her formula. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really hard to get anybody interested in making this formula," she 
said. "It wasn't the ingredients, it was the quantity and type of kibble I 
wanted. I just wanted it for my dogs, so I only needed a little, but most 
manufacturers said they didn't work with small amounts." 
</P>
<P>
Harrington-McGill said she decided to "play it their way," and, after finding a 
receptive mill in Los Angeles, she placed a 10-ton order for small-pellet, 
hard-baked kibbles. 
</P>
<P>
Pleased with the outcome, she said she continued feeding her dogs the kibble 
and noticed how well they responded to it. Apparently, she wasn't the only one 
to notice. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was showing my Great Danes at dog shows, people would comment on their 
gleaming coats and asked what I was feeding them," she said. "That's the first 
thing people ask when they see a dog in good condition." 
</P>
<P>
After a couple of months, she had several people asking her if she could "throw 
in an extra bag of kibble" when ordering her dogs' food from the mill. 
</P>
<P>
"In the begining, I had extra bags so I gave some to my friends," said 
Harrington-McGill, who was working then as an elementary school teacher. "But, 
after a while, I had to put in larger orders to accommodate everyone." 
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1974, she was ordering 4 to 5 tons of kibble monthly. Realizing 
that there were tantalizing business possibilities, she decided to test her 
dog-food formula to see what form was most marketable. 
</P>
<P>
During those experiments, she said, she found that the hard-baked kibble sold 
best. 
</P>
<P>
"It was such a new concept, no one in the United States had anything like it," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
By 1978, when Harrington-McGill's monthly manufacturing total had reached 7 
tons, she resigned from her teaching position to give full-time attention to 
her dog-food venture. She also began selling food products for cats, horses and 
other animals. 
</P>
<P>
"You are what you eat, and that goes for animals, too," she said. "Most people 
really care about their animals, so why not give them the best?" 
</P>
<P>
Harrington-McGill started a mail-order business and offered products such as 
Seal Meal, Herbal Wormer, Natural Flea Powder and Natural Flee Shampoo. 
Initially, she ran the business out of her home and a rented warehouse, but in 
1984 she moved to her present location in El Cajon, where, in addition to the 
food, she also sells a animal accessories. 
</P>
<P>
As business grew, so did her marketing strategies. While attending a trade show 
in England, she said she sneaked through an unopen gate in the back of 
Buckingham Palace in an attempt to give her products to Queen Elizabeth II. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe I got in there," she said. "But, as soon as I was in, a 
guard caught me and asked me what I wanted. I quickly showed him two of my 
products and asked him if he could give the samples to Her Majesty." 
</P>
<P>
Although the guard assured her that he would do so, Harrington-McGill left 
assuming that he would simply discard her samples after she was gone. Three 
weeks later, however, she was shocked when she received a $1,700 telephone 
order from Buckingham Palace for a product called Solid Gold Golden Edge, which 
contains natural herbs believed to induce calm in animals. 
</P>
<P>
Through word of mouth, her products soon came to the attention of other royalty 
and celebrities. Shortly after the queen's order was placed, she received a 
call from a man she described as an Arab sheik asking for $2,200 worth of her 
products. Over the years, her client list grew to include such notables as 
Frank Sinatra, Zsa Zsa Gabor, William Shatner, Stephanie Powers and director 
John Frankenheimer. 
</P>
<P>
Most of her clients, however, are everyday people with the same goal in mind 
that she had at the outset: finding healthy food for their pets. Today, about 
80% of her business is conducted by mail order. The rest of her sales occur at 
her El Cajon store and other outlets throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Solid Gold is the stuff of a health-minded dog owner's dream or just 
one more entrepreneurial spin in in the crowded animal products market is hard 
to say now. Dean Gahring said he wouldn't rule it out that Solid Gold is all 
Harrington-McGill says it is, but there no studies have been done to confirm 
it. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, business has been so good, Harrington-McGill said she hasn't 
had time to think about it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all happened so rapidly, I'm too busy to be surprised," she said. "I just 
keep working at it."

PLO SAID TO OK KILLING OF ARAB COLLABORATORS 
</P>

RAMALLAH, Israeli-occupied West Bank 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials of the Palestine Liberation Organization abroad have given formal 
approval to the killing of Arabs accused of collaborating with Israel in the 
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, pro-PLO Palestinian sources say. 
</P>
<P>
In separate conversations held during the past week in Jerusalem and in the 
West Bank cities of Ramallah and Nablus, activists defended the slaying of 
suspected collaborators as a measure needed to assure continuation of the Arab 
uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied areas. They claim that Israeli 
intelligence inroads, spearheaded by collaborators, have resulted in numerous 
arrests and ambushes and put key figures in the underground leadership at risk. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Final OK From Tunisia 
</P>
<P>
The militants described an elaborate process of ad hoc trials and "sentences" 
passed on collaborators, a process by which secret Palestinian "courts" 
consider testimony as well as confessions extracted in clandestine prisons. 
Conclusions are sent to Tunisia, where the PLO is headquartered, for final 
approval before punishment is meted out. 
</P>
<P>
In exceptional cases, when the collaborator is well-known, Palestinians 
dispense with the secret proceedings and stop short of involving the PLO. In 
one such case last Friday, Kamel Saleh abu Zand was shot to death in the main 
square of Nablus for having been a chief informer while serving a long jail 
term. He had been on the streets only two weeks after being freed. 
</P>
<P>
A member of a self-styled "hit team" walked up to Abu Zand in broad daylight, 
witnesses said, tapped him on the shoulder and told him, "The revolution has 
condemned you to death." He then shot Abu Zand twice in the head with a pistol 
and escaped into a maze of alleys in Nablus' old central neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"It was absolutely necessary that he be liquidated publicly," a source close to 
the underground leadership said. "The people must see justice being done and 
authority being asserted." 
</P>
<P>
During the last 15 days, 11 accused collaborators have been "executed" in the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip. It has been the worst outbreak of Arab violence 
directed against Arabs during the entire intifada, as the uprising is called in 
Arabic. 
</P>
<P>
The killings were seized upon by Israeli officials as proof that the PLO is 
wedded to terror and keeps a foothold in the West Bank and Gaza only through 
threats of assassination. Israel has been trying to persuade the Bush 
Administration to break off its dialogue with the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a wave of terror," Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said. "Not a day 
passes without people being killed who are suspected of not being 100% 
supporters of the PLO line. People are burned alive, people are knifed, people 
are shot." 
</P>
<P>
Arens blames the violence for the rejection by Palestinian leaders of Israel's 
plan to hold elections in the occupied areas. Last week, 83 Palestinian leaders 
signed a document rejecting the plan. They said the proposal was unacceptable 
because it did not include a guarantee of eventual independence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Knew' of Likely Fate 
</P>
<P>
Arens asserted that the signers "knew that if their names weren't put at the 
bottom of that piece of paper, they might suffer" a fate similar to that of 
accused collaborators. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli intelligence sources say that their supply of informants for the Shin 
Bet, which runs a spy network in the West Bank and Gaza, shrunk during the 
first months of the intifada but has been restored through recruitment over 
time. The only problem now, they insist, is that -- with the persistence of the 
uprising -- they need more information from a pool of helpers that, at best, is 
growing no larger. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinians reject Arens' suggestion that the killings are aimed at 
politically silencing Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
"These are pure and simple cases of security. The collaborators provide names 
to the Israelis, they tell them about the organizations of the uprising. In 
short, they spy on their own people," said Ziad abu Amer, a pro-PLO political 
science professor at Birzeit University in Ramallah. "There is no national 
liberation movement in the world that tolerates activity that endangers its 
very existence." 
</P>
<P>
Added a street organizer in Ramallah: "No one is killed for the sake of 
killing. There is enough evidence. The collaborators are warned two, three 
times. This is not political assassination." 
</P>
<P>
At least 32 accused collaborators have been killed in the nearly 17 months of 
the intifada. Since Jan. 1, 18 have been "executed" by a variety of means. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Victims' Bodies Found 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Ribhi Bani Odeh, 22, was found in a field near the West Bank village 
of Tamoun beaten fatally around the head. Palestinians said he informed 
directly on Arab activities to Israel intelligence agents. Fayek Arar, 38, 
accused of arranging land sales to the Israelis, was killed by gunfire when he 
answered the door of his home in the village of Ras Atiya. 
</P>
<P>
Azzam Kadi, 21, was found in an abandoned room in Nablus' central Old City axed 
to death; he was accused of being an informant. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the killings, including the Nablus slaying of Abu Zand, were of former 
inmates suspected of informing while in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources in Nablus assert that Abu Zand was a "bird," an informer 
who wins the confidence of Palestinian prisoners and gets them to talk, 
thinking that he is in sympathy with them. 
</P>
<P>
"After we are interrogated, we are thrown into cells with other Palestinians. 
Sometimes, we think we are among friends and we begin to talk," said a former 
prisoner in Nablus. "We make a mistake and give a name. And the bird sings to 
the Israelis." 
</P>
<P>
The system of "courts" has grown up in the last few months and is a means of 
asserting the authority of intifada leaders in towns and villages as well as 
formally judging cases of collusion with Israelis, Palestinian sources said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Procedure Described 
</P>
<P>
Written accusations are passed around to Palestinian lawyers for their 
opinions. If the collaborator himself is questioned, his testimony is also 
circulated. When the lawyers make a recommendation, it is passed to the 
underground intifada leadership. The leadership passes a sentence which is 
communicated to the PLO for formal approval. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, "court documents" are provided; in one case, a videotaped confession 
was sent to Tunisia. 
</P>
<P>
"With the PLO involved, we avoid the problem of groups disagreeing over 
sentences. The PLO takes responsibility and unity is maintained," said one 
activist. 
</P>
<P>
The "hit teams," which are the undercover authority in many neighborhoods and 
villages, carry out the sentences. There are sentences less than the maximum; 
two weeks ago, a prostitute in Nablus was raped and brutally beaten after being 
accused of passing information to the Israeli authorities and attempting to 
blackmail women in her charge to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, vandals burned the front door of the house of Hassan Tawil, 
the Israeli-appointed mayor of El Bireh, next door to Ramallah. After the 
incident, Tawil said he was going to resign, but he later withdrew the 
resignation, according to Reuters news service. He has been the target of 
numerous attacks during the intifada. 
</P>
<P>
Some Palestinians fear that the upsurge of killings might set off intra-Arab 
violence that would weaken the intifada from within. But they say that the 
multiple warnings given suspects allays suspicions that the death sentences are 
the result of mere feuds. 
</P>
<P>
"Even families are informed," said one member of a "hit team" in Nablus.

CHIPPEWA FISHING RIGHTS DISPUTE STIRS LAKE COUNTRY 
</P>

<P>
At nightfall, deep within thick stands of white birch and pine, the one they 
call Eagle Woman burns sweet grass and waves feathers over a small band of 
Chippewa to purify them for the mission ahead. 
</P>
<P>
The braves take drags off a ceremonial pipe, offer apologies to the fish they 
are about to spear and dip their boats into the icy, gin-clear waters of 
Rainbow Lake. Guided by bright lamps, they glide silently toward 
gravel-bottomed shallow waters where the tasty walleyed pike go to spawn 
shortly after the spring thaw. 
</P>
<P>
Back on shore, the pristine atmosphere of the North Woods has turned more 
surreal than serene. 
</P>
<P>
"Get a job!" someone shrieks from a pack of 100 or so hecklers kept at bay by 
riot-helmeted police with dogs. 
</P>
<P>
"Hope you have fun out there, you big grease balls!" 
</P>
<P>
"Equal rights for all Americans!" 
</P>
<P>
"Timber niggers!" 
</P>
<P>
"Spear an Indian, save a walleye!" 
</P>
<P>
The protesters, local whites who resent special fishing privileges granted the 
Chippewa, try to rush the boat landing. Some are immediately arrested, while 
others defy orders to retreat behind police lines and sit down at the water's 
edge. Eventually, they are dragged off to jail as well. 
</P>
<P>
One night last week, 35 demonstrators were charged with disorderly conduct. One 
man, complaining of chest pains, was carried away by paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
Such confrontations have become a rite of spring in these parts since a court 
decision in 1983 gave the Chippewa wide latitude to gather food throughout much 
of northern Wisconsin. The court held that the rights were guaranteed by two 
19th-Century treaties in which the tribes ceded the territory to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, a follow-up court ruling broadened the off-reservation prerogatives 
of thousands of Chippewa who live on five reservations in the area. As a 
result, the Chippewa are gearing up for a huge harvest of prized walleyed pike, 
and many non-Indian residents predict that the fishing season will be ruined. 
Arrests are running at a record pace since the Chippewa began spearing walleye 
a week ago, and a cherished getaway spot for millions of Midwesterners now 
crackles with wild rumors, paranoia and ugly epithets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Tension Ever 
</P>
<P>
Dave Kunelius of the Wisconsin Natural Resources Department said: "Tensions are 
higher than they've ever been." 
</P>
<P>
Although the treaty rights apply to all fish, the dispute revolves primarily 
around the walleye, a cold-water species prized by outdoorsmen and highly 
vulnerable to spearing because of its spawning habits. Shortly after the last 
of the winter's ice melts, adult walleyes mass each night in clear, shallow 
waters of the lake to lay and fertilize eggs. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of using rods and reels, the Chippewa shine bright lights into the 
water to catch the reflection of the light-sensitive "wall eyes" of the fish, 
then stab them with 14-foot-long spears. It is a highly efficient method of 
killing that is outlawed for all other fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
Indian spearfishing was once confined to the reservations. With tribal rights 
newly upheld, Chippewa leaders have announced plans to spearfish over the next 
few weeks on 254 of the 861 tiny lakes in the region that are prime walleye 
habitat -- nearly three times as many as last year. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Indians have set voluntary limits on the size of their catch, they 
still are hauling in walleye by the bucketful. At Rainbow Lake the other night, 
19 spearfishers came away with 375 fish, nearly half of what the state sets as 
the maximum safe take from that lake for the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rod and Reel Limits 
</P>
<P>
Once the regular fishing season gets under way Saturday, state conservation 
officials say that on many of the lakes, sportsmen may be limited to taking one 
or two walleye a day, down from the usual limit of five, to prevent 
overfishing. 
</P>
<P>
And that has many non-Indian residents madder than a muskie with a lure in its 
jaws. Resort owners, fishing guides and others whose economic survival depends 
on the lakes see their security in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
Celia Slonicker, one of those arrested at Rainbow Lake, said many anglers do 
not want to spend hundreds of dollars to catch only a few fish, and are 
canceling reservations for May and June. "We sunk everything we had into our 
business," said Slonicker, who has rented only two of the seven cabins at her 
Squirrel Lake resort for the opening of walleye season. "I'm not hostile, I'm 
not a racist, but my livelihood right now is standing on the edge." 
</P>
<P>
Critics say the treaty provisions are antiquated, ecologically unsound and 
discriminate against non-Indians. And they charge that tribal leaders are 
pressing their claims primarily to fatten a multimillion-dollar buyout of 
fishing rights that state leaders hope to negotiate with the Chippewa. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Indians Under Guard 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, protesters have threatened to harass Indian spearfishers, who are 
guarded on both land and water by large contingents of police and game wardens 
in an operation state officials estimate will cost at least $500,000 over the 
coming weeks. In a show of strength, more than 2,000 demonstrators turned out 
for a recent anti-treaty rally in the resort center of Minocqua. Last week, 
another 400 demonstrators descended on the state Capitol in Madison to demand 
that both state and federal officials pressure Congress into abrogating the 
treaties. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians see it quite differently. Even with their special powers, they 
expect to snag only 25,000 to 30,000 walleye, a fraction of the catch of 
800,000 fish expected to be hauled in across the state this year. And that, 
insist the Chippewa and their sympathizers, is vivid proof that many protesters 
have seized on the fishing issue as an excuse to vent deep-seated hostilities 
toward American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a right we've had even before the treaties existed," said Mike Allen, 
chief of the Lac du Flambeau tribe of Chippewa. "It's something we've always 
done. It's part of our life." 
</P>
<P>
Many prominent whites agree that the economic threat posed by spearfishing may 
have been blown out of proportion. "We had the same problems last spring, and 
most merchants will tell you that they had their best summer ever," said Steve 
Semmelmyer, president of the Minocqua Chamber of Commerce. " . . . This is a 
wrenching situation (for Indians) because every day, their whole heritage is 
being challenged and degraded. How many times can you be called a timber nigger 
and not strike back?" 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, the situation highlights a gulf of distrust and 
misunderstanding that is even wider than the one that separates whites and 
blacks in many large urban centers. On the Lac du Flambeau reservation, home to 
the most militant of the Chippewa bands, more than 60% of the residents are 
unemployed. Whites in nearby Minocqua complain openly that the Indians are lazy 
and would rather accept generous government handouts than work. Many Indians, 
on the other hand, say the merchants in town and at the resorts will not hire 
them and do not respect their traditions. 
</P>
<P>
One of those traditions is spearfishing, practiced in these parts since at 
least the 18th Century, when the first permanent Chippewa settlements were 
established. The Lac du Flambeau earned their French name for the torches they 
carried on the lakes while spearfishing at night. 
</P>

Fished Off Reservation 
</P>
<P>
After the treaties were signed in 1837 and 1842, the Chippewa confined 
spearfishing to the reservations, where they were not subject to state 
regulations. But in 1974, Chippewa activists decided to test their treaty 
rights. Two members of the Lac Courte Oreilles band in northwestern Wisconsin 
deliberately crossed reservation boundaries while ice-fishing. Game wardens 
arrested them for illegal possession of a spear. 
</P>
<P>
That set in motion a long series of legal battles culminated in 1983 with a 
federal appellate court's ruling that the treaties guaranteed to the tribes the 
right to "hunt, fish and gather" on public lands in the ceded territories. The 
U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of the case, indirectly affirming 
the lower court's decision. 
</P>
<P>
While triggering a firestorm of protest from whites, the treaty-rights victory 
also has led to friction within the tribes as members battle over what to do 
with their new-found asset. Many want to cash in on the bounty and sell fishing 
rights back to the state, but traditionalists see spearfishing as a priceless 
tribal legacy. 
</P>
<P>
"It took us a long time to get our rights back and I'd hate to see them go 
again, even if the price is good," said John Thompson, a member of the Lac du 
Flambeau tribal council who said his walleye catch will feed his wife, six 
children and mother for months to come. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Resources Cited 
</P>
<P>
Although the walleye is at the center of the dispute, protest leaders insist 
the controversy has far broader implications. Dean Crist, a Minocqua pizza 
parlor operator who heads a group called Stop Treaty Abuse, warned that the 
Chippewa eventually plan to claim other natural assets vital to the local 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
"They're pretty much holding us by the jugular," said Crist. "After fish, 
they'll go for timber." 
</P>
<P>
Tribal leaders do not flatly deny the assertions. "The old cliche is 'if you 
don't use it, you lose it,' " said Tom Maulson, a Lac du Flambeau tribal judge 
who heads an intertribal task force on treaty rights. "Hunting or trapping or 
timber or whatever, it's important that the tribe go out and utilize the 
resources it has." 
</P>
<P>
Such statements infuriate some non-Indians, who insist the main goal of the 
Chippewa is to stick it to white people regardless of the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Discrimination Claimed 
</P>
<P>
"They're taking our mother walleye in the spawning beds and raping our lakes," 
said Marilyn Cox, owner of the Estrold Resort on Little St. Germain Lake. "It's 
discrimination against the rest of us, and they're destroying the economy in 
the northern third of Wisconsin." 
</P>
<P>
Indian activists scoff at such suggestions. They see the treaty controversy as 
a tool that can be used to help rebuild the pride of a long-suffering people. 
"As Indian people, we only have one thing left, and that's our identity," said 
James Yellowbank, a native Winnebago who came to observe the protests on behalf 
of an Indian affairs committee of the National Council of Churches. 
</P>
<P>
"The treaties are the legitimate and political protections of our identity."

Battleground Over Walleys 
</P>
<P>
Chippewa Indians on five reservations have announced plans to spear spawning 
walleyed pike in up to 254 of the 861 lakes containing the fish in the northern 
third of Wisconsin. Under treaty rights, the Chippewa plan to take a major 
portion of the state's allowable harvest in each lake, prompting confrontations 
with white fishermen.

THE RIGHT PRESSES CASE ON CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a quarter-century of protest rallies on campus, a very unusual thing 
happened a few weeks ago at UC Berkeley. A student-run newspaper printed an 
editorial in praise of campus police and their handling of demonstrations and 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you for not protesting your perpetual mistreatment," editors of the 
California Review declared to the pleasantly surprised police force. "You 
deserve better!" 
</P>
<P>
The monthly paper was making its debut as a conservative voice at a school 
usually considered a center of liberal thought. In the process, it was also 
joining a growing number of journals nationwide that are challenging the notion 
that campus publications are almost by their nature left of center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shift in Views 
</P>
<P>
In part, the publications reflect a shift among college students: As a group, 
they are more diverse politically than a generation ago, and young 
conservatives are much more vocal in opposing what they say is the 
overwhelmingly liberal influence of college professors and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
But the recent growth in the numbers of such papers also reflects a concerted 
effort by a group of leading conservatives with headquarters in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"These are alternatives to the mainstream campus press, which is typically left 
of center," says Leslie Lenkowsky, president of the Institute for Educational 
Affairs (IEA), which offers money, advertising and encouragement to a loose 
network of publications at 43 American colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the best-known paper is the pugnacious Dartmouth Review, which has 
been battling the administration of that New Hampshire college in an ugly 
dispute involving charges of racism, anti-Semitism and censorship. In 
California, Stanford, UC Berkeley, UC Santa Cruz, UC San Diego, Occidental 
College and San Jose State all have such papers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Liberal Counterattack 
</P>
<P>
The IEA -- founded by such conservatives as writer Irving Kristol and former 
Treasury Secretary William E. Simon -- has been successful enough to prompt 
concerns of undue influence as well as a liberal counterattack. Some colleges 
complain that the publications, egged on by the older conservatives to promote 
their own ends, are purposefully disruptive and promote intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, some of the conservative student editors say they themselves 
are the victims of intolerance and censorship. Such a charge carries special 
sting at institutions that pride themselves as centers of free intellectual 
discourse. 
</P>
<P>
"Supposedly what they were fighting for in the '60s was the free speech 
movement," said Marc Thiessen, editor in chief of the Vassar Spectator. "Today 
free speech exists on college campuses for everyone but conservatives." 
</P>
<P>
At Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., the student government cut off funds 
last semester to the Spectator for its ridiculing of a black student who 
allegedly made anti-Semitic remarks. At the University of Virginia, the 
conservative magazine recently won a fight to retain its grant from the student 
council over charges that the monthly is too political. Elsewhere, bundles of 
the conservative papers are sometimes dumped into trash bins and shouts of 
"fascist" sometimes tail their writers. 
</P>
<P>
The Dartmouth Review, a 9-year-old weekly, is fighting the college over the 
suspension of two student editors for their alleged harassment of a black 
professor. Adding to the dispute were an article and cartoon last semester 
likening Dartmouth's president, who is Jewish, to Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the other conservative papers are milder and some even criticize the 
Dartmouth Review's abrasive tactics as needlessly offensive. But as proud 
children of the Reagan era, most of the editors take on provocative issues, 
attacking ethnic studies, affirmative action in college admissions, school 
funding for gay groups and any changes in curricula viewed as moving away from 
classic texts of Western culture. 
</P>
<P>
"If people ignore us, or just disagree with us, that will be fine," said 
Phaedra Fisher, a senior from Michigan who is editor in chief of the new UC 
Berkeley monthly. "As long as they let us state our piece." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IEA Aid Expanded 
</P>
<P>
The IEA cites the importance of making such views known as reason for its aid, 
which began on a small scale in 1980 and was greatly expanded in 1987. Through 
the group's Collegiate Network, campus papers received a total of about 
$100,000 in grants last year, plus about $30,000 in shared advertising from 
companies known for supporting conservative causes. The network now holds 
seminars about newspaper production, offers editorial cartoons and columns and 
has a toll-free hot line for advice. 
</P>
<P>
Alarmed liberal activists began a counter program two years ago. The Center for 
National Policy, a Washington think tank chaired by former Secretary of State 
Edmund Muskie, helps about 20 liberal and progressive publications at campuses 
such as Harvard, Columbia and the University of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"The conservatives are so very well funded, it was becoming a one-sided 
debate," said Amy Weiss, who coordinates the liberal aid to college papers. 
Last year, that aid totaled about $10,000 -- a tenth of the IEA donations. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Rolnicki, executive director of the Associated Collegiate Press, a 
nonpolitical organization that monitors student newspapers and runs contests 
for them, said he too is troubled by the amount of conservative donations. "It 
gives those papers an unfair advantage. But on the other hand, many of the 
other campus papers are strongly supported by the institutions and are 
perceived as liberal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some college administrators and liberals were further alarmed when Simon, in an 
article published last summer in the Wall Street Journal, called on alumni to 
give money to conservative student papers instead of to their colleges. There 
is no clear evidence that Simon's advice had any effect on the schools' fund 
raising, but it certainly gave the publications a boost. 
</P>
<P>
At Dartmouth, the Review has garnered so much financial support from alumni and 
prominent conservatives, including author William F. Buckley Jr., that it 
doesn't need money from IEA anymore, though the paper is active in the network. 
"You don't have to read between the lines to see where they are getting their 
money and their ideas -- from right-wing organizations," said Alex Huppe, a 
spokesman for Dartmouth President James Freedman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Support From Institute 
</P>
<P>
Lenkowsky, who is a former U.S. Information Agency official, and conservative 
student journalists insist that IEA does not dictate editorial contents. In 
most cases, the network's funds constitute less than half of the journals' 
budgets, they stress. 
</P>
<P>
The only daily paper in the conservative network, the Badger Herald at the 
University of Wisconsin, even endorsed Democrat Michael S. Dukakis in last 
year's presidential election as more likely to trim the national deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people on campus were impressed we weren't just little Republican 
robots," said Editor John Zipperer. His paper, he said, gets a few hundred 
dollars a year in advertising from the network and, unlike many of the other 
conservative papers, tries to restrict opinion to the editorial pages. 
</P>
<P>
"We are doing this because we want to do it, not because conservative adults 
are compelling us to be conservatives," explained Rob Kelner of the 2-year-old 
Princeton Sentinel, a biweekly. "They are helping to provide the means to help 
us produce a newspaper. I don't see anything wrong with that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Competition of Ideas 
</P>
<P>
At Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., where there is a network paper, 
journalism professor George Harmon said he sees the spread of conservative 
publications as healthy. "I think the competition is good on the campus," 
explained Harmon, chairman of the nonprofit corporation that runs the 
mainstream daily. He predicted that more alternative papers of all stripes will 
start up throughout the country as computer technology lowers the costs of 
production. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth C. Green, associate director of UCLA's Higher Education Research 
Institute, which surveys student attitudes nationally, said the conservative 
publications are "a very interesting phenomenon and reflective of national 
politics." 
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the biggest shift in students' self-described political views 
over the last 20 years has been from liberal to middle of the road, not to 
conservative. But conservatives are clearly "making a concerted effort to be 
much more vocal, much more influential," he said, and there is evidence that 
professors are more liberal than their students now. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the journals show up at surprising places. At UC Santa Cruz, regarded 
by some as a hippie holdout, the Redwood Review considers itself "the only 
alternative voice in entire Santa Cruz County" and closely covers municipal 
elections, Editor-in-Chief Allison Turner said. The conservative Review prints 
ads for Army officer training programs, which are banned by the regular campus 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
According to UC Santa Cruz student body President Kyle Arndt, the Review 
"reflects an increasing diversity on the campus as the kind of students 
attracted to Santa Cruz may change. That's not to say we are going to support 
Reagan 95.5% in an election, but you really get the feeling the place has 
changed. There is a diversity of opinion and that is real interesting." 
</P>
<P>
A reading of several issues of 20 of the network papers shows a range in tone 
from moderate Republicanism to pure libertarianism, sometimes in the same 
issue. Some come out regularly; some when study schedules and monies permit. 
Some are slick, well-written journals; some are the haphazard products of 
undergraduate enthusiasm and dormitory word processors. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the publications carry articles supporting the Contras in Nicaragua and 
advertisements asking for donations to the Oliver North Defense Fund. William 
J. Bennett, former U.S. secretary of education and now the anti-drug czar, is 
clearly a hero to the conservative student editors. So is Allan Bloom, whose 
best-selling book, "The Closing of the American Mind," criticized colleges for 
abandoning classics and traditional values. 
</P>
<P>
Other role models are R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr., editor in chief of the American 
Spectator, and Buckley, editor in chief of National Review. Thus, many of the 
campus papers are called Review or Spectator and resemble one of those two 
conservative publications; the young writers aspire to jobs there. 
</P>
<P>
Yet their main focus now is on campus and local issues. 
</P>
<P>
The Stanford Review, for example, helped sponsor a campus visit last year by 
Bennett, who sharply attacked Stanford's faculty for changing the required 
freshman course on Western culture so it reflected achievements of minorities 
and women. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Variety of Issues 
</P>
<P>
The new UC Berkeley paper supported the university's controversial plan to 
build dormitories at Peoples Park, a landmark of radical protests. The UC San 
Diego journal, also called the California Review, ridiculed the modernist 
architecture on campus. The Cornell Review passionately defended fraternities. 
The Northwestern Review devoted much of a recent issue to arts in the Chicago 
area. 
</P>
<P>
In its March issue, the Princeton Tory, one of two conservative publications at 
Princeton, examined 1960s radicalism. "It's one thing to like the music and 
clothing of a generation. . . . It's quite another to adopt a generation's 
ideals and tactics, especially when those ideals and tactics have proven empty 
and ineffective," wrote Tory Editor Kim Redlinger. 
</P>
<P>
A few, following Dartmouth's Review, have sharply criticized individual 
teachers' methods and ideology. But according to Anne Francke, an official of 
the American Assn. of University Professors, the conservative publications as a 
whole "haven't caused a ruckus in the faculty world." 
</P>
<P>
At Occidental College, a conservative quarterly called the Right Side was 
founded last year and, in an attempt to attract more writers and readers, the 
name was changed last semester to the Free Thinker. The paper has applied for 
an IEA grant and, meanwhile, has received and printed some network advertising, 
including Coors beer spreads. 
</P>
<P>
However, Occidental forbids advertisements for alcoholic beverages in any 
campus publication and school officials say the Free Thinker could face trouble 
if the beer advertisements appear again. Andrew Bywaters, the student editor of 
the Free Thinker, said he is going to fight that policy. 
</P>
<P>
"They say there are no ideological reasons behind that rule. I tend to doubt 
that," said Bywaters, a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heated Disputes 
</P>
<P>
At a few other colleges, disputes involving conservative papers have been more 
bitter. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1988, the Northwestern Review printed an editorial against 
celebrating the birthday of assassinated civil rights leader Martin Luther King 
Jr. According to the editorial, King's legacy brought "immense harm to American 
society, especially blacks, for it has left the U.S. more racially polarized 
than in 1950." The editorial triggered angry letters and a protest rally. 
</P>
<P>
The Student Press Law Center in Washington, a nonpartisan organization that 
works on First Amendment court cases, says conservative papers, especially 
those at Vassar and Dartmouth, have faced censorship. "Fighting racism is being 
used as a motivation for censoring college newspapers," said Mark Goodman, 
center executive director. "We certainly appreciate the serious problem racism 
poses. We feel censorship is not the proper response to that." 
</P>
<P>
And alumni, usually oblivious of many undergraduate concerns and journalism, 
have been drawn into and divided over the situations at Vassar and Dartmouth. 
</P>
<P>
The Vassar Spectator used to get a campus office and about $10,000 a year from 
the student government but lost that last fall after refusing to kill a 
controversial issue. That issue carried a feature called "Hypocrite of the 
Month," which sarcastically lambasted a black student who had made obscene and 
anti-Semitic comments to a Spectator writer at a reception for the journal, 
although the black student later privately apologized to college officials. The 
black student's face was shown in a mug shot that reminded some readers of a 
criminal wanted poster. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Harassment Seen 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed to some that the Spectator was harassing him as if he was a 
criminal," said Dixie Sheridan, the college's vice president for college 
relations. Student leaders said the item was libelous. 
</P>
<P>
Editor-in-Chief Thiessen said the Spectator, which had been a monthly, was not 
able to put out another issue until December. But now, he said, the paper is 
back on track, with the help of a $3,000 IEA grant and alumni donations. 
</P>
<P>
The Dartmouth Review has had a reputation for offending people since its brutal 
parody of black ghetto English caused an uproar in 1982. The current imbroglio 
began in February, 1988, when the paper printed what it said was a transcript 
of a secretly taped lecture of music professor William Cole, whom the Review 
had criticized in the past. In that article, Cole, who is black, was quoted as 
using obscene, rambling language and calling whites "honkies." Soon afterward, 
four Review staffers came to Cole's classroom in what they said was an attempt 
to interview Cole. The classroom visit became an ugly confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
The college suspended two of the students from school for 18 months and gave 
the other two lesser punishments. Big name conservatives rushed to the 
students' help. In January, a New Hampshire judge ordered the two most severely 
disciplined students reinstated until the matter can go to a full trial. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Censorship Denied 
</P>
<P>
Huppe, the campus spokesman, said Dartmouth is not trying to censor the Review. 
"The problem Dartmouth had with the students at the Review is their anti-social 
behavior and vitriolic ad hominem attacks on members of our community," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Most editors at other conservative college papers defend the Dartmouth Review's 
right to print whatever it pleases. But some worry that the Collegiate Network 
might be hurt by the furor. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Lidicker, managing editor of the Texas Review at the University of Texas 
in Austin, said the Dartmouth Review is sometimes "needlessly inflammatory and 
not thought out." And, in what might be considered the ultimate put-down among 
conservative collegians, he accused the Dartmouth paper of "using tactics of 
the left."

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tall metal towers look like giant legs striding across seemingly endless 
deserts, tramping up and over lofty mountains, marching through towns and 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
And, if you look closely, sometimes you see in the distance tiny dots climbing 
or clinging to the glistening soaring steel, like spiders on enormous webs in 
the sky. 
</P>
<P>
The animate specks are the linemen who erect, maintain and repair the 100- to 
250-foot-high electrical transmission towers. 
</P>
<P>
These high-wire acrobats of the utility world stroll nonchalantly across iron 
beams 100, 200, 250 feet in midair, hang sideways and upside down from their 
precarious perches securing huge bolts with giant wrenches. 
</P>
<P>
By the time they're in their early 40s, most of these men are ready to climb 
off the towers to find less strenuous work on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good money. Sure it's always a risk. The idea is not to get careless, not 
to get electrocuted, not to fall," explained veteran towerman Richard 
Dominguez, 40, who says he will keep doing this job as long as he can. 
</P>
<P>
He had scrambled down in no time from the peak of the 150-foot tower under 
construction in the desert near Laughlin. It was lunchtime, and he was hungry. 
</P>
<P>
It was high noon on a 100-degree-plus day. Dominguez gulped a cold soft drink, 
wiped the sweat from his leathery face and continued talking about the job he 
swears he would not trade for any other. 
</P>
<P>
"It's exciting to be in the air. You always have the feeling you are doing 
something not everyone can do. When the power goes out anywhere on the 
conductor lines on Southern California Edison Co. transmission towers, we're 
the guys who get it back on as fast as we can." 
</P>
<P>
Edison has 24,000 huge transmission towers carrying 69,000 to 500,000-volt 
electrical conductor lines along a 12,000-mile path from Hoover Dam, from the 
Palo Verdes nuclear plant near Phoenix, from generating plants, from dams on 
both the eastern and western slopes of the High Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
The towers carry power for 10 million people in 14 Central and Southern 
California counties, for homes and apartments, schools and stores, factories 
and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
The 185 linemen who service these towers deal with it all -- windstorms, 
snowstorms, salt storms, earthquakes, fires, floods, torrential rains, dense 
fog, subzero cold and 120- to 130-degree heat at all hours of the day and 
night. When there is an outage, they go. Another 64 brave souls do the same 
kind of work for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which provides 
electricity to 3.4 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
Now and then a lineman is killed or seriously injured in a fall or is 
electrocuted. It doesn't happen often, but the danger is always there. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Bratten, 42, shot and wounded at Tay Nihn in Vietnam with the 9th Infantry 
Division, has been an Edison Co. towerman for 23 years. "I took three shots of 
13,800 volts several years ago. It burned the wedding ring off my finger, but I 
survived and came back after a few days to recuperate," Bratten recalled. 
</P>
<P>
He told how his father advised him to apply for a job with a utility company 
"for security" after he got out of the Army. "I took the telephone, gas and 
Edison Co. test. Edison paid more. So I came here. I was asked if I was scared 
of heights. I said I didn't think so," Bratten said. 
</P>
<P>
He worked on the towers until six years ago, when he became a tower 
construction foreman, and now works only on the ground. "That's a long ways up 
when you're in your 40s. By the time most men get to be Dominguez's age they 
get jobs on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"Working in the air is a wonderful job for young men. It pays $19.68 an hour 
for a journeyman (after serving a three-year apprenticeship) with lots of 
overtime and out-of-town subsistence money. You get in your late 30s and early 
40s and you wear out. 
</P>
<P>
"It's strenuous work. The older you get the tougher it gets. Leg and back 
operations are part of the job. I've had eight operations on my legs. The 
cartilage is gone on both legs. I loved every minute on the tower and miss it a 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
There's plenty to be fearful about in this line of work -- height, wind, 
electrocution. 
</P>
<P>
"We're up there in 20- and 30-mile winds all the time," said Steve Berczik, 40. 
"Winds can blow towers over. Last year, a 100-mile wind leveled eight towers 
out by Blythe." 
</P>
<P>
Stan (A-to-Z) Alachniewicz, 34, who became a towerman five years ago after 
losing his job when the Kaiser steel plant in Fontana closed, had to conquer 
his qualms about working at great heights. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overcame Fear 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't real fond of heights," he said. "Some guys sign on and have to quit 
because they can't stand heights. But I had to get a job to support my family. 
When you need to do it, you got to overcome that fear, but it still bothers me 
and everybody else at times." 
</P>
<P>
Alex Garcia, 27, 3 1/2 years on the job, served four years in the Marines and 
knew he could hack it because he was lowered 200 feet on ropes from 
helicopters. "The first climb of the day you still get a little nervous. You 
try to be extremely careful at all times and watch what you're doing. Edison 
drills the safety factor into our heads all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Racine, 41, a foreman who worked in the air for 18 years, and was also 
wounded in the Vietnam War while in the Army, told how new men on the job spend 
six months to a year as groundmen sending material and tools to the linemen on 
towers. 
</P>
<P>
"We are as safety conscious as you can be but sometimes there are accidents and 
we do get hurt, no doubt about it. But that's understandable considering the 
heights the men work at and working around live wires with tremendous voltage. 
You hold on tight, strapped to steel with a web belt while working." 
</P>
<P>
Racine was on a tower when a fellow worker was electrocuted and helped lower 
the man's body to the ground. Dwayne Ryssman, 29, who flies gliders in his 
spare time, said wives don't want to know about the job or think about what 
their husbands do from day to day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Erecting Tower 
</P>
<P>
The 10-man crew erected the tower near Laughlin in three days to bring more 
power from the Edison generating plant here to a nearby Nevada Power Co. 
facility providing additional electricity for the fast-growing gambling resort 
community on the Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
Putting a tower together is much like constructing a giant piece from a Erector 
Set with ground crews and a huge crane hoisting steel beams to linemen on the 
tower who set them in place and bolt them together. "It takes more than a 
screwdriver and a pair of pliers to put it together," laughed Alachniewicz. 
</P>
<P>
If the towers are accessible, the linemen drive to the job, but more often the 
towers are in rugged inaccessible desert or mountainous terrain and the men 
have to be flown in by helicopter or walk from one to two miles to dense 
forested areas from lumber roads or fire breaks. 
</P>
<P>
The linemen are often away from their families from a week to a month. And 
during natural disasters or power failures, working 40 to 60 hours nonstop 
without sleep is not that uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
"There may be easier ways of making a living, but I wouldn't trade this for 
love nor money," insisted Berczik, his sentiments echoed by the other human 
spiders working in midair with web belts strapped tightly to the 150-foot tower 
nearing completion at Laughlin.

SERGIO LEONE OF 'SPAGHETTI WESTERN' FAME DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GINGER THOMPSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Director Sergio Leone, whose widely imitated films spawned the "spaghetti 
Western" genre and made Clint Eastwood an international celebrity, died of a 
heart attack Sunday in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
The critically acclaimed film maker, whose credits include "A Fistful of 
Dollars," "The Good, the Bad and The Ugly," "Once Upon a Time in the West" and 
"Once Upon a Time in America," was 60. 
</P>
<P>
Police said his family called for medical assistance shortly after 1:30 a.m., 
when Leone developed chest pains, but by the time help arrived, the heavy-set, 
white-bearded man was dead. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Carla, told Italian television the attack came as she and Leone were 
in bed watching TV. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'I feel like I'm going to faint,' and then he was dead," she said. 
"He was a person whom everyone will miss so much, because, among other things, 
he was a real genius." 
</P>
<P>
In a career that spanned four decades, Leone is best known for the series of 
Westerns he made in Spain, Italy and eventually the United States in the 1960s. 
These films typically featured cold-hearted, gunslinging loners who dueled on 
sparse and sun-scorched landscapes to the accompaniment of a grandiose score, 
usually by composer Ennio Morricone. 
</P>
<P>
Those films, which became known as "spaghetti Westerns," included: "A Fistful 
of Dollars," produced in 1964; "For a Few Dollars More," produced in 1965, and 
"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly," made in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Leone shot "A Fistful of Dollars" under the pseudonym Bob Robertson, believing 
it would be better received as an all-American product. But he used his real 
name in later films, and won a cult following in this country because of his 
careful attention to historical detail and infusion of realism. 
</P>
<P>
He also attracted solid casts -- led by Eastwood, the young star of American 
television's "Rawhide," who was catapulted to worldwide fame by the leading 
roles. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Fonda, the ultimate "good guy" icon, was successfully cast as a villain 
in "Once Upon a Time in the West," in which he guns down a child in cold blood 
and rapes the heroine (Claudia Cardinale). 
</P>
<P>
The 1969 film -- which also starred Charles Bronson, Jason Robards and a host 
of famous character actors -- with its impeccable photography and epic score 
(again by Morricone), is considered one of Leone's masterpieces, 
</P>
<P>
Times' critic Sheila Benson wrote: 
</P>
<P>
"This is the Western to the 100th power, stylized right up to and through the 
point of Kabuki." 
</P>
<P>
Leone's extensive use of Monument Valley as a location for the film was 
considered a homage to John Ford, the legendary director who favored the same 
scenic northern Arizona mesa land in his Westerns. 
</P>
<P>
That film was followed by yet another Western, "Duck, You Sucker" in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Directions in Italian 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the Italian film maker who earned acclaim for his films on life in 
America, hardly spoke English and gave most of his directions through an 
interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
But he insisted, "I know more about the West than most Americans. I feel more 
qualified to make a good Western than most American directors." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Rome in 1929, Leone, the son of director Vincenzo Leone, entered the 
industry at the age of 16 as an assistant to Italian director Vittorio De Sica 
on the classic 1946 film, "The Bicycle Thief." 
</P>
<P>
Over the next 20 years he worked on 58 productions, assisting such directors as 
Fred Zinnemann, William Wyler and Robert Wise on films such as "The Nun's 
Story," "Ben Hur" and "Helen of Troy." 
</P>
<P>
He first directed a film in 1961 with "The Colossus of Rhodes," one of a series 
of popular mythological films made in Rome at the time. The film won the young 
director a wide following and a flood of offers to direct similar features. 
</P>
<P>
However, Leone's imagination was captured by the American Westerns he saw as a 
child, so he raised $250,000 and went to Spain to shoot "A Fistful of Dollars," 
despite the prevailing opinion that the genre was in decline. 
</P>
<P>
"The universal attraction of the Western is that it is a great fable, a myth 
like Achilles," Leone told an interviewer in 1968. "For me personally, the 
attraction is the joy of making justice . . . without asking permission -- 
bang, bang." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Dream Project 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, after 15 years of negotiations for funding, he finished a dream 
project about Jewish gangsters -- "Once Upon a Time in America." 
</P>
<P>
The 3 1/2-half hour film, which starred Robert De Niro, James Woods and Tuesday 
Weld, won plaudits at the Cannes film festival and was a hit in France and 
Italy. But it was drastically cut for U.S. release and got lukewarm reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Leone said he made the film about Jewish gangsters because there were already 
too many films about Italian gangsters, including "The Godfather" and "The 
Godfather II." 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been fascinated by evil," the director said in a 1982 interview 
with The Times, "because underneath you find that bad is sometimes better in a 
certain way than good. I want to show the romantic side of evil in an ambience 
that is not at all romantic. It's very difficult to do, but I try not to 
romanticize too much. I am cynical enough not to romanticize too much." 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his death, Leone was planning to direct a major film about the 
siege of Leningrad by German troops in World War II. An aide said Leone worked 
all day Saturday and was to have flown to the United States today to sign a 
production deal. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his wife, the film maker, who made his home in both Italy and 
France, is survived by his children, Raffaela, Francesca and Andrea.

AMERICAN ALBUM: A DECADE AFTER THE HOME BREWING OF BEER BECAME LEGAL, THOUSANDS 
ARE BELLYING UP TO A NEW HOBBY.

In an act akin to heresy, Rande Reed, who lives in this town that beer made 
famous and who works in a Milwaukee brewery, has his own brew of choice. It's 
still Milwaukee beer -- it's just that it's made next to the washing machine in 
Reed's basement. 
</P>
<P>
Reed is far from alone. "After you've had a home brew, commercial American 
beers taste like water," says Mary Uthemann, owner of a brewing supply shop in 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that homemade suds-making has taken hold here is testimony to a 
growing national craze. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hobbyists Show Zeal 
</P>
<P>
A decade after Congress and former President Jimmy Carter -- responding to 
bottled up demand -- made home brewing of beer legal, Americans are bellying up 
to the idea by the thousands. They are turning out six-packs with the zeal 
others devote to canning vegetables or putting up jams. Beer-making has 
replaced wine-making as the dominant hobby fermentation activity in the United 
States, according to sellers of both wine- and beer-making equipment and 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
More than a million people -- most of them men -- try their hand at beer-making 
every year. Half of them will make more than one batch, says Charlie Papazian, 
president of the Denver-based American Homebrewers Assn., whose membership has 
grown 20% in each of the last two years. Annual sales of home-brewing supplies 
from 1,500 shops and mail-order businesses approach $50 million, says Papazian. 
</P>
<P>
At the Wisconsin State Fair, one of the few fairs in the nation with beer 
judging, home brew entries have expanded from 30 in 1985 to 121 last year, 
reports Jerry Uthemann, who oversees the competition. 
</P>
<P>
The growing interest is attributed to a variety of factors, including the 
change in the law that permits individuals to make up to 100 gallons of beer a 
year and two-adult households to bottle up to 200 gallons. The law brought 
beer-making -- long practiced illegally -- out of the closet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Became Fanatic' 
</P>
<P>
"Once I tasted traditional English beer -- ale -- I was hooked," says Reed, a 
former metal fabricator. "When I found the few imports that were available 
didn't compare to what I remembered from my travel, I decided if you can brew 
wine at home, why not beer? I became fanatic about it." 
</P>
<P>
Reed, 36, a thin man who drinks two beers a day, typifies the serious home 
brewer. He has converted the basement of his Milwaukee bungalow into a home 
brewery. He makes his favorite beers -- English-type ales -- from scratch with 
a practice called whole-grain brewing. Reed grinds barley and uses dried hops 
instead of prepared ingredients that come in a variety of popular kits. 
</P>
<P>
"Brewing from (a kit) is the equivalent of making a cake from a box," says 
Reed. "It's short, it's quick, it's easy and it produced fairly good results. 
It doesn't take a lot of time and it doesn't require a lot of expensive 
equipment." 
</P>
<P>
Because he is so meticulous, Reed's brewing day lasts about eight hours, well 
over twice as long as brewing with kits. And like other home brewers, Reed has 
turned his hobby into a profession. He gave up metalworking and became an 
assistant brewer at Milwaukee's tiny Sprecher Brewing Co., a microbrewery that 
specializes in traditional European-style beers. 
</P>
<P>
For the hobby brewer using a kit, the initial processes take at least two 
hours. Fermentation can take about a week and aging takes 10 days or more 
before the beer is ready to drink. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calls Brewing Rewarding 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't easier than collecting stamps but work is relative," says Papazian. 
"How much time do people spend fixing their cars or mowing their lawns? And 
brewing is a lot more enjoyable, a lot more rewarding." 
</P>
<P>
Home brewing doesn't require a stout investment. The hobby brewer can start 
with a $65 to $70 investment in equipment and can make a batch of beer for as 
little as $10 for nine six-packs. A high quality beer might run $20 or $25 for 
ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
There are an estimated 150 home brew clubs whose names tell much about home 
brewing. They range from the effervescent to some that are, well, just serious 
and flat. Included are: Clan de Stein, the Maltose Falcons, the Sonoma 
Beerocrats, the Foam Rangers, the Bock 'n' Ale-ians and the Amateur Brewers of 
Central New York. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Blochwitz, 28, a Madison, Wis., pastry chef and one of only two women in 
her home brewing club, says that "people think of a darker, heavier beer as 
something men are supposed to like better. And a lot of women prefer wine. I'm 
baffled by that." 
</P>
<P>
"Home brewers are very individualistic," says Dave Norton, a Kenosha, Wis., 
firefighter, beer maker and owner of Nort's Worts, a brewing supply store. 
"Brewing takes over their life. It's more important than drinking. They give a 
lot of beer away. 
</P>
<P>
"It is therapy for me," says Norton. "It's creative. When I felt bad I used to 
cook up a batch of chili. Now, I brew beer." 
</P>
<P>
Researcher Tracy Shryer contributed to this story.

<P>
A man dressed all in black and armed with a shotgun went on a 15-minute 
shooting spree Sunday in a northeastern coastal town, killing one man and 
wounding 14 people before being arrested, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Police were questioning the man to determine the motive for his rampage in 
Monkseaton, about a mile from the Whitley Bay seaside resort and 250 miles 
northeast of London. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman, who was not identified, roamed the streets shooting at anyone he 
saw, including one person in a car, another on a bicycle, one in a garden and 
one outside a church, said a spokesman for a local ambulance service. 
</P>
<P>
"There must have been about 12 different locations given where this man had 
gone round," said Ken Heads, superintendent of the Northumbria ambulance 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the gunman was dressed all in black, with dark sunglasses and 
his hair in a pony tail. They said he wore an ammunition belt around his waist 
and prowled the streets for 15 minutes, pausing only to shoot. 
</P>
<P>
After the shooting spree, he drove to a pub, where authorities seized him 
without any gunfire, police said.

19TH-CENTURY SAVIOR OF MADAGASCAR'S CATHOLICS BEATIFIED BY VISITING POPE

<P>
Pope John Paul II on Sunday beatified a 19th-Century woman who protected the 
Roman Catholic Church from persecution, lauding her as a model for women and 
lay people. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope, on the third day of his visit to this African island nation, 
beatified Victoire Rasoamanarivo in a three-hour service before a crowd 
estimated by local organizers at 500,000 -- about half the capital's 
population. 
</P>
<P>
Beatification is the first step toward possible sainthood. 
</P>
<P>
Rasoamanarivo, who died in 1894 at 46, is considered the savior of the Catholic 
Church in this nation of 11 million people, 22% of whom are Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
The granddaughter of a prime minister, she converted to the faith at 13, to the 
consternation of her pagan parents. 
</P>
<P>
When Catholic missionaries were expelled from Madagascar in 1883, she fought to 
keep Catholic schools open, traveled the countryside to encourage the faithful 
and appealed to the royal family to respect religious rights. 
</P>
<P>
When missionaries were allowed to return in 1886, they found the church still 
thriving. 
</P>
<P>
"Those few years of service left a reminder that is still very much alive," 
said the pontiff, speaking in French. "She is a model for the lay faithful 
today." 
</P>
<P>
The Pope cited her work with the poor, the sick and prisoners and held her up 
as an example for women in the church. 
</P>
<P>
He also hailed the "courageous fidelity Victoire showed the sacrament of 
marriage despite the problems of her marriage." 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Radriaka, son of the prime minister, was a notorious drinker and 
womanizer. But before dying, after falling off a balcony in the 18th year of 
their marriage, he accepted his wife's plea to be baptized, church officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope, on his fifth tour of Africa, leaves today for the French island of 
Reunion, then visits Zambia and Malawi.

SIHANOUK EASES STAND ON TALKS TO SETTLE CAMBODIAN CONFLICT

Cambodian resistance leader Norodom Sihanouk said Sunday that he has dropped 
his demands for U.N. supervision of a Vietnamese troop withdrawal and the 
dissolution of Premier Hun Sen's regime as preconditions for talks to settle 
the 11-year-old conflict. 
</P>
<P>
"I am ready to soften my stance," Prince Sihanouk, 67, said upon arrival from 
Bangkok, Thailand, for talks starting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to be realistic," he said. "I have to make possible an agreement" with 
Hun Sen, the head of the Hanoi-backed Phnom Penh regime. 
</P>
<P>
However, Sihanouk ruled out a deal without consultations with his resistance 
partners, including the Khmer Rouge. "I am not going to sign an agreement with 
Hun Sen" without the approval of the heads of the two other factions, former 
Premier Son Sann and Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan. 
</P>
<P>
Although three previous meetings with Hun Sen in France failed to make any 
progress, an unusually conciliatory Sihanouk said, "Both of us may soften our 
stands to find a solution." 
</P>
<P>
Since Vietnam announced in April the unconditional withdrawal of its troops by 
September, hopes have run high that the talks between Sihanouk and Hun Sen will 
result in a breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving only five hours before U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle, the prince who 
ruled Cambodia for nearly 30 years said he was looking forward to their meeting 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not ask for it," Sihanouk said, adding that Quayle requested a "courtesy 
call." 
</P>
<P>
Quayle is expected to discuss the possibility of the United States granting 
military aid to the non-communist resistance groups.

West Germany is having its most serious rift with its major allies, the United 
States and Britain, since the Federal Republic was founded 40 years ago. Here 
are questions and answers about the quarrel: 
</P>
<P>
 Question: How serious is the argument? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Very. It threatens the trust and cohesion which underpin the Atlantic 
Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What is the core of the dispute? 
</P>
<P>
A: It's about short-range nuclear missile forces, those with a range of under 
300 miles, known as SNF, based in West Germany. Bonn wants the missiles to be 
part of "early" talks with Moscow aimed at reducing such forces. 
</P>
<P>
Q: But weren't the United States and the Soviets negotiating a 50% cut in 
strategic missiles, and didn't talks lead to banning intermediate-range 
missiles (INF) in the 1987 treaty? 
</P>
<P>
A: True. But the Americans and the British are afraid of taking NATO's 
short-range missiles out of West Germany because, they argue, the missiles are 
a key element of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's "flexible response" 
deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
Also, strategists say they provide a deterrent umbrella for the 250,000-strong 
U.S. forces in Germany. If Bonn gets rid of the nuclear deterrent, Congress may 
pull U.S. forces out. "No nukes," they argue, "no troops." And withdrawal of 
U.S. troops could mean the end of NATO. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Have the Germans any supporters in the argument over early missile talks? 
</P>
<P>
A: Definitely. They are backed by Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Greece, Spain, 
Portugal and probably Italy. On the other side, the Dutch, French, Turks and 
possibly the Canadians support the Anglo-American position. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Does Kohl want all short-range missiles out of his country? 
</P>
<P>
A: He says no, but the Americans and British fear Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev might make an offer Bonn couldn't refuse -- namely pulling all 
nuclear weapons out of Europe. The Americans and British want to put off any 
talks on short-range forces until progress is made in the new conventional arms 
negotiations in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Americans, and particularly Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, are 
still mistrustful and angry at Kohl and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher 
for their about-face on missile "modernization." Washington and London expected 
the West German government to commit Bonn to deploying a modernized version of 
the aging, short-range Lance missile. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why? 
</P>
<P>
A: Because ministers at previous NATO meetings decided that the Lance will be 
obsolete around 1995 and that a credible replacement is needed. The idea was 
that the U.S. Congress would fund a replacement if assurances were made by Bonn 
that the new missiles would be deployed. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Didn't the West Germans go along with that NATO decision? 
</P>
<P>
A: They did, but they recently changed their minds. Opinion polls show that 
missile modernization is highly unpopular among German voters, and for the 
chancellor to go along with the modernization could keep him from remaining in 
office after the December, 1990, federal parliamentary elections. 
</P>
<P>
In the Anglo-American view, Kohl has acted as a provincial politician in making 
his turnabout, rather than as a statesman who would stick by the NATO decision. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why are these short range-missiles suddenly so unpopular after being 
stationed here for 40 years? 
</P>
<P>
A: Because of Gorbachev. His statements on reducing nuclear weapons in Europe 
and his calls for easing of tensions hold much attraction for West Germans. 
They believe he is serious about detente and new East-West relations. As a 
result, many Germans want to rid their country of all nuclear weapons, 
especially short-range missiles that would be able to hit targets only in West 
Germany and East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Q: But does that mean the West Germans want to get out of NATO? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. All public opinion polls show the majority of Germans want to stay in. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Thatcher's personal stand is clear. What about that of President Bush? 
</P>
<P>
A: European leaders aren't sure. Even U.S. diplomats talk about the "black 
hole" in Washington -- in terms of guiding foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do the Germans feel that Washington and London are ganging up on them? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. They remember the reported words of Lord Ismay, first secretary general 
of NATO, that the alliance was created to keep the Americans in, the Soviets 
out and the Germans down. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is there any truth in this? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. In British ruling circles, you hear sentiments that the Germans lost 
the war and should do as they are told. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Besides support among European allies for Bonn's view on the short-range 
missiles, are they sympathetic to West Germany in other ways? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. Many Europeans believe that after 40 years of being considered an 
economic giant and political dwarf, West Germany is coming of age. It wants a 
stronger voice in the alliance, since the country is on the East-West fracture 
line. Many Europeans approve of West German overtures to the East Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What do the Germans think about the Anglo-American pressure on them? 
</P>
<P>
A: Many think that while Kohl's turnaround is a sorry development, the 
Americans and British overplayed their hands by pushing him into a corner. 
This, they say, serves no positive end, since the political opposition here 
favors a ban on all nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Q: So the argument isn't simply black and white. 
</P>
<P>
A: Not at all. There are reasonable arguments that the modernization issue 
could have been left on a back burner until after West Germany's 1990 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Will NATO patch up the quarrel by the May 29-30 summit? 
</P>
<P>
A: More likely they'll paper it over. Language will be written into the final 
communique that, while not making anyone happy, will keep the breach from 
widening.

AF SEEKING $1.2 BILLION TO FIX TROUBLED B-1B BOMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Air Force has proposed to spend $1.2 billion to repair and improve the 
troubled B-1B bomber over the next five years but has acknowledged that none of 
the $250-million planes may ever work as promised, congressional sources said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
One key lawmaker has balked at the cost of the fixes, most of which would be 
paid for by funds already approved by Congress more than four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, told 
members of the panel that the B-1B's inability to penetrate Soviet airspace as 
advertised at the outset of the program may force Congress to redefine the 
plane's mission. 
</P>
<P>
"Is this the time, then, to make the fundamental decisions about the role of 
the B-1B?" Aspin asked in a memorandum circulating Sunday among committee 
members. "Should funds be spent on it to maintain its role as a penetrating 
bomber, or should it be used in a standoff role?" Aspin said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Delivery of Missiles 
</P>
<P>
In a standoff role, the aircraft would be used as a delivery platform for 
cruise missiles, which would be fired at targets within the Soviet Union from 
outside Soviet airspace. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force has informed Congress that it will use $725 million in 
appropriated but unspent Pentagon funds to correct problems with the plane's 
electronic jamming system -- almost $200 million more than anticipated just two 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the service has proposed a $489-million "improvement program" in 
which new radar warning receivers would be installed in the nation's 97 B-1Bs 
over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
A radar warning receiver would alert B-1B flight crews to potential attackers 
on the ground below or in the air ahead. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force has argued that neither proposal would breach a $25-billion cost 
limit that former President Ronald Reagan had imposed and Congress had approved 
for the program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Technically Correct 
</P>
<P>
By using $725 million in funds already appropriated and by defining the 
$489-million radar warning receivers as an "improvement" rather than as a 
repair, the Air Force is technically correct. But, Aspin said, if the proposed 
fixes are accurately characterized as addressing shortcomings in the Air Force 
program, they would amount to a breach of the cost limit. 
</P>
<P>
Aspin and others have noted that decisions about repairs to the plane -- as 
well as about the uses to which it would be put in a nuclear war -- must be 
made now. If they are not, the B-1B may not be able ever to minimally perform 
its mission after 1994, Aspin said. The plane's performance in 1994 has become 
more crucial since the Air Force began encountering technical difficulties in 
developing the successor to the B-1B, the stealth B-2 bomber, which is 
scheduled to be in service shortly after 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Those difficulties became evident to Aspin's committee from a recent Air Force 
request to shift $297 million from B-2 production funds back into research and 
development of the craft. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force has delayed the stealth bomber's first flight, citing an 
accumulation of software problems. Gen. Larry D. Welch, the Air Force chief of 
staff, however, defended the program Saturday, predicting that the first flight 
of the B-2 would take place within 60 days.

U.S. BLOCKS COSTA RICA'S SHOT AT A TIE; 
</P>
<P>
PENALTY KICK STOPPED BY VANOLE AS AMERICANS GET 1-0 VICTORY IN SOCCER

<P>
Normally, when an offensive player goes man-to-man against the goalkeeper on a 
penalty kick, the attacker has the advantage. After all, he knows the move he 
is going to make, and the goalkeeper does not. 
</P>
<P>
But there was little that was normal about Sunday's World Cup qualifying match 
between the United States and Costa Rica, except for the outcome. The home team 
won in a low-scoring game, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. victory was preserved when its goalkeeper, David (Dino) Vanole of 
Manhattan Beach, used his intuition, as well as his 6-foot-5, 235-pound body, 
to stop a penalty kick by Costa Rica's Roger Flores that would have tied the 
score, spoiled a noteworthy defensive effort and seriously damaged the United 
States' chances of advancing to the 1990 World Cup at Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Vanole's save seemed even more dramatic than it actually was because there was 
no time remaining on the scoreboard clock at the suburban St. Louis Soccer 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
With the ball tucked safely under his arm, he began celebrating, as did many of 
the 8,500 fans who filled the quaint stadium to capacity, only to discover that 
there were still about two minutes remaining on the official clock that is kept 
on the field. Fortunately for Vanole and his teammates, the final moments were 
anti-climactic. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to work on my composure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Vanole, who did not learn until Sunday morning that he would start, 
appeared quite composed as he waited for the penalty kick. From studying the 
scouting reports, he said he knew Flores was a power player who probably would 
not try to finesse a goal by shooting for a corner. 
</P>
<P>
"It was obvious he was going to try to hammer it down the middle," Vanole said. 
</P>
<P>
After he figured that out, all he had to do was wait. Flores did not disappoint 
him, aiming the ball about three feet to Vanole's right and blasting it with 
his right foot. Stopping the ball from entering the net was as easy for Vanole 
as falling down. 
</P>
<P>
Flores was flustered afterward, grumbling that Vanole distracted him by moving 
before the shot. If so, and the referee had called it, Costa Rica would have 
been awarded another kick. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the Costa Ricans' complaints were about calls that were made, 
including one late in the second half that led to the penalty kick. With Vanole 
badly out of position, one of his few mistakes, defender Steve Trittschuh of 
Granite City, Ill. covered for him in goal, barely getting his hands up in time 
to stop a shot by Costa Rica's Alvaro Solano. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the only thing I could do," Trittschuh said. "I had to make them earn 
it, so I just stopped it any way I could." 
</P>
<P>
It was a game-saving play, albeit illegal. A goalkeeper can use his hands for a 
save, but the other players cannot. Costa Rica was awarded a penalty kick. But 
the Costa Ricans believed they deserved more. They said that they should have 
been awarded a goal because Trittschuh was standing in the goal mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Trittschuh was not entirely persuasive when he said, "I was way out in front of 
the line." 
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica also had two goals disallowed, one because of an off-sides penalty 
in the first half and one in the second half because the referee ruled that the 
player who scored hit the ball with his hand. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Ricans did not agree with either call, letting the referee know it 
when they surrounded him at the end of the game. No one seemed to intend him 
any harm, but his ears must have been burning as security guards escorted him 
to the dressing room. 
</P>
<P>
But as the referee, A. Rodolfo Mejia Martinez, is from Honduras, the Costa 
Ricans could not very well contend that they had been victimized by hometown 
officiating. 
</P>
<P>
"He made mistakes, that's all," said Dr. Longino Soto, president of the Costa 
Rican soccer federation. 
</P>
<P>
A fair result, Soto said, would have been a 1-1 tie. 
</P>
<P>
A tie would have satisfied Costa Rica, which beat the United States, 1-0, at 
home two weeks ago. In a qualifying round that has five teams (Guatemala, El 
Salvador and Trinidad and Tobago are the others) of almost equal ability, the 
goal is to win all the home games and at least tie one or two on the road. 
Teams earn two points for a victory and one for a tie. 
</P>
<P>
Through four games, Costa Rica has four points but still has not scored any 
away from home. With two points after two games, the United States has another 
home date May 13 at Torrance against Trinidad and Tobago. The two teams with 
the most points after eight games earn World Cup berths, something the United 
States has not done since 1950. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing to play for a scoreless tie, Costa Rica's defensive strategy Sunday 
worked for about 72 minutes. But then midfielder Tab Ramos from Hillside, N.J. 
took a shot from 18 yards out that deflected off a defender and got past 
goalkeeper Luis Gabelo Conejo. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a feeling we haven't had here in a while," Ramos said. 
</P>
<P>
To be exact, it had been 260 minutes since the U.S. national team had scored a 
goal, having been shut out in the last game of the Marlboro Cup before going to 
Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Coach Bob Gansler called the game at Costa Rica "a little bit of a 
clinker," blaming the performance on a lack of enthusiasm. In an effort to add 
some emotion to the lineup, he benched goalkeeper Jeff Duback of Encinitas and 
started Vanole. 
</P>
<P>
"I read that we have a goalkeeper controversy," Gansler said. "We've never had 
that. We have two very talented young men who have different strengths and 
different weaknesses. (Vanole) played today because he's more emotional, more 
dynamic." 
</P>
<P>
Vanole became even more committed to the cause in the first half, when a Costa 
Rican trainer, during an injury timeout, snatched the small U.S. flag that the 
goalkeeper planted near the goalpost and snapped the stick in Vanole's face. 
</P>
<P>
"That was rude of him," Vanole said. "I was insulted that he had the guts to do 
that on our home turf. It wasn't something I took lightly." 
</P>
<P>
Much later, when he got his chance for revenge, he made the most of it.

WITT GOES A STRONG 10, ANGELS WIN IN 11TH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Witt, 6-foot-7 wallflower amid the Angels' starting pitching resurgence, 
came in from the cold long enough Sunday afternoon to finally get in on the 
action, although not quite long enough to get a winning decision. 
</P>
<P>
That distinction went to Bob McClure, the Angel reliever who shut out the 
Toronto Blue Jays for one inning -- or one-tenth as long as Witt did. 
</P>
<P>
But on this day, timing was everything and McClure was at the right place at 
the right moment. A run-scoring double by Lance Parrish in the bottom of the 
11th inning made the moment, ending 10 1/2 innings of zeroes and giving the 
Angels a 1-0 victory before 31,125 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Timing? 
</P>
<P>
Witt could've evened his record at 3-3 if only: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He had been able, or allowed, to squeeze out one more shutout inning after 
limiting the Blue Jays to five singles through 10 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Or Parrish had been able to deliver his double in the first inning, instead 
of bouncing into a home-to-first double play with the bases loaded and no outs. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, Toronto starter John Cerutti might have parlayed his 10 shutout 
innings into a victory if: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Witt hadn't snagged a sharp grounder by Rance Mulliniks in the eighth 
inning and turned it into a double play with Blue Jay Alexis Infante on third 
base and one out. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Or Toronto General Manager Pat Gillick, who hadn't made a trade in 20 
months, could have waited one more day before shipping outfielder Jesse 
Barfield to the New York Yankees for pitcher Al Leiter. Barfield is a career 
.429 hitter against Witt (12 for 28) and maybe, just maybe, might have come in 
handy on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, events developed so that Witt and Cerutti were both removed from the 
decision by the time one was rendered, the gavel finally being dropped by the 
11th-inning doubles Johnny Ray and Parrish managed against Blue Jay reliever 
Tom Henke. 
</P>
<P>
And Witt would have to satisfy himself with making an 135-pitch assist in the 
Angels' fifth consecutive victory, which completed a three-game sweep of the 
slumping Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing missing was the 'W,' " Angel Manager Doug Rader said of Witt's 
performance. "His presence on the mound, his outward aggressiveness, the effort 
he put into his pitches -- that was vintage Mike Witt. It was fantastic to 
see." 
</P>
<P>
It was a while in coming, too. While Kirk McCaskill was throwing one-hitters 
and Bert Blyleven was reeling off three consecutive complete games and Chuck 
Finley was lowering his earned-run average to 2.45, Witt, the No. 1 name in the 
Angel rotation, took the staff's highest ERA -- 5.79 -- and a 2-3 record into 
Sunday's game. In his previous start, Witt lasted only 3 1/3 innings in an 
eventual 8-1 loss to the Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
Take away Witt and the Angel team ERA, before Sunday, was an astounding 2.30. 
</P>
<P>
For the month of April, anyway, Witt had gone from ace to straggler. 
</P>
<P>
"The other guys have been picking me up," Witt said. "That's made it a lot 
easier, but I know I haven't been pitching that great." 
</P>
<P>
Witt needed 10 shutout innings against Toronto to lower his ERA to 4.43, which 
is still nearly a run higher than rookie Jim Abbott's 3.65. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Rader tried to downplay the obvious, characterizing Witt's first month of 
the 1989 season as "not that bad a start. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Jack Morris (0-5) and Frank Viola (0-4) would be glad to trade places 
with Mike. His ERA is respectable. Unfortunately for Mike, when he doesn't 
pitch like he did today, people remember the way he used to pitch. His own 
efficiency paves the way for criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"But any time you're 2-3 and people call that a bad start, that's quite a 
compliment to a guy's ability." 
</P>
<P>
And that record could have been 3-3, which made the Angels' 11th-inning victory 
after Witt's 10th-inning ouster such a tease. 
</P>
<P>
"It would've been a lot better if we'd won it in the 15th," Witt said. "To get 
it the very next inning was a little disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps sensing what lay ahead, Witt said he discussed the possibility of 
pitching one more inning with Rader after he completed the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave him my two-cents' worth," Witt said. "I gave him my opinion. I felt in 
the 10th inning like I did in the eighth." 
</P>
<P>
Rader believed him, too, but wasn't convinced that was good enough to warrant 
another inning. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd been tired for two innings and he'd worked out of some very difficult 
situations," Rader said. "It's very important to protect your starting 
pitchers, especially considering what he'd done and what he'd gone through. 
</P>
<P>
"I think 130 pitches is plenty. We can't afford to be shortsighted. He threw 
130 pitches under some stressful circumstances, and that translates to the toll 
150 pitches normally takes. That's plenty." 
</P>
<P>
So McClure came on to reap what Witt had sown. A 1-2-3 inning . . . and then 
watch from the bench as Ray and Parrish doubled off Henke (1-3) to decide the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"At last," Parrish said of his game-winning hit. "I was very happy to be able 
to make up for that first-inning double play. As the game went on, I kept 
thinking, 'If I'd hit the ball on the ground any where else.' But, no, I had to 
hit it right back at the pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
When Parrish did, followed by a fly out by Chili Davis, the Angels had wasted a 
bases-loaded, no outs situation -- and the groundwork for a 10-inning double 
shutout had been laid. 
</P>
<P>
"That's baseball," Witt said. "To say what might've happened is just 
conjecture. They could've scored on me my last two innings, too." 
</P>

Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the game, the Angels announced they were optioning second 
baseman Mark McLemore to their triple-A club in Edmonton, which prompted an 
immediate request by McLemore to be traded. "I did ask for (a trade)," McLemore 
said as he hurried to pull on a pair of sweats and leave the Angel clubhouse. 
"They knew exactly what I was going to say. I'll be back (in the major leagues) 
one day, but I don't know where." McLemore had been called up to replace Johnny 
Ray while Ray was on the disabled list, but hadn't appeared in a game since Ray 
returned to the starting lineup last Monday. In 15 games, McLemore batted .242 
with nine RBIs and four stolen bases. He also committed four errors. "Mark 
perceives himself as the man who should play second base here -- and that's a 
healthy outlook to have," Angel Manager Doug Rader said. "Unfortunately, that 
does not coincide with the feelings of our coaching staff. Right now, everybody 
here feels John Ray is the better player. That doesn't minimize (McLemore's) 
ability or potential. But Mark needs to play every day. It's the same exact 
situation we had coming out of spring training. Nothing has changed." 
</P>
<P>
McLemore's demotion creates a roster vacancy the Angels say they will fill 
today. With relievers Bryan Harvey and Willie Fraser weakened by the flu, the 
Angels will probably recall a pitcher, which will again give Rader an 11-man 
staff. "That's a good assumption," Rader said. And a good possibility is 
left-hander Vance Lovelace, although Rader said Lovelace has been "a little 
spotty, a little inconsistent" at Edmonton. Lovelace was on the Angels' 
opening-day roster, but pitched only one inning before being optioned to 
Edmonton to make room for shortstop Kent Anderson on April 13. Another 
possibility: Dick Schofield's return from the 21-day disabled list. Schofield 
is eligible to be reactivated on Wednesday and Rader said the shortstop could 
be ready to play some time this week. Tony Armas (hamstring injury) is still 
two weeks away, according to Rader.

If Houston and Laffit Pincay don't win the Kentucky Derby next Saturday at 
Churchill Downs, the first-place horse will be ridden by a jockey who has never 
won the Triple Crown race before. 
</P>
<P>
While the 115th Derby will have its biggest favorite since Spectacular Bid in 
1979 -- Easy Goer and his lesser-regarded entrymate, Awe Inspiring, will be the 
odds-on choice -- it is also a race virtually devoid of jockeys with winning 
Derby experience. 
</P>
<P>
Pincay rode in the Derby 10 times before Swale gave him his first victory in 
1984 and his overall record in the race is one for 15. Not counting the 
undecided riding assignments on four of the 16 horses -- Majesty's Imp, Flying 
Continental, Notation and Wind Splitter -- the announced jockeys have an 
aggregate record of one victory in 41 Derby tries. 
</P>
<P>
ABC will spend 90 minutes televising the two-minute Derby and the network could 
use most of the time just introducing some of Saturday's riders. Three of the 
jockeys -- Jo Jo Ladner on Northern Wolf, Chris DeCarlo aboard Faultless Ensign 
and Don Pettinger with Clever Trevor -- will be riding in their first Derby and 
three other riders will be making only their second appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Name jockeys -- Jacinto Vasquez, Jorge Velasquez, Eddie Delahoussaye (twice), 
Pincay, Angel Cordero, Bill Shoemaker, Chris McCarron and Gary Stevens -- have 
won every Derby run in the 1980s and only Pincay appears to have a mount this 
time, although there is talk at Churchill Downs Sunday that Shoemaker, who has 
won the race four times, might wind up riding Flying Continental. 
</P>
<P>
These are some of the reasons why an uncommonly high number of unknown jockeys 
will become prominent names if only for a day: 
</P>
<P>
 -- With Easy Goer such a heavy favorite, many top California and New York 
jockeys are staying home and riding at Hollywood Park rather than shopping for 
a Derby mount. "They can make a lot of money without leaving town, especially 
if the horse they might ride in Kentucky doesn't have much of a chance to beat 
Easy Goer, which is the case with most of the horses in the Derby," said Jack 
Robbins, who as owner Jack Kent Cooke's West Coast adviser is shopping for a 
jockey to ride Flying Continental. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Trainers this year are showing unusual loyalty to the jockeys who rode 
horses in the races that brought them to the Derby. Frank Brothers, for 
example, successfully insisted that Larry Snyder ride Dansil even though the 
colt's owner, John Franks, reportedly preferred a change. Snyder rode Dansil to 
victory in the Arkansas Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pat Day, who rode some other Derby horses -- including Western Playboy and 
Notation -- in successful preps, had to be replaced because of his long-term 
commitment with Easy Goer. 
</P>
<P>
If Day wins he will need no introduction, although he has never won at the 
Derby in six tries. Day has won many another major races, including three 
victories in the Breeders' Cup and one Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
Day's most bitter experience in the Derby came in 1987. He rode the favorite, 
Demons Begone, and the colt bled profusely from the nostrils and had to be 
pulled up on the backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
"I have the feeling that there's a Derby up there someplace with my name on 
it," Day said. "Maybe this will be my year." 
</P>
<P>
Julie Krone, racing's premier female jockey, could have become the third woman 
to ride in the Derby, but she turned down the mount on Wind Splitter. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to finish last," Krone said. Wind Splitter is winless in five 
starts this year, losing his last race on a disqualification at Pimlico after 
finishing first. 
</P>
<P>
Krone might have been more receptive had she been offered the mount on 
Faultless Ensign, who won the Garden State Stakes in New Jersey in his last 
start. Krone was aboard Faultless Ensign the race before that, a seventh-place 
finish, but Ben Perkins Sr., the father of the horse's trainer and manager of 
the syndicate that owns the colt, said the sorry performance by the colt wasn't 
her fault. 
</P>
<P>
"Julie followed our instructions to the letter," Perkins said. "But we gave her 
bad instructions." 
</P>
<P>
DeCarlo, 20, won the Garden State with Faultless Ensign and has retained the 
mount in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got no problem using a jock who's never ridden in the Derby," Perkins 
said. "Look at some of the jockeys who have won the race, guys like Bill 
Boland, Ira Hanford and Steve Cauthen." 
</P>
<P>
The only two apprentices to win the Derby have been Hanford, with Bold Venture 
in 1936, and Boland, aboard Middleground in 1950. Boland was listed as a 
16-year-old when he won, but he said years later that he lied about his age to 
get a jockey license a year sooner and was actually 15 when he rode 
Middleground. Affirmed gave Cauthen a Derby victory five days after the 
jockey's 18th birthday in 1980. With Affirmed, Cauthen later became the 
youngest jockey to ever sweep the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
Clever Trevor has won eight of 12 starts and Pettinger, a leading jockey at 
Remington Park in Oklahoma City, Okla., has ridden the good-looking gelding 
every time. 
</P>
<P>
"We never considered anybody else to ride in the Derby," said Donnie Von Hemel, 
who trains Clever Trevor. "Don is a good rider and he sure knows this horse. 
Besides riding him every race, he's also been on him every time he's breezed, 
even going back to his 2-year-old year, before he ever ran." 
</P>
<P>
The Von Hemel and Pettinger families have been connected in racing for about 20 
years. Pettinger's brother, an assistant trainer under Jack VanBerg, was a 
jockey who rode almost all of the horses for Von Hemel's father. 
</P>
<P>
McCarron, who rode Hawkster in his last race, a fourth-place finish in the 
Santa Anita Derby, wasn't interested in riding the colt in the Derby, which 
McCarron won with Alysheba in 1987. So trainer Ron McAnally came up with Marco 
Castaneda, 38. A rider since 1965, Castaneda is getting his second chance in 
the Derby, having finished fourth with Water Bank, another McAnally trainee, in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a hot (blooded) horse, so we hope a cool rider will balance it out," 
McAnally said. 
</P>
<P>
Castaneda is known for sitting still on a horse. It's the kind of the style 
that has gotten him a return ticket to Churchill Downs, where program sales 
should be up this Saturday. The 125,000 or so fans won't be able to tell most 
of the Derby jockeys without one.

MT. WHITNEY FISH HATCHERY HAS KEPT EASTERN SIERRA WATERS WELL-STOCKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Mt. Whitney Fish Hatchery, like its nearby namesake, looks as if it will 
survive forever the harsh elements of the Sierra Nevada, as well as the demands 
of California's freshwater anglers. 
</P>
<P>
A copy on a wall of the Dec. 17, 1915 edition of the Inyo Independent carries 
the banner headline: "World's Largest Fish Hatchery To Be Built Here," and the 
story says it will be "one of the showplaces in the state." 
</P>
<P>
Later pictures show fish being transported to streams and lakes in tanks on 
mules. 
</P>
<P>
And yet five years ago this classic stone fortress was brought to its knees by 
a microscopic parasite that created a crisis for the state's entire hatchery 
system -- a crisis, it seems in retrospect, that could have been ignored, with 
hardly any of the state's nearly 2 million anglers the wiser. 
</P>
<P>
The hatchery was shut down in 1984 because of disease -- myxosoma cerebralis -- 
in the portion of its water supply from the north fork of Oak Creek that flows 
down the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada into the Owens Valley. The south 
fork supply was OK but insufficient in volume to sustain production. 
</P>
<P>
The protozoa-borne ailment, harmless to humans, causes degeneration of 
cartilage and brain tissue in fish, prompting some to swim, or whirl, in 
circles when stressed and causing deformities in perhaps one-half of 1%. 
</P>
<P>
The shutdown was a loss productively, historically and aesthetically. While 
most of the state's 23 hatcheries are undistinguished tin-roofed buildings, Mt. 
Whitney is a picturesque structure that was built for $60,000 and would cost 
millions to duplicate today. 
</P>
<P>
It is California's second oldest hatchery, next to the one at Mt. Shasta that 
dates to 1888. It not only is one of only three in the Eastern Sierra, but one 
of only three producing eggs for the entire state. 
</P>
<P>
Its shutdown was a crisis. Not only were 2 million fingerlings and 350,000 
catchable-size fish purposely destroyed, but the entire system was at risk of 
crashing. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Rowan, supervisor of the Department of Fish and Game's Eastern Sierra 
hatcheries, said, "We were pushing everything off to the Fish Springs hatchery 
(near Big Pine) and had them loaded to the gunwales raising every fish they 
could possibly grow. 
</P>
<P>
"We were sitting on the brink of a major disaster all the time. It's scary when 
you have that many fish, and all you need to have is a power outage, then you 
lose your wells and your whole crop." 
</P>
<P>
But it remains a fair question to ask, if the disease is so harmless, why hit 
the panic button? 
</P>
<P>
"It was the first time it was diagnosed at a state hatchery in California," 
said Jim Riley, who has managed the hatchery for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Riley lives in a ranch-style house on the property and has raised five children 
from two marriages there. He traces the panic to earlier years when the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service placed whirling disease in the catastrophic category. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't understand it and, historically, if you don't understand something 
you run scared of it. So if your fish are exposed to it, you destroy 'em, and 
that's what we did." 
</P>
<P>
Then, over the next four years, the creek was fish-killed with the chemical 
formula rotenone three times, and the facilities at Mt. Whitney and the Black 
Rock rearing ponds eight miles away, where Mt. Whitney's eggs are sent to 
hatch, were treated thoroughly with chlorine. 
</P>
<P>
Riley said there has been no sign of whirling disease in the hatchery for six 
months but doubts it has been eradicated. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still in the water supply, still in the creek," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Does it matter? 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're gonna end up just living with it," Riley said. "It doesn't do 
any more damage than other things we live with." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the DFG was very cautious when it put Mt. Whitney back into about 
one-third operation this year. A couple of dozen new 25-foot-long aluminum 
troughs stand dry and idle in the breeding shed, perhaps never to be used. 
</P>
<P>
Because the disease isn't transmitted directly from fish to fish, the two-acre 
breeding pond at Black Rock is being used again, but Mt. Whitney, with 2,300 
brooders, is not allowed to hatch any fish, just take eggs. 
</P>
<P>
"One of these days we hope to get it back into full swing," Riley said, 
"because we've got all those troughs where we used to raise a lot of little 
guys that were planted in the back country by air." 
</P>
<P>
Riley may never see it. He retires next year. 
</P>
<P>
Where the Eastern Sierra would be without hatcheries is sobering to consider. 
</P>
<P>
Without fishing, the economy of the Owens Valley would collapse. L.A. might as 
well take all the water it wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Native, or "wild," fish, Rowan says, would not come close to sustaining the 
sport. In fact, he smiles when someone talks about "wild" trout. 
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, there were no game fish in the region until some 
private sportsmen, such as the Rainbow Club of Bishop, stocked the streams and 
lakes themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, few reproduce. A hatchery fish, even if he isn't among the estimated 
90% that are caught, lives no more than three years, usually less. 
</P>
<P>
"We plant fingerlings," Rowan said, "and that's where the natives come from -- 
the so-called 'wild' fish. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care what these wild trout fishermen say, those 'wild trout' came from 
a hatchery." 
</P>
<P>
But the fingerlings are drawn from hardier, wilder strains than the catchable 
fish -- mostly rainbows -- and grow up in natural environments with stream 
smarts. They become more difficult to catch and, especially in the case of the 
German browns, thus give themselves time to grow to trophy size. 
</P>
<P>
Most fishermen, Rowan said, don't realize how many premium fish there are in 
the Eastern Sierra. The state's hatcheries produce about 53 million catchables 
a year -- trout, salmon, steelhead and catfish -- at a cost of about $1.60 per 
pound, or 40 cents apiece average size, but some tip the scales better than 
that. 
</P>
<P>
"There are brown trout in all the streams," Rowan said. "People don't catch 'em 
because they're fishing with salmon eggs, and they don't know how. The average 
fishermen that come up here, all they can catch are the planted trout. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing that really showed us was 1984. When we had the whirling disease 
wipe us out at Whitney Hatchery, we quit planting the north fork of Oak Creek. 
One guy was camped up there, and we went in there with a shocker to see what 
fish were left in there. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy had been fishing this one little hole without getting a bite, and 
with the shocker we knocked six brown trout right out of there, and (he said) 
'Wow! Where'd those come from?' 
</P>
<P>
"If everybody knew how to fish for these things, they'd clean 'em out." 
</P>
<P>
Also in '84, the DFG allowed people to fish right out of the Black Rock rearing 
ponds before killing whatever number of the 350,000 remained. 
</P>
<P>
"There were hordes of fish you could catch with a bare hook," Rowan said. "We 
had people commenting, 'I've never had enough trout for a meal,' and 'Wow! this 
is fantastic.' 
</P>
<P>
"They loved it. (They asked,) 'Can we do this next year?' " 
</P>
<P>
Some people still fish that way, descending upon certain holes the moment a 
hatchery worker unloads a net full, while the fish are still too much in shock 
to scatter. 
</P>
<P>
"It may not seem much like sport to do something like that, but there's nothing 
we can do about it," Rowan said. "That's the only way some people can catch 
fish, and even then they can't catch 'em, which is amazing to me. 
</P>
<P>
"They've talked about planting at night (or) about closing a section of stream 
for a day or so after it's been planted. There's no way they could enforce 
that. Night planting, I'm sure we'd have problems with people getting hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Rowan's three Eastern Sierra hatcheries each has had its own crisis in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Hot Creek, a prime flyfishing site near Mammoth Lakes that is fed by thermal 
springs, is near a proposed geothermal power development that has been 
vigorously opposed by the DFG and sportsmen who fear the plant would seriously 
alter the quality of the water for the stream and the hatchery. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of on hold again," Rowan said. "We were worried for a while that if 
they were to start that thing up we were going to lose water or temperature. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the drought, our springs are flowing considerably less than normal, 
anyway. We had to go to makeshift electric aeration to keep from losing our 
crop in the production ponds."

Alberto Mancini of Argentina, who upset second-ranked Mats Wilander Saturday, 
defeated third-ranked Boris Becker Sunday to win the Monte Carlo Open. 
</P>
<P>
Mancini, 19, battled for more than four hours before stopping the West German 
and his new-found clay-court game, 7-5, 2-6, 7-6 (7-4), 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
"This year is beginning very good and giving me a lot of confidence for the 
rest of the year," said Mancini, who played in only one other final in his pro 
career, winning that one last year at Bologna, Italy. "To beat Wilander and 
Becker on center court in Monte Carlo . . . it's like a dream." 
</P>
<P>
Mancini and Becker stayed on the baseline, with Becker making only occasional 
charges to the net because his serve was not in sync. 
</P>
<P>
Mancini won the first set when he broke Becker in the 12th game. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't serve great," Becker said. "When I served for the set twice I could 
have served better. But he played the important points well. I was playing 
against a player with a great future." 
</P>
<P>
In the 84-minute third set, the players dropped their services a total of six 
times before Mancini won the tiebreaker after wasting two set points in the 
12th game. 
</P>
<P>
Mancini came back from a 2-5 deficit in the fourth set, reeling off the last 
five games. Mancini, whose career earnings were under $155,000, received 
$122,900 for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Becker, who was awarded $61,450 for finishing second, was playing in the first 
clay-court final of his pro career. The last time he reached a final in a clay 
court tournament was in a junior event in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, I was able to put one or two good matches together on clay," Becker 
said. "Now the big difference is that I put five good matches in a row, and 
this week was the proof I could do it. I beat four good players and had a 
chance to beat another who beat Wilander 6-0 and 6-3." 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen-year-old Monica Seles won a tournament for the first time in her pro 
career, upsetting top-seeded Chris Evert, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4, in the Virginia Slims 
of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Seles said she didn't believe she could win the match until she took a 5-2 lead 
in the third set. 
</P>
<P>
"Even in the first set today , I didn't think I had a chance to win," Seles 
said. "In the second set, I loosened up a bit and played better on a few points 
than Chris. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when it hit me and I almost let her get away." 
</P>
<P>
Seles faltered only briefly, losing her serve in the eighth game of the second 
set when serving for the match. Evert held at love in the ninth game. 
</P>
<P>
Serving for the match again in the 10th game, Seles took a 40-love lead. Evert 
staved off one match point with a volley winner but netted a drop shot to end 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Evert, 34, said it was not a disgrace to lose to Seles. 
</P>
<P>
"If you lose to someone who's not a good player, then you should be concerned," 
Evert said. "But she's a good player." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Jones, the former Pepperdine standout ranked 363rd in the world, defeated 
Amos Mansdorf of Israel, 6-1, 7-5, in the final of the $93,400 Epson Singapore 
Super tournament at Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
Said Mansdorf: "I was expecting an easy game. But he played well. He played 
better than me." 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Ramesh Krishnan of India defeated second-seeded Jonathan Canter, 
6-1, 6-3, to win the Dunlop Masters tournament at Toyota, Japan.

Are you ready for Garrow and Galbraith? 
</P>
<P>
After the biggest singles victory of his career, Pat Galbraith talked about 
finishing his last quarter of school at UCLA, then joining Bruin teammate Brian 
Garrow on the professional tour, possibly to debut in July at the Newport, 
R.I., tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we can do pretty well," Galbraith said. 
</P>
<P>
The left-handed serve-and-volley specialist from Tacoma, Wash., did pretty well 
on his own at the Ojai Valley tournament. He won the Pacific 10 singles 
championship Sunday with a startlingly easy, 6-2, 6-1, victory over UCLA 
teammate Buff Farrow. 
</P>
<P>
Even though they have played on the same college team, Galbraith and Farrow 
played each other only once before, in a junior event when they were 15 years 
old. Galbraith won that one, too, in straight sets. 
</P>
<P>
Farrow, a singles specialist, wilted under the constant pressure of Galbraith's 
volleys, although Galbraith got his first break on a double fault by Farrow. 
Bad luck didn't help, either. 
</P>
<P>
Serving at 2-3 in the first set, Farrow saved one break point when Galbraith 
sent a forehand approach into the net, but Farrow double-faulted on the second. 
</P>
<P>
Galbraith held serve to lead, 5-2, then broke Farrow again to win the first 
set. Farrow hit a forehand that clipped the net cord and bounced wide to set up 
a break point that Galbraith won on a deftly placed drop shot that Farrow could 
only touch with his racket. 
</P>
<P>
"He just never gave me a chance to get in the match," said Farrow, who at No. 7 
is ranked 53 places higher than Galbraith in singles. 
</P>
<P>
The only break Galbraith needed in the second set was in the second game when 
he broke Farrow with a backhand volley winner. Down 0-5, Farrow held serve, but 
Galbraith closed the match quickly, though not before Farrow hit the net cord 
again with the ball bouncing wide. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just hitting my first volley well and putting a lot of pressure on him," 
Galbraith said. "He had to hit a great shot to win the point." 
</P>
<P>
Farrow didn't hit enough great shots or lucky shots. 
</P>
<P>
Galbraith is hoping to be a seeded singles player at the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. tournament, but he said his tennis future will be as a doubles 
specialist. He and Garrow, reigning NCAA doubles champions, played in the U.S. 
Open last year and lost to Miloslav Mecir and Tomas Smid in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
"Even after this, I'm still going to be known as a doubles player, but maybe 
people will start worrying about me in singles a little bit now," Galbraith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Like the men's final, the Pac-10 women's singles championship was a one-school 
affair. This time, it was Stanford, the runaway team champion, with Sandra 
Birch playing teammate Debbie Graham. 
</P>
<P>
Birch won, 6-1, 1-6, 6-2, in a match in which the loser said the sound from the 
television booth played a part in her defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Graham complained that she often heard the comments of Prime Ticket announcer 
Mike Walden during the match. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so distracting," she said. "You are about to serve at a crucial point 
and you hear how many double faults you have." 
</P>
<P>
Graham had 13 of them, which in itself was more than enough to cause her 
trouble, no matter how troublesome it may have been to hear continual updates. 
</P>
<P>
Birch said she got an earful, too, but tuned everything out. For her, it was 
more of a geographical dislike. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd keep hearing, 'Debbie Graham of Fountain Valley' so I blocked the rest of 
it out," said Birch, who is from Huntington Bay, N.Y.

RYAN GUNS DOWN RED SOX IN BATTLE OF TEXANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The temperature was 82 degrees in Arlington, Tex., but the heat was on. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Clemens outscored Nolan Ryan on the speed gun, but Rafael Palmeiro hit a 
two-run homer off Clemens in the eighth inning Sunday to give the Texas Rangers 
a 2-1 victory over the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard to keep from being a spectator," Texas Manager Bobby Valentine 
said. "You couldn't ask for any two pitchers to do more than Nolan and Roger 
did." 
</P>
<P>
Clemens reached 96 m.p.h. on the speed gun and Ryan's fastest pitches were 
clocked at 95. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan fell behind early, throwing a wild pitch in the first with Danny Heep at 
third base, but the run was costly for the Red Sox. After Wade Boggs walked to 
open the game and was forced at second by Heep, a Ryan fastball hit Ellis Burks 
on the ear flap of his helmet and the ball glanced off Burks' shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
After Burks was forced to leave the game with a bruised shoulder, Mike 
Greenwell grounded out to move up the runners, and Heep scored on Ryan's wild 
pitch to Jim Rice on an 0-and-2 count. 
</P>
<P>
"The way Roger was pitching I figured that run would hold up," Ryan said. "It 
was just the kind of game I expected him to pitch. He was dominating. 
</P>
<P>
"But there's something about this team. It just won't die." 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers lead the American League West with a 17-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old Ryan (3-1), who lives in Alvin, Tex., allowed three hits in 
eight innings and struck out 11, the 184th time in his career he struck out 10 
or more. His 49 strikeouts in 35 innings lead the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens (3-1), who lives 40 miles from Ryan in Katy, Tex., pitched a six-hitter 
and struck out six in his second complete game this season. He has 40 
strikeouts, second to Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great game to pitch in," Clemens said. "Ryan was Ryan. The thing is 
his curve is so outstanding you can't set on any other pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame that a game like that will come down to one pitch but it 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
Clemens' lead held up until Cecil Espy singled and Palmeiro homered off the 
right-field foul pole, 330-feet away, on a high fastball. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second home run of the season for Palmeiro and broke a streak of 24 
scoreless innings for Clemens against Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"I struck out on the same pitch earlier," Palmeiro said. "It's the biggest hit 
of my life. It came against Clemens and in one of the best pitching 
performances I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan's last start against Boston was a six-hit shutout for the Angels on July 
9, 1979. He spent nine seasons in the National League with the Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan threw 136 pitches before Jeff Russell relieved to start the ninth. Russell 
struck out two of the three batters he faced for his fifth save. 
</P>
<P>
"I agreed with Bobby Valentine that I should come out," Ryan said. "I had great 
stuff, including a very good curveball, but I was getting a little tired. A 
knot in my back flared up in the third inning." 
</P>
<P>
Clemens and Ryan are scheduled for a rematch Friday night at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 2, Milwaukee 0 -- Floyd Bannister allowed three hits over 8 1/3 
innings and the Royals completed a three-game sweep of the Brewers at Kansas 
City. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Eisenreich singled home a run in the first inning off Mike Birkbeck (0-2) 
and the Royals added a run in the second when Bill Buckner doubled, was 
sacrificed to third and scored on Brad Wellman's infield out. 
</P>
<P>
Bannister (3-0) was 0-3 against the Brewers last season and is 6-11 in his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 4, Seattle 3 -- Mickey Tettleton hit a two-run homer in the eighth 
inning and Jeff Ballard became the first pitcher in Oriole history to win five 
games in April by beating the Mariners at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Ballard (5-0) gave up three runs on seven hits in seven innings. Mark 
Williamson pitched the final two innings for his fourth save. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 7, Oakland 2 -- Lou Whitaker hit a three-run homer as the Tigers 
knocked out Storm Davis in a five-run second inning and downed the Athletics at 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Tanana (2-3) allowed two runs, one earned, and struck out five in 7 2/3 
innings for hissecond straight victory after going winless for 11 starts. 
</P>
<P>
New York 5, Chicago 2 -- Don Slaught hit a three-run double in the first inning 
to back the four-hit pitching of John Candelaria and Lance McCullers as the 
Yankees defeated the White Sox at New York for their fourth straight victory. 
</P>
<P>
Candelaria (3-2) allowed three hits, struck out four and walked one in 5 1/3 
innings, leaving with discomfort in his right knee. McCullers pitched 3 2/3 
innings for his first save. Melido Perez (1-3) lost his third straight 
decision, allowing all five runs in 4 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 2, Cleveland 1 -- Al Newman's run-scoring single snapped a 
seventh-inning tie and the Twins edged the Indians at Minneapolis to break a 
seven-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Smith (2-1) and Jeff Reardon combined on a five-hitter for the Twins, who 
got a run on consecutive singles by Gene Larkin, Carmen Castillo and Brian 
Harper in the fourth. Cleveland tied it on Dave Clark's homer in the fifth.

The 42nd Newport-to-Ensenada yacht race dragged to a close Sunday when the last 
of the 406 boats remaining in the race eased across the finish line shortly 
before the finish deadline at 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
How slow was the race? The official report from the sponsoring Newport Ocean 
Sailing Assn. said that 406 of the 520 starters crossed the line under sail, 
making it one of the slowest on record. 
</P>
<P>
The slowness of the race didn't dampen the spirits of the hundreds who crowded 
the patio of the Bahia Hotel to witness the trophy presentation that officially 
ended the race. 
</P>
<P>
Winner of the President of Mexico trophy for the best corrected time in the 
International Offshore Rule (IOR) class was Amante, co-skippered by Bud and Mel 
Richley of Lido Isle Yacht Club.

ERIC DAVIS HAS BEEN QUITE A PHILADELPHIA STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
If Eric Davis really wants a change of scenery, perhaps he should consider 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who has talked of returning to his home in Los Angeles when he becomes a 
free agent, continued his run of success in Veterans Stadium Sunday with a 
two-run homer in the ninth inning that gave the Cincinnati Reds a 5-3 victory 
over the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't explain it," Davis said. "Some parks you feel good in, some you don't. 
I happen to feel real comfortable here. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a fastball outside. I got my arms extended and hit the ball out." 
</P>
<P>
In just over three seasons in the majors, Davis has hit 18 home runs against 
the Phillies, 13 of them in Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' game-winner to right field came off reliever Steve Bedrosian, who 
replaced Larry McWilliams (1-1) after pinch-hitter Dave Collins walked to start 
the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Bedrosian retired two batters and went to a full count on Davis before the 
homer. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't do the job again," said Bedrosian, who gave up a game-winning home 
run for the third time this season. "I felt I was throwing good. That's what 
makes it so tough." 
</P>
<P>
Rob Dibble (3-0) pitched two scoreless innings for the Reds and John Franco 
pitched the ninth for his eighth save in eight opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds had a 3-1 lead, but the Phillies got even in the sixth inning when 
Tommy Herr singled and Von Hayes followed with his second homer of the game and 
seventh of the season. It was the eighth time Hayes has hit two homers in a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Schmidt followed with a double and went to third on a single by Chris 
James. Kent Tekulve relieved Tom Browning and struck out Ricky Jordan while 
James was stealing second. 
</P>
<P>
Dickie Thon also struck out, and after Steve Lake walked to load the bases, 
Norm Charlton came in to retire Bob Dernier on a pop up. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati took a 2-0 lead in the fourth when Paul O'Neill singled with two out 
and Ken Griffey hit his first home run of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes homered in the bottom of the inning to make it 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati went ahead, 3-1, in the sixth when Kal Daniels led off with a 
double, took third on Barry Larkin's single and scored on O'Neill's sacrifice 
fly. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 7, New York 6 -- Mike Scott wasn't around for the finish at Houston, 
but he beat the Mets for the first time in the regular season since May 16, 
1985, as the Astros snapped New York's six-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Scott (4-1) left the game with a 7-3 lead after five innings when his left 
hamstring tightened. He struck out six, allowing five hits and three unearned 
runs. Scott, acquired by Houston from New York in 1982, entered the game with a 
2-7 record against the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros roughed up David Cone (2-2) for seven runs, five earned, in 2 1/3 
innings -- the shortest stint of his career as a starter. Kevin Bass and Terry 
Puhl each had two-run triples for Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 7, San Diego 3 -- Curt Wilkerson doubled and tripled, scored two runs 
and drove in another as the Cubs turned back the Padres at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkerson doubled to spark a two-run first inning against Eric Show (4-2). He 
tripled home a run in the fourth and scored on a wild pitch by Show. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Sanderson (2-2) allowed two runs in the first inning and then retired 18 
of the next 19 Padres before Mark Parent hit a home run with two out in the 
seventh. Sanderson allowed five hits in seven innings, walking one and striking 
out four. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 9, Atlanta 6 -- Otis Nixon hit a three-run double and Spike Owen added 
his first National League homer as the Expos completed a three-game sweep at 
Montreal, sending the Braves to a sixth straight defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Hubie Brooks also had a home run to help Brian Holman (1-0) win his first start 
of the season. Holman pitched 5 2/3 innings, allowing nine hits. Gene Harris 
went 2 1/3 innings and Tim Burke finished for his sixth save, getting out of a 
bases loaded, no-out jam in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Derek Lilliquist (1-2) drove in a run with his first major league hit to put 
Atlanta ahead in the second, but the Expos scored four times in the bottom of 
the inning. One run scored when third baseman Ron Gant made a throwing error on 
Holman's two-out infield single, and Nixon's double made it 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 11, San Francisco 1 -- Steve Carter's first major-league home run 
sparked a four-run first and Bobby Bonilla hit two run-scoring doubles as the 
Pirates trounced the Giants at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Walk (2-2) allowed four hits in going the distance to beat former teammate 
Don Robinson, who lasted just two-plus innings in his first career start 
against the team he played for from 1978-87. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates, who lost four of their previous five games, chased Robinson (1-2) 
in the third on Bonilla's second run-scoring double. Bonilla hit a third double 
in the eighth and scored on Junior Ortiz's sacrifice fly.

THOMPSON APPEARS AT HOME IN PLAYOFFS; 
</P>
<P>
FORMER PORTLAND PLAYER WATCHES AS SCORING INCREASES DURING THE PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mychal Thompson, the man who would be prime minister of the Bahamas, also has 
this thing about Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
With relatives and his own off-season home in the Portland area, he can save 
money. 
</P>
<P>
"A whole lot of per-diem," Thompson said. "My in-laws are there, so they can 
cook up some lasagna." 
</P>
<P>
He can save his strength. 
</P>
<P>
"They can baby-sit, too." 
</P>
<P>
And, with one more Laker victory over the Portland Trail Blazers in the 
best-of-five Western Conference quarterfinals, he can save face. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to hang out with those guys all summer," Thompson said of the 
Portland players. "If we lose this series, I won't be able to show my face in 
Oregon." 
</P>
<P>
Sweet motivation. 
</P>
<P>
But Sunday, Thompson's pride appeared as safe as the Lakers' immediate future, 
the result of a 113-105 victory at the Forum that gave the two-time defending 
National Basketball Assn. champions a 2-0 series lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers have defeated underdog Portland by a total of 28 points, and 
Thompson, his playing time having climbed again during the playoffs, is doing 
his share: 20 points Thursday in Game 1 followed by 15 Sunday, a combined 14 of 
21 from the field, and an average of 26 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
His two most important scores came in Game 2, as the Trail Blazers cut the 
Laker lead to seven points, 69-62, midway through the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
With 6:18 to play, his basket and subsequent free throw for a three-point play 
pushed the cushion back to double digits and started an 11-1 run. After 
Portland failed to score in its next possession, Thompson rebounded a James 
Worthy miss and layed it in, giving the Lakers a 74-62 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Good showings in the playoffs are nothing new to Thompson, especially in the 
first round -- he averaged 20.7 points and 13 rebounds in last season's opener 
against San Antonio. But that it comes against the Trail Blazers, his former 
team, is special. 
</P>
<P>
Portland made Thompson, from the University of Minnesota, the first player 
picked in the 1978 draft, and he spent his first seven seasons as a Trail 
Blazer. He still has a home in Oregon, as well as his native Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
"Our guys are on him like crazy about that," Laker Coach Pat Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, who lives with his wife and young son in a hotel suite in Los Angeles 
during the season, has fond memories of his days in Portland. Now, he returns 
as a member of the team that Wednesday night could end the Trail Blazers' 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice up there," he said. "They (the fans) really respect the Lakers, as 
much as they give us a bad time. The Lakers are the favorite visiting team for 
most of the Oregonians, because of Magic (Johnson) and the whole championship 
aura. We're always the hottest ticket in town." 
</P>
<P>
Does that mean Thompson will be the most wanted man? 
</P>
<P>
He lacks the aura, but did average a creditable 12.6 points and 7.8 rebounds 
this season against the Trail Blazers without ever starting, including 
single-game highs of 27 and 12, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
He can create problems for anyone during the playoffs, in which he contributed 
9.7 points and 8.8 rebounds last season during the Lakers' drive to a second 
championship. In 74 games in nine post-season runs, he's at 12.6 points and is 
shooting 50.7%. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a big-game player," Riley said. "When some guys don't get to play a lot 
of minutes, it can be tough. But he's a very unselfish player and some of his 
numbers don't reflect that he is a front-line player for us. He is great in the 
playoffs, when his minutes go up. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone acts surprised when he gets to the playoffs and his numbers go up. 
They shouldn't be." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, for one, isn't surprised. He expects the increased opportunities, 
even looks forward to it. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to get something off the bench or you're going to have a lot of 
trouble winning a championship," he said. "Orlando (Woolridge), Michael Cooper, 
Tony Campbell and myself, we are guys Pat Riley depends on. We have to be able 
to match bench strength with whoever we're playing in the playoffs. It's 
imperative for our four-man unit. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all a little tired and beat up and looking forward to summer. But I also 
know we are not ready to take a vacation for several more weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe then it'll be back to Oregon. He should be able to show his face by then.

BRITISH WPP MAKES BID FOR AD FIRM OGILVY; 
</P>
<P>
CASH OFFER TO CREATE HUGE HOLDING COMPANY GETS COOL RECEPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A long-rumored takeover bid for Ogilvy Group Inc. materialized Sunday with the 
announcement that Britain's WPP Group PLC has made a cash offer of about $720 
million for the New York advertising company. 
</P>
<P>
Ogilvy greeted the bid frostily, declaring that the proposal "suffers from 
serious flaws in business logic." 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Ogilvy Chairman Kenneth Roman attacked the price, 
style and substance of the WPP offer by saying: "The boot strap character of 
WPP's approach is further underlined by the lack of committed financing even 
for what is obviously intended to be a starting price." 
</P>
<P>
WPP may not be easily deterred, however, if history is any lesson. Two years 
ago, the British company pulled off the first hostile takeover in the 
advertising business with its $566-million acquisition of J. Walter Thompson 
Co. -- and has generally been accorded good marks for digesting the firm. 
</P>
<P>
The WPP offer of $45 a share is a premium over Ogilvy's recent trading price. 
On Friday, the stock closed at $32, down 50 cents, in over-the-counter trading. 
The bid offers a multiple of about 20 times' earnings for Ogilvy, which 
reported $32.95 million in net income last year. 
</P>
<P>
If the two firms did merge, their combined billings would approximate those of 
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi PLC, currently the world's largest advertising holding 
company with billings of about $13.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
But Ogilvy spokesman Jonathan Rinehart responded with a "So what?" In a brief 
telephone interview from New York, Rinehart asked, "Does that make for better 
advertising? Better public relations? . . . We don't think it does." 
</P>
<P>
Rinehart conceded that WPP has made "praiseworthy improvements" at J. Walter 
Thompson, but he insisted that similar corrections "aren't there to make at 
Ogilvy." 
</P>
<P>
Ogilvy does not have the "low -- margin problems that can be cut by some 
cost-containment artist who can wring a lot of profit out," declared Rinehart, 
whose own public relations firm merged with Ogilvy in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ogilvy's 1988 operating margin was 7.9% -- compared to WPP's 9.5% -- 
Rinehart explained that a research subsidiary and new promotions unit in the 
United States depressed the solid 9.7% margin enjoyed by the firm's advertising 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Rinehart said Ogilvy received the takeover offer Friday in the form of a letter 
from WPP Chairman Martin Sorrell, which read "sort of like a sales pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Another executive who saw Sorrell's six-page letter said it went into 
painstaking detail about the advantages of a merger yet also tried to assure 
Ogilvy that it would have operating autonomy. Sorrell noted that Ogilvy has the 
stronger presence on the European continent, for example, while J. Walter 
Thompson is strong in Latin America, the executive said. In research, Ogilvy 
has a subsidiary that caters to individual clients' needs while a WPP unit 
produces broader reports, the executive said -- speaking on the condition that 
he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Founder Is Consultant 
</P>
<P>
Ogilvy's clients include Unilever, American Express, Polaroid and Ford. A 
source close to WPP said the companies have few conflicting accounts, noting 
that WPP also represents Unilever and Ford. 
</P>
<P>
Ogilvy was founded 41 years ago by David Ogilvy, who, at 77, continues to serve 
the company as a consultant and board member but owns less than 1% of the 
company's 16 million shares on a fully diluted basis. Employees and directors 
hold a total of about 14% of Ogilvy's stock, which has traded publicly since 
1966. 
</P>
<P>
In his prepared statement, Ogilvy's chairman said the board would meet "in due 
course" to consider the unsolicited bid, but as of Sunday, no date had been 
set, Rinehart said. 
</P>
<P>
For the year ended Dec. 31, 1988, WPP reported net income of $38.1 million on 
revenues of $974.7 million. In addition to J. Walter Thompson, the company's 
holdings range from the smaller ad agency of Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein 
Inc. to the giant public relations firm of Hill and Knowlton. 
</P>
<P>
WPP's Sorrell is a former finance director of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, who in 
eight years helped mastermind that agency's entry into the U.S. market. In the 
past, analysts have characterized Sorrell as a numbers-oriented executive who 
is disinclined to meddle with creative decisions made at the agency level.

NORTON UTILITIES GURU STEPS OUT OF THE LIMELIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To the millions of personal computer users who have come to depend on his 
software programs and who have dubbed him the "software saint," the realization 
that Peter Norton has limits like any other mere mortal may be a bit hard to 
accept. 
</P>
<P>
But it's true. Peter Norton -- by his own admission -- no longer can run Peter 
Norton Computing, the software publishing house he founded in Santa Monica six 
years ago. And so today marks the completion of one of the most critical 
transitions in the life of a young company: from management by its founder to 
management by professionals recruited from other successful computer ventures. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not an executive and never was," admits Norton, the creator of the 
million-selling Norton Utilities, the program that, among other things, allows 
computer users to retrieve files that were carelessly or inexplicably zapped 
into oblivion. "My company has outgrown my management ability." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ads to Continue 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Norton, a tall, gawky fellow who appears far younger than his 45 
years, turned over the reins of his company to a new chief executive, Ronald 
Posner, whose experience in the PC software industry includes stints at Borland 
International in the Silicon Valley and Ashton-Tate in Torrance. And today, 
David Blumstein joins Norton from Ingram Micro D distributors in Santa Ana as 
president and chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
What will happen to Norton, one of the Los Angles area's few high-tech 
superstars? 
</P>
<P>
Well, for starters, he gets to continue appearing in the Dewar's Scotch ads, 
which are plastered all over freeway billboards and national magazines. As 
company chairman, he'll also concentrate on software planning, and he should 
have a lot more time to spend on his favorite avocation: patron of the arts in 
Los Angeles and Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Job Hopped 
</P>
<P>
Just 10 years ago, few would have predicted that Norton would become a sort of 
elder statesman in the computer industry. After dropping out of college in the 
middle of his senior thesis and taking another four years before completing his 
education, Norton spent the next 12 years drifting from one computer job to the 
next, never staying at one more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he lives with his wife and young children in a Santa Monica mansion 
filled with wild contemporary art and motors around the Westside in a gray BMW 
with a "MRIBMPC" vanity plate. 
</P>
<P>
"His program established the category of what we now know as PC utility 
programs," says Stewart Alsop, a personal computer market analyst in the 
Silicon Valley. "These programs overcome the shortcomings of computers, and his 
overcomes the biggest shortcoming of them all: the loss of your work. . . . He 
is an enormously respected figure in the business." 
</P>
<P>
On the strength of Norton's initial utilities program, introduced in 1983, and 
a couple of others, Peter Norton Computing reported sales last year of about 
$15 million. The company isn't about to rival Microsoft, which is galloping 
toward the $1-billion sales mark, for the No. 1 spot among software publishers. 
But it is sufficient to give the company the No. 30 spot in an annual ranking 
of the 100-largest software publishers compiled by Soft* Letter, a Boston 
newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
But the new management, with chairman Norton cheering them on, isn't content 
with being just No. 30. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Next Generation 
</P>
<P>
In an interview from their offices overlooking the Santa Monica pier, Posner 
said he and Blumstein will be responsible for mapping and executing a strategy 
to expand the business more quickly, a strategy that could include acquiring 
smaller software houses and taking the company public in the not-so-distant 
future. 
</P>
<P>
Although reluctant to reveal the precise directions of the future growth, 
Posner says he is eager to exploit untapped opportunities for the company's 
existing product line in international markets. In addition, he said the 
company, whose products so far have been written exclusively for IBM and 
compatible personal computers, is developing similar programs for other 
computers, such as Apple's Macintosh. 
</P>
<P>
The company is writing programs to run on computers using Unix, a set of 
computer operating instructions that typically run sophisticated and powerful 
systems used by scientists and engineers. Although the market for Unix machines 
so far has been limited, they figure to be used more frequently in the future 
as general-purpose office machines. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a hot market and one that we want to be in," Posner says. "And the basic 
service of our Utilities program is a natural for any computer. . . . In fact, 
you can expect to see us on all major machines in the future."

Damages Awarded in Suit on Honda ATV: Honda Motor Co. of Japan will appeal $5.9 
million in damages awarded to a Salem, Ore., man who was injured while riding a 
Honda three-wheel all-terrain vehicle, a spokesman said. A Multnomah County 
Circuit Court Jury awarded damages Friday for Karl Oberg, 24. Honda's 
all-terrain off-road vehicle has been banned from sale in the United States 
since March, 1988, when the U.S. government filed suits charging the vehicles 
had design flaws that made them dangerous. "Honda is extremely disappointed in 
the verdict and believes it is excessive and unwarranted," Kurt Antonius of 
American Honda Motor Co. Inc. of Gardena, Calif., said Saturday. "We will 
pursue all of the appropriate legal remedies, including appeal."

Chiat/Day Wins American Express Account: Yet another major piece of advertising 
business has been handed to the Venice-based ad firm Chiat/Day. The agency's 
New York office won the $20-million American Express Gold Card account. Also, 
the Gold Card's direct response marketing account will be handled by New 
York-based Perkins/Butler, a Chiat/Day subsidiary. The Gold Card's previous 
agency was McCann-Erickson, which retained the American Express Platinum Card 
business.

Heileman May Buy Interest in Stroh: G. Heileman Brewing officials have 
discussed buying a minority interest in the Stroh Brewery, touching off 
speculation about a possible merger between two of the nation's largest beer 
companies. But analysts question whether such a deal could clear federal 
antitrust laws. Stroh officials several weeks ago announced their willingness 
to sell a minority interest in the Detroit-based company, the third-largest 
brewer in the United States. The speculation about a merger was touched off 
when Murray Cutbush, president and chief executive of La Crosse, Wis.-based 
Heileman, disclosed that representatives from his company were in Detroit to 
meet with Stroh officials.

their owners, up from a 63.7% average in 1988. National vacancy rates in the 
first quarter stabilized at 7.3% in rental housing and 1.5% in home owner 
housing. It was highest in central cities, 8.1%, and lowest in the suburbs, 
6.1%.

Budgets for Capital Spending Rise: U.S. companies' appropriations for spending 
on new plant and equipment rose 33% in the last quarter of 1988 from the third 
quarter, the Conference Board said in a report for release today. The budget 
authorizations rose to $53.7 billion in the fourth quarter from $40.3 billion 
in the preceding quarter and $30.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 1987, the 
New York-based, business-supported research organization said. Appropriations 
are considered a good indicator of how high capital spending will be. They are 
the first step, preceding the ordering of equipment, the letting of 
construction contracts and actual spending. The petroleum industry led all 
sectors with a 157% increase in appropriations from the preceding quarter.

PEOPLE / HERBERT J. VIDA: COUPLE DECIDE TO GIVE BACK TO THEIR COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Herbert J. Vida 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clearly, Jennifer and Derek Werner know their goals. It's just that few people 
think the goals make any sense. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the husband and wife both have college degrees, jobs that, 
combined, grossed them $150,000 last year, and they own a house in Newport 
Beach worth $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
So they enlisted in the Army. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a decision made overnight," said Jennifer Werner, 29, who holds a 
degree in management psychology from Scripps College and was marketing medical 
products. "But the thought had been on our minds for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Derek Werner added: "We are a little out of the norm, but we have always felt 
we were fortunate to be United States citizens and wanted to give something 
back to the country. So we joined the Army." 
</P>
<P>
Joining the enlisted ranks, rather than as officers, allowed them to pick their 
billets following basic training. Both were assigned to the Defense Language 
Institute in Monterey, Calif., where they will learn the Polish language for a 
future assignment in military intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
They both hold the rank of private 1st class. 
</P>
<P>
The language school, also used by the CIA and the FBI, is considered the finest 
in the country, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, both plan to enter officers training school and make the military a 
20-year career. 
</P>
<P>
"We picked the Army because they were the most accommodating in what we wanted 
and in keeping a husband and wife together," said Derek Werner, 30, who holds 
an MBA in marketing and finance from Claremont Men's College and was working as 
a real estate developer in Newport Beach before his enlistment. 
</P>
<P>
The toughest part, both agreed, was basic training in South Carolina's Ft. 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 30 and the younger recruits called us grandma and grandpa, despite the 
fact we prepared ourselves physically," he said. "It was more trying to us on a 
maturity level. Some of the 18-year-olds wanted to talk all night and that was 
a little tough on us." 
</P>
<P>
They tried to keep things low-key. "We kept a low profile for the first 6 weeks 
until the base paper printed a story about us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The recruits couldn't believe we left our income to join the Army, and our 
surprise was that they were all so focused on money, so much that they even 
placed it ahead of their spouse, family and the nation. They couldn't 
understand why we wanted to give something back to our country." 
</P>
<P>
Derek Werner said his drill sergeant asked if the story was true and that his 
annual family income had been $150,000. "I told him it was all true and I added 
that money wasn't everything. He answered: 'To me it is.' " 
</P>
<P>
They both said that belief is different from the feelings they hold. "This is 
really a transformation and radically different from the American values of the 
past," Jennifer Werner said. "It seems the younger people are self-focused and 
selfish." 
</P>
<P>
The Werners said they learned an appreciation for the United States from what 
they saw in their previous travels, which have taken them to 60 countries, part 
of it on a 6-month honeymoon after their marriage 4 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I quote (President) Kennedy a lot of times because he had a lot to say in that 
little quote of contributing of yourself to your country in some little way," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
For some, April 18 is a special day. For instance, Christie Smith Bibeau of 
Corona del Mar was born on April 18, the same day as her father, Haviland V. 
Smith, 74, of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
So wouldn't you know it, she gave birth to son, Scott Robert Bibeau, on April 
18. 
</P>
<P>
"When the birthday comes around, We'll have a family celebration," Bibeau said. 
</P>
<P>
The guest list at "Fire Service Recognition Day" at the Fullerton Headquarters 
Fire Station on May 13 will certainly be less colorful than the special 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Pluggie the Talking Fire Hydrant will walk around with Smokey the 
Bear to chat about fire safety to anyone who will listen. 
</P>
<P>
And Little John, a restored 1941 white fire engine on loan from the Orange 
County Firemen's Assn., will give free rides at the 11 a.m. event.

JEWS REPAY DEBT TO A HEROINE FROM DAYS OF GESTAPO TERROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The penalty for helping Jews escape the German Gestapo during World War II was 
death. 
</P>
<P>
But that did not stop Polish teen-ager Irene Opdyke from hiding 12 Jewish 
friends in the basement of a German officer's villa, where she worked as a 
housekeeper. She saved countless other Jews by sharing information she 
overheard from Gestapo officers planning roundups in Jewish communities. 
</P>
<P>
In gratitude to Opdyke, who is 68 and lives in Yorba Linda, administrators at 
the Jewish Home for the Aged in Reseda violated all their admissions policies 
and admitted the heroine's husband into their Alzheimer's disease unit last 
week. William Opdyke, 80, will be one of only a handful of non-Jews at the 
home, which provides communal living for senior citizens from throughout Los 
Angeles County. He will also be one of the only people ever admitted directly 
into an intensive nursing care unit there. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, a requirement for admittance to the 875-bed facility in 
</P>
<P>
the San Fernando Valley has been that the residents be able to care for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Said Executive Director Sheldon Blumenthal: "We violated all the rules -- he's 
not from our region; we are sectarian; we are so short of beds -- but there are 
certain times when there are no rules. This is one of those times. In caring 
for Bill, we are repaying a debt to her. We owe her." 
</P>
<P>
Irene Opdyke's parents had taught her to respect all people, regardless of 
religious or ethnic background, she said in an interview. So the teen-age 
nursing student was horrified when she saw how Jews were treated after Hitler's 
armies invaded Poland in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
Once, she said, she watched as Nazis rounded up Jews from a residential 
neighborhood and took them to a forest where they were shot. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a nightmare that changed my life. I witnessed unbelievable things that 
I will never forget. The street was blocked up with barbed wire, and people 
were running all around. I saw a man with a white beard and a little white hat, 
running carrying a Torah. Little ones were screaming 'Mama, Mama!' " she said. 
"I saw a soldier pull a baby out of its mother's arms and throw him to the 
ground. Later, I heard shooting. They were killing innocent people. 
</P>
<P>
"I vowed then that if the opportunity arrived, I would help." 
</P>
<P>
Opdyke took her chance while working in a German officers' club. She was a 
waitress, serving meals to German military men and Gestapo agents. She also 
supervised the laundry crew -- a dozen Jewish people. As a waitress, Opdyke 
overheard Gestapo agents planning roundups in Jewish neighborhoods, and she 
passed the information to her friends in the laundry room. 
</P>
<P>
"We created a grapevine. I became the ears and eyes for the Jewish people and 
they spread the information around. We were able to save many lives," Opdyke 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the war, Gestapo chatter turned from roundups to labor camps to the 
"final solution" -- the planned liquidation of all Jews in Europe. "I knew if I 
didn't help, my friends will be dead. I started praying and a miracle 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
A German major asked Opdyke to take a job as a housekeeper in his new villa. 
She accepted the job and her Jewish friends hid there for nearly 8 months. 
Sometimes they hid in the attic; sometimes in the basement. They also 
discovered a tunnel that led from the house to a small hiding space underneath 
the gazebo in the back yard, where they hid when the officer held large 
functions in his home. 
</P>
<P>
But they were not always careful in the huge villa. Halfway through the 8 
months, the German major came home unexpectedly and found four of the Jewish 
women helping Opdyke in the kitchen. Terrified that her friends would lose 
their lives, Opdyke pleaded with him not to turn them in. 
</P>
<P>
"He put me in his lap and said 'I will keep your secret, but you have to be 
mine. Give an old man his last joy in his life.' I had to do what he said. 
There were too many lives at stake," Opdyke said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Righteous Gentile' 
</P>
<P>
All 12 of her friends survived the Holocaust and in 1982, the Israeli Holocaust 
Commission honored Opdyke as a "righteous Gentile." She is one of only 5,000 
people to be so honored and the only "righteous Gentile" living in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish Home for the Aged administrators said they have a special obligation to 
care for Opdyke's husband, suffering from the advanced stages of Alzheimer's 
disease, because of the sacrifices she made for the Jewish people. 
</P>
<P>
"She risked her life and this is the return we want to give her," said Dena 
Schulman, spokeswoman for the home. 
</P>
<P>
Blumenthal said: "We feel very privileged to have an opportunity to help. You 
can never do enough for this woman." 
</P>
<P>
Opdyke said she has heard many horror stories about nursing homes and was very 
worried about finding good care for her ailing husband, whom she married in 
1956, shortly after arriving in the United States. She is pleased that the 
Jewish Home for the Aged is willing to break their rules to admit him. 
</P>
<P>
"I love him, and I want him to have the best. Who but the Jewish people, who 
understand suffering so much, would be able to care for him so well," she said.

28 YOUNG PEOPLE ARRESTED AT 'FOUR-KEGGER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA LUTHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty-eight young people were arrested Saturday night at a Fountain Valley 
industrial park just as a so-called "drop party" was getting started, police 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Mike Hanrahan said police heard about the party Friday from Fountain Valley 
High School officials, who found a flyer that had been circulating among 
students. The flyer advertised the "four-kegger" party planned for a fenced 
industrial area at Kalama River and Mount Shay streets in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Hanrahan said about 250 young people had shown up by 8:36 p.m. Saturday when 
six officers also arrived and began making arrests. Those arrested were trapped 
inside the chain-link fence. 
</P>
<P>
"The fence worked out nicely," Hanrahan said. 
</P>
<P>
Police told the rest in the crowd who had not yet gone inside the fenced area 
to leave, Hanrahan said. 
</P>
<P>
Hanrahan said he was unsure of the origin of the name "drop party" but thought 
it might have come from the method of operation of the party's organizers, who 
"drop" into an industrial area with kegs of beer and music and then charge for 
admission. 
</P>
<P>
The youths arrested Saturday were booked for trespassing. All but eight were 
juveniles. One of those arrested also was charged with violating city noise 
ordinances -- Hanrahan said he was in charge the sound equipment set up for the 
party -- and another youth was charged with furnishing false information to a 
police officer. 
</P>
<P>
Hanrahan said police are becoming concerned about "drop parties," which he said 
appeared to be on the increase -- because beer usually is provided. After some 
of the parties, police find huge numbers of empty beer cups, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"When we get that many people consuming that much beer, we're going to have 
drunk-driving accidents," Hanrahan said.

Police in Anaheim on Sunday said that they are familiar with the phenomenon of 
"drop parties" among juveniles in their area. 
</P>
<P>
"We're familiar with that kind of party, but we call them 'keggers,' " said 
Anaheim police Sgt. David Severson. "It's against the law for people to buy 
beer for a private party and then charge admission, so we can usually arrest 
people on that. 
</P>
<P>
"Those parties can be very bad because there's no one there to supervise or see 
how intoxicated people are getting."

SHADOW ON O.C.'S JOPLIN CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Gov. George Deukmejian wants to see how his plan to cut the budget for 
juvenile and rehabilitation-related programs will hurt communities and young 
people who need help turning away from a life of crime, he need look no further 
than Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's plan to cut $36.8 million in juvenile funds would take $2.9 
million away from Orange County. There is no way the county can make up that 
loss. And the only way it can absorb the drastic cut is to close one of its 
three minimum-security youth camps -- probably the 35-year-old Joplin Youth 
Center -- in addition to making severe cutbacks to about eight community 
organizations that provide shelter, treatment and rehabilitation to thousands 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
The Joplin Center, located in the foothills of Trabuco Canyon, is an outdoor, 
ranch-type facility that annually gives about 300 teen-age boys, mostly gang 
members, an opportunity to turn their lives around before they become 
irreversibly involved in gang and criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
At the Joplin camp, the youths attend school for half a day and work the other 
half. They live in barracks in a rural setting, not an institutional 
environment, that provides family therapy, one-on-one counseling and a 
neutral-turf atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Without the camp, juvenile officials will be forced to house young offenders in 
the already- overcrowded Juvenile Hall or refer them to the California Youth 
Authority for detention. Either choice would place them in contact with more 
violent and crime-prone youths and would be more costly. 
</P>
<P>
The other alternative is to release the young offenders, denying them the 
opportunity to break away from their environment and gang influences. On the 
street they would also lose the camp's counseling and neutral environment that 
so often makes the difference between rehabilitation and more serious 
encounters with police and the juvenile justice system. 
</P>
<P>
Juvenile arrests in Orange County run about 16,000 a year. That figure is 13% 
of the total number of people arrested. Most juveniles are not held in custody. 
But of those who are, seven of every 10 stay out of trouble and do not return 
to the juvenile system system, because of sound rehabilitation programs and 
places like the Joplin Center. 
</P>
<P>
County officials have asked the governor to reconsider the state cuts in the 
juvenile budget. He should. If he doesn't, it will be up to the Legislature to 
restore them and then override the governor if he vetoes its action. 
</P>
<P>
The state may be facing a tight budget year, but the counties have even less 
leeway to maneuver within their budget restraints. Budget adoption always 
involves tough priority decisions. But diverting juvenile funds that could 
redirect some teen-agers away from a life of crime and save taxpayers 
incalculable future costs in dollars and social ills is penny wise and pound 
foolish.

<P>
Cal State Fullerton went to the spread offense Sunday and got a 12-6 victory 
over UC Irvine in a Big West Conference baseball game at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans had six players with at least two hits, five players with at least 
two runs batted in, and four players scored at least two runs. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton got RBI singles from Rich Gonzales and Mate Borgogno to take a 2-0 
lead in the second. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Mayne, playing with a hip pointer from a slide in Friday's 5-3 loss to 
Irvine, singled to open the third. Rod Klopfer and Gonzales later had RBI 
singles and Dave Ayala and Borgogno drove in runs with fielder's choices and 
Fullerton led, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Mayne singled to open the fourth and Rex Peters followed with his 
conference-leading 20th double to put runners on second and third. Klopfer had 
a one-out single to score both and Fullerton led, 8-0. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Staton hit his conference-leading 16th home run with a man on in the 
eighth to cap Fullerton's scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Borgogno, Mayne, Peters, Klopfer, Gonzales and Ayala had two hits each. Klopfer 
had three RBIs and Borgogno, Staton, Gonzales and Ayala had two RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Peters and Klopfer scored three times each and Mayne and Staton twice. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Ramirez had an RBI double in the seventh to extend his hitting streak to 
15 games for Fullerton, which defeated Irvine, 11-5, Saturday. Irvine (17-31-1 
overall, 3-12 in conference play) won the series-opener Friday, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Johnson (4-6) pitched the first seven innings for the victory. Jeff Haack 
(1-7) lasted two-plus innings, allowing six runs, five earned, to take the 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
Osmar DeChavez and Jim Kohler had two hits each for Irvine. DeChavez had a 
two-run double in the seventh for Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The victory moves third-place Fullerton (29-20, 9-6) one game ahead of Las 
Vegas, which lost to second-place Fresno State, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans now spend the final two weekends of the regular season against the 
conference leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton plays host to first-place Long Beach Friday and Saturday at 7 p.m. 
and Sunday at 1 p.m. Fullerton ends the conference season at Fresno State.

SELLING THE CAR DEALERS; 
</P>
<P>
CHANGES PREDICTED IN WAY AUTOS ARE ADVERTISED, SOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Charles Tighe, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's an image ingrained in your mind, particularly if you watch much late-night 
television. There he is, with his bad suit and slick spiel, waving a fistful of 
dollars and promising you the deal of the century on the car of your dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Do you believe him? No. Do you frequent his car dealership? Probably. For in 
the public's view, there's not much choice. One car dealer is just as pushy and 
uncaring as the next, you think. 
</P>
<P>
But with predictions that the car sales boom of the '80s may be ending and the 
value of the customer increasing, Jeremy Anwyl sees an opportunity to improve 
the image of dealers and revolutionize the way cars are advertised and sold. 
</P>
<P>
Anwyl is president of USP Automotive Advertising in Irvine, one of the largest 
agencies in the nation to specialize in car dealer advertising. Since he 
started USP in 1979, Anwyl, now 33, has built a client list of more than 60 
dealers across the country. Ad billings are expected to top $20 million this 
year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
While dealers traditionally have tried to lure customers by advertising the 
lowest prices, Anwyl creates themes for his clients that will build customer 
trust and loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
This year, shortly before state investigators made allegations of false 
advertising at Wilson Ford in Huntington Beach, USP client McLean Cadillac 
began a print ad campaign entitled, "How to Know When You've Been Had by an 
Ad." The series described techniques often used by dealers to get a quick sale, 
and it instructed the consumer to be informed. 
</P>
<P>
Anwyl, who was born in England and moved to the United States in 1973, recently 
talked with Times staff writer John Charles Tighe about declining sales at 
dealerships, the chronically tarnished image of dealers, and changes he 
foresees in the way cars will be sold in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Car sales have been slow so far this year, and there has been a tremendous 
increase in the supply of cars on dealer lots. What does this mean for dealers? 
</P>
<P>
A. A lot of dealers are losing money. We're heading into a real crunch, and 
it's going to get worse. I don't think manufacturers know what to do about it, 
and I don't think a lot of dealers know what to do about it. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How many dealers are losing money? 
</P>
<P>
A. It varies by market, but in Southern California, and in Orange County, about 
30% are losing money. They're totally in the red, even taking in the operations 
of the service department, which usually is a major profit center. 
</P>
<P>
Q. A lot of manufacturers are offering dealer incentives. Are these working? 
</P>
<P>
A. They're not working as well as they used to. And they can't keep offering 
these incentives. 
</P>
<P>
Q. General Motors has developed an extensive dealer improvement plan that 
requires higher sales levels from its dealers. Is this another kind of an 
incentive? 
</P>
<P>
A. That's a disincentive plan. They punish you, but they don't give you a 
reward. It's a sign of frustration. I know of a lot of manufacturers who are 
really frustrated with their dealer bodies right now. I feel a lot of empathy 
for the manufacturers because their future really is in the dealers' hands. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What are the manufacturers' frustrations? 
</P>
<P>
A. They are frustrated with the fact that customers are not being taken care of 
the way they would if the customer dealt directly with the factory. The 
manufacturers can create the product, but they have no control over what 
happens after the car leaves the factory. 
</P>
<P>
In its ads, the car maker tries to create a quality image of its cars, for 
dependability or comfort or style or performance. The manufacturer is 
emphasizing to the buyer that it is making a car pleasurable to him. But the 
dealer for years has been advertising his impossibly low price, and his $1 over 
invoice sale. Often the dealer's advertising negates the image that the factory 
is trying to create. And the sales experience on the car lot is not positive. 
</P>
<P>
There are exceptions. I think Acura and Mercedes dealers do a pretty good job 
as far as really making the customer feel he's important. But most do not. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What do dealers need to do to improve their image? 
</P>
<P>
A. They need to create their own image, and not with price advertising. Price 
is a reason to buy a Chevrolet versus a Rolls-Royce. But the customer isn't 
going to perceive that one dealer is less expensive than another. The dealers 
are paying the same for their cars. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What image should dealers have? 
</P>
<P>
A. It should be like a department store's image. People choose to go to 
Nordstrom or the Broadway or another store because of the store's image, 
whether it be for service or style or selection, but not price. A car dealer 
should be the same way. 
</P>
<P>
I'm talking about developing loyalty, which at most dealers is non-existent. 
The manufacturers are frustrated with declining customer loyalty that has been 
created by the dealers. I think the dealers need to recognize that for them to 
succeed, the loyalty should be to them, and not to the manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Why don't consumers have loyalty to a dealer? 
</P>
<P>
A. Primarily they don't have loyalty because dealers have never given customers 
any reason to be loyal. Why go back to the dealer you did business with before? 
You probably didn't like that experience, so why will you like the next time 
around any better? When you want to go buy a car, is it something you look 
forward to doing? It's not. 
</P>
<P>
You want to find out about dealer image, ask anyone on the street. The dealer 
does not really like talking about it. In my view they have no one to blame but 
themselves. Look at the advertising for 40 years, and how could you expect 
anybody to respond to that in a positive way? If you treat the customer with no 
respect, it's going to be that way. It's not that dealers are bad guys. They 
have simply been doing business the same way for years, and nobody has ever 
presented them with viable options. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What types of ads work well at building the loyalty image? 
</P>
<P>
A. One of the things we've been doing is the use of emotion, trying to make the 
car-buying process come off as an enjoyable experience. We do that a lot with 
music, using a popular sound for the market we're after, and then on a 
subliminal level we're selling with the association between that music and the 
person putting on the commercial. 
</P>
<P>
And we convey the emotion in the theme. With McLean Cadillac it's "We'll make 
you look good." If you buy a Cadillac, the car will make you look good. But on 
a non-visual level, the fact that you bought it there will make you look good 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
With Mossy Nissan in San Diego, the theme is "Mossy moves you." And with Moon 
Nissan in Cerritos, it's "We're making it happen for you." The theme is not as 
important as how you back it up in the ad and at the dealership. 
</P>
<P>
Q. If dealers are going to change the way they advertise, aren't they also 
going to have to change the way they operate? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes, the dealership must change. If they don't, then the advertising would 
backfire. For instance, McLean Cadillac is located in the heart of the 
Tustin-Irvine area, which is full of families. Cadillac traditionally has been 
purchased by an older market and sold by older sales people. We're advertising 
McLean for a young buyer, and so a lot has been done at the dealership to 
relate to that market. McLean's managers are far more progressive than at most 
Cadillac stores, and the sales staff is younger. When young people go into 
McLean, they're going to relate to the business. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What else does the dealer need to be doing to improve image? 
</P>
<P>
A. The dealer should be in the business of taking down barriers to the sale. 
Financing is a barrier, finding the car with the colors and options you 
actually want is a barrier. And knowing what to do with a trade-in or where you 
can get a good deal on insurance, these are barriers. In most cases, dealers 
have made it more difficult, not less difficult, to go through all these 
things. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Does the negotiating process that typically takes place on the lot make car 
buying a more difficult experience? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think most people feel an obligation to negotiate. They don't want to pay 
full sticker price. And the dealer is convinced the customer will not let him 
make any money on the automobile. So the dealer wants to negotiate on 
everything and the customer always has his defenses up. That's not a good way 
to do business. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How could that be improved? 
</P>
<P>
A. If it were a much more up-front transaction where the dealer would say, "I 
need to make $1,500 on the sale of a new car, and I need to make $900 when I 
sell your car," I think the dealer might be surprised at how reasonable 
customers can be. Instead of the games, he could agree in an open atmosphere 
what a reasonable amount of money is. Whenever I buy a car, that's basically 
how I approach it. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How much money does the dealer need to be profitable? 
</P>
<P>
A. The dealer is going to want to make about a 10% gross profit, which is not a 
lot, considering all the interest costs he has. If he makes a 10% gross profit, 
the dealer is probably going to make, bottom line, about a percentage point, or 
a point and a half. 
</P>
<P>
Customers must recognize the dealer has to make a profit. But typical sales 
approaches don't convey this. When the dealer says he is selling the car at 
invoice, or under invoice, it creates the impression that something must be 
wrong with the invoice price. Customers aren't stupid. They realize that either 
the dealer is lying or he's making money somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Hasn't it made a lot of dealers successful? 
</P>
<P>
A. Only because the customer hasn't had a choice. If you're a dealer making 
$100,000 or $200,000 a month, why change? It's been pretty hard to go in to a 
guy making $200,000 a month and tell him that things are all wrong. Today it's 
real easy to go in because they're not making that money. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are the losses making dealers dramatically change the way they operate and 
advertise? 
</P>
<P>
A. They're changing the attitude that people walking into dealerships are 
replaceable. And the feeling that perhaps the sales outlook is getting worse, 
not better, creates a situation that if it's not outright panic, it's certainly 
a controlled panic. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How do dealers get away with this kind of treatment? 
</P>
<P>
A. The only way you can get away with it is in a controlled distribution of the 
product. The Ford store cannot sell you Chevrolet. If you buy a car, you buy it 
from a dealer. 
</P>
<P>
But this is going to change. The market is no longer going to be controlled. I 
think you're going to see a national chain move into the market. There is no 
reason why a public company can't come in and buy the cars from the dealers and 
resell them. If you're interested in a Toyota, a Hyundai, a Buick and a Ford 
you have to go to 4 different stores and deal with four different salespeople. 
If you could go to one place and see all those cars sitting there, you don't 
have to worry about any of those problems. 
</P>
<P>
Being successful will require a change in the way cars are sold. For somebody 
who will deliver to the consumer what he wants, the opportunity is tremendous. 
The biggest fortunes in the car business have yet to be made. I try to get 
people to be very optimistic about the changes coming to the industry because 
they are promising. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are the cars of the future also changing? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. In a few years, China will be a big exporter of cars. That's going to 
change the industry a great deal. It will be a few years, but it's going to 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What about the next year or so? Aren't there lots of new cars entering a 
market that might be shrinking? 
</P>
<P>
A. You have a lot of cars that aren't going to meet sales projections. Mazda is 
forecasting about 40,000 to 50,000 sales a year for its sporty Miata. I think 
it's an unreasonable expectation for that type of car. It's an excellent car. 
It's just that there's not that big a market, and there's competition. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What will happen in the luxury market when the Toyota Lexus and Nissan 
Infiniti luxury lines begin selling? 
</P>
<P>
A. It's pretty crowded already. I have higher expectations for the Infiniti 
than for the Lexus. I think the Infiniti is breaking some new ground. It's a 
different kind of a luxury car. It looks different, and I think it will be 
perceived in its own class. Lexus is trying a little too closely to follow the 
Mercedes-Benz. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What's the future for the newer companies like Hyundai? 
</P>
<P>
A. Talk to Hyundai dealers right now. Their gross profits are way, way off. 
Last July, with Hyundai sales it was like hitting a light switch. They really 
really dropped. It's interesting that the same pattern occurred in Canada. They 
had 2 years of just unbelievable sales, then they dropped off. Word of mouth 
about the product might have something to do with it. People are saying that 
maybe the car doesn't have the horsepower they would like, and so sales drop. 
</P>
<P>
Q. And Daihatsu? 
</P>
<P>
A. Their problem originally was that they didn't have an automatic. It's a 
high-quality car, but women are a large part of their market, and women want an 
automatic. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How are the American companies competing? 
</P>
<P>
A. They're all having troubles getting cars sold. They're solid companies, and 
I think they're going to do well in the middle end of the market. I don't think 
they're going to be able to do well in the low end, and I don't think they're 
going to be able to do real well in the high end.

The Vienna Chamber Ensemble, nine members of the Vienna Philharmonic directed 
by the orchestra's concertmaster Gerhart Hetzel, is the kind of ensemble that 
sets musical standards. At the Orange County Performing Arts Center on Friday, 
the 19-year-old group quickly established mastery of the ideal of chamber music 
-- civilized conversation among intimate, long-mutually supportive and 
forbearing friends.

Mozart's Divertimento No. 15 and Schubert's Octet in F were played. The program 
was sponsored by the Orange County Philharmonic Society. 
</P>
<P>
The group's heritage is "authentic Viennese style," and in trying to define 
that elusive concept, one observes that the playing was strong and muscular 
without being insistent or aggressive. There was sentiment without 
sentimentality, sweetness without cloying excess, yielding without 
capitulation. 
</P>
<P>
Individual voices emerged from the ensemble; they did not erupt or jostle for 
attention. And they continued the sense of musical line without unseemly breaks 
in dynamics or shape of phrasing. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, paired lines and ensemble playing were exquisitely judged in terms 
of reinforcing dynamics, color and expression. 
</P>
<P>
For all the polish, the seamless starts and unisons, the overall, shared 
nuances of color and interpretation, the music-making never lacked a sense of 
discovery or spontaneity. Clearly, such unanimity of approach and expression 
only can be achieved by a group that has played together for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
Individual players commanded attention nonetheless. Founder Hetzel, first 
violin, played with unpressured evenness and was able to carry sweetness into 
the heights, skating up long, arching lines without stumbling. 
</P>
<P>
Clarinetist Norbert Taeubl was a wonder, apparently needing no pauses for 
breath in steadily supported lines played without burrs or bites, and offering 
delicate dabs of color, dramatic lines of dialogue or responsive musical 
thoughts, as required. Horn players Franz Sollner and Volker Altman elicited 
ethereal pianissimos. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, there were some members of the audience in Segerstrom Hall who 
persisted in mood-shattering applause after every movement.

SOUTH COAST SYMPHONY ENDS SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY McQUILKIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The South Coast Symphony's abridged season came to a close Saturday night at 
Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa. And it ended on a rather strange note. 
</P>
<P>
It ended, to be precise, on a slightly sharp B natural. Emanating from an 
unknown source, the steady whistling sound was audible throughout most of the 
orchestra's performance of Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony. Only when the dynamics 
reached a mezzo forte or louder could one forget it. Otherwise it was 
distracting, unsettling, annoying, nerve racking. 
</P>
<P>
After the first movement, conductor John Larry Granger made an apologetic 
appeal to the bemused staff of the Robert Moore Theatre. After 5 minutes and no 
success, he capitulated and continued the performance. 
</P>
<P>
If one could tune out the obtrusion, one could hear an alert and eager 
orchestra both rhythmically taut and admirably precise, and very much in tune. 
The strings blended exquisitely at times, and the woodwinds -- the clarinets 
especially -- played with extraordinary polish. 
</P>
<P>
Granger made this a transparent Fifth Symphony; one had to admire his skill in 
bringing out the work's myriad details. 
</P>
<P>
These details, alas, failed to coalesce into a unified whole. Each moment 
seemed pleasant enough, but missing was any sense of dramatic continuity. 
</P>
<P>
Also missing was any feeling of spontaneity. Moreover, the low brass too often 
played too loudly, producing a biting, edgy sound. 
</P>
<P>
Before intermission, Anthony Plog delivered a dynamic account of Haydn's 
Trumpet Concerto. Generating a clear, focused and penetrating sound, the 
trumpeter brought solid virtuosity to the technical passages and intelligent 
lyricism to the melodic ones. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Haydn, Plog offered Purcell's short Sonata in D for Trumpet and 
Strings, which proved an effective vehicle for the ringing nobility of his 
upper range.

ALAIA'S LATE, LATE SHOW IS WELL WORTH THE WAIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAT McCOLL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PARIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A full 37 days after most Paris designers wrapped up their fall ready-to-wear 
shows, Azzedine Alaia finally presented his. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't ready earlier, he said. 
</P>
<P>
It's been that way with Alaia for several seasons now. Los Angeles retailers 
Charles Gallay and Tommy Perse of Maxfield, along with every other shop owner 
in the world who carries the Alaia label, make a second trip to Paris, just for 
him. (At an estimated additional cost from Los Angeles of at least $4,500 per 
season for first-class travel and hotel.) 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little frustrating," said Perse, who trimmed his budget this time by 
staying in Los Angeles and sending only one buyer to the Paris show. He usually 
sends a team of three, including himself. "But after all the moaning is over, 
I'll continue to do it. The clothes are fantastic. I want them in my store." 
</P>
<P>
This time, Alaia presented his collection in a glass-roofed warehouse that one 
day will be his design headquarters and boutique. 
</P>
<P>
In its present, unfinished state, a chill rain dripped through the cracks, 
showering press and buyers during the 1 1/2-hour wait before Thursday's event 
began. The models got wet, too, when they walked down the runway. 
</P>
<P>
At a second showing Friday, the audience included Tina Turner, wearing an 
olive-drab trench coat, black leather jeans, white bobby socks and black 
lace-ups; and ballet-turned-theater dancer Zizi Jeanmaire, wrapped in a pink 
silk Saint Laurent scarf, showing off her celebrated legs in pale sheer 
stockings. They fared better than Thursday's crowd, because the rain had 
stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Alaia is usually associated with sexy, clinging clothes, but this show began in 
a classic, almost subdued mood with to-the-knee Balenciaga-inspired cocoon 
coats in pristine white wool; serious white gabardine suits; and the longer 
redingote jackets that were everywhere in Paris collections this season. 
Alaia's version goes over narrow pleated trousers, leggings, clinging cyclist 
shorts or pleated Bermudas. 
</P>
<P>
Other redingotes topped his familiar body suits that outline every curve. 
Trench coats, another Alaia signature, were shiny, sensuous satin, and cut to 
three lengths: mid-thigh, at the knee or mid-calf. 
</P>
<P>
Other familiar themes were Alaia's seamed double-knit body dresses, this time 
with a new detail, a modified leg-of-mutton sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
For Late Day 
</P>
<P>
Two of the best looks in the collection were for late day. One was a bronze, 
Lurex and satin, off-the-shoulder blouse with matching cuffed shorts. Alaia 
paired it with black sheer stockings and high-heeled suede booties. The other 
outfit, his "smocking" suit, had a cutaway jacket with tails that bounced on a 
flouncy organza skirt. 
</P>
<P>
While he is often regarded as an artist beyond question who carves his clothes 
like sculpture, Alaia, working in this group, was not as remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
This collection lacked the usual perfect tailoring and was highly derivative. 
Much of the show consisted of the same few outfits, all of them similar to 
styles from earlier Alaia collections, repeated this time with only slight 
variations in color and fabric. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fans Didn't Mind 
</P>
<P>
His fans didn't seem to mind. Backstage, after the show, the diminutive 
designer -- he's under 5 feet tall -- all but disappeared under the crowd of 
well-wishers. But he reappeared in time to pose with Tina Turner for French TV 
cameras. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Gallay, and London's Joan Burstein of Brown's, said it was worth the 
trip. Burstein explained why she "puts up with" Alaia's eccentricities. "As 
soon as the merchandise arrives, it sells." 
</P>
<P>
Gallay added: "Because Alaia is true to himself, he's true to his customer." 
</P>
<P>
Maxfields' Perse explained that Alaia is no longer the only designer who 
requires special attention during buying seasons. He travels to Hamburg, 
Germany, twice a year, just to see the collections of Jil Sander. And to New 
York, primarily to buy the Matsuda label.

<P>
IN A WIDE-RANGING 'HERSTORY,' NOVELIST ALICE WALKER TAKES ON THE UNIVERSE; 
</P>
<P>
THE COLOR OF CONVICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANNE KLEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The caller from St. Louis, Mo., has just finished telling radio talk-show host 
Michael Jackson that he is proud to be white and that he is "tired of taking 
the rap and hearing their bull about how we owe 'em something." 
</P>
<P>
Then Alice Walker, the black author of "The Color Purple," suggests that the 
man actually read her latest novel, "The Temple of My Familiar." 
</P>
<P>
"You will see that I go to great lengths to prove that you and I have the same 
mother," she tells him. 
</P>
<P>
Her voice is quiet, unwavering, with a gentle lilt to it. She sounds as if she 
wants to relieve the caller of his anger. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, well . . . ," he says, momentarily flustered. "Everybody can have their 
beliefs on, um, hereditaries (sic) and spirits. I mean, nobody knows for sure 
on that. But, you know, I just don't like the put-downs (in the book) on how we 
got run out of Africa because of our pale skins . . . . I'm glad to be in 
America." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
She Doesn't Try to Offend 
</P>
<P>
And so is Alice Walker. 
</P>
<P>
It is a point that she makes repeatedly, in nearly every one of her public 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
She speaks, and writes, of racism, sexism, oppression and callousness. Her 
words are stark and raw, her emotions unfiltered. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't go around trying to offend (people)," she says in an interview later 
in her Beverly Hills hotel room. "But, in fact, I do have a particular history 
and a particular point of view. And I express that. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you feel loved by the universe," she says, pulling off her shoes and 
socks and then folding her knees close to her chest, "you're already accepted 
and you're not really concerned about offending people." 
</P>
<P>
That's the way it is with Walker, 45, widely regarded as America's premier 
black woman author, a gentle, impish woman with the same "reggae singer's 
locks" as one of the characters in her new novel. 
</P>
<P>
On first blush, she often shocks, then she will astound, but always she will 
move people. While some may be disquieted by what they see as her radical 
dogma, harsh and slightly kooky, others find her message inspirational. 
</P>
<P>
She is one with the universe, she says. And so are you. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't always have to be doing something," she says. "You can just be, and 
that's plenty." 
</P>
<P>
But being for Walker, these days and always, doesn't mean being idle. She 
writes -- poems, short stories, essays, children's books, biographies and 
novels -- and she marches -- to protest apartheid, the poisoning of the 
environment and to protect women's right to abortion, to name but a few of her 
causes. 
</P>
<P>
The latest expression of Walker's point of view can be found in "The Temple of 
My Familiar," released today by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. The novel, which 
Walker calls "a romance of the last 500,000 years," flutters in and out of the 
lives of three principal pairs of characters and, ultimately, weaves them all 
together. 
</P>
<P>
There's Suwelo, a middle-aged professor of history, and his former wife, Fanny, 
in search of herself and in love with spirits. Another pair is Arveyda, a rock 
star, and his Latin American wife, Carlotta. And then there's Miss Lissie, a 
woman of countless past lives, and her companion, Hal. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Celie and Shug, late of "The Color Purple," also put in appearances, as do 
a host of other characters, some of them speaking from as far back as primeval 
Africa. Parables, about everything from loss of innocence, to sexual 
exploitation, to geopolitics, are tossed about freely. Eons come and go in a 
few pages. 
</P>
<P>
Walker's voice, and her messages, come from the mouths of nearly all her 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that when you do something from your heart," she says, "you leave 
a heart print." 
</P>
<P>
Walker was in Los Angeles late last week on the first stop of a national tour 
to promote "The Temple of My Familiar," which has a first printing of 175,000 
copies, and which, like all her works, she first wrote in longhand -- often 
while sitting in bed. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to do it first in longhand. It's just more real, more organic, and I 
feel that I get to be with it more." 
</P>
<P>
Walker says she's never done a book tour, being a private person who likes to 
garden and putter around her Victorian house in San Francisco and not enamored 
of media hype or letting strangers poke around where they haven't been invited. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Criticism Can Sting 
</P>
<P>
Her partner of 11 years, writer Robert Allen, is making the trip with her. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really just checking it out," Walker says, "and I may not last, you know, 
because I get really tired easily. But I wanted to see what it was like." 
</P>
<P>
And how it was, in the beginning at least, was not entirely felicitous. 
</P>
<P>
The radio caller from St. Louis, for instance, was reacting to a Time magazine 
review that dismissed "The Temple of My Familiar" as "a novel of allegations," 
where the principal narrators "reveal themselves as dictators manque, people 
who believe that the truth is whatever they happen to say and who will tolerate 
no dissenting opinions." 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times, meanwhile, found the novel -- her first since "The Color 
Purple" -- ideologically tendentious and grating, with "the same feeling of 
over-ambition about it that one sees in a batter so determined to hit a home 
run that she swings before the ball is even pitched." 
</P>
<P>
Such criticism stings, of course, but doesn't appear to penetrate the spiritual 
core of Walker, a woman powered by her own convictions much like Shug is when 
she imparts The Gospel According to Shug in "The Temple of My Familiar." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it has much to do with me actually," Walker says of those who 
disparage her work. "I think it has more to do with how they feel when they 
read me, if they read me." 
</P>
<P>
She seems saddened, and mildly annoyed, that readers might focus on what she 
calls "quote messages" in "The Temple of My Familiar," and in the process, lose 
sight of the novel as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really think of myself as writing messages," she says. "I think that 
all I wanted to say is said by the total novel. I'd like (readers) to learn 
something about connection and something about feeling for the Earth and for 
the animals and trees and other human beings on the Earth. And I'd like them to 
enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like them not to feel defensive, not to feel that they are being attacked, 
not to feel anything but, you know, 'Here is a novel. It stretches over a great 
number of years. This may not be how I see the world, but this is how someone 
sees the world and it would be very nice to just give myself over as I read 
this book and feel whatever I feel without fear.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The Color Purple' 
</P>
<P>
If Walker herself has felt any fear of expression, it all but vanished after 
the phenomenal success of her 1982 novel "The Color Purple," which sold 4 
million copies, garnered the Pulitzer Prize and the American Book Award for 
fiction. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite different now," Walker says, breaking into a huge grin that peals 
off into a belly laugh. "It's very nice. I like it. I do. I do." 
</P>
<P>
And it was Steven Spielberg's movie adaptation of the novel, Walker 
acknowledges, that led millions of people to discover her as a writer. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how my family read me in the first place," she says. "They'd never read 
me. But when they saw the movie, they thought, 'Gee, there must be something to 
this.' . . . And what was important to me was being able to have a movie that 
would actually show in my hometown, Eatonton, Ga., population 4,000 . . . and 
would reach all of my readers who don't read, who can't read. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wonderful because . . . I think I really felt my first rush of happiness 
about the commercial success when someone told me that the people on the IRT 
subway in New York were reading it. Now that made me happy because I had ridden 
that subway from Brooklyn to Manhattan for many years myself and all the women 
-- mostly women reading, you know -- were reading these escape, romance novels. 
. . . And I used to think, 'Well, gee, I would like to write a book that would 
be so riveting that they would be reading it instead, and it would be about 
them.' " 
</P>
<P>
But Walker adds that even she was stunned at what she calls the "level of 
connection . . . the sheer this-is-my-story-ness" of the way people, men and 
women, reacted to "The Color Purple." 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, the men who have written to tell me, 'I am Celie,' and then they go on 
to tell me their story. And sure enough, you know, there are so many male 
Celies, who feel abused and who overcome. Because I hated that many people 
think it's about abuse and drudgery and sadness, when, in fact, it's about 
transcendence." 
</P>
<P>
As the protagonist of her own story, Walker has transcended beyond a life of 
rural poverty in central Georgia, where she was born the youngest of eight 
children to a sharecropper and his wife, who worked as a maid. 
</P>
<P>
With a state scholarship, Walker attended Spelman College in Atlanta and, from 
there, Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, N.Y. After college, she won a 
fellowship to Africa, where she traveled for a summer in Kenya and Uganda. Her 
first book of poems, "Once," was written there. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the States, Walker went home to Mississippi in the late 1960s to 
register voters, work for welfare rights and begin recording the stories of the 
people she met along the way. And it was during those seven years that she met 
and married Mel Leventhal, a civil rights lawyer. Their daughter, Rebecca 
Walker, now 19, is a history major at Yale. 
</P>
<P>
But it was long before womanhood that Walker began her odyssey inside her 
imagination. 
</P>
<P>
"My sister tells me this, and I think it's true. She says I used to always, 
from the time I was 2 or 3, talk to imaginary people and beings at length. And 
I think what that means to me now, as someone who, you know, still does that, 
who writes novels with these characters, it's just that I always did have a 
sense of connectedness to everything." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Started Writing Early 
</P>
<P>
By the time Walker was in fourth grade, she had started to write, keeping a 
notebook and writing poems. One of her favorite authors was the Russian 
novelist and social theorist, Count Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up on Tolstoy, and there's nobody more different from me than Tolstoy, 
one would think. A white, upper-class Russian man, and I love his work 
(because) it's true. And he has a real soul, and he's able to, you know, to 
care so deeply about issues and human beings, that he can get into them and 
really share his own feelings about them with the reader." 
</P>
<P>
Which is, of course, what Walker says she aims to do herself. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, it's a tragedy in a way that Americans are brought up to think that 
they cannot feel for other people and other beings just because they are 
different. They think they're different. It's very limiting." 
</P>
<P>
It was a similar shortsightedness, Walker believes, that caused the Academy of 
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to deny the movie version of "The Color 
Purple" even a single Oscar, despite 11 nominations. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they could accurately judge 'The Color Purple' because I frankly 
think they were intimidated by the controversy (about the film's portrayal of 
black men) . . . . If they had real integrity they would take a stand if they 
thought it was good. And the work was good." 
</P>
<P>
And Walker's latest work, too, is bound to engender controversy. It lays bare 
her own spiritual beliefs -- "Actually, my full title that I've given myself at 
this juncture is a 'pagan agnostic ecstatic,' " she says -- and it depicts God 
as a black African woman. 
</P>
<P>
"And that will be very good news for some, and very bad news for others," 
Walker says. "But it should be interesting."

AN 'ELLA' AWARD FOR ALL THAT JAZZ; 
</P>
<P>
SOCIETY BOWS TO FITZGERALD'S LIFETIME OF ACHIEVEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Ella Fitzgerald was holding court like a queen, but speaking like an old 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm feeling pretty good, thank you," she replied to an inquiry about her 
health (she had open-heart surgery in 1986). "The doctor gave me some therapy, 
and I go twice a week." 
</P>
<P>
Did she have a nice birthday on April 25? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yes. I sat at home, and people sent me flowers. I couldn't get off the 
phone!" 
</P>
<P>
Nor could she escape from fans who huddled around her chair at a 
reception/photo opportunity that preceded the Society of Singers tribute to the 
71-year-old Fitzgerald Friday night at the Beverly Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
They converged to honor her, the winner of the first "Ella" lifetime 
achievement award, and she welcomed them all, the friends, the fans, the 
flashbulbs. 
</P>
<P>
There is definitely an audience for jazz among young music lovers, said 
Fitzgerald. "We play lots of colleges and universities," she said, "and we mix 
the program up. It's not all bop. We do Cole Porter, Rogers and Hammerstein, a 
little rock and roll; jazz done in the beat of the day." 
</P>
<P>
She added that she was "thrilled" to be associated with the Society of Singers, 
a group founded to raise money to help singers in need of medical or other 
emergency care that eventually plans to build a permanent residence for 
singers. (The event was almost totally underwritten by Johnnie Walker Black, 
and net proceeds were estimated at $500,000.) 
</P>
<P>
Frank Sinatra is literally the chairman of the board of this organization; 
Ginny Mancini (wife of composer Henry) is the president and was the benefit 
coordinator along with Jeanne Hazard. 
</P>
<P>
"It was destined, it was honest, it was heartfelt, it was done without anything 
in its way," said Mancini of the decision to honor Fitzgerald. "It was 
unquestionable that she should be the one." 
</P>
<P>
"A Tisket A Tasket" was the first Fitzgerald song Mancini recalled hearing. 
"What I heard I had never experienced in a singer of a lyric," she said. "I 
can't define it for you. But I felt complete." 
</P>
<P>
Jazz singer Joe Williams said his association with Fitzgerald has gone from "an 
admirer to a devotee to an absolute slave. She's marvelous. God, she's 
unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Although the room became crowded quickly, it soon became a jazz lover's dream. 
In the crowd were Mel Torme, Bea Wain, Kitty Kallen, Kar Starr, members of the 
Manhattan Transfer and George Shearing. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some wondered where the next generation of singers were. 
</P>
<P>
"Look around," said Kallen. "Where are the young ones? Where are the Linda 
Ronstadts, the Michael Jacksons? Who's going to take the mantle? Yes, they're 
making money now, but they don't realize how many singers died in county 
hospitals." 
</P>
<P>
The "young ones" missed out on a tremendous show, with everyone dedicating 
their performances to Fitzgerald. The capacity crowd couldn't help singing 
along with Kallan, Wain, Starr, Martha Tilton, Fran Warren, Helen O'Connell, 
Helen Forrest and the Sentimentalists, who performed signature songs from their 
tables. 
</P>
<P>
There was more singing from Williams, Marilyn McCoo, Dionne Warwick, the 
Manhattan Transfer, a tap performance by Arthur Duncan and jazz piano from 
Shearing, who also accompanied Torme. He earned a standing ovation for "A 
Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square." Backing everyone up was the Capp/Pierce 
Juggernaut Band. 
</P>
<P>
Said emcee Bill Cosby after hearing the female big-band singers, "I don't 
understand -- we're raising money to build a home. For what? They need a place 
to work." 
</P>
<P>
The audience heartily agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Scattered among the tables were more luminaries: Barbra Streisand, Quincy Jones 
(honorary chairmen along with Luciano Pavarotti, who didn't attend), Clint 
Eastwood, Maj. Ronald Ferguson (the Duchess of York's father), Carol Bayer 
Sager and Burt Bacharach, Gloria Loring, Helen Reddy, Pat Boone, Gloria and 
Jimmy Stewart, Mayor Tom Bradley, Danny Thomas, Cyd Charisse and Tony Martin, 
Lainie Kazan. 
</P>
<P>
Eastwood presented the award to Fitzgerald, who apologized for her nervousness. 
"All of you singers can understand how you can get nervous at such an 
occasion," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She accepted the award "for all of the great singers everywhere. This is not 
just for me alone. It's for those who are trying to become something, and for 
those who have fallen down by the byway." She paused. "By God, I'm trying to 
make a speech and it's the worst." 
</P>
<P>
But the greatest present of all wasn't the award, wasn't the fact that the 
singers were invited on stage at the end to sing "Dream" and "Happy Birthday To 
You." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald was persuaded to sing "Honeysuckle Rose." And that was the best gift 
of all.

ARCHITECT GEHRY NAMED PRITZKER PRIZE LAUREATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM HALL KAPLAN, Times Design Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Architect Frank O. Gehry of Santa Monica, who has earned a worldwide reputation 
for his idiosyncratic designs, has been selected as this year's Pritzker Prize 
Laureate. Announcement of Gehry's selection will be made today. 
</P>
<P>
The international prize consisting of a $100,000 grant and other perks is 
considered architecture's most prestigious honor. It is funded by the Hyatt 
Foundation and awarded annually by an independent jury to a living architect. 
</P>
<P>
Gehry is the sixth American to receive the prize, which was founded in 1979 as 
the equivalent to the Nobel Prize. Among the other winners have been Philip 
Johnson, in 1979, I. M. Pei, in 1983, and Richard Meier, in 1984, who at 
present is designing the Getty Cultural Center planned for Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
Cited in the award are a variety of projects the 60-year-old Gehry has designed 
in Los Angeles. These include his own home in Santa Monica, the Aerospace 
Museum in Exposition Park, the Temporary Contemporary in Little Tokyo, the 
Frances Howard Goldwyn Library in Hollywood, and the Loyola Law School near 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
After an intense international competition, Gehry was recently given the 
commission to design the Walt Disney Concert Hall for the Music Center. Gehry 
believes that the hall, with a projected cost in excess of $100 million, will 
be a hallmark in his career, which he describes as at a critical midpoint. 
</P>
<P>
The jury's formal citation said: "Refreshingly original and totally American, 
proceeding as it does from his populist Southern California perspective, Gehry 
work is a highly refined, sophisticated and adventurous aesthetic that 
emphasizes the art of architecture." 
</P>
<P>
The jury noted that "his sometimes controversial, but always arresting body of 
work, has been variously described as iconoclastic, rambunctious and 
impermanent." It is "this restless spirit that has made his buildings a unique 
expression of contemporary society and its ambivalent values," the jury added. 
</P>
<P>
Gehry has often said in interviews that his odd-angled, sculpted buildings 
featuring such materials as chain link, plywood and sheet metal were metaphors 
of Los Angeles, a reflection of the city's fractured context. 
</P>
<P>
"If it is ugly it is because the city is ugly," Gehry said recently. But he has 
softened the remark on occasion by stating that if given a proper budget he 
could be elegant. "I just try to make the best with the reality of things." 
</P>
<P>
Gehry said in an interview that he saw the award as a sort of recognition of 
architecture's need to continue to look toward the future and take risks. 
</P>
<P>
"In that respect, we in Los Angeles are quite well located, sitting as we do 
between the old east (the East Coast and Europe) and its classical sense of 
order, and the new west (Japan and Asia) and its very different sense of 
order." He suggested that his architecture reflects the collision of those 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
The jury is headed by J. Carter Brown, director of the National Gallery of Art 
in Washington, and includes industrialist Giovanni Agnelli, chairman of Fiat, 
author and critic Ada Louise Huxtable, architects Ricardo Legorreta and Kevin 
Roche and investor Jacob Roths-child of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
The Loyola Law School, a collage of engagingly raw structures cited in the 
award, is located in the Pico-Union neighborhood southwest of downtown, where 
Gehry lived with his family after they moved from his native Toronto in 1947. 
He attended the School of Architecture at nearby USC, graduating in 1954. He 
also attended the Harvard Graduate School of Design in 1956, and at various 
times worked for the local firms of Victor Guren, and Pereira and Luckman, 
before setting up his own practice in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
"Having won the Pritzker no doubt will be helpful to me in the design decisions 
that still have to be made concerning the Disney, and in other projects I will 
be involved in," said Gehry, with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Gehry says he tends to think like an artist, having been influenced by such 
local artists as Billy Al Bengston and Ed Moses, and approaches each building 
"as a sculptural object, a spatial container, a space with light and air, a 
response to context and appropriateness of feeling and spirit." 
</P>
<P>
Gehry said he is also very much the pragmatist, concerning himself with the 
specific needs of the client. In particular, he takes exception to the charge 
that his buildings are different for the sake of being different. "I try to 
make my buildings humanistic, not repetitious, fit budgets and please the 
clients." Gehry said. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting singular designs of projects by Gehry over the years have defied 
easy categorization. His buildings have been labeled Modernist, Post-Modernist, 
Deconstructivist and Punk, blurring as they do the traditional lines between 
art, architecture and kitsch. "If you have to give me a label, make it 
optimist," said Gehry. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1967 Gehry has won more than 25 local, state and national awards from the 
American Institute of Architects, along with a host of other awards and 
professional honors. 
</P>
<P>
Gehry will be presented the prize, along with a medallion, in ceremonies later 
this month in Nara, Japan, at the Todai-Ji Buddhist Temple, which was 
originally constructed in the 8th Century.

Real life and drama will merge again this week when 29 homeless people take on 
screen extra roles on Thursday's episode of "L.A. Law." One of the themes of 
the episode centers on the problems of the homeless in Los Angeles. 
Arrangements to use actual homeless people on the show were made with the 
Sunlight Mission of Santa Monica and with Hope Is Helping agency, a Beverly 
Hills-based organization that shelters, feeds and rehabilitates the homeless. 
"L.A. Law" producer Scott Goldstein said the casting provided a way to "help 
some people very quickly and with some dignity." Claudia Puig

A Finnish collector and Beatles fan bought a ticket to ride in the style of the 
Fab Four when he bid $234,000 at Christie's for a white Mercedes Benz limousine 
that belonged to late Beatle John Lennon. The four-door, black-seated 
limousine, custom built for Lennon in 1970, later belonged to fellow Beatle 
George Harrison before being sold to Mary Wilson, an original member of the 
Supremes pop group. Two hand-written verses of a poem by Lennon, illustrated 
with a sketch, netted $5,450. A rainbow-colored 1965 Bentley automobile that 
once ferried John Lennon and the other Beatles through the streets of London 
also goes on the auction block in June. The car, now owned by a New York 
couple, is expected to fetch between $800,000 and millionClaudia Puig

The widows of several crew members aboard the Challenger space shuttle say they 
are upset about plans by ABC to make a three-hour television movie about the 
accident, the Associated Press reported. Loran Onizuka, widow of Challenger 
astronaut Ellison Onizuka, and Jane Smith, widow of Challenger pilot Michael 
Smith, and their attorney have talked to George Englund, executive producer and 
writer of the ABC drama, in an effort to get him to drop the project. "Why do 
we have to relive this? Why don't they leave it alone? If it is going to be 
done at all, it should be done as a very serious documentary," said Smith. 
Producer Englund, however, said the project to tell the story of the seven 
astronauts who died in the Jan. 28, 1986, accident will continue: "The most 
honorable thing I can say is that my hopes and wishes are that it will be 
accurate." Englund said the cast has not been selected and a start date for the 
production has not been set. But he hopes to film the entire movie in the 
vicinity of the Johnson Space Center south of Houston. June Scobee, the widow 
of Challenger commander Francis (Dick) Scobee, talked with Englund for purposes 
of script research. But Englund would not say whether the families of 
Challenger astronauts Judith Resnik and Gregory Jarvis or schoolteacher Christa 
McAuliffe talked with him. Claudia Puig

Unconfirmed reports say that the Los Angeles Philharmonic will today announce 
the appointment of Wayne Shilkret as executive director of the Hollywood Bowl, 
upon the departure of current general manager Robert Harth. Shilkret will 
report to Philharmonic Managing Director Ernest Fleischmann. As executive 
director of the Ambassador International Cultural Foundation -- sponsor of 
concerts at Ambassador Auditorium and other major local halls -- for the past 
12 years, Shilkret, 55, has long been Fleischmann's only major rival in 
Southland impresario ranks. He will reportedly take over the job at the 
Hollywood Bowl -- which Fleischmann has run since 1969, but in recent years 
with strong assistance from Harth -- next spring. Harth is leaving the 
Philharmonic after the 1989 Bowl season to become president of the Aspen Music 
Festival in Colorado. Both Fleischmann and Shilkret were unavailable for 
comment this weekend. Claudia Puig

GUY'S FANS TOO EASY TO PLEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guy got away with murder Saturday at the sold-out Universal Amphitheater in the 
first of the night's two shows. 
</P>
<P>
This R&amp;B/dance unit hoodwinked the audience, which was loaded with swooning 
females in their late teens. Fronted by lead singer Aaron Hall, Damian Hall and 
producer Teddy Riley, Guy put on a show that was all flash and no substance. 
But it was such a slick con job that the audience didn't know what hit them. 
</P>
<P>
These guys know that to please the female teen crowd in concert you have to be 
slender, well-muscled and a good dancer, and be backed by a band that can 
provide powerful dance rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
How about competent singing? Obviously not necessary. Aaron Hall's sloppy 
vocals certainly didn't turn Saturday's crowd off. 
</P>
<P>
Riley, a bona fide studio wizard at 21, deserves credit for masterminding Guy's 
album, which has sold nearly 1 1/2 million. He's tapped into a sound that turns 
the young black audience on. But he and his colleagues in Guy haven't found a 
way to translate that sound to the stage. Apparently there's no hurry. 
Audiences seem to be quite satisfied with that diet of flash Guy is serving up. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of pulling the wool over an audience's eyes, rapper M. C. Hammer -- 
sandwiched in between Guy and short sets by Today and Kid 'n Play -- is a 
capable con man, too. He gave the audience lots of noise and glitz -- including 
go-go dancers and smoke machines -- laced with racy movements and sexy chatter. 
</P>
<P>
On his records, Hammer is a passable rapper, but amid all that noisy 
accompaniment, most of his lyrics were unintelligible. But when a good-looking, 
well-built, high-stepping rapper is cavorting in front of an audience of 
rapturous female teens, the last thing on their minds is lyrics. DENNIS HUNT

LEE REMICK WAKES UP TO TRAVELER'S WORST NIGHTMARE IN 'DARK HOLIDAY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Dark Holiday" is the ultimate traveler's nightmare and a compelling female 
counterpart to the hit movie "Midnight Express." The Turkish tourist industry 
better hire a lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the true story of American tourist Gene LePere's shocking 
incarceration in a Turkish prison, this NBC movie (tonight, Channel 4, 9-11 
p.m.) brings stature to the lurid genre of the women's prison movie. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Remick is a prim American vacationer who asks her Turkish tourist guide if 
it's OK to wander on her own among some Roman ruins. "This is a civilized 
country," the guide assures her. "You're perfectly safe." Among the stone 
ruins, intimidated by vendors, Remick buys some figurines that turn out to be 
antiquities and she's arrested for attempted smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
Rose Leiman Goldemberg's taut teleplay (based on LePere's book, "Never Pass 
This Way Again," recounting her 1983 internment in Turkey) owes nothing to such 
smellers as "Women in Cages" and "Women in Chains." Indeed, the stark imagery 
of "Dark Holiday" recalls the dungeon world of the 1978 hit "Midnight Express." 
</P>
<P>
Director Lou Antonio and several Turkish-speaking actresses create broiling 
prison scenes that suggest festering rats in a nest. Flashes of camaraderie are 
not sentimental. 
</P>
<P>
The production's flash point is an electrifying supporting performance by a 
striking actress named Shanit Keter, whose scabrous inmate is ripe with danger. 
</P>
<P>
Remick's numb dismay turns to burnished determination. Her blonde hair, like a 
flag, signals the innocent abroad.

'ALICE' A FEMINIST REVUE WITHOUT THE OUTRAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, Times Theater Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oh, no! Not another feminist revue, Alice! Please say it isn't so! 
</P>
<P>
That might be one's first reaction to the nomenclature -- "feminist revue" -- 
but "A . . . My Name Is Alice," which opened Saturday at the Old Globe's 
Cassius Carter Centre Stage, is more winning than its English primer title. 
</P>
<P>
It has class and a decidedly optimistic (if slightly diffused) point of view, 
delivered by a sum total of 28 savvy contributors (from Amanda McBroom to Steve 
Tesich) and a director who understands the value of restraint (Julianne Boyd). 
</P>
<P>
Boyd and film maker Joan Micklin Silver ("Crossing Delancey") originally 
conceived of "Alice" as a response to the more militant feminist outbursts of 
the angrier 1960s. They took their time to collect their material and pare the 
show down to size, assembling and disassembling this collage of songs and 
scenes, until they had it the way they wanted it. That was 1983. In its present 
form, "Alice" is about many aspects of being female -- good and bad -- in a 
world populated by men and other creatures, all given their due. 
</P>
<P>
And it doesn't gripe. 
</P>
<P>
Au contraire. Upbeat is the name of this game. If "Alice" can be chided for 
anything, it would be for managing to remain inoffensive. It has its occasional 
cliches (yet another sketch or two set in the confessional of the beauty 
parlor) and its sentimental indulgences (as in a daughter's song to the mother 
she feels she has failed, or the sisters who learn to appreciate one another 
rather late in life). But these are bracketed by enough bracing self-mockery, 
good humor, keen observation and plain fun to serve as appropriate and even 
welcome pace-changers. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of the show's success rests with the five performers in charge: the 
quizzical Roo Brown, brash young Rozz Morehead, hip Susan Mosher, elegant 
Michele Pawk and big-voiced and big-hearted Avery Sommers. Each is distinct, 
talented and unstereotyped. 
</P>
<P>
At about two hours with an intermission, the performers riff through "Alice," 
moving with ease from the wistful ("At My Age," wherein an inexperienced 
18-year-old and a widow-of-a-certain-age share counterpoint tribulations about 
the trials of blind dates) to the sly ("I Like the Boys," says Morehead in a 
celebration of the gentler, kinder elements in the opposite sex), to the 
out-and-out parodies of a kindergarten teacher-parent conference (Brown and 
Pawk) and a macho all-female basketball team ("Good Sports"). 
</P>
<P>
The Act One finale, "Bluer Than You," is an artful lesson in how to top the 
other person at feeling sorry for yourself ("My man called me such terrible 
names . . ." -- "Your Man speaks to you?" or "When I get up in the morning . . 
. " -- "You can get up in the morning?"). 
</P>
<P>
It goes on like this, with the second half serving up more of the same and 
hitting such familiar locales as a male strip joint ("Pretty Young Men") and 
the inevitable psychiatric clinic ("Honeypot," raised a couple of notches by 
Sommers' joyously sexual performance). Along the way we go through the 
seemingly unrelated but amusing vamping of a German-born French chanteuse 
(Pawk) and Morehead's rousing declaration of independence when she tells her 
decamping boy-friend that parting as enemies beats the dickens out of parting 
as friends. 
</P>
<P>
A delectable leitmotif that repeats throughout the evening is the reading of 
poems by Brown "from my collection, 'For Women Only.' " The poems change, but 
their hilarious awfulness doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
Cliff Faulkner has designed a simple platform set, simply lit by John B. 
Forbes. But "Alice" is not about settings or costumes (by Shigeru Yaji). It is 
about lampooning at its merriest and mildest. 
</P>
<P>
"Alice" lacks the outrage satire requires. And even though the show is only six 
years old, its targets are beginning to feel worn. They were predictable to 
start with and have since been hit by others. What this production has going 
for it chiefly is quality -- in the performers and in the distinction of the 
individual sketches. 
</P>
<P>
In this sense, "Alice" is everything that the long-running "Six Women With 
Brain Death or Expiring Minds Want to Know" aspires to be but isn't. You can't 
rise much above written material any more than you can sink too far below it. 
Saturday night's spontaneous ovation for "Alice" partially at least attests to 
that. A final word of commendation: Musicians James Raitt and Gary Scott are 
terrific. 
</P>

Arts in Balboa Park, Tuesdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays 7 p.m., with 
matinees Saturdays and Sundays at 2. Until June 11. Tickets: $20.50-27.50;

'LOVERBOY': HOLD THE PIZZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, Times Film Critic 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When bad things happen to good people, the result is "Loverboy," which opened 
citywide Friday with no press previews. In it, Patrick Dempsey plays a 
disingenuous college boy who, instead of working for $4.80 an hour delivering 
pizzas on his summer vacation, makes $200 an afternoon delivering warmth, 
understanding, tenderness and wildly unsafe sex to every unhappily married 
woman in greater Los Angeles. The password? Extra anchovies on the pizza. 
</P>
<P>
A good many talents crashed and burned on this project, most notably Joan 
Micklin Silver, the credited director. It is possible to imagine that in really 
brutish hands, the gamy qualities of this script by Robin Schiff and Tom 
Ropelewski &amp; Leslie Dixon could have been made worse. That scene, for 
example, in which the customer for Dempsey's last "delivery" turns out to be 
his own mother (Kate Jackson). Shaken but undetected, Dempsey makes a 
second-story getaway, then sends over the pizza parlor's one real Italian stud 
in his place. How about that for an understanding son? 
</P>
<P>
Director Silver is also generous toward Dempsey's assorted lady-loves, 
including Barbara Carrera as the perceptive tycoon who puts him onto his true 
calling, and married ladies Kirstie Alley and Carrie Fisher, among others. But 
the director has been able to do nothing with this wheezing script, one of the 
subplots of which involves Dempsey's dad believing that his son is gay. And the 
movie's moments of physical farce are mortifying. 
</P>
<P>
What makes "Loverboy"(rated PG-13 for sexual situations) such a pitiful waste 
is that Dempsey has so much potential charm. Learning ballroom dancing by 
following Fred Astaire videos, learning about the world from his matinees, he 
remains the class of the picture. However, if you crave Dempsey in a role 
worthy of him, you'll want "Some Girls." And if you're already one of 
"Loverboy's" victims, "Some Girls" is mandatory to get the taste out of your 
mouth, where it lingers like too many anchovies.

BUSH REJECTS CHENEY VIEW ON GORBACHEV

President Bush sought today to distance himself from his defense secretary's 
forecast of failure for Mikhail S. Gorbachev, asserting that he wants the 
Soviet leader's economic reforms to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce two days after the negative 
prediction by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Bush reminded the business leaders 
that when he met with Gorbachev in New York in December he endorsed the Kremlin 
chief's reform effort known as perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
"I made it clear to Mr. Gorbachev . . . we want to see perestroika succeed . . 
. and likewise we want to see success for the economic reforms in China," Bush 
explained. "Economic reforms, . . . market economy, private ownership, are 
indeed replacing socialist dogma in many countries, large and small, and that 
is an exciting trend. And in my view, it will continue." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, in an interview broadcast Saturday on Cable News Network, responded 
bluntly when asked about Gorbachev's plans: "If I had to guess today, I would 
guess he ultimately would fail; that is to say, he will not be able to reform 
the Soviet economy to turn it into an efficient, modern society." 
</P>
<P>
When that happens, the Pentagon boss continued, Gorbachev "is likely to be 
replaced by somebody who will be far more hostile than he's been in terms of 
his attitude toward the West." 
</P>
<P>
White House chief of staff John H. Sununu moved quickly during the weekend to 
stress that Cheney was not speaking for the President, and Bush spokesman 
Marlin Fitzwater said today that while Cheney had offered just a "guess" on 
Gorbachev's fate, "the Administration chooses not to speculate."

NIGHT STALKER WITNESS CALLED BACK

<TEXT>
<P>
Prosecutors in the Night Stalker trial received permission today to briefly 
reopen their case to re-question a witness they learned had not been entirely 
truthful in his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan agreed to allow the prosecution to again 
question the witness Tuesday morning, postponing the opening of the defense's 
case until prosecutors were finished. "I'm told by the witness that something 
was withheld to protect a woman," Deputy Dist. Atty. P. Philip Halpin said. "It 
was a deliberate omission that amounts to an untruth." 
</P>
<P>
Halpin refused to divulge the witness's identity until the witness begins 
testifying. The prosecutor said the additional questioning should take about 10 
minutes and added that the witness's testimony will not be "earth-shattering."

JAPANESE GROUP BUYS HOTEL BEL-AIR FOR $1 MILLION A ROOM; 
</P>
<P>
GATHERING SPOT OF STARS, EXECUTIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The prestigious Hotel Bel-Air -- gathering place for some of Hollywood's top 
stars and motion picture executives -- is being sold to a Japanese investment 
group for more than $100 million, the hotel's current owners announced this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
The per-room purchase price of more than $1 million shatters the old record of 
more than $750,000 per room, established when the Sultan of Brunei bought the 
nearby 260-room Beverly Hills Hotel for about $185 million in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Farmer, a spokeswoman for the Caroline Rose Hunt Trust, which purchased 
the 11-acre property in the exclusive Stone Canyon residential neighborhood 
near UCLA in 1982 for $22.1 million, said the sale should be completed sometime 
later this month. 
</P>
<P>
The purchaser, Sekitei Kaihatsu, is a 95-year-old firm based in Tokyo that 
operates luxury hotels, resorts and restaurants in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$20 Million for Renovation 
</P>
<P>
Farmer said the Hunt Trust's Rosewood Property Co. of Dallas will continue to 
operate the 92-room hotel for the Japanese investors. Rosewood has already 
spent more than $20 million renovating the Bel-Air. 
</P>
<P>
The rambling, Mission-style complex of bungalows and larger buildings was 
allowed amid the mansions and estates of Stone Canyon because several of the 
original structures had served as business offices and stables for the original 
1920s Bel-Air subdivision. Since these structures failed to conform to local 
residential zoning codes anyway, their transformation into a luxury hotel in 
the 1940s met with relatively little opposition. 
</P>
<P>
The Bel-Air has won Travel and Leisure Magazine's inclusion among the "Ten 
Great Hotels in the World." 
</P>
<P>
The hotel has some of the highest occupancy rates in the Los Angeles area, with 
rooms starting about $195 per night and some suites going for as much as $1,300 
a night. 
</P>
<P>
"The hotel has sort of an understated elegance," Farmer said. "That's why so 
many celebrities flock there. Because it's not a showplace, they can be left 
alone there." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Place to Be Seen 
</P>
<P>
Left alone, perhaps, but still observed. 
</P>
<P>
Among Hollywood's cognoscenti, the Hotel Bel-Air Restaurant is just as 
important a place to be seen at table as the perhaps more familiar Polo Lounge 
at the Beverly Hills Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Those seen engaging in power breakfasts at the Bel-Air of late have included 
actors Mel Gibson, Kathleen Turner, Sylvester Stallone and William Hurt, 
television executive Bud Grant of CBS and film studio chiefs David Puttnam of 
Columbia, Michael Eisner of Disney and Barry Diller of 20th Century Fox. 
</P>
<P>
One longtime resident has been actor Tony Curtis, who lovingly described the 
hotel as "the best wife he'd ever had." 
</P>
<P>
"If I could, I would marry the Bel-Air tomorrow," he told an interviewer in 
1987. "She doesn't ask me where I've been all night. She doesn't mind if I 
bring a girl home. She makes my bed every day, feeds me regularly, takes my 
messages faithfully and puts my laundry in those little boxes tied up with 
ribbon."

Technicians today replaced two faulty fuel system parts aboard space shuttle 
Atlantis, and NASA hopes to reschedule the once-aborted launch attempt for as 
early as Thursday.

<P>
Space agency spokeswoman Lisa Malone said a new pump and 4-inch fuel line were 
installed and were being prepared for pressure, leak and other checks. 
</P>
<P>
Shuttle managers scheduled a meeting this afternoon to consider a new launch 
date. Earlier they had said the earliest possible liftoff date is Friday, but 
with the work progressing smoothly they said today that a Thursday afternoon 
liftoff is a possibility.

A suspected Palestinian collaborator was fatally stabbed today in the latest of 
such killings that Israeli officials say are intended to undermine a proposal 
for elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Ahed Zeedan, 30, was attacked by masked men in his photography studio near the 
military government building in the West Bank city of Tulkarm, Palestinian 
sources said. Zeedan was stabbed several times and died on the way to the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
At least 12 suspected Palestinian collaborators have been killed in the last 
month. In a leaflet, the underground uprising leadership urged Palestinians to 
settle scores with collaborators and "persons deviating from the national 
line."

RECORD BEARS WRIGHT PRAISE FOR VIDEO TIED TO WIFE'S JOB

House Speaker Jim Wright inserted into the Congressional Record a glowing 
endorsement of a privately produced home video program at a time when his wife 
was drawing a $36,000 salary from the company that was marketing the video. 
</P>
<P>
The praise for the Pacific Institute's family video series was inserted into 
the record on Dec. 9, 1985, and was later used in promotional material for the 
company's sales force. Wright's statement does not mention his wife's 
employment at the Seattle firm that sells motivational tapes and programs, 
primarily to corporate clients. 
</P>
<P>
In the endorsement, Wright calls the marketing of the video "a heartening 
development indeed" and notes that the series is "available at a nominal price 
within the range of most American families." 
</P>
<P>
The existence of the Congressional Record endorsement was first disclosed in 
today's editions of The Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
Any member of Congress is free to insert material into the Congressional 
Record. But the rules generally bar any member from receiving benefits "which 
would occur by virtue of influence improperly exerted from his position in the 
Congress." 
</P>
<P>
The guidelines also caution lawmakers not to become "too closely affiliated 
with a particular enterprise" to prevent the appearance that the rule is being 
broken. 
</P>
<P>
The latest revelation comes at a time when Wright is battling a series of 
ethics charges brought by the House Ethics Committee.

POLICE SKEPTICAL ON REPORT OF ABDUCTION OF 2ND INFANT

A couple whose infant daughter was found dead in 1986 after they reported her 
abducted by a masked gunman now claim another baby has been kidnaped under 
virtually identical circumstances, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"What are the chances of somebody breaking into your house and taking your 
small infant child once in your life? You figure out the odds and then figure 
out the odds that it could happen a second time in a completely different 
city," said Police Sgt. Billy Lawrence. "But I'm not trying to say anything." 
</P>
<P>
Robert and Paula Sims reported that their 6-week-old daughter, Heather, was 
missing after a masked gunman confronted Paula Sims outside the family's home 
Saturday night, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
She said the man ordered her inside and struck her unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Sims reported that he returned home from work and found his 
wife unconscious. They said he revived her, found Heather missing from her 
bassinet and discovered that their 15-month-old son was asleep in his room. 
</P>
<P>
In the previous case, the mother reported that a masked gunman entered her home 
on the night of June 17, 1986, ordered her to lie down and took her 13-day-old 
daughter, Loralei. 
</P>
<P>
Loralei's remains were discovered five days later in woods about 150 feet from 
the couple's home in the Jersey County town of Brighton, about 10 miles from 
Alton. No cause of death was ever determined and no one was ever arrested, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of both abductions, Sims was at work, the couple told police. 
</P>
<P>
Jersey County Sheriff Frank Yocom said investigators took the first case to a 
grand jury, and the Simses both invoked their rights against self-incrimination 
under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.

Kollmorgen Corp. announced today it will merge with Vernitron Corp. of Deer 
Park, N.Y., in a deal worth about $320 million, ending months of jockeying in 
what began as a hostile takeover attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the agreement, Vernitron will pay $25 per share for 12.8 
million outstanding Kollmorgen shares, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Kollmorgen produces submarine periscopes, electronic circuit boards and 
electric motors. It reported earnings of $14.1 million last year, or $1.34 per 
share. 
</P>
<P>
In February, Vernitron raised its by then $23 per share bid for Kollmorgen to 
$25 per share if Kollmorgen would agree to redeem a so-called "poison pill" 
that was part of a shareholders' rights plan adopted by Kollmorgen in December 
in response to the initial offer. Vernitron spokeswoman Roanne Kulakoff said 
the poison pill will be redeemed as part of the merger agreement.

The price of Ogilvy Group Inc. stock soared $16 a share in early trading on 
Wall Street today after the U.S. advertising company gave a cool response to a 
$725-million takeover offer from Britain's WPP Group PLC. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of the two would create an advertising giant second only to 
London-based Saatchi &amp; Saatchi PLC among world advertising companies. 
(Story, Part IV, Page 1.)

The strong trading on Wall Street indicated a belief that a higher offer will 
emerge for Ogilvy. 
</P>
<P>
Ogilvy, the New York-based parent company of Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide, 
said Sunday that the offer by WPP Group PLC was unsolicited and that the 
company wanted to remain independent.

COURT BLOCKS MERGER OF 2 DETROIT PAPERS; 
</P>
<P>
TO HEAR CHALLENGE TO JOINT OPERATING PACT OKD BY MEESE

<P>
The Supreme Court today halted indefinitely the merger of two of the largest 
and most competitive daily newspapers in America. 
</P>
<P>
The court agreed to hear a case challenging the merger of The Detroit News and 
the Detroit Free Press, two of the nation's largest daily newspapers that have 
been locked in a debilitating struggle for dominance in the Motor City. 
</P>
<P>
By granting review in the case, the court puts the merger on hold indefinitely. 
Because of the court's schedule, the case cannot be heard until the fall with a 
decision not likely before the end of the year or early next year. 
</P>
<P>
"This process has been an extraordinary lesson in patience," said David 
Lawrence Jr., publisher of the Free Press. "The people of the Free Press have 
already waited more than three years to assure this newspaper's future. The 
wait is not over." 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we're elated that the First Amendment is alive and well," said Ed 
Wendover, publisher of the Community Crier in suburban Plymouth and a leader in 
a group challenging the merger. 
</P>
<P>
Wendover said the court's action makes him more optimistic about the eventual 
outcome of the case. But he said he is disappointed the justices did not give 
the matter expedited consideration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Joint Operation at Issue 
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether the two papers should merge under a joint operating 
agreement under the Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970, a law that allows 
failing newspapers to combine non-editorial operations of the business to cut 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of the act was to preserve separate editorial voices in a time of 
dying newspapers. Such mergers must be approved by the U.S. attorney general, 
which, in the Detroit case, happened in August, 1988, under then-Atty. Gen. 
Edwin Meese III. 
</P>
<P>
However, the merger was opposed by a group called Michigan Citizens for an 
Independent Press and others who argued the two papers do not fit the 
definition of failing newspapers. They filed suit in federal court to block the 
joint operating move. They lost at both the district court and the appeals 
court level. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking high court review, the group maintained that "both papers could quickly 
be restored to profitability through modest price increases -- increases that 
would bring circulation and advertising rates in line with virtually all other 
papers in the country." 
</P>
<P>
The Gannett Co. Inc. owns The Detroit News and Knight-Ridder Newspapers Inc. 
owns the Detroit Free Press. The companies are the two largest newspaper groups 
in the United States and most of their properties generate large amounts of 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
In Detroit, however, the two papers have been locked in a fierce war for 
dominance for decades that led to price cuts, reductions in advertising rates 
and infusions of cash to put out better, more competitive products. 
</P>
<P>
In other actions today, the court: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Agreed to hear a Bush Administration appeal aimed at allowing the 
government to collect potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes from 
multinational corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Refused to hear an appeal by Hawaii officials seeking to recover from 
asbestos manufacturers the cost of removing the product from public schools in 
the state.

SOME JAPANESE SAY FSX PACT UNFAIR TO THEM

The revision of a U.S.-Japan pact to develop jointly a new fighter plane for 
Japan's air force drew fire today from Japanese critics who say Tokyo gave too 
much away and got too little in return. 
</P>
<P>
And some political analysts said the kind of pressure the United States exerted 
in the new deal could, over time, help push Tokyo toward more independent 
economic and security policies. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush said Friday that the two governments have decided, after months 
of wrangling, that U.S. firms will get 40% of development and production work 
on the project. 
</P>
<P>
The project in total is estimated to be worth $8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In the new pact, which revises one reached in November, Tokyo also bowed to 
U.S. demands that the United States have access to the cutting-edge technology 
Japanese firms develop for the FSX fighter. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese Defense Minister Kichiro Tazawa praised the new pact Saturday, but 
Japanese newspaper editorials today heaped criticism on it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Few Rewards for Japan' 
</P>
<P>
"Viewed from the starting point of several years ago when the Defense Agency 
made independent development (of the FSX) its object, this was the worst 
possible conclusion," said an editorial in the financial daily Nihon Keizai 
Shimbun. "It has ended in a form which has few rewards for Japan," the paper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A Defense Agency spokesman said today that Japan will now have to develop its 
own computer programs for the weapons system since the United States would not 
give access to the source codes. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. pressure highlighting a view of Japan as an economic rival rather than a 
trusted ally could erode pro-U.S. sentiment in Japan, some analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the biggest invisible assets in America's global strategy is the very 
strong pro-American sentiment in Japan," political scientist Kuniko Inoguchi 
said. "To play around with it, or to behave in a way that the U.S. may 
eventually erode that national sentiment, is a big loss for the United States," 
he said.

O'REILLY STEPS DOWN, PLAYERS SAY; 
</P>
<P>
BRUIN COACH DIRECTED 1 TRIP TO STANLEY CUP FINAL IN 2 YEARS ON JOB 
</P>

<P>
Bruins Coach Terry O'Reilly resigned today after two full years behind the 
bench and one trip to a Stanley Cup final, according to players. 
</P>
<P>
"We had no forewarning really," said Bruins forward Bob Joyce. "He told us, and 
it is a surprise." 
</P>
<P>
The news came after a closed-door meeting with Bruins General Manager Harry 
Sinden. Boston was knocked out of the second round of this year's National 
Hockey League playoffs by Montreal in four straight games. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can't Be Confirmed 
</P>
<P>
Neither O'Reilly nor the Bruins could immediately be reached for confirmation 
of the players' reports. 
</P>
<P>
Although Joyce called the resignation a surprise, other players who gathered at 
Boston Garden today said there have been indications for weeks that O'Reilly 
was considering stepping down. 
</P>
<P>
"He let us know toward the end of the season" that he was considering leaving, 
said Bruins rookie forward John Carter. 
</P>
<P>
Center Ken Linseman said, "I think during the middle of the year he was getting 
pretty frustrated with all the injuries. . . . He was a players' coach. He 
tried to work real hard and treat the players really fairly." 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins said they enjoyed having O'Reilly, a recent Bruins player, as their 
coach. But they said the job took a toll. 
</P>
<P>
Among the pressures off the ice, O'Reilly has a son who is battling a liver 
ailment and may need a transplant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suspended for Several Games 
</P>
<P>
O'Reilly was suspended this season for several games after becoming involved in 
a brawl at a game in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
"Even when he took the job (in November, 1986) I remember saying, 'It's great 
for me, but I don't know if it's great for him,' " Linseman said. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation as to O'Reilly's successor centered on Mike Milbury, coach of the 
Bruin's American Hockey League team in Maine, and Bruins assistant coach John 
Cuniff. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the players are disappointed," Joyce said. "He was definitely a 
player's coach. He was a motivator. He wasn't a technical coach."

HANK ALLEN: FROM THE DIAMOND TO THE DERBY; 
</P>
<P>
FORMER BASEBALL PLAYER IS FIRST BLACK TRAINER AT CHURCHILL DOWNS SINCE 1911 
</P>

Had there been even an inkling of opportunity for blacks to coach or manage in 
baseball 16 years ago, when Hank Allen was wondering what he would do with the 
rest of his life, he probably would not be in line to become the first black 
trainer since 1911 to saddle a horse in the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to stay in baseball. I begged. I pleaded. I wrote letters to every 
club in the major leagues. But nothing ever transpired," Allen, 48, said Sunday 
at Churchill Downs, where he has brought the little-known Northern Wolf to run 
in Saturday's 115th Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'This Is It' 
</P>
<P>
"Now," he said, surveying the morning backstretch rituals in progress, "this is 
it. I couldn't tell you today who's in first place or who the Rookie of the 
Year was last season. I just wouldn't know. That was a phase of my life I 
enjoyed. I'm enjoying this now." 
</P>
<P>
His career statistics support Allen's claim that he never learned to hit a 
curve ball. He never played more than 116 games in a season in the major 
leagues, hit only six career home runs and had a lifetime average of .241. He 
spent more than half of his 14-year career in the minors. He spent the rest of 
the time fighting for a roster spot as a utility player with the Washington 
Senators, Milwaukee Brewers and Chicago White Sox while perpetually in the 
shadow of his more accomplished younger brother, Dick. Even now, even at race 
tracks, he is best known as "Dick Allen's brother." 
</P>
<P>
"The high point of my career," he said jokingly, "was standing out there while 
they played the 'Star-Spangled Banner.' " But he did not go willingly from 
baseball after retiring as a player in 1973. He wanted badly, Allen said, to 
coach or manage. Such jobs, scarce even now, were largely unavailable to black 
men in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Keep on Stepping' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure (racism) probably did play a role in keeping me and other guys like 
me out of administrative baseball jobs. But the whys and hows -- you can't 
concern yourself with that. You have to deal with what's going on at the time 
and work within the realm of what you have to deal with. You don't dwell in the 
past. You have to move on to something else and keep on stepping." 
</P>
<P>
His appearance Saturday in the saddling paddock probably will be the high point 
of his training career so far, because the Maryland-bred colt he trains for the 
Deep Silver Stable is given virtually no chance to win. For Allen, it will be 
like coming to bat with two out in the ninth in the seventh game of the World 
Series with his team down 10-0. 
</P>
<P>
When they play "My Old Kentucky Home" as the horses parade to the post, Allen 
may have the same feeling he had during the days when he would stand in the 
Washington outfield with his cap held over his heart. Whatever happens next is 
likely to be bad. Still, he is here, a starter in one of racing's biggest 
games. 
</P>
<P>
He is no more a star trainer than he was a star ballplayer, but Allen has 
enjoyed modest success, primarily in Maryland. He is here without much chance 
to win the Derby, but there is historical significance attached to his 
presence. Not since Raleigh Colston saddled his namesake, Colston, to finish 
third in the 1911 Derby has a black trained a Derby starter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I've Been Blessed' 
</P>
<P>
"Opportunity is everything," Allen said. "You can go around the country and 
find (black) guys who have only one or two horses but are excellent horsemen, 
fine trainers. I've just been blessed with the opportunity to train some horses 
of quality. If a black man hasn't started a horse in the Derby since 1911, all 
that says to me is that they have been limited by the lack of opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Allen has a rare opportunity this week, if little ammunition. What he needs now 
is a pinch runner to send in for Northern Wolf.

SPORTS PUBLISHER REGRETS HIS RACIST NOTE

The publisher of two sports magazines, Football News and Basketball Weekly, has 
apologized for remarks he wrote belittling the dedication of black athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"I regret sending the letter and apologize to all those people who were 
offended by its contents," Publisher Roger Stanton said Sunday. "This is not 
the real Roger Stanton talking." 
</P>
<P>
Stanton made the statement after a letter he wrote to NBC anchorman Tom Brokaw 
was published by the Detroit Free Press. The two-page note discussed the 
recently broadcast NBC program called "Black Athletes: Fact and Fiction." 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Stanton, 60, said the network avoided mentioning that black 
athletes "lack discipline," are more prone to "emotional swings than the white 
athlete" and "are not willing to pay the price" to succeed in professions other 
than in sports. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Stanton had sent a copy of the letter to its sports 
broadcasting columnist. Stanton admitted sending the letter but said he did not 
intend for it to be published. 
</P>
<P>
Stanton cited his record as a sports publisher in his apology. 
</P>
<P>
"For the entire 40 years of my sports journalism career, I have been fair to 
everyone, and my publications, Football News and Basketball Weekly, have given 
fair treatment to all athletes, coaches and administrators, regardless of race, 
creed or color," Stanton said. 
</P>
<P>
Football News, which Stanton took over in 1962, publishes 20 times a year and 
lists a paid circulation of 150,000 a year. Basketball Weekly has a circulation 
of 40,000.

A Baldwin-Wallace College baseball player was in critical condition after 
surgery for a neck fracture suffered while sliding head-first into third base 
during a game at Otterbein College, a Baldwin-Wallace spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Guy Fisher, 21, was recovering from surgery at St. Ann's Hospital in 
Westerville, said Kevin Ruple of Baldwin-Wallace. "He had some feeling in his 
hands and his arms," Ruple said today. "There was nothing from the waist down." 
Doctors said there was a high possibility that Fisher would be paralyzed from 
the waist down, Ruple said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred in the seventh inning of Sunday's first game at Otterbein 
when Fisher, trying to reach third on a wild pitch, collided with the third 
baseman, Ruple said. The business major and honors student is the son of 
Baldwin-Wallace baseball Coach Bob Fisher, Ruple said.
