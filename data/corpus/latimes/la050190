A San Bernardino County sheriff's deputy was seriously wounded in a shoot-out 
with a forgery suspect who was then killed by the lawman and other officers, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Thomas Garcia, 39, of Victorville, was shot at least five times by the 
suspect, who was armed with a 9-millimeter semi-automatic handgun, a Sheriff's 
Department spokesman said. Garcia, a 17-year veteran of the department, was 
taken to Victor Valley Community Hospital and later transferred by a sheriff's 
helicopter to San Bernardino County Medical Center for surgery. The shoot-out 
occurred after Garcia and another deputy responded to a report of a possible 
forgery suspect in a Bank of America branch, Bryant said.

HARRIS' LAWYERS FILE FOR COURT HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lawyers for Robert Alton Harris argued in a fat brief filed with the U.S. 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeals that the condemned murderer is entitled to a full 
fact-finding hearing on his claim that mental disorders drove him to kill two 
teen-age San Diego boys. Defense lawyers Charles M. Sevilla and Michael McCabe 
claim that their 37-year-old client suffers mental disorders that drove him to 
kill impulsively. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, they said, evidence of these disorders was not presented to the jury that 
sentenced Harris to death for the 1978 murders of Michael Baker and John 
Mayeski, both 16, in order to steal their car for use in a bank robbery. 
Prosecutors described Harris' claims as "ridiculous" and urged a three-judge 
appellate court panel to reject his challenge.

A 5-year-old boy, still haunted by the memory, says he was splattered with 
blood and watched in horror as his father robbed and murdered a woman three 
years ago, investigators said. "We feel the information the child gave is 
accurate," Police Chief Joseph McNamara said. 
</P>
<P>
"The details he gave fit the crime." A $10,000 reward for information leading 
to the arrest and conviction of the boy's father, Erik Sanford Chatman, 25, has 
been offered through the city's Crimestopper program, McNamara said. Chatman 
was seen recently in the San Francisco Bay Area and is "considered armed and 
dangerous. He is a known drug abuser," the police chief said. Chatman is 
suspected in the stabbing death of Rosellina LoBue, 18, during the Oct. 7, 
1987, robbery of a drive-up photo shop.

LEVY BUT NO WATER; 
</P>
<P>
PAUMA VALLEY WOMAN DEFIES FEE RISE ON SERVICE SHE DOESN'T USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mary P. Austin, an artist who owns 450 acres in Pauma Valley, near the base of 
Palomar Mountain, tolerates bureaucracy about as well as her oils mix with 
water. 
</P>
<P>
And maybe that's why Austin, a 71-year-old widow, was aghast when she got her 
tax bill last November that, among other things, included a $5,862 levy against 
her as a "water availability" fee. That fee alone virtually quadrupled her 
annual property tax bill, stunning the woman who lives on a fixed, Social 
Security income supplemented only by an occasional sale of her art works. 
</P>
<P>
"I was fit to be tied," said Austin. "I had been paying taxes of less than 
$2,000 a year, and suddenly I'm hit with a tax bill of almost $8,000. I was 
astonished." 
</P>
<P>
The increase reflected a change in state law last year that allowed the County 
Water Authority (CWA) to assess everyone in San Diego County $10 per acre -- or 
parcel, whichever was greater -- to help pay for capital improvements to its 
piped water delivery system. The CWA, which sells imported water to the 
county's local water districts, charged Austin $4,575 as her share for helping 
to maintain and expand the system. Countywide, the CWA fee was expected to 
generate about $10 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Austin's local Yuima Water District, empowered with the same state law, 
assessed its own fee, based on a sliding scale of how much property one owns in 
the Pauma Valley. In Austin's case, the bill came to $1,287. 
</P>
<P>
Austin was infuriated, though, because she has no use -- and says she never 
will -- for piped city water. She has lived on the property that fronts 
California 76 since 1940 -- when her father bought it for her and her husband 
-- and had never needed more than well water to meet her personal, domestic 
needs. She never planted the acreage in groves or orchards so additional water 
wasn't needed for agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, a self-described cynic about government, let loose a flurry of 
letters and phone calls to protest the water bill. "I called the county 50 
times, and every time they gave me another number to call, or told me that 
someone would get back to me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Austin finally got in contact with Shirley Jackson, the assistant general 
manager of the County Water Authority. "At first she said there was nothing she 
could do about it, that she had no recourse." 
</P>
<P>
But Austin, who describes her art as "figurative Expressionist," found another 
way to express herself, figuratively speaking. She called state Assemblyman 
Robert Frazee (R-Carlsbad) -- who not only represents her district but authored 
the very legislation that let the CWA do what it did to her. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea of the fee is to allow water districts to accumulate a fund for 
future maintenance and repairs, and also to assess people who are not using any 
water but still benefit by the increased value of their land because it's 
served by the district, if they should want the water," Frazee said. 
</P>
<P>
But the assemblyman quickly saw the problem with Austin's situation. "The CWA 
hasn't had experience in imposing fees like this, and they instructed the 
county assessor to send out bills to everyone who owned a parcel," even if they 
didn't use city water and had no plans to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Frazee got several complaining phone calls, including Austin's. 
</P>
<P>
"I went back to the CWA and said, 'Hey, folks, we've got to do something about 
this.' " 
</P>
<P>
Now, with a state assemblyman on her side, Austin saw some light at the end of 
the tunnel. CWA staff workers began studying options to get the woman off the 
hook. Austin paid the first half of her annual tax bill in December -- 
including the amount she protested -- hoping that eventually it would be 
refunded to her. 
</P>
<P>
Come January, the problem still hadn't been resolved. February. March. April -- 
and the second half of her property tax installment was due. 
</P>
<P>
She didn't pay it, exposing herself to a 10% penalty from the county tax 
collector. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a call from Shirley Jackson the day before (April 10, the tax due date) 
and she said they were moving forward with the change in the policy with due 
diligence. I'm not sure if it was diligence, but it was certainly due," Austin 
offered. 
</P>
<P>
The CWA staff was, in the meantime, discussing how to write a new policy that 
would excuse people like Austin from paying the water availability charge. 
Indeed, about a dozen people, in situations like Austin's, called the CWA to 
complain that they shouldn't pay the bill either, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Since they weren't using the water and said they have no intention of using 
it, we began to look for some relief for them," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a draft proposal was prepared by the lawyers: If a property owner can 
make a case to the CWA board of directors that he doesn't use -- and has no 
intention of using -- piped city water via the CWA, he won't have to pay the 
"water availability" benefit fee. 
</P>
<P>
But, if the land ever is developed and commercial water is needed, the owner 
will have to pay the fee -- retroactive to last July 1, when the law went into 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
The CWA board of directors is expected to adopt the deferred-payment policy 
when it meets May 17. 
</P>
<P>
The Yuima Water District's board of directors are considering a similar tack so 
that Austin will be relieved of that district's smaller water bill as well. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said the staff is also going to ask the CWA board of directors to pay 
Austin's 10% tax penalty, since it was the CWA fee that caused Austin not to 
pay her entire tax bill by the April 10 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
But Philip Jacobsen, the chief deputy tax collector, said that, if the CWA 
amends the tax bill downward, Austin will not be charged the 10% penalty as 
long as she pays the revised bill within 30 days. And the amount she already 
paid to the CWA last December will be credited towards her overall second-half 
tax bill, he said, with any overpayment refunded. 
</P>
<P>
Austin hopes the problem is being resolved, but isn't exactly holding her 
breath. "They say that's what they're going to do, but they keep putting it 
off, and it seemed like I was getting stonewalled," she said. "So I'll just 
wait and see. But I know one thing: I'm not going to pay the water fee." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, some of Austin's 450 acres -- mostly chaparral and meadowland, 
but with a generous sprinkling of live oak, sycamore and eucalyptus -- is up 
for sale. 
</P>
<P>
But not just to anybody. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the county, state or federal government to buy it for a wilderness 
preserve," she said. "I value this land for its aesthetics, and I want it 
protected. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm seeing fewer raccoons and red foxes and badgers than I used to," she said, 
"but I'm still getting the wildcats coming down from the upper reaches. And I 
don't want this land developed. 
</P>
<P>
"Developers already have gotten to Temecula and Rancho Bernardo, and they'll be 
after us presently. All the wildlife is retreating," she said. 
</P>
<P>
If she can't sell any of the property to a government agency, she'll simply 
hang on to it. 
</P>
<P>
"And as long as I do," she says, "I've got all the well water I need."

AUTOMATED AIRPORT TRAFFIC SIGNALS UNVEILED; 
</P>
<P>
CONGESTION: THE $3-MILLION SYSTEM SURROUNDING LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL WILL BE 
COMPLETED NEXT JANUARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Standing at an intersection notorious for clogged traffic, Mayor Tom Bradley 
and Councilwoman Ruth Galanter unveiled a high-tech system Monday designed to 
ease congestion on the streets surrounding Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the Airport Automated Traffic Surveillance and Control System 
began in March and is expected to be completed next January at a cost of $3 
million, Galanter said. 
</P>
<P>
ATSAC works through a system of sensors in the pavement that transmit 
information about traffic conditions to a control center four floors below City 
Hall East, where the timing of traffic signals is adjusted to facilitate the 
flow of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The sensors also transmit information about unexpected traffic problems so 
traffic officers, police or firefighters can be quickly sent to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Federal transportation dollars will pay for half of the cost of the project at 
the airport and the balance will be provided by the Coastal Transportation 
Corridor Specific Plan Trust Fund, which derives its money from fees charged to 
developers based on the size of their project. 
</P>
<P>
"The overwhelming traffic control around the airport has always been of 
particular concern to those going to the airport and to residents in the 
general vicinity," Bradley said at a news conference at the corner of 
Westchester and Lincoln boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
"ATSAC is easy to implement and is less expensive than widening the street or 
constructing a new freeway," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The traffic system is being installed in an area bounded by Manchester on the 
north, Imperial Highway on the south, Centinela Avenue and La Cienega Boulevard 
on the east and the Pacific Ocean on the west. 
</P>
<P>
The project involves upgrading 114 traffic signals at intersections and one 
mid-block signal. It also involves the installation of 384 vehicle detectors in 
the pavement and 72,300 feet of electric cable. 
</P>
<P>
Installation of the system in the airport area is part of an expansion of a 
program that is already in operation downtown and under construction in 
Westwood, the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood.

GANG MEMBER CONVICTED OF MURDERING 2 IN 1982 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A gang member charged with killing a rival and a 17-year-old girl in two 1982 
drive-by shootings was convicted Monday in the culmination of one of the oldest 
criminal trials in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Virgil Byers, 28, of Los Angeles, was found guilty of two counts of 
second-degree murder and three counts of assault with a deadly weapon by a 
Superior Court jury of six men and six women. 
</P>
<P>
However, Byers was acquitted of first-degree murder and attempted murder 
charges stemming from the same shootings. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors also acquitted Byers of special circumstance allegations that would have 
made him eligible for a death sentence if he had been convicted of first-degree 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
Byers, scheduled to be sentenced May 29, faces a maximum prison term of 30 
years to life for the murders and an additional 20 years for the assault 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Byers' case became one of the oldest criminal trials to wend its way through 
the courts in Los Angeles County largely because he succeeded in delaying his 
trial over the years by switching lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about time," Deputy Dist. Atty. Loren Naiman said of the guilty verdicts. 
"The victims died eight years ago. Their families sit in utter amazement that 
the system could drag on this long." 
</P>
<P>
Byers was convicted of the murder of a rival gang member, Cornelius Harris, who 
was killed by shots fired from a passing car while a passenger in another 
vehicle on May 3, 1982. The slaying occurred in Southwest Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Another rival gang member was wounded in the attack. Naiman said Byers was 
either the gunman or the driver of the car in the assault. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, Byers fired into a second car, killing a 17-year-old girl, Jody 
Hayes, and wounding two other rival gang members, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Joel Isaacson argued at the trial that Byers was under the 
influence of PCP when he telephoned police three months after the shootings and 
confessed. 
</P>
<P>
Isaacson is the sixth attorney to represent Byers since his arrest in August, 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
He was appointed to represent Byers in March, 1988, over the objections of 
Naiman, who argued that Byers kept changing defense attorneys as a 
trial-delaying tactic. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a case where the defendant controls the system, not where the system 
controls the defendant," Naiman said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Naiman said all of Byers' previous attorneys were relieved of the case because 
of conflicts Byers claimed he had with them. 
</P>
<P>
Byers' fifth attorney, Lee Brewster, was taken off the case on grounds that he 
could not adequately defend Byers because of threats he had received. Brewster 
did not say who made the threats. 
</P>
<P>
Byers finally went on trial in late 1987, but a mistrial was declared in 
January, 1988, when jurors deadlocked 11-1 in favor of conviction. He was then 
retried. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Byers wanted to test the system," Naiman said. "He always wanted to test 
the system. And now he has his result." 
</P>
<P>
Byers was manacled during the trial because of his propensity for violence, 
Naiman said. While in custody in County Jail, he was convicted of the attempted 
murder of another inmate and was sentenced to 12 years in state prison.

PLAN ASKS PRINTING NAMES OF SCOFFLAWS; 
</P>
<P>
PARKING FINES: MAYOR CALLS FOR CHANGES IN STATE LAW TO ALLOW CITY TO BETTER 
COLLECT SOME OF THE $226.6 MILLION IN UNPAID TICKETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PENELOPE McMILLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To collect more unpaid parking tickets, Los Angeles transportation officials 
recommended publicizing the names of the worst parking violators, and Mayor Tom 
Bradley called Monday for changes in state legislation that would improve the 
city's ability to make scofflaws pay. 
</P>
<P>
In a report to the mayor, Department of Transportation General Manager S.E. 
Rowe revised downward the amount of unpaid parking fines from $249 million to 
$226.6 million. Rowe also said 71% of the tickets issued annually are being 
collected. 
</P>
<P>
But the mayor responded, "Los Angeles can and must do more." 
</P>
<P>
After inquiries from The Times, Bradley asked parking officials to provide 
information on the status of the city's collections. 
</P>
<P>
The report concluded that only $106.8 million of the $226.6 million is 
potentially collectible. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining $119.7 million was deemed uncollectible for a number of reasons: 
Courts had dismissed some of the tickets, notices mailed to owners had been 
returned for lack of a current address, or the state Department of Motor 
Vehicles was unable to provide any owner registration information. 
</P>
<P>
In his call for new legislation, Bradley wrote state Senate President Pro Tem 
David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), saying that "state law currently inhibits the 
city of Los Angeles" from pursuing those violators. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor noted that $35 million goes uncollected because the DMV does not have 
up-to-date driver identification information, and another $22 million is owed 
by people who have sold their cars but can't be found. 
</P>
<P>
"California must revise our laws to require drivers to obtain a single license 
plate that would stay with the driver, not the car, whenever the vehicle is 
sold," Bradley said. "In other words, simply selling the car would not be a way 
to avoid paying parking tickets." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley also endorsed another recommendation in the parking report that would 
amend the state Vehicle Code to allow the city to impound or attach metal 
"boots" to scofflaw vehicles, even when the vehicles are located on private 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Under current law, the boots can be applied to vehicles with five or more 
unpaid tickets, but only if they are on public property. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Roberti said the senator would consider the mayor's requests. 
</P>
<P>
The city should release for publication a "heavy hitter list" of scofflaw 
organizations and individuals, the report recommended. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Carsman, parking ticket coordinator, said, "If these folks happen to be 
prominent citizens or corporations who flagrantly violate parking laws and fail 
to address their responsibility to deal with the tickets, then publicizing 
their names might help to persuade them to obey the law." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley spokesman Bill Chandler said that the mayor has not taken a position on 
the recommendation. "He is considering it," Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
Parking officials also proposed expansion of the "booting and impound program 
to evenings and weekends, (which ) would increase revenue by approximately 
$600,000 per year." 
</P>
<P>
The department asked for two more booting teams, up from its present four, who 
would be deployed six days a week instead of five. Bradley said he had provided 
for one more team in his proposed budget. 
</P>
<P>
The $106.8 million that parking officials described as collectible included 
about $11 million worth of tickets issued within the last 60 days, $633,361 
incurred by out-of-state motorists who had been mailed notices, and $47 million 
in fines for which the DMV had placed holds on registration renewals. Under 
state law, owners cannot renew those registrations until the parking citations 
are paid. 
</P>
<P>
Another $48 million in possibly collectible fines have been assigned, for a 30% 
commission fee, to Lockheed Information Management Services Inc. The company 
has held the city's contract to process parking tickets since 1985, and won a 
contract amendment to do "special collections" last year. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed has collected $5.6 million in such delinquent fines. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter Monday to Rowe, Bradley noted that the contract for processing and 
collections is up for renewal later this year, and said: "This is a perfect 
opportunity for the city to evaluate its parking ticket collection process. We 
must give top consideration to those firms with the most aggressive plan of 
action." 
</P>
<P>
The report described recent steps taken to improve collections from the 
outstanding $226.6 million. One involves new "specialized enforcement teams" 
that in their first three days of operation impounded 25 vehicles with 285 
citations listed against them, the report said, representing $17,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
And Lockheed, which -- with parking officials' approval -- had relied only on 
mailed notices to delinquent violators in the "special collections" program, 
may pursue some of the more aggressive strategies spelled out in its city 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
The company, the report said, "is now developing a plan to address skip-tracing 
requirements for violators who do not have a correct current address on file 
and a program for telephone contacts to debtors."

EX-GANG CHIEF CONVICTED OF MURDERING 2 IN 1982 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The waiting ended for former gang leader Virgil Byars on Monday when a jury 
convicted him of separate drive-by shootings that left two people dead and 
three injured eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
After a week of deliberations, the six-man, six-woman jury found him guilty of 
two counts of second-degree murder and three counts of assault with a deadly 
weapon. The prosecution had sought first-degree murder convictions with special 
circumstances that would have sent Byars to prison for life without possibility 
of parole. 
</P>
<P>
Byars, 27, has been held without bail since the fall of 1982 -- four months 
after the shootings -- when he turned himself in. He was not a suspect and was 
not being sought, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
He faces 35 years to life in prison, although it is possible that he could 
receive a sentence that would make him eligible for parole in less than three 
years. He rejected a proposed plea bargain when his trial began last month. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Byars has always wanted to test the system," Deputy Dist. Atty. Loren 
Naiman, who prosecuted the case, said afterward, noting that Byars refused to 
return to the courtroom after the verdicts were read. "It appears now that he's 
unhappy with the verdict." 
</P>
<P>
Wearing wire-rimmed glasses and a business suit and looking more like a 
mild-mannered librarian or accountant than the tough gang member he admittedly 
was, Byars showed no expression as the jury's decisions were read. However, he 
refused to return to the courtroom for clarification of a verdict on one of the 
lesser charges. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he perceived the gist of the verdicts," defense attorney Victor 
Salerno, standing in for Byars' ailing lawyer, told Los Angeles Superior Court 
Judge Jacqueline Connor. He will be sentenced May 29. 
</P>
<P>
The case might have gone unnoticed as just another gang shooting, but for the 
fact that it is believed to be the oldest active criminal court case in Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, it appeared simple: after telephoning police to surrender 
"because God told me to," Byars was charged with the shooting deaths of 
Cornelius Harris and Jody Hayes, allegedly members of a rival gang, and the 
wounding of three other people. He showed police where the shootings happened 
and provided details in a six-hour confession. 
</P>
<P>
The delay was caused by Byars' firing five of six attorneys appointed to 
represent him, his lengthy but unsuccessful battle to keep his confession from 
being admitted as evidence, and a trial that ended with a hung jury last year. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, Monday's verdict was neither a victory nor a loss for either 
side. 
</P>
<P>
Naiman said he was "disappointed . . . but satisfied that the case got to 
trial. It is a fair verdict. "It's about time. The victims died eight years 
ago. Their families sit in utter amazement that the system could drag out so 
long. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not yet final," he said. "The appeals process could take years." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Joel Isaacson, who was ill and unable to be in court Monday, 
said by telephone that he was "relieved" that his client had not been found 
guilty of first-degree murder charges. He said he had hoped for a manslaughter 
verdict if not acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised that, given the gang hysteria that prevails today, a jury was 
able to judge the case on the facts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Byars had been charged with two counts of first-degree murder and three counts 
of attempted murder. He was convicted of lesser charges of second-degree murder 
and assault with a deadly weapon. Prosecutors did not seek the death penalty in 
the special circumstances allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't believe that he intended to kill, but that he was going to go out 
and shoot 'em (rival gang members) up," said jury foreman Michael 
Abbatecola,49, of Monterey Park, a postal worker. 
</P>
<P>
He said the jury did not believe Byars was high on PCP, a mind-altering drug, 
at the time of the crimes, as he claimed. Nor did the jury base its decisions 
on the detailed confession Byars gave to police that was played in court, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The confession in and of itself didn't hang him," Abbatecola said. "It was all 
tied in . . . the evidence was there." 
</P>
<P>
Several jurors leaned toward manslaughter verdicts at the beginning, the 
foreman said. But at least one pushed, right up until the end, for first-degree 
murder and attempted murder verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to do a lot of meditating about it over lunch," explained Burbank nurse 
Sandy Shirley, 48, who held out for the harsher verdicts. She said she finally 
relented "because I didn't want to hang the jury." 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said he doubts that Byars will "do well" in the state prison 
system, given his history of violence. Since his surrender eight years ago, he 
has been convicted of the attempted murder of another inmate and sentenced to 
12 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
He has also been involved in more than 20 jail fights, Naiman said. Court 
records show that several of Byars' attorneys asked to be removed from his case 
after he allegedly threatened them.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: UNION URGES REJECTION OF KAISER CONTRACT 
OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The union representing about 1,000 registered nurses at two Kaiser Permanente 
facilities Monday urged its members to reject a final contract offer. 
</P>
<P>
Members of American Federation of Nurses, Local 535, Service Employees 
International Union were given details of the contract offer during an all-day 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
A strike vote was scheduled for Monday night. Members have three options: to 
accept the three-year offer, to reject it and strike, or to postpone a vote for 
10 days, said union spokesman Jorge Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
Any walkout would affect the 632-bed Los Angeles Medical Center and the 40-bed 
Inglewood Skilled Nursing Facility. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser spokeswoman Janice Seib said three other Kaiser hospitals in the area 
would handle some patients in the event of a strike. 
</P>
<P>
About 11,000 licensed vocational nurses, technicians and maintenance workers at 
Kaiser facilities in Los Angeles and Orange counties staged an eight-day 
walkout earlier this month.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MEDFLY FOUND IN AREA THAT HAS BEEN SPRAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Agriculture officials announced Monday the discovery of a Mediterranean fruit 
fly in a Downey neighborhood that has been repeatedly sprayed with malathion. 
</P>
<P>
The fly was trapped in a lemon tree in the 8000 block of Borson Street. 
</P>
<P>
A rash of Medflies have been discovered over the past month in areas bordering 
or just outside treatment areas. The number of finds has been distressing for 
officials, but they have maintained that the lack of fly discoveries within a 
malathion treatment area shows that the spraying has worked. The Downey fly was 
found one mile inside a spray zone. 
</P>
<P>
That area is scheduled for a 10th aerial spraying of malathion tonight. 
</P>
<P>
No decision has been made on what action will be taken in response to the new 
find. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, more than 400 square miles in 18 treatment zones across Southern 
California have been sprayed with malathion in the effort to wipe out the 
crop-destroying pest.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL DISTRICT HIT BY FRAUD; 3 ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three people have been arrested in connection with a fraudulent check-drafting 
scheme in which more than $9,000 was stolen from the Lynwood Unified School 
District, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the suspects, who were employed in the district's payroll division, 
allegedly used the district's computer to draft fraudulent pay checks, 
sheriffs' deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Five of nine fraudulent checks, amounting to $9,200, were cashed before the 
scheme was discovered, Detective William Winn said. Authorities also discovered 
uncashed checks totaling $8,500. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Miles, 23, who was a temporary worker in payroll, and Phyllis Bedford, 
30, a district employee for about two years, were arrested earlier this month 
and freed on $2,500 bail. 
</P>
<P>
It could not be determined if they are still employed by the district. A 
district official declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
The third suspect, Rodney Howerton, 29, a friend of Bedford, allegedly cashed a 
$2,000 check, Winn said. Howerton remains in jail on a parole violation. 
</P>
<P>
The scheme was uncovered after an employee became suspicious.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL BOARD TACKLES CUTS TO BALANCE BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles school board on Monday began the process of settling on more 
than $30 million in administrative cuts needed to balance next year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
As part of its effort to cut approximately $200 million from the district's 
almost $4-billion annual budget, the board last month directed Supt. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Britton to find ways to cut 15% of the district's central and regional 
administrative budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Britton has recommended cuts that trim up to 25% from some departments for a 
total of more than $36 million in reductions, including the loss of more than 
600 positions. The board debated the recommendations for nearly three hours 
Monday and will vote on a revised version on May 14. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the cuts are of clerical and support services, but many -- such as cuts 
in the bilingual program, the reduction of substitute hours and the loss of 
specialists in fields such as art, health education and agriculture -- will no 
doubt reach into the classroom.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MACLAINE INJURES KNEE, DELAYING COMEBACK 
TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shirley MacLaine suffered a knee injury during rehearsal of her song and dance 
revue and will have to undergo surgery, postponing her national comeback tour, 
including performances scheduled for this week in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"In rehearsal (Sunday) I tore a cartilage. 
</P>
<P>
Actually it was a reinjury from Seattle six weeks ago, " said MacLaine, 56, 
standing on crutches at a news conference at the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The actress, who has already performed her "Out There Tonight" song and dance 
revue in Seattle, San Francisco and Denver, was visibly upset over the injury, 
which postpones her return to the stage after a six-year absence. 
</P>
<P>
"Out There Tonight," scheduled to open at the Pantages Tuesday night, was first 
indefinitely postponed and then tentatively rescheduled for Aug. 28, said Dale 
Olson, a publicist for MacLaine. She is expected to perform locally for five 
weeks.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TOLEDO'S CITY MANAGER AGAIN GETS JOB OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pasadena Board of Directors decided Monday to again offer the city 
manager's post to Philip Hawkey, the Toledo, Ohio, city manager whose selection 
two weeks ago caused an outcry among some Pasadena minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkey, 43, was named in a complaint filed last year by the Ohio Civil Rights 
Commission against the city of Toledo. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint focused on the firing of housing fund director Pete Culp, who 
argued that he should have been permitted to take a demotion and remain with 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the objections raised locally, the Pasadena directors decided last 
week to reconsider hiring Hawkey. After examining commission documents for 
three hours in closed session Monday, the board concluded that the accusations 
of racism were unfounded, said Mayor William Thomson. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkey, in a telephone interview, said he plans to accept the job effective 
June 18, pending the outcome of contract negotiations.

DEFENSE CLAIMS IT WOULD BE A 'CRUEL HOAX' TO DENY HEARING TO HARRIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to prosecutors' claims that Robert Alton Harris should die, defense 
attorneys insisted Monday in a fat legal brief that the condemned murderer 
instead is due a hearing on his new claim that mental disorders drove him to 
kill two teen-age San Diego boys. 
</P>
<P>
Without that hearing, Harris' San Diego defense lawyers said, the federal 
Constitution's promise of a fair trial "will be a cruel hoax." 
</P>
<P>
The legal papers, filed late Monday with the San Francisco-based U.S. 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeals, were the last scheduled briefs ordered by the 
intermediate-level appellate court before it conducts oral argument May 14 on 
Harris' new claim. 
</P>
<P>
The papers, filed in response to a brief that state prosecutors filed last 
week, center on the same arguments that persuaded 9th Circuit Judge John T. 
Noonan to stay Harris' scheduled April 3 execution -- with only four days to 
spare -- to allow Harris' bid for a fact-finding hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, whose case has progressed farther through the court system than that of 
any of the other more than 270 prisoners on Death Row, had been in line to 
become the first person executed in California in 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, 37, was convicted and sentenced to death for the July, 1978, murders of 
Michael Baker and John Mayeski, both 16, of San Diego. He killed the boys after 
stealing their car for use in a bank robbery. 
</P>
<P>
The California Supreme Court upheld Harris' death sentence in 1981, and since 
then has consistently rejected his appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Although, in an April 2 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed Noonan's 
decision to block the execution indefinitely, it has rejected Harris' appeals 
four times, most recently on Jan. 16. 
</P>
<P>
In the new appeal, defense lawyers Charles M. Sevilla and Michael McCabe claim 
that Harris suffers from mental disorders -- including damage to the part of 
the brain that controls impulse -- that affected him and impulsively drove him 
through the killings. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Laurence of San Francisco, an ACLU attorney and death-penalty expert, 
also has taken part in the new appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence of those disorders, the lawyers said, was not presented to the jury 
that sentenced Harris to death in 1979 because the two psychiatrists who 
examined him did not do a good job. The jury should have heard that evidence, 
the attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
In the brief they filed last week, prosecutors said Harris' new contentions are 
"ridiculous" and urged a three-judge 9th Circuit panel to reject his challenge. 
If Harris' position were upheld, they said, the result would be "unending 
litigation to challenge the competence of previous (psychiatric) experts." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contended that Harris got what he had coming to him -- access to an 
examination by psychiatrists who were known to be competent. In the brief filed 
Monday, however, the defense attorneys repeated their claim that what he should 
have received, but did not, was a competent examination by each of the two 
psychiatrists. 
</P>
<P>
Without "some assurance that the psychiatrist will perform competently," 
defense lawyers said, "there can be no fair access." 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers also repeated their request that, should the 9th Circuit grant 
Harris a hearing, which would be held in federal court in San Diego, it be 
reassigned to someone other than U.S. District Judge William B. Enright. 
</P>
<P>
In ruling for the third time against Harris, Enright said last March that the 
defense team was "professionally not responsible" in bringing the new appeal. 
To ensure the "appearance of justice," the case should be reassigned, the 
defense lawyers said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The 9th Circuit panel that will hear oral argument in San Francisco consists of 
Noonan and Judges Arthur L. Alarcon and Melvin Brunetti.

GUARD UNIT BIDS FAREWELL; 
</P>
<P>
AIR BASE: THE CALIFORNIA AIR NATIONAL GUARD TURNS OVER ITS VAN NUYS AIRPORT 
HEADQUARTERS TO THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY LIBMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like the orange groves that once grew on its grounds and the bean fields that 
surrounded it, the Air National Guard base at Van Nuys Airport is no more. 
</P>
<P>
As two of its four-engined transport planes dipped to within 150 feet of the 
headquarters building on Balboa Boulevard in a farewell salute Monday, the 
146th Tactical Airlift Wing of the California Air National Guard lowered the 
U.S. and California flags and shut the base, turning it over to the city of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 spectators and thousands of passing motorists saw a color guard lower 
the flags and Col. Daniel H. Pemberton, the base commander, present a 
ceremonial key to Van Nuys Airport Manager Charles D. Zeman Jr., representing 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
"You will see a few misty eyes and a few people with a lump in their throats 
and I think I'll be one of them," Pemberton said as he relinquished the key. 
"But as the last in a long line of commanders, it's my lot to turn out the 
lights." 
</P>
<P>
Out of sight behind the headquarters, 15 guardsmen swept out two large hangars 
and hauled away empty barrels. Two large docks once used to hoist turbo-prop 
engines to repair their C-130 cargo planes stood quiet and empty. All phones 
and furniture had been removed from three floors of administrative offices. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony left the airport without a military presence for the first time 
since the Army commandeered what was then a privately owned airstrip only hours 
after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. 
</P>
<P>
After World War II, the federal government gave the airport to the city of Los 
Angeles, and the Air National Guard moved onto the former Army Air Force base 
in a Van Nuys that still contained many small farms. Then, some crops grew on 
the base. 
</P>
<P>
"We picked walnuts and oranges until we received our aircraft," said Andy 
Drysdale, 78, who had joined the National Guard in 1930, when the unit flew 
open-cockpit biplanes out of what is now Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
The wing operated medical evacuation flights that brought wounded soldiers home 
from Vietnam and in recent years flew supplies to American embassies and 
military missions in Central America. It also flies forest-fire fighting 
missions. 
</P>
<P>
It was nicknamed the "Hollywood Air Force" by other National Guard fliers and 
the regular Air Force, because of the actors in its ranks and because the base 
was used by producers of many movies and TV shows. Actor Kurt Russell and Jerry 
Mathers, who played the title role in television's "Leave it to Beaver," were 
members. The base appeared in "Raid on Entebbe," "The Six Million Dollar Man," 
"Call to Glory," "Firefox" and other shows. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1988, the 1,500-member wing -- the largest Air National Guard 
tactical airlift wing in the United States -- moved its 16 cargo planes to a 
new $75-million headquarters near the Navy's Pacific Missile Test Center at 
Point Mugu on the Ventura County coast, but until Monday had maintained offices 
at Van Nuys Airport and continued some repair and flying operations. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Guard began looking for a new home in the 1970s when heavy light-plane 
traffic at Van Nuys Airport made military-style flying too risky. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985 the Pentagon's $1-a-year lease on the base expired. The city Department 
of Airports, keenly aware that the city could earn millions of dollars a year 
by leasing out the 94-acre property, did not encourage the Guard to stay. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Airport Commissioners is scheduled to meet June 13 to 
consider a consultant's recommendation to build more than 1 million square feet 
of office and industrial space at the site. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's ceremony some of the unit's members said they welcomed the move to 
the new facilities, built to the National Guard's specifications. But the word 
"camaraderie" popped up repeatedly as many members said they would miss the 
spirit that permeated the Van Nuys base. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow members of the wing "are good friends, not only to military people but 
to everyone in the neighborhood," said Senior Master Sgt. Frank Santo of 
Thousand Oaks, who has been a Guard member since 1952. "They are people-helping 
people, no matter what the situation."

CANYON DEVELOPMENT FOES TAKE STAND -- ALONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opponents of a 26-home tract proposed for a wooded canyon in Studio City 
converged on the development site at dawn Monday, prepared to stand in front of 
bulldozers that they believed were en route to begin grading. 
</P>
<P>
The bulldozers, however, did not show up. The stand-off-that-wasn't provided 
only the latest quirk in a twisting land-use fight that has pitted a would-be 
luxury home builder against community activists, environmentalists and 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
The false alarm was a product of citizens' fears that developer Fred Sahadi 
would ignore a city stop-work order to begin construction on a tract he plans 
to build in Fryman Canyon, in Studio City west of Laurel Canyon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the work is started, it's started," said Judy Marx, one of eight 
environmental activists who came to protect the land Monday morning. "Our job 
is to stop that physically, to lie in front of bulldozers or to put ourselves 
in trees so that they would have to bodily harm us in order to do what they had 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
They were accompanied by representatives of City Councilman Mike Woo, state 
Assemblyman Terry Friedman (D-Los Angeles) and Rep. Howard L. Berman 
(D-Panorama City). 
</P>
<P>
Marx and other foes of the project said the canyon -- which has a perennial 
stream and is home to dozens of old-growth oak trees and many species of plants 
and animals -- is a critical link in the wildlife corridor. 
</P>
<P>
They want the canyon preserved and have appealed to the city Cultural Heritage 
Commission to designate the site a cultural monument as a remnant of the 
natural environment of the Santa Monica Mountains in the city. The commission 
is scheduled to consider the matter Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The city Department of Building and Safety two weeks ago issued a stop-work 
order prohibiting work on the site until the commission makes its decision. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Mayor Tom Bradley ordered that Sahadi be prohibited from starting 
any work until he completes all environmental studies required by the state 
Department of Fish and Game and the Army Corps of Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
But opponents of the project, who banded together as the Urban Wilderness 
Coalition, said they feared that Sahadi would ignore the order and try to begin 
work before his grading permit, issued in 1988, expired. 
</P>
<P>
The permit had been scheduled to expire at 5 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
Sahadi has refused to comment on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Sahadi is known in thoroughbred racing circles as half-owner of the state's 
largest horse breeding farm in Paso Robles and developer of a $13-million 
equine complex in Pomona. He acquired the canyon property two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
If a developer has begun grading when a permit expires, the permit is 
automatically extended for six months, said Tim Taylor, director of the city's 
Department of Building and Safety, which issues such permits. 
</P>
<P>
But if no work has been done, the developer must apply for an extension and the 
department may turn down the request, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
To ensure that no work began in the wooded ravine, foes of the project and 
government officials have monitored the 63-acre parcel daily, prepared to alert 
state Department of Fish and Game officials, who had promised to arrest anyone 
working at the site without state approval. 
</P>
<P>
The department must approve construction projects that disturb a waterway -- 
the canyon stream in this case. 
</P>
<P>
Fear of illegal work was aroused late Sunday afternoon when canyon neighbors 
sighted one of Sahadi's engineers talking to two surveyors. One of the 
residents said she overheard the engineer instruct the surveyors where to begin 
clearing brush and cutting trees, Marx said. 
</P>
<P>
She notified Marx, founder of the Urban Wilderness Coalition, who alerted 
members of her group. 
</P>
<P>
Marx said the group members will also be at the site this morning, the last 
morning before the permit is scheduled to expire. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said Sahadi has already applied for an extension of the permit, but that 
his request was denied. He can appeal the matter to the Board of Building and 
Safety Commissioners.

GIRL, 13, SHOT DOWN AS ON-THE-JOB SPAT ENDS WITH VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A "petty" on-the-job spat between two hospital workers escalated into a 
near-brawl on a Compton street late Sunday that ended when one of the nearly 20 
women and girls involved allegedly pulled a gun and fatally shot a 13-year-old, 
police and witnesses said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
By late Monday afternoon two of the women, both 19, had been arrested in the 
death of Shaquilla Birmingham. A third suspect was making arrangements with her 
attorney to surrender, police said. At least one other woman was being sought. 
</P>
<P>
Brenda Webb and Dolly Smith, both of Compton, were booked on suspicion of 
murder and were being held at the Sybil Brand Institute for Women. 
</P>
<P>
Shaquilla, of Los Angeles, was among two carloads of women and girls who 
earlier Sunday had gone to pick up Natasha Ashley, 23, from her job as a clerk 
at the Harbor UCLA Medical Center in Torrance, after Ashley argued briefly with 
a co-worker. Shaquilla apparently was brought along by an older woman, Ashley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The co-worker had left the hospital saying she was "going to get my homegirls," 
Ashley said. 
</P>
<P>
Ashley said she and her friends later were standing outside her home in Compton 
when the co-worker drove past, sped away, then returned with at least five 
other women in two cars. The two groups shouted at each other and some waved 
sticks, according to neighbors, before one of the women pulled out a handgun 
and opened fire, emptying the weapon. One shot struck Shaquilla in the upper 
body. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Ashley's neighbors said that before the shooting, several women in 
Ashley's group tried to break the windows in one of the cars that drove up. One 
man said he saw Shaquilla standing at the curb with a stick in her hand before 
she was shot. 
</P>
<P>
Ashley denied that any of the women in her group had sticks or other objects 
that could be used as weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Compton Police Detective Sgt. Barry Lobel said the information gathered by 
investigators indicated that Shaquilla may have been watching the altercation 
when she was shot. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said that the shooting stemmed from the argument and that someone 
got out of a car and fired several shots, one of which struck the young girl. 
</P>
<P>
But Lobel said authorities are still trying to sort out exactly what happened. 
</P>
<P>
The co-worker was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occured shortly before 8 p.m. Sunday at the intersection of East 
Palmer Street and Chestnut Avenue, a few hundred feet from Ashley's home on a 
street of neatly clipped lawns that neighbors described as normally quiet. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, neighbors peered at outsiders from behind locked security doors and 
shook their heads as they recalled the burst of violence. 
</P>
<P>
"There were several children out there playing on the sidewalk when it happened 
and they hit the ground," said a 56-year-old grandmother who did not want her 
name made public. "My daughter and my grandbaby were just coming around the 
corner. My daughter could be dead. My grandbaby could be dead." 
</P>
<P>
Ashley, who sat in her dining room Monday and talked about the argument that 
led to the shooting, described it as "petty." 
</P>
<P>
"I said something to (the co-worker) about this guy we knew and she asked me if 
I was having sex with him," recalled Ashley, who said she took offense at the 
remark and said so. 
</P>
<P>
The two then "had words," Ashley said, before the co-worker announced that she 
was going to get her friends. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her not to go and get trouble and start something she couldn't get out 
of, but she left anyway," said Ashley, who contends she decided to leave work 
early to avoid a confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
She said that before she could, however, the co-worker returned with two other 
women and challenged her to a fight. Ashley said she declined and that the 
confrontation ended without incident. 
</P>
<P>
Several hours later, she said, the co-worker and her friends drove to Ashley's 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Before the gunfire erupted, Ashley said, the six women repeatedly called her by 
name, urging her to step out into the street. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel so bad that that baby got killed over something she didn't know 
anything about," said Ashley.

PANEL URGES RUN-DOWN HOUSING BE RENOVATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOCELYN Y. STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A City Council committee Monday recommended approval of a program designed to 
help Los Angeles property owners renovate rather than demolish buildings that 
have been taken over by drug dealers and gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program -- described as a marriage between an earlier plan proposed 
by Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky and Mayor Tom Bradley's "Operation Knockdown" -- 
the city would buy vacant, deteriorated buildings and turn the properties over 
to nonprofit corporations. The corporations would repair the buildings and rent 
or sell them to moderate- and low-income tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Also under the program, homeowners who have been given an order to "repair or 
demolish" would get more information on available city loans and other options 
that could help them hang on to their property. 
</P>
<P>
The plan must still be approved by the full City Council, which is expected to 
review the matter within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the program is to try to address unnecessary demolition and at 
the same time reduce the blight of neighborhoods," said Michael Bodaken, the 
mayor's housing coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Bodaken heads a task force formed by the mayor to review Operation Knockdown, a 
program started in 1989 in which abandoned homes that had become havens for 
drug dealers and gang members were demolished. 
</P>
<P>
Operation Knockdown came under attack earlier this year after a Times article 
revealed that more than 200 deteriorating, low-income homes had been demolished 
in the city last year. Many of the buildings that were destroyed were not 
occupied by drug dealers but were salvageable housing located in poor areas 
with a shortages of housing, critics charged. 
</P>
<P>
After the article, Yaroslavsky called for a moratorium on demolitions and later 
proposed "Operation Rebuild" as an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"It's much cheaper to rehabilitate a house than to tear it down and start all 
over," said Katharine Macdonald, spokeswoman for Yaroslavsky. "The goal is to 
not deplete the available stock of affordable housing in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed program, which was approved Monday by the Community 
Redevelopment and Housing Committee, officials of the nonprofit corporations 
will work with homeowners facing "repair or demolish" orders. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the demolition last year was carried out by homeowners following city 
orders, who simply did not know what else to do, Bodaken said. 
</P>
<P>
"The city did not do a good job of informing them of their options," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bodaken said that through the program, which includes some elements of both 
Operation Knockdown and Yaroslavsky's Operation Rebuild, "we bring together the 
notion that you have to have enforcement and compassion." 
</P>
<P>
The enforcement end of the program will be conducted in part by volunteers from 
the County Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Those who are unwilling to work with the city will be targeted and located by 
the volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"They will bring the people in to court, where will they will once again be 
informed of the (assistance available). If that fails, we will ask for an 
injunction asking them to repair," Bodaken said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the city would first target people who live outside the area where the 
property is located. 
</P>
<P>
The six-month pilot program approved by the housing committee is expected to 
cost $2.5 million, but the amount could be increased depending on the success 
of the program, said a spokesman for Councilwoman Gloria Molina, who heads the 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
Funding would come through the Community Redevelopment Agency.

BROTHERS FINED $1.32 MILLION FOR PARTS SCHEME; 
</P>
<P>
JUDGMENT: THE AWARD MAKES RESTITUTION TO A NUCLEAR PLANT THAT BOUGHT OLD 
CIRCUIT BREAKERS LABELED AS NEW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two brothers whose San Fernando Valley businesses sold used circuit breakers 
labeled as new were ordered Monday to pay more than $1.3 million to cover the 
cost of temporarily closing an Arizona nuclear power plant while the electrical 
devices were removed. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Trevino, 39, of Rancho Santa Fe and Isidro Trevino, 37, of Granada Hills 
each were sentenced by U.S. District Judge Consuelo Marshall to serve three 
years probation, perform 100 hours of community service and pay a $5,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
They pleaded guilty in February to two felony counterfeiting charges for 
instructing their employees to label reconditioned, used circuit breakers as if 
they were new. 
</P>
<P>
The components were purchased by several power plants but apparently only 
installed at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station in Arizona, which 
supplies some electricity to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Palo Verde plant was shut down for more than 12 hours in October while the 
devices were replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Circuit breakers are designed to shut off power automatically to prevent fires 
or short circuits, but at Palo Verde they were being used as manual on/off 
switches, according to Greg Cook, a spokesman for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The Trevinos owned two companies -- California Breakers of North Hollywood and 
ATS Circuit Breakers Inc. of Burbank -- which are among six Southern California 
firms under investigation by the NRC and the U.S. attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Investigations of the other four firms is continuing, Cook said, and other 
sentences are anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
According to wire reports, Carlos Trevino told the judge Monday that he and his 
brother were only following industry practice by relabeling the reconditioned 
circuit breakers to make them appear new. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added: "Even though this was the industry practice, I realize this 
definitely was a problem. We've corrected it over the last 22 months." 
</P>
<P>
Cook disagreed with Trevino's contention that the counterfeiting was standard 
practice, although he said it had "spread through a number of companies in the 
electrical wholesaling business." 
</P>
<P>
"But it's one thing to recondition a breaker under very strict controls and to 
present it as such," he said. "It's another to pass it off as new." 
</P>
<P>
The $1.32-million restitution pays for labor costs incurred in closing the Palo 
Verde plant as well as for the plant's expense of buying power from other 
sources during the closure to prevent electrical brown-outs and other 
complications, Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
Because the breakers were being used as manual switches and were not expected 
to react automatically, Cook said, it was "relatively unlikely that there would 
have been a problem with them." 
</P>
<P>
NRC investigators became suspicious of the Trevinos' components in 1988, when 
testing done at the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power plant in San Luis Obispo found 
nearly all of their parts to be defective. 
</P>
<P>
Concurrently, a manufacturer of new circuit breakers had inquired about the 
devices the Trevino brothers sold to the Diablo Canyon plant, because the price 
paid by the plant was below that charged by the manufacturer.

SCHOOLS TIGHTEN CAP TEST SECURITY; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: LOS ANGELES DISTRICT OFFICIALLY ENDS ITS INVESTIGATION INTO CHEATING 
ALLEGATIONS. DISCIPLINARY ACTION WAS TAKEN AGAINST THOSE INVOLVED IN TAMPERING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District has officially ended its investigation 
into alleged cheating on the annual California Assessment Program tests, with 
the announcement of tightened security measures aimed at preventing a repeat of 
the scandal that rocked the district several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of a high number of erasures on student test booklets at several 
district schools in 1986, 1987 and 1988 led to an investigation of whether the 
tests had been tampered with by teachers seeking to inflate students' scores to 
improve their schools' standing. 
</P>
<P>
The questionable test results were invalidated, but no school district employee 
was ever publicly identified or disciplined for having altered tests. 
</P>
<P>
However, school board President Jackie Goldberg said Monday that appropriate 
action had been taken against employees involved in test tampering, but she 
would not say what actions were taken or identify the employees for fear of 
lawsuits against the district. 
</P>
<P>
Officials alleged that cheating had occurred at 40 schools statewide, including 
some in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The district opened its own investigation of the scandal, and hired a law firm 
to conduct a separate yearlong probe that resulted in the new security measures 
disclosed on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the investigations, officials said, was not so much to determine 
individual responsibility for the erasures but to help the district develop 
policies to prevent recurrences. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an exhaustive investigation and the board has taken the necessary 
action," Goldberg said. "I can assure you that should there be any indication 
of tampering in the future, people have been very firmly warned." 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg said the cheating that did take place was by teachers who do not 
believe in standardized testing and wanted their students to appear to perform 
well. 
</P>
<P>
The stiffer security measures include having two teachers in each classroom 
during testing, placing tests in sealed bags immediately after they are 
completed, and having the school principal or test coordinator supervise 
teachers who must check, correct or complete the student information part of 
student answer sheets. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers administering the tests also will be encouraged to attend training 
sessions, and answer sheets will not be allowed in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
Elementary and junior high schools across the state give the test each year to 
third-, sixth- and eighth-graders to measure the effectiveness of school 
districts -- not individual student performance -- in reading, writing and 
mathematics. The CAP scores are widely used by parents to judge the quality of 
their children's schools. 
</P>
<P>
Some educators have complained that state pressure to raise CAP scores may 
encourage some teachers and administrators to improperly coach students in 
preparing for the exams and, in some cases, to change answers.

BISHOP LEAVES HOSPITAL DETERMINED TO FIGHT CANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego Roman Catholic Bishop Leo T. Maher was released from Scripps Clinic's 
Green Hospital Monday morning, and promptly issued a statement saying he is 
determined to fight his brain cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Maher's release to convalesce at home came five days after surgery to remove a 
tumor from the 74-year-old prelate's brain. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of a private nurse, the bishop will recuperate in his Mission 
Hills home and will begin chemotherapy and radiation treatments within a week, 
said diocesan spokesman Dan E. Pitre. 
</P>
<P>
In his statement, as relayed by Pitre, Maher expressed gratitude for the 
"outpouring of prayers, good wishes and love from the people of the diocese, 
the whole community, as well as the people from the neighboring Mexican 
dioceses of Tijuana and Mexicali." 
</P>
<P>
He expressed "gratitude and appreciation to Almighty God" for the outpouring of 
prayers, which the bishop believes resulted in a "miraculous recovery" from the 
surgery, the diocese statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The bishop's administrative assistant, Elvia Aguilar, visited Maher and said he 
was in good spirits and is resting comfortably at home. 
</P>
<P>
The tumor was largely removed from the rear section of Maher's brain last 
Wednesday, Scripps Clinic doctors said late last week. However, it was a 
fast-growing "grade four" tumor that, even with aggressive therapy, often kills 
people within a year after diagnosis, they said.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY URGED TO SETTLE DANCER'S $250,000 SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Claims Board voted Monday to recommend paying $250,000 
to settle the lawsuit of a dance student who was disabled in a car crash on her 
way home from the Renaissance Pleasure Faire 14 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Debra Thompson was injured when her husband swerved off a two-lane road to 
avoid a head-on collision with another car while trying to pass other vehicles 
on a blind curve in April, 1976, said Lloyd Halstead, vice-chair of the claims 
board. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, who was 19 at the time of the accident, sued the county, alleging 
that cars leaving the fair were routed onto a road that should have been marked 
with signs warning motorists of the curve, and that the street should have been 
designated as a no-passing zone, Halstead said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident left Thompson unable to dance because one leg is now an inch 
shorter than the other, Halstead said. He said she incurred $108,000 in medical 
bills, and lost another $100,000 in wages as a result of the accident.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TENANT SHOT TO DEATH IN DISPUTE OVER DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Canoga Park man, angered by a demand that he pay for damaging an apartment, 
kicked open the apartment's door and shot the tenant to death in front of 
several witnesses, Los Angeles police reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Tyrone Lanier, 29, was shot several times in the upper body and died in his 
apartment in the 21800 block of Saticoy Street, Detective Rick Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses to the shooting at 10:45 p.m. Sunday identified the gunman as Robert 
James Jones, 27, Swanston said. Jones fled after the shooting and has not been 
found, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police were called to the apartment by neighbors who heard screaming and 
shooting, Swanston said. Detectives learned that Lanier and Jones had quarreled 
earlier over two women who were staying in Lanier's apartment, the detective 
said.

OVERCROWDED SCHOOL OPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The shocking contrast drawn between the work conditions of school 
administrators and teachers by teacher union President Wayne Johnson 
(California Commentary, April 16) is accurate, in my judgment. I, too, observe 
that school officials have large, lushly furnished, air-conditioned offices, 
free use of limousines and many entertainment and travel perquisites. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, teachers face run-down, hot, poorly equipped, overcrowded 
classrooms. They get little protection against students who threaten them both 
emotionally and physically. There are no "extras" for teachers. 
</P>
<P>
The public must demand an end to the disgraceful distinction between teachers 
and their bosses. New laws are needed to return the schools to parents. In this 
regard, parents should receive financial vouchers that they can redeem at 
schools of their choice for their children's education (extra amounts would be 
provided students with exceptional learning abilities or problems). 
</P>
<P>
The money that now goes to the bloated school bureaucracy then would be divided 
among individual schools or used to raise teachers' salaries. The reputation of 
a school thus could be based on how much its students learn, and not on how 
much its administrators are paid. 
</P>
<P>
The tragic irony of this situation is that the teachers' union is as vigorously 
opposed to the voucher plan and parental choice as are school administrators 
(who have everything to lose). The union apparently has a vested interest in 
complaining about teachers' salaries, but not in making it possible for parents 
to choose the schools their children will attend. Hence the need for direct 
action by the state Legislature to enact an educational voucher law.

NUCLEAR STATISTICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ralph Nader's Public Citizen group is clearly misusing nuclear plant statistics 
("Record Exposure of Workers to Radiation Cited -- and Disputed," Part A, April 
11). The data actually show that nuclear workers' average exposures are at an 
all-time low, while the electricity produced by these plants is at an all-time 
high. 
</P>
<P>
The Nader group's exaggerated claims of radiation exposures at nuclear plants 
is a vain attempt to derail this much-needed source of energy. 
</P>
<P>
As a radiation scientist who has worked at these plants, I would like to point 
out that nuclear workers receive relatively small amounts of radiation. The 
amount (390 units per year) is comparable to what the average American receives 
from natural sources (300 units). Natural sources include radioactive minerals 
in the soil and cosmic rays from outer space. This natural radiation is 
considered safe, and so is that received by nuclear workers.

BOB HOPE AGREES TO TRANSFER 5,700 ACRES FOR PARK SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With all due respect to Bob Hope, he just doesn't get it. Before we proclaim 
him a saint for having agreed to donate and sell some of his land to the state, 
we need to examine the downside of his would-be deal ("Hope Agrees to Transfer 
of Lands for Parks," Part A, April 20). 
</P>
<P>
The new agreement between Hope and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy is 
simply the latest counteroffer in negotiations that would result in a major 
development inside Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
This counteroffer is an attempt to 1) heal Hope's tarnished image, 2) bail out 
the fast-sinking plan of Potomac Investment Associates to develop Hope's Jordan 
Ranch, 3) restore the good name of the conservancy, which has signed off on the 
PIA development plan and 4) pressure the National Park Service to give away our 
public lands. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line remains the same: the public does not get fair value, and the 
national park will be degraded. PIA still plans a major golf course and luxury 
homes on Jordan Ranch. This development would harm the natural resources of not 
only the ranch, always viewed as a key tract for park service purchase, but 
adjoining Cheeseboro Canyon, as well. 
</P>
<P>
The Park Service can block this deal because PIA needs a piece of federal land 
to build a highway to Jordan Ranch. The mandate of the National Park Service is 
to protect our natural resources -- not to deal them away. Yet, under pressure 
from PIA, the park service is acquiescing in this plunder. Doing so would set a 
terrible precedent. 
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, this deal would constitute a raid on the federal 
treasury. The law requires that any lands exchanged be equal in value, and Park 
Service regulations direct that the contributory value of the exchanged land to 
the Jordan Ranch development be considered in its appraisal. But the value of 
the lands and money PIA plans to give the federal government do not approach 
the value of the proposed Jordan Ranch development. 
</P>
<P>
The peculiar postion of the conservancy should not go unnoticed. Last year its 
representatives told the Wilderness Society that no funds were available to 
purchase Jordan Ranch. Now, they suddenly have found $20 million to acquire 
some of Hope's lands that do not even lie within the boundaries of Santa Monica 
Mountains National Recreation Area. What gives? 
</P>
<P>
The Wilderness Society is working with Congress to stop this assault on our 
public lands. The more that members of Congress learn about this development 
plan, the more concerned they become. It is clear that the conservancy, the 
park service, and Bob Hope just don't understand what is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
What they need to do is so simple: Stop scheming on a way to build those luxury 
homes and the golf course inside the boundaries of a national recreation area.

The problem with the private land sale is the continued unbridled development 
of this area in the face of water shortages, traffic standstill, etc. -- and 
simply too few wild places left in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
We must applaud the conservancy deal, for then future generations will give 
thanks for more than just memories.

TAXES: WE'RE SPENDING HUGE SUMS FOR DEFENSE AGAINST FORMER FOES; A WOMAN 
SHIVERS IN THE NIGHT.

<TEXT>
<P>
Last month I paid my taxes. I sent a check to the Internal Revenue Service. 
Usually when I write a check -- especially one with two or more zeros -- I 
expect to get something nifty or necessary in return. So I started thinking 
about what I'm getting from my government in return for this enormous amount of 
money I'm sending them. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, I'm getting lots of guns and bombs and planes. Now, if I were 
living in Warsaw in 1939, this would be a terrific investment. But I'm not, and 
it isn't. I'm giving a little money to Nicaragua, a country that wouldn't need 
any money if it hadn't had to fight a 10-year war against us. I'm giving money 
to Panama, a country that wouldn't need any money if we hadn't invaded it and 
overthrown the government. I'm paying for SDI, a system designed to intercept 
incoming missiles from countries we're no longer enemies with. 
</P>
<P>
I'm paying for a "war" on drugs, because the military doesn't know who else to 
wage war on. This war has not made the streets safer or curbed drug use. I'm 
covering the bad investments made by savings-and-loan executives even though 
none of these guys gave me any money when one of my investments went bad. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sending money to Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Hungary, which is a 
nice idea, but, meanwhile, the trauma centers and emergency rooms in my city 
are closing. The public school in my neighborhood ran out of paper, notebooks, 
and erasers this semester. My branch of the public library has cut back its 
hours and staff. 
</P>
<P>
Our sewage treatment plant is clogged and bleeding into Santa Monica Bay. The 
air that I breathe is considered "unhealthful" most of the time. The water I 
drink comes from bottles. The routine medical bills my family incurs are 
staggering. 
</P>
<P>
A month ago, my doorbell range at 2:30 in the morning. I got up and yelled, 
"Who is it?" A woman's voice answered, "Can I have a jacket? I'm cold." I had 
an old jacket to give her, but I was afraid to open the door. So the woman 
spent the night cold, and I lay in bed wondering what, if anything, could break 
down the wall of fear that existed between me and that woman. Why couldn't my 
tax money be used to buy a coat for her?

PROGRAM HELPS FAMILIES CRIPPLED BY VIETNAM WAR

Bright-eyed 9-year-old Tanya Bills laughed and jumped so much that her mother 
had to shush her. 
</P>
<P>
Eight-year-old Winona Bartley crooned softly to herself. 
</P>
<P>
And Ireana Price, 12, waited quietly with her mother. 
</P>
<P>
The three children -- all with serious medical problems -- were at the 
Inglewood-based Children of Vietnam Veterans Assistance Program last week. 
</P>
<P>
They are clients of the first agency in Los Angeles County to receive a grant 
from the multimillion-dollar settlement of a historic class-action lawsuit on 
the effects of Agent Orange on Vietnam veterans and their children. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that Los Angeles County has the largest number of Vietnam veterans in 
the country, Dennis K. Rhoades, executive director of the private Agent Orange 
Class Assistance Program, said he expects to be awarding more grants in the Los 
Angeles area shortly. He was here last week from Washington to inspect the 
Inglewood program, which received $147,000. 
</P>
<P>
The grant program stems from a 1984 settlement of the lawsuit, which veterans 
won against seven chemical manufacturers after claiming that exposure to the 
defoliant in Vietnam resulted in medical problems for themselves and genetic 
defects in their children. 
</P>
<P>
Legal entanglements, including appeals, tied up the $240-million settlement. 
Only within the last two years have cash awards been paid to veterans. Besides 
those awards, 50 grants totaling $7.3 million from a $52-million fund were 
handed out to aid assistance programs for the veterans and their children. 
</P>
<P>
Other grants have gone to organizations aiding homeless veterans and a national 
hot line on developmental disabilities used by the Inglewood agency for 
referrals and information. The hot line number is (800) 922-9234 Ext. 401. 
</P>
<P>
In Inglewood, the $147,000 grant will enable the Children of Vietnam Veterans 
Assistance Program, which now serves 60 children, to expand so that some of the 
29 on the waiting list can be included. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which is run out of the Church of Religious Science in the 500 
block of North Market Street, provides evaluation, referral and counseling 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Most significant, there is no requirement that a veteran's child's problems be 
traced to Agent Orange exposure of the father. 
</P>
<P>
The parents of the three children who came last week were hoping for help, 
although none of the children's problems have been conclusively linked to Agent 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
The most disabled of the children was Winona Bartley, who is severely retarded, 
unable to walk or talk, and suffers from seizures and cerebral palsy, her 
mother, Winona Stephenson, said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her problems, a smile crossed the child's face at times. Winona's 
father, Ben Bartley, served in Vietnam in 1970. A neighbor put the family in 
touch with the assistance program. 
</P>
<P>
Ireana Price, who lives in southwest Los Angeles, has suffered intense stomach 
spasms, eczema, wheezing, and blood in her urine and feces. Her father was a 
Marine who spent 13 months in Vietnam during some of the worst fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Tanya Bills, a fourth-grader at Anza Elementary School in Torrance, was born 
with her left leg shorter than the right and has endured surgery and months of 
a stretching process to lengthen the leg. 
</P>
<P>
"It was going to be half the length of the other leg," her mother, Roxanne, 
said. The stretching added "about three inches in the last procedure," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The child's father, Michael Bills, a longshoreman who served near Da Nang in 
1969 and 1970, said he suffered memory loss after returning from Vietnam. He 
said he filed a claim, joining the Agent Orange lawsuit after his daughter was 
born. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether any of their other children had genetic problems, Tanya 
interrupted to say her 14-year-old brother Christopher had a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"What's his problem," her alarmed mother asked. 
</P>
<P>
"He hits me," the girl replied, giggling. "He doesn't share his candy that he 
buys, either."

PILLAR OF THE NEW EUROPEAN ORDER; 
</P>
<P>
NATO: IT IS NOT SIMPLY AN ALLIANCE AGAINST THREAT OR INTIMIDATION. IT IS A 
MODEL OF PARTNERSHIP AND A VISION OF A EUROPE OF PEACE IN FREEDOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MANFRED WOERNER, Manfred Woerner is secretary general of the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The prospect of war in Europe is at its lowest ebb in nearly 50 years. Risks 
remain, but the situation in Europe has evolved to the point where NATO's 
concept of political security is coming into its own. We have an opportunity to 
develop a new European architecture of peaceful cooperation that can deal with 
potential conflict as well. 
</P>
<P>
What remains important about the alliance? 
</P>
<P>
First and foremost, it has oriented the United States toward a lasting 
commitment to uphold peace and stability in Europe. The United States will 
maintain this commitment as long as the allies wish. 
</P>
<P>
Since its inception, NATO has become a model of how free nations broadly define 
and collectively manage their security. Within the alliance, former enemies 
have reconciled. All members enjoy equal security. 
</P>
<P>
The alliance's stabilizing framework extends to the neutral states of Europe. 
The emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe also recognize that 
without NATO they would not have recovered their independence. Only the 
alliance's collective security system can offset the preponderance of Soviet 
power in Europe and ensure that the relatively weaker feel confident vis-a-vis 
the relatively stronger. Without it, Europe would return to the shifting 
alliances and power politics of the past." 
</P>
<P>
One of the alliance's historic achievements has been to convert nuclear weapons 
into the ultimate instrument of peace-keeping. Since arms control can reduce 
but never disinvent nuclear weapons, Europeans would be well advised to retain 
the controlling structure that the alliance represents. 
</P>
<P>
NATO is not, of course, alone in striving to put in place the architecture of a 
future European order. But talking about one or another institution as the 
basis for the future misses the essential point: We must build on existing 
institutions and successes. The European community, for instance, is playing an 
important political role, not least in the economic reconstruction of Central 
and Eastern Europe. It is obviously the most attractive and dynamic European 
political organization. Yet despite its emerging political identity, it has no 
security dimension, nor will it acquire one for the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
The cohesion and stability at the heart of Western success are the result of 
NATO and the Economic Community. Building on this, the Conference on Security 
and Cooperation in Europe has a promising future in the new European order. Yet 
it lacks the legal authority of binding obligations, permanent institutional 
status and the machinery to resolve conflict. Given the differing values, 
interests and views of its 35 members, each with a veto right, it alone cannot 
guarantee security. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlantic Alliance thus remains an essential pillar of any future European 
security structure. Only it can keep the United States and Canada tied to 
Europe; ensure stability so that change can unfold without fear of reversals; 
coordinate overall Western strategy for the reconstruction of Central and 
Eastern Europe, and make sure that a united Germany remains firmly anchored to 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
The alliance, in meeting its challenge of extending security without 
diminishing it, will face three tasks in the 1990s: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Building a new European order that is not only more just but also more 
durable than that created by the Cold War. The demise of the Warsaw Pact and 
its military threat and the imminent prospect of German unity have 
fundamentally changed the terrain. We are already adjusting, militarily and 
politically, to this new environment. 
</P>
<P>
By supporting Mikhail S. Gorbachev so long as he moves the Soviet Union toward 
democracy and reform, the allies are proving that they do not intend to exploit 
Soviet weakness. The allies will respect the legitimate security interests of 
the Soviet Union in Europe so that it can confidently embrace reform. NATO is 
also offering a united Germany membership in the alliance, making the Germans' 
inherent right of self-determination compatible with stability in Europe. It is 
in the Soviet interest as much as that of Germany's neighbors and partners. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the alliance will spur the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe, speed up the establishment of democratic institutions 
and promote respect for human and minority rights and the rule of law. 
Additionally, it will use the conference as a means to tear down barriers to 
human, cultural and economic exchanges across Europe's vanishing line of 
division and to promote economic progress in the East. 
</P>
<P>
The alliance is stimulating arms-control negotiations to make the ebbing of 
East-West confrontation an irreversible process. If we can bring the states of 
Europe to cooperate on their vital security interests, the Europeans will find 
it much easier to cooperate on everything else. An agreement on reducing 
conventional forces, which we hope to secure this year, is the indispensable 
foundation of a new European architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Maintain a secure peace. Our defense structure will continue to be the main 
guarantee of peace as well as the vehicle for crisis management. War at the 
close of the 20th Century is so potentially catastrophic that we cannot take 
its prevention less seriously merely because it is now less probable. 
</P>
<P>
But conflict cannot be prevented by arms control or diplomacy alone. 
Developments in the Soviet Union are unpredictable. Conventional disarmament 
must not obscure the fact that the Soviet Union is still a nuclear superpower. 
Although the Soviets are following through on their promised unilateral 
reductions in troops and armor, they have restructured their remaining forces. 
We must also remember that the collapse of the Soviet imperium has stirred both 
regional tensions and nationalism throughout much of the Soviet Union and 
Central and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 -- NATO must ensure the partnership between North America and an increasingly 
self-aware and politically unified Europe, while managing all the complexities 
of their relationship. Erosion of the transatlantic linkage will leave all of 
us worse off, including our partners to the East. 
</P>
<P>
NATO is not simply an alliance against threat or intimidation. It is a model of 
partnership, success and a vision of a Europe of peace in freedom. Today's 
historical developments allow us, finally, the prospect of realizing this 
vision, to move beyond confrontation to cooperation.

SANDAG REJECTS PROJECT IN AIRPORT FLIGHT PATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Exercising new authority to halt development near Lindbergh Field for the first 
time, the San Diego Assn. of Governments has blocked plans for a $12.5-million 
medical office building in the airport's approach path. 
</P>
<P>
The regional government agency rejected the proposed Harborview Medical 
Building at 220 Elm St. Friday, ruling that the project would exceed occupancy 
limits designed to minimize the number of deaths and injuries in case of an 
airliner crash. 
</P>
<P>
A decision on a second project that would have exceeded the safety standard, a 
$58.5-million, eight-story, mixed-use development known as Hay Plaza, was 
postponed to allow developers and Sandag staff members to discuss occupancy 
calculations. 
</P>
<P>
Normally an advisory agency, Sandag acquired authority over land-use decisions 
around Lindbergh and five other county airports Jan. 1, under state legislation 
that gave such regional government agencies oversight for airports without city 
land-use plans. 
</P>
<P>
The city of San Diego has no land-use plan for the area around Lindbergh, 
though one should be completed within six months, said Jack Koerper, Sandag's 
special projects director. Sandag is also overseeing land-use decisions for the 
areas around Fallbrook, Ramona, Ocotillo Wells, Agua Caliente and Jacumba 
airports, Koerper said. 
</P>
<P>
Since Jan. 1, Sandag has approved about 150 land-use proposals for the area 
near Lindbergh, Koerper said. 
</P>
<P>
Sandag staffers calculate that the 9-story Harborview medical building would 
hold 2,393 people per acre, far more than the 918 people per acre allowed under 
one of the safety regulations that Sandag is following, Koerper said. 
</P>
<P>
But James P. O'Neil, attorney for Harborview's developers, argued that the 
staffers "deliberately chose not to consider the portion of the site that 
contains the parking garage," an interpretation that would have sharply reduced 
the occupancy per acre statistic, he said.

ANGELS: ANDERSON HITS AWAY INSTEAD OF BUNTING, GIVING BALTIMORE A 2-1 VICTORY 
IN 12 INNINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

BALTIMORE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The situation screamed for a bunt. 
</P>
<P>
The Baltimore Orioles, hard-pressed to do anything against Kirk McCaskill and 
Mike Witt, put runners on first and second with none out in the bottom of the 
12th inning Monday. Brady Anderson, a left-handed hitter, batted for Sam Horn, 
also a lefty. Angel first baseman Wally Joyner crept in, expecting the logical 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a reason they pinch-hit Brady Anderson," Joyner said. "I'm in a little 
bit looking for a bunt, and he hits a high hopper off my glove. Was it 
catchable (if he were at normal depth)? Oh, yeah. I'm sure he had one practice 
swing and if he missed it, he was going to bunt." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson didn't miss the first-pitch fastball from Witt, lining it off Joyner's 
glove and into right field to give the Orioles a 2-1 victory over the 
frustrated and rueful Angels. 
</P>
<P>
"It fooled everybody," catcher Lance Parrish said. "With them pinch-hitting for 
Sam, I figured he was coming up there bunting all the way. But he didn't. 
Ninety-nine times out of 100, you expect a bunt in that situation. You want to 
get somebody to third with less than two outs. I guess Frank (Robinson, 
Baltimore's manager) had something else up his sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a bunt situation, real late in the game, nobody out. I'm sure most 
people would be thinking bunt." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels were thinking about the many times they came close to making plays 
that might have enabled them to win. 
</P>
<P>
There was Joyner, moving in for a bunt that never happened. 
</P>
<P>
Starter McCaskill, whose 8 1/3-inning, eight-strikeout outing was easily his 
best of the season, couldn't savor his performance because his stab at Horn's 
seventh-inning shot was unsuccessful, the ball going up the middle and scoring 
Craig Worthington from second base with the tying run. 
</P>
<P>
"I should have had it. I just didn't see it that well off his bat," said 
McCaskill. "It's kind of dark between home plate and the mound and it came back 
so fast. It was a little harder hit than I thought. It was pretty much right 
under my glove. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't say should have -- could have." 
</P>
<P>
The same applies to the long fly ball Parrish hit in the eighth. It could have 
gone over the fence and given the Angels a 3-1 lead, but center fielder Steve 
Finley leaped and reached behind the fence to catch the ball. "It was high 
enough that I could get back to the wall and time my jump," Finley said. "I 
didn't think it was going to go so far." 
</P>
<P>
Those "could haves" added up to a loss for the Angels, their fourth in five 
games, seventh in 10 on this trip and ninth in their last 12 games. It was a 
difficult night all around, but for no one more than Manager Doug Rader, who 
announced after the game that reliever Willie Fraser had been optioned to 
triple-A Edmonton to reduce the roster to 25. 
</P>
<P>
Fraser, who was 0-1 with an 11.81 earned-run average in 5 1/3 innings this 
season, will become a starter to get the remedial work he needs in Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
"You figure it goes over the fence, it should be a home run," Parrish said of 
his eighth-inning fly ball. "I was trying to talk it out, but it didn't make 
it. I've seen guys make catches like that on highlight films, and you hate to 
see it happen to you. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We had opportunities to win this. We hit some balls good and got ourselves in 
position to get runs across. But they made good plays or we hit them right at 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Witt pitched 2 2/3 perfect innings before the 12th, taking his third loss in as 
many decisions, small consolation. "I was surprised (by the decision not to 
bunt)," he said. "I would think they'd try to get a runner and bunt him over so 
they'd have a guy on third. It was a freaky game, a freaky play." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels scored their run in the third inning off starter Bob Milacki. Kent 
Anderson lined a double between third baseman Worthington and the bag, moved to 
third on Max Venable's sacrifice back to Milacki and scored on Joyner's 
sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill was relieved by Witt after issuing a one-out walk to Joe Orsulak in 
the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
"This was my best game, in all ways," McCaskill said, "except we didn't win." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Brian Downing, squeezed out of the lineup by Sunday's acquisition of Luis 
Polonia from the New York Yankees, may be near the end of his Angel career. 
</P>
<P>
"If I would have known this during the offseason, I would have retired," said 
the 40-year-old designated hitter, who is hitting .186 in 12 games. "I'll just 
stand here and wait for the ax to fall, pure and simple. . . . I think the best 
thing for me is not to overreact and kind of hang loose for a while and see 
what happens." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's series finale is back to its original 4:30 p.m. (PDT) starting 
time. The Orioles had agreed to start an hour earlier to give the Angels a head 
start on making a red-eye flight to Seattle for Thursday's makeup game, but 
ESPN wouldn't permit the time change because the game is the backup to its 
national telecast. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Mark Langston had an interesting breakfast appointment today: He was 
invited to the White House to meet President Bush and participate in "The Great 
American Workout," an event designed to promote physical fitness. "I'm really 
excited," said Langston, who was invited by actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. "It 
should be fun." 
</P>
<P>
Second baseman Johnny Ray received a cortisone injection in his right shoulder 
to ease his bursitis. He was not available to play Monday but is expected to be 
available today. X-rays on catcher John Orton's shoulder were negative but 
Orton, who injured his left shoulder while sliding into home Sunday, didn't 
play Monday. "I could catch, but I can't hit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
X-rays of reliever Bryan Harvey's swollen right hand were normal, leaving the 
swelling and cramping between his fourth and fifth metacarpals unexplained. He 
is free to pitch as long as he's not in pain. . . . Reliever Bob McClure, still 
disabled by a sore left elbow, did 15 minutes of soft throwing Monday and is 
waiting to see how his arm feels today before continuing his workouts. . . . 
Kent Anderson has bicep tendinitis but is able to play. 
</P>
<P>
Polonia, acquired Sunday from the New York Yankees in exchange for Claudell 
Washington and Rich Monteleone, is expected to join the Angels today. Manager 
Doug Rader said Polonia will start, but Rader is not yet sure whether Polonia 
will play left field or be the designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Ned Bergert for the first time established a timetable for the return 
of shortstop Dick Schofield, who has been on the disabled list since April 1 
because of a strained right hamstring. He said Schofield might be ready to play 
in two weeks, but cautioned that his estimate wasn't "etched in stone."

A VICTORY -- GUARANTEED;

PRO BASKETBALL: NO, IT ISN'T PAT RILEY. IT'S DON CHANEY, WHOSE ROCKETS ARE DOWN

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coaches have been known to make brash predictions for motivational purposes 
when circumstances call for something drastic. Sometimes, the bleaker the 
situation, the wilder the claim. 
</P>
<P>
Don Chaney, whose Houston Rockets are a loss away from elimination in the first 
round of the NBA playoffs, has borrowed an old motivational gimmick from Laker 
Coach Pat Riley, guaranteeing the Rockets will beat the Lakers tonight in Game 
3 and Game 4 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We definitely will win both games at home," Chaney told the Houston Chronicle 
Sunday, after the Rockets had lost their second consecutive game in the 
best-of-five series. "I guarantee it. There's no doubt about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really think the pressure is on us. I think the pressure is on them 
because we're going home to a place where we're comfortable and we know we can 
win. They still have to get one more win, and I think it's going to comedown to 
the last game in L.A.(Game 5)." 
</P>
<P>
Monday, while the Lakers watched videotape not 50 feet away in the visitors' 
locker room at the Summit, Chaney softened his words a little but still 
predicted two Rocket victories. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, did I use guarantee? Maybe it was a slip of the tongue," Chaney said, 
laughing. "Of course, we all know nothing is guaranteed. But that gives you an 
idea of how positive we are. We know we can win in our building. . . . It 
should be two very good games, with us getting two wins. Then, in a Game 5 
situation, anything can happen. 
</P>
<P>
"(The Lakers) will have to come in and take a win on the road. That's what I 
mean by pressure. I don't think the confidence level is as high. I'm not 
slighting the Lakers at all. But what I was saying is the pressure is not on 
who people think it's on." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said he interpreted Chaney's remarks as more of a challenge to the 
Rockets than a knock on the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think sometimes you have to put some pressure on your players like that," 
Riley said. "When you're a pro, sometimes you lay it on the line. It's like the 
Rockets are saying, 'We're at home now. We're going to tell (the Lakers) 
exactly what we're gonna do.' Don's a class guy. I know he wasn't slighting the 
Lakers." 
</P>
<P>
Laker players did not react angrily. Mychal Thompson, who deals in hyperbole 
daily, applauded Chaney's effort. 
</P>
<P>
"I like that kind of spunk in a coach," Thompson said. "I like that (Chaney) 
has his team so positive. Of course, I don't agree with what he said, but . . . 
" 
</P>
<P>
Said Magic Johnson: "That's up to (Chaney) to say. He's trying to get his team 
going. We'll see what happens. We feel confident coming in here." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Chaney's optimism is not without foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Twice during the regular season, the Lakers were beaten badly by the Rockets at 
the Summit. On Nov. 28, the Lakers trailed by 15 points at halftime and lost by 
six. On March 6, they were blown out, 112-95, but played without guard Byron 
Scott. 
</P>
<P>
In the playoff opener Friday night, the Rockets led by 13 points in the first 
half, but the Lakers won by 11. In Game 2 on Sunday, Houston led by as many as 
19 points -- 17 at halftime -- but the Lakers again fought back to win, 
104-100. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Laker comebacks might have been extraordinary, their overall play 
has been ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
The Rockets have stayed competitive despite only 24 points in two games by 
center Akeem Olajuwon. They have done it with Vernon Maxwell's bump-and-grind 
defense on Magic Johnson and strong offensive production from Maxwell and guard 
Sleepy Floyd and forwards Otis Thorpe and Buck Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
But the Lakers have won, thanks largely to massive offensive doses of James 
Worthy, who has averaged 33 points and made 69% of his shots. In addition, 
Johnson has averaged 20 points and 14 assists, despite Maxwell's defense, and 
there has been strong defensive post play from Thompson and Vlade Divac. 
</P>
<P>
Riley said he is not disappointed with the Lakers' play. He is slightly 
concerned about falling behind early, but he credits the Rockets, rather than 
blaming the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to be easy for us or anybody," Riley said. "I think the feeling 
that -- because the Rockets were 20 games worse than us in the regular season, 
that's irrelevant. We've learned at this time of year it's 48 minutes to win." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Rocket Coach Don Chaney used taller, slower Otis Thorpe in place of Buck 
Johnson on James Worthy in the fourth quarter of Sunday's game. It slowed 
Worthy's offensive production somewhat. Chaney said he might have Thorpe guard 
Worthy at strategic junctures in tonight's game. "We have not conquered James 
Worthy yet," Chaney said. "To be honest with you, no, I didn't think he was 
this good. But in the playoffs, he just gets better. He's been the key factor." 
</P>
<P>
A segment of CBS's halftime show on Sunday featured an interview with Akeem 
Olajuwon in which the Rocket center said he wants to win a championship either 
in Houston or elsewhere and suggested a trade might be best. The interview, it 
turned out, was taped two months ago, after Olajuwon had first made a trade 
request in the local newspapers. CBS, however, did not mention that it was an 
old interview. 
</P>
<P>
"It was old, very old," Olajuwon said. "It is all in the past." Still, the 
interview prompted interest among Rocket and Laker players Sunday. Said Magic 
Johnson: "If (the Rockets) don't want him, tell them to ship him over here, any 
time, any day. Matter of fact, if they do, I'd play 10 more years. That's a 
guarantee."

MORNING BRIEFING: THIS ONE IS GUARANTEED FOR GOOD HORSE LAUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Kentucky Derby is upon us again, bringing to mind the story about the 
Brooklyn Dodgers and their desperate search for talent during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
At one spring camp, a horse walked up to Manager Leo Durocher and said, 
"Understand you need ballplayers. Can you use a .480 hitter?" 
</P>
<P>
"Are you kidding," Durocher said. "Grab a stick." 
</P>
<P>
The horse stepped into the batting cage, and Durocher threw him five pitches. 
All five were hit out of the park. 
</P>
<P>
"You can hit," Durocher conceded, "but how about fielding?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a great shortstop," the horse said. 
</P>
<P>
Durocher sent him out to short and hit him some grounders. The horse fielded 
them all effortlessly. 
</P>
<P>
"All right," Durocher said, "now let's see you run the bases." 
</P>
<P>
"Run?" said the horse. "If I could run, I wouldn't be here. I'd be in the 
Kentucky Derby." 
</P>
<P>
Add Derby: Then there's the one about the couple who stood before the divorce 
judge. The wife said: "Your honor, my husband isn't interested in me. All he 
talks about from morning to night is horses. He doesn't even remember our 
wedding day." 
</P>
<P>
Said the husband: "That's a lie. We got married the day Foolish Pleasure won 
the Kentucky Derby." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who is the only man to ride and train winners in the Kentucky 
Derby? 
</P>
<P>
Quick fix: After going hitless in three at-bats Saturday in a loss to UCLA, USC 
outfielder Mike Robertson went to assistant coach Bill Hughes and said, "I'd 
like to take some early batting practice tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
"Be there at 9:30," said Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson was. That afternoon, he went four for four with two home runs and 
five RBIs as the Trojans beat the Bruins, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Homecoming: As the last player taken in the draft, tight end Demetrius Davis of 
the Raiders will be treated to a round of festivities by the Balboa Bay Club at 
Newport Beach during Irrelevant Week starting June 24. Among the treats will be 
a night at a casino in Reno. 
</P>
<P>
Davis is from Nevada Reno. 
</P>
<P>
Add irrelevance: This is the 15th Irrelevant Week. It was the brainchild of 
former USC and San Francisco 49er end Paul Salata. The motto is: "Irrelevant 
Week Means Doing Something Nice for Someone for No Reason." The award for the 
nonorees is the Lowsman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
Out of the can: From Montreal pitcher Oil Can Boyd: "The most important thing 
for me to do is to go out and do what I like to do, and that's harmonate. 
Everything else is irrelevant." 
</P>
<P>
He then went out and harmonated the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Johnny Longden rode Count Fleet in 1943 and trained Majestic 
Prince in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Hall of Fame outfielder Duke Snider, on baseball's inflated 
salaries: "Man, if I made a million dollars, I would come in at 6 in the 
morning, sweep the stands, wash the uniforms, clean out the offices, manage the 
team and play the game." HARLEY TINKHAM

UCLA was stunned and USC pleasantly surprised when pairings were announced 
Monday for the NCAA men's volleyball final four this weekend at George Mason 
University in Fairfax, Va. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins expected to gain an at-large bid because they advanced to the final 
of Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. tournament last Saturday, where 
they lost to Cal State Long Beach in five games. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach, as the tournament champion, earned an automatic bid to the final 
four. 
</P>
<P>
USC was eliminated earlier by Long Beach, and Trojan Coach Jim McLaughlin 
thought that all but ended his team's chances. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, based on tournament precedent, figured they would get a bid. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a team meeting to review the (WIVA championship) match at Northridge 
and prepare for the finals next week," UCLA Coach Al Scates said. 
</P>
<P>
Then he heard from Robert Newcomb, chairman of the NCAA men's volleyball 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'I have some bad news for you. You're not going, USC is.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, winners of 13 national championships in 15 appearances in the final 
four, will not go to the final four for only the sixth time in 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
"They were stunned because, since 1970, the NCAA has always taken the team that 
finished highest in our postseason competition, and have never gone back and 
taken a team that was eliminated in an earlier round of the postseason 
competition," Scates said. "And I had assumed going in that the team that made 
the final round would make the NCAAs, as they had done in the previous 20 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Newcomb was not available to comment on the selection process. 
</P>
<P>
Both USC and UCLA have 23-5 records, but USC defeated UCLA in both meetings 
this season -- March 2 in a league match at UCLA and April 7 in the final of 
the UCLA Invitational. The Trojans also finished the regular season ranked No. 
2 in the coaches' poll. The Bruins were No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Still, McLaughlin said: "I was a little surprised. Right after we lost to Long 
Beach, when we got back in the locker room I told the guys: 'Meet for team 
meetings Monday. There's a small chance we can go, but as far as I'm concerned 
right now, the season's over.' " 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach (27-6), ranked No. 1 and competing in its first final four since 
1973, will meet Rutgers Newark (27-14) in one of two matches Friday night. The 
Trojans will play Ball State (27-10) in the other. The winners play for the 
championship Saturday.

out of the dinner when she was reprimanded by a tour official.

CLIPPERS FINE GRANT FOR PUSHING WRITER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clipper guard Gary Grant has been fined an undisclosed amount by the team and 
ordered to apologize to Times sportswriter Scott Howard-Cooper in the aftermath 
of an April 21 locker-room altercation between the two. 
</P>
<P>
Grant, after the Clippers' final game of the season, put his hand on 
Howard-Cooper's face and shoved him backward after accusing Howard-Cooper of 
not writing about an off-season charity tennis event Grant had planned. 
</P>
<P>
Howard-Cooper had written about the event, but the item was edited out of his 
story. 
</P>
<P>
"Elgin Baylor reached Grant by telephone Friday and informed him of the fine 
and directed him to phone Howard-Cooper as soon as possible and apologize," 
Bill Kreifeldt, Clippers' director of public relations, said.

Richie Adubato, coach of the Dallas Mavericks, thinks an NBA referee has a 
"personal vendetta" against guard Derek Harper. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like Hue Hollins has given Derek a technical in every game he 
officiates," said Adubato, after Harper was charged with a technical Saturday 
night during Dallas' 114-107 playoff loss at Portland.

TRIPLE CROWN RATINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
REMARKS: Neil Howard, who trains Summer Squall, the likely favorite in the 
Kentucky Derby, is arguably the most nervous trainer in the race Saturday. The 
one with the least anxiety might be Frank Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
Killer Diller, winner of the Garden State Stakes in his last start, is 
Alexander's horse. Killer Diller will be one of the longshots in the 116th 
Derby, and Alexander likes that role just fine. "If I had a 1-5 shot, I 
wouldn't even be standing here -- I'd be hiding," Alexander said to a few 
reporters in front of Killer Diller's barn at Churchill Downs. "Just being here 
with this horse is a thrill to me. Anything we get is a bonus." 
</P>
<P>
Killer Diller is owned by Barry Schwartz, Calvin Klein's partner in the 
clothing business. The colt is named after Barry Diller, the movie executive 
and a friend of Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
Although Pleasant Colony, winner of the 1981 Derby, has sired two of the 
starters in this year's race -- Killer Diller and Pleasant Tap -- neither colt 
is given much chance. Pleasant Tap missed about a week of training at Keeneland 
because of a fever, and his second-place finish in the Lexington last week was 
only his third race of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Killer Diller ran four times last year without winning, won a maiden race at 
Aqueduct after turning 3 and has two wins and a second in his last four starts. 
</P>
<P>
The colt's disposition does not match his name. "He doesn't have that killer 
instinct," Alexander said. "I think that will come in time. But right now, he's 
like a puppy dog. You get a 5-year-old kid and he'd be able to walk him around 
the track." 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Bruin, who rides Killer Diller, is one of five jockeys making their first 
appearance in a Derby. The others are Nick Santagata (who will ride Dr. Bobby 
A.), Dave Penna (Shot Gun Scott), Ron Hansen (Video Ranger) and Shane Sellers 
(Fighting Fantasy). 
</P>
<P>
Sellers wasn't named until late Monday. Fighting Fantasy, the winner of the 
Nash Handicap at Sportsman's Park in his last start, has been ridden by five 
jockeys in his 12 races. Sellers, who rode him in the Nash, will be aboard 
Saturday. Sellers got the mount after two New York jockeys, Jacinto Vasquez and 
Chris Antley, told trainer John Churchman that they have other commitments. 
</P>
<P>
Penna's first Derby appearance is in jeopardy because of the way Shot Gun Scott 
has been training in Kentucky. Shot Gun Scott was able to beat Unbridled, the 
Florida Derby winner and one of the upset possibilities in the Kentucky Derby, 
before they left Florida. But after finishing fourth in the Blue Grass at 
Keeneland on April 14, Shot Gun Scott started coughing. The coughing has 
subsided, but he's still training lethargically and trainer Ron Sarazin won't 
know until entry time on Thursday whether he'll start him. 
</P>
<P>
If Shot Gun Scott runs, the field will be 17 horses. The others are Summer 
Squall, Mister Frisky, Silver Ending, Unbridled, Thirty Six Red, Killer Diller, 
Dr. Bobby A., Country Day, Fighting Fantasy, Pleasant Tap, Video Ranger, the 
Bobby Frankel-trained entry of Burnt Hills and Pendleton Ridge, and the Wayne 
Lukas-trained trio of Land Rush, Real Cash and Power Lunch. 
</P>
<P>
There are four more training days before the Derby, but the 3-year-olds have 
finished most of their work and the field can be broken down into these 
categories. 
</P>
<P>
Horses trying to retain their form -- Mister Frisky, Summer Squall. 
</P>
<P>
Horses that may be peaking -- Land Rush, Silver Ending, Thirty Six Red. 
</P>
<P>
Horses that need to improve -- Real Cash, Unbridled, Video Ranger. 
</P>
<P>
Horses trying to catch up -- Burnt Hills, Shot Gun Scott, Pleasant Tap. 
</P>
<P>
Horses overreaching -- Country Day, Dr. Bobby A., Fighting Fantasy, Killer 
Diller, Power Lunch, Pendleton Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
Advisory panel for The Times' Triple Crown Ratings: Lenny Hale, vice president 
for racing at Aqueduct, Belmont Park and Saratoga; Frank (Jimmy) Kilroe, vice 
president for racing at Santa Anita; and Tommy Trotter, racing secretary at 
Arlington International Racecourse and Gulfstream Park.

Jockey Club as a foal of 1987, and racing's bookkeeping organization knows him 
as Pendleton Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
Around Churchill Downs, where the 116th Kentucky Derby will be run Saturday, 
Pendleton Ridge is more likely to be called "the maiden." 
</P>
<P>
It's not a term of affection, more one of derision. There are a lot of maidens 
on the grounds, and for today's program, Jerry Botts, the racing secretary, has 
written three races exclusively for them. 
</P>
<P>
But a maiden in a Kentucky Derby is a hobo in a tuxedo. There hasn't been a 
maiden in the Derby since 1979, when Great Redeemer, winless in six starts, ran 
last, reaching the finish line so belatedly he almost trampled a group of 
photographers trying to cross the track. 
</P>
<P>
Maidens have won the Derby. The first was Buchanan, in 1884. Sir Barton won as 
a maiden in 1919 and went on to sweep the Triple Crown. Brokers Tip, the final 
maiden to win the Derby, in 1933, never won another race, finishing his career 
with one victory in 14 starts. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Derby has Pendleton Ridge, who not only is a maiden, but who also is 
trying to win after not having raced as a 2-year-old. The last unraced 
2-year-old to win the Derby was Apollo in 1882. 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton Ridge is unseasoned, besides being winless. He finished second by 
three-quarters of a length at Santa Anita on March 18. He was second again, by 
a nose, at Aqueduct on April 8. In his only other start, the Wood Memorial at 
Aqueduct, he ran fourth but closed a lot of ground and was only 1 3/4 lengths 
behind the winner, Thirty Six Red, at the wire. Thirty Six Red is given a good 
chance to upset the co-favorites, Summer Squall and Mister Frisky, in the 
Derby, but he has won stakes in his last two starts and has 11 races worth of 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
"This horse belongs," Frankel said of Pendleton Ridge. "The distance won't 
bother him. He was too close (to the pace) in the Wood. I'd like to see him 
farther back in the Derby." 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton Ridge has had a different jockey in each race, and Laffit Pincay will 
ride him for the first time Saturday. He replaces Richard Migliore, who rode 
the colt in the Wood. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm inexperienced, and the other jock (Migliore) is inexperienced," Frankel 
said. "At least we got one guy (Pincay) who's experienced." 
</P>
<P>
Migliore has ridden in only two Derbies, finishing 11th and 12th, and Frankel, 
48, has never saddled a Derby starter in his 24-year training career. Pincay 
has ridden in 16 Derbies, winning with Swale in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Frankel bought Pendleton Ridge at a Hollywood Park auction for $160,000. The 
son of Cox's Ridge and Space Angel races in the name of Bruce McNall, the owner 
of the Kings; Wayne Gretzky and Craig Stadler, the golfer. The owners are 
expected to attend the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton Ridge didn't race as a 2-year-old because he chipped a bone in his 
left front ankle and underwent arthroscopic surgery. He rejoined Frankel's barn 
in December at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Frankel is starting two horses in the Derby and, although Burnt Hills, his 
other horse, has form more befitting a contender, the attention has shifted 
toward the maiden because he's such a curiosity. In the Wood, Burnt Hills was 
second to Thirty Six Red, beaten by a head, but he is a horse with the wrong 
running style for this Derby. Burnt Hills likes to run on the lead and doesn't 
appear to have enough speed to keep up with Summer Squall, Mister Frisky and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton Ridge, on the other hand, likes to make a late run and might benefit 
from a fast early pace that could exhaust the leaders. At least that's the way 
Frankel would like to see the race develop. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not running one horse to set up the other one," Frankel said. "These 
horses have different owners (Edmund Gann of San Diego owns Burnt Hills), and I 
think they've both got a shot." 
</P>
<P>
Burnt Hills and Pendleton Ridge worked in company at Aqueduct before the Wood, 
and both horses blazed away for five furlongs. But under similar circumstances 
Monday at Churchill, something went wrong. Burnt Hills worked five furlongs in 
1:01 3/5, but Pendleton Ridge couldn't keep up and was clocked in 1:03. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Perret, a leading jockey who will be aboard Florida Derby winner 
Unbridled in the Kentucky Derby, was Pendleton Ridge's exercise rider Monday. 
As they came off the track, Frankel asked for an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I got close to the other horse, he pulled away from me," said 
Perret, riding the horse back to the barn. "I couldn't get him to keep up." 
</P>
<P>
Frankel was disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"Perret didn't know the horse," the trainer said. "He's a big, lazy horse. I'll 
have to do something with him later in the week." 
</P>
<P>
Frankel is a blunt former New Yorker who frequently waxes sarcastic. Monday was 
one of those times. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever I do with that horse might make him run better," Frankel said. "None 
of us (trainers) know what we're doing. We all copy each other. I think the 
Derby's wide open. Every time a horse wins a race, somebody says that he's not 
beating anything. What's the difference if you win by a nose or lose by a 
nose?"

NEWSWIRE: NFL SUSPENDS SAINTS' WARREN FOR DRUG USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defensive end Frank Warren, coming off the best of his nine seasons with the 
New Orleans Saints, was suspended from the NFL for at least a year Monday after 
testing positive for drugs a third time. 
</P>
<P>
The league's three-violation policy was established in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
A first violation is kept confidential, a second means suspension for four 
weeks and a third-time violator is suspended for life with the option to 
reapply in a year. 
</P>
<P>
Warren, 6 feet 4 and 290 pounds, was never suspended as a two-time violator, 
and there was no explanation of that. 
</P>
<P>
NFL spokesman Jim Heffernan said he did not know when the second or third 
violations occurred. Team officials refused to provide the details and Warren 
did not return telephone calls.

Unanswered Prayers: Media mogul Ted Turner criticized fundamentalist Christians 
for emphasizing that humans were born into sin, arguing instead that "we're all 
basically good." He said in a speech Friday in Atlanta he was disillusioned 
when his sister died after a long illness, despite his prayers: "If God is love 
and all-powerful, why does he allow these things to happen?" He gave the 
audience copies of his own version of the Ten Commandments, the "10 Voluntary 
Initiatives," which include population control, recycling and pacifism. 
</P>
<P>
Borrowed Wisdom: The virtues of saving over borrowing are lost, former 
Wisconsin Sen. William Proxmire told students at Northern Michigan University 
in Marquette, Mich., over the weekend: "There should be an enshrinement of Ben 
Franklin and his teachings on the virtue of thrift -- save and earn interest, 
don't borrow and pay it . . . . We've got to institute a sort of Puritanism in 
this country."

Dog of a Deal: Sen. Robert Byrd, the West Virginian who was majority leader and 
is the Senate's senior Democrat, sent unusual birthday greetings to his dog, 
Billy, and Billy's sister Bonnie, owned by a daughter. The greetings will cost 
taxpayers about $1,000. In roughly two pages of the April 23 Congressional 
Record -- at a cost of $515 per page -- Byrd said the Maltese terriers see each 
other daily; that Billy dislikes canned dog food and rides in the front seat of 
the family car.

Missed Marla: Barbara Bush confessed Sunday to only one regret about the annual 
White House Correspondents Assn. dinner in Washington: Despite trying, she

split with his wife. Maples attended the Saturday night banquet as Time 
magazine's guest.

IN THE COMPANY OF ANGELS; 
</P>
<P>
BOOKS: AUTHOR SOPHY BURNHAM BELIEVES SHE MET AN ANGEL DURING A NEAR-FATAL 
EXPERIENCE. THE RESULT: "A BOOK OF ANGELS." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTIJANE LEVINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Do angels have feet? Teeth? Tears? Do they hover invisibly above, or walk among 
us disguised as humans? Are they capable of independent acts or are they 
commanded? Do they exist at all? And if so, would we, in our miasma of smog, 
traffic and information overload, recognize an angel if we saw one? 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, where we talk of angels every time we mention where we live, do 
we ever stop to ponder the nature of the spirits whose name we so constantly 
invoke? 
</P>
<P>
Sophy Burnham, a Washington-based writer, believes she has met angels and that 
her life was even saved by one. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham was barreling down a European mountain on her back, head first, during 
a ski accident that she believed would lead to certain death. No matter how she 
tried, she couldn't stop. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, she writes, her fall was stopped by a mysterious skier who stood in 
her path. He was "dressed completely in black." She looked into his eyes. 
"They, too, were black, but full of such light I could not move." 
</P>
<P>
Neither she nor her then-husband, who had watched helplessly as she fell, could 
figure out where the man came from or where he went. 
</P>
<P>
Some time later she began to jot down the "curious and mysterious" occurrences 
she'd experienced and heard about from others. Angel sightings, you might say. 
</P>
<P>
Along with these notes, she gathered her favorite references to angels by great 
poets and philosophers. The result, "A Book of Angels," (Ballantine: $8.95) is 
a kind of timeless tour, led by ordinary people who've met angels, and 
extraordinary writers who've set down ageless thoughts: Milton, Dante, Goethe, 
Shakespeare, Blake, Rilke, Dostoevsky, Swedenborg, and Poe, along with passages 
from the Bible and Koran. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Burnham's most poignant angel "encounter" occurred while she was 
dickering with her dying mother in a hospital. "I hunched in my chair, hurt and 
angry, wondering if I should simply get up and leave. . . . There were things 
we should be saying to each other, not nagging, picking at me so." 
</P>
<P>
Not even the entry of a hospital worker quieted her mother's tirade. Suddenly 
the Jamaican woman stopped her moping and said, " 'I grudge you the 
mother-talk.' " 
</P>
<P>
" 'I grudge you the mother-talk,' she repeated, looking from one to the other 
of us, smiling with a broad, gold smile. 'My own mother died when I was 12,' 
she sang, 'and I've had no one in all these years to give me mother-talk. It is 
so nice to hear.' " 
</P>
<P>
Burnham "sat up even straighter, hit by joy. Of course. She (Burnham's mother) 
was cuffing the cub, was all. I had not understood." 
</P>
<P>
The hospital worker "left them in a different state," Burnham writes. "We began 
to talk on another level. We could approach the topic of death, say how much we 
cared for each other. A week later she was dead." 
</P>
<P>
Burnham says she wrote the book for "all the people who've had similar 
experiences and don't trust them. I want them to know they are not alone. Also 
for all the people who have not had an experience with angels. All the 
religions tell us there are angels, and we all need to know there is someone 
taking care of us." 
</P>
<P>
Msgr. George J. Parnassus, pastor of Saint Victor's Catholic Church, says: 
"There is an order of beings called angels. They are creatures, which means 
they are not divine in nature. God alone is divine. (But) angels are a higher 
order of being than we are. They are pure spirits. They have intellect and free 
will. According to Catholic philosophy they have intuitive intellect as opposed 
to our (human) intellect, which is rational and discursive. 
</P>
<P>
"A discursive intellect is one that runs a gamut of successive ideas or 
thoughts about a matter. Human beings think in pictures. As one picture recedes 
from our mind, another takes its place. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Parnassus continues, "The intuitive (angel) intellect does not depend on 
pictures or the building up of information. It gets the whole thing at once. 
But once an angel has made up its mind, it will never change its mind. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The angel can never say 'I'm sorry,' which leads to an enormously important 
question raised in the New Testament: Why did God, for the sake of redeeming 
mankind, become a man?. . . . Answer: Because man could pay attention to God, 
to Jesus, to the Gospel. He could reconsider his relationship with God and say 
'I'm sorry.' But if God became an angel, and appeared among them, they wouldn't 
reconsider. So what appears in man to be a defect, his imperfect intellect, may 
indeed be an asset. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Orthodox associate Rabbi Aron Tendler, of Shaarey Zedek Congregation in North 
Hollywood and principal at Yeshiva University boys' high school, says, "Angels 
have no independence whatsoever. (They) are creations of God, totally spiritual 
in their existence. They have the ability to appear on occasion as physical. 
They can't be good or bad, because they only do what God tells them to do, and 
God can do no bad. We (Orthodox) Jews have the notion that there is an angel 
assigned to every child, who will then teach the child its capacity to know 
God." 
</P>
<P>
Burnham is so convinced that angels help us that she has a note and an address 
at the back of her book, asking people who've had "mystical experiences" to 
share them with her. 
</P>
<P>
She writes, quoting the Bible, "Be not afraid to have strangers in your house, 
for some thereby have entertained angels unawares."

INTO THE NIGHT: TIE-UP ON THE PARTY CIRCUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Scene: The U.S. premiere of Pedro Almodovar's "Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!," a 
last-minute addition to the American Film Institute Film Festival, Thursday at 
the Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza. For the uninitiated, the movie, steeped in 
controversy, was awarded an X rating by the Motion Picture Assn. of America, 
but Almodovar refused to recut the scenes in question and chose to release the 
movie unrated. (It opens at the Goldwyn Pavilion Friday.) After gorging on 
screen sex, drugs and violence on screen, filmgoers partied at the Twenty 20 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: No, it wasn't about the rating or what Almodovar calls "the moment" 
which generated the original X, but about the film's content -- the story of an 
actress who is kidnaped, beaten and held captive by a mental patient and then 
falls madly in love with him. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: "Oh, it's a fun-loving, cute, adorable rape fantasy. I think it's 
pretty morally questionable," said actor Barry Miller, of TV's "Equal Justice." 
</P>
<P>
Overheard: "This movie actually says worse things about women than 'Pretty 
Woman.' " 
</P>
<P>
Understated: "I feel misunderstood," said Almodovar. 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: "Tie Me Up!" stars Antonio Banderas and Loles Leon, Miramax 
Films (the movie's distributor) executives Harvey and Bob Weinstein and Russell 
Schwartz, your usual assortment of agents, film production and studio 
executives, plus a few strange-looking performance artists. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Code: For both sexes, dark suits worn with T-shirts or shirts buttoned up 
to the top button. No one asked, but actress/model Lauren Hutton volunteered 
that hers was Armani. 
</P>
<P>
Chow: A large X-shaped chocolate cake with marzipan fruit on top, as well as 
canapes and other desserts. People drank Calistoga water, diet Coke, and 
Absolut vodka sometimes straight, sometimes with juice. 
</P>
<P>
Exit Line: From an anonymous, youngish male agent -- "This is not the kind of 
movie this town thrives on, but it's well made. Hollywood is about dollars and 
this isn't a movie about dollars, it's about real visionary movie-making 
skills."

ART BUCHWALD: MESSAGE OF THE $600-MILLION MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By ART BUCHWALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the prosecutors in the Mike Milken case was very proud of the deal he 
had cut with Milken's lawyers and announced happily, "We have sent a message to 
Wall Street." 
</P>
<P>
"That's good," my wife said. "I was hoping that sooner or later someone would 
send Wall Street a message." 
</P>
<P>
I told her, "I think they were much too tough on Milken. They want him to pay 
$600 million as a penalty for what was nothing more than a third-rate 
burglary." 
</P>
<P>
My wife sounded concerned. "If he gives that much to the government, will he 
have anything left for himself?" 
</P>
<P>
"No more than a billion. I'm not suggesting that Milken can't live on a 
billion, but he's going to have to cut back a lot on luxuries. That's one of 
the messages the Justice Department is sending to Wall Street -- if you're 
piggy about the stock market, you'll have to pay the piper." 
</P>
<P>
"They don't have any pity for white collar criminals anymore," my wife said. 
</P>
<P>
"If Washington shed any tears, then everyone on Wall Street would try to screw 
the public. No one enjoys seeing a man like Milken in trouble, because without 
him there wouldn't be junk bonds to start with. 
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, someone has to say enough is enough, and if a man rapes the 
stock market, we'll make him cry 'Uncle' no matter it costs him." 
</P>
<P>
"What other message did the prosecution send to Wall Street?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
"The signal is that if you lie and perjure yourself and break the law, then you 
have to get the best lawyer that money can buy. When it comes to white collar 
crimes, the last thing the Justice Department lawyers want to do is negotiate 
with a public defender. Mike Milken is the type of client that top-flight 
criminal attorneys will kill for." 
</P>
<P>
"Are you saying that Mike Milken got a better deal because he had the smartest 
lawyers in the United States?" 
</P>
<P>
"That's what the system of justice in this country is all about." 
</P>
<P>
"Could someone in blue jeans negotiate the same deal?" 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, if he had $600 million. In Milken's case he was a genius and he 
made many people rich. For this reason he must be treated with respect. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying that Mike will not get jail for what he did -- but it won't be 
hard time because the Justice Department hates to bring a federal case against 
someone just because he wanted to make more money than anybody else in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
My wife kept pressing. "Why aren't they going to force Milken to sing about the 
others who also had their fingers in the junk bond jar?" 
</P>
<P>
"Because that means they would have to keep making deals with Wall Street 
crooks ad infinitum. The attorney general has much better things to do than 
force Milken to sing the 'Barber of Seville' on the floor of the New York Stock 
Exchange." 
</P>
<P>
My wife said, "I never did like junk bonds." 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody ever liked junk bonds, but in the '80s it was the only junk to go 
around." 
</P>
<P>
"Are we finished with the message that the Justice Department sent to Wall 
Street?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes -- we are now waiting for Wall Street to fax its reply."

U.S. NOT HOPEFUL ON OTHER HOSTAGES; LAUDS IRAN, SYRIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN WRIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration expressed its gratitude Monday to both Syria and Iran 
for helping win freedom for hostage Frank H. Reed, but U.S. officials conceded 
privately that they do not anticipate another imminent release. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like the well will be dry for awhile," said a source close to the 
hostage crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, within hours of Reed's release, the battle lines of Phase 2 of the 
hostage release drama appeared to be taking shape. 
</P>
<P>
An editorial in today's Tehran Times warned: "Now the ball is in the court of 
the United States and the Western countries. . . . Without an appropriate 
response from the West, there is no chance for the continuation of Iranian 
mediation and requests." 
</P>
<P>
But at a White House ceremony to welcome returned hostage Robert Polhill, 
President Bush ruled out any improvement in relations with Iran or a reciprocal 
gesture to any party until all Americans are freed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not, in a piecemeal basis, bidding for human life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier written statement, the President pointedly noted that six other 
Americans and at least eight foreigners remain hostage in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"Their predicament weighs on our mind and tempers the joy we feel today," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The President did go further in acknowledging Iran's role in Reed's release 
than he did in last week's reaction to Polhill's freedom. In the written 
statement, he thanked Tehran for "using its influence to help bring about this 
humanitarian step." In contrast, he thanked Damascus only for "facilitating" 
Reed's freedom. 
</P>
<P>
The statement indicated that the Administration believes that Iran played the 
more pivotal role. But the Islamic republic made clear that words will not 
suffice. 
</P>
<P>
In the Tehran Times editorial, Iran for the first time claimed credit for the 
release of the two Americans within nine days. 
</P>
<P>
"Something miraculous has happened," the Tehran Times said, because Iran "put 
in months of hard effort" and "used its maximum power and credibility" to free 
the first American hostages in more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
The English-language Times, which is considered the mouthpiece of Iranian 
President Hashemi Rafsanjani, said that the next "appropriate" step would be 
for the release of "a significant number of hostages including a few Iranian 
hostages and Sheik Obeid . . . so that we can celebrate the year 1990 as the 
end of the hostage crisis." 
</P>
<P>
The demand was a reference to an estimated 400 Shiite Muslim and Palestinian 
prisoners under the control of Israel or the pro-Israeli militia in southern 
Lebanon and to four Iranian hostages abducted by a Christian militia outside 
Beirut in 1982. Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, a prominent Shiite sheik, was abducted 
from his home in southern Lebanon by Israeli commandos last July. 
</P>
<P>
The editorial also described the Bush Administration's reaction to the first 
hostage release as "not likable and very unexpected," and it denounced the 
congressional vote last week that endorsed Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. counterterrorism official responded to the editorial's demands by saying 
that the Administration has no intention of backing down from its position of 
"no deals." 
</P>
<P>
But he conceded that some "fancy footwork" will be necessary to win freedom for 
the remaining six Americans. At this point, the Administration is hoping that 
Israel will contribute to the new momentum with a release, however token, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Israeli government has made several offers of a swap in the past, 
its terms include the release of three soldiers captured during Israel's 
occupation of Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush said he has "no knowledge" of any deal that would involve Israel 
releasing prisoners under its control in exchange for U.S. and other hostages. 
But he later added that he would have "no objection." 
</P>
<P>
White House officials have repeatedly tried to signal a desire to see the 
Israelis free some prisoners without directly calling on Israel to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem boils down to who takes the next step -- and how to avoid it from 
being seen as part of a deal," said the source close to the hostage crisis. 
</P>
<P>
As in the case of Polhill, U.S. officials had no idea why Reed was picked for 
the second release. They had, however, anticipated further movement. When the 
Syrians first approached the U.S. Embassy in Damascus 12 days ago, they told 
American diplomats that they expected two to come out. When only Polhill was 
freed, the Syrians offered reassurances that another would be freed soon. 
</P>
<P>
At the White House today, Polhill told a Rose Garden press conference, "I 
sincerely hope that Frank (Reed) is Step 2 in what will be a continuing release 
of hostages and bringing us all back." 
</P>
<P>
Of the reasons behind his release, he said, "You may be surprised but I really 
don't know very much about what was going on around me." 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officials confirmed that Polhill did have a message for Bush from his 
captors, a message he had refused to divulge to his debriefers during the 
stopover in Germany last week. 
</P>
<P>
After the Rose Garden ceremony, Polhill, who is expected to undergo a biopsy 
this weekend for a growth in his throat that developed during his 1,183-day 
captivity, met with the President, Secretary of State James A. Baker III, 
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and others to relay the message. U.S. 
officials refused to disclose the contents. 
</P>
<P>
Polhill's White House reception and Reed's release came on the day the State 
Department published its annual report on terrorism, which lists both Iran and 
Syria among six countries still involved in state-sponsored terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
"A number of states involved in terrorism, including Libya and Syria, remained 
wary of getting caught sponsoring terrorists and reduced their support. Iran 
was a notable exception," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
Although Tehran's involvement in state-sponsored attacks decreased slightly in 
1989, it concludes, "Iran continues to provide Hezbollah with money, weapons 
and training and has approved -- and in some cases encouraged -- the kidnaping 
of Western citizens." 
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is a pro-Iranian Shiite group in Lebanon thought to be an umbrella 
organization that includes several of the groups holding foreign hostages in 
Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
The report adds that Iranian intelligence has been used "to facilitate and in 
some cases conduct terrorist attacks." And it reports extensive support for 
terrorist groups even after the death of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 
June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department survey said Syria has not been linked to the planning or 
execution of incidents outside Lebanon since 1987. But Damascus has not been 
taken off the list of sponsors because it provides support and safe haven to 
groups such as Hezbollah, the Japanese Red Army and the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine-General Command. 
</P>
<P>
The report was deemed sufficiently sensitive that the White House ordered all 
copies, scheduled to be released Monday morning, delayed until after Reed's 
release was confirmed. U.S. officials said they did not want Tehran or Damascus 
to balk at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
In general, however, the report concludes that international terrorism declined 
sharply, by almost 38%, worldwide in 1989. 
</P>

Times staff writers James Gerstenzang and David Lauter also contributed to this 
report.

A HAZE OVER THE GRAND CANYON COULD FORCE A COSTLY CLEANUP AT AN ARIZONA POWER 
PLANT. IS POLLUTION NEAR PARKS THE NEXT BIG ENVIRONMENTAL BATTLEGROUND?

GRAND CANYON, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What value should be put on preserving a breathtaking vision? Four hundred 
million dollars? 
</P>
<P>
How much is it worth to guarantee that the vivid details and bright pastels of 
magnificent sheer chasm walls don't wash into cold, faded blurs of blue and 
gray? One billion dollars? How about $1.6 billion? 
</P>
<P>
Those are some of the estimates of what it could cost in just the first round 
of a new, more aggressive, yet fuzzily defined federal assault on dirty air. 
That initial battleground is here, in the vast and majestic expanses of Grand 
Canyon National Park. 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators stand poised to force a massive cleanup on a remote Arizona 
power plant which environmentalists claim is helping to foul the pristine 
canyon atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
It would mark the government's first attempt to impose anti-pollution 
protections -- heretofore enforced largely for health and safety reasons -- 
primarily for aesthetics. And such an action could foreshadow a similar 
strategy at other national parks where even more serious visibility problems 
have been linked to particulate emissions from utilities or industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Grand Canyon is truly an international treasure and it's one of the most 
spectacular vistas in the world, and visitors have the right to see it 
clearly," insisted Jack Davis, the park superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is the 2,250-megawatt Navajo Generating Station, one of the largest 
such facilities in the West. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old plant is owned by a six-member consortium that includes the Los 
Angeles Department of Water and Power and, ironically, the U.S. Interior 
Department's Bureau of Reclamation. It is managed by another partner, the 
Tempe, Ariz.-based Salt River Project, a nonprofit cooperative that provides 
both power and irrigation water to large sections of central Arizona. Los 
Angeles depends on the plant for 13% of its electric power. 
</P>
<P>
Located in remote Page, Ariz., only 80 miles northeast of the main visitors' 
center at the park, Navajo's three coal-fired generators currently lack 
state-of-the-art emission control devices known as "scrubbers." They are, 
however, fueled by some of the cleanest burning coal on the market. Still, they 
belch up to 300 tons of sulfur dioxide a day through a trio of 775-foot stacks. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Environmental Protection Agency has issued a draft proposal that, 
if finalized, would require a 90% reduction in those emissions. Even so, 
neither the EPA nor environmentalists are claiming that the fumes are bad 
enough to pose a serious danger to vegetation or wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they contend that a $2-million study conducted by the National Park 
Service in 1987 proves that Navajo is a menace to visibility at one of the 
world's foremost scenic attractions. Using a chemical tracer, scientists 
tracked emissions from the plant to sensors in the park over a six-week period. 
</P>
<P>
Based on computer analyses of those findings, the EPA claims that discharges 
from Navajo frequently get trapped by stagnant wintertime air. As such, the 
agency concluded that the plant could be responsible at times for as much as 
70% of the thick haze which periodically hangs over the canyon from November 
through March. 
</P>
<P>
It can reduce visibility at the park from an awe-inspiring 150 miles or more 
under ideal conditions to under 10 miles -- not enough to see from one canyon 
rim to another -- on a handful of really bad days. The park also is plagued by 
haze in the summer, but experts say that is far harder to deal with because it 
is caused by prevailing seasonal winds that blow smog all the way from Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Final action on the EPA proposal awaits a review by the White House Office of 
Management and Budget, which is required to take a look at the impact of 
expensive regulatory schemes. OMB was supposed to have completed its study by 
early April, but has asked for at least two delays. 
</P>
<P>
Only Wednesday, sources said, OMB asked for more talks with EPA officials to 
discuss, among other matters, the way the agency has calculated potential 
benefits from pollution controls and whether a 90% reduction in emissions is a 
reasonable goal. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at both the OMB and the EPA refused to discuss the negotiations, but 
the two agencies have had sharp differences in the past over the costs of 
environmental regulation. And they continue to bicker over such issues as the 
economic repercussions of addressing global warming. So any dispute over Navajo 
has the makings for yet another fight for the soul of self-styled 
"environmental President" George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Salt River officials say Navajo is at most a bit player in the canyon haze 
drama and is being targeted merely because it is conveniently near the park. 
They want the EPA to delay any enforcement order until more detailed tests can 
either verify or refute government claims. 
</P>
<P>
But they also argue that retrofitting scrubbers to cleanse emissions will do 
little to upgrade park visibility while still boosting electric bills for 
millions of consumers, including the Los Angeles DWP's 1.3 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe that 99.5% of people going to the canyon would know any 
difference," said Navajo plant manager Charles Brumback when asked about the 
impact of scrubbers. "I don't know if scientists would be able to tell the 
difference. If there is a difference, it will be one that you can see only with 
scientific instruments." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the science of visibility protection is inexact and evolving. 
Visibility problems can be caused by a multitude of sources, many of them 
natural and each having varying impacts at different times. Blowing dust, 
forest fires, pollen, electrical storms and light diffusing air molecules can 
all cause haze. 
</P>
<P>
So can sulfur dioxide, itself an invisible gas. Combined with moisture in the 
atmosphere, however, sulfur dioxide forms tiny sulfate particles which are 
visible and do discolor the air. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is not confined to the Grand Canyon. According to a 1988 National 
Park Service study, man-made pollutants obscured scenic vistas more than 90% of 
the time at national parks and wilderness areas throughout the lower 48 states. 
</P>
<P>
The worst problems were found in the East. It was once possible to see the 
Washington Monument from the Shenandoah National Park in Virginia's Blue Ridge 
Mountains, and the Atlantic Ocean was visible from the top of Mt. Washington in 
New Hampshire. But no more. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Park Service study concluded that, despite problems, the Grand 
Canyon and other parks in the Colorado River plateau area actually enjoyed some 
of the cleanest air in the country. And that, oddly, appears to be why Navajo 
has come under scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Shaver, a supervisor with the air quality division of the Park 
Service, said regulators are using the Grand Canyon as a test case because they 
believe its visibility problems are easier to tackle than those at other parks. 
</P>
<P>
"The cleaner the air is, the more sensitive it is to even a very small change 
in the composition of particulates," Shaver explained. ". . . Since we're 
closer to being clean there (at the Grand Canyon) than anywhere else, we have a 
better chance of dealing with the problem." 
</P>
<P>
The next target for action could be the large Centralia Power Plant, about 30 
miles southwest of Mt. Rainier in the state of Washington, Shaver said the Park 
Service will be conducting a field study this summer to help determine the 
impact on park visibility in the Pacific Northwest of sulfur dioxide emissions 
from Centralia, owned by PacifiCorp. 
</P>
<P>
An EPA move in the Grand Canyon case would mark the agency's first attempt to 
enforce a 1977 congressional mandate to crack down on polluters who impair park 
visibility. The action was triggered only after the Boulder, Colo.-based 
Environmental Defense Fund sued the EPA for failing to enforce that law. 
</P>
<P>
The 13-year-old statute also required the EPA to issue regulations for 
protection of such areas. It has so far failed to do so. However, Congress is 
considering legislation sponsored by Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) that would force 
the EPA to write the visibility rules within two years or to require every 
large sulfur dioxide producing utility or plant located near a park to add 
anti-pollution gear. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have long suspected that Navajo emissions might be a threat 
to canyon visibility. Even while still on the drawing boards, then Interior 
Secretary Walter J. Hickel expressed concern about a project in which the 
Interior Department would be a part owner. 
</P>
<P>
"We must not allow anyone to pollute the environment there, and it would be 
unthinkable for us to pollute it ourselves," Hickel wrote to an assistant back 
in 1970. Similar misgivings were expressed by state environmental officials in 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
The plant was built before scrubber technology was perfected. At the time, 
however, Salt River promised to eventually install scrubbers and even set aside 
a large parcel of space adjacent to the plant in anticipation of the day 
effective cleansing equipment would be added. 
</P>
<P>
Once in operation, however, company officials convinced the EPA that scrubbers 
were not needed because the plant was meeting existing federal and state air 
quality standards. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Brand L. Niemann, a one-time private weather consultant on the Navajo 
project, charged that he warned Salt River officials a year before the first 
generator fired up in 1974 that the plant would cause problems. 
</P>
<P>
Niemann, who joined the EPA after he first made the allegations last fall, said 
that smoke released from skywriting planes was detected deep inside the canyon 
on sensors placed by professional mountain climbers. Pollutants were sucked 
into the park by cold air that drained from high plateaus and settled into the 
canyon, Niemann said he concluded at the time. 
</P>
<P>
But, Niemann said in an interview, Salt River officials allegedly rebuffed his 
findings. Both Jack Pfister, the general manager of Salt River, and Jerry 
Shapiro, a San Francisco-based engineer who has been the utility's chief 
consultant on both Navajo's construction and operation, insist they have no 
recollection of Niemann's version of events. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the truth of those claims, the EPA believes it found the smoking gun 
to link Navajo to canyon haze with the 1987 Park Service study called WHITEX, 
short for Winter Haze Intensive Tracer Experiment. 
</P>
<P>
WHITEX, ironically sponsored in part by Salt River as well as the EPA and other 
institutions, was not specifically designed to look for haze in the canyon but 
rather simply to perfect haze detection techniques. If any impact was found 
from Navajo, it was expected to be downwind of the plant in Utah's Canyonlands 
National Park. 
</P>
<P>
Over the 60-day run of WHITEX, sensors placed in Canyonlands did record 
evidence of the special chemical that had been injected into Navajo's flue gas 
stacks to mark the flow of sulfur dioxide emissions. The tracer even turned up 
on a sensor placed upwind of the plant, at Hopi Point on the south rim of the 
Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro admits he was surprised by the finding. But he also contends that the 
conclusions drawn from it by the EPA were hasty and based on a misapplication 
of scientific data now being used to justify a "bewildering and frightening" 
rush to judgment against Navajo. 
</P>
<P>
Haze has been recorded at the Grand Canyon for at least a century, Shapiro 
pointed out. As such, he said, it is premature to conclude from WHITEX that the 
problem is worsening or that it is not primarily due to natural causes or a mix 
of polluters from a broad region of which Navajo represents only a small 
contribution. 
</P>
<P>
Salt River recently concluded its own $12-million study of Navajo emissions 
which company officials insist will provide a more comprehensive analysis of 
the situation. They want the EPA to delay any final order in the case until a 
review of the new study is completed, probably by October. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the EPA and the Park Service say they welcome any new data Salt 
River can offer, but also insist the company is stalling. 
</P>
<P>
Molly Ross, the assistant chief of the Park Service's air quality division, 
said confidence in the validity of WHITEX had only increased with more 
analysis. "We feel we have now answered all of the criticisms, and we continue 
to feel very good about it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
That confidence, she said, was bolstered by a follow-up study that recorded 
pollutants associated with power plants deep inside the canyon at levels far in 
excess of anything measured at the rim during the WHITEX study. Though experts 
could not say definitively whether the pollutants came from Navajo or some 
other generating station, they regard the finding as strong circumstantial 
evidence against the plant. 
</P>
<P>
The studies became the underpinning for a preliminary EPA finding that Salt 
River must outfit Navajo with scrubbers. The agency said such equipment could 
make at least a "perceptible" change in visibility up to 100 days during an 
average winter and a "very apparent" change on up to 21 days. 
</P>
<P>
Salt River officials disagree. Initially, they said it could cost $1 billion to 
add the equipment. Later, they upped that estimate to $1.6 billion, about twice 
the plant's original construction cost. The EPA has set the construction price 
for the scrubbers at around $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
Salt River says adding scrubbers would force member utilities to raise rates by 
3% to 5%. In Los Angeles, Department of Water and Power officials estimate that 
could add nearly $22 a year to residential customers' annual bill when coupled 
with the cost of other anti-pollution programs the utility is already committed 
to. 
</P>
<P>
To date, DWP is standing by Salt River's call for a delay in final action until 
the company's new test results come out. But the municipally owned utility has 
also been directed by Mayor Tom Bradley to consider what leverage it has to 
force a resolution of the controversy.

SHAMIR SCUTTLED PLAN FOR PEACE TALKS, U.S. SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a stinging rebuke to Israel's caretaker prime minister, the State Department 
said Monday that Yitzhak Shamir torpedoed a U.S. initiative that was "on the 
verge" of producing unprecedented direct peace talks between Israel and a 
representative delegation of Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's continuing rejection of the American plan "will probably mean losing 
an important opportunity to move the peace process forward," the department's 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The statement, read by department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler, injected the 
Bush Administration directly into Israel's continuing political crisis by 
strongly implying that the country will have no chance for peace as long as the 
74-year-old prime minister remains in power. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir is in the early days of a 21-day mandate to form a new government to 
replace the national unity coalition he headed until March 16. At that time, 
the coalition fell after Shamir rebuffed the peace initiative put forward by 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III. Shamir's archrival, Labor Party leader 
Shimon Peres, who supports the Baker plan, failed last week in an attempt to 
form a government of his own. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration, and the Reagan Administration before it, have made no 
secret of their preference for Peres. However, the U.S. government tried to 
soft-pedal its attitude in public because it wanted to avoid charges of 
meddling in Israeli politics. 
</P>
<P>
But the department's Monday statement, approved by Baker and other top 
officials, amounted to a direct, point-by-point reply to remarks by Shamir in 
an interview earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
In the interview on Israel Radio, Shamir mocked Peres' assertion that Labor 
pulled out of the national unity government because Shamir's refusal to say 
"yes to Baker" had stalled the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
"I must say there is something perhaps ridiculous in the very slogan 'Yes to 
Baker,' " Shamir said. "What is this 'Yes to Baker'? We are happy we cooperate 
with the U.S. government in the bold effort to reach some sort of agreement 
with the Arab world in the conflict between us and them. 
</P>
<P>
"But if there is understanding and cooperation between us and the United 
States, no one can expect we will accept every proposal or idea of an American 
secretary of state, come what may," Shamir said. 
</P>
<P>
In its response, the State Department said, "Saying yes to Secretary Baker's 
(proposal) meant saying yes to the government of Israel's (own) plan, yes to 
Israeli-Palestinian dialogue and yes to peace. Continuing to say no will give 
us very little to work with. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Under the Baker plan, the foreign ministers of Israel, Egypt and the United 
States would meet in Cairo to select a Palestinian delegation to negotiate with 
Israel over conditions for West Bank and Gaza Strip elections. The Palestinians 
elected would negotiate a peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The elections were originally proposed last May by Shamir, but West Bank and 
Gaza Palestinians refused to participate unless they were given a voice in 
determining the rules for the balloting. Baker's plan was intended to get over 
that hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler's statement came much closer than Administration officials ever have 
before to claiming that Shamir balked at a time when the effort was nearing 
success. 
</P>
<P>
"The government of Israel asked us to find a Palestinian partner from the 
(occupied) territories to help implement its May, 1989, initiative," Tutwiler 
said. "We were on the verge of accomplishing that objective. Indeed, we felt we 
were close to producing Palestinians from the territories who were prepared to 
talk to Israel about the elections in the territories." She added that the 
Baker plan "would have enabled us to achieve this." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in Jerusalem, several thousand Israelis, including a group of army 
reserve officers on a hunger strike, staged a protest rally in front of the 
Parliament building to demand changes in the electoral system, the Associated 
Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
Israel Army Radio said that more than half a million Israelis, an astonishingly 
large number in a nation of only about 5 million, had signed petitions 
demanding electoral reform. 
</P>
<P>
The petitions were presented to Chaim Herzog, who holds the largely ceremonial 
post of president. Herzog called for electoral reform and criticized Israeli 
politicians for showing a "total contempt for the principles of democracy." 
</P>
<P>
Under the Israeli electoral system, the Knesset's 120 members are elected on a 
nationwide ballot that assigns seats to a bewildering variety of political 
parties on the basis of their proportion of the vote. No party has ever won a 
majority, so all governments have been coalitions. 
</P>
<P>
The present Knesset is so evenly balanced between Shamir's Likud Party and 
Peres' Labor Party that neither man has been able to cobble together the 61 
votes needed to install a government.

COURT RULING COULD BAR LUCKY-ALPHA BETA DEAL 
</P>

State officials and private lawyers won new powers to challenge corporate 
mergers Monday as the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that California attorneys 
may seek to split up the merger of the Lucky and Alpha Beta supermarket chains 
if it will hurt consumers. 
</P>
<P>
If the two were allowed to merge into one powerful supermarket chain, consumers 
could have faced $200 million-a-year in higher prices for groceries, state 
attorneys contended. The corporate owners of Alpha Beta have countered that the 
merger would save consumers $50 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Although the two chains have continued independent operations, the merger was 
approved two years ago by the Federal Trade Commission. The following year, a 
federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that state officials then had no 
right to contest the merger. 
</P>
<P>
But under Monday's 9-0 ruling, state lawyers may go to federal court in Los 
Angeles and attempt to show that the merger may "lessen competition" in the 
grocery business. If they can prove that -- and most experts think they can -- 
the merger could be dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a tremendous victory both for California grocery shoppers and for 
state officials willing to challenge unlawful mergers," said Atty. Gen. John 
Van de Kamp, who challenged the merger in a 1988 suit. 
</P>
<P>
American Stores, parent company of Alpha Beta, issued a statement that said "no 
final determination" has been made showing its acquisition of Lucky violated 
antitrust laws. The company "intends to vigorously defend its position," it 
added. On a broader level, Monday's decision gives further indication that the 
"merger mania" of the 1980s has ended. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the junk-bond market has made it harder for corporate raiders 
to raise enough funds to buy other companies. New state laws have made it more 
difficult for outsiders to take control of a home-state company. And now the 
Supreme Court has given aggressive state attorneys and other interested parties 
the power to challenge mergers that violate federal antitrust laws because they 
might "lessen competition." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, lawyers for the Ronald Reagan Administration generally smiled 
upon corporate mergers. The result was an unprecedented wave of mergers, 
ranging from international airlines to local department stories. 
</P>
<P>
All the while, however, the state attorneys general, most of them Democrats, 
maintained the more traditional view that fewer competitors would mean higher 
prices for consumers. But when they tried to aggressively enforce laws against 
price-fixing and monopolies, they often found themselves blocked by judges who 
said the old trust-busting laws of the late 19th and early 20th Century must be 
enforced from Washington, not from the state capitals. 
</P>
<P>
The Clayton Act of 1914 prohibits mergers whose effect "may be substantially to 
lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly." The law said U.S. 
attorneys had the power to enforce its terms. In addition, it said "any person, 
firm, corporation or association" could sue for "injunctive relief against 
threatened loss or damage" because of a violation of the law. 
</P>
<P>
The Alpha Beta and Lucky case -- California vs. American Stores, 89-258 -- 
turned on the narrow question of whether "injunctive relief" included the right 
to break up an already completed merger. 
</P>
<P>
Looking at the language and history of the law, the Supreme Court concluded 
Monday that Congress meant to give broad powers to state or private attorneys 
not only to prevent planned mergers, but to break up completed ones. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if the merger is a completed violation of the law, the threatened harm to 
California consumers persists," wrote Justice John Paul Stevens for the court. 
</P>
<P>
This case began in March, 1988, when American Stores, owners of the 252 Alpha 
Beta supermarkets in California, sought to buy out the Lucky chain, which had 
340 stores in the state. The announcement came as Vons was in the midst of 
buying out Safeway stores in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing that the Lucky-Alpha Beta merger could end real price competition among 
the major supermarkets, Van de Kamp, who is running in the Democratic primary 
for governor, expressed opposition to the deal. But under federal law, FTC 
officials are given first rights to examine a proposed merger. 
</P>
<P>
In June, American bought up all of Lucky's outstanding stock. On Aug. 31, the 
FTC announced its approval of the merger. The next day, Van de Kamp filed a 
suit under the 1914 law in a federal court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers in Southern California may not notice any difference in the Lucky and 
Alpha Beta stores because, despite the completed merger, U.S. District Judge 
David V. Kenyon ordered them to operate independently while the suit went 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
American Stores quickly appealed Kenyon's ruling that allowed Van de Kamp to 
pursue a dissolution of the merger, and the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 
that only the federal government could break up a completed merger. Judge J. 
Clifford Wallace said state attorneys had no legal right to challenge the 
merger once the FTC had approved it. 
</P>
<P>
As the case goes to trial in Los Angeles, state attorneys are encouraged by 
Judge Kenyon's finding that state officials had supplied "overwhelming 
statistical evidence . . . that the merger will substantially lessen 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
But American Stores, based in Salt Lake City, contends that the merged chain 
could operate more efficiently and thereby save consumers money. 
</P>
<P>
The case directly affects only Southern California, since Alpha Beta, which now 
has 175 stores, does not operate in the northern part of the state. Lucky now 
has 373 California stores, including 185 in Southern California. Together, 
Lucky and Alpha Beta would be the largest chain in the southern part of the 
state.

AS TENSIONS EASE, ANALYSTS ASK: 'WHAT DO WE DO NOW?'

<P>
When Lutz Unterseher, a West German military analyst, visited Washington 
recently, one of his first and most insistent questions was whether any U.S. 
defense planners had committed suicide yet. 
</P>
<P>
The answer, so far, appears to be no. But for analysts of military affairs 
inside and outside the Pentagon, the virtual dissolution of the "big war" 
scenario in Central Europe has caused personal and professional uncertainty and 
more than a little depression. 
</P>
<P>
For the U.S. and European military establishments, the East-West military 
face-off has been the central fixture of all military analysis since the onset 
of the Cold War. The Warsaw Pact's designs upon Western Europe, it seemed, 
would endure forever. 
</P>
<P>
All that changed after democratic revolutions swept through Eastern Europe late 
in 1989. Even so great a skeptic as Defense Secretary Dick Cheney concluded 
recently that the prospect is "extremely remote" that the Soviets and their 
allies would join forces to attack Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the scholars and service personnel who have spent their careers 
analyzing history's most dangerous potential armed confrontation have seen 
their work in ruins, their scholarly tomes overtaken by world events and their 
professional futures in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like graduation," said one Army analyst, evoking the bittersweet tones of 
a high school valedictory address. "We're asking ourselves, 'What do we do 
now?' " 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be very difficult for this building to make the transition," one 
Pentagon official said recently. "If you give up the Soviet threat, you're 
looking into an abyss." 
</P>
<P>
In the military services, where legions of officers spent their days analyzing 
the European balance of forces, prospects for promotions and post-retirement 
jobs suddenly look clouded. At research firms that have grown rich analyzing 
the face-off between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, future Pentagon contracts are 
expected to dwindle. 
</P>
<P>
And in universities and independent research institutions across the country, 
student interest and foundation support for research appear to be drying up or 
shifting to other fields. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is especially ironic for those outside analysts who have argued 
for years that the Pentagon has been inflating the military threat to Western 
Europe to boost U.S. defense budgets. The virtual dissolution of the Warsaw 
Pact and the Soviets' admission that their military needs a major overhaul 
appear to have vindicated these analysts' longstanding claims that the Soviets 
had neither the reliable allies nor the quality weapons and organization to win 
a war in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"Just when a new breed of independent analysts had become really sophisticated 
in the way we approach national security problems and dissect military 
requirements, the canonical problem has gone away," lamented Paul Stares, a 
military analyst at the Washington-based Brookings Institution who is writing a 
book on NATO's military and political command structure. "There's a sense of 
wondering how much of what you've done is still relevant. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
At the Pentagon, the significance of the changes has been somewhat blunted by 
day-to-day events -- at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
"The changes are so mind-boggling and the Pentagon is so bureaucratized, 
analysts are kept from coming to grips with the changes by the press of 
day-to-day events," said Ralph Hallenbeck, a recently retired Army colonel who 
has become a consultant at a Washington-based research firm. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with the new uncertainty and with the prospects of shrinking military 
manpower rolls, many soldiers/military analysts are putting the brightest face 
they can on the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got years of my life invested in that border that just opened up," one 
Army officer said. "But there's no sense of loss; there's a tremendous sense of 
accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, I feel so good, I'm ready to go seek employment elsewhere."

THE WASHINGTON SYSTEM'S 1983 DEFAULT SET A RECORD. BUT ECONOMIC GROWTH AND

Lee Oxsen still winces at the nickname that was affixed to his utility back 
when it was synonymous with wild cost overruns in nuclear power construction. 
</P>
<P>
Oxsen much prefers "Supply System." His preference is understandable. In 1983, 
when the Washington Public Power Supply System defaulted on $2.25 billion in 
bonds in the biggest municipal bond failure ever, nothing summed up its 
problems better than the acronym WHOOPS. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the nickname seems dated. Emboldened by recent successes and faced with 
booming growth in the Northwest, WPPSS officials are wondering whether they can 
reclaim one or maybe even both of the nuclear plants mothballed since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"There is, slowly but surely, growing support for renewing the nuclear option," 
said Oxsen, who has spent 34 years in the nuclear industry and took the job of 
running WPPSS' No. 1 operating nuclear plant in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the 1,100-megawatt facility called WNP No. 2 was shut down more 
often than it was running. But last week, WNP No. 2 on the Hanford Nuclear 
Reservation in eastern Washington ended the best run in its six-year history. 
It churned out power for more than 200 days straight before it was turned off 
for routine maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
"The longer they operate the plant safely, the more people they will convince 
that nuclear power is a viable option," said Sharon Blair, spokeswoman for the 
Bonneville Power Adminis- tration, a federal regional power agency. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the default, WPPSS is now selling more bonds than ever. By year's end, 
it will have sold nearly $4-billion worth in a refinancing effort. The sales 
program also proves WPPSS still can attract investors. That clears "one 
obstacle to completing the projects" if the utility decides to raise money to 
complete the mothballed plants, a recent Bonneville report said. 
</P>
<P>
Not far from WNP No. 2, sagebrush grows where thousands of workers once parked 
their cars and pickup trucks while they welded steel and poured cement in one 
of the most ambitious nuclear projects ever undertaken. In all, WPPSS had 
planned to build five plants, three on the Hanford reservation and two more at 
Satsop, near Olympia. 
</P>
<P>
Then costs got out of hand. A state judge ruled that the utility districts that 
made up the WPPSS consortium did not have the authority to raise rates to pay 
added interest costs, so WPPSS defaulted on the bonds sold to finance two of 
the plants. Since then workers have been turning those two into scrap. 
</P>
<P>
A federal judge is set to hold a hearing in July to divide a $750-million 
settlement among 25,000 holders of bonds sold to finance those two plants. They 
will get 24 to 40 cents for every dollar they invested, lawyers say. 
</P>
<P>
But the other two uncompleted plants now await a better day. Inspirational 
signs posted along the road at the Hanford reservation leading to the 
mothballed edifice called WNP No. 1 are new. "We can make it happen," a sign 
tells workers who remain. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, the plant looks like an unopened package. There are no cobwebs. Not 
even an insect can be detected. It is two-thirds complete and is maintained at 
a cost of $5 million a year, like WPPSS' other nuke-in-waiting in western 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Bonneville will issue a report this summer that likely will reflect little 
support for finishing the two mothballed plants. But Bonneville officials also 
say nuclear power is gaining favor as public concern grows over the global 
warming associated with fossil fuel. 
</P>
<P>
And the fact that refinancing is under way on the bonds WPPSS did not default 
on is remarkable in itself. 
</P>
<P>
But the utility might find it tougher going if it tries to take one of its 
plants out of mothballs. "There will be a tremendous battle if they try to turn 
them back on," said Lloyd Marbet, an anti-nuclear activist across the Columbia 
River in Oregon.

Several thousand people turned out in Lithuania on Monday to mourn a man who 
became a martyr of the republic's bid for independence by burning himself to 
death in a Moscow square last week. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis was among 5,000 people who filed 
through the center of the capital, Vilnius, behind the coffin of Stanislovas 
Zhamaitis, 52. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the greatest sacrifices that could have been made for 
Lithuania," Landsbergis said of Zhamaitis, who poured gasoline over himself 
outside the Bolshoi Theater on Thursday and died later the same day. 
</P>
<P>
In a note to his wife and two children, Zhamaitis said he could not go on 
living in an occupied country. Moscow has sent troop reinforcements to 
Lithuania and imposed a partial economic blockade on the republic. 
</P>
<P>
The fresh sign of popular support for Lithuania's March 11 bid for independence 
coincides with conflicting signals over the possibility of a solution to the 
seven-week-old crisis between Vilnius and Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Romualdas Ozolas declared in a Danish newspaper interview 
published Monday that Lithuania is ready to freeze its declaration of 
independence to bring Moscow to the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
However, at a news conference later in Vilnius, Ozolas appeared to contradict 
his earlier remarks, saying Lithuania is prepared only to suspend laws passed 
since the independence declaration. 
</P>
<P>
In the Ukraine, meanwhile, hard-line dissidents decided to form the republic's 
first major non-Communist political party with a program calling for secession 
from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
A congress of the Ukrainian Helsinki Union, founded as a human rights group in 
1976, voted late Sunday to rename itself the Ukrainian Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
The congress adopted a program calling for "the creation of an independent 
Ukrainian state" as the new party's first goal. 
</P>
<P>
It also called for a market economy with both public and private property and 
the step-by-step closure of nuclear power stations. 
</P>
<P>
In Latvia, leaders of the Latvian Popular Front blamed a local whiplash of fear 
over the Lithuanian criss for the nationalist group's poor showing in key 
runoff elections. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a fear of Moscow and more economic sanctions," Popular Front Vice 
President Ivars Godmanis said.

VATICAN, ROMANIA TO RE-ESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC TIES CUT 40 YEARS AGO

The Vatican and Romania have decided to re-establish diplomatic relations after 
a 40-year break, the Vatican said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
No date was given, but papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro said it will be soon. 
</P>
<P>
Romanian officials said in Bucharest that ties will be restored in mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
The fall of the hard-line Communist regimes in Central Europe over the last 
year has allowed the Vatican to expand its influence in the region. Pope John 
Paul II's native Poland, which is predominantly Roman Catholic, restored 
Vatican ties in July. Hungary did so in February, and Czechoslovakia did so 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican and the Soviet Union have also established official ties for the 
first time. The ties are short of full diplomatic relations. 
</P>
<P>
The decision on Romania was made during a visit to the country by Archbishop 
Angelo Sodano, the Vatican's foreign affairs chief. He went to Romania on 
Thursday, heading a delegation sent to install bishops appointed by the Pope 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
Relations with Romania were cut off in 1950, the Vatican said. 
</P>
<P>
There are 2.8 million Catholics from the Roman and Eastern rites in Romania, a 
country of 23 million people, it said.

</P>
<P>
SOUTHEAST ASIA: THE BURMESE WILL SOON VOTE IN THE FIRST MULTI-PARTY BALLOTING 
IN 30 YEARS. BUT WESTERN DIPLOMATS SAY THE ELECTIONS ALREADY 'ARE NOT FREE AND 
FAIR.'

A month before the Burmese hold their first multi-party elections in 30 years, 
the hermit-like military government has launched daily attacks on the 
democratic opposition and given clear signs that it has no intention of 
surrendering power, no matter what the results of the voting, Western diplomats 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of interviews, the diplomats said the elections "already are not 
free and fair" because there is no freedom of speech or assembly in Myanmar 
(formerly Burma), and the leaders of the opposition are either in jail or under 
house arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Conceding that there are few meaningful contacts permitted between diplomats 
based in Myanmar and the Burmese people to gauge popular sentiment, one envoy 
nonetheless suggested there is evidence that if the elections were truly free, 
there is "no doubt" that the leading opponent of military rule, the National 
League for Democracy, would win the election for a people's assembly. 
</P>
<P>
The league's leaders, Aung Sang Suu Kyi, the daughter of an independence hero, 
and Tin U, a former army chief of staff, have been under house arrest since 
last July. 
</P>
<P>
The election is being held May 27 for the assembly, whose task will be to draw 
up a new constitution. The military government, known as the Supreme Law and 
Order Restoration Council, has indicated that it will not hand over power until 
a constitution acceptable to the military has been adopted. 
</P>
<P>
The council seized power Sept. 18, 1988, after months of disturbances in which 
troops killed thousands of demonstrators, most of them students. 
</P>
<P>
It quickly changed the official name of Burma to Myanmar. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said the government's concern over the strength of the democratic 
parties has been evident in a series of attacks in these closing days of the 
election campaign, stridently condemning politicians as corrupt and incapable 
of governing. 
</P>
<P>
Some opposition figures were released from jail in late April, with the 
apparent hope that they would foment factionalism and splinter the opposition, 
a diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
The election is being conducted in an atmosphere extraordinary even by the 
ascetic standards of the Myanmar government. Western diplomats are not 
permitted to travel outside the capital. Journalists have been banned for nine 
months, and even Western tourists are being kept out during May. 
</P>
<P>
Between 5,000 and 8,000 people rounded up last summer remain in prison, and 
arbitrary detentions of opposition figures are continuing, according to the 
diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, there have been mass relocations of people from Yangon 
(formerly Rangoon) to towns as far as 100 miles away. Diplomats said the forced 
relocations, involving at least 200,000 people in the capital, appear to serve 
the dual purpose of punishing the democracy movement's constituency in the 
lower-middle classes and beautifying the city in a form of instant urban 
renewal. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomats said it is unclear if provision has been made to allow the 
relocated people to vote in their new localities, which are described as being 
Spartan and malarial. The relocations have further embittered the people toward 
the government, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the traditional Burmese belief that the people exist to serve the needs 
and whims of the leadership," commented one envoy. "There is no sense of 
reciprocal obligation." 
</P>
<P>
The diplomats said a personality cult appears to have developed around Maj. Gen 
Khin Nyunt, the chief of military intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress is currently considering legislation to ban imports such as 
teak from Myanmar to protest the country's human rights violations and 
involvement with the opium trade. 
</P>
<P>
Melvyn Levitsky, an assistant secretary of state for narcotics matters, 
recently charged during a tour of the area that the Myanmar government had a 
"collusive" relationship with major narcotics dealers, who are shipping more 
than 2,000 tons of opium to America each year. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to dispel this image, the Myanmar government on Monday held a 
"drug burning" ceremony attended by agents of the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration in which it was claimed that more than $500 million worth of 
seized narcotics was destroyed.

NORIEGA'S LEGAL TEAM ASKS TO QUIT;

<P>
NARCOTICS: THE EX-DICTATOR'S LAWYERS CRY FOUL. THEY SAY SEIZURE OF HIS ASSETS 
HAS LEFT HIM UNABLE TO AFFORD A DEFENSE.

<P>
Manuel A. Noriega's attorneys on Monday asked to withdraw from his 
drug-trafficking case, saying there is no money to pursue a defense because the 
U.S. government has frozen all the deposed Panama leader's assets. 
</P>
<P>
In a motion filed in federal court here, the team of four lawyers said that the 
Bush Administration is intentionally sabotaging their client's chance of 
winning what necessarily will be a costly and lengthy legal battle. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no doubt that the Administration's refusal to negotiate over legal 
fees is in part motivated by its belief that without experienced counsel and 
adequate resources, (Noriega) will decide to fold," their motion reads. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the attorneys -- Frank A. Rubino, Steven Kollin and Jon May -- then 
called a press conference to complain that they had gone months without payment 
and their debts were into "six-figure numbers." 
</P>
<P>
"We want to stay on the case and we want to represent the general," Rubino 
said, but conducting an adequate defense would require millions of dollars for 
"hiring three or four more lawyers . . . a half-dozen law clerks . . . two or 
three more secretaries . . . at least a half-dozen investigators . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Surely, the lawyers insisted, not every penny Noriega ever made was tainted by 
drugs, even if the federal government can prove all the allegations in its 
indictment against him. 
</P>
<P>
"They have taken every single thing in his house, his cars, his bank accounts . 
. . his children's bank accounts . . . his wife's bank accounts . . . 
essentially everything he owns, with the exception of the clothes on his back," 
Rubino said. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, the government had little public response to the attorneys' 
motion or to their broadsides. "Mr. Noriega has been accorded all the 
protections of due process and right to counsel," Dexter Lehtinen, the U.S. 
attorney in Miami, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing the government has done regarding illegally obtained assets has 
infringed on these rights in any way." 
</P>
<P>
Diane Cossin, speaking for Lehtinen, added that the accusations in the 
attorney's motion would be "answered directly in open court" during a hearing 
before U.S. Judge William M. Hoeveler that is scheduled for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Federal law permits the freezing of a defendant's assets before trial if the 
prosecution can show that the property was profit from criminal acts. 
</P>
<P>
This was done in Noriega's case. Among other assets, the government confiscated 
$5.8 million in cash from the dictator's home in Panama after he was arrested 
in January. It also froze a reported $20 million from at least five bank 
accounts in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Rubino said he "guesses" that about $50 million has been tied up, and insisted 
that he knows of no other available funds, though U.S. investigators reportedly 
have estimated Noriega's holdings at $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
More than two weeks ago, the defense lawyers asked the prosecutors to release 
enough money to cover their rapidly accumulating expenses. "It would just be 
ludicrous for them to state that every single thing (Noriega) owns . . . was 
purchased with drug funds," Rubino said. 
</P>
<P>
They had been assured, the attorneys said, that their request would be relayed 
to higher-ups in Washington. Then, last Friday, they were informed that no 
money would come their way. 
</P>
<P>
This left the defense team little choice but to appeal to the trial judge, 
according to Sheldon Krantz, chairman of the criminal justice section of the 
American Bar Assn. "In specific cases, the court can step in and tell the 
government to unfreeze some assets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So the attorneys' hope now is that Judge Hoeveler will intervene. Beyond that, 
they clearly intend to try shaming the federal government by alleging that the 
prosecution is not playing fair even as the whole world is watching. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure (prosecutors) are hoping that (Noriega) will be given a 
court-appointed lawyer, one that has a year or two of experience and has maybe 
tried two or three cases, maybe with the aid of one part-time investigator," 
Rubino said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how they want to try the case. Actually, it's like they want to shoot 
fish in a barrel." 
</P>
<P>
Noriega is being held in a federal prison southwest of Miami. His trial, 
already postponed several times, currently is set to begin next April.

Former Philippines first lady Imelda Marcos was back in court Monday at her 
racketeering trial, wearing heart and blood pressure monitors. 
</P>
<P>
She had left the courtroom pale and sobbing during testimony Friday and her 
illness was diagnosed as high blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
She sat holding rosary beads as U.S. Customs Service official Leslie Kinney 
described a suitcase seized from the Marcoses containing negotiable stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Kinney also identified 22 cardboard cartons, each about a foot square, that he 
said contained currency totaling 27 million Philippine pesos -- worth about 
$1.4 million in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
He said two other suitcases contained mostly jewelry. Pictures of the jewelry 
were given to the jury after the judge agreed with a defense request that the 
suitcases and one of the boxes, on view at the front of the courtroom, need not 
be opened. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos, 60, is charged with racketeering, conspiracy, fraud and obstruction of 
justice for allegedly plotting with her husband to divert more than $200 
million from the Philippines treasury for personal use. 
</P>
<P>
The money was allegedly used for art and real estate investments around the 
world.

John F. Kennedy Jr. flunked the New York state bar exam for a second time and 
has one last chance to pass or lose his job as an assistant prosecutor, a 
spokeswoman for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office confirmed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"All assistants get three chances. 
</P>
<P>
It's a long-standing office policy," said Colleen Roche, spokeswoman for 
Manhattan Dist. Atty. Robert M. Morgenthau. 
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old only son of assassinated President John F. Kennedy will get his 
last shot at passing the grueling exam in July. If he passes, he gets a $1,000 
raise. If he fails, he loses his $30,000-a-year job. 
</P>
<P>
Roche said 58 members of the most recent class of 65 recruits passed the bar 
the first time around. Of the seven who flunked and took it a second time, at 
least two have passed.

EDGARDO CONTINI; ARCHITECT, URBAN PLANNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON, Whiteson is a free-lance writer who covers architecture for 
The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Edgardo Contini, an architect, engineer and urban designer described by his 
colleagues as the conscience of the planning profession in Los Angeles, died 
Saturday of complications of cancer at his home in West Los Angeles. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Ferrara, Italy, and trained at the University of Rome, Contini was 
first drafted into the Italian army but then was ousted under Benito 
Mussolini's "Racial Manifesto." Contini was a member of a prominent 
Jewish-Italian family. 
</P>
<P>
Contini emigrated to the United States in 1939 and served in the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers in Europe during World War II. After the war he settled in 
Los Angeles and in 1951 became a founding partner of the firm of Gruen 
Associates. At Gruen, Contini was responsible for planning many major Los 
Angeles projects, including the Pacific Design Center and the Fox Hills Mall. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979 Contini was appointed president of the Urban Innovations Group, the 
practicing arm of the UCLA Graduate School of Architecture and Urban Planning. 
At UIG, Contini participated in the Grand Avenue proposal for the development 
of California Plaza on Bunker Hill and in the planning of the expansion of the 
Beverly Hills Civic Center with architect Charles Moore. 
</P>
<P>
Contini lectured at UCLA, the USC School of Architecture, the Southern 
California Institute of Architecture and the Art Center College of Design. He 
was active in the Urban Design Advisory Coalition and contributed articles on 
urban design and planning to many professional journals. 
</P>
<P>
He also received numerous awards, including the Harlan Bartholomew Award and 
the prestigious Fellow of the American Institute of Architects, bestowed 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
In sponsoring Contini for that fellowship, architect Frank Gehry wrote: 
"Edgardo is a rare combination: a creative design talent who also possesses a 
technical, practical sensibility coupled with a gift for making people 
understand." 
</P>
<P>
Contini described his design philosophy as a desire "to create opportunities 
out of problems . . . what better challenge, what greater pleasure?" 
</P>
<P>
He was a lifelong advocate of renewing and recycling urban buildings rather 
than continuing to erect new ones. 
</P>
<P>
As long ago as 1972 he wrote that "if we should place the emphasis on 
recycling, no further withdrawal from our resources of open land would be 
required . . . and by moving on to something new, (we will) escape the 
responsibility for the urban litter we leave behind." 
</P>
<P>
On his retirement from UIG in 1984, friends and colleagues established the 
Edgardo Contini Lecture at the UCLA School of Architecture and Urban Planning 
in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
Contini is survived by his wife, Phyllis; three children from a former 
marriage, John, Nora and Barbara, and a grandson.

A 60-year-old man was sentenced to 30 years in prison without parole under 
provisions of a federal law that jails so-called career criminals for 
possessing a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Alexander Alvarez, of San Diego, who has 14 prior felony convictions, 
was arrested after he pulled a loaded handgun on a motel manager, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Under provisions of the federal Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984, anyone with 
three or more prior convictions for violent or drug-related felonies can be 
jailed for possessing a firearm for from 15 years to life without possibility 
of parole. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez had been convicted and imprisoned over the past four decades for an 
array of serious crimes, including robbery, residential burglary, grand theft 
and assault on a police officer, prosecutors said.

BROWN DOUBTFUL ABOUT CRANSTON HOPES; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE ASSEMBLY SPEAKER SAID HE BELIEVES THAT THE SENATOR WILL NOT 
SURVIVE POLITICALLY WITHOUT HEROIC MEASURES.

<P>
California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown said Monday that Sen. Alan Cranston 
(D-Calif.) cannot win reelection in 1992 unless he is vindicated by Senate 
investigators and then dramatically restores his tarnished image. 
</P>
<P>
In his most outspoken comments on Cranston's travails, Brown, a San Francisco 
Democrat, also criticized Cranston for soliciting $850,000 from financier 
Charles H. Keating Jr. for voter registration drives. The Senate Ethics 
Committee is investigating the liberal senator's dealings with Keating, the 
conservative owner of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
"If you ask me whether or not I would have taken $800,000 for a cause that I 
believed in from a political opponent philosophically and think that that was 
OK, no, I would not have done that," Brown said at a luncheon he held for 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you could, in your wildest imagination, increase the level of 
suspicion and doubt (a voter would have about) a politician who would do that." 
</P>
<P>
Brown was asked about Cranston during an annual 2 1/2-day visit to the Capitol 
by an Assembly and Senate delegation. Even as he insisted that it would be 
premature to write Cranston's political obituary, the Speaker made it clear he 
believes that the senator needs heroic measures to survive. 
</P>
<P>
With potential Democratic challengers already jostling for position, Brown said 
Cranston could win a four- or five-way primary with 18% to 25% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
But, Brown added, if circumstances in November, 1992, are similar to those 
today, "we'd lose that U.S. Senate seat (to a Republican). I don't believe that 
Cranston at this stage of the game can win that U.S. Senate seat." 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Ethics Committee and the Justice Department are investigating 
allegations that Cranston and four other U.S. senators, all of whom received 
donations from Keating, improperly intervened on Lincoln's behalf with federal 
regulators who were investigating the thrift. When Lincoln was eventually 
seized for mismanagement, it became the biggest thrift failure in U.S. history, 
costing taxpayers an estimated $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston has strongly denied any wrongdoing in the Lincoln matter. He maintains 
that the voter registration funds and $39,000 in campaign contributions he 
raised from Keating had nothing to do with his contacts with federal regulators 
on Lincoln's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, he said, he went to bat for the thrift because it employs hundreds of 
people in Southern California. Cranston has declared his intent to seek a fifth 
term in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to Brown's remarks, Cranston spokesman Kam Kuwata said: "The 
circumstances are ever-changing. We know there will be a full hearing by the 
(Ethics) committee, and we are confident that they are going to say he did 
nothing wrong. And then we start to rebuild." 
</P>
<P>
Kuwata called Brown's criticism of Cranston for accepting large contributions 
from a political foe "a nonsense argument. . . . Is Willie Brown saying he has 
never raised any money from people who have not voted for him?" 
</P>
<P>
Brown said Cranston had fallen so far because his integrity had been beyond 
reproach for so long. In addition to being cleared by the inquiries, Brown said 
Cranston now needs a flood of positive media exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said this might mean that Cranston would have to "stop crack from flowing 
in the streets," provide child care for "every working parent in California," 
increase affordable housing or reduce air pollution in the state's smoggiest 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
"So, it's hopeless?" a reporter asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Not really hopeless," Brown said. "In that vein, if tomorrow they went out 
there to repair the (malfunctioning Hubble Space) Telescope and he went with 
them, he'd have a shot." 
</P>
<P>
During the recent Democratic state convention, Brown said he was seated beside 
Cranston on the podium. On the other side of the senator was the nameplate of 
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, a Democratic candidate for governor. 
</P>
<P>
Brown recalled, "Van de Kamp, as Cranston's chatting with me, gets his sign and 
switches it over so he's next to (Senate Democratic leader) Barry Keene. And he 
puts (State Democratic Chairman) Edmund G. Brown Jr. next to Cranston. Now, I 
interpret that as . . . the shot from the evening news and you don't want to be 
in close proximity to a guy who might look like he's wearing stripes." 
</P>
<P>
Brown supports Van de Kamp's principal opponent -- ex-San Francisco Mayor 
Dianne Feinstein -- in the June 5 gubernatorial primary. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwata responded that overall, Cranston "got a very warm response at the 
convention." 
</P>
<P>
Brown has occasionally come under fire on ethics issues himself. On Monday, a 
reporter asked him about media allegations that he had in his private law 
practice represented clients who had business with the state. 
</P>
<P>
"I represent nobody who has any business with the state of California," the 
lawmaker responded. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't do anything wrong," he added. "I have a good time and I enjoy my 
life."

CONNECTICUT GOVERNOR SIGNS FIRST BILL GRANTING RIGHT TO ABORTION 
</P>

<P>
Connecticut on Monday became the first state to give women the legal right to 
abortion in a law intended to stand even if the Supreme Court reverses its 1973 
decision legalizing abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision said states cannot ban abortions, but if the 
ruling were struck down, states would then be able to make abortion illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Without ceremony, Democratic Gov. William A. O'Neill, a Roman Catholic who 
personally opposes abortion, signed the bill into law Monday afternoon. It 
takes effect Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The bill cleared the state Senate on Friday by a vote of 32 to 3, and the House 
the week before, 136 to 12. It repeals the state's unenforced criminal 
anti-abortion statutes, requires women under 16 to be counseled before getting 
an abortion and encourages them to tell their parents. 
</P>
<P>
In a variation on the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade ruling, the new law allows 
abortions late in pregnancy, when the fetus is capable of living outside the 
womb, only when the life or health of the mother is in danger. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe this measure strikes a balance between a person's right to privacy 
and state interests," the governor said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
"It recognizes a right to choice by women. The law also recognizes the state 
has an interest in fetus viability and properly recognizes that minors should 
be counseled before making the very difficult decision to abort a pregnancy," 
O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
Connecticut's anti-abortion laws were rendered unenforceable by Roe vs. Wade. 
They carried penalties of up to five years in prison and a $1,000 fine for 
anyone performing an abortion, and two years in prison and a $500 fine for 
women getting abortions, except to protect the life of the mother. 
</P>
<P>
State Rep. Nancy Wyman, one of several Democrats who crafted the bill, said 
O'Neill, with his personal opposition to abortion, made a difficult decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that it's not truly with his conscience," Wyman said. "He's doing 
something that is good for the women of Connecticut." 
</P>
<P>
Kate Michelman of the National Abortion Rights League said she could "count on 
one hand" the number of other states where similar legislation could pass.

TRAILER DUMPS SOD, CLOSING HIGHWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California 34 was closed Monday night after a tractor-trailer accidentally 
dumped its load of sod on the two-lane roadway east of Las Posas Road, the 
California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
A CHP dispatcher said the driver lost control of his vehicle while heading 
toward Somis, and the truck ended up in a ditch alongside the highway. The 
dispatcher said she did not know if the driver was injured or if other vehicles 
were involved. 
</P>
<P>
The road was closed for several hours Monday night because it required 
"extensive cleanup," the dispatcher said.

BOARD SEEKS TO NEARLY DOUBLE LOPEZ CANYON DUMP'S CAPACITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA , TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles city panel Friday recommended doubling the capacity of the 
controversial Lopez Canyon Landfill in Lake View Terrace and creating a 
$5-million fund to provide amenities such as new parks in the adjacent 
community. 
</P>
<P>
On a 4-0 vote, the city's Board of Public Works endorsed an expansion proposal 
aimed at reducing the noise and unsightliness caused by the dump's operations 
by relocating the access road used by city garbage trucks. City sanitation 
officials said those revisions would cut into the landfill's capacity and 
shorten its usable life span by several years. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion of the city-owned landfill would allow for an increase in the 
number of trucks -- from 400 to 650 -- using the dump each day and would extend 
the working life of the dump through the year 2005. The expansion would nearly 
double the dump's capacity to 26 million tons. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ernani Bernardi called the board's recommendations an "encouraging 
first step" toward reducing the "level of misery" of residents living near the 
dump. "But we're still not satisfied," said Bernardi, who represents the area. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi said the city should cut the number of trucks hauling garbage to Lopez 
Canyon to 200 a day from 400. 
</P>
<P>
Instrumental in producing the plan were board members Felicia Marcus, an 
environmental lawyer, and Percy Duran, a lawyer and former executive with a 
private solid waste management firm. The two are the most junior members of the 
board, which is run by appointees of Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
The modified plan also was endorsed earlier by the city's Solid Waste Citizens 
Advisory Group, whose 15 members are appointed by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The $5-million amenities fund was characterized by the Public Works Board as an 
effort to become a "good neighbor." Board members said it could be used, for 
example, to create recreational facilities, plant trees or for other 
mitigations of the dump's negative impacts. 
</P>
<P>
Duran had earlier said he would consider using such a fund to make cash 
payments to people who live near the dump. But that idea was not among the 
suggested uses for the money. 
</P>
<P>
The modified plan adopted by the Public Works Board allowed the increase in the 
number of trucks sought by the city Bureau of Sanitation, but the 
recommendation to relocate the so-called haul road to the landfill effectively 
trimed several years off the dump's life span, bureau executives Mike Miller 
and Malcolm Toy said. 
</P>
<P>
The bureau plan called for the road to wind up the outer face of a ridge that 
forms one side of the bowl-shaped dump. Under this plan, the road and the 
trucks on it would be visible to homeowners, and the noise from the trucks 
grinding up the hill would be annoying, according to environmental documents. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental documents said these impacts were significant and could not 
be lessened. 
</P>
<P>
The plan adopted by the board, however, called for the haul road to wind up the 
inner face of the same ridge. With the road and trucks inside the bowl, their 
impact would be reduced, the board said. 
</P>
<P>
Bureau of Sanitation officials, after more than two hours of public hearings on 
the expansion, said they could accept the modified plan -- even though it would 
reduce the dump's capacity below what they had sought. 
</P>
<P>
Another motion introduced Friday by Bernardi called on the city to guarantee 
that it would never use as a landfill 400 acres it is now seeking to buy around 
Lopez Canyon. The property is being purchased as a buffer zone to the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the council agreed to enter into a partnership with the County Board 
of Supervisors to develop a landfill at Elsmere Canyon, situated north of Santa 
Clarita. That agreement includes a pledge to close Lopez Canyon as a landfill 
within one year of Elsmere Canyon being opened as a dump.

COUNTY ISSUE TENT CITY JAIL FOR DRUG USERS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As part of stepped-up enforcement of minor drug offenses, Sheriff John V. 
Gillespie has proposed housing jail inmates in two to four tents on a military 
base. This would avoid further crowding of the County Jail. Gillespie is 
negotiating with the Port Hueneme Naval 
</P>
<P>
Construction Battalion Center to place the tents there. Inmates would be 
assigned to work on the base and to clean parks and beaches. They would also be 
required to attend substance-abuse classes or counseling sessions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Michael D. Bradbury 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County district attorney 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something the sheriff and I had discussed for about six months and 
researched. As a general concept, I favor it. It would incarcerate people 
presently avoiding jail time because of overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
With this halfway-tent approach, we'll be able to once again place some 
sanctions on the casual use and possession of drugs. Judges may be more 
inclined to put people in facilities where they're working to help clean up and 
repair the military institution and the highways and beaches. And part of the 
plan is to provide the inmates with education and treatment. Those are very 
important goals toward reducing recidivism. Conceptually, I'm very supportive 
of the project and look forward to hearing more details." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Richard Bryce 
</P>
<P>
Assistant sheriff in charge of the county's jail system 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't ignore the fact that there is a serious, ongoing drug problem in the 
area not being attacked in the case of recreational drug users. They're the 
ones who are creating major problems. Because 
</P>
<P>
of them, people make millions of dollars a year and are gaining strength in 
Columbian drug cartels. We've got to find some way to crush the demand. 
Enforcement will bring people to the realization of what they're doing. If you 
saw a doctor or an attorney or a schoolteacher you respect in the newspaper 
arrested for possession and going to do 30 to 60 days in a drug rehabilitation 
center, it would shock you into realizing how serious your actions are. People 
in all walks of life are going to surface into this thing. A law is a law, and 
it ought to be enforced. . . . If anything, it will help us deal with the 
overcrowding. Some people in jail facilities now would be transferred to the 
tents. Hopefully, it would reduce the number of people we ran into in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kenneth I. Clayman 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County public defender 
</P>
<P>
 "Ithink that what we need for the individual who supposedly uses drugs is more 
treatment and less incarceration. Loading up the system with more and more 
cases would lead to an enormous financial 
</P>
<P>
drain. I believe that the project is pursuant to federal funds but that those 
federal funds would only go to the district attorney's office. The program 
would create a need for extra defense lawyers and extra prosecutors. It's a 
very expensive undertaking. There's also a great risk that people will be 
warehoused and not treated, although the tent city may provide more treatment 
than other facilities. I'm not sure the whole approach of going after the 
casual drug user is correct. I'm not sure it's worth it to criminalize another 
whole segment of the population." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Karrol Maughmer 
</P>
<P>
realtor and president, Port Hueneme Chamber of Commerce 
</P>
<P>
 "Idespise drugs. I would strongly support the sheriff's plan, assuming the 
Navy is agreeable to being incarcerated on their premises, because it's not 
fair to further crowd the jails. The Navy, I am sure, would 
</P>
<P>
take very good care of the project. The so-called casual drug user is not too 
likely to be a problem anyway, but I am sure their security would be well 
enforced. The base borders Oxnard, so it affects both the communities of Oxnard 
and Port Hueneme. But I think any incarceration of drug abusers is to the 
benefit of both communities. I can't imagine that residents would be any more 
concerned than I am because we have an exceptionally outstanding Police 
Department in Port Hueneme, and the combination of that and the Navy security 
would alleviate any concern of residents. I don't think the impact will even be 
felt by businesses. I don't think people will even be aware of it."

SOCKERS BEATEN BY STORM 
</P>

<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The difference between shouts and whispers was Claudio De Oliveira. 
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian midfielder darted to steal the ball from Socker defender Ralph 
Black, scooted up the carpet and around defender Kevin Crow and sent a shot 
singing into the right corner 8:05 into overtime Monday night to give St. Louis 
a 4-3 victory over the Sockers.. 
</P>
<P>
With the victory, St. Louis evened the best-of-five semifinal series, 1-1, 
snapped a 10-game winning streak for the Sockers in the San Diego Sports Arena 
and forced them to win one on the road. The series resumes tonight at 5:35 at 
St. Louis Arena. 
</P>
<P>
After the loss, in front of 5,875 spectators, came the quiet analysis. Black 
sat with his head in his hands and found it difficult to form words. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball just came off the boards harder than I thought," he said. "He took it 
off me. I just screwed up. I don't want to say any more." 
</P>
<P>
After leaving Black behind, De Oliveira froze Crow in the middle of the penalty 
box and goalie Victor Nogueira in goal. He celebrated his accomplishment with a 
little dance. 
</P>
<P>
"That's typical in Brazil," said De Oliveira, a first year player who led St. 
Louis with 27 goals in the regular season. "Sometimes I pressure and the coach 
doesn't like it. Black got the ball and I said that's the time." 
</P>
<P>
The coach, Don Popovic, didn't mind him pressuring this time one bit. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a franchise player," Popovic said. "He can do anything. He can pass and 
he can score. He doesn't understand indoor so well but he adjusted." 
</P>
<P>
Socker Coach Ron Newman thinks his team can do some adjusting of its own on the 
road, where the Sockers to date have won just six of 26 games. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not worried about playing in St. Louis at all," he said. "We've got no 
excuses. We've just got to suck it up and go after them." 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers almost pulled this one off after falling behind 3-1. Forward Rod 
Castro made good on his first shift, taking a restart kick from midfielder 
Branko Segota, turning to his left and sending it by goalie Slobo Ilijevski to 
tie it 3-3 early in the fourth quarter. Castro, a rookie, has picked his spots 
this season, starting hot, disappearing midway through and finishing hot. 
Monday's goal was his first MISL playoff point. 
</P>
<P>
Storm midfielder Michael Collins put the Storm ahead 2-1 early in the third 
quarter, sneaking behind the defense and waiting while forward Godfrey Ingram 
drew watchful eyes from the Sockers. Instead of shooting, Ingram sent a nice 
soft pass to Collins, who tapped it in quicker than the Sockers could turn 
their heads. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the quarter, the Sockers sat while the Storm shot. Midfielder Branko 
Segota was assessed a two-minute penalty for pushing forward Marcio Leite. 
Twenty-seven seconds later, the whistle blew again, this time directed at 
midfielder Brian Quinn for an intentional hand ball. That gave the Storm a 
two-man advantage and they capitalized, forward Thompson Usiyan taking a pass 
from Godfrey Ingram and crossing it into the left corner to make it 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
It was a game of highs and lows for the Sockers, who were looser and more 
cohesive in the first quarter than they were Saturday but appeared to have 
momentary lapses of intensity until Castro's goal gave them a lift in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
It was scoreless until forward Godfrey Ingram faked and went to the right of a 
frozen Quinn and sent a swift carpet-hugger into the left corner 3:54 into the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the quarter, Quinn served up a taste of his poetic skills following 
the rebound of his own shot and hitting a ball that was two feet off the ground 
into the left corner. Segota created the chance, sliding on his back to send 
the ball in Quinn's direction between two defenders. 
</P>
<P>
What happens now? Well, it's time for this team to prove itself. The 
speculation and the regular season are history. The road to St. Louis lies 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"We've just got to work harder," defender George Fernandez said. "We gave the 
ball up too many times. That's lack of concentration. Just a step slow." 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
"I have no answer. This is the playoffs. We should be flying all over the 
place." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they are flying to St. Louis in search of that answer. 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Brian Quinn had two assists in Saturday's 3-2 victory over St. Louis 
in Game 1 to move ahead of Jean Willrich into third place on the team's 
all-time playoff scoring list with 92 points. . . . Forward Jim Gabarra, who 
finished the regular season with 10 goals, scored the first game-winning 
playoff goal of his MISL career Saturday. . . . St. Louis forward Stan 
Terlecki, who had 35 points in the regular season, has missed both playoff 
games with bursitis in his right knee. . . . Peter Hattrup, a forward from the 
American Indoor Soccer Assn. signed by the Sockers last Friday, has not suited 
up for either playoff game. . . . Tonight's game will be telecast live from St. 
Louis starting at 5:30.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: NO SANCTIONS LEVIED AGAINST SDSU FOOTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego State University football program will not have sanctions levied 
against it by the California Community College Football Coaches' Assn., 
President Jack Jordan said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan telephoned SDSU Coach Al Luginbill Friday, after the committee voted 
against the sanctions at a meeting in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The group was considering sanctions because of complaints lodged by coaches at 
three community colleges last fall and stemmed from conversations they had with 
Luginbill about high school players Luginbill was recruiting in 1989. Howard 
Gay, coach at San Jose City College, accused Luginbill of acting improperly in 
steering Donnell Ragsdale from Oak Grove High in San Jose to Mesa College in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The coaches also alleged that Luginbill, in addition to acting improperly in 
the Ragsdale case, threatened to discredit their programs with coaches and 
players in their districts if they did not cooperate with him in his 
recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill denied the charges, calling them "ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
The committee could have imposed sanctions that prevented SDSU football coaches 
from recruiting on California community college campuses and obtaining game 
films and academic transcripts. SCOTT MILLER

RULING LIKELY TO DETOUR LUCKY, ALPHA BETA MERGER 
</P>

<P>
American Stores' plans to put together a huge California supermarket chain 
appeared to unwind Monday after the company suffered a major setback in U.S. 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said American, parent of Lucky and Alpha Beta stores, is now 
under pressure to seek an agreement that would settle the challenge by 
California Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp to the proposed combination of the 
two supermarket divisions. Neither the Attorney General's Office nor American 
would discuss the likelihood of a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Any out-of-court agreement probably would require American to sell some of its 
Lucky or Alpha Beta stores and accept curbs on its ability to buy other 
supermarkets in California. If efforts to settle fail, some analysts said, 
American might try to sell its entire Alpha Beta division, which has lost 
ground to competitors. 
</P>
<P>
American's plans to combine Alpha Beta and Lucky, which it bought for $2.5 
billion in June, 1988, were jolted by a Supreme Court decision allowing state 
authorities and others to contest mergers under federal antitrust law. 
</P>
<P>
American had argued that the authority for weighing mergers under U.S. law 
rested with such federal regulators as the Federal Trade Commission, which 
approved the proposed Alpha Beta-Lucky combination before Van de Kamp launched 
his challenge. American has operated Lucky -- already the state's largest chain 
-- and Alpha Beta largely as separate organizations while it waged its legal 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
Under Monday's ruling, American can still argue for allowing the merger on the 
grounds that the combination would not significantly reduce supermarket 
competition in Southern California. Industry observers, however, said the Salt 
Lake City-based company appears to be losing its will to continue its court 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
"Management at this point appears to be frustrated and flustered," said John 
Kosecoff, an analyst with the First Manhattan investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher O. B. Wright, an antitrust specialist with the law firm Latham 
&amp; Watkins in Los Angeles, predicted that American would settle its case 
rather than risk losing its court fight and being forced to sell its Lucky 
stores. He said that under the Supreme Court ruling, a lower court judge could 
order such a divestiture. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd expect that American Stores will go to the bargaining table pretty 
quickly," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
Observers also speculated that Van de Kamp is increasingly interested in a 
settlement. They said that Van de Kamp, a Democrat campaigning for governor who 
faces a primary vote in June, would like to resolve the dispute and devote his 
attention other issues. 
</P>
<P>
"He already has the big victory here," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael J. Strumwasser, a special assistant attorney general working on the 
case, said his office has been interested in an out-of-court agreement all 
along. Monday's ruling, he added, "certainly makes it easier to settle the 
case." But he declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
American and Van de Kamp already have reached settlements that have allowed two 
small parts of the proposed Lucky-Alpha Beta merger to go ahead. In November, 
American won the right to merge its stores in Northern California, where the 
company is less of a competitive force. Under the deal, American agreed to sell 
13 of its 36 Alpha Beta stores in Northern California and put the remaining 23 
stores under Lucky management and give them the Lucky name. American's merger 
plan has called for all of its current Alpha Beta stores to be operated under 
the Lucky name. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in January, Van de Kamp's office and American reached an agreement 
allowing the two chains' warehouses in Southern California to blend some 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Together, Lucky and Alpha Beta would be the leading supermarket chain in 
Southern California. According to recent market research, 29% of the households 
in Los Angeles and Orange counties buy most of their groceries at Lucky or 
Alpha Beta stores. In second place is Vons supermarkets, including the 
company's Pavilions stores, with a market share of 24%. 
</P>
<P>
For consumers, Monday's ruling may eventually provide some good news. Analysts 
and company officials have argued that the cost of running both Lucky and Alpha 
Beta has driven up American's expenses, and those expenses have been passed 
along to consumers in the form of higher prices. Any settlement, consequently, 
could help bring down those costs. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, Van de Kamp's office has argued that a full merger of Alpha Beta 
and Lucky, by cutting competition, would push up prices and cost California 
consumers more than $200 million a year. Taken in that light, a settlement 
could be crafted to eliminate those price increases. 
</P>
<P>
Lucky has 185 stores in the six-county Southern California region consisting of 
Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties. 
Throughout California, it has 373 stores, making it the state's No. 1 chain. 
</P>
<P>
Alpha Beta has 175 stores in Southern California, the only part of the state 
where it continues to do business. It ranks among the state's five largest 
chains. 
</P>
<P>
In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, American's shares fell $1.75, 
closing at $63.75.

MERC TRADERS TAKE BREAK FROM PITS TO LEARN ABOUT ETHICS; 
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES: ALL 2,500 MEMBERS OF THE FUTURES EXCHANGE IN CHICAGO ARE REQUIRED 
TO TAKE THE COURSE BECAUSE OF LAST YEAR'S FRAUD SCANDAL.

CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They were stepping out of a frenzied blur: The flash of hand signals, the 
brightly colored coats, the sweat and sore feet and hoarse voices of the young 
(almost exclusively male) traders who are smashed together, all day long, on 
the steps of the ruthless pits. 
</P>
<P>
Here, on the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Chicago is still the 
city of the big shoulders, the city that works, still my kind of town; here, 
where billions of dollars change hands in incomprehensible fashion in the Swiss 
franc pits, the live cattle pits, the Eurodollar option pits, Chicago still 
does what it has always done best, which is to provide a forum for capitalism 
at its most elemental. 
</P>
<P>
And yet just minutes removed from that organized melee, just after gathering 
their breath from shouting their last orders of the day, 55 of the Merc's best 
traders and brokers were brought to a sudden stop on Monday, forced to step 
across the street and into another world, where quiet contemplation would 
replace raw economics. 
</P>
<P>
The traders, still wearing their trading badges and vests, had come to the 
Chicago-Kent College of Law across Wacker Drive from the Mercantile Exchange in 
downtown Chicago for the first of the Merc's new ethics courses, now mandatory 
for all 2,500 of its members. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of last year's explosive commodities fraud scandal on Chicago's 
trading floors, the Merc's leadership had decided that a professionally 
developed seminar in ethics would at least help make traders more aware of the 
fact that, down in the pits, morals do apply. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole course is designed to get them to reflect on what their behavior (as 
traders) says about them as people, and what their behavior says about their 
trading system," observed Donna Sockell, a business ethics specialist at 
Columbia University's School of Business, who developed the program for the 
Merc. "We're not really teaching ethics. We're trying to get them to pause and 
reflect, to get away from the hustle of the pits and step back and think about 
what their choices say about them." 
</P>
<P>
Still, James Oliff, chairman of the Merc's ethics committee, stressed that the 
program is, in a sense, just preaching to the converted. The dozens of traders 
who were indicted or convicted in the federal inquiry have been suspended from 
the Merc and thus have not been invited. 
</P>
<P>
"We're approaching this as if our members are good, hard working professionals, 
who are here to take some professional training," Oliff insisted. "If we just 
encourage them to think about what their actions mean, then we've accomplished 
our job." 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics noted, however, that the course also performs another task for the 
Merc, by providing good public relations just one week before the first 
criminal trials are scheduled to begin in the widespread commodities fraud 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Some even say the new ethics program is symbolic of how much more aggressive 
the Merc has been -- compared to the more traditional Chicago Board of Trade -- 
on the public relations front since last year's scandal. The Board of Trade, 
Chicago's largest and oldest commodities exchange, is still studying whether to 
require its current members to attend an ethics program, although new members 
are exposed to ethics discussions during their orientation, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Merc has been more aggressive at public relations," observed Steven 
Senderwotz, a former assistant U.S. Attorney who prosecuted criminal cases in 
the commodities fraud area and who now defends traders in criminal cases. "The 
Merc is trying to do things in-house, to try to convince regulators that 
additional regulation is not necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the two-hour course did seem to make some impression; traders emerging 
from the classroom on the third floor of the law school came away impressed. 
"It was a good course, it was a good idea," said one trader who refused to give 
his name. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thrilled with their participation," gushed Richard Kling, the law 
professor who conducted the first session Monday. "I went in expecting anger 
and hostility from them, for having been forced to come here. There was some of 
that initially; they are angry that the alleged misconduct of a few has 
tarnished an entire industry. But eventually they became very involved in the 
discussion. At the end, some of them said thanks, you've opened my eyes." 
</P>
<P>
Although the session was closed to the press, Kling said the discussion focused 
largely on "gray areas," forcing the traders to think about hypothetical 
situations on the floor of the exchange in which the behavior described was not 
necessarily illegal, but still unethical. 
</P>
<P>
"For instance, we talked about what they would do if a customer said, 'I don't 
care what you do in the pits, as long as you make money (for the customer),' " 
said Kling. 
</P>
<P>
"And," Kling added happily, "they all said they would be willing to say no to a 
customer."

TIMES BECOMES NATION'S LARGEST METRO DAILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM ROSENSTIEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times has surpassed the New York Daily News to become the 
largest metropolitan daily newspaper in America in weekday circulation, 
according to preliminary figures released Monday by the Audit Bureau of 
Circulations. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers also offer some of the first insight available into what happened 
to the readers of the Los Angeles Herald Examiner after it closed last 
November. At the time of its demise, the Herald Examiner reported a circulation 
of roughly 230,000. However, perhaps up to 100,000 of those already bought a 
second newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Of the remainder, perhaps 50,000 to 70,000 now may have stopped reading a daily 
newspaper altogether, newspaper executives estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Of the rest, about two-thirds appear to have switched to the Los Angeles Times, 
Publisher David Laventhol has estimated. Another third, perhaps about 20,000 
more, may have taken other papers, particularly the Daily News, published in 
Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, The Times' weekday circulation for the six months ended March 31 rose 
by 90,237 to 1,210,077. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Daily News, in the meantime, shrank in weekday circulation by 
50,047 to 1,180,139, allowing The Times to surpass it. Two national circulation 
newspapers, the Wall Street Journal and USA Today, are still larger than The 
Times. Journal circulation is 1,935,866. USA Today circulation is 1,387,233. 
</P>
<P>
The Times' Sunday circulation also rose 81,230 to 1,504,540. That makes it the 
second-largest Sunday paper in the country, following the New York Times, which 
has a Sunday circulation of 1,706,013, about 300,000 of which comes from its 
national edition. The weekend edition of USA Today, published Fridays, sells 
1,753,537 copies. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times also seemed to reverse a trend of declining market share 
in Orange County, where it is locked in a battle for readers with the Orange 
County Register. 
</P>
<P>
The Times' weekday circulation increased 13,342 in Orange County to 179,981. 
Register circulation rose 4,054 to a total of 349,019. Register circulation in 
Orange County itself, however, rose by 349. 
</P>
<P>
On Sundays, Times circulation in Orange County rose 15,526, Times officials 
said. The Register rose 9,365, of which 6,838 was in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Roughly half of The Times' overall circulation growth came from picking up 
former readers of the Los Angeles Herald Examiner, Publisher Laventhol has 
said. For the six-month average, which includes about a month during which the 
Herald Examiner was still publishing, The Times shows a gain of about 50,000 
former Herald Examiner readers. 
</P>
<P>
But the actual number of Herald Examiner readers moving to other papers may be 
somewhat higher if the measure includes only the three-month average since 
January, after the Herald Examiner had expired. 
</P>
<P>
The three-month average for the Los Angeles Times, which appears on Page One, 
is, for instance, 15,000 higher than the six-month average, suggesting that The 
Times may have picked up 60,000 Herald readers. 
</P>
<P>
The second-largest beneficiary of the Herald Examiner's demise was apparently 
the Daily News in the San Fernando Valley. Daily News circulation rose 19,044 
on weekdays to 202,384 and 12,682 on Sundays to 214,205. 
</P>
<P>
Of that, circulation experts estimate that perhaps 10,000 may be from the 
Herald Examiner. Daily News executives were not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach Press-Telegram also appeared to gain Herald readers. Its 
circulation was up 4,614 to 134,071 weekdays. More than half that is from the 
Herald Examiner, estimated Dan Sidbury, Press-Telegram vice president of 
circulation. 
</P>
<P>
Sidbury said that in the numbers since January "we've picked up about 7,000 
daily from the Herald Examiner." 
</P>
<P>
Others inheriting Herald readers may include Copley Newspapers, which publishes 
the Daily Breeze in Torrance, the Santa Monica Evening Outlook and the San 
Pedro News-Pilot. Copley's circulation rose by 3,055 to 129,358. 
</P>
<P>
The San Gabriel Valley Tribune in West Covina also grew by 3,865 weekdays to 
63,742, some of it apparently attributable to the Herald. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena Star-News also gained circulation, some also partly because of the 
Herald, although direct comparisons to 1989 were unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
La Opinion, the city's leading Spanish-language daily, registered impressive 
gains, up by 12,321 weekdays to 101,873, but it was showing similar growth even 
before the Herald disappeared, suggesting that these gains reflect natural 
growth in its market.

Flight Testing of the B-2 Resumes: The United States has resumed flight-testing 
the B-2 Stealth bomber at Edwards Air Force Base after a scheduled five-month 
break for modifications to the radar-avoiding aircraft, the Defense Department 
said. The Pentagon said in a brief announcement that testing resumed Friday on 
the B-2, which first flew last July. Friday's flight lasted six hours and five 
minutes. The plane was refueled four times by a KC-10 tanker aircraft and 
reached an altitude of 35,000 feet during the successful flight, the Air Force 
said.

T-Bill Rates Advance: The Treasury sold $8.4 billion of new three-month bills 
at an average discount rate of 7.91%, up from 7.78% last week. 
</P>
<P>
Another $8.4 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount 
rate of 8.03%, up from 7.91% last week. The rates were the highest since 
three-month bills sold for 7.77% on March 19, and six-month bills averaged 
8.08% last June 19. The new discount rates understate the actual return to 
investors -- 8.18% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for 
$9,800.10, and 8.49% for a six-month bill selling for $9,594.00. The discount 
rate reflects the price discount received when government securities are 
purchased at less than face value.

Network Profits Increase: All three television networks posted modest to robust 
profit increases last year, according to estimates published by Broadcasting 
magazine. NBC network revenue declined 8% to $2.78 billion, principally due to 
lack of Olympic advertising it had in 1988, while operating profit rose 35% to 
$393 million. 
</P>
<P>
Capital Cities/ABC network TV revenue rose 1% to $2.42 billion while profit, 
after accounting adjustments, came in at $165 million. Even third-place CBS 
earned an estimated profit of $103.5 million on revenue of $2.31 billion, 
thanks largely to cost-cutting moves and a strong advertising market. But the 
big earners continued to be the TV station divisions, which earned $410 million 
for Cap Cities, $156.3 million for CBS and $270 million for NBC.

More Firms Join Infant Pillow Recall: Five more manufacturers of a type of 
infant pillow linked to the suffocation deaths of 19 children joined a 
nationwide recall of the items, the Consumer Product Safety Commission 
announced. The recall includes: "Comfort Tote," "Comfy Tote" and "Cushie 
Comfort" by Comfort Products; "Baby's Cloud" by U.S. Mom's of Las Vegas; 
"Sof-Sak" by MFP of Hays, Kan.; "Comfort Cushion" by Tailored Baby Inc., San 
Fernando; and "Baby Jacks Bean Bag" by Jumping-Jacks Shoes Inc., Monett, Mo. 
The pillows conform to the baby's shape and could engulf a child placed face

PEOPLE: TOP S&amp;L REGULATOR IN CALIFORNIA STEPS DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William J. Crawford, commissioner of the California Department of Savings and 
Loan, has officially retired from the post. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford, who turned 70 on Monday, indicated in February that he planned to 
retire from the job, which he held for five years. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach resident has also made it clear that he would like to be 
succeeded by his chief deputy, William D. Davis, 53, of Villa Park. Davis will 
serve as acting commissioner until Gov. George Deukmejian names a successor. 
</P>
<P>
The blunt-talking Crawford, who operated two S&amp;Ls before selling them, 
became known nationally during various hearings on the collapse of Lincoln 
Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine. Crawford was especially outspoken in his 
criticism of Lincoln's former owner, Charles H. Keating Jr., whom he once 
described as a "con man" during a state Assembly hearing.

Ames Department Stores Inc., the discount retailer that last week filed for 
bankruptcy protection, has named Stephen Pistner chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
He replaces Peter Hollis, who resigned. Rocky Hill, Conn.-based Ames said 
Pistner's appointment is subject to court approval. The 58-year-old served as 
president and chief operating officer of Dayton Hudson Corp. from 1977 to 1981 
after he successfully revived the Minneapolis-based retailer's lagging Target 
discount stores. In 1981, he joined Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., where he was 
credited with implementing the strategies that brought that retailer back to 
health.

LABOR: LORENZO'S OUSTER A START FOR STRIKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There just might be some justice soon for the thousands of Eastern Airlines 
workers fighting a long, discouraging battle against the company's recently 
ousted chairman, the combative Frank Lorenzo. 
</P>
<P>
Talks are under way to negotiate new union contracts and restructure Eastern, 
either through a merger with another airline or a buyout by private investors, 
with participation by the employees. 
</P>
<P>
The workers' struggle against Lorenzo's efforts to break their unions and force 
them to make even more financial sacrifices has achieved only two goals, 
neither of which materially helped them: 
</P>
<P>
* Their strike was a critical factor in a federal judge's decision to remove 
Lorenzo as Eastern's chairman, although the direct cause was pressure that was 
finally applied by the company's creditors and shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
His departure should help workers in the rest of the industry because it means 
that no longer will other airlines point to Lorenzo's devastating cuts in the 
wages and benefits of his employees as an excuse for trimming their own labor 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
* The court's action also brought some emotional satisfaction to the strikers 
and their allies since the court finally agreed with them that, as Bankruptcy 
Court Judge Burton R. Lifland put it: "Eastern's owner/manager as personified 
by (Lorenzo) is not competent to reorganize this estate." 
</P>
<P>
There was a nice bit of irony when Lorenzo, who hired thousands of new 
employees to replace strikers, was finally himself replaced as Eastern's 
chairman on April 19 by Lifland. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, Lifland's rulings in Eastern's bankruptcy case had consistently 
helped Lorenzo hang on as chairman despite whopping losses of $1.2 billion 
suffered just since the carrier filed for bankruptcy protection a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Equally surprising was Lifland's choice of Martin Shugrue as trustee to run 
Eastern. Only last year, Shugrue, who believes in a cooperative approach to 
labor relations, was unceremoniously dumped by Lorenzo as president of 
Continental Airlines, which, like Eastern, is owned by Lorenzo's Texas Air. 
</P>
<P>
Now, intriguing private talks have started that might give the strikers and 
their allies more than a Pyrrhic victory. There is an outside chance that the 
behind-the-scenes maneuvers will restore many of their jobs even though Lorenzo 
"permanently replaced" them with strikebreakers. 
</P>
<P>
One possibility being explored is to keep Eastern flying as an independent 
airline through a buyout made by a combination of employees and one or more 
outside investors who have indicated renewed interest in the idea since the 
court action. 
</P>
<P>
A key ingredient in that approach involves new union contracts that Shugrue 
says he wants to negotiate. Contract negotiations between the unions and 
Shugrue are beginning this week, and everyone involved in those talks insists 
that they want agreements based on compromises Lorenzo refused to make. 
</P>
<P>
An alternative once again being actively explored is an Eastern merger with 
another carrier, perhaps Northwest Airlines, which would hire many of Eastern's 
displaced union employees -- not the strikebreakers -- to operate Eastern's 
part of the merged company. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo's ouster at Eastern could be the least of his troubles. At risk is his 
entire airline empire because his Texas Air, the parent company, may be forced 
to assume financial responsibility for losses suffered by Eastern under his 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, Eastern's creditors, its unions and Shugrue himself may take 
court action to try to make Texas Air pay up to $400 million that the 
bankruptcy examiner said Lorenzo may have illegally siphoned from Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the court's ax fell on Lorenzo, David Shapiro, the examiner, 
concluded that the airline executive might justifiably be charged with looting 
Eastern of both money and assets. 
</P>
<P>
Such a loss could be a major blow to Lorenzo because it could force his already 
ailing Texas Air into bankruptcy if it had to repay Eastern for losses suffered 
by the alleged looting. 
</P>
<P>
And then there is the giant problem of Eastern's pension plan that has more 
than $1 billion in unfunded liabilities that are guaranteed by Texas Air. If 
Eastern goes under, the federal Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp. says it will go 
after Texas Air to make the costly guarantee good. 
</P>
<P>
For Lorenzo, the troubles stemming from the battle he started with Eastern's 
workers are far from over. But neither will the workers have an easy time 
regaining what they have lost. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, to negotiate new contracts with Shugrue, they must find a way to 
deal with Lorenzo's strikebreakers. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, worried that Shugrue might negotiate a new contract with the Air 
Line Pilots Assn., a group of strikebreaking pilots have formed the Eastern 
Pilots Assn. as an instrument to eliminate ALPA, which has represented the 
company's pilots for more than 45 years. 
</P>
<P>
That battle between pilots could last for months, and even if the pilots who 
went on strike win, the fight won't help restore much needed public confidence 
in Eastern's reliability. 
</P>
<P>
The International Assn. of Machinists, the only union still officially on 
strike, will also have problems with strikebreakers, but its leaders believe 
that they can get a contract agreement with Shugrue. 
</P>
<P>
The courts have held that workers, although free to strike, can be permanently 
replaced -- as though the difference between being fired or being permanently 
replaced has any meaning to workers who are put out of their jobs because they 
exercised their right to strike. 
</P>
<P>
If Eastern's corporate structure problems can be resolved, and ways found to 
undo the mischief done when Lorenzo hired those "permanent replacements," 
Eastern's workers may win their battle with Lorenzo, who epitomizes the 
destructive confrontational approach to labor-management relations.

Prices of gold futures fell moderately on New York's Commodity Exchange, 
extending a slide spurred by rising interest rates on the government bonds that 
compete with stocks, precious metals and other investments. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, grains, soybeans, oil futures, livestock and meat 
futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures settled $2.60 to $2.70 lower, with the contract for delivery in 
May at $368.40 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Silver futures were 1.5 cents higher across the board, with May at $4.932 an 
ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices have fallen about $30 an ounce since mid-March, including a drop of 
more than $10 in the past week, as interest rates on 30-year U.S. Treasury 
bonds have climbed above 9% to their highest levels in nearly a year.

Bond prices were mostly higher in light trading after Federal Reserve Board 
Chairman Alan Greenspan made remarks that the market interpreted to mean the 
Fed won't raise interest rates soon. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 9/32 point, or about $2.81 per 
$1,000 face amount, as its yield fell to 8.99% from 9.02% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan, speaking to the National Assn. of Purchasing Management convention 
in New Orleans, said he believes that there will be "somewhere between modest 
and moderate growth in factory output over the coming year." 
</P>
<P>
Traders and economists interpreted the remark to mean that the Fed won't see 
the need soon to nudge interest rates higher to stem inflation. Higher market 
rates hurt the value of fixed-return investments such as bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.188%, unchanged from Friday.

The dollar ended mixed against key foreign currencies in thin, abbreviated 
worldwide trading. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said trading was quiet, with Japanese markets closed for a 
national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Many European markets will be closed today for May Day, and some dealers took 
an early, extended break, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the various holidays this week there doesn't seem to be any reason to 
break from the trading ranges," said Trevor Woodland, chief corporate trader 
for Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago. "Everybody is in a bit of a wait-and-see 
mood." 
</P>
<P>
Overseas, traders are expected to pay close attention to the local government 
elections in Britain as a test of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's 
controversial reform of local taxes. The elections could effect the British 
pound. 
</P>
<P>
In West Germany, Bundesbank officials are set to meet this week, although 
traders said it was unlikely they'll move to raise interest rates in that 
country. Higher rates tend to support a currency. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the dollar fell to a closing 158.85 Japanese yen from 159.08 yen at 
Friday's close in Tokyo. The dollar stood at 158.90 yen in New York, down from 
159.30 yen Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was also weaker against the British pound. Sterling sold for $1.6390 
in London, up from $1.6360 late Friday, and for $1.6405 in New York, up from 
$1.6350.

TECHNOLOGY: THE $2.5-MILLION DEAL MARKS THE FIRST SIGNIFICANT CORPORATE

Steven Jobs, the personal computer pioneer struggling to hit it big a second 
time, has landed his first major corporate deal, selling 250 of his Next 
workstations to the William Morris talent agency in Beverly Hills and New York. 
</P>
<P>
Although the $2.5-million deal isn't large by the standards of corporate 
America, it does represent an achievement that has proven elusive for the 
computer industry's most celebrated marketing whiz: acceptance of his latest 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
Jobs, co-founder of Apple Computer, introduced the Next computer in October, 
1988, amid great hoopla and claims that it would soon be a major player in the 
market for powerful desktop computers. However, Next, the small Silicon Valley 
company that Jobs founded in 1985, took longer than expected to release its 
first working models, and software publishers have been slow to introduce 
programs that work on the computer. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Jobs signed a marketing deal with Businessland, the nation's 
largest computer retail chain, that insiders predicted would result in the sale 
of $100 million of the machines by the end of this year. But so far, sources 
say, Next has sold a few stations to universities and corporations for 
evaluation but has not won large companywide installation contracts. 
</P>
<P>
The William Morris deal changes that. According to sources at Next and the 
talent agency, William Morris has installed 78 of the $10,000 machines in its 
Beverly Hills and New York offices and will connect the remainder by year-end. 
The systems, which will be connected to a telecommunications network, are 
designed to allow the agents to instantaneously check on the availability of 
actors, directors and others in the entertainment business and improve the 
agency's deal-making capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
"The deal makers have never relied on this type of technology before," said a 
company spokesman. "The agents had nothing before except telephones." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Next said the talent agents will use specially designed 
software that will ultimately allow them to store and view videos of the 
entertainers they are tracking.

BOEING PROFIT SOARS 87% IN FIRST QUARTER

Boeing Co., which is selling more planes and making more on them, said Monday 
that its sales jumped 60% and its profit 87% in the first quarter of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials said demand should remain high for Boeing's jetliners and 
hinted strongly that they would go ahead with their planned new jet, the 777. 
But they warned shareholders at their annual meeting to expect another losing 
year for Boeing's troubled defense and space segments. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing announced a 3-for-2 stock split, the second year in a row it has done 
so. 
</P>
<P>
Shareholders gave directors permission to issue more stock but rejected a 
request that Boeing stop doing business with South Africa, despite efforts by a 
Baptist minister who camped in a plywood shack in front of company headquarters 
for three days and urged holders to "do the right thing." They also turned down 
three "shareholders' rights" resolutions, including a call for a shareholder 
vote on the company's "poison pill" plan. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing earned $302 million on sales of $6.4 billion for the first three months 
of 1990, compared to profit of $161 million on sales of $4 billion ago. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 figures are before a restatement to reflect a change in accounting for 
income taxes. Without restatement, the earnings would be $459 million. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing was left with a number of nearly complete planes when production was 
virtually stopped by a 48-day machinists union strike last fall. As a result, 
it was able to deliver 84 jets in the first quarter, compared to 67 in the 
first quarter of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Shrontz, chairman and chief executive, said the higher profits resulted 
from increased sales and improved operating margins on commercial jets. Higher 
federal taxes and losses in other segments of the company partially offset that 
performance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Boeing's military and space divisions lost $474 million. Boeing has 
bid aggressively on defense and space contracts in recent years and fallen 
behind on several programs. At the beginning of the year, it consolidated its 
military work into Boeing Defense and Space Group to try to make the segments 
more efficient.

Unocal Corp.: The Los Angeles-based oil company reported a first-quarter profit 
of $77 million, down 11% from the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue rose slightly to $2.6 billion. The year-ago results included a 
$46-million gain after taxes from various natural gas contract settlements. The 
company said the current results reflected higher worldwide crude oil prices 
and lower interest expenses, which were partially offset by lower chemical 
earnings.

rose 10% to $181.9 million, as revenue jumped 24% to $3.7 billion. The company 
said gains were fueled by strong volume growth in every business as well as by 
significant margin improvements in domestic soft drinks and worldwide

A WILDE GEM IN ABLE HANDS

<P>
A respected politician who began an otherwise honorable career by cashing in on 
an insider trading scam is about to be found out. An unscrupulous woman tries 
to use this information to blackmail him into falsifying a report before the 
government. A career, a marriage and the possible public financing of a canal 
that should never be built all hang in the balance. 
</P>
<P>
What makes "An Ideal Husband" so remarkable is that Oscar Wilde was writing 
about the turn of the last century, not this one, in this rarely seen show, now 
in a sparkling gem of a production at Lamb's Players Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Under the crisp and sensitive direction of Kerry Cederberg Meads, the very 
talented Lamb's Theatre ensemble quickly shows us that, although the men may be 
wearing proper British topcoats and the women flashing parasols, the flawed and 
yearning hearts that beat beneath the finery are very much like our own. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, the play is emblematic of everything that Lamb's does best: tightknit 
ensemble work by a core resident cast and a musical ability to provide riffs on 
a theme that pursues ethical questions -- all without a trace of 
heavy-handedness. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the most fascinating of the characters, the conniving blackmailer, Lady 
Cheveley, is brilliantly played by Deborah Gilmour Smyth to show the human side 
of this monster. It is not just her greed but her jealousy of her former 
goody-goody schoolmate, Gertrude, that inspires her plan. Gertrude is married 
to Robert Chiltern, Gertrude's match in morality -- except, of course, for that 
insider trading scam that Gertrude does not happen to know about until Lady 
Cheveley has the pleasure of throwing it in her face. 
</P>
<P>
Even as Smyth oils her way across the floor, coquettishly looking up from 
lowered eyelids, smiling her enigmatically knowing Mona Lisa smiles, weaving 
conversational webs like a veritable spider that her prey sticks to like so 
many helpless flies, she has her points of vulnerability. She nearly breaks 
down when she is repulsed by the man she wants; one believes her when she says, 
from her perspective, that all these maneuverings are a business deal to her, 
nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Lady Cheveley and Robert Chiltern had the same mentor, a Baron 
who taught Chiltern to subscribe to what Chiltern calls "the philosophy of 
power, the gospel of gold." Now, although Lady Cheveley still believes, 
Chiltern has internalized his wife's uncompromisingly moral philosophy. His 
dilemma comes when he has to decide whether to sell out to the blackmail and 
support the building of a canal he knows is wrong to save himself, or whether 
to risk ruin by sticking to what he believes is right. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Buckley's elegant, spare sets, nicely complemented by Alan Will's 
lighting, are much assisted by a clever routine in which two servants (Smith 
and Sonja Anderson) do the tidying up, with one hurrying along the other, who 
has a weakness for gazing at herself in the mirror. 
</P>
<P>
Jeanne Reith's costumes are a pleasure of billowing fabric, feathers and lace, 
and the uncredited sound design captures the elegance of the mood. 
</P>
<P>
But the star of the piece is the genius of Wilde; aside from the famous wit ("I 
love to talk about nothing; it's the only thing I know anything about"), one 
hears lines of depth that predate masterpieces by later writers. When Wilde 
equates "the horror" with Gertrude Chiltern's fervent but mistaken belief in 
her husband's innocence ("I was sure of it. I was sure," she says), one hears a 
foreshadowing of the words Joseph Conrad would use in writing about the fiancee 
who lied to herself about her betrothed in "The Heart of Darkness." 
</P>
<P>
When the impassioned Robert Chiltern, defending himself before his outraged 
wife, argues that it is not the perfect people in this world who need love, but 
the imperfect, one can anticipate the impassioned speech Lorraine Hansberry was 
to write for Mama in "A Raisin in the Sun," when she argues that people are 
deserving of love when they are fallen and need it the most. 
</P>
<P>
If "An Ideal Husband" does have a fault, it ties up the ends too neatly, much 
unlike the way most situations resolve. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not a lot has changed. The insider scandals continue. Prejudice 
continues. We continue to worship power and money and expect an unrealistic 
perfection of those who have acquired this power and money. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps we are more ready to hear Wilde's pleas for love and charity than 
the society in his time was. 
</P>
<P>
It certainly is difficult to resist his arguments in this irresistible play. 
</P>
<P>

BALLET REVIEW;

BOURNONVILLE BY THE BAY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When is a new production not a new production? The current version of "La 
Sylphide" by the San Francisco Ballet, billed as a premiere, raises the 
question. 
</P>
<P>
The work itself is, of course, just about as old as romantic story-ballets can 
be. It dates back to 1836, and documents the emergence of the ballerina as an 
other-worldly spirit who wears a long tutu and dances blithely on her 
tippy-toes. "La Sylphide" represents the touchstone of the grand yet dainty 
Bournonville tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Helgi Tomasson, who directed the latest local incarnation of the ballet, 
understands that tradition. He is, in fact, a product of it. 
</P>
<P>
The same could be said, however, for Peter Martins, Tomasson's fellow-danseur 
in the good old days at the New York City Ballet, who staged the previous 
production in San Francisco. Unless memory disserves, that "Sylphide" wasn't 
much different from this one. 
</P>
<P>
The Martins edition utilized flimsy but conventional sets and costumes borrowed 
from Pennsylvania. The Tomasson edition relies on dull decors by Jose Varona 
originally shared with the Dallas Ballet (now defunct) and unveiled during a 
San Francisco Ballet season in Honolulu three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
For some reason, Varona's old-fashioned, cheap-looking, eminently functional 
canvases had not adorned the stage of the War Memorial Opera House until this 
season. That at least makes them unfamiliar. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the shaky fireplace, wrinkled stone-wall flats and quaint leafy drops 
don't even look unfamiliar. They just look dowdy. Nevertheless, a pair of 
magnetic dancers in the central roles could make that irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
The pair mustered on Sunday afternoon exerted more promise than magnetism. 
</P>
<P>
Muriel Maffre, who joined the company this season, is a French would-be 
ballerina who comes to San Francisco with experience at the Hamburg Ballet, the 
Zaragoza Ballet and the Ballets de Monte Carlo. There doesn't seem to be any 
Bournonville in her past. 
</P>
<P>
At this juncture, she offers a lovely sketch of the ethereal, playful, 
terminally fragile sylph. The outlines are clear, the steps carefully 
modulated, the charms dutifully and obviously delineated. 
</P>
<P>
She gives a delicate, informed, somewhat cautious performance. With time and 
proper guidance, it could evolve into something both airy and poignant. 
</P>
<P>
Ashley Wheater -- her unusually husky, genuinely Scottish James -- used to be a 
fixture with the Joffrey Ballet. He is strong and reasonably ardent. Apart from 
some placement problems, he cuts a dashing figure as the confused, easily duped 
hero. Having danced the Schaufuss edition of this ballet, he has mastered the 
quick bravura style with authority, if without maximum lightness and ease. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, he tends to be correct in the role. Someday, given a chance to 
develop with the right stimulation, he might actually be interesting. 
</P>
<P>
Val Caniparoli mimes Madge, the evil witch, deftly, though he relies more than 
is necessary on eye-rolling, lip-smacking, hip-swiveling cliches. Antonio 
Castilla, on the other hand, is allowed to ignore lazy tradition and play Gurn 
as a sweet, impetuous, misunderstood kid. That almost lends credence to the 
instant amorous conversion of Linda Montaner, the cuddly Effie. 
</P>
<P>
Tomasson's good historical instincts bring unexpected focus to the mock-folk 
dances in Act I. His sense of style is even more valuable in the strikingly 
ethereal yet ever-precise maneuvers of the secondary sylphides in Act II. He 
really makes those ancient lithograph images come to life. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco Ballet orchestra, normally one of the best in a notoriously 
bad business, played the pretty Lovenskjold score rather untidily for Jean 
Louis LeRoux. Pit standards had been considerably higher during the 
curtain-raiser, however, when Denis de Coteau conducted a brilliant performance 
of Benjamin Britten's Sinfonia da Requiem, the musical inspiration for Jiri 
Kylian's "Forgotten Land" (1981). 
</P>
<P>
The seams of Kylian's musically sensitive, mechanically overwrought 
choreography show more and more with repetition. Still, this equally ragged and 
rugged ballet retains much its fierce dramatic appeal over the years. 
</P>
<P>
The San Franciscans -- led by Evelyn Cisneros and Lawrence Pech, Jo Ellen Arntz 
and Andre Reyes, Wendy Van Dyck and Anthony Randazzo -- danced on this occasion 
with feverish emotion muted by stylized motion. The tension was terrific.

"FOUNTAIN"(U.S.S.R.; Director: Yuri Mamin. Cineplex Odeon Fairfax, 9:15 p.m.). 
Wildly satiric, no-holds-barred, post-perestroika comedy: a Kazakstanian 
peasant grandfather, put in charge of a Moscow apartment house water pipe room, 
pulls the whole house into chaos -- with a little help from bureaucracy, 
inefficiency and social malaise. All are amply ridiculed. (Michael Wilmington) 
</P>
<P>
"AMERICAN STORIES"(U.S.; D: Chantal Akerman. Cineplex Century Plaza 2, 9:15 
p.m.) Bizarre Jewish-American vaudeville from the Belgian art film director of 
"Toute Une Nuite" -- which, formally, this film resembles. A series of 
sketches, mostly taken from old ethnic jokes, are done black-out style against 
outdoor New York City backgrounds. Strange, sometimes stiff, intermittently 
touching. (Michael Wilmington) 
</P>
<P>
"CIRCUS BOYS"(Japan; D: Kaizo Hayashi. Century Plaza 2, 7 p.m.) Beautiful 
black-and-white images, charmingly archaic, adorn this archetypal fable of two 
boys, good and bad, whose paths cross and diverge in the circus. (Michael 
Wilmington)

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: UCLA FILM ARCHIVES OFFERS GLIMPSE OF COLOMBIAN CINEMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Colombian Film Today: From Magic to Realism," composed of a dozen films that 
the UCLA Film Archive is presenting in Melnitz Theater today through May 15, 
introduces a national cinema all but unknown in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
By chance, the three films available for preview focus on men who may not be 
what they seem. The first of the three to screen (on Tuesday), Mario Ribero's 
"Ambassador From India" (1986), is an amusing, lighthearted comedy loosely 
inspired by Gogol's "Inspector General." Hugo Gomez stars as an amiable 
ne'er-do-well who passes himself off as none other than India's ambassador to 
Colombia traveling incognito. Arriving by bus at a small Colombian town, Gomez 
finds himself treated with such pomp and ceremony that even the British royals 
or Donald Trump would find it excessive. Indeed, Gomez, who is a sly comedian, 
finds himself caught up in a nonstop succession of entertainments as tedious 
and pretentious as those Imelda Marcos used to stage. As funny and likable as 
"Ambassador From India" is, it is somewhat meandering, and its satire is broad 
and affectionate rather than sharp and reflective. 
</P>
<P>
You may at first feel that Francisco Norden's relentlessly somber 1984 "A Man 
of Principle" (Saturday) requires considerable familiarity with Colombian 
political history. While that certainly wouldn't hurt, the film soon becomes a 
clear-cut study of a rigid family man (Frank Ramirez) who, while struggling to 
keep his position on the lower rungs of the middle-class, emerges as an 
iron-willed political terrorist. The film, set in the late '40s, is doggedly 
austere and tedious. 
</P>
<P>
Genuinely unpredictable, Pepe Sanchez's seemingly artless 1985 "Little San 
Antonio" (Sunday) is set at the turn-of-the-century. A handsome, impoverished 
country youth (Carlos Jaramillo) charms a succession of women, first in his 
home village and later in town, into backing his education at a seminary, where 
he is to study for the priesthood. Sanchez evokes with both humor and 
compassion a time when ladies of refinement but straitened circumstances had 
little recourse but to take in boarders and spend their days in tedious daily 
religious rituals and considerable indolence -- a perfect atmosphere for the 
repression of sexuality. Never mind that "Little San Antonio" is marred by a 
truly terrible jangly score -- it is the rare film in which a protracted 
buildup ends with a dynamite payoff. 
</P>
<P>
For show times and full schedule: (213) 206-FILM, (213) 206-8013. 
</P>
<P>
A fresh print of Stanley Donen's glorious 1957 "Funny Face" closes AFI Film 
Fest Thursday and then opens a one-week revival at the AMC Century 14. Fred 
Astaire stars as a Richard Avedon-ish fashion photographer and Audrey Hepburn 
is a mousy Greenwich Village bluestocking transformed into a radiant model. 
Featuring Gershwin standards, "Funny Face" is even more enjoyable than when it 
was new; they don't make witty, high-style sophisticated romantic musicals like 
this anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Norma Shearer retrospective gets underway at LACMA Friday at 1 
p.m. and again at 8 p.m. with "Marie Antoinette" (1938), a landmark costume 
pictures in which Shearer nevertheless gives a remarkably shaded portrayal of a 
frustrated, frivolous but finally gallant and brave queen.

Principals Have a Cow Over Bart: Spiky-headed cartoon antihero Bart Simpson has 
been kicked out of two schools in different parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
The principals of Cambridge Elementary School in Orange and Lutz Elementary 
School in Fremont, Ohio have discouraged students from wearing T-shirts bearing 
the likeness of the bug-eyed 10-year-old star of "The Simpsons." At issue is a 
shirt that boasts, "Under-achiever and proud of it, man." The principals say 
Bart teaches kids the wrong lesson, and that the Simpsons are not an 
appropriate family model for youngsters. GREG BRAXTON

Stolen Violins Recovered: San Francisco police recovered a Stradivarius and 
another violin, with a total value of more than $2 million, that were snatched 
in a daring burglary at the home of former Soviet ballerina Natalia Makarova. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Edward Karkar, said the thief "obviously" was not aware of the 
violins' value. Police arrested Robert Fisher, 27, of San Francisco, in 
connection with the robbery. Makarova recently retired from the American Ballet 
Theatre. GREG BRAXTON

A Taxing Auction for Redd Foxx: The Internal Revenue Service says it plans to 
auction off four cars and a motor scooter owned by entertainer Redd Foxx to 
help pay off his tax debt. The cars to be sold at the May 11 public auction 
include a 1927 Model T, a 1975 Panther, a 1983 Zimmer and a 1978 Jeep Cherokee. 
The IRS says Foxx owes $755,166 in back taxes for 1983, 1984 and 1986. GREG

'BREWSTER PLACE': OVERCOOKED PRIME-TIME MELODRAMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABC continues its streak of boldness. Its "Brewster Place," premiering at 9:30 
tonight on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42, is a rare prime-time dramatic series about 
blacks. 
</P>
<P>
If only this weekly half hour were better. 
</P>
<P>
Reprising her role as suffering Mattie Michael from last year's popular 
miniseries "The Women of Brewster Place," Oprah Winfrey is again a fountain of 
virtue in her eclectic black Chicago neighborhood. Too much virtue. Mattie is 
such an icon of goodness -- and this series so determined to be uplifting and 
inspirational -- that you can hardly stand it. 
</P>
<P>
It's 1967, and after losing her beautician's job for criticizing her employer's 
business ethics, Mattie is urged by her best friend Etta Mae (Brenda Pressley) 
to join her in buying a neighborhood restaurant. Distrustful of all 
relationships after having her heart broken by her no-good son, Mattie has to 
be convinced by Etta Mae to take a chance: "A broken heart doesn't have to be a 
cold heart." 
</P>
<P>
After this overcooked melodramatic sequence, they buy the restaurant, setting 
up next Tuesday's second episode when Mattie and Etta Mae suffer -- and 
overcome -- one disaster after another: A load of meat is too big for the 
freezer, which breaks down. A cash register malfunctions. A know-it-all white 
cook (John Speredakos) won't shut up. A mean-spirited busybody (Olivia Cole, 
held over from the miniseries) won't stop snickering. Customers demand their 
food. 
</P>
<P>
Just why the health department doesn't close this place down after the first 
day is a mystery. Not to worry, though, for all ends tidily and happily. 
</P>
<P>
"Brewster Place" moves into its regular 9:30 p.m. Wednesday time slot May 9, 
supplanting that infinitely more engaging comedy "The Marshall Chronicles." 
</P>
<P>
Winfrey, who is co-executive producer, displays some of the appealing humanity 
that also characterizes her work on her syndicated talk show. And Pressley 
provides occasional humor and Cole a refreshing spark of nastiness. But 
"Brewster Place" is so saccharine and enervating and Mattie so sorrowful and 
subdued that you feel weary just watching. Not too weary to change channels, 
however. HOWARD ROSENBERG

'FRONTLINE' UNRAVELS LINCOLN SAVINGS COLLAPSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA FRITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Frontline's" account tonight of the misadventures of Charles H. Keating Jr. 
and Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan provides some interesting new details and an 
excellent summary of a complex case of financial fraud and mismanagement that 
likely will cost the American taxpayers $2.5 billion. (It airs at 9 p.m. on 
Channels 28 and 15, at 10 p.m. on Channel 50.) 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine-based savings and loan, purchased by Keating in the heyday of 
deregulation in 1984, was seized by the government in April, 1989. It is 
expected to be the most expensive thrift collapse in the nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
Drawing on federally insured money from Lincoln, Keating accomplished a great 
deal during the five years he owned the thrift. He developed the $300-million 
Phoenician resort and other properties, paid many of his relatives salaries of 
$1 million a year or more, and spent $3 million to buy influence with 
politicians in Washington, Arizona and California -- influence he later used to 
keep regulators at bay. 
</P>
<P>
"Frontline" sheds new light on how about 23,000 investors -- mostly elderly -- 
who put their life savings in now-worthless bonds issued by Lincoln's parent 
company, American Continental Corp., lost their life savings. An internal memo 
obtained by "Frontline" advised bond salesmen to prevent potential buyers from 
seeing the prospectus, which would have informed them the bonds were not 
federally insured. "The weak, meek and ignorant are always good targets," the 
memo said. 
</P>
<P>
A highlight of the show comes in an interview with M. Danny Wall, former 
chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, who has been accused of dragging 
his feet after investigators recommended seizure of Lincoln as early as 1987. 
Wall staunchly defends Lincoln's $100-million investments in junk bonds 
arranged by confessed insider-trader Ivan Boesky. 
</P>
<P>
"A hundred-million dollar investment in junk bonds with the pejorative added of 
Ivan Boesky today means something," Wall says. "Then, it didn't. Ivan Boesky 
hadn't been accused of anything at that point in the process, as I recall, in 
1986, 1987." 
</P>
<P>
When the narrator reminds him that Boesky plead guilty to securities violations 
in the fall of 1986, Wall looks shocked. "I could be wrong; I could be wrong," 
he admits. SARA FRITZ

ELECTIONS IN BRITAIN

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Britain's hard-pressed Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is likely to hear more 
bad news from the voters Thursday as her countrymen elect 1,914 local council 
members. 
</P>
<P>
The latest polls indicate that her ruling Conservative Party will loose scores 
of seats to the arch-rival Labor Party, which traditionally does better locally 
than in general elections. 
</P>
<P>
An unpopular local taxation scheme imposed by Thatcher's government is the key 
issue behind Labor's 26% lead in recent surveys. If the polls are right, 
Thursday's vote will increase the possibility of a leadership challenge within 
the Conservative Party.

FOR THE MIDDLE EAST, ARMS CONTROL IS NO LONGER UNTHINKABLE; 
</P>
<P>
POISON GAS, BALLISTIC MISSILES AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS HAVE RAISED THE STAKES TO 
UNPRECEDENTED HEIGHTS. THIS BALANCE OF TERROR MAY ONE DAY PUSH OLD ENEMIES INTO 
A NEW WILLINGNESS TO TALK.

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Around a green baize table somewhere in neutral Europe huddle a dozen of the 
Middle East's most implacable enemies. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting rigidly in his uniform is Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Across the 
way, a seemingly perpetual scowl on his face, is Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Shamir. Syrian President Hafez Assad glances suspiciously from one dangerous 
adversary to the other. Both Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani and Libyan 
leader Moammar Kadafi stand out in their long, flowing robes and distinctive 
headgear. 
</P>
<P>
This most extraordinary collection of Middle East leaders has gathered to talk 
about destroying their nuclear bombs, poison gas and ballistic missiles. Given 
the balance of terror that has evolved in the region, they see little choice. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Such a meeting would have been totally unthinkable a few years ago, and it is 
still decidedly a long shot in a region scarred by generations of conflict, 
hatred and suspicion. But for the first time ever, the prospect of Middle East 
arms control is being seriously discussed from Baghdad to Tel Aviv to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The message came recently from a most unlikely figure: Iraq's usually 
belligerent President Hussein. Almost overlooked in the bluster of his threat 
to destroy "half of Israel" with chemical weapons was a suggestion by Hussein 
last month that the bitterly antagonistic nations of the Middle East should 
begin negotiations to rid the region of weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
"Arms control is an idea whose time clearly has come," a State Department 
official said recently. "Everyone is aware of the missile proliferation and the 
chemical warfare proliferation. People are ready to grapple with the issue. If 
it wasn't difficult, it wouldn't be an issue." 
</P>
<P>
In an area racked by warfare for thousands of years, technology has run amok. 
The weapons available to the region's disputatious leaders have become far more 
deadly than they used to be. The spread of ballistic missiles capable of 
sending nuclear or chemical warheads to almost any target in the compact region 
has reduced warning times and increased the danger of war by accident. 
</P>
<P>
"The offense is getting ahead of the defense," said Samuel W. Lewis, former 
U.S. ambassador to Israel and now president of the U.S. Institute of Peace. 
"When you have some days of warning time to watch the enemy's buildup and to 
consult coolly about the risks, the situation is different from the one where, 
without any obvious preparation, someone can just launch a battery of missiles. 
</P>
<P>
"This means there is a greater temptation to launch a preemptive strike," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Israel, Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iran all have arsenals of ballistic 
missiles. Israel is known to have both nuclear and chemical weapons. Iraq has 
chemical weapons and could have nuclear weapons within a decade. Syria has long 
possessed poison gas. Egypt is believed to have revived a long-dormant chemical 
weapons program. Iran has at least the potential for producing chemical 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Libya, where the mercurial Kadafi adds an element of instability, 
has built a poison gas plant and may be producing deadly chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
The arms race is both dangerous and expensive. It was just such a combination 
of terror and cost that drove the United States and the Soviet Union to the 
arms control table 20 years ago. But the situation is far more complex in the 
Middle East, where hatreds are deeper and tempers are shorter. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Washington-Moscow confrontation, the Middle East does not divide 
easily into two competing camps that have to deal only with each other. Israel 
and Iraq are bitter enemies, with the most potent military forces. But they 
would never reduce their weaponry without complementary steps by other 
antagonists in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Both Israel and Iraq have such bad relations with Syria, for example, that the 
possibility of armed confrontation with that country is always present. Also, 
Iraq and non-Arab Iran remain mortal enemies despite the uneasy 1988 cease-fire 
in their eight-year war. Israel's relations with Jordan, while currently 
stable, could erupt into conflict at any time. And Kadafi adds a dangerous 
joker to the pack. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, if Israel and Iraq agreed to arms control talks, the rest of the 
region would probably go along -- at least as far as the negotiating table. 
And, right now, those two nations may have the most to gain, both militarily 
and politically, from such a conference. 
</P>
<P>
"Israel and Iraq, the two most technologically advanced powers, have become 
fearful of each other's potential," said Geoffrey Kemp, a White House expert on 
the Middle East during the Reagan Administration who is now a senior associate 
of the Carnegie Foundation for International Peace in Washington. "This 
coincidence of fears in Israel and Iraq leads to a dangerous situation. The 
risk of confrontation by miscalculation cannot be ruled out." 
</P>
<P>
Abdul Rahman M. Jamil, press counselor of the Iraqi Embassy in Washington, said 
Iraq developed its chemical arsenal to prevent Israel from repeating its 1981 
bombing raid on the Osirak nuclear facility near Baghdad, an attack that 
non-governmental experts now believe set back Iraq's nuclear weapons program by 
a decade or more. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he said, Iraq is prepared to use its chemical arsenal as a bargaining chip 
to trade for Israel's nuclear weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
"It's cheaper to go for peace than to spend billions of dollars on weapons," 
Jamil said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the Israeli government has shown no interest in such a bargain. But 
Israeli defense experts have begun serious discussions of arms control in 
recent months, reflecting a growing concern that the arms race has grown out of 
control. 
</P>
<P>
"The longer it takes, the more difficult it is going to be and the more danger 
(that) we have a catastrophe before then," said Gerald Steinberg, a defense 
analyst at Bar Ilan University in Tel Aviv. "So while arms control may seem 
like a very unlikely bet now, survival not just for the Middle East but for the 
rest of the world may be at stake." 
</P>
<P>
From Israel's standpoint, Steinberg said, arms control negotiations would have 
one major diplomatic benefit -- Arab governments would have to deal directly 
with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue of recognition, legitimization, acceptance for the Jewish people in 
the Jewish home, something that the Arab states have denied for over five 
decades, is going to be forced to the surface by the tremendous dangers of the 
spread of nuclear and chemical weapons and missiles," he said. "There is no way 
around it." 
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the only Arab government to extend diplomatic recognition to Israel. 
For years, a succession of Israeli governments have made it a prime objective 
to regularize relations with other Arab states. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, however, many Israelis have argued that Israel needs its nuclear 
umbrella to offset the numerical advantage of the Arab states. From Israel's 
point of view, the Iraqi plan, which has been endorsed by Egyptian President 
Hosni Mubarak, would be a step in the wrong direction because it would 
eliminate only nuclear and chemical weapons while leaving conventional armies 
untouched. 
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. experts maintain that despite the Arab advantage in population, 
Israel has a highly skilled military force that would be able to turn back any 
attack in the foreseeable future without having to resort to nuclear or 
chemical weapons. These experts say Iraq, too, has a strong conventional force 
that can meet its defense needs without missiles or poison gas. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the prospects of beginning negotiations over sophisticated 
weapons of mass destruction may depend on the outcome of attempts -- apparently 
deadlocked -- to make peace between Israel and the Palestinian residents of the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip, who are armed chiefly with rocks and gasoline-filled 
bottles. 
</P>
<P>
"A comprehensive ban on weapons of mass destruction will be very difficult to 
achieve in the absence of solutions to longstanding regional conflicts," the 
State Department said in a formal statement issued last week. "However, we 
believe it is important to pursue agreement on approaches to curbing weapons 
proliferation that could win support of all parties." 
</P>
<P>
That Middle East arms control is being seriously discussed at all is a symptom 
of the decline of U.S. and Soviet influence in the region and a dramatization 
of the failure of the superpowers' policy to stem the proliferation of modern 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier years, Washington and Moscow could control the flow of arms to the 
Middle East because the nations of the region relied on U.S. and Soviet 
weaponry. The nations still import a lot of arms, but some of them have 
developed domestic arms industries as well. 
</P>
<P>
"We have already reached the point where it is very hard to bring a country to 
its knees by an agreement between a few external suppliers to stop the flow of 
arms," said William B. Quandt, a National Security Council expert on the Middle 
East in the Carter Administration who is now a senior fellow of the Brookings 
Institution in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"Countries like Iran and Iraq, of necessity, learned how to do much more on 
their own," he said. "That is a lesson that hasn't been lost on the others. 
Unfortunately, chemical weapons are quite easy to produce domestically." 
</P>
<P>
Both Israel and Iraq have developed locally produced missiles. Israel has a 
domestic nuclear weapons program and Iraq is thought to be five to 10 years 
away from developing one. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter how stringent the export controls, Iraq will get the bomb," said 
Seth Carus, a fellow of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. "We may 
be able to slow them down a bit, but the Iraqi ability to penetrate Western 
technology is much greater than the West's ability to prevent it." 
</P>
<P>
As was the case in the early days of U.S.-Soviet negotiations, the arms control 
process is severely hampered by secrecy on all sides. Although Hussein has 
bragged of his chemical weapons and missile delivery systems, he has not 
revealed the size of his arsenals. Israel has confirmed its missile capability 
but has never admitted possessing either nuclear or chemical weapons. Syria and 
Egypt also refuse to talk about their non-conventional arsenals. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, while Western analysts have little doubt about the broad outlines 
of the Middle East arms race, they cannot agree on an exact count of weapons 
for any of the countries.

THE EAST IS NOT RED: FOR EUROPE, A NEW MAY DAY

<P>
Flower-festooned Maypoles have sprouted in the wake of Communist Party 
propaganda posters as East Europeans have traded in hollow testimonials to 
labor for traditional May Day celebrations of new life after the long, barren 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
It is a change heavy with symbolism for those recently rid of an ideology that 
never took root. 
</P>
<P>
Although May Day most recently has been identified with socialism, it began 100 
years ago -- decades before Soviet domination of Eastern Europe -- as a holiday 
honoring workers around the world and pressing for humane reforms such as an 
eight-hour workday. 
</P>
<P>
Today, East Europeans have swept aside even its noble aims for the worker, 
opting for picnics instead of parades and poetry in place of politics. 
</P>
<P>
For Hungarians, Czechoslovaks, Poles and East Germans, May Day has recovered 
its original innocence as a simple day off to welcome spring. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of people are fed up with empty, meaningless parades. They don't 
want to march and go to rallies; they want to relax and celebrate in their own 
way," explained Attila Balint, spokesman for Hungary's national Trade Union 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Breaking with political traditions of the past 45 years, Hungarians will 
celebrate their May Day labor centennial in much the same way Americans observe 
the first Monday in September -- as far from life's worries as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Floral garlands sway from lampposts, and folk bands are making plans to 
congregate at a park in the Buda Hills, where dancing around the Maypole began 
centuries before the followers of Karl Marx got their hands on the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
May Day was a time for rejoicing over the season of growth and renewal until 
1889, when the Second Socialist International, meeting in Paris, designated May 
1 as a day for labor marches and demonstrations. Most Central European nations 
followed suit a year later, and the folk rituals shared the stage with leftist 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary's official trade union group retains its ties with the Socialist Party, 
but workers this year have rejected any involvement of politicians in their 
holiday, Balint said. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to foster goodwill toward its role as champion of the worker, the 
trade federation plans to offer free beer at a garden tent in Pest, near the 
route where the Communist elite used to review the procession of slogan-touting 
marchers. 
</P>
<P>
As a political holiday in Hungary, the First of May has gone the way of April 
4, which until this year celebrated the arrival of Soviet troops to liberate 
Hungary from World War II fascism. Instead, the nation has adopted Oct. 23 as a 
national holiday, observing both the outbreak of the 1956 Hungarian uprising 
against communism and last year's founding of an independent Hungarian 
Republic. The nation also plans to restore Aug. 20 as St. Stephen's Day, after 
four decades of celebrating the socialist constitution instead of Hungary's 
patron saint. 
</P>
<P>
A similar turn away from socialist occasions has occurred in neighboring 
Czechoslovakia, where young people in Prague plan to gather on May Day at the 
statue of 19th-Century poet Karel Hynek Macha. 
</P>
<P>
Macha's ode to spring hailing "the First of May, a time for love" drew 
sweethearts to his memorial for recitation of sonnets before socialist 
occupiers sent in police to shoo away such frivolity. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrations in Czech and Slovak lands will have a decidely folkish focus, with 
dancing, singing and grilled sausages replacing long-winded speeches hailing 
devotion to labor. 
</P>
<P>
In Poland, where religious traditions withstood the strains of socialist 
suppression, May Day draws the faithful to church for prayers to St. Joseph, 
the patron saint of work. Bombastic politicking has even been abandoned by the 
surviving Communists. 
</P>
<P>
May Day in Poland's past was a time for courtship rituals and farming taboos, 
with the planting of potatoes and the setting of hens to lay eggs forbidden in 
fear of a tainted harvest. Poles began their rituals on the festival's eve by 
lighting bonfires on hilltops to chase away evil spirits. 
</P>
<P>
Legend had it that the Continent's witches gathered at Brocken Peak in 
Germany's Harz Mountains to cast spells on industrious farmers. 
</P>
<P>
The superstitious point out that May Day Eve traditions were overlooked by 
war-weary Europeans in the last days before vanquished Germans surrendered to 
Soviet troops in 1945, leaving their lands vulnerable to a political plague 
that endured 40 years.

MAKING MAPS FOR THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS MORE THAN JUST DRAWING PRETTY PICTURES. 
FEW THINGS ARE MORE SENSITIVE TO GOVERNMENTS THAN THEIR BORDERS -- ESPECIALLY 
WHEN THERE IS ROOM FOR ARGUMENT.

They have what sounds like a routine and tedious job. But the State 
Department's dozen or so geographers and map makers face an increasingly 
complex and sensitive task: keeping track of the boundaries between the world's 
172 nations. 
</P>
<P>
Boundary disputes reach from Argentina to Zaire -- at least one on every 
continent except Australia, which has the singular advantage of containing only 
one nation. 
</P>
<P>
It can take decades for countries to settle their territorial differences -- 
some disputes date back to the 19th Century. In the meantime, maps must be 
drawn, and an international incident could develop if the U.S. Embassy in a 
nation with a contested border should turn up with a map showing the wrong 
line. 
</P>
<P>
A look at Lithuania shows why the State Department is so meticulous in its 
attention to detail. Lithuania and its two Baltic neighbors, Latvia and 
Estonia, were annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 as part of Josef Stalin's 
secret agreement with Adolf Hitler, and the United States has never formally 
recognized the annexation. 
</P>
<P>
According to the State Department's "Guide to International Boundaries," map 
makers should show the borders of the three Baltic nations as they stood in 
1937, before the annexation. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the last 50 years, that instruction seemed a futile gesture toward 
a never-to-return past. But now, with Lithuania declaring its independence, the 
borders have become starkly relevant. 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, there are a few minor differences between the borders of those 
long-ago-independent states and the boundaries of the Soviet "republics" of the 
same names. The State Department formally insists that the discrepancies are 
inconsequential. When officials are asked about those borders, they say the 
matter is "very sensitive" and quickly change the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Managing such delicate situations falls to the State Department's little-known 
Office of the Geographer, which tries to keep the map makers out of trouble by 
providing detailed advice on how to apply the sometimes abstruse nuances of 
U.S. government policy. 
</P>
<P>
The geographer, William B. Wood, emphasized in a recent interview that he does 
not make policy himself. His job, he said, is to keep track of the geographic 
impact of policies made at the White House, the State Department and elsewhere 
in the government. 
</P>
<P>
Wood said his office tries not to take sides in boundary disputes. Instead, it 
accepts anything that is approved by both parties. 
</P>
<P>
But sometimes the parties never agree, and then the Guide to International 
Boundaries merely reflects the dispute. It also contains some very detailed 
instructions to cartographers responsible for making detailed maps of 
particular countries and regions. 
</P>
<P>
All maps of the western Soviet Union, the guide says, should carry this 
disclaimer: "The United States Government has not recognized the incorporation 
of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania into the Soviet Union." The instructions add: 
"The 1937 boundaries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania should be depicted where 
map scale permits." 
</P>
<P>
The rules are even more complex regarding China and Taiwan, the offshore island 
controlled by the Nationalist Chinese government, which still claims to be the 
rightful government of all China. The United States agreed in 1972 that Taiwan 
is part of China, a position accepted by both governments despite their dispute 
over which one should be in control. 
</P>
<P>
" 'China' should be used to label the mainland whenever the island of Taiwan is 
included on the map," the guide explains. "Mainland China and Taiwan should be 
the same color. 'Taiwan' should be in island type or another selected type 
style. 'Taiwan' and the first-order administrative division names on mainland 
China should never be in the same type style. Beijing should be shown as the 
national capital for China. Taipei should be symbolized only as a populated 
place." 
</P>
<P>
For about 40 years, U.S. government maps recorded a claim by Jordan to the West 
Bank territory that was administered by Jordan from 1948 to 1967, when Israel 
began occupying it after the 1967 Middle East War. In 1988, largely because of 
a seven-year campaign by Martin Miller, a retired Treasury Department 
bureaucrat and a staunch backer of Israel, the maps were changed to eliminate 
any reference to the Jordanian claim. 
</P>
<P>
The maps still do not show universally accepted borders for Israel, however. 
The guide advises: " 'Armistice Line' should be labeled for the Israeli borders 
where map scale permits. The 1950 Israeli proclamation that Jerusalem be the 
national capital is not recognized by the United States government. 'Israeli 
occupied, status to be determined' should be used when West Bank and Gaza Strip 
are labeled." 
</P>
<P>
The geographer's advice covers maps drawn only by the State Department, CIA, 
Pentagon and other government agencies. It has no impact on the National 
Geographic Society, which produces most of the maps found in homes and 
schoolrooms around the country. 
</P>
<P>
"The National Geographic tries to show who occupies an area," Wood said. "We 
try to use historical agreements." 
</P>
<P>
One such agreement, on the post-World War II boundaries of Europe, was reached 
in 1975 by the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, 
known as the Helsinki Conference. The Helsinki Final Act recognized all 
existing boundaries. But the United States refrained from approving one aspect 
-- the incorporation of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia into the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1975 in the Helsinki Final Act, we recognized the existing borders in 
Europe," said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher. "President (Gerald 
R.) Ford at the time made a specific exception for our non-recognition policy 
for the Baltic states."

CAPE TOWN, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On one side is President Frederik W. de Klerk and the seven most powerful men 
in South Africa, each of them white and each of them an Afrikaner. 
</P>
<P>
All but one were children when their fathers' generation forced apartheid onto 
South Africa, and they grew up in the cradle of white privilege. Now 
middle-aged lawyers, professors and businessmen, they say they want to break 
with the past and end apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, in a rainbow of colors, are 11 leaders of the enemy -- the 
African National Congress, the guerrilla movement that has waged war on 
Pretoria for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Older than De Klerk's men, most are in their 60s or 70s. They include a black 
economist, a white Afrikaner pastor, a mixed-race teacher and both black and 
white lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Five have spent half a lifetime in exile in Lusaka, Zambia, vilified by 
successive Pretoria governments as terrorists. Three have spent half their 
lives in prison here in this city. And three others have spent half their lives 
under police surveillance, banning orders and periodic detention inside their 
country. 
</P>
<P>
These two warring sides come together Wednesday on the tip of Africa, where the 
Afrikaner ancestors of De Klerk's delegation first settled among the indigenous 
tribes of Africa three centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
Their three days of historic talks, coming amid a whirlwind of change in South 
Africa, will be the first important test of the chances for peace. 
</P>
<P>
But even if the talks are successful -- and there is no guarantee of that -- 
they will mark only the beginning of a long, rocky journey to the negotiating 
table and, later, an even more jarring trip toward a new constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have at the moment is a compromise -- the ANC and the government are 
talking to each other about talking to each other," said Mark Phillips, a 
researcher at the Center for Policy Studies in Johannesburg. "But neither side 
has met the other's preconditions for talks." 
</P>
<P>
On the table in Cape Town will be the ANC's preconditions for negotiations. It 
wants the four-year-old state of emergency lifted, returning exiles indemnified 
from prosecution for past crimes and political prisoners freed from South 
Africa's jails. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be quite a difficult process to keep this thing on the rails," 
said Cheryl Carolus, a Cape Town anti-apartheid activist and one of the ANC 
delegates. "There need to be a lot more gestures on the state side." 
</P>
<P>
Also up for discussion is increasing violence in the country and the 
government's insistence that the ANC end its armed struggle. The ANC's 
guerrilla war has been dormant for months now, and Anglican Archbishop Desmond 
M. Tutu has publicly urged its demise. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC has refused, though, until the government agrees to a mutual 
cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
Most political analysts expect the government to meet some of the ANC's demands 
in the coming months, if not sooner. The state of emergency, key sections of 
which were abandoned by De Klerk in February, could be partially lifted, 
analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
And the government may be prepared to begin releasing political prisoners as 
well. In recent weeks a few prisoners have been freed early, and restrictions 
on those activists still in prison have been eased. 
</P>
<P>
Any progress will depend, though, on getting these two widely divergent groups 
of South Africans to see eye-to-eye. And that may hinge on personalities. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk and ANC Deputy President Nelson Mandela, the delegation leaders, have 
met three times and spoken of their mutual respect. While in prison, Mandela 
also met often with Gerrit Viljoen, a retired professor of classics who is 
minister of constitutional development, and Hendrick (Kobie) Coetzee, minister 
of justice. 
</P>
<P>
But this will be the government's first encounter with ANC exiles such as Thabo 
Mbeki, 47, the pipe-smoking head of international affairs. Mbeki, a first among 
equals in the ANC's exile headquarters, has charmed hundreds of white South 
African visitors to Lusaka with his relaxed, urbane demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
The most controversial members of the teams are likely to be Adriaan Vlok, the 
government minister of law and order, and Joe Modise, the commander of the 
ANC's military wing. The government's longstanding distaste for communism also 
may put it at odds with Joe Slovo, a white lawyer and former ANC military 
commander who is general secretary of the South African Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the delegations manage to get beyond their immediate differences, a 
host of other obstacles to a peaceful future in South Africa lurk just beyond 
the meeting room. Among them are: 
</P>
<P>
* The ANC wants a new constitution to be drawn up by a constituent assembly, 
elected in a one-person, one-vote election for all races. However, the 
government believes that the constitution can be drawn up by "recognized 
leaders" in South Africa without a vote. 
</P>
<P>
* Violence in the black townships, which the South African Institute of Race 
Relations says is running at the highest level in modern times. 
</P>
<P>
* Internecine warfare has been increasing in Natal province, where supporters 
of the ANC are fighting those aligned with Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha 
Buthelezi.Some anti-apartheid leaders had hoped that Mandela and Buthelezi, who 
represents about 2 million Zulus, could resolve their differences and present a 
united front in eventual talks with De Klerk. But Buthelezi seems destined to 
occupy his own seat in any negotiations with the government. 
</P>
<P>
* The role of the government's nominally independent black homelands. The 
rulers of two of the four homelands have been overthrown in recent weeks, and 
angry residents want their South African citizenship back. 
</P>
<P>
One of the larger issues is the future of apartheid. The government has 
promised to remove or amend most racially discriminatory laws, but dismantling 
the system will be a topic for negotiations. 
</P>
<P>

TWO BIOTECH FIRMS PLAN TO SELL SHARES TO PUBLIC 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two San Diego biotechnology companies, Gensia Pharmaceuticals and Mycogen, say 
they plan to to sell stock to the public, an indication that the stock market's 
perception of biotechnology issues may be improving. 
</P>
<P>
According to a registration statement filed with the federal Securities and 
Exchange Commission, Gensia Pharmaceuticals plans to sell 2.5 million shares in 
an initial public stock offering priced at $9 to $11 a share. The offering 
could raise up to $27.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company has also asked for the right to sell 375,000 additional shares if 
warranted by investor demand. All stock to be sold in the offering, which is 
scheduled to be completed in June, will be newly issued shares. 
</P>
<P>
Gensia Pharmaceuticals is developing a line of biochemicals called 
purine/pyrimidine compounds to treat and diagnose ischemic heart disease, a 
variety of ailments including angina that result from an insufficient supply of 
oxygen to the heart. 
</P>
<P>
The company now has a therapeutic drug and a diagnostic product in clinical 
trials, both of which could be on the market by 1994 if the tests are 
successful. Published reports have put the potential market for the two Gensia 
Pharmaceuticals products at $100 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1986, Gensia has attracted $41 million in venture capital, but has 
not generated revenue or turned a profit. Its largest shareholder is Marion 
Merrell Dow, which this year paid $15 million to buy 15.9% of Gensia stock. 
</P>
<P>
Other Gensia Pharmaceuticals shareholders include Domain Associates; Kleiner, 
Perkins, Caufield &amp; Byers, and Biotechnology Investments Ltd. of Great 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Mycogen, a San Diego manufacturer of biopesticides, announced Friday that it 
plans to offer 1.7 million shares to the public in a secondary stock offering. 
Assuming that the new shares sell at Mycogen's Monday closing price of $13.25, 
a 1.7-million share offering could raise $22.5 million. All the shares are 
being sold by the company. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Gensia, Mycogen is selling products, including a pesticide for the 
Colorado potato beetle, and is generating revenues. 
</P>
<P>
In its June, 1987, initial public stock offering, Mycogen raised $17 million by 
selling 1.6 million shares at $11 each. With the sale of the 1.7 million 
additional shares, Mycogen shares outstanding will total 10.4 million. The 
company's leading shareholders before the offering are Lubrizol Corp., with a 
16.7% stake, and Kubota Corp. of Japan, with a 13.7% stake.

ARE SAN DIEGANS TAKING A HOSING ON GAS PRICES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few years ago, highway travelers who journeyed between San Diego and Los 
Angeles could fuel up in either city and expect to pay about the same amount 
for a gallon of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
But today, drivers who frivolously fill up their tanks in San Diego should be 
prepared to dig deeper in their pockets: According to industry surveys, a 
gallon of regular unleaded costs 10 cents more on average in San Diego than it 
does in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, industry experts say, the price difference between San 
Diego and Los Angeles has expanded to 10 cents or more from a traditional gap 
of a couple of pennies. According to the most recent research by Lundberg 
Surveys, a North Hollywood-based market research firm, a gallon of regular 
unleaded costs an average $1.10 in San Diego and about $.99 in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Lundberg's recent survey of 51 major U. S. cities reveals that San 
Diego posts the third-highest price in the nation for a gallon of regular 
unleaded gasoline. Only two other cities -- Anchorage, Alaska, and Honolulu -- 
recorded higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's steep gas prices have left local drivers and politicians angry to 
the point that Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) has asked the Federal Trade 
Commission to investigate the reasons. Explanations offered so far include 
allegations of price fixing by the major oil companies, skyrocketing real 
estate costs and simple supply-and-demand market dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
"For some reason, San Diegans are getting a raw deal," Bates said. "If the 
Federal Trade Commission comes up with evidence showing fairly clearly that 
this is a case of price fixing, (the FTC) would turn (the evidence) over to the 
Justice Department for prosecution," Bates said. 
</P>
<P>
But the major oil companies that operate in San Diego County have denied any 
wrongdoing and say the prices are market-driven. 
</P>
<P>
Bates "is totally incorrect if he's suggesting that the oil companies are 
cooperating together," said Frank Suchwala, a pricing product supply specialist 
at Chevron, one of the county's major suppliers.

"Dealers establish their own street prices and they set prices which they 
believe the market will bear," Suchwala said. 
</P>
<P>
But dealers say the major oil companies are charging them higher prices and 
that they in turn must pass along the costs to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers "take a lot of flak (from drivers) who may have just come down from Los 
Angeles and purchased gas up there," said Steve Shelton, executive director of 
the Southern California Service Station Assn., a 1,280-member trade group 
composed primarily of individual operators who lease gas stations from the 
major oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
"They see the prices here, and the first thing they say is, 'What kind of 
rip-off artist are you?' " Shelton said. "It's a bum rap. Our guys are the 
victims. We're not the perpetrators." 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego has the highest wholesale prices in the United States, and that's 
what makes the retail prices higher," Shelton said. 
</P>
<P>
The wholesale prices of gasoline in San Diego seem particularly high when 
compared with nearby Southwestern U. S. cities -- such as Las Vegas and Phoenix 
-- which are supplied by the same Los Angeles-area refineries. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Lundberg Surveys, a comparison of wholesale prices for regular 
unleaded -- the most common grade, accounting for 50% of all gasoline sold -- 
reveals the following: Regular unleaded produced in Los Angeles sells in the 
home city at an average wholesale price of 71.51 cents per gallon. 
</P>
<P>
In Phoenix, where the gas must be transported 400 miles, the same gallon of gas 
sells for 73.32 cents per gallon. In Las Vegas, about 280 miles away from Los 
Angeles, a gallon sells for 68.73 cents. 
</P>
<P>
But in San Diego, which is just 120 miles away, the same gallon costs 81.63 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
Shelton says the major oil companies' strong presence in the state, coupled 
with a dwindling number of independent dealers, has decreased competition in 
the marketplace and led to such higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Lundberg Surveys, the nation's four biggest oil companies 
accounted for 28.9% of domestic gasoline sales nationwide in 1987. By contrast, 
California's top four oil companies -- ARCO, Chevron, Shell and Unocal -- 
accounted for 61.6% of the state's gasoline sales during the same year. 
</P>
<P>
"But, more importantly, the private branders who helped keep prices down in San 
Diego in the past today can only be found few and far between," Shelton said. 
"That's created an environment where there are very few players. That means 
less competition in the marketplace and higher prices for consumers." 
</P>
<P>
Skyrocketing real estate prices and escalating costs associated with operating 
a gas station have forced many independent dealers out of business and 
prohibited many from entering, Shelton said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are all these new environmental regulations that you must meet," Shelton 
said. "For example, if your tanks are so old, you have to replace them. Most 
people can't afford to upgrade, and they go out of business. And many 
independent operators have discovered that the price of insurance has gone up 
dramatically, too." 
</P>
<P>
Shelton says the remaining oil companies are taking advantage of the lack of 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more profitable for the handful of (major oil companies) to cooperate 
than compete," Shelton said. "In San Diego, we're seeing an exaggerated symptom 
of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
But Suchwala, the Chevron spokesman, said his company's prices -- 8 to 9 cents 
higher in San Diego than in Los Angeles -- are set only to remain competitive. 
</P>
<P>
"The major competition in (San Diego County) is ARCO, and they have taken a 
higher price posture in San Diego" than in Los Angeles, he said. "They are the 
market leaders, and we follow the competition." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why Chevron doesn't lower prices to draw more customers, Suchwala said, 
"Our company's pricing strategy is not available for discussion."

JEWELRY MAKER HOPES OLD LOOK STAYS IN; 
</P>
<P>
1928: MELVYN BERNIE STARTED THE COMPANY IN HIS GARAGE AND BUILT IT INTO ONE OF 
THE COUNTRY'S THREE LARGEST COSTUME JEWELRY FIRMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Melvyn Bernie was a 23-year-old watch salesman in 1968 when he started a 
costume jewelry company in his garage. By day, he sold timepieces; by night he 
retired to the back of his Van Nuys home and crafted costume jewelry. He used a 
few thousand dollars of his watch commissions to buy tools and parts, and began 
hawking his wares to department stores such as May Co. and retail chains such 
as Judy's and Contempo Casuals. 
</P>
<P>
Bernie said his motivation in those days was "not to starve." Today, at age 45, 
starving must be last on the list of Bernie's concerns. His Burbank-based 
company, 1928 Jewelry Co., takes in more than $100 million a year in sales and 
is one of the three largest costume jewelry concerns in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The company has a 50,000-square-foot plant, where, depending on the season, 
between 1,000 and 1,500 workers design, mold, plate and glue about 3,000 
different types of jewelry pieces. The plant is the largest in-house costume 
jewelry manufacturing operation in the world, Bernie says. Meanwhile, Bernie 
has also moved up in his living accommodations: He now has an oceanfront Malibu 
home. 
</P>
<P>
The company has made its mark by producing jewelry fashioned after antiques. 
Its earrings, pins, necklaces and bracelets -- most of them costing under $50, 
although prices run from $5 to $300 -- are all new and are made with gold and 
silver plating, but they have the look of estate jewelry that might have been 
worn at the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
The company's jewelry, 80% of which is sold in major department stores such as 
Macy's, the Broadway, Robinson's and Buffums, has proved popular among women of 
all ages. "The customer it attracts is very mainstream, from the young customer 
who wants an antique look to the grandmother who wants some costume jewelry to 
wear with old pieces," said Jim Litwak, senior vice president of Macy's 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The firm's designers scour antique shops in New York and flea markets in London 
and Paris, looking for ideas. An antique brooch, for example, might be the 
inspiration for a line of earrings, pins and pendants. 
</P>
<P>
Even the company's name, 1928, harks back to another era. Bernie decided on the 
name when he saw a magazine article that referred to 1928 as "the year of 
opulence." 
</P>
<P>
Bernie, who wore little jewelry during a recent interview, says 1928 is 
profitable, has little debt and is adding 20,000 square feet to its existing 
facilities with the purchase of a building nearby. Bernie, who is the sole 
owner of the company, says his five-year goal is to double sales to $200 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
But after 22 years of steady growth for 1928, it's hard not to wonder where 
more growth is going to come from. 
</P>
<P>
After all, other large costume jewelry manufacturers, such as Monet and 
Trifari, which are owned by Southport, Conn.-based Crystal Brands Inc., are 
still tough competition for 1928 in the department stores. According to various 
industry sources, Crystal Brands and New York-based Avon Products Inc., which 
remains highly successful with its method of selling jewelry -- along with 
makeup -- using a direct sales force that goes straight to customers' homes, 
vie for the distinction of being the biggest seller of costume jewelry in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"It's extremely competitive and there's a terrific fight for the consumer 
dollar," said Steffan Aletti, president of the Jewelry Industry Council, a New 
York-based trade group. "You can't grow unless it's at someone else's expense," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to John Harris, a Commerce Department consumer goods economist, sales 
by American costume jewelry manufacturers totaled $1.3 billion last year, up 
from $1.2 billion in 1988. But low-cost imports, which accounted for $530 
million in sales in 1989, are growing faster, Harris said, at a time when the 
market is likely headed for a slow period. 
</P>
<P>
"The best we could hope for during the next couple of years is for things to be 
flat. If we have a recession, you could expect a downturn," said Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 1928 also has to worry about fickle fashion trends. Mock vintage 
jewelry might be popular now, but will women continue to covet that look when 
clothing styles change? 
</P>
<P>
"Styles can change so radically from one year to the next," said Helen 
Malavenda, a spokeswoman for Napier Co., a large costume jewelry manufacturer 
based in Meriden, Conn. "I think that any company that specializes in just one 
thing could be in danger of doing themselves in." 
</P>
<P>
David Alverson, 1928's vice president of product development, says the company 
rotates designs constantly, although there are certain "basics" that stay in 
demand year after year. "Antiques never go out of style," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet 1928 has obviously heard the diversification arguments. The company has 
already started a line of designer jewelry, called Alex Nicole, that uses 
semi-precious stones such as rose quartz and onyx. Alex Nicole jewelry costs as 
much as $300. 
</P>
<P>
It has also introduced lines of fancy hair clips and children's jewelry, men's 
pieces such as tie bars and cuff links, and a new line of polished jewelry -- 
the smooth, geometric-shaped gold- and silver-plated pieces often worn by 
businesswomen -- that competes with the sleek, contemporary looks favored by 
Monet and Trifari. 
</P>
<P>
The company is also planning to start offering its own men's cologne as a 
giveaway with jewelry purchases. And it's hoping to expand its foreign sales 
from the current 5% to 40% of its total sales by increasingly marketing its 
products abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his success, Bernie remains a shy, soft-spoken man. He refused to have 
his picture taken for this article and preferred to let his top executives do 
most of the talking for him. His reticence, however, hasn't stopped him from 
earning a reputation for aggressiveness and innovativeness. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, 1928 is 3,000 miles from Providence, R.I.,which has been the 
center of the costume jewelry trade since European silversmiths began settling 
there in the 18th Century. And Bernie prefers to do everything in-house -- 
instead of farming out certain work to specialized jewelry shops as many other 
manufacturers do -- so that he can maintain control over every aspect of 
production. 
</P>
<P>
Bernie also shook up the industry by taking a different approach to selling his 
jewelry. Rather than just filling orders and letting retailers do all the sales 
work, 1928 was the instigator of what is now an industrywide trend of in-store 
promotions, such as jewelry demonstrations and using video cameras to show 
customers what they look like with an ensemble of 1928 jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
"The jewelry industry was asleep for some time," Bernie said. "I think we 
helped wake it up." 
</P>
<P>
Others agree. "What they ended up doing was commanding real estate in the 
stores," said Jerry Madison, owner of Jerry Madison Jewelry in Los Angeles, a 
manufacturer of precious metal jewelry. "To me, that was brilliant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Litwak of Macy's said 1928's promotions have included dressing models in body 
stockings, loading them up with pins and sending them around to talk to 
customers. The company has also set up demonstrations showing how it makes the 
porcelain roses used in many of its pieces and gives clinics on what type of 
jewelry suits different facial shapes. 
</P>
<P>
These promotions work well, Litwak said. "It stops people dead in their 
tracks." 
</P>
<P>
Litwak said 1928 has "had explosive growth" during the past five years and, so 
far, the company has been able to modify its look to keep pace with changing 
fashions. 
</P>
<P>
"Now the question is, can they keep doing it," Litwak said. "If I were to bet, 
I'd bet yes."

$70,000 AGREEMENT SETTLES EXPORT CHARGES AGAINST APOLLO LASERS INC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MEDEARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Commerce reached a $70,000 settlement last week 
involving a case in which it charged a Chatsworth company with violating export 
regulations in exporting a laser and related equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department's office of export enforcement charged Apollo Lasers 
Inc. with eleven export violations between Aug. 28, 1984, and Sept. 12, 1987. 
During most of that period Apollo was owned by Patlex Corp., then based in 
Chatsworth. But Patlex restructured and spun off Apollo and some other 
subsidiaries under a new name, Geotek. That company has since sold its laser 
divisions and moved its headquarters to Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
The charges stem from a March 4, 1988, search by federal agents at Chatsworth 
offices shared by Apollo and Patlex. In the search, government agents took 
documents relating to the shipping of lasers to countries such as Britain, 
China and the Soviet Union, a Patlex official said in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But allegations justifying the search "were not substantiated," said Special 
Agent Jim Lowry of the Commerce Department's export enforcement office in 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Those allegations are contained in sealed affidavits filed in federal district 
court in Los Angeles, and Lowry declined to say what the allegations were. 
</P>
<P>
Other files seized in the search, a Patlex official said at the time, included 
records of Apollo's export of electronic components to two other 
then-subsidiaries of Patlex: Oram Electric Industries, a maker of transformers, 
and Reshef Defense Technologies, a producer of electronic detonators. Both 
companies are based in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government impaneled a grand jury in connection with the case, but 
in July, 1989, told Geotek that the grand jury investigation was dropped, 
according to Geotek's recent annual report. 
</P>
<P>
The eleven charges settled last week alleged essentially technical violations 
of the regulations involving exports to Japan, India, Italy and the 
Netherlands. But in settling the charges, Geotek, which answered the charges 
for Apollo, did not admit to any of the violations. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, after a group of outside directors of Patlex conducted their own 
investigation into "the practices and procedures of Patlex, Geotek and their 
respective subsidiaries regarding exports and imports," Geotek fired one 
employee of its Reshef subsidiary and suspended another without pay, according 
to the annual report. 
</P>
<P>
The fired employee, whom Geotek declined to name, was fired "not because we 
found he had done anything illegal but because he operated in a very 
unorganized way," Geotek chief executive Yaron Eitan said. 
</P>
<P>
The consent agreement between the Commerce Department and Geotek was approved 
last week by the assistant secretary for export enforcement in Washington. The 
agreement settled federal government claims that on six occasions Apollo sent 
equipment abroad without the appropriate licenses -- and five of those times 
did so by claiming on export forms that the shipments didn't require licenses. 
</P>
<P>
On one occasion, Apollo sent a laser to Japan, said Brooks Ohlson, special 
agent in charge at the export enforcement office in Irvine. Exports of that 
type of laser are restricted because in combination with other equipment they 
could be used to help produce weapons-grade nuclear fuel, Ohlson said. But the 
government did not charge that the laser was to be used for such fuel 
production. 
</P>
<P>
On three other occasions, Apollo sent laser parts to Italy, India, and the 
Netherlands, Lowry said. 
</P>
<P>
The government charged that the shipments violated regulations because Apollo 
failed to get appropriate permissions. But Apollo would likely have received a 
license if it had applied, Lowry said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Apollo had sent the same type of laser to the same Tokyo company with 
licenses both before and after the shipment in question, claimed Jerry Levy, 
Geotek's treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
Geotek and the government said the $70,000 settlement -- which is to be paid in 
five installments -- puts an end to any investigation of those eleven 
allegations. Geotek said in its annual report that Patlex would pay half the 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
Apollo, Geotek and Patlex have a complicated, intertwined history. Patlex 
Corp., a public company, was founded in the mid-1970s to help inventor Gordon 
Gould win several laser patents that are key to many commercially produced 
lasers. Patlex, which was based in Chatsworth, eventually won the laser rights 
and now invests its share of royalties for the patents in a variety of 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Apollo was Patlex's laser-making division. But after Patlex won the laser 
patent rights, it spun off Apollo and two other divisions to its shareholders, 
creating a new company called Geotek. Soon after that, Geotek bought several 
defense-related companies and sold its laser divisions.

SEEMINGLY SOUND REAL ESTATE TRUST FILES CHAPTER 11; 
</P>
<P>
TROUBLED FIRM: MORTGAGE &amp; REALTY TRUST IN BURBANK FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY 
PROTECTION DESPITE BEING PROFITABLE AND SOLVENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mortgage &amp; Realty Trust is a real estate investment trust that has nearly 
$600 million in assets, is profitable and solvent. It's also in bankruptcy 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago the trust, which is based in Elkins Park, Pa., but has executive 
offices in Burbank, went to federal court in Los Angeles and filed for 
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws. 
</P>
<P>
How could this happen to a seemingly healthy company? 
</P>
<P>
The trust, with $403 million in total debt, blamed the credit-rating agency 
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. for downgrading its credit, which caused it to miss 
$105 million in debt payments that came due in March. S&amp;P blames the banks 
and financial markets for overreacting to its action. And some of Mortgage 
&amp; Realty's major creditors blame the trust for jumping into bankruptcy 
court too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of who's right, it appears that Mortgage &amp; Realty operated on a 
too-thin margin of cash. The trust makes loans for others to acquire or build 
offices, apartments and other real estate, and makes those loans mainly with 
cash it borrows from lenders and investors. It also invests in property. As a 
REIT, Mortgage &amp; Realty's income is not taxed at the corporate level 
because it distributes nearly all of its income to its stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
REITs in general have often disappointed investors because of problems 
associated with the ups and downs of the national real estate market. And even 
though Mortgage &amp; Realty is considered to have relatively sound assets in 
its portfolio, the trust's cash needs and the current sluggish real estate 
market made for a toxic combination. 
</P>
<P>
The trust already has begun changing since filing for Chapter 11 on April 12, 
under which the trust will keep operating without fear of creditors' lawsuits 
while it works out a plan to pay its debts. The trust has stopped making new 
loans and probably will have to sell some assets to raise cash. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the trust's stock, which climbed to nearly $19 a share last year, had 
been sinking for some time before its bankruptcy filing and closed Monday at 
$5.25 share on the New York Stock Exchange. The trust also suspended its 
dividend, the last of which was 45 cents a share paid in the quarter ended Dec. 
31. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble began two months ago as Mortgage &amp; Realty Trust was trying to 
arrange a new bank line of credit so that it could, among other things, meet a 
$13-million debt payment due March 13. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing seemed to indicate Mortgage &amp; Realty would have trouble meeting the 
debt payment. The trust earned $20 million in its fiscal year that ended last 
Sept. 30 on gross income of $65.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
The trust's total debt is about twice its net worth, which "is not 
extraordinarily high" for its business, said William Acheson, a REIT analyst 
with Value Line Investment Survey, a securities research firm in New York. 
Mortgage &amp; Realty also was "renowned" for matching the amount of borrowing 
it needed to finance its loans to others, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Mortgage &amp; Realty was not prepared for an unexpected jolt that hit the 
trust one day before its $13-million debt payment was due. 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;P, which rates companies' ability to pay back their debts, announced that 
it had downgraded its opinion of Mortgage &amp; Realty's commercial paper, a 
type of short-term unsecured debt that is sold to investors and that makes of 
up about half of Mortgage &amp; Realty's debt. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Franzetti, vice president of S&amp;P's real estate finance group in New 
York, said it was "an appropriate action" to lower Mortgage &amp; Realty's 
commercial paper rating because S&amp;P perceived that with soft real estate 
markets in much of the country, loan payments coming into Mortgage &amp; Realty 
had slowed and the trust would not have as much liquidity, or ready cash at 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;P's action had dire consequences, the trust claimed. The trust's talks 
with its banks for a new credit line fell apart, and when Mortgage &amp; Realty 
turned to sell more commercial paper, investors wanted no part of its 
now-downgraded paper, the trust said. 
</P>
<P>
The result was a domino effect. Mortgage &amp; Realty not only defaulted on the 
$13-million loan payment, but it couldn't raise the cash to pay loans totaling 
another $92 million that were due in March. 
</P>
<P>
The trust tried again to get a new credit line, this one totaling $425 million, 
but decided it could not live with its lenders' terms. So instead, it filed for 
Chapter 11 protection. Its biggest creditors include divisions of such 
financial powerhouses as Prudential Insurance (owed $128 million), Merrill 
Lynch ($117 million) and First Chicago ($50 million). 
</P>
<P>
Charles W. (C.W.) Strong Jr., the trust's president, pointed the blame at 
S&amp;P during the creditors' meeting last week. Strong, who runs the trust's 
day-to-day affairs from Burbank, charged that the credit change "was reckless" 
and complained that S&amp;P did not advise the trust in advance that the 
downgrade was coming. 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;P's downgrade of the trust's commercial paper, to A-3 from A-2, is "an 
indication that the credit quality has gotten weaker, but certainly A-3 is not 
a rating that's signaling a disaster," Franzetti said. (S&amp;P's top grade for 
commercial paper is A-1+.) 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the market and the banks overreacted to that and declined to fund 
the company," he added. "We only assess credit quality. We can't be responsible 
for the actions of the market in reaction to our assessments." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, some of Mortgage &amp; Realty's creditors blame the company for 
going to bankruptcy court too quickly. The creditors are all unsecured, meaning 
that their loans are not backed by specific Mortgage &amp; Realty assets. The 
trust, in fact, has no secured debt. 
</P>
<P>
"The creditors are clearly frustrated because they don't feel that they've had 
a satisfactory explanation as to why it was necessary that this company filed 
for Chapter 11," said an executive of one major creditor, who spoke on the 
condition that he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
"The general feeling is that the company took this step without fully 
considering other options available to it," such as negotiating for additional 
credit from its banks, he added. 
</P>
<P>
During the creditors' hearing, Strong said he was struggling to even utter the 
word "bankruptcy" because "we are not bankrupt. We are seeking reorganization 
of the debt." He has declined to be interviewed since then. 
</P>
<P>
Mortgage &amp; Realty was formed by the 1979 merger of two other REITS, PNB 
Mortgage &amp; Realty Investment Trust, an affiliate of Philadelphia National 
Bank; and Sutro Mortgage Investment Trust, an affiliate of Ralph C. Sutro Co., 
a Los Angeles mortgage banking firm that is now part of Metropolitan Life 
Insurance. Today, about half of Mortgage &amp; Realty's loan portfolio covers 
properties in California; the rest are mainly in the northeast United States. 
</P>
<P>
The trust now must work with its creditors on a plan for repaying its debts, 
and even some of the creditors -- citing the trust's otherwise strong financial 
health -- said they think they will be repaid in full. The trust's lawyer, 
Thomas H. Coleman, told the bankruptcy analyst that the trust hopes to propose 
a reorganization plan within 120 days. 
</P>
<P>
Strong indicated that the trust would sell some of its assets to raise 
additional cash for paying the creditors. But Strong, citing the glut of 
commercial real estate in many cities, had a warning for the creditors sitting 
in front of him: 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to have a plan that says, 'Sell everything!' at the worst 
time of the market," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: BLACK BOX BEGINS PROGRAM TO REFINANCE PART OF DEBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Black Box Inc. of Simi Valley has started a program to refinance some of its 
debt, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Black Box is the parent company of Micom Communications of Simi Valley, which 
makes devices that allow computers to "talk" to each other, and Black Box 
Corp., a Lawrence, Pa., mail-order business for data communications products. 
</P>
<P>
Black Box Inc. was taken private as part of a $334-million leveraged buyout of 
the former Micom Systems in September, 1988, by the New York investment firm 
Odyssey Partners. 
</P>
<P>
Black Box said it will seek to exchange all of its outstanding subordinated 
debt for new debentures. It is also seeking the consent of holders of a certain 
class of preferred stock to changes in the terms of the stock, including 
reductions in the rate by which dividends are accrued and the implementation of 
certain conversion and redemption rights. 
</P>
<P>
Although Black Box is private, the company said it notified the SEC of the 
refinancing program because it now has a "shelf" registration on file with the 
commission. That means the company, by updating financial reports to the SEC, 
can later do an initial public offering with a minimum of administrative 
preparation.

Martin Lawrence Limited Editions Inc., a Van Nuys art publisher and retailer, 
said it will repurchase up to about 6% of its common stock, or as many as 
500,000 shares, during the next 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
At recent trading prices, such a repurchase would cost about $4 million. Martin 
Lawrence had about 8.26 million shares outstanding as of Friday.

A NEW LEGAL CHALLENGE FOR AUTHORS; 
</P>
<P>
LITIGATION: WRITER SUES TO GET CREDIT FOR TV FILM BASED ON HER BOOK 'BURNING 
BRIDGES.' THE CASE RAISES THE QUESTION OF PRIVACY VERSUS FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Inette Miller sold the film and television rights to her book, "Burning 
Bridges," to Lorimar-Telepictures, the contract -- like most book-to-film deals 
negotiated in Hollywood -- stated that besides money, Miller would receive an 
on-screen credit reading "Based on the book by Inette Miller." 
</P>
<P>
But when "Burning Bridges" airs on ABC Sunday, Miller's name will be nowhere in 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the only writing credit will go to executive producer Judith Paige 
Mitchell, who adapted Miller's book for television. No mention will be made in 
the film nor in publicity material that the screenplay came from a book. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Lorimar nor ABC would comment on why Miller's name has been omitted. 
But Miller's attorney, Carol Rinzler, said that Lorimar claims to fear legal 
action from a woman upon whom one of the characters is based. A source close to 
the project confirmed that fear. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's case -- perhaps the first of this sort, according to agents and 
attorneys interviewed -- is an example of the effect that an increasingly 
litigious society is having on the increasingly corporate world of network 
television. 
</P>
<P>
It raises questions about privacy versus freedom of expression, and of whether 
simply removing the author's name will really protect the producers should the 
woman sue. 
</P>
<P>
"Burning Bridges" chronicles the mid-life crisis and accompanying love affairs 
of a woman, played in the movie by Meredith Baxter-Birney and based on Miller's 
own experience. According to Rinzler, the book was based on fact, but the 
characters' identities were disguised. 
</P>
<P>
When Lorimar bought the rights, the company asked for and received releases 
from the people on whom the major characters in the book are based, Rinzler 
said. The studio did not ask for a release from the woman whom it now fears 
might sue, she said. The character -- the wife of a man who has an affair with 
the main character -- only appears in two scenes. 
</P>
<P>
"The agreement provided for the usual credit," Rinzler said. "There was very 
vague language which said they did not have to give her credit if there were 
legal problems, whatever that means. And they informed her a couple of weeks 
ago that they were not going to give her credit." 
</P>
<P>
Miller filed suit March 29 against Lorimar, asking that her name be put back in 
the credits or that she be paid at least $25,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
The studio has never denied that the film was based on the book -- indeed, ABC 
sent out press releases trumpeting that fact when Baxter-Birney was signed for 
the lead role a few months ago. "The picture is absolutely based on the book," 
said a source involved with the project. 
</P>
<P>
But the source said that Lorimar's legal department is convinced that the 
studio would be better protected against lawsuits if Miller's name and the 
reference to her book are left off. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a continual battle," said Edward Rubin, professor of law and associate 
dean at UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall. "Credit, along with money, are the two 
fighting issues in entertainment law." 
</P>
<P>
The struggle, Rubin said, is between the rights of an author and the fear that 
corporations have of being sued. It is compounded, he said, because most 
studios today have special insurance to pay for invasion-of-privacy suits, and 
the insurers are extremely conservative about what they will allow. 
</P>
<P>
The result, he said, is what legal scholars call a "chilling effect" on art and 
expression. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens is that a book like this, which is clearly legal and would win in 
any lawsuit, falls victim to this conservatism," Rubin said. "The chill comes 
because the producer is risk-averse. They prefer not to take a chance." 
</P>
<P>
By taking Miller's name off the credits, experts said, Lorimar might be trying 
to further disguise the real identities of the characters, whose friends and 
neighbors might know the name of Miller as someone who wrote a book about their 
town. 
</P>
<P>
But according to Rubin and others, that wouldn't work. 
</P>
<P>
"Either what she's saying is libelous or it isn't," said Irving (Swifty) Lazar, 
a leading Hollywood agent who works with a number of prominent authors. "If 
they think it's libelous, why would they (make the movie) in the first place? 
If it's not, why are they keeping her name off?" 
</P>
<P>
"The networks are especially careful because there have been so many lawsuits," 
said literary agent Todd Harris, who is known for selling film rights to books. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, he has never seen a case like Miller's. 
</P>
<P>
"I've sold over 150 books in the past year, and I've run into just about 
everything. This is a new one on me." 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, privacy cases are very difficult to win. Unless the portrayal of 
a person is particularly negative or deliberately falsified, the courts have 
tended to side with the author. 
</P>
<P>
A plaintiff in a privacy suit must first prove that someone watching the movie 
would know that the character in question is based on the plaintiff. Then, he 
or she would have to prove that the portrayal is false or destructive. 
</P>
<P>
But sources at the networks said that even winning such suits costs time and 
money -- and could bring increases in insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
"What the lawyers are trying to do is prevent you from getting in trouble," 
said Geoffrey Cowan, who teaches mass communications law at UCLA. "And if you 
are already in up to your ankles, they're going to try to keep you from getting 
in up to your knees." 
</P>
<P>
For authors, the result is often an attempt by the network or studio to 
extricate itself from all responsibility in the event of a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"In a book publishing contract, the single most difficult clauses to alter in 
any way are the warrantee clause and the indemnification clause. Publishers do 
not want to change those clauses," said agent Eric Lasher. "And in those 
(clauses) the author warrants that everything they've written is true and they 
indemnify the publisher." 
</P>
<P>
But to Miller, the issue is not abstract legal theory, but an intensely 
personal loss. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel raped," she said. "It's immoral -- you don't take somebody's work and 
not credit them. 
</P>
<P>
Getting credit, Miller said, means being able to negotiate better deals in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
"Your credit is your reputation," said UC Berkeley's Rubin. "The size and time 
your name appears on the screen is the only thing linking you to the product 
and the only way you can get jobs in the future."

Mostly the news seemed typical for a day in this city. A taxi driver had been 
shot -- the latest in a string of cabbie shootings and murders in the Bronx. 
Also, a policeman had been wounded as he and a suspect exchanged gunfire on a 
Bronx street. 
</P>
<P>
But the really big news -- the buzz that landed on Page One last Thursday -- 
was that the highest elected official in the Bronx was screaming bloody murder. 
His beef? The movie version of Tom Wolfe's best-selling novel "The Bonfire of 
the Vanities," currently filming in New York locations. Borough President 
Fernando Ferrer claimed the movie will give his hometown a bad image because it 
depicts the northern-most section of New York as a place of fear, crime and 
murder. "Bronx bashing," he called it. 
</P>
<P>
His comments made the headlines. "Bronx Cheer for 'Bonfire,' " shouted the New 
York Post. "Bronx Burns Over 'Bonfire,' " read the Daily News banner. The more 
sedate New York Times described the entire debate as "a bonfire of inanities." 
</P>
<P>
The Warner Bros.-distributed film, starring Tom Hanks, Bruce Willis, Morgan 
Freeman and Melanie Griffith, is based on the novel that searingly pierces the 
high life and low life of New York. Director Brian De Palma may have filmed 
only two days on Bronx locations last week (Monday and Tuesday), but those two 
days generated enough publicity for 10 motion pictures. Put briefly, the 
Bronx-generated bonfire had become the right stuff for, well, a Tom Wolfe 
novel. 
</P>
<P>
"Bonfire" contrasts New York's wealthy, extravagant Wall Streeters with the 
city's legions of poor, homeless and otherwise down-and-out. Hanks' protagonist 
"Master of the Universe" broker Sherman McCoy confronts the dangerous side of 
the Bronx one night when he is involved in a traffic accident there. 
</P>
<P>
Until last week "Bonfire" had been shooting under secrecy at the Astoria 
Studios complex in Queens. But when production moved to the Bronx, the young, 
politicly ambitious Ferrer -- widely regarded here as a potential candidate for 
mayor of New York -- came out swinging against the movie. Ferrer wanted the 
film, slated for a December release, to carry a seven-line disclaimer over 
scenes showing some positive aspects of life in the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, however, Warner Bros. and the film's co-producer, Fred C. Caruso, 
said they had rejected Ferrer's demand, but offered instead an altered 
disclaimer. The wording they suggested reads: "This motion picture is a work of 
fiction and is not intended to reflect actual events or conditions in the 
localities portrayed." 
</P>
<P>
The Warner statement followed one by New York Mayor David Dinkins. He 
acknowledged Ferrer's right to voice his opinion, but drew the distinction that 
it doesn't reflect the city's. "I have conveyed to him my concern for his 
attempt to interfere with the project," Dinkins said. "The city would never 
consider requesting a painter, author or playwright to alter or to add to an 
artistic creation. Filmmaking is no different." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Ferrer said the president's office "never expected the 
filmmakers to budge. We knew all along that once they were ready to leave town, 
they'd drop it." The spokesman said that the wording remains substantially the 
same as what Warners offered last week and it is still "unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
As for Wolfe himself, his representatives were telling the press on Monday that 
he had no comment for the moment and that he had not read the screenplay of his 
book. 
</P>
<P>
When Ferrer first issued his demand for a disclaimer last Tuesday he had a 
built-in audience. The media was already at the vintage 1933 Bronx County 
Courthouse, where Ferrer's offices are, to observe the shooting of exterior 
scenes and catch glimpses of the stars. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrer told the local press that he had a big problem with the script he had 
been given to read. He charged that "Bonfire," in several scenes, "goes out of 
its way to denigrate the Bronx . . . using what I believe is racially explosive 
language." 
</P>
<P>
"Bonfire" co-producer Caruso disputed Ferrer's claims that the movie singled 
out the Bronx, saying he and De Palma are making a film "about real life in New 
York City." He further likened Ferrer's "demands" to "those of a terrorist." 
</P>
<P>
Caruso, who had met with Ferrer twice last week, said the two are still on 
speaking terms even though Caruso said he rejected as "unacceptable" the 
disclaimer showing scenes of the Bronx. "I even thanked him for the publicity," 
Caruso added. 
</P>
<P>
Among the topics at the two meetings was a reported $10,000 donation that both 
sides deny suggesting. Jaynne Keyes, the director of the Mayor's Office for 
Film, Theater and Broadcasting, said the idea appeared to come from a Ferrer 
aide and was intended as one way that Warner Bros. might assist a worthy cause 
in the Bronx. Ferrer later rejected the money, saying that his "silence can't 
be bought." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times at his office, Ferrer said, "I'm not saying, 
'don't tell your story.' But it's not unreasonable to ask for 10 seconds at the 
end of the movie." Ferrer cited as an example the 1981 20th Century Fox film 
"Fort Apache -- The Bronx," in which a disclaimer was inserted at the film's 
beginning, following a public outcry by residents of the borough over the 
violent images in the film. 
</P>
<P>
"We're attempting to rebuild this borough," Ferrer added. He noted that the 1.2 
million Bronx residents run the range of economic levels and that the local 
government has been successful in building about 20,000 new housing units in 
the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
As an example of what he termed the movie's distortion, Ferrer said the 
filmmakers had wanted to apply graffiti to the walls of the county courthouse 
for the two days of shooting. But he put a stop to that. 
</P>
<P>
"This building hasn't had graffiti for three years -- as long as I've been in 
office."

The Civic Theatre's cavernous proportions can daunt even the most skilled 
chamber musicians. Sunday night, however, the 3,000-seat hall seemed barely 
large enough to contain pianist Emanuel Ax and cellist Yo-Yo Ma, especially in 
their expansive performance of Rachmaninoff's G Minor Sonata for Piano and 
Cello. 
</P>
<P>
In their concert for the La Jolla Chamber Music Society, the two musicians 
displayed the rich rewards of their longstanding musical collaboration. Their 
partnership far exceeded the decorum of thoughtful integration and comradely 
give and take: Ax and Ma fused their probing interpretations with uncommon 
unanimity and depth. Even in a busy musical season, performances this profound 
are rare. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Rachmaninoff, the duo chose but two other works, Stravinsky's 
"Suite Italienne" and Prokofiev's C Major Cello Sonata, Op. 119. This demanding 
fare gave little comfort to the audience, which would have been happier with 
French bonbons and bathetic elegies. 
</P>
<P>
The uncompromising Ma refused to begin any movement without complete silence 
from the audience. With their consummate artistry -- and a rather diffident 
stripe of patience -- the duo refashioned the audience's expectations to their 
own agenda. By the concert's finale, the sold-out house was ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
Ma attacked the Stravinsky Suite with elegant vigor, and Ax's dry, finely 
pointed accompaniment gave this neoclassical gem an aptly industrial finish. 
The Suite, plundered by the composer from his ballet score "Pulcinella," 
elicited an edgy timbre from Ma, and in the energetic "Tarantella" movement, 
his tone was reduced to an animated buzz. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Prokofiev's Sonata called forth richer sonorities, which Ma 
supplied in abundance. His shapely phrasing and quicksilver transitions were a 
constant reminder of the C Major work's bittersweet ambiguities. If Ma's 
reverent formality had a tendency to distance his listeners, his underlying 
passion was unmistakable. 
</P>
<P>
The duo's transcendent interpretation of Rachmaninoff's giant rhapsody was 
orchestral in its sweep, yet revealingly intimate in the communion between 
cellist and pianist. The lyrical third movement could not have been more 
ethereal. Ax never exploited the piano's commanding role in the Sonata, yet his 
rock-solid, authoritative technique made his contribution more satisfying than 
any display of virtuoso fireworks.

The Mystery Writers of America, formed in 1945, is the senior organization of 
crime writers in this country. Its annual Edgar awards (named, of course, for 
Edgar Allan Poe, who is generally saluted as the founding father of the form) 
are the most prestigious in the field. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 awards, presented at a formal banquet last week at the start of a 
three-day ingathering of mystery authors, editors and publishers, confirmed the 
range of work that falls under the umbrella of "mystery," from a Broadway 
musical to traditional puzzles and hard-edged works heavy on social realism 
rather than arsenic at the vicarage. The prevailing tone was a cheerful feeling 
that the public's appetite for mystery in all its guises is healthy. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence includes the frequent appearance of mystery writers on the 
best-seller lists: P. D. James, Ruth Rendell, Tony Hillerman, Mary Higgins 
Clark, Dick Francis, Joseph Wambaugh and others whose works are technically 
thrillers rather than mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
The ongoing popularity of "Murder, She Wrote" and the "Mystery" series on PBS 
is also heartening to the mystery trade. The committee that chose the Edgar for 
best mystery motion picture deliberated among 51 titles (some candidates 
indubitably far-fetched). The numbers in other categories were equally 
impressive: 75 candidates for best first mystery novel, 220 entries for best 
novel, 60 young adult mysteries, more than 600 short stories. 
</P>
<P>
The Edgar for best novel went to James Lee Burke for his "Black Cherry Blues," 
set partly in Louisiana, where Burke has lived, and partly in Montana, where 
Burke now lives. It features his series character, a former New Orleans cop 
named Dave Robicheaux, who first appeared in "The Neon Rain." 
</P>
<P>
Burke, a one-time Los Angeles Skid Row social worker, writes with poetic 
intensity about a very real and often ugly world. His stories develop a double 
suspense because Robicheaux is a recovering alcoholic whose struggles to stay 
dry despite the tensions and frustrations of the case at hand are painful but 
heartening. 
</P>
<P>
Burke has also written four non-mystery novels and his short stories have 
appeared in the Kenyon Review and other literary journals. His work reflects 
one strain of present mystery writing, toughly realistic but compassionate, 
entertaining in the hard-edge tradition but qualifying as a work of social 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Men outnumbered women among the winners, yet it seems significant that three of 
the five nominees for best first mystery novel were women, including Los 
Angeles' Melodie Johnson Howe, a former Universal contract player whose "The 
Mother Shadow" was very well reviewed. The winner was "The Last Billable Hour" 
by Susan Wolfe. 
</P>
<P>
If there is a significant trend in the mystery field, it is the increasing 
frequency and popularity of mysteries by women, with women as protagonists, 
like Sue Grafton's Kinsey Milhone, taking over Ross Macdonald's Santa Barbara 
beat, and Sara Peretsky's V. I. Warshawski, finding crime and social problems 
going hand in hand in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Recent surveys have suggested that perhaps one published mystery in four is 
written by a woman. Yet the ratio seems deceptive, probably because women 
historically and today have been disproportionately successful in the field, 
from the days of Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, Ngaio Marsh and Margery 
Allingham in England, Mary Roberts Rinehart, Mignon Eberhart and several others 
in this country. 
</P>
<P>
This is Christie's centenary year -- she was born in 1890 and died in 1976 -- 
and there will be elaborate observances in England and elsewhere. Her 84 books 
continue to sell in innumerable languages and to find new audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Christie's grandson, Matthew Pritchard, who oversees the ongoing sales and 
productions of her work, was an honored guest at the awards banquet and at a 
90-minute seminar Saturday on the durability of Christie's work. 
</P>
<P>
She was, the panelists agreed, an unparalleled puzzle maker, especially 
ingenious at diverting the reader's eye from the culprit yet making the 
ultimate revelation inevitable rather than arbitrary. As one of the panelists 
said, the reader's reaction is most often: "Fooled again, but fairly." 
</P>
<P>
It is a kind of conjuring trick, and Pritchard noted that his grandmother was 
fascinated by magic tricks and in fact briefly employed a butler whose gifts 
included performing magic. 
</P>
<P>
The question often asked at gatherings of mystery writers and readers is why 
the form should have such a continuing and evidently growing popularity. Prof. 
B. J. Rahn of Hunter College, an expert on P. D. James, Ruth Rendell and other 
English writers, thinks that the charm of the mystery is that restores order 
after chaos, in a world that sometimes appears increasingly chaotic. It also 
metes out justice in a world where justice is not always seen to be done. 
</P>
<P>
The traditional puzzle mystery was escapist fare, ideal for train rides, 
hammocks and sleepless nights. Yet even the escapist fare, Rahn says, reflected 
its times. Christie's characters, said Mary Higgins Clark, who chaired the 
seminar, were not stereotypes but prototypes, and they reveal the times 
Christie lived in and the places she knew, from English villages to 
archeological digs where she spent a month each summer with her husband Max 
Mallowan. 
</P>
<P>
What Edgar Allan Poe began, Arthur Conan Doyle and Christie made a worldwide 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
The other Edgar winners included Jack Olsen's "Doc: The Rape of the Town of 
Lowell," as best fact crime book. Norman Sherry's "The Life of Graham Green, 
Volume I: 1904-1939" was the best critical or biographical study. The Larry 
Gelbart/Cy Coleman/David Zippel musical "City of Angels," won an Edgar as best 
mystery play. (It was also the only nomination.) 
</P>
<P>
Keith Peterson's "The Rain" was chosen the best paperback original mystery. 
Surprisingly, the Edgar for best motion picture went to "Heathers," a blackish, 
brackish comedy thriller about murderous and suicidal games among high 
schoolers. The runners-up were Woody Allen's "Crimes and Misdemeanors," "Sea of 
Love," "True Believer" and "Licence to Kill," the most recent James Bond. 
</P>
<P>
A special Raven award went to Carol Brener, for her tenure as owner of the 
pioneering Manhattan mystery book shop, Murder, Ink. 
</P>
<P>
The Mystery Writer's Grand Master award for an entire body of work went this 
year to Helen McCloy, now 86, who published her first mystery in 1938.

<P>
About 300 angry parents, students and teachers packed a Tustin Unified School 
District board meeting Tuesday night to protest stalled teacher contract 
negotiations that recently led to a teacher boycott of homework assignments. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine my concern when my 7-year-old first-grader came home and told me he 
was no longer going to be receiving his assignments because his teacher could 
not get along with other adults," said Kevin Kragenbrink. 
</P>
<P>
So many people turned out for the meeting that the fire marshal asked the board 
to order the doorways and aisles cleared before the meeting could proceed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ridiculous and it's sad and pathetic that this situation has made enemies 
of the parties involved when basically we're all here for one unified purpose 
and that's education," said Andrea Gazzaniga, 17, a junior at Foothill High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
The audience demanded that the board and the teachers union set up a meeting 
date for contract negotiations. Joyce Rohrbaugh, president of the Tustin 
Educators Assn., said the two sides last met last week and were just $48,000 
apart on the total cost of the contract when negotiations broke off. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Gloria Tuchman said the board would try to schedule a 
negotiation session with the union this week. 
</P>
<P>
"We all appreciate what you're saying," Tuchman said. "We're not insensitive." 
</P>
<P>
Later Tuchman put the teachers on notice that the board considers their boycott 
of homework assignments and open houses an unfair labor practice. 
</P>
<P>
"Teachers are required by contract, practice and school homework policies to 
render these services," Tuchman said. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers in the 15-school district have been working without a contract for 10 
months. In April, the teachers union voted in favor of a number of work 
slowdown tactics, including an end to homework assignments until a contract 
agreement was reached. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Amrofell, 17, a junior at Foothill High School, presented the board with a 
letter signed by 500 students urging both sides to quickly resolve their 
differences. Morgan Lang, an 8th-grader from Hewes Middle School, presented the 
board with similar petition with 400 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 Foothill High School students staged a demonstration last week to 
protest the no-homework policy. Some 110 students who participated received 
letters of discipline and were placed on probation for the remainder of the 
school year for failing to return to class on time. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Mossard, whose granddaughter was among those put on probation, asked the 
board to remove the letters of discipline from the students' files. 
</P>
<P>
Tuchman said the board is prohibited from discussing the disciplinary action in 
public but will take up the issue in a closed session.

BREA OPENS HIRING HALL FOR IMMIGRANT WORKERS 
</P>

Rafael Gonzalez could scarcely believe his good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
After months of running up to cars aad trying to elbow others aside for menial 
day work, the undocumented Mexican immigrant was relaxing with a cup of coffee 
Monday, waiting for the work to come to him. 
</P>
<P>
"It is more convenient," Gonzalez, 34, said as he joined more than 50 other 
Latino immigrants at the new Brea Day-Worker Job Center. "Here we have 
restrooms. We have seats to sit on. We can talk and wait for the jobs." 
</P>
<P>
When it opened at 6 a.m. Monday, the Brea center became the first hiring hall 
in Orange County that does not require workers to carry proof of legal U.S. 
residency. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Laguna Beach has maintained an outdoor hiring lot that does not 
distinguish between the documented and the undocumented, but Brea is the first 
city in the county and one of only a few in Southern California to set up a 
staffed facility open to all. (The city of Los Angeles has opened one such 
center and is setting up seven more.) 
</P>
<P>
Two other hiring halls established in Costa Mesa and Orange over the past three 
years screen workers for residency documentation. Some undocumented immigrants 
have therefore remained at their old street corners, prompting continued 
complaints from residents and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Rusty Kennedy, executive director of the Orange County Human Relations 
Commission, predicted that the Brea center will work better than the ones in 
Costa Mesa or Orange because it is designed to serve all day laborers, not just 
those with documents. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it has a chance, if successful, to be a model program for all the 
cities in the county," said Kennedy, who joined Brea Mayor Carrey Nelson and 
other city officials Monday at the opening of the Brea center. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service officials warned, however, that 
employers face criminal sanctions if they are caught hiring undocumented 
laborers from such a hiring hall. If they do not make sure the people they hire 
have proof of legal U.S. residency, the employers could be fined as much as 
$2,000 per immigrant under the provisions of the 1986 Immigration Control and 
Reform Act. 
</P>
<P>
Some employers mistakenly assume that workers from a hiring hall have already 
been checked out, said John Brechtel, INS assistant district director for 
investigations. Indeed, one man who went to the Brea center looking for a 
gardener said he thought the laborers had been screened for documents. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, Brechtel said, the INS believes that hiring halls that screen 
for docments are better than those that do not. 
</P>
<P>
"The Brea model is workable," said Brechtel, who has consulted with officials 
in Brea, Orange and Costa Mesa. "But had they taken the extra step of screening 
the aliens, it would have provided more of a cushion for the employers. . . . I 
believe that the Costa Mesa model is best." 
</P>
<P>
Brechtel added that the INS has no immediate plans to stage a raid at the Brea 
center like the one last November at the city-sponsored hiring lot in Laguna 
Beach. Thirty-seven undocumented immigrants were arrested in that raid, which 
drew sharp criticism from Laguna Beach city officials. 
</P>
<P>
Brechtel promised that his agency would notify the city of Brea first should it 
be planning any similar raid. He said that generally, the INS raids day laborer 
pickup sites only after there have been complaints of too many loitering along 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of the INS, staff workers at the Brea center are handing out 
notices to employers that the laborers have not been screened. Frank Benest, 
Brea city manager and chief architect of the job center plan, said the city 
decided not to get into the business of checking documents because it only 
wanted to get the laborers off the street. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a small community, and we'd like to have small solutions to problems," 
Benest said. The population of his North County city is about 35,000. 
</P>
<P>
Benest said the workers were causing a traffic safety problem because they were 
gathering in groups of 50 and more in a residential neighborhood off Walnut 
Avenue near Imperial Highway. The workers were running into traffic, he said, 
and employers were stopping and making unsafe turns to pick them up. 
</P>
<P>
The city began planning the hiring hall about six months ago, Benest said. 
Officials set up a trailer on a city-owned vacant lot at Madrona Avenue and 
Imperial Highway, a block away from the pickup site. The lot will eventually be 
the site of a commercial development; when that happens, the center will move. 
</P>
<P>
The city has allocated a total of about $40,000 for the program, which is to be 
evaluated after six months. 
</P>
<P>
Of the roughly 55 workers who showed up at the center Monday, 23 were placed in 
jobs. The men were placed according to a lottery system. Payment is worked out 
between the employer and employee, with wages starting at about $5 for basic 
labor and going as high as $8 for more skilled work. 
</P>
<P>
"For the weather, we're doing fine," said Carmen Munoz, the job center 
coordinator, as dozens of men huddled inside her cramped trailer to escape the 
cold and dampness.

COLLEGES PUSH FOR PASSAGE OF PROP. 111

Most voters know it as the gasoline-tax initiative. 
</P>
<P>
But the quality of California's higher education system also hinges on passage 
of Proposition 111 at the polls June 5, Orange County college leaders said 
Monday in a rare joint news conference at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Without the measure, which would raise the state's voter-passed spending limit 
as well the tax on gas, UCI Chancellor Jack W. Peltason and others said 
colleges probably will be forced to curtail enrollments, raise admission 
standards and increase student fees by 20% or more. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no more critical question before the people of California," Peltason 
said. "Really, the future of the University of California is on the line with 
Proposition 111." 
</P>
<P>
Passage of a second ballot measure, Proposition 121, is vital to ensure the 
building of classrooms and facilities needed to keep pace with an exploding 
college student population, said Peltason and representatives of Cal State 
Fullerton, Cal State Long Beach and the Rancho Santiago Community College 
District. 
</P>
<P>
The $450-million bond measure would fund planning and construction of 
classrooms, faculty offices, research facilities and library space and also 
ensure earthquake safety and asbestos removal at California's public 
universities and colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Seven campuses in Orange County would share $38,655,000 of that, including 
nearly $16 million earmarked for equipment and renovation of biological science 
facilities at UCI; $5.9 million for a gymnasium and a child-care center at 
Irvine Valley College, and $1.3 million for a library addition at Rancho 
Santiago College in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 121 is especially important to UCI and Cal State Long Beach, which 
are poised to begin construction of long-planned vital projects. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton's $1.6 million in bond funds would cover preliminary plans 
and working drawings for additions and renovations to the library, science and 
physical education buildings on the campus, where enrollment has been kept at 
about 25,000 students because of cramped facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just filled to the gills, and we really can't accommodate new students 
unless we get more facilities," said Jack Coleman, CSUF vice president for 
academic affairs. "Brick and mortar for us is very, very important." 
</P>
<P>
The list of capital projects for colleges and universities covered by 
Proposition 121 is easy for voters to grasp. 
</P>
<P>
More complex are the elements of Proposition 111, the so-called gasoline tax 
and traffic congestion relief measure. 
</P>
<P>
That initiative would allow the state gas tax to double over a five-year 
period, from the present 9 cents per gallon to 18 cents, and it would increase 
highway user fees. It also would raise the so-called Gann spending limit voters 
passed in 1979 and permit the state to spend roughly $1 billion more than it 
can now. 
</P>
<P>
The measure is endorsed by Gov. George Deukmejian, the University of California 
Board of Regents, and a host of other elected officials and community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have long argued that such an increase in the spending limit was 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
The state is already just $143 million under its maximum spending limit for the 
1990-91 fiscal year, which begins July 1. The gas-tax measure alone would 
generate an average of $1.5 billion a year more -- money that could not be 
spent without raising the spending limit. 
</P>
<P>
That, in turn, would jeopardize the gains teachers and schools made last 
November under Proposition 98, which mandated that schools get 40% of all 
general-purpose tax revenue and the bulk of any surplus above the spending 
limit championed by tax crusader Paul Gann. The June ballot measure proposes 
revising the language of the school spending law according to a compromise 
forged by the governor and teachers' unions, which had threatened to oppose 
Proposition 111. 
</P>
<P>
For the state's community colleges, which are protected by Proposition 98 
funding formulas along with elementary and secondary schools, passage of 
Proposition 111 will mean about $35 million to $40 million in added state 
funds, said Robert Jensen, chancellor of the Rancho Santiago Community College 
District in central Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
It will not mean more money this year for the University of California and 
California State University systems, however. New projections show that state 
tax revenues will fall far short of expectations. 
</P>
<P>
By raising the cap on spending from 6.9% a year to 7.7%, the governor and state 
Legislature in better budget years will have greater discretion to fund 
competing health, law enforcement and education programs, Orange County 
educators said. 
</P>
<P>
With the property-tax-cutting Proposition 13 in 1978, the Gann limit and now 
the mandatory funding for education in Proposition 98, Peltason said, the 
voters have "effectively stripped the governor and the Legislature of almost 
complete discretion. And they have reduced the scope of opportunity to provide 
funds to support the institutions of higher education." 
</P>
<P>
This comes at a time when more and more students are seeking college education, 
he said. The enrollment for UCI itself is projected to rise to 26,000 students 
-- 10,000 more than now -- by the year 2005. 
</P>
<P>
If the spending limit is not increased, the University of California will have 
to rethink its mandate to admit the top 12.5% of the state's students. "We 
would have to turn away large numbers of students," Peltason said. 
</P>
<P>
The UC system also would have to reconsider its historic policy against 
charging tuition for California residents, he suggested. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE PROJECTS 
</P>
<P>
Here are totals for Orange County college capital projects contained in 
Proposition 121, a general obligation bond measure on the June 5 ballot. Also 
included is the total for construction projects at Cal State Long Beach 
(one-third of its 33,000 students live in Orange County).

POLICY ON GRADES, ACTIVITIES PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Irvine Unified School District tonight will consider a new policy under 
which a failing grade in any class would keep students out of most 
extracurricular activities -- except sports. 
</P>
<P>
The board will consider adopting what it calls a "no F" rule for student 
activities that require participation for the entire school year, including 
serving on the student council, the cheerleading squad and the pep squad. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy would also require students to earn a 2.5 grade-point average on 
a 4.0 scale and avoid unsatisfactory citizenship citations. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed districtwide policy follows complaints by a Woodbridge High School 
cheerleader that cheerleader and pep squad members were discriminated against 
since they were the only ones to whom the "no F" rule applied. The cheerleader 
also objected to the academic rules being different at each of Irvine's three 
full-time high schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I see this as a starting point for the discussion," said board member Greg 
Smith, who asked that the new policies be placed on the board agenda. "Quite 
frankly, I'll be quite interested to see why rules applied to cheerleaders 
don't apply for other activities as well." 
</P>
<P>
Students participating in sports, however, which are considered partial-year 
activities, would have to earn only a 2.0 grade-point average and pass four 
classes under the new rules, according to the staff report. Those requirements 
are consistent with policies of the California Interscholastic Federation and 
making them more stringent could put Irvine athletes at a competitive 
disadvantage, the report said. LEN HALL

PANEL TO ENDORSE PACT WITH SHERIFF

<P>
To serve a ballooning population that now has "minimal" police protection, a 
public safety committee will recommend to the City Council today that Laguna 
Niguel contract with the Orange County Sheriff's Department, Councilman James 
F. Krembas said. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1977, the population of Laguna Niguel has swelled from 9,000 to 45,000 
with little change in police protection, Krembas said. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the course of the past several years, it's been noted that our population 
has been increasing rather dramatically, but the additional protection has not 
been added," he said. "The services have been pretty minimal." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed $3.3-million contract calls for an increase in patrol and parking 
officers and a community relations officer. That would increase by about 15% 
the amount of time officers would be able to cruise city streets, he said. The 
higher visibility could be a factor in decreasing crime, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Additional police protection was a key issue for some who favored 
incorporation, especially senior citizens concerned about residential 
burglaries and increased traffic speed on the city's major roads, Krembas said.

<P>
A vigorous storm hatched in the Gulf of Alaska dumped heavy rain on some areas 
of Orange County on Monday morning and dropped scattered showers in the 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The early-morning showers were blamed for 24 minor traffic accidents reported 
throughout the county in the morning, California Highway Patrol Officer Linda 
Burrus said. 
</P>
<P>
At Newport Beach, 15-m.p.h. winds created breakers between four and six feet 
high and brought out loyal bands of surfers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have about 5,000 people when we (would) normally have 20,000," lifeguard 
Mike Malloy said. "I wish it would get sunny. It makes the day go faster." 
</P>

Joe Haug, a spokesman with the county's Environmental Management Agency, said 
up to .08 of an inch was recorded in some areas in central and South County 
cities Monday.

VALUE OF CROSSING EASEMENT DISPUTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM McQUEENEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A disagreement between the city of Fullerton and the Orange County Flood 
Control District over the value of a creek crossing might prompt the city to 
take the county to court. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council tonight will consider whether to ask a court to decide the 
value of a crossing over the Brea Creek Channel, linking two sections of 
Burning Tree Road near Malvern Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The Flood Control District has said it will allow the bridge to be built, but 
another county department, the General Services Administration, says the 
developer will have to pay $100,000 for that easement, said Terry Swindle, 
Fullerton's real property agent. A city appraisal values the creek crossing at 
$1,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic dispute is the dollar amount," said Thomas Galvan, manager of the 
county GSA's real estate division. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton is requiring a developer to build the bridge to allow a second access 
to an industrial subdivision now under construction. But the linked road would 
also ease traffic through the area and allow better access for police and fire 
units, Swindle said. 
</P>
<P>
The developer, Santa Fe Pacific Realty Corp., agreed to build the bridge as a 
condition of the city's 1987 approval of the industrial subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
The county's appraisal of the creek crossing took into consideration how much 
the developer would benefit by having another street leading into the 
subdivision, Galvan said. Since the creek is owned by the county, its taxpayers 
should get fair value for allowing the crossing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Money gained from allowing the bridge crossing would be used by the flood 
control district for other projects, Galvan said.TOM McQUEENEY

COLLEGE WILL TRY AGAIN ON SWAP MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fullerton College officials will ask the City Council tonight to allow the 
college to resume its automobile swap meet. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 3 to 2 in November to halt the weekend auto sales from the 
campus parking lot, saying that the sales were an inappropriate use of public 
property and that the swap meet was unfair competition for commercial auto 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
The college is part of the state community college system. 
</P>
<P>
College officials contend that the swap meet, run by CarFaire Inc. of Irvine, 
was a legitimate fund-raising function. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted to stop the swap meet after a city code-enforcement 
officer determined that the event required city approval and a business license 
and after one of the auto dealers in the city complained about unfair 
competition.TOM McQUEENEY

ORLY LAPIN WINS LATEST BATTLE: ARSON CASE THROWN OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Israeli beauty queen who was at the center of several sensational 
Orange County legal fights with her ex-husband has won her latest courtroom 
battle against arson charges. 
</P>
<P>
A Municipal Court judge in Palm Springs on Friday threw out felony charges that 
Orly Lapin, 33, burned down her house in 1987 in an insurance scam. A 
prosecutor blamed the dismissal on legal obstacles to the use of key evidence 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The actress and model once shared the Palm Springs house with then-husband Ron 
Lapin, a surgeon who made a national name for himself as the proponent of 
"bloodless surgery," a surgical technique that seeks to avoid blood 
transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
The dismissal of arson and insurance fraud charges against Orly Lapin marks the 
third time that she has fought criminal allegations and won. 
</P>
<P>
In May of 1988 she was acquitted on charges of making a bomb threat to an 
Anaheim bank in which Ron Lapin had a financial stake. Later that year, another 
jury acquitted her of charges that she had abducted her two children from Ron 
Lapin by taking them into hiding for four months. At a trial filled with 
back-and-forth accusations of adultery, rape and drug use, Orly Lapin justified 
her actions by asserting that the ex-husband had molested their daughter. 
</P>
<P>
However, in late 1989 a judge granted custody of the two children to Ron Lapin, 
concluding that Orly Lapin had essentially fabricated many of her allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Orly Lapin could not be reached for comment on the Palm Springs arson case. Her 
attorney, John Horwitz of Santa Ana, said she is now living in Los Angeles, has 
opened a matchmaking business and has been making the rounds on the national TV 
talk-show circuit to publicize it.

The Palm Springs house was badly damaged by fire in June, 1987, and Orly Lapin 
was arrested on arson charges two years later. Her insurance company stopped 
payment on the policy when it became suspicious of the origin of the fire, 
according to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
David Downing, a deputy district attorney in Riverside County who prosecuted 
the case, said the prosecution was hindered by several "legal quandaries," 
including firefighters' failure to serve a search warrant at Lapin's home, an 
insurance investigator's failure to notify Lapin that he was tape-recording 
their conversation, and a prosecution witness's failure to show up to testify. 
</P>
<P>
Given those weaknesses, Downing said he could find no fault with the decision 
by Municipal Judge Arthur Block to drop the charges at the close of Lapin's 
preliminary hearing last week. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Downing said prosecutors are still considering refiling charges 
against Lapin. 
</P>
<P>
"It is our theory that she burned the house down for the insurance," he said. 
"The house was on the market, and when it didn't sell, she took it off the 
market, and a few days later it was burned down."

PEOPLE: EDISON PORTRAYER TRIES TO GET KIDS TO TURN ON TO SCIENCE 
</P>

<P>
Thomas Edison is alive and well. Just ask Drew Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Better yet, ask most of the elementary school students in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell the kids I'm 143 years old and that makes them worry about me," said 
Wilson, 65, who talks to an estimated 25,000 students a year in his one-man 
Thomas Edison show at school assemblies. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm up there to leave them fired up and ready to do something, to be 
inventors, just like Edison," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time Wilson challenges them to win his Great Idea Award. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's invent something; let's come up with a great idea," he urges and at the 
same time points out that Edison had 1,093 patents. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not up there just to give them 45 minutes of distraction," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson acknowledged that he sometimes has a difficult task. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough to reach a bunch of little kids. They have an attention span of 
about a minute and a half," he said during an interview in the back yard of his 
Mission Viejo home. 
</P>
<P>
But the former commercial art teacher, who has experience in community theater 
with his wife, Bonnie, experiences a good time during the talks that he 
sometimes gives five times a week. 
</P>
<P>
He often invents stories when the children question him about being Edison, who 
died Oct. 18, 1931. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell them I have a time machine that helps me make the crossover from myself 
to Edison," he said. "Young kids don't have trouble with that. It's when we 
turn them into adults that things fall apart." 
</P>
<P>
Although he retired from teaching four years ago, "I'm going to keep this going 
as long as I can," he said. "This is too much fun. It's not work, it's sheer 
pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has researched his alter ego extensively, partly because of his 
admiration of Edison since his own school days. 
</P>
<P>
"I like most everything about the man, including his sayings, especially, 
"Genius is 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration." 
</P>
<P>
During some of his talks, Wilson moves from the stage into the audience to give 
the children a close-up look at his vintage seersucker suits, like the ones 
Edison wore, and his shock of white hair, which he parts on the left side as 
Edison did. 
</P>
<P>
"I look enough like Edison to get my point across," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Quite naturally he works for the Southern California Edison Co. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a free rein about what I'm going to say in my talk," said Wilson, an 
antique-car buff and an Angels baseball fan. "Mostly I want to interest the 
children in science." 
</P>
<P>
But he adds: "I honestly believe reaching out to kids is as close to 
immortality as I'm going to get. Some are going to take part of what I told 
them and do something great. Who knows what they might build someday?" 
</P>
<P>
Besides schools, Wilson also addresses community and professional 
organizations, such as the Edison Electric Institute in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said his dream is to play Edison on television. 
</P>
<P>
He continues to act, most recently on television's "Divorce Court," playing the 
part of a husband having an affair and being threatened with divorce. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the kids who saw the show came up to me and asked if Mr. Edison was 
going to get a divorce," Wilson said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Yet another letter has arrived about an Orange County person with an unusual 
name. 
</P>
<P>
This one is Frontis D. Evins III of Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't like the name when I was growing up," said Evins, who went by the 
nickname Dubby. "But I like it now." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he said, he hopes someday to have a son named Frontis D. Evins IV. 
</P>

COUNTY, FEARFUL THAT PROP. 111 WILL FAIL, DEVISING BACKUP PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fearful that Proposition 111, the gas-tax initiative, is doomed to fail in 
June, county officials have begun laying the groundwork for a November ballot 
measure asking voters to waive the government spending limit for a major flood 
control project, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Should Proposition 111 pass, the spending limit would be waived for certain 
kinds of capital projects, the $1.4-billion Santa Ana River flood control 
project among them. The main intent of the measure, however, is to raise the 
state gasoline tax, and that has county officials worried that it will fail. 
</P>
<P>
If it does, it could seriously set back funding plans for the flood control 
project, hence local officials' effort to put together a backup plan. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't get any Gann relief, we're talking about losing about $200 million 
by the end of the decade," said Tom Sacco, a county analyst helping to oversee 
the flood control project. "As a result, if Proposition 111 doesn't pass, we 
intend to ask the Board of Supervisors to call an election in November to raise 
the Gann limit here." 
</P>
<P>
The spending limit known as the Gann limit was approved through an initiative 
by voters statewide in 1979. It puts a cap on government spending, based on a 
formula that factors in the national inflation rate and the pace of local 
growth. Voters must approve any decision to spend excess revenue; otherwise, 
the money must be returned to them. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the Santa Ana River project, the Orange County Flood District 
already has accumulated millions of dollars in property tax revenue, but it 
cannot spend all the money without voters' approving a waiver of the Gann 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
However, the possibility of a November ballot laden with tax issues -- special 
levies for transportation, jail and courthouse construction, and open space all 
are under consideration -- makes some observers wonder whether asking county 
voters also to waive a government-spending limit is not a recipe for disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the overriding concern of people today seems to be keeping government 
within its means," said Tom Rogers of San Juan Capistrano, a slow-growth 
advocate who actively opposes Proposition 111. "The people of Orange County in 
particular would be very unlikely to vote for a waiver of the Gann limit." 
</P>
<P>
Although local officials would not be asking for more taxes to pay for the 
river project, the political and symbolic significance of the spending limit 
would make it difficult to persuade voters to lift it. 
</P>
<P>
A carefully crafted campaign that made it clear that the limit would be waived 
only for the flood control project might win some converts, Rogers said, but 
even so, the measure would suffer just by appearing on the same ballot as one 
or more other tax proposals. "It's so simple just to say 'No, no, no, no, no,' 
" he said. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Englander, a Newport Beach-based political analyst, agreed, saying it is 
unlikely that Orange County voters can be easily persuaded to waive the Gann 
limit, even for a vital project. 
</P>
<P>
To succeed, Englander said, a campaign would need to focus on the fact that 
waiving the limit would not cause a tax increase. "I would just tell people: 
'Look, we've got this money, and we just need your permission to spend it,' " 
he said. "I'd avoid talking about the Gann limit altogether." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has said the Santa Ana River presents the 
worst flood threat in the West. A worst-case scenario estimates that flooding 
from the river could kill 3,000 people and cause $18 billion in property 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
With that kind of risk, officials say they have no intention of scuttling the 
project, no matter what the voters decide on the spending limit. If the waiver 
is denied, officials would probably have to assess a special levy on the 
900,000 or so residents most likely to be affected by a flood. 
</P>
<P>
Such a levy could easily add up to more than $70 a year per central Orange 
County resident, officials said, and the payments could stretch out for 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the task of levying those fees would go to the supervisors, and 
that could prove even more politically unpopular than a proposal to waive the 
Gann limit. 
</P>
<P>
"We just have to hope that the public is prepared enough for this project," 
Sacco said. "We have to do something."

BLANTON'S KILLS SINK THE OILERS 
</P>

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dain Blanton of Laguna Beach High School proved difficult to stop on the 
basketball court last season, averaging 19 points a game in leading the Artists 
to the Southern Section 2-A finals. 
</P>
<P>
And on Monday night, Huntington Beach discovered how hard it is to stop Blanton 
on the volleyball court. 
</P>
<P>
Blanton had a career-high 46 kills, including 15 in the deciding fifth game, as 
Laguna Beach defeated Huntington Beach, 11-15, 15-10, 15-8, 13-15, 15-11, in a 
nonleague volleyball match at Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what Blanton's supposed to do," Huntington Beach Coach Rocky Ciarelli 
said. "I expect that out of him. We did well against him on the front line, but 
it was when he came from the back row that he gave us trouble." 
</P>
<P>
But for someone who had a career night, Blanton sure wasn't happy after the 
match. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall this was a pretty bad game," said Blanton, a 6-foot-5 outside hitter. 
"It wasn't much fun at all. It seemed to drag on and on and Coach (Lance) 
Stewart started yelling at us." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said he had reason to yell. Laguna Beach committed 30 errors to 
Huntington Beach's 36 in the 2 1/2-hour struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"Dain was the only one out there attacking the ball with any meaning," Stewart 
said. "It was like all of us were in a fog. Huntington Beach was in a San 
Francisco fog and we were in a Laguna fog. Their fog was just thicker than 
ours." 
</P>
<P>
Ciarelli said the fog never lifted. 
</P>
<P>
"At least I can look at Laguna and say they had an excuse (for not playing 
well)," he said. "They've had some big games in the last week and they clinched 
their league title." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach, 13-3 overall and ranked second in Orange County, beat Woodbridge 
in four games Friday to clinch the Pacific Coast League title with a 9-1 
record. Huntington Beach, ranked third, dropped to 11-3 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Josh Borella had 10 kills and Eric Fegraus added nine for Laguna Beach. Matt 
Taylor had 23 kills and three aces to lead Huntington Beach. Steve Lucas had 19 
kills and Doug Cunningham added 11 for the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said his team entered the game tired. 
</P>
<P>
"This was our fourth game in the last (six) days," Stewart said. "Sometimes you 
have to get the kids back in the gym and work. There were a lot of unforced 
errors on both sides. I would say 90% of the points were scored on mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
But 15 of the Artists' points, including five in the final game, resulted from 
Blanton's kills. He had three in a 6-1 run in the final game as the Artists 
broke a 5-5 tie. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a good team and we hung in there," Stewart said. "Good teams do that 
when they're not playing well. And we definitely weren't playing well."

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: TEWELL NEEDS NO PULL TO BE CYPRESS' LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The temptation to pull the ball all the time is a mighty one for Cypress 
College's Terry Tewell. 
</P>
<P>
At 6-feet-2 and 200 pounds, he looks like a power hitter. 
</P>
<P>
His added strength -- due to an off-season weightlifting program -- also 
suggests that he should be driving the ball over the fence often. 
</P>
<P>
Tewell, a right-handed hitting catcher, admits his total of six home runs is a 
bit bothersome. After all, it is the same number he hit last season as a 
freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Tewell's batting average has been as high as .364 this season, but it has 
fallen 20 points mostly because he is trying to hard to pull the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Tewell is hitting .344 for Cypress with 39 runs batted in, but he and Coach 
Scott Pickler agree he could improve. 
</P>
<P>
"When he uses the whole field and doesn't try to pull everything, he's a much 
better hitter," Pickler said. "Sometimes he goes with the pitch really well and 
other times he tries to pull too much. That's when he goes into a slump." 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the Orange Empire Conference knows Tewell likes to pull, so he 
seldom gets a fastball over the plate unless it's by mistake. Instead, Tewell 
sees a lot of offspeed pitches and fastballs on the outside half of the plate. 
</P>
<P>
But going with the pitch is just one of the many things Tewell is working on 
this season. He also is improving his defensive skills and his role as a team 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
Tewell has done well this season throwing out runners; only 17 of 53 stolen 
base attempts have been successful. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, leadership abounded as the Chargers won the conference 
championship with Tewell as the lone starting freshman. But the eight teammates 
that joined him in the starting lineup this season were all freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty tough to take charge out there at first," Tewell said. "I'm a 
pretty quiet guy and it's hard for me, but I'm getting better at it." 
</P>
<P>
To assume the leader's role, Tewell had to curb his play-to-play frustrations 
in favor of a more mature approach. 
</P>
<P>
"I've stopped living from at-bat to at-bat," he said. "I now understand that I 
have at least four at-bats to get things done and try to learn from each 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
Tewell, a 1987 graduate of Edison High School, started his college career at 
Orange Coast but left there after he was switched to third base. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm going to make it in the pros or at a Division I school, it will have to 
be as a catcher, so I moved here (Cypress)," Tewell said. "But OCC was great. 
Coach (Mike) Mayne taught me a lot about the position (of catcher)." 
</P>
<P>
He had to sit out the 1988 season at Cypress because the second semester had 
started when he transferred. In 1989, he hit .316 with six home runs and was an 
all-conference selection. 
</P>
<P>
Tewell was a late-round pick of the Phillies last summer, but the team had no 
serious intention of signing him. Instead, they were interested in his rights 
and have until the June 4 draft to sign him. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to make sure I have college taken care of for next year," said Tewell, 
who is being recruited by Cal State Fullerton. "After that, I will hopefully 
have a decision to make." 
</P>
<P>
Slim lead: While Rancho Santiago needed to win only one of its last two games 
to claim the Orange Empire Conference title over second-place Golden West, the 
race for third is much closer. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (21-13, 11-10 in conference) holds a half-game lead over Riverside 
(26-14, 11-11). The third-place team likely will earn a playoff berth; the 
fourth-place team will have to hope the overall strength of the conference 
earns it a playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton plays at Cypress today, at Orange Coast Thursday and plays host to 
Rancho Santiago Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside plays host to Saddleback today, has a bye Thursday and plays at 
Cypress Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the playoffs: The ever-changing baseball playoff format is 
different again this season. The last two seasons, 14 teams reached the 
playoffs; this year, 16 teams will be entered. 
</P>
<P>
The six conference winners and 10 other teams will advance to the first round, 
which starts May 11. 
</P>
<P>
The teams will be seeded May 7 into best-of-three matchups at the site of the 
higher-seeded team. The top team will play the 16th-seeded team, No. 2 will 
play No. 15, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
There will be a single game Friday, followed by one or two Saturday. The eight 
winners will advance to the double-elimination regionals May 18-20 at Riverside 
and Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of each regional will advance to the state tournament May 25-27 at 
UC Irvine, where they will face the top two teams from Northern California.

GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: FELIX COMES BACK TO PACE EL DORADO'S SWIM TEAM

<P>
El Dorado High School's Corry Felix walked away from competitive swimming, but 
she's back. And the time off appears to have helped. 
</P>
<P>
Nine months ago, Felix, The Times' Athlete of the Week, walked out on swimming. 
She had been in age-group competition since she was 9 and got tired of it. 
Swimming in the wake of Janet Evans for the first three years didn't help, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
Her mother, Sherri Felix, understood: "Who wants to play wall tag the rest of 
their lives?" 
</P>
<P>
Corry Felix said she does not intend to do that, but she was talked into 
swimming again this season by El Dorado Coach John Bowman. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome back. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, she was the only girl swimmer to win two events at the El Dorado 
Invitational. This season, she has been beaten only twice in Empire League 
competition, despite swimming at various times in each of the individual 
events. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a good year," Felix said. "I just figured that it's my senior 
year and I'm going to go for it. I've only lost twice in league -- (Los 
Alamitos' Marci) Herron beat me by just .07 seconds in the 50 freestyle and 
(Los Alamitos' Stacey) St. Martin beat me by one second." 
</P>
<P>
It's been a good year indeed. Although she'll probably swim the 50-yard free 
and the 200 free at the Southern Section preliminary meet May 10-11, Felix has 
qualifying times in every event except the 100 backstroke and the 100 
breaststroke. 
</P>
<P>
"She's the strength of the team," Bowman said. "We lean on her quite a bit." 
</P>
<P>
Felix also excels at water polo. She started as a sophomore on the El Dorado 
frosh-soph team and played one year of junior varsity before deciding to quit. 
</P>
<P>
Felix was good enough to be selected to play on the 17-and-under girls' 
national team that played Japan in Sacramento in December. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had more fun playing water polo but I made more friends in swimming," 
Felix said. "I still get bored with swimming in practice, but I tell myself 
it's just two more weeks." 
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Desi Abrego struck out 20 and pitched a one-hitter to lead Saddleback to a 
12-inning, 1-0 victory over visiting University in a Sea View League softball

IRVINE'S NEW MAZDA RETAILER WILL BE COUNTY'S 2ND FOREIGN-OWNED DEALER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Tustin Acura, which opened its doors in March, 1986, has been in the unique 
position of being the only foreign-owned new car dealership in the county. Its 
parent is the Dah Chong Hong Trading Corp. of Hong Kong, which owns a stable of 
about 30 auto dealerships in the United States, mainly on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in what appears to be a sign of the times, a $2.2-million Mazda dealership 
being built at the Irvine Auto Center and scheduled to open in July will become 
the second auto retailer in the county that is wholly owned by a foreign 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
Its parent, Indomobil America, is headquartered in Jakarta, Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
An Indomobil spokesman declined to comment on the firm's plans for investing 
here, saying the timing wasn't right. 
</P>
<P>
But other dealers and several auto marketing specialists said that with car 
sales down and most dealers struggling to maintain what they have, there is 
little domestic money available for starting a business or expanding existing 
dealer networks. This is especially true in an area like Orange County, where 
land costs are so high. 
</P>
<P>
And that opens the area to overseas investors, who see less domestic 
competition for franchises. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell Automotive Group in Irvine, which now owns seven dealerships and two 
auto body repair shops in Orange and Riverside counties, saw the handwriting on 
the wall in 1988, when it sold a 50% interest to a British firm, Lex Service 
PLC, to raise money for expansion. Since then, the company has acquired two new 
dealerships and is about to open a third -- the county's first Saturn 
dealership -- thanks in large part to the cash infusion from Lex.

FLUOR DANIEL WINS 2 CONTRACTS, RENEWS ANOTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fluor Daniel, the primary operating subsidiary of Irvine-based Fluor Corp., 
said Thursday that it has renewed a contract and been awarded two others. 
</P>
<P>
The value of the three contracts was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
The company said Dallas-based TU Electric renewed its maintenance contract for 
two years. Fluor Daniel has been performing similar services for the utility 
since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Fluor Daniel also said it has been awarded two contracts by Pillsbury Inc., a 
subsidiary of London-based Grand Metropolitan PLC. It will provide engineering, 
procurement and construction management services for expansion of a 
food-processing and distribution plant in Wellston, Ohio. It will also renovate 
a facility in Murfreesboro, Tenn., that will produce dry grocery products.

OC JOBLESS RATE FALLS TO 2.5% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County's unemployment rate dropped to 2.5% in March, down from 
February's 2.7% and identical to the rate recorded a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 35,200 county residents were counted as unemployed and seeking work, 
the state Employment Development Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
That is almost unchanged from the 35,300 jobless tallied in March, 1989, but 
down from the 37,600 unemployed job seekers recorded in February. 
</P>
<P>
The major gain in employment was reported in the services industries, where 
employers in the county added 3,800 workers to their payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting an apparent local bottoming out of the aerospace and computer 
industry slumps, high-technology manufacturing, which includes aerospace, 
computer and office equipment and electronic instruments manufacturers, was 
down only 100 employees for the month, the EDD reported. 
</P>
<P>
Other employment gains were recorded in the wholesale trades, up 500; retail 
trades, up 400, and the finance, insurance and real estate industry, up 500. 
</P>
<P>
The county's 2.5% jobless rate remained the lowest in Southern California and 
the lowest of any of the state's large urbanized counties. 
</P>
<P>
Of the larger counties, only predominantly residential Marin and San Mateo 
counties in Northern California had lower March jobless rates, at 2.4% each. 
</P>
<P>
During the past year, the total number of full- and part-time jobs at 
businesses in Orange County has increased by 21,600 to 1.22 million for an 
annual growth rate of 1.8%.

WINANS HERALD A RETURN TO BASIC NOTIONS OF RELIGION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
ANAHEIM

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker story oozed out of TV sets Sunday night, the 
Winans were at the Celebrity Theatre offering a thoroughly different take on 
the workings of religion. 
</P>
<P>
With all the cynicism earned by televangelists in recent years and the concerns 
for liberty engendered by the political agendas of some religious groups, some 
might feel a touch of dread when an influential crossover gospel/R&amp;B group 
proselytizes for a "return to what made us a great nation," as the Winans do in 
the liner notes to their current "Return" album. 
</P>
<P>
But what the four Winans were selling in their two-hour concert wasn't 
political dictums but such basic notions as hope, trust, giving and a shared 
humanity. And their music, similarly to that of the best black gospel groups 
that have gone before them, wasn't just a lyrical expression of those concerns 
but a working example. 
</P>
<P>
Brothers Marvin, Carvin, Michael and Ronald Winans don't quite reach the 
trancelike abandon or gritty fervor of some of their traditional forebears. 
Instead, they cool that old-time gospel heat with a mixture of supple modern 
soul. Sunday, that combination often brought to mind Van Morrison's recent 
Universal Amphitheatre shows: There was a beautiful, controlled blaze to the 
entire performance, which spilled over into pure epiphany at key moments. 
</P>
<P>
One such moment came during "Right, Left in a Wrong World," a 1987 song that 
depicts a world gone awry, where "The government seems to be cheating / Selling 
arms to the enemy / And those who are supposed to be preaching / Are now 
warring on my TV." In concert, that turmoil was expressed musically with a riot 
of rhythm and textures pushing against each other, but with the Winans' four 
emphatic voices soaring above it. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers harmonize as it seems only brothers can. (The four come from a 
brood of 10 children, and lately it seems that practically everyone in the 
Winans family is staking out a vocal career. Vickie Winans, a Winans by 
marriage, opened the show.) The lead vocal duties were passed around, with 
Marvin and his twin brother Carvin taking the majority of them. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin's voice at times recalled the late Marvin Gaye, never more so than on 
"He's My Friend," where he slipped from a fragile, broken falsetto into joyous 
shouts and show-stopping displays of emotion-led technique. Carvin had 
opportunity to equal that with "When You Cry," a ballad about shared suffering 
and hope that he concluded with some stunning scat vocals. 
</P>
<P>
If there wasn't a call for an encore at show's end, it was only because the 
Winans had achieved a sense of completeness with their closing songs. Leading 
from the recent hit "It's Time" to the soulful ballad "Wherever I Go" to a 
final church hymn, the group had the audience clasping hands, hugging and 
singing along, as if it were the end of a church service.

VIVID PRODUCTION OF 'JOE EGG' IS STAGED IN SANTA ANA; 
</P>
<P>
BRITISH PLAYWRIGHT PETER NICHOLS CUTS BONE-DEEP WITH CORROSIVE HUMOR IN THE 
1967 COMEDY ABOUT A DISINTEGRATING MARRIAGE AND A HANDICAPPED CHILD.

<P>
The humor of "Joe Egg," which opened over the weekend at the Alternative 
Repertory Theatre, is nothing if not corrosive. Anyone seeking sweet homilies 
on faith, hope and charity had better look elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
British playwright Peter Nichols cuts bone-deep with this satiric 1967 comedy 
about the disintegrating marriage of a Bristol couple whose lives revolve 
around their 10-year-old daughter, Joe, an angelic-looking child who is mute, 
spastic, paraplegic and brain-damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Brian, played by Todd Patrick Breaugh, is a schoolteacher who hates his work 
and paints in the attic (his favorite portrait is "The Thalidomide Kid"), loves 
his wife but taunts her about her former lovers, and takes a dim view of 
doctors, priests and God ("I see Him as a sort of manic-depressive 
rugby-footballer"). 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Sheila, played by Amy Larson, is a churchgoing Earth Mother who 
nurtures life wherever she finds it, blames herself for Joe's condition, prays 
for a miracle to make Joe whole and humors Brian by participating in his 
derisive vaudeville sketches, caustic parodies and sick jokes. 
</P>
<P>
Not having seen Albert Finney as Brian in the original Broadway version of "Joe 
Egg," I have no idea why Nichols objected to his performance as a "star turn" 
that distorted the meaning of the play. The fact is that the entire first act, 
with its burlesque impersonations and volatile monologues addressed directly to 
the audience, calls for stellar wattage from any actor who plays Brian. He 
either turns in a charismatic, bravura performance or you can write off the 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
Happily, Breaugh lights up this well-directed production from beginning to end 
with a persuasive, sensitive, acid-etched portrait of a man long past the usual 
bromides. He brings a bright, free-wheeling confidence to the role while also 
lending it dark reserves of bitter irony. Because of Breaugh's all-encompassing 
performance, it is easier to overlook Larson's earnest but fussy stage 
mannerisms. 
</P>
<P>
In the second act -- a more conventional social satire -- we meet Freddy and 
his wife, Pam, who are both members of the amateur acting troupe that Sheila 
has joined at Brian's insistence to put some variety in her life and to take 
her mind off Joe. Sheila has invited the couple home for drinks one evening 
around Christmas after a rehearsal. We also meet Brian's mother, Grace, who 
drops over on her own. 
</P>
<P>
Freddy (Phillip Jake Smith) happens to be an old schoolmate of Brian's and is 
everything that Brian is not: well-heeled, humorless and party-line liberal. An 
industrial socialist full of empty phrases, Freddy is a perennial do-gooder who 
believes "there's only one useful approach to any human problem and that's a 
positive one." What's more, Brian has accused Sheila of having an affair with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pam (Sally Leonard) is Sheila's opposite: a bitchy, insensitive snob 
with upper-class pretensions and a ludicrous fondness for speaking in capital 
letters: "It's terribly PLU" (for people like us) and "I can't stand anything 
NPA" (for non-physically attractive). There is nothing Pam likes less than 
having to be anywhere in the vicinity of Brian's and Sheila's biological 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
As for Joe, she is played by a life-size doll wrapped in a blanket and 
deposited in a wheelchair. Her parents talk to her incessantly, projecting her 
thoughts and feelings for themselves and for us. It is all part of an elaborate 
charade that Brian and Sheila have created to cope with rock-bottom despair. 
Their fantasies, made up of love and guilt, envelop Joe like a nimbus. 
</P>
<P>
The choice of a doll rather than an actor in the role of Joe is predicated on 
director Joel T. Cotter's idea that the audience in ART's tiny storefront space 
would be made uncomfortable by a live person having epileptic fits and that 
this would blur the focus of the play. Perhaps so. But using a doll shifts the 
center of gravity. It also forces Cotter to excise a surprise first-act finale 
that Nichols himself believed to be one of the surreal climaxes of the play. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Cotter has staged the most adventurous, vivid and accomplished 
production in ART's three-year history. Whatever its shortcomings -- a 
meandering second act, for instance -- this "Joe Egg" has authentic texture, 
helped by acceptable British accents (thanks to dialect coach Allen Zeltzer) 
and superbly understated details of the costume and set designs. 
</P>
<P>
Although it would have been nice to see a stronger match between Breaugh and 
Larson, let's not quibble. Leonard gives a notable supporting performance, 
Marina Dorcy puts in a commendable cameo (as Grace), and once Smith settles 
down, he's bound to lose some of his stiffness. 
</P>

'OKTOBERFEST': PLAY IS AN INERT DEPICTION OF TROUBLED TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
Casimir and Caroline are quarreling lovers in Odon von Horvath's "Oktoberfest." 
Against the backdrop of a 1933 Munich beer-drinking festival, a nihilistic 
oasis from Germany's growing repression, they bicker, break up and fret over 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Casimir is a chauffeur who has lost his job. Caroline is a secretary who wants 
to get ahead. He's moodier, an angry boy worried about the future. She's lively 
and optimistic, a pretty girl who understands intuitively that feminine beauty 
always rises. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their youthful vigor, "Oktoberfest," UC Irvine's final drama offering 
of the season, is not a vivid or passionate play. It's the opposite, a 
deliberately drawn but surprisingly torpid work, apparently designed to show 
the moral emptiness created by the social problems of Germany in the early 
'30s. Von Horvath, an obscure playwright who suffered under Nazism, writes 
intelligently but, here at least, it's often a bloodless experience. 
</P>
<P>
At UCI, director Dudley Knight does little to overcome the drama's fundamental 
inertness. It may be what he's after -- being faithful to von Horvath's sense 
of vacuity and banality -- but the staging is problematic, leaving a production 
that has intriguing patches but is less than involving as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
Casimir and Caroline are merely symbols of the times, as is the Oktoberfest 
itself, a blatantly ironic contrast to the collective anxiety of a Germany on 
the verge of Nazism. Cindy Felice's set is an almost menacing cartoon of a 
carnival, with surreal rides and a test-of-strength amusement in the shape of 
an ominous man. This cutout seems to presage the shadowy figures who were to 
emerge, from the street thugs who became the SS, to Hitler himself. 
</P>
<P>
Caroline (Ann Hamilton) and Casimir (James Calleri) aren't the only ones moving 
through this weird playground. Von Horvath also gives us Schurtzinger (Jonathan 
Greenman), a young tailor and thinker who pursues Caroline. His boss is the 
exploitative bigwig Rauch (director Knight), a man with large appetites, 
especially where Caroline is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
Rauch's sidekick is the corrupt judge, Speer (Patrick Healey). Casimir has his 
own friends, Merkl (Mikael Salazar) and Erna (Kitty Balay), a couple of 
lowlifes surviving by their wits. 
</P>
<P>
The cast has trouble dramatizing the frequently didactic thrust of von 
Horvath's dialogue. At times, an emotional tide rises -- as when Calleri fumes 
over his fate, or Knight unabashedly displays his sleaziness -- but the general 
feeling remains staid, at times even ceremonial. 
</P>
<P>
The most striking scene involves a group of sideshow performers parading about 
for the revelers. But this vision -- of a gorilla woman, a dog-faced boy and 
Siamese twins -- is not so much disturbing and revealing as merely picturesque. 
</P>

IMPRESARIO UNVEILS ODDBALL TRIPLE BILL IN LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By now, 11 years after its inaugural production, Long Beach Opera seems to have 
carved for itself a place in the national scene. And that place is unique. 
</P>
<P>
What, for instance, could be comparable to the oddball triple bill impresario 
Michael Milenski is presenting this week, in place of the originally promised 
(now rescheduled) "Pelleas et Melisande"? 
</P>
<P>
This three-part program, now showing in Center Theater at the Long Beach 
Convention Center, offers Pergolesi's frothy intermezzo from 1737, "Livietta 
and Tracollo," Stravinsky's non-sung entertainment, "The Soldier's Tale" (1918) 
and Mark McGurty's recent, dramatic scena, "The Anatole Cycle." 
</P>
<P>
Not a real opera in the bunch, but a fascinating evening in the operatic 
theater, nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
As staged resourcefully by Nancy Keystone and Brian Kulick and conducted 
vibrantly by Richard Cordova, these pieces worked, dramatically and musically, 
and gave deep pleasures at the opening Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
With orchestras of four players, seven players and a single pianist, 
respectively, they also made aural sense in the 750-seat opera house Milenski 
likes to use -- though the last one, "The Anatole Cycle," was actually written 
for a sizable instrumental ensemble. The sound there -- even as valiantly 
played by pianist Vicki Ray -- had to disappoint for its lack of color and 
weight. 
</P>
<P>
Still, McGurty's wrenching cantata for baritone, narrator and orchestra on 
poems of grief by Stephane Mallarme, made a strong impact. Written after the 
death of the composer's friend, conductor Thomas Michalak, the half-hour piece 
probes the nature of loss and its attendant furies. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Van Derick, singing in French (Milenski and McGurty wisely eschewed an 
English translation of the baritone part), gave a powerful, faceted and 
touching performance of the half-hour work. 
</P>
<P>
Another impressive baritone, Matthew Lau, dominated the chamber-size 
performance of Pergolesi's "Livietta and Tracollo," given in the English 
versions of Goldovsky and Cordova. 
</P>
<P>
With soprano Mary Paul, Lau carried out Keystone's clever but unobtrusive 
staging smoothly and gave full value to the composer's demanding and rangy 
vocal writing. 
</P>
<P>
Kulick's pointed, surrealistic staging and the tight, no-nonsense choreography 
of Larry Hyman meshed successfully in the Stravinsky work, which was designed, 
as were the other pieces, by Mark Wendland (scenery), Christine Dougherty 
(costumes) and Kathy Pryzgoda (lighting). 
</P>
<P>
The triple bill will be repeated Wednesday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m.

A priceless 9th-Century manuscript of the Gospels that disappeared near the end 
of World War II will return to Germany, a government-run foundation said today. 
</P>
<P>
The manuscript, called the Samuhel-Evangeliar in German, disappeared in April, 
1945, in the town of Quedlinburg, apparently after U.S. military forces 
discovered an underground cache of artworks. 
</P>
<P>
"The manuscript is now in Switzerland," said Erika Lancelle, an official with 
the foundation. It represents "one of the masterpieces of Carolingian (8th- to 
late 9th-Century) book illumination," the foundation said. 
</P>
<P>
Lancelle said there will be a formal ceremony in Berlin to mark the 
reacquisition of the manuscript, the name of which she translated as Samuhel 
Gospels. It comes from the year 842 and is named after the scribe who wrote and 
elaborately decorated it. 
</P>
<P>
Lancelle said that a German antique dealer bought the manuscript from an 
American lawyer and that the priceless Gospels were then bought by the 
foundation. The foundation called the $3 million it paid a "finder's fee." 
</P>
<P>
It was not explained how the lawyer acquired the Gospels.

CHENEY PICKS 207 PROJECTS FOR REVIEW;

BUDGETS: THE DEFENSE SECRETARY SAYS THE WORK MAY BE CANCELED. HE EXTENDS A

Defense Secretary Dick Cheney extended the Pentagon's freeze on military 
construction projects today and ordered that 207 projects -- including four 
controversial Navy ports in Texas, Alabama, Mississippi and New York -- be 
reviewed for possible cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's action caused consternation on Capitol Hill, which has been locked 
with Cheney in a tense debate over slashing the defense budget and some 
lawmaker's attempts to protect local jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, in a statement issued at the Pentagon, said the order affects "more 
than $7 billion in new construction contracts" in the United States, Western 
Europe and the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
The 207 construction projects to be reviewed are valued at $1.2 billion and 
include four of the sites identified by the Navy as strategic home ports in 
Ingleside, Tex.; Mobile, Ala.; Pascagoula, Miss., and Staten Island, N.Y., the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary said he was forced to continue the freeze -- instituted in 
January -- through June 15 because of possible budget cutbacks ordered by 
Capitol Hill and the sweeping changes in international events. 
</P>
<P>
"In light of the enormous uncertainty over the level of funding that Congress 
will approve for future defense budgets, including the budget for fiscal 1991, 
I have no choice but to extend the construction freeze," Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
Citing changes in the world situation and increasing budget limitations, Cheney 
said, "Signifcant opportunities exist to reduce the cost and size of the future 
infrastructure for the Department of Defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these actions may not be popular with members of Congress who want to 
cut the defense budget even as they plead to save the projects in their own 
states and districts," he said. "But when tight budgets force dedicated 
soldiers to turn in their uniforms and leave the service, I cannot put 
construction projects ahead of people."

The government will restart the first of three tritium production reactors at 
its South Carolina atomic weapons plant in December and resume producing 
plutonium triggers by next July at a Colorado plant, Energy Secretary James D. 
Watkins said today. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins told a Senate Armed Services subcommittee that four plants, including 
three reactors at its Savannah River complex in South Carolina, will resume 
producing nuclear weapons components by the end of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The three reactors have been shut down since mid-1988 over environmental and 
safety-related concerns. U.S. nuclear weapons production has ground to a halt 
in the last several months because of that and suspension of operations at the 
Rocky Flats plant in Colorado last November over similar concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins said two facilities at the Rocky Flats plant for producing the 
plutonium triggers in atomic warheads will resume operations in June and July. 
</P>
<P>
"At this time, there does not seem to be any alternative for the nation other 
than keeping Rocky Flats on line to deal with warhead management," Watkins told 
the strategic forces and nuclear deterrence subcommittee.

The Bush Administration will consider returning Iraq to its list of countries 
that sponsor international terrorism, Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
told Congress today. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said Iraq's efforts to develop a nuclear program are "particularly 
disturbing." 
</P>
<P>
Iraq was removed from the list in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to take a look at this issue, and we will be taking a look at 
this issue," Baker told a Senate appropriations subcommittee a day after the 
State Department's annual report to Congress on terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
That report cited six nations for sponsoring international terrorism, including 
Syria and Iran, which won praise from President Bush on Monday for their help 
in the release of American hostage Frank H. Reed in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Countries on the list are denied advanced American technology and U.S. support 
for various international bank loans. In addition to Syria and Iran, the list 
includes Libya, Cuba, North Korea and South Yemen. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Bob Kasten (R-Wis.) told Baker that whatever the Administration's 
decision, he will promote legislation in Congress to put Iraq on the terrorism 
list.

President Bush will meet on Thursday at the White House with Lithuanian Prime 
Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene, the White House announced today. 
</P>
<P>
She is visiting the United States on a "private visit" and the President's 
decision to meet with her does not change the U.S. policy of not recognizing 
the rebellious Baltic republic, presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the session represents Bush's first meeting with an elected Lithuanian 
official since that nation declared its independence from the Soviet Union last 
March 11. 
</P>
<P>
"She's here, she's in the country. She can give us a firsthand account of 
what's happening there, what their attitude is, what the status of the 
embargoes are, what's the impact of the current situation, the pressures being 
put on them," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
He called it "a rare opportunity to get a firsthand analysis of the situation." 
</P>
<P>
Although the United States has never formally recognized the 1940 incorporation 
of Lithuania and the other Baltic states of Estonia and Latvia into the Soviet 
Union, it has not formally recognized its newly asserted independence. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Bush has urged Lithuanian and Kremlin officials to work out their 
differences peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
He has also held off on imposing any economic sanctions against the Soviet 
Union, saying he remains hopeful for a settlement of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater, asked how Bush will address Prunskiene during her visit, said the 
President will probably call her "prime minister," since that's her title in 
Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the name the President calls her by does not alter U.S. 
policy.

The Food and Drug Administration today approved treating chicken and other 
poultry with radiation to control microbes that can cause food poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
FDA officials emphasized that the irradiation process does not pose a health 
threat to consumers because it does not make the poultry radioactive. 
</P>
<P>
In a notice to be published Wednesday in the Federal Register, the FDA said it 
has determined that the use of gamma radiation, electron radiation and X-rays 
to treat chicken, turkey and other fresh or frozen, uncooked poultry is safe at 
the levels being approved.

Chrysler Corp. said today that its earnings tumbled 80% during the first 
quarter as it wrestled with budget cuts, heavy incentive costs and slumping 
market share. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 3 auto maker said it earned $71 million, or 32 cents a share during the 
quarter ended March 31, compared with a profit of $351 million, or $1.50 a 
share in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
The earnings came on revenues of $7.56 billion, down 22% from $9.66 billion 
reported in the first quarter of last year. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler's stock slipped 25 cents a share to close at a 52-week low of $14.50 a 
share in New York Stock Exchange trading on Monday. Wall Street analysts had 
predicted marginal earnings for the company. 
</P>
<P>
No. 1 General Motors Corp. and No. 2 Ford Motor Co. are expected to report 
first-quarter earnings later this week. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the first quarter, Chrysler held 11.4% of the domestic car 
market, down from 12.9% a year earlier.

MANUFACTURING GROWS IN APRIL, BRAKING AN 11-MONTH DECLINE

<P>
The U.S. manufacturing economy showed renewed strength in April, ending an 
11-month decline, the National Assn. of Purchasing Management reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 50.2% in April, up from 48.8% in March. 
</P>
<P>
A reading below 50 generally indicates the manufacturing segment of the economy 
is experiencing a decline in growth. A reading above 50 usually indicates that 
the manufacturing portion of the economy is expanding. 
</P>
<P>
"The 50.2% signaled an expansion in the manufacturing economy, ending a string 
of 11 consecutive months of decline, which slowed the entire economy," said 
Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the group of purchasing executives and director of 
materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The index last dropped below a reading of 50 in May, 1989, when it stood at 
49.8%. 
</P>
<P>
"The rebound should be sufficient to sustain solid production growth for 
several months and buoy the entire economy over the balance of the second 
quarter," Bretz added. 
</P>
<P>
Making a major contribution to the overall index was the New Export Orders 
Index, which rose to 60.5% in April, a full point higher than in March and the 
highest reading since September, 1989.

<P>
The Bank of Japan today announced a major restructuring aimed at strengthening 
the central bank's monetary operations and its ability to monitor financial 
institutions at home and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The reorganization, which goes into effect May 28, will reduce the number of 
departments at the central bank from 18 to 16. 
</P>
<P>
The reorganization is designed to help the Bank of Japan better cope with the 
continued globalization of financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
The central bank said it will set up a "market operations" division to monitor 
money and capital markets and to execute daily monetary operations in a 
comprehensive manner. 
</P>
<P>
The central bank said two divisions -- the bank relations division and the 
capital markets division -- will "oversee the activities of financial 
institutions both at home and abroad in their daily monitoring of banks and 
securities houses, respectively."

<P>
Television viewers continue to show how much they love Lucy. 
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old pilot for what became CBS' classic "I Love Lucy" series got 
higher ratings than the combined ratings of two new shows opposing it, 
preliminary audience estimates showed today. 
</P>
<P>
Hosted by Lucie Arnaz, daughter of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, the one-hour 
CBS special, "I Love Lucy: The Very First Show," averaged a 21.7 rating and a 
37% share of the audience in 24 cities Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
That easily outpaced the 9.6 rating and 16% audience share of NBC's "Shannon's 
Deal" and the 6.3 rating and 11% audience share of ABC's "Capital News" in the 
same time period. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's CBS special was the premiere of the 34-minute "I Love Lucy" pilot, 
made on kinescope March 10, 1951, when Ball, who died last year, was five 
months pregnant with her daughter. The pilot, produced by Ball and her husband 
with $5,000 of their own money, was never broadcast until Monday.

Blues legend B. B. King left a Las Vegas hospital Monday in good spirits and 
"asking for his guitar" after being hospitalized over the weekend because of a 
bout with high blood sugar. King, who had to cancel performances at the New 
Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival over the weekend, returned to his Las Vegas 
home for two weeks of recuperation, his manager said. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Sid Seidenberg said King, 64, was admitted Friday to Valley Hospital, 
where doctors were concerned about King's blood sugar level and suggested the 
hospitalization for further tests. He said the level is being monitored. 
</P>
<P>
Seidenberg said King had a "diabetic attack," but his assistant, Tina Brincat, 
said he wasn't diagnosed as having diabetes. Hospital officials refused to 
discuss the case.

NEW AGE PRIESTESS TESTING TV ACT AT NIGHTCLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"When you're out there speaking a positive philosophy that says you create your 
own reality and you can change it if you want, there will be people who 
criticize," says Terry Cole-Whittaker, rival to Shirley MacLaine as the poster 
girl of the New Age movement. 
</P>
<P>
Five years have passed since Cole-Whittaker stepped down from her pulpit at the 
La Jolla Church of Religious Science and the accompanying television ministry 
that made her Southern California's most prominent priestess of positivism. 
Long faded are those bumper stickers that promised: Pro erity -- Your Divine 
Right. 
</P>
<P>
To those who haven't been networking within the movement, attending holistic 
growth conventions and browsing in New Age bookstores, Cole-Whittaker may have 
seemed in seclusion, content as she's been to farm, write books, and lecture on 
the metaphysical circuit. 
</P>
<P>
All that may be about to end. The unfailingly upbeat teacher and lecturer is 
preparing a syndicated television show, the unusual format of which will be 
previewed Wednesday night at Cafe Largo in Hollywood, where Cole-Whittaker will 
sing pop standards and host a variety of like-minded acts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just to entertain, but there's audience participation," said 
Cole-Whittaker. 
</P>
<P>
Cole-Whittaker never did take her ministry to big stadiums, but after breaking 
away from the tiny Church of Religious Science in La Jolla in 1982, the former 
Mrs. California built a congregation of several thousand and drew a reported 
audience of millions with her weekly television show. 
</P>
<P>
As the author of a book titled "How to Have More in a Have-Not World," the 
preacher caught on with a yuppie audience and caught flack for emphasizing 
materialism. 
</P>
<P>
Feeling the pressure of the criticism and of a mounting debt, Cole-Whittaker 
announced her resignation in 1985 at a two-hour Easter service at her church. 
"I was burned out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
So what can participants at tonight's club appearance expect? First off, those 
making reservations for the show will be asked to bring a favorite quote. 
Noisemakers and clay -- with which to "mold something that they want with their 
lives" -- will also be handed out to attendees. 
</P>
<P>
There will also be visualization exercises and TV astrologer Terrance Guardino 
will do a comedy routine. At the beginning and end, Cole-Whittaker will croon 
inspirational standards ranging from "When You Wish Upon a Star" to "We Are the 
World."

Von Hayes broke a 2-2 tie with a seventh-inning homer, John Kruk followed with 
another, and Carmelo Martinez had two RBI singles as the Philadelphia Phillies 
beat the Cincinnati Reds 4-2 today. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Ruffin (2-2) allowed seven hits over 6 1/3 innings to give the Phillies a 
split of their two-game series. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds lost a starting pitcher to injury for the second time in three days 
when Rick Mahler pulled a thigh muscle running out a third-inning grounder and 
left the game. Danny Jackson was lost for two weeks when he bruised a forearm 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Birtsas (1-1) replaced Mahler and allowed three of the four Phillies' runs, 
including the solo homers in the seventh by Hayes and Kruk. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez singled home a run off Mahler in the first inning and did it again in 
the fifth off Birtsas to make it 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Sabo drove home the Reds' first run with a two-out single in the fifth. 
The Reds tied it in the sixth on two-out doubles by Mariano Duncan and Paul 
O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
But Hayes hit his third homer with one out in the seventh to snap the tie. One 
out later, Kruk homered into the second deck in right field.

KINDER, GENTLER RILEY HASN'T LOST WINNING EDGE; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: OUTBURSTS ARE A THING OF THE PAST FOR LAKER COACH, WHO HOLDS RECORD 
FOR PLAYOFF VICTORIES. 
</P>

"Riles" hardly ever gets riled anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Riley's motivational methods have mellowed in nine years of coaching the 
Lakers, but his approach is still successful. 
</P>
<P>
At halftime of Sunday's playoff game against the Houston Rockets, with the 
heavily favored Lakers trailing by 17 points, Riley said he felt compassion for 
his struggling players. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in his coaching career, he might have expressed a different emotion. 
</P>
<P>
"A few years ago, if we had come in here losing by 17 at the half, he would 
have been knocking things over, kicking holes in the wall and throwing things," 
Magic Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
"In my first couple of years I would have yelled and screamed and embarrassed 
everybody," Riley said, smiling at the memories. "What I really would have done 
is embarrassed myself. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't kicked a door since '82. That was funny. I put my foot through the 
door, and Jack Curran (the Lakers' trainer then) had to push my foot back from 
the other side." 
</P>
<P>
No more such displays, the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
"What I felt at halftime more than anything else was compassion," Riley said 
after Sunday's game. "They were hurting, and I felt for them. The possibility 
of losing a home-court advantage in the playoffs creates some fear. 
</P>
<P>
"So they went inside and dug deep within themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Riley's reassuring approach at halftime obviously worked. The Lakers scored the 
first seven points of the third quarter, cut the Rockets' lead to 82-75 by the 
end of the period, then caught and passed them in the final minutes of the game 
for a 104-100 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers are in Houston for tonight's Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
While Riley's kinder, gentler methods have bred victories, so did his old 
door-destroying outbursts. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's win gave the Lakers a 2-0 lead in the best-of-5 playoff opening series 
and -- almost unnoticed -- made Riley the winningest coach in NBA playoff 
history. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was his 100th in postseason play, moving him one up on Red 
Auerbach, who had most of his playoff wins with the Boston Celtics from 1951 to 
1966. 
</P>
<P>
One of their marks should probably have an asterisk. Riley made it to 100 
playoff wins (against 42 losses) in just nine years, while Auerbach, who 
coached in the days before the expanded playoff system, needed 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Although Riley has the best winning percentage in both the regular season (.733 
to Auerbach's .662) and playoffs (.704 to Auerbach's .589) in NBA history, 
Riley thus far has not received the recognition Auerbach did in his day. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the Lakers' success in the 1980s, Riley has always been snubbed in the 
voting for NBA coach of the year. He was recognized, however, as the Associated 
Press manager-coach -- for all sports -- of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Riley's achievements as a coach have been underrated, perhaps, because of the 
caliber of players the Lakers have had, most notably Magic Johnson. Forgotten, 
possibly, is the fact that Auerbach's Boston teams also had great talent, 
including the MVP of his time, Bill Russell. 
</P>
<P>
But even Riley downplayed his 100th playoff victory, saying: "This was a nice 
way to get it. It's a significant achievement for me and the team, believe me. 
But it pales in comparison to winning the game and holding the edge over 
Houston. I'm sure I'll appreciate it (the milestone) more in the future."

If the National Hockey League agrees to an expansion franchise for the San 
Francisco Bay Area for the 1991-92 season, the team will begin play in the Cow 
Palace, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The team would move to San Jose when that city completes construction of a new 
arena, perhaps as soon as the fall of 1992, according to a story in the San 
Francisco Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
The 50-year-old Cow Palace is in Daly City. 
</P>
<P>
George and Gordon Gund, owners of the NHL's Minnesota North Stars, signed a 
lease agreement with the Cow Palace over the weekend, but it is contingent on 
their being granted an expansion franchise by the league. They have agreed to 
sell the North Stars to Howard Baldwin, former owner of the Hartford Whalers, 
if they get the Bay Area expansion franchise. 
</P>
<P>
The NHL's Board of Governors is expected to act on the proposed sale of the 
North Stars to Baldwin, who would keep the team in Minnesota, and the Bay Area 
expansion franchise when it meets next Tuesday in Chicago.

Two nightclub bouncers have been sentenced to four months in jail for seeking 
money from Seattle SuperSonics guard Dale Ellis in exchange for favorable 
testimony in his drunk-driving case. 
</P>
<P>
Guy Thomas, 24, of Spokane and Russell Holladay, 22, formerly of Federal Way 
and now of Clarkston, were sentenced Monday by King County Superior Court Judge 
Jim Bates after pleading guilty to offering to testify on behalf of Ellis in 
exchange for $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas and Holladay were doormen at the Celebrity Bar &amp; Grill in Pioneer 
Square where Ellis was seen shortly before his Mercedes roadster piled into a 
freeway on-ramp divider Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
The crash left Ellis, who already had an extensive record of traffic 
violations, with a collapsed lung and several broken ribs. The high-scoring 
guard missed several weeks of action and is awaiting trial for reckless driving 
and driving under the influence of alcohol.

TEAM LUKAS AGAIN MOUNTS DERBY ASSAULT

At the very least, D. Wayne Lukas has them outnumbered. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, if he mounted a cavalry charge with his Kentucky Derby starters, 
they'd have to circle the wagons at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas would have the other trainers surrounded. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, Lukas started 15 horses in the Kentucky Derby. He'll start three 
more on Saturday -- Land Rush, Real Cash and Power Lunch -- giving him 18 in 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that says a lot about our program," Lukas said. "We deal with a lot of 
quality horses. We point toward the Triple Crown and the Breeder's Cup, so we 
should be here." 
</P>
<P>
His three this year will match the most he's ever had in a Derby. He had three 
in 1983 (Marfa, Balboa Native and Total Departure) and three more in '87 (On 
The Line, War and Capote). 
</P>
<P>
Still, while Lukas was the Eclipse Award winner as the nation's top trainer for 
three straight years from 1985-87, he had to wait until 1988 for his first 
Derby winner in Winning Colors. 
</P>
<P>
This year, none of his three will be favored, and the horse he had the greatest 
hopes for, Grand Canyon, was sidelined until the fall with a knee problem. 
</P>
<P>
Land Rush, who Lukas calls the best of what's left, won the Los Feliz at Santa 
Anita last January but finished second to Summer Squall in the Blue Grass on 
April 14. 
</P>
<P>
Real Cash won the San Felipe at Santa Anita and was second to Silver Ending in 
the Arkansas Derby on April 21. He led much of the way in the Santa Anita Derby 
before fading to fourth behind unbeaten Mister Frisky. 
</P>
<P>
Power Lunch's only career win was in a maiden race at Oaklawn Park, and he was 
third at Arkansas.

Companies taking comeback of the year honors include a diverse group of 
concerns representing California's defense, high-technology and biotechnology, 
manufacturing, retail and service industries. Meanwhile, the state's financial 
services industry dominated the list of nose dives of the year. Several 
companies -- insurance concerns, banks and savings and loans -- plunged 
spectacularly from profitability into red ink. 
</P>
<P>
Atop the Born Again list this year is Titan Corp., a high-technology defense 
contractor that took a $14.3-million loss in 1988 to restructure and divest 
operations that did not fit its long-term strategy. It reported a modest 
$2.2-million profit resulting from the restructuring that included reducing 
overhead cost and discontinuing an unprofitable line of business. 
</P>
<P>
Amgen Inc., a Thousand Oaks biotech firm, made the second-best comeback of the 
year, reporting a $3.8-million profit, contrasted with an $8.2-million loss in 
1988. Amgen, which had invested heavily in research, began fully marketing its 
first commercial drug only last year. It won Food and Drug Administration 
approval to sell erythropoietin, or EPO, a gene-spliced version of a naturally 
occurring protein in the kidney that triggers the production of red blood 
cells. The drug was approved to treat anemia, particularly for patients 
undergoing kidney dialysis. 
</P>
<P>
Other notable comebacks included Coherent Inc., the world's largest maker of 
scientific lasers and laser systems used in industry, science and medicine. The 
Palo Alto company's bottom line benefited from greater efficiencies in 
manufacturing, a $2-million licensing payment and a gain of $1 million from the 
sale of a foreign subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Coherent was followed on the list by Masstor Systems Corp., a data storage 
concern; Wavetek Corp., which makes measuring equipment, and Beeba's Creations 
Inc., a maker of women's, infants' and children's clothing and accessories. 
</P>
<P>
California's financial services industry took a beating in 1989, which was 
reflected in the ranking of the biggest Nose Dives of the year. The falling 
junk bond market was a major issue underlying the trend. 
</P>
<P>
First Executive Corp., a Los Angeles life insurance holding company, 
distinguished itself as the biggest Nose Dive of the year by far, reporting a 
loss of $831.4 million, contrasted with a $204.5-million profit in 1988. It was 
forced to take an $859-million writedown on its portfolio because of the 
deteriorating value of junk bonds. In the heady days of the 1980s, First 
Executive grew by offering high returns to buyers of life insurance and annuity 
products. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia Savings &amp; Loan of Beverly Hills didn't take quite as spectacular a 
plunge, but the company's $591.1-million loss after a $65-million profit in 
1988 was serious enough to cast doubt on its survival as an independent firm or 
its chances of escaping a governmental takeover. Like First Executive, Columbia 
rose to prominence in the 1980s by investing heavily in high-yield, high-risk 
bonds sold by Drexel Burnham Lambert. It wasn't the only thrift that invested 
in junk bonds after deregulation of the industry, but it had the largest 
holdings last year. 
</P>
<P>
Banks and thrifts accounted for three other notable Nose Dives of the year, but 
junk bonds were not the only reason for their woes. 
</P>
<P>
Great American Bank of San Diego, which lost $263.4 million, suffered after its 
poor forecast of the future of Arizona's real estate market. Great American 
acquired Home Federal Savings &amp; Loan of Tucson in 1986, only to be stuck 
with bad loans in 1989, resulting mostly from that state's overbuilt and 
deflating real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Corp. of America filed for Chapter 11 protection earlier this year 
after regulators seized its ailing Imperial Savings subsidiary. The San 
Diego-based thrift, which was not affected by the Chapter 11 filing, had a 
deteriorating junk bond portfolio, but it also had acquired a portfolio of bad 
automobile loans. 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate Bancorp recovered from a huge loss in 1987 -- reflecting 
provisions for loan losses in developing countries -- to make the 1988 comeback 
list, but the Los Angeles-based bank holding company plunged into the red again 
in 1989. Its latest problems relate to Arizona's real estate bust and the 
sagging Texas economy, said Dan Williams, an analyst with Sutro &amp; Co. in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
After First Interstate failed to acquire BankAmerica, it was "hell bent for 
further expansion," Williams said. It bought Allied Bancshares in 1988. Allied 
was not as troubled as other Texas banks that were stuck with bad commercial 
and real estate loans when the state's oil boom went bust, Williams said. But 
that meant that First Interstate also did not get the financial protections 
that other bank holding companies received when they acquired troubled banks 
that were distressed enough to have been taken over by federal regulators, he 
said.

LEWIS GALOOB TOYS MAKES A BIG COMEBACK ON MICRO MACHINES 
</P>

<P>
The toy business is anything but fun and games. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Lewis Galoob Toys, whose Baby Talk and Mr. Gameshow talking dolls were 
no match for the Nintendo revolution. 
</P>
<P>
But that was three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Riding the tiny wheels of its Micro Machines line of miniature cars, Lewis 
Galoob Toys has roared back from a loss of nearly $25 million in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The South San Francisco firm reported 1989 net income of $19.6 million on sales 
of $227.7 million, compared to 1988's income of $6.6 million and sales of 
$140.1 million. The company has made its first appearance on The Times 100 list 
of the most profitable companies in California, ranking No. 4 with a two-year 
average return on equity of 45.7%. 
</P>
<P>
Galoob "is definitely one of the hot companies in the toy industry," said Larry 
Carlat, editor of Toy and Hobby World magazine, a trade publication. "For the 
last two years they have done very, very well." 
</P>
<P>
Galoob's performance is particularly impressive because it "comes at a time 
when most of the toy industry is kind of flat," Carlat said. 
</P>
<P>
However, some analysts worry about Galoob's heavy dependence on one toy line in 
a volatile industry that depends on the whims of a bunch of consumers with 
short attention spans. 
</P>
<P>
In search of diversification, Galoob said more than a year ago that it was 
interested in buying a company to provide "a more stable, non-promotional 
product base." Rumors of potential purchases have come and gone, but Galoob has 
yet to make an acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
No Galoob executive could be reached for comment for this story. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis Galoob Toys, which was founded in 1957 as an importer by the parents of 
Chief Executive David Galoob, has grown in recent years to become one of the 
nation's largest independent publicly held toy companies by developing its own 
toy ideas, which are then manufactured overseas. Before 1985, the company 
specialized in licensed toys, such as a Mr. T doll. 
</P>
<P>
(Lewis Galoob died nearly 20 years ago. Barbara Galoob Frankel retired as 
chairman in 1988.) 
</P>
<P>
1987 brought an industrywide slump, broken only by the extraordinary success of 
the Nintendo video game system. Consumers weren't interested in the industry's 
offerings that year, which was marked by the introduction of several 
electronics-packed talking dolls -- some that could even converse with each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Galoob had trouble meeting what demand there was because of 
manufacturing problems and delays in the Far East factories making its 
high-tech toys. The company estimated that delays cost it $15 million to $20 
million in orders, which resulted in layoffs. It ultimately posted a 
$24.8-million net loss in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
But Galoob reached into its toy chest and pulled out Micro Machines, a line of 
collectible cars that are much smaller than Mattel Hot Wheels and Universal 
Matchbox cars, both old favorites. The size and the low price tag were a big 
hit with the small set and by 1989 accounted for about 74% of Galoob's sales. 
</P>
<P>
Galoob's other top product is Bouncin' Babies, a line of battery-operated 
dolls. Carlat said Micro Machines parked on Toy and Hobby World's list of the 
10 best-selling toys last year and even cruised into the top five for a while. 
Bouncin' Babies stayed in the top 20 all year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The dependence on toy lines that may be peaking is Galoob's "Achilles' heel," 
Carlat said. "The problem is how do they make up that volume?" 
</P>
<P>
Some of the company's new toys, which won't get their first real test until the 
Christmas selling season, include sad-looking stuffed animals that cry real 
tears, plush dogs whose eyes light up when the toy is squeezed, miniature dolls 
that come with rooms of tiny furniture and Mandi, a doll that talks, sings and 
even eats. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 line is "by far the largest and most diverse in the company's 
history," David Galoob told shareholders in a November letter. Lewis Galoob 
Toys has achieved "the strongest posture in its history from both a marketing 
and a financial perspective and . . . (is poised) to move into the 1990s as one 
of the industry's leaders," he said.

What a difference two years makes. 
</P>
<P>
1989 was a pretty good year for California banks, a pretty lousy year for 
savings and loans -- a flip-flop from the way things were just two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is simple: New federal rules enacted last year have shaken up the 
savings and loan industry, by requiring thrift owners to put more of their own 
money at risk if they want to stay in business. Former high-flying thrifts are 
struggling to stay alive because of soured investments. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, banks stood out as clearly the top performers during 1989 in The 
Times 100 survey of return on average assets (ROA) posted by the state's 
largest financial institutions. Savings and loans lagged. By comparison, 80% of 
the most profitable financial institutions in the first such list The Times 
published, based on 1987 results, were savings and loans. Banks then were 
struggling with bad Third World loans and other fiascoes, while thrifts had yet 
to realize the extent of their growing problems. 
</P>
<P>
Finishing at the top for the second year in a row was City National Corp. in 
Beverly Hills, an institution with a reputation as a "bank to the stars" that 
in reality makes most of its money through less glamorous lending. It was 
followed by Pacific Western Bancshares in San Jose and Wells Fargo &amp; Co., 
the clear leader among the state's giant banks. 
</P>
<P>
Firms on the Times list had to meet three requirements: be a bank or savings 
and loan, have total assets of $1 billion or more in 1989 and be a public 
company in 1989. ROA, which shows how efficiently a bank or savings and loan 
uses its assets, is a widely used gauge of profitability. A return of 1% or 
more is considered excellent and means an institution earned $1 for every $100 
in assets. 
</P>
<P>
The ROA as measured in the Times survey may differ slightly from the numbers 
banks themselves publish because it is calculated differently by consultant MZ 
Group. Profit figures in the Times list also exclude special gains. As an 
example, the profit figures would not count a $283-million credit BankAmerica 
Corp. earned in 1989 that stemmed from tax benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Three patterns emerged from the Times ROA list: Top institutions were 
conservative lenders, achieved efficiencies through mergers or pinched pennies. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, results were weaker than in previous years. In 1987 and 1988, no 
institution that made the top 25 had posted a loss for the year. In 1989, three 
institutions did, the largest of which was First Interstate Bancorp, the Los 
Angeles banking firm that is suffering problems in its Arizona and Texas units. 
</P>
<P>
City National Corp., parent of City National Bank in Beverly Hills, had an ROA 
of 1.31%, meaning it earned $1.31 for every $100 in assets. 
</P>
<P>
Like a lot of things in Southern California, City National's image as a bank to 
the stars was a mixture of truth and myth. Stars do bank there, mainly because 
City National has forged close ties with their business managers. But City 
National's reputation as a Hollywood bank probably gives it a more quirky image 
than it deserves. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, City National is a highly conservative lender. It uses its own 
appraisals on real estate, opting for the most conservative values. It requires 
that borrowers show substantial equity in a deal, demonstrate that they have 
plenty of other income to cover payments and also that they have a relationship 
with the bank that extends beyond the loan. As a result, it gets stuck with far 
less foreclosed property than other lenders. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of its activity is in areas less glamorous than entertainment. 
Important business segments include office and industrial real estate lending, 
loans to firms with less than $100 million in sales and a division that does 
data processing for smaller banks. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Bram Goldsmith attributed his bank's success to its avoidance of risky 
ventures such as foreign loans. 
</P>
<P>
In second place, with a 1.27% return, was Pacific Western Bancshares, parent of 
Pacific Western Bank in San Jose, which is made up of two banks that were 
merged in 1987: Pacific Valley Bank in San Jose and County Bank &amp; Trust in 
Santa Cruz. The bank has benefited from strong growth in the San Jose area, 
cost controls and savings realized after combining the operations of the two 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the bank's success may make it a tempting acquisition for a larger 
bank or even an out-of-state institution once California's interstate banking 
laws are eased next year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure we are on every list in town. We have been for a long time," said 
Phillip R. Boyce, Pacific Western's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Western was on Security Pacific Corp.'s list earlier this year. But 
acquisition talks broke off, sources said, because the price of Security 
Pacific shares, which would have been swapped for Pacific Western shares, fell. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo was the top finisher among the state's banking giants, taking third 
place on the ROA list. The San Francisco-based bank had a return of 1.26%. No 
other California giant came close, although Security Pacific might have, were 
it not for problems with its Arizona operation. 
</P>
<P>
Thrifts as a group fared poorly. Last year, Congress passed the sweeping 
Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act. The act requires 
that thrifts bolster their capital to protect against losses, and even some of 
the state's strongest have had to scramble to meet the standards. 
</P>
<P>
The top-performing S&amp;L was Golden West Financial in Oakland, the parent of 
World Savings, followed closely by Santa Monica-based FirstFed Financial, 
parent of First Federal Bank of California. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West, whose ROA was 0.87%, is considered one of the most skilled 
S&amp;Ls at keeping costs under control. Its co-chief executives, Herbert M. 
Sandler and Marion O. Sandler, say the goal of saving money must run through 
the entire organization. 
</P>
<P>
"Controlling costs has no secret; it's a matter of philosophy," Herbert Sandler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some stars of lists past have faded from the latest one. Imperial Corp. of 
America's Imperial Savings operation in San Diego was seized by regulators, 
while the parent firm filed for bankruptcy court protection. Columbia Savings 
in Beverly Hills, which finished third in 1987, is now insolvent and in danger 
of being seized. Both firms suffered heavy losses because of investments in 
junk bonds.

<P>
If it were a child, Conner Peripherals would still be in preschool. 
</P>
<P>
But this precocious 4-year-old San Jose company, a maker of computer disk 
drives, has already taught much more mature companies a thing or two. It just 
graduated to the Fortune 500 and sometime this year is expected to surge past 
$1 billion in sales, making it the first U.S. company in history to grow so big 
so fast. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it's no coincidence, then, that the previous holder of the Speedy 
Gonzalez record among U.S. manufacturing companies was Houston-based Compaq 
Computer Corp., which provided millions of dollars of start-up money for Conner 
Peripherals when no venture capitalist would touch it. 
</P>
<P>
With sales that soared 175% from the year before to $704.9 million, Conner 
Peripherals vaulted into 87th position on The Sales 100, the Times' list of 
California's largest companies based on revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Business has boomed, observers say, primarily on the strength of fast customer 
service and Chief Executive Finis F. Conner's canny recognition that the 
company should focus on smaller disk drives, or data storage devices, for 
computer workstations and the new generation of desktop, portable, laptop and 
notebook computers. 
</P>
<P>
Conner Peripherals was one of a dozen newcomers to the list, many of them young 
zoomers that demonstrated a knack for growth by providing the right product or 
service at the right time. 
</P>
<P>
They joined the usual array of old-line California energy, banking and computer 
behemoths that routinely head the list, including top-ranked Chevron, with 
$29.4 billion in sales. 
</P>
<P>
Of 830 California companies surveyed by MZ Group, The Sales 100 generated 85% 
of a total $406 billion in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, there was fairly strong revenue growth of about 10%" for The Sales 
100, said Kevin Colosimo, vice president of MZ Group in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
But bigger sales didn't necessarily mean better profits. Companies on the 
roster showed an overall earnings decline of 17%. 
</P>
<P>
"There were very few bright spots," Colosimo noted. "A sales rise doesn't 
always mean the companies are getting healthier." 
</P>
<P>
Computer products companies in particular showed strength, with sales in the 
sector growing to $27.9 billion from $22.2 billion. That was despite widespread 
volatility in the market and a trend toward sharply lower productivity, as at 
Apple Computer. Conner Peripherals' hypergrowth helped. 
</P>
<P>
"Companies with new leading-edge products (for) emerging markets are poised for 
this large jump in sales," said Todd D. Bakar, a technology analyst with 
Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Among other technology-related companies that made the sales grade were Softsel 
Computer Products (No. 94), which merged April 9 with Microamerica to create 
the nation's largest distributor of personal computers and software; Oracle 
Systems (No. 83), a supplier of software that lets companies use their 
databases to best advantage, and LSI Logic (No. 99), which developed a design 
system that saves customers time and money by allowing them to simulate new 
electronic products on computers rather than round up parts and build them. 
</P>
<P>
FHP International Corp. and PacifiCare Health Systems, two health maintenance 
organizations that hopped aboard at No. 90 and No. 92, respectively, are 
benefiting from the crisis in employee health care that is prompting more 
companies to seek lower-cost solutions. 
</P>
<P>
FHP and PacifiCare, which have shown growth in members of more than 25% a year, 
"have the luxury of demand exceeding supply," said Larry Selwitz, an analyst 
with the Newport Beach investment firm of Cruttenden &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
The companies follow different strategies. Whereas FHP owns and operates most 
of its own facilities and hires most of its own doctors, PacifiCare contracts 
with outside physicians and hospitals or clinics to provide services. FHP, 
therefore, makes greater capital investments but also has more control over 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
Both companies have been able to raise premiums substantially in recent years. 
Most of FHP's income comes from operations, whereas PacifiCare to date has 
derived most of its profits from investments. 
</P>
<P>
"(These) HMOs are almost like printing presses for cash," Selwitz said. 
</P>
<P>
No surprise here: High-flying L.A. Gear, the maker of snazzy athletic shoes 
that has captured the hearts and wallets of millions of young American 
consumers, joined the list at No. 95. Although a bevy of skeptical stock 
watchers routinely contend that it's only a matter of time before this bubble 
bursts, the company's sales continued their phenomenal growth, with a 176% 
gain. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Schwab, parent of the nation's largest discount brokerage company, also 
made the list at No. 97, thanks to a 41% gain in sales. The company, with one 
of the most valued franchises in the investment community, has embarked on a 
long-term strategy of aggressively opening branch offices nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
It has 111, plans 15 more openings this year and might add as many as 10 or 15 
per year for several years to come, according to M. Doyle Lyons, an analyst 
with Merrill Lynch Research in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"Each branch raises revenues," she said. Although costs rise as the company 
adds offices, market share also grows. The strategy leads to a little more 
volatility for earnings near term, Lyons said, "but long term I'd say it's an 
excellent strategy." 
</P>
<P>
Heading the group of newcomers at No. 75 is MagneTek, a Los Angeles company 
that got off the ground in 1984 largely thanks to the high-yield, high-risk 
instruments that came to be called junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The company started by buying the operations of Litton Industries' Magnetics 
Group. Since then, MagneTek has grown by acquiring the electrical equipment 
subsidiaries sold off by several conglomerates. 
</P>
<P>
"Our philosophy is one of niche markets," said President Frank Perna Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The company repairs and maintains power-generating equipment for utility 
companies and makes a wide range of electrical equipment products, including 
ballasts for outdoor signs and fluorescent lights and motors for bathroom and 
kitchen ventilation fans, swimming pools and spas. (Ballasts are transformers 
that regulate or alter electrical current.) 
</P>
<P>
Perna estimated that 80% of new homes being built in the United States have a 
MagneTek motor in them. And MagneTek ballasts light up the golden arches at 
many a McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the dozen newcomers are three companies that emerged from the wing 
of a parent. 
</P>
<P>
Allergan (No. 79), a well-known player in eye and skin care, was spun off to 
shareholders of SmithKline Beckman (now SmithKline Beecham) in July, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
After T. Boone Pickens failed in his bid to buy Unocal in 1985, the company 
formed a master limited partnership to hold the oil and gas exploration, 
development and production assets of Unocal. That company, Union Exploration 
Partners, which is 95% owned by Unocal, made the list at No. 84. 
</P>
<P>
And joining the list in the 100th spot is Argonaut Group, a mid-tier 
underwriter of workers' compensation insurance and other property and casualty 
lines that was spun off by Teledyne in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Like many other insurers in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Argonaut "got 
killed" by medical liability claims, according to Dan B. Williams, an analyst 
with Sutro &amp; Co. in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The company's salvation, Williams said, was that its investment portfolio had 
been run astutely by Teledyne Chairman Henry E. Singleton, who invested in 
takeover candidates during the wild and woolly merger and acquisition days.

<P>
Despite a diverse economy that would be the envy of most industrialized 
nations, one segment always stands out from the pack in California. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning it was gold. Then agriculture. Now it's technology -- a broad 
spectrum of an industry that is expected to remain among the fastest-growing 
segments of the world economy for the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
California is particularly fortunate because it is home to literally scores of 
small high-tech companies that toil at the forefront of emerging technology 
markets, where growth opportunities are the brightest. 
</P>
<P>
"This state is still a hotbed of entrepreneurial effort," says Philip Vincent, 
the senior economist for First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles. "We are envied 
by other states and nations. It is clear that high technology will continue to 
play a strong role in California." 
</P>
<P>
But before we get too giddy, let us remember that high technology does have a 
downside. 
</P>
<P>
It matures -- very quickly -- as Massachusetts found out during the past year, 
when a number of its large computer makers fell on hard times. It's as prone to 
business cycles as other industries. As industries go, it hasn't been the 
source of a lot of new job creations in California. And, finally, competition 
is intense, particularly from Pacific Rim nations. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the negative aspects, high-technology firms are a major source of the 
growth in the state's total industrial sales. Even last year, when many of the 
nation's larger computer makers and suppliers saw their growth rates stall, 
smaller technology companies in California fared well. 
</P>
<P>
According to industry survey data provided by MZ Group of San Francisco, 
high-tech revenue in 1989 grew 17.8% from the year before, a performance second 
only to the retail sector, where sales grew 19.1%. And fully half of the Growth 
100 companies are involved in high technology: from semiconductors to computers 
-- both large and small -- to medical devices to biotechnology to software to 
aerospace and computer components. 
</P>
<P>
Some companies that made the list are quite small, with annual sales of less 
than $75 million. Others are large, billion-dollar companies, including Apple 
Computer, Intel and Sun Microsystems. But they share a common fast track. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the 830 companies surveyed for The Times posted an average sales 
growth rate of 8.8% in 1989. Of the 100 fastest-growing, a list that admittedly 
favors smaller companies, the median growth rate -- the midpoint on the tally 
-- was about 38%. (To be ranked in The Growth 100, a company had to have sales 
of $30 million in 1989 and be publicly traded for the past three years.) 
</P>
<P>
Despite the dominance of high technology, other sectors contributed to the 
state's growth. 
</P>
<P>
Maxxam Inc., a natural resources holding company that includes real estate 
ventures and Pacific Lumber, topped the Growth 100 list for the second year in 
a row in part because of its purchase in late 1988 of KaiserTech, an Oakland 
aluminum and chemicals concern. And L.A. Gear, a Los Angeles company whose 
athletic shoes stand out in aerobic dance studios as well as basketball courts, 
repeated in the No. 2 spot on the Growth 100 list. 
</P>
<P>
However, those two, along with newcomer Lewis Galoob Toys in the No. 4 
position, are the only companies not involved in high technology among the 
state's Top 10 fastest-growing companies -- a fact that underscores the 
dominance of the state's technology sector. 
</P>
<P>
Economists expect small technology companies to continue to be the source of 
the state's fast growth for the remainder of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Where are the opportunities for the coming decade? 
</P>
<P>
Analysts generally agree that the fastest-growing tech sectors will be computer 
software, biotechnology, electronic medical devices, data communications and 
specialized computer chips. The state will continue to attract new ventures, 
analysts say, because high tech has already established such a strong foothold 
here and the important services and support networks are in place to nurture 
new efforts. 
</P>
<P>
This "infrastructure," as it is called, is particularly established in the 
Silicon Valley, Orange County, northern San Diego County and the western 
portion of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The venture capitalists, lawyers, accountants, bankers, real estate agents and 
universities, says one Bank of America banker in Palo Alto, know how to do 
business with a new technology company and have grown to understand the special 
needs of these companies. 
</P>
<P>
For example, she notes that in the Silicon Valley, landlords of new technology 
companies sometimes take stock options in lieu of lease payments from start-up 
companies, understanding their tenants' cash shortage and the potential for a 
huge payoff that the options can have. 
</P>
<P>
The existing base of companies also means that there is a ready source of 
engineers and others to spin off new ventures, some right in the shadow of 
their former employers. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite everything -- the high real estate and the school system," says 
Jeanette Garrety, an economist specializing in the high technology sector for 
the Bank of America in San Francisco, "California still has a good climate for 
small high-tech companies."

SALES SOAR FOR THE MAKER OF SUPERCOMPUTERS WHOSE SYSTEMS ARE HELPING WORKERS TO 
'TURN DATA INTO REAL INFORMATION.'

<P>
When you think of supercomputers, Cray may be the name that first springs to 
mind. And with good reason, because Seymour Cray invented the powerful, giant 
electronic species so popular in research laboratories and universities. 
</P>
<P>
But there are other supercomputers in this world, machines that don't help 
predict weather systems, build nuclear bombs or design airplanes. They track an 
airline's frequent-flier program, a department store chain's nationwide 
inventory or a bank's customer transactions. 
</P>
<P>
These are the type of machines built by Teradata Corp., an El Segundo company 
that jumped into the No. 10 spot on the 1989 Growth 100 list of the 
fastest-growing California companies. The company was created 10 years ago to 
build machines that track and cross-index massive quantities of data that can 
be retrieved from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
In industry parlance, these are "database management" computers. But in the 
words of Kenneth Simonds, chairman and president of Teradata, they are systems 
that "turn data into real information that workers can use in their everyday 
jobs and (that) companies can use to further their strategies." 
</P>
<P>
Simonds' assessment goes a long way toward explaining why the popularity of 
database systems is soaring while sales of supercomputers for scientific 
research are falling. It also helps explain why Teradata, an early entrant into 
this field, had revenues of $137 million in its 1989 fiscal year and is 
expected to report sales of as much as $220 million for the year ending June 
30. 
</P>
<P>
Although Teradata has been relatively unknown to the general public, its 
customers include some of America's best-known corporations, such as K mart, 
Citicorp, American Airlines and AT&amp;T. The company has installed 240 
systems, priced from $500,000 to $15 million, for 105 customers, most of them

"We're in the fastest-growing segment of the computer industry," Simonds said. 
"Our type of machines can handle large databases better than the traditional 
mainframe computers." 
</P>
<P>
But the traditional mainframe manufacturers are catching on, too -- on both 
sides of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Besides fending off competition from IBM's top-of-the-line computers, Teradata 
is preparing for a stiff onslaught from such Japanese electronics giants as 
Toshiba, NEC, Mitsubishi and Hitachi, all of which are known to have database 
computer research projects under way. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Simonds remains confident about Teradata's prospects. "If we're as right 
as we think we are about this market," he said, "then there's got to be an 
enormous number of companies that will get interested."

<P>
The Silicon Valley Group is not one of those overnight corporate successes that 
seem to overflow within the San Jose ZIP code. It only looks that way. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, after more than a decade of relative obscurity and modest sales, the 
small maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment burst into the national 
spotlight on the news that IBM, among others, had agreed to help it buy a 
technology company that had been much sought after by the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Silicon Valley Group's purchase of the optical lithography division of 
Perkin-Elmer is scheduled to become final shortly, and when it is, the company 
will be one of the world's major suppliers of semiconductor manufacturing 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase will, of course, cause the company's sales to make another 
remarkable jump -- repeating the performance of the past two years, when its 
revenue grew annually by an average of 82.6% to $131.1 million at the end of 
its 1989 fiscal year last September. The accomplishment earned the company the 
No. 5 spot on The Growth 100, which ranks the fastest-growing companies in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
But the deal will also thrust SVG into the middle of one of the most promising 
new semiconductor-making technologies. Perhaps more important, it will assume a 
leading role in a business increasingly recognized as critical to maintaining 
the competitive edge of the nation's entire electronics industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The deal is a strategic play for us," said Papken S. DerTorossian, the 
company's 51-year-old president and chief executive. "This will help us become 
a world-class player." 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time DerTorossian, an MIT-trained engineer, has gone 
after a strategic acquisition to expand his company. In 1988, the company more 
than doubled its size by buying Thermco Systems Inc. in Orange, a maker of 
furnaces used in computer chip production. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1977 and a public company since 1983, SVG has been on a fast growth 
curve for three years, a period that coincides with increasing Japanese 
dominance of the market for advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the tough foreign competition, DerTorossian, a native of Turkey who has 
been at the helm of SVG since 1984, says he is determined to put up the best 
fight possible on behalf of the U.S. semiconductor industry. To that extent he 
has become active in international trade and competitiveness issues and is the 
chairman of the American Electronics Assn.'s International Public Affairs 
Steering Committee. 
</P>
<P>
His extracurricular activities apparently served the company well, because 
several of his contacts have reportedly agreed to help SVG purchase the 
Perkin-Elmer optical lithography business. Some, such as IBM, are making a 
direct investment in the company; others have made purchase commitments. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly DerTorossian feels that SVG is finally moving into the big leagues of 
the industry. "If you want to be successful, you have to choose your friends 
well," DerTorossian said of his new partners. "You can't fight a war with 
sticks. You gotta have some guns."

<P>
Progressive Nursing Services in Los Angeles has grown from a staff of four 
nurses in 1985 to 200 today, and expects to hire 100 more this year alone. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the scale, California's fifth-largest employer, National 
Medical Enterprises, has added 3,700 employees in the past two years and plans 
to hire "across the board" this year -- if it can find the workers, that is. 
</P>
<P>
If you're a nurse, pharmacist, medical technician or other health professional, 
chances are you will be able to write your own prescription for a job. Health 
services is one of California's leading areas of job growth, The Times survey 
-- and other forecasts -- of hiring trends indicate. 
</P>
<P>
The demand for health care has mushroomed because of an aging population, new 
services and advanced technology that is extending the lives of critically ill 
people who might not have survived in an earlier age, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all scrambling for resources," said Norma Resneder, National's director 
of human resources. "It's as competitive as I've seen it in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
About 57% of 14 publicly traded health-service firms surveyed by MZ Group of 
San Francisco for The Times reported plans to increase hiring this year. That 
was the highest percentage in three years -- contrasted with 23% in 1987 and 
30.8% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Companies involved in services, financial services, retail and computer 
products are also expected to produce a job bonanza, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
In the service sector, 63.9% of 36 firms surveyed planned to add staff, a boost 
from 48.4% the previous year. The survey also showed expansion plans among 
56.7% of 30 financial services firms and 54.5% of 22 retailers. Aging baby 
boomers, who are saving more and thus needing investment vehicles, has helped 
spur the growth in financial services jobs, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
In high-tech, the hiring outlook has dimmed. The proportion of computer 
products firms planning to add staff has dropped to 50.7% from 72.1% the 
previous year and, among electronics companies, to 48.6% from 62.3%. 
</P>
<P>
Firms involved in energy, basic materials, real estate, telecommunications and 
utilities reported no new plans to significantly increase their hiring this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The general increase in service jobs reflects the maturing of the economy that 
has occurred during the past 30 years, said David Hensley, director of 
California forecasting for the Business Forecasting Project at UCLA. Because 
businesses are continuously making productivity gains in manufacturing, 
reducing the need for workers, the labor needs are shifting toward service, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Job growth in Southern California is expected to grow twice as fast as the 
national rate, with expansions in high-technology, entertainment and 
international trade more than offsetting cuts in the aerospace industry, said 
Steve Levy, director of the California Center for Continuing Study of the 
California Economy in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1989 and 1990, we've gone through a portion of the Defense cutbacks, and 
those people, in a macro-sense, have been absorbed very well," Levy said. "The 
reason we're able to start so many new small- and medium-sized firms is because 
of the market, the technology and our proximity to foreign trade." 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Levy said, California's link to the Pacific Rim, which he called 
the world's fastest-growing trade and investment corridor, would produce jobs 
ranging from ports and airports to banks and investment firms. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, California aerospace jobs shrunk by 16,239, from 161,734 in 1988 
to 145,495 in 1989. All five of the state's top aerospace employers in The 
Times survey cut their work forces last year, including a loss of 6,460 
California jobs at Lockheed Corp. and 2,360 at Rockwell International. 
</P>
<P>
But employment in financial services grew by 4.6% last year, producing 6,214 
new jobs in California, while the services sector grew by 10.8%, with 12,445 
new California jobs. 
</P>
<P>
For the second year in a row, publicly traded computer companies led all 
industrial sectors in job growth. Those firms produced 29,000 new jobs 
worldwide, to 278,177 in 1989 from 249,115 in 1988, an increase of 11.7%. But 
that was lower than the previous year's rate of 18.9%. 
</P>
<P>
And much of the growth is replacing jobs lost during the industry's severe 
recession in the mid-1980s, Hensley said. The net number of computer industry 
jobs in California grew by only 2.9% from 1985 to 1989, while the number of 
electronics components jobs actually declined by 2,000, or 1.3%, during that 
same period, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"High-tech is not producing many new jobs at all," Hensley said. "I think that 
sector is better characterized by rapid growth in output and productivity 
gains, so they don't need to hire people." 
</P>
<P>
Quantum Corp., a disk-drive maker in the Bay Area, confirms -- and contradicts 
-- that observation. It began manufacturing advanced disk drives in its 
Milpitas plant in March -- but hired no new assemblers, choosing instead to 
automate with 11 robots. However, the firm's overall staff grew by nearly 40% 
last year with the addition of highly skilled workers: 75 engineers, 30 
marketing representatives, 25 finance and administration personnel, and 70 
skilled manufacturing workers, said Joe Rodgers, Quantum's executive vice 
president of finance. 
</P>
<P>
California's largest computer-related employers are slowing their hiring, 
according to The Times survey. 
</P>
<P>
Apple Computer Co. reduced its staff by 1,200 last year, after a cut of 228 
jobs in 1988. Although Hewlett-Packard Co. added 1,000 workers last year, 
spokeswoman Joan Tharp said the firm "severely restricted" its hiring in 
mid-1989 and expects those hiring controls to remain in place this year. 
Advanced Micro Devices replaced none of the 1,000 jobs it cut in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The state Employment Development Department projects that service jobs -- 
especially in health, law and software -- should grow the most rapidly between 
1985 and 1995. In total jobs, nurses will lead the demand with 67,110 new 
positions, followed by accountants and auditors at 47,940. 
</P>
<P>
The top five occupations expected to show the fastest rate of growth are 
paralegals, computer programmers, data processing equipment repairers, lawyers 
and computer programmer aides, according to an EDD study. 
</P>
<P>
The Times survey reported a 5.2% reduction in jobs among 25 publicly traded 
health services firms last year, mainly because of cuts at a few of 
California's largest companies. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those jobs weren't actually lost, however. Rather, they were shifted to 
other health-care providers who might not have met The Times' 100 survey 
criteria of being publicly traded firms with headquarters in California. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Beverly Enterprises, the nation's largest nursing home operator 
based in Pasadena, showed a decline of 12,334 jobs between 1988 and 1989. 
Spokesman Bill Ihle said, however, that Beverly didn't lay off workers. It sold 
several facilities to firms outside the state. Thus, the jobs still exist but 
aren't recorded in the survey. 
</P>
<P>
Another study by the UCLA Business Forecasting Project showed that the total 
number of health-service jobs in California increased by 3.5% in 1989.

DIGGING FOR DATA: HOW IT ALL CAME TOGETHER; 
</P>
<P>
RESEARCHERS PORED OVER INFORMATION ON 830 CALIFORNIA COMPANIES TO UNCOVER THOSE 
THAT MET CRITERIA SET BY THE TIMES AND MZ GROUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This third annual edition of The Times 100 is designed to provide a systematic 
look into the dynamics of California business by ranking the performance of 
companies headquartered in the state. 
</P>
<P>
The information was collected and analyzed by MZ Group, a business analysis and 
database publishing firm in San Francisco (415-543-8290) headed by Mansoor 
Zakaria and Kevin Colosimo. MZ's research was coordinated by Helen Arrick. 
</P>
<P>
MZ Group gathered information on 830 California-based companies whose stock is 
publicly traded, relying on databases, corporate and government reports, a mail 
survey and direct telephone contact with company representatives. Certain 
historical and other selected data were provided by Standard &amp; Poor's 
Compustat, Warner Computer Systems and IDD Information Services. 
</P>
<P>
The tables generated by MZ were reviewed closely by Times editors and 
reporters. Criteria for the rankings were developed by The Times and MZ Group. 
</P>
<P>
MZ Group used financial data as reported at a company's fiscal year-end for 
years 1987, 1988 and, if available, 1989. If 1989 fiscal year-end data had not 
been reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the most recently 
reported four quarters were used. (The Exceptions table on Page 46 lists 
companies for which this applies). 
</P>
<P>
If a company's fiscal year ends between January and May, its financial results 
are reported for the previous calendar year. For example, the financial data 
for a company completing its fiscal year in February, 1990, will be reported as 
1989 results. 
</P>
<P>
Financial data from 1988 and 1987 has not been restated for acquisitions and/or 
discontinued operations. This allows the reader to see actual historical growth 
for the company, whether from internal growth or through acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
A few companies have majority-owned subsidiaries that are traded as separate 
entities. The financial results for these subsidiaries are presented 
independently as well as on a consolidated basis in the accounts of the parent 
companies. This applies to: Caesars World (parent) and Caesars New Jersey; 
Unocal (managing general partner) and Union Exploration Partners; ICN 
Pharmaceuticals (parent) and SPI Pharmaceuticals; ICN Biomedical (parent) and 
Viratek. 
</P>
<P>
Two California-based companies included in this supplement are majority owned 
by firms outside California but are traded as separate entities. Union Bank is 
80% owned by Bank of Tokyo, and National Health Laboratories is 95% owned by 
Revlon Group. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
General Criteria 
</P>
<P>
All companies must be publicly traded on the New York or American stock 
exchange or the NASDAQ system or over the counter and have their headquarters 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
Income is defined as after-tax income from continuing operations and excludes 
extraordinary items and gains or losses from discontinued operations. 
</P>
<P>
Sales excludes excise taxes, extraordinary income, revenue from discontinued 
operations and other income, such as interest. For banks and savings and loan 
associations, revenue equals the sum of interest and non-interest income. For 
insurance firms, revenue equals the sum of earned premiums, realized gains or 
losses from investments and net investment income. For all charts except the 
stock market performance charts, companies must have had at least $50 million 
in 1989 sales. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Section Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Bottom Line -- Return on equity measures the profit that a company earns 
for every dollar common stockholders have invested in the firm. Return on 
equity is defined as income available to common shareholders divided by average 
common shareholder equity. Income available to common shareholders is 
calculated by subtracting preferred dividends (if any) from income from 
continuing operations. The Times 100 table ranks companies by the average 
return on common equity for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
For The Times 100 table, companies must have met the following criteria: 
publicly traded since December, 1987; sales in 1989 greater than $50 million; a 
profit from continuing operations in 1989 and 1988; no negative common equity 
for each of the past three fiscal years and not more than twice as much 
long-term debt as total shareholder equity. 
</P>
<P>
Companies in the Top 25 and Bottom 25 in Absolute Profits must have been 
publicly traded in 1989. Just as the Top 25 in Absolute Profits ranks companies 
by dollar amount of profits from continuing operations, the Bottom 25 ranks 
companies by dollar amount of loss. 
</P>
<P>
The Top 25 Banks and S&amp;Ls table shows return on assets, which measures the 
percentage profit for every dollar in assets. Companies must have been publicly 
traded in 1989, with total assets exceeding $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The Top 25 in Profit Margins provides the percentage profit for every dollar in 
sales. Companies must have been publicly traded in 1989, with total sales 
exceeding $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Born Again table shows companies that have had the greatest turnaround from 
a loss in 1988 to a profit in 1989. The Nose Dives table lists firms that have 
suffered the greatest setback from a profit in 1988 to a loss in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
As with the other charts shown in the study, results for previous years have 
not been restated. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate investment trusts and limited partnerships were not eligible for 
inclusion in this section because income for these companies, which is not 
taxed at the company level, is not comparable to after-tax income for 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants -- The Sales 100 table ranks companies by net revenue. For banks and 
savings and loan associations, revenue equals the sum of interest and 
non-interest income. 
</P>
<P>
The Biggest Service companies table ranks service companies by net revenue. 
Service companies include entertainment, leisure, media, retail, utility, 
transportation, wholesale, business and personal service, investment, real 
estate and insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
View From the Street -- Market value is a company's stock price times the 
number of outstanding shares and generally reflects the esteem in which 
investors hold a company's stock and the confidence that they have in its 
future. Book value is total stockholder equity, or assets minus liabilities. 
Book value is shown as of the latest fiscal year-end or, if not available, the 
most recently reported quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Companies on the Favorites and Forlorn tables must have had 1989 sales of at 
least $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
For the Charging Ahead and Falling Behind tables, a company's stock price on 
April 10, 1989, must have exceeded $2. Stock prices as of April 10, 1988, have 
been adjusted to reflect stock splits and stock dividends. 
</P>
<P>
For the Lowest-Priced and Highest-Priced Companies tables, a firm's market 
value on April 10, 1990, must have exceeded $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Divvying It Up list of dividend yields ranks companies on the ratio of 
their current indicated annual dividend to their stock price as of April 10, 
1990. In most cases, this figure is the latest quarterly dividend multiplied by 
four. There is no guarantee that the same amount of cash dividend will be 
declared for subsequent quarters this fiscal year or that a dividend will be 
declared every quarter. The list excludes real estate investment trusts and 
master limited partnerships because their dividends often include a return of 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
The Top Performing IPOs table ranks companies that had their initial public 
common stock offering in 1989 by the stock price appreciation between the 
initial offering date and April 10, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Growth -- Sales growth can come either by generating new business or acquiring 
other firms. To be included on The Sales 100 table, a company must have been 
publicly traded since 1987, with 1987 sales exceeding $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
Companies eligible for the Fastest Profit Growth table must have been publicly 
traded and shown a profit from continuing operations for the past three years. 
1987 income from continuing operations must have been at least $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Human Factor -- California-headquartered companies are ranked by the number 
of full- and part-time employees worldwide at fiscal year-end, excluding 
consultants and contractors. Employment figures are estimates provided by the 
company. If fiscal year-end results were not available, employee estimates are 
from the latest completed quarter. The table does not include companies that 
are large employers in the state but are not headquartered here. 
</P>
<P>
The Most Productive Employees list ranks only the top companies in each sector 
by revenue per employee worldwide, but the group average is computed from 
figures on all the companies in the industry that were surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
Hiring trend data was obtained from the companies. Companies used the following 
guideline when responding to the question: "What is your hiring outlook for the 
upcoming 12 months?": increasing (up more than 5%), neutral (between 5% up or 
down), reducing (down more than 5%). 
</P>
<P>
Regional Profiles -- Same criteria used for the main tables. 
</P>
<P>
Who, What, Where -- All companies on The Times 100 profitability and Sales 100 
tables are profiled and listed alphabetically. 
</P>
<P>
EXCEPTIONS 
</P>
<P>
Lists companies whose fiscal year does not coincide with the calendar year or 
those whose fiscal year-end 1989 data was not available when data was compiled. 
In all tables in which these companies are listed, data was derived from the 
four quarters ending in the month shown and is compared to the 1988 fiscal 
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
American Medical International -- The bulk of AMI's stock was acquired by an 
investors group that included First Boston Corp., AMI Chairman Harry J. Gray 
and Mel Klein &amp; Partners in October, 1989. A few shares continued to trade 
until April 13, 1990, when all shares were tendered to the investors and the 
deal was completed. 
</P>
<P>
Ashton-Tate -- During the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 1989, Ashton-Tate changed 
its fiscal year-end from Jan. 31 to Dec. 31. The current results are for 
calendar 1989. 
</P>
<P>
BankAmerica -- Richard Rosenberg will take over as chief executive from A. W. 
(Tom) Clausen on May 24. 
</P>
<P>
Broad -- On Jan. 27, 1989, Broad changed its fiscal year-end from Nov. 30 to 
Sept. 30. Financial results are for the 10 months ended Nov. 30, 1989, and Nov. 
30, 1988, respectively, and have not been restated for the corporate 
restructuring that took place in March, 1989, when Kaufman &amp; Broad Inc. 
separated its financial services and housing businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron -- 1989 earnings were affected by a $1.2-billion charge pertaining to 
asset writedowns and writeoffs, environmental provisions and other charges that 
was not treated as an extraordinary item. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper -- Financial results for calendar 1989 reflect the results of an 
extensive restructuring program in which Cooper Cos. disposed of a number of 
its businesses. Prior-year results have not been restated to reflect the 
restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
Daisy Systems -- Its 1989 results reflect special charges related to the 
acquisition of Cadnetix Corp. in May, 1989. The charges were not treated as 
extraordinary in the company's financial statements. As of April 1, 1990, the 
company moved its headquarters from Mountain View to Boulder, Colo. Because the 
move occurred after the fiscal year, the company has been included in The Times 
100 survey. 
</P>
<P>
Di Giorgio -- The San Francisco firm was acquired by DIG Acquisition Corp. of 
New Jersey on Feb. 28, 1990, and will not publish year-end results. It has been 
excluded from the Times survey this year. 
</P>
<P>
Fireman's Fund -- The insurer's parent name was changed to Fund American Cos. 
and it has been excluded from the analysis because its headquarters are in 
Greenwich, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate Bancorp -- Edward M. Carson will take over as chief executive 
from Joseph Pinola on June 1. 
</P>

COMEBACK ROAD BUMPY FOR WILDE; 
</P>
<P>
INTERNATIONAL VOLLEYBALL: THE SETTER IS INCONSISTENT AS THE UNITED STATES AGAIN 
LOSES TO FRANCE IN FIVE GAMES.

Rod Wilde, setter on the United States national volleyball team, had a 
bittersweet feeling when the U.S. team won the gold medal at the 1984 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Wilde was set to compete on the Olympic team until he was sidelined because of 
a leg injury two months before the Games at Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I had made the final cut for the Olympics and trained with them for 2 1/2 
years," Wilde said. "But we were playing in the Soviet Union two months prior 
to the Olympics, and one of the Soviet players came under the net and I landed 
on him and broke my leg." 
</P>
<P>
Crushed, Wilde considered not attended the Games, because he wasn't sure if he 
was emotionally ready to handle it. But he decided to attend because he thought 
it was his last chance to attend the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Still in a walking cast, Wilde stood near the victory stand when the U.S. team 
received its gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a despair type feeling," Wilde said. "It was a tough situation to be 
there and not be receiving the medal." 
</P>
<P>
Wilde retired after the 1984 Games and became the women's volleyball coach at 
Drake University. He moved to Pepperdine two years later, replacing Marv Dunphy 
as interim coach when Dunphy was named to coach the national team. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves flourished under Wilde, winning the NCAA title in 1986 and finishing 
third in the 1987 NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
When Dunphy returned after leading the United States to a gold medal in the 
1988 Olympics, Wilde considered playing in Italy, where club teams are luring 
Americans with lucrative contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Wilde, 33, rejoined the national team instead last November after Jeff Stork, 
starting setter for the national team, signed with an Italian team. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a commitment to the team through 1992, and they're going to have to 
throw me out to get rid of me," Wilde said. "I came back to go to the Olympics 
and fulfill my dream." 
</P>
<P>
Wilde's dream is a long way from reality. 
</P>
<P>
Rebuilding, the United States has struggled while losing the first two matches 
of the World Volleyball League season to France. After defeating the United 
States in five games Sunday, France won Monday's rematch, 16-14, 3-15, 5-15, 
15-9, 16-14, before 2,236 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Wilde hit the ball into the net on the final point. 
</P>
<P>
"Rod's kind of a comeback player," said Bill Neville, U.S. coach. "He's had 
great matches and unsteady matches. Tonight he was unsteady." 
</P>
<P>
The United States lost middle blocker Scott Fortune with a foot injury in the 
fourth game and seemed to lose its poise after that.

<P>
During his brief life, 19-year-old Jeremy Prows Miller of La Habra established 
a legal landmark and painted landscapes. Both were difficult feats. 
</P>
<P>
The landmark came in 1978 when Jeremy's parents used a federal law to win him 
the right to attend regular school classes even though he had been a 
quadriplegic since being struck by a car when he was 3. He was the first in 
California to use the law, which requires "least restrictive access" for the 
handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
The landscapes were the paintings and drawings he laboriously made, holding 
pens and brushes between his teeth. His paintings lined the hallway of the 
Fullerton church on Monday where a crowd of about 350, many of them former 
classmates at Sonora High School, attended his funeral. "It was hard for him to 
do it, but he loved art," said his mother, Ella Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy died Friday at Friendly Hills Regional Medical Center in La Habra after 
he had been found unconscious by his parents on Tuesday at their home. The hose 
to his respirator had become disconnected as he slept, and the emergency alarm 
failed to sound, his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
For 16 years before his death, Jeremy had been unable to use his arms and legs. 
He breathed with the help of a battery-powered respirator he carried with him 
in his wheelchair. He had been hit by a car as he ran across the street near 
his home in 1974, when he was a toddler. The injuries almost killed him and 
severely damaged his spinal cord. 
</P>
<P>
But those who recalled the young man on Monday, during the funeral at the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Stake Center, said Jeremy laughed a 
lot, joked and loved to follow sports, especially the California Angels. 
</P>
<P>
"Things were never dull with Jeremy," said Bishop F. Chet Nelson, who conducted 
the services. 
</P>
<P>
Said his father: "One of his crowning achievements, and one he was very proud 
of, was achieving the rank of Eagle Scout. . . . Whenever he set his mind to 
something, he never wavered." 
</P>
<P>
His father added that Jeremy's battle to lead as normal a life as possible had 
led to many accomplishments, including the court ruling in March, 1978, that 
ordered La Habra City School District to allow the boy to continue regular 
classes with his first-grade schoolmates. 
</P>
<P>
He had been removed from the regular first-grade class and moved to a library 
in February, 1978. Officials at Las Lomas School said Jeremy once had a 
breathing difficulty during class, which alarmed them. La Habra school district 
officials said he would be better off out of the regular classroom. 
</P>
<P>
But the child and his parents disagreed. Ella and Glenn Miller successfully 
argued that their son needed to be in a normal classroom so he could develop 
normally both socially and intellectually. His case was handled by the Los 
Angeles-based Western Law Center for the Handicapped, which on Monday praised 
Jeremy as a trailblazer in legal efforts for better treatment of the 
handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
"This young man was a pioneer and a role model for students with disabilities 
in California," said Sande Buhai Pond, legal director of the center. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy's accomplishments more than proved the merit of his being allowed to 
continue as a regular student, according to those who spoke about him at the 
funeral. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Dan Jongeward, Jeremy's first scoutmaster, said: "He was an 
amazingly normal boy. He went everywhere with us in scouting, and you tended to 
forget he was in a wheelchair. He could do everything with that wheelchair, 
even though he could only move it by using his chin." 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Wronka, an assistant principal at Sonora High School, told the funeral 
audience, "Jer just wanted to be a normal student. . . . He was optimistic, 
compassionate and humorous." 
</P>
<P>
Wronka added that Jeremy's "greatest love and interest centered around art." 
She recalled visiting him during one of his art classes and seeing him avidly 
at work, using his teeth to move a paintbrush over the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
The assistant principal noted that Jeremy graduated last June from Sonora High 
after achieving many honors there, including being on the principal's honor 
roll and named a student of the month. "The senior class cheered as he received 
his diploma," Wronka recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in a solemn closing to her remembrances, Wronka said, "Thank you, Jeremy. 
. . . Understanding and determination were part of your big heart." 
</P>
<P>
His artworks ranged from a black-and-white drawing of a house during winter to 
boldly colored portraits of parrots and cardinals. A large commercial firm used 
two of his artworks as Christmas cards, his father said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have his artwork here today because we believe his art will be lasting," 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his parents, survivors include three brothers and a sister. 
Burial on Monday was at the Loma Vista Memorial Park in Fullerton.

<P>
Before Frank H. Reed was taken hostage in 1986, he enjoyed a happy life in 
Muslim West Beirut even as Lebanon's civil war raged all around him. 
</P>
<P>
The director of a private elementary school, Reed, then 53, was a sociable 
golfer who made superb chili and enjoyed entertaining, according to friends and 
relatives. He and his wife, Fahima, nicknamed Fifi, a 3rd-grade teacher at the 
same school, lived in a rooftop apartment and enjoyed the services of a cook 
and a driver. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the kidnaping, their only son, Tarek, had turned 5, and the 
Reeds were talking about having a second child. 
</P>
<P>
"He loved the climate and the people," David Reed, a Baltimore businessman, 
said of his uncle. "He was able to use his talents. . . . There was a lot of 
opportunity for him to advance his career." 
</P>
<P>
Edward Reed, Frank's older brother by 13 years, described Frank as a "rather 
happy-go-lucky kind of man. . . . He's the type of fellow who liked to take 
some chances." 
</P>
<P>
That carefree spirit and love of adventure is what got him into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1986, Reed temporarily left his family in the Muslim quarter 
and moved to mostly Christian East Beirut, where there was less hostility 
toward Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Fifi Reed, 39, said in a recent interview that she repeatedly warned her 
husband that there would be trouble if he ventured back to their apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"But he had so many Lebanese friends," she said. "He thought nobody would hurt 
him." 
</P>
<P>
So, for part of the summer of 1986, Reed moved back to the Muslim quarter. He 
told his wife that they should think about returning to the United States, but 
for the time being he wasn't worried. No American had been taken hostage for 
more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on the warm afternoon of Sept. 6, 1986, Reed was on his way to play golf 
at a country club when two gunmen intercepted his car. They pulled him and his 
Lebanese driver into their car and sped away. The driver was released and told 
Reed's wife of her husband's abduction. 
</P>
<P>
A caller to a Western news agency claimed responsibility for the kidnaping, 
asserting that Reed was a CIA spy. His family denies that claim and insists 
that Reed had no interest in politics. 
</P>
<P>
Reed was born Dec. 3, 1932, in the Boston suburb of Malden, where his father, 
Frank Reed Sr., owned a leather goods store and his mother taught elementary 
school. The young Reed was the only one among a set of triplets to survive 
birth. 
</P>
<P>
Reed followed older brother Edward through Malden public schools and then 
attended the University of Maine and Northeastern University in Boston, where 
he earned degrees in education. He settled in Medford, Mass., but later moved 
with his then-wife, Nancy, and their two daughters to nearby Whitefield, N.H., 
where he was a school principal. 
</P>
<P>
His wanderlust kept him traveling -- to the North Pole, the Brazilian jungles 
and the Australian Outback. In Whitefield, he founded the Admiral Byrd Polar 
Club, which sponsored expeditions to Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
After his first marriage broke up, Reed left the Boston area. In 1977 he moved 
to the Middle East, where he initially traveled extensively. In letters to his 
family, in Massachusetts, he said his mission was to bring new teaching 
techniques to the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to train Arab children about the Western way of life," said Edward 
Reed. 
</P>
<P>
During an educators' training course in Beirut, he met Fahima Dalati, a small, 
cheery Syrian woman known as Fifi, who was 18 years younger than he. Despite 
her parents' objections, they were married in 1980; Reed, a Methodist, 
converted to the Muslim faith. 
</P>
<P>
He worked for Beirut International College until it was destroyed in a bombing. 
He then founded and directed the Lebanese International School, an elementary 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Initially estranged from his two daughters, he began corresponding with one of 
them, Marilyn Langston. He and Fifi even traveled to Massachusetts during 
vacations. 
</P>
<P>
"He did come over several times," said Marilyn Langston, 33, who has two 
children of her own. She said she and her father developed a "warm 
relationship." 
</P>
<P>
After the kidnaping, Reed's relatives grew particularly concerned for his 
safety in May, 1988, when Jean-Paul Kauffmann, a French hostage who had been 
freed, told Fifi Reed of sharing a cell with her husband. He reportedly said 
Reed had been beaten, possibly because he had tried to escape. 
</P>
<P>
Kauffmann told French television Monday that in captivity Reed "did not move 
and did not read. He was in a kind of transcendental meditation. He wanted to 
be left in peace, but he picked up in the last weeks we were together. . . . We 
became friends." 
</P>
<P>
Kauffmann told Fifi Reed that her husband had repeated one phrase over and 
over: "Avec de la patience, on arrive a tout" ("With patience, you can achieve 
anything."). 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only French he knew, but he used to say it to me all the time 
whenever there was a difficulty to overcome," she said. 
</P>
<P>
After roughly 43 months in captivity, Reed, now 57, seems to have endured his 
ordeal and achieved what his frail, 91-year-old mother Leota Reed Sprague had 
so patiently prayed for. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, Sprague told her granddaughter that the only thing keeping 
her alive was the hope that, some day, she would see her son again. Now, the 
reunion appears to be only a few days away.
