Most of Laurel Canyon Park off Mulholland Drive is now reserved for dogs, and 
visiting humans have all the status of a fire hydrant. 
</P>
<P>
While the Humane Society was holding a press conference there Thursday, a 
canine crept up behind KABC (Channel 7) newsman Gene Gleeson, lifted up its leg 
and sprayed him. 
</P>
<P>
KNX radio reporter Diane Thompson, who was nearby, said she avoided the line of 
fire because "I was keeping an eye on the dog." 
</P>
<P>
Gleeson laughed off the incident, pointing out that the pooch missed most of 
his leg. (Fortunately, TV reporters are generally seen from the waist up.) 
</P>
<P>
And the impudent beast's owner? He or she never came forward. 
</P>
<P>
How fierce is the competition in the real estate industry since the boom turned 
into a bust? A publicist phoned to say that his client, a Beverly Hills real 
estate agent, has taken to laminating his business cards so that he can pass 
them out to bathers at the Beverly Hills Hotel swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
Sad. 
</P>
<P>
Florida's lack of originality apparently knows no bounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Sunshine State, as you know, has built imitations of Disneyland, the 
Hollywood Walk of Fame, the Brown Derby and the Universal Studio Tour. 
Recently, claiming to have discovered Medflies, it began a malathion-spraying 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the topper: Federal prosecutors are now investigating the Miami Beach 
mayor's dealings with a banker -- even before the end of the federal 
investigation of our own Mayor Bradley's dealings with various financial 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt Florida will soon have its own Malathion Poetry Contest, too. In the 
meantime, Only in L.A.'s panel of distinguished judges gave this week's award 
to Jeff Williamson of Sherman Oaks, who doused us with the following: 
</P>
<P>
There must be citizens who feel 
</P>
<P>
 It's time to change the City Seal: 
</P>
<P>
 Let's add two Medflies to the rim 
</P>
<P>
 (The female making eyes at him!). 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson, who also submitted the seal, says the phrase at the bottom is "an 
old heraldic way of saying, 'Enough already, no more spraying.' " 
</P>
<P>
Great Inventions That Never Quite Caught On: 
</P>
<P>
Fifty years ago, long before the advent of electronic turn signals for cars, 
Westways magazine reported the development of a product called Arm-A-Lite. 
</P>
<P>
It was a device that fit into the corner of the driver's window. The inventor's 
idea, Westways said, was that when the driver made an arm signal to turn, his 
arm would automatically hit a light switch. Then, a light would throw "a beam 
on his arm, making it visible." 
</P>
<P>
More evidence that the safe-sex campaign is gaining followers: 
</P>
<P>
A woman's purse was stolen while she was paying for gasoline in Glassell Park. 
The purse was found a week later on the roof of a neighboring McDonald's. The 
only thing missing was a pack of condoms.

Remember the days when vandalism of bus benches amounted to an occasional

ANGELS: FINLEY THROWS AWAY BUNT IN MARINERS' SEVEN-RUN FOURTH AND SEATTLE GOES 
ON TO SCORE A 10-8 VICTORY.

Everything seemed in place for the Angels Thursday night. They had what they 
always seem to be wanting -- a leadoff man and a lead. 
</P>
<P>
They had Luis Polonia batting first, in his first start as an Angel. They 
scored their first two runs on no hits, and led by four before the Mariners 
batted a second time. 
</P>
<P>
And on the mound they had Chuck Finley, the left-hander with a 0.96 earned-run 
average. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels seemed on their way to their third victory in a row. Instead, they 
found themselves without one of the few things that seemed certain -- a steady 
outing by Finley, who fell apart in the Angels' 10-8 loss to Seattle in front 
of 12,279 in the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll take full responsibility for the loss," said Finley, who fell to 3-2. 
"The guys busted their . . . for me. They spotted me four runs. I'm not going 
to sit and make excuses. I stunk. I feel bad." 
</P>
<P>
Three more Angel errors -- raising their total to 19 -- played a large part in 
the loss. One of them belonged to Finley, and it was the one that did him in. 
</P>
<P>
He took a 6-3 lead into the Mariners' half of the fourth. But he left without 
getting the first out of an inning that became a seven-run barrage, topped by 
Jeff Leonard's second 400-foot homer of the game, a three-run shot off Scott 
Bailes. 
</P>
<P>
Finley walked the first two batters in the fourth, then gave up a run-scoring 
single to Dave Valle. With runners on first and second, Mike Brumley bunted. 
Finley fielded the ball within a few feet of the third-base line, but his throw 
to first sailed past first baseman Wally Joyner. Darnell Coles and Valle raced 
around the bases, Valle scoring ahead of Dante Bichette's throw. 
</P>
<P>
That tied the score, 6-6, and Bailes relieved Finley, who eventually was 
charged with seven runs, four of them earned. 
</P>
<P>
Brumley, who had gone to second on Finley's error, was sacrificed to third by 
Harold Reynolds, and scored when shortstop Donnie Hill was charged with an 
error on Henry Cotto's grounder. Bailes walked Ken Griffey Jr., bringing up 
Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
"He kind of got me out of my game," said Bailes, saying that Leonard's first 
home-run trot and his stalling had irritated him. "He stands a lot, too." 
</P>
<P>
Leonard took a ball, and then sent a high fastball into the left-field stands, 
a three-run homer that gave him two in a game for the seventh time in his 
career, and tied his career-high of five RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"I go out and try to pitch like Nolan Ryan, and he does the same thing to me," 
Bailes said. 
</P>
<P>
Bailes went four innings, giving up three runs, two of them earned, on three 
hits. Together, he and Finley walked six batters, three each, and Seattle's six 
pitchers walked seven. 
</P>
<P>
Finley's shining earned-run average of 0.96 took on a decided tarnish, soaring 
to 2.03. His record fell to 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
He had not given up a home run all season, until Leonard's shot in the third 
inning, which was estimated to have traveled 435 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the team, Finley had not traveled overnight from Baltimore for the game 
in Seattle, the first of six games the Angels must make up because of the 
lockout. Instead, he traveled Wednesday afternoon in order to be rested. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle starter Matt Young had the same option to travel from Boston, but chose 
to come with the team. 
</P>
<P>
The game began with the Mariners' starting pitcher struggling. The Angels 
scored two runs on Young without getting a hit, putting together two walks and 
two errors with a fielder's choice. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels scored two again in the second, when Hill's double drove in Johnny 
Ray, who had doubled, and Rick Schu, who singled. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners scored a run in the third when Darnell Coles doubled, driving in 
O'Brien, who had singled. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard's two-run homer in the third made it 4-3, but the Angels scored two 
more runs in fourth on two walks and Devon White's two-run single. 
</P>
<P>
Young left after three-plus innings, allowing six runs, four of them earned, on 
four hits. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Brent Knackert, the second of six Seattle pitchers, earned his first 
major league victory by giving up only one hit over two innings. Knackert, a 
product of Ocean View High in Huntington Beach, made his first major league 
appearance in front of his home fans at Anaheim Stadium last month. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels mounted a rally in the eighth inning. Jack Howell, batting for Schu, 
led off with a homer to right, his second. They added another run when Joyner's 
two-out single to right drove in Polonia, who had singled and stole second. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle ace Mike Schooler relieved, and Chili Davis' double to right put 
runners on second and third. But Bichette lined out to left to end the inning 
with the Angels still trailing, 10-8. 
</P>
<P>
Schooler picked up the save, his sixth, by retiring the Angels in order in the 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Polonia's play in his role as the man who has relieved White of pressure to 
lead off was the most encouraging aspect of the evening for the Angels, who 
finished their longest road trip of the season with a 5-8 record. 
</P>
<P>
Polonia started in left and went two for three. His repertoire included some 
quality leadoff plays: He walked to open the game and later scored, he 
sacrificed, and he stole a base. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time this year, I feel like I'm playing baseball," Polonia said. 
"Before with the Yankees, I didn't. I can't wait (to play the Yankees). I've 
got something for them. But I've got good control of myself." 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he did a very good job," Manager Doug Rader said. "I'm happy for 
Luis. He did a lot of things." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Seattle Fire Department was called to the Angels' hotel Thursday after an 
alarm was pulled in a hallway when smoke was detected outside a player's room. 
The player, whom neither the Angels nor the hotel would identify, had been 
burning some papers in a trash can. Bert Blyleven, the usual suspect, was not 
involved, an Angel spokesman said. "I heard the alarm and checked my room," 
said Blyleven, who has been known to set shoelaces on fire. "It wasn't me." 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Ray's second-inning double was the 21st game in a row in which the 
Angels have a double, equaling the team record. . . . Shortstop Dick Schofield 
ran at about 50% Thursday, and continues to take ground balls and batting 
practice. The Angels hope Schofield, recovering from a hamstring injury, will 
be ready for his first appearance of the season in 10 to 14 days.

BLOWERS, YANKEES AT A LOSS 
</P>

<P>
Mike Blowers of the New York Yankees might have been able to make sense of it 
if the balls hit toward him Thursday were line drives, choppers or perfectly 
executed drag bunts. 
</P>
<P>
But Blowers, a rookie, tied an American League record for errors by a third 
baseman when he failed to come up with four routine ground balls in the 
Yankees' 10-5 loss to the Cleveland Indians in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like I flubbed four hard-hit balls," Blowers said. "I'm still trying 
to figure out what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Blowers joined 20 other third basemen in the record book by committing two 
errors in the seventh inning, one in the eighth and one in the ninth. The last 
AL third baseman to commit four errors in a game was Floyd Rayford of the 
Baltimore Orioles in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
David Brain of the Boston Braves set the modern major league record for errors 
by a third baseman when he committed five in 1906. 
</P>
<P>
"I just couldn't find any kind of rhythm, couldn't get comfortable," Blowers 
said. "I guess it's just one of those days, one of those things." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of Blowers' errors, the Indians scored four unearned runs in the 
seventh, one in the eighth and two in the ninth to hand the Yankees their fifth 
consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
Blowers was acquired by the Yankees in August from the Montreal Expos in a 
trade for John Candelaria. He made four errors in 13 games with the Yankees 
last season and had only two errors this season before Thursday's game. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid just had a rough day," Yankee Manager Bucky Dent said. "I feel for 
him. I'm not going to rip him. We all make errors. He just made a bunch all at 
one time." 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Alomar drove in five runs on three hits, including a tie-breaking, 
two-run double in the eighth that gave the Indians a 7-5 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Orosco (1-1), the Indians' fourth pitcher, got the victory, and Doug 
Jones earned his eighth save. 
</P>
<P>
Yankee reliever Jeff Robinson (0-1), who gave up two runs on three hits in the 
seventh, took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 3, Detroit 1 -- The Tigers led the major leagues with 103 losses last 
season. They're on track to do the same this year. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Gaetti's two-run homer in the 10th inning at Detroit extended the Tigers' 
losing streak to five games and left them last in the East with an 8-15 record 
-- the same mark they had last season after 23 games. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Henneman (0-2) walked Kirby Puckett to lead off the 10th before Gaetti hit 
his fourth home run. Gaetti, who had two three-run homers Wednesday night, hit 
an 0-and-1 pitch from Henneman over the left-field wall. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Anderson gave up one run on six hits in eight innings before he was 
replaced by Terry Leach (2-0), who pitched a scoreless ninth for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Aguilera pitched the 10th and earned his fifth save. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 9, Kansas City 5 -- Robin Yount's three-run, inside-the-park homer at 
Kansas City paced the Brewers and dropped the Royals to 6-14, the worst record 
in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Yount, who has half the 12 inside-the-park homers in Brewers history, chased 
Mark Gubicza (1-4) with his homer in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Jamie Navarro (1-0) went five innings to earn the win. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Plesac earned his fourth save.

Jack Armstrong joined some elite company Thursday night at New York with 
another outstanding performance for the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, a right-hander who was the Reds' No. 1 draft choice in 1987, pitched 
7 2/3 innings and earned his fifth victory as the Reds beat the Mets, 5-0, for 
their eighth victory in 10 road games. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong (5-0), Mets' left-hander Frank Viola and Oakland right-hander Dave 
Stewart are the only five-game winners in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"I pitched pretty good I guess," said Armstrong, who allowed four hits, struck 
out three and walked one. "I didn't overpower anyone." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't have to against the error-prone Mets, who have lost five of their 
last six and committed 27 errors in 22 games. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Johnson made three errors, tying his club record for shortstops set on 
July 18, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Oliver keyed the Reds' offense with his first two home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Former Met Randy Myers pitched 2 1/3 innings for his fifth save. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 10, Philadelphia 3 -- Bill Gullickson pitched a strong game at 
Philadelphia as the Astros beat the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
Gullickson (2-1), who was signed as a free agent last December after he went 
21-14 in two seasons with the Yomiuri Giants in Japan, pitched 7 1/3 innings 
and surrendered six hits to the Phillies, who had 20 hits Wednesday night in a 
14-4 victory over the Astros. 
</P>
<P>
Gullickson struck out four, walked three and never trailed after Ken Caminiti 
hit a two-run single off Terry Mulholland (1-1) in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
Caminiti had three runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Len Dykstra had four hits and Carmelo Martinez hit his third homer for the 
Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 4, Montreal 1 -- The Braves scored three runs in the ninth at Montreal 
and extended their winning streak to five games. 
</P>
<P>
Left-hander Tom Glavine pitched seven innings, giving up only a bunt single to 
Otis Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Kerfeld (2-1) pitched a scoreless eighth to earn the victory. Joe 
Boever pitched the ninth for his second save. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd had his best game since joining the Expos as a free agent 
last winter, giving up six hits and striking out five in six innings.

DAUGHERTY SCORES 34 AS CAVALIERS EVEN SERIES WITH 76ERS;

<P>
Anyone wondering why the Cleveland Cavaliers struggled early this season need 
only glance at Brad Daugherty's line in Thursday night's box score. 
</P>
<P>
Daugherty, who missed the first half of the season because of complications 
after foot surgery, was nearly perfect. He went 12 of 15 from the floor, 10 of 
12 from the free-throw line and scored a team playoff-record 34 points as the 
Cavaliers beat the Philadelphia 76ers, 108-96, tying their Eastern Conference 
quarterfinal series 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
The deciding game will be Saturday in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
"We shot the ball poorly, and Brad Daugherty had a career night," 
Philadelphia's Charles Barkley said. "We've got to do something to shut him 
down. We didn't double him tonight and he's too good not to double. We've got 
to go back to the drawing board." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland was counting on a strong playoff series from Daugherty, who appears 
to be hitting his stride after sitting out the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt like last year a little bit," Daugherty said. "The foot is really 
coming around. I'm starting to get my strength back in it. But I think I'm at a 
disadvantage, too, because I think I'm behind everybody else. I was in the 
hospital two months." 
</P>
<P>
Daugherty made 10 of his first 11 shots from the field. Mark Price set a 
Cavalier playoff record with 18 assists. Daugherty also grabbed nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"He must have made four or five jump shots when we were helping pick up Price 
on the drive," Philadelphia Coach Jim Lynam said. "Daugherty had a great game." 
</P>
<P>
The two teams split their four regular-season games, each winning once at home 
and once on the road. Each has won its two home games in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers shut down the 76ers in the fourth quarter, outscoring them, 
22-14. The 76ers went scoreless from the field for seven minutes as Cleveland 
widened an 89-84 lead early in the quarter to 97-85 with five minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
Daugherty finished off the 8-1 flurry with a short hook shot and two free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
As has been the case in all four playoff games, the Cavaliers got off to a 
quick start, leading 34-23 after one quarter and 60-50 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland let two halftime leads slip away in Philadelphia, but made the next 
two stand up at home. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley scored 23 points and had 11 rebounds. Hawkins scored 22, but only two 
in the fourth quarter.

SUCCESS RELATIVE FOR DUO; 
</P>
<P>
TENNIS: MOORPARK COLLEGE'S MOTHER-AND-DAUGHTER COMBINATION MAKES FOR A WINNING 
SET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Watching Moorpark College's No. 1 doubles team play is sort of like seeing 
those old soap commercials -- look at their backhands and decide which player 
is the mother and which is the daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Their relationship isn't always apparent to opponents, but it quickly becomes 
clear the first time Elise Nakawatase looks at Patti Nakawatase and says, "Nice 
shot, Mom." 
</P>
<P>
This unlikely pairing of college freshmen, a 45-year-old mother and her 
18-year-old daughter, was as unexpected as it has been successful. 
</P>
<P>
Patti, who never had competed in school-based athletics, already was planning 
to take some classes at Moorpark when Elise asked her to join a tennis team 
badly in need of players. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't really realize what I got into," Patti said. 
</P>
<P>
Patti and Elise have been more than a novelty, winning seven of their 11 
doubles matches. In singles, Patti is 8-1 at No. 6, and Elise is 9-6 at No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Their doubles team is among those receiving a first-round bye for the Western 
State Conference tournament, which begins today and continues through Sunday at 
Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a little hectic and stressful, but I've enjoyed doing it," said 
Patti, who didn't go on to college after graduating from Venice High in 1962. 
"It's been fun to play with them. They're all so nice, but they hit so hard and 
never get tired." 
</P>
<P>
Patti and Elise had played together before, usually when Patti needed a 
substitute for her social matches, but Elise played parent-child tournaments 
with her father. As might be expected, mother and daughter have a certain 
kinship on the court. 
</P>
<P>
Elise's powerful strokes and speed complement Patti's doubles acumen. Playing 
in three club leagues as well as frequent doubles matches with friends has left 
Patti versed in the nuances of doubles play, recondite knowledge for college 
players accustomed to singles. 
</P>
<P>
"They play well together," Moorpark Coach Nancy Stewart said. "Patti knows the 
court real well. Elise is very athletic." 
</P>
<P>
Patti's specialties are poaches, lobs and off-speed shots, but Elise says her 
mother hits the ball hard enough that "I know I don't have to worry about 
getting the ball slammed in my face. 
</P>
<P>
"What I like is my mom can hold her own most of the time," Elise said. "I know 
they tend to pick on her more because she's the older one, but my mom pretty 
much shows them." 
</P>
<P>
Elise and Patti recently showed their moxie against WSC power Santa Barbara. 
After falling behind, 4-1, Nakawatase and Nakawatase battled back to win the 
first set, 7-6, and the match, 7-6 (7-5), 6-7 (6-8), 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good on the court with her because she'll hold up her end and sometimes 
mine," Patti said. "We get along better on the court than we do anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
"When we're on the court, we're partners, but anywhere else it's 
mother-daughter." 
</P>
<P>
The two are amicable on the court, with each other and their opponents. Their 
relaxed demeanor and easy friendliness are a departure from the days when Elise 
wouldn't let her mother watch her juniors matches because having Patti on the 
sidelines made her too nervous. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten closer now since we've been playing," Elise said. "We have more 
to talk about now. Before we didn't get along as well." 
</P>
<P>
This spring, Patti and Elise have metaphorically walked a mile in each other's 
Nikes. 
</P>
<P>
Elise now has to cook some meals for her father and younger brother because 
Patti has night classes, and Patti better appreciates Elise's life as a 
student. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's made us understand each other much better," Elise said. 
"Personality-wise I'd say we're about the same. Attitude-wise and study 
habit-wise we're different." 
</P>
<P>
"She's more organized. Me, I take it as it comes." 
</P>
<P>
The most difficult aspect of college athletics for Patti has been fitting all 
the time demands into her schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Patti juggles her 12-hour class load, which she needs to stay eligible for 
athletics, with a 15-hour-a-week job at a Westlake Village accounting firm and 
with keeping the family's Agoura Hills household humming. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, she has standing commitments for several matches a week in leagues 
and with friends. 
</P>
<P>
Too busy to practice with the team, Patti said she nonetheless feels 
comfortable on the squad. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a lot of fun," said Amy Perry, a member of Moorpark's No. 2 doubles 
team. On trips, "she always sits up front with the coach, and they usually talk 
the whole time. The other girls sit and gossip, and they talk 'mom-stuff.' " 
</P>
<P>
Cathleen Clark, another member of the No. 2 doubles team, admitted the players 
sometimes "have to watch what we say; we kind of whisper sometimes," but added, 
"She's just like one of the girls." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Patti has a different perspective on college athletics than the rest of the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Elise hopes to parlay her Moorpark experience into a spot on a four-year 
college team, but for Patti, the experience has been an end unto itself. 
</P>
<P>
Patti says she would have to quit her job to play next season, a sacrifice 
she's not eager to make. She's still concentrating on completing this season, 
which could last into mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
If Elise and Patti win their first WSC tournament match, they'll be in the 
final eight, which will automatically qualify them for the Southern California 
regional of the state tournament. 
</P>
<P>
If they do advance to regionals, which begin next Friday, they'll have to be 
considered dark-horse contenders. 
</P>
<P>
The last day of the regionals is, after all, Mother's Day.

UNDEFEATED SOUTH, WEST TORRANCE WANT CLEAR SKIES FOR SHOWDOWN; 
</P>
<P>
PREP SOFTBALL: OCEAN LEAGUE RIVALS HAVE HAD THREE GAMES RAINED OUT THIS SEASON. 
THEY WILL TRY AGAIN TODAY AND MONDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
With the Ocean League title on the line, how badly do the softball teams at 
South Torrance and West Torrance high schools want to play each other? 
</P>
<P>
Enough to stay out in the rain all day if they have to. 
</P>
<P>
The rivals, tied for first place with 10-0 records, had their first scheduled 
game rained out April 4. Two later games were also washed away. 
</P>
<P>
They actually made it into the third inning Monday at South before umpires, 
fearing injuries and heeding the calls of drenched parents and fans, called off 
the scoreless game. Despite a heavy downpour and chilly winds, players from 
both sides begged to have the game continue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to get any worse," pleaded one player whose spirit clearly 
wasn't dampened. "Let's keep going." 
</P>
<P>
"Come on, it's not raining that hard," said another. 
</P>
<P>
Once the game was called off, complaints were heard on both sides, although the 
fans let out grateful cheers before dashing for the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't care if it's raining or not. We just really want to play them," said 
West freshman designated hitter Nicole Hendrix, who is hitting .319 and leads 
the Warriors with two home runs. "We've been really up for them. 
</P>
<P>
"Monday, it was raining really hard, but we were feeling good." 
</P>
<P>
South junior shortstop Gillian Boxx said her team shares the excitement. She 
said she was nervous for the first time in her career before Monday's game 
because "they're such important games coming up. Everyone is waiting to see who 
is going to be in first place." 
</P>
<P>
The revised schedule has the two teams playing at West today and at South on 
Monday in 3 p.m. games. 
</P>
<P>
South and West played once early this season, in the Hawthorne Tournament. 
South won, 4-0, behind the pitching of sophomore Jacqueline Brown (9-1), but 
neither team attaches much significance to that meeting, since each was without 
key players who were still playing basketball or soccer. 
</P>
<P>
Brown will start Friday against Warrior senior Rosa Olloque (10-0), who has 
tossed shutouts in seven of her last eight games. Spartan senior Julie DeJaifre 
(2-1), who missed most of the season with a broken left foot, will start 
against Olloque on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The return of DeJaifre, South's lone senior, could be crucial down the stretch, 
second-year Coach Larry Lent said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a good one-two combination, and I always have a backup," said Lent, 
whose team is 13-2 overall. "West High has an excellent pitcher in Rosa, but 
they don't have a backup if something happens. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is some trouble, I won't hesitate to make a change. (West) doesn't 
have that luxury." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Spartans are confident coming into the crucial two-game series. 
After outscoring league opponents, 99-3, they have a right to be. Also, South 
has won two straight league crowns (Bay in 1988, Ocean in 1989) and features a 
two-time league MVP in Boxx. Five Spartans are hitting .378 or better, led by 
Boxx (.578, four home runs, 20 RBIs, 13 stole bases). 
</P>
<P>
West Coach Jim Carrico, who has guided the Warriors to a 13-4 overall mark, 
admits that South has a more dominant offense. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been playing pressure ball all year," he said. "We don't blow anybody 
away. 
</P>
<P>
"We win 1-0, 2-0. We beat Morningside 4-0, and everybody else had beaten them 
20-0." 
</P>
<P>
But Carrico -- who lost his best hitter, senior first baseman Jennifer Mills 
(.375), for the season with a broken right arm last month -- has three .300 
hitters in his lineup and says his team makes good contact. "But we haven't had 
the breaks," he said. "We've been hitting the ball right at people." 
</P>
<P>
Carrico went on to say that South doesn't give West the respect it deserves. 
</P>
<P>
"Our feeling is that they talk about how they're peaking and they're the team 
to beat," he said. "But I think it's great (because) it's inspiring." 
</P>
<P>
Some of his players have taken South's perceived cocky attitude more seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to beat us bad," said Hendrix, West's clean-up hitter. "And we want 
to beat them bad. 
</P>
<P>
"But they've been bringing bad things into it, and we just want a good, clean 
game. They're saying that now that (DeJaifre) is back that they're going to get 
us, and I don't think that's right. I guess she's supposed to be really hot 
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I didn't think she was that great. She is a good pitcher, but 
nothing we haven't faced against Redondo or (Mira) Costa." 
</P>
<P>
West shortstop Brigit Tapp, who is hitting .375 in the lead-off spot, added: 
"We're getting more eager to play (South). They say they're peaking and ready, 
but they haven't given us our respect. We're undefeated too. It'll just come 
down to who gets the breaks." 
</P>
<P>
Boxx, South's team leader for three years, said the Spartans also are getting 
tired of all the talk leading up to the showdown. "It does make you want to 
kind of just get it over with," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lent said it's understandable that tension is getting to players on both teams. 
"We're just all up-tight," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Lent thinks both teams will fare well in the Southern Section 3-A playoffs that 
start in less than two weeks. He also said that although Olloque is "hittable," 
she is an excellent pitcher, one of the best in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
For South, Boxx is especially important in critical games because of her 
experience on national traveling teams. She has a calming effect on the whole 
team, Lent said. 
</P>
<P>
"She never feels pressure, or at least she never shows it," he said. "There are 
times in critical situations where I'll turn to her and ask her what she 
thinks. 
</P>
<P>
"I can learn from her experiences and take some of the knowledge she has picked 
up from other coaches." 
</P>
<P>
Boxx said she accepts her role as a clutch player: "I know that a lot of times 
I have to be the one to drive in runs." 
</P>
<P>
She said she takes a simple approach to hitting. "I just try to keep the ball 
out of the air," she said. "If I hit a grounder or a line drive, I feel like 
I'm doing my job." 
</P>
<P>
Helping Boxx produce runs for the Spartans are freshman third baseman Nicole 
Odom (.418), junior catcher Deirdre Baker (.406), freshman designated hitter 
Rachel Bosma (.400) and junior first baseman Monica Emmrich (.378, 14 stolen 
bases). 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore left fielder Beth Tapp (.340), joins sister Brigit and Hendrix as 
West's offensive leaders. But, of course, big offensive production isn't the 
Warriors' forte. 
</P>
<P>
"Defense is our strength," Carrico said. "It's been keeping us in games all 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Olloque, who has a 0.22 ERA and averages less than two walks per game, 
recognizes that strength, the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
"Rosa throws strikes and makes them put it in play," Carrico said. "Don't get 
me wrong; she has over 100 strikeouts. But she doesn't have to be a big 
strikeout pitcher all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Carrico calls Brigit Tapp "the backbone of the defense," but he said senior 
catcher Mary Litzenberg is the true field general. "She's in charge out there," 
he said. "And Rosa and everyone else listen to what she says. 
</P>
<P>
"After working with me for a couple of years, she knows how I think and what I 
want." 
</P>
<P>
All West and South want this afternoon are are sunny skies, a dry field, 
respect and first place.

NEW COACH PUTS EL CAMINO IN THE SWIM FOR STATE MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Corey Stanbury, El Camino College's enthusiastic swimming and water polo coach, 
has proven that with enough dedication, any program can be upgraded in a short 
time. 
</P>
<P>
In only his second season as head coach, Stanbury has made contenders out of 
the once-ailing El Camino men's and women's swim teams. 
</P>
<P>
In last week's South Coast Conference meet at Golden West College, the El 
Camino men finished second and the women third. Seven Warriors -- two divers 
and five swimmers -- qualified for the state meet, which started Thursday at 
Mt. San Antonio College and ends Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Last season only one El Camino swimmer, Todd Douglas, and three divers 
qualified for the state meet. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas, an all-American last year, will compete in the 100- and 200-yard 
breaststroke and the 400-yard medley relay. Sophomore Dan Wilkinson qualified 
in the 500- and 1,650-yard freestyle, the 200 freestyle relay and the 400 
medley. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes High freshman Scott Peppard will compete in both relays and the 
50-yard freestyle. Freshman Bill Johnston will swim the last leg of the 200 
freestyle relay. 
</P>
<P>
The only woman swimmer to qualify is Nicole Standardi, a sophomore from Rolling 
Hills High. Her outstanding performances in the 50-, 100- and 200-yard 
freestyle have earned her spots in all three races at Mt. SAC this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're poised to do quite well," Stanbury said. I think both men and 
women can finish in the top 10." 
</P>
<P>
Stanbury is also confident in his two divers, freshmen Michelle Zimmer and Ed 
Bangaster. Both have qualified on the one- and three-meter boards. Zimmer is 
from North Torrance High, Bangaster from St. Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
Though it won't be official until after next week's Southern California 
Championships, it appears that El Camino is sending at least five athletes to 
Santa Barbara for the state track meet May 18-19. 
</P>
<P>
On the women's side, Sharette Garcia is a sure bet in the 800 and 1,500 meters 
unless unexpected injuries hamper her. The petite sophomore from Belize is the 
defending 800-meter state champion and the state runner-up at 1,500 meters. She 
was also on El Camino's championship 4 x 400 relay team last year. 
</P>
<P>
This season Garcia's marks in the 800 and 1,500 rank among the state's best. At 
last weekend's SCC meet she swept the 1,500 in 4:49.56 and the 800 in 2:16.68. 
</P>
<P>
Diana Tracy also had impressive performances at the conference meet in Walnut. 
The 37 year-old won both the 3,000 and the 5,000 meters. Her 17:27.00 mark in 
the 5,000 set a new league and school record. It's also a personal best for the 
freshman from Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of quality athletes," said El Camino assistant coach Dean 
Lofgren, "but unfortunately we don't have much depth." 
</P>
<P>
That mostly applies to the field events, though Tiesha Holmes leads Southern 
California in the long jump and triple jump. The freshman won both events at 
Mt. SAC with marks of 18 feet, 8 1/2 inches in the long jump and 37 1/2 feet in 
the triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
The El Camino men also have a pair of leapers who should qualify for the 
championships in Santa Barbara. Sophomores Ron Martin and Curtis Mitchell rank 
among the state's best in their events. Last week Martin broke the SCC long 
jump record with a leap of 25 feet, 1 inch. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell leads the state in the triple jump. He swept that event at the 
conference finals with a mark of 52 feet, 5 1/2 inches. Coach Bill Moreno says 
Mitchell is being highly recruited by top schools such as Louisiana State 
University and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
SCC track coaches couldn't decide on a conference athlete of the year when they 
met Wednesday, so they took the easy way out and picked four. Garcia, Tracy, 
Jakki Henderson and Crystal Irbing were named co-athletes of the year in the 
conference. Henderson is a sprinter at Mt. SAC, and Irbing is a sprinter at 
Long Beach City College. 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing new about Harbor College's baseball team making it to the 
playoffs, this year's club is even more impressive than usual. The Seahawks, 
41-5, have broken the school record for victories in a season. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, Harbor is in a weak league, but the Seahawks also have solid 
tournament victories over top-notch teams such as defending state champion 
Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, the Harbor players have managed to get pumped up for all 19 games 
they have played in the six-member Southern California Athletic Conference, 
despite the lack of competition. They finished league play 19-0. 
</P>
<P>
How much of a cakewalk has it been? Only one regular starter -- center fielder 
Mike Murphy -- played in Harbor's last conference game, against Barstow on 
April 26, and the Seahawks still won, 13-3. Coach Jim O'Brien, sure there was 
nothing to worry about, was at a coaches' meeting in San Francisco while his 
reserves nailed Barstow. 
</P>
<P>
The playoffs should provide more excitement for the confident Seahawks. 
Post-season action starts May 11 against a team yet to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
At the state championship tournament, scheduled May 25-27 at UC Irvine, Harbor 
looks as if it's equipped to improve on last year's third-place finish.

BENEFITS OF THE BIG TIME: LOYOLA TO PLAY IN MAUI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Loyola Marymount basketball hit the big time in the recent NCAA Tournament and 
is starting to reap some of the benefits, as evidenced by the Lions' invitation 
to a prestigious season-opening tournament next fall. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions will play in the eight-team Chaminade Maui Classic in Hawaii. And in 
a field that includes national powers Syracuse and Indiana, Loyola is being 
played up as one of the marquee names. 
</P>
<P>
"Loyola Marymount has been the Cinderella team this year, and I consider it a 
feather in our cap to have such an exciting team opening their season with us," 
said Chaminade Athletic Director Mike Vasconcellos. 
</P>
<P>
The Maui Classic, held in the Lahaina Civic Center, annually brings together a 
national field for the season-opening weekend. Missouri beat Oklahoma in last 
year's championship game, and eventual NCAA champ Michigan beat defending champ 
Kansas the year before. This year's games will be played Nov. 23-24-25, 
starting the day after Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
The field also includes Iowa State, Northeastern, host Chaminade and Loyola 
conference foe Santa Clara. Arkansas-Little Rock pulled out after Coach Mike 
Newell left and has been replaced by the University of Toledo. 
</P>
<P>
A television package is being worked out, and Vasconcellos said opening 
matchups should be set within a month -- with television having some input. (He 
said Loyola and Santa Clara won't be put in the same bracket.) TV has found the 
fast-breaking Lions to its liking the last two years, when Loyola set national 
scoring records in both seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Vasconcellos said another factor favored Loyola's selection. "We always have to 
have a Catholic school in the field," he said. "Us Catholic schools have to 
stick together." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Chaminade, a Catholic institution with an enrollment similar to 
Loyola's, is planning to upgrade its program to Division I and has made 
inquiries to the West Coast Conference about joining sometime in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
In playing host to the tournament, Chaminade has even pulled off some major 
upsets. "It's more of a spectacle than a tournament," Vasconcellos said. 
"There's golf, a luau. We provide the sun, the surf, and try to sneak up on 
somebody. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning and losing is almost incidental. It's really a cultural event. The 
players love it. It's a great way to start the season. It's like spring 
training -- the kids are fresh; they get to interact with the other teams. When 
(Coach) Rollie Massimino came out with Villanova, he set an all-time golf 
record for a basketball coach. And let's face it, if you're gonna lose, you 
might was well lose in Hawaii. It beats losing in North Dakota." 
</P>
<P>
Close Shave: It's been a banner year for Loyola Marymount women's tennis. In 
fact, one might say the Lions have been razor sharp. 
</P>
<P>
For 16 years, tennis Coach Jamie Sanchez has been telling his teams that if 
they could finish as high as third in the West Coast Conference, he would shave 
his beard and mustache. (He doesn't worry about finishing first because 
perennial winners Pepperdine and San Diego grant tennis scholarships. The other 
teams in the conference don't.) 
</P>
<P>
Well, the Lions finally placed third in the conference tournament two weeks 
ago, and Sanchez began getting calls from former players and alumni. "So I went 
ahead and (shaved)," Sanchez said, laughing. "Now everybody tells me I look 
younger, so it might be a benefit." 
</P>
<P>
The Lions' top gun was junior Lynn Stogner, who recently won the No. 1 singles 
title in the independent division at the Ojai Tournament. She lived up to her 
top seeding, winning all four matches and defeating UC San Diego's Kristine 
Bahrens in the final, 6-3, 7-6. Stogner was the Lions' top player despite a 
season-long wrist injury that was scheduled for surgery today. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez's Lions also won the doubles title at Ojai behind freshman Kim Florez 
and senior Jori Stinar, giving Loyola the team title in the Intercollegiate 
Independent category. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal State Dominguez Hills baseball team continues to struggle in the 
California Collegiate Athletic Conference, but third baseman Fred Camarena 
still has a chance to break the team batting record. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros, 17-21-2 overall, lost to UC Riverside, 5-0, earlier this week and 
take a 8-16 CCAA record into today's 3 p.m. home game against Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Camarena, however, hit in his 11th straight game against Riverside to raise his 
season average to .404. With eight games to play, Camarena is hoping to become 
the second Toro to hit .400, and is shooting for Ruben Jauregui's 1988 record 
of .406. 
</P>
<P>
Since dropping to his season low of .365 on April 7, the senior from Brea has 
steadily raised his average to its current mark. In his 11-game streak Camarena 
has hit .500 (19 for 38). 
</P>
<P>
Stat of the Week: When the Loyola Marymount baseball team was beaten by Long 
Beach State, 5-0, on Tuesday, it was the first time the Lions had been blanked 
this season and the first time in 107 games. The last team to shut out the 
Lions was Long Beach State in February, 1989.

NAIA DISTRICT 3 SOFTBALL TOURNAMENT; 
</P>
<P>
CAL LUTHERAN ARMED WITH STRONG PITCHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, TIME STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal Lutheran will rely on the one-two pitching punch of Dee Andra Pilkington 
and Leslie Stevens in seeking its third consecutive appearance in the National 
Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics softball finals. 
</P>
<P>
Pilkington (15-6, 1.04 earned-run average), a senior right-hander, and Stevens 
(12-4, 1.46 ERA), a junior right-hander, give Cal Lutheran an unusually deep 
and well-balanced staff. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one of the advantages we'll have going into this district (playoff) is 
that both pitchers' arms are not tired," Cal Lutheran Coach Tony Venditto said. 
"We can play back to back (or) we can play two or three games in one day and 
not hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
The Regals (29-10-2, 14-2 in district play) are making their sixth consecutive 
appearance in the District 3 championships, which begin today at Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
Pilkington, an All-American last season, will open the first game of the 
two-team, best-of-three series against Cal Baptist (23-22, 9-8) at 11 a.m. 
Stevens, who has won her past nine decisions, will pitch the second game, which 
will start 30 minutes after the completion of the first. Pilkington will return 
for a third game, if necessary, at 11 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens was named District 3 Player of the Week after going nine for 25 in six 
games last week. She is batting .328 this season. Pilkington, earlier named 
District Pitcher of the Week, and Stevens are the only two Cal Lutheran players 
to receive either district honor this season. 
</P>
<P>
The District 3 champion will travel to play the winner of District 7, probably 
either Western New Mexico State or Mesa State (Colo.), in a best-of-three 
bi-district tournament, May 10-11. The winner moves on to the 16-team 
nationals, May 17-19 at the University of West Florida in Pensacola. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran's past two trips to the nationals, a double-elimination 
tournament, ended quickly with consecutive losses both years, but first-year 
coach Venditto believes that past is not necessarily prologue for his 
14th-ranked Regals. 
</P>
<P>
"We have really what I call a three-step goal to win districts, to win 
bi-districts and go to nationals," said Venditto. "I honestly believe we can 
finish in the top four of nationals." 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran has won all four meetings with Cal Baptist. 
</P>
<P>
Kim White leads the team in 10 offensive categories, including batting average 
(.391). After playing center field and second base, White has moved to third 
base to replace Tina Bumgarner, the team leader in runs batted in (25) who 
suffered a season-ending knee injury.

GORDON, LIEBERTHAL TO SQUARE OFF IN BID TO SETTLE POWER STRUGGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Gordon of Simi Valley High and Westlake's Mike Lieberthal will go head to 
head today in their quests for the Southern Section single-season home run 
record when Westlake visits Simi Valley in a Marmonte League game. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon hit his 14th homer Wednesday, leaving him two shy of the record set by 
Arnold Garcia of Channel Islands in 1981. Lieberthal has been stuck at 13 since 
April 20. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia was a left-handed pull hitter whose home runs over the right-field fence 
at Channel Islands would be met by a chorus of moos. 
</P>
<P>
"There was an animal-husbandry class on the other side of the fence," recalled 
Don Cardinal, the Channel Islands coach. "We'd say he was taking them deep into 
the cows." 
</P>
<P>
Because Channel Islands is also in the Marmonte League, Cardinal has watched 
firsthand the assault on Garcia's record. 
</P>
<P>
"Arnold was a lot like Gordon and Lieberthal," he said. "Not a big kid, but he 
just had that stroke, and he worked real hard at his hitting." 
</P>
<P>
Although Gordon has hit more home runs recently, Lieberthal figures to have 
more games ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley (11-11, 4-6 in league play) finishes its league schedule Wednesday 
and is a long shot to make the playoffs. Westlake (23-1, 11-0) closes out 
league play today but is certain to be the top-seeded team in the 5-A Division 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Pitching rich: Few expected Saugus High to have strong pitching this season. 
</P>
<P>
Gone was Roger Salkeld, picked third in last June's amateur draft by the 
Seattle Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
Left behind were sophomores Chris Hernandez and David Weeg, and junior Doug 
Maggiora, who logged all of six innings last season. 
</P>
<P>
But a combined effort has carried the Centurions far. With a respectable team 
earned-run average of 3.49, Saugus (15-5-1 overall) is atop the Golden League 
standings with a 10-1 record and holds a three-game lead over second-place 
Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
The side-arming Maggiora, who routinely has entered games in the middle 
innings, has been most impressive. He has compiled an 8-1 record with four 
saves and a 2.59 ERA in 67 1/3 innings -- most in the Valley area. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez (5-2, 4.20), a left-hander, and Weeg (2-0, 3.29), a right-hander, 
have held their own at the varsity level and show a lot of promise. 
</P>
<P>
In the spotlight: New names have cropped up in the box scores of Poly's games. 
A look at the batteries in recent Parrot outings reveals names such as Torres 
and Rocha notching wins and saves for Poly (20-3, 15-0) -- names unseen two 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
But the fresh faces are producing. Raul Torres and Adolpho Rocha, both juniors, 
have been thrust into the limelight since mainstays David Giatti (broken ankle) 
and Rodrigo Dorame (tender arm) became unable to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Torres, especially, has been effective, notching a 4-1 record in six 
appearances. He is now Coach Jerry Cord's No. 2 starter behind senior Eddie 
Castellanos (11-0). 
</P>
<P>
"They're still just getting their feet wet, really," Cord said of the tandem. 
"I didn't figure they'd throw much, except in relief. But they're just tough 
kids. They want to compete." 
</P>
<P>
If it isn't broken: Birmingham has won 12 consecutive games. Birmingham is a 
baseball team. Ergo, Birmingham is superstitious. 
</P>
<P>
Following the grand baseball tradition of quirky, off-beat behavior that 
characterizes a team on a win streak, the Braves have decided to shun their 
white, home jerseys in favor of the blue road jerseys they wore during the 
Holt-Goodman tournament that launched the win streak. Even at home, the Braves 
wear road blue. 
</P>
<P>
"It came time for us to wear our home jerseys again," Coach Wayne Sink said, 
"and the guys said to me, 'White jerseys? What white jerseys?' " 
</P>
<P>
Staff writers Steve Henson, Vince Kowalick and Brian Murphy contributed to this 
notebook.

WARD'S FONDEST MEMORIES FUELED BY INDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WOLF

<DATELINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As one of the most successful race drivers of all time, Rodger Ward has enough 
memories to fill several books. 
</P>
<P>
Tops on Ward's list, of course, is his remarkable record in the Indianapolis 
500. He won it twice and from 1959 through 1964 finished first, second, third, 
first, fourth and second. 
</P>
<P>
During that period, Ward won two USAC season championships, was runner-up three 
times and placed third once. All told, he won 26 championship races between 
1951 and his retirement in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
Ward will always look back fondly to the place where it all began -- the old 
quarter-mile dirt track at Balboa Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Now 69, Ward reminisced while speaking at the Hall of Champions recently. He is 
in town from his home in Alta Loma for the second Rodger Ward Invitational 
Historic Grand Prix, which will be held Saturday and Sunday on a 1.7-mile road 
course in the west parking lot at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"Balboa is where I really blossomed as a race driver," Ward said. "It's one of 
my all-time favorite tracks." 
</P>
<P>
Ward was born in Beloit, Kan., but grew up in South Pasadena, where he built a 
hot rod from used parts in his father's wrecking yard at the age of 13. He was 
fresh from a four-year hitch as an Air Force pilot in World War II when he made 
his debut as a midget-car driver at Balboa in 1946. He scored his first victory 
a year later in the San Diego Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
"The first race I ever drove, I wound up upside down," he said. "I was running 
last and, when I made my move, I spun out. Then Johnny Mantz's car hit my car, 
and they took me to the hospital to see if my brains were scrambled. 
</P>
<P>
"In '47, I had a car that ran pretty well but I wasn't making it into the main 
event. Toward the end of '47, I got into a car owned by Willie West and, for 
the first time, I was the fastest qualifier. I won a trophy dash or two, and I 
was always in the main event. 
</P>
<P>
"Then came the San Diego Grand Prix. I qualified second, so I was on the 
outside of the front row. I took the lead on the first turn and was never 
headed. Those few weeks in that car were the beginning of my success." 
</P>
<P>
From then through 1950, Ward won "about six or seven races a year" at Balboa 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure how many I won altogether, but it was around 25," Ward said. 
"That was all in midgets." 
</P>
<P>
Ward also had some trying times at Balboa Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"In '49, I was driving for Perry Grim and there was one evening I'll never 
forget," Ward said. "Perry said to me, 'Rodger, I know you like to run high, 
but there's one hole on the track, so make sure you miss it.' 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I went out to qualify and, the first time around, I hit the hole and 
flipped upside down. The car was bent all to hell, and Perry was fit to be 
tied. 
</P>
<P>
"Later that year, Jimmy Bryan, who went on to be a tough Indy driver (winning 
the 500 in 1958), tried to do a slide job on me. He didn't get by, and he 
knocked me upside down. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of the worst accidents I ever had. I broke my right arm and left 
wrist, and the ball of my right shoulder was cut into five pieces. I was out 
until late in the season." 
</P>
<P>
Ward's most serious crackup occurred at the Riverside Speedway in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
"I broke my back in three places that time," he said. "My brakes failed and I 
went off an embankment. My only thought was to keep the car right-side up. If I 
had flipped over, it would have wiped me out. I went through a chain-link fence 
that I thought was going to break my head off, but I stayed up." 
</P>
<P>
There is one accident that still brings sadness to Ward. He was a key figure in 
the wreck that took the life of Bill Vukovich in the 1955 Indy 500. 
</P>
<P>
"Billy and I were close friends," Ward said. "We traveled together, and I 
really admired him. He had won Indy in '53 and '54 and would have won in '52 if 
his steering hadn't failed with nine laps to go. 
</P>
<P>
"He was leading again after 56 laps and I was three laps behind him when my 
front axle broke. I hit the wall and flipped three times and ended up on the 
track. Al Keller went across the track to avoid me and hit Johnny Boyd. Then 
Vukovich ran up over Boyd, flipped end over end, and lost his life. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of that tragedy, I nearly retired. I was so distressed, I was ready to 
hang it up then and there. But Billy's brother told me I could be great if I 
concentrated on driving, so I made up my mind to become more serious about it." 
</P>
<P>
Foremost in Ward's determination to dig deeper within himself was to shed his 
reputation as a playboy. 
</P>
<P>
"Until then, I was probably more famous for my social life," he said. "People 
thought I drank too much, although actually I drank very little, but I was 
never able to handle booze. I also chased a few women at that time. 
</P>
<P>
"The car I drove in '55 was owned by Lyle Greenman, who had bought it from J.C. 
Agajanian after Troy Ruttman won the 500 with it in '52. Before the race, 
Greenman said to me, 'I don't know if you can last 500 miles, because you're up 
all night.' I'll have to admit I hadn't done much to dispel that reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"So after Billy Vukovich's death, I gave up smoking and drinking, and I decided 
it was in my best interests to get married. In those days, if you were a single 
man on the road, people considered you a bum." 
</P>
<P>
Ward's change in life style -- he was married in the early 1950s, later 
divorced and remarried 10 years ago -- paid off. He finished eighth in 1956, 
and after being forced out the next two years by mechanical problems, he found 
the combination that carried him to his first victory in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
Ward had been driving for Roger Wolcott, who died after the 1958 season. 
Suddenly a free agent, Ward decided to hook up with a Milwaukee car owner named 
Bob Wilke. A.J. Watson was Wilke's chief mechanic, and Ward considered Watson 
the best. 
</P>
<P>
"Wilke gave me $1,000 to sign and $1,500 when I qualified for Indy. I was a kid 
with a new toy. 
</P>
<P>
"They built me a new car every year, and I was always up there. Besides the two 
500s I won, I should have won two others -- in '60 and '64. Those years, things 
that shouldn't have happened went wrong." 
</P>
<P>
After failing to qualify in 1965 and placing 15th in 1966, Ward decided to 
retire. 
</P>
<P>
"Watson built me a car in '65 that was a total disaster," Ward said. "I thought 
about retiring then, but I didn't want to go out on a sour note, so I kept 
racing in '66. I won at Trenton, finished second at Phoenix and qualified quite 
well at Indy, so I felt like I had proved to myself that I could still drive. 
</P>
<P>
"I made my retirement announcement at the awards dinner after the 500, and it 
was a very emotional thing. I had offers to drive again, but I couldn't have 
lived with myself if I'd come back and been an also-ran." 
</P>
<P>
Ward now serves as an analyst on many auto-race telecasts, and is much in 
demand for speaking engagements. Although he dropped out of Franklin High 
School in Highland Park after his junior year, it would be hard to find a more 
articulate or entertaining speaker. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always a glib talker," he said. "And wherever I go, I recall the old 
days at Balboa Stadium. It was one of the places I really enjoyed racing. The 
crowds were probably more enthusiastic than anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Race Notes 
</P>
<P>
Rodger Ward rode in last year's inaugural Vintage Grand Prix as a passenger in 
a 1914 Tahi Special, in which it was necessary for him to pump the oil and gas. 
He says he might drive this year but won't say for sure. . . . Racing starts at 
1 p.m. both Saturday and Sunday, following trials from 9 a.m. to noon. There 
will be seven races each day with cars in nine different classifications. One 
race will consist of 14 restored pre-World War II race cars; five others will 
match foreign and domestic production cars matched according to size and horse 
power. Two formula races will include class A, B and C model cars, including 
McLarens, Lotuses, Lolas, Coopers and Porsches. . . . All races will be run on 
a nine-turn, 1.7-mile-course on the west end of the San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium parking lot. A total of 160 cars have been entered, all built before 
1972. . . . An car auction will be held from noon to 6 p.m. both days near the 
main gate. . . . Tickets are $12 a day, $22 for both days purchased in advance, 
$15 and $25 if purchased at the gate. Parking is free.

LA JOLLA WOMAN HOPING FOR HOME-COURT EDGE

With the home-court advantage and a history of success against higher seeded 
players, Liz Harper of La Jolla might well be in position to win the women's 
60s singles in the U.S. National Hardcourt Championships at the La Jolla Beach 
and Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
Harper, who plays No. 1-seeded Margorie Kohler of Carmel in today's 
quarterfinals, is trying to win her third tournament in as many tries this 
season. She defeated Fay Schwayder, of Lakewood, Colo., 6-0, 6-1, in the third 
round Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving a first-round bye, Harper, the sixth seed, defeated Muriel Bard 
of Laguna Hills, 6-0, 6-2, in Wednesday's second round. 
</P>
<P>
"I've played all the top seeds before and on occasion beaten them," Harper 
said. "To win a national tournament, it takes a combination of playing well and 
some luck, too." 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, Harper defeated Kohler of Carmel at the Northern California 
Sectionals in Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she was a little nervous since it was her home court," Harper said. 
"I'm sure she wants to meet me again." 
</P>
<P>
In February, Harper won the Southern California Tournament at Palm Springs, her 
first appearance this year. 
</P>
<P>
Harper shies away from playing both singles and doubles in national tournaments 
because the competition is tougher and the matches are usually longer. 
</P>
<P>
"The competition is so tough when I get to the later rounds," Harper said. "I 
just have too much tennis to play. I like singles better so I usually just play 
singles." 
</P>
<P>
Harper grew up in Santa Maria, which at that time had a population of 10,000 
and no tennis programs. 
</P>
<P>
While attending UC Berkeley she met her future husband Oscar Harper, who was a 
member of the men's tennis team. Once they began dating, she figured she better 
learn how to play. She took lessons but didn't compete in her first tournament 
until she was 40 and living in Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
She taught at Mayfield Senior School, a private girls' school, and served as 
the tennis coach, health education teacher and athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
"Since tennis was a part of my work, I was giving more hours to work on my 
game," Harper said. "In trying to help and analyze other people, my stamina 
improved. I hit that many more tennis balls." 
</P>
<P>
Now, because both Liz and Oscar have retired, they are able to practice 
together and they occasionally play in tournaments with senior mixed doubles. 
This one doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
"It's much better on the mixed doubles court if we don't talk," Harper said. 
"Some couples argue while they're playing, but we get along on the court. Oscar 
calls it mixed troubles, but always with a smile." 
</P>
<P>
The Harpers will have an unusual experience this summer when they travel to 
Europe for the first time to play in two tournaments, one in Vichy, France, and 
the other in Monaco. They will play singles and mixed doubles. 
</P>
<P>
Not only must they adapt to playing on clay instead of hardcourt, the language 
barrier could present a problem when it comes to scoring. Consequently, Harper 
carries a French pocket dictionary in order to practice scoring and key 
phrases. Harper has played on both clay and grass but prefers hardcourt or 
indoor surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll probably lose my concentration on my game," she said, laughing, "because 
I'll be trying to figure out how to say the score."

USIU KEEPS TALKING UP AN AMERICAN CONFERENCE

Come the 1991-92 basketball season, U.S. International may take its 
high-scoring act and soar happily above what it hopes will be the newest NCAA 
affiliate: the American Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday in Mission Valley, athletic directors from six independent 
universities gathered to further discuss plans for a new conference that Al 
Palmiotto, USIU Athletic Director, has been working on for two years. 
</P>
<P>
After a day of discussion, representatives from USIU, Southern Utah State, Cal 
State Northridge, Missouri-Kansas City, Northeastern Illinois and Chicago State 
agreed to take recommendations for a new basketball conference back to their 
respective presidents for approval by June 7. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the six schools attending -- the NCAA requirement to form a 
conference -- Sacramento State, Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Youngstown and Wright 
State expressed interest but failed to send a representative. 
</P>
<P>
"We agreed that a basketball conference would be in our best interest," said 
Palmiotto, "and right now, it would be a beginning for all of us. We decided 
we're all going back to our schools to get approval or denial." 
</P>
<P>
Palmiotto and the other athletic directors decided that forming a 
basketball-only conference would be beneficial because basketball is the only 
sport where they consistently have scheduling difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
"The trouble with being an independent," said Palmiotto, "is that we never know 
until that year if people will hold to their contract with us. There's more of 
a moral commitment in a conference. People in our conference won't walk out." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Heigert, Cal State Northridge athletic director, said scheduling basketball 
games for November and December is easy, but January and February is another 
story. 
</P>
<P>
"We have five established conferences on the West Coast," Heigert said. "That 
puts us in a bind when we have to schedule games. It leaves us with some 
tremendous voids. We're off the last three weeks in December to late January 
and we can never find teams to play us." 
</P>
<P>
Palmiotto said schools will be required to make a two-year commitment to the 
conference.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: EXPORTS FUELING THE ECONOMY, MAY SPARK STOCK RALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An old story on Wall Street may soon get new attention -- and for good reason. 
It may justify the stock market's next surge. 
</P>
<P>
The story is that overseas demand for U.S. goods and services continues to 
mushroom. Export business is so good, in fact, that it helped make up for soft 
domestic demand in the first quarter for many companies. That kept the slide in 
first-quarter corporate profits from being a lot worse than it might have been. 
</P>
<P>
"Export certainly has been one of the reasons why the manufacturing economy 
hasn't sunk any lower," said Robert Bretz, who heads the business survey 
committee of the National Assn. of Purchasing Management. 
</P>
<P>
His group, which tracks the economy by watching supply and demand trends at 
major companies, said its export index in April was the highest since 
September. 
</P>
<P>
The continuing export boom may be under-appreciated by a jaded Wall Street. 
Consider that domestic demand for manufactured goods has been sluggish for 
about a year as car, housing and appliance sales have weakened. That has been a 
general drag on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, exports of heavy equipment and high-tech products to Europe and Asia 
keep growing, reaching levels that many U.S. companies could only have dreamed 
about in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Add it up, and the export strength is a partial answer to the mystery of the 
economy's resilience in the face of weak domestic demand. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just what the doctor ordered," notes David Hale, economist at Kemper 
Financial Services in Chicago. Remember when, just a few years back, economists 
warned that flat exports and rising imports threatened to cut the legs out from 
under the U.S. economy? 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, this country imported $113 billion more than it exported, counting all 
goods and services. By last year, the deficit was cut to $47 billion. 
</P>
<P>
So the progress is real. And even better, it's almost certain to continue, even 
as the dollar remains surprisingly strong -- normally a negative for exporters. 
The simple fact is that the world needs a lot of new nuts-and-bolts-type 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the bullish things about the next two to three years is the capital 
goods cycle," Hale said. Overseas and at home, many companies are spending huge 
amounts of money to modernize their plants or build new ones. Governments, 
meanwhile, are committed to rebuilding sewer and road systems and to forcing 
new pollution-control systems on factories. And Eastern Europe will require a 
major overhaul if it's to be brought into the world trading system. 
</P>
<P>
The machinery needed for those projects -- the air compressors, generators, 
tractors, computers and other goods -- are the forte of U.S. manufacturers. 
Even if West Germany wanted to keep the entire European market to itself, it 
couldn't, notes Lacy Hunt, economist at CM&amp;M Group in New York. "West 
German plants already are working at capacity," he said. And Japan, too, is 
investing heavily in its own economy, limiting its export capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt believes that another surge in U.S. exports, combined with new vigor in 
the service economy, will push real U.S. economic growth to an annualized rate 
of 3% in the current quarter, from 2.1% in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Translation for the stock market: Corporate profits may come in much stronger 
than expected. And even if interest rates continue to inch higher -- the price 
we pay for an expanding economy -- the end of recession worries may give 
investors new reasons to look at stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Although investors are conditioned to believe that stocks can't rise if 
interest rates are rising, it isn't true. Everything depends on the economic 
background. Stocks soared in 1983 as the economy rebounded, even though rates 
were rising as well. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, stocks such as Deere, Caterpillar, Ingersoll-Rand, Fluor Corp. 
and Compaq Computer have seen renewed buying. All are major exporters of goods 
or services. The market may be telling us that, despite the short-term gloom 
over interest rates, the long-term economic picture looks better, not worse. 
</P>
<P>
Europe's Not So Bad, Either: Everybody knows Europe will be an exciting 
investment arena in the 1990s. But the expected economic changes there will 
undoubtedly produce a lot of losers as well. This is a time for particularly 
careful stock picking, not rushing wholesale into European markets, says 
Penelope Dobkin, manager of Fidelity Group's Europe Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Dobkin has run the Europe Fund since 1986. She has $370 million under 
management, spread among 90 stocks. Her track record: Up 25.93% in the 12 
months ended March 31, compared to 22.37% for the average Europe-focused fund. 
In the first quarter, Dobkin's fund gained 1.61%, compared to 0.82% for the 
average Europe fund. (The average U.S. stock fund lost 2.31%.) 
</P>
<P>
Dobkin says the euphoria over West Germany's future isn't a lot of hype. But 
forget the talk about an avalanche of profits falling on West German companies 
from Eastern European business ventures. "That's not going to come before 
1995," she said, especially given the costs of absorbing East Germany into the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
The reason to buy West German stocks now is that they're severely undervalued 
just based on their underlying assets, including land, Dobkin said. U.S. stocks 
went through an asset-value phase in the late '80s. In West Germany, only now 
are the usually secretive companies beginning to disclose what their assets are 
worth. 
</P>
<P>
The asset value of West German companies is estimated at about 1 trillion West 
German marks, Dobkin said. The value of their stocks on the open market, 
meanwhile, is about half that. Pretty simple math, Dobkin figures. And those 
asset values are destined to rise, she said, because West German economic 
growth will be Europe's locomotive over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
She has 19% of her fund's assets invested in West German stocks, the heaviest 
weighting in any European nation. And she's sticking with the blue chips -- 
industrial giants such as Siemens and Veba, and big banks such as Deutsche 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
"The average European portfolio is overweighted with smaller stocks," Dobkin 
said. But she thinks that, while the smaller issues were the success stories of 
the 1980s, the big names will be the hot stocks of the 1990s. One good reason: 
"Just look at what the Japanese are buying," she said. Japanese investors are 
taken with Europe, and just as they played the blue chip names in the United 
States in the late '80s, they're looking for the same kind of stocks in West 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
After Germany, the heaviest stock weightings in Dobkin's portfolio are France 
(13% of assets), Britain (13%), the Netherlands (13%), Switzerland (6%), Spain 
(5%) and Norway (4%). 
</P>
<P>
She is most worried about Britain. She recently slashed her holdings there (the 
weighting was 24% on Jan. 1). Dobkin sees great risk of high inflation in 
Britain leading to a recession later this year. And the market doesn't reflect 
the major possibility of a liberal Labor government coming to power by 1992, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE EXPORT BOOM 
</P>
<P>
While the U.S. economy slowed last year, overseas demand for U.S. goods soared 
-- a trend that has continued into 1990, helping support corporate earnings.

Prices of oil futures fell sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange despite 
an OPEC agreement to cut the cartel's total crude oil output by 1.45 million 
barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the decline in prices signaled the return of traders who had 
taken to the sidelines during the emergency meeting of the Organization of 
Petroleum Exporting Countries in Geneva and who see little hope in the near 
term for an easing of the crude oil glut. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, grain and soybean futures settled mostly lower; 
copper futures fell; precious metals advanced, and livestock and meat futures 
were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settled 37 to 74 cents lower in New 
York, with the contract for delivery in June at $17.99 a barrel.

ago. Revenue totaled $846 million, a gain of 15%. The firm said the increase in 
revenue was offset by higher expenses, primarily higher fuel and security 
costs, as well as foreign exchange losses.

<P>
The dollar fell against the West German mark but gained on the Japanese yen in 
nervous trading before today's release of U.S. employment data and this 
weekend's meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized countries in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Talk of heavy institutional buying of dollars for yen pulled the U.S. currency 
higher, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar buying occurred despite a senior U.S. official's comment that the 
United States is still concerned about the yen, which has dropped sharply this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended at 1.6830 West German marks, down from 1.6850 on Wednesday and 
at 158.10 Japanese yen, up from 157.95. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers said uncertainty about the inflationary impact of German unification 
made trading in West German marks choppy and unfocused. 
</P>
<P>
The British pound fell to $1.6390 from $1.6430 at Wednesday's close. Against 
its Canadian counterpart, the dollar fell to $1.1660 Canadian, compared to 
$1.1675 Canadian on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar bought 1.4550 Swiss francs, against 1.4545 on Wednesday, and 5.6465 
French francs, compared to 5.6535 francs.

SOME EXTRAORDINARY FAMILY SNAPSHOTS; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILY PICTURES BY SUE MILLER HARPER &amp; ROW $19.95, 330 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE KENDALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Family Pictures" is literature by exorcism. When the writer is in complete 
control of the material, as Sue Miller is here, the reader also will be 
possessed, oblivious to claims outside the hermetic world of the book until the 
last page is turned. 
</P>
<P>
If a writer can accomplish this transference with virtually no plot and the 
most skeletal structure, with a cast of only eight principal characters and a 
setting no more exotic than an upper-middle-class Chicago neighborhood, you 
know you're in splendid company. 
</P>
<P>
The effect an autistic boy has on his parents and siblings is Miller's subject: 
a tough, uncompromising theme that must be deeply felt and thoroughly absorbed. 
Miller keeps the medical details to a minimum. You know that Randall Eberhardt 
is a physically attractive child; that his usual silent passivity is broken 
only rarely by uncontrollable destructive outbursts, mostly against things but 
occasionally -- and terrifyingly -- against the persons who love him. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a book about the pathology of autism, but about the way Randall's 
condition forms, alters and skews his parents' marriage and the directions 
taken by his brothers and sisters. There are two older children -- Lyddie and 
Macklin -- and three younger girls, born to prove that Randall was a cosmic 
accident for which no one is responsible. 
</P>
<P>
Although the story is told from several points of view, the dominant voice is 
Nina's -- first of "the last straws," the biggest "little pitcher of health." 
Those are their father's pet names for his small daughters, and the irony is 
apparent even to the tots. 
</P>
<P>
Nina is strategically placed to be the spokesperson; after Randall, before her 
small sisters. She's the living demonstration that all can be well again, and 
from earliest childhood, that obligation motivates and burdens her. Randall 
remains remote, a powerful catalyst working almost invisibly upon the others, 
virtually inert until the precarious equilibrium is disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
As the Eberhardt story unfolds over the 4 1/2 decades beginning with David and 
Lainey's marriage in 1940, we realize Randall is the binding force that holds 
the family together. When the wrenching decision is finally reached to place 
him in a more structured environment, the tightly woven family fabric unravels. 
Once he's gone, the older two children suddenly find themselves directionless, 
with no substitute for the constraints Randall provided. The glue that had 
turned the three younger girls into a self-sufficient unit dissolves, and they 
drift apart. 
</P>
<P>
One day, in a burst of directionless rage, Randall pushes his mother down the 
stairs. By then, David and Lainey have separated. Sarah, the youngest, phones 
her father, who responds immediately, cleaning Lainey's deep head wound, 
calming Randall and getting him to bed, staying the night. 
</P>
<P>
Indirectly, we've learned enough about autism to realize that such outbursts 
are more frequent after puberty, triggered by the same hormones that turn 
docile children into sullen rebels. As David said so long ago, there was no 
other Randall inside this one, struggling to emerge; no love great enough to 
create a person inside the shell. 
</P>
<P>
And so Randall goes away, to the best of the available places. Macklin goes, 
too -- to Vietnam, after drifting through a semester at Harvard. Unmoored, with 
no further reason to be exceptional, Mack longs for the humdrum. He returns 
safely from the war and buys a bar. 
</P>
<P>
Beautiful, gifted Lyddie settles for a series of stopgap jobs. Nina, our 
narrator, escapes into a marriage so suffocatingly bland that she must leave 
her husband to find the more demanding life for which her childhood prepared 
her. 
</P>
<P>
The saga emerges from vignettes -- snaps of Lainey and David young and happy 
with their babies and friends; overheard recriminations leading to their 
separation; glimpses of the children at school, at play and in love; apparently 
unposed, candid pictures cataloguing the manners and mores of the last 40 
years, revealing character more honestly than any formal portraits could. 
That's all, but Miller has made "Family Pictures" as compelling as life itself.

TROUBLES AT THE JOFFREY; 
</P>
<P>
DANCE REVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
A GLITZY PREMIERE MASKS WOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC/DANCE CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the surface, it looked like another op'nin', another show for the Joffrey 
Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the typical triple bill began 
with some old neo-classical kitsch and ended with a spangly new ode to the 
faded glories of vaudeville. Both instant crowd-pleasers were choreographed by 
the official keeper of the Joffrey flame, Gerald Arpino. 
</P>
<P>
In between came a knowing nod in the direction of dainty romanticism. 
Eclecticism remains a Joffrey speciality. 
</P>
<P>
The dancing, throughout, reflected the customary high spirits complemented by 
reasonably high finesse. Although the faces in the company change, the gutsy 
attitudes do not. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it couldn't have been business as usual on this occasion. Few in the 
dressy, unruly, non-capacity audience for this non-gala gala may have known it, 
but the show went on while the company confronted chronic, possibly fatal, 
turmoil behind the scenes. 
</P>
<P>
Financial crises clouded the horizon. The trustees and administrators were 
engaged in savage internal warfare. Loyalties were polarized. 
</P>
<P>
Resignations and defections had begun to pile up. Accusations and 
counter-accusations echoed from coast to coast. Arpino's continuing role as 
artistic director languished in doubt. So, for that matter, did the immediate 
survival of the Arpino-Joffrey oeuvre as we have long known and sometimes loved 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the inaugural festivities at the Music Center accentuated the 
negative in matters of repertory. Arpino's "Italian Suite," first seen in 1983, 
is little more than a collection of amiable cliches. The frantic cheer is 
filtered through cloying rosy lights, and propelled by speedy steps and 
athletic contortions that contradict the impulses of Wolf-Ferrari gurgling in 
the pit. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing offensive can happen here. Nothing memorable can happen, either. It is 
all too pat, too predictable, too eager to attract at the most obvious level. 
</P>
<P>
At least "Italian Suite" isn't pretentious. That cannot be said of "The 
Pantages and the Palace Present 'TWO-A-DAY.' " 
</P>
<P>
Arpino's latest show-biz extravaganza is a splashy, glitzy, costly, witless 
production number. Also a massive bore. 
</P>
<P>
It looks nice, in its defiantly tasteless and nostalgic way. It lacks focus, 
however. It lacks purpose. It lacks balletic interest. It lacks point, not to 
mention a point of view. 
</P>
<P>
It pretends to revere the traditions of the all-American variety show, as 
sandwiched between sagas of the Silver Screen. The idea isn't original, but 
there may be some life in it yet. 
</P>
<P>
Not here. 
</P>
<P>
Arpino can't seem to decide if he wants to glorify the past or to satirize it. 
He doesn't seem sure if he wants his eager cast to dance or just to mug. He 
ends up falling between most of the stylistic chairs for 40 ponderous minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The first damaging clues come from the pit. The choreographer -- who is also 
credited with the "conception" -- could have exhumed some great period ditties. 
On the other hand, he could have commissioned a new score predicated on 
illuminating parody. Instead, he engaged Elliot Kaplan to rework some limp 
platitudes written by none other than Rebekah Harkness, a patron of the arts 
who was blessed with more money than talent. Some of her money, not 
incidentally, underwrote this dubious venture. 
</P>
<P>
The proceedings begin irrelevantly with the final teary snippets of "A Star Is 
Born," the 1937 version featuring Janet Gaynor. The printed program then 
promises "The Voice" of "The Incomparable Mr. Tony Randall." It eluded these 
ears. 
</P>
<P>
The parade of impersonations begins as Jodie Gates invokes Sally Rand's fans 
but not her bare skin. Elizabeth Parker and six attending swells do an ersatz 
tap routine. Time dips back to Mack Sennett for a fatuous bathing-beauty number 
in which Peter Narbutas flexes his biceps while flirting with a bump and grind. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Janus and Tom Mossbrucker indulge in a would-be exotic harem duet in 
which the hero suggests more of Valentino than Nijinsky. Beatriz Rodriguez, 
eternally typecast as the sizzling Latina, leads a sort-of-Spanish 
divertissement. Carole Valleskey undulates filmy butterfly wings in the manner 
of Loie Fuller. Tina LeBlanc, petite and eternally innocent, descends from the 
flies on a wired crescent moon in a fruitless fabrication of the sexy Marilyn 
Miller mystique. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, and not a moment too soon, everyone comes back for a valedictory 
Charleston climax. It was choreographed not by Arpino but by Louis Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
The participants give their all for their boss in the various thankless 
charades. There is a lot of talent here, most of it smothered in gook. For 
better and worse, Gerald Arpino may just be the Andrew Lloyd Webber of dance. 
</P>
<P>
For at least one ungrateful viewer, the greatest satisfactions of the evening 
involved the ancient lightweight charms of Arthur Saint-Leon's "La Vivandiere." 
In the pas de six, the exquisite Tina LeBlanc and the mercurial Edward Stierle 
were fleetly seconded by Cameron Baden, Jodie Gates, Cynthia Giannini and Kim 
Sagani. 
</P>
<P>
Here one could savor ballet without padding, without puffery, without false 
sentiment and without gimmickry. It was reassuring.

Shannon to Dance in Moscow: Michael Shannon, the 20-year-old Angeleno who was 
accepted in the fall as a soloist with the Bolshoi Ballet, will dance Albrecht 
in the company's production of "Giselle" on June 1 in Bolshoi Theatre. His 
Moscow debut in a leading role comes after a dozen tryout performances in tour 
sites such as Tblisi and Tashkent, and perhaps will determine whether the 
company will bring him -- among the youngest dancers to be given a leading role 
-- to Shrine Auditorium in August. BETH KLEID

Oprah's Honesty: "Truth has been the foundation of my adult life," declared 
Oprah Winfrey, confirming a recent report that she had a child out of wedlock 
at age 14. 
</P>
<P>
"It is true that when I was 14 years old, I became pregnant," Winfrey said in a 
statement issued to Parade columnist Walter Scott to be published this Sunday 
in the magazine. "The baby was born prematurely and died shortly after birth," 
she added. Winfrey said she had hoped the matter could stay private until she 
was ready to talk about it. Winfrey issued the statement now because her 
half-sister Patricia Lloyd told of the birth in a recently published interview.

'HAPPY' ECHOES '30S COMEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Happy Together" (selected theaters) has the smarts to take a clever idea and 
run with it. Serious-minded would-be playwright Chris (Patrick Dempsey) and 
blithe-spirited aspiring actress Alex (Helen Slater), because of her unisex 
name, wind up as freshman roommates in a university dorm. The result is "The 
Odd Couple" turned into a brisk and bubbly romantic comedy. 
</P>
<P>
Writer Craig J. Nevius has written wonderful roles for Dempsey and Slater, two 
of the most attractive, talented young actors on the screen today, and they in 
turn come through with some of their best work yet under Mel Damski's shrewd, 
deft direction. "Happy Together" is a pleasure in the tradition of '30s 
screwball comedy -- a genre many attempt but few succeed with -- in which 
fantastic situations evoke genuine emotion. 
</P>
<P>
Slater is a delight as she takes on the time-honored task of making a certified 
pain-in-the-neck irresistible. Having settled in before Chris arrives, the 
mercurial Alex has transformed their room into cluttered pastel paradise with a 
plastic water tub in the center of the room. Her extroverted personality and 
whimsical ways drive Chris nuts, yet in the three weeks it takes him to arrange 
a room transfer he's ready to cancel it. 
</P>
<P>
Therein lies the persuasive charm of the film. Within that period Chris begins 
to understand that he's a stick figure -- that, as his drama professor (Marius 
Weyers) points out, he can't write unless he's lived -- and that Slater's 
flamboyance masks the vulnerability of an unloved child, the product of a 
broken marriage. (According to Alex, her rich father ranks his Mercedes before 
her.) At the same time, it starts to dawn upon Alex that she might do well to 
take both her studies and Alex more seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Weyers, who starred in "The Gods Must Be Crazy," gives the film dimension, as 
does Barbara Babcock, entirely believable as Chris and Alex's rigorous acting 
teacher, who attempts to break through Alex's superficiality as an actress. Dan 
Schneider shines as Chris's bright, eccentric pal, and Kevin Hardesty is 
amusing as Alex's rocker fiance. "Happy Together" (rated PG-13) is modest, 
unpretentious -- and surprisingly touching underneath the giddiness.

'HIRE' A SUBTLE, SPLENDID STORY OF SEDUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With his round black hat, pale face and black coat, Monsieur Hire, from the 
splendid movie of the same name, might have stepped straight out of a painting 
by Magritte; you half expect to be able to see blue sky and clouds straight 
through him. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, this small, mysterious bachelor is at the heart of a luminous and 
hypnotic new film (at the Music Hall) made from one of the novels by the 
always-reliable Georges Simenon. Michel Blanc plays Hire and Sandrine Bonnaire 
plays his prey, the sensual young woman he watches every night from his window 
opposite hers in their old Paris apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
Bonnaire and Blanc are an extraordinary pairing: the warm, carelessly seductive 
Alice and the reclusive, almost universally disliked Monsieur Hire, who spends 
most of his nights in the dark, listening to Brahms and staring at the yellow 
rectangle of light that is her apartment. What makes it creepy is that after 
the startling night when Alice catches Monsieur Hire at his compulsion, she 
doesn't report him to the police. Instead, she uses her power over him to draw 
him into her life until they are both held by a delicately manipulated bond of 
eroticism. 
</P>
<P>
It's frightening for us, since we know that the milky-skinned, deeply emotional 
Hire is a suspect in the murder of the 22-year-old girl from the apartment next 
to his. An almost fatherly inspector (the craggy-faced Andre Wilms) is on the 
case, dropping in at odd moments to hound Hire, while at the same time director 
Patrice Leconte drops visual hints -- a white mark on Hire's black suit -- that 
recall "M" and Peter Lorre's psychopathic killer. 
</P>
<P>
The film's last major character is the thuggish Emile (Luc Thuillier), plainly 
less in love with Alice than she is with him. And that is enough about the 
story, which is a skein of subtleties played with the utmost deliberation and 
intelligence. (The film is rated PG-13, since its eroticism is almost entirely 
suggested, not shown.) 
</P>
<P>
The actors are fascinating. Blanc's work has so many different levels and 
layers as he builds first sympathy for Hire, then fear about his motives, that 
it needs to be seen more than once to appreciate the depth involved. 
</P>
<P>
Alice is one of Bonnaire's rare sunny characters, a country girl from Provence 
with predictably lousy judgment about big-city men, but one who's comfortable 
with her sexuality and blessedly unneurotic. Bonnaire has now shed every ounce 
of the puppy fat she had in "A Nos Amours" and in "Vagabond"; with the contours 
of her face defined this way, she's become even more interesting to watch and 
she's always been a compelling actress. 
</P>
<P>
"Monsieur Hire" is marvelously all-of-a-piece. Denis Lenoir's lighting camera 
work sets a mood that's cool and detached; as a result, in retrospect this 
seems to be a film played out in bluish moonlight. The atmosphere is further 
deepened by the faintly ominous musical score of British avant-gardist Michael 
Nyman, known also for his music for the films of Peter Greenaway. 
</P>
<P>
Director Leconte, who was also co-adapter with Patrick Dewolf, has deliberately 
made the period and even the location undefinable, an interesting idea that 
connects his film subliminally to French policiers of the '30s and '40s, to the 
Polanski of "The Tenant" or to early Hitchcock. Leconte also seems to like 
visual puns, like the one in which Hire, eating a soft-boiled egg, is shot from 
above and behind, the top of the egg and the top of his perfectly rounded 
balding head making an exact match.

ENSEMBLE PLAYS WORKS BY FACULTY COMPOSERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
There are lots of university composers writing lots of music, some of it very 
good. But much of the music exhibits a kind of sonic anemia, the symptoms of 
which include dullness of rhythm, textural sameness and a marked avoidance of 
drama. 
</P>
<P>
There were at least three case studies of the malady on display Wednesday at 
Cal State Northridge, the site of a faculty composers recital. 
</P>
<P>
Hardly affected by the syndrome, however, was Daniel Kessner's Chamber Concerto 
No. 4. There wasn't much melodic activity of interest, but a good deal of 
rhythmic, timbral and above all textural variety, and Kessner's sense of 
proportion proved unusually keen. Under the baton of the composer, seven 
members of the CSN New Music Ensemble gave a surprisingly ragged performance. 
</P>
<P>
Severely smitten with academic tediosis was William Toutant's "Small Suite for 
Piano." With its ceaseless motoric rhythm and lack of melodic direction, the 
work imparted no sense of purpose, Kary Kramer's attentive reading 
notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Campo's Concerto for Piano With Winds and Percussion displayed more 
textural and timbral variety, but one grew tired of the same old brass barks 
and tone clusters repeated again and again. Francoise Regnat brought energy and 
virtuosity to the solo part, and members of the CSN Wind Ensemble, conducted by 
Kessner, played serviceably. 
</P>
<P>
One could find rhythmic interest in Aurelio de la Vega's "Magias e 
Invenciones," a setting of five poems by Gaston Baquero -- but only in the 
piano part (superbly played by Delores Stevens). The vocal part, delivered 
without much poetic insight by soprano Anne Marie Ketchum, consisted of a 
series of slow, disjunct and rather amorphous melodic lines. TERRY McQUILKIN

MOVABLE FEASTS: SUNSET GRILL: A NEIGHBORLY RESTAURANT IN SANTA MONICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By L.N. HALLIBURTON

<TEXT>
<P>
Certain new restaurants careen into a neighborhood as if they were crashing a 
party, so at odds is their aesthetic and their price range with the milieu. 
Other places surface and, right away, feel like an old friend. The Sunset 
Grill, just 4 months old on the corner of Ocean Park Boulevard and 17th Street, 
is a little bit of both. 
</P>
<P>
It's set in a still-sleepy part of Santa Monica that looks almost the same as 
it might have in 1953. But swivel around and check out what's written on the 
the Sunset Grill's blackboard menu (grilled duck sausage, spicy Jamaican 
chicken breast) and you know it's the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
I was placing my to-go order when a woman with a Liverpudlian accent walked in. 
"D'ya have some of that rice me mum luvs so much?" 
</P>
<P>
"The basmati with raisins? I'm sorry," owner Jean Lorda said. "We change dishes 
every day." 
</P>
<P>
The Liverpudlian asked for a taste of the tortellini salad and the ratatouille. 
"Nice place ya got," she said. "But where are the school kids gonna go? This 
used to be their burger-and-fries joint." 
</P>
<P>
Well, the kids across the street will still find hamburgers (juicy, solid) and 
fries (pale, frozen, forgettable). They'll also find low prices, a mom-and-pop 
feeling (Jean's wife, Frances, is usually around) and a couple of traces of 
France. 
</P>
<P>
A businessman appeared. "I'd like that great sandwich I had last week." 
</P>
<P>
Lorda looked up from the Caesar salad he was tossing -- a fine Caesar it is, 
with a jolt of garlic and really crunchy croutons -- and squinted his eyes. 
"Didn't you have the Royal Vegetarian?" (A splendid choice, I had it the next 
time I came in: a tier of unusually sweet roasted peppers, streams of velvety 
marinated Japanese eggplant, sun-dried tomato and toasted pine nuts; it's 
served with a perky balsamic vinegared green salad for $4.95.) 
</P>
<P>
Jean Lorda, who hails from Biarritz, makes a homey linguine basquaise, full of 
sweet and slow-cooked tomatoes, onions and green pepper. The only thing I 
didn't like about this dish -- and about Sunset Grill -- is that the sauce 
leaked through its dumb plastic foam container onto the carpet of my car. (My 
post-Earth Day pitch: Tell all the take-out shop owners you encounter to switch 
to aluminum tins with cardboard tops; they can be used at home over and over 
again.) 
</P>
<P>
Hand-cut, homey vegetable soup is always on the stove here. And salads have 
perky, clear-tasting vegetables -- though they tend to be on the under-seasoned 
side, and a few need to go the last yard. Potato salad tasted merely of 
mayonnaise and undercooked spud. Noodles with tarragon and caraway-seeded 
sausage needs a more vigorous finish. 
</P>
<P>
The sausage plates, all $4.25, are served with lots of wonderful smoky, cooked 
red cabbage slivered confetti thin and dolled up with a sweet vinegar brew. 
There are lean veal sausages, fennel-dense duck (from Jody Maroni) and even a 
maple sausage served with potatoes. (Breakfast-to-go starts at 7:30 a.m.) 
</P>
<P>
Grilled skinless chicken breast, marinated in olive oil, is juicy and attended 
by hot ratatouille. The Jamaican chicken has a hint of coriander, cumin, 
cinnamon and mango Champagne vinegar marinade; it's served with sweet grilled 
pineapple and mellow, raisin-studded curried rice. 
</P>
<P>
A research psychologist just told me that nutmeg has been found to be a calming 
substance. Maybe that's why this namby-pamby-looking pasta primavera (little 
bits of zucchini, really sweet carrots, a toss of peas in a warm bath of nutmeg 
cream sauce) tastes so comforting. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood has found out about Lorda's lovely homemade $2 creme caramel. 
The first batch is often gone by lunch and the second isn't ready until supper 
time. The only thing to do is to become a regular. Then, perhaps, Jean Lorda 
will sock one away for you. Like I said, it's a neighborly place. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunset Grill, 1701 Ocean Park Blvd., Santa Monica. (213) 450-7546. Open Monday 
through Saturday 7:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Checks and cash only. Parking available.

BISTRO AT FANTASIA: A NICE SLICE OF CONTINENTAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City of Industry looks on the map like a gerrymandered electoral district 
hugging the Union Pacific tracks. It sounds like a . . . well, a terribly 
industrial sort of place. 
</P>
<P>
There's more to it than that, though. At Azusa Avenue there's the impressive 
acreage of the Puente Hills Mall. Most evenings, a line of brightly dressed 
people is likely to be waiting outside a glittering nightclub called Fantasia, 
right across Albatross Street from that mighty mall. Adjoining Fantasia is a 
restaurant, the Bistro at Fantasia, which has lured a chef from Beaudry's, the 
old Continental place in downtown L.A. 
</P>
<P>
This should tell us two things. One, Industry is up-and-coming, no longer 
willing to accept culinary dependency on other cities. Two, Fantasia expects 
its nightclubbers to go for Continental food with modern touches (though the 
fact that the dining room is wheelchair-accessible suggests it isn't relying 
entirely on the dance crowd). 
</P>
<P>
There is clearly some intentional accommodation to nightclub dining habits. 
Light foods such as sandwiches and omelets are available from the lunch hour 
clear up until closing time. All the pastas are available in either half or 
full portions. 
</P>
<P>
The specials can be a good deal more adventuresome than the regular Continental 
menu, sometimes exhibiting Southwestern or Cajun tendencies (though there is a 
blackened catfish on the regular menu). But not always. The special might be 
something as safe and Continental as sauteed sirloin tips; actually, rather 
like sirloin tips lightly stir-fried with shallots and zucchini. It satisfies 
the traditional Continental requirement that food should be tender above every 
other consideration. 
</P>
<P>
As Continental restaurants go, the Bistro is often very pleasing. For one 
appetizer, marinated artichoke leaves are mixed with crab meat. For another, 
huge shrimp are floated on two sauces, ketchup spiked with a little horseradish 
and a sort of sour cream tartar sauce. The crab-and-jack-cheese quesadilla is 
impressively large. 
</P>
<P>
And there are nice touches. A steak sandwich comes heavy-laden with fried 
onions and mushrooms. The soup of the day might be accompanied by a couple of 
little triangular pies wrapped in filo ("spanakopita," the waiters call them, 
though technically they're boreks), one filled with sauteed mushrooms and the 
other with densely packed little shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
But of course this isn't exactly food you'd drive a million miles for. A nice 
broiled lobster tail weighs a good 12 ounces; a nice piece of swordfish is 
grilled and served with a little herb butter; nice pieces of beef, shrimp, fish 
and chicken are grilled and served on a tomato coulis that tastes a tiny bit 
like barbecue sauce. Rarely do you reach for a stronger word than nice. 
</P>
<P>
And the kitchen drops the ball often enough. The rigatoni with ricotta and 
sun-dried tomatoes has little or none of the promised basil, and lies on the 
plate like a slab of drying library paste. Tournedos is a slightly overdone 
filet mignon served on top of fried apple slices in a raisin and cider sauce. 
It's an over-sweet dish in the Continental tradition of sticking apples where 
they don't belong. 
</P>
<P>
The desserts are standard issue: Lemon cake and carrot cake in the usual tall 
and heavily frosted style, a cheesecake with a strange caramel aftertaste. 
There is an intense chocolate cake like a brownie with thick fudge frosting, 
and possibly you might find a special of strawberries and custard sauce 
sandwiched between sheets of puff pastry, resting on a pool of milk chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
The Bistro isn't everything, but it proves one thing. You can have a good time 
in Industry. Or anyway, a nice time. 
</P>
<P>
The Bistro at Fantasia, 17500 Castleton St., City of Industry. (818) 912-6065. 
Open for lunch and dinner daily. Full bar. Parking lot. All major credit cards 
accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $25-$65.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: DINING WITH DISNEYANA AT MICKEY'S KITCHEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE OCHOA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you can imagine picking up a pizza and a package of Mickey Mouse 
corn-on-the-cob holders inside Disneyland's It's a Small World ride, you'll 
have a pretty good idea of dinner at Mickey's Kitchen. The new Disney-owned 
restaurant inside a Disney store at Montclair Plaza, (714) 624-8111, is 
something of a suburban Toontown. 
</P>
<P>
Near the front is Winnie-the-Pooh country, with a separate yogurt bar; off in a 
corner is a replica of Tony's Italian restaurant, the setting for the love 
scene in "Lady and the Tramp." Sing-along videos of Disney hits constantly play 
on a big-screen TV (the words and a bouncing mouse head appear as subtitles). 
</P>
<P>
You order at a counter that looks like a jazzed-up McDonald's. Here, the 
uninitiated stare at the menu 
</P>
<P>
for long periods of time. Should it be a Goofy Burger? A Supercalifragi-Chicken 
Salad? Piglet Corkscrew Fries? Mouseketeer Meals (choose from Huey, Dewey or 
Louie) come with a prize. If you're confused, a helpful employee will greet you 
("Hi! Welcome to Mickey's Kitchen!") and tell you that a P and J Handwich 
stands for peanut butter and jelly. (Disneyland may be the happiest place on 
earth, but Mickey's Kitchen must be the friendliest -- relentlessly so.) 
</P>
<P>
And how does Disney food taste? A lot like the burgers you get outside Space 
Mountain -- in other words, food only a kid could love. But as one Mickey's 
Kitchen worker confided, "Everyone who comes here is a kid, really." LAURIE

CONSCIOUSNESS-RAISING BY TERRY COLE-WHITTAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK PHILIPS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I'm not a nightclub singer," announced Terry Cole-Whittaker at the start of 
her Cafe Largo set on Wednesday. "What I am is a transformational cheerleader." 
</P>
<P>
That said, the ever-smiling ex-televangelist launched into a new cabaret act in 
which she sang about divinity and hosted a Vegas-style consciousness-raising 
revue before a capacity crowd of doting devotees. 
</P>
<P>
Billed as a preview of her planned television show, the club date also featured 
performances by a metaphysical comic, an astrologer and a transcendental 
meditation teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Cole-Whittaker, dressed in a sequined white crepe gown, worked the room like a 
New Age Doris Day, hugging customers and belting out sincere but stilted 
versions of uplifting standards like "Look to the Rainbow" and "When You Wish 
Upon a Star" to piano accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
Her warm demeanor contrasted sharply with the materialistic guru image she 
developed during her divine prosperity days. And though her vocal talents are 
limited, the fans appeared to savor every note. 
</P>
<P>
Between songs, the former Mrs. California offered anecdotes about her spiritual 
progress and pampered followers with esoteric banter about Tarot cards, trance 
work and animal totems. "Everyone is a flower," she said, passing out tiny buds 
to the patrons. "Keep cross-pollinating." 
</P>
<P>
Audience participation played a key role in the program. At one point, members 
of the audience volunteered affirmations into an open microphone, providing 
insights like "We do not die, we graduate." 
</P>
<P>
But as the two-hour show progressed, the obtuse music and humor began to drag. 
Still, nothing seemed to faze Cole-Whittaker. "Don't be afraid to make a fool 
of yourself," she advised before leading the crowd into her sing-along finale. 
"I'm used to it." CHUCK PHILIPS

TRIP SHAKESPEARE CARVES ITS OWN NICHE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Honest romanticism and winking hipness aren't supposed to work together. So how 
do you explain the L.A. debut of Trip Shakespeare at Club Lingerie on 
Wednesday? How a simple fairy tale turned into a novelty dance called the 
slacks, how a twisted comic-book adventure became a hilarious rhyming farmland 
epic of, well, near-Shakespearean proportions? And, most important, how 
youthful irreverence did nothing to diminish the bare sentimentality of a 
closing ballad, or vice versa? 
</P>
<P>
The Minneapolis quartet is obviously a band that's willing and able to carve 
out its own distinct and rewarding niche. Maybe if L.A.'s wacky metal parodists 
Redd Kross had been weaned on Neil Young and the Band instead of Kiss and the 
Partridge Family, they might sound something like this. The harmonies and 
emotions are heartland-pure and plain, but the attitude is 
television-generation-hip. The trick of the Trip is that it's never snide -- an 
accomplishment that has eluded virtually all who have tried for this chemistry 
(not that many have tried). And, not incidentally, the band writes great hooks, 
and it rocks. Maybe the name says it all. STEVE HOCHMAN

BUSH ASKS NEW A-ARMS CUTBACK; 
</P>
<P>
SUPERPOWERS: THE PRESIDENT PROPOSES REDUCING OR ELIMINATING GROUND-BASED 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN EUROPE. HE CONCEDES WORRY ON FUTURE SOVIET MILITARY 
RESURGENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush proposed a new treaty Thursday that could reduce or eliminate 
ground-based, short-range nuclear weapons in Europe, a step the Administration 
hopes will allow the Soviet Union to live more easily with a united Germany's 
presence in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Bush acknowledged that he does "worry about the military resurgence of some 
kind inside the Soviet Union." Soviet generals, wary about the rapid pace of 
warming superpower relations, appear to have forced civilian leaders to back 
away from proposed arms control deals, senior Administration officials say. 
</P>
<P>
And even though Bush denied a direct link between those concerns and his new 
arms control plan, Administration officials indicated they hope that offering 
to negotiate away the thousands of U.S. nuclear artillery pieces and 
short-range missiles in the NATO's arsenal will ease the Soviet military's 
concerns about a united Germany's membership in the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
"We ought to look at ways our objectives can be accomplished that reduce the 
friction or enhance the acceptability on the part of the Soviet Union as much 
as possible," a senior Administration official said in briefing reporters on 
Bush's plan. 
</P>
<P>
The initial Soviet response to Bush's proposal was positive, with Tass, the 
official Soviet news agency, declaring that the new American proposal had been 
a Soviet idea in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Bush announced his new arms plan during a 45-minute press conference in which 
he also: 
</P>
<P>
* Said he is looking for "goodwill gestures" he can offer Iran, citing in 
particular U.S. efforts to uncover information about four Iranian diplomats 
believed to have been killed in Lebanon in 1982. But, he added, "there were no 
behind-the-scenes negotiations that will come out" that led to the recent 
release from Lebanon of two American hostages. 
</P>
<P>
* Called, again, for Congress to give him more flexibility in doling out 
foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
* Expressed "disappointment" with the results of his policy toward China but 
insisted that he has "no apologies" for his attempts to avoid a break in 
relations between the two countries after the Chinese leadership smashed the 
nation's democracy movement last June. "Preserving a relationship with the 
People's Republic of China in the broad global context is important," he said. 
</P>
<P>
* Joked about the heckling that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev received 
during the May Day parade Tuesday. "He ought to come join some of the parades I 
go to around here," Bush said. "That's the fruits of democracy. He's just 
learning." 
</P>
<P>
But, Bush acknowledged, Gorbachev is "under extraordinary pressure at home, 
particularly on the economy, and I do from time to time worry about a takeover 
that will set back the whole process." 
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, where Secretary of State James A. Baker III briefed NATO foreign 
ministers on the new arms control proposals, Baker and NATO Secretary General 
Manfred Woerner said that NATO allies are unanimous in their support. 
</P>
<P>
But, as Baker and other officials made clear, several fundamental parts of the 
new proposal remain undecided, including whether the eventual goal of the new 
talks will be total elimination of ground-based nuclear weapons in Europe, as 
many Europeans have urged, or only a reduction in the superpower arsenals. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have to work out the specifics of our negotiating position internally 
(within the Administration) and with our allies," Baker said. Many decisions 
about the new plan will not be made until a NATO summit that Bush said will 
take place in late June or early July. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's new arms plan is part of a basic reevaluation of NATO defense strategy 
to adapt to what the President called "the transformed Europe of the 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
The new proposal has two parts. First, effective immediately, the United States 
will stop modernizing nuclear artillery shells in Europe and cease work on 
modernizing the short-range Lance missiles now used by NATO. Next, the 
Administration will ask the Soviet Union to begin negotiating a new treaty on 
removing the short-range weapons now in place. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, NATO has about 680 Lance warheads and more than 1,400 nuclear 
artillery shells, most of which are based in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
With the collapse of Communist governments in Eastern Europe and the effective 
end of the Warsaw Pact as a military force, plans to modernize short-range 
weapons have been increasingly unpopular in Europe and on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
The current weapons have ranges no greater than 75 miles and therefore would be 
guaranteed to explode within the territory of what are now friendly, democratic 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
Bush "only performed the last rites" for a modernization plan that was "already 
dead," said House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.). 
</P>
<P>
"We have to realize that the situation in Europe has changed," West German 
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher told reporters in Brussels. "The 
American proposal is a contribution to that." 
</P>
<P>
The Administration continues to oppose strongly the removal of all nuclear 
weapons from Europe, believing that they are essential to maintain a stable 
military balance. At the same time that it negotiates possible elimination of 
ground-based weapons, it is likely to push for an increased emphasis on 
air-launched cruise missiles to maintain NATO's nuclear deterrent, U.S. 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
NATO officials believe that the ground-based weapons, particularly nuclear 
artillery, are of limited use and could be eliminated entirely if the Soviets 
would agree to do the same. Baker, in fact, told reporters in Brussels that 
Washington might decide to begin removing some short-range nuclear weapons 
before a treaty is negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
The United States also might continue producing Lance missiles and nuclear 
artillery shells for use outside of Europe, he said, noting that no decision 
has been made on either of those issues. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Soviet negotiators are working at conferences on three arms treaties: 
The strategic arms reduction talks, which are designed to reduce the 
superpowers' arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons; the talks on conventional 
forces in Europe, aimed at reducing non-nuclear weapons and armies in Europe, 
and meetings on an international pact aimed at banning chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The new talks on short-range missiles would begin once a conventional forces 
treaty is signed. Baker said that the United States is hopeful that such an 
agreement can be reached before the end of this year. But, he conceded, the 
talks "have not proceeded as rapidly as we might have hoped." 
</P>
<P>
"We have some proposals on the table and we are waiting for some answers from 
the Soviet Union," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Once those talks are complete, the United States is likely to begin a new round 
of negotiations on conventional forces to accommodate a Soviet desire to see a 
cap set on the size of the German army, according to the senior official who 
briefed reporters on Bush's plans. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets have tried to bring up that issue in the so-called two-plus-four 
talks about German unification, a move that the United States has resisted. The 
foreign ministers of West and East Germany, the United States, the Soviet 
Union, Britain and France meet Saturday in Bonn to begin the formal talks after 
several weeks of lower-level discussions. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, Baker said, will seek to limit the talks to the status of 
Berlin and other matters left over from the occupation of Germany that followed 
World War II. He said that the United States will not allow those talks to 
become a forum for debating Germany's membership in NATO, which Baker called 
"not negotiable." 
</P>
<P>
NATO's foreign ministers voted unanimously Thursday to approve alliance 
membership for Germany after completion of the reunification process and agreed 
not to expand NATO military forces into territory now part of East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said in his press conference that he hopes the conventional forces treaty 
could be signed late this year at a meeting of the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe, a 35-nation body that includes the United States, 
Canada, the Soviet Union and all European states except Albania. The conference 
would meet in Paris, while the Administration has offered to host a preliminary 
foreign ministers meeting of the group in New York in September. 
</P>
<P>
The conference is best known for the 1975 Helsinki Accords that ratified the 
postwar boundaries of Europe and adopted a variety of human rights measures, 
most of them virtually ignored by the Soviet Union and its Eastern European 
allies until recently. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said that the 35-nation conference, once scorned by Washington as a 
debating society, looms large in the U.S. view of a post-Cold War Europe. He 
had suggested to the NATO foreign ministers "a number of ideas for transforming 
CSCE from a process into more of an institution," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, he said, the 35-nation group could adopt mechanisms for resolving 
disputes among member countries, conduct regular political consultations, and 
establish a procedure for members to obtain clarifications of unusual military 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
Lauter reported from Washington and Kempster from Brussels. Times staff writer 
John-Thor Dahlburg, in Moscow, also contributed to this report.

<P>
BUSH HIGHLIGHTS 
</P>
<P>
Nuclear Weapons 
</P>
<P>
Bush canceled plans for further modernizing NATO nuclear weapons in Europe. "As 
democracy comes to Eastern Europe and Soviet troops return home, there is less 
need for nuclear systems of the shortest range," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hostages 
</P>
<P>
Bush expressed hope that Iran views recent U.S. efforts as gestures of goodwill 
and said "there may be other things we can do" to help expedite the release of 
captive Americans in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he had no qualms about meeting with Lithuania's prime minister, even 
though the United States has not recognized the republic as an independent 
nation. He also sees no U.S. role in its bid to break from Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Union 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that vocal opposition, such as the jeering directed at Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev during the May Day parade in Red Square, is 
something the Kremlin leader had better get used to. "That's the fruits of 
democracy," Bush said. "He's just learning."

PRO-DEMOCRACY SHIP SAILS FOR CHINA, POLITICAL STORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It is just an old ship, once used by British oceanographers and later 
discarded. But its new name, owners, destination and mission have caused the 
United States and several other governments to keep track of its progress as 
closely as if it were a nuclear submarine. 
</P>
<P>
The new owners are a Paris-based group of Chinese dissidents and their 
supporters seeking to bring democratic change to the Communist regime in 
Beijing. A few months ago, the exiles bought the 1,200-ton, 237-foot vessel, 
christened it the Goddess of Democracy and outfitted it with powerful radio 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the ship is churning through the seas of Southeast Asia, headed for the 
coast of China. There, from international waters, the dissidents plan to launch 
a series of round-the-clock broadcasts beaming pro-democracy messages to the 
Chinese mainland. 
</P>
<P>
China is not amused. The Chinese government has been making menacing statements 
about the Goddess of Democracy, leaving open the possibility that it may try to 
seize or take some military action against the ship if it begins offshore radio 
transmissions. 
</P>
<P>
"It is something we cannot tolerate," a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign 
Ministry said last month. ". . . We believe that countries friendly towards 
China will not support the activities of the ship." 
</P>
<P>
Because of China's warnings, officials in Washington, London, Paris, Taipei and 
Singapore have been working overtime to make sure that the voyage of the God 
dess of Democracy doesn't turn into a serious diplomatic or even military 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the ship's crew shelved previously announced plans to dock in the 
Taiwan port of Keelung. U.S. sources confirmed that the Bush Administration 
earlier had voiced concern to Taiwan about a possible military confrontation 
with China over the ship. Christophe Nick, a French journalist aboard the 
vessel, told reporters that the Keelung port call was canceled because "the 
pressure on Taiwan is very hard." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, David Wilson, the British governor of Hong Kong, said Thursday that 
the Goddess of Democracy will be denied entry to Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a policy here of making sure that Hong Kong is not used as a 
battlefield for other people's political battles," Wilson told reporters. "It 
would be quite inconsistent with that policy to have a ship of that sort coming 
into Hong Kong." 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, a British colony, reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 and is 
sensitive about relations with Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
One Bush Administration official branded the effort to launch pro-democracy 
broadcasts to the Chinese mainland as "provocative." U.S. officials have been 
checking to make sure no American citizens are aboard. The ship's crew is 
French and there are journalists from France and Taiwan on board. 
</P>
<P>
For American officials, the main worry is that the ship could touch off a new 
round of friction between China and Taiwan, which in turn would pose a serious 
dilemma for the United States. Since 1979, the United States has recognized 
Beijing as the legal government for all of China, but it also has maintained 
friendly, informal links with the Nationalist government on Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese dissidents have talked of having the Goddess of Democracy anchor 
off the China coast near Quemoy and Matsu -- the two islands in the Taiwan 
Strait that Communist Chinese forces shelled in the late 1950s in an episode 
that nearly led to war. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Paris organization, A Boat for China, which is sponsoring the 
ship, have acknowledged that some of the $1.5 million raised for the project 
came from Taiwan. It is not clear whether this money came from the government 
or independent private sources. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the funding from Taiwan as evidence, the official Chinese news service 
warned Sunday: "In supporting the Goddess of Democracy ship, the Taiwan 
authorities are taking a new step to oppose the Chinese government and to 
create disturbances on the Chinese mainland." 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, China has been hammering away at the theme that broadcasts by 
the Goddess of Democracy would be illegal, even if the ship stays in 
international waters. China argues that the ship would be, in effect, a pirate 
broadcaster, operating without the approval of the International 
Telecommunications Union. In the past, the United States and several European 
governments have all objected to pirate commercial stations broadcasting from 
international waters adjacent to their territory. 
</P>
<P>
The Voice of America beams both shortwave and AM broadcasts to China from its 
huge transmitters in the Philippines, and the British Broadcasting Corp. airs 
programs to China from Hong Kong. Over the past year, China has tried to jam 
the VOA and BBC broadcasts, but with only intermittent success. 
</P>
<P>
According to one intelligence source, last year China bought two special mobile 
jamming units from France that could be used against the ship's broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Goddess of Democracy reportedly will be equipped with special 
transmitting equipment, also from France, that has the capacity to overcome 
these jamming units. 
</P>
<P>
The radio ship was named after the haunting white statue resembling the 
American Statue of Liberty that was erected in Beijing's Tian An Men Square by 
pro-democracy demonstrators last spring. The vessel left the French port of La 
Rochelle on March 17. Organizers have said that on the way to Asia, Chinese 
ships followed the ship and harassed it. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Singapore has been the only government willing to risk offending China 
by helping the Goddess of Democracy. Ignoring the Chinese warnings, the island 
state allowed the vessel to dock there Wednesday to refuel and take on new 
supplies and 10 more French journalists. 
</P>
<P>
"Singapore is a free port, and we are open to any ship calling at our port as 
long as it does not violate our law or threaten our national security," said 
Valerie Mok, an official of the Port of Singapore Authority.

radio equipment and christened the Goddess of Democracy, is causing 
international concern. The 237-foot ship was purchased by Paris-based Chinese 
dissidents who plan to beam pro-democracy broadcasts to the Chinese mainland 
from international waters off the Chinese coast. But Beijing has made menacing 
statements, prompting diplomats in several nations to monitor the situation.

MEXICO OFFICIAL ALLEGEDLY WAS AT KIDNAP TALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mexico City's current chief of police was present at one of the meetings where 
the kidnaping of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena was planned, federal 
prosecutors have alleged in court documents filed in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. prosecutors said Javier Garcia Paniagua was among 10 men -- ranging 
from drug traffickers to top Mexican law enforcement officials -- who met in 
Guadalajara in October, 1984, to discuss "a DEA agent that was causing 
significant problems," according to a prosecution document filed this week in 
preparation for a major trial involving four suspects indicted in Camarena's 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, who has not been indicted in the Camarena case, was Mexico's secretary 
of state from 1976 to 1982 and later served as president of that country's 
leading political party, PRI. 
</P>
<P>
A controversial figure, Garcia is a former director of Mexico's federal 
security police, which has seen several of its officials implicated in drug 
trafficking. When he was appointed Mexico City's police chief in January, 1989, 
congressional sources in Washington and U.S. law enforcement agents on both 
sides of the border expressed dismay. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia could not be reached for comment Thursday, but Mexico's consul general 
in Los Angeles, Jose Angel Pescador Osuna, expressed surprise at the latest 
U.S. allegation. 
</P>
<P>
"I had never heard the name of Garcia Paniagua in this case," he said. "I don't 
know where they get this information. I am going to send this to Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure is likely to further inflame tensions between the United States 
and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials have claimed that a "rogue" unit in the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration orchestrated the April 2 kidnaping of a Guadalajara doctor, who 
was flown across the border by bounty hunters to face prosecution in the 
Camarena case. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico's attorney general, Enrique Alvarez del Castillo, has continually 
maintained that all of the people responsible for Camarena's slaying have been 
brought to justice. About two dozen people have been convicted in Mexico of 
involvement in Camarena's abduction and murder. Three people are also serving 
jail terms in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The DEA has relentlessly pursued Camarena's killers, claiming that the 
conspiracy to kidnap the agent involved several former high-ranking Mexican law 
enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
Camarena, who worked undercover for the DEA, had incurred the wrath of Mexican 
drug kingpins by tipping authorities to vast marijuana fields in the Mexican 
countryside. A subsequent raid by authorities reputedly cost traffickers 
billions of dollars in lost street sales. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged plotters "agreed that something would have to be done about him," 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Camarena was kidnaped off a Guadalajara street in February, 1985, and taken to 
a house owned by convicted drug trafficker Rafael Caro Quintero. He was 
interrogated and tortured. His mutilated body was found at a ranch 65 miles 
from Guadalajara a month later. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution memorandum submitted by assistant U.S. attorneys Manuel Medrano 
and John Carlton states that the meeting Garcia attended was the second of two 
gatherings held in October, 1984, at the home of Javier Barba Hernandez, who is 
identified as a chief lieutenant of the Guadalajara narcotics cartel. Barba was 
killed in a shoot-out with Mexican federal police last year. 
</P>
<P>
Also attending the meeting, according to the document, were Honduran drug 
kingpin Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros; Manuel Ibarra Herrera, former director of 
the Mexican federal security police; Miguel Aldana Ibarra, a former director of 
Interpol in Mexico; Caro Quintero; drug kingpin Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo; 
Mexican businessman Ruben Zuno Arce; Armando Pavon Reyes, Ibarra Herrera's 
chief aide, and drug trafficker Manuel Salcido. 
</P>
<P>
All but Salcido, who remains a fugitive on unrelated charges, and Garcia, have 
been indicted in the Camarena case. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys in the impending trial said this was the first time that 
Garcia's name has been raised in connection with the kidnaping and that no 
material on him had been turned over by prosecutors. "This raises more 
questions than it answers," one defense lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys were divided over the possibility that Garcia would testify 
at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
According to the new prosecution memo, there were a total of four meetings held 
to discuss what to do about Camarena. The only reference to Garcia is that he 
attended the second meeting. 
</P>
<P>
At the third meeting, held in December, 1984, Camarena's photograph was passed 
around and conspirators said they were "going to take care of him," the memo 
said. The final meeting was held in early February, 1985, just a few days 
before Camarena was kidnaped. 
</P>
<P>
"Corruption amongst Mexican high-ranking government and law enforcement 
officials was pervasive," according to the prosecution's trial brief. "Law 
enforcement officials were on the traffickers' payroll, and facilitated matters 
by providing protection for marijuana and cocaine loads, and escorting 
marijuana shipments being transported and smuggled into the United States." 
</P>
<P>
One defense lawyer said the trial brief "confirms, once again, that the Mexican 
government is on trial."

3 OF 5 CHICKENS IN U.S. TEST FOUND TO HAVE SALMONELLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Salmonella levels in raw chicken are much higher than previously believed, 
according to a recent federal study in which almost three out of five birds 
tested positive for the potentially harmful bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
An independent laboratory test conducted for The Times also found the more than 
50% of the locally purchased chicken showed evidence of salmonella. 
</P>
<P>
The findings could be a setback for the poultry industry, which has spent the 
past several years recovering from publication of 1985 federal estimates that 
one in three birds were believed to carry the pathogen. 
</P>
<P>
Salmonella is the leading cause of diagnosed food-borne illness in the United 
States. There are an estimated 2 million to 4 million cases of Salmonellosis 
each year. The disease also kills about 2,000 people annually, according to 
federal health statistics. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture report found the incidence of salmonella 
bacteria on fresh carcasses obtained from five processing plants in Georgia was 
57.5%. Georgia was selected for the research project because it is a leading 
poultry producing state. 
</P>
<P>
Department of Agriculture officials downplayed the study results, saying the 
salmonella levels discovered are minute and as such, the bacteria's presence 
poses no health threat if the meat is properly stored, handled, cooked and 
served. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, earlier this week the federal government approved irradiation, a 
controversial food processing technique, for use on poultry as a means of 
controlling salmonella and other bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
USDA's critics argue that salmonella bacteria can multiply under the right 
conditions, allowing just a few cells to reproduce rapidly. Illness could occur 
if contaminated raw chicken comes into contact with other foods that are 
consumed raw. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of raw meats containing bacteria such as salmonella is not illegal. 
Health officials reason that if the meat is properly refrigerated, handled and 
cooked, any pathogen present will be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
California chicken producers have long maintained that the salmonella rate of 
their chickens is lower than the national average due to the state's drier 
growing conditions, among other factors. However, 52% of raw chickens purchased 
by The Times from five Los Angeles County and six Orange County markets in 
recent days tested positive for salmonella bacteria, with only Zacky Farms and 
Randall Farms showing no contamination. 
</P>
<P>
The sample was randomly selected from major California chicken suppliers, but 
not necessarily representative of all poultry products available. 
</P>
<P>
The 21 raw chicken products were tested for The Times by Michelson Laboratories 
in Commerce using a procedure approved by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration. The procedure tests for the presence of, rather than the amount 
of, salmonella. 
</P>
<P>
Those brands that tested positive included 2 whole Rocky the Range Chickens 
from Pine Ridge Ranch in Sebastopol; 1 whole Pride Roaster chicken from Pat 
&amp; Sons Poultry in Los Angeles; 2 whole Tyson Chickens from Springdale, 
Ark.; and 6 Foster Farms of Livingston products, including whole birds and 
packaged parts. 
</P>
<P>
Products without evidence of salmonella were 7 Zacky Farms products, including 
whole birds and packaged parts, 2 Foster Farms whole birds and a package of 
Randall Farms chicken breasts. 
</P>
<P>
Former Foster Farms executive David M. Theno, who is now a consultant to the 
firm, said that the incidence found in The Times test was much higher than 
those being found in the Livingston plant. Nevertheless, he added that 
consumers must keep in mind that raw chicken products are "to be cooked before 
consumption, therefore any bacteria present should be killed by the heating 
process." 
</P>
<P>
"People think that if salmonella is in a product then you're going to 
automatically get sick. That is not the case," he said. "Whether its 35% or 50% 
of the chickens that contain salmonella there is nowhere near that many 
illnesses (as a result)." 
</P>
<P>
Bart Ehman, co-owner of Pine Ridge Ranch, which produces the antibiotic-free 
Rocky The Range Chicken, said that all poultry producers battle a salmonella 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We've tested ourselves for salmonella and it does occur occasionally," he 
said. "We're not worse off than anybody else and we do everything to avoid 
salmonella, we really do. Sometimes, often times, when we test we do not find 
salmonella. And sometimes we find some." 
</P>
<P>
Corky Bennish, a principal owner of Pat &amp; Sons Poultry in Los Angeles, did 
not have any comment on the lab results. However, he added that his firm did 
"everything we can to keep the product wholesome according to USDA standards." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Justice, executive vice president of Tyson, said that his firm's laboratory 
analyses do not indicate problems with salmonella and that those Tyson chickens 
purchased by The Times must have "picked up some (bacteria) along the line." 
</P>
<P>
Zacky Farms declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials, who saw a 5% decline in chicken sales after release of the 
government's 1985 study, attribute the increase in salmonella levels in the 
latest study to the use of more sensitive laboratory detection methods and not 
to a rise in the contaminant's presence in the nation's broiler flock. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, critics of the USDA say the findings indicate the agency is doing 
little or nothing to reduce the incidence of salmonella in chicken. 
</P>
<P>
"The USDA policy on controlling bacterial contamination (in chicken) is a 
failure," said Rodney E. Leonard, executive director of the Community Nutrition 
Institute, a Washington-based consumer group. 
</P>
<P>
"They have been unable to get the industry to address the problems of 
contamination and have given up," Leonard said. "The only thing USDA can do is 
find something (irradiation) that can treat the chickens after they leave the 
plant." 
</P>
<P>
The recent study was done by Roy C. Blankenship, research leader of the poultry 
microbiological safety unit at the USDA's Agriculture Research Service in 
Athens, Ga. Blankenship said his data will appear in the August issue of 
Poultry Science Journal. 
</P>
<P>
Blankenship was studying a chlorine washing technique to rid birds of fecal 
contamination. He studied 1,500 chickens from five Georgia processors and in 
the course of the study determined that salmonella was present in 57.5% of the 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
"People should be aware that there is a hazard, but there are a lot of other 
hazards in life and you do things to avoid them," he said. "The emphasis should 
be on good food handling practices in the kitchen." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Roenigk, spokesman for the National Broiler Council, which represents 90% 
of the nation's chicken producers, said: "The methods (Blankenship) used were 
more sensitive than previous ones. He could pick up several (microscopic) cells 
of salmonella per carcass. While salmonella would be present, a few cells will 
not make you ill." 
</P>
<P>
Some industry observers questioned whether the five processing plants in the 
Blankenship study were state-of-the-art facilities. However, Blankenship said 
that the plants were well-managed, modern facilities operating within the 
regulations established by the USDA and under the agency's supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, a top USDA official said Blankenship's results are not cause for 
alarm. 
</P>
<P>
"(Some critics) say that because 57% of the chickens had at least one 
salmonella organism per carcass that this has public health consequences. It 
does not," said Lester Crawford, director of USDA's Food Safety and Inspection 
Service. "If we find just one organism, then (the entire bird) is classified as 
positive for salmonella. But I don't want anyone to think you can get sick from 
that. . . . Even if you ate raw chicken that contained one salmonella cell, it 
wouldn't make you sick." 
</P>
<P>
Crawford said health officials believe as many as 500,000 salmonella cells are 
required to make a healthy person ill. However, the number needed to cause 
Salmonellosis declines, sometimes dramatically, for those in the high-risk 
groups including infants, the elderly and those with compromised immune systems 
such as cancer or AIDS patients, for whom the disease can be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
Salmonellosis can cause flu-like symptoms such as nausea, fever, abdominal 
pains, headaches and vomiting. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers can protect themselves from potential salmonella bacteria by cooking 
chicken thoroughly, or to an internal temperature of between 175 degrees and 
180 degrees. Raw chicken should be handled carefully so it does not come into 
contact with other foods to be consumed uncooked, such as salad ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
All surfaces -- cutting boards, knives, containers that come in contact with 
raw chicken should be thoroughly cleansed with hot water and soap after use. 
Packaged chicken stored in the refrigerator should be placed on a plate or 
container so that none of the product's fluid drips onto other items creating a 
phenomena known as cross-contamination.

Reporter shopping: At long last, Democrats Dianne Feinstein and John K. Van de 
Kamp have agreed upon their Los Angeles debate -- May 20 at 4:30 p.m. on KCBS. 
Insiders note, however, that negotiations between the two campaign staffs 
involved efforts at "reporter shopping." The campaigns weighed offers from 
rival stations as to which outlets might insist on including their own 
aggressive reporters. The agreement signed by the candidates reserves for 
themselves and KCBS to pick the panel. The process left a couple of television 
journalists feeling blacklisted and others worrying that they might be 
perceived as handpicked stooges if they participate. 
</P>
<P>
KCBS News Director Michael Singer said, "My interest in this situation is to 
get what I consider the best qualified reporters in this town." 
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, the campaigns changed channels for their May 13 
debate in San Francisco. The new agreement calls for the debate to air on 
KRON-TV at 8 p.m. This in place of an afternoon session on KPIX. 
</P>
<P>
Political shadings: Wesley Sanders Jr., the treasurer in Compton, is running a 
serious but largely unheralded campaign for state treasurer against a candidate 
with name recognition and political connections that Sanders can only dream 
about. His opponent in the Democratic primary is Kathleen Brown, daughter and 
sister of former governors. "I am not a rich man," Sanders said in a recent 
speech, "and although I come from a good family, they are not known across the 
state." 
</P>
<P>
Then Sanders, who is black, closed his speech with this: "If you insist on 
voting for a Brown for treasurer, vote for me. There is nobody running for 
office who is any browner than me." 
</P>
<P>
Assembly update: Lynwood City Councilwoman Evelyn Wells walked away with the 
California Democratic Council's endorsement for her bid in the crowded 48th 
Assembly District primary. Wells was tough to beat: She serves as the council's 
controller. 
</P>
<P>
The endorsement will compete with the official party imprimatur bestowed on 
Marguerite Archie-Hudson, another of the four Democrats running for the 
nomination. Archie-Hudson also has won the moneyed nods of Speaker Willie Brown 
(D-San Francisco) and Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), who is 
giving up her seat to run for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, candidate Rod Wright has been organizing a swelling church-based 
grass-roots effort. And Los Angeles City Councilman Robert Farrell has hired 
San Francisco-based campaign consultant Clint Reilly, who was running Dianne 
Feinstein's gubernatorial campaign until a celebrated tiff last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead: Cathy Calfo, executive director of the California Democratic 
Party and right-hand woman to Chairman Edmund G. Brown Jr., is on her way out.

GOLAND GUILTY OF ILLEGAL DONATION TO HELP CRANSTON; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: BUSINESSMAN IS ACQUITTED OF FOUR OTHER COUNTS STEMMING FROM 
CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE 1986 CAMPAIGN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles businessman Michael R. Goland, a major pro-Israel contributor to 
political campaigns, was convicted in federal court Thursday on one misdemeanor 
count of making an illegal donation designed to help the 1986 reelection bid of 
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.). 
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, Goland, 43, was acquitted on four other counts of 
conspiracy and making false statements, and the jury deadlocked on a felony 
false-statement count. 
</P>
<P>
This was his second trial, the first having ended in a jury deadlock last July. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing on the one count on which Goland was convicted was set by U.S. 
District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew for July 16 in Los Angeles. Goland could receive 
up to one year in jail and be fined up to $360,000. 
</P>
<P>
According to court testimony, Goland secretly contributed $120,000 to Edward B. 
Vallen, the right-wing American Independent Party's candidate in the 1986 U.S. 
Senate race, in order to finance a last-minute advertising campaign by Vallen 
designed to draw votes away from Cranston's Republican opponent, Rep. Ed 
Zschau. 
</P>
<P>
There was no evidence that Cranston knew of the plan, and the senator was never 
implicated in the charges of election law violation brought against Goland. 
</P>
<P>
The Vallen ads financed by Goland said that Vallen was a far better 
conservative than Zschau and Republicans ought to vote for him. In the election 
returns, Vallen received 109,916 votes, about 5,000 more than the margin by 
which Cranston defeated Zschau. 
</P>
<P>
It was only revealed later that Goland was the actual contributor, since the 
contributions had been funneled through a large group of other people, some of 
them Goland friends and associates, others recruited by third parties, and had 
been reported under other names. 
</P>
<P>
An irony in the donations to Vallen is that many of them were initially 
reported as coming from orthodox Jews highly supportive of Cranston and Israel. 
Vallen, on the other hand, had made statements critical of "Zionists." He 
insisted later he had no idea of where his contributions were coming from. 
</P>
<P>
Goland has been a controversial donor since waging a $1.1 million personal 
campaign in 1984 to defeat Sen. Charles Percy (R-Ill.), who was viewed as 
critical of Israel. He has also spent heavily on other campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Under election laws, there are no limits on what anyone can spend on an 
independent campaign for or against anyone. But there are limits of $2,000 -- 
$1,000 in both the primary and the general election -- on donations to a 
candidate's campaign, and Goland's contributions to Vallen far exceeded those 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
The jury Thursday accepted government prosecutors' contentions that Goland had 
made an illegal contribution, but it did not accept their contentions that he 
had conspired to put together the scheme and then had lied about it. 
</P>
<P>
Goland's attorneys, led by Nathan Lewin of Washington, portrayed him as having 
been led astray by inept campaign consultants hired to arrange the matter. 
</P>
<P>
After the verdict, Assistant U.S. Atty. George Newhouse, the chief prosecutor, 
said he was "disappointed" at the acquittals, "but we're pleased he was 
convicted on the one count." 
</P>
<P>
Newhouse did not directly answer the question of whether the prosecution would 
recommend that Goland serve time in jail, saying only that his violation was a 
serious one and that the government would recommend "a significant sanction." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Goland nor his attorneys could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, one of the jurors at the six-week trial was removed from 
the jury for undisclosed reasons. During a hearing before U.S. Dist. Judge 
Dickran Tevrizian, Newhouse asked that the dismissed juror, Barry Kuhnki, be 
ordered to report to the U.S. marshal for fingerprinting and that a juror's 
note that had been given to the judge also be examined for fingerprints and 
handwriting. 
</P>
<P>
Tevrizian said the note could be examined but he denied the request that Kuhnki 
be fingerprinted.

AZT CLEARED FOR CHILDREN'S USE, FIRST SUCH AIDS DRUG; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: THE FDA'S ACTION IS EXPECTED TO MAKE MORE SUCH ANTIVIRAL MEDICINES 
AVAILABLE FOR PEDIATRIC USE.

<P>
The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday formally approved the antiviral 
AIDS drug AZT to treat children, making it the first AIDS drug sanctioned as 
standard therapy for pediatric use. 
</P>
<P>
The drug was approved for use for patients three months to 12 years old who 
have fully developed AIDS or who are infected with the AIDS virus and show 
signs of a damaged immune system as measured by laboratory tests. In the latter 
group, they need not have overt symptoms of the disease. The drug already has 
been approved for adolescents and adults. 
</P>
<P>
"AZT clearly benefits children," said Dr. Dan Hoth, director of the division of 
AIDS for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the 
government's lead AIDS research agency. "With this approval, it will now be 
easier for children to get access to the drug. We think this is an extremely 
important milestone in the development of therapeutics for this disease because 
it is the first drug for children." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's action is expected to pave the way for more rapid testing and 
approval of additional AIDS drugs for pediatric use. The federal government has 
been under increasing pressure to make AIDS treatments and clinical trials of 
experimental AIDS drugs more accessible to children, since until recently there 
has been nothing available to them. With few exceptions, it has also been 
long-standing FDA policy that drugs of any kind cannot be tested on children or 
made available to them until they have been studied and approved for use in 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
Hoth said that at least three other antiviral AIDS drugs -- DDI, or 
dideoxyinosine; DDC, or dideoxycytidine, and CD4 -- are currently being studied 
in children. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 128,319 reported cases of AIDS in this country since 1981, there have 
been 2,192 cases in children younger than 13, according to the federal Centers 
for Disease Control. Of these, 1,182 children have died. There are no reliable 
estimates of the number of children infected with the virus, although some 
experts have speculated that the figure is as high as 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
AZT, also known as zidovudine, already has been in widespread use in children 
since last fall, when the FDA permitted access to the drug for compassionate 
reasons while pediatric AZT research was continuing. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, however, Burroughs Wellcome, the manufacturer of AZT, provided 
the drug for free. The FDA decision to officially approve the drug for children 
now means that Medicaid, private insurance and other third-party payers now 
likely will cover its cost. 
</P>
<P>
"FDA's approval of AZT for pediatric use means that the drug is now officially 
considered to be a standard therapy for children with AIDS," Health and Human 
Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan said in a statement. "This status should 
encourage more insurance providers to reimburse for zidovudine's use in 
pediatrics." 
</P>
<P>
The drug -- whose dosage in children is determined by body surface size -- 
costs an average of $1,750 a year for a child. It is available in a 
strawberry-flavored syrup. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very excited, and we're looking now to see what happens with the next 
few drugs," said Susan DeLaurentis, co-founder of the Los Angeles-based 
Pediatric AIDS Foundation, which raises money for pediatric AIDS research. 
</P>
<P>
"We encourage the drug companies and the FDA to test drugs faster in children 
and approve them faster," DeLaurentis added. "It is starting to happen -- and 
we hope they will learn from the example of AZT." 
</P>
<P>
The FDA's action came after its antiviral drugs products advisory committee -- 
a panel of outside experts -- recommended March 30 that the drug be approved 
for pediatric use. 
</P>
<P>
The company cautioned, however, that children younger than 15 months of age 
undergo more sophisticated confirmatory tests for infection or a viral culture 
before beginning AZT therapy. The most commonly performed test for AIDS 
infection only indicates the presence of antibodies to the AIDS virus and 
children of that age whose mothers were infected often still carry antibodies 
-- meaning that they may not necessarily be infected. 
</P>
<P>
AZT, which was approved for adult use in 1987, has been studied in formal 
trials in more than 200 children since 1986. Once any drug has been approved 
for sale, physicians often prescribe it as they see fit, even for unapproved 
uses. But in the case of AZT, many health professionals have been reluctant to 
give it to children, afraid that its side effects may be more severe in this 
patient population. 
</P>
<P>
AZT can cause toxic reactions, which include severe anemia requiring blood 
transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
The findings of the pediatric trials have shown that children taking AZT 
experience side effects similar to those in adults. The studies have also 
demonstrated that children taking AZT experience the same benefits as adults -- 
that is, it prolongs survival, relieves symptoms, encourages weight gain and 
enhances the quality of life.

PREVIEW / PAPAL VISIT TO MEXICO; 
</P>
<P>
JOHN PAUL II: NO ACCIDENTAL LATIN TOURIST

VATICAN CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On one of Pope John Paul II's frequent visits to the parishes of Rome, an 
Italian schoolboy asked him why he traveled so much. 
</P>
<P>
"Because not all the world is Rome," the Pope replied. 
</P>
<P>
John Paul should know. He's been there, from Arctic fjord to South Sea island, 
African slums to the sites of concentration camps in Europe. Next week: a 
Mexican jail. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the Pope run? He thinks it is, for one thing, a responsibility of 
the office. For another, he enjoys it. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, John Paul will begin another exhausting foreign pilgrimage, the 47th 
of his reign. It will include 10 Mexican cities in eight days, with a stop for 
prayers and jet fuel at the Caribbean island of Curacao on the way home. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexico trip, the third abroad for John Paul this year, in effect begins a 
second round of travel by a Roman pontiff who has seen more of the world than 
all his predecessors combined. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it was with his first trip -- to Mexico in January, 1979, a few months 
after his election -- that John Paul served notice of a new, on-the-move 
papacy. By now, the centuries-old image of an aloof, remote, Rome-bound Pope 
are as dated as chain mail and daguerreotypes. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a Pope who likes walls around him," said Joaquin Navarro, who has 
accompanied John Paul on most of his trips, first as correspondent for a 
Spanish newspaper and later as papal spokesman. "He will not sit in a 
nunciature receiving visitors. He loves personal contact, and he wants five or 
six meetings a day -- not only churches, but also slums, factories, jails." 
</P>
<P>
In its way, that first Mexican trip wrote the rules for all that have followed. 
Important details have changed and organizational details have been smoothed, 
but the practical and theological underpinnings are constants. 
</P>
<P>
This will be John Paul's 10th visit to Latin America, and it is hardly 
coincidental that Latin America is home to nearly 40% of the world's 900 
million Roman Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
John Paul has made it clear that he sees travel as a major means of fulfilling 
his teaching and preaching role as the successor to St. Peter, the first Pope. 
For Catholics, he is a visible sign of their faith, just as his presence is a 
powerful means of cementing local churches to Rome. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite simply," Navarro said, "the Holy Father believes that people all over 
the world have the right to see their Pope, and he has the right to be with his 
people, wherever they are." 
</P>
<P>
No aide would ever say it, but they all understand that the Pope enjoys getting 
away from the strictures of managerial and ceremonial life at the Vatican. 
Here, he is in effect a prisoner in his apostolic palace. If he wants a breath 
of fresh air, he walks on the palace roof. 
</P>
<P>
Often John Paul looks wan and tired when trips begin. But at their arduous end, 
while those in his retinue stagger from the last accursed bus to the blessed 
last plane, he seems perky, refreshed. 
</P>
<P>
John Paul is as hardy as ever, his aides insist, but he is visibly older now, 
more stooped, and his travels are much more carefully packaged. 
</P>
<P>
For a then-inexperienced Vatican, the Pope's first visit to Mexico, survivors 
say, was a masterpiece of disorganization. He had gone principally to address a 
meeting of Latin American bishops wrestling with the implications of the 
activist theology of liberation. 
</P>
<P>
But while he was there, at the urging of Mexican bishops and with the consent 
of his staff, John Paul tried to do too much. He wound up massively 
overprogrammed. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Mexican bishops proposed 19 stops in eight days. Vatican planners, 
by now veterans of a to-the-minute schedule, cut it to 10. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope will get his five or six events a day in Mexico, including a meeting 
with inmates at a penitentiary in Durango. But he will also get at least eight 
hours' rest every night.

POLITICAL ECHOES OF A SHATTERED PAST HAUNT E. GERMANY'S NEW DEMOCRACY

EAST BERLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Students at Humboldt University pass the plaque reminding them that Friedrich 
Engels, co-author of the Communist Manifesto, studied here, and then they face 
another reminder of East Germany's Communist past -- the words of Karl Marx, 
etched in gold on the landing of the ornate marble staircase. The inscription 
reads: 
</P>
<P>
"Philosophers only interpreted the world differently; what is important is to 
change it." 
</P>
<P>
Communism may have officially collapsed months ago in East Germany, but its 
totems remain everywhere -- evidence of a kind of ideological life after death 
that haunts East Germany's fledgling democracy as it journeys toward unity with 
West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
This lingering afterlife reflects a political void, so far filled only by a 
vague German nationalism that powers the drive toward unification. 
</P>
<P>
West Germans may debate unity in dry terms of added value tax and deutschemark 
inflation, but for their East German cousins it means "We are one people." 
</P>
<P>
"The real question is how to pick up the pieces without losing your pride," 
said Juergen Kocka, a professor of history at the Free University in West 
Berlin. "It makes (East Germans) unpredictable." 
</P>
<P>
As East Germans attempt to pick up the pieces, the extent of what remains from 
the past ranges from the startling to the invisible, from the ludicrous to the 
sinister. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist national flag with its hammer and compass insignia still flies 
throughout the country, in plazas and over factories bearing the names of 
countless Communist heroes. 
</P>
<P>
The same insignia was emblazoned on the parliamentary chamber earlier this 
month as East Germany's first non-Communist government was sworn in, a move 
that formally completed the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Or did it? 
</P>
<P>
The new prime minister, Lothar de Maiziere, didn't think so. He forced an 
embarrassing delay by refusing to swear loyalty to the East German constitution 
-- the Communist constitution. 
</P>
<P>
After 30 minutes of confusion, a compromise was reached, under which he and his 
government swore allegiance instead to the East German people. 
</P>
<P>
That the Communist constitution remains in force underscores the benign nature 
of East Germany's political transformation from dictatorship to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the disadvantage of a peaceful revolution," noted Bonn University 
historian Karl-Dieter Bracher. "Not everything gets swept away." 
</P>
<P>
Such collisions of past and present permeate everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
A new exhibit at the prestigious Museum for German History in East Berlin, for 
example, displays a large section of the Berlin Wall as if it were some 
artifact from a bygone era, yet most of the 100-mile-long wall is still very 
much in place. 
</P>
<P>
The infamous State Security apparatus, known as the Stasi, may have been 
officially dismantled, but small groups remain active. At the anti-fascist 
memorial on the city's main thoroughfare, Unter den Linden, the honor guard 
still goose-steps to and fro. 
</P>
<P>
Only the crowd reaction has changed. Youngsters often laugh spontaneously -- a 
response showing that without the backing of raw state power, the goose-step 
becomes ridiculously ungainly. 
</P>
<P>
Only gradually have the symbolic props of Communist rule begun to fall away. 
</P>
<P>
The people of Karl-Marx-Stadt, East Germany's fourth-largest city, decided in a 
referendum last week to restore the city's old name, Chemnitz. The plaque 
outside the country's main trade union headquarters here commemorating the 
"hero workers" who built the Berlin Wall in 1961 has quietly disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
The first tentative reviews have begun of the four decades of Communist rule 
and the 12-year Third Reich. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, East Germans were told for the first time that they share 
responsibility for the Holocaust. Then they learned that Soviet occupation 
forces probably killed thousands of German internees in the first years after 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Other potential disclosures lurk in the central archives in Potsdam. 
</P>
<P>
And as change begins, even the smallest of life's once-solid reference points 
blur. 
</P>

Readers of the Communist Party newspaper Neues Deutschland had barely adjusted 
to advertisements promoting such heresies as private entrepreneurship when they 
got another shock. After being teased for four days by clever but ambiguous 
ads, they learned the identity of the sponsor -- American evangelist Billy 
Graham.

The Parliament of Soviet Armenia voted Thursday to follow the example of rebel 
Lithuania and suspend the spring draft of young men into the Soviet armed 
forces, the unofficial news agency Interfax said. 
</P>
<P>
The move, which seemed certain to anger the Kremlin, was made at a session of 
the Armenian Supreme Soviet (Parliament). 
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers also demanded the guaranteeing of links between the republic and 
the disputed Azerbaijani region of Nagorno-Karabakh. 
</P>
<P>
"The Supreme Soviet of Armenia decided . . . to suspend the spring draft of 
young people in Armenia until the creation of necessary conditions for the 
carrying out of military service for Armenians and guarantees of their safety," 
it said. 
</P>
<P>
Young Armenians, like their fellow recruits from the Baltic republics of 
Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, complain of discrimination and intimidation 
while serving in the Soviet army.

IRAN LIKENS BUSH ADMINISTRATION TO A 'STUBBORN CHILD'

Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani on Thursday branded the Bush 
Administration a "stubborn, frustrated child" for refusing to make a goodwill 
gesture in response to the release of two American hostages in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
His diatribe came before President Bush announced at a press conference in 
Washington that he is looking for "goodwill gestures" he can offer Iran, 
particularly help in uncovering information about four Iranian diplomats 
believed to have been killed in Lebanon in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani also declared in a speech broadcast by Tehran Radio that "Iran does 
not want relations with the United States." 
</P>
<P>
His comments, made in an address to a group of teachers in Tehran, appeared to 
rule out the possibility of a dialogue with the United States after 11 years of 
hostility. 
</P>
<P>
But they also indicated that Rafsanjani, leader of Iran's so-called 
pragmatists, is under mounting pressure from anti-Western radicals angered at 
Iran's role in the release of the two Americans held by pro-Iranian Shiite 
Muslim militants in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Polhill, 55, of New York, was freed April 22. Eight days later, Frank H. 
Reed, 57, of Malden, Mass., was released. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani admitted that the Lebanese groups who freed Polhill and Reed had 
done so "at our suggestion. They could have . . . rejected our advice. But they 
accepted our advice." 
</P>
<P>
Tehran Radio, reporting other parts of Rafsanjani's speech, said Rafsanjani 
likened Washington's initial response to the hostages' release to that of "a 
stubborn, frustrated child."

DIPLOMACY: THE ALLIANCE HOPES TO PERSUADE MOSCOW NOT TO OPPOSE UNIFICATION WHEN 
TALKS OPEN SATURDAY.

NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner moved Thursday to reassure the Soviet 
Union on behalf of the Western alliance that a united German membership in NATO 
would pose no threat. 
</P>
<P>
His statement was viewed here as a way of attempting to ensure that the Kremlin 
will not seek to prevent German reunification at talks opening Saturday in Bonn 
among the two Germanys and the four victorious World War II nations -- the 
Soviet Union, the United States, Britain and France. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no intention of shifting the military balance in Europe to the 
detriment of the Soviet Union," Woerner told a news conference at a meeting of 
the foreign ministers of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization, 
which strongly supported a united Germany on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to take into account the legitimate security of the Soviet Union," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Woerner, a former West German defense minister, spoke after U.S. Secretary of 
State James A. Baker III put forward an American arms proposal to speed up 
talks on reduction or elimination of short-range nuclear weapons in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Woerner and Baker are developing a strategy, according to NATO sources here, 
that would persuade Moscow not to oppose NATO membership for a united Germany 
as the price of that unification. The Soviet Union has repeatedly warned, in 
varying tones and with different voices, that it will not agree to a unified 
Germany becoming a member of the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
However, in a statement that reflected the message he and Baker wish to convey 
to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Woerner declared: 
</P>
<P>
"Our mission is clear. This is not a game of winning or losing: At the end, 
there will only be winners. The Soviet Union will not lose. It will gain -- in 
stability and in security." 
</P>
<P>
Woerner said the American proposal to advance the talks on eliminating 
short-range, land-based nuclear weapons in Europe reinforces NATO's long-held 
assertion that its strategy is "defensive." 
</P>
<P>
West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, after the meeting, also 
backed the Bush Administration's proposals, declaring that they would support 
"Gorbachev's policies," which he approved. 
</P>
<P>
Genscher and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl have chaffed recently under the 
NATO policy of basing short-range missiles -- those with a range of less than 
300 miles -- and even shorter range nuclear-tipped artillery shells in West 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of the U.S.-owned shells, which could only be used to hit what is 
now East German territory, is a potent political issue in West Germany, 
particularly in light of the democratization of East Germany and other 
countries in the old Soviet Bloc and the impending unification of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
NATO's agreement to drop a program of modernizing the short-range Lance nuclear 
missile now deployed and to explore reductions in nuclear artillery would give 
a political boost to the ruling coalition of Christian Democrats that Kohl 
leads and the Free Democrats led by Genscher in the next election, scheduled 
for December. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the prospect of eliminating all short-range nuclear weapons is seen as 
a major offer that could allay Soviet fears of a united Germany being a member 
of NATO. 
</P>
<P>
In a briefing, Genscher pledged that a united Germany would rule out possessing 
any nuclear, biological or chemical weapons. And Woerner raised the possibility 
that eventually NATO would agree not to base any nuclear weapons on German 
soil. 
</P>
<P>
Genscher has been the leading Western political figure to suggest that NATO 
find a way to allow Gorbachev and the marshals of the Soviet military to save 
face despite the virtual collapse of the Warsaw Pact alliance. He has said that 
380,000 Soviet troops now based in East Germany should be allowed as much as 
five years' grace before having to withdraw to the Soviet Union. He has 
advocated that NATO rule out stationing its troops in what is now East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
As one NATO strategist put it here Thursday: "The Soviets have lost the 
ballgame. But we don't want to boot them out of East Germany. We want them to 
be able to leave in a dignified way." 
</P>
<P>
With such proposals, NATO officials hope that Moscow will agree in the talks on 
German unification that a reunified Germany could be a member of the alliance. 
Both Baker and Genscher argued that membership is something a unified Germany 
should be able to decide for itself, together with the other NATO members.

DESPITE RESEARCH, 'GREENHOUSE EFFECT' IS TOUGH TO PROVE; 
</P>
<P>
GLOBAL WARMING: MOST SCIENTISTS ARE CONVINCED IT'S HAPPENING BUT THEIR BELIEF 
SEEMS TO BE BASED MORE ON INTUITION AND GENERAL KNOWLEDGE THAN ON FACTS.

<P>
A recent international survey shows that three-fourths of the scientists 
involved in climate-change research believe that global temperatures already 
are rising in response to civilization's intensification of nature's 
"greenhouse effect." 
</P>
<P>
But in spite of massive research efforts now under way, the conclusion that 
global warming is a reality seems to be heavily based on intuition and general 
knowledge of climate rather than specific research on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer than half of the respondents (41%) said they believe scientific evidence 
now in hand supports the conclusion that accelerated warming of the atmosphere 
is taking place. And 71% said they believe temperature increases over the last 
century are within the range of normal climatic fluctuation. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, to be published next week, was carried out by Global Change 
Environmental Report, an Arlington, Mass., newsletter that mailed 
questionnaires to 1,500 climate change scientists around the world. More than 
330 scientists in 41 countries responded. 
</P>
<P>
The results indicated that the world scientific community is subject to some of 
the same disagreements that for months have divided environmentalists and 
policy-makers. But there was little dispute over the validity of the 
much-discussed phenomenon itself. 
</P>
<P>
Of those surveyed, 96% said they believe the basic greenhouse effect thesis -- 
that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor and 
other trace gases will cause the earth's atmosphere to trap more of the sun's 
heat and raise world temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly two-thirds (65%) said they believe the odds are better than 50-50 that 
global temperatures will rise by three degrees over the next century. 
</P>
<P>
While that is at the lower range of projections now accepted by the United 
Nations-sanctioned Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 89% said they 
consider the threat serious enough to warrant immediate steps to limit carbon 
dioxide emissions. 
</P>
<P>
Brady Hurley, the newsletter editor, said the survey was designed to elicit 
scientific opinion rather than to assess firm conclusions that can be drawn on 
the basis of existing evidence. 
</P>
<P>
For government officials, the global warming debate for the last year has 
focused increasingly on the issue of reducing carbon dioxide emissions from 
fossil fuel combustions. 
</P>
<P>
Several European governments, led by the Netherlands, have adopted plans for 
stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions, followed by outright reduction. The 
Bush Administration has refrained from endorsing such proposals, maintaining 
that it needs more information on the science of climate change and the 
economic impact of carbon dioxide reduction. 
</P>
<P>
At a White House-sponsored conference last month, the Administration found 
itself at odds with European officials who were more interested in discussing 
plans for action than for additional research. 
</P>
<P>
The conference was followed by an international gathering of parliamentarians, 
who urged governments to take steps to combat climate warming, although 
scientists studying computer models still are unable to forecast the regional 
consequences of increased temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
Of the scientists responding to the newsletter survey, 71% said they believe a 
global temperature rise of a few degrees would cause "major detrimental impacts 
for humanity." 
</P>
<P>
Of those, 91% said they would expect changes in rainfall patterns sufficient to 
shift world food production, 88% foresaw a rise in sea levels, and 66% 
predicted an increase in the severity of tropical storms.

Lakes surged over their dams, rivers swelled and highways closed Thursday as a

Although the rainfall eased, forecasters warned that rising water threatened 
more damage. Hundreds of residents around Dallas and Ft. Worth have been chased 
from their flooded homes. 
</P>
<P>
Eight people were injured when a tornado ripped through Paris in northeast 
Texas, demolishing a nightclub, flipping vehicles, uprooting trees and tearing 
up roofs. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the injured were in the nightclub. Their injuries were minor, said Dick 
Boots of the Paris emergency office.

Water covered roads in almost every county in the path of the storm Thursday, 
including U.S. 175, a major Dallas freeway that was closed during the morning 
rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
The west fork of the Trinity River, which flows through Ft. Worth and Dallas, 
was 6 feet over flood stage and rising. 
</P>
<P>
Floodwaters drove scores from their homes in the Trinity River drainage between 
south Dallas and Grand Prairie, and some people had to be rescued by boat and 
helicopter. Thirty families were left temporarily homeless in Grand Prairie, 
where water was up to the roofs.

Texoma Lake on the Texas-Oklahoma border overflowed its emergency spillway late 
Wednesday for the first time since 1957 and remained a foot above the spillway 
level Thursday afternoon.

At least 100 people on the Oklahoma side of the state line fled their homes, 
and 200 were evacuated from below Comanche Dam in Stephens County.

DEFENDANT ADMITS HE LED ATTACK ON JOHN WAYNE DAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a dramatic turnaround, a Burbank man admitted on the witness stand Thursday 
that he led an attack on John Wayne's daughter and her former boyfriend in 
Newport Beach 19 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Jerrel Lee Hintergardt, 38, denied in Orange County Superior Court in Santa 
Ana, however, that he personally beat up Aissa Wayne. He also denied 
prosecutors' claims that the attack was ordered by Wayne's ex-husband, Dr. 
Thomas A. Gionis, who was going through a bitter custody fight with her at the 
time over their 2-year-old daughter. Gionis' trial on similar assault charges 
in the attack is scheduled to begin in June. 
</P>
<P>
Hintergardt, who is standing trial on eight felony counts related to the 1988 
attack on Wayne and her then-boyfriend, Roger W. Luby, admitted that he and 
another man held Wayne and Luby at gunpoint, forced them to the ground and 
handcuffed them. He also admitted he struck Luby hard enough to knock him down 
and then slashed his right Achilles' tendon with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
Hintergardt said he was told by O. Daniel Gal, the private investigator who 
hired him and his accomplice, that it was Luby who was the target -- not Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
"I never meant for anyone to get hurt," Hintergardt testified. "But things just 
got out of control." 
</P>
<P>
Hintergardt's admission that he was involved in the attack on Wayne and Luby 
stunned prosecutors and investigators in the case. Even Hintergardt's own 
lawyer, Todd A. Landgren, had not heard the confession until 15 minutes before 
his client's trial was scheduled to resume Thursday morning, Landgren said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was certainly a shock," Landgren said. "I wish he had said this a year ago. 
He hasn't left me much time to prepare for this."

Wayne, 34, and Luby, 54, both took the witness stand during Hintergardt's trial 
this week and identified him as the leader of the two men who approached them 
with guns as they pulled a car into the garage of Luby's gated estate in Corona 
del Mar just before noon on Oct. 3, 1988. Both testified that it was 
Hintergardt who smashed their faces into the concrete.

NATURE CENTER CHIEF'S SALARY FROZEN 6 MONTHS; 
</P>
<P>
DISCIPLINE: THE HEAD OF THE CHULA VISTA WILDLIFE REFUGE ALSO RECEIVES A WRITTEN 
REPRIMAND FOR SHOOTING TWO MOURNING DOVES AND SEVEN RABBITS.

The director of the Chula Vista Nature Interpretive Center was given a written 
reprimand and his salary was frozen for six months by the city Thursday as 
punishment for shooting two mourning doves and seven rabbits over the last 
three years at the nature conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Stephen Neudecker might also be fined $650 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service for shooting the doves, according to Chula Vista City Manager John 
Goss. 
</P>
<P>
The actions against Neudecker were taken after a two-week city investigation 
into allegations, made by two former nature center employees, that Neudecker 
had shot animals on the center's grounds and in the surrounding wildlife 
refuge. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation by the Fish and Wildlife Service is almost complete, but 
agents there could neither confirm nor deny whether a fine would be imposed. 
</P>
<P>
"He obviously violated our municipal code in terms of discharging a firearm in 
city limits," Goss said. "The actions may have been well-motivated, but they 
were inconsistent with his mission. 
</P>
<P>
"His error in judgment was not in the removing of birds and rabbits on the 
center, but in how he accomplished that removal. His poor judgment has brought 
embarrassment and negative publicity to the Nature Interpretive Center, the 
Bayfront Conservancy Trust and the city," Goss said. 
</P>
<P>
The salary freeze includes all merit and cost-of-living raises, which could 
total "thousands of dollars," Goss said. Neudecker was due for a raise in July. 
</P>
<P>
The city found that Neudecker had killed two mourning doves and seven rabbits 
during his three-year tenure at the center, but did not find evidence to 
support allegations that Neudecker shot at animals from his office window or 
outside the center's boundaries in the Sweetwater Marsh Wildlife Refuge. 
Neudecker previously said he shot the doves, which had flown into the gallery, 
because they were damaging exhibits and he had no other means to remove them. 
He has also said that he shot the rabbits to control overpopulation and to feed 
the center's three captive birds. 
</P>
<P>
According to Goss, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has found Neudecker in 
violation of three federal statutes, including two counts of shooting mourning 
doves, which is prohibited by the Migratory Bird Treaty, and one count of 
possession of a BB gun in a national refuge. 
</P>
<P>
Neudecker will be fined a total of $650 for those violations, said Goss, who 
said he was informed verbally by the Fish and Wildlife Service but has not 
received written confirmation of the fines. 
</P>
<P>
Neudecker felt vindicated by the results of the investigations, saying, "As I 
contended all along, only 5% of the allegations were shown to be true." 
</P>
<P>
"I did what I thought I had to do," Neudecker said Thursday. "My actions were 
not ill-founded nor capricious. I made a mistake and accepted it." 
</P>
<P>
Neudecker said the punishment was appropriate, and that he has "been dealt with 
fairly by the city and the federal investigators." 
</P>
<P>
Neudecker added that he felt he had been "crucified by the media," who, he 
said, blew the situation out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
Goss, in considering what actions to take, consulted with the Bayfront 
Conservancy Trust for four hours last week in closed session. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Cox, chairman of the trust's board, said he felt Goss' actions were 
appropriate and reflected the consensus of the board that some action beyond a 
written reprimand and short of termination was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Neudecker's greatest error was not working in concert with the federal 
wildlife agency and the state wildlife agency," Cox said. "These were isolated 
incidences. If something was occurring on a regular basis, perhaps we would 
have considered something else." 
</P>
<P>
"It's my assessment that the eight members of the board and the volunteers at 
the center support (Neudecker's) efforts," Goss said. "I've received letters 
from volunteers who are very supportive of him. Some don't like what he did, 
but they certainly support his overall performance at the center, and they made 
it very clear to me that they would be upset if he left. 
</P>
<P>
"He immediately admitted the error in judgment, he apologized publicly; in 
three years with the city this is his first major error in judgment, and he has 
the support of the (Bayfront Conservancy Trust) and volunteers at this time, 
even with those actions," Goss said. 
</P>
<P>
In the reprimand, Goss lists seven mandates for Neudecker, including the 
development of an operations manual to formalize all procedures at the center, 
the banning of all firearms from the center and attendance at management and 
supervisory workshops. 
</P>
<P>
The list also states that, "if any future predators are found on the grounds of 
the Nature Interpretive Center . . . any participation you may have with their 
removal should only be under the direction of and cooperation with U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service or California Fish and Game as appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Goss said operations at the center have not been hurt by the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that the investigation is over," said Maureen Witkowski, volunteer 
coordinator at the center. "It's time to get back to the business of having a 
nature center, and one of the best nature centers in the country. We're very 
happy that it's come to a close, and let's go on from there."

TROUBLED GOMPERS SCHOOL RECEIVES AWARD; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: ACTION IS LABELED A "FARCE," AS ONLY A HANDFUL OF TOP STUDENTS WERE 
CONSIDERED IN NAMING IT A DISTINGUISHED STATE SCHOOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
More than a few eyebrows have been raised by San Diego educators since the 
announcement that Gompers Secondary School -- the site of continuing turmoil 
over academics, leadership, and integration issues -- had been named a 
California Distinguished School. 
</P>
<P>
School Board President Kay Davis this week called the award "a farce" in light 
of the troubles at the Southeast San Diego school. 
</P>
<P>
Even city schools Supt. Tom Payzant said the selection, made in mid-April, was 
"ironic" because of more than three years of refereeing parent, teacher and 
principal conflicts at Gompers, although he believes the award indicates that 
the school is not as bad as the critics of its principal and its many 
curriculum changes believe. 
</P>
<P>
Gompers is the district's best-known school, with a tradition of winning 
national academic awards as a result of its high-powered math-science-computer 
magnet designed to attract students from outside the heavily Latino and black 
neighborhood as a way to promote integration. 
</P>
<P>
State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig, who makes the final decision on 
the awards each year, conceded Thursday that the annual process for selecting 
award-winning schools failed to account for the "fluky aspect" of Gompers, a 
7th-through-12th grade school, where almost 60% of the students attend only the 
seventh and eighth grades. 
</P>
<P>
Until this past September, the high school portion of Gompers was a specialty 
science-math-computer magnet restricted to a limited number of students at 
grades 9 through 12 and balanced among various ethnic groups through voluntary 
busing of white students to the school. The junior high was both a large 
regular neighborhood school for resident teen-agers, with a small science-math 
magnet for a limited number of resident students and for bused white students. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Honig's state Education Department used as its major criterion for 
selection only the standardized achievement test scores from the school's 
1988-89 12th-grade class, consisting of 94 magnet students out of more than 
1,300 in all grades. Those senior-year California Achievement Program (CAP) 
scores from late fall 1988 are indeed impressive, with overall scores far above 
both district and state averages in both reading and math. 
</P>
<P>
But the school's CAP scores at grade eight -- reflecting its regular 
junior-high instruction -- have been consistently below both district and state 
averages. Neighborhood parents for years have complained that their children 
received less-than-equal instruction than bused students unless they were 
selected for the small magnet. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the multiyear turmoil surrounding the school has centered on 
controversial attempts by Payzant to extend the high-quality magnet instruction 
to all students, and especially to improve academic performance of Latino and 
black junior-high students by exposing them to magnet teachers and a stronger 
curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
Honig said his department invites a particular school to compete for the annual 
awards after looking at test scores and other data at the individual's school's 
highest grade. Usually that means grade 12 at high schools and grade 8 at 
junior highs. There is no process for considering multiyear data at schools 
such as Gompers, whose students fall across six grades. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a couple of problems with (our award) at Gompers," Honig said 
Thursday. "We looked just at grade 12, and that is a small group of students. 
</P>
<P>
"And, when our people went down there for a site visit, they did not pick up on 
the fact that the numbers of students at the 12th grade are much smaller than 
at the 8th, and therefore went only into certain classes where they did see 
good teaching and good curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
"So I would say that Gompers is getting a distinguished award not for its 
junior high but only for its senior high portion, which (admittedly) is a much 
more narrow portion of kids. Our people just weren't specific enough in their 
review, but they did find a quality high-school education." 
</P>
<P>
The two people selected by Honig's office to make the one-day, on-site visit at 
Gompers said they realize now that perhaps the 12th-grade data does not reflect 
the school's overall academic performance. 
</P>
<P>
"But we both liked what we saw going on, a lot of kids actively engaged in 
learning, a variety of teaching strategies, an excellent race-human relations 
program, in short a school working hard to overcome a lot of problems," Normal 
Carolan, a state education department administrator, said. 
</P>
<P>
"We did learn about problems with the principal, but the state awards program 
doesn't have a special section to consider leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Her colleague, retired administrator John McCoy, said Gompers "is a peculiar 
kind of school, where the 'cream' of students has been selected for the higher 
grades, but I still think that it is a good school, simply because they are 
trying to do a lot of things for students, and with teachers admitting that 
some things they have done are working and others haven't and they have to try 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Honig said his department needs to revamp its selection policy "and look at 
relative numbers and say that, if the center of gravity of a school is at the 
junior high level, then look there. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't think that I should now say, 'Sorry, I'm going to withdraw the 
award.' So we will stick by our guns and say that it is a quality program at 
the high school and won't comment on the junior high level." 
</P>
<P>
Payzant said some people are saying the CAP 12 scores at Gompers reflect "only 
the results of non-resident (white) students left in the school and the 
original magnet." 
</P>
<P>
The senior high class is 36% white, 36% black, 15% Latino, 10% Asian and 3% 
Filipino. The overall school population now is 19% white, 42% black, 24% 
Latino, 12% Asian and 2% Filipino. 
</P>
<P>
"But I do think that there is more going on than that. The award reflects real 
success in the senior-high classes and I don't think it's fair to use" the fact 
that the award is based on limited CAP 12 scores "as one more way to bash 
Gompers." 
</P>
<P>
"Yet I don't want anyone to say this means everything is fine because you can't 
mask the challenge to fully implement the new plan and have neighborhood 
seventh- and eighth-graders develop academically as well." 
</P>
<P>
Although the school's overall 1988-89 CAP 12 reading score was 293 -- 
contrasted with the state score of 248 -- and its math score 333 -- contrasted 
with 256 at the state level -- there were wide variations among ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
White students scored at 411 for reading and 425 for math. But blacks scored 
only 201 in reading and 270 in math, and Latino students scored 184 in reading 
and 202 in math. Asian students scored 288 in reading and 358 in math. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Davis said she fails to see how any school can be called 
distinguished unless "all aspects" are outstanding. "It's simply amazing to me 
that Gompers can qualify if you look at the entire school," Davis said.

DUI PROGRAM AIMS AT LATINOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Protector is coming! But some in the Latino community are wondering who he 
is and why he is here. 
</P>
<P>
Citing statistics that a disproportionate number of Latinos are arrested 
throughout the county by the California Highway Patrol for driving under the 
influence of alcohol, the CHP announced Thursday the start of a public 
awareness campaign aimed specifically at the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
According to the CHP figures, Latinos accounted for 68% of driving under the 
influence (DUI) arrests in the San Diego area (from the border north to Via de 
la Valle) last year. In Oceanside, the ratio was 84%. In the CHP's El Cajon 
sector, it was 35%. In both the Oceanside and El Cajon sectors, the number of 
Latinos arrested rose from 1988's figures. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in Latino arrests and the number of Latinos involved in DUI 
traffic collisions has prompted the CHP to begin the program in San Diego and 
Orange counties, said Max Gallardo, coordinator for Hispanic Public Affairs for 
the CHP. 
</P>
<P>
The figures were drawn by hand-searching two years of arrest reports and 
counting the number of Latino surnames, Gallardo said. 
</P>
<P>
El Protector, better known as CHP Officer Roy Huerta, and four bilingual 
officers will be available to speak to Latinos about rules of the road and the 
consequences of driving under the influence. The officers will also speak to 
students at schools throughout the county, Gallardo said. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP scheduled the kick-off of the program to coincide with the start of the 
Cinco de Mayo festivities throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't expect people to obey the law if they don't know what the law is," 
said John Martinez, a CHP spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
But a number of people who work with Latinos in drunk-driver programs 
throughout the county were skeptical about the figures and the intent of the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Horton, director of the Drinking Driver program for Occupational Health 
Services, a private social services group in San Marcos, urged caution before 
making any conclusions about the program. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a population that is being targeted by the (alcohol) beverage 
industry," Horton said. "So, if you have someone trying to prevent (alcohol) 
abuse -- more power to them." 
</P>
<P>
But, Horton said, there are also other factors that can account for the high 
number of Latinos represented in the arrests. Latinos, particularly those with 
low incomes, may stand out more to law-enforcement officers and therefore may 
account for the high number of arrests. 
</P>
<P>
The drinking driver program run by Occupational Health Services is divided into 
23 groups. Of those, eight are made up of Latinos. The remaining groups are 
made up mostly of Anglos. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Maritza Garcia, director of the drinking driver program for the 
Metropolitan Area Advisory Committee, a private, nonprofit group in Chula 
Vista, echoed Horton's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
In her program there are about 450 clients, of which 35% to 40% are Latinos, 
the rest Anglos and blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Gallardo, the CHP coordinator, was asked about the concerns that Latinos are 
being stereotyped as drunk drivers. 
</P>
<P>
"You can misinterpret this. But we are targeting the population for education 
and information, not law enforcement," he said. "If they (Latinos) didn't know 
the law, they will be informed. . . . There are English-speaking officers out 
there, why shouldn't there be Spanish-speaking officers reaching out to the 
community?"

Just Getting to Know You, Every Little Thing About You 
</P>
<P>
Check out the 17-page, 58-item questionnaire given to prospective jurors in the 
criminal case of the United States of America vs. Richard T. Silberman. 
</P>
<P>
This baby's got it all: short-answer questions, fill-in-the-blank questions, 
yes-no questions, do-you-know-these- people questions, what-about-this 
questions, even essay questions. 
</P>
<P>
All to be completed "under penalty of perjury." 
</P>
<P>
I've seen loan applications that weren't as long. The last time I took a test 
this complex, I got three units of upper-division credit. 
</P>
<P>
The questionnaire asks about education, spouse, offspring, work 
responsibilities, reading and viewing habits, familiarity with law enforcement 
and the courts, knowledge of high finance, general mind-set and name 
recognition of 115 players in the upcoming drama. 
</P>
<P>
I half expected a question about heavy petting on a first date. 
</P>
<P>
Rita Hanscom, associate professor of law at National University, says jury 
questionnaires are increasing, particularly in heavy headline trials. She 
studies these things and does a public seminar with former jurors each year for 
Law Week. 
</P>
<P>
She says questionnaires are a good, but not infallible, way to spot the 
media-bespoiled juror or the rogue who will refuse to deliberate. 
</P>
<P>
And she says most jurors don't mind giving out information: "I've heard jurors 
say they feel cheated if don't get asked about themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Don't get me wrong: I'm not a privacy nut. That's a short slide to paranoia. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe what chaps my lips about the Silberman questionnaire is that it brings 
out the latent Mad magazine in me. Take question 33: 
</P>
<P>
"Have you or has any member of your immediate family ever been employed by a 
brokerage or securities dealer?" 
</P>
<P>
 No, but I had an Uncle Chick who loved to play the horses. I inherited his 
view of risky financial ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope I break even today," he said on his way to the track, "I can sure use 
the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Conclusion: I don't think I'd be a very good juror.

POLICEWOMAN, SUSPECT INJURED IN 36TH STREET SHOOT-OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego policewoman suffered a minor gunshot wound and a suspect was in 
serious condition with eight bullet wounds Thursday after a gun battle between 
narcotics officers and two men inside an East San Diego home. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began at 1:30 p.m., when Officer Cinda R. Jauregui and other 
narcotics officers attempted to serve a search warrant in the 4000 block of 
36th Street, near University Avenue. Police Lt. Greg Clark said officers were 
confronted by two men who fired at least one shot from a .22-caliber rifle. 
</P>
<P>
Jauregui, who police said has been on the force more than 10 years, was shot in 
the left hand. She was taken to Sharp Memorial Hospital, where she underwent 
surgery and was listed in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
The injured suspect, identified as Jorge Gonzales, 25, was listed in serious 
but stable condition Thursday night at Mercy Hospital. Doctors repaired eight 
bullet wounds in his thighs, abdomen, buttocks, groin and hips, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales was charged with possessing a controlled substance and possessing a 
controlled substance for sale, police said. They did not specify what drug was 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
A second suspect, who escaped from the bungalow where the shooting occurred, 
was captured at 5 p.m. Police identified the man as Ruben F. Flores, 21; 
charges against him were pending. 
</P>
<P>
According to Clark, the officers were looking for heroin when they arrived with 
a search warrant. Clark said one of the men fired the rifle at the officers, 
who returned fire. Investigators said they did not know how many shots were 
fired by both sides. A rifle believed to have been used by a suspect was 
recovered in the yard of the residence, and another rifle was found in some 
bushes two houses away, Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic was snarled for about two hours during the incident, as police 
barricaded several blocks on University Avenue, east and west of 36th Street. 
Police also ordered students at nearby Edison Elementary School and Wilson 
Middle School to be kept indoors during the incident, as police surrounded an 
entire block looking for the second suspect. 
</P>
<P>
SWAT officers were called to search the bungalow for the second man. The search 
proved fruitless, and officers began stopping and questioning men in the area 
who resembled the suspect. His capture was announced later in the afternoon, 
but police did not say where he was arrested.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MINOR FLOODING DAMAGES 7 BEVERLY CENTER 
STORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A broken sprinkler main on the seventh floor of the Beverly Center shopping 
mall at La Cienega and Beverly boulevards caused minor damage in seven stores 
Thursday, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire crews responding to a 1:10 p.m. call found water gushing from a sprinkler 
main that apparently had been damaged in a construction accident. The water 
flowed or dripped into three stores on the seventh floor and four shops on the 
sixth. Battalion Chief Larry Schneider said the damage was minimized because 
plastic sheeting was placed over merchandise after the problem was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
All the stores remained open.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SENATOR ASKS FIRM TO PULL GREETING CARD OFF 
SHELVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state lawmaker has asked a Burbank greeting card company to withdraw a card 
from stores that he says is demeaning to victims of sexual assault and to 
women. 
</P>
<P>
The card, printed by The Thought Factory card company, has a drawing of a 
police officer and says: "Prevent sexual assault. Cooperate." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Dan McCorquodale (D-San Jose), who noticed the card while browsing in a 
Santa Clara County store, said this week that he "immediately saw red." 
</P>
<P>
Debra Pierson, sales manager for The Thought Factory, said the firm no longer 
sells the card "because we did feel it was offensive. . . . It had been brought 
to our attention." 
</P>
<P>
But Pierson said the company does not plan to remove the card from retail 
stores because "we never had that big a distribution of it. I can't tell them 
(the stores) to pull it. . . . I don't get into that kind of form of 
censorship."

Divers will reopen the sealed-off hull and main deck and try to patch a leaking 
seam with quick-drying plastic, said Willem G. Boelman of TriNav Shipping, one 
of two Canadian-based companies overseeing the salvage operation. 
</P>
<P>
Salvage workers had been hoping to raise the capsized vessel in its Terminal 
Island berth and sink it at sea to create an artificial reef this week. 
However, they discovered early Thursday morning that the hull was not holding 
enough pressure to keep the vessel afloat. Salvagers say they will try to float 
the ship upside down partly because it will be easier to tow.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DISTRICT WINS PRELIMINARY FUNDING OK FOR 2 
SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles school district officials seeking land for desperately needed 
classroom space are making plans to build elementary schools over a county 
flood control channel in Arleta and in a section of Exposition Park. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed schools would incorporate state-of-the-art technology, such as the 
replacement of student desks with computer stations, said school district 
facilities planner Philippe Yancey-Piens. 
</P>
<P>
The school district has won preliminary approval from the state Allocation 
Board for its application to receive special construction funds to pay for the 
two new schools, district officials said. But carrying out the plans is 
contingent on the availability of the land in Arleta and the approval of the 
museum's board at the Exposition Park site.

JURY SELECTION IN SILBERMAN TRIAL DELAYED BY ILLNESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jury selection in Richard T. Silberman's money-laundering trial was put on hold 
until next week because two of the prominent San Diego businessman's defense 
attorneys became ill, the federal judge hearing the case announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
After seating 28 potential jurors, U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving said 
that formal interviews of that group by prosecutors and defense lawyers will 
resume Tuesday. By then, he said, defense lawyers James J. Brosnahan and Diane 
Amann are expected to recover from food poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
The postponement occurred after Irving announced, out of the presence of 
potential jurors, that he was also putting off -- until the end of the trial -- 
prosecutors' request to sanction Silberman for saying in a television interview 
that he was innocent of all charges. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, 61, who was a top aide to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., faces 
seven felony charges. He is accused of laundering $300,000 that an undercover 
FBI agent characterized as the proceeds of Colombian drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
His trial, which began Tuesday, is expected to last six weeks. If convicted, 
Silberman could face up to 75 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
When jury selection resumed Thursday, Irving dismissed six potential jurors who 
indicated in a special questionnaire that they already had formed an opinion 
about the case and two who didn't answer whether they had an opinion. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also dismissed a number of other potential jurors who said they had 
thought about the case since Tuesday and decided that they also had formed 
opinions about it. It was not known what the opinions might be. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors, who were cautioned Tuesday not to read newspaper stories or watch 
television accounts of the case, were not made aware in court of that 
prosecutors' contention that Silberman should be found in contempt of court for 
talking about the case to NBC cameras. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder Jr. asked for sanctions Wednesday, 
saying Silberman's comments violated a partial gag order imposed March 1. The 
order bars Silberman and the lawyers from talking about various matters, 
including the strength or weakness of either side's case. 
</P>
<P>
In the interview, which aired Tuesday on NBC's San Diego affiliate, KNSD 
(Channel 39), Silberman said FBI agents and prosecutors had made a mistake by 
charging him, insisted he was innocent and predicted the jury would agree with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Irving said Thursday after reviewing a tape of the interview that, if Gorder 
wants to pursue the issue, the time to do it was after the trial, through a 
formal, written request for sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Before taking ill, Brosnahan told Irving that Silberman had a free-speech right 
to talk about his case, even if there was a gag order.

JUDGE REJECTS CLAIMS OF THE SEX CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A religious group that claimed to absolve the sins of male worshipers by sexual 
intercourse with a female priestess is nothing more than a scam intended to 
hide the operation of a brothel, a federal judge said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge William M. Byrne Jr. rejected arguments by Will and Mary 
Ellen Tracy of Canyon Country, who filed a civil suit to prevent the Los 
Angeles Police Department and city attorney's office from investigating or 
prosecuting their Church of the Most High Goddess. 
</P>
<P>
The Tracys, convicted of prostitution charges last September, said U.S. 
constitutional guarantees protect the practice of what they claimed were 
ancient religious rites. 
</P>
<P>
During six days of testimony, Will Tracy, 52, said he received a revelation 
from God in 1984 to re-establish a religion he says was practiced in ancient 
Egypt. According to the revelation, his wife was required to have sex with 
1,000 men to achieve her status as high priestess of the church. 
</P>
<P>
"I find that their testimony is incredible," Byrne said in his ruling. "The 
religion had really no basis to it other than sexual conduct." 
</P>
<P>
Male worshipers were required to make donations of cash or services to the 
church to participate in the rituals. The Tracys, who acted as their own 
attorneys, called the donations religious sacrifices. They said they received 
about $50,000 in donations in three years while operating the church in houses 
in West Los Angeles and Silver Lake. 
</P>
<P>
The issue before the court, Byrne said, was not whether the religion exists. 
But he could rule, the judge said, on whether the Tracys exhibited a sincere 
belief in the doctrine they preached. 
</P>
<P>
"I find that each of the plaintiffs does not have a sincere belief," he said, 
calling the church "nothing but a shield" to protect the couple from 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne noted that Mary Ellen Tracy, 47, ran ads in sexually explicit newspapers 
saying, "I love sex," and soliciting men for "hedonistic" rites. The couple 
said the ads merely expressed Mary Ellen Tracy's open attitude toward sex. 
</P>
<P>
"We find nothing wrong with sex," Will Tracy said. "Sex is a gift from God." 
</P>
<P>
Byrne also said that even if the Tracys were sincere in their beliefs -- and he 
conceded that was a possibility -- there is a compelling public interest to 
control such activities, regardless of the religious intent. 
</P>
<P>
He cited a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling against two Indian drug counselors 
who were fired from their jobs after admitting they had taken peyote in what 
they said were ancient religious rituals. The court held that the Constitution 
does not permit people to break the law in the name of religious freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom, Will Tracy said: "This means there is no religious 
defense in federal court." He called the judge's ruling "appalling" and 
promised to appeal.

STATE GOES AFTER TERM-PAPER MILL THAT BOUGHT ADS IN DAILY AZTEC; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE: ATTORNEY GENERAL SEEKS INJUNCTION AGAINST FIRM FOR VIOLATING STATE 
EDUCATION CODE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. JEANNETTE AVENT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suit has been filed against a Los Angeles company that advertised term-paper 
writing services for a fee in the San Diego State University student newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in San Diego Superior Court by Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp on 
Tuesday, seeks a court injunction barring the firm from selling term papers for 
academic credit. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that the company, Research Assistance &amp; Student Marketing 
Service, a partnership owned by Barton Lowe and Arthur W. Stekel, advertised in 
the Daily Aztec over a two-month period last year, offering custom research and 
research papers for sale, in violation of the state Education Code. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed on behalf of California State University trustees, follows a 
similar suit filed last week by Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner 
against the same company. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the suit had not yet been served against the defendants, and Lowe 
and Stekel were unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint follows an undercover sting investigation jointly conducted by 
the attorney general's office and the university's public safety department, 
said Deputy Atty. Gen. Kathleen B.Y. Lam on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The code prohibits the marketing of research papers for a fee if the vendor 
"should reasonably have known, that such term paper, thesis, dissertation or 
other written material is to be submitted by any other person for academic 
credit." 
</P>
<P>
Since December, the firm has completed at least one paper for investigators 
with the knowledge that the paper was to be used by the buyer for academic 
credit at SDSU, the suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
Lam declined to discuss the undercover operation, saying the suit had not yet 
been served on the defendants, but she said students had purchased papers from 
the company as well. The suit seeks unspecified actual and punitive damages, 
and payment for the cost of the suit. 
</P>
<P>
"Over several years, a lot of campuses have experienced the problem of 
term-paper mills trying to pawn off their work as student work and advertising 
in student newspapers," said Vice Chancellor Mayer Chapman, general counsel for 
the state universities. 
</P>
<P>
"The education code says it's unlawful and should be enjoined. It really 
strikes at the heart of the education process," Chapman said. "It subverts the 
whole education process. It deprives students of the experience of learning how 
to do research and organize their work. That's what education is all about -- 
being able to put your thoughts together and communicate them to someone else." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Car, SDSU's judicial coordinator in charge of student discipline, said 
his office has received complaints from the Academic Senate about the ads, but 
nobody has officially turned in a student for pawning off one of the company's 
papers as his own. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has reported that to me. It should have been if it happened." 
</P>
<P>
Cal State officials said they will attempt to obtain the names of CSU students 
who bought the papers from the company's client list. 
</P>
<P>
The company named in the suit is no longer advertising its services in the 
Daily Aztec, said the paper's editor, Jon Petersen. But the paper's editorial 
board confirmed the paper's policy to continue accepting any advertisement for 
legal products or services about two weeks ago, said Petersen. The policy is 
set by the student board and approved by the university's Communications 
Authority board, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Petersen said companies offering research services have been operating for 
years and have not been shut down. "If the attorney general or courts determine 
it is illegal, they should shut the businesses down, and we won't run the ads 
any more." 
</P>
<P>
Petersen said that, although he personally feels there is something shady about 
a firm that promises not to sell the same paper at a school for two years, 
research firms do perform a service as a bibliography source or starting point 
for research. "There's nothing wrong with that," he said. "We're not 
responsible if students misuse the service." 
</P>
<P>
The paper's advertising coordinator confirmed that Research Assistance was no 
longer advertising with the paper, but it had since begun accepting ads from 
another Los Angeles research company. 
</P>
<P>
"Research Assistance told our sales representative in August it was becoming 
too much trouble to advertise in the Aztec," said Matthew Dathe. "They were 
getting too much heat from it. 
</P>
<P>
"We were upset because we had put a lot on the line defending their right to 
advertise with us. When I was editor, we got a lot of heat (for) running the 
ads. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We can't control the end use of any products advertised. Alcohol can be 
detrimental to the educational process, but we don't prohibit alcohol ads. If 
we ran an ad for guns, it'd be the same thing. If people are going to cheat, 
they're going to cheat." 
</P>
<P>
The paper, which is supported by about $750,000 in annual advertising revenues, 
falls under the domain of the Associated Student Body, said university 
spokesman Rick Moore. 
</P>
<P>
The university provides building space and electricity but does not contribute 
to the paper, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The faculty has been very firm in its feeling that the research services should 
not be advertised, but the Communications Authority board, which includes 
university officials, has sought not to interfere with the student board's 
decisions on advertising products which are not illegal, he said.

A STRIP SHOW CAR OWNERS WON'T FORGET

It took three professionals 11 minutes and 24 seconds to disassemble a stolen 
1985 Chevy Monte Carlo in front of a crowd of about 300 in downtown San Diego 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The three men were body shop repairmen from Detroit, participating in a 
demonstration sponsored by Allstate Insurance. Allstate has staged similar 
demonstrations over the last few months in several major cities to show how 
quickly thieves can dismantle cars. The company also provides tips for auto 
theft prevention. 
</P>
<P>
One of the repairmen, Ken Mayry, said the average time it takes for a single 
thief to dismantle a vehicle, using high powered tools, is 12 to 15 minutes. 
But, on Thursday, it took three repairmen 11 minutes using hand tools, such as 
cutting snippers, jackknives and wrenches to take apart the car. 
</P>
<P>
The midnight-blue car used in the illustration had been stolen from a San Diego 
resident and recovered by Allstate months later. Before the demonstration, it 
was worth $4,736. But, after the disassembled parts were scattered on the 
concourse of the Security Pacific Plaza Office Building at 3rd Avenue and B 
Street, they were worth $10,489, according to Allstate. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a $7-billion-a-year business in the U.S., and a $1-billion-a-year 
business in California alone," said Chuck Martin, regional vice president for 
Allstate. "About 1.4 million cars are stolen each year in the United States. . 
. . In California, almost 190,000 cars disappear annually, and 40,896 of those 
are in San Diego County alone. From 1985 to 1989, vehicle theft in San Diego 
has tripled." 
</P>
<P>
Martin said the thieves typically take the stolen vehicles to "chop shops," 
where parts are stripped off. 
</P>
<P>
John Graham, a crime prevention specialist for the San Diego Police Department, 
encouraged residents to enroll in Combat Auto Theft, a nationwide theft 
prevention program that organized in San Diego last year. The voluntary program 
allows owners to sign a waiver giving police the right to stop the vehicle from 
1 a.m. to 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the theft prevention tips Allstate provided were to park in 
well-lighted areas; lock doors and windows; never leave keys in a car; keep 
packages and valuables hidden; remove the title from the vehicle and use a 
security system.

BRADLEY PUTS LID ON WATER USE AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In announcing his call for mandatory water rationing, Mayor Tom Bradley said 
"it's easy" to cut usage by 10%. 
</P>
<P>
And apparently, the mayor spoke from experience. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, the Bradley household has cut its water use by 29.2%, according to 
Department of Water and Power records obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the mayor said Bradley and his wife have installed low-flow 
shower heads, put bricks in toilet tanks and began using a "deep soak" 
landscape irrigation system to reduce their water use. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor also saves a little water by having his car washed at the City Hall 
garage. 
</P>
<P>
But otherwise, Bradley said he has taken no extraordinary steps to cut usage. 
</P>
<P>
Getty House, the mayor's city-owned residence, is a 12-room, four-bedroom, 
three-bath home in the Hancock Park area of Los Angeles. The mayor often 
entertains visiting dignitaries and maintains extensive gardens. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, his total water usage is about three times that of the average Los 
Angeles household. 
</P>
<P>
During 1989, the Bradley household used about 1,300 gallons of water a day, 
compared to 300 to 500 gallons a day in the average household. 
</P>
<P>
But the mayor has vowed to cut his use further. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care how much you have saved, you can always save more," a spokesman 
quoted Bradley as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley urged city residents in March to voluntarily cut usage by 10%. "I told 
my gardener that morning I wanted him to cut watering at Getty House by 
one-third," the mayor said, according to a spokesman. FREDERICK M. MUIR

<P>
A 19-year-old man has been arrested in an attempted rape, burglary and assault 
in Vista, the Sheriff's Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
Gale P. Lancaster of Vista was arrested Wednesday and is being held on $15,000 
bail in the County Jail in Vista on suspicion of first-degree burglary, assault 
with a deadly weapon and assault with intent to rape in connection with an 
April 23 attack on a woman at her Vista home. She reportedly said he pulled out 
a knife while they were on her patio, forced her into her residence, and 
attempted to take her upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
They struggled, and the man fled when she screamed, but not before slashing her 
clothes, officials said.

<P>
A thief who is suspected of robbing several banks in San Diego County entered a 
Point Loma bank Thursday and left with $1,643, police said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 13th bank the robber has hit since Feb. 8, said police spokesman 
Bill Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
The thief walked into Home Federal Bank in the 1100 block of Rosecrans 
Boulevard at 9:50 a.m. and gave the teller a note saying he had a gun and 
wanted money, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The robber is described as black, in his late 20s or early 30s, between 
5-foot-7, and 5-foot-9, and weighing 150 to 165 pounds. He usually wears a dark 
blue suit and sunglasses, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The robber was last seen walking west on Addison Street.

Legislation intended to provide a "cease-fire" in the seemingly endless 
bureaucratic brawls over Southern California transportation issues was 
unanimously approved Thursday by the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), is a first step toward the 
merger of the Los Angeles region's two embattled transit agencies -- the 
Southern California Rapid Transit District and the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Political turf fights between the two agencies are legendary, but efforts to 
reorganize them have met with failure. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) said the Katz proposal "provides a cease-fire in 
the wars. . . . There is finally light at the end of the tunnel." The bill was 
returned to the Assembly for concurrence in Senate amendments. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, basically a legislative ratification of a compromise reached by local 
officials, would allow Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, his appointee and the 
five Los Angeles County supervisors to serve on boards of both the Rapid 
Transit District and the Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor and the supervisors would be required to attend four joint meetings 
of the two agencies each year instead of sending pinch-hitters. It also directs 
the two agencies to approve a consolidation plan by 1992.

<P>
'SEEING PLACE' HAS MESSAGE ON EDUCATION OF THE DEAF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Howie Seago, the deaf actor who received much critical acclaim in the La Jolla 
Playhouse productions of "Ajax" and "The Tempest" a few years back, will star 
in a new play, "Seeing Place." It was written by his old friend Rico Peterson 
and will run at the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art tonight and Saturday 
only. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson last teamed up with Seago in 1978 with a show called "Frozen Dinner 
Theater," commissioned by the National Assn. for the Deaf, and presented at the 
Hotel del Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
"Seeing Place," about the education of deaf children, should hit close to home 
for Seago, who plays the adult product of the educational system for the deaf; 
Peterson said he based some of the play on Seago's own experiences. 
</P>
<P>
The production will also be a family affair. Peterson's wife, Freda Norman, a 
deaf actress, will play a hearing instructor of the deaf. Seago's son, Ryan, 
will play Seago's character at age 4, and Peterson's son, Niko, will play 
Seago's character at 9. Peterson will not only direct, he will act the part of 
a woman who is developing a computerized system for writing sign language down 
on paper. 
</P>
<P>
The play stirred up some controversy in its very first production, which was 
just last week at California State University, Northridge, Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Deaf Hollywood hated it," he said. "We're pointing fingers at a process which 
doesn't work. We say things that make people uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
One sacred cow that Peterson attacks is mainstreaming -- sending deaf children 
to hearing schools and expecting them to keep up. Peterson said the result is 
that the children are "shunted off to the side" and it's not unusual for bright 
deaf children to end up graduating high school with a fourth- or fifth-grade 
education because regular teachers don't know how to work with them. Another 
problem he sees is the lack of work for deaf actors; he cites Seago and his 
wife as prime examples. 
</P>
<P>
Most of "Seeing Place" will be simultaneously spoken and signed, except for a 
few passages, including one with an elderly deaf couple, that is signed only. 
Synopses of those passages will be provided in the program. 
</P>
<P>
Another new play having a world premiere tonight is "First Star," a musical by 
the young New York team of Mitchell Ivers and Steven Lutvak. 
</P>
<P>
Lutvak, who wrote the music and co-wrote the lyrics, has been nominated for a 
Drama Desk Award for his musical, "Hanna Senesh," which played off Broadway at 
the Cherry Lane Theatre and continues to tour the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"First Star," which follows the fortunes of the first acting troupe in America, 
the Hallam Company, will bring an interesting experiment full circle when it 
makes its debut at San Diego State University's Don Powell Theatre, where it 
plays through May 12. 
</P>
<P>
Director Robert Chapel, chairman of the SDSU musical theater program, had been 
involved in developing musical theater when he taught at New York University, 
the same place where Ivers and Lutvak got their training. Knowing the often 
prohibitively high costs of developing a new musical, he offered the team the 
opportunity to develop the musical at SDSU where the two-stage process, 
beginning with a workshop production and ending with the current, fully staged 
show, wouldn't cost much more than any other show on the university's budget. 
</P>
<P>
"First Star" will star California Ballet principal and Three's Company founder 
Patrick Nollet as actor Thomas Wignell. 
</P>
<P>
Two days before opening night, Ivers sounded nervous but extremely happy; he 
and Lutvak have already put in several years on this project. 
</P>
<P>
"Every once in a while I look at it and I can't believe it's going to be up on 
stage with a 17-piece orchestra and a massive set. It's really been a terrific 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
If you're looking for a theatrical way to celebrate Cinco de Mayo, the Mexican 
celebration of a victory over the French, check out Mascara Magica, a 
2-year-old ensemble which will present a comic performance piece called "Cinco 
de Mayo" at the underground stage in the lower lobby of the Lyceum Theatre at 
10:30 p.m. Admission is free. 
</P>
<P>
Also, on Saturday the cast of Latins Anonymous, the comedy which will open the 
San Diego Repertory Theatre's season, will perform at the Cinco de Mayo 
celebration in Vista, appearing at the Moonlight Amphitheater at 3:45 p.m. They 
will also perform for the Chicano Federation's 25th Anniversary Gala at the 
Convention Center later in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Next Friday only, "Cafe Con Leche," a Spanish production by the 22-year old 
Obie award winning company, Repertorio Espanol, will be presented in Spanish at 
Mandeville Auditorium at UC San Diego at 8 p.m. The title, which means "Coffee 
with Milk," is used as a metaphor for a Cuban family's struggle to maintain its 
cultural integrity in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
PROGRAM NOTES: The new Geoff Hoyle play at the La Jolla Playhouse now has a 
name: "Don Quixote De La Jolla." The show, written by Eric Overmyer for a 
company of five, including Hoyle, will be a twist on "Don Quixote," Miguel de 
Cervantes' 17-Century novel. Directed by Stan Wojewodski Jr., it will play Aug. 
12-Sept. 16 in the Warren Theatre. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Comic Opera Company has finished its season with a surplus going 
thanks to a successful run of "The Gondoliers." Next up for the formerly named 
San Diego Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Company will be the company's first season to 
deviate from Gilbert &amp; Sullivan fare. The season includes "The Beggars 
Opera," Sept. 14-23; Exposition Band Concert circa 1915, Oct. 5-7; "Rose 
Marie," April 4-7, and "H.M.S. Pinafore," June 21-30. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Memories: Don and Bonnie Ward, co-artistic directors of the Starlight Musical 
Theatre, will have cameo parts in their season opener, "Follies," opening May 
24 at the San Diego Civic Theatre. The long-married couple and former dancing 
team play Vincent and Vanessa, semi-retired dancers who have bought a Arthur 
Murray-like franchise. They perform one dance number with two young actors 
playing the ghosts of their youth dancing behind them. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Diversionary Theatre and Thomas Vegh, the former artistic director of the 
theater, will both be opening productions on the same night: May 12. 
Diversionary will present Jane Chambers' "A Late Snow," focusing on the tangled 
relationships of five women trapped in a cabin in the snow, continuing Fridays 
and Saturdays through May at 2222 Broadway. Vegh will be directing "Murder at 
Cafe Noir," presented by the Mystery Cafe, the San Diego debut of a national 
interactive murder/mystery dinner theater at the Imperial House Restaurant 
uptown. "Murder at Cafe Noir," an interactive murder mystery, in which the 
audience interacts with the actors (who serve the dinner) and helps choose the 
direction the play will take, also runs Fridays and Saturdays at 8 for an 
open-ended run.

HOME TECH / VIDEOS: RENTAL PRICES MAY INCREASE DURING THE NEXT FEW MONTHS; 
</P>
<P>
CASSETTES: SOME DISTRIBUTORS ARE RAISING WHOLESALE CHARGES. IF MORE FOLLOW 
SUIT, THE INCREASES WILL BE PASSED ON TO THE CONSUMERS, THE HEAD OF A VIDEO 
CHAIN SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Is a rental price hike looming for home video customers? 
</P>
<P>
Several prominent retail chain executive thinks so, predicting that many stores 
will jack up rental fees by the end of the year. Others rule it out for now but 
concede that, if certain factors change, it's possible in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for this gloomy speculation is a recent increase in the wholesale 
price of cassettes -- in the 3%-4% range -- implemented by major video 
companies such as Paramount, MCA/Universal, Warner and RCA/Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
If more manufacturers follow suit, a price hike to consumers is inevitable, 
said Allan Caplan, who heads the Midwest's Applause Video chain. "If profits 
are dropping, where else can the retailer get more money?" 
</P>
<P>
And in the view of Mitch Perliss, Music Plus' director of purchasing, more 
wholesale price increases can be expected, probably in the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
Video manufacturing executives claim that they have no choice but to increase 
wholesale prices, citing rising marketing and production costs at a time when 
the demand for rental titles has leveled off. In the past they might have 
compensated for rising costs by shipping more units, but the rental market 
didn't grow last quarter and is considered too soft for that strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"People are renting less right now," Perliss said. "Rental revenues aren't 
increasing but other expenses are." 
</P>
<P>
Many retailers are resisting the idea of boosting their rental fees, however. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Castell, senior vice president of the mammoth Blockbuster chain, said that 
he didn't see any price hikes in his company's future. "Raising prices just 
alienates customers," he explained. "They don't want to know your financial 
problems. All they know is you've just raised the rental price, so they'll rent 
less often or go somewhere cheaper." 
</P>
<P>
Tower's product manager, John Thrasher, said that his chain won't be raising 
prices -- for now at least. "The market is incredibly competitive," he said. 
"You can't risk losing customers by raising prices." 
</P>
<P>
Arguing for the rental-price rise, Caplan said: "People forget that the rental 
price has been steady for the last few year. Other prices -- like the price of 
movie tickets -- have gone up but rental prices have stayed the same. The 
average price is about $2.50 but some of the better stores charge $2.99." 
</P>
<P>
Caplan is an advocate of tiered pricing -- charging more for the first few 
months for the new hits, say $3.50, but charging $2.50 for older titles. 
</P>
<P>
Tower's Thrasher hates that idea. "It confuses the consumer," he insisted. 
"Besides, whatever is cheapest to rent isn't what the people want. So they're 
getting a bargain on movies they don't want to rent." 
</P>
<P>
Retailers have other options besides raising rental prices, such as buying 
fewer copies of each title or buying the hits in regular numbers but cutting 
down the purchase of B titles. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're a small store and you buy less copies of a big hit, you risk not 
having enough for your customers," explained Castell. "So you decide not to buy 
certain B titles that wouldn't rent too often anyway. I can see the companies 
that put out the B titles getting hurt in this price-increase crunch."

SINGLE LIFE: KARMIC ASTROLOGER TAPS THE LESSONS OF PAST LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EVAN CUMMINGS, Evan Cummings is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Astrology is not a science. It has not held up under any controlled experiment 
or statistical analysis. Nevertheless, more people believe in astrology now 
than at any time since the Renaissance, wrote Roger Culver in "The Gemini 
Syndrome," a 1979 book debunking astrology. 
</P>
<P>
Culver and other non-believers say astrology's popularity derives from people's 
feeling that much of their life is out of their control and that they have a 
need to believe in some mysterious, higher force. Astrology connects their 
lives with the cosmos, making them part of a divine plan. It offers guidance, 
hope and perhaps a blueprint to the future pertaining to finances and 
relationships. And it absolves them of personal responsibility; instead, the 
blame is placed on the stars, a past life or the psychic spirits. 
</P>
<P>
Astrology began 5,000 years ago when man was huddled by the campfire, afraid of 
the night. Any measure of control was comforting. 
</P>
<P>
The fundamental thesis of astrology is that the pull of the sun, moon, planets 
and stars somehow influence our lives based on the date, time and place of our 
birth. Personal and professional decisions, say proponents of the ancient "soft 
science," made in tandem with planetary aspects, can decrease negative trends 
and capitalize on positive ones. 
</P>
<P>
Many scientific experiments have tested the validity of astrology and the 
results are always that it contradicts reality. Although individuals born under 
certain signs are supposed to be more likely to have personalities best suited 
to be, say, politicians or scientists, a thorough study of the listings in 
"American Men of Science" or "Who's Who in American Politics" shows that the 
distribution of birthdays is random, covering all signs. Similar tests were 
conducted to see if couples whose signs were "compatible" divorced less often 
than "incompatible" couples, but they seem to do it just as often. 
</P>
<P>
Another study conducted with assistance from the National Council for Geocosmic 
Research showed astrologers blow a prediction two times out of three. 
</P>
<P>
Still people believe in astrology. 
</P>
<P>
There's Nancy Reagan, Abraham Lincoln and . . . sometimes me. 
</P>
<P>
Was it possible that my past had caught up with me? A recent session with 
karmic astrologer E.J. McVay had me wondering. She believes that the past and 
present are of equal importance in predicting trends and cycles that shape our 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
The astrologer, who holds a steadfast belief in reincarnation, contends that 
knowledge of past events in this life and past lives can lend insights to help 
us achieve professional success and personal serenity. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference between conventional astrology and karmic astrology is the 
concept that much of what we did in a past life is repeated in this one. To 
grow, we must flow with the lessons from those past lives and learn necessary 
lessons to make the present life better. We should be striving to be our 
highest and best self. Karmic astrology can help us accomplish that goal," says 
McVay, who counsels clients at the Center for Health &amp; Well-Being, a 
holistic health clinic in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Many of McVay's clients are single people who are looking for love and for ways 
to make it last. 
</P>
<P>
McVay dismisses magazine and newspaper astrology columns as too general. "All 
people of the same sign do not experience the same events, feelings, 
frustrations and successes any more than all people from Texas or New York are 
the same because they speak with a similar accent. Obviously each person from 
one place or the other has their own unique personality. It's the same with 
astrology." 
</P>
<P>
Determining a person's past life helps her be more specific. 
</P>
<P>
During our one-hour consultation, in which she held in her hand a computer 
printout of my sign based on the time, day and year I was born, I only revealed 
one other thing about myself: my occupation. 
</P>
<P>
She glanced at my chart and looked puzzled. Childhood aspects in my chart, she 
said, indicated a flurry of parental activity and confusion. Were my parents 
living? 
</P>
<P>
I hesitated in telling her the truth. I was adopted when I was 3 and my 
adoptive parents died when I was a teen-ager. As for my biological parents, my 
father is deceased and my mother's whereabouts are unknown. E.J. seemed to have 
me there. 
</P>
<P>
She was also right in describing my personality, and she correctly told me of a 
recent artistic project I'm working on and the short-distance move associated 
with it. I breathed a sigh of relief when she predicted that it would be a 
success and that that would lead to greater success. 
</P>
<P>
That was great news, but I was curious about other matters. "Tell me about 
love," I begged. She forecasted that I would be seriously involved by August 
and married by 1991 and that I would travel across country because of my 
romance. 
</P>
<P>
More good news. I hope either prediction comes to pass. Travel and romance have 
eluded me lately. 
</P>
<P>
Karmic astrology can explain, says McVay, why a person tends to run up against 
the same or similar obstacles repeatedly throughout life. But can it explain 
why people keep choosing the wrong mates, or some people have multiple 
marriages or relationships? 
</P>
<P>
"An individual's karma is shaped by their previous lives; their soul did not 
learn all the lessons it needed to learn to excel to a higher plane and 
experience a harmonious relationship," McVay says. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike conventional astrologers, many of whom believe that individuals with 
conflicting charts cannot coexist, McVay believes that her role is not to judge 
but rather to assist those people in bringing about harmony within their 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not for me to tell people whom they should be with. That is their 
decision. If they are attracted to each other, if they have chosen to be 
together, there is a reason, a lesson they must learn," McVay says. "My job is 
to enlighten them, helping them create the best relationship possible while 
they are together learning those lessons." 
</P>
<P>
Although I was pleased with my reading, I have reservations about the 
reincarnation and karma concept. Doesn't a belief in reincarnation and karma 
excuse people for poor behavior? If you know that your soul has another chance, 
isn't there a tendency for people to think that they can do anything they want 
because these are necessary steps to reaching a higher plane? 
</P>
<P>
McVay disagrees. "It doesn't excuse anything because each individual reaps what 
he sows. If a person chooses the wrong mate or breaks the law, he or she will 
pay for it sooner or later on this physical plane, and later in the next life. 
The universe isn't out to deal you trouble. It only deals trouble for trouble. 
If your choice is peace, you're going to have peace and if your choice is 
trouble, you're going to have trouble."

The Huntington Harbor League of Interval House -- a temporary shelter for 
battered women and their children -- held its fifth annual golf tournament 
Monday at the Seacliff Country Club in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 golfers (and a few self-designated "hackers") showed up for 
mid-morning registration despite high winds, storm clouds massed overhead and a 
few ominous raindrops. Their reward came shortly before tee time when the 
clouds parted on a big belly of sky blue -- just like in the movies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Look 
</P>
<P>
Sure they wore pastels and white belts and checked pants and colors not found 
in nature. Whattya want? This is golf we're talking about here -- the links 
look -- not couture. Sue Middleton garnered all the available style points with 
a black top, black socks, and floral-print black cotton knickers in between. 
Homemade knickers, at that. "I got the pants and chopped 'em off," said 
Middleton, an Interval House volunteer and twice-weekly golfer. Dropping a few 
orange golf balls onto the putting green, Middleton called her outfit 
"old-fashioned, with a new twist." Then she laughed. "Do you think I should 
have gotten balls to match?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Check In 
</P>
<P>
Golfers started showing up an hour before the 11:30 a.m. tee time to check 
their names off the list at registration and pick up a bag of "goodies" (an 
Interval House sun visor, a box of golf balls, ball cleaner, divot marker and a 
towel). They could also buy a couple of "mulligans" for $5 each. (A mulligan is 
a free shot -- a "do-over" -- and the raffle tickets signifying 
get-out-of-a-bunker free were as popular as medieval indulgences.) 
</P>
<P>
"Can I buy a few extra?" begged Norm Davidson, who played with a foursome from 
the Los Alamitos Medical Center. "Please." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Popping the Question 
</P>
<P>
What's your handicap? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm more of a hacker," said Davidson, who teed off with colleagues Doug Meyer, 
Lindy Beck and Jerry Levy. 
</P>
<P>
"Sixteen," said Ed Strickler of Huntington Harbor, who golfed with neighbors 
Earl Belk, Bob Clouse and Leonard Lady. 
</P>
<P>
"Fifteen," said Spencer Sheldon, who works in the Huntington Beach office of 
Signal Landmark, a development company that partially underwrote the 
tournament. Sheldon's foursome included Jim Silva, Paul Cook and Bob Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"You asked the magical question," said Ed Zarp, loading his clubs on a cart 
with golf buddy Bob Stellrecht, "but I'm not saying." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Bottom Line 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Harbor League was founded five years ago to raise money to buy 
and maintain furnishings for the Interval House shelter. The tournament and 
awards dinner on Monday evening raised an estimated $18,000, said Chris 
Frejlach, who chaired the event. Proceeds will be used to decorate and furnish 
a new facility purchased by Interval House late last year, she said.

3 CITIES JOIN TOGETHER TO REDUCE TRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PSYCHE PASCUAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three eastern Ventura County cities, grappling with a state-mandated deadline 
to cut down their garbage by 25% in the next five years, have united to tackle 
their trash problems. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark, Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks want the Ventura County Solid Waste 
Management Department to join in a $500,000 program designed to reduce the 
massive amounts of garbage dumped each year into landfills. 
</P>
<P>
To finance the effort, the cities are asking that dumping fees at the Simi 
Valley Landfill be increased to pay for a trash generation study, recycling and 
public education programs. The suggested fee increase is $1.40 per ton imposed 
over the next year, an official said. 
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that cities in the county have banded together to plan 
recycling efforts that will cross their boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to bury ourselves in waste if we don't do anything about it," said 
Moorpark Mayor Paul Lawrason, a member of the task force planning the effort. 
"This is a method of getting the work done on a shared basis." 
</P>
<P>
Because Moorpark is too small to assign a full-time staff person to carry out 
an independent recycling program, it will benefit from a joint planning effort, 
Lawrason said. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark council members tentatively agreed to back the plan Wednesday night 
and are expected to formally approve an agreement with the county to share 
waste management efforts when the council meets May 16. 
</P>
<P>
The Simi Valley City Council is scheduled to consider the same plan next 
Monday. The Thousand Oaks City Council will take up the matter at its May 15 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Under the state law, cities are required to conduct a study of the waste 
generated by commercial and industrial users and residential households. 
</P>
<P>
Reduction programs, achieved primarily through recycling, must be operating by 
July 1, 1991. But plans for all cities must be on file with the county by the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the proposed joint operation, Thousand Oaks and Moorpark are 
considering independent recycling programs that would meet the state's order to 
reduce garbage by 25% by 1995 and by 50% by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
In Thousand Oaks, however, officials said a link with other cities would be 
less costly. 
</P>
<P>
"If we do it individually, it would be a great deal more expensive than doing 
it as a combined effort," Thousand Oaks Mayor Alex Fiore said. 
</P>
<P>
One long-term benefit of a joint planning effort that has been discussed would 
be establishment of a recycling facility in the east county, Fiore said. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley Councilwoman Ann Rock agreed that joint planning of a recycling 
center may be the next step after developing a study of the area's waste 
disposal patterns. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to see much more involvement in a materials recovery facility with 
the three cities than we're seeing now," Rock said. "It won't have to be a 
massive effort." 
</P>
<P>
With a combined population of about 234,000, the three cities will be able to 
share staff and ideas for disposal and recycling, even if they have existing 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley is the only city in the eastern part of the county with an existing 
recycling program. About half of the city's 27,000 households recycle paper, 
aluminum and bottles in a curbside recycling program that costs about $100,000 
a year to operate, officials said. The program is expected to be expanded 
throughout Simi Valley by next year. 
</P>
<P>
But pressure is also building locally to reduce garbage before it gets to the 
landfill. While the three cities all dump their garbage into the Simi Valley 
Landfill, space at the county-operated dump is quickly vanishing. 
</P>
<P>
The county has begun to look at the ways of reducing the waste generated by all 
residents as a means of extending the life of the county landfills, said 
Jocelyn Reed, deputy director of environmental services in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
About 325,000 tons of garbage are dumped at the landfill off Madera Road each 
year. Reed said the county's landfill capacity will be exhausted in about eight 
years.

OXNARD SUES OVER CLEANUP OF SEWAGE PLANT SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Oxnard has filed a federal lawsuit against the former owners of the 
site of its sewage treatment plant, claiming that they failed to warn the city 
that the land was contaminated with toxic material. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed in U. S. District Court in Los Angeles against the owners of 
a now-defunct company, Pacific Recycling Enterprises, which ran an automobile 
junkyard on the site of the sewage facility. 
</P>
<P>
The junkyard owners disclosed "some but not all of the contamination at the 
site" to city engineers when Oxnard bought the 7.76-acre property in 1986 for 
$1.9 million, the suit charges. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Oxnard city officials toured a partly completed expansion of the 
treatment plant on the site at 5925 Perkins Road. 
</P>
<P>
The plant's concrete settlement tanks were built atop the site, which was 
contaminated with lead, oil, cadmium, copper and zinc until the city spent one 
month and $1.5 million to clean it up, said Ben Wong, assistant public works 
director. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1988, construction engineers were digging up ground for the 
expansion when they discovered car parts and contaminants in the soil, said 
Stuart Larman, resident engineer for the project. 
</P>
<P>
"It was basically contaminated by battery acid and lead in the batteries and 
leaky gas tanks and oil," Larman said. "The extra work did not impact the 
ongoing project that was happening at the same time. Luckily, we were able to 
get the work done. We had a very cooperative contractor." 
</P>
<P>
The city hired cleanup contractor Paul Laurence to remove 7,200 tons of 
contaminated soil from the site and truck it to a toxic-waste disposal dump run 
by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in Casmalia, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The city's lawsuit, filed April 9, also accuses Pacific Recycling Enterprises, 
an earlier site occupant called Bay City Steel and their owners of negligence. 
</P>
<P>
The owners named are Herman and Gertrude Istrin, Genevieve and Clarence Haack, 
Leslie and Lucille Fine, and Vicky and Jack Del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles attorney Matthew L. Grode, whose firm represents all the owners but 
the Del Reys, said Thursday that his firm will file a response to the suit 
within the next few weeks. He said ownership of Pacific Recycling is in dispute 
but declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
The other owners have not been served with the suit, said Byron J. Lawler, who 
is representing Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
The suit asks the court to order Pacific Recycling's owners to reimburse Oxnard 
the $1.5 million already spent on cleanup and any future cleanup costs for the 
site.

INMATE TRAMPLED BY CATTLE FILES LAWSUIT

<TEXT>
<P>
An inmate who was trampled by cattle at the Ventura County Sheriff's Honor Farm 
in Ojai has sued the county and the jail for negligence. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Lt. Bob Taylor confirmed that Oliverio Lemus was injured while 
working on the farm on Oct. 17, 1989, but declined to discuss the incident 
because of the lawsuit, which was filed Tuesday in Ventura County Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
The suit claims that Lemus was trampled by a stampeding herd of cattle as he 
tried to guide them into their corral. 
</P>
<P>
Lemus suffered broken ribs and a punctured lung in the stampede while serving a 
six-month sentence for drunk driving, said his attorney, Steven Horenstein. 
Lemus was hospitalized for four days after undergoing surgery at the Ventura 
County Medical Center, then sent to the jail, where he finished his sentence 
about three weeks ago, Horenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Lemus, a field laborer, "has been unable to work ever since," and he may have 
to be operated on again because one of his ribs is not healing properly, 
Horenstein said. MACK REED

<P>
PLAN WOULD REDUCE WATER USAGE BY 10%

<P>
Moorpark residents are going to have to get used to dry lawns and 
drought-resistant landscaping under a plan the city wants to adopt to reduce 
water consumption. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are drafting a program to cut back on water consumption by about 
10% by forbidding excessive water usage and requiring low-flow plumbing 
fixtures on new homes. 
</P>
<P>
The Moorpark City Council will consider the plan May 16. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley, two other cities in the eastern part of 
the county that rely almost entirely on water from the Calleguas Municipal 
Water District, Moorpark is not under immediate pressure to reduce its water 
consumption. 
</P>
<P>
City officials, however, said they were committed to ensuring that a shortage 
does not occur by imposing the ban on excessive water use. 
</P>
<P>
About 7,476 residential customers and 88 agricultural customers in the district 
get a fourth of their water from underground sources. Three-quarters of 
Moorpark's water comes from Calleguas through the state water project. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, the city began pumping water from a new well west of Grimes Canyon 
Road, said Reddy Pakala, manager of the Ventura County Water Works District 1, 
which includes Moorpark and farmland north of the city. 
</P>
<P>
County water officials are also considering installing new equipment that would 
treat 1 1/2 million gallons a day for use in landscaping and agriculture, 
Pakala said. PSYCHE PASCUAL

STATE SENATE VOTES TO RESTORE FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Senate passed a bill Thursday that will restore $5 million a year in 
guaranteed state funding to Ventura County that was inadvertently deleted from 
state law last year. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, sponsored by Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) and Jack O'Connell 
(D-Carpinteria), now goes to the Assembly for final passage. Barring any 
unforeseen problems, it then will be sent to Gov. Deukmejian for his signature. 
</P>
<P>
Wright said she knows of no opposition to the bill because it merely reinstates 
a provision that had been accidentally omitted from a 1988 law. 
</P>
<P>
The bill provides that Ventura County's net share from the Trial Court Funding 
Act of 1988 will be $5 million per year, plus a cost-of-living increase. That 
brings the county's share for the next fiscal year to $5.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Trial Court Funding Act requires the state to take over the financing of 
the trial court system in all counties, but it requires counties to return a 
portion of their savings to cities within their jurisdictions that receive 
little or no money from property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The Trial Court Funding Act will save Ventura County $7.3 million in costs to 
run the court system for 1990-1991, said Dwayne L. McWaters, the county's chief 
deputy auditor-controller. 
</P>
<P>
But the county will have to share $3.1 million of its savings with cities that 
collect little or no property taxes, including Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks and 
Camarillo, McWaters said. Under these calculations, the county's net savings 
next year will be $4.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
If the bill passes, the state would have to pay the county an extra $1.4 
million to make up the difference between the $4.2 million in savings and the 
$5.6 million guaranteed funding level. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County needed special legislation guaranteeing $5 million plus 
cost-of-living adjustments because it benefited less from the Trial Court 
Funding Act than any other county in the state, McWaters said.

A 42-year-old transient has been arrested on suspicion of threatening his 
younger brother with an ice pick, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Valion Randy Jordan was arrested at a Thousand Oaks restaurant, where he fled 
after trying to slash his 28-year-old brother with an ice pick during a family 
argument, said Lt. Bill Montijo of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan's brother, whom police did not identify, was not injured in the attack, 
which occurred in the 2900 block of Molly Court, Montijo said.

ACTOR CONVICTED OF MURDERING HIS GRANDFATHER DURING THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After four days of deliberations that capped a 4 1/2-month trial, a jury on 
Thursday found Noel P. Scott, a struggling actor and musician, guilty of 
first-degree murder in the 1983 slaying of his grandfather in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The jury apparently accepted a key prosecution argument that Scott was one of 
the few intruders his grandfather's guard dog would have allowed into his house 
without a fight. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, 29, of Hollywood, faces a maximum sentence of 27 years to life in prison 
when he is sentenced June 28, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Scott showed no emotion as a clerk read the verdict in San Fernando Superior 
Court. His mother, Debra Scott, burst into tears as the verdict was announced 
and sobbed throughout the brief proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Scott shot 70-year-old Louis Fox three times in the head after 
struggling with him in the bedroom of Fox's house. He had entered the house 
through the open sliding-glass door to Fox's bedroom before dawn on Oct. 16, 
1983, hoping to steal $20,000 in jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Sidney D. Trapp Jr., who prosecuted the case, said Scott 
wanted the jewelry to save his relationship with his girlfriend, who was 
becoming frustrated with his difficulty making money in the entertainment 
business. Trapp also said Scott expected to inherit the bulk of Fox's estate. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, whose resume states that he was featured in television series such as 
"Eight Is Enough" and "King's Crossing," testified that he was at a Hollywood 
dance club when the killing took place. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors quickly adjourned to an assembly room after Thursday's verdict was read 
and refused to speak to reporters. They had been deliberating since Monday, 
asking several times to have trial testimony read back to them, court officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Scott's girlfriend testified during the trial that Scott went through his 
grandfather's jewelry box three weeks before the killing and fired Fox's 
.32-caliber pistol into the floor of the man's bedroom. He also told a friend 
how easy it would be to steal Fox's Rolex watch and "pinky" ring, both of which 
were stolen the night of the killing, according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
The grandfather was shot with his own gun, prosecutors said, and Scott's 
fingerprints were found on a flashlight that Trapp said Scott used to see his 
target in the dark bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most important, prosecutors said, was the fact that Scott was one of 
the few people who could get past Fox's German shepherd guard dog, "Dante." The 
grandson had befriended the dog during a two-month stay at his grandfather's 
house before the killing, Trapp said. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors apparently were unconvinced by defense attorney Sherwin C. Edelberg's 
argument last week that the prosecution failed to make its case because it 
depended on the testimony of a convicted felon. 
</P>
<P>
The felon, Charles Berkowitz, told police in the fall of 1988 that Scott 
confessed the murder to him four days after the killing. 
</P>
<P>
On the witness stand, however, Berkowitz testified that he had lied, hoping to 
receive favorable treatment after being arrested on suspicion of burglary. But 
Berkowitz stood by his account that Scott had asked him after the shooting how 
to alter fingerprints and beat a polygraph test. 
</P>
<P>
Berkowitz did not receive favorable treatment after the 1988 statement and was 
sentenced to the maximum term of three years in prison, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it was that statement that led police to arrest Scott in 
November, 1988, investigators testified. Before that, the case remained 
unsolved, although police were beginning to focus on Scott because he was one 
of the few who could have gotten past Fox's guard dog. 
</P>
<P>
Edelberg argued that because police did not have enough evidence to arrest 
Scott until Berkowitz made the statement, the prosecution did not have enough 
evidence to convict him, since the statement was a lie. 
</P>
<P>
Trapp, however, told jurors that Scott "had to eliminate the grandfather, who 
had discovered him and recognized him. He held the flashlight up to find him, 
he found his target . . . and fired three shots into the head of Lou Fox."

COUNCIL SCRAPS 8 PLANS, OFFERS ITS OWN; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: SANTA CLARITA PATCHES TOGETHER A DEVELOPMENT PLAN ON A CONTROVERSIAL 
HOUSING TRACT.

<P>
The Santa Clarita City Council set aside eight plans for a controversial 
housing development in Canyon Country that has dominated city politics for 
months and patched together its own plan, apparently confusing many of those 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
One of the rejected alternatives would have required a developer to build an 
estimated $55 million in roads that city traffic planners said Santa Clarita 
cannot afford. 
</P>
<P>
The council, after hearing 4 1/2 hours of testimony Wednesday night, directed 
city planners and the developer, G.H. Palmer Associates, to explore the 
possibility of building between 600 and 800 residential units on 135 acres 
north of Soledad Canyon Road and southwest of Ermine Street. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer Associates originally hoped to build 1,452 condominiums there. 
</P>
<P>
But in an effort to appease nearby homeowners, who complained that the project 
was too big, the company, working with city planners last week, hastily drafted 
seven alternative plans for the council to consider. 
</P>
<P>
The new plans for the project, called the Santa Catarina development, ranged 
from 1,292 condominiums to 385 houses, plus various combinations of 
single-family houses and condos. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Catarina is one of three Palmer Associates projects the company hopes to 
have included in a development agreement that would freeze city building codes 
governing the projects for 10 years. The company and city officials have been 
negotiating the pact for a year. 
</P>
<P>
In return for approval of the agreement and the three projects, the company 
would pay for road improvements inside and outside the Santa Catarina project. 
</P>
<P>
The council and city officials have wrestled with the issue at four public 
meetings and in several negotiating sessions with developer Dan Palmer and the 
opposing homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
At the council meeting Wednesday night, discussion quickly bogged down as the 
council discussed the merits of the eight plans. "We're not getting anywhere 
with this," Mayor Jo Anne Darcy said at one point. 
</P>
<P>
The council members began drafting their own plans, adding and deleting 
road-building requirements from earlier proposals. When council members asked 
Palmer to comment on one of their new proposals, he replied: "I don't know what 
you're asking me to do." 
</P>
<P>
Darcy jokingly responded: "I don't think we know what we're asking you to do." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Howard P. (Buck) McKeon said the council had reached a stalemate 
because it was trying to please all critics and supporters of the project. 
</P>
<P>
"When you really think about it, we're trying to satisfy everybody in the 
audience," he said. "And that's great, but we can't do it." 
</P>
<P>
At the urging of Councilwoman Jan Heidt, the council finally voted 4 to 1, with 
McKeon dissenting, to have Palmer draw up a plan for 600 to 800 units, a 
mixture of houses and condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
The council said the new plan should try to spare a lush canyon that would be 
destroyed under earlier proposals. 
</P>
<P>
The eight plans also called for extending Golden Valley Road through a ranch 
that has belonged to the same family since the early 1900s. The new plan should 
try to avoid a route through the ranch, the council said. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer said it was too soon to say whether he could comply with the new 
directives. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm totally confused," Palmer said at the end of the hearing. "I've never been 
through anything like this."

<P>
Oxnard Mayor Nao Takasugi has been selected by the United States Conference of 
Mayors to be one of six mayors participating in a conference of American and 
Japanese mayors in Japan this month. 
</P>
<P>
During the May 12-15 conference, Takasugi will join the mayors of Houston, 
Tex.; Kansas City, Mo.; Macon, Ga.; Newark, N.J., and Evanston, Ill., to meet 
with Japanese mayors in Tokyo, Chiba City, Hiroshima, Kyoto and Sapporo. 
</P>
<P>
Takasugi, who sits on the national board of the conference of mayors, said he 
was told last week about his selection. He said he did not apply for the honor 
and does not know how he was selected. 
</P>
<P>
The conference is designed to give U. S. mayors the opportunity to study 
economic development, construction and financing of projects in Japan, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Travel expenses and conference costs will be paid by the United States-Japan 
Foundation, which has been established to promote better understanding between 
the two countries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Takasugi and several other U.S. mayors attended a Taiwan meeting.

RANCHER DROPS PLAN TO BUILD RV PARK

<P>
An Ojai rancher has said he will drop his four-year effort to build a 60-space 
recreational vehicle park on five acres of agricultural land on the Santa Clara 
River near Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife said I was crazy to try this and that I should invest in CDs," Ozzie 
Osborn said at a hearing earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
"So that's what I'm going to do." 
</P>
<P>
Osborn said he is dropping plans to build the RV park just south of Santa Paula 
on South Mountain Road because of continuing opposition to the project from 
nearby residents and the county's lengthy environmental review. 
</P>
<P>
His announcement came during a meeting Wednesday of the county's Environmental 
Report Review Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Osborn said he lost interest in the project last September when the committee 
decided his original proposal to include a small golf course would need a full 
environmental impact report. Osborn reapplied to build only the RV park. 
Wednesday, four South Mountain Road residents objected to the project. THIA

ARTIFACTS: THE WORLD'S LARGEST PEARL ARRIVES IN STUDIO CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The famed Pearl of Allah arrived in Los Angeles Thursday, not by flying carpet 
or atop a white steed, but in an armored truck, under a firestorm of flashing 
cameras. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-pound convoluted pearl looks rather like a petrified white brain and 
appeared better suited to a home in formaldehyde than on satin. But it retained 
an aura of romance as it was installed in a Studio City vault and briefly 
exhibited for photographers from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very proudly a part of this priceless and remarkable artifact," co-owner 
Peter Hoffman said as he placed the pearl on a display stand draped in black 
velvet and gold lame. "It has a wonderful history and some remarkable legends 
to it." 
</P>
<P>
Considered the world's largest pearl, its flamboyant arrival in the San 
Fernando Valley marked the latest turn in a fanciful, 2,500-year history and 
the end of a nine-year legal battle as twisted as its hard, white furrows. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman said the pearl had been appraised at $42 million by the San Francisco 
Gem Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
It is destined for sale, possibly to a foreign collector, Hoffman said. The 
proceeds will settle a number of debts before Hoffman and his partners see any 
profit, according to Matthew I. Berger, a Beverly Hills attorney who represents 
one of the creditors with a claim on the pearl's sale proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman, a second-generation jeweler who grew up in West Los Angeles, declined 
to discuss the pearl's legal history. But Berger said his client, the 
Trans-Exchange Corp. of Texas, filed suit in 1981 in U.S. District Court in Los 
Angeles after Hoffman and a partner failed to pay off a $200,000 promissory 
note. 
</P>
<P>
The loan covered the purchase price of the pearl in 1980 from the estate of 
Wilburn Dowell Cobb, a San Francisco archeologist who obtained it in the 1930s 
and met Hoffman in 1977, three years before his death. 
</P>
<P>
After Trans-Exchange Corp. won a judgment for repayment in the mid-1980s and 
sought assets to seize, the pearl could not be found, Berger said. It was 
finally located in Colorado Springs, Colo., where Hoffman's partner in the 
pearl's purchase had used it as collateral for another loan, Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman had it brought to Los Angeles so that he could supervise its sale. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman -- who owns a third of the pearl and must see it sold to cover the 
debts he and his partners owe in its purchase -- said he would like it bought 
by a private collector who will ensure its public display. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a great masterpiece, like a Van Gogh," Hoffman said earlier this 
week, adding that the pearl had changed him. 
</P>
<P>
"It has made me a very spiritual person," Hoffman said. "Everything I do I look 
at from a spiritual point of view instead of from a material point of view." 
</P>
<P>
Wrapped in layers of plastic foam and bubbles, the pearl rolled into Los 
Angeles from Denver Thursday morning. About two dozen photographers waited 
while the Loomis Armored Inc. truck positioned itself in front of American 
Vault's main entrance off Laurel Canyon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
According to legend, the ancient Chinese philosopher Lao-Tzu had his nephew 
implant a small amulet depicting the faces of Buddha, Confucius and himself 
inside a clam. His hope, according to a press release, was that the resulting 
pearl would be "transplanted into ever-larger clams" and "handed down from 
generation to generation" as "an enduring symbol of peaceful coexistence 
between all peoples." 
</P>
<P>
According to this legend, the philosopher's descendants settled in the 
Philippines, where the pearl was reimplanted in a giant tridacna clam offshore. 
It was lost during a Ming Dynasty-era typhoon but rediscovered in 1934 by a 
Philippine diver, who drowned in the process. 
</P>
<P>
The Muslim chief who obtained the pearl thought it looked like the turbaned 
head of Mohammed and proclaimed it the Pearl of Allah. A few years later, Cobb 
received the pearl as a gift after he saved the chief's malaria-stricken son 
with modern medicine, Cobb later told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
As cameras clicked Thursday, Hoffman pointed out what he said were likenesses 
of the faces of Lao-Tzu toward the bottom, Buddha in the center, and Confucius 
on the left of the great pearl. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Pearl of Allah was whisked away to the vault, where a cast was to be 
made for replicas that will be shown to prospective buyers.

DISTRICT PLANS TO BUILD SCHOOLS OVER FLOOD CHANNEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles school district officials seeking land for desperately needed 
classroom space are making plans to build elementary schools over a county 
flood control channel in Arleta and in a section of Exposition Park. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual arrangement is part of a statewide legislative effort to avoid 
displacing residents in crowded cities such as Los Angeles, where a new 
elementary school can mean the bulldozing of more than 200 homes. 
</P>
<P>
"This not traditionally how we have located schools," said Bonnie James, 
administrator of building services for the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
"But we can't very well find the five to 25 acres of property waiting vacant in 
areas where the youngsters are." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed schools would incorporate state-of-the-art technology, such as the 
replacement of student desks with computer stations, said school district 
facilities planner Philippe Yancey-Piens. 
</P>
<P>
The Exposition Park school would concentrate on teaching science, with help 
from the California Museum of Science and Industry, which owns the site, and 
the Education Department at USC, which is located across the street, museum 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Rapid growth in the 615,000-student district prompted the school board earlier 
this year to convert all district schools to year-round schedules by July, 
1991. More than 25,000 students now ride buses from neighborhoods where schools 
are at capacity to less crowded schools in the San Fernando Valley and 
Westside. Even those less crowded areas are expected to run out of elementary 
school seats by this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The school district has won preliminary approval from the state Allocation 
Board for its application to receive special construction funds to pay for the 
two new schools, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The funds are part of the year-old Space Saver program, created in legislation 
sponsored by state Sen. Leroy Greene (D-Carmichael). The program was 
established to encourage districts to find land for new schools that will not 
require the taking of private property and displacement of residents. 
</P>
<P>
The district has bought about 2,000 homes and apartments in the last five 
years, district officials said. The school board is awaiting approval from the 
Allocation Board over the district's controversial proposal to buy the 24-acre 
Ambassador Hotel site for a downtown high school. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, three new schools were opened, and the district has plans to build 
another 29 schools, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100 residents attended a meeting at a Pacoima school Wednesday to hear 
district plans on construction of one of the Space Saver schools on five acres 
at Arleta Avenue and Devonshire Street. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents at the meeting opposed the proposed school -- which would be 
built in part over the Pacoima Diversion Channel -- because of increased 
traffic and noise, as well as possible vandalism. "I don't like the idea," said 
neighbor Danny Choti. 
</P>
<P>
The availability of the land for the proposed school is far from certain. The 
five-acre parcel under consideration has three separate owners: Chevron U.S.A., 
the Los Angeles County Flood Control District and the city Recreation and Parks 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
"Until we finalize the arrangements, we don't have a deal," James said. 
</P>
<P>
The state and school board must also give final approval to the projects. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Rudolph, executive director of the Museum of Science and Industry, said 
district officials first raised the idea of the science school two months ago. 
Final approval would be required by the museum's board of directors, which 
controls the 130-acre Exposition Park, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The two issues are whether we can help in curriculum and putting together a 
truly innovative school and questions about design," Rudolph said. "But we are 
interested."

BOY STRUCK BY DIRT CLOD DIES OF HEAD INJURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 13-year-old Lancaster boy died Wednesday of a head injury he suffered Sunday 
afternoon while playing with friends who were throwing dirt clods at one 
another in a vacant lot, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Toby Egstrom was taken to the hospital by his mother following the accident. 
The boy underwent surgery Sunday night at Lancaster Community Hospital and was 
transferred early Monday to Antelope Valley Medical Center, where he went into 
a coma, said Dean Sebree, a Los Angeles County coroner's investigator. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's homicide detectives were investigating the 
incident Thursday. But Deputy John Ashley said: "As this case continues, 
evidence has revealed nothing more than a tragic, regrettable accident." 
</P>
<P>
Egstrom and seven other youths gathered Sunday in the lot at 15th Street East 
and Avenue K in Lancaster, where they played a game that involved throwing dirt 
clods at each other, Ashley said. 
</P>
<P>
Egstrom was hit sometime before 6 p.m. above and behind the right ear, a 
particularly vulnerable area of the head, Sebree said. The boy got up and 
continued playing after being knocked down, but he went home shortly afterward 
and began vomiting, Sebree said. 
</P>
<P>
Sebree did not know the size or consistency of the object that struck the boy, 
but he said the soil in the high desert community is as hard as adobe and might 
have been harder because of a recent rain. The injury was a classic hematoma, a 
swelling that puts pressure on the brain and is fatal if it is not relieved, 
Sebree said. 
</P>
<P>
Egstrom's mother took him to Lancaster Community Hospital about 8:15 p.m., and 
doctors performed an operation to relieve the swelling, officials said. The boy 
was transferred to Antelope Valley Medical Center at 12:30 a.m. Monday because 
that facility does more neurosurgical work and has more equipment to treat such 
injuries, medical center spokeswoman Frankie Rich said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy was declared brain-dead Monday but remained on life-support systems 
until Wednesday, officials said.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANOTHER PLEA FOR SEWAGE PLANT WAIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On June 11, the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts will get another chance 
to argue for a federal waiver that would exempt its giant sewage plant in 
Carson from tighter treatment standards. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing, to be held by the federal Environmental Protection Agency in 
Torrance City Hall starting at 1 p.m., concerns the EPA's tentative rejection 
Jan. 30 of the districts' formal request for a waiver. 
</P>
<P>
The districts are seeking an exemption from federal regulations requiring more 
intensive treatment of the 365 million gallons of effluent pumped daily from 
the Carson plant into the ocean waters off the Palos Verdes Peninsula.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Work on widening the Ventura Freeway will require nighttime lane closures in 
Tarzana this weekend, the state Department of Transportation announced 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Two eastbound and two westbound lanes will be closed between White Oak Avenue 
and Reseda Boulevard from 11 tonight to 10 a.m. Saturday, Caltrans announced. 
</P>
<P>
Also, two eastbound lanes will be closed between Wilbur and Lindley avenues 
from 11 p.m. Saturday to 11 a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans Senior Resident Engineer Keith Eoff said the lane closures are 
required for crews to revamp concrete slabs next to the Lindley Avenue and 
Burbank Boulevard overcrossings. 
</P>
<P>
"These large slabs of concrete require long hours to safely remove and 
replace," Eoff said.

PLACING A LAND DISPUTE IN CONTEXT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding "Bigger Wilmington of Old" (Times, April 27): 
</P>
<P>
Had I known the tenor of the responses from (the) Harbor City Chamber of 
Commerce and (Los Angeles) Councilwoman (Joan Milke) Flores' office, I could 
have provided additional information to properly place the issue in context. 
The impression left by the article is that the area in question has long been 
considered part of Harbor City. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the case at all. It has only been in the last several years that 
any dispute has existed. 
</P>
<P>
If any "land grab" has occurred, it has been on the part of those in Harbor 
City who know darn well that this area has always been considered to be part of 
Wilmington. The Harbor Freeway has never been commonly accepted as a border by 
the people of Wilmington, and Mrs. Flores' statements merely reflect her 
estrangement from this community and the political favoritism which she 
lavishes on the expanded Harbor City, which is her creation. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly her predecessor John Gibson never believed that this area was part of 
Harbor City. A copy of the 1977-1979 Wilmington directory provided by Mr. 
Gibson to the community contains a map of Wilmington which clearly shows the 
area under discussion. I submit that 1979 was not turn of the century or 
ancient history; it was just 11 years ago. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The city enjoys the option of defining districts for purposes of 
administration. However, it has absolutely no authority or right to 
misrepresent, distort or rewrite history. The Wilmington Historical Society is 
dedicated to the preservation of Wilmington's past and we will not allow these 
misrepresentations to go unchallenged.

GOLF COURSE FAVORED OVER WILDLIFE PRESERVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This letter is in response to the dedication of an urban wildlife preserve in 
the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area. It would be interesting to know just how our 
city politicians decided to use taxpayers' money on this project when there are 
many other more useful activities for this precious land. 
</P>
<P>
It had long been rumored that a much-needed golf course was destined for this 
location. Los Angeles has a paltry seven 18-hole courses, which are usually 
poorly maintained. The courses are the city's only moneymaking activities. 
People spend hours each Monday and Tuesday morning trying to get starting times 
and pay their green fees. The point is: Golf courses are in short supply and in 
huge demand, and their revenue helps offset overhead expenses of the city. That 
is indeed unique and desirable for all taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
How many people will visit a wildlife preserve that uses 60 acres of land and 
costs plenty to maintain without a nickel of revenue? I hope someone with a 
sense of economic savvy will keep count, and maybe in a short while this 
wildlife folly will be converted to a profitable golf course. 
</P>
<P>
And to all the environmentalists who will be aroused by this view, please 
remember that the natural terrain and the lakes and river bottom already in the 
area and outside the preserve attracted migrating birds and wildlife for years 
before some narrow-minded politicos decided to build this preserve.

WHO REALLY PAYS INSURANCE CLAIMS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In reading the article regarding the lawsuit filed by Linda Hodges against 
Curtis Cooper, his mother, Crystal Cooper, and their landlady, Olga Kaczmar, in 
connection with the death of Sara Nan Hodges, I was appalled at Hodges' 
statement: "I wouldn't ever take a cent from Olga personally. 
</P>
<P>
I was told it wouldn't hurt anybody but the insurance company." Who does she 
think pays the premiums so the insurance company can pay claims? I resent that 
my premiums will have to pay to defend such a lawsuit. I feel our society has 
come to a poor pass when lawsuits such as this are filed with the expectation 
that insurance will take care of it.

CRAFTING GIFTS FROM NATURE'S STOREHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIOK-HIAN TAY KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She has sketched the 300,000-year-old bones of ancient man and drawn the 
fossils of the extinct ground sloth. She has peered through a microscope at the 
hairs on a fly in a painstaking search for artistic accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
Now Danish-born scientific illustrator Inger Achton Dix is channeling her 
creative energies in another direction: She makes whimsical creatures from 
nature's storehouse. 
</P>
<P>
Dix, 80, heads a group of 10 other volunteers who craft gifts from peacock 
feathers, twigs and seed pods at the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum. 
</P>
<P>
They work in a wooden shed nestled in the 127-acre garden. Their all-natural 
creations -- from painted walnut-shell skunks to prickly poodles fashioned from 
liquidambar pods -- bring in more than $3,000 a year for the arboretum's gift 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
"We make funny little animals," Dix said, holding up what looked like a cross 
between an aardvark and an armadillo, formed from eucalyptus pods, with stems 
of magnolia seedpods for legs. The creature, like other whimsical animals in 
the menagerie, sells for $2.95 to $4. Other handcrafted items are priced from 
$1 for vases of straw flowers to $30 for basket arrangements and wreaths. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes we do buy ribbon or silk flowers to add a bit of color," she 
confessed. 
</P>
<P>
Dix attended art schools in Copenhagen and Berlin. After she graduated, a 
zoologist taught her scientific illustration. 
</P>
<P>
She was hired to catalogue the 3,000-piece Mongolian collection of Danish 
explorer Henning Haslund-Christensen at the National Museum of Copenhagen, 
faithfully reproducing the ornate headdresses, tents and household items on 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
In 1947, she arrived in New York with $50 in her pocket and started work at the 
Museum of Natural History. Her job was to sketch fossils for anthropologist 
Franz Weidenreich. 
</P>
<P>
Then she moved to Caltech, where she drew the bones of the ground sloth. She 
stopped working as a professional illustrator in 1952 but continued to draw and 
paint for pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971 she exchanged her paintbrush and India ink for seeds, flowers and a 
glue applicator when she joined the arboretum's 300-member volunteer corps. But 
she hasn't lost her scrupulous attention to detail, and agonizes over traces of 
glue on the crafts. 
</P>
<P>
"She gives it everything she's got," said Grace Robinson, another volunteer in 
the crafts group, which meets Tuesday mornings. "She's very fastidious about 
what she makes. Everything has to be in good order before she lets it go to the 
gift shop." 
</P>
<P>
Dix estimates she spends about 50 to 70 hours a week at her arboretum "job." In 
addition, she pots plants at the Huntington Library, Art Collections and 
Botanical Gardens in San Marino and performs folk dances several times a year 
at Danish clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"I work harder now as a retiree than when I was paid!" she said. "I can't sit 
still. I have to work with my hands."

INGLEWOOD TRYING TO CURB APARTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Inglewood officials have unveiled proposals aimed at restricting the 
proliferation of apartments and condominiums and discouraging the construction 
of small motels. 
</P>
<P>
The measures stem from concerns among residents and council members that 
multiunit structures are causing congestion in residential neighborhoods and 
that motels have become a haven for prostitutes and drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed zoning and building standards would increase the required front, 
back and side yard space for apartment buildings and encourage developers to 
build on two or more lots instead of crowding apartments on one lot. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals also recommend that the city identify certain neighborhoods that 
currently allow multiunit dwellings and zone them to allow only single-family 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
"This will help to slow down the building," said Councilman Anthony Scardenzan, 
whose district has the highest concentration of apartments and condominiums. 
"It's better than what we had before." 
</P>
<P>
To discourage small motels -- such as those that line Century Boulevard, 
Imperial Highway and La Brea Avenue -- city officials proposed setting a 
50-room minimum on all future motels and increasing the required size of rooms 
and lobbies. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council referred both sets of recommendations to the Planning 
Commission, which will hold public hearings and develop specific guidelines for 
the proposals before returning them to the council for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the council approved two moratoriums that froze construction of 
apartments, condominiums and small motels in most of the city, giving the staff 
time to develop the recommendations. The moratoriums are still in effect. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations for apartments and condominiums would also establish 
minimum sizes for patios and balconies, require all bedrooms to be a minimum of 
100 square feet and require subterranean parking spaces to be at least half a 
story below grade. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said the measures would increase the quality of future multiunit 
structures and help prevent developers from replacing single-family units with 
apartments and condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
The city also recommended that all new motels have landscaped areas such as 
patios, playgrounds or swimming pools, and that they include a unit for the 
manager.

ARTIFICIAL REEF: A DOCKSIDE RESTAURANT FOR YEARS, THE LINER CAPSIZED LAST 
OCTOBER. IT IS BEING REFLOATED AND HAULED OFFSHORE TO BE SCUTTLED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After two weeks of underwater patching and welding on the capsized Princess 
Louise in Los Angeles Harbor, salvage workers are nearly ready to refloat the 
once-elegant passenger ship and dockside restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
But once raised, the ship that mysteriously sank last October will make only 
one last, short voyage before it is consigned to Davy Jones' locker. Workers 
plan to tow the 300-foot vessel out of the harbor, perhaps as soon as early 
today, and scuttle it a mile off Point Vicente to create an artificial reef. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual procedure, the salvagers are pumping air into the ship's hull in 
an effort to refloat it upside-down. Using welds and quick-drying plastic, 
workers have been laboring to make the ship's underside and main deck airtight. 
Since Saturday, the crew has been pumping air into the hull. 
</P>
<P>
Workers also have cleared the lower half of the ship of all ballast, or weight, 
and expect that the ship will roll upside-down when it is pulled into deeper 
water at high tide, said Willem B. Boelman, owner of TriNav Shipping, one of 
two Vancouver, Canada-based companies engineering the $1-million salvage 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a very challenging and interesting operation," Boelman said. "We 
may have T-shirts made up saying 'I Survived the Salvage of the Princess 
Louise.' " 
</P>
<P>
After years as a popular floating restaurant moored beneath the Vincent Thomas 
Bridge, the Princess Louise fell on hard times in 1988 and was repossessed by 
the Bank of San Pedro. The ship, which the bank hoped to sell, was undergoing 
repairs at the Southwest Marine shipyard on Terminal Island when it began 
listing and abruptly sank last Oct. 30. Salvage workers said this week they 
still don't know what caused the ship to founder. 
</P>
<P>
Some workers on the ship Tuesday said climbing in and around the doomed 
Princess left them with an eerie, otherworldly sensation. 
</P>
<P>
"I came down in here right after it went over," said Mike McKeown, yard manager 
for Southwest Marine. "It was really weird, like the 'Poseidon Adventure,' " he 
said, referring to a book and 1972 movie about a capsized ocean liner. 
</P>
<P>
The 67-year-old ship, which once plied the seas between Vancouver, Canada, and 
Puget Sound and spent nearly 20 years as a floating restaurant in Los Angeles 
Harbor, has lain half-submerged on its side since it sank. Although most of the 
vessel had been sealed off to help refloat it, workers Tuesday were still 
climbing down into the main bar and restaurant salon plugging newly developed 
air leaks. 
</P>
<P>
The floral carpeting in the main bar now smells of mildew, broken glasses 
sparkle beneath green water, and the mahogany woodwork is overgrown with algae. 
A mannequin's head -- tossed into a water-filled hallway by a salvage worker 
with a morbid sense of humor -- stares back through a porthole. 
</P>
<P>
If the Princess makes it to its destination on the sea bottom off the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula, many more divers will have the chance to pay their last 
respects. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand a number of dive clubs have already scheduled trips out there," 
said John Grant, a marine biologist with the state Fish and Game Department. 
</P>
<P>
Local diving clubs and sport fishermen have long lobbied for creation of a reef 
in the area because it would attract fish, Grant said. Fish and Game officials 
already held the necessary permits to scuttle a ship when Grant decided to 
pursue the Princess Louise last winter, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a pretty boat," Grant said. "We thought, 'What a shame to melt it down.' 
There was not enough money to restore it, so we thought, why not use it for 
something people can benefit from?"

DRUG BOARD UPHEAVAL WITHIN TAC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four members of The Athletics Congress' drug-testing custodial board, which 
monitors track and field's extensive domestic drug-testing program, have 
resigned, apparently in protest. 
</P>
<P>
The four -- Edwin Moses, Harvey Glance, Linda Sheskey and Doriane Lambelet -- 
sent their resignations to TAC offices in Indianapolis via fax machines late 
Wednesday. On Thursday, a TAC spokesman confirmed the action but said the 
organization would have no comment. 
</P>
<P>
Glance, a two-time Olympic sprinter, also resigned his position as a TAC vice 
president. However, he remained as president of the group's Athletes Advisory 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Moses and Glance did not return phone calls, and Lambelet could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Sheskey, reached Thursday at her home in Woodstock, Ga., had little comment 
other than to say the group would issue a statement soon. 
</P>
<P>
She said her resignation consisted of a two-sentence letter stating that she 
would no longer participate on the board, and that her reasons would be 
forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
Asked the nature of the dispute with TAC, Sheskey would only say: "It's been 
building for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Although the board members, all athletes or former athletes, appeared reluctant 
to make a public statement, one source close to the board said, "These guys 
caught (TAC) in one too many lies." 
</P>
<P>
The body has been under fire recently for its handling of various sensitive 
issues. Four elite athletes have tested positive for banned drugs within a 
month of each other, and another, steeplechase runner Henry Marsh, was given a 
two-year suspension after he failed to appear for a random drug test last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Long jumper Larry Myricks, hurdlers Greg Foster and Antonio McKay and UCLA 
triple jumper McArthur Anderson all have tested positive for banned drugs found 
in cold medicines. The athletes were each suspended for three months. 
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, Moses and Glance called for an independent investigation of 
drug use among American athletes, saying TAC had lost its credibility because 
of its handling of the Chuck DeBus case. 
</P>
<P>
DeBus, a former women's track coach at UCLA and Cal State Northridge, has been 
accused of providing banned drugs to athletes. TAC was found to have offered 
DeBus a deal in which he would receive a reduced suspension in return for 
naming athletes who he claimed had taken drugs. Although DeBus provided a list 
of names, the deal fell through. The decision in the DeBus case is expected 
next week.

CONGRESS MAY HAVE TO DEFINE INSIDER TRADING; 
</P>
<P>
WALL STREET: A CONVICTION OVERTURNED EARLIER THIS WEEK MAY FORCE LAWMAKERS TO 
SPELL OUT WHERE A TRADER CROSSES THE LINE TO BECOME A LAWBREAKER.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal appeals court decision this week may force Congress to deal with an 
issue that it ducked two years ago: coming up with a definition of illegal 
insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in New York on Wednesday overturned the 
criminal conviction of a former stockbroker, Robert Chestman. It was a decision 
that some legal experts said could sharply undercut the recent government 
crackdown on insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
Chestman was convicted in 1989 on 31 counts related to insider trading. He 
allegedly had received information from a customer about the pending sale of an 
East Coast supermarket chain, Waldbaum's, to another chain. He then bought 
Waldbaum's stock for himself and customers in advance of the public 
announcement. But the appeals court ruled that Chestman had gotten the 
information fourth-hand and was so far removed from the original source of the 
tip that he wasn't under any obligation not to trade on the information. 
</P>
<P>
Securities law experts said Thursday that they are almost certain that the 
government will appeal the ruling by the three-judge panel, probably by asking 
for a rehearing by the full appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
But they said that if the decision is upheld, there will be an urgent need for 
Congress to draw a clear dividing line between which types of securities 
trading are legal and which aren't. 
</P>
<P>
"I do believe it underscores the enormous need for a definition," said Harvey 
Pitt, a Washington securities lawyer. He said the ruling "will have a 
significant deleterious effect on the (Securities and Exchange) Commission's 
enforcement activities." Pitt represented former stock speculator Ivan F. 
Boesky on insider trading charges and also served on a committee appointed by 
Congress that had proposed a definition of insider trading in 1987. Congress 
never acted on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Current insider trading law refers only to "material, non-public information." 
It doesn't spell out what precisely is meant by "non-public" or who is bound by 
the prohibition. The absence of specific guidelines has given the SEC and 
federal prosecutors wide discretion to bring charges when the authorities 
believe that improper trading has occurred. Some SEC commissioners have opposed 
fixing a definition, arguing that a precise definition would only invite 
violators to find a way to sidestep it. 
</P>
<P>
But many securities lawyers and law professors say Congress may need to set 
specific legal guidelines or else the courts may continue to throw cases out. 
Alan Bromberg, a securities law professor at Southern Methodist University, 
referred to this week's Chestman ruling and said: "Here's a case that the 
government took all the way through the courts. Somebody should have known at 
the beginning of the case whether this was a violation." 
</P>
<P>
Some types of insider trading seem black-and-white cases. Few dispute, for 
example, that Boesky was guilty when he used deliberate tips from investment 
bankers about secret pending takeover deals to make a killing in the market. 
But is a securities analyst who is told by an insider that a company's earnings 
are likely to go down and who then advises clients to sell the stock guilty of 
insider trading? And -- to draw from an actual pending case -- what about a 
psychiatrist who allegedly buys stock after learning information from a patient 
about a major change at her husband's company? 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court decision this week involved Chestman, a former stockbroker at 
Gruntal &amp; Co. He had as a client Keith Loeb, the husband of a niece of Ira 
Waldbaum, then the president of Waldbaum's. Word of the pending purchase of 
Waldbaum's by Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. filtered down through 
members of the Waldbaum family to Loeb and then, allegedly, on to Chestman. But 
the appeals court ruled that there was no evidence showing that Chestman had 
been told that the information was secret or that he had any fiduciary 
obligation to keep the information confidential. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling specifically attacked an SEC regulation, known as 14e-3, which 
states that people who trade on advance knowledge of tender offers can be 
prosecuted even if they don't have any specific fiduciary obligation to keep 
the information secret. 
</P>
<P>
While his appeal was pending, Chestman had voluntarily begun serving a two-year 
prison sentence last June at the Allenwood Federal Prison Camp in Pennsylvania. 
He was released almost immediately after the appeals court ruling Wednesday. 
His lawyer, Elkan Abramowitz, said: "He's home. I spoke to him. He's reunited 
with his wife and family and sounds like a very happy man." 
</P>
<P>
Other legal experts, however, such as Joel Seligman, a professor at the 
University of Michigan Law School, noted that the three judges on the appeals 
panel were split. Seligman said he thinks that there is a good chance the 
appeals court decision itself could be overturned. 
</P>
<P>
As it stands now, the ruling would only have effect in New York, the territory 
covered by the 2nd Circuit. But because the territory encompasses Wall Street, 
federal courts in New York have been the most important forum for bringing 
insider trading cases. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan said a decision 
on an appeal may not be made for a month. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the SEC in Washington said the agency and Congress will probably 
wait to see what happens in court before proposing any new legislation on 
insider trading. Meanwhile, lawyers in other cases that may be affected by the 
ruling were scrutinizing it closely on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Congress has been content to leave prosecutors and SEC enforcement 
officials in a position analogous to the possibly apocryphal story about the 
judge in a pornography case who supposedly said that "while obscenity may be 
hard to define, I know it when I see it." For the moment, at least, prosecutors 
who think that they know insider trading when they see it may have to think 
again.

LITTLE RELIEF SEEN IN GAS PRICES DESPITE LOWER CRUDE COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Motorists gearing up for the spring and summer driving seasons might expect 
gasoline prices to fall along with crude oil prices that have nose-dived since 
the beginning of the year. 
</P>
<P>
But several analysts doubt that gasoline prices will fall much as the weather 
warms and more drivers hit the road. 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices have proven surprisingly durable despite the plunge in the cost 
of a barrel of oil from more than $23 per barrel in January to $17.99 on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In the same time, average prices for all grades of gasoline at the national 
level have edged up to about $1.14 per gallon on April 20 from $1.13 on Jan. 
19, according to the Lundberg Survey of 13,000 service stations. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, prices increased to 99.3 cents per gallon on April 20 from 
92.16 cents per gallon Jan. 19 for regular unleaded self-serve gasoline, the 
most popular grade, Lundberg reported. 
</P>
<P>
Critics accuse oil refiners and marketers of taking advantage of low crude 
prices to fatten their profits by keeping product prices high. 
</P>
<P>
The refiner's spread -- or the difference between the cost of a barrel of crude 
and the price of the refined products that can be made from it -- grew from 
about $1 per barrel in February to about $5 last week at a typical upgraded 
Gulf Coast refinery, said Bernard J. Picchi, an industry analyst with Salomon 
Bros. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"Companies use these opportunities to expand their margins," said consumer 
advocate Ed Rothschild with Citizen Action. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Roberson, who heads an Arco dealers group in Santa Barbara, put it another 
way: "It's the public that's getting the hose as refiners keep prices up until 
the public forces them to drop them." 
</P>
<P>
For its part, the industry denied keeping prices artificially high. 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials argue that crude prices are only one factor in setting 
product prices, though the dominant one. The recent fall in crude prices 
coincides with an increase in costs arising from routine plant maintenance and 
tougher environmental restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, demand is just now increasing for gasoline to be delivered in 
anticipation of the spring and summer driving season, while refining capacity 
remains tight in the United States -- all of which has kept prices strong. 
</P>
<P>
How soon will gas prices follow crude prices? 
</P>
<P>
"Retail prices normally follow wholesale prices by 30 to 45 days," said Peter 
Beutel, an analyst with Elders Futures Inc. in New York. But, he added, "I'm 
hard pressed to fully account for the lag in responsiveness by the retail 
sector to what's been going on in wholesale." 
</P>
<P>
"The industry calls it a lag effect, but it is usually much longer on the way 
down than on the way up," added Rothschild. 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials say gasoline prices will eventually fall into line. 
</P>
<P>
"With crude prices going down, gasoline prices will go down, barring unforeseen 
disruptions," said Sterten McDonald, vice president of distribution with 
Atlantic Richfield Co.'s Arco Products Co. 
</P>
<P>
The question, is how much? McDonald would not speculate. But some observers 
doubted that prices would fall more than a penny or two per gallon. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see prices falling," said Fereidun Fesharaki, who heads the energy 
program at the government-funded East-West Center in Honolulu, Hawaii. "There 
may be some minor decline this month and next as crude prices continue to go 
down, but come July and August, I expect a rebound and prices to stay strong." 
</P>
<P>
McDonald J. Beavers, whose Whitney Leigh Corp. tracks gasoline prices, said 
that prices typically spurt a nickel per gallon during the peak summer months. 
</P>
<P>
Complicating the matter is the question of where crude prices will go in the 
next few months. On Thursday, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries 
agreed to reduce by 1.45 million barrels its current crude oil production of 
23.5 million barrels per day in a move to bolster worldwide oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
If the agreement holds until OPEC's July 25 meeting, it could blunt the surplus 
of crude that has depressed prices. 
</P>
<P>
But traders on the New York Mercantile Exchange apparently doubted OPEC's 
resolve, and sent the June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark 
grade of U.S. crude, down 69 cents to close at $17.99 a barrel. Analysts feel 
that crude could trade even lower. "I think prices will be volatile within a 
tight band," Beutel said.

CHANGING OF THE GUARD AT S&amp;L BAILOUT AGENCY; 
</P>
<P>
OUT: WILLIAM SEIDMAN HAILED AS CAPABLE BUT HIS INDEPENDENCE IRKED WHITE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He calls it the "bargain basement of real estate," promising to slash prices 
15% and then another 5% if necessary to unload the condominiums, office 
buildings and shopping centers seized by the government from defunct savings 
and loan associations. 
</P>
<P>
This is the latest unorthodox ploy of L. William Seidman, the outspoken 
accountant in charge of cleaning up the S&amp;L mess. Seidman is leaving before 
his term expires in 1991, unmistakably hurried to the exit by President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
But he plans to depart with a flourish, shutting or selling 140 S&amp;Ls by 
June 30 in a whirlwind of activity. And to move some of the vast inventory of 
seized properties now ready for sale, he plans to use progressive price 
slashing -- a merchandising technique more common to discount clothing stores. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman has enjoyed the respect and admiration of many members of Congress, but 
his sometimes obstinate independence angered the Bush Administration, which is 
struggling with the ever-growing price tag for the S&amp;L bailout. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman has been a zealous guardian of his powers and prerogatives, both as 
chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which protects bank deposits, 
and as the director of the S&amp;L cleanup. When someone once asked him why he 
was waging a major fight over one seemingly obscure banking regulation, he said 
flatly, "Turf is what this town is all about." 
</P>
<P>
While expanding his powers, Seidman for a long time deftly managed to avoid the 
political quicksands that have engulfed so many figures connected with the 
S&amp;L debacle. When Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady suggested early in 
1989 that depositors be taxed on savings to help pay for disposing of crippled 
S&amp;Ls, Seidman dismissed the idea with a quip: "It's the reverse toaster 
theory . . . instead of the bank giving you a toaster for making a deposit, you 
give them one." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, Congress decided to spread the burden on all taxpayers, using bonds 
to raise the necessary billions. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, approved last August, made Seidman look like a winner: His 
FDIC bank insurance fund was kept separate from the depleted and crippled 
S&amp;L fund. And he was given the chairmanship of the Resolution Trust Corp., 
which oversees the dismantling of the hundreds of financially devastated 
thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman had "Congress eating out of his hands," said Bert Ely, an S&amp;L 
consultant. "He was fighting effectively for the FDIC agenda, not necessarily 
for everything the Administration wanted." 
</P>
<P>
But Seidman began building a solid relationship with Congress earlier, from the 
first days of his appointment in 1985 as FDIC chairman. 
</P>
<P>
He took the high-profile banking regulatory job at age 64, capping a 
distinguished career in business, the academic world and the federal 
bureaucracy. The Grand Rapids, Mich., native has business and law degrees, and 
began his career at Seidman &amp; Seidman, the family accounting business. He 
built the company into a major national firm, leaving in 1974 to join President 
Gerald R. Ford's "Michigan Mafia." 
</P>
<P>
In the White House, Seidman was a special assistant for economic affairs, with 
broad influence on legislative and budget policies. After the Ford 
Administration ended, Seidman joined Phelps Dodge, a copper and minerals firm, 
where he became vice chairman, and later served as dean of the business school 
at Arizona State University. 
</P>
<P>
In five years at the FDIC, Seidman dealt with the largest number of bank 
failures since the Great Depression. In February, 1989, with the S&amp;L 
industry losing millions of dollars a day, the White House gave Seidman 
emergency orders, and his auditors seized more than 200 S&amp;Ls in 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
His performance impressed Congress, which fashioned the S&amp;L bailout bill to 
keep Seidman's broad powers largely intact. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration became increasing miffed at Seidman's public discussions of 
the difficulty and expense of cleaning up the S&amp;Ls. "This is essentially a 
dirty business, telling people to stop doing bad things, telling (them) we will 
put them out of business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be a lucky nation if we can dispose of the current backlog of insolvent 
S&amp;Ls in 10 years," he said. "The bulk of the problems ought to be cleaned 
up within five years -- if we don't have another avalanche of insolvencies." 
</P>
<P>
This kind of talk became increasingly irritating to the Bush Administration, 
especially in recent months, when Seidman began telling anyone who asked that 
the price tag for the S&amp;L clean up would keep growing. 
</P>
<P>
The last straw for the White House apparently came when Seidman indicated his 
agreement with the General Accounting Office estimate that the thrift cleanup 
could cost $400 billion or more. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE BALLOONING BAILOUT 
</P>
<P>
The projected cost of cleaning up the nation's savings and loan mess continues 
to mount as original assumptions give way to revised estimates. The ultimate 
cost will depend on the number of thrifts seized by the government and the 
amount of money recovered by selling their holdings. The rising estimates 
reflect higher-than-expected interest rates, problems caused by shortcomings in 
the bailout plan and delays in shutting down failed institutions. But some of 
the confusion is caused by apple-and-orange comparisons. Here's a brief 
rundown: 
</P>
<P>
$175 Billion: The original White House estimate of total bailout costs, with 
interest, over the 33 years required to pay off all the bonds the government 
plans to issue. The estimate was based on optimistic economic and financial 
assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
$257 Billion: Last year's estimate by the General Accounting Office, an arm of 
Congress, based on more up-to-date information than the White House projection. 
Of the $257 billion, taxpayers would have been expected to contribute about 
$139 billion. 
</P>
<P>
$325 Billion-$500 Billion: A revised GAO estimate issued only last month. Part 
of the added expense reflects a decision to stretch out the cost by issuing 
40-year bonds instead of 30-year bonds. The GAO did not note the expected 
taxpayer contribution. 
</P>
<P>
$600 Billion: A more cynical long-term estimate offered by some thrift industry 
observers. 
</P>
<P>
These totals, however, exaggerate the real cost to the government of the 
bailout. The Bush Administration originally estimated that it would take about 
$90 billion in cash if all the depositors in failed S&amp;Ls were paid off 
immediately. Independent analyst Bert Ely, whose estimates have proved more 
accurate than those of the government, believes that about $125 billion in cash 
would cover the costs of closing all failed institutions.

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / S.J. DIAMOND: SEEING THROUGH THE FOREST OF 
ENVIRONMENT-THEMED ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S.J. DIAMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's hard to tell what some manufacturers are selling these days. 
Chesebrough-Pond's Timotei Shampoo runs ads of beautiful scenes, offering to 
plant "up to 50,000 trees or flowers" in California's parks or help restore 
Yosemite's meadows. Minute Maid pictures a green glade and a sapling, which 
they want to plant "in your name" in Redwood National Park. 
</P>
<P>
"The decade of the environment is upon us," observes Elliot Gruber, director of 
development for the National Parks and Conservation Assn. in Washington. "A lot 
of corporations are looking to tie into it." 
</P>
<P>
Their method is "cause-related" marketing, the last decade's innovation. At its 
worst, it was hype, typified by credit cards promising an associated good cause 
25 cents for every $100 charged. At its best, it directed some private sector 
profits to conservation, education, sports. 
</P>
<P>
But ads promising one thing and selling another can be confusing, and the 
so-called green consumer can be pretty green. If the trend continues, and 
everyone with a gimmick jumps in, serious manufacturers had better make their 
offers clearer, and consumers and recipients of the largess had better pose 
more rigorous questions. 
</P>
<P>
Some ads are pretty straightforward: If the consumer sends in proof of 
purchasing nine boxes of juice, a special coupon and 75 cents, Minute Maid will 
match the money, and the $1.50 will get a seedling planted in Redwood National 
Park. What's more, the project is real and well-defined, with no soft center. 
</P>
<P>
Minute Maid's expected 0.05% return on 42 million published coupons will bring 
orders for about 21,000 trees, requiring matching funds of almost $16,000. 
(This is probably the smallest cost in the promotion -- the coupon-bearing ad 
runs more than $500,000 -- but then, planting trees isn't Minute Maid's prime 
goal.) Gruber's group will handle the arrangements, and the park will get one 
year covered in its ongoing program to plant 20,000 trees a year. 
</P>
<P>
Timotei Shampoo's buy-a-bottle-give-a-tree offer is similar and seems equally 
straightforward. But it isn't what it seems, and the toll-free number offering 
more information has almost none (what kind of tree, what parks, how much from 
each purchase will be donated). 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the shampoo (the name means "grass" in Finland, where it originated) 
had already begun making donations as part of its move into the U.S. market 
last year. Last fall, it gave San Francisco's Friends of Recreation and Parks 
$11,000 to put 50,000 spring bulbs and 50 trees in Golden Gate Park, and gave 
Los Angeles' Griffith Park $11,000 worth of trees and shrubs. This spring it's 
giving Yosemite $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Nice subsidy. But it's not, as posed, a purchase offer, asking consumers to get 
personally involved and buy a bottle. It's simply a promotion, money spent to 
"stimulate" sales that would be spent anyway. Why the pretense? 
</P>
<P>
The selling of Rainforest Crunch ("Help Save the Rainforest and Eat Great 
Buttercrunch at the Same Time!") is so complicated, so loaded with 
environmental baggage, that consumers need a pamphlet to explain their 
purchase. The product had its genesis at a Grateful Dead benefit at which Ben 
Cohen of Ben &amp; Jerry's Ice Cream met a Harvard-based anthropologist from 
Cultural Survival, a "human rights group" working in Brazil's rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
The result: Community Products, a Vermont-based candy company that buys its 
nuts, through Cultural Survival, from native cooperatives, thus supporting 
continued life in the rain forest for both its people and its trees. In 
addition, the company promises 20% or 40% (depending which side of the box one 
reads) of its future pretax profits to "rain forest-based preservation groups," 
20% to environmental groups supported by San Francisco-based Working Assets, an 
ecology-minded money market fund, and 20% to "1% for Peace," a group that 
lobbies to redirect 1% of the military budget to peace activities. 
</P>
<P>
This is all good stuff, but hard to follow and hard to see. One can check on 
the bulbs in Golden Gate Park, the saplings in the redwoods; but these 
benefits, like foster children across the world or an idea whose time is yet to 
come, are not readily verifiable. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these, naturally, are "trust us" campaigns, the more so when the pitch 
precedes the program by some distance. Virgin Atlantic Airways is already 
publicizing its promise to plant a tree for every ticket bought in 1990 on its 
new Los Angeles-London route. 
</P>
<P>
But the flights start May 16, and there's still no specific planting, project 
or donation. It "might be one tree per ticket," says a spokesman, and it might 
be $1 per ticket (tickets are $499 economy round trip, $4,000 non-economy). 
Money, says Virgin Atlantic, will go to the Earth Communications Office and 
TreePeople in Los Angeles, but arrangements aren't set. "We have a 
gentleperson's agreement," says TreePeople Vice President Katie Lipkis. 
</P>
<P>
Even the recipients of such funds may not know for sure what they're getting, 
or getting into, and "a lot of environmental groups are re-examining their 
corporate giving guidelines," Gruber says. NPCA has set up a committee to 
review the corporate offers coming in "a couple of times a week" and has 
already turned some down, he says, including a paper manufacturer that "had an 
interest in a dam in a national park. 
</P>
<P>
Even Minute Maid presented NPCA with "a hard issue" because its juice boxes are 
only 70% biodegradable paper. "Do we say we don't like the package, we're not 
going to do the program?" asks Gruber. "If a cigarette company wanted to take 
an ad out in our magazine, we'd say no, but what if they wanted to give us a 
million dollars?" 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the only group clear about what they're giving and what they're getting 
is the manufacturers. And if that balance ever becomes unclear, they can always 
go back to selling the qualities and benefits of their products.

ICAHN, AMERICA WEST MEET OVER TWA U.S. OPERATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trans World Airlines said Thursday that Chairman Carl C. Icahn met with America 
West this week to discuss turning over to the Phoenix-based airline TWA's 
debt-laden domestic operations, including its lone U.S. hub in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Word of the meeting surfaced in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and was confirmed 
later by TWA's general counsel, Mark Buckstein. He said Icahn met Wednesday at 
TWA headquarters in Mount Kisko, N.Y., with America West President Mike Conway 
and union officials representing TWA pilots and machinists. 
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, Icahn said he arranged the meeting to explore a 
contingency plan should the unions refuse to make the additional wage and work 
concessions he seeks. Those are necessary, he maintained, to provide the 
capital needed to expand the airline as the pilots and machinists have urged. 
</P>
<P>
TWA lost about $300 million in 1989, Buckstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan discussed, Icahn said, no money would change hands. "They would 
not be purchasing anything; we would not be getting any cash," the 
Post-Dispatch quoted him as saying. America West would merely "take over" TWA's 
U.S. business, including its domestic hub in St. Louis, to reduce TWA's 
operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
That would leave TWA's profitable international routes without a domestic 
system to feed them, analysts noted. "What you'd have is a Pan Am No. 2, and 
Pan Am No. 1 isn't working too well," commented analyst Hans Plickert of 
Transportation Group in New York. So any deal would probably include a 
joint-marketing plan to mesh the two timetables, said Daniel Hersh of Bateman 
Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But America West would also have to assume much of TWA's $1.6 billion in debt, 
and the fast-growing firm is far from debt-free, the analysts noted. 
</P>
<P>
The Post-Dispatch quoted a union official who attended the meeting as calling 
the proposals "quite wacky." Tim Connolly of the International Assn. of 
Machinists, said he and fellow union members left the meeting "shaking our 
heads." 
</P>
<P>
Icahn paid $469 million for 90% of TWA's common stock in October, 1988, against 
the wishes of shareholders and the unions, which own the remaining 10%. His 
refusal to invest in modernizing aircraft and expanding service have since 
further soured the unions, leading analysts to speculate on Icahn's motives in 
meeting with America West. 
</P>
<P>
Hersh speculated that Icahn had more than a single strategy in mind in calling 
the meeting. He might -- as Icahn suggested -- be threatening to sell to a 
non-union company to scare the unions into accepting concessions. Or he might 
be "softening them up" so they would make concessions to another buyer "just to 
get rid of" Icahn. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone knows TWA can be bought for the right price," Plickert said. "He's 
certainly more than got his own investment back, plus he still owns TWA, so his 
return is good by any standard." 
</P>
<P>
Icahn initially returned TWA to profitability by slashing expenses and 
reorganizing the company. "But that was a one-shot lifting of the 
profitability, and he has run out of that kind of improvement," Plickert said. 
"Now he's left with the same problems everyone else has in the airline 
business. If you want to stay profitable, you've got to grow." 
</P>
<P>
America West Airlines, founded in 1983, has hubs in Phoenix and Las Vegas. It 
achieved major airline status last year when revenue topped the $1-billion 
standard.

EASTERN'S TRUSTEE STOPS PAYMENTS TO TEXAS AIR

Eastern Airlines' court-appointed trustee has halted management services 
payments to Texas Air Corp. and moved forcefully to untangle Eastern from its 
parent company. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview published Thursday in the Miami Herald, Martin A. Shugrue said 
Eastern no longer pays Texas Air $250,000 a month for management services. 
</P>
<P>
He said he also expects to negotiate with Texas Air to settle claims over asset 
transfers that bankruptcy court adviser David Shapiro said may have cost 
Eastern $403 million. 
</P>
<P>
A settlement "is very important to the viability of Eastern," he said. While a 
negotiated settlement is likely, the airline is prepared to go to court to 
collect if necessary, Shugrue said.

<P>
"We're not about to roll over and play dead to anybody," said Shugrue, who was 
appointed two weeks ago to run Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
In a 500-page report to the bankruptcy court, Shapiro said the management fees 
were one of 12 areas in which Texas Air may have overcharged Eastern. The fee 
was reduced from $500,000 a month to $250,000 a month when Eastern filed for 
bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
Some management services Texas Air provided, including advice and legal 
support, were no longer needed, Shugrue said. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern has also stopped leasing planes and crews from Continental Airlines, 
which is owned by Texas Air, Shugrue said. Eastern still buys fuel and leases 
planes from Texas Air, but the transactions are independent of the management 
services contract, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shugrue said he would proceed with plans to sell Latin American routes to 
American Airlines. Like the previous managers, he believes that would allow 
Eastern to pare its money-losing Miami hub and marshal its forces in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
But he rejected speculation that Eastern may move its headquarters to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Texas Air reported that it lost $107.1 million in the year's first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The loss came on revenue of $1.86 billion and compares to a loss of $255.53 
million on revenue of $1.88 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern, which has been operating under bankruptcy court protection since 
employees struck in March, 1989, recorded a net loss $136.5 million on revenue 
of $557.2 million before a $7.8-million charge for dividends payable to its 
preferred stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Miami-based Eastern lost $255.2 million on revenue of $620.6 
million before a $10.4-million charge for preferred dividends. 
</P>
<P>
Under generally accepting accounting principles, Eastern's operating results 
will be excluded from Texas Air's future reported operating results beginning 
April 19. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Houston-based Continental Airlines reported first-quarter 
earnings of $21.3 million, contrasted with a loss of $16.5 million a year ago.

MEMBERS OF OPEC AGREE TO KEEP OUTPUT WITHIN QUOTAS

Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed at an 
emergency meeting Thursday to stop producing oil above their previously agreed 
quotas, hoping to end the oversupply that has driven prices down 25% this year. 
</P>
<P>
But the agreement failed to stabilize prices on world markets. Crude futures 
fell in New York amid views that OPEC's pact would not offset current 
oversupply. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, spot crude oil lost 69 cents to close at 
$18.10 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody believes the agreement will help the near-term supply glut. There are 
still fears that there's a lot of crude out there and even if producers stick 
to quotas, it would not be enough to hold prices," said Stephen Platt, analyst 
with Dean Witter Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
Nauman Barakat of Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York called it "smoke and 
mirrors" unless the Persian Gulf states quickly showed the market that they 
meant business. 
</P>
<P>
OPEC said major oil producers have agreed to cut collective daily oil output by 
1.4 million barrels to a previously agreed upon level of about 22 million. 
</P>
<P>
Crude prices have tumbled this year in a scramble for revenue and market share 
caused by individual members exceeding OPEC output quotas. 
</P>
<P>
OPEC President Sadek Boussena of Algeria said the new deal was reached in 
intensive overnight negotiations, after the main quota offenders -- Saudi 
Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates -- agreed to trim production to 
take slack out of the market. 
</P>
<P>
The 13 OPEC ministers began their emergency talks Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Boussena said the UAE, which has ignored its quota because it deemed it unfair, 
would cut its own output by 200,000 barrels to 1.9 million barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
Oil traders at first marked up prices by about 15 cents a barrel on hearing 
news that OPEC had reached a production agreement. 
</P>
<P>
But when they realized that the accord would reduce OPEC output to only around 
22 million barrels per day, they quickly wiped out the gains and marked prices 
down. 
</P>
<P>
OPEC's declared price target is $18 a barrel, based on a basket of 
international crudes. 
</P>
<P>
Boussena said all OPEC members exceeding quotas would cut production to levels 
agreed upon in an earlier pact. 
</P>
<P>
Even countries pumping within their OPEC-set limits would trim production to 
lift prices, Boussena said. He mentioned Iraq, Iran, Indonesia, Qatar and 
Algeria. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazir told reporters, "We are going back to 
our quota. . . . Everybody is sincere about adhering to the quota. I am very 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
The world's biggest exporter, Saudi Arabia, promised a substantial daily cut of 
430,000 barrels, delegates said.

FREEDOM NEWS HOLDERS ADOPT TAKEOVER DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Majority owners of Freedom Newspapers Inc., worried that dissident shareholder 
Harry H. Hoiles might align himself with takeover specialist Robert M. Bass, 
have created a voting block to thwart unwanted suitors for their family 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
The majority shareholders, representing two branches of founder R. C. Hoiles' 
family and two-thirds of the company, hired New York merger lawyer Martin 
Lipton to draft an agreement that essentially requires them to vote their 
shares together and to sell their stock only to each other. 
</P>
<P>
The actions are meant to "signal to anybody who is thinking of making a raid on 
the company that we're determined to remain a privately held, closely held, 
family company," said Robert C. Hardie, chairman of Irvine-based Freedom 
Newspapers, owner of the Orange County Register and 26 other daily newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
The actions would also tend to reduce the value of the Harry Hoiles family 
stock to any outsider. 
</P>
<P>
Hoiles has battled the families of his sister, Mary Jane Hardie (Robert 
Hardie's wife), and his late brother, Clarence H. Hoiles, for more than a 
decade in his effort to split up the company and take his share of the assets. 
The three families each hold about one-third of the shares of Freedom, which 
also owns 25 weekly newspapers and five television stations. 
</P>
<P>
The majority contends that Hoiles is entitled only to the value of his stock, 
not the assets. Hoiles lost lower and appellate court cases to break up the 
assets but plans to ask the state Supreme Court to reverse the rulings. 
</P>
<P>
Hoiles has threatened a number of times to sell his stock to an outside party, 
an act the majority would abhor. 
</P>
<P>
At several Freedom meetings this year, Hoiles was accompanied by Glen Johnson, 
a Ft. Worth lawyer whose firm handles much of the Robert M. Bass Group's legal 
matters. Hoiles' son, Tim, said he had retained the lawyer while acting as 
publisher of Freedom's Pampa, Tex., paper in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Though Hoiles said he has not talked with any Bass people about selling his 
stock to the Ft. Worth investor, the Hardie and Clarence Hoiles branches don't 
believe it. 
</P>
<P>
"We know who the lawyer is. We know the firm and who it represents," Robert 
Hardie said. 
</P>
<P>
And the majority also knows that the Bass Group -- whose investments include 
American Savings Bank, a Stockton thrift operated out of Irvine -- currently 
holds 40% of Times Publishing, which owns the St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times. 
</P>
<P>
It bought the stake from two granddaughters of founder Paul Poynter and is 
challenging a dividend structure that it believes was a result of an 
acrimonious family feud among Poynter descendants. While Bass says his stake is 
simply a long-term investment, newspaper executives there contend that Bass has 
a hidden agenda to take control of the company. 
</P>
<P>
Freedom's majority owners decided to try to prevent a similar occurrence in 
Orange County. Hardie said the majority needed to hire a top Wall Street lawyer 
such as Lipton because they feared they would be up against the might of the 
Bass Group. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new voting block agreement, the shareholders in the two families 
agreed to sell their stock only to each other and to allow a seven-member 
committee to vote the shares through the end of 1994, with annual renewals 
thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement supersedes a previous pact between the two families that required 
current shareholders to offer stock to each other before selling to an 
outsider.

Subaru of America Inc. will be sold in a sweetened $204-million deal to Fuji 
Heavy Industries Ltd., the Japanese company that supplies all of Subaru's cars 
and owns nearly half of the firm's shares, both companies said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Fuji, which owns about 49.5% of Subaru's 48.5-million shares, will buy the rest 
of the stock for at least $8.50 a share -- a premium of 33% over its closing 
price Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Subaru's stock jumped 25%, or $1.625, to close at $8 in the over-the-counter 
market after the announcement was made. 
</P>
<P>
Subaru, based in Cherry Hill, N.J., was formed in 1968 to distribute cars in 
the United States made by Fuji under an exclusive contract.

GM PROFIT DROPS 54%; FORD NET SKIDS 69%

<P>
Profit fell by 54% at General Motors Corp. and by 69% at Ford Motor Co. in the 
first quarter because of U.S. production slowdowns and problems with overseas 
operations, the companies said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The figures, combined with Chrysler Corp.'s 80% drop in first-quarter net 
income, meant an overall 64% profit drop for the Big Three auto makers during 
the period. 
</P>
<P>
But the results were not as bad as the 75% profit decline that analysts had 
expected for the companies, which are struggling with soft markets and 
intensified competition from foreign-based auto makers. 
</P>
<P>
GM said it earned $710 million on revenue of $30.11 billion during the quarter. 
That compared to a $1.55-billion profit on revenue of $33.24 billion in the 
year-earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
Ford said it made $506.2 million during the first three months of this year, 
compared to $1.64 billion during the same time last year. 
</P>
<P>
Ford's revenue fell 9% in the quarter, to $23.6 billion from $25.87 billion a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Through the end of the first quarter, Big Three car and truck sales were 3.6% 
behind last year's pace. By the end of April, sales for Big Three-North 
American made vehicles were 6.1% behind last year's pace. 
</P>
<P>
Economic uncertainty in Brazil, where Ford and GM have large presences, dented 
both companies' overseas earnings, which in past years have shored up sagging 
North American profits. Strikes in the United Kingdom further hurt Ford's 
earnings from its overseas operations. 
</P>
<P>
David McCammon, Ford's finance vice president, said Thursday that he expected 
the problems in Brazil to continue affecting the company's earnings. Ford and 
West Germany's Volkswagen AG are linked in the Autolatina joint venture in 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we are going to see a material drag on Ford's earnings from Brazil in 
the second quarter, largely because there has been no production there since 
the 15th of March," said analyst John Kirnan of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
On that day, Ford shut its Autolatina plant after the government froze most 
savings in an attempt to halt runaway inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The plant is back in operation, but it will take time to return production to 
pre-shutdown levels. 
</P>
<P>
Kirnan and David Healy, of Barclays-BZW in New York, said cost-cutting 
programs, especially at Chrysler, softened the impact of severe production cuts 
in January and costs of incentives throughout the period. 
</P>
<P>
McCammon said Ford spent about $1,000 in incentives for each car and light 
truck it sold during the quarter. In April, he said, that cost rose to about 
$1,200 per vehicle and predicted that the cost would drop back to about $1,000 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
GM and Chrysler decline to say how much they spent on incentives.

MORE THAN 200 FACE LAYOFFS AT AEROJET PLANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Aerojet unit of Gencorp said Thursday that it would lay off several hundred 
workers at its Downey and Chino plants because of the loss of a contract 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
The Aerojet Ordnance facilities in Chino and Downey employ 600 workers, and a 
spokesman said Thursday that the layoffs would affect more than 200 but would 
not result in a complete closure of the facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, Sacramento-based Aerojet closed its Tustin facility after it 
encountered problems winning new business there. The Tustin operation had 
employed as many as 1,000 workers, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The layoff at Aerojet Ordnance follows the loss to Honeywell of a $124-million 
contract to build 13,500 combined-effect munition systems for the Air Force. 
Aerojet has made the munition, which consists of 202 small bombs inside a 
container, for several years. 
</P>
<P>
The loss "will have a major impact on the future direction of our company and 
our level of employment," Edward F. Davidson, the Aerojet executive in charge 
of the ordnance unit, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson said the company would have to "phase out" the combined-effect 
munitions business quickly "to protect our ammunition contracts," referring 
apparently to an effort to trim overhead rates that would affect its 
competitive position on other contracts at the operation. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said no layoffs are planned at Aerojet's ElectroSystems unit in 
Azusa.

AVON HOLDERS, MANAGERS SPAR OVER STRATEGY

Shareholders of Avon Products Inc., which has been under pressure to cut costs, 
sell assets or put itself up for sale, urged the cosmetics giant Thursday to 
either drop a key takeover defense or let shareholders vote on keeping it. 
</P>
<P>
Shareholders approved two nonbinding proposals at their annual meeting relating 
to the company's share rights plans, commonly known as poison pills, that can 
make unsolicited buyout bids prohibitively expensive. 
</P>
<P>
One proposal urged the company, which had nearly $3.3 billion in sales last 
year, to either drop the rights plan or submit it to a shareholder vote. The 
second urged a vote on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Both proposals were opposed by Avon management, which insists that the company 
is not for sale and wants to proceed with plans to making its direct-selling 
business more profitable. 
</P>
<P>
But each passed with nearly 25.4 million shares in favor, more than 16.7 
million opposed and more than 16.7 million abstaining. 
</P>
<P>
In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Avon closed down 75 cents a share at 
$36.375. 
</P>
<P>
The United Shareholders Assn., a Washington-based advocacy group, said one of 
the approved proposals was introduced by one of its members, Norman Warner, as 
part of its "Target 50" program aimed at what it calls "the most 
anti-shareholder companies in America." 
</P>
<P>
"Avon's management would be foolish not to implement proposals that so clearly 
expressed the will of the shareholders," said association director Ralph 
Whitworth. 
</P>
<P>
The shareholders also elected four directors to the Avon board, including two 
nominees representing the investor group Chartwell Associates LP. Chartwell 
owns 12% of Avon's voting stock and had threatened to run a slate of four 
candidates for seats on the 11-member board. 
</P>
<P>
But under a settlement reached in late March, Avon agreed to support two 
Chartwell nominees along with two incumbent directors for the four seats that 
were up for election. Those nominees were elected Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Avon agreed to set up a committee to consider ways of boosting 
value for Avon stockholders, including a recapitalization, asset sales or 
selling the whole company. 
</P>
<P>
The committee will include four Avon directors and executives and the two new 
board members from Chartwell, M. Anthony Fisher and Marc Leland. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement also called for the appointment of John P. Rochon, a principal 
in the Chartwell group, as an Avon adviser once he resigns as vice chairman of 
Mary Kay Cosmetics, Avon's Dallas-based rival.

SURPRISE TRIAL CONFESSION IN WAYNE DAUGHTER ATTACK 
</P>

<P>
In a dramatic turnaround, a Burbank man admitted on the witness stand Thursday 
that he led the attack on John Wayne's daughter and her former boyfriend in 
Newport Beach 19 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Jerrel Lee Hintergardt, 38, however, denied in Orange County Superior Court 
that he personally beat up Aissa Wayne. He also denied the prosecution's claims 
that the attack was ordered by Wayne's ex-husband, Dr. Thomas A. Gionis, who 
was going through a bitter custody fight with her at the time over their 
2-year-old daughter. Gionis' trial on assault charges is scheduled to begin in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
Hintergardt, who is standing trial on eight felony counts related to the 1988 
attack on Wayne and her then-boyfriend, Roger W. Luby, admitted that he and 
another man held Wayne and Luby at gunpoint, forced them to the ground and 
handcuffed them. He also admitted that he struck Luby hard enough to knock him 
down and then slashed his right Achilles' tendon with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
Hintergardt said he was told by O. Daniel Gal, the private investigator who 
hired him and his accomplice, that it was Luby who was the target -- not Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
"I never meant for anyone to get hurt," Hintergardt testified. "But things just 
got out of control." 
</P>
<P>
Hintergardt's admission that he was involved in the attack on Wayne and Luby 
stunned prosecutors and investigators in the case. Even Hintergardt's own 
lawyer, Todd A. Landgren, hadn't heard the confession until 15 minutes before 
his client's trial was scheduled to resume Thursday morning, Landgren said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was certainly a shock," Landgren said. "I wish he had said this a year ago. 
He hasn't left me much time to prepare for this." 
</P>
<P>
Wayne, 34, and Luby, 54, both took the witness stand during Hintergardt's trial 
this week and identified him as the leader of the two men who approached them 
with guns at Luby's gated estate in Newport Beach just before noon on Oct. 3, 
1988. Both victims testified that it was Hintergardt who smashed their faces 
into the concrete and said to Wayne at one point: "You're (messing) with the 
wrong people." 
</P>
<P>
The other gunman, Jeffrey K. Bouey, who is cooperating with authorities, 
corroborated for jurors virtually every detail of what the victims testified 
had happened. 
</P>
<P>
Both Bouey and Gal, who also have assault charges pending against them, have 
implicated Gionis as the client who gave the order that Wayne "be taught a 
lesson." 
</P>
<P>
Landgren told the jurors in his opening statement Monday that he would prove 
Hintergardt was at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Los Angeles the 
morning of the attack. He told jurors Hintergardt would testify himself that he 
was at the hospital that day to have adjustments made on his artificial left 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
Landgren then spent two days producing witnesses to shore up that alibi. 
</P>
<P>
But on Wednesday, the defense was dealt a blow when a technician from the 
Veterans Administration Hospital testified that he was certain that he had 
worked on Hintergardt's foot on Oct. 16, not Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom Thursday, Landgren appeared distressed. At the time he 
made those arguments to the jury, Landgren said, he believed that he was 
putting on a credible defense. Landgren said he could not be sure what led 
Hintergardt to finally admit that he was involved in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Jerry wanted this to go to trial because he was bothered by what 
prosecutors were saying," Landgren said. "They were right about what he had 
done, but they were wrong about the reasons he had done it. Then, I think he 
finally realized that his alibi just wasn't going to hold up and it was time to 
tell the truth." 
</P>
<P>
In his testimony, Hintergardt disputed the victims' version of the attack in 
only one significant detail: He insisted that he did not strike Wayne or cause 
her injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"I never touched Miss Wayne; I did handcuff her," Hintergardt said. "I don't 
think there is ever an excuse for violence against a woman." 
</P>
<P>
Hintergardt said Bouey must have hurt Wayne when he used a martial arts move to 
force her to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Hintergardt, who testified about his past campaigns to eliminate drugs from his 
neighborhood, told the jury that he did not know who Wayne was at the time. He 
said that he had been hired by Gal for $3,500 to intimidate Luby on behalf of a 
client who was upset about Luby's "drug deals." He admitted, however, that he 
had no personal knowledge that Luby was dealing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials say they have no indication that Luby was involved in 
drug dealing. 
</P>
<P>
Hintergardt said he and Bouey slipped onto the property through the gate when 
Wayne and Luby returned to the Luby estate by car from a workout at a health 
club. 
</P>
<P>
Hintergardt said he only meant to intimidate Luby, let him know he would be in 
jeopardy if he didn't stop dealing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"I was delivering a message to him, but he wasn't taking this seriously," 
Hintergardt said. "I see this cocaine dealer, this nothing, and he was being a 
wise guy. So I hit him." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans went on the attack on 
cross-examination. "You were mad at Luby because he laughed at you, and that's 
why you hit him, isn't that right, sir?" he asked the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
In his closing argument later, Evans described Hintergardt as a "very, very 
angry, disturbed person." 
</P>
<P>
The jury is scheduled to begin deliberations Monday.

BUST OR BOOM? Debunking a federal report that said Orange County has a 
dangerous glut of office space, a new state study says the area is still 
economically healthy (D1). . . . But the state expresses concern about 
"high-asset growth" -- that is loans made -- among some state-chartered banks. 
. . . And some Orange County banks are among the state's most aggressive 
lenders, possibly putting themselves at risk if the local economy falters.

WITNESS CLAIMS DOCTOR THREATENED HIM; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: THE EX-PARTNER OF A NEWPORT BEACH COSMETIC SURGEON ACCUSED OF 
MALPRACTICE SAYS HIS FORMER COLLEAGUE TRIED TO INFLUENCE HIS TESTIMONY.

<P>
A nationally known cosmetic surgeon from Newport Beach threatened earlier this 
week to create professional and legal problems for his ex-partner if he did not 
change his testimony about a face lift on a former Mrs. California, the partner 
testified Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony threatens to severely undercut Dr. Michael Elam's defense against 
civil allegations of malpractice and insurance fraud and could also lead to 
criminal charges of witness tampering, said Deputy Atty. Gen. Barry Ladendorf 
in an interview after Thursday's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time someone tries to influence a witness to change his testimony, that, 
to me, shows the guy's got something to hide -- he doesn't want the truth out," 
said Ladendorf, who is representing the Medical Board of California in its 
attempt to take away Elam's license. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the testimony "sour grapes," Elam said in an interview: "Look, I didn't 
try to intimidate or threaten (the former partner). . . . I called because I 
wanted to find out what he was going to say so it wasn't a big surprise. That 
was all." 
</P>
<P>
The 41-year-old Elam, seen regularly on home-shopping cable shows promoting 
skin-care products, gained nationwide exposure and a long list of high-paying 
clients at his opulent office near Fashion Island after he helped redo 
comedienne Phyllis Diller's face in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
But he and ex-partner Frederick Berkowitz, 67, also of Newport Beach, now face 
revocation of their medical licenses by the state Medical Board for alleged 
malpractice and insurance fraud in connection with two former patients. 
</P>
<P>
One of the patients, 55-year-old Bonnie Luebke, a 1984 Mrs. California pageant 
winner from Trabuco Canyon, testified last month before Administrative Law 
Judge Rosalyn Chapman in Los Angeles that Elam drugged her into signing consent 
forms in 1985 and then gave her a nose job and cheek implants that she 
"absolutely never, ever" wanted. She said Elam, insistent on doing the 
operation his way, promised: "I'll make you look 30." 
</P>
<P>
The state hearing, expected to conclude next week, took a dramatic turn 
Thursday during Ladendorf's cross-examination of Berkowitz, centering on a 
phone call Berkowitz got at home from Elam around 7 a.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The topic, Berkowitz testified, was his knowledge of the Luebke operation. 
</P>
<P>
Although Elam and one of his assistants have testified that Berkowitz assisted 
at the Luebke surgery, Berkowitz testified that he did not get into the office 
that day until after it was finished. Ladendorf asserted that office records 
support this. 
</P>
<P>
Berkowitz testified Thursday that Elam tried to persuade him otherwise during 
their phone conversation. 
</P>
<P>
Elam attempted to convince Berkowitz that "my memory wasn't too good and that I 
couldn't remember if I was there or not and that I should testify to that at 
cross-examination," Berkowitz testified. 
</P>
<P>
And, Berkowitz said, Elam suggested that if he did not feign forgetfulness in 
court, he might face other problems: Elam's testimony against him in a separate 
malpractice claim, as well as Elam's exposure of lax record-keeping by 
Berkowitz and alleged drug use by two of his employees. 
</P>
<P>
Berkowitz took this as a threat, he testified. 
</P>
<P>
Elam, who was not present for the testimony, angrily said later: "Dr. Berkowitz 
doesn't have a very good memory. . . . He's got the whole thing confused. He's 
taken all the facts and thrown them in a big pot and tried to cook something up 
against me." 
</P>
<P>
By calling Berkowitz, Elam said, "I wanted to find out what his particular plan 
was for his defense. We discussed what he was going to say and what he wasn't 
going to say. This is basically what everybody does when they go on trial. . . 
. I was trying to encourage Dr. Berkowitz to tell the truth." 
</P>
<P>
Elam also denied using the drug-use issue as a threat. He said he simply wanted 
Berkowitz to know that if he put his employees on the witness stand in his own 
defense, "he should realize that other things are going to come out -- like the 
girls' using drugs and all that." 
</P>
<P>
Elam's attorney, Douglas Reynolds of San Diego, said he does not believe that 
his client did anything illegal. 
</P>
<P>
However, Reynolds said, "it would certainly be better if he hadn't (made the 
call). . . . There can be misunderstandings, so it's not real advisable."

TWO MEN ARRESTED IN 17-YEAR-OLD'S MURDER

<TEXT>
<P>
Two Anaheim men have been arrested on suspicion of murdering 17-year-old 
Rosendo Ibarra, who was shot in the head Monday at a pay telephone in a 
shopping center parking lot, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
David Alan Davis, 22, and Joe David Kehler, 23, were arrested by police in 
Cypress and in Garden Grove and may be arraigned on murder charges as early as 
today, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove Police Capt. David Abrecht said investigators have also recovered 
a .38-caliber revolver and have ordered forensic tests to determine whether it 
is the murder weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Police are still searching for several other people believed to have taken part 
in what they initially suspected was a gang-related slaying, Abrecht said. 
</P>
<P>
Police, politicians and community leaders have expressed alarm over a recent 
spate of deadly gang shootings. Though details were sketchy Thursday, police 
said there were some indications that drug or gang conflicts may have played a 
role in the Ibarra killing. 
</P>
<P>
"Davis and Kehler are not readily identifiable as gang members, but they 
associated with gang members," Abrecht said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that we have a gang shooting or a shooting about a drug deal or 
owed money or what," Abrecht added. "And I don't think we will know that until 
we catch up with the other people." 
</P>
<P>
The victim's relatives said Thursday that Ibarra was not a gang member and that 
he was not involved with drugs. But they said the facts suggest that his 
killing had been planned. 
</P>
<P>
It was the arrest of Kehler and another man on drug charges on Monday that gave 
police their first break in the murder case. 
</P>
<P>
Ibarra, an unemployed construction worker, was shot about 11 p.m. Monday at a 
pay phone in the parking lot of a shopping center on Katella Avenue, near 
Gilbert Street. He had been living across the street with an aunt, and family 
members often used that pay phone because they did not have a telephone in the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
About 11:30 p.m., Cypress police were called to a loud party in a motel room in 
the 5800 block of Katella, about three miles west of the murder scene, said 
Cypress Police Lt. John Schaefer. 
</P>
<P>
When Officers Dave Birozy and Dan Forniss opened the door, they smelled 
marijuana and then found several ounces of the drug packaged for sale, Schaefer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Five people were detained for questioning, and ultimately, Kehler and another 
man, Gilbert Romero Bill, 21, of Stanton, were arrested on charges of 
possession of marijuana with intent to sell, Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
During the course of the investigation, however, Birozy learned of a link to 
the Ibarra case and invited Garden Grove detectives to interview Kehler, 
Schaefer said. Authorities declined to specify the link. 
</P>
<P>
Davis was arrested Wednesday evening, Abrecht said. The gun was also recovered, 
but Abrecht could not say whether the gun belonged to Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Court records show no prior convictions for Kehler, Bill or Davis. 
</P>
<P>
The victim's aunt, Virginia De La Reyes, said that the night before the 
shooting, relatives had noticed an old, dark-colored Cadillac circling their 
block in the Colonia Independencia neighborhood and driving around the small 
shopping center across the street. De La Reyes said she was suspicious, but the 
next night, Ibarra went out anyway to use the phone. 
</P>
<P>
He was speaking with his girlfriend when he was shot in the side of the head, 
relatives said. A cousin, Mona Marquez, said she heard four shots, rushed out 
of the house and held Ibarra in her arms as he died. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know who to hate, but I want something to be done," Marquez said. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives said they did not know Kehler or Davis and were at a loss to explain 
the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"They probably had this planned, because it looked like they had done a round 
(of the neighborhood) before," De La Reyes said. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests did not seem to console the relatives. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not gangsters here; we're a family," said another of Ibarra's aunts, 
Juanita Peter. "Rosendo was well-respected."

2 PARCELS DROPPED FROM CITYHOOD PLAN

<P>
Leaders of a drive to form a city of Laguna Hills have bowed to requests from 
the Mission Viejo Co. and Leisure World to drop two parcels of land from the 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise decision to pare down the size of the proposed eight-square-mile 
city came hours after cityhood leaders met Wednesday with the county's Local 
Agency Formation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"It's official," said Ellen Martin, chairwoman of the pro-cityhood group, 
Citizens to Save Laguna Hills. "We're going to change the map." 
</P>
<P>
The Mission Viejo Co., which designed the Aliso Viejo Planned Community, has 
opposed the bid to include six Aliso Viejo neighborhoods near the Laguna Hills 
High School in the proposed Laguna Hills city map. 
</P>
<P>
And Leisure World officials said that they opposed inclusion of a shopping 
center and non-residential Leisure World property near Moulton Parkway and El 
Toro Road because they planned to include that property in their own 
incorporation effort. 
</P>
<P>
The two groups had vowed to campaign actively against the incorporation effort 
if the county approves a ballot measure for the November election. 
</P>
<P>
Cityhood leaders, saying that they were sensitive to any strong opposition to 
incorporation, decided to sidestep the growing controversy by asking LAFCO to 
exclude the disputed properties. 
</P>
<P>
The map change also will mean that the proposed city will lose the largely 
undeveloped Forbes Ranch and New World neighborhood, located west of Leisure 
World. 
</P>
<P>
That area, which made up about one-tenth of the city, could be reached only by 
the triangular section of Aliso Viejo bounded by Moulton Parkway on the west, 
Via Lomas and Alicia Parkway on the south, Paseo de Valencia on the east and 
Laguna Hills Road and Leisure World on the north. 
</P>
<P>
A recent poll taken by the Aliso Viejo Community Assn. indicated that 75% of 
the 630 households preferred to remain a part of Aliso Viejo, said Don Swift, 
association director. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of our people are very pleased with the decision and commend the 
(cityhood) committee for realizing that there was considerable opposition," 
Swift said. JAMES M. GOMEZ

GALLEGLY SEEKS U.S. FUNDS IN DRUG FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) on Thursday asked the U.S. Justice 
Department to help finance Ventura County's proposed crackdown on minor drug 
offenses, including jailing recreational drug users in a tent city. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.S. Atty. Gen. Richard Thornburgh, the congressman asked for a 
portion of the department's $85-million discretionary fund to pay for what he 
called "a forward-looking, comprehensive and highly innovative drug-control 
strategy for the county." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Ventura County Sheriff John V. Gillespie and Dist. Atty. Michael D. 
Bradbury unveiled their plan to fight the war on drugs by clamping down on the 
demand created by all drug users. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the stepped-up enforcement of drug possession laws, Gillespie 
proposed jailing inmates in tents on a military base so as not to increase 
crowding at the county jail. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie is negotiating with the Port Hueneme Naval Construction Battalion 
Center to place tents here. Inmates would be assigned to work on the base or on 
public land and to attend substance-abuses classes. 
</P>
<P>
John Frith, Gallegly's press secretary, said the congressman strongly supports 
the proposal and has requested his staff search for possible sources of federal 
dollars. "When we discovered this fund was available, we decided to see if it 
could be a possible source of funding," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie has provided a detailed summary of the program to Gerald Regier, 
acting director of the U.S. Bureau of Justice Assistance, which administers the 
$85-million grant program. Regier could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ventura County Drug Control strategy is very similar to the President's 
National Drug Control Strategy in that it provides a unified, integrated and 
comprehensive approach," Gallegly wrote in his letter to Thornburgh. 
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that the attorney general will support the effort so it could 
serve as a model program of how to fight the drug problem at a local level.

SCHOOL BUDGET CUT PROPOSALS PROTESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY PAULSON and DANICA KIRKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Parents, students and teachers turned up in droves at a Thursday budget hearing 
to protest proposed cuts to the school district's nationally recognized fine 
arts program. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts and others are due to a loss of up to $3 million in state funds from 
the Irvine Unified School District's $84-million annual budget, said David 
Brown, district superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't afford to provide our students with less than they need to succeed in 
school," said Annie Chang, a 14-year-old violinist. "We cannot afford to reduce 
funds for music education in our elementary schools." Items on the proposed 
list of cuts, compiled by a budget task force, are not required under teacher 
contracts or by state law, said Barbara Dresel, a task force member and 
president of the Irvine Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to fine arts, these include business services, district office 
operations, transportation, athletic programs, food services and 
extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
"We seem to have an agreement from all sectors of the task force that we want 
to keep the cuts away from the classroom and everyday programs," Dresel said. 
</P>
<P>
Sizable fine arts budget cuts are proposed only at the elementary school level. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, they would mean that instrumental music lessons held twice a week 
would be offered once a week and visual arts lessons given six times a year 
would only be given three times per year, said Jack Vaughn, coordinator of the 
fine arts program. 
</P>
<P>
The task force is scheduled to present its recommendations for cuts from the 
overall list to the school board on May 15. A special board meeting on the 
reduced list is scheduled for May 21. WENDY PAULSON and DANICA KIRKA

PARENTS ORGANIZING ALL-NIGHT GRAD BASH

Parents at Westminster High School, determined to make this year's graduation a 
safe one, are organizing the first all-night graduation party in the school's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
A committee of about 20 parents is organizing a June 14 "grad night" event, 
which will take the school's 409 graduating seniors on an all-night boat cruise 
around Long Beach Harbor before returning to the school for breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose is to provide them with good memories but also to keep our kids 
safe," said parent Joey Van Camp, the event organizer. 
</P>
<P>
"We were really alarmed by statistics that showed a significant increase in 
deaths of young people during the month of June, when most graduations take 
place." 
</P>
<P>
Westminster High is the last of the six schools in the Huntington Beach Union 
High School District to hold a parent-organized party on the night of 
graduation. 
</P>
<P>
Van Camp, whose son Scott is a graduating senior, said each student will be 
charged $45, which will cover the cruise, food, dancing and photos. 
</P>
<P>
There will be a casino room on the ship, and door prizes such as stereos, 
televisions and trips will be awarded. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic idea of this kind of event is great," Van Camp said. "The kids want 
something to do on graduation night, and we don't want to have to worry about 
them. This satisfies everyone." GREG HERNANDEZ

28 ARRESTED UNDER DAY LABOR LAWS

<P>
Police arrested seven men Thursday for allegedly soliciting work on the street, 
bringing the number of arrests to 28 since a crackdown began last week 
enforcing city day-labor laws. 
</P>
<P>
During the first 10 days of enforcement, 11 workers cited for job solicitation 
and 13 others picked up for a range of violations were turned over to 
immigration officials at the U.S. Border Patrol near San Clemente when they 
could not produce documents proving their legal status. 
</P>
<P>
The city ordinance prohibits laborers from seeking jobs on streets, sidewalks 
and in parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, business has picked up at the city's hiring hall since the city 
ordinance went into effect. An average of 244 men and women used the center 
daily, contrasted with the first month's average of 227 workers. 
</P>
<P>
The number of employers has increased from about five to seven per day. Job 
matches are up from an average of 12 daily to 20. MARY HELEN BERG

SHERIFF IS NAMED IN $15-MILLION LAWSUIT

<P>
A $15-million, wrongful-death lawsuit was filed Wednesday on behalf of a Garden 
Grove widow and her two children against Orange County and Sheriff Brad Gates, 
contending that violence-prone deputies fatally shot her husband in Stanton in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
In the suit filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, Melissa Collins blames 
the Sheriff's Department for the death of her husband, Kenneth Wade Collins, 
28, outside a convenience store on March 28. 
</P>
<P>
The suit contends that the husband was beaten by one or more sheriff's deputies 
and then shot in the back several times. 
</P>
<P>
The suit said that as a matter of "policy and practice," Gates fails to 
adequately supervise and discipline deputies who use unreasonable force on 
citizens, and that he conducts internal investigations into such matters so "as 
to obfuscate and conceal deputy culpability." 
</P>
<P>
Neither the exact number nor names of deputies involved nor the autopsy results 
have been made public. The family's lawyer, Hugh R. Manes, contends that 
Collins was unarmed and that the autopsy will show he was shot in the back. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Department Lt. Richard J. Olson declined to comment on the suit. But 
he said the deputy or deputies involved remain on active duty. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan Brown said his office is still investigating the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Sheriff's Department and Collins' family members, the incident 
began outside the Circle K convenience store on Chapman Avenue when a deputy 
tried to question Kenneth Collins about a robbery. Collins struggled and broke 
free, running south on Dale Street. 
</P>
<P>
The deputy caught Collins in the middle of the street and a second fight began. 
A knife was dropped in the scuffle and Collins began to run away. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department, in a statement released at the time of the shooting, 
said Collins was shot as he then "turned toward the deputy with his hands 
concealed." 
</P>
<P>
The widow seeks $5 million in damages each for herself and her two daughters, 
Felicia Cheri, 5, and infant Tabitha Joy. She also seeks $1 million in punitive 
damages against the deputy or deputies. CATHERINE GEWERTZ

NEWPORT BEACH BUSINESSMAN, CIVIC LEADER NED HILL DIES AT 97

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Edgar R. (Ned) Hill, a Newport Beach businessman and community leader for 
nearly half a century, died Saturday. He was 97. 
</P>
<P>
Hill was one of the founders of the Ackerman Boat Co., a Newport Beach firm 
that built boats for the U.S. government during World War II, and served as the 
first president of Mariners Bank in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Hill's late wife, Dora Hill, was the city's first woman mayor, according to 
their son, Hank Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Bedridden for the last three months, Hill died at his home on Lido Isle of 
natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
"He used to always say he never worked a day in his life," said Hank Hill. "He 
just really enjoyed life and liked to have fun." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Chicago in 1893, Hill graduated from the University of Wisconsin with a 
degree in mechanical engineering. 
</P>
<P>
After serving two years as an Army officer during World War I, Hill moved to 
Southern California and worked at a Los Angeles building materials company 
during the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
He settled in Newport Beach in 1941 and co-founded the Ackerman Boat Co., which 
built tugboats and picket ships for the military. 
</P>
<P>
The company was one of the first to locate on Lido Peninsula, which at the time 
was a vacant sand lot. 
</P>
<P>
After World War II, Hill went into banking, helping found Mariners Bank. The 
one-branch bank on Pacific Coast Highway was later purchased by First 
Interstate Bank. 
</P>
<P>
In 1959, he was elected president of the Newport Harbor Chamber of Commerce. He 
was selected as the group's Man of the Year in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Hill is survived by two sons, Hank Hill of Newport Beach and Ketchum, Ida., and 
Tom Hill of Huntington Beach.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
LOST SIGHT OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Tustin Unified School District is locked in a long contract dispute with 
its teachers that has resulted in some teachers' refusing to give out homework 
assignments. Students understandably regard themselves as interested parties in 
the labor dispute, and to register their dissatisfaction over not getting 
homework, more than 1,000 of them staged a protest at Foothill High School last 
week. Unfortunately, the school's administration has overreacted to the 
demonstration and further displeased not only the teachers but students and 
parents as well. 
</P>
<P>
The latest twist in the dispute centers around the dismissal of Edmund Cronin, 
a transfer student who helped organize the protest. The administration says he 
argued with Principal James Ryan during the demonstration, the last straw in a 
series of transgressions that allegedly included tardiness and unexcused 
absences. Cronin's teachers were upset enough with the dismissal to complain 
about it to Ryan. Although some teachers may sympathize with Cronin, their 
willingness to speak on his behalf also suggests at least something positive 
about him as a student. At the minimum, he deserved a fairer hearing. 
</P>
<P>
As if the flap over Cronin weren't enough, the principal decided to place 110 
other students on probation and put notices about their participation in the 
demonstration in their disciplinary files. The school board has been scrambling 
ever since to explain to angry parents that material in disciplinary files does 
not go to colleges or employers, and that if there are no further incidents 
this school year, the notices will be taken out of the files and students will 
be taken off probation. 
</P>
<P>
What's missing in this mess is any sense that school administrators appreciated 
the concern the students were expressing about their education when they 
protested. They were, after all, asking for homework! Students look to school 
authorities for understanding and wisdom. In this case, all they got in 
response was overbearing authority. 
</P>
<P>
It would have made more sense if the students had been allowed a peaceful 
assembly without consequences. After all, the school system's dispute is with 
its teachers. Now, everybody is unhappy, and the environment for reaching a 
contract settlement has been made even more difficult.

An arrest warrant has been issued for a former Santa Ana lawyer suspected of 
jumping bail while awaiting trial on charges of masterminding a cocaine ring 
linked to drug lords in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
Josue T. Prada, 40, scheduled to go on trial May 22 in federal court, failed to 
report to authorities as required under the terms of his bail, U.S. Atty. 
William McGivern said Wednesday. The Drug Enforcement Agency said it was 
considering Prada a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
Prada, who was born in Bogota, Colombia, but now lives in San Jose, is accused 
of being the kingpin in California for a drug ring that allegedly imported up 
to 2,000 pounds of cocaine, worth as much as $16 million, every year.

MIKE PENNER: FORD TARGETS UCI'S RED INK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is Tom Ford's third day on the job and his office is still designed in 
Modern Cardboard, but behind the stacks of unpacked boxes, UC Irvine's new 
athletic director is doing his best to get acclimated. 
</P>
<P>
A ceramic Anteater pin is affixed to Ford's coat lapel. His navy necktie is 
dotted with tiny yellow Anteaters. 
</P>
<P>
But more than just wear them, Ford has done research. 
</P>
<P>
"I checked a book out of the library, just to understand and learn more about 
anteaters," Ford says. "Maybe we should get a live one. 
</P>
<P>
"At Houston, we had a live Cougar. Baylor has their bear. Texas has Bevo (a 
longhorn steer) and the Aggies have their dogs." 
</P>
<P>
But Ford went by the book and the idea went by the wayside. 
</P>
<P>
"I read that they're quite destructive to land," he says. "They're going to dig 
up an acre real quick. 
</P>
<P>
"So, we're probably going to stick with the bronze statue in front of the Bren 
Center." 
</P>
<P>
Ford, they say, is thorough. Give him a problem and he'll file a report on it, 
complete with three-ring binder and plastic dividers. Ask him about 
fund-raising and he'll whip up a quick lecture on the athletic endowment 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Name him athletic director and he'll commission a personal study on the mascot. 
</P>
<P>
This is a valuable quality, considering the close attention Irvine's sports 
program presently needs. Irvine's athletic teams have been operating in the red 
for at least the past six years -- and for most years since the school turned 
Division I in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Ford was hired on April 16 to try and find a different color ink. 
</P>
<P>
Fund-raising is Ford's background. In addition to his two years as athletic 
director at the University of Houston, Ford also spent three years as the 
school's associate athletic director in charge of fund development. Most 
recently, Ford ran a consulting firm known as Pacific Research Associates, 
which, basically, conducted inventory of major college sports programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the schools that we went to were undergoing a transition of athletic 
directors," Ford says, "where an outside, unbiased group is needed to make some 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, at those institutions, it was all financially driven, probably 
relative to revenues being a shortfall. In some cases, we'd make 
recommendations to the sports programs -- maybe eliminate some sports, maybe 
make some suggestions about promotion and marketing." 
</P>
<P>
In short, Ford was an athletic department trouble-shooter. And, this spring, 
one name stood out at the top of his hit list. 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Ford never got the chance to go in as an outside observer. At the same time, 
UCLA Athletic Director Peter Dalis contacted Ford about the AD vacancy at 
Irvine and nominated him to the board of chancellors. 
</P>
<P>
By mid-April, Ford's job had gone inside. 
</P>
<P>
"The chancellor mentioned to me that he'd like this to be 'the Berkeley of the 
South,' where the emphasis is on academics first and athletics second," Ford 
says. "Well, Berkeley's athletic program is improving, especially in 
basketball. But I told the chancellor I'd prefer us to be 'the Duke of the 
West.' " 
</P>
<P>
Irvine has a ways to go. For one, Duke has students who enjoy going to 
basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
"I recently sat down with a student representative," Ford said, "and, 
basically, there's not a lot of (student) interest there. . . . With all the UC 
schools, there's a certain amount of apathy toward intercollegiate athletics. 
The students here are students first; their commitment to study time outside 
the classroom is high. 
</P>
<P>
"This is where winning comes in. Our students are going to prudently decide 
where to spend their leisure time and dollars. We need to let them know who 
we're playing and when we're playing. And, we need to win." 
</P>
<P>
Basketball being the high-visibility sport at Irvine, Ford has made it a high 
priority. If you want to attract fans and sponsors and athletic endowments, 
Ford reasons, your bread-and-butter sport had better be better than 5-23. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Bill (Mulligan) has done a good job recruiting this year and landed 
three impact players," Ford says. "His contract was rolled over for another 
year just before I got here, which I think was the right thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though he had a poor record this year, Bill has had good success in the 
past. He needs more resources to be successful on the Division I level -- and 
he hasn't had them." 
</P>
<P>
Translation: Ford needs to get Mulligan the money, and the schedule, to recruit 
on a national level. 
</P>
<P>
"A few impact players are all you need in basketball," Ford says. "The year 
Akeem Olajuwon stepped out of a taxicab in front of my office at Houston. 
That's how we recruited him. Clyde Drexler. Scott Brooks and Kevin Magee here. 
It doesn't take much in basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Ford is planning to look into it now that the riddle of the Anteater has been 
solved. 
</P>
<P>
"You know," Ford says, "we don't even have the most unique nickname in college 
sports. No, it's Scottsdale Community College. They're the Artichokes. Their 
colors are pink and green. They've won a national championship in golf." 
</P>
<P>
Ford grins. 
</P>
<P>
"I much prefer 'Anteater.' " 
</P>
<P>
At least from a marketing standpoint, it's easier to swallow.

CENTURY LEAGUE SOFTBALL ROUNDUP;

<P>
FOOTHILL'S TROUBLES MOUNT WITH 5-2 LOSS TO CANYON

<P>
There's no question that the bottom fell out for Foothill High School's 
softball team this week. The only dispute is how far it fell. 
</P>
<P>
After taking a 5-0 record into the second-to-last week of the Century League 
season, Foothill -- ranked 10th in Orange County -- lost to then-last place El 
Modena Tuesday and 5-2 to seventh-ranked Canyon Thursday. And Foothill might 
have to forfeit another. 
</P>
<P>
The league's athletic directors voted Monday that Foothill should forfeit a 
game to Villa Park that was scheduled for April 3 but never played because of a 
scheduling mix-up. However, Foothill Principal Jim Ryan said Thursday that the 
league's principals have yet to declare a forfeit. On the other hand, Villa 
Park Athletic Director Sue Gardiner said the principals have decided, ruling 
the game a forfeit. 
</P>
<P>
With the forfeit, Foothill would 15-11 and 5-3 in third place. 
</P>
<P>
On the field, Foothill committed five errors in five innings and allowed four 
unearned runs in four innings. 
</P>
<P>
Krissy Kyriazis , who went 2 for 3, led off the third inning with a walk and 
scored when right fielder Karen Hernandez missed a fly ball by Maureen Del 
Mazzio. Del Mazzio scored on a squeeze bunt by Traci Himes. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth, Karen Jacobs and Stephanie Carew scored after Kyriazis singled 
to left and left fielder Christina Mazurie let the ball get by her. 
</P>
<P>
"When we get out in front you aren't going to get us," Canyon Coach Lance Eddy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Not when Canyon pitcher Sara Roberts is on her game. Roberts shut down Foothill 
for much of the game, allowing five singles and one earned run. 
</P>
<P>
Relying on her fastball and an occasional changeup, Roberts (12-4) had a 
shutout through four innings until she walked four consecutive batters in the 
fifth. Foothill scored an unearned run in the sixth inning but Canyon center 
fielder Kyriazis singled, moved to second and third on passed balls and scored 
on a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
The victory moved Canyon (19-4, 6-2) into first place in the league. Foothill 
Coach Joe Gonzalez said Foothill, which had four errors against El Modena 
Tuesday, might have committed more errors in the past two games than it has all 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at a forfeit, so it could get really lonely," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we're concerned with fixing the defensive part of our game -- which 
has been our strength -- in time for the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park 8, Santa Ana 3 -- Munique Hernandez (9-4-1) pitched a six-hitter and 
struck out six with no walks to lead host Villa Park (11-10-1, 6-2) Hernandez 
had two hits, scored twice and had one RBI and Jamie Franco and her sister 
Tiffanie Franco each had two hits for Villa Park. 
</P>
<P>
El Modena 6, Santa Ana Valley 5 -- Jennifer Fleming tripled to drive in the 
winning run with one out in the sixth inning for host El Modena (6-15, 3-5). 
Kerry McGowan was 2 for 3 with two RBIs for El Modena.

<P>
Chris Buckels pitched a no-hitter and had four hits, including a home run, to 
lead Liberty Christian to an 18-0 victory over St. Michael's in an Academy 
League baseball game that was stopped after five innings because of the mercy 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
Buckels (5-5) faced the minimum of 15 with 11 strikeouts and one walk, but the 
runner was caught stealing. 
</P>
<P>

FREEDOM'S MAJORITY SEEKS TO THWART SUITORS; 
</P>
<P>
AGREEMENT: THE MAJORITY OWNERS DECIDE TO PROHIBIT SELLING STOCK TO ANYONE BUT 
MEMBERS OF THE TWO FAMILIES WHO CONTROL THE EMBATTLED NEWSPAPER CHAIN.

Majority owners of Freedom Newspapers Inc., worried that dissident shareholder 
Harry H. Hoiles may align himself with takeover specialist Robert M. Bass, have 
created a voting block to thwart unwanted suitors for their family operation. 
</P>
<P>
The majority shareholders, representing two families, hired New York merger 
lawyer Martin Lipton to devise an agreement that votes their shares as a block 
and essentially prohibits them from selling their stock to anyone but members 
of the two families. The actions are meant to "signal to anybody who is 
thinking of making a raid on the company that we're determined to remain a 
privately held, closely held, family company," said Robert C. Hardie, chairman 
of Irvine-based Freedom Newspapers, owner of the Orange County Register and 26 
other daily newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
The actions ensure that the value of the Harry Hoiles family stock would be 
greatly reduced to any outsider. 
</P>
<P>
Hoiles has been battling the families of his sister, Mary Jane Hardie, and late 
brother, Clarence H. Hoiles, for more than a decade in his effort to split up 
the company and take his share of the assets. As heirs to founder R.C. Hoiles, 
the three families each hold about one-third of the shares of Freedom, which 
also owns 25 weekly newspapers and five television stations. 
</P>
<P>
The majority contends that Hoiles is entitled only to the value of his stock, 
not the assets. Hoiles lost lower and appellate court cases to break up the 
assets but plans to ask the state Supreme Court to reverse the rulings. 
</P>
<P>
Hoiles has threatened a number of times to sell his stock to an outside party, 
an act the majority would abhor. Even D. Robert Segal -- a longtime Freedom 
employee who has been the company's president and chief executive for the last 
dozen years and is the only non-family member of the board -- does not own 
shares in the company. 
</P>
<P>
At several Freedom meetings this year, Hoiles was accompanied by Glen Johnson, 
a Ft. Worth, Tex., lawyer, whose firm handles much of the Robert M. Bass 
Group's legal matters. Hoiles' son, Tim, said he had retained the lawyer while 
acting as publisher for Freedom's Pampa, Tex., paper in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Though Hoiles said he has not talked with any Bass people about selling his 
stock to the Ft. Worth investor, the Hardie and Clarence Hoiles branches don't 
believe it. 
</P>
<P>
"We know who the lawyer is. We know the firm and who it represents," said 
Hardie, who also is Harry Hoiles brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
And the majority also knows that the Bass Group -- whose investments include 
American Savings Bank, a Stockton thrift operated out of Irvine -- currently 
holds 40% of Times Publishing, which owns the St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times. 
</P>
<P>
It bought the stake from two granddaughters of founder Paul Poynter and is 
challenging a dividend structure that it believes was a result of an 
acrimonious family feud among Poynter descendants. While Bass says the 
investment is intended to be long-term, newspaper executives there contend that 
Bass has a hidden agenda to take control of the company. 
</P>
<P>
Freedom's majority owners decided to try to prevent a similar occurrence in 
Orange County. Hardie said the majority needed to hire Lipton, regarded as a 
top takeover specialist, because they believe that they could be going up 
against the might of the Bass Group. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new voting block agreement, the shareholders in the two families 
agreed to sell their stock only to each other and to allow a seven-member 
committee, including Hardie, Segal and five family members, to vote the shares 
through the end of 1994, with annual renewals thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement supersedes a previous pact between the two families that required 
current shareholders to offer stock to each other before selling to an 
outsider.

DENNY'S RESTAURANTS BEING REMODELED TO GET AN EDGE OVER RIVALS

<P>
The brown upholstery has been replaced by shades of mauve. Pictures hang on the 
walls and live, green plants are tucked between the tables. 
</P>
<P>
Mini-blinds have replaced curtains, and waiters and waitresses wear neat 
green-pinstriped shirts with green aprons. 
</P>
<P>
This ain't no fern bar. It's the new Denny's. 
</P>
<P>
The chain that has come to symbolize the definitive American coffee shop -- a 
place where waitresses with names like Flo and Vera scurry about in white 
nursing shoes with Grand Slam Breakfast plates lined up their arm -- is out to 
update its image. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more wide open, I guess. It looks like a Coco's," said David Buck of 
Huntington Beach as he sat at a booth at a remodeled Denny's in Costa Mesa 
sipping iced tea. 
</P>
<P>
Denny's Inc. plans to spend $11 million this year to remodel 65 company-owned 
restaurants in Los Angeles and Orange counties. By spring, 1991, the 
Irvine-based company hopes to complete renovation of 146 Denny's outlets in the 
two counties. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials are banking that the new look will head off competition 
ranging from fast-food restaurants and family-style chains such as Coco's and 
Bob's Big Boy. Some rivals have already adopted a newer, cleaner look that 
could give them an appearance edge on Denny's. 
</P>
<P>
Sam H. Maw, president of the 1,283-restaurant Denny's chain, said similar 
renovations at outlets in Arizona and Florida were so successful that the firm 
decided to give its California restaurants the same treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"Our sales and our customer counts are up in our remodeled stores," he said. 
Denny's, a unit of TW Services Inc. of New York, had systemwide sales of $1.3 
billion in 1989, according to Technomic Inc., a Bannockburn, Ill., industry 
consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the make-over was long overdue for a chain that had retained a 
look more closely associated with the 1960s or 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Denny's is hoping for "a little more upscale appearance," Maw said, while 
trying to retain its identity as the same restaurant that legions of regular 
customers know and love. 
</P>
<P>
Maw had a first-hand look at customers' reactions to the change last weekend 
when he and his wife ate breakfast at the Costa Mesa restaurant, one of two 
Orange County outlets to be remodeled so far. 
</P>
<P>
"A party came in and sat at the table adjacent to us, looked around and said, 
'This certainly has changed. It's nice and bright and cheerful.' They were 
presented menus and (one customer) said, 'This all looks good to me.' " 
</P>
<P>
But he realizes that some regulars may not yet appreciate the changes. One 
customer, he said, complained that the restaurant looked too much like a 
doctor's office. 
</P>
<P>
Denny's is trying to position itself as a quality, mid-priced family restaurant 
serving American standards such as pot roast and chicken pie. Experiments with 
such fancy dishes as stuffed trout simply didn't fit the menu, Maw said. 
</P>
<P>
Denny's plans to launch a full-scale promotion highlighting its new look next 
year. In the meantime, Maw said he is enticing new customers by offering free 
meals on customers' birthdays and, to capture some business from fast-food 
chains, promising service within 10 minutes on breakfast and lunch items. 
</P>
<P>
At the Costa Mesa store, the staff says customers have been receptive to the 
changes. "Everyone seems to like it better, said Rick Fields, a waiter. Some 
customers, he said, note the upscale appearance and throw out quips like, "Gee, 
I should have worn a tie."

TWO MEN CHARGED WITH FRAUD IN DOLL DISTRIBUTION CASE

<TEXT>
<P>
Two men who sold dolls bearing the image of customers' children or friends have 
been charged with defrauding distributors, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Laurence Edgar Bergman, 50, of Santa Ana and Chester Robert Cooper, 34, of 
Newport Beach were each charged with 23 felony counts, including 20 charging 
grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a major fraud case," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Mark A. Sevigny. 
</P>
<P>
Both men were released on their own recognizance and will be arraigned today in 
Harbor Municipal Court, Sevigny said. 
</P>
<P>
The two men operated Native Designs Inc. of Newport Beach, which manufactured 
19-inch-high dolls selling for $70 to $100. Customers provided full-face 
photographs of a child, spouse or friend, which was reproduced on the face of 
the so-called "Spitten Images Kids" dolls, Sevigny said. 
</P>
<P>
For 10 months, the two men promised spectacular profits to entice distributors 
to buy special licenses to sell the dolls. Costing between $3,000 and $31,000, 
the license provided the exclusive right to sell in a particular region and a 
nearly 20% commission on every doll sold, Sevigny said. The two men sold 20 
licenses, netting themselves $200,000, Sevigny said. But Native Designs lacked 
the personnel and facilities to produce the thousands of dolls needed to fill 
all orders, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Bergman nor Cooper was available for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very inviting product. It's the type of thing that a lot of people 
would have enjoyed purchasing for their parents or their children," Sevigny 
said. But "these guys made statements that were a misrepresentation of the 
material facts." 
</P>
<P>
"The guys lied to us," said Pat Corridan, 30, of San Diego, who paid $9,000 for 
the license to sell in the city of San Diego. "I just want full restitution." 
</P>
<P>
Bergman and Cooper sold licenses from November, 1988, to August, 1989, Sevigny 
said. They promised extensive marketing support, advertising materials -- 
including sample dolls and store displays -- and prompt delivery on the orders. 
</P>
<P>
But distributors had to argue and cajole to get Native Image to send the sample 
dolls, and often only partial shipments were made, many times of merchandise of 
questionable quality, Sevigny said.

SPEEDY WILL OPEN CENTERS IN JAPAN;

SERVICE: THE ANAHEIM-BASED FIRM IS TO ANNOUNCE A 50-YEAR JOINT VENTURE FOR

<P>
Speedy International Inc. is expected to announce Monday a 50-year joint 
venture agreement with two major Japanese corporations to open American Speedy 
Printing Centers in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim-based Speedy International has teamed up with Canon Sales Inc., the 
marketing arm of the Japanese office equipment and electronics giant, and 
Maruzen Co. Ltd., a large Japanese retailer, to form American Speedy of Japan 
Inc. The companies plan to open the first of five pilot printing shops in Tokyo 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
Speedy International's parent, Kaiser International Inc. in Anaheim, owns the 
licensing rights to American Speedy franchises in California, Hawaii, Nevada, 
Japan and eight other Pacific Rim countries. American Speedy Centers Inc., 
based in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., operates 750 print shops in the United States 
and Canada, 106 of which are licensed to Kaiser International in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Previous efforts by U.S. quick-printing companies to establish operations in 
Japan have failed because of stiff opposition from the Japanese printing 
industry. Speedy is the first U.S. quick-printing firm to team up with large 
Japanese partners to do business in that country. 
</P>
<P>
"While previous American attempts failed, we feel sure that this venture will 
be successful because we have adapted our product line to work with, and not 
compete against, the Japanese light printing industry," said William Culp, 
Speedy's president and chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not taking the Japanese quick printers' business away from them. 
Instead, we're helping them develop new markets for their products and 
services." 
</P>
<P>
American Speedy of Japan is 25% owned by Canon Sales Inc., the Japanese 
marketing arm of Canon Inc., 25% by Tokyo-based Maruzen Co. and 50% by Speedy 
International.

Culp said Kaiser International paid American Speedy less than $10 million for 
franchise rights in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-Japanese venture hopes to open hundreds of print shops throughout 
Japan and hopes to achieve sales of more than $700 million by the year 2000. By 
then, Culp said, Speedy International's earnings from the venture are expected 
to be at least $4.2 million annually. This does not include sales of software, 
printing equipment and other machines.

Each center will have a computer system that can translate material from 
Japanese to English, but the number of languages will increase as the need 
develops, he said.

IRVINE-BASED AST AGREES TO FIVE-YEAR TECHNOLOGY-EXCHANGE PACT WITH IBM 
</P>

<P>
AST Research Inc. signed a licensing agreement with International Business 
Machines Corp. that allows the companies to exchange patented technology, the 
companies said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Irvine personal computer maker will make fixed 
payments to IBM over a five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
The broad agreement covers computers, peripheral products, communications gear 
and related products. 
</P>
<P>
"We view this agreement as recognition of our expanding patent portfolio and an 
acknowledgment of the technological contributions AST has made in the computer 
industry," said Safi Qureshey, AST's president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the agreement were not disclosed, but AST said it has set aside 1% 
of personal computer sales since July, 1988, in anticipation of such licensing 
payments. AST said the funds set aside during that period are sufficient to 
cover the payments owed to IBM. 
</P>
<P>
Qureshey said the agreement will enhance AST's product development efforts.

STATE COUNCIL ASSAILS O.C. ARTS FUNDING; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTY GOVERNMENT: ONE ANGRY OFFICIAL BLAMES A "LIBERTARIAN MENTALITY" FOR THE 
LACK OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR A LOCAL ARTS COUNCIL. 
</P>

A state arts advisory panel Thursday denounced the Orange County Board of 
Supervisors for its reluctance to commit county funds to a local arts council. 
One California Arts Council official criticized what she called the county's 
"libertarian mentality" toward government funding of the arts and said the 
private funding of the county's Performing Arts Center "could be one of the 
worst things that ever happened to the arts in the state." 
</P>
<P>
The comments came as the CAC panel was throwing its support behind an ad hoc 
committee of 27 Orange County arts leaders, recommending that the committee 
serve as the county's official arts representative, or "state-local partner," 
until a permanent local council can be formed. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County is one of only six counties in the state without a state-local 
partnership and is therefore ineligible to receive state and federal grants for 
redistribution to local arts groups. One local arts official estimates that 
this is costing the county up to $80,000 a year in money for arts programs. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the county supervisors instructed various county agencies to 
study the feasibility of creating a local arts council and sanctioned the ad 
hoc committee's efforts to serve as an interim state-local partner, but they 
refused to consider how the council might be funded. A county administrative 
office study had recommended allocating up to $50,000, a fraction of the 
$285,200 initially recommended by the ad hoc committee. County support of the 
arts historically has been minimal. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night, the state panel recommended that the ad hoc committee, which 
has been meeting since last year, receive $12,500 in seed money for a full-time 
council. The state will vote June 1 on the panel's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
The $12,500 would "reward the committee for what it has already done and say to 
local government that we want the art community's voice to be heard," said 
Gloria Woodlock, the CAC's state-local program manager. 
</P>
<P>
But beyond that, she said, the panel wants to send a "very strong message to 
local government in Orange County that it needs to support the arts 
financially." 
</P>
<P>
Woodlock noted that last year all 51 state-local partners in California 
received either municipal or county funding. 
</P>
<P>
Woodlock told the panelists that a large part of the problem is "Orange 
County's libertarian mentality." For instance, she said, every time the 
supervisors are asked to fund the arts, they point to the $73.3-million Orange 
County Performing Arts Center, saying, "Well, they did that with private 
money." 
</P>
<P>
The Center's funding "could be one of the worst things that ever happened to 
the arts in the state as far as local government support of the arts goes," 
Woodlock said. 
</P>
<P>
(Reached for comment, Center President Thomas R. Kendrick said his board and 
staff endorse creation of a publicly assisted arts council in Orange County. 
"We, of course, are extremely proud of the unprecedented private support 
demonstrated by this community for the Center in its construction and 
operation. But that certainly does not mean that we oppose government support 
for the arts," Kendrick said.) 
</P>
<P>
Panelist Lance Linares, director of the Cultural Council of Santa Cruz, 
recommended making any CAC state-local funding to Orange County contingent on a 
guarantee of county money for a local council. "I'm afraid if we don't make it 
uncomfortable for the supervisors, they'll never give any money," he said, 
adding that as a countywide council grows, it would be "doomed" without some 
county funding. 
</P>
<P>
Panelist Mary Anne Hedderson, cultural affairs officer for the city of Oakland, 
said, "The whole point of this is that the public sector does have a role. It's 
not enough, especially in an urban center, to say private-sector support is 
sufficient." 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors will take up the question of a local arts council during their 
1990-91 budget hearings, beginning in July.

FASHIONABLE MEN ARE LOOSENING UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
On a sunny winter day, Tom Julian stood on the tailored grounds of the Dana 
Point Resort and decided that it would be the perfect setting for a photo 
shoot. 
</P>
<P>
He liked the hotel's Cape Cod feel. He liked the ocean. He liked the park. But 
most of all, he liked Orange County's warm climate and clear skies. 
</P>
<P>
As associate fashion director of the Men's Fashion Assn. of America in New 
York, Julian helps assemble press kits of spring and fall menswear for 
newspapers and magazines across the country. 
</P>
<P>
In March he arrived in Dana Point with four models, two photographers and a 
load of men's clothing in tow for 10 days of intense shooting. 
</P>
<P>
And then it rained. 
</P>
<P>
"They say it'll clear up tomorrow," said Julian, on a dreary afternoon just two 
days before the end of shooting. "But they've been saying that for two days 
now." 
</P>
<P>
So they shot anyway under cloudy skies or inside the hotel, and when the sun 
did shine they hurried outside to photograph all of that rugged outdoor wear 
they had brought from the East. 
</P>
<P>
"We did complete the shoot," Julian said recently from his New York office. 
"But we were a little hurried at the end." 
</P>
<P>
Long before his trip West, Julian had polled members of the MFA, including 
manufacturers, designers and retailers in the menswear industry, about their 
views on clothing trends. 
</P>
<P>
Their predictions will appear in the MFA press kits photographed in Dana Point 
and sent to editors at 650 publications across the country later this month and 
early June. 
</P>
<P>
Each editor will receive 33 8-by-10 black-and-white photographs (color slides 
available) of the association's fall preview. Good exposure for the MFA 
members. Good exposure for the Dana Point Resort. 
</P>
<P>
"Our press kit isn't the Bible. It's just observations and feedback from our 
members," Julian said. 
</P>
<P>
If the MFA's fashion forecast proves correct, men will don clothes with soft 
textures and relaxed silhouettes in warm, earthy colors, a definite departure 
from gray three-piece power suits. 
</P>
<P>
"Men can get away from the slick, styled-up look of the '80s to the more 
casual, soft look of the '90s," Julian said. 
</P>
<P>
Fall wardrobes will have a comfortable feel, with a lot of quilted jackets, 
knit vests, flannel shirts and corduroy and brushed cotton pants, he said. 
Quilted fabrics, an especially strong treatment, appear on sportswear by 
Nautica, Ruff Hewn, Richard Mishaan and Mondo. 
</P>
<P>
Sweaters will take on velvety textures and fun suede details. The association 
chose hand-loomed sweaters made of soft chenille by Marienbad with colorful 
suede accents -- one with palm prints across the front and another festooned 
with over-size suede M &amp; Ms. 
</P>
<P>
Even denim jeans, the staple of men's casual wear, will have a softer look. 
Instead of acid-washed, they'll be "Pepper Used" by the Lee Co. so they look 
slightly faded, not harshly bleached. 
</P>
<P>
Overcoats will come in plush blends of wool and cashmere with such functional 
features as pouch pockets and hoods. 
</P>
<P>
"I see a lot of rugged wear," Julian said. "People are becoming more 
environmentally concerned. President Bush loves to go fishing and boating, and 
that does influence the business." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, coats one could wear camping will be seen on city streets. The MFA took 
an oak-colored leather toggle coat with antler tips for fasteners, similar to 
the one William Hurt wore in "The Accidental Tourist," and paired it with a 
gold corduroy shirt with leather detail and tooled leather boots with silver 
tips. 
</P>
<P>
Earth tones not seen for years in men's wardrobes will be strong, a carry-over 
from the heavy ethnic influence in women's wear. 
</P>
<P>
"Gold is really important for fall. So are all the spice and berry shades," 
Julian said. 
</P>
<P>
One model wore a yellow cotton cable-knit sweater with a flannel campfire plaid 
shirt, toast-colored pleated pants by Nautica made of brushed cotton, and an 
emerald and burgundy zip jacket with a hood and double-entry front pocket. 
</P>
<P>
Men will be encouraged to mix and match contrasting colors and textures. More 
adventurous types will pair olive pants with a purple and gold sweater. 
</P>
<P>
For the truly fashion-forward male, the MFA chose a single-breasted sports coat 
from A.B.S. that has contrasting panels in berry, gold and navy. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting away from dress-for-success rules," Julian said. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative dressers will find plenty of double-breasted suits for their 
business wardrobes from manufacturers such as Botany 500, Alfred Dunhill, Palm 
Beach and Cecilia Metheny. The press kit will feature a navy pinstriped suit by 
Alfred Dunhill with peak lapels, wider shoulders and flap pockets. The suit 
will be shown with a white cotton shirt with blue and green pinstripes and a 
navy and white silk paisley tie. 
</P>
<P>
Vests will come on strong in the fall, according to Julian, but not the kind 
that are cut from the same cloth as one's suit. Instead, vests made of 
contrasting fabrics and patterns will be popular, such as the gray and navy 
knit vest with the textured brocade pattern. 
</P>
<P>
"Vests are most successful with the MTV generation," Julian said. "A corduroy 
shirt with a vest, denim jeans and boots is the look. You can wear it in L.A. 
and look fabulous." 
</P>
<P>
Suit silhouettes will be more relaxed, with fuller-cut, pleated pants and loose 
jackets. 
</P>
<P>
"The shoulder treatment is wider than it used to be," Julian said. "It's now 18 
inches across instead of 17 so it gives you a very relaxed, elegant look." 
</P>
<P>
For formal occasions, expect to see men wearing double-breasted tuxedos with 
shawl collars, "like the one Billy Crystal wore to the Academy Awards," Julian 
said. To go with the tuxes, the industry is promoting rich tapestry suspenders, 
such as a red paisley weave. 
</P>
<P>
Other accessories call for louder designs and patterns. 
</P>
<P>
Socks, once limited to bland navy and gray solid knits, are stepping out. 
Patterned hosiery is making its way up the corporate ladder, with small white 
diamonds or a hound's tooth print for conservatives and over-size paisleys or 
retro-style geometrics for the playful. 
</P>
<P>
More daring dressers will find plenty of what Julian calls "conversational 
ties," with loud, antique prints. His choice: a retro tie by Modules with a 
navy and berry pattern featuring dancing ballerinas. 
</P>
<P>
"Men are starting to realize that rather than look like a guy in a navy suit, 
if they wear things like patterned hosiery or retro ties, they make an 
impression," Julian said. "We don't want to overpower our wives or girlfriends, 
but we do want to make a statement." 
</P>
<P>
Yet even Julian warned men not to be carried away by the latest fad. 
</P>
<P>
"If a guy feels funny about wearing ballerinas around his neck, he shouldn't do 
it," he said. "He's going to feel uncomfortable."

At Girard's College of Beauty in Santa Ana, Cathy Thomassen of Newport Beach 
settles into a salon chair and awaits the royal treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting a full set of acrylic nails, a French braid and an eyelash tint -- 
all for $24.75," she says as a student combs through her long, wet hair. "It 
would cost me about $50 in a salon." 
</P>
<P>
Those who like to be pampered don't have to be rich to indulge in such 
luxuries. Beauty schools offer the same services as professional salons at much 
lower prices. The catch: Customers must be willing to trust their tresses and 
faces and nails to novices, and they don't enjoy the ambience of a designer 
interior or the benefit of the state-of-the-art equipment of a trendy salon. 
</P>
<P>
Girard's interior, for instance, consists of concrete walls painted an off 
shade of mauve, a matching linoleum floor and a dozen well-worn vinyl chairs. 
</P>
<P>
It matters little to Thomassen that her surroundings are less than regal, so 
long as she leaves the place looking like a queen. 
</P>
<P>
"The ambience is not as classy, but I'm not paying for ambience," says Toni 
Rogan, a 38-year-old Mission Viejo resident who had stopped in at Lake Forest 
Beauty College in El Toro to have her brown hair trimmed. Here, customers sat 
in mismatched orange and brown vinyl chairs while students in white lab coats 
painted their toenails, rolled their hair in curlers and went at them with 
scissors and blow dryers. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate walking into a snooty salon where everyone actually looks at what 
you're wearing or what you're driving," Rogan says. 
</P>
<P>
The colleges offer every service performed in professional salons, including 
hair coloring, facials, make-overs, pedicures and eyebrow tints. Colleges 
charge about $5 for a haircut alone, and $8.50 for a cut with blow-dry. Salons 
can be expected to charge $35 or more for a cut and blow-dry. A manicure done 
by a student costs about $4, whereas one by a professional is around $12. The 
students work for college credit and for tips. 
</P>
<P>
"They can get a major overhaul for under $20," Pat Follis, supervising 
instructor at Girard's, says about the school's customers. 
</P>
<P>
Adding a labor-intensive treatment such as a permanent or color weaving to a 
cut-and-style will push the fee to about $25. Permanents and color weaving are 
among the most expensive services professional salons offer. Rogan, for 
instance, said she recently paid a professional stylist $150 for a haircut and 
color weaving. 
</P>
<P>
But because all of the work is done by students, some customers are reluctant 
to risk a more advanced procedure at a beauty college. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's something more complicated like a weave, I'll go to a regular salon," 
Thomassen says. "But if it's a simple thing like a braid, I'll do it at the 
college. The service is always good, and with the money I save, I can get it 
done three times a month instead of once." 
</P>
<P>
Joanne Kandare, a 27-year-old El Toro resident, has no such qualms. On a recent 
weekday morning at Lake Forest, she was willingly subjecting her long brown 
locks to a spiral perm. 
</P>
<P>
"They wouldn't be doing perms if they didn't know how," Kandare says. "I've 
always gone to beauty colleges. It's cheaper, and usually the students are more 
conscientious. And the instructor's right there" to guide them. 
</P>
<P>
School directors say that no one will walk out of the college with a coiffure 
resembling a green Brillo pad. 
</P>
<P>
"Patrons are never guinea pigs," Follis says. 
</P>
<P>
Before they snip a single strand of a customer's hair, Follis says, the 
students have spent hundreds of hours practicing on school dolls' heads, on 
their friends, on their relatives and on each other. 
</P>
<P>
Still, accidents do happen. Lake Forest student Diana Discenzo, 20, said that 
when she performed a color weave on her first customer, she discovered that the 
highlighting shade had bled into the surrounding hair. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of little blotches where it leaked through," Discenzo said, 
"so we put a toner in. I fixed up my mistake, and she was happy. 
</P>
<P>
"I learn by my mistakes," says Discenzo, who hopes to work as a cosmetologist 
on a cruise ship after she graduates later this month. "But the customers are 
more understanding because they came to a school." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, says George Nadeau, owner of the Lake Forest college, "patrons have to 
understand this is all student work." 
</P>
<P>
"The students have different degrees of performance, but once they're on the 
floor, they're already prepared to work on customers. And these students do 
some great work." 
</P>
<P>
"They aren't paid, so they're more apt to take their time," Follis says. "It's 
a more relaxed atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Students aren't watching the clock, she says. They don't care whether the 
customer has long hair that takes four hours to perm. 
</P>
<P>
Most beauty colleges are under a contract with a community college, Regional 
Occupational Program or adult education program. These pay the colleges out of 
state education funds to act as their cosmetology schools. 
</P>
<P>
Students who register for the Lake Forest beauty school through Saddleback 
College, for instance, pay $50 a semester to Saddleback and $300 to the beauty 
school for their supply kits. They graduate from the beauty college after four 
semesters and 1,600 hours. Then they take a state exam for a cosmetology 
license. 
</P>
<P>
Although patrons can make several appointments with a favorite student, they 
know they can't become too attached because graduation is never far away. 
</P>
<P>
"I've already seen two students graduate," says June Adsit, 68, of Laguna 
Hills, a regular at Lake Forest. "I figure: 'Good for her. She's done it.' I 
feel like I'm a granny to them all." 
</P>
<P>
The colleges have a large following among people over 50 -- especially the Lake 
Forest school, which draws heavily from nearby Leisure World in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, many older patrons make their visits to the beauty college a weekly 
ritual. The low prices appeal to those on a fixed income. Others simply like 
the slower pace. They also get a chance to mingle while they have their nails 
painted and their hair washed and set. 
</P>
<P>
"I love seeing the young people," says Elizabeth Frederickson, 84, of Leisure 
World. "I come here every week." 
</P>
<P>
As a young student finishes cutting her hair, he holds her hand and gently pats 
her shoulder. She clearly likes the attention. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband's not well," says a white-haired woman at Girard's who asks not to 
be identified. "It's good to get away and get some tender loving care. It's 
like therapy." 
</P>
<P>
For vanity's sake, some patrons don't want others to know they go to a beauty 
school. Beauty colleges still carry a stigma. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want my friends to know I come," says an elderly woman who would not 
give her name. She has been coming to the Lake Forest college for four years. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd think it's terrible," she says. "But otherwise, I could only get my 
hair done once a month." 
</P>
<P>
The economics of it have prompted many people, young and old, to swallow their 
pride. 
</P>
<P>
"I go to two colleges, and both are getting busier," Thomassen says. "More 
people are catching on."

A fire pushed by gusty winds scorched 850 acres of brush and threatened a small 
apartment complex before firefighters contained it. The fire caused about 
$25,000 in damage to telephone poles and equipment owned by General Telephone. 
Fire officials said they initially expected to contain the blaze to 10 acres, 
but winds gusting up to 15 m.p.h. spread the flames, and reinforcements were 
called in.

<P>
The University of California faculty senate voted to add a year of laboratory 
science and a new history course as part of the requirements for freshman 
admission to the university. The recommendations would require a second year of 
a lab science, such as biology or chemistry, with the stipulation that the 
second-year course be in a different discipline than the first. 
</P>
<P>
Students would also have to take a course in world history, cultures and 
geography in addition to a U.S. history course. If the UC Board of Regents 
approve the changes, they would take effect for high school seniors graduating 
in the spring of 1994. Currently, high school seniors must complete four years 
of English, three years of math, two years of a foreign language, one year of 
history and one of a lab science to be eligible for entrance to a UC campus.

The state Senate defeated an Assembly-passed bill that would give people whose 
health was damaged by malathion spraying a clear path to sue governmental 
entities and the makers and suppliers of the controversial pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
The bill by Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) failed on an 18-13 vote, 
three short of the 21 necessary for approval. Senators from agricultural 
districts teamed to block its passage. The bill would have given injured 
citizens the right to sue the manufacturer and supplier of malathion and the 
government entities which authorized the spraying up to a year after discovery 
of the alleged injury.

SOME COMMUNITY LEADERS QUESTION IF HOLIDAY IS TOO COMMERCIAL IN THE SOUTHLAND. 
OTHERS WELCOME SPONSORS AND THEIR MONEY.

<P>
If Vivien Bonzo has her way, Cinco de Mayo celebrants will leave Olvera Street 
this weekend with a sense of Mexican orgullo -- pride. Mariachi music will 
remind Angelenos of the city's origins. Colorful ballet folklorico dancers will 
remind them of Mexico's rich cultural heritage. 
</P>
<P>
Bonzo's fear is that the crowds tomorrow and Sunday -- expected to number 
40,000 -- will leave, not with a sense of orgullo, but rather, with free 
cigarettes, disposable diapers and laundry detergent. 
</P>
<P>
"I want my people to leave Olvera Street with pride, not products," says Bonzo, 
who is president of the Olvera Street Merchant's Assn. and one voice in a 
growing chorus of concern over the commercialization of Cinco de Mayo. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate sponsors now underwrite a portion of the costs of the Olvera Street 
festivities -- which commemorate the Mexican victory over the French forces of 
Louis Napoleon in the Battle of Puebla 128 years ago -- and sponsorship 
sometimes includes product giveaways. In the past, corporate sponsors of May 5 
celebrations in Southern California have included beer and alcohol companies. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, for many Angelenos, Cinco de Mayo has become synonymous with rowdy 
behavior and drinking. Last year, gang-related violence, bolstered by 
drunkenness, ruined a holiday celebration at Lincoln Park in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Bonzo and other Latinos would like to substitute history for hype and are 
working to ensure that the holiday is observed with less fanfare and more 
dignity -- as it is in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Alberto Diaz, spokesman for the Mexican Consulate, says that in Mexico, Cinco 
de Mayo is celebrated "on a smaller scale by civic groups." He says only the 
southeastern Mexican state of Puebla celebrates May 5 on a grand scale. 
</P>
<P>
Says Juana Mora, research associate at UCLA's Chicano Studies Research Center: 
"The commercialization of Lincoln Park's event all but destroyed it." (The 
event, which featured rock bands and attracted 60,000 people last year, was 
shut down early and led to this year's ban on alcohol. It also prompted a 
return to a family-oriented atmosphere after more than 20 community-based 
organizations met to plan this weekend's event, "without major entertainment 
and without beer," says event chairman Tony Trancale.) 
</P>
<P>
Historian Rudy Acuna, a professor of Chicano studies at Cal State Northridge, 
agrees with Mora. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't like the commercialization of Cinco de Mayo. In the past, the day 
was celebrated (in the United States) like a regular Mexican holiday, but now, 
everybody wants a piece of it -- the commercialization. It's become the Cinco 
de Mayo happy hour." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like Black History Month. There is a meaning to Black History Month, 
(but) I don't think there is too much meaning that you find with Cinco de Mayo. 
There should definitely be more thought coming into the real reason for 
celebrating that day -- political, historical and cultural reasons." 
</P>
<P>
For many Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, Cinco de Mayo serves as "inspiration 
for their own struggle against injustice," says Fernando Guerra, chairman of 
the Chicano Studies Department at Loyola Marymount University. 
</P>
<P>
"Commercializing Cinco de Mayo allows you to communicate it to a much broader 
audience, but in the process, the real meaning is diluted -- and that meaning 
is survival of a culture." 
</P>
<P>
Guerra adds that the event's "commercialization makes it acceptable to be 
Mexican on Cinco de Mayo, especially with the younger kids, because it has been 
taken in by the larger culture as a holiday. But it should be acceptable to be 
Mexican or Mexican-American if that's your culture and to be proud of the 
Mexican culture every day." 
</P>
<P>
Leticia Quezada, a board member of the Los Angeles Unified School District, 
says this is the first year the board -- at her urging -- mandated that 
teachers devote lesson plans to Cinco de Mayo and El Dia del Maestro (Teacher's 
Day), another tradition observed in Mexico in May. Teachers have been devoting 
this week -- and some, the entire month of May -- to enlightening students 
about Mexican history, leaders and culture much in the way Black History Month 
is observed. Parents and community leaders also have been involved. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important for Latino children (who make up 62% of the district's 
enrollment) to feel proud about who they are, proud about the Mexican culture 
and to see that Mexican culture held up as a model because then that raises 
their self-esteem as Mexican children," says Quezada. She adds that although 
corporate sponsorship for Cinco de Mayo events "enables these activities to 
carry on in the absence of government funding it is important that Mexican 
celebrations not lose their cultural value because of heavy drinking and 
violence." 
</P>
<P>
Historically, Acuna says Cinco de Mayo observances first became "popular among 
Chicano activists in the early 1970s. That's when beer and other corporate 
sponsors jumped on the bandwagon" by helping to promote the celebration in 
Mexican-American communities. Before that time, academics say, the celebration 
was usually a neighborhood or family affair. 
</P>
<P>
"The media picked up on it and so did the beer industry," says Mora, who is 
presently conducting a two-year research project on Mexican-American women and 
alcohol. She says that in 1988, alcohol companies spent close to $25 million on 
Cinco de Mayo promotions in Southern California alone. 
</P>
<P>
Mora, who contributed to "Marketing Disease to Hispanics," a booklet published 
last year by the Washington-based Center for Science in the Public Interest, 
has researched the roles alcohol and tobacco companies play in the Latino 
community. With the center's support she and Acuna are working to establish the 
Latino Council on Alcohol and Tobacco "to counter some of the negative aspects 
brought on by the commercialization of holidays in the Chicano community. 
</P>
<P>
"We are also critical of Latino national organizations and local ones who 
accept funding for events (like Cinco de Mayo) and how they allow corporate 
sponsors to promote products such as beer and cigarettes that endanger the 
health of our community." 
</P>
<P>
Olvera Street's May 5 celebrations have been partially funded by commercial 
sponsors for several years. This year's events -- produced by Riverside 
Promotions, a Hollywood-based Latino marketing firm appointed by City 
Councilman Richard Alatorre -- have 50 commercial sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Mariscal, owner of the Velasco Souvenir Shop on Olvera Street and a member 
of the merchant's group, says, "If the commercialization of it can be toned 
down and the Mexican culture elevated that would be terrific." (Some merchants 
are also upset over the city's plans to restore the area; they accuse the city 
of wanting to "dilute" Olvera Street's Mexican-American flavor by bringing in 
multi-ethnic businesses and attractions nearby.) 
</P>
<P>
Al Avila, chief deputy for Councilman Alatorre (Olvera Street is located in 
Alatorre's district), and Fernando Favela, general manager for Riverside 
Promotions, say corporate sponsors who will foot the six-figure bill for the 
Olvera Street fiesta are necessary because of cutbacks in city funding for such 
events. 
</P>
<P>
Avila and Favela contend that because of corporate involvement, there is more 
money to publicize events and pay for entertainment. This year, Cinco de Mayo 
events and entertainment at Olvera Street include mariachi bands, ballet 
folklorico dancers, singers and bands. 
</P>
<P>
"These celebrations are not cheap," Avila says about the celebration he calls 
"the premiere event in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
"You have to do everything from closing streets, build stages, take care of 
electrical systems, set up booths and pay for entertainment. There is a lot of 
overhead and you need sponsors for that." (Last Sunday, commercial sponsors, 
including Procter &amp; Gamble, AT&amp;T, Kern's Juices and Acapulco 
restaurants, helped underwrite a $1-million pre-Cinco de Mayo festival attended 
by 500,000 in downtown Los Angeles.) 
</P>
<P>
Avila says Cinco de Mayo participants must look beyond the commercialization of 
the event and enjoy and share the Mexican culture. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just a party in a park. It's a party in a historical monument," 
Favela says, referring to the Olvera Street's Mexican market area as Los 
Angeles' birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
As for the sponsors he has assembled for the Olvera Street event (as well as 
for the Cinco de Mayo celebration at Centennial Regional Park in Santa Ana -- 
one of the largest in Orange County) Favela says visitors do not have to 
partake in the product giveaways or drink beer. 
</P>
<P>
He says critics who oppose the commercial sponsors do not realize "that the 
commercialization needs to be there to make the event work." 
</P>
<P>
"It says a lot about a company when that company recognizes the Hispanic 
community and that the community has a lot of potential as consumers," Favela 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the Olvera Street booths, as well as some of the restaurants, will sell 
beer. 
</P>
<P>
None will be sold at Lincoln Park because last year, more than 150 police 
officers were called to the park to quell a disturbance after one man was shot 
and several others were injured, including a police officer, when fighting 
erupted between street gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of drinking going on," says Trancale, who adds that $22,000 worth 
of beer was sold. (Miller beer was a sponsor of the event.) "We had a lot of 
gang violence and there were thousands of people and families who wanted to 
have a good time and didn't." 
</P>
<P>
But, he points out that corporate sponsors bought top-name entertainers like 
Sheila E. And "thousands of kids in the area were benefiting from the money 
raised." 
</P>
<P>
This year's liquor ban at Lincoln Park has resulted in little attention from 
major sponsors, which will make the three-day event, which starts today, 
"financially difficult" to produce, Trancale says. But two sponsors are helping 
to pay for a carnival and a children's entertainment area highlighting 
acrobats, folklorico groups and the California Youth Theatre ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
Trancale is glad to be a part of an event that is being returned to area 
families. 
</P>
<P>
"We're offering another option to people. We are trying to rebuild the park's 
credibility with the public. We are giving back Cinco de Mayo to the area's 
Mexican and Mexican-American families." 
</P>
<P>
Guillermo Hernandez, co-chairman of the United Neighborhoods Organization, says 
he and other parents are happy about the renewed focus for this year's event. 
</P>
<P>
But they are most pleased with ban on beer. 
</P>
<P>
"Our celebration this year is more in the spirit of Cinco de Mayo," says 
Hernandez, who lives a few blocks from Lincoln Park and has been attending the 
Cinco de Mayo celebrations there for years. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always wanted for Cinco de Mayo in Lincoln Park to focus more on the 
family and the kids. Most of the time these celebrations use beer companies to 
make money but they never focus on why we are celebrating, on the culture. 
</P>
<P>
"So this year we're having different folklorico groups and mariachis -- no rock 
'n' roll bands, no product giveaways. We want to show different communities 
that we can do an event without beer and have fun."

Guess?, the label that has adorned so many teen-age derrieres, seems to be 
growing up. A line of women's clothing, with definite career possibilities, is 
now in stores. 
</P>
<P>
The garments are intended for customers who have grown up with Guess? over the 
past nine years, according to a statement issued by Georges Marciano, designer 
and company president. Concentrating on tailored pieces, he has designed a 
spring collection that includes a smart, fitted, cherry-red linen suit as well 
as a lightweight blazer and well-cut, cropped, plaid pants.

Fall pieces, made in fabrics such as melton and wool-cashmere blends, have a 
fit-and-flare attitude, as seen in a swingy skirt and a cuffed, two-button 
jacket.

Prices range from $50 to $375.

Marciano refers to the new concept as "sophisticated city clothing for a young 
career woman." 
</P>
<P>
Who knows, perhaps the Brigitte Bardot look-alike in company ads will soon 
outgrow her jeans and lace bustier, hop off the motorcycle, put away the 
Italian cookbook, find a real job and slip into something more serious. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Marciano's provocative ads, his business acumen and his 
generosity toward future designers have earned him this year's Otis/Parsons 
Fashion achievement award. It will be presented in a ceremony on Saturday 
night.. 
</P>
<P>
"Guess? has become a major fashion force, with his impetus obviously. He's 
changed perceptions of fashion as well as changed the look of clothing," says 
Frances Balcomb, director of communications for the Otis Art Institute of 
Parsons School of Design in Los Angeles. "There's a kind of energy and youthful 
optimism in Marciano's clothing. And, as a designer, he has been extremely 
generous in helping our students."

AMTRAK: THE OXNARD LINE IS A 'TOURIST TRAIN.' BUT THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS -- 
PEOPLE WHO DON'T WORK AT 8-TO-5 JOBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
About 20 people sipped coffee and read the newspaper Thursday at the Oxnard 
train station as they waited for the morning's only train to Los Angeles and 
points south. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen passengers stood in line, inching suitcases toward the window where a 
lone Amtrak agent dispensed tickets. 
</P>
<P>
It would have been easy to mistake the waiting passengers for commuters except 
for one clue -- no briefcases. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 30 people who boarded Amtrak No. 774 at Oxnard, only a few were 
commuters traveling to or from work. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a tourist train," said Charlie Glass, one of two conductors on the 
five-car train. 
</P>
<P>
"Why don't more commuters take it? Wrong times." 
</P>
<P>
No. 774 leaves Oxnard at 8:45 a.m., stops in Simi Valley at 9:15 and pulls into 
Union Station in downtown Los Angeles at 10:30. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have flexibility in your schedule," said Jim Whitney, a publishing 
executive who lives in Santa Barbara and commutes to work in Los Angeles twice 
a week. 
</P>
<P>
But people such as Whitney who don't work 8-to-5 say the train beats the 
freeway by a country mile -- or by half an hour or so, depending on traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"I can read, work, catch up on correspondence," Whitney said, sipping coffee as 
the train glided past orchards and strawberry fields, paralleling California 34 
and 118 through Camarillo, Somis and Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to spend 10 hours a week on the freeway. Now I can devote that time to 
work." 
</P>
<P>
William Hager, an arson investigator with the Ventura County Fire Department, 
said he sometimes brings along a laptop computer to do reports while commuting 
between Oxnard and his home in Dana Point, in south Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to take me four hours on the freeway," said Hager, who moved a few 
years ago from Camarillo to Orange County, where his wife works. "I was a 
basket case when I got home." 
</P>
<P>
For the past year, Hager has been riding the train instead of driving 106 miles 
each way. It helps that his work schedule calls for 24 hours on duty, followed 
by one or more days off. Even so, there are disadvantages in taking the train, 
especially when traveling north. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to leave home 14 hours early and spend the night at the fire station," 
he said. His shift starts at 8 a.m., and Amtrak's first northbound train 
doesn't arrive in Oxnard until 11:21. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, he has to keep a car in each county. All the same, he said, "it 
sure beats driving in the L.A. traffic." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of brake lights and billboards, train riders see some of the best and 
worst of Ventura County and the San Fernando Valley. From Moorpark, No. 774 
cuts through Oak Tree Park in Simi Valley and winds past giant boulders strewn 
about the entrance of the 7,000-foot Santa Susana Tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, almost everything seems gray at first: the walled-off 
subdivisions of Chatsworth, the industrial parks of Northridge, the nearly 
empty shopping center in Van Nuys. On Thursday even the midmorning sky was gray 
as the train approached downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Brandt of Ojai apparently was the only Ventura County resident boarding 
at Oxnard and returning the same day. She was visiting her brother in San 
Clemente to discuss their plans for a jewelry business. She appreciated the 
convenience of not driving, but said she would have preferred getting back a 
little earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The single train returning to Ventura County departs Los Angeles at 7:50 p.m., 
stops in Simi Valley at 8:55 and arrives in Oxnard at 9:25. 
</P>
<P>
In scheduling trains, Amtrak does not target the commuter market, spokeswoman 
Sue Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are by definition an intercity carrier, not a commuter service," Martin 
said. "While some people may find it convenient to use Amtrak from Baltimore to 
Washington, for example, we don't pursue that market." 
</P>
<P>
If Amtrak scheduled its trains primarily with commuters in mind, she said, it 
would often run out of seats for higher-revenue, long-distance passengers. 
</P>
<P>
She noted that in some areas, Amtrak operates commuter trains that are paid for 
by local agencies. Such a service began this week in Orange County, which is 
financing an Amtrak-operated commuter train from San Juan Capistrano to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Similar trains could be operating from Ventura County within a year, said Mary 
Travis, manager of transportation programs for the Ventura County 
Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The trains would be part of a system running through the San Fernando Valley 
and subsidized by Los Angeles County, Travis said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Los Angeles County, Ventura has no half-cent sales tax earmarked for 
transportation, although officials are trying to place such a proposal on the 
November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
If the county does come up with some extra money, stops could be added in Simi 
Valley and Moorpark, Travis said. Commuter service west of Moorpark is less 
feasible, she said, judging by ridership of the ill-fated Caltrain system of 
the early 1980s, an ambitious commuter system that bogged down in disputes with 
rail carriers and was halted after only a few months. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Ventura is hoping to build a $500,000 train platform at Harbor 
Boulevard and Figueroa Street, next to the county fairgrounds. Even if 
county-subsidized trains were not extended as far as Ventura, Amtrak trains 
would stop there, said Everett Millais, the city's director of community 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Both he and Martin, the Amtrak spokeswoman, said Amtrak plans to add trains 
between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles, although the timetable is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Not so for No. 774 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"From Chatsworth to Glendale will be 16 minutes," Glass, the conductor, assured 
passengers. And it was. The train left Glendale precisely on time at 10 a.m. 
and arrived in Los Angeles a few minutes early. 
</P>
<P>
Whitney, the publishing executive, said it's not always so punctual, but "it's 
as on-time as driving around Los Angeles."

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE

<P>
Tracking Drug Money 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 127 to 283, the House defeated the stricter of two proposals for 
banks to keep records of international wire transfers that could involve drug 
money. The proposal was for a Treasury Department pilot program in which 
selected banks would have had to keep track of customers wiring large sums 
overseas. Left intact by the vote was the softer approach, supported by bank 
lobbyists, of letting Treasury draft regulations to address the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The issue arose during debate on a bill (HR 3848), later sent to the Senate, 
that empowered the government to close institutions convicted of laundering 
drug money. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the pilot program aimed at catching drug 
traffickers.

Jerusalem 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 378 to 34, the House approved a non-binding resolution (HR 290) 
recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and urging that it remain 
unpartitioned with Jews permitted access to its religious sites. The U.S. 
government does not recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and keeps the 
American Embassy in Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Dan Burton (R-Ind.) said the House "shouldn't be afraid to say" that 
Jerusalem is the capital. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent David E. Bonior (D-Mich.) said the resolution "will only polarize the 
situation" in the Middle East, slowing the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes want U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.

Budget Plan 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 305 to 106, the House rejected a blueprint for the government's 
$1.2-trillion fiscal 1991 budget. Popular among Republicans, the measure called 
for higher defense and lower social spending than the Democratic budget plan 
(HR 310) it sought to replace. But it was less generous to defense than 
President Bush's budget. Its main feature was to freeze defense and domestic 
spending other than for entitlement programs at 1990 levels. 
</P>
<P>
The vote occurred as the House worked toward approval of a 1991 congressional 
budget resolution that will guide later action on individual spending bills and 
serve as a bargaining tool in talks with the White House to set fiscal 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the GOP-backed budget plan.

'CHEERS'-STYLE PLACE OFFERS HUGE PORTIONS OF RICH SEAFOOD DISHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN

<TEXT>
<P>
Studio City's Oyster House Saloon and Restaurant is a "Cheers"-style 
neighborhood establishment in a neighborhood where the industry is The 
Industry. 
</P>
<P>
On one hand, the place has a classic East Coast local hangout allure: You could 
transport the whole dark, wood-paneled saloon lock, stock and barrel to 
Hoboken, N.J., or Boston, and within hours a regular clientele would start 
assembling inside. At its present location, however, there are no plant workers 
or truck drivers; instead, writers swap leads at the bar and actors slump into 
seats after a busy day of auditions. 
</P>
<P>
The two big thugs drinking beer at the table next to us still have on eye 
makeup from their afternoon's TV work. And a peppy waitress, between serving 
drinks and taking orders, goes table-to-table among the regulars. "I'm in a 
play," she says, giving them ticket information. 
</P>
<P>
Three televisions broadcast the baseball game. Two bartenders work steadily and 
skillfully behind the 54-foot-long bar. Business is thriving. Dinner customers 
sit on high stools at high tables along the wall. If all the tables are full, 
customers are asked to share their tables, to double up, European-style. 
Service is immediate and enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
"Speak to me," our waitress says. "You'll feel better in just a minute," she 
tells the thugs when she takes their order. "Everything is good here, all of 
it," we're told. 
</P>
<P>
We peruse the menu, which is printed on our place mats, and then an addendum to 
the menu, which is handed out separately. The waitress comes and recites the 
day's many specials. It's a truly remarkable feat of memory. You'd have to be 
an actress to remember all those lines. 
</P>
<P>
Seafood is the order of the day. Most dishes -- from mussels to halibut -- come 
with pasta, and almost all are well-endowed with garlic, cream and/or butter. 
My friend Kate scans my halibut Provencal with angel-hair pasta and her own 
stuffed sand dabs on linguine. "These are not small portions," she announces. 
Indeed, the plates are so generous, the very sight of them fills one with a 
sense of well-being. There's not a chance of leaving this place hungry. A good 
slice of halibut has a butter sauce with fresh chunks of tomato sauce, garlic, 
mushrooms and pine nuts. The sand dabs are breaded, stuffed, sauteed and sauced 
with garlic and broccoli and butter over linguine. Kate, who was an athlete for 
20 years, says, "This is a good place for marathoners; they can eat their 
pre-race carbo meals here." 
</P>
<P>
Being a more sedentary creature, I find the richness of these, and almost all 
of the dishes at the Oyster House, ultimately too extreme. The first bite is 
always good, but after the next few, I feel as if I won't be able to make a 
dent in my food. One is in no danger of leaving the Oyster House hungry, one is 
in danger of leaving cloyed. Kate pushes her sand dabs away before she is 
halfway through. "I don't dare eat another bite," she says. 
</P>
<P>
The cook has a daunting propensity to mix a lot of ingredients together and to 
stuff and sauce with oil and butter and cream. An artichoke appetizer is 
stuffed with bay shrimp, scallops and whitefish in a cream sauce with melted 
jack cheese. The stuffed prawns are stuffed with bread and Larry's secret 
seasoning, with a little bit of shrimp and fish too, in a garlic butter sauce. 
A quesadilla is a grilled, slightly oily flour tortilla containing jack cheese, 
shrimp, bell pepper and onion, topped with salsa. 
</P>
<P>
Even the House Special, a hugely generous portion of tasty black mussels on 
linguine with white sauce, proves to be cream-rich. And the dinner salad, with 
the house vinaigrette, has very little lettuce -- it's all pasta and capers and 
mushroom slices. I'm happy to see plain, naked oysters on the half shell, which 
are small but fresh and good. 
</P>
<P>
The Manhattan-style red clam chowder has a good zesty flavor. The 
bouillabaisse, a melange of seafood, arrives in a basin-sized bowl; without 
exaggeration, it could nourish a family of six. I find the seafood overcooked 
to hardness and the broth surprisingly bland: In a restaurant where garlic 
dominates many dishes, it is most peculiar to find no trace of the stinking 
rose in, or with, this dish, not even in the form of the classic bouillabaisse 
accompaniment, rouille, or garlic sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The Oyster House's dishes themselves -- I'm talking about the crockery, now -- 
are also something of a melange. My last dinner there came on china from other 
restaurants, namely, the China Club and Campanile. 
</P>
<P>
Though I myself couldn't take a steady diet of such rich food, the tables at 
the Oyster House fill up; the bar fills up; the doorway clogs with people 
waiting to be seated. The activity in the kitchen grows feverish -- all the 
meals come off a six-burner stove. Herb, the owner, goes from table to table, 
greeting people. The attractive, sassy waitresses move fast, hauling drinks and 
food, emptying shell plates, soothing tempers, reciting the specials. At one 
end of the bar, a short guy makes time with a tall, curvaceous blonde. At the 
other end, a woman storms up to the bar and takes a seat by herself because her 
boyfriend has been ignoring her for the last 15 minutes. Girlfriends confide in 
each other. Three guys at the bar are laughing very loudly. Nobody's dressed 
up. Everybody's relaxed, sociable, just being themselves, acting out their own 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
Home should be so comfortable. 
</P>

One friend of mine, who doesn't drink anymore, came to the Oyster House with me 
one night for dinner. He kept looking around and smiling. "It's probably a good 
thing I stopped drinking before I found this place," he said. "Otherwise, I'd 
live here."

CONTEMPORARY JAZZ FESTIVAL RETURNS TO VALLEY COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
An excellent chance to sample the broadness of contemporary jazz -- and do so 
at the right price -- presents itself Sunday when a Playboy Jazz Festival 
satellite concert returns to Valley College in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
The free outdoor event drew 5,000 people last year, and this year's strong 
lineup of performers promises to prove equally as popular. 
</P>
<P>
On the triple bill are Richard Elliot, who plays saxophone and Lyricon; the 
group of seasoned session men known as Koinonia; and Michael Paulo, a 
saxophonist who has toured for seven years with Al Jarreau. 
</P>
<P>
The concert starts at 2 p.m. in Monarch Quad and will last about three hours. 
</P>
<P>
Although Playboy is giving the acts equal billing, Elliot is arguably the main 
attraction. He has released four records and toured for the past year playing 
songs from the most recent album, "Take to the Skies," on the Intima label. 
Elliot will be accompanied by his regular four-piece group Sunday and plans to 
perform extensively on the Lyricon, an electronic instrument that resembles a 
clarinet and creates synthesizer sounds that can be shaped like those from a 
horn. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think of myself as just a jazz player," Elliot said. "There are 
definitely elements of jazz in what we do, but there are also elements of R 
&amp; B and elements of Latin. I'd call it contemporary instrumental music as 
opposed to jazz." 
</P>
<P>
Elliot, 30, recently moved to Florida after 27 years in Los Angeles, the last 
six in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"The Playboy concert will be like a homecoming because I grew up playing in Le 
Cafe, the Baked Potato, Donte's and places like that," he said. "I was in Tower 
of Power for five years and we played the Palomino many times." 
</P>
<P>
Paulo, Jarreau's sideman, also is a veteran of the local club scene. The Van 
Nuys resident has one record out ("One Passion" on MCA) and another due in 
September on GRP. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have seven people in the group, including myself," the tenor and alto 
saxophonist said. "We'll do pop, jazz, funk and some Latin jazz." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's appearance by Koinonia (the word is Greek for community) is part of a 
rejuvenation for the group, which is made up of six career session men. The 
10-year-old act boasts three records for Sparrow/MCA, but before recent 
personnel changes had been relatively quiet for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
The band formerly played mostly Latin fusion, but the coming of singer and 
keyboardist Lou Pardini broadened Koinonia's scope, introduced vocals to the 
repertoire and triggered a renewed interest in performing. The group has played 
at At My Place in Santa Monica in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Pardini are Abraham Laboriel on bass, Justo Almario on sax, Bill 
Maxwell on drums, Harlan Rogers on keyboards and Mike Miller on guitar. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's concert is one of 11 free community events leading up to the Playboy 
Jazz Festival June 16-17 at the Hollywood Bowl. Refreshments will be sold at 
the college. Audience members are asked not to bring glass containers or 
alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
Playboy Jazz Concert will begin at 2 p.m. Sunday on the Monarch Quad at Los 
Angeles Valley College, 5800 Fulton Ave., Van Nuys. Admission is free. For 
information call (213) 450-8859.

WORK IS AN ACT OF CHARITY FOR YOUNG FILMMAKING GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Filmmakers Workshop is a recently formed collective of young 
screenwriters, directors and cinematographers. Hollywood has no shortage of men 
and women struggling to work in movie making, but the members of this Van 
Nuys-based group have distinguished themselves by pursuing their careers in a 
way that also helps local charities. 
</P>
<P>
A short time ago, the workshop began offering its services to nonprofit 
organizations that need promotional films and educational videos. The workshop 
is willing to work for almost nothing, so it has been attracting charities with 
small production budgets. 
</P>
<P>
"The charity benefits because they get their film done cheap," said Richard 
Wilson, the workshop's founder. "The members benefit because they get to learn 
by doing. Everybody wins." 
</P>
<P>
In the past 18 months, Wilson and his colleagues have produced a how-to-study 
tape for law students and a public service announcement for a group that 
restores Hollywood landmarks. The workshop is also working on films for a Santa 
Susana conservation association and a group that helps troubled children. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made attempts in the past to get films done," said Jan Hinkston, founder 
of the Santa Susana Mountain Park Assn., who needed a short film about the 
mountains. "We couldn't afford to pay all the personnel that was necessary." 
</P>
<P>
A 30-second public service announcement for a group like Hinkston's will be 
done on a budget of $1,500. A five-minute film goes for $2,500, which is enough 
to cover costs and pay nominal amounts to the director and writer. Wilson and 
his workshop are happy to have the work. 
</P>
<P>
A Connecticut native, Wilson had worked as a stage manager off-Broadway before 
coming to Los Angeles in 1984 to be a limousine driver for a Hollywood 
producer. He has since written four unsold scripts and is attempting to forge a 
directing career. In 1988, he got the idea to gather fellow filmmakers. 
</P>
<P>
In the movie industry, "it's very tough to do something without the help of 
other people," Wilson said. "It helps to find people who are in the same boat." 
</P>
<P>
Now in its second year, the workshop has 53 members. Each pays an annual $25 
fee that goes to printing a monthly newsletter, which includes interviews with 
members and information on possible jobs. The group also publishes a directory 
listing the credits of its members. 
</P>
<P>
Guy Wilson says he was a production assistant on such television shows as "Jake 
&amp; the Fatman." William Olsen's experience includes work on a number of 
feature films. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the spectrum, Lynda Tarryk says she was once Courtney Cox's 
stand-in. Lydia Greenfield, a CSUN student, wants to be a publicist and lists 
her experience planning sorority events. 
</P>
<P>
A few members already have careers in film or television but are looking to 
improve their station from, say, an assistant cameraman to director of 
photography. One member is a special-effects man who wants to direct and write. 
Other members recently graduated with film degrees from USC and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always difficult to find a foothold, a way to break into the business," 
said Robert L. Goodman, 33, who recently graduated with a master's degree from 
USC's film school. "There's a whole cross-section of people in the workshop. 
I've met people and gotten some work through those connections." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson runs the organization from his apartment on Van Nuys Boulevard. He is a 
young-looking man -- who won't tell his age -- dressed in an Oxford shirt with 
an open collar. On the wall of his dining room is a lithograph of Walt Disney, 
one of the workshop's role models. Another is Che Guevara. 
</P>
<P>
"Disney for his sense of humanity," Wilson says. "And Che Guevara because he 
wrote the book on guerrilla warfare. We're guerrilla filmmakers." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Wilson said, former member Edgar Bravo -- who recently landed a job 
directing a $250,000 film on AIDS for the Red Cross -- is the workshop's only 
success story. But the group has begun to attract attention. Warner Hollywood 
Studios recently donated amplifiers and film rewinders to the workshop, and is 
allowing members to film on the lot. 
</P>
<P>
"Our studio has always been a big supporter of being a good citizen," said Bob 
Heiber, technical operations manager at the studio. "You have to give a lot of 
respect and kudos to the filmmakers' workshop for helping different charity 
organizations." 
</P>
<P>
Respect and donations are exactly what Wilson envisioned when he started the 
charity project. But he insists workshop members are interested in more than 
personal aggrandizement. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody can go out and make a slasher movie," Wilson said. "We want to go out 
and make films of value to the community."

Angry Mills College students blockaded buildings today during a raucous 
demonstration that drove the school's president from her campus home, one day 
after trustees voted to admit men at the exclusive women's institution. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred students took part in the blockade, surrounding major buildings 
at Mills College, including the administration building and the school 
president's home. 
</P>
<P>
Some parked their cars in front of campus buildings, honking horns and setting 
off car alarms in a bid to disrupt classes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to shut down the operation of the college until they reverse 
their decision," said Esther Barragan, a senior economics major. "We're not 
going to take this lightly." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Metz, the school's president, was chased from her home about 9 a.m. The 
students, with radios at full blast, were shouting, "We will not accept this!"

KENT STATE DEDICATES ANTI-WAR MEMORIAL

<P>
About 4,000 people gathered in the rain today at Kent State University to hear 
calls for reconciliation at the dedication of a memorial to four students 
killed and nine wounded in an anti-war protest 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We do appreciate what has been done and who did it," said Florence Schroeder, 
mother of Bill Schroeder, one of the four students killed by Ohio National 
Guardsmen on May 4, 1970. 
</P>
<P>
She said she is convinced that the death of her son and three other students 
helped shorten the Vietnam War by increasing public opposition to American 
involvement in it. 
</P>
<P>
"He absolutely did not die in vain," Schroeder's mother said at a news 
conference before the midday dedication. 
</P>
<P>
The $100,000 granite memorial is the most ambitious attempt by the university 
to commemorate the dead and wounded. But student activists who wanted a larger 
memorial built and more student involvement in its planning waged a silent 
protest march during the dedication. 
</P>
<P>
The approximately 200 students stood near the white tent, where ceremony 
participants spoke. Some of the students held up their arms, fists clenched or 
displaying the peace sign, and many others held up handmade signs reading 
"Whose May 4th Is It Anyway?" and "Don't Minimize Student Death." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday evening, about 2,000 people attended a candlelight ceremony to mark 
the deaths of Schroeder, Jeffrey Miller, Sandy Scheuer and Allison Krause. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Richard F. Celeste said the 1970 shootings should serve as a source of 
learning rather than as a focus of bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
"To those who suffered from that tragedy 20 years ago, I am sorry," Celeste 
said. "It's time to turn the tragedy at Kent State of May 4, 1970, into a 
calling to peacemakers." 
</P>
<P>
Former Sen. George S. McGovern, keynote speaker at the dedication, called the 
shootings "the most tragic episode in American foreign policy history." 
</P>
<P>
McGovern called for U.S. reconciliation with Vietnam and the re-establishment 
of diplomatic ties. 
</P>
<P>
"The war in Vietnam is unfinished," he said. "The killing has stopped but the 
arrogance that produced it survives and so does the agony, the guilt and the 
separation." 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the shootings were marked only by a gravestone-size slab erected in 
1971.

BUSH ASKS 'NEW STRATEGY' FOR 'NEW, CHANGING TIMES'

<P>
President Bush, calling for "a new Western strategy for new and changing 
times," said today that he hopes an agreement on reducing troops and 
conventional arms in Europe can be signed this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Once such an agreement is reached, U.S.-Soviet talks should begin as soon as 
possible, aimed at reducing the number of short-range nuclear weapons stationed 
throughout Europe, Bush said in a commencement address at Oklahoma State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
On changes taking place within the Soviet Union, Bush said: "President (Mikhail 
S.) Gorbachev has made profound progress in his country, reforms so fundamental 
that the clock cannot be turned back." 
</P>
<P>
But, Bush added, "neither can we turn the clock ahead, to know for sure what 
kind of country the Soviet Union will be in years to come." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that the Western alliance must plan for a less militarized Europe 
that plays down the current focus on imminent war. 
</P>
<P>
"We are entering a new age of freedom in a time of uncertainty, but great 
hope," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Looking forward to the NATO meeting he proposed for early this summer, Bush 
said: "The alliance must join together to craft a new Western strategy for new 
and changing times." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. role, he said, will be to support Europe militarily as long as the 
allies want. However, in light of democratic changes sweeping Eastern Europe, 
the political focus of NATO will increase and the military aspects will be 
different, Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Soviet withdrawal continues and our arms-control efforts are 
successful, we must plan for a different kind of military presence focused less 
on the danger of an immediate outbreak of war," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He made the comments a day after announcing he is scrapping plans for upgrading 
battlefield nuclear weapons that are stationed mostly in West Germany. Bush 
said he wants NATO members to develop objectives for new arms control talks on 
U.S. and Soviet reductions of other short-range missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who in the past has only said that an agreement on reducing conventional 
forces in Europe should be completed by the 35 nations with an interest in 
Europe by the end of this year, today said he hopes it can be signed "this 
fall." 
</P>
<P>
"Our enemy today is uncertainty and instability," Bush said in stating a 
continued need for NATO's military role.

ISRAELI SHOTS AT KING HUSSEIN'S YACHT TOLD;

MONARCH ON DECK AS NAVY BOAT OPENS FIRE, NEWSPAPER SAYS

An Israeli navy boat fired at the yacht of Jordan's King Hussein as the monarch 
was standing on deck, an Israeli newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
A military spokesman confirmed that a navy vessel was carrying out a "routine 
weapons check" in the vicinity of Hussein's yacht, but said no shots were fired 
directly at it. Spokesmen for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and the Defense 
Ministry could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The liberal daily Haaretz said the incident occurred last Saturday in the Gulf 
of Aqaba. There were no reports of damage or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan protested sharply to Israel and the United States. Israeli officials 
refused to apologize but assured Jordan that it will not happen again, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III expressed anger when 
informed about the incident, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
Haaretz said Hussein's yacht was sailing in international waters, accompanied 
by a Jordanian navy vessel, when the Israeli patrol boat opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody could have had any doubt that the king was on the boat," the newspaper 
quoted one of the sources as saying. "He was standing on the deck, and it was 
possible to identify him easily." 
</P>
<P>
After the first shots were fired, the king took over command of the yacht and 
ordered the vessel to turn around and head toward Saudi Arabian waters, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli vessel accelerated and continued to fire as it followed the king's 
yacht. Only when the royal yacht reached Saudi waters did the Israeli patrol 
boat hold its fire, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
It said neither the king's bodyguards nor the Jordanian navy vessel 
accompanying the yacht returned fire during the chase. 
</P>
<P>
Israel's military command released a statement today denying the report and 
said "no shots were fired by the Israeli navy at King Hussein's yacht and no 
chase was conducted." 
</P>
<P>
The statement said a naval vessel did conduct routine firing of a few bullets 
in order to check its guns, but they were aimed toward empty waters to the 
south.

A killer who described himself and his girlfriend as a "modern-day Bonnie and 
Clyde" was executed in Florida's electric chair today for shooting two officers 
14 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Jessie Joseph Tafero was electrocuted at 7:13 a.m. at Florida State Prison, 
eight hours after the U.S. Supreme Court denied a stay of execution, exhausting 
his last appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The executioner interrupted the standard two-minute, 2,000-volt electrical 
cycle because of the smoke and flames when a wet sponge on Tafero's head caught 
fire, said state Corrections Department spokesman Bob Macmaster. But he said 
the prison's chief medical officer, Dr. Frank Kilgo, believed Tafero died 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
The killings occurred Feb. 20, 1976, when a state trooper and a visiting 
Canadian constable checked on a car parked on the highway where Tafero, his 
girlfriend Sonja Jacobs, her two children and traveling companion Walter Rhodes 
Jr., were sleeping. Trooper Phillip Black died of gunshot wounds to the head 
and neck, while Constable Donald Irwin of Kitchener, Ontario, received fatal 
wounds in the right eye and shoulder.

A passenger train derailed and plunged into a dry riverbed in the southern 
state of Oaxaca, killing at least six people, the Mexican Red Cross said today. 
</P>
<P>
The organization originally gave a death toll from Thursday night's crash of at

Employers and striking metal workers in a central region of West Germany agreed 
in a landmark accord today to cut the workweek by two hours in stages to 35 
hours, averting the prospect of a potentially damaging nationwide strike. 
</P>
<P>
IG Metall, the Western World's biggest union, said in a statement that its 
members in the steel, car and engineering industries in Northern 
Wuerttemberg-Northern Baden will work a 35-hour week from October, 1995, on. 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government had said the country cannot afford a 
shorter workweek at a time when it needs to finance the costs of German 
unification. 
</P>
<P>
The reduction in the current 37-hour week will come in two steps with a 
one-hour cut being introduced from April, 1993. Wages of workers covered by the 
agreement will be raised 6% from July this year, IG Metall said.

Residents of the Connecticut suburbs of New York City had a per capita personal 
income in 1988 nearly four times higher than those of a South Texas 
metropolitan area at the bottom of a new government list. 
</P>
<P>
The Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk-Danbury, Conn., area retained its top ranking 
with per capita personal income of $29,084, compared with $7,302 for the 
McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, Tex., area, the Commerce Department said. 
</P>
<P>
The Connecticut suburbs also were at the top of the 1987 list of 319 
metropolitan areas surveyed by the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis. 
McAllen-Edinburg-Mission was last in 1987, too. 
</P>
<P>
For the nation as a whole, per capita income in 1988 was $16,490, up from 
$15,484 a year earlier. Per capita personal income is the annual total personal 
income of residents divided by the area population. 
</P>
<P>
New York City was the richest metropolitan area in terms of total personal 
income with $174.74 billion in 1988, the study found. Enid, Okla., was at the 
other end with a total personal income of $873 million. 
</P>
<P>
Following New York at the top of the total personal income list were Los 
Angeles-Long Beach, $161.37 billion; Chicago, $118.48 billion; 
Philadelphia-N.J., $91.05 billion; Washington-Md.-Va., $86.54 billion; 
Boston-Lawrence-Salem-Lowell-Brockton, Mass., $83.11 billion; Detroit, $80.75 
billion; Nassau-Suffolk, N.Y., $63.16 billion; Houston, $52.58 billion, and 
Anaheim-Santa Ana, $51.35 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Newark, N.J., which ranked 12th in 1983, rose to ninth in 1988 with per capita 
personal income of $22,963. Anchorage, Alaska, dropped from first to 17th with 
per capita income of $21,840. 
</P>
<P>
Following the Connecticut suburbs of New York City were San Francisco, $26,309; 
Bergen-Passaic, N.J., $25,388; Middlesex-Somerset-Hunterdon, N.J., $25,140; 
Lake County, Ill., $24,009; Nassau-Suffolk, N.Y., $23,832; San Jose, Calif., 
$23,181; Washington-Md.-Va., $23,175; and Newark, N.J., and West Palm 
Beach-Boca Raton-Delray Beach, Fla., both with $22,824.

State gaming regulators announced a routine audit of Donald Trump's financial 
empire at the same time that Trump's newest gambling hall disclosed plans to 
have an independent auditor examine the bills of contractors angry about not 
getting paid. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey Gaming Enforcement Director Anthony Parrillo said that such a review 
by his agency is normal and that it hasn't looked at Trump's operations for a 
long time. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't to sound or signal that there are problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 contractors involved in the $1-billion Taj Mahal Casino Resort have 
gone to the state Casino Control Commission in search of a means to force 
payment from Trump. Trump officials announced the audit Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The group contends that it is owed about $35 million. The contractors are angry 
because they pushed to meet the casino's April 2 opening date based on promises 
that they would be paid in full.

Outgoing savings and loan bailout chief L. William Seidman, showered with 
congressional praise today, cautioned legislators not to expect miracles from 
his successor. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't be impatient. 
</P>
<P>
This is a long hard job. It isn't going to be accomplished any time soon," 
Seidman told a House Banking task force on the S&amp;L bailout. 
</P>
<P>
"The real pain of what is taking place, on everything from increased government 
borrowing to the effect on real estate markets, is still being felt. I think it 
is very important that no one expect by this time next year we'll all feel 
great," he said. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush is turning to William Taylor, the Federal Reserve Board's 
director of bank supervision, to take over from Seidman, who recommended that 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
If nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, Taylor will become 
chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Resolution Trust Corp. 
The FDIC insures bank and thrift institution deposits, while the RTC conducts 
the S&amp;L cleanup.

Carre Otis, co-star of the steamy new film "Wild Orchid," is suing the movie's 
producers, alleging that they gave Playboy magazine nude photographs of her 
without her consent. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, states that the contract Otis 
signed with Kruger-Brent Group in April, 1989, stipulated that the actress 
"shall have approval over still photographs for the pictures in which artist 
appears nude or partially nude." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Kruger-Brent, the suit names as defendants Brazil Star Films; Vision 
P.D.G., which guaranteed the contract between Kruger-Brent and Otis; and Vision 
International, the firms' parent company. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't seen the suit, so we can't make any comment," Vision Chairman Mark 
Damon said today. 
</P>
<P>
Filed Thursday, the suit says photographs of nude scenes in the movie appear in 
June's Playboy and appeared in the April edition of the German magazine Kino.

Falling scenery, curtains that won't go up and revolving stages that refuse to 
turn have caused a series of mishaps in London theaters in the last 10 days, 
prompting a safety investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The latest incident occurred Thursday night at a gala opening at the Royalty 
Theater of "A Clockwork Orange." 
</P>
<P>
The curtain refused to go up for the second half of the Royal Shakespeare 
Company production. 
</P>
<P>
The star-studded audience downed free drinks offered by the embarrassed 
management as stage staff struggled for 15 minutes before getting the curtain 
to go up. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Stephen Sondheim musical "Sunday in the Park with George" at the 
Lyttelton Theater was halted in mid-performance when a wooden tree, part of the 
scenery, fell from a hook as it was being carried off the stage, narrowly 
missing an actor. 
</P>
<P>
On April 24, a hydraulic jack at the Olivier Theater broke down, preventing the 
revolving stage from turning. The play "The School for Scandal" was canceled in 
mid-performance.

Before Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost policy thawed Soviet relationswith the 
West, the idea of Americans and Russians working and dancing together in the 
world's most beloved ballet would have been a fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
The dream came true Thursday as the curtain rose on a stunning and lavish 
collaborative version of "Swan Lake," staged by the Boston Ballet with help 
from Moscow's Bolshoi Ballet and Leningrad's Kirov Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the 18 performances, winding up May 20, will pair an American and a 
Soviet dancer in the lead roles, which have seven different casting 
combinations. 
</P>
<P>
The spotlight Thursday was on Nina Ananiashvili, stunning young prima ballerina 
from the Bolshoi, in the white swan-black swan dual lead role, and Boston's 
international star Fernando Bujones as the swan queen's princely lover, 
Siegfried. 
</P>
<P>
The audience rose up with a 10-minute cheering ovation after the stunning world 
premiere of this version. 
</P>
<P>
During a rehearsal earlier in the week, Ananiashvili said the Soviet-American 
collaborative aspect of the production was very exciting for her. 
</P>
<P>
"Never has an American company shown such respect to this ballet," she said in 
a conversation translated by her husband, Gregory Vashadze. 
</P>
<P>
Ananiashvili said she relishes her new-found freedom to dance anywhere in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"Such freedom is essential to our profession," she said. 
</P>
<P>
It cost $640,000 to stage the production, which will tour the Soviet Union in 
the spring of 1992 under sponsorship of Sheraton Hotels.

Peggy Lipton (you remember -- "the blonde" on "Mod Squad") quit show biz 17 
years ago to be a wife and mom. Now this displaced homemaker is on the comeback 
trail, starring in "Twin Peaks." 
</P>
<P>
"It was great, but I was scared," Lipton, 42, said of her return to work. "It's 
true for any woman because your sense of yourself has changed so much. 
</P>
<P>
"My whole energy has changed. But you have a great advantage: You know yourself 
better. I had no idea who I was at that age. None," Lipton said in this week's 
issue of USA Weekend. 
</P>
<P>
When "Mod Squad" went off the air, Lipton ditched her bell-bottoms to marry 
producer Quincy Jones and raise their daughters, Rashida, now 14, and Kidada, 
16. The couple split up in 1986, but they're still close, Lipton said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Lipton plays a diner owner on "Twin Peaks," an avant-garde television 
series by director David Lynch. 
</P>

"I love working and I get upset now when I don't do enough," she said. "But it 
was a conscious choice to be a wife and mother. Right now I don't have any 
mother-work conflicts because I stayed home with my kids and I wouldn't trade 
that experience for being the biggest star."

The Star's report came one day after the school acknowledged that it had 
received an official letter of inquiry stating a number of charges against the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri must formulate a response to all charges and present that response to 
the NCAA Committee on Infractions, probably in August. The committee then 
determines whether penalties are warranted. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the NCAA has been harsh when it has found that a recruiting action 
gave a school a "competitive advantage." The Missouri roster has been full of 
Detroit-area players in recent years, including Nathan Buntin, Doug Smith, Lee 
Coward, John McIntyre and Lynn Hardy, all of whom have been starters. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri Athletic Director Dick Tamburo said Thursday he was relieved to 
finally receive the letter. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pleased to get it just from the standpoint of getting the response 
prepared for it and getting our program moving forward. We're in the process of 
evaluating it right now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The university scheduled a news conference for Monday afternoon to distribute 
the letter. 
</P>
<P>
The basketball program has been under investigation since February, 1989, the 
month when Coach Norm Stewart collapsed on the team plane and later underwent 
cancer surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart recovered from his cancer surgery and led Missouri to a Big Eight 
championship this year. Missouri lost in the first-round of the NCAA tournament 
to Northern Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA investigation focused on recruiting violations, including assistant 
coach Bob Sundvold buying airline tickets for recruits. 
</P>
<P>
Sundvold was suspended in February, 1989.

Boxer Mike Tyson became a father this week when a baby boy was born to his 
24-year-old girlfriend at a hospital in the Catskills, the New York Post said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy to be having a family," Tyson told the Post. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the child, as yet unnamed, was born Wednesday to Natalie 
Fears of Los Angeles. The name of the hospital was not given. 
</P>
<P>
The report also said Tyson has no plans to marry Fears but will buy a house in 
Los Angeles and support the child. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson brought Fears from Los Angeles to the Catskills several months ago, and 
she has been staying with the woman who helped rear Tyson, Camille Ewald. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson has not seen his son yet because he's training for a June 16 fight with 
Henry Tillman in Las Vegas, the newspaper said, quoting unidentified sources. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said a Los Angeles dancer, Trena Archie, 22, said in February 
that Tyson is the father of her infant son. Tyson has not acknowledged 
paternity in that case, the Post said.

DERBY HANDICAPPERS ARE VERY IMPRESSED BUT NOT CONVINCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
From horseman to analyst to grandstand fan, the handicapping theme for the 
116th Kentucky Derby, featuring co-favorites Summer Squall and Mister Frisky, 
seems to be: very impressed, not totally convinced. 
</P>
<P>
The road that led here has been fraught with confusion from the outset of the 
1990 season. Twenty-three horses won the 32 significant prep races run this 
winter and spring; 10 of them will answer the starter's call Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Some are peaking. Some have peaked. Some are heading in the wrong direction, 
and some just don't belong. But it's that way every year. The following is an 
assessment of the Derby field, listed in post-position order: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- Dr. Bobby A. Trainer Steve DiMauro said this week that this race looks 
like a tough spot for his horse. An honest, hard-working horseman, DiMauro has 
a very good opinion. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- Killer Diller. Heartened by his victory in the Grade III Garden State 
Stakes and his improvement in longer races this spring, the connections of this 
Pleasant Colony colt are taking a shot. A very, very long shot. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- Pendleton Ridge. Well-meant and winless when he accompanied stablemate 
Burnt Hills to New York this spring, he arrived here still a maiden. He has not 
trained well at Churchill Downs following his driving fourth-place finish in 
the Wood Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
4 -- Video Ranger. Some are encouraged by the fact that he closed ground for 
place behind Mister Frisky in the speed-biased Santa Anita Derby. Usually, 
that's a good tack, but not here. 
</P>
<P>
5 -- Mister Frisky. Freak or fraud, that is the question. Hall of Fame trainer 
Laz Barrera is 2 for 4 in this race and seldom fires big-race blanks. Jockey 
Gary Stevens jumped off Silver Ending, committing early to "the 
longest-striding horse" he has ever ridden. But will the colt's 13 victories in 
Puerto Rico mean anything Saturday? Did his three bias-enhanced victories at 
Santa Anita prepare him for the grueling challenge, in which he will be tested 
early, often and longer than ever before? 
</P>
<P>
6 -- Real Cash. He placed gamely behind Silver Ending in the Arkansas Derby, 
showing marked improvement over his fainthearted Santa Anita Derby try. But he 
is best with an early lead, which will be difficult, if not impossible, for him 
to secure. 
</P>
<P>
7 -- Fighting Fantasy. The probable pacesetter, he was beaten 40 lengths by 
Summer Squall in their two meetings. He has no chance to win but will take some 
speedy contenders with him and help set up for the late runners. 
</P>
<P>
8 -- Country Day. A long shot with a chance, this wide-racing stretch runner 
benefits from what figures to be a hotly contested pace, the added distance and 
a jockey switch to Jose Santos. Still, he will need a career effort to win. 
</P>
<P>
9 -- Unbridled. This year's training star should have won Gulfstream's Fountain 
of Youth, then rebounded to win the slowly run Florida Derby. A useful third in 
the wet-track Blue Grass -- from which trainer Carl Nafzger considered 
scratching -- he made the kind of effort reminiscent of Genuine Risk when she 
finished third in the Wood as a prelude to her 1980 Derby victory. He is 
peaking beautifully. 
</P>
<P>
10 -- Pleasant Tap. In the clever hands of Chris Speckert, this son of Derby 
winner Pleasant Colony was an excellent second in Keeneland's Lexington Stakes 
and is another expected to benefit from a lively pace. Forced to alter his prep 
schedule due to virus, the question is whether he has had enough conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
11 -- Silver Ending. The "now" horse. Making his third start this year, his 
Arkansas Derby victory two weeks ago was a career best and one of the better 
prep efforts this season. Prepared masterfully by Hall of Famer Ron McAnally, 
Silver Ending has the type of explosive mid-race move that has won many 
Derbies. Like the other late runners, however, he will need a good trip. 
</P>
<P>
12 -- Thirty Six Red. No 3-year-old, including Saturday's co-favorites, has 
shown his kind of courage. But his gut-wrenching victories in New York's Gotham 
Mile and Wood Memorial do not figure to help him Saturday, especially since he 
will have to force the pace from his outer position. 
</P>
<P>
13 -- Burnt Hills. Another who had his prep season altered by illness, he 
bounced back from a disappointing third in the Gotham with a game second in the 
Wood. But he seems to need the lead in races around two turns, and Saturday's 
route seems a furlong too far. 
</P>
<P>
14 -- Summer Squall. No one has ever questioned this colt's ability. But class 
is not the issue here; scheduling and regimen are. Forced to delay his 1990 
debut when he bled following an early-season workout, trainer Neil Howard has 
been forced to play catch-up. After a game debut behind the rapid sprinter 
Housebuster, Summer Squall won the Jim Beam and Blue Grass with style. But that 
schedule seems to have taken its toll. He has lost some weight recently and on 
Wednesday failed to gallop out strongly following a short workout. The Derby 
will be his fourth race in 49 days, and his outside position won't make his 
pace-stalking trip any easier. It's a lot to ask, even of "the best horse." 
</P>
<P>
15 -- Land Rush. With more Derby experience than any trainer in history, D. 
Wayne Lukas might finally be right on schedule. Given one month between the San 
Felipe and the Blue Grass and three weeks between the Blue Grass and Derby, 
Land Rush figures to run his best race. In finishing second to Summer Squall in 
Lexington, Angel Cordero was forced to attack the easy-leading winner 
prematurely or suffer certain defeat. When Pat Day set the leader down in 
earnest, he sprinted away. Land Rush held his ground despite racing on the same 
left-fore lead, failing to switch over and gain new momentum because he was 
unsure over the wet footing. And if Unbridled has been the training star this 
week, then Land Rush was a close second. His outside position is not as 
detrimental as it looks. 
</P>
<P>
16 -- Power Lunch. Even the highly positive Lukas admitted he was considering 
entering this colt in an allowance race on Saturday's card. 
</P>
<P>
This handicapper's nightmare is a racing fan's dream: 1. Land Rush 2. Unbridled 
3. Silver Ending 4. Mister Frisky.

SPITZ CHASING GLORY AND GOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK MILLER, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You remember Mark Spitz. He won seven gold medals for swimming in the 1972 
Munich Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
After that he did a TV special with Bob Hope and a few commercials, then 
married and retired from public life. Now he's back -- not on TV (except for 
interviews) but in the water. Spitz, 40, hopes to make the 1992 U.S. Olympic 
team and compete in the 100-meter butterfly event in Barcelona, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Before his recent comeback attempt, Mark Spitz had become what every top 
athlete inevitably becomes: a has-been. 
</P>
<P>
If glory gained through sports is the most intense, the most euphoric kind of 
glory, it is also the most fleeting, the most transient. The buzzer sounds, the 
run scores, you bask in your 15 minutes of Andy Warhol celebrity, and then it's 
all over, like the sweet prime of youth itself. 
</P>
<P>
A has-been might be better than a never-was, but nothing compares with being on 
top, particularly once you've been there, however brief the stay. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Mark Spitz. Or Frank Gifford, who years ago came out of retirement 
just to play one more season of professional football. 
</P>
<P>
Or Muhammad Ali, who stepped into the ring with Larry Holmes long since he had 
become The Greatest. Or Mickey Mantle, his knees a mess of pulled ligaments and 
torn cartilage when he finally called it quits in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Or weight-lifter Norbert Schemansky, who 25 years ago at age 41 pushed himself 
through painful, grueling workouts in preparation for what would have been his 
fifth Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Now approaching 41 myself, I can relate to Schemansky's ordeal, his frustration 
with being unable to coax his tired body into performing the way it once did, 
his constant battle with injuries that in middle-age multiply faster and take 
longer to heal. 
</P>
<P>
While I never competed on his lofty level, I did manage to win five South 
Atlantic weightlifting championships, a gold medal in the 1973 Maccabiah Games 
in Israel and four Maryland State bench press championships, the last being in 
1978. On a purely physical level, those were the best years of my life, a time 
when I could bench press 400 pounds, clean and jerk 350 and squat 500 just 
about any time I wanted. 
</P>
<P>
It was a time when my body and the will to compete worked in tandem. Indeed, 
when the latter called for weight to be lifted, the former asked, how much? 
</P>
<P>
Now, though, my body is no longer so compliant. Instead of asking how much, 
it's, are you sure? A reticence born from nagging soreness (elbows, knees, 
hips) and the fear that "maxing out" will result in something more devastating, 
like a torn muscle or tendon, injuries common among aging lifters.

THE GOAL IS THE SAME; THE GOALIES DIFFERENT; 
</P>
<P>
SOCKERS: THEY BOTH GET THE JOB DONE BUT ZOLTAN TOTH AND VICTOR NOGUEIRA TRAVEL 
DIFFERENT ROADS EN ROUTE TO WORK. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The end result is quite the same, the preparation very different. 
</P>
<P>
It is best to leave Zoltan Toth alone with his thoughts in the hour before a 
Sockers game, but Victor Nogueira doesn't mind chatting and sharing a joke with 
his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Toth was the MISL's goalie of the year. Last year, when Toth 
missed more than half the season following foot surgery, Nogueira stepped in, 
won the award and was selected MVP of the championship series. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Toth returned in style to finish with a 3.48 goals-against 
average, second in the MISL behind Dallas' Joe Papaleo (3.34 GAA). Nogueira was 
fifth at 3.61. 
</P>
<P>
The similarities between Toth, 34, and Nogueira, 30, pretty much end with 
statistics. During a game, Toth looks to be having about as much fun as a guy 
getting a cavity filled. For Nogueira, it all appears to be a picnic in the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
"A game is a game," says Nogueira, a seven-year veteran from Maputo, 
Mozambique. "I'm not going to get hypertension because of a game. You're not 
nervous when you play, or else you're in trouble. So what's the point of 
getting nervous before? It's just not logical." 
</P>
<P>
But logic can sometimes take a back seat to habit if habit has a history of 
working. And it's hard to argue with results. 
</P>
<P>
Toth, originally from Budapest, Hungary, has played 10 indoor seasons and won 
six championships, four with the Sockers and two with the New York Arrows. In 
this best-of-five semifinal series with St. Louis, which the Sockers lead, 2-1, 
he has approached perfection, winning both of his starts and allowing a total 
of three goals. The series resumes at 5:05 PDT Saturday night at the St. Louis 
Arena, but Socker Coach Ron Newman has yet to announce who will start in goal. 
</P>
<P>
Concentration is Toth's trademark. 
</P>
<P>
So what if he has a funny look on his face during a game? 
</P>
<P>
"I look at the pictures," Toth says. "I have a face like a fish, or something. 
It shows on me. Victor doesn't show it." 
</P>
<P>
Toth shows it from the moment he arrives at the arena. He shuffles off to a 
room by himself and reflects on what he has to do. 
</P>
<P>
All the while, his teammates might have a snicker or two at his expense, but 
they know better than to give him any guff on a day he is to start. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't laugh in front of him," midfielder Waad Hirmez says, "but inside I'm 
thinking, 'How many games do you have to play in this league to relax before a 
game?' " 
</P>
<P>
Toth, in turn, sometimes thinks his teammates should concentrate more. How many 
games do the Sockers have to lose before they become a little more serious? 
</P>
<P>
"They say I have nerves," Toth says. "I say we're missing fire sometimes. When 
you play any sport, if you don't get that fire, then you're not on top. To get 
that is very hard. You have to think about it." 
</P>
<P>
So when there is a practical joke to be played, the Sockers make sure it isn't 
directed at Toth on the day of a start. 
</P>
<P>
A few years back, Hirmez and former Socker Cha Cha Namdar got their hands on a 
key to the room shared by Toth and Jim Gorsek, a goalie for the Sockers from 
1981-88. Hirmez and Namdar smeared Vaseline on everything from door knobs to 
pillows. Toth and Gorsek returned to a mess. 
</P>
<P>
"We did it because we knew Zollie wasn't playing the next night," Hirmez said. 
"We knew Jimmy could take it a little bit more than Zollie." 
</P>
<P>
On non-game days, Toth can dish it out, too. He enjoys the pranks as much as 
the next guy. Just ask Hirmez, who awoke on a plane one time to find a slice of 
pizza stuffed in each of his shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"He's like a little kid," Hirmez says. 
</P>
<P>
And someone who gets as wound up as Toth has to let off steam once in a while. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a way of releasing the other side of him," Newman says. "He's so 
intense in a game, you don't touch him. When that's over, there is a release." 
</P>
<P>
There is an unwritten code among the defenders with regard to dealing with the 
goalies. They've learned what to say to Nogueira and what not to say to Toth. 
If Nogueira kicks the ball over the glass, defender Kevin Crow might needle 
him. Nogueira will smirk. 
</P>
<P>
In the same situation with Toth, Crow keeps his mouth shut. Make a snide remark 
to him and he might shoot back with: "Well, why didn't you keep him from 
shooting?" 
</P>
<P>
Toth is coming off an off-season of uncertainty, wondering if maybe his career 
might be over. The muscles in his left leg had shrunk drastically. He had to 
learn his limits gradually. With a wrong step too soon, he could lose another 
season and, possibly, his career. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course I was worried," Toth says. "I had to learn everything again." 
</P>
<P>
But by the time the season rolled around, it began to come back. He hadn't lost 
his anticipation, his quick reflexes or his ability to smother the ball at the 
goal mouth. And best of all, when he planted and turned on his left foot, there 
was no pain. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so happy now," he says. "I feel great. My foot feels great." 
</P>
<P>
The toughest part for Toth is not looking back on the pain, the doubts or the 
hours of rehabilitation. It is realizing that because he has made such a grand 
return, he has taken a slice of playing time from Nogueira, who has started 
just two of the past eight games. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the challenge," Toth says, "but it's partly sad for me to see, because 
then Victor doesn't play. He loses the time and the experience." 
</P>
<P>
By all rights, Nogueira is having a fine season, but he is playing in his own 
shadow. Last season, he set an MISL record with a 2.86 GAA. At one point, he 
started 23 of 24 games. 
</P>
<P>
This season, he started off slowly and wound up changing his blocking style 
midway through, imitating Papaleo. His play has since been good, but good can 
be disappointing when people expect excellence. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe everybody else thinks about last season's awards a lot more than 
Nogueira. His wife, Pamela, will sometimes tell him that he should take more 
pride in his individual accomplishments, but he doesn't really got too excited 
about plaques and trophies with his name on it. 
</P>
<P>
"Who cares?," says Nogueira, cracking a smile. "In soccer, who does care?" 
</P>
<P>
What he cares about is winning another championship. For that reason, he 
doesn't mind waiting longer between starts while Toth does his thing. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to win as much as possible," he says. "At some point, they're 
going to need me, and they'll depend on me. So that's fine. My approach is the 
team approach." 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, things can change in a snap. Toth would be the first to admit that 
there is a lot of luck involved in this game. You are lucky if you don't get 
injured. You are sometimes lucky to make a save. 
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's 4-1 victory over St. Louis in Game 3, the ball bounced nicely for 
Toth. He played well, but he recalls one close-range Storm shot where he didn't 
even see the ball and it bounced off his knee. That counts the same as the 
spectacular diving saves. 
</P>
<P>
"But don't even tell me I made that save," he says. "It hit me. The luck factor 
was there." 
</P>
<P>
With all the uncertainties of this season, in which the Sockers are still a 
game below .500 (27-28), a little luck is welcomed whith open arms.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DROUGHT FORCES MORE CONSERVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your excellent editorial concerning the water shortage stated, "If Only All of 
Us Would . . . " The two key words were "if all." Unfortunately, voluntarily 
reducing water use is not enough, because many people either are uninformed 
about Southern California's water crisis, or they are indifferent. 
</P>
<P>
Driveways and sidewalks are still being hosed down (usually by gardeners), even 
though this is illegal. New lawns are being planted. Sprinklers at parks, along 
roadways, freeways and at commercial buildings are usually on timers, and some 
turn on every night. Big corporations still water acres of lawns every night, 
with the excess water draining into the gutters. 
</P>
<P>
We need city/county rationing that is strictly enforced, and we need it 
immediately, not at the end of the summer. Are we going to wait until the water 
is nearly gone, like Santa Barbara did, and then be forced to take drastic 
action? Where is a leader, when we so desperately need one?

<P>
TRICK FOR MANDELA, DE KLERK TO ACCOMMODATE MAIN MINORITY AS WELL AS NEW 
MAJORITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the extraordinary closed-door talks between the government of South Africa 
and the nation's black leaders that began Wednesday are to triumph in epochal 
reconciliation, both sides will need to demonstrate unaccustomed civility and 
elasticity. 
</P>
<P>
How can the 71-year-old Nelson Mandela -- after 27 years in jail -- convert an 
African National Congress that employed terrorism to advance its just 
anti-apartheid crusade into a supple and skilled negotiating instrument? How 
can Frederik W. de Klerk -- the South African president who fears the 
unleashing of raw emotions and deep forces if the talks fail -- keep the 
political right at bay while he steers his unbeloved, heretofore racist 
government toward true power-sharing? 
</P>
<P>
Based on South Africa's track record, no one should want to bet the house that 
any good will come of all this. The odds favor failure. 
</P>
<P>
But bet the long-shot anyway, for both De Klerk and Mandela already have gone 
too great a distance to want to retreat in failure; and both are now showing 
strong and steady leadership at the very time that it is most needed. On 
Wednesday De Klerk termed the process "irreversible." Mandela, sometimes 
speaking in the white Afrikaans language, pointedly praised the president's 
language. 
</P>
<P>
Precisely that sense of having come to a new chapter in history will be 
required to overcome minority whites' fears of retaliatory repression at the 
hands of the black majority in any wholly one-person, one-vote system. It will 
be needed also to allay black fears that negotiations will produce a rigged 
system where black votes count for less than white ones. 
</P>
<P>
A relationship of trust -- and political imagination -- between Mandela and De 
Klerk will be crucial to success. So will agreement by both sides to negotiate 
a structure that offers the hope of producing a truly stable multiracial 
society. Such a prospect will be advanced if the negotiations look to forge a 
sophisticated system -- perhaps even bicameral -- rather than a crude one. That 
might well mean a powerful lower house (one-person/one-vote) and a less 
powerful, but nonetheless important, upper house. That kind of approach could 
give all fearful minorities, including whites, enough political clout to feel 
confident about their future in a country suddenly -- though quite properly -- 
ruled by the majority. 
</P>
<P>
Radicals on both sides -- to the ANC's left and to De Klerk's right -- bitterly 
oppose such a compromise. That fact alone commands this formula to serious 
consideration.

DEVELOPING A THIRST FOR BETTER PLANNING; 
</P>
<P>
THE WATER SHORTAGE SHOWS WHY ARIZONA APPROACH TO GROWTH MAY NEED TO BE EXAMINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time in nearly a century, Southern California has no obvious 
answer to a basic question the region has faced down through its history: Is 
there enough water to sustain all the development and population growth the 
area wants? 
</P>
<P>
Early in the century, Los Angeles provided the answer by going to the Owens 
Valley for water. Three decades later, working through the Metropolitan Water 
District, the region ventured out to the Colorado River for more supplies. And 
in 1960, MWD joined the State Water Project to ensure enough water, supposedly, 
until well into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
But the State Water Project is not now able to deliver what it promised. The 
region is wracked with the fourth year of drought. There are no more obvious 
big water holes out there. And the drought itself is causing people to ask 
whether Southern California can continue a pace of virtually unlimited growth 
without assurance of enough water to sustain it. 
</P>
<P>
Citizen activist groups in the San Fernando Valley have questioned the wisdom 
and equity of Mayor Tom Bradley's proposed drought-busting program of 10% 
mandatory water savings, which The Times supports. But they make interesting 
points. They claim the mayor's plan failed to deal with the underlying problem: 
too much development. For example, they cited Bradley's assent to the Porter 
Ranch project, which would gulp down an estimated 2 million gallons of water a 
day. A Bradley aide said, with reason, that that's a separate issue. The 
drought cutbacks would be only temporary. Besides, the aide said, changes 
required of the Porter Ranch, such as installation of a dual pipe system to use 
reclaimed treated sewage, would save water. 
</P>
<P>
Water agency planners contend that their job is to get the water, not to manage 
growth. But the cities that do have such authority are loath to curb 
development because they need growth to bring additional tax revenues into 
their treasuries. As a result, only a scattering of small communities in 
California have conditioned development on water availability in any manner. By 
contrast, in most of urban Arizona, any new project must have an assured 
100-year supply of water before it can be approved. 
</P>
<P>
Few officials are willing to say how much growth is enough; no single agency is 
empowered to make such decisions for the entire L.A. basin. But the water issue 
-- which will not go away when the drought ends -- may well force leaders to 
begin facing that challenge Arizona-like. And the sooner they start making 
those tough choices, the better.

OURS IS THE ERA OF HESITATION CHIC; 
</P>
<P>
PRESIDENCY: THE HECTORING CLASSES MAY DERIDE HIM FOR HIS LACK OF ACTION, BUT IT 
IS GEORGE BUSH WHO PROSPERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By R. EMMETT TYRRELL JR., R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr. is editor-in-chief of the 
American Spectator. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The majority leader of the House of Representatives is a dinosaur. This is not 
to say that he has enormous bulk, a tiny brain and lives on the Mesozoic Era's 
equivalents of broccoli and endive. But he is a relic from a faraway time when 
fantasticos roamed the political landscape. This is obvious from his policies, 
which are all passe, and from the fact that when Majority Leader Richard 
Gephardt wants a few laughs, he points to the White House's prudent responses 
to unprecedented international events and derides President George Herbert 
Walker Bush as "the hesitation President." 
</P>
<P>
He laughs, and President Bush prospers. In an era when unforeseen upheaval 
shakes Eastern Europe and the Soviet Empire, wariness is advised. If the Hon. 
Mr. Gephardt would take leave of his partisan gambits to observe the leaders of 
other developed countries, he would see that all are proceeding cautiously. 
Ours is the era of Hesitation Chic. 
</P>
<P>
And it works. The President is flourishing. His democratic aspirations for 
Nicaragua have been realized. The tyrant Noriega is in irons. The economy is 
sound. The nation is at peace. Some 70% of the American people applaud the 
President. Washington commentators grumble that Washington is no longer the 
center of "the action." Yet what is this "action"? The "action" seems to be the 
transformation of one's country from socialism and totalitarianism into a 
simulacrum of America. America is the ideal that the emerging democracies seek 
to emulate. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington the pundits and members of the loyal opposition such as the Hon. 
Mr. Gephardt compose the hectoring classes. They are always bawling for their 
President to take Action This Day, because they always thrive on presidential 
pratfalls and the political hullabaloo that invariably follows a bold 
presidential initiative. Yet some of the wisest students of history have noted 
the colossal political benefits that accrue when Hesitation is Chic. In the 
15th Century, that shrewd and sagacious Florentine statesman Francesco 
Guicciardini marveled at King Ferdinand V's artful use of hesitation. According 
to Guicciardini, when the "most powerful and prudent prince . . . wished to 
embark on some new enterprise or take a decision of great importance, he often 
proceeded in such a way that before his intentions were known, the whole court 
and nation already desired it, and cried out -- the king should do this . . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
Now that is precisely the procedure that is being followed by our own great 
President. In Panama he obviously wanted to see Manuel Noriega toppled, but 
proceeded cautiously. Soon "the whole court and nation" were urging military 
action, even the Democrats. When the President sent in the troops, only Jesse 
Jackson was around to carp. Similarly, in Lithuania, the President has acted 
with the political timing that Guicciardini admired. Obviously President Bush 
wants all the Baltic nations to be free and independent, but as Paul Gigot has 
pointed out in the Wall Street Journal, the President's cautious approach "has 
ensured that if he does ever impose sanctions and relations with Mr. Gorbachev 
go sour he'll have plenty of accomplices." Democrats and Republicans alike are 
urging action, and yet right now a compromise between Lithuania and the Soviets 
seems to be in the air. Either way the President's hesitation will be 
vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
In domestic policy, too, Hesitation Chic as practiced by Bush has led to 
enviable victories. When the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee 
heaved up a clean-air bill that would drag the economy back into the 17th 
Century, the President quietly resisted the bill until the Democrats 
compromised. He has followed the same tack with the minimum wage bill and with 
child care. 
</P>
<P>
The era of the great bellowing leaders is over. Hesitation is in, and we need 
not reach back to the 15th Century in search of its philosophical defenses. 
That incomparable American statesman and philosopher Calvin Coolidge 
admonished: "Never go out to meet trouble. If you will just sit still," our 
13th President explained, "nine cases out of 10 someone will intercept it 
before it reaches you." Today, he who hesitates dominates.

SO RAPE ISN'T HATRED?;

<P>
LAW: TO EXCLUDE FROM PROSECUTION ACTS COMMITTED AGAINST WOMEN WOULD BE A 
MOCKERY OF DISCRIMINATION LEGISLATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By LISA HEINZERLING, Lisa Heinzerling is a lawyer for a public-interest group 
in Chicago.

<TEXT>
<P>
Last December, a man walked into the engineering school at the University of 
Montreal armed with a hunting rifle. He entered a classroom and divided the 
students he found there into two groups: women and men. Shouting at the women, 
"You're all a bunch of feminists," he picked them off as if they were ducks in 
a shooting gallery. By the time he had finished his deadly stalk, he had killed 
14 women and injured many others. A note found in his pocket after he had 
killed himself declared that women had ruined his life. 
</P>
<P>
The man in Montreal killed these women because he hated them -- not as 
individual persons, but as women. The law in this country would not, however, 
consider these murders crimes of hate. 
</P>
<P>
We have come to use the term hate crime to refer to a crime committed not out 
of animosity toward the victim as an individual, but out of hostility to the 
group to which the victim belongs. The attack in Howard Beach, in which one 
black man was killed and two were beaten by white assailants, is one of the 
most notorious examples in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Some states have enacted laws specifically directed at hate crimes. California, 
for example, requires the collection and analysis of statistics on hate crimes. 
Other states either elevate a crime such as second-degree assault to 
first-degree assault where the assault was motivated by the victim's membership 
in a particular group or establish a separate crime such as "ethnic 
intimidation." 
</P>
<P>
Recently enacted legislation directs the federal government to gather 
statistics on such crimes. 
</P>
<P>
None of these laws include gender as one of the motivating characteristics that 
can turn an ordinary crime into a crime of hate. The new federal law, for 
example, considers hate crimes to be those impelled by the victim's race, 
ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation. Other, similar laws recognize as 
crimes of hate only those motivated by the victim's race, color, creed, 
religion or national origin. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, if a woman is beaten, raped or killed because she is a woman, this is not 
considered a crime of hate. 
</P>
<P>
"Race, color, religion, sex and national origin" has become a kind of refrain 
in our laws against discrimination. These characteristics invariably appear 
together as the forbidden criteria for the allocation (or withdrawal) of 
benefits such as education, employment and housing. One must, therefore, do a 
double-take when reading a discrimination statute that does not include gender 
as one of the forbidden bases for conduct. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for this exclusion cannot be that there is no problem. The special 
risk faced by women in this country because they are women cannot be denied. We 
have learned to order our lives according to this special danger, so much so 
that when we refuse thus to arrange our lives, we are held equally as 
accountable as our aggressor for any injury that results. 
</P>
<P>
Nor can the reason for failing to recognize some acts against women as hate 
crimes be that it is impossible to differentiate between those crimes and 
"ordinary crimes." We do not worry about this evidentiary snag in declaring 
that crimes motivated by the victim's race, creed or national origin are hate 
crimes. Indeed, one of the purposes of the new federal statute is to establish 
a method for identifying crimes of hate. 
</P>
<P>
We are not, it is true, accustomed to thinking of crimes against women in the 
same way that we think of racial or ethnic violence. We tend, instead, to treat 
brutalizing acts against women either as isolated cases -- that is, as events 
brought about by some specific characteristic or conduct of the victim -- or, 
in rare cases, as manifestations of racial or ethnic hatred. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, in searching for the reason why a group of boys brutalized a jogger in 
Central Park last spring, virtually everyone turned to race; the boys were 
black, the woman was white. But another white jogger in the park that night -- 
a man -- was also beaten, was not raped, was not, in short, treated as if he 
were less than human. It is at least curious, therefore, that people did not 
seize upon the one feature distinguishing the two runners -- gender -- and 
declare that a catalyst for the boys' most savage crime. 
</P>
<P>
This hesitation in pronouncing an act victimizing a woman a crime of hate is no 
reason not to pronounce it so. Indeed, this hesitation may be a symptom of the 
very pathology that produces such a crime. To deny that the outrages committed 
in Montreal are crimes of hate is to defy the facts, and to deny such acts our 
censure is to signal that crimes committed against women because they are women 
do not trouble us very much. That is a message welcome to no one but the 
misogynist.

PIANIST HEARS THE SOUND OF MUSIC IN SILENT FILMS; 
</P>
<P>
PERFORMER: ROBERT ISRAEL, 27, IS AN ANOMALY. HE PROVIDES ACCOMPANIMENT FOR '20S 
FILMS AND WILL ALSO BE HEARD IN A "21 JUMP STREET" EPISODE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After Robert Israel played the organ for five silent movie comedies at a UCLA 
film class this spring, a sophomore confided her initial surprise to him. "I 
was expecting an old man to be sitting there," she said. "I was shocked to see 
how young you are." 
</P>
<P>
In a business that peaked in the 1920s and fell apart when sound pictures 
became dominant during the Depression, the 27-year-old Israel is an anomaly. He 
is one of a handful of people in his generation, one bred almost exclusively on 
recorded sound, to play live scores for silent movies. 
</P>
<P>
And, ironically, recorded sound will soon bring Israel's silent-movie talents 
to a national audience. Israel will accompany a seven-minute silent film in 
Monday's hourlong episode of "21 Jump Street." In the show, an undercover unit 
thwarts an assassination attempt on a senator, and Officer Tom Hanson uses a 
silent movie to describe the slapstick rescue. 
</P>
<P>
Israel developed the "Jump Street" score as he would any other, by watching the 
clip once or twice and creating the accompaniment in his head. This music will 
be heard by an audience thousands of times larger than his usual audience. More 
than 8.5 million people are expected to be watching Monday's show, according to 
a Fox spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Israel's interest in silent pictures began 20 years ago when his father took 
him to The Silent Movie Theatre on Fairfax Avenue and other film venues. "I was 
fascinated by silent movies," he said. "The quality of life, the way they 
dressed, the landscaping. There was a simplicity in living back then that was 
reflected in ideals and behaviors of the films. It's an era gone by." 
</P>
<P>
He started collecting films at 13 and began to notice that music was important 
to the picture. He first played the piano at 16, and by 17 he accompanied his 
first silent picture, today's stage rage, "The Phantom of the Opera," at a 
Caltech film festival. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the Los Angeles native completed his music studies at Cal State 
Northridge. Although the school doesn't offer film accompaniment courses, 
Israel said what he learned there has helped his playing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very intensive study in music, which helps you interpret the language 
of music and understand music," he said. "So the film accompaniment was better 
than I was previously able to do. The best film accompanists studied music. The 
ones in the '20s were classical pianists, not hack pianists." 
</P>
<P>
William Toutant, associate dean of the CSUN School of the Arts, is a fan of 
Israel's accompaniments. "He points out certain dramatic and comedic points in 
the film with his harmonic imagination. What he does with the music really 
enhances the film, without drawing attention to the music." 
</P>
<P>
That, Israel said, is the accompanist's goal. "The music shouldn't set the 
mood," he said. "The film provides the mood, and the music realizes the mood 
the film is intending." 
</P>
<P>
Israel alluded to Bernard Herrmann's recorded score for Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 
movie "Vertigo" to support his point. "It's one of the most perfect film 
scores. The compositions seem to supplement the film without getting in the 
way. But if you take away the music, you've taken away a lot of the film." 
</P>
<P>
The pianist said live scores have a special touch that recorded scores lack. 
"The audience knows that there is something being created on the spot. It's a 
psychological effect. Musicians provide a link between the audience and what's 
on the screen." 
</P>
<P>
Israel's accompaniment schedule is unpredictable. He'll play for six films some 
weeks and other times accompany only two films a month at the Los Angeles 
County Museum of Art, UCLA's Melnitz Theatre and the Cultural Hall in North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
He creates about four of every five scores himself, rather than playing the 
music that was developed for the film. Sometimes he must develop a score 
without previewing the movie. "Instinct, experience and repertoire help a lot," 
he said. "If it's a Russian picture, you think of Russian composers." 
</P>
<P>
But in an anachronistic business that last thrived when Calvin Coolidge was 
president, accompanying a movie cold is the least of Israel's problems. 
</P>
<P>
Octogenarian Gaylord Carter, who has played for silent movies since their 
heyday, said that it's tough to be a young silent-movie accompanist today. 
"When I started, every theater hired an organist. They had to have them. 
There's not a future out there for the average performer today. You have to be 
a star performer to make it a viable profession." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his keyboard excellence, Israel faces another barrier: reverse ageism. 
"They imply that they think I'm just not experienced enough," he said about 
some who consider hiring him. "I'll ask, 'Why?' and they'll say that I'm too 
young." 
</P>
<P>
Israel said the limited competition that exists in the accompaniment world 
seems fierce. "It's a combination of elements. Some people have egos to 
satisfy, some are trying to just grab the limelight and not to compose a 
serious score, and others are scrambling to get work." 
</P>
<P>
On top of all that, the audience may not like his interpretation of a film. He 
has received hate mail for his film scores, such as "Nosferatu," the 1922 
German film, for which Israel played Brahms, Beethoven, Wagner and others. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a letter that said I 'should not play church chords' and that the music 
sounded like 'waltzes and polkas all night long,' " Israel said. "If you can 
find in any music book what 'church chords' are, please let me know. I don't 
know where his ears were placed during the evening." 
</P>
<P>
So why does the young pianist persist? "My love of silent movies and my love of 
music," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Israel alternates between using the piano and the organ for his accompaniments. 
"They're entirely different," he said of the two instruments. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of sheer power and volume, the organ has it over the piano. But the 
piano can be very effective." The choice of instrument has a bearing on the way 
he arranges a score, he added. 
</P>
<P>
When he's not accompanying silent films, Israel sells pianos and organs for 
Church Organs Inc. in Pasadena and plays classical piano. "Classical music is 
the biggest passion I have, and it's not one that opens up a lot of jobs," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One drawback of the "Jump Street" score, Israel noted, is that it may typecast 
him. But silent-film organist Stan Kann, who played the organ occasionally on 
"The Merv Griffin Show" and "The Mike Douglas Show," doesn't think Israel will 
have a problem getting classical piano recitals. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a marvelous pianist with a fabulous memory. He can play a two-hour 
program completely without music," Kann said. "If I could play piano as well as 
he does, I wouldn't play the organ." 
</P>

PERFORMANCE: 71-YEAR-OLD ARTIST SPEAKS OF THE HERITAGE OF PEOPLES OF AFRICAN 
DESCENT, THEIR DIGNITY, BEAUTY AND STRENGTH, THROUGH DANCE.

<P>
A small, plump figure wrapped in brightly colored print fabric, her arms loaded 
with silver and ivory bangles, Pearl E. Primus is a force to be reckoned with: 
grand and humorous, learned and girlish. 
</P>
<P>
At 71, the dancer-choreographer-anthropologist has long been known for her 
pioneer work in documenting, preserving and celebrating African and 
African-American culture. Her hefty resume is filled with lists of awards and 
honors. Yet she's not above taking an earthy pleasure in sashaying around on a 
makeshift stage to the teasingly insistent drumming of her son-the-musician. 
</P>
<P>
Appointed the Chancellor's Distinguished Lecturer in Fine Arts at UC Irvine, 
Primus gave a public lecture Wednesday evening in the university's Physical 
Sciences Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"Dance is my language," she declaimed, folding her arms majestically. Then she 
recounted how she talked her faculty advisers into counting dance as one of the 
two foreign languages she needed to fulfill her Ph.D. requirements in 
educational sociology and anthropology at New York University. 
</P>
<P>
"I started to dance not to entertain, but to help people better understand each 
other," she said, back in her effortlessly eloquent mode. "I wanted to speak of 
the heritage of peoples of African descent, their dignity, beauty and strength. 
. . I used the dance to fight racism, to fight ignorance where I found it. . . 
. I had to have my facts -- that is why I delved into anthropology. Dance was 
my teacher." 
</P>
<P>
Years ago, she went to the American South "to feel the earth beneath my feet" 
in the cotton fields. "In Alabama, I said I was from Georgia; in Georgia, I 
said I was from Tennessee. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Primus, whose accent gives her away as a New Yorker, knew it was impossible to 
disguise her background. ("There is a different twang, a different tempo to 
one's walk from place to place.") But she learned the folk tales and the 
dances, and experienced firsthand the life of coping with Jim Crow laws. 
</P>
<P>
She showed a group of slides of some of the drums and masks she has brought 
back from Africa. "My technique was formed from the great sculpture of Africa," 
she said, drawing attention to its "strong, jutting forms" and "fullness." She 
used to imagine herself as the sculpture: Suppose she assumed the same 
positions -- how would she move? 
</P>
<P>
One slide was of a sculpture of the head of a woman with full lips, a broad 
nose and large, protruding eyes. When it was shown in a museum, Primus said, an 
official called her in anguish. 
</P>
<P>
"We're busing black children to show them their great heritage and they snicker 
and hang their heads," the official lamented. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you expect a child taught no respect of his culture to see beauty 
here?" she replied. "What else have you said? What else have you shown them? 
There's no use saying Picasso used these as models -- they don't know who 
Picasso is." 
</P>
<P>
And then came the images of Primus in her brilliantly vivacious prime, shot by 
Barbara Morgan and other noted dance photographers. There was the young, 
modern-dance trained woman with her upturned, ecstatic face and powerful thighs 
pushing through space in "African Ceremonial," or catching her skirt under the 
toes of one foot as she whirled off the ground in "The Negro Speaks of Rivers," 
after a poem by Langston Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved the air," she said happily. "I thought the plie (a squatting dance 
movement) was a shout from the earth." 
</P>
<P>
So where did her dances come from? From research into the experiences of black 
people. In Cuba, for example, slave overseers -- who reported to absentee 
masters -- were likely to lose their jobs if the number of slaves diminished 
over the course of a year. Slaves were chained together so nobody would run 
away. Walking in chains was a step-and-pull movement, as Primus demonstrated. 
</P>
<P>
In American black churches, she said, a preacher would stretch up one hand to 
receive a blessing from the creator and extend the other arm to comfort and 
bless his flock. She showed a slide of a dancer imbuing these simple gestures 
with fervid power. 
</P>
<P>
Today's speedy, superficial world dismays Primus. (At one point during her 
talk, she said: "I could go on forever. But in our country you can't go on 
forever. You can't go beyond 10 minutes beyond how long you said you'd be.") 
Dancers today "don't have the inner time," she said. "They don't have the depth 
of wanting to understand what the earth is, what the sky is." 
</P>
<P>
Although plagued with slide projector malfunction and noisy children in the 
audience, the lecture took on the feel of a revival meeting, with numerous 
murmured assents from black students in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
When Primus finished speaking, her son, Onwin Babajide Primus Borde, threw 
himself into a round of passionate drumming that didn't end until the stage was 
filled with shaking, swaying dance department faculty and students -- including 
choreographer Donald McKayle, Primus' former student, who bowed at her feet 
before stepping back to join suavely in the dance.

OCTAVIO SOLIS HAS CREATED A NEW 'JUAN'; 
</P>
<P>
HIS 'MAN OF THE FLESH' IS NO PRIVILEGED GRANDEE 
</P>

<P>
Although South Coast Repertory is touting Octavio Solis' "Man of the Flesh" as 
a Chicano satire of the Don Juan myth, the playwright is not sure he likes the 
description. 
</P>
<P>
"I have problems with the word Chicano," said Solis, whose play opens tonight 
on the SCR Second Stage. "It sounds like a dated term that reflects a very 
active political movement of the '60s and '70s. That's what produced the word 
Chicano. I just think of myself as a Mexican-American." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, it's not as though his writing has been devoted to ethnic material or, 
for that matter, even touched on it before. "Man of the Flesh," developed at 
SCR's Hispanic Playwrights Project, marks the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"None of my plays really dealt with any Hispanic themes at all up to this one," 
the 32-year-old El Paso, Tex., native said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, while Solis can speak and read Spanish, he adds that he is not 
literate in the language. Though he grew up speaking it at home, he not only 
has a scant Spanish vocabulary but he thinks in English now. After watching 
U.S. television throughout his childhood and being educated in public schools, 
he said, he can't help considering English his mother tongue. 
</P>
<P>
Why then the sudden burst of interest in the ethnic culture he seems to have 
left behind? In practical terms, "Man of the Flesh" was originally commissioned 
for Teatro Dallas in Texas, which was not exactly looking for an Anglo-style 
play. More philosophically, Solis said, "I had perhaps been ignoring things 
about myself and my background that I needed to give a second look." 
</P>
<P>
The Don Juan myth appealed to him in particular, he noted, because it persists 
in the Hispanic ethos as something that is both embraced and rejected. "We 
don't like to think of the Latin lover or the Don Juanism or the machismo as 
being a prevalent force in our cultural makeup," Solis asserted. "But it is a 
very strong force . . . it is an archetype." 
</P>
<P>
In doing his research for "Man of the Flesh," Solis said, he discovered that 
virtually "every culture has its own manifestations of the Don Juan myth," 
which is why artists as different from each other as Mozart, Shaw and Moliere 
have been able to make compelling use of it on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
Solis decided to satirize the myth by deflating the traditional image of the 
rakish Don Juan figure as a privileged grandee. Thus, "Man of the Flesh" 
revolves around young Juan Tenorio, whose hard-working father operates the 
Pronto Lawn &amp; Garden Service. And from a reading of the script, it would 
seem that Juan has hardly any redeeming virtues. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the work I'm doing is parody," Solis said. "I wanted to cast Don Juan 
as one of us, one of those Hispanics who has either recently arrived in this 
country or not been here past a generation. I thought it would be fun to have 
the noble, poetic cad in a position where he has to work his way up from the 
bottom of the ladder." 
</P>
<P>
If the power that Juan possesses over women in "Man of the Flesh" does not 
derive from position or personality, where does it come from? 
</P>
<P>
"His passion," the playwright says. "He claims he would rather be like everyone 
else. But when he sees women and they see him, there's an uncontrollable urge" 
to devour each other. Juan also has a nasty tendency to threaten anyone who 
gets in his way -- including his lovers -- with exposure to immigration 
officials ("Why don't I give INS a buzz? They might like to see who's got their 
papers."). 
</P>
<P>
When not writing plays, Solis makes his living as a writer of video scenarios 
for an educational project in San Francisco, where he has lived since September 
after spending 10 years in Dallas. "We're working on a teaching tool that uses 
interactive computer videos," he explained. "The scenario has plot points that 
revolve around the player." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he is also at work on a new play commissioned by SCR. As yet 
untitled, it deals with "chaos theory, which is a mathematical-scientific term 
for dynamical systems," Solis said. "I've been interested in the subject for 
the last two or three years." 
</P>
<P>
Though the subject sounds rather obscure for the stage -- not to mention dry 
and arcane -- Solis is confident it can be dramatized by cradling it in a 
20th-Century version of the Faustian myth, another archetypal story that runs 
through many Western cultures. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a bargain with the devil, but the devil is not a character or someone 
who is visible," he pointed out. "In this case, the devil would be a 
radioactive isotope." 
</P>
<P>
 "Man of the Flesh" opens today at 8:30 p.m. on South Coast Repertory's Second 
Stage and runs through May 20. The theater is at 655 Town Center Drive, Costa 
Mesa. Tickets: $18 to $25. Information: (714) 957-4033.

<TEXT>
<P>
Designer Sandra Garratt is still searching for the pipeline from her 
million-dollar ideas to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Her first wardrobe invention, the modular fashion line Units, is an 
international clothing chain that grosses about $75 million annually. Her 
second brainchild, Multiples, is expected to gross $60 million worldwide this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Garratt's worth? "Less than zero." 
</P>
<P>
As happened with the late Halston, as well as Norma Kamali, Rebecca Moses, 
Ronaldus Shamask and scores of talented designers, a web of legal and financial 
woes have recently jeopardized Garratt's career. And for Garratt, 38, this 
isn't the first time. A pioneer in today's component-dressing trend, she says 
she has repeatedly been outmaneuvered by the manufacturers who once backed her. 
</P>
<P>
In October she filed for protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code amid her 
protests that her former collaborator in Multiples, the Dallas-based Jerell 
Inc., usurped her creative control and withheld $4.8 million in royalties. 
</P>
<P>
In April, a Dallas bankruptcy judge approved a $130,000 settlement offer from 
Jerell and freed the manufacturer of further royalties to the designer. 
</P>
<P>
"In volume manufacturing, there aren't many good guys. It's sharks," says 
Garratt, a former Californian who shares a warehouse loft with her 12-year-old 
son in the shadow of Dallas' post-modern skyline. 
</P>
<P>
"If you think they're your friends, you're mistaken." 
</P>
<P>
"We were very fair to her," says Jerell president Jerry Frankel, noting that 
his company paid Garratt "$2 million cash" over two years, before litigation. 
</P>
<P>
The Multiples morass is Strike 2 for Garratt, a tall, ascetic-mannered woman 
who grew up in Malibu Canyon and attended Agoura High School. Four years ago, 
she also lost big on Units, her original dress-the-masses idea. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, Garratt's generic, cotton/polyester knits were the rage of 
Bohemians and off-hours models. Ritzy Dallas matrons braved their way to her 
warehouse studio for the proletariat wear that could create a svelte illusion 
on the least likely figures. 
</P>
<P>
Each piece came with a printed Units "manifesto," advocating global 
responsibility through no-waste, no-fad dressing. 
</P>
<P>
She wholesaled her clothes to Maxfield Blue (now Maxfield) in West Hollywood 
and Henry Bendel in New York. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, she found backing for her fledgling Units line from a pair of Dallas 
venture capitalists. She became a minor partner in Stinu Corp. (that's Units 
spelled backward), formed to manufacture the line. Within three months, she was 
"squeezed out," she says, by "macho Texans" who wanted her concept and 
patterns, but not her. She received a $75,000 cash settlement, lost rights to 
the Units name, and agreed not to compete with Units for six months. 
</P>
<P>
Don Rhoden, Stinu's former CEO, says Garratt left "of her own choosing" before 
Units opened its first store. Now there are 200 outlets across the United 
States, Canada and Europe, many of them in Southern California shopping malls, 
including Century City. 
</P>
<P>
"She was the one who had the problem with me. Not me with her," says Rhoden, 
who calls Garratt "very charming and bright." He says he regretted her 
departure. 
</P>
<P>
"When she left, we had to do the best we could." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Units was sold to J.C. Penney for an industry estimate of $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Disaster follows any creative person who has commercial viability," says 
Garratt, who passes time on her stationary bike while waiting to find a backer 
for her newest fashion concept. 
</P>
<P>
Former employees describe this calm, auburn-haired woman, a vegetarian and 
animal rights advocate, as being so sensitive to her workers that she kept a 
masseuse on call during office hours. They see her as driven to interpret needs 
of "the people" -- not to dress Ivana Trump. She's known for her purity of 
purpose, not business sense. 
</P>
<P>
"Sandra is a little naive and soft for a business as tough as the apparel 
business," says her adviser, New York business consultant Bert Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"She won't compromise her designs or ethics for a dollar," says Clint Colker, 
an alumnus of both Stinu and Jerell. "She'd rather go back to cleaning houses 
and maintain her integrity than sell out to 'garmentos.' " 
</P>
<P>
Garratt finds one constant in her life: "Success and failure. It's always back 
to back." 
</P>
<P>
At her 1974 graduation fashion show at Los Angeles' Fashion Institute of Design 
and Merchandising, retailers booed her narrow silk skirts and tunics, she says. 
"The girl who was least sophisticated, they loved her stuff," she recalls. She 
was about to leave the show in despair when it was announced that she'd won the 
Bob Mackie Award, a top creative honor voted on by faculty and press. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, she created windows for Halston's Madison Avenue store and worked 
in the shops of Mary McFadden and Zoran. She married fellow designer and 
California native Michael Garratt. 
</P>
<P>
They formed a design company in New York that lasted one season. When it fell 
apart in 1977, they moved to Dallas at the urging of Michael's brother, who 
lived there. 
</P>
<P>
Here, Garratt created must-see windows, among them some sexy lingerie scenes, 
at the pricey women's boutique Marie Leavell. Her provocative visuals, she 
says, got her fired. Broke and divorced, she started stitching cotton knit 
jail-striped dresses, bandeaux and leggings: the mix-and-match forerunners of 
Units. 
</P>
<P>
Garratt's idea was to create simple, accessible clothes. She's drawn to basics 
like Levi's and Jockey T-shirts -- garments that, "when you finally retire 
them, you almost mourn for them." 
</P>
<P>
She made Units as a one-size-fits-all system of mixable parts, cut from square 
patterns with little fabric waste. The concept has proven so lucrative that 
Units has not only grown to vast proportions, but also has numerous industry 
copycats. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, just months after she left Units, Jerell offered Garratt a licensing 
arrangement for a second Units-style venture. At the time, she was cleaning 
homes for cash. 
</P>
<P>
She says she lacked a rapport with Frankel, but adds: "He had a factory in 
place. I was impressed by his manufacturing potential." 
</P>
<P>
"The mistake she's made," says Israel, "is that she hasn't, in setting up her 
deals, screened carefully and long enough the people and situations. Had she 
analyzed before jumping, she would have probably waited for a slightly 
different opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Says Frankel: "I don't think she realized how good a company we were, or how 
much we were doing for her." 
</P>
<P>
Though sales of Multiples hit a reported $100 million the first year, the deal 
with Garratt soon soured. 
</P>
<P>
"It was difficult working with her after the first year," says Frankel. "We 
still tried our best, and it just didn't work." 
</P>
<P>
Garratt accused Jerell of using unapproved fabrics and colors and poor 
construction. In a March, 1989, lawsuit against Jerell, she also asserted that 
the company had developed a similar line that it was selling in competition 
with Multiples and that she'd been shut out of a portion of her royalties. 
Frankel denies all her charges. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, she started marketing a new, independent clothing line. Her 
mistake, industry watchers say, was that she planned to finance the collection 
with her Jerell royalties. When Jerell countersued her last fall, the company 
withheld her royalties. When the payments stopped, Garratt's fashion launch was 
canceled in a tangle of unpaid bills. 
</P>
<P>
George Goldstein, a former Jerell vice president who joined Garratt in business 
last summer, says Garratt's new line had secured $20 million in wholesale 
orders -- had she only been able to ship the clothes. 
</P>
<P>
"To a degree, she shot herself in the foot," says Goldstein, now a Los 
Angeles-based clothing wholesaler. "She had no provision to survive without 
that (royalty) revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't go out and buy missiles from your enemy, and use them against them, 
without them getting mad at you." Still, he says he would work with her again. 
"I would do anything to help Sandra finish her mission. She means something to 
people. She's not just a commodity." 
</P>
<P>
Unchanged by bankruptcy, Garratt still dresses in T-shirts and purple-dyed long 
underwear. She sends her son Wesley to a Montessori school. She sleeps on a 
mattress on the floor in a rented brick warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
Since last fall, she's had several false starts with investors. They lose 
interest, she says, when they realize that "Sandra Garratt" continues to appear 
on all Multiples' packaging. According to the April bankruptcy settlement, 
Jerell may continue to use her name through January, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things she has to offer, besides her sizable design talent, is a 
nationally recognized name," says Garratt's attorney, Robert Primeaux. "She 
can't present that cleanly to a potential licensee." 
</P>
<P>
The new Sandra Garratt line will consist of three interacting collections: body 
wear, active wear and a new dressing system called Whole. 
</P>
<P>
Though proud to have created Units and Multiples, she says they look contrived 
to her these days. Units, the J.C. Penney subsidiary, is made by a design team 
and has expanded to include voile and eyelet fabrics, says Units spokeswoman 
Cynthia Sutton. Multiples, sold in 450 department stores, is marketed by sizes 
and includes the new collections of Multiples Motion and Multiples Choice. 
</P>
<P>
As she waits for deep pockets to find her, Garratt maintains: "I haven't lost 
my center. The money isn't part of my identity. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no shame in being victimized. But I don't want to be a victim again."

DARRYL DAWKINS FINDS LOVETRON IN ITALY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN WILSON, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TURIN, Italy 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The terrifying dunk is still his trademark. Ever the free spirit, he still 
calls himself "Chocolate Thunder" and dreams of his own planet "Lovetron." He'd 
still rather play to the crowd than play defense. 
</P>
<P>
So what's new about Darryl Dawkins after a season in Italy? 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just Darryl Dawkins any more," he says. "I'm international now." 
</P>
<P>
And a winner, too. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-11, 267-pound center helped lead Ipifim Torino to a 23-7 record, 
best in Italy, earning the team a promotion from the A-2 division to the 
premier A-1 league and a berth in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
In the 30-game regular season, Dawkins averaged 21.2 points and 8.8 rebounds 
per game. Attesting to his penchant for dunking, he shot an amazing 
division-high 75 percent from the field. 
</P>
<P>
On April 28, he scored a game-high 29 points on a variety of dunks, inside 
power moves and soft jumpers as Ipifim won the best-of-three, first-round 
playoff series over A-1's Enimont Livorno, last year's losing finalists. 
</P>
<P>
After a 14-year career in the NBA that foundered after injuries and personal 
tragedy, including the suicide of his estranged wife, Dawkins may have found 
his utopian "Lovetron" after all in Turin. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been like a new lease on life," he says. "I could play here five or six 
years...If I had known it was this nice over here I probably would have left 
the NBA sooner." 
</P>
<P>
Dawkins, 33, points to his success as a vindication of the people in the NBA 
who said he was washed up, that he was too old, too fat, too slow, too 
undisciplined. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I can still play in the NBA," he said, leaning back in a swivel chair 
at the team offices before a recent playoff game. "I can outplay half the guys 
who are there now. There aren't that many established centers. And I can handle 
them all anyhow." 
</P>
<P>
Dawkins says he would like to play again in the NBA, preferably in his hometown 
of Orlando, but only if "the money is right." Otherwise, he says it would be 
"hard to say no" to another contract with Ipifim, although he declined to 
disclose his salary. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a three-bedroom house with a loft and a brand new station wagon. 
Anything I want over here, they get for me...I don't know why I'd try to fix 
something that's not broken." 
</P>
<P>
Never one to mince words, Dawkins doesn't hide his contempt for the way he 
feels he was misunderstood and mistreated by the NBA. He suggests he may even 
have been "blackballed" out of the league. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at some of the guys in the NBA who have had drug problems, and they're 
giving these guys a chance to come back. I didn't have any drug problems. I had 
injuries and personal problems. And they just refused me a chance to get back 
in. In the NBA, if they want you in there, you'll be in there. If they don't 
want you in there, I don't care what you do, you're not getting in there." 
</P>
<P>
Dawkins figures his outspokenness and non-conformist ways may have made some 
enemies. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the last of a dying species," he says. "I would bring a different girl 
to every game. I'd come dressed one week in cowboy boots, jeans and cowboy hat, 
and then the next week in serious suit and tie, and the next week I could be 
wearing shorts. 
</P>
<P>
"I said what I felt and I did what I felt. If they asked me if somebody could 
play, I'd say something like, 'Hey this guy can't play dead in a cowboy movie.' 
I guess they just weren't used to hearing people say what's on their mind." 
</P>
<P>
Dawkins has been viewed as a textbook case of unfulfilled potential. With his 
size and strength, he was billed as a possible franchise player when he joined 
the NBA in 1975-76 at the age of 18, straight out of high school in Orlando, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
But in seven seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers, five with the New Jersey Nets 
and two with the Utah Jazz and Detroit Pistons, he never quite measured up to 
expectations. His best season statistically was 1983-84, when he averaged 16.3 
ppg for the Nets. 
</P>
<P>
Dawkins says he never got the credit he deserved. 
</P>
<P>
"If they always said that I was just a mediocre player, then how did I stick 
around 14 years? And in the playoffs, if I was just a mediocre player, how am I 
holding my own against Jabbar, Lanier, Parish and these guys?" 
</P>
<P>
Plagued by injuries, Dawkins played in just 26 games from 1987-89 with New 
Jersey, Utah and Detroit and was let go by the eventual NBA champions. He 
attended the Orlando Magic's minicamp but walked out, he said, because the team 
wouldn't give him a guaranteed contract. 
</P>
<P>
His career was further troubled by the medication-overdose death in 1987 of his 
estranged wife, Kelly Barnes Dawkins. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a rough time a few years back," says Dawkins, who has remarried. "It 
would have been easy for me to say okay I'm through. But I managed to put it 
together and come back again. I thank God for that. I don't know how many 
players could do that." 
</P>
<P>
In Turin, a northern industrial city famous as the home of the Fiat auto giant, 
Dawkins is mobbed by fans almost wherever he goes. He has learned to survive 
without American fast-food and to adjust to Italy's slower pace of life. 
</P>
<P>
"You start to learn that from 12 o'clock to 3 o'clock you're not going 
anywhere, you're not doing anything, so you might as well learn to take a nap 
for that part of the day." 
</P>
<P>
On the court, to make up for the cultural and language differences, Dawkins has 
adopted new crowd-pleasing routines. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to do some other things besides talk to thrill the crowd," he says. 
"Like if the ref makes a bad call, you can turn to the crowd and make a 
gesture." 
</P>
<P>
Ipifim Coach Giuseppe Guerrieri says Dawkins has been a great surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard a lot of bad rumors about him before he arrived, that he was crazy, 
undisciplined, a troublemaker," Guerrieri says. "But he turned out to be a real 
gentleman. He practices hard. He has never been a second late for practice or 
the team bus." 
</P>
<P>
The coach's only complaint is that Dawkins often doesn't get back down court to 
play defense. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not my main priority to play defense -- at all," Dawkins admits. "I would 
rather shoot and dunk the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Dawkins is often remembered in the NBA for his backboard-breaking dunks. Who 
can forget his self-described "Chocolate Thunder Flying, Robinzine Crying, 
Teeth Shaking, Glass Breaking, Rump Roasting, Bun Toasting, Wham, Bam, I Am 
Jam" of Nov. 13, 1979, against Kansas City? 
</P>
<P>
Dawkins says Italian backboards are easy to break but that's he's "lightening 
up" on some dunks to avoid injury. 
</P>
<P>
"But every now and then," he says, "a guy will be really on me and I'll have to 
jam one in his face to make him remember."

IT LOOKS FUN, BUT LIFE IS NO GAME FOR HARRIS; 
</P>
<P>
DODGERS: INFIELDER USES MUCH OF HIS SALARY TO KEEP HIS FAMILY TOGETHER IN 
INNER-CITY MIAMI. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lenny Harris plays every game for the Dodgers like a man given a reprieve. 
</P>
<P>
His swings are bigger than he is. He runs the bases in fast-forward. He never 
slides when he can dive, and never dives when he can keep on running, forcing 
yet another infielder to stare at his oncoming jersey and scream for the ball. 
</P>
<P>
When he finally stops, if he's safe, he stands up and claps, same as the fans. 
Only he is clapping harder. 
</P>
<P>
To watch Harris is to think there is no one happier to be in uniform, nor more 
uncertain of keeping that uniform. 
</P>
<P>
When Lenny Harris is told this, he frowns. 
</P>
<P>
He plays this way, he says, because it is this way. 
</P>
<P>
After a typical night game, he returns home to his new wife, Carnettia, and the 
trappings of a $150,000 contract. When the adrenaline wears off, he falls into 
a peaceful sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Then in the middle of the night, the phone rings. It sounds like the sirens 
that used to echo past his house in Miami's depressed Liberty City area. But 
the sirens eventually faded. This phone will not stop ringing. 
</P>
<P>
So he answers, even though he knows he will recognize the voice and the 
request. 
</P>
<P>
"Baby brother, I know it's hard," one voice says, "but I need $400 for the 
rent." 
</P>
<P>
"Baby brother," says another voice, on another night, "I need $200 for food." 
</P>
<P>
"Baby brother," says yet another voice, "I need help." 
</P>
<P>
Harris hangs up and falls back into an uneasy sleep. The next morning, he will 
wake up, write the checks, and promise he will never do this again. A morning 
later, he will break that promise. 
</P>
<P>
As the youngest of nine brothers and sisters, most of them mired in the poverty 
and problems of inner-city Miami, Lenny Harris worries about plenty more than 
statistics. As the leader of a family split by the death of his mother six 
years ago, he needs more than applause. 
</P>
<P>
He plays hard not because it looks good, but because it pays well. Because he 
needs to keep on writing checks. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm my family's last hope," Harris said this spring. "If I can't 
put my family back together again, nobody can." 
</P>
<P>
On April 16, Harris was given the best chance of his young career. When Jeff 
Hamilton's torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder sidelined him indefinitely, 
Harris and Mike Sharperson were made the team's platoon third basemen, with the 
left-handed hitting Harris starting against right-handed pitching. 
</P>
<P>
In his eight games at third base since, he has had eight hits in 26 at-bats for 
a .308 average with five runs batted in and three stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no problems going with Sharperson and Harris at that position for 
however long it might take," Manager Tom Lasorda says. "We feel very 
comfortable with both of them." 
</P>
<P>
That's encouraging, and those are good numbers, but Harris wants more. He says 
he will prove to the Dodgers that he can be the full-time starter. 
</P>
<P>
"They will see," says Harris, 25. "I will show them." 
</P>
<P>
He is not being cocky, just practical. He says he is not the kind of player who 
can afford to talk about being a starter one day. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of guys sit around the clubhouse talking about the future," he says. 
"Well, I ain't looking to the future. I can't. I live day to day, just like my 
family lives. And I play day to day, like every day is my last one." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers believe him. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of players have energy, but Lenny shows energy," says Joe Amalfitano, 
the third base coach. "He has speed, but he also has quickness. That's what 
unsettles other teams, quickness." 
</P>
<P>
Harris says he has learned you can never be too quick. 
</P>
<P>
"You see, in my life, I never know what is going to happen, one day to the 
next," he says. 
</P>
<P>
There was the time he received a phone call about his father's roof caving in. 
Harris had to find money for a new roof. 
</P>
<P>
And last winter, as he and his wife were planning their February wedding and 
honeymoon cruise, one of his five older sisters was having a drug problem and 
needed to enter a rehabilitation center. Harris canceled the cruise and paid 
for her stay. 
</P>
<P>
"Now she's out, now she's saved," Harris says. "None of my family is in any 
serious trouble. I just want to keep it that way." 
</P>
<P>
Harris, acquired by the Dodgers last summer from Cincinnati as part of the 
trade that also brought outfielder Kal Daniels from the Reds, has not always 
felt this need to head the family. 
</P>
<P>
Although he grew up in tension-filled Liberty City, in a house on the busy 
street that led to the local hospital, he says his childhood was relatively 
stable. His father, Arthur, worked at a local fruit market; his mother was a 
maid at a Miami Beach hotel, and together they kept the family close. 
</P>
<P>
"Lenny was the kind of guy who, if his friends didn't want to take him home on 
time, he would leave them and walk home," recalls Joe DiFalco, his former 
baseball coach at Miami's Jackson High. "His family was very strong." 
</P>
<P>
Every ounce of that strength was needed in May, 1980, during the Liberty City 
riots. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents made us stay in the house, and all night long we heard those sirens 
going past," Harris says. "I'll never forget the sound of those sirens." 
</P>
<P>
Feeling that his life had been saved by this tight family, it was only natural 
that when Harris was signed by Cincinnati as a fifth-round draft choice in 
1983, he gave his entire $32,000 bonus to his mother. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't no gift," Harris says. "She worked 30 years for it." 
</P>
<P>
But his mother soon became ill, and the family's troubles began. The split 
started in the spring of 1984, when Harris was summoned home from the Reds' 
minor league training facility in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked my sister over the phone if everything was all right with my mother, 
and she said yes, but that I should still get home," Harris says. "Then I get 
into the Miami airport, and my sister still won't tell me anything. I finally 
walk in my door, and my Dad is in tears, and my brother tells me, 'She's gone.' 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it. I fainted." 
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing years, as Harris rose through the minor leagues, homecomings 
became less noteworthy. Although his eight siblings still lived in Miami, he 
says there were fewer people to welcome him. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody started slipping away," he says. "My father was always having to ask 
people to come over and see him, and that ain't right. When all of us would get 
together, we would argue. We were becoming less and less of a family." 
</P>
<P>
In September of 1988, Harris finally made the major leagues with the Reds. Even 
though he was making the minimum salary of $62,500, with a raise to $71,000 
last year, it looked like big-league money to him. 
</P>
<P>
"So, he started giving it all away, doing things for everyone in his family," 
says DiFalco, now a close friend. "He was very concerned about the family 
situation and didn't know how to help, so he took care of everybody." 
</P>
<P>
He bought his father a car. He bought his sister a car. He began paying rents, 
and repaying debts. 
</P>
<P>
"My family is fighting for survival," Harris says. "It's the least I can do." 
</P>
<P>
Says DiFalco: "Maybe the reason Lenny looks so loose on the field is, he feels 
more pressure to keep his family happy than to play baseball. It's like, 
baseball for him is the fun part." 
</P>
<P>
Fun for Harris is a game such as the one last Aug. 23, against the Expos in 
Montreal, when the Dodgers asked him to play outfield for the first time since 
he was a child. Harris shrugged, smiled and said fine. Twenty-two innings 
later, he was still smiling, having made a leaping catch in left field and 
gotten a career-high five hits. 
</P>
<P>
"The only problem was that I got tired just walking out to my position," Harris 
said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Fun for Harris is also a game such as the one April 21 against Houston. He had 
gone hitless in 12 at-bats to open the year, but was he worried? 
</P>
<P>
"I just know that ball will fall in," he said before the game. "Good things 
will happen to me; I can just feel it." 
</P>
<P>
Two innings into the game, everybody at Dodger Stadium was feeling it, after 
Harris had tripled in his first at-bat against Astro starter Jim Clancy. It was 
the start of a run of four hits in eight at-bats with three RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
He is a streaky player, with streaks not only of hitting, but of generosity and 
caring and pain. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 17, he was married. Several members of his family missed the wedding. 
He was deeply hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still split; I have not gotten everything together yet," Harris says. 
"But I will. Everything will turn out all right. We'll all be happy. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I can't be no Superman. But I can try."

ACTOR RAPPAPORT APPARENT SUICIDE VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOCELYN Y. STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Television actor David Rappaport was found dead in a Los Angeles park Wednesday 
evening, apparently of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Rappaport's body was found by a jogger in Laurel Canyon Park off Mulholland 
Drive about 6 p.m. Wednesday, police said. He had been shot once in the chest, 
authorities said, and a weapon was found near the body. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the wound was apparently self-inflicted and did not indicate that 
there was foul play. They said the actor, who was engaged to be married, had 
been reported missing Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Rappaport, 38, most recently played the role of a cunning attorney on "L.A. 
Law." The 3-foot-11 actor suffered from achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism in 
which the trunk of the body grows, but arms and legs are stunted. 
</P>
<P>
On March 4, Rappaport was hospitalized suffering from carbon monoxide 
poisoning. Police found him lying unconscious and not breathing in an idling 
Volkswagen with a hose connected from the exhaust pipe to the inside of the 
car. Detectives described the incident as "an obvious suicide attempt." 
</P>
<P>
The former school teacher played in the 1981 movie "Time Bandits" and gained 
popularity in the United States in 1985 with another British film, "The Bride." 
That role eventually led to guest appearances on several talk shows and 
television series. 
</P>
<P>
At the peak of his career, Rappaport starred in the 1986-87 television series 
"The Wizard" as a genius toy maker with special powers to "solve unsolvable 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
The series was the first in television history with a dwarf as its star. 
</P>
<P>
"No one can figure this out," said Rappaport's publicist, Joel Parker, who said 
he knew of no reasons why the actor would kill himself. 
</P>
<P>
Parker dismissed speculations that Rappaport was despondent over his career. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that he was very busy," Parker said. Rappaport was to begin filming a 
movie in Ireland in September and a syndicated series, "Beyond the Groove," was 
to debut in July. 
</P>
<P>
Parker also dismissed the idea that unhappiness over his height led the actor 
to take his life. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone seems to agree that he was very well adjusted to that. . . ." he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At times, Rappaport seemed unfazed by his size and appeared to count it as an 
asset to his career. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't give up, you can turn anything to your advantage," he said in a 
1986 interview. "I'm much more widely known than if I were six feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
"I know there are people who look at me and immediately think 'handicapped.' 
But being small hasn't stopped me from doing anything I've ever wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
But two years later, Rappaport told a different interviewer that he had faced 
discrimination because of his size, and he expressed a desire to be treated 
like "a regular, boring normal person." 
</P>
<P>
He said: "I look at boring people every day and I say, 'God, I wish I could be 
like that.' But my lot is to be unique, special, so I have to put up with it. 
It's a hard life." 
</P>
<P>
Rappaport is survived by his ex-wife Jane and a 13-year-old son, Joe. The 
funeral will be held in London next Tuesday and a memorial service will be held 
later in Los Angeles.

Pimen, patriarch of Moscow and all Russia, died Thursday at age 79, clearing 
the way for deep change in the Russian Orthodox Church, the 1,000-year-old 
institution said by critics to resist reform more stubbornly than the Soviet 
Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1971 and the now-derided era of Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev, Pimen 
had been spiritual head of the country's Orthodox believers, who number as many 
as 50 million. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years he clearly became too infirm for the job. When priests last 
October celebrated the first religious service in the Kremlin's Church of the 
Assumption since the Bolshevik era, the frail and white-bearded patriarch, 
visibly ailing, had to be carried back to his limousine. 
</P>
<P>
Orthodox activists said Pimen's history of compromise with the Soviet 
government and his poor health meant that their long-suppressed church has not 
seized opportunities made possible by the reforms of President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev received Pimen in the Kremlin in April, 1988, for the first talks 
between a Russian Orthodox patriarch and Soviet leader since World War II. He 
said then that the church has a clear role to play in helping effect the 
changes in society that are the chief goals of his perestroika program for 
economic and social restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
It was a striking shift in Soviet policy, which had previously sought to 
circumscribe church action or even brutally eradicate religious faith. 
</P>
<P>
In a message read on state-run television news, the Holy Synod of the Russian 
church reported Pimen's passing "with deep sorrow," but it gave no clue as to 
the cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
The synod met Thursday night in Moscow, preparing to elect an acting patriarch. 
By tradition, a permanent successor is to be chosen within six months by 
another church body, the Local Council, which is composed of all metropolitans, 
archbishops and bishops as well as representatives of both clergy and laity. 
</P>
<P>
The act of choosing a new Russian patriarch is certain to unleash high-level 
debate about religion's place in Soviet society and the degree of independence 
that the church should seek. 
</P>
<P>
Pimen's path was to defer to the Kremlin by giving, for example, seemingly 
knee-jerk approval to its foreign policy and arms control initiatives and by 
never raising the church's voice against human rights abuses or social policies 
now acknowledged to have been grave errors. 
</P>
<P>
"Pimen's place in history was similar to Brezhnev's," said Orthodox activist 
Mikhail Osadchi, linking the church leader with what is now publicly termed the 
"era of stagnation." He said believers want the next patriarch to be like 
Tikhon, who was named to the post in 1917 and set a course independent of the 
fledgling Soviet government. 
</P>
<P>
Under Pimen's stewardship, the church paid millions of rubles annually into the 
coffers of the Soviet Peace Fund, an officially sanctioned social organization 
created to push Kremlin foreign policy goals. Pimen also traveled to the United 
Nations in New York, to Berlin, Budapest and elsewhere to endorse the words and 
deeds of Soviet leaders at international conferences and meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Pimen's church has also fought bitterly to hang on to the real estate and 
parishioners it gained in the western Ukraine in 1946 when dictator Josef 
Stalin forced the Ukrainian Catholic Church to merge with Russian Orthodoxy and 
relinquish both its believers and sanctuaries. 
</P>
<P>
Disapproval of Pimen surged into view under the freer climate of opinion 
inaugurated by Gorbachev. In 1988, as the church prepared to celebrate the 
millennium of Russian Christianity, dissident priest Gleb Yakunin and his 
followers sent Pimen a letter asserting that he was too old, sick and 
discredited by his lack of independence to take real advantage of Gorbachev-era 
freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
"We are obliged to tell you the truth . . . that you, your holiness, are so 
weakened by your ailments that you are not in a condition to bear the burden of 
patriarchal service," the dissidents said. 
</P>
<P>
Counterattacking, Pimen accused his critics of sowing the seeds of temptation 
and discord and of violating church discipline. He said they should be dealt 
with on the basis of a "strict pastoral approach and healing guardianship of 
the soul." 
</P>
<P>
Pimen, whose given name was Sergei M. Izvekov, was born July 23, 1910, into a 
family of civil servants in the Moscow region. At 17, he took monastic vows and 
went on to serve as father superior of the Trinity-St. Sergei Monastery in 
Zagorsk, the country's most important, in 1954-57. 
</P>
<P>
He became a bishop in 1957 and was appointed business manager of the Moscow 
patriarchate three years later, in 1960. That year he also became an archbishop 
and a permanent member of the Holy Synod. 
</P>
<P>
He was named a member of the Congress of People's Deputies, the new Soviet 
Parliament, last year.
