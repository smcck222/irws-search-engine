ROCK VOCABULARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jonathan Gold's April 21 review of Mind Over Four was an education for me. 
</P>
<P>
First, I learned how to spell the rock guitar sound "NNNGAOOOWWww-wee-wee-wee!" 
(But I'll never remember the italics on that first wee.) 
</P>
<P>
And there were so many clever juxtapositions: "crunching riff," "swirlly 
Siouxsie drone," "keening wail" (that sent me to the dictionary) and last but 
not least, "a pan-tonal Brecht-Weill beat." 
</P>
<P>
Gosh, Gold's writing makes the work of that British critic who, in prehistoric 
times, was ridiculed for writing of "Aeolian cadences" in the Beatles' "Things 
We Said Today" seem very feeble, indeed.

MEDIA TREATMENT OF THE 'HILARY IN HIDING' CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "Trail of Abuse in the Hilary Custody Case," by Howard Rosenberg (April 24), 
about the dispute between Dr. Elizabeth Morgan and her former husband, Dr. Eric 
Foretich: 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg claims this "may be the most stunning case of abuse by the media. . . 
." He himself has made a contribution to that abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere does he address the central issue -- the (alleged) sexual molestation 
of 7-year-old Hilary. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan was forced to take her case to the media. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg inadvertently demonstrates why. While pooh-poohing the claims of 
sexual abuse by saying no court has upheld the allegation, he ignores that a 
court barred Foretich from seeing another daughter (from a previous marriage) 
after accusations of sexual molestation arose and he ignores other court 
findings in this area. 
</P>
<P>
I know of no woman who would have acted differently from Morgan in going 
public.

I want to thank Rosenberg for restoring some of my faith in objective reporting 
through his comments about the Morgan-Foretich child custody case.

He points out how the media can influence, either knowingly or unknowingly, 
such matters.

The media seem to have taken up Morgan's side. Thanks to Rosenberg for his 
voice. Only time will tell in this complicated case.

As music supervisor for the picture, I worked in tandem with director Bill

RATIONAL MAYBE, MORAL NEVER; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH-CARE SHORTAGES VIVIDLY ILLUSTRATE THE HEARTBREAKING DILEMMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The imaginative effort and the predictable failure of Alameda County to devise 
a rational rationing of public- health services provides a lesson for every 
county in the state. More than anything else, the failure measures the 
inadequacy nationwide of basic health services, an inadequacy that is at once 
dangerous in health terms and costly in fiscal terms. 
</P>
<P>
Rationing of health care for the poor and uninsured already is a fact, imposed 
by endless lines at clinics, the unavailability of specialists, the limited 
access to diagnostic services and hospitals, and the enduring squeeze on 
public-health budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Alameda County decided to do by design what was being done by chance, and in 
the process make more effective use of health-care dollars. Oregon's experiment 
along similar lines was a model. Oregon made an open decision to focus limited 
funds on primary care, thus ensuring such services as prenatal care, the most 
cost-effective medical investment, but denying organ transplants. It was a 
decision as honest as it was controversial. But the Alameda County study 
quickly discovered that "The health care system for the poor and uninsured in 
Alameda County is already stretched so thin that . . . rationing, prioritizing 
. . . specific services or procedures relative to target populations or 
diagnostic categories are impractical and morally indefensible." 
</P>
<P>
The same conclusions apply to most of the counties, probably all of the states. 
California has 5.2 million without health insurance, many of them children. The 
most recent evidence of the failed health-safety net is the outbreak of 
measles, accompanied by a record death toll, at a time when immunization can 
provide protection. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when artificial budget restraints dominate politics, it apparently 
has been easier for legislators to postpone providing adequate health funds 
even though they certainly know that postponement extracts a staggering 
increase in the cost. That must change.

GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Georgia -- now there's an enlightened state. In Georgia the only requirements 
for gun ownership are an assertion of sanity and a driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
(And, of course, the price of the gun.) One then instantly qualifies for 
possession of a killing weapon and becomes the proud owner thereof -- no 
inconvenient waiting. 
</P>
<P>
And that's exactly what happened when a mental patient treated for "homicidal 
tendencies" bought a gun, hours after his release from a mental hospital. He 
then went on a shooting spree, killing and wounding (Part A, April 26). 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Joe Frank Harris, reacting to public furor, conceded that the shootings do 
make a strong statement for gun control, at which time pragmatism apparently 
struck, and in a brilliant conclusion stated, "I'm not sure any gun control 
could prevent something like this from happening." 
</P>
<P>
The good ol' boys in the NRA must jus' love Georgia to death.

WORKING OUT OF A TIGHT SPOT; 
</P>
<P>
BUSH WAS RIGHT TO REFUSE TO OFFER VILNIUS GUARANTEES OF INDEPENDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is not easy to be both prudent and principled in the pursuit of foreign 
policy. So far, however, President Bush has struck that balance on the question 
of Lithuanian independence. At the moment, the beneficiaries of his success 
appear to be the American and Soviet people; ultimately, the Lithuanians, too, 
will profit. 
</P>
<P>
The latest test of Bush's resolve in the matter came this week when Lithuanian 
Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene was invited to the White House to plead her 
struggling government's cause. Clearly her presence in Washington just weeks 
before the President's May 30 summit with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was 
an inconvenience, if not embarrassment, to the Administration. Thus, there 
probably was as much chagrin as diplomatic scrupulousness in the rather 
grudging initial reception Prunskiene was given at the White House. She was 
forced to leave her car and show her Soviet passport at the executive mansion's 
gate, then walk up the driveway to the White House itself. There, she and her 
party were left to wait unattended for 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Point made -- however indelicately: Prunskiene does not represent a nation 
officially recognized by the United States. She does, on the other hand, 
represent a people badly used by history, and for whose wholly legitimate claim 
to self-determination the American people have profound sympathy. President 
Bush made that essential point, too, in their frank, 45-minute talk. 
</P>
<P>
The President reminded Prunskiene of how the West rhetorically encouraged the 
1956 Hungarian uprising, then stood back and watched as it was murderously 
repressed. In place of such bloody brinkmanship, he said, the United States 
wants "dialogue -- talk, talk, talk." He also correctly turned aside her 
suggestion that America become a formal mediator between Vilnius and Moscow. 
"If there was a constructive role for the United States, of course, we should 
fulfill that," Bush said, "but there's not." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most important, the President rejected Prunskiene's proposal that the 
West "guarantee" Lithuania's independence by formally recognizing its 
government, sovereignty and territorial boundaries. In return, she had 
proposed, her government would accept a recent suggestion by the French and 
Germans that Lithuania voluntarily "suspend" its declaration of independence 
for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Self-reliance and not another's guarantee is the wellspring of genuine 
self-determination. Americans are not indifferent to Lithuanian freedom, but 
they cannot be made hostage to a particular notion of how it must be expressed. 
John Quincy Adams' admonition to realism applies now as it always has: "We are 
the friend of liberty everywhere, but the custodian of none but our own."

HISTORY OF LITHUANIAN NATIONALISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article by Frankel and Kux is very much like the articles which were 
printed by the Nazis in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Then the mud was slung at the Jewish people. In this article it is slung at 
Lithuanians. Note the derogatory adjectives, the hateful tone, the distortion 
of facts and one-sided, broad generalizations which are used to arouse 
contempt. Hitler built the ghettos based on contempt. 
</P>
<P>
It is disgusting to think that a "historical writer" (Brian D. Kux) is capable 
of such bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Frankel and Mr. Kux, your writing is more suited to the 1930s.

CONRAD'S JERUSALEM CARTOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Conrad either has not bothered to read your paper's news reports or has chosen 
to create his own facts upon which to base his false and misleading cartoon. As 
reported in these pages, approximately 150 Jewish settlers moved into a 
building in Jerusalem's Jewish quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to Conrad's depiction, the building was not the site of the Last 
Supper, nor is it a holy site at all. No places holy of any faith were violated 
in any way by the act of the settlers. 
</P>
<P>
When Jordan seized the Old City of Jerusalem during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, 
all Jewish inhabitants were expelled and denied access to the Western Wall and 
Jewish holy places; edifices and cemeteries were desecrated. 
</P>
<P>
Israel reunited Jerusalem after the 1967 war and the Israeli government passed 
the Protection of Holy Places law guaranteeing the preservation of all holy 
sites in the city in accordance with Israeli law which protects the freedom of 
religion and worship for people of all faiths. 
</P>
<P>
The settlers broke no law in their actions; any illegality relates to the issue 
of tenancy and subtenancy. Israel's Supreme Court has upheld the eviction of 
the settlers and ordered that they must leave the site. 
</P>
<P>
While the settlers and the Israeli Housing Ministry were rightfully condemned 
for their insensitivity, this was not and should not be wrongfully portrayed as 
an Israeli attempt to conquer the holy sites of any other faith. Conrad's 
placement of Prime Minister Shamir and an Israeli flag on the table of Da 
Vinci's Last Supper is inaccurate and is not based on the facts as they were 
reported by The Times.

of fun with minimal expense. In fact, some of the options now on the horizon 
for solving these problems are truly exciting. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, in the Earth Day edition of The Times, "Irrelevance of Good 
Intentions" (editorial, April 22) highlights the need for just one of these 
pending options. Take air pollution, transportation and solid waste for 
example. We desperately need to clean up our air, cut down on traffic 
congestion, build new public transit and solve our out of control trash 
problems. Sounds like an impossible task. Right? Wrong! There is currently an 
effort under way to do all four in one project. 
</P>
<P>
It's called the Southern California Monorail Project ballot initiative. It 
creates the publicly elected regional Southern California Monorail Transit 
Authority, one of the missing governmental links in the region according to The 
Times. It instructs this publicly elected authority to select a private master 
developer through the bidding process. It then mandates that this 
private/public partnership shall be fully operational not later than Dec. 31, 
2010, at minimum a 2,000-mile, regional six-county transit system. 
</P>
<P>
The system shall carry passengers 24 hours a day and in off-peak hours shall 
carry freight and during special hours shall collect the solid waste from all 
six counties and take it to remote central processing facilities. The public 
puts up one-third of the cost through a 20-year half-cent sales tax in the six 
counties and the private sector puts up two-thirds of the total cost. The 
freight and solid waste allow the entire system to operate at a profit, 
generate its own energy, recycle every Southern Californian's solid waste, 
eliminate the need for new landfills and possibly could even replace some 
existing oil- and gas-fired electric plants in our populated areas. 
</P>
<P>
People cannot be expected to make changes in their daily lives for the 
betterment of society and the environment unless options such as the Southern 
California Monorail Project are provided. This is just one example of a 
self-supporting alternative now in development which will help to recover some 
of our lost quality of life while setting an example for people everywhere on 
how to solve our many collective urban and environmental problems with a little 
creativity.

The waves have been hiding their foaming faces from me since fall slid into 
winter. I'm sure the sand stayed where I left it in September, with its traces 
of shell, seaweed and bottle caps. 
</P>
<P>
But what of the multi-colored blankets, covered with human beings fleshy and 
hard, listening to radios, dogs, kids -- playing, barking, running? 
</P>
<P>
While I sat shivering, wrapped in a down-filled comforter and watching 
football, ghostly Field of Dreamers played pepper and rundown to an empty 
stadium, empty seats across town. No one tossed bags of salted peanuts. Ask 
Shakespeare; winter is the season for ghosts. 
</P>
<P>
The rains fell, but not too frequently. It was cold, very frequently. 
</P>
<P>
The summer girls were there, of course, albeit stuffed into form-resistant 
coats and mufflers. You knew they wanted to burst out of their cocoons, to 
float their flora and forms, but couldn't. It was too damn cold. 
</P>
<P>
To someone from the East, Los Angeles is a year-round mecca of warmth, but the 
native Angeleno knows the difference. The novelty of winter wears off and the 
sensible among us long for shorts, T-shirts and Gatorade. 
</P>
<P>
Then it arrives. Quietly. It may be the kiss of a warm breeze or the pollen 
that makes us sneeze. I push ahead my clock and the grasses grow faster. The 
idled lawnmowers growl again. 
</P>
<P>
Off come the cocoons. The butterflies look beautiful. Real baseballs get tossed 
around the infield; bags of salt-roasted peanuts arc in the bleachers, into my 
hand. On go the swimsuits. The waves are just as I left them, spiked with 
boogie boards. Children and lovers dig toes in the sand. 
</P>
<P>
Summer is here at last. Ain't life glorious!

WASHINGTON'S UNESCO BOYCOTT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congratulations on your editorial. I too, along with most Americans, have been 
deeply disappointed in UNESCO. 
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, which began on such an idealistic and optimistic note, has 
ended up anything but that. 
</P>
<P>
UNESCO, its "educational, scientific and cultural" organization, is just 
another example of good Western intentions corrupted and gone astray. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the neutral organization working for world peace and understanding 
as originally envisioned, it has become a mere propaganda machine for the 
political and military aspirations of the communist and the totalitarian 
elements of the Third World. Along with this, anti-American and anti-Western 
attacks are common. 
</P>
<P>
As pointed out in your editorial, UNESCO is so blatantly anti-Israel and 
pro-Palestinian, that any credibility it may have once had in helping to bring 
peace to the Middle East has been apparently totally lost. 
</P>
<P>
Let's continue to support America's and the United Kingdom's decision to refuse 
financial support until the original purpose is re-established.

SAN YSIDRO PORT IS BRACING FOR 4-LANE CLOSURE; 
</P>
<P>
BORDER: AN 18-MONTH-LONG PROJECT TO REMOVE ASBESTOS COULD MEAN AN EVEN LONGER 
WAIT AT THE ALREADY CONGESTED CROSSING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Asbestos insulation must be removed from the port of entry at San Ysidro, the 
world's busiest land border crossing, forcing the shutdown of four traffic 
lanes for 18 months beginning next year, government officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The planned lane shutdowns, revealed to area officials and business leaders 
last month, has set off alarm bells along both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
The San Ysidro port of entry was traversed last year by 50.5 million people, an 
average of almost 1 million a week, and 13 million vehicles. It is considered a 
commercial and cultural lifeline between San Diego and Tijuana, a binational 
metropolitan area of more than 4 million people. 
</P>
<P>
The much-maligned, 24-lane facility is the site of monumental traffic tie-ups 
-- particularly during weekends and holiday periods -- that often force 
motorists to wait two hours or more before entering the United States from 
Mexico. Few issues raise ire along the border area as quickly as the traffic 
jams that develop as motorists await U.S. Customs inspections. 
</P>
<P>
"This (the shutdown) is going to have a dramatic impact," said Dann Pegg, 
former president of the Border Trade Alliance, a group representing industries 
on both sides of the border. "I think it's a very poor use of resources." 
</P>
<P>
Al Reese, a spokesman for the San Diego Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau, 
added: "I think this is going to exacerbate an already difficult traffic 
situation at San Ysidro." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, San Diego and Tijuana business leaders have been seeking construction 
of a third border crossing, to the west of San Ysidro, but the proposal faces 
huge engineering, environmental and funding obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of the temporary lane closures at San Ysidro was raised Friday during 
a visit to San Diego by U.S. Customs Commissioner Carol Boyd Hallett, who met 
with business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The asbestos removal, part of renovation of the 17-year-old San Ysidro 
facility, is being undertaken by the U.S. General Services Administration. 
Planners labored to devise a method that would minimize disruption, said Mary 
Filippini, a GSA spokeswoman in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that this is an inconvenience, but I don't know how else 
to do this project," Filippini said. "The asbestos needs to be removed, and I 
don't think that later would be any better." 
</P>
<P>
Asbestos fibers, once widely used as a fire-retardant and insulator, have been 
linked to lung cancer and other pulmonary disorders. The fibers have been 
removed from schools, libraries and other public and private buildings 
nationwide in recent years, often at a high cost and with considerable 
disruption. 
</P>
<P>
At San Ysidro, the likely result appears to be even greater traffic tie-ups, 
particularly as the number of legal border crossers continues to increase. Last 
year's 50.5 million border crossings is 11% higher than the previous year, and 
the numbers are expected to continue rising. 
</P>
<P>
The asbestos removal is to begin in January and last for 18 months, said 
Filippini. The work will be done in four-lane sections, she said, with crews 
working 16 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
It should take three months to complete work on each four-lane section, 
Filippini said. The lanes must be closed to facilitate removal of the hazardous 
fibers from the sprawling port building, which sits above the traffic lanes, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The $9-million renovation project will also include the construction of a new, 
18-lane pedestrian entrance. Also planned is the installation and an improved 
air-circulation system to disperse the vehicle fumes that have plagued border 
inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. border officials say they will work to minimize the disruption, but they 
acknowledge that they are limited by a lack of staff and and the facility's 
physical constraints. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for ways to avoid the delays," said Allan Rappoport, district 
director in San Diego for the U.S. Customs Service. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Rappoport and the Customs Service have often been criticized 
for not facilitating border traffic. Some critics have maintained that Customs 
has been so interested in boosting border drug seizures that it hasn't paid 
enough attention to the smooth flow of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Rappoport has heatedly rejected the criticism, contending that he has done the 
best he can with his limited staff of 352 inspectors, who are spread out along 
the entire California-Mexico border area. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the San Ysidro work, Customs officials are looking into the 
possibility of moving up the opening date of four new lanes under construction 
at the smaller Otay Mesa port of entry, 7 miles east of the San Ysidro 
facility. The 5-year-old Otay Mesa port, which now has nine lanes, is scheduled 
to expand to 13 lanes in July, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
However, Rappoport acknowledged that many border crossers, particularly 
visitors, do not know how to find the Otay Mesa port, which limits its 
effectiveness as an alternative.

THE FLOWER-ARRANGEMENT ART OF JAPAN BLOOMS WITH HELP OF SAN DIEGO SENSEI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANKI V. RANSOM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sadako Oehler has tried for years to promote Japanese culture in San Diego 
through flower arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Oehler has studied ikebana, a highly structured form of Japanese flower 
arranging, since she was a 12-year-old girl in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
In 1947, after graduating from the Ikenobo Art Institute in Kyoto, Japan, she 
began teaching the art to others, first in Japan and, after 1959, in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
She is now the chief instructor (sensei) of what has become the popular Ikenobo 
Ikebana chapter in San Diego. Today, the chapter which she founded, celebrates 
its 15th anniversary at the Marriott Hotel next to Seaport Village. 
</P>
<P>
"It was particularly gratifying to see the chapter established, since it was a 
dream started in 1959 when I first arrived in San Diego and started teaching 
floral arrangements," Oehler said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the anniversary celebration, Muneo Nakamura, a professor from the 
Ikenobo Art Institute in Japan, will today demonstrate the finer points of 
stylized flower arrangement at the Marriot. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, the professor demonstrated Ikenobo technique at one of the classes 
Oehler teaches in Balboa Park three times a month. 
</P>
<P>
"When arranging flowers, we pay attention to the natural characteristics of 
plants," Nakamura said through an interpreter. "In Ikenobo, how materials grow 
in nature is an essential characteristic, and the arrangement should bring out 
their natural characteristics. Some plants grow curved and some grow straight." 
</P>
<P>
There are three styles of Ikenobo, rikka, which is an upright style depicting a 
landscape; shoka, a traditional and modern form that uses one to three plants, 
and jiyuka, or freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
The different styles must have harmony or balance for the plants to interact or 
respond to each other, Nakamura said. He compared flower arranging to making a 
cup of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
"First the coffee is black, it is good but bitter, sugar is added to make it 
taste better, and milk is added for good harmony and you have a perfect cup of 
coffee," Nakamura said. "You use three different materials for a good cup of 
coffee. In flower arranging, you don't throw three materials together, you use 
plants that work well together as the materials do in a cup of coffee." 
</P>
<P>
In his shoka arrangement, Nakamura chose three plants with different shapes, 
colors and characteristics. He put the bird of paradise in the vase first 
because it was the central piece due to its beauty and brilliant orange. The 
privet was chosen for its light green, which contrasted with the slender yellow 
iris. 
</P>
<P>
The headmaster of Ikenobo School in Japan, described the art of flower 
arranging this way: 
</P>
<P>
"The moment a flower is cut, it severs all ties with nature. The time when that 
flower is about to be placed in a vase, there comes a moment when the soul of 
the flower and the soul of the ikebana-lover merge into one full being set 
aflame. That's the moment when the life of ikebana makes its new birth."

ACCOMPLICE IN '88 RACIAL SLAYING GETS 14 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 20-year-old Rancho Bernardo man was sentenced Friday to 14 years in state 
prison for his role in furnishing an assault rifle and a truck in the racially 
motivated slayings of two unarmed Mexican men in Rancho Penasquitos in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Bencivenga was sentenced by San Diego Superior Court Judge William Mudd, 
who also imposed a $5,000 fine to be paid from Bencivenga's prison earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Mudd is the same judge who sentenced the gunman, Kenneth Kovzelove, 18, of Mira 
Mesa, to 50 years to life in prison Feb. 13. 
</P>
<P>
Bencivenga pleaded guilty to two counts of voluntary manslaughter April 5; two 
murder counts were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Mudd allowed Bencivenga to be placed in the California Youth Authority until 
age 25, when he will be transferred to an adult prison. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Dave Stutz told Mudd that Bencivenga went to San Diego 
police last year to provide information that solved the murders of Hilario 
Salgado, 22, and Matilde de la Sancha, 19. 
</P>
<P>
"But for Bencivenga, the real, true killer would not have been caught," said 
Stutz in court, adding that Kovzelove's hatred for Mexicans showed that he 
probably would have killed again had he not been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
"They died because of their race," said the prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
Kovzelove told investigators he killed the Mexican migrants because they took 
away jobs from Americans. 
</P>
<P>
In Bencivenga's probation report, Bencivenga was quoted as saying that, after 
Kovzelove, then 17, joined the Army and came home for Christmas, Kovzelove told 
him, "I want to kill some more Mexicans." 
</P>
<P>
Bencivenga told police that Kovzelove told him the Nov. 9, 1988, shootings on 
Black Mountain Road were "fun." 
</P>
<P>
"Who was he going to do next, me, my friends?" Bencivenga was quoted as telling 
police, according to the probation report. 
</P>
<P>
"He thought it was a game," said Bencivenga in the report. 
</P>
<P>
Bencivenga said nothing in court, but submitted a personal letter to the judge 
before his sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Stutz said Bencivenga told the judge in the letter that he wants to be a 
criminal defense attorney after he gets out of prison. 
</P>
<P>
Bencivenga furnished the South Korean assault rifle that Kovzelove used to fire 
18 shots at the victims, and he was the driver in the incident.

NEW SKETCH OF SLAYING SUSPECT RELEASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego police released a revised sketch Friday of a man seen fleeing the 
scene of a fatal stabbing in Clairemont in April, but they said they have not 
confirmed suspicions that the man is a serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
Since January, three young women have been stabbed to death in the area of 
3100-3400 Clairemont Drive. But, only after the most recent killing, on April 
3, did a witness glimpse the suspect. Three weeks ago, the witness helped 
police come up with a computer-generated image of the young black man, but that 
image was imperfect, said homicide Lt. Gary Learn. 
</P>
<P>
"The witness was never comfortable with the first composite," he said, adding 
that a graphic artist gave the revised sketch "the human touch" by altering the 
hairline, the ears and the facial features. 
</P>
<P>
Learn said: "With respect to the serial killer, I'd be the first one to 
acknowledge that, in the three cases, Jan. 12, Feb. 16 and April 3, there are a 
tremendous number of similarities. But I can tell you in all honesty that at 
this point . . . , we do not have physical evidence that can conclusively link 
these three cases together." 
</P>
<P>
Learn said 10 police officers, or one-third of the homicide unit, are working 
full-time on the case, canvassing the neighborhood and following tips. He 
estimated that officers have interviewed several hundred people, but he said 
they will need further cooperation to solve the case. 
</P>
<P>
"Somewhere in the community there's a distinct likelihood that someone knows 
this individual," he said. "It's going to take a lot of courage to come forward 
and provide us with this type of information . . . (but) however trivial it may 
seem to them, we need that kind of input." 
</P>
<P>
A $15,000 reward is being offered for information leading to an arrest by the 
Police Department, Crime Stoppers and the management company of the Buena Vista 
Garden apartments, where two of the slayings occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Dorothy Powell, a police spokeswoman, urged Clairemont area residents to 
take precautions. 
</P>
<P>
"The No. 1 thing they can do is lock their doors. We're finding an awful lot of 
doors unlocked -- a lot of people saying, 'Come in. It's open,' " she said. 
"We're asking them to be aware of their surroundings, know if someone is 
following them. If someone is following you, especially if you're a young woman 
going back to an empty apartment, don't go back to that empty house. Go 
somewhere where there are people." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone having any information about the killings or about anyone resembling the 
suspect is asked to contact the San Diego police homicide unit at 531-2500, or 
Crime Stoppers at 235-TIPS.

SEWAGE SPILL FOULS WATER OFF DOG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A blocked sewage main sent 72,000 gallons of raw sewage into the San Diego 
River on Friday, leading to the posting of water contamination signs where the 
river dumps into the ocean at Dog Beach, county health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The spill began at about 7 a.m. after rocks blocked a 12-inch sewer main, 
forcing sewage to overflow from a manhole in the 7400 block of Princess View 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The sewage ran into a nearby storm drain in the 7300 block of Mission Gorge 
Road and then flowed through a storm drain into the river. The spill was halted 
after four hours. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Avera, a spokesman for the county Department of Health Services, said the 
beach will remain off-limits until the water meets recreational standards.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
KEEPING THE GREEN WE HAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It seems almost un-American to suggest that a beautiful expanse of green lawn 
might be bad for the environment. But turf grass is hardly the best use of 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
More water, fertilizer and mulching are needed by lawns than by most other 
types of landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
With this in mind, two innovative proposals are under consideration in Orange 
County that would require developers to install landscaping that uses less 
water and otherwise conserves resources. These are the kinds of measure that 
should be adopted to make sure that Orange County never has to face the kind of 
water shortages that are already crippling Santa Barbara and threatening Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In Irvine, an ordinance is scheduled to go before the City Council on May 22 
that would allow projects to use grass in no more than 25% of landscaping and 
would require grouping of plants according to water needs. There would also be 
requirements to use composted organic matter. The ordinance would apply to 
public, commercial and condominium projects and would exempt single-family 
residences. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a county task force is talking about having developers file a 
water management plan before a building permit can be issued. That idea, which 
would need approval from the Board of Supervisors, would institute guidelines 
on the kinds of vegetation that could be planted and the irrigation equipment 
that could be used. Also under consideration is a residential water-billing 
system that would allot water to homes based on the number of people in a 
household and the amount of landscape acreage of the property. 
</P>
<P>
Neither proposal would make Orange County any less green. Each would simply, 
and wisely, preserve resources.

YANKEES SOLVE LANGSTON, 5-2; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: AFTER BEATING NEW YORK LAST SUNDAY, ANGEL PITCHER GIVES UP MORE RUNS 
THAN IN ANY OF HIS FIVE STARTS THIS SEASON.

The supposed comforts of home weren't very comforting to the Angels Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the friendly confines of Anaheim Stadium after a two-week, 13-game trek 
across North America, the Angels did little to reward the 36,703 fans who 
welcomed their return. Mark Langston was tagged by the New York Yankees for 
five runs, the most he has allowed in any of his five starts this season, and 
the Angels' offense barely stirred in his support, resulting in the Yankees' 
5-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The key hit against Langston (2-2) was a three-run home run to right-center in 
the sixth by Jesse Barfield, his fourth homer of the season. Langston, who was 
a 4-3 winner over the Yankees last Sunday in New York, hit one batter, walked 
four and struck out five as the Yankees ended a five-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Yankee left-hander Dave LaPoint (2-2) went the minimum five innings to get the 
victory. He gave up only three hits, as the Angels managed only five overall. 
They are 3-6 in their last nine games and 5-11 in their last 16. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels entered the game with a team batting average of .236, tied for 13th 
in the American League, and they did nothing to improve it against Yankee 
pitchers LaPoint, Alan Mills, Lee Guetterman and Dave Righetti. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Polonia's triple and Devon White's sacrifice fly created the first run, 
which was the Angels' only run until Chili Davis walked against Righetti and 
Dante Bichette doubled him home. That extended Bichette's hitting streak to 10 
games. It also set a club record as the 22nd consecutive game in which the 
Angels have had at least one double. The previous record of 21 was set in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees opened their scoring in the third inning. Steve Sax walked with one 
out and stole second as Roberto Kelly struck out swinging. Don Mattingly, one 
of the few left-handed hitters to own a solid career batting average against 
Langston (.289 before this season), scored Sax with a single to center, winning 
the $35.5-million matchup (Langston's $16-million, five-year contract combined 
with Mattingly's $19.3-million, five-year pact). 
</P>
<P>
Before Langston's start against the Yankees Friday, left-handed hitters were 
only two for 17 against Langston this season. 
</P>
<P>
LaPoint, who lasted only two innings against the Angels last Sunday, retired 10 
consecutive hitters after Polonia. Wally Joyner ended that streak in the fourth 
with a one-out walk. Davis followed with a single and after Dante Bichette 
flied out to center, the Angels loaded the bases when third baseman Mike 
Blowers could not field Lance Parrish's dribbler up the line. The error was 
Blowers' fifth in two games, but LaPoint got out of the inning by getting a 
third strike past Jack Howell. 
</P>
<P>
Angel hitters are one for 10 in bases-loaded situations this season. 
</P>
<P>
The failure to produce a run in that situation proved important when the 
Yankees managed to a run in the fifth. Blowers led off with a walk and stole 
second. Challenging the six-assist arm of Bichette in right field, Blowers 
tagged on Alvaro Espinoza's fly ball to right and made it easily when 
Bichette's throw was off-line. Blowers had to hold when Sax grounded out, but 
he scored when Kelly rapped a single to right. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees got to Langston for three runs in the sixth, and their total of 
five earned runs was the most Langston had allowed this season. Langston struck 
out Mattingly but hit Steve Balboni on the hand and yielded a sharp single to 
Winfield before Jesse Barfield hit a 1-2 pitch to right-center for his fourth 
home run of the season. Langston ended the inning by striking out Blowers, his 
third victim, but the damage had been done. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Mills, once the Angels' property, relieved LaPoint in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Jackson, now a TV commentator on KTLA, gave Yankee outfielder Dave 
Winfield a hard time while the Yankees were doing their pregame stretching. "So 
you're a part-timer now," Jackson began, as Winfield, who missed the 1989 
season after undergoing back surgery, did his calisthenics. "You know what 
happens when they make you the DH. That's how they ran me out of baseball. . . 
. Don't leave anything on the warning track tonight because you know what 
people are going to say. They're going to say, 'Years ago, that would have gone 
out.' " The other Yankees smiled, giving Jackson more fuel. "The guys that are 
laughing the hardest are thinking the same thing," Jackson said. "Oh, and you 
know I need you for an interview?" 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's jesting may have inspired Winfield. He ended a career-worst 0-for-23 
streak in the fourth, with a single to right-center. 
</P>
<P>
To the delight of Angel newcomer Luis Polonia, Donnie Hill gave Polonia uniform 
number 22 -- which means Polonia can keep the ornate gold "22" charm he wears 
around his neck instead of selling it to Hill. "I figured I'd have to change my 
whole wardrobe if he gave it to me," said Hill, who took 18. 
</P>
<P>
Polonia was even more delighted to be in the starting lineup Friday against a 
left-hander. He showed his gratitude by leading off the game with a triple, the 
Angels' first triple of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great. That's telling me I don't have to think about whether I'm playing 
or not," he said. "That was the tough thing for me -- I'd be home and then come 
to the game and see I'm not in the lineup. Now I don't have to think about it 
or read the paper to see who's pitching. I'm going to be there and I'm going to 
do my job day by day." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Langston and his wife, Michelle, will provide the voices for two 
characters in an animated action-adventure TV series, "Captain Planet and the 
Planeteers." Langston will be the voice of "The Nuclear Computer," while his 
wife will be the voice of a TV anchor on a segment entitled "The Meltdown 
Syndrome."

SOCKERS HOPE THEY'RE NOT SLOWED BY WAIT PROBLEM; 
</P>
<P>
MISL: THE EMPTY TIME BETWEEN THEIR GAME 3 PLAYOFF VICTORY OVER ST. LOUIS AND 
TONIGHT'S GAME 4 COULD EITHER HELP OR HINDER.

ST. LOUIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The yawns are beginning to outnumber the smiles. 
</P>
<P>
After defeating St. Louis, 4-1, Tuesday to take a 2-1 lead in the best-of-five 
Western Division semifinals, the Sockers haven't done much more than sit around 
and wait for Game 4, which is tonight at 5:05 in St. Louis Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're getting a little bit stale here," said midfielder Branko Segota 
while slumped in a chair in the hotel lobby. "There's nothing to do. You can't 
keep busy." 
</P>
<P>
The agenda has been thin. Players have worn a path between the hotel, the pasta 
restaurant down the block and the nearest movie theater. Anything to kill time. 
</P>
<P>
"You try to find things to do instead of sitting in your hotel room for eight, 
ten, twelve hours," defender George Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
What remains to be seen is whether the Sockers will benefit from the rest or 
slip to a lower level of intensity. Certainly, four days to regroup should be a 
plus for St. Louis, a veteran team. Experience is nice, but it tends to work 
better after a good night's sleep. Neither team got much rest before Tuesday's 
game because Game 2 was Monday in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
That the Sockers can eliminate the Storm with a victory tonight isn't 
necessarily a good sign. It would be too simple. Keep in mind, the Sockers took 
a 2-1 lead in their best-of-seven semifinal series with Dallas last year and 
wound up losing the next two before wrapping it up with two victories at home. 
Then, in the championship series against Baltimore, the Sockers had a 3-1 lead 
with a chance to win the title at home but lost, and they lost again in 
Baltimore before hanging on by a thread to win Game 7. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody has ever been able to figure when, why and how this team gets motivated. 
Inspiration for Tuesday's victory came in part from captain Brian Quinn, who 
spoke before the game and told the team to start strong and win the first half. 
That worked once. 
</P>
<P>
"But if he says that (tonight)," goalie Victor Nogueira said, "it won't have 
the same impact because he said it last time. It has to be something 
different." 
</P>
<P>
This team gets bored easily, and not just while sitting in the hotel room 
deciding between "The Flintstones" and "Leave it to Beaver." Maybe winning 
seven championships in eight seasons has led the Sockers, if only 
subconsciously, to be at their best only when their best is required. Tonight, 
it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
So will the Sockers be ready? Or is it time to go into the tank for a game and 
return to win it more dramatically in San Diego on Tuesday? 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to say," Socker Coach Ron Newman said. "We're rested. I'm not so 
sure that a long stay like this in somebody else's city is good." 
</P>
<P>
To continue winning, the Sockers still need more from Segota. He scored timely 
goals in the first and third games but, with just four points in the series, is 
off to his worst start in nine playoff appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn leads the team with five playoff points and was sharpest in Game 3, 
despite scoring both of his goals in Game 2. When Quinn is in the lineup, the 
Sockers play a more elegant game and seem to have better scoring opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Newman isn't letting on who will start in goal, though he said he has made up 
his mind. Based on his past decisions, it is a good bet that it will be Zoltan 
Toth, who has both victories in this series. Toth has started over Victor 
Nogueira in six of the past eight games. In big games, Newman has traditionally 
gone back to the goalie who was strong in the preceding game. Toth was superb 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Minor concerns include forward Wes Wade, who came down with a touch of the flu 
Friday, and defender Cacho, still feeling soreness in his leg after missing the 
last three games of the regular season with a left knee strain. Both are 
expected to play. 
</P>
<P>
By all rights, this should be a tight and physical game, considering 
goalkeeping for both teams has been excellent and each team has committed a 
somewhat amazing 78 fouls in the series. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers are 11-7 since trading Zoran Karic for Paul Wright, and they have 
appeared confident since the start of the playoffs. But they aren't counting 
St. Louis out. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not going to roll over and die," Fernandez said. "No team does that. 
No human being does that if they have any kind of pride." 
</P>
<P>
Series Notes 
</P>
<P>
Perry Van Derbeck scored with 43 seconds left as Wichita defeated Kansas City, 
4-3, to keep the Wings alive in their Eastern Division semifinal. Kansas City 
leads the series, 2-1; Game 4 is tonight in Wichita. . . . Tonight's 
Sockers-Storm game will be broadcast on XTRA (690) starting at 4:55. . . . 
Responding to comments made by the Storm earlier this season that this was the 
worst Socker team in history, Branko Segota said: "I think it's not fair for 
them to say that because they're a new franchise, and half of them don't know 
the Sockers. The guys who have played us don't know anything but getting 
crushed."

YANKEES SOLVE LANGSTON, 5-2; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: AFTER BEATING NEW YORK LAST SUNDAY, ANGEL PITCHER HAS CONTROL 
TROUBLE. RADER SAYS HIS TEAM HAS NO EXCUSE FOR LOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
If he was tired, it was born of frustration, not fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Rader was tired of seeing his team unable to muster much of an offense, 
and he wouldn't accept the obvious excuse that the Angels might have been 
exhausted after a 13-game trip and unable to do better than five hits against 
the New York Yankees on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels been running on near-empty offensively all season, and their 5-2 
loss to the Yankees emphasized how low their fuel level is. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't accept (fatigue). If you're tired, you suck it up," Rader said after 
the Angels' sixth loss in their last nine games and 11th in their last 16. "You 
have no right to be fatigued. Possibly mentally fatigued, but physically 
fatigued, not these people here. I doubt that very few of these people here 
have been physically fatigued. Sometimes you might think you are, but you never 
are." 
</P>
<P>
They had to be tired of having little to show for their at-bats against Dave 
LaPoint (2-2), who last Sunday lasted only two innings against the Angels, 
giving up four runs (one earned). 
</P>
<P>
This time, after Luis Polonia tripled to lead off the first inning and scored 
on Devon White's sacrifice fly, the Angels had only two more hits off LaPoint 
in five innings and only one more run against the Yankees, who had lost their 
previous five games. 
</P>
<P>
"If everybody did what Luis Polonia did," Rader said, "we would have scored 
nine runs and won." 
</P>
<P>
They scored one more, when Chili Davis walked and Dante Bichette doubled in the 
ninth off Dave Righetti, the fourth New York pitcher. By then, they had 
squandered a bases-loaded, two-out chance in the fourth, leaving them one for 
10 in bases-loaded situations this season, and the Yankees had benefited from 
Jesse Barfield's three-run home run in the sixth off Mark Langston (2-2), who 
had earned the victory in that game against the Yankees last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the same old David," said Rader, who was a coach with the Chicago White 
Sox when LaPoint pitched there. "He changes speeds, turns the ball over and 
sinks it. He gives you the opportunity to get yourself out and that's exactly 
what we did for him." 
</P>
<P>
LaPoint was grateful that the Angels accepted his invitation and continually 
were retired on groundouts this time. 
</P>
<P>
"It was different last week because I had a passed ball (which set up a 
three-run Angel rally in the second inning) and I instantly went and tried to 
make too perfect pitches and they were taking them," LaPoint said. "This time, 
I relaxed and threw my pitches. 
</P>
<P>
"Doug knows me. He's seen my stuff. He knows if he's got a chance to bury me, 
he has to. My job is to just keep the game close." 
</P>
<P>
Langston, who went eight innings, was bent on the same mission but could not 
accomplish it. The two second-inning walks he issued were an indication that he 
was in for some problems, and he gave up a run in the third on a walk, a stolen 
base and a run-scoring single by Don Mattingly, one of the few left-handed 
hitters who owns a good (.289) career average against him. 
</P>
<P>
"If you flirt with danger as much as he was, one bad pitch is going to happen," 
Rader said. "That's not to belittle him, but when you're that wild and not able 
to control your pitches any better than that, problems are almost inevitable. 
You can't avoid danger if you put yourself in that position over and over 
again." 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees chipped away for another run in the fifth, using a walk, a stolen 
base and a run-scoring single by Roberto Kelly. Then they pulled away in the 
sixth. With one out, Langston hit Steve Balboni and then gave up a single to 
Dave Winfield. Barfield's home run to right-center came on a fastball down and 
away, and it left the Angels too far down to recover. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't getting my fastball over and that's the big key for me," said 
Langston, who had not given up more than four earned runs in any of his 
previous four starts this season. "I felt pretty lucky, considering how wild I 
was in the first couple innings. I never really got into a groove until after 
the damage was done and then I settled down and got ahead of the hitters. It 
was too late by then. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt rested. That wasn't the problem. It was location." 
</P>
<P>
He might have been assuming too much blame. Given the Angels' .233 team 
average, they are not likely to overcome many deficits. 
</P>
<P>
Or build many leads. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes

Reggie Jackson, now a TV commentator on Channel 5, gave Yankee outfielder Dave 
Winfield a hard time while the Yankees were doing their pregame stretching. "So 
you're a part-timer now," Jackson began, as Winfield, who missed the 1989

know I need you for an interview?" Jackson's jesting may have inspired 
Winfield. He ended a career-worst 0-for-23 streak in the fourth with a single.

PHILLIES MAKE MARTINEZ START A WASHOUT, 8-3; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: DODGER PITCHER GIVES UP FOUR RUNS IN FIRST INNING. RAIN DELAYS COME 
BEFORE GAME AND DURING THE SIXTH.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ramon Martinez entered Friday's game at Veterans Stadium with two consecutive 
victories and two complete games. 
</P>
<P>
He exited three innings later after reminding everyone of a more important set 
of twos in his life: He is still 22. 
</P>
<P>
The youngest Dodger was confused by the rain delay, the signs from catcher Rick 
Dempsey, and ultimately by the Philadelphia Phillies during the Dodgers' 8-3 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez gave up five runs -- four in the first inning -- on four hits in his 
shortest outing since becoming a regular starter last July. That is only two 
fewer runs than he had allowed in his previous 28 innings this season, during 
which he had a 2-0 record, a 2.25 earned-run average and a growing reputation 
as one of the league's best young pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, you could place emphasis on the word young. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I go out there, I learn a lot of things," Martinez said. "And I 
know I need to learn a lot more." 
</P>
<P>
He was not helped by a Dodger offense that scored its three runs on 11 hits, 
which translated to 10 runners left on base. 
</P>
<P>
"And all of that was in the first six innings!" said Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda 
after the final 12 hitters were retired by Phillie reliever Don Carman. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the Dodger hitters could be excused. Perhaps like the 8,926 fans, 
they were merely bored. The start of the game was delayed 18 minutes by rain, 
and then play was halted 1 hour 9 minutes by rain with none out in the Dodgers' 
half of the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the game resumed, there were about 50 people in the stands. If any 
of them were fans of hitting, they didn't miss much. With the Dodgers trailing, 
5-3, and runners on first and second, Carman retired Kal Daniels and Eddie 
Murray on fly-ball outs and then struck out Hubie Brooks to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger reliever Tim Crews gave up three more runs on a couple of walks and 
three singles in the seventh. Carman did not allow another Dodger to reach 
base. His four scoreless innings lowered his ERA to 0.69 through 13 innings. 
Last year he was 5-15 as a starter; this year he has given up only four hits. 
</P>
<P>
Before Friday, Martinez appeared to be headed toward similar low numbers. But 
he said he began the night feeling awkward because he was given only 13 minutes 
warning before the delayed start of the game. He has never pitched after a rain 
delay before. 
</P>
<P>
"I was warmed up, but not like you are when you know what time the game is 
going to start," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
Once he took the mound, with a one-run cushion thanks to Daniels' first-inning 
homer, he looked awkward. Catcher Rick Dempsey ran out for a conference even 
before Martinez's first pitch to discuss the signs. 
</P>
<P>
"We got just a little bit confused," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dempsey, who had two hits in his first start since missing 19 games with 
back spasms: "I give the signs different from Mike Scioscia -- the proper 
signs, but different, and Ramon and I just need to communicate better." 
</P>
<P>
It was the first of three mound meetings in that inning. After Martinez gave up 
a leadoff walk to Len Dykstra and a run-scoring double to Tommy Herr, he was 
visited by pitching coach Ron Perranoski. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me to calm down," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez promptly gave up a run-scoring single to Ricky Jordan, and then John 
Kruk hit a fly ball that eluded a diving Juan Samuel and rolled through the 
left-field gap for a triple. Out ran Dempsey and in came shortstop Alfredo 
Griffin, who appeared to be both scolding and exhorting Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
He allowed a run-scoring grounder to Dickie Thon, and then retired Darren 
Daulton on a grounder to end the inning. By then, he was nearly worn out. He 
had thrown 32 pitches in the inning, nearly half of the 66 total pitches he 
would throw in three innings. 
</P>
<P>
Two innings later, on a 2-and-0 pitch, he allowed Von Hayes' fourth homer, and 
he was finished. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot pitch behind the hitters like that, statistics prove they will hit 
you harder, and that's what Ramon did," Lasorda said. "And age had nothing to 
do with that. Even guys 30 years old do it. And if you do, it's tough to win, 
plain as the nose on your face." 
</P>
<P>
Or in Martinez's case, the egg. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
In his Jim Gott's first rehabilitation assignment, the reliever threw three 
innings, giving up two runs on four hits with one strikeout and two walks while 
pitching Friday for Class-A Bakersfield at San Bernardino. Gott hopes to be 
ready to join the active roster when the team returns from the current trip May 
14. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hamilton will be sidelined for at least six weeks after arthroscopic 
surgery Friday revealed torn cartilage in his shoulder. The Dodger third 
baseman will have to wait at least a month before swinging a bat or throwing a 
ball. The platoon of Lenny Harris and Mike Sharperson will continue to play 
third base. The news of Hamilton's extended absence, not unexpected, gave 
Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda another chance to proclaim that this team will not 
let injuries beat it. "If the fate of this organization rests on one or two 
players, then we're in trouble," he said. "Like I've been telling the players, 
this cannot beat us . . . we can win with those players, and we can win without 
them." Several Dodgers followed Lasorda's enthusiastic lead Friday by taking 
extra, early batting practice even though much of the Veterans Stadium wet 
infield was covered with a tarp. 
</P>
<P>
Orel Hershiser, who underwent shoulder surgery April 27, was discharged Friday 
from Centinela Hospital Medical Center for a second time after being readmitted 
Wednesday because of dehydration caused by a virus. . . . The Dodger bullpen 
received a potential boost Friday with a successful simulated game by Pat 
Perry. The left-handed reliever, recovering from off-season shoulder surgery, 
threw 48 pitches, eight more than scheduled because he felt so good. If he can 
pitch two more good simulated games on this trip, he could be ready for a minor 
league rehabilitation assignment when the team returns home May 14. If all goes 
well, he could join the active roster a week later. "I think he looked great 
for a first time out," said Mark Cresse, bullpen coach. "He showed us a pitch, 
a curveball, that nobody has ever put into his game before. And it was a great 
curveball." Perry, signed as a free agent this winter after going 0-1 with a 
1.77 ERA in 19 games for the Chicago Cubs last season, said his rehabilitation 
has reached a high point. "Three weeks ago, I was beginning to wonder if I 
would ever be ready," he said. "But today, I know I'm getting close." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the cold weather, Kirk Gibson ran in the outfield Friday, and hopes to 
begin taking batting practice by the end of this trip. If so, he could be ready 
to join the roster by the end of May. "It all depends on when I can run hard, 
and I still can't run hard," said Gibson, who had hoped to begin taking batting 
practice during the recent home stand. "I'm beyond being disappointed. I'm just 
working as hard as I can and hopefully something will happen soon." Gibson has 
said that as soon as he begins taking batting practice, he will probably be 
able to play within three weeks.

MORNING BRIEFING: MARINER FANS BELIEVE MOOSE DESERVES NOOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
How bad is Mariner Moose, the mascot of the Seattle Mariners? "He's the worst, 
the worst I've ever seen," said Minnesota Twin pitcher Roy Smith. 
</P>
<P>
At the Kingdome opener, the fans chanted, "Kill the Moose, kill the Moose." 
</P>
<P>
Said Jim Caple of the St. Paul Pioneer Press: "The team is so concerned about 
the Moose's performance, they're planning to send him to Philadelphia to take 
lessons from the Phillie Phanatic. 
</P>
<P>
"Incredible." 
</P>
<P>
Add forgettable quotes: Philadelphia's Charles Barkley was overheard talking to 
his 76er teammates before Game 3 of their NBA playoff series against Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
"Put the saddle on right there," Barkley said, pointing to his back. "Cinch her 
on, and the rest of you guys climb aboard." 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers won, 122-95; Barkley scored 17 points. Cleveland also won Game 4 
to even the series, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
Add Barkley: Claiming that New York Knick guard Mark Jackson has his priorities 
out of order, he said: "Mark Jackson says he loves his fiancee so much he would 
give up basketball for her. Not me. I love my wife (Maureen), but she doesn't 
pay the bills like NBA money can. I'd have to pick John Nash over Maureen." 
</P>
<P>
Nash is the 76er general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What active player has been in the most NBA playoff games? 
</P>
<P>
Overdrafted: Calling them draft day facts, Peter Leo listed the following in 
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "The amount of brainpower spent on draft day by emotionally arrested sports 
fans would be enough to power a dim bulb for an entire day." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Just eliminating one discussion of the NFL draft on one sports talk show 
would keep 500,000 pounds of hot air from being released into the atmosphere 
and contributing to global warming." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "If the newspapers had cut back to only two draft day stories a day, 500 
trees could have been saved." 
</P>
<P>
Add football: From George Will, political columnist, author and baseball lover: 
"Football combines the two worst things about American life. It is violence 
punctuated by committee meetings." 
</P>
<P>
Lighten up: From Ray Frager of the Baltimore Sun: "Wouldn't Rick Barry's 
commentary on TNT during the NBA playoffs be more enjoyable if he wasn't 
whining all the time?" 
</P>
<P>
Call of the wild: Pittsburgh Pirate outfielder Andy Van Slyke, on third baseman 
Jeff King, an avid outdoorsman: "Jeff King is the only baseball player I know 
who would rather have his picture on the cover of Field &amp; Stream than 
Sports Illustrated." 
</P>
<P>
Dim view: General Manager Jack McCloskey of the Detroit Pistons, on 7-foot-2 
Dwayne Schintzius from the University of Florida: "People say he has a lot of 
potential. I don't see it. Yes, he can pass the ball, but I don't see anything 
else. I don't see him run the floor, I don't see him rebound, I don't see him 
block shots, I don't see him shoot the ball, I don't see the competitiveness, I 
don't see the desire to win. I guess that about covers it." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Dennis Johnson, 179 games. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Sacramento King guard Danny Ainge, on his reputation as a 
complainer: "Actually, I'm not a complainer. I'm a whiner." HARLEY TINKHAM

BLACKHAWKS SNAP OILER WIN STREAK

Doug Wilson's tiebreaking goal with 1:59 remaining led the Chicago Blackhawks 
to a 4-3 victory over the Edmonton Oilers Friday night, tying their NHL playoff 
series at a game apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson scored on a wrist shot from the top of the left circle only moments 
after Edmonton goaltender Bill Ranford had robbed Steve Larmer on a shot from 
15 feet out. 
</P>
<P>
Esa Tikkanen attempted to clear the puck after Larmer's shot and it wound up on 
Wilson's stick. The Blackhawks' defenseman wristed a 35-footer past a screened 
Ranford, sending the Campbell Conference series back to Chicago for the third 
and fourth games Sunday and Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The loss broke an eight-game playoff winning streak for the Oilers, who had won 
the opener of this series at the Northlands Coliseum, 5-2, Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Millen, who had a 4-18-4 career record against the Oilers, had never 
played against them in a playoff game before. It was his first appearance in 
the playoffs since losing in the Norris Division finals to St. Louis. Ed 
Belfour had played the last five games for the Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
Millen preserved the victory with 20 seconds remaining when he dove backwards 
to cover Tikkanen's shot in the crease after the puck deflected off Wilson's 
skate and was rolling toward the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the Blackhawks had ever beaten the Oilers in playoff game 
at the Northlands Coliseum, where they are now 1-6. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks took a 1-0 lead when Troy Murray banged in a centering pass from 
Jeremy Roenick on a breakaway at 17:50 of the first period. The play was set up 
on a nice feed from Greg Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
Denis Savard made it 2-0 with a 25-foot slapshot from the slot at 2:02 of the 
second period after the Oilers failed to clear the puck. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers came back with a goal by Glenn Anderson, who scored from the lower 
left circle at 9:49 after taking a pass across the slot from Mark Messier. The 
goal capped a three-on-two break. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Thomas restored Chicago's two-goal lead when he scored from in front on a 
breakaway with Wayne Presley at 17:36. Oiler defenseman Charlie Huddy fell down 
on the play, allowing Thomas a clear shot at Ranford. 
</P>
<P>
A power-play goal by Jari Kurri at 19:01 cut Chicago's lead to 3-2 before the 
end of the second period. Kurri scored from the right circle on the rebound of 
a shot by Esa Tikkanen for his 88th playoff goal, one behind the all-time 
leader, Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers tied it 3-3 on a goal at 2:10 of the third period by Tikkanen, who 
knocked in the rebound of a shot from the right point by Kurri.

Chicago Blackhawk defenseman Doug Wilson had quite a day Friday. And perhaps an 
even better night. 
</P>
<P>
First, he was named one of three finalists for the Norris Trophy, awarded to 
the NHL's best defenseman. Then, on Friday night, he scored the winning goal 
for the Blackhawks in their 4-3 playoff victory over the Edmonton Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been a great day," Wilson said after his goal with 1:59 left tied the 
best-of-seven Campbell Conference finals at 1-1. "We did a little bit of 
soul-searching, and I think we played the way we wanted to play tonight. It's 
nice to be going back home with a split." 
</P>
<P>
The series resumes with Games 3 and 4 on Sunday and Tuesday nights in Chicago. 
It was the first time the Blackhawks had won a playoff game in Northlands 
Coliseum, where they were 0-6 going into Friday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson scored on a wrist shot from the left point. His goal followed a turnover 
by Esa Tikkanen to Denis Savard, who finished with a goal and two assists after 
complaining about being benched for a good portion of Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
"Denis Savard is one of the best team players I've ever played with," Wilson 
said. "He's got as much character as anybody and he's got an awful lot of 
pride." 
</P>
<P>
Tikkanen was the beneficiary of a turnover by Savard earlier in the third 
period, converting Jari Kurri's rebound to tie the score, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
Troy Murray and Steve Thomas also scored for Chicago, and Glenn Anderson, Kurri 
and Tikkanen had goals for the Oilers, whose eight-game playoff winning streak 
was snapped two short of the NHL record. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton Coach John Muckler said he thought the Oilers would win the game after 
they came back to tie the score in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
"After he (Tikkanen) got the goal in the third, we came on strong and had 
several good chances," he said. "Standing behind the bench, I thought we would 
win. 
</P>
<P>
"But we wound up making the mistake that lost the game." 
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks started slowly but came on midway through the first period to 
get their forechecking game going. Murray shed Mark Messier's check to convert 
Jeremy Roenick's centering pass at 17:50. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks haven't lost in all six playoff games in which they have scored 
first. 
</P>
<P>
Savard made it 2-0 at 2:02 of the second period when he took Dirk Graham's pass 
in the slot and beat Bill Ranford between the pads. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers, outshot 11-0 by the Blackhawks in a stretch of about seven minutes 
early in the period, scored with Anderson's goal after a nice passing sequence 
with Messier. 
</P>
<P>
It was Messier's 113th career playoff assist, leaving him second only to former 
teammate Wayne Gretzky on the all-time NHL list. 
</P>
<P>
Kurri's goal was his 88th in playoff competition, leaving him one behind 
Gretzky on the all-time list.

 I wish to clarify a statement Mike Reilley made in his story about baseball 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
While the Dodger Stadium cafeteria does have a varied menu and decent food, the 
ushers will allow only fans sitting in the expensive seats access to it. 
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the stadium has only one real food choice -- hot dogs that are 
burned on the outside and cold on the inside. I have been to more than a dozen 
stadiums, and Dodger Stadium ranks near the bottom in quality and is without 
question at the bottom in variety. 
</P>

An organization that draws 3 million people each year should do more for their 
fans.

EAST GERMAN PRO WINS THE 95.3-MILE FIRST STAGE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Olaf Ludwig, one of only six East German professional athletes, surged in the 
final 100 yards Friday and claimed the accident-marred Wilmington-to-Baltimore 
Road Race, the first stage of the Tour de Trump bicycle race. 
</P>
<P>
Ludwig, 30, winner of the 1988 Olympic road-race gold medal, covered 95.3-mile 
course in 3 hours 50 minutes 19 seconds on an overcast day. 
</P>
<P>
His margin of victory was about half a bike length. 
</P>
<P>
"With 200 meters left, I didn't believe I would win," Ludwig said via an 
interpreter. "But the wind was strong, so it was hard for everyone to sprint." 
</P>
<P>
Davis Phinney of Boulder, Colo., who won the stage last year in a photo finish, 
placed second. Michael Zanoli, a native of the Netherlands who also lives in 
Boulder, placed third. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Hugo Olarte of Colombia collided with Canadian amateur Sean Way about 62 
miles into the race. Olarte, who fell on his head and was unconscious for 
several minutes, was taken to the Maryland Trauma Center by helicopter. Way was 
able to continue the race. A medical coordinator said it's believed Olarte 
suffered a first- or second-degree concussion. 
</P>
<P>
Raul Alcala of Mexico, the winner of Thursday's prologue, finished 22nd but 
maintained his overall race lead by six seconds over Ludwig. 
</P>
<P>
Tour de France winner Greg LeMond finished 112th and is 75th overall, 31 
seconds behind the leader. 
</P>
<P>
The second stage of the 1,107-mile, 11-day race, the 35-mile Baltimore 
Criteroum, was scheduled for later Friday night.

ERRION REMEMBERED AS COACH AND FRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I knew Jack Errion for 18 years as my boss, as a coach and most of all as a 
friend. Though a quiet, rather shy man, Jack had a great influence on quite a 
number of people. 
</P>
<P>
He was an intense competitor during a basketball game. His many assistants over 
the years, myself included, were more than once the recipient of a flying elbow 
to the ribs from Jack, accompanied with the exclamation, "Did you see that?" or 
"How could he do that?" or "How can they call that?" 
</P>
<P>
Jack was always seeking perfection from his teams in an imperfect game (world). 
One of his favorite phrases was -- "Let's go over it again!" I heard that said 
countless times, in scouting meetings, practices or pregame meetings. 
</P>
<P>
His philosophy was, just like the man, simple and direct. He would always say 
he wanted "to get 'em (his team) to play better than they think they can." His 
1975 St. Anthony's High School and his 1980 Corona del Mar teams were 
outstanding examples of his philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of his successes, Jack was always generous with his time, especially 
with younger, inexperienced coaches. He would patiently listen to any question 
asked of him and then quietly give his own opinion to the questioner. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, Jack was buried in a simple ceremony in Tucson. He left this world as 
he lived it -- quiet and unassuming. I will miss him. Even though he is gone 
now, his spirit and philosophy will live on in those of us that he touched.

Olaf Ludwig, one of six cyclists who recently became East Germany's first 
professional athletes, won both stages of the Tour de Trump bicycle race Friday 
and moved into the lead by four seconds over Raul Alcala of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
First, Ludwig, 30, winner of the 1988 Olympic road-race gold medal, won the 
95.3-mile race from Wilmington, Del., to Baltimore in 3 hours 50 minutes 19 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Then Friday night, riding on a 28.9-mile course wet by a strong afternoon rain, 
Ludwig sprinted out of a large pack and claimed the Baltimore Criterium by a 
bike length in 59 minutes 46 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Alcala, who won Thursday's prologue, leads third-place Bauer by one second in 
the standings. 
</P>
<P>
Reigning Tour de France champion Greg LeMond of Wayzata, Minn., finished 112th 
in the road race and 103rd in the criterium. He is in 72nd place in the 
131-rider field, 35 seconds behind the leader. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Olarte of Colombia collided with Canadian amateur Sean Way about 62 
miles into the first race, fell on his head and was unconscious for several 
minutes. He was taken to the Maryland Shock Trauma Center by helicopter with a 
broken wrist and a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
Another crash during the first stage involved 15 riders, but only Mario Chisea 
of Italy was unable to continue. He was not seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
The third and four stages of the 1,107-mile race are scheduled for today in 
Virginia. The event concludes May 13 in Boston.

in the fifth inning Friday after a bench-clearing, five-minute brawl. 
</P>
<P>
There were no serious injuries or arrests in the fight between the two West 
Coast Conference teams, according to officials. 
</P>
<P>
But several players on both squads suffered facial cuts and bruises and some 
fights broke out between spectators in the parking lot, according to campus 
police officers. 
</P>
<P>
The two teams had been scheduled to complete their season series today at 11 
a.m. in a doubleheader, but USD Coach John Cunningham told a reporter from the 
Reno Gazette-Journal that the Toreros would forfeit. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolf Pack was leading, 3-1, when the fight started. 
</P>
<P>
The brawl began after a USD player rammed his knee into a Nevada Reno player, 
who responded by slapping his face, according to the host team. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham said players "came out of both dugouts with the intent of hurting 
someone. In 28 years of coaching, I've seen fights, but nope, nothing ever like 
this." 
</P>
<P>
Said Nevada Reno Coach Gary Powers: "There's no excuse for what took place 
here. It was an ugly, ugly incident that should not have happened." 
</P>
<P>
The teams had played three previous games this season, with USD winning two. 
USD entered the game 23-29, 15-15 in the WCC. Nevada Reno was 26-20 and 8-12.

KNICKS FORCE GAME 5 WITH CELTICS

<P>
The Garden party continued for the home team in the opening-round playoff 
series between the New York Knicks and Boston Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Ewing scored 44 points Friday night as New York forced a deciding Game 
5 with a 135-108 victory at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised at the margin of victory more than anything else," Coach Stu 
Jackson said after the Knicks set playoff records for points in a game and a 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Game 5 will be Sunday at Boston Garden, where the Celtics won the first two 
games of the series, including a 157-128 victory Saturday, and have beaten the 
Knicks 26 consecutive times since Feb. 29, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way to end their home-court advantage is to win the game," Jackson 
said. "We hung our heads a little bit the last time we were in Boston. I don't 
think that will happen Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
Said Celtic Coach Jimmy Rodgers: "We had our turn at being embarrassed. We've 
played great in Boston, and they rose to the challenge at New York. Now we have 
to counterpunch at home." 
</P>
<P>
Ewing was 18 of 24 from the field and fell two points short of Bernard King's 
team single-game playoff scoring record. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that right from the opening tip we did a great job keeping the tempo 
to our advantage," said Ewing, who also had 13 rebounds and a career-high seven 
of New York's 18 steals. "We played excellent pressure defense." 
</P>
<P>
That defense forced the Celtics into 26 turnovers, and the Knicks had 13, 
giving New York a 47-19 turnover advantage in the two games at Madison Square 
Garden. 
</P>
<P>
Celtic forwards Larry Bird and Kevin McHale both said the turnovers were the 
biggest factor in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We played very badly, not in sync at all," Bird said. "Our passes were thrown 
one way when a guy was going the other. The margin of victory doesn't really 
matter, only that you got beat. The home court usually means a lot in the NBA, 
but if we turn the ball over like this again, we can lose again." 
</P>
<P>
Said McHale: "If we stay this sloppy with the ball, anything can happen. We had 
26 turnovers and they scored 46 points off those turnovers. It was not a banner 
day for the Boston Celtics." 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks led by eight points at halftime, then took control by starting the 
third quarter with a 27-17 run for a 92-74 lead. The Celtics got no closer than 
11 after that and trailed by as many as 37 in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
McHale scored 24 points, Reggie Lewis 23 and Bird 21 for Boston. Johnny Newman 
had 24 points and Gerald Wilkins 20 for New York. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing made his first eight shots and scored 20 points on nine-of-11 shooting in 
the first quarter, carrying New York to a 36-30 lead. Ewing scored the Knicks' 
first 10 points in the opening 2:33. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics held Ewing to four points in the second quarter. A 15-6 run gave 
the Celtics the lead, 45-42, with 8:47 remaining in the half. 
</P>
<P>
But Maurice Cheeks scored seven points and Newman had six during a 21-8 run 
that gave the Knicks a 63-53 lead. New York led at halftime, 65-57. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks will try to become the third team to come back from a 2-0 deficit to 
win a best-of-five series. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks' previous mark for points in a playoff game was 132.

CAL LUTHERAN BREEZES TO THIRD TITLE IN A ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A gusty wind was blowing in at Cal Lutheran's Gibello Field on Friday, but that 
didn't stop the Regals from blowing Cal Baptist out of the NAIA District 3 
softball championships. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran had six consecutive hits in a four-run fifth inning that broke a 
scoreless tie and gave the Regals a 4-0 second-game victory and a sweep of the 
best-of-three series. 
</P>
<P>
After winning the first game, 5-1, Cal Lutheran clinched its third consecutive 
District 3 title with its big fifth inning in the second game. 
</P>
<P>
The outburst was sparked by an out rather than a hit. After Cal Lutheran's Kim 
White was called out on a close play at third, Leslie Stevens immediately 
followed with a triple to right center that scored Dani Piotrowski with what 
turned out to be the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just mad they called Kim White out. I couldn't believe that," Stevens 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens scored on Cheryl Aschenbach's subsequent double, and DeeAndra 
Pilkington followed with a run-scoring triple. Alysa Mathews then singled in 
Pilkington to complete the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't get us mad," Cal Lutheran Coach Tony Venditto said. "We play with a 
lot of emotion, and that was one of the things we were lacking." 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran (31-10-2) has won 19 of its last 20 games, but Venditto believes 
his team has been emotionally flat since spring break. Cal Lutheran won a 
ho-hum first game on Pilkington's four-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
"They came in on a real high," Venditto said of Cal Baptist (23-24). "Our goal 
the first game is to shut them down." 
</P>
<P>
Stevens (13-4), who has won her last 10 decisions, threw a two-hitter for Cal 
Lutheran, which is now one round away from making its third trip in a row to 
the NAIA nationals. The Regals play next week in the bi-district tournament 
against the winner of the District 7 championships. 
</P>
<P>
In the first game, Pilkington (16-6) struck out six and allowed only one 
unearned run. The Regals led, 1-0, after four innings and scored four runs in 
the fifth, the key hit a two-run single by Mathews. 
</P>
<P>
White finished the day six for eight off freshman right-hander Amy Dawson 
(14-12), who started and lost both games. 
</P>
<P>
With the sweep, Cal Lutheran avoided a potential third game that had been 
scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to play them (today) at all," Venditto said. "We kept stressing 
all week there's only two games."

PACIFIC COAST LEAGUE MEET;

WOODBRIDGE DOMINATES TEAM RACES

The Woodbridge High School boys' and girls' teams won titles at the Pacific 
Coast League track and field finals Friday at Irvine High School. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' meet, Woodbridge placed first with 254 points and Laguna Hills 
was second with 80. Costa Mesa was third with 57 points. 
</P>
<P>
Seniors Michelle Muniz and Kaci Keffer each won two individual events. Muniz 
won the 100-meter dash in 12.6 seconds, beating a hard-charging Tenaya Johnson 
of Laguna Hills, who finished in 12.7. Woodbridge's Kristina Lockwood was third 
in 12.7. 
</P>
<P>
Her victory was remarkable because Lockwood flew out of the starting blocks and 
had a three- meter lead with 50 meters left. That didn't faze Muniz, however. 
She made up the difference in the last 30 meters. 
</P>
<P>
But Muniz came back to win the 200 in 25.9 with Johnson second in 26.3. 
Earlier, Muniz participated in Woodbridge's 400 relay, which won in a meet 
record 49.0, breaking the team's record of 49.3 set in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, an obviously tired Muniz ran the second leg of the 1,600 relay. The 
Woodbridge team of Muniz, Mindy Hawley, Amy Robles won in 4:06.2, followed by 
Orange in 4:14.5. 
</P>
<P>
Keffer, who has run one of the top 400 times in the nation, easily won the 400 
(56.5) and the 300 hurdles (45.4) in addition to running on both relays. 
</P>
<P>
In the boys' team results, Woodbridge won with 157 points to Orange's 95. 
Laguna Hills was third with 84. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Smith of Woodbridge broke the long jump meet record with a leap of 23 
feet, exceeding his record of 22-7 set in 1988. Smith also dueled with Laguna 
Hills' Dave Childs in the sprints. Smith won the 100 in 11.1 in a photo finish 
over Childs, who ran the same time. However, Childs won the 200 in 22.3, with 
Smith second (22.4). 
</P>
<P>
Craig Riggs of Laguna Hills was also impressive in the hurdles, winning the 110 
(14.9) and 300 hurdles (40.0). Laguna Beach's Phil Bently won the 1,600 in 
4:27.9, holding off Chris Lynch of Laguna Hills (4:30.8), who won the 3,200 in 
9:55.2.

A RUN PROVES ENOUGH FOR FILLMORE'S CHESSANI; 
</P>
<P>
PREP BASEBALL: 1-0 VICTORY OVER ST. BONAVENTURE FORCES TIE FOR TRI-VALLEY 
LEAGUE LEAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Clarion calls of "Let's rope this guy!" resounded from both dugouts throughout 
Friday's Tri-Valley League baseball showdown between Fillmore and St. 
Bonaventure highs. 
</P>
<P>
But senior right-handers Anthony Chessani of Fillmore and Kevin Zoll of host 
St. Bonaventure were oblivious to any chants. 
</P>
<P>
Chessani and Zoll -- each with a shutout victory over the other team this 
season -- traded strikeouts and scoreless innings into the late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Chessani emerged on top, hurling a nine-inning two-hitter with 10 
strikeouts as Fillmore eked out a 1-0 victory in the season's rubber match 
between the schools. 
</P>
<P>
The win moved Fillmore (15-3, 11-2 in league play) into a first-place tie with 
St. Bonaventure (12-7, 11-2) with two games remaining. Should the teams finish 
as co-champions, Fillmore, by virtue of its two victories over St. Bonaventure, 
would enter the Southern Section playoffs as the league's top-seeded team. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I was getting stronger and stronger," said Chessani (7-1). "That 
one run put more into me. Every time we huddled, I said to the guys, 'Just get 
one run because I'm not going to let them score.' " 
</P>
<P>
Chessani, who blanked St. Bonaventure, 4-0, earlier this season, closed five 
innings with strikeouts. He gave up his first hit in the fourth and didn't 
allow another until Zoll's two-out single in the ninth. The game ended four 
pitches later when Zoll, on his way to second base, was struck by a ball off 
the bat of Chris Borchard. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a great fastball," St. Bonaventure Coach Dennis Johnson said of 
Chessani. "He's the hardest thrower in the league." 
</P>
<P>
Zoll (7-3), who pitched a no-hitter against Fillmore three weeks ago, struck 
out six and gave up seven hits. Fillmore threatened, putting a runner at third 
in the second, third, fourth and sixth, but Zoll escaped each threat. 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth, Mike Thompson tagged Zoll for a one-out triple. After an infield 
pop out, Alex Sandoval drove in the run with a ground ball into right field. 
</P>
<P>
"We were playing him up the middle," Zoll said. "If I didn't hang (the pitch), 
he would have hit it up the middle. But you can't second-guess a 1-0 game."

LISA LESLIE SLAM DUNKS SAT ON HER THIRD TRY; 
</P>
<P>
PREP BASKETBALL: MORNINGSIDE STAR GAINS FRESHMAN ELIGIBILITY. ALSO AN HONOR 
STUDENT, SHE CALLS TEST 'BIASED.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Lisa Leslie, the third try at the Scholastic Aptitude Test proved to be the 
charm. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside High's highly recruited center learned last week that after two 
failed attempts she scored better than 700 points on the SAT, making her 
eligible to play collegiate basketball as a freshman next fall. 
</P>
<P>
But the 6-foot-5 Leslie, an honor student who carries a 3.5 grade-point 
average, was still unsatisfied with her 750 score. Echoing what others have 
charged, Leslie said the SAT is "biased" against minority students because it 
does not cover what they have learned in high school. 
</P>
<P>
"The test is basically biased, as far as I'm concerned," she said. "We should 
all learn the same things. It shouldn't differ as to what area you live in. In 
a way, it's like segregation. Not everyone is fortunate enough to live in Palos 
Verdes." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if her education at Morningside has failed to properly prepare her for 
college, Leslie said: "I know I'm not in the worst education situation, but I 
know it's not the highest either. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of what's on the SAT, we haven't covered in our everyday learning. It 
might be because of our books. We have books that the school was using years 
ago. It's kind of unfair, because we're not all provided with the same 
materials."

SEA VIEW LEAGUE MEET; 
</P>
<P>
PRICE HELPS SADDLEBACK RACE PAST CORONA DEL MAR TO TAKE BOYS' TITLE

The last time Saddleback High School's Robby Price attempted to run three races 
in one track meet, he ended up with a stress facture in his foot and a painful 
lesson. Because of his efforts in a dual meet last year, Price had to spend the 
rest of his junior track season watching from the stands. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, at the Sea View League championships at Rancho Santiago College, Price 
tried another triple. This time, though, he came away healthy and with three 
first-place finishes. 
</P>
<P>
Price won the 3,200, the 800 and the 1,600 -- with times of 9 minutes 48.3 
seconds, 1:59.5 and 4:27.4, respectively -- to help lead Saddleback to the 
boys' team title. 
</P>
<P>
The Roadrunners, who entered the meet with a 5-0 league record, won their first 
Sea View League title with 143 1/2 points. Three-time defending league champion 
Corona del Mar was second with 90 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't won a league title in nine years," said Saddleback Coach Jim Knapp, 
who in his 20 years at Saddleback has competed in several leagues. "We've just 
done well across the line -- in the field events, the sprints, and our distance 
runners have been good since September." 
</P>
<P>
Price led the way from the start Friday. In the 3,200, the race in which Price 
said he will concentrate on in the Southern Section preliminaries next week, 
Price led a Saddleback sweep, and ran in the 800 and 1,600 in order to ensure 
his team the title. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed the points for the team," said Price, a senior with a 4.8 
grade-point average. "I hadn't planned on running the (800), but I knew we 
needed it." 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' competition, Corona del Mar won the team title with 137 points, 
edging Newport Harbor, second with 126. Coming into the meet, Corona del Mar, 
Newport Harbor and University were in a three-way tie for first, but the Sea 
Kings managed plenty of fine performances from their regular contributors and a 
few pleasant surprises. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar received only two victories -- Jill Young won the 400 (58.4) and 
the 300 hurdles (44.5) -- but had the needed depth. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have any catastrophes, and there were some nice surprises," Corona 
del Mar Coach Tom Cheese said. "I figured it would be between us and Newport. I 
thought we'd win by between five and 20 points." 
</P>
<P>
In the boys' sprints, Corona del Mar's Mark Barnum defended his league titles 
in the 100- and 400-meter dashes. But after review of the meet videotape, 
Barnum will have to share the 100-meter title with Saddleback's Jarrett 
Murrell, who tied Barnum with a time of 10.7. 
</P>
<P>
Murrell, a sophomore, and Barnum, a senior, also were given the same time in 
the 200 -- 22.5 -- but Murrell was declared the winner. 
</P>
<P>
University's Carolyn Griffin won the 100 (12.5) and 200 (26.2), and teammate 
Tanja Brix won the 3,200 (11:25.6) and the 1,600 (5:13.6). Tustin's Marceia 
Fogg won both the girls' long jump (16-10) and the triple jump (36-1), as did 
Estancia's Mike Aulet (22-0 1/4 and 44-1) in the boys' competition. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia's Christie Howard bettered the school record in the high jump by two 
inches to win at 5 feet 6 inches.

Jim Firsich of Port Hueneme won both the Street Stock and figure-eight main 
events at Ventura Raceway on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Griffin of Oxnard led the tightly contested 15-lap Street Stock main event 
until the final turn. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin, Don Green of Ventura and Dave Hume of Ventura all tangled high in Turn 
4 and Firsich cut underneath the careening cars to beat Griffin by a car 
length. Hume was third. 
</P>
<P>
Firsich moved within 10 points of the figure-eight season points leader, John 
Csorba of Oxnard, with a much easier victory in the 12-lap figure-eight main 
event. 
</P>
<P>
Firsich led wire-to-wire as Csorba missed the race because of a broken rear 
axle on his Monte Carlo. 
</P>
<P>
The break was sustained in an earlier heat race. 
</P>
<P>
Cory Kruseman of Ventura won his second consecutive 12-lap Mini-Stock 
figure-eight main event.

When Kennedy High Coach Manny Alvarado asked Garret Anderson to take extra

After all, Fresno State-bound Anderson entered the week batting .385. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Why, I'm not in a slump.' " Alvarado said. "And I said, 'You're not 
in a groove, either.' He knows what a groove is now." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson slammed three home runs Friday -- including a game-winning solo shot 
in the bottom of the seventh -- to lead Kennedy to a 16-15 win over Cleveland 
in a North Valley League game at Kennedy.

With Chatsworth (18-5-1, 10-4-1) trailing, 11-10, in the seventh, Mike Mancuso

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The powers that be seeded Keri Phebus of Corona del Mar High School eighth in 
the 18-and-under division of the Seventeen Magazine Tennis Tournament of 
Champions. 
</P>
<P>
Phebus, top-ranked nationally in the 16s and the tournament's defending 16s 
champion, didn't know several of the players seeded ahead of her. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't complaining," she said. "It made me the underdog, so I don't mind." 
</P>
<P>
It seemed a curious move when the tournament began Wednesday. Now, it seems 
stranger still. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Phebus will play in the 18s final at 1 p.m. at the Marguerite Recreation 
Center in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
To reach the final, Phebus had to beat the second- and fourth-seeded players 
Friday. No. 2 Christine Neuman of Downers Grove, Ill., lost, 6-3, 6-4, in the 
quarterfinals Friday morning. In the semifinals later in the day, Kristin 
Osmond of Worthington, Ohio, couldn't match Phebus' patient game plan and lost, 
6-4, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Phebus will meet Jennifer Baker of Wesley Chapel, Ohio, who defeated Jennifer 
Nasser of Arlington Heights, Ill., 3-6, 6-2, 7-6, in the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
Against Osmond, an 18-year-old senior at Worthington High who will attend the 
University of Florida in the fall, Phebus fell behind, 2-0, in the first set 
and 3-0 in the second. 
</P>
<P>
Phebus, who turned 16 Wednesday, said she was never worried. 
</P>
<P>
"I always play better when I'm behind," said Phebus, who has won back-to-back 
Southern Section singles titles. "It's my personality. I'm more of a fighter." 
</P>
<P>
It sounds like an odd approach, but it worked. 
</P>
<P>
Her serve, strong though it may be, wasn't particularly effective against 
Osmond. Phebus had just three aces. 
</P>
<P>
She rarely came to the net, letting her cross-court volleys make up most of her 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
Osmond gained her early advantages by coming to the net when she could and 
pounding the ball back at Phebus. No matter the score, Phebus seemed content to 
stay on the baseline, hammering groundstroke after groundstroke while waiting 
for Osmond to make a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"All she does is get everything back," Osmond said. "She's so consistent. I was 
up 3-0 (in the second set) and I was pounding the ball. I can't play like that 
the whole match." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, too many unforced errors and steady, patient play by Phebus cost 
her a spot in the final, Osmond said. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have done what she did (stay at the baseline), but the match would 
have lasted five hours," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Tournament Notes 
</P>
<P>
In the 16s semifinals, Ditta Huber of La Jolla defeated Amy Chiminello of 
Melrose, Mass., 4-6, 6-1, 6-2, and Jill Craybas of East Greenwich, R.I., beat 
Wendy Sacks of Memphis, Tenn., 6-3, 6-1. Huber plays Craybas in today's final 
at 11:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
In the 14s semifinals, Lindsay Davenport of Palos Verdes advanced to the final 
by beating Anne Miller of Midland, Mich., 6-2, 7-6. Janet Lee of Palos Verdes 
defeated Maggie Cole of Santa Cruz, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2. Davenport and Lee meet in 
the 10 a.m. final.

Poway's Matt Sanders entered Friday's Palomar League showdown with Mt. Carmel 
batting .056, but it was his three-run home run that sparked a 10-9 upset over 
the No. 2 Sundevils. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders was the team's designated hitter only because senior Frank Wolinski 
came down with the flu Friday morning. Coincidentally, Sanders had hit a 
three-run homer in Thursday's practice to give the juniors a 6-5 victory over 
the seniors.

But his drive over the left field fence in the third inning was for real and 
breathed new life into Poway, which needed some quick resuscitation after Mt. 
Carmel's six-run third inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Sundevils had taken a 7-1 lead into the bottom of the inning but entered 
the fourth still in a game, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
A big third-inning defensive play by right fielder Greg Sorrell also helped the 
Titans win. Sorrell threw out Andy Owen at home to end Mt. Carmel's six-run 
rally. Owen was trying to score from second on John Moon's single, the eighth 
hit of the inning for the Sundevils. 
</P>
<P>
That one run made the difference. 
</P>
<P>
The victory went to reliever Danny Miller (9-1), who pitched the sixth and 
seventh innings. He struck out three and got an exceptional defensive effort 
from first baseman Robbie Plarski with runners on first and second to end it. 
Moon and Andy Panganiban were aboard on infield hits when Plarski reached over 
the six-foot fence up to his elbow and snared Armando Sanchez's foul ball for 
the final out. 
</P>
<P>
Plarski also doubled off the fence in the fourth inning to drive home a run 
that cut Mt. Carmel's lead to 9-7, then drove home the game-winner in the sixth 
with a double to right center field. 
</P>
<P>
The winning rally began with Sorrell's walk and a wild pitch by loser Todd 
Voigt (0-1). Matt Schwenke followed with his third single, which scored Sorrell 
to tie it at 9-9, then went to second on the throw home. Plarski broke the tie. 
</P>
<P>
The victory pulled No. 10 Poway (15-6-1, 6-3) and Rancho Buena Vista within two 
games of Mt. Carmel (19-4, 9-1) and virtually assured the Titans a playoff 
spot. 
</P>
<P>

</P>

NERVES WORK FOR KOHLER THIS TIME;

<P>
TENNIS: PLAYER FROM CARMEL DEFEATS LA JOLLAN LIZ HARPER TO ADVANCE TO WOMEN'S 
60S SEMIFINALS IN NATIONAL HARDCOURT. THE RESULT WAS THE REVERSE OF A MEETING 
LAST WEEK IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TOURNAMENT.

<P>
Nervousness can work in strange ways. It can take over mind and body, 
prohibitting an athlete from reaching full potential. Or it can provide extra 
energy that enhances performance. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, when Carmel's Marjorie Kohler lost to Liz Harper of La Jolla in the 
women's 60s final of the Northern California Sectional tennis tournament in 
Carmel, she said nervousness was a contributing factor. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, Kohler defeated Harper, 6-1, 6-1, in the quarterfinals of the women's 
60s singles in the U.S. National Hardcourt Championships at the La Jolla Beach 
and Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
Harper was the only San Diegan remaining in either the 50s or 60s singles. 
</P>
<P>
"I get nervous before my matches," Kohler said. "In Carmel, it worked against 
me. This time, it worked for me. Maybe you should call it super-concentration 
instead of nervousness. It takes a lot of concentration not to think. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of buildup between Carmel and here. I was ready and waiting to 
get back." 
</P>
<P>
No. 1-seeded Kohler said she thought Friday's match would be fairly even but 
then went out and won the first four games. 
</P>
<P>
Kohler will play No. 5 Ellie McPhail of Denver in today's semifinals. McPhail 
defeated Elaine Mason of Fresno, 6-2, 6-3, to advance. In the other 60s 
semifinal, No. 2 Nancy Neeld of Albuquerque will play No. 3 Kathy Rothfels of 
Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
Kohler, in her first year in the 60s, is playing in tournaments again after a 
year-long break. She became "disenchanted" with the sport and found that it 
"just wasn't fun any more". 
</P>
<P>
But a new year brought a new attitude, and now even too much tennis is not 
enough for Kohler. 
</P>
<P>
"This year I told my husband I was going to go for it and start playing 
tournaments again," Kohler said. "Now I can't get enough of it." 
</P>
<P>
Kohler also advanced to today's doubles semifinals. Kohler and Peggy Landtroop 
of Dallas defeated Mason and McPhail, 6-2, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Kohler and Landtroop met in Carmel earlier this year while Landtroop was 
visiting from Dallas. Landtroop's regular partner was ill, and two of Kohler's 
friends suggested they team up for a social match. They have been partners 
since and are playing in their second tournament together. 
</P>
<P>
Kohler said their distance hasn't caused a problem and that their styles mesh. 
</P>
<P>
"We get along so well," Kohler said. "We have melded our games and complement 
each other." 
</P>
<P>
In women's 50s singles semifinals today, top-seeded Dorothy Matthiessen of 
Pasadena will play No. 3 Arlene Cohen of Orinda, and Pat Cody of Whittier will 
play Susan Anawalt of Monte Serreno. Matthiessen defeated Annabelle Belknap of 
West Hills, 6-0, 6-3; Cohen defeated Carol Wood of Rockville, Md., 3-6, 6-2, 
6-3; Cody beat Peggy Omohundro of Franklin, Tenn., 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, and Anawalt 
defeated Lorna Brooks of Exeter, 6-2, 6-0, in the quarterfinals.

FACES . . . : 'GUARDIAN'S' GARDENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STACY JENEL SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It wasn't her background in classical theater that equipped Jenny Seagrove to 
play the title role in William Friedkin's new horror film, "The Guardian." It 
wasn't her experience with Shakespeare and Ibsen, her work in Laurence 
Olivier's Chichester Festival Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
According to Seagrove, what prepared her for the part -- a nanny with the nasty 
habit of sacrificing babies to a tree inhabited by a malevolent spirit -- was 
gardening. 
</P>
<P>
"I have immense sympathy for trees," says the actress with a 
not-altogether-joking earnestness in her voice. "I really believe that they 
have got feelings . . . I've actually put my arms around them and hugged them. 
But then I'm dotty about plants and animals. I just love them." 
</P>
<P>
The nudity required in her role -- and there is a lot of it -- was more 
difficult. "It was the first time I did nudity in a film," she notes. "But I 
thought, 'Well, it's integral to the part. Get on and do it.' Since other 
members of the cast had to do something nude at some point in time, we had a 
kind of camaraderie about it: 'Hey, it's your turn today, tee-hee.' " 
</P>
<P>
Born in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the daughter of an import-export dealer, 
Seagrove "moved around the Far East until I was 9 and was sent to an English 
boarding school." After graduating, she went on to three years of study at 
Bristol's distinguished Old Vic Theatre School, then two years of study work in 
the theater, before David Puttnam tapped her for the leading female role in his 
acclaimed 1983 film, "Local Hero." 
</P>
<P>
Working with director Friedkin was the key attraction in taking her "The 
Guardian" role, she says. But while she's a fan of Friedkin's, she's not a 
lover of the horror genre as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm too much of a coward to go to horror films. I get frightened easily and I 
have nightmares afterward. I hate to admit that, because I should really say, 
'Everybody must go see our film.' But it's true." STACY JENEL SMITH

FACES . . . : PATON GETS FOCUSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEVON O'BRIEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"My mind got so stimulated!" says actress Angela Paton of creating four 
characters at once for "50/60 Vision," 13 plays in repertory at The Mark Taper 
Forum. "I was constantly having to focus my mind in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
Paton appears in "The American Dream" and "The Sandbox," both by Edward Albee, 
and in Harold Pinter's "A Slight Ache"; her off-stage voice pervades "Eh Joe" 
by Samuel Beckett. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be thinking of something from 'Eh Joe,' " says the actress, "And I'd say, 
'No, no, no! I'm supposed to be thinking about 'The Sandbox.' So I'd think 
about 'Sandbox' and then a great idea would come in for 'A Slight Ache'!" 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, there are links between characters; between Flora and Mrs. Barker and 
the Voice and Mommy. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, all the characters are asking," says Paton, " 'What does it all 
mean?' That's the question that's pretty important to people." 
</P>
<P>
Paton, who was born in Brooklyn, has been an actress since she was 16 years 
old; she's the mother of three children and a theater -- she founded the 
Berkeley Stage Company in 1974 and ran it for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Since relocating to Los Angeles four years ago, Paton has done Chekhov at the 
Los Angeles Theater Center, and Shakespeare at the South Coast Repertory. She's 
featured with Winona Ryder in the upcoming film "Welcome Home, Roxie 
Carmichael." And she's done spots on TV series such as "The Wonder Years" and 
"thirtysomething." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to get into the television-movie thing," Paton says. "They tend to 
cast the known person, the name. It's a hard cycle to break. I'm just beginning 
to now." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Paton calls her run at the Taper "a dream." 
</P>
<P>
"These plays are really little classics. They're little gems of genius. They're 
mysterious. It's like trying to discover the answer to being. You think you 
have the answer and then, it slips away." DEVON O'BRIEN

REMOVING LENNON PHOTO FROM EXHIBIT A HUGE MISTAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hats off to curator Norman Lloyd, whose intelligent curating would attempt to 
educate and revise the rigid images of a public that may in any event continue 
down the "heroic" road to cultural destitution. 
</P>
<P>
Board chairwoman Beverly Gunter's obtuse reading of the Lennon-Ono image is 
typical of those who reactively and unwisely attempt to remove from the public 
view anything that makes them uncomfortable or challenges their assumptions 
about the natural order of things. 
</P>
<P>
Lennon's respect for woman is profoundly heroic -- that's what makes the 
photograph so extraordinary, and what makes him a hero. If we allow trustees 
and government representatives to make decisions like the one Gunter 
threatened, we lose all hope of revisioning our past or creating our future 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
Art like the Lennon-Ono photograph in the hands of board trustees like Gunter 
threatens the very power of creation in the modern world. We must continue to 
fund art, and to invite a profusion of images to vie equally for our attention 
and instruction.

REVIEW ATTACKS YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Randy Lewis' article on comedians Sam Kinison and Andrew (Dice) Clay ("Hate 
Mongers Are a Bad Chapter in the History of Comedy," April 22) was an 
opinionated, narrow-minded, malicious attack on not only these comedians but 
also the youth of America. 
</P>
<P>
Just because he doesn't like their style of comedy, that does not give him the 
right to condemn those who do. 
</P>
<P>
The young people of America are not "imbecilic" or "easily brainwashed" into 
following a persona (as the older generation was when they supported Reagan's 
supply-side economics). We are just into something else, something different. 
Every generation is different from the next; it's been like that in the past 
and will continue to be like that in the future! 
</P>
<P>
So, Mr. Lewis, I am sorry if my generation does not idolize your Woody Allen or 
Lenny Bruce (as you would like). But you cannot ignore change or "pray that it 
will go away," because it will not (whether you like it or not).

REMOVING LENNON PHOTO FROM EXHIBIT A HUGE MISTAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like a mythological Hydra -- cut off one head and two more grow -- censorship 
is increasing apace. The most recent local example (at least in appearance but 
contradicted by a museum spokeswoman) is the removal, and subsequent return, of 
a photo depicting a naked, fetal-curled John Lennon lying next to a clothed 
Yoko Ono, which had been selected for an art exhibit at the Muckenthaler 
Cultural Center in Fullerton. ("Nude Photo of Lennon Removed in Fullerton," 
April 25.) 
</P>
<P>
While I am indifferent toward the photo itself, and whether the cultural center 
displays it or not, I am concerned about the museum trustees' usurped decision 
of "perceived community concerns," which led to the photo's removal. 
</P>
<P>
I am also disturbed about the local arts community's silence, except for a few 
perfunctory squeaks. 
</P>
<P>
Where were the public comments from Orange County's artists, performers and 
writers? The dearth of reaction from professionals, arts organizations and 
museums only serves to reinforce the "little ado in Orange County" attitude 
that accompanied a recent Times article about the lack of local response to the 
controversy surrounding artistic content and funding for the National Endowment 
for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to arts organizations across the United States that are picking up 
the gauntlet against the encroachment of subtle restrictions and outright 
censorship, members of Orange County's arts community were quoted as being "too 
busy," among other things, to be actively involved in the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Can we afford the portent of such complacency? 
</P>
<P>
No. Waiting until we aren't too busy (which never happens), or until we have a 
reason to act (i.e., when we are finally directly affected by censorship) is 
dangerous and shortsighted. 
</P>
<P>
Dangerous because our apathy allows others to make choices for us. Shortsighted 
because through our inaction we have permitted the self-appointed monitors of 
morality and taste to lay a foundation for future restraints in other areas of 
our lives. 
</P>
<P>
Tacit approval clings to silence that is maintained in the face of decisions 
made by "guardians" of what we will see, hear or read. 
</P>
<P>
The point has been made more than once in recent months that as the countries 
of Eastern Europe and Latin America approach greater freedom of movement and 
free expression, we in the United States are, paradoxically, tightening 
(through evermore refined means) the restrictions on our own rights. 
</P>
<P>
The incidents at the Muckenthaler Cultural Center reflect more than just the 
removal of a photograph in a moment of poor judgment. It mirrors growing forces 
that are determined to curtail personal choice, and not just in the arts. 
</P>
<P>
We should all be more aware and more engaged in issues affecting our right to 
exercise freedom of choice. If not us, who? If not now, when?

JOFFREY MOUNTS AN ALL-ARPINO PROGRAM AT CHANDLER PAVILION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All-Arpino programs by the Joffrey Ballet are scarcely news -- but the 
three-part bill at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on Thursday seemed in danger 
of proving historic. For all anyone knew at the time, this might have been the 
final performance of any Gerald Arpino ballet by the company he co-founded. 
</P>
<P>
After resigning as artistic director on Tuesday, Arpino had issued a statement 
through his lawyer prohibiting the performance of any of his works as of 
Friday. Two Arpino works are scheduled for Saturday's performance. Attorneys 
for both sides were conferring Friday afternoon in an attempt to reach a 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, a company in crisis is something to see. This was a night of 
virtually faultless dancing, an assertion of spirit and prowess despite the 
circumstances -- and, inevitably, despite the choreography. 
</P>
<P>
Normally a blur of dancers running and jumping through dappled light, "Suite 
Saint-Saens" (1978) suddenly acquired some potent afterimages: the noble calm 
of Douglas Martin in the opening section, for example, or the playful 
flamboyance of Carole Valleskey in the finale. Edward Stierle, of course, 
jumping madly -- but also moments when Peter Narbutas, Deborah Dawn, Tyler 
Walters and others filled Arpino's emptiest adagios with deep feeling. 
</P>
<P>
If Jerome Robbins' faun met Frederick Ashton's Ondine under a pier some night, 
you'd have "Sea Shadow" (1962), an adagio to Ravel with lots of rippling limbs 
and stylized gymnastics. Valerie Madonia and Tom Mossbrucker couldn't exactly 
make the liquid posturings look profound, but they danced with great surety, 
and pianist Stanley Babin accompanied them sensitively. 
</P>
<P>
The new "TWO-A-DAY" extravaganza featured several major cast changes from the 
previous evening. A listless Jill Davidson led the boys through the top-hat 
ensemble, Deborah Dawn slinked expertly through the Spanish sequence and, best 
of all, Jodie Gates gave the Marilyn Miller impersonation a childlike sense of 
wonder. 
</P>
<P>
John Miner and Allan Lewis shared the program's conducting duties, with the 
orchestra sounding especially fine in "Suite Saint-Saens." LEWIS SEGAL

SHAKING YOUR FAMILY TREE : HOW TO TRACK CIVIL WAR VET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRA VANDERPOOL GORMLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: From an obituary of my ancestor, Dr. D.A. White, I discovered 
information about his Civil War service. He enlisted as a private in Company C, 
12th Regiment, of the Michigan Infantry and was made second sergeant of Company 
A, Mississippi Marine Brigade, in 1863. In 1865, he was commissioned second 
lieutenant of Company H, 151st Indiana, and later that year was commissioned 
captain of Company I of the same regiment. 
</P>
<P>
What documents might be available about his service? Do photographs of his 
company exist? 
</P>
<P>
 -- L.H., Eudora, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Request several copies of "Order for Copies of Veterans Records" from 
Military Service Branch (NNMS), National Archives and Records Service, 8th and 
Pennsylvania Ave., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20408. When you receive the forms, 
use two of them -- one to request military records and one for pension records. 
Ask the National Archives to copy all the records pertaining to him (otherwise, 
they will send only selected records). 
</P>
<P>
While you are waiting for the records (which can take a couple of months), 
track your ancestor through the census records from 1910 backward as far as you 
can. It is especially important that you locate him in the 1860 census along 
with his parents. 
</P>
<P>
Then consult "Military Bibliography of the Civil War," compiled by C.E. 
Dornbusch (Vol. 1 has information on Michigan and Minnesota units). You will 
find this book at most large libraries with Civil War collections and at 
university libraries. This will lead you to other sources about his regiments. 
</P>
<P>
For information about photographs of him and/or his companies, contact the 
Reference Branch, U.S. Army Military History Institute, Carlisle Barracks, Pa. 
17013. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am trying to find the parents of my ancestor, George Washington Thompson, 
who was born in 1851 in Benton County, Ark., and died in Mariette, Okla., in 
1940. His mother's maiden name was Treadwell. There are so many Thompsons in 
the 1860 census, is there an easier way to locate this family? 
</P>
<P>
 -- D.T., Hermosa Beach 
</P>
<P>
A: Start by obtaining a copy of his death certificate from the Oklahoma State 
Department of Health, Division of Vital Records, P.O. Box 53551, Oklahoma City, 
Okla. 73152-3551 ($5). This document may give his exact birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
A search of the marriage records in Benton County for a Treadwell-Thompson 
marriage circa 1850 should provide you with his parents' names.

A Long Beach man who has done investigative research to debunk faith healers 
and satanist cult scares has been named new editor of the Humanist, the nearly 
50-year-old magazine of the American Humanist Assn. 
</P>
<P>
David Alexander, 46, will succeed Lloyd Morain, 73, starting with the 
bimonthly's September-October issue. 
</P>
<P>
Published in Amherst, N.Y., the magazine's circulation is between 25,000 and 
30,000 -- at least four times the membership of the association. 
</P>
<P>
"The membership (of the American Humanist Assn.) is disproportionate to the 
effect that humanist ideas have in society," Alexander said. Author Isaac 
Asimov is president of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander, who has worked as a magician, photographer and private investigator, 
wrote the lead article in the March/April issue of the Humanist. The article 
criticized the growing number of occult crime experts and anti-satanist 
"hysteria," drawing heavily on a debunking study done by the Committee for the 
Scientific Examination of Religion, chaired by Gerald Larue, a USC professor 
emeritus. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been associated with James (The Amazing) Randi for years," Alexander 
said, "and I was one of his chief investigators for his book on faith healers." 
Randi, a frequent guest on Johnny Carson's "Tonight Show," was given the 1990 
Distinguished Service Award at the organization's annual convention in Orlando 
last weekend. Broadcast executive-entrepreneur Ted Turner was given the 
Humanist of the Year Award. 
</P>
<P>
Although the organization is incorporated as an educational body -- not a 
religious body -- the magazine and the organization often delve into religious 
and ethical issues, but from a non-theistic, skeptical point of view. 
</P>
<P>
The Humanist magazine will be 50 next January. "It goes to virtually every 
major library," Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PEOPLE 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Harold Schulweis, a Conservative rabbi who leads Valley Beth Shalom in 
Encino, put a large crack in what he called the "Jewish Berlin Wall" when he 
spoke to an Orthodox group at Beth Jacob Congregation in Beverly Hills on a 
recent Sabbath. Orthodox and Conservative synagogues have been traditionally 
off-limits to rabbis of each other's tradition, especially as religious and 
political issues have divided the strict Jewish law observing Orthodox and the 
more modernizing Jewish branches. It was not surprising last September when 
Rabbi Daniel Landes of Beth Jacob was warmly received at Schulweis' synagogue 
-- the first half of their bold exchange. But Schulweis' appearance before the 
Upstairs Minyan of Beth Jacob last month was preceded by heavy criticism from 
other Orthodox rabbis. But Leo Noonan of the Jewish Journal reported that the 
overflow crowd "broke into loud applause for the Conservative rabbi" amid cries 
of a job well done. Schulweis, praising the "courage and warmth" of Rabbi 
Landes, said in his talk that if Orthodox and non-Orthodox Jews don't end their 
mutual hostility that violence and permanent polarization are likely. Schulweis 
suggested more such pulpit exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
Father Alfred LoPinto, 45, now ending a five-year term in Washington as 
executive director of the U.S. Catholic Bishops' social justice-funding 
Campaign for Human Development, was named this week as new executive director 
of Catholic Charities in the San Bernardino Diocese. Bishop Phillip F. Straling 
also appointed LoPinto, who will start his duties Sept. 1, as rector of Our 
Lady of the Rosary Cathedral in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DATES 
</P>
<P>
Fearing that Christian churches in general are perceived by the public as being 
anti-abortion, a 350-member United Methodist Church in Monterey Park has 
scheduled a convocation for 2 p.m. Sunday to affirm the denomination's stance 
"to safeguard the legal option of abortion." The Rev. Barbara Kilgore, pastor 
of the host Sage Memorial United Methodist Church, said the forum will also 
deal with family planning and world population problems. 
</P>
<P>
The 25th renewal of Mary's Hour, a revived devotional event sponsored by the 
Los Angeles Catholic Archdiocese, will be held in East Los Angeles for the 
first time on Sunday. Archbishop Roger M. Mahony will preside and give the 
homily at East Los Angeles College Stadium. The program is expected to run from 
3 to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Are You Running With Me, Jesus?" was a religious best-selling collection of 
poetic prayers two decades ago. This Sunday at St. Augustine-by-the-Sea 
Episcopal Church in Santa Monica, its author, Father Malcolm Boyd, will be 
joined by eight other Episcopal priests for readings, starting at 5 p.m., from 
the revised and expanded edition of the book. JOHN DART

PROTESTS MARK 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF TITO'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

<DATELINE>

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police clubbed demonstrators Friday and hauled some off to jail during protests 
over observing the 10th anniversary of the death of Josip Tito, the founding 
father of Communist Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
Police also broke into a school and detained pupils who ripped Tito pictures 
off the wall and destroyed them. 
</P>
<P>
The incidents took place as factory sirens wailed at 3:05 p.m. -- a signal to 
mark the hour of Tito's death on May 4, 1980, at age 87. 
</P>
<P>
Passers-by mostly ignored the sirens and teen-agers continued enjoying their 
ice cream. In previous years, Yugoslavs stood still and observed a minute of 
silence. 
</P>
<P>
This time, police fought members of the Serbian Radical Party in Belgrade, 
arresting people who kept yelling, "Down with the Communists! Out of Serbia!" 
Shouts against hard-line Serbian Communist leader Slobodan Milosevic also were 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
No official word came on the number of arrests or possible injuries, but 
witnesses said some police action was brutal. 
</P>
<P>
Protesters tore up and threw in the air old 500-dinar bank notes bearing Tito's 
image -- now almost worthless in the wake of 2,500% inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Police forced a photographer taking pictures of demonstrators being pushed into 
a police van to expose his film to light. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators were seen pulling off a Marshal Tito street sign in downtown 
Belgrade. The main street of every city, town and village in Yugoslavia is 
named after Tito. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 Radical Party members and other Yugoslavs opposed to continuing 
public veneration of Tito unfurled a Serbian flag in front of Parliament and 
carried a placard reading, "Exterminate the Evil" (communism).

For almost 45 years, Tito has been officially revered for his role in fighting 
the Nazis in World War II, for his break with Moscow in 1948, and for guiding 
Yugoslavia into the nonaligned movement in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
But now, many Yugoslavs feel their current ethnic, economic and political 
troubles took root during Tito's rule. They blame the weak, decentralized 
leadership system he bequeathed for many of the problems. 
</P>
<P>
Parliament is expected to decide soon to annul a law that makes it a criminal 
offense to criticize Tito or his policies.

CRANSTON WILL SEEK TO BLOCK CHEESEBORO CANYON SWAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) on Friday announced his opposition to a 
controversial land swap in Cheeseboro Canyon that would allow entertainer Bob 
Hope to begin commercial development of his Jordan Ranch in eastern Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston is the first California official to oppose the land transfer involving 
acreage in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his office, Cranston said he will urge a Senate 
Appropriations subcommittee to block the use of federal funds for the land 
swap. Federal money is needed to pay for an environmental review of the land 
exchange, a Cranston aide said. 
</P>
<P>
"The denial of federal funds would effectively block the deal," Cranston said 
in his statement. 
</P>
<P>
Under the land-swap proposal, the National Park Service would get 864 acres of 
Hope's 2,308-acre Jordan Ranch. In return, the service would give up 59 acres 
in nearby Cheeseboro Canyon so that developers could build an access road to a 
planned golf course and 750-house subdivision on the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
If the proposal is approved, Hope would sell 5,700 acres of land in the Santa 
Susana and Santa Monica mountains to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy for 
$20 million, an amount that is considered lower than Hope could get from 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
But Cranston said that "instead of permitting the land exchange . . . the Park 
Service should be seeking to acquire" the Jordan Ranch property to protect it 
from development. He said he would seek an appropriation of $33 million to 
enable the Park Service to purchase more land in the Cheeseboro Canyon area. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Hope nor developers interested in the property could be reached for 
comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's announcement was applauded by environmentalists, who said it will 
force other California officials to take a stand on the land-swap proposal. So 
far, Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles) and 
Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) have not taken a position on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"We're thrilled," said Siegfried Othmer, a member of the environmental group 
Save the Open Space. "It's the breaking of the dam we've been waiting for." 
</P>
<P>
Elois Zeanah, another member of the group, agreed. "This is a significant 
step," Zeanah said. "This is the first time a federal official has come forward 
and taken a stand. They've all been hiding behind an Iron Curtain of 
neutrality. This will open the curtain for others. People can't hide anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy, who has supported the land swap, said he was surprised and 
disappointed by Cranston's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm somewhat shocked" that Cranston didn't talk to conservancy officials 
before making his announcement, Edmiston said. "I think he's been misinformed. 
I imagine that his position will change when he gets fully informed." 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston, who has been the target of criticism for supporting the land deal, 
said the arrangement with Hope would free $10 million in conservancy funds that 
could be used to acquire thousands of acres of other environmentally sensitive 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston said he was not certain what effect, if any, Cranston's announcement 
would have in swaying other officials. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston said he will ask the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on interior to 
triple President Bush's budget for buying land that should be protected. 
</P>
<P>
"I am dismayed that the National Park Service is opening the door to commercial 
development of Jordan Ranch, which should one day be national parkland," 
Cranston said. He accused the agency of "acting directly contrary to and 
subversive of its mission."

AIR POLLUTION BOARD TO HOLD 2ND HEARING TODAY ON VOLATILE DUMP ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An air pollution board that is reviewing gas emission problems at the Lopez 
Canyon dump, owned by the city of Los Angeles, has scheduled a second hearing 
today in Lake View Terrace, despite City Hall protests that the dump's 
neighbors created a "lynch mob" atmosphere last week at the first hearing 
there. 
</P>
<P>
If the city gets its way, the sometimes raucous hearings involving the Lopez 
Canyon dump will end today with the air board ratifying an agreement reached 
earlier between the city and the South Coast Air Quality Management District 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
Under that agreement, the city would install up to 200 additional gas 
collection wells at the dump in Lake View Terrace and boost the capacity of the 
landfill's flaring station, which burns methane gas gathered by the wells. 
</P>
<P>
The air district's staff is expected to present the agreement to the SCAQMD 
variance hearing board -- the five-member panel conducting the hearings -- 
within days and to ask the board to convert the accord into a legally binding 
order, Deputy City Atty. Chris Westhoff said. 
</P>
<P>
Approval of such an order would represent a victory for the city. It would end 
the need for additional hearings -- which have proved to be an embarrassing 
catalyst for intense public anger against the dump -- and it would require the 
city to do only what it has already privately agreed to do. 
</P>
<P>
But community activist Rob Zapple, a member of the board of the Kagel Canyon 
Civic Assn., said such a solution would be grossly inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
Zapple and other activists are calling on the variance hearing board to close 
the dump or sharply limit the daily number of trucks off-loading at the 
landfill until the city eliminates the site's gas problems. 
</P>
<P>
Tests earlier this year found methane gas concentrations of 10,000 parts per 
million leaking from the landfill. State regulations limit leaks to 500 p.p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The variance hearing board in August issued an order requiring the city to 
install gas collection wells and a flare station at Lopez Canyon, set deadlines 
for doing the work and imposed inspection and reporting requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The SCAQMD believes that the city is in full compliance with the order, Elliott 
Sernel, SCAQMD enforcement prosecutor, said. On the other hand, because the air 
district and the city now recognize that the existing gas collection system is 
inadequate, they have agreed to install more wells. 
</P>
<P>
Westhoff said Friday that he expects the SCAQMD variance hearing board to 
require hearings for the city to defend its Lopez Canyon operations "because 
this whole thing has taken on a life of its own." 
</P>
<P>
But if more hearings are required, Westhoff said, the city would insist that 
they be held at SCAQMD headquarters in El Monte and that the variance hearing 
board present the city with a written set of accusations against the city to 
justify the hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Westhoff contended that a "lynch mob" atmosphere was allowed 
to prevail during the April 27 hearing. Lopez Canyon foes have denied that the 
situation was as unruly as described by Westhoff, although they conceded that 
Westhoff was the target of boos and catcalls as he cross-examined foes of the 
dump. 
</P>
<P>
Today's hearing is scheduled to begin at 9:30 a.m. at the Lake View Terrace 
Recreation Center, 11075 Foothill Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
Although the air district staff advised the variance hearing board that it 
might want armed security guards at today's hearing, the board's staff said 
Friday that no guards had been requested.

FIRM AWARDED $11.7 MILLION IN PLANT FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Chatsworth aircraft parts maker was awarded $11.7 million Friday by a 
Superior Court jury that supported the company's allegation that a defective 
circuit breaker caused a fire that destroyed its manufacturing plant. 
</P>
<P>
The jury sided with Dunlap &amp; Abbott Manufacturing Co. in a suit filed 
against Square D Co., which made the circuit breaker. 
</P>
<P>
The award represents damages to cover the costs of the fire and lost profits 
but no punitive damages, said Mark Roth, a lawyer who represented Dunlap &amp; 
Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good. I think it was a fair award," Dunlap &amp; Abbott owner Ted 
McCarthy said shortly after the verdict was announced. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Square D, a major producer of electric products, could not be 
reached for comment. The jury's decision was announced after the close of 
business hours at Square D's headquarters in Palatine, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the law firm which represented Square D in the case also could not 
be reached. 
</P>
<P>
The flash fire gutted Dunlap &amp; Abbott's plant on Sunburst Street on June 4, 
1984, injuring nine people and destroying the company's collection of 
computerized lathes and drills. The company, which makes a variety of metal and 
hydraulic parts for aircraft and missiles, rebuilt the football-field-size 
plant the following year. 
</P>
<P>
Dunlap &amp; Abbott later sued Square D, alleging that the circuit breaker 
failed to trip a short circuit in the plant's electrical wiring and thus 
started the fire. The trial lasted four months, and the 12-member jury in San 
Fernando deliberated 3 1/2 days before reaching its verdict.

AROUND THE VALLEY: PRACTICING WHAT THEY PREACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The men at the round tables are priests in plain clothes -- open collars, 
casual shoes, muted colors that seem out of character with the corporate 
grandeur of the Sheraton Universal Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not been the church of the rich," says Father Joseph Protano, a 
heavyset priest from Providence, R.I. His New England-Italian accent evokes 
priests in black-and-white movies who sounded like cops or gangsters. 
</P>
<P>
"By and large, we have been the church of the poor, of the working-class, 
average Joe. And increasingly today, of senior citizens. And I would wager that 
most priests come from blue-collar backgrounds." 
</P>
<P>
The morning workshop on priests and social activism -- "The Priest as Pastor 
and Prophet" -- is part of the annual conference of the National Federation of 
Priests' Councils. 
</P>
<P>
The delegates represent councils elected or appointed by priests in 88 of the 
nation's 175 dioceses. Other dioceses do not participate because of 
philosophical differences or financial constraints. 
</P>
<P>
Topics range from the spiritual -- "The Gift: Searching for Identity in a 
Church of Many Ministers" -- to the practical -- "How to Buy a Wellness 
Program." 
</P>
<P>
This workshop focuses on increasing the commitment of the U.S. Catholic Church 
to issues such as poverty at home and abroad, workers' rights and other social 
causes. The delegates have pegged the effort to the 100th anniversary next year 
of Pope Leo XIII's call for Catholic social activism in 1891. 
</P>
<P>
"Our best-kept secret is that we have a substantial body of church teachings on 
social, economic and cultural matters," says Father Fred Kammer, a church 
policy adviser based in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
Many Catholics in the United States historically resisted those teachings 
because they were intent on moving into the social and economic mainstream, 
sometimes in a hostile environment, Kammer says. "We bought the American myth 
wholesale. The accusation of being un-American has been far more stinging than 
being un-Christian or un-Catholic." 
</P>
<P>
These priests want to change that. Many belong to missionary orders and have 
served in the Third World trenches, whether in Latin America or in U.S. inner 
cities. They are witty, ardent, surprisingly blunt. 
</P>
<P>
"This must be a celebration of who in the hell we are," says Father George 
Murphy in an Irish brogue. He says the church has spent $5 million on 
anti-abortion efforts and $25 million on a headquarters in Washington. "If we 
can raise $30 million for that, damn it to hell, a couple of bucks ought to be 
found for this celebration." 
</P>
<P>
Father Thomas O'Brien, who wears a red cardigan sweater, spent 15 years working 
with the poor in Guatemala but speaks with the flat twang of his native 
Chicago. His church in a Virginia suburb of Washington has many parishioners 
who work for the Pentagon and other federal agencies. "When you start talking 
about this kind of thing, they think you're a communist or something," he says. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien believes the creed should include denunciations of injustice and 
oppression. 
</P>
<P>
"We can sell them on the Trinity because it's harmless," he says. "It doesn't 
hit them in the pocketbook." 
</P>
<P>
Father Douglas Doussan of New Orleans suggests that a spirit of collaboration 
ought to temper the "prophetic" role of the priest. He quotes theologian Thomas 
Merton: "Every prophet is a pain-in-the-neck, but not every pain-in-the-neck is 
a prophet." 
</P>
<P>
"I would have lowered his locus a little bit," Protano jokes. 
</P>
<P>
Kammer poses a theoretical question: How would those present spend a $500,000 
windfall bequeathed by a parishioner, weighing considerations such as the 
parish treasury and local and overseas charities? 
</P>
<P>
The discussion centers on the divisions that would surface: between liberally 
inclined priests and more conservative parishioners, between longtime, 
middle-class, white parishioners on one hand and the minorities and new 
immigrants who are changing the face of the church on the other. 
</P>
<P>
"Overt, violent, up-front racism can be a serious impediment to charity," says 
Father Bill Pruett, whose archdiocese in Kiowa County, Okla., has seen 
conflicts between farmers of German origin and Latin American farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
Talk of strife brings up the theme dominating the conference agenda. The church 
and the priesthood are in transition, if not in crisis. As urban schools and 
churches close, as the ranks of the clergy dwindle, fundamental concepts are 
being challenged. 
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to talk about social justice outside the church when we don't 
have justice inside the church," a white-haired priest says. "The issues of 
equality for women, the whole question of priests and sexuality, must be 
addressed." 
</P>
<P>
Protano reflects on the mood while the others go outside for a break. He sits 
alone among empty chairs, his big hands on the table. 
</P>
<P>
"Priestless parishes, that's the fulcrum point for all these other questions," 
he says. "Do we reach out to the priests who have left and married and want to 
go back to work, get them back on the job? How about permitting ordained women? 
</P>
<P>
"I heard a commentator make a good point about Earth Day. He said the planet 
isn't in trouble, it's the species that's in trouble. . . . The church is not 
in trouble. The church has been here since the beginning of time. It's the 
people. . . . We are talking about the survival of Roman Catholicism."

3 HOSPITALS ALLOWED TO LIMIT PATIENTS FROM PARAMEDICS; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: THE PACT AIMS TO STOP MORE SOUTH BAY FACILITIES FROM CLOSING THEIR 
DOORS TO PUBLIC AMBULANCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a move aimed at preventing more South Bay hospitals from closing their doors 
to patients transported by paramedics, Los Angeles County health officials have 
agreed to allow three local hospitals, on a trial basis, to accept public 
ambulance patients only from their immediate areas. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement will go into effect May 15 at Memorial Hospital of Gardena, 
Robert F. Kennedy Medical Center in Hawthorne and Daniel Freeman Memorial 
Hospital in Inglewood. The arrangement could later be amended or canceled if it 
is found to be impractical, an official with the county's Department of Health 
Services said this week. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a trial program, and if it doesn't work, we'll stop and go back to the 
drawing board," said Barbara Pavey, who supervises paramedic care for the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, all three facilities have said that increasing numbers of 
patients from outside their areas are overburdening emergency care operations. 
</P>
<P>
Gardena and Freeman, in particular, have said a large number of their emergency 
patients come from nearby areas served by county-operated Martin Luther King 
Jr./Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles. The center is frequently overcrowded, 
and overflow patients are taken to the two hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, neither King nor Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in Torrance 
will be allowed to divert paramedic patients from their areas to the three 
South Bay hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Figures on how many patients transported by paramedics are treated by the three 
local hospitals were not immediately available. A Freeman official said that 
facility treats about 950 such patients each month, but she was unable to say 
how many of them came from Inglewood and nearby areas. 
</P>
<P>
County health officials have been especially concerned about paramedic service 
in the South Bay since last spring, when Centinela Hospital Medical Center in 
Inglewood stopped taking patients transported by paramedics, except obstetric 
cases. The hospital cited huge financial losses from non-paying emergency cases 
for its decision. 
</P>
<P>
Then, about five months ago, Memorial Hospital of Gardena, saying it also could 
not afford to continue to take such cases, filed for permission with state 
officials to shut its doors to paramedics. The hospital later offered to retain 
paramedic services if it were allowed to take only Gardena residents. 
</P>
<P>
The county balked at Gardena's request, but it began talks with the three 
hospitals to establish areas from which each would draw patients transported by 
paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
County health officials were worried that all the facilities might eventually 
close their doors to such patients unless a deal could be struck, Pavey said. 
</P>
<P>
"If they leave, (the) impact on county hospitals would be inestimable, just 
enormous," she said. 
</P>
<P>
George Rooth, administrator at Memorial Hospital of Gardena, said he was 
pleased with the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for Memorial essentially to treat only those patients 
picked up by paramedics within Gardena's city limits. Kennedy will receive 
patients from Hawthorne, El Segundo, Lawndale and a portion of Lennox. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman will accept patients from Inglewood and areas stretching to Western 
Avenue on the east, Los Angeles International Airport on the west, Slauson 
Avenue on the north and Imperial Highway on the south.

STATE PANEL ACCUSES MD OF NEGLIGENCE IN 3 DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By VIRGINIA ELLIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles physician has been accused of gross negligence and incompetence 
in the deaths of three young women who died shortly after undergoing abortions. 
</P>
<P>
The Medical Board of California said Dr. Leo F. Kenneally, who operates Her 
Medical Clinic in South Los Angeles, neglected to follow emergency life-saving 
procedures when the women developed complications while undergoing the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
In a 53-page explanation of the charges, the board said Kenneally caused the 
death of Donna K. Heim, 20, of Covina in August, 1986, by failing to get her 
breathing again after she developed respiratory problems during an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, the board said a second woman, Liliana Cortez, 22, who like Heim 
was an asthmatic, suffered a seizure during an abortion. Instead of 
"appropriately managing her life-threatening emergency," the board said 
Kenneally continued to perform the abortion. It said the woman was pronounced 
brain dead a few minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 17, 1987, the board said, 18-year-old Michelle Thames of Lynwood died 
of brain damage caused by lack of oxygen. It accused Kenneally of taking too 
long to call paramedics when it was apparent her heart had stopped during the 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The board also accused a second doctor, Mahlon Douglas Cannon, of repeated 
negligent acts and incompetence in the deaths of Heim and Cortez. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases, the agency asked that the licenses of the two doctors be revoked 
or suspended. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneally's attorney, Alan R. Freedman, said the doctor will challenge the 
charges in an administrative hearing. He said he expected to prove that there 
was "no medical malpractice" on Kenneally's part. Cannon, who no longer 
practices in Kenneally's office, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Freedman said it was curious that the medical board had waited until now to 
file charges against Kenneally when the deaths of two of the women had occurred 
as long ago as 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"If the evidence is so clear here and such terrible things were being done, why 
did it take them three years to file an accusation? " he asked. 
</P>
<P>
He accused the agency of bowing to pressure from anti-abortion protesters and 
what he said was its own prejudice toward physicians who perform abortions in 
an office setting. 
</P>
<P>
While being questioned by one of the board's medical consultants, Freedman said 
Kenneally was told that it was board policy that "abortions should never be 
performed in an outpatient setting." 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the medical board in its own way is trying to legislate new 
law so they're trying to close down the outpatient clinics which are performing 
abortions," Freedman said. 
</P>
<P>
He described Kenneally's clinic at 2700 S. Figueroa St. as serving mostly poor 
and mostly black and Latino women. If the doctor is ultimately forced to give 
up his license, he said, the clinic will be closed. 
</P>
<P>
"This man is not dangerous to the community," he said. "He's been working in 
the community for years and years and he's helped so many women." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the medical board blamed the long delay in filing charges 
against Kenneally on the "complexity" of the case. She noted that the board had 
cited several additional cases that had not resulted in patient deaths but 
where it believed that Kenneally had been negligent in treating women who 
suffered complications during an abortion. She said it took a long time to 
investigate those cases. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Los Angeles County district attorney's office also conducted 
preliminary investigations into the deaths of the three women, a spokesman said 
there are no plans to file criminal charges against Kenneally. 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Schirn, head deputy district attorney for special crimes, added: 
"These things are always open if there is some additional evidence that comes 
to light that would show lack of medical care warranted a criminal filing." 
</P>

TRAINS: FATALITIES INVOLVING CAR DRIVERS WHO RACE THROUGH CROSSING ZONES ARE

Bell police detective Hector Camacho, a walkie-talkie in hand, stood in the cab 
of a creeping locomotive on Friday when a dented four-door Buick sped across 
the Otis Street crossing less than 40 feet from the engine. 
</P>
<P>
"Jesus, lady!" Camacho yelled as he radioed a nearby squad car, which 
eventually pulled the woman over and issued her a $100 citation for running the 
flashing red lights at the rail crossing. 
</P>
<P>
"She never slowed down, she just gunned it," Camacho said. "She had two kids in 
the back seat. If that car had stalled, we would have nailed them." 
</P>
<P>
The number of people violating railroad crossing zones along this six-mile 
stretch of Union Pacific tracks in southeast Los Angeles County is among the 
highest in California, and Camacho was aboard the "Trooper Special" to help nab 
motorists or pedestrians busting through, going around or racing under crossing 
gates or flashing signals. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran detective was part of the inaugural operation to cut down on 
railroad accidents, which targeted the cities of Vernon, Maywood, Huntington 
Park, Bell and Cudahy, an area considered among the most dangerous in the 
state. From his perch, Camacho would radio two chase units, which issued 17 
tickets to impatient drivers in less than 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"At times we've all had to wait at a crossing, and we've all thought about 
running it," Camacho said. "But it doesn't pay. The risk is too great." 
</P>
<P>
Union Pacific engineer Jim McInerney, who piloted the Trooper Special, knows 
the dangers all too well. Several years ago in the City of Industry, he struck 
a car that bolted in front of his engine, killing the driver and her two sons. 
</P>
<P>
"Once that happens you never forget it. It takes a locomotive going 55 m.p.h. 
nearly a mile and a half to stop. But people don't think that way," said 
McInerney, who spends his off hours lecturing schoolchildren about the dangers 
of playing near rail lines. He is a volunteer for Operation Lifesaver, a 
non-profit organization funded by the nation's largest rail companies to reduce 
accidents at highway crossings. 
</P>
<P>
Since the group's creation a decade ago, the number of accidents along 
California's 6,500 miles of rail lines has dropped from about 650 a year to 
300. But the number of fatalities statewide has grown recently, from 34 in 1988 
to 44 last year. About a quarter of those fatalities in 1989 occurred in Los 
Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
Accident figures do not include the countless times motorists grow weary of 
waiting and simply plow through crossing gates. In recent years, rail companies 
have begun installing aluminum "breakaway" gates to cut down on replacement 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
But at major intersections, like Bandini and Downey avenues in Vernon, 
repairing even the newer-model gates is expensive. Union Pacific spent $63,000 
on gates last year at that crossing alone. 
</P>
<P>
The intersection is near a switching yard, and trucker Todd Watkins said the 
crossing is blocked frequently. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen guys just barrel into those gates," Watkins said. "They can't afford 
to wait. Time is money." 
</P>
<P>
But Tom Lenert, a Santa Fe Railroad safety expert and regional chief of 
Operation Lifesaver, said running a crossing is dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"When you tangle with 11,000 tons of steel, no matter how slow it's going, 
there is going to be some serious damage," he said. "I've seen cars busted into 
tiny pieces when hit by a locomotive." 
</P>
<P>
Yet rail officials say the hurry-up lifestyle of many people tempts them to 
test their timing -- and nerves -- and dart through a rail crossing rather than 
wait for a train to pass. 
</P>
<P>
It was no different Friday at the Otis Street crossing on the Bell-Cudahy 
border. As the Union Pacific engine, traveling 15 m.p.h., approached the 
two-lane road a steady stream of vehicles crossed the tracks despite the 
flashing lights. 
</P>
<P>
Camacho had a field day, barking out descriptions over the radio of the 
offending cars and trucks. As the locomotive chugged past the crossing, a 
handful of officers were off to the side issuing citations to a half-dozen 
motorists. 
</P>
<P>
"Like little kids who play chicken on the tracks, those drivers do the same 
thing," Camacho said. "They like to see how close they can cut it. Today, they 
were lucky. All they got was a ticket. Next time they might get the front end 
of this engine."

CASE AGAINST JAPANESE DIGNITARY PURSUED; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATIONS: GIFT SHOP AGREED NOT TO PRESS SHOPLIFTING CHARGES AFTER MAYOR 
CONTACTED AIRPORT POLICE. BUT L.A. POLICE REFERRED MATTER TO PROSECUTORS. 
</P>

<P>
Authorities are pursuing a shoplifting case against a Japanese dignitary who 
was released within hours of his arrest last month after Mayor Tom Bradley 
contacted police at Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police detectives presented the case to city prosecutors, who will 
decide whether to file misdemeanor counts against Yukio Umemura for allegedly 
stealing merchandise at an airport gift shop, according to Peter Covette, an 
assistant supervisor in the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the district attorney's office declined to press felony 
grand theft charges because "clearly this was not the profile of a professional 
thief," said Ronald H. Carroll, chief deputy of the district attorney's Santa 
Monica branch. 
</P>
<P>
Umemura, 59, quit his post Thursday as chairman of the Nagoya City Assembly, 
according to a Japanese press report. The resignation occurred the day after 
The Times disclosed that Umemura had been arrested on April 14 for allegedly 
taking two Gucci wallets and a leather purse valued at $450 from a duty-free 
airport gift shop. 
</P>
<P>
The shoplifting case was dropped by airport police after Bradley contacted a 
watch commander to express concern for Umemura and the concessionaire agreed 
not to press charges, according to police reports. The mayor has refused to 
discuss his involvement in the case, but his press spokesman said Bradley did 
nothing inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor has always expected the authorities involved, the police and legal 
agencies, to do their jobs," said Bill Chandler. "The mayor was not concerned 
then or now what actions the authorities took." 
</P>
<P>
A police tape obtained by The Times on Friday indicates that watch commanders 
for both the Airport Police and the Los Angeles Police Department agonized over 
how to release Umemura on a felony complaint without violating department 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
On the tape, Airport Police Sgt. Carolyn Harris makes several references in 
conversations to the first call she received from Bradley and a visit to the 
station by Jeffrey A. Matsui, the mayor's executive assistant. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Harris left a message at the home of her captain to inform him 
that "I just got a call from Mayor Bradley concerning (Umemura)," according to 
the tape. 
</P>
<P>
The tape does not contain the mayor's conversations because Bradley called on 
an administrative line, police said. 
</P>
<P>
In a call to LAPD Sgt. David J. Crosbie, Harris explained her predicament: 
</P>
<P>
"I need some help on something. We've got a gentleman who was picked up for 
shoplifting over in Bradley Terminal. He took about $450 worth of stuff. In 
itself, that is no problem. The Duty Free (Shoppers Ltd.) security people held 
him and we brought him in. But since then, we found out that he is chairman of 
the Nagoya City Assembly and . . . the mayor has called and (the mayor) also 
has sent an executive assistant with him." 
</P>
<P>
Harris told Crosbie that airport police "were contemplating" releasing Umemura, 
but she noted that he was accused of a felony. 
</P>
<P>
Crosbie responded with an expletive. After leaving the phone for a moment, the 
LAPD sergeant returned and said: "OK. He has to be booked for grand theft." 
</P>
<P>
"OK," the airport sergeant said with a groan. 
</P>
<P>
"He has to be booked and bailed out," Crosbie said. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, that's what we were trying to avoid," said Harris. "If Duty Free were 
willing to drop the charges, could we go that way?" 
</P>
<P>
"That's up to the store." 
</P>
<P>
But Harris noted that Duty Free wanted to press charges at the time. "They 
aren't budging on it too much." 
</P>
<P>
Crosbie instructed her how to handle Umemura's release. "You write out a long 
police report. I'd make a long, long entry that you discussed it with the Duty 
Free people and all these people come down and people were willing to drop the 
charges. Make sure your boss approves it . . . at least you're covered." 
</P>
<P>
Harris concluded the conversation by saying that airport police would attempt 
to solicit Duty Free's cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got interpeters, and we've got an assistant to the mayor in the station 
now," she said. "We're trying to work it out through Duty Free. We got them on 
the line, so maybe we'll be able to work it out." 
</P>
<P>
Police records show that Duty Free officials wanted to press charges against 
Umemura, but changed their minds after conferring with Matsui, the mayor's 
aide. Both Duty Free and Umemura then signed a mutual waiver agreeing to drop 
all criminal charges and not to publicize the incident. 
</P>
<P>
When top Los Angeles Police Department administrators learned of the incident 
through a Times inquiry, they decided to file the case with prosecutors, police 
spokesman Cmdr. William Booth said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not for (the airport police) to decide what the disposition should be," 
Booth said. "That is for the prosecution agencies who are charged with that 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Airport Police Chief Gil Sandoval said Friday that he accepted the LAPD's 
decision to revive the case. 
</P>
<P>
"When (Duty Free) signed a waiver saying they didn't want to prosecute, we 
didn't think we had a case because they didn't want to pursue it," he said. "If 
(LAPD officials) feel that they want to get the district attorney's and city 
attorney's opinion on it, that is their right." 
</P>
<P>
The day before the airport incident, Bradley and Umemura exchanged gifts in the 
mayor's office. The mayor tentatively plans to travel to Japan later this month 
as part of a sister-city agreement to take a replica of the Hollywood Walk of 
Fame to Nagoya. 
</P>
<P>
Umemura, despite denying any wrongdoing, resigned over "the many troubles" 
caused by the incident, according to a Japanese news report. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Langenberg, a Los Angeles attorney and a member of the Los Angeles-Nagoya 
Sister City Affiliation, who is an acquaintance of Umemura, said: "It is a very 
common practice in Japan for people to accept responsibility for . . . public 
embarrassment by resigning."

<TEXT>
<P>
A Canadian man who had been sought for two years in the murder of an Alberta 
resident and the attempted murder of another was arrested Friday in West 
Hollywood, a deputy U.S. marshal said. 
</P>
<P>
Ian Murray Berger, 37, was arrested without incident about 3:30 p.m. at the 
home of his grandmother and was being held at the federal Metropolitan 
Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles, said Deputy Marshal Aldean Lee. 
</P>
<P>
An extradition hearing for Berger was scheduled for Monday, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Berger had gone gunning for a business partner, Lee said, and instead shot to 
death another man and wounded a second one. 
</P>
<P>
Cpl. Ray Gaultier of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police would say only that 
Berger was wanted in the August, 1988, shootings of the two men in Pincher 
Creek, about 150 miles south of Calgary.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actor John Cusack, who has appeared in such movies as "Eight Men Out" and "Say 
Anything," pleaded no contest in Beverly Hills Municipal Court Friday to a 
misdemeanor charge of driving under the influence of alcohol.

ST. BERNARDS HURT MAN, ECHOING ATTACK ON WIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAYERENE BARKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two St. Bernards knocked an elderly Tarzana man to the ground, breaking his 
jaw, 17 years after dogs of the same breed, owned by the same neighbor, savaged 
his wife's head so severely she has had to wear a wig ever since, animal 
control authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The man's wife also was knocked down in the incident Thursday but was not hurt, 
said Lt. Richard Felosky of the Los Angeles Animal Care and Control Department, 
who said he investigated the attack on the woman in 1973 and coincidentally was 
called out on the Thursday incident. 
</P>
<P>
"That dog just scalped her" in the earlier attack, he said. "I'm surprised she 
survived. When I saw it was her again, it made my hair stand on end." 
</P>
<P>
Albert Gohlke, 84, suffered compound factures of his jaw about 9 a.m. Thursday 
as he and his wife, Helen, also in her 80s, walked their small poodle near 
their home in the 18100 block of Rancho Street. 
</P>
<P>
Felosky said the St. Bernards' owner, Tibor Toczauer, 60, also was walking his 
dogs when he lost control of the 120-pound animals. "They dragged the owner 
across the street and attacked the couple," Felosky said. 
</P>
<P>
Animal control officers impounded the dogs Friday and "we plan on filing 
charges against the owner," Felosky said. "There are indications that there 
have been other problems with the dogs." 
</P>
<P>
Toczauer denied that his dogs attacked the Gohlkes, saying they are just 
playful. His 8-month-old puppy was trying to play with the couple's poodle when 
the husband was injured trying to protect the smaller dog, Toczauer said. 
</P>
<P>
"He fell, somehow," Toczauer said. "We're talking about a nice old man who is 
very weak on his feet. I'm upset that he has been hurt. But he was never bitten 
by my dogs. They did not attack them. They wouldn't attack anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Albert Gohlke was treated at Tarzana Medical Center but was not hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
The St. Bernards will remain at the West Valley Animal Shelter until the case 
can be heard by a Department of Animal Regulation hearing examiner, Felosky 
said. That will take about three months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing examiner can order the dogs destroyed, returned under safety 
restrictions or moved out of Los Angeles County, Felosky said.

the wake of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department money-skimming scandal. 
</P>
<P>
But officials stressed Friday that there is no apparent link between the death 
of James Henry Atkinson, 43, and the ongoing corruption probe that has led to 
the indictment of 10 sheriff's deputies and the dismissal of more than a dozen 
state and federal drug cases. 
</P>
<P>
The narcotics case involving Atkinson, however, remains a target of federal 
investigators who are looking into whether sheriff's narcotics deputies stole 
money in confiscating nearly $1.95 million during a 1988 drug raid, sources 
close to the investigation said. 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson, whose body was found April 24 in a Van Nuys alley, died of multiple 
gunshot wounds and may have been the victim of a soured drug deal, said Los 
Angeles Police Department Detective Leroy Orozco. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe it's a drug-related case," Orozco said. "This is being investigated 
as a narcotic-related homicide." 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson died two months after the district attorney's office had dismissed a 
cocaine conspiracy charge against him. Atkinson was arrested in May, 1988, 
after he was implicated in an alleged drug ring that purportedly bought 200 
kilograms of cocaine from undercover sheriff's deputies during a reverse sting. 
</P>
<P>
Three other defendants in the case had already pleaded guilty and were 
sentenced to six-year prison terms. But prosecutors dropped the case against 
Atkinson, who had continued on trial, only days after the chief undercover 
officer in the case -- Deputy Macario M. Duran -- was indicted by a federal 
grand jury in the money-skimming scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Duran and nine other sheriff's narcotics deputies were indicted on Feb. 22 on 
charges that they stole more than $1.4 million from suspected drug dealers and 
money launderers. And prosecutors said Friday they could not continue against 
Atkinson without Duran's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 26 narcotics deputies have been suspended in the money-skimming probe. 
Two others have also been relieved of duty for refusing to cooperate with the 
investigation.

KENTUCKY DERBY: ZITO GETS ADVICE -- THAT HE IGNORES -- TO KEEP QUIET AND LET 
THIRTY SIX RED WIN AT CHURCHILL DOWNS. 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Thursday night, trainer Nick Zito got a phone call from his mother in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
"Will you shut up and just win the race," was her advice. 
</P>
<P>
Zito, one of eight trainers running horses in the Kentucky Derby for the first 
time, has a lot to say and he has gone right on saying it this week at 
Churchill Downs. Every day his mother picks up a New York newspaper, Zito's 
opinions about his horse, Thirty Six Red, and the rest of the Derby field are 
plastered all over it. 
</P>
<P>
Zito, 42, admits that he has been overly verbose going into the 116th Derby, 
which will be run today, no matter how much more rain Louisville gets. 
</P>
<P>
Zito has a distinctive voice -- he sounds sort of like a cross between Andy 
Devine and Aldo Ray -- but he's not hoarse. He has talked that way since his 
tonsils were taken out when he was a kid. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't put any pressure on the horse, but I've probably put pressure on 
myself," Zito said. "I've got an in-between horse and he hasn't gotten too much 
press otherwise. When I first got here, I was doing all right. But then I 
started talking." 
</P>
<P>
Zito was standing under Thirty Six Red's shed row, out of the rain that has 
been a regular part of Churchill Downs this week. He was wearing a red 
University of Louisville baseball cap and a black University of Iowa sweat 
shirt, neither of which had anything to do with where he grew up, in Queens in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone here has an opinion about the Derby -- that's what makes the 1 
1/4-mile test as close as anything to America's race -- but Zito is more 
specific than most people. 
</P>
<P>
"The first three will be Thirty Six Red, Summer Squall and Burnt Hills, hanging 
on," Zito said, as though anyone listening ought to run to the mutuel windows 
with the family fortune. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty Six Red is Zito's horse, so that selection is not surprising. Summer 
Squall, who has won seven of eight starts, is the 7-5 favorite. But Zito 
doesn't have Mister Frisky, winner of all 16 of his races and the 8-5 second 
choice, hitting the board. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be stupid if I had Mister Frisky in the money," Zito said. "If my horse 
wins, how can Mister Frisky be up there, too?" 
</P>
<P>
Zito does, however, see Mister Frisky prominent in the early part of the race. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope my horse gets open going down the backstretch," he said. "If we're 
first or second, we'll be OK. I figure Mister Frisky might be third, in what 
they call the garden spot." 
</P>
<P>
Zito apparently doesn't figure Mister Frisky will be able to handle the 
distance, which all 15 Derby 3-year-olds are being asked to run for the first 
time. The field was reduced by one on Friday when Country Day, a 50-1 shot, 
came back from a three-furlong workout with either a muscle tear or a crack in 
his right foreleg. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty Six Red will be ridden by Mike Smith, a former standout at Churchill 
Downs who has been successful in New York since moving East late last year. 
Smith, 24, began his riding career with quarter horses in his native New 
Mexico, and he has won with Thirty Six Red the only two times they've been 
together: in the Gotham at Aqueduct on April 7 and in the Wood Memorial there 
two weeks later. Both times Thirty Six Red was a longshot, 33-1 and 7-1, and 
he's 10-1 in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
His post position -- No. 11 -- does not help. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a long run to the first turn, so maybe we can get (a forward) 
position," Zito said. "The outside might not be too bad if a few of those 
horses on the inside would start to act up. I'll tell Mike to use his Ruidoso 
Downs (quarter horse) experience to get the horse over close to the rail." 
</P>
<P>
Thirty Six Red ran 10 times before Zito used the Wood as the colt's first 
two-turn race. That might have been indicative that the trainer thought his 
horse had distance limitations. 
</P>
<P>
"That wasn't it," Zito said. "I didn't stretch him out because I didn't want to 
wear him out. He's run seven furlongs a lot, and that's a good distance, 
because you can run a horse anywhere (in distance) after he's used to that." 
</P>
<P>
The weather has been changing by the hour. On Friday, there was heavy rain 
during the morning workouts, then sunshine, then a steady rain in the early 
afternoon followed by clearing. The track went from muddy to sloppy to muddy 
again. The forecast is for temperatures in the 60s and a 50% chance of rain 
today, with a muddy track favoring Summer Squall and Mister Frisky. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall would be one of the smaller Derby winners. The horse may weigh 
950 pounds, tops, and in recent weeks has lost weight. Cot Campbell, manager of 
the 28-member syndicate that owns Summer Squall, concedes he'd be more 
comfortable if the horse was carrying 30 more pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall, coming off a hairline fracture as a 2-year-old and a bleeding 
problem this winter, had to run three tightly scheduled races to get here -- 
the Swale at Gulfstream Park on March 17, the Jim Beam at Turfway Park on March 
31 and the Blue Grass at Keeneland on April 14. He ran second to Housebuster, a 
sprinter who's not running in the Derby, in the Swale and won the two other 
stakes. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing you can do about his size," trainer Neil Howard said of Summer 
Squall. "God's put him here the way he is. He's just a lightly made-type horse. 
A big deal's being made out of it, but there's nothing this horse can't do." 
</P>
<P>
If Summer Squall runs in the Derby the way his grandfather, Secretariat, did, 
his camp won't have to defend his lackluster appearance. Secretariat not only 
won the Derby but swept the Triple Crown in 1973.

PINIELLA HAS REDS PLAYING UP TO EXPECTATIONS THIS SEASON

<TEXT>
<P>
Many of the Cincinnati Reds watched on television in the players' lounge at 
Riverfront Stadium as Pete Rose pleaded guilty to two counts of filing false 
income tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
What they saw was reminiscent of the circus summer of 1989, when their former 
manager was seldom out of the camera's eye as baseball conducted its gambling 
investigation and eventually suspended Rose for life. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year was a nightmare," first baseman Todd Benzinger recalled. "It was 
dispiriting and disruptive and couldn't be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd come into the clubhouse all fired up over a win, and all the questions 
were about Pete again. The game was secondary. It was very tough, very 
frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
The feelings festered again as the Reds watched the clubhouse television. This 
time, however, there was a remedy at hand. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Benzinger said, "we could turn the TV off and forget about it. Pete 
is a great guy, but we just can't worry about him anymore. We're trying to win 
games." 
</P>
<P>
Not just trying but doing it. As Rose faces a possible prison sentence, the 
Reds seem to feel as if they've been paroled. 
</P>
<P>
They opened the season with a club-record nine consecutive victories and 
wrapped up April with baseball's best record at 13-3. They talk about having 
fun, building chemistry, responding to the hands-on motivation of Manager Lou 
Piniella -- who was escaping himself, so to speak, from the shackles of George 
Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
After being hounded by the New York Yankee owner, Piniella has become the Reds' 
top dog, though it is uncertain whether owner Marge Schott has broken this news 
to her renowned St. Bernard, Schottzie. 
</P>
<P>
She seems to believe it, however. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the Pete and Marge Show for four or five years," Schott said. "Now we 
have a real team effort, and I'm very pleased. In my heart, I think we should 
have already won a couple championships, but now I think we have the enthusiasm 
and attitude to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Relief pitcher Rob Dibble put it another way, saying there was a need for 
intervention when the Rose inquisition began affecting the team's performance. 
</P>
<P>
"People here were living in the past," he said. "All they talked about was the 
Big Red Machine. It was Pete this, Pete that, as if they were still hoping he'd 
swing a bat, and he never did anything to stop it. It bordered on the pathetic. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed to establish our own identity, and Lou has put the focus back on the 
players. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an unselfishness now because there's genuine respect (among) the 
players, coaches and manager." 
</P>
<P>
Said Piniella: "What I think has happened here is that the players were 
embarrassed by finishing fifth last year and are determined to make amends." 
</P>
<P>
And can they? 
</P>
<P>
"We're not rebuilding. We're not looking two or three years down the road," 
Piniella said. "I mean, I didn't come here specifically to manage again but to 
win. We have enough talent to win now." 
</P>
<P>
It has long been thought that the Reds have the best talent in the National 
League West. Under Rose, however, they finished a frustrating second four 
consecutive times, then were 75-89 last season when the problem of his personal 
situation was compounded by a series of injuries that sidelined shortstop Barry 
Larkin, third baseman Chris Sabo and pitchers Danny Jackson and Jose Rijo, 
among others, for all or most of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds were leading the division as late as June 10, then lost 31 of their 
next 41 games. Rose was suspended Aug. 24 with a managerial record of 426-388. 
Among the raps: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A man who could fill a reporter's notebook at the drop of a question failed 
to communicate or motivate, as if his mere presence would provide inspiration 
and guidance. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A man who collected more hits than anyone in baseball history failed to 
help his hitters, unlike Piniella, "who can break down a swing from head to 
toe," according to Sabo, who has been one of four Reds among the league's top 
10 in hitting. 
</P>
<P>
Said Benzinger: "Pete was an idol of mine, and I came over (from the Boston Red 
Sox) thinking he would bring the same intensity and desire to managing that he 
did to playing; but that just shows the difference between managing and 
playing, because he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it was because of everything that went on last year, but his 
style was definitely a surprise and a disappointment." 
</P>
<P>
Style? 
</P>
<P>
"I know it's hard to believe, but Pete wasn't a strong communicator," relief 
pitcher Norm Charlton said. "His style was to say, 'Here's the bats and balls, 
guys, go get 'em.' " 
</P>
<P>
Center fielder Eric Davis, limited to 131 games last year because of injury and 
back on the disabled list because of a strained knee ligament, said the Reds 
can't use Rose's personal crisis as an excuse for last year, pointing out that 
they survived it while leading much of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"And I definitely think we would have won if the clubhouse hadn't become a 
hospital ward," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Davis said there has been a dramatic change in attitude and 
preparation under Piniella. "We're doing things we haven't done before," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Among them: More work with charts and scouting reports and more meetings among 
various units, such as pitchers and fielders, to go over opposing hitters and 
plot defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Lou is quicker to correct mistakes," Davis said. "He keeps everyone in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year on the road, the bus to the park would be filled. Guys waited until 
the last minute because they dreaded going. Now there are only two or three 
guys on the bus because everybody goes early. We're having fun doing what we're 
supposed to do." 
</P>
<P>
Rose could not be reached for comment. He recently told the Cincinnati Post: 
</P>
<P>
"This is Lou's team, but I helped develop those guys. This is something I took 
five years out of my life to build. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to remember that when I took over the Reds, they were a Titanic. I 
took them to second place four times. And you can't expect to win a division 
title with 12 guys on the (disabled list)." 
</P>
<P>
The Reds are in their prime and probably are stronger than at any time in 
Rose's tenure. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a club in this league that can beat you in as many ways as we 
can," Sabo said. 
</P>
<P>
Items: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Reds led the National League in April with a .306 team batting average, 
getting at least 10 hits in 12 of 16 games while scoring a league-high 94 runs. 
This despite a .189 start by Davis, who is expected to be sidelined another 
three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They stole 29 of 35 bases, with the off-season addition of outfielder Billy 
Hatcher providing a sixth player capable of stealing 20 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The development of 25-year-old Jack Armstrong (5-0) has strengthened the 
rotation and allowed the Reds to bring Jackson and Rijo back slowly from 1989 
injuries. Jackson returned to the disabled list after being hit on the left arm 
by a line drive last Sunday, but it is not considered serious. Rijo gave up 
only four hits in seven innings of a 6-2 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies 
Monday, his first win since June. Jackson and Rijo won 36 games in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The bullpen in April was 5-1 with eight saves and 68 strikeouts in 60 2/3 
innings. The off-season acquisition of Randy Myers, who reads Soldier of 
Fortune magazine, hurls plastic grenades in the clubhouse and wears a 
camouflaged T-shirt under his uniform, has contributed an emotional spark and 
enhanced the eccentricity of a bullpen rich in characters. 
</P>
<P>
Myers, Charlton and Dibble are the self-proclaimed Nasty Boys, and they are all 
of that when delivering 95-m.p.h. fastballs. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dibble: "Lou thinks we over-throw at times, but he's just never seen three 
guys on the same team capable of throwing 95 (m.p.h.)." 
</P>
<P>
Myers came from the New York Mets, who thought he spent too much time in the 
weight room and opted for the stability of John Franco in return. 
</P>
<P>
From the Reds' perspective, the move was seen as another cost-saver by Schott, 
because Franco would have been eligible for free agency after the 1990 season. 
</P>
<P>
But General Manager Bob Quinn, who also came from the Yankees and replaced 
fired Murray Cook in October, disputed the financial factor. 
</P>
<P>
"We traded Franco because our scouts felt Randy Myers hadn't reached his full 
potential," Quinn said. "And because Lou and myself felt we couldn't go to a 
veteran pitcher like Franco and ask him to share the closer role. We felt Myers 
and Dibble could be comfortable with it, which they are." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Piniella has high-octane alternatives in left-handed Myers and 
right-handed Dibble, with left-handed Charlton another option. 
</P>
<P>
"John is a great pitcher," Charlton said of Franco. "But in a tight spot, he 
was like ice out there. With Randy, you can see the fire coming out of his 
head. He brings out the best -- or worst, if you want to call it that -- in Rob 
and me. All three of us are adrenaline pitchers. We go on a full tank all the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Franco received a three-year, $4.8-million contract from the Mets. Myers was 
forced to go to arbitration with the Reds and lost. 
</P>
<P>
He is receiving $875,000 rather than the $1.1 million he sought. 
</P>
<P>
Business is business with Schott, but there are signs that she has come to 
grips with the industry's financial realities and recognizes the potential 
damage if the stream of front-office and scouting defections, flowing from her 
monetary meddling, continued. 
</P>
<P>
She allowed Quinn to sign nine scouts to multiyear contracts. She approved the 
signing of Davis to a three-year, $9.3-million contract and the trading of two 
minimally salaried players for Hatcher, who earns $690,000. 
</P>
<P>
Piniella has a red phone on his desk, as he did at Yankee Stadium. It's a hot 
line to the owner, but he smiled and said, "Here there's an excuse for it 
because it fits the color scheme." 
</P>
<P>
And so far, Piniella has heard only plaudits when it rings. 
</P>
<P>
"Marge and I seem to have a good relationship," he said. "I sit down with her 
once a week to explain what's going on with the team." 
</P>
<P>
Piniella managed the pitching-thin Yankees in 1986 and '87, winning 90 and 89 
games, respectively, before being replaced by Billy Martin, whose fifth stint 
as Yankee manager ended with the hiring of Dallas Green, who has since been 
replaced by Bucky Dent. Last year, Piniella was a special adviser to 
Steinbrenner and a commentator on Yankee telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
He received several managerial feelers and might have gone to Toronto, except 
that Steinbrenner, wanting to be indemnified by a division rival, asked a steep 
price in players to let Piniella out of his contract, and the deal broke down. 
</P>
<P>
When Quinn and the Reds then offered a three-year contract, Steinbrenner gave 
his blessing, and Piniella jumped, ending a 17-year association with the 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot of attachments and will continue to root for New York," Piniella 
said. "I like the owner, but he was very difficult to work for. The players 
have to know the manager is in control, and under George the manager can lose 
control very quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have stayed, but I didn't want to be known as one of George's guys. I 
needed to get out on my own. I didn't want to be thought of as a recycled 
manager. I didn't want to run the risk of having Roman numerals after my name. 
I mean, managing the Yankees once was all right. The second time (when he came 
back briefly to replace Martin in '88) was unnecessary, and a third time would 
have been absurd." 
</P>
<P>
Piniella was criticized for not handling his pitchers properly, but he was 
dealing primarily with a staff of rejects and retreads. 
</P>
<P>
"What pitchers?" he said. "We won 90 games in '86 with only one pitcher (Dennis 
Rasmussen) who won more than 10 games, and I don't think that's ever been done 
before. In the two years I managed (the Yankees), nobody gave me 200 innings. 
It was said I had a quick hook, but I had an old staff that didn't get a second 
wind. When they started to get hit, I had to get them out. It was also said I 
didn't handle (Dave) Righetti right. Well, he set a major league record with 46 
saves the first year I managed and came back with 31 the next. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I made mistakes, but it was the first time I ever managed, and I 
definitely served that apprenticeship under trying conditions. I mean, managing 
the Yankees for 2 1/2 years is like managing five or six (years) anywhere else. 
I'm prepared now. I wouldn't have come (to the Reds) if I didn't think the team 
could win and I could help it win." 
</P>
<P>
And as for the pressure of replacing Pete Rose, Piniella said there was just as 
much pressure replacing Martin. 
</P>
<P>
However, he has made one adjustment as Rose's successor. He isn't wearing the 
No. 14 he always wore with the Yankees, because 14 was Rose's number. 
</P>
<P>
"It belonged to a special guy in Cincinnati, and that's the way it will stay," 
he said. "I chose 41 because I'm the 41st manager in Reds history, and it's the 
reverse of 14." 
</P>
<P>
It is not the only thing that seems to have been reversed here.

NEWSWIRE: RED SOX DEAL SMITH, GET BRUNANSKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Boston Red Sox acquired outfielder Tom Brunansky from the St. Louis 
Cardinals Friday for pitcher Lee Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The deal climaxed several weeks of talks as the Red Sox tried to trade Smith 
for either a starting pitcher or a power hitter and the Cardinals sought a 
closer to replace disabled Todd Worrell. 
</P>
<P>
Boston General Manager Lou Gorman has been trying to trade Smith for what he 
considers equal talent since the Red Sox signed pitcher Jeff Reardon as a free 
agent for $6.8 million for three years on Dec. 6. With Reardon and Smith, 
Boston had two right-handed closers in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, in the last year of a contract signed after he was obtained from the 
Chicago Cubs on Dec. 8, 1987, had threatened to leave the Red Sox at the end of 
the season if he was not traded. 
</P>
<P>
Brunansky, 29, batted .158 in 19 games, with one home run and two runs batted 
in this season. He has a total of 209 homers in 1,247 games with the Angels, 
the Minnesota Twins and the Cardinals, and had 20 or more homers in each of the 
previous eight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Brunansky has fared well at Fenway Park, batting .302 in 32 games with 10 
homers and 21 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 32, is 2-1 this season with four saves and a 1.89 earned-run average in 
11 games. Acquired from the Chicago Cubs, he had a 12-7 record with 58 saves in 
two-plus seasons with the Red Sox, and has 238 saves.

NATIONAL COMMISSION MAY BE ON HORIZON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If professional boxing is ever governed solely by an American commission 
instead of the ever-growing list of competing groups, it may be remembered that 
the first step in that direction was taken Thursday in a conference room at the 
Las Vegas Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of 18 state boxing commissions, in a 14-2 vote with two 
abstentions, voted to drop their memberships from all world governing bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Some saw it as a move toward the formation of a national boxing commission, but 
no one seemed sure how that might come about. 
</P>
<P>
The vote followed an impassioned speech by New York boxing commissioner Randy 
Gordon, who pointed out that 65% of all major fights in the world in 1989 
occurred in the United States, generating 85% of the money in pro boxing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time for us to clean up our sport," Gordon said. "I'm tired of these 
sanctioning bodies coming to the United States, taking those big sanction fees 
and then telling us how to conduct fights in our states. 
</P>
<P>
"We must rid our sport of the cancer that has been killing boxing for years. 
And if we walk out of here today having done nothing, that will be the biggest 
crime of all." 
</P>
<P>
He referred to the five self-appointed governing bodies that control the sport 
-- the Mexico City-based World Boxing Council, the Venezuela-based World Boxing 
Assn., the International Boxing Federation of New Jersey, and two fledgling 
U.S. groups, the World Boxing Organization and the International Boxing 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
The first three groups prosper on sanction fees, often hundreds of thousands of 
dollars a fight, extracted from promoters who conduct championship bouts. They 
also issue ratings which, critics charge, are not objective but are instead 
manipulated for financial advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon urged that the Assn. of Boxing Commissions, the group meeting in Las 
Vegas, form a national boxing commission and regulate the sport in this country 
before Congress creates a federal boxing commission. 
</P>
<P>
Several bills were submitted in Congress during the 1980s, but all failed to 
gain support. More are on the way, the group was told. 
</P>
<P>
"If Congress does it, we'll wind up with non-boxing, politically appointed 
people running boxing, and that would end state boxing commissions as we know 
them," Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Sulaiman, president of the WBC, reached by phone in Mexico City, said he 
favors a U.S. federal commission and lashed out at his critics. 
</P>
<P>
"Randy Gordon criticizes me," he said, "but has Randy Gordon contributed even 
one dollar to help boxers? The WBC has paid for medical help for many, many 
boxers, and paid for medical research that might one day help boxers. 
</P>
<P>
"The WBC has accomplished more in the last 10 years for the safety of boxers 
than anyone else has in the last 200 years, and because of that, there is 
jealousy and contempt (in the United States) toward us." 
</P>
<P>
Duane Ford, a Nevada Athletic Commission member, after pointing out that 87 of 
128 championship fights in the world last year were held in the United States, 
also seemed to lean toward the concept of a national commission growing out of 
the Assn. of Boxing Commissions. 
</P>
<P>
"The only people who can clean up this sport are the people in this room," he 
told the group. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Nathenson, chairman of the California Athletic Commission, who relieved 
referees from the added task of scoring bouts by adding a third judge, has 
begun a campaign for another long overdue rules change -- the elimination of 
draws. 
</P>
<P>
Nathenson, who already criticizes California judges who score a round even -- 
"There's no such thing as an even round," he says -- wants it written into the 
state's ring rules that no round is to be scored even. 
</P>
<P>
That wouldn't eliminate draws, he admits, unless bouts were scheduled for five, 
seven, nine or 11 rounds. But he thinks the incidence of draws would be greatly 
reduced. Presently, he's rounding up votes to authorize a six-month trial 
period barring even rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Niss, once the busiest matchmaker in California, died recently of a heart 
attack. In recent years, he was also a boxing reporter for the Associated 
Press. . . . Young Kid McCoy, a prominent welterweight who fought often in Los 
Angeles in the late 1930s and early 1940s, died in Riverside Tuesday. In 1941, 
McCoy, whose real name was Adam Pianga, fought welterweight champion Fritzie 
Zivic to a 10-round draw in New York. 
</P>
<P>
A 12-man team of Irish amateur boxers will meet a Southern California all-star 
team on May 26 at Loyola Marymount. . . . Jorge Paez (35-2-2), International 
Boxing Federation featherweight champion, will fight Troy Dorsey (11-3-2) on 
July 8 at the Las Vegas Hilton in a rematch of their Feb. 4 fight, won by Paez 
on a disputed decision. . . . Attention Jerry Buss: Why is it OK to smoke at 
Forum boxing shows but not at Laker games? 
</P>
<P>
Sugar Ray Leonard's immediate future in the ring is very much up in the air, 
particularly since his wife, Juanita Leonard, recently hired attorney Marvin 
Mitchelson to represent her in a divorce action . . . Evander Holyfield, 
awaiting resolution of the legal mess resulting from heavyweight champion 
Buster Douglas' upset of Mike Tyson, has signed to fight journeyman Seamus 
McDonagh on June 1 at Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, N.J. . . . Tyson will meet 
Henry Tillman on June 16 at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
A highly placed source has this interpretation of the June 16 Caesars Palace 
doubleheader involving Tyson and George Foreman: "Bob Arum and Don King are 
trying to hurt Steve Wynn with that card by "teasing" the pay-per-view 
exhibitors. They're planting seeds of doubt that the fight Wynn wants at his 
Mirage Hotel, Buster vs. Holyfield, might not happen." . . . Tyson, at Monday's 
New York news conference where the doubleheader was announced, said of his 
upset loss to Douglas: "I was 100-1, and got my. . . . kicked." 
</P>
<P>
Tyson, by the way, is a father, according to the New York Post. The newspaper 
said Friday that the child, a boy, was born to Tyson's 24-year-old Los Angeles 
girlfriend, Natalie Fears. The paper also said that a Los Angeles dancer, Trena 
Archie, 22, had claimed in February that Tyson is the father of her infant son, 
too, but that the ex-champion has not admitted paternity in the case. . . . 
Dick Mastro, veteran Southland boxing expert, lists Douglas' record as 30-4-1, 
not 31-4-1. Mastro doesn't count a 1981 "knockout" victory claimed by Douglas 
over a Dan O'Malley in Columbus, Ohio. Mastro says photos of the fight showed 
that O'Malley wore headgear. Also, there was no admission charged for the bout, 
according to Mastro, and Douglas' father worked in O'Malley's corner. 
</P>
<P>
Rafael Ruelas, the Ten Goose featherweight who says that Jeff Franklin 
deliberately broke the right arm of his older brother, Gabe Ruelas, in a recent 
bout in Las Vegas, wants revenge. He instructed his manager, Dan Goossen, to 
arrange a match against Franklin, and Goossen is trying to make a July bout for 
network television. . . . Gabe, by the way, is healing nicely and will return 
to the gym in a few months. Dr. Robert Voy, who operated on Ruelas after the 
March 17 indicent, saw during surgery what had happened. "Gabe had broken the 
arm in the same place as a child and had never been treated, and the bone 
didn't heal properly," Voy said. 
</P>
<P>
Argentina has 115 municipal boxing commissions, according to recordkeeper Ralph 
Citro. . . . Arena Tijuana, the old fight emporium that boxing fans used to 
call "Tijuana's Olympic Auditorium," is now a church. The city's main boxing 
arena is the 5,400-seat Auditorio Tijuana, which routinely sells out its 
twice-monthly shows. 
</P>
<P>
Boxoffs for the U.S. amateur team in the Goodwill Games July 20-Aug. 5 in 
Seattle will be held June 8-9 at the Mirage in Las Vegas. . . . Former 
heavyweight contender Jerry Quarry, 44, was recently issued a boxing license by 
Wisconsin. . . . Don Muse's nine-month temporary appointment as assistant 
executive officer of the California Athletic Commission expires late this 
month, and he hopes to be named to the position full time.

A SILVER ENDING IS EXPECTED TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several weeks ago, it was predicted in this space that California was primed to 
have its fifth consecutive Kentucky Derby winner, and that Silver Ending was 
the leading candidate to follow the lead of Ferdinand, Alysheba, Winning Colors 
and Sunday Silence. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Derby Day No. 116 has arrived, and there's no reason to make any changes. 
</P>
<P>
A surprising 12-1 on Mike Battaglia's morning line -- the Churchill Downs track 
announcer's Eastern bias appears to be showing again -- Silver Ending deserves 
to be no worse than third choice behind Summer Squall and Mister Frisky. 
</P>
<P>
Winner of four of his eight starts, the Silver Hawk colt's lone poor 
performance came in the San Felipe Handicap on March 18. Hindered by a Santa 
Anita track on which passing was impossible all afternoon, he finished ninth, 
beaten by 15 1/4 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the race seemed to be a fluke, easily dismissed. Everything that 
has happened since then gives credence to this line of thinking. 
</P>
<P>
In his next start, the Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn Park, Silver Ending sat well 
off the fast pace, slipped through along the rail, then drew away to win by a 
bit more than three lengths in a quick 1:48 over a track labeled as good. 
</P>
<P>
Since the April 21 victory, trainer Ron McAnally's sophomore has worked well in 
Louisville -- he went six furlongs in 1:13 last Sunday -- and his 
come-from-behind style should play well in a Derby where the early pace figures 
to be fast. 
</P>
<P>
The way he finished at Oaklawn and in his earlier victories suggests that 1 1/4 
miles won't bother him. Neither should an off track, which is considered a 
possibility, or the move to Chris McCarron, who is no stranger to Derby 
success. 
</P>
<P>
Silver Ending's regular rider, Gary Stevens, is otherwise engaged today. He 
will be aboard Mister Frisky, who hasn't made any mistakes in Puerto Rico or 
California and will try to stay perfect in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
After perfect races in all three of his victories at Santa Anita, the son of 
Marsayas figures to be well placed once more in his bid to go 17-0. With his 
tactical speed, Mister Frisky is able to get position, and no jockey in the 
country is riding better than Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
The nagging doubt about the pride of Puerto Rico is the distance. Even though 
he drew away in the Santa Anita Derby, Mister Frisky didn't exactly finish with 
a flourish. Still, it's hard to be too critical of a horse that is unbeaten. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall is the 7-5 choice on Battaglia's line. His connections should 
hope the Storm Bird colt isn't favored at post time. Not since Spectacular 
Bid's race in 1979 has the favorite won the Derby, and several of them were 
embarrassed. Proud Appeal, the more highly regarded half of an entry, finished 
18th in 1981; Snow Chief was 11th in 1986, and Demon's Begone was pulled up 
when he bled a year later. 
</P>
<P>
Rain would be a help to Summer Squall, who won the Jim Beam and the Blue Grass 
Stakes in the mud. He is unbeaten in four starts on off tracks and is two for 
two at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
On a fast track, his chances would diminish, mainly because he seems suspect at 
1 1/4 miles. Also, he will be ridden by Pat Day, who hasn't exactly overwhelmed 
anyone with his efforts in the Derby and several other big races. 
</P>
<P>
Although Wayne Lukas will have three starters, Land Rush is his lone hope for a 
second Derby victory. The Nijinsky II colt appears to be coming up to his best 
race and finally figures to get the kind of fractions in front of him that he 
needs. Land Rush had two fast workouts over the track and will benefit from the 
distance. Real Cash and Power Lunch are the other Lukas entrants. 
</P>
<P>
Like Silver Ending, Pleasant Tap bounced back from a dull San Felipe showing to 
run second in the Blue Grass, but he doesn't seem quite up to this challenge. 
Thirty Six Red won the Wood Memorial and the Gotham Stakes in New York, but 
that parlay doesn't mean much anymore in terms of Triple Crown success. 
Unbridled's main claim to fame was a victory over a weak Florida Derby field. 
The others don't really matter. 
</P>
<P>
Royal Touch, who could have been voted the unluckiest horse of the recent Santa 
Anita meeting, will seek her first victory in the United States Sunday in the 
$100,000 Wilshire Handicap at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Beaten a nose by Brown Bess in the Santa Barbara Handicap after a head loss to 
Annoconnor in the Santa Ana, Royal Touch worked a half-mile in :47 2/5 on the 
turf Thursday morning. Charlie Whittingham's mare is the 121-pound highweight 
and will again be ridden by Russell Baze. 
</P>
<P>
Others in the field include Life at the Top, White Mischief II, Reluctant 
Guest, Stylish Star, Beautiful Melody and the entry of Estrella Fuega and Mamma 
Rosita. 
</P>
<P>
Successful in three of eight starts in England, Life at the Top dominated an 
allowance field on April 19 at Santa Anita. Trained by Neil Drysdale, she will 
be getting five pounds from Royal Touch, and Eddie Delahoussaye will be in the 
saddle. 
</P>
<P>
Reluctant Guest won the Senorita over this course last spring, Beautiful Melody 
is unbeaten in two starts on the grass and Stylish Star has also shown a 
fondness for the Inglewood grass. 
</P>
<P>
Olympic Prospect will be heavily favored to win the $110,200 Triple Bend 
Handicap today, one of two feature attractions on Hollywood Park's Kentucky 
Derby Day program. 
</P>
<P>
John Sadler will also send out Frost Free in the seven-furlong Triple Bend. 
Others in the field are Hot Operator, Twombly, Over the Pole, Joe Nasr, 
Prospectors Gamble, Timeless Answer and Raise a Stanza. 
</P>
<P>
Somethingdifferent and Warcraft top the field in the $111,050 Spotlight 
Breeders' Cup Handicap, which will be run as the sixth race at a mile on the 
turf. A 3-year-old son of Green Forest, Somethingdifferent is perfect in two 
U.S. turf appearances and has been worse than second only once in 10 races. 
Baze will ride for Richard Mandella. 
</P>
<P>
Warcraft will be making his turf debut for Whittingham after finishing third 
behind Mister Frisky and Video Ranger in the Santa Anita Derby. Robbie Davis 
has the mount. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister, who was so impressive while breaking his maiden the first 
time out for trainer Charlie Whittingham, will try racing against winners, 
around two turns and on the turf in today's ninth race. The Deputy Minister 
colt beat maidens by eight lengths on April 21 at Santa Anita, covering six 
furlongs in 1:09 2/5. . . . Because of the Kentucky Derby, there will be no 
early-bird wagering at Hollywood Park. . . . Robbie Davis won three races 
Friday, and Julio Garcia swept the double with longshots Hand's Secret ($19) 
and Miss Freezing ($21.80), then won the ninth race with Timeless Juan at 
$13.40.

The Greek Parliament elected elder statesman Constantine Caramanlis as the 
fifth head of state since democracy was restored in 1974 after a military 
dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
Caramanlis, 83, a six-time prime minister and former president, won 153 votes 
of the 299 cast. He needed a simple majority to be elected to a five-year term 
in the largely ceremonial post of president. In the first round of voting 
Monday, he fell short of the required 180 votes. Caramanlis was Greece's first 
prime minister after a 1967-74 military dictatorship, overseeing the return to 
democracy and establishing the presidency after holding a referendum that 
abolished the monarchy.

MURDOCK WILL KEEP PROMISE TO RESIDENTS, ASSOCIATE SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
LAKE SHERWOOD: THE DEVELOPMENT FIRM SAYS IT WILL PROVIDE FREE WATER AND SEWER 
SYSTEMS TO LONGTIME HOMEOWNERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A representative of billionaire David H. Murdock, developer of a 1,900-acre 
country club and housing project at Lake Sherwood, has assured Ventura County 
officials that Murdock's company will honor its promises to provide free sewer 
and water systems to longtime residents of the area. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Trotter, president of the Murdock company that is building the country 
club, made the assurances to county Deputy Public Works Director John Crowley 
this week, Crowley said. 
</P>
<P>
They followed news reports about complaints by residents that the developer was 
trying to renege on his promises and that the county grand jury, as part of a 
broader investigation of the Murdock project, was looking into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
The Murdock company's commitment to Lake Sherwood homeowners will be put in 
writing within the next month, Crowley said, as part of the developer's 
proposal to form a special district to tax all of the area's property owners 
for perhaps $20 million in improvements that Murdock has made around the lake. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, sewer and water fees assessed against the current 120 
homeowners would be paid by the developer, Crowley said. 
</P>
<P>
Those free services for longtime homeowners were stated or implied conditions 
of the County Board of Supervisors' approval of the Sherwood Country Club 
project in 1987, Crowley said. "But as far as I know, there's no binding 
agreement at this point," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Price, president of the Lake Sherwood Community Assn., welcomed the 
assurances. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what they promised if we would support their project," said Price, 
whose organization represents about three-fourths of lake-area homeowners. "I 
just wish we would have heard a firm commitment from the county and the 
developer earlier." 
</P>
<P>
The issue of who will pay for the sewer and water systems has been raised 
recently because of the Murdock company's request to the county that it be 
allowed to form the special assessment district. 
</P>
<P>
Another controversial element of the same proposal has been the developer's 
assertion that his 1987 agreement to dedicate Lake Sherwood itself to the 
people who buy his luxury homes was not a commitment to give it away. 
</P>
<P>
Murdock wants taxes against area property owners -- both the 650 at his country 
club and the 120 outside of it -- to repay him for the millions of dollars he 
has spent to fill the once-empty lake and to repair and improve it. 
</P>
<P>
"The only issue left is the lake," Crowley said. 
</P>
<P>
County administrators and lawyers huddled this week to try to decide how to 
respond on the lake dedication issue. They have reviewed letters, records and 
tape-recordings of meetings to determine Murdock's intent at the time of 
dedication. They have said they probably will decide Monday whether to 
challenge his position. 
</P>
<P>
The county is in a good position, Chief Administrative Officer Richard 
Wittenberg said, because none of the country club houses can be sold until 
county planners file documents with the state Department of Real Estate. 
</P>
<P>
Both Murdock's commitments to area residents and his pledge to dedicate Lake 
Sherwood are being investigated by the grand jury, county officials and lake 
residents said earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury also has questioned lake-area residents about Murdock's 
relationship with county officials, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the grand jury reported that a Murdock employee -- the only voter 
in an election to authorize taxes for maintenance within the country club 
development -- had voted illegally in January. He had moved from the site 
before voting, the jury said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the district attorney's office has begun a separate criminal probe 
into possible election fraud.

WORKING OFF THEIR CRIMES; 
</P>
<P>
SENTENCES: INSTEAD OF SITTING IN JAIL, AT A COST TO TAXPAYERS ESTIMATED AT $70 
A DAY, OFFENDERS PAY TO LABOR OUTDOORS FOR A VARIETY OF AGENCIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Scores of people are paying Ventura County $12 apiece today for the chance to 
pull weeds, rake sewage sludge, clear ditches or pluck litter from roadsides. 
</P>
<P>
They say it beats jail. 
</P>
<P>
"Two hours in that holding cell was enough for me," said John MacFarlane, 28, 
recalling his arrest on a reckless-driving charge that led to his conviction 
and a 20-day jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Like most of the 300 or so minor offenders who enter the program each month, 
MacFarlane chose work release over jail. An X-ray technician, he gets to spend 
nights at home, do his time according to his own schedule, work outdoors and -- 
as he put it -- "do something constructive." 
</P>
<P>
The county and other public agencies, meanwhile, get cheap labor and save jail 
space for serious offenders. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally believe that misdemeanants are the largest untapped resource in 
our society," said Tom McCarthy, who supervises the program. Instead of sitting 
in jail, at a cost to taxpayers estimated at $70 a day, inmates work for 
agencies such as Ventura County, Caltrans, the city of Ventura, the state 
Department of Parks and Recreation and several school districts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to gauge how much this saves taxpayers, because a lot of it is work 
that otherwise wouldn't be done," said Richard Humeston, division manager for 
the county's Corrections Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County government is the largest user of the program, with about 4,000 
man-hours a month, or the equivalent of 24 full-time employees to clean 
drainage ditches, clear brush from hillsides and landscape county buildings, 
among other things. The California Department of Transportation is next with 
3,000 man-hours, mostly devoted to picking up litter on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Before the program began two years ago, a lot of landscaping went undone, said 
Kathleen Van Norman, personnel officer for the county's General Services 
Agency. "Little things like raking, we could do only when we had a moment," she 
said. "Now we can schedule it regularly. I think the improvement is obvious." 
</P>
<P>
Officials stress that the intent is not to take away anybody's job, and Van 
Norman said she hasn't heard any complaints from fellow employees at the County 
Government Center. "In fact, they are all very anxious for this place to look 
good," she said. "Now they can do more important things." 
</P>
<P>
The Conejo Valley Unified School District started using the program three 
months ago at a number of schools. Supt. William R. Seaver said that officials 
are very pleased and that some of the work will save the district a lot of 
money. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a large ditch at Newbury Park High that they're keeping debris out 
of," Seaver said. "We had to spend $70,000 a few years ago to clean it out." 
</P>
<P>
Conejo Valley and other agencies that rely on the county to transport and 
supervise the inmates have to pay $18 per person per day. County government 
agencies and Caltrans, which provides vans and supervisors, pay nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County judges have authorized greater and greater use of work release 
in the past two years, Humeston said, with about 300 people entering the 
program each month. Even so, he said, "public agencies are waiting in line to 
get this labor." He said he expects more inmates to become available as the 
county struggles with jail overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
The county considers work release a break-even program. The $12 daily fee that 
inmates pay covers administrative costs. Occasionally, the fee is waived for 
someone who cannot afford the fee but who meets the program's qualifications -- 
basically, a sentence of less than 30 days for a nonviolent crime, McCarthy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Most participants have been sentenced to less than 10 days for offenses such as 
drunk driving, petty theft, probation violations or failure to appear on a 
traffic citation. About 80% are men. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very decent people who made a mistake," said Joan Stokesbary, a 
corrections employee who was supervising workers at the Santa Clara Landfill 
near Oxnard one day this week. 
</P>
<P>
That's how Donna Manning described her theft of three cartons of cigarettes 
from a Vons store -- a first offense that got her 12 days and a trip to the 
dump for weed-raking duty. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the stupidest thing I have ever done in my life," Manning said of her 
crime. "I don't know what possessed me." 
</P>
<P>
Although Manning, who lives in Oxnard, would "rather be having coffee at home," 
she said the work-release supervisors treat her well. At 58, Manning was the 
oldest of the people working at the landfill that day, and supervisors said 
they treated her accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not like a chain gang busting up rocks," supervisor Richard Berlin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Manning is doing her time one day a week. She and other participants said they 
like that flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way I could go to jail," said Tom Militello of Thousand Oaks, who 
was sentenced to 11 days for a probation violation. "I'd have lost my 
business." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Militello, 27, does his time two days a week and takes care of his 
landscaping accounts on the other days. On Tuesday, he planned to go from 
raking the landfill to tending his customers' yards. 
</P>
<P>
The program operates seven days a week, with up to 50 people on weekdays and 
more than 100 on Saturdays and Sundays. Participants have no say in where they 
are assigned. They show up at the program's office at the Camarillo Airport at 
8 a.m., and after a review of the rules they head off to their work sites, 10 
to a van plus a supervisor. Workers get two 15-minute breaks and half an hour 
for lunch, which they must bring from home. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they emphasize safety by issuing written rules and reminding 
workers of them each morning. Until recently, nobody in the county program had 
been seriously injured. On Sunday, however, Amadita Ramirez of Santa Paula was 
hit by an out-of-control van while picking up litter along a Ventura Freeway 
on-ramp. She had a punctured lung and other injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike offenders who are ordered to do community service -- which can be 
fulfilled a number of ways, without manual labor -- participants in work 
release have been sentenced to jail. They simply have the option of working 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes people don't feel like working. "I had a guy who told me it was too 
hot to work," McCarthy recalled. "I 'cuffed him and took him to jail." 
</P>
<P>
But officials said most participants have good attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to get rid of the anger before you come here," said MacFarlane, the 
X-ray technician convicted of reckless driving. 
</P>
<P>
"I had three speeding tickets before that," he said, as he broke up dirt clods 
with a dusty rake. "I thought I was above the law."

CRANSTON OPPOSES CHEESEBORO LAND SWAP; 
</P>
<P>
PARKLAND: THE SENATOR WANTS TO BLOCK THE USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS IN THE EXCHANGE 
OF 864 ACRES OWNED BY BOB HOPE FOR 59 ACRES NEEDED FOR AN ACCESS ROAD TO A 
PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) on Friday announced his opposition to a 
controversial land swap in Cheeseboro Canyon that would allow entertainer Bob 
Hope to begin commercial development of his Jordan Ranch in eastern Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston is the first California official to oppose the transfer with parkland 
in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his office, Cranston said he will urge a Senate 
Appropriations subcommittee to block the use of federal funds for the land 
swap. Federal money is needed for an environmental review of the land exchange, 
a Cranston aide said. 
</P>
<P>
"The denial of federal funds would effectively block the deal," Cranston said 
in his statement. 
</P>
<P>
Under the land-swap proposal, the National Park Service would get 864 acres of 
Hope's 2,308-acre Jordan Ranch. In return, it would give up 59 acres in nearby 
Cheeseboro Canyon so that developers could build an access road to a planned 
golf course and 750-house subdivision on the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
If the proposal is approved, Hope would sell 5,700 acres in the Santa Susana 
and Santa Monica mountains to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy for $20 
million, an amount that is considered lower than Hope could get from 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
But Cranston said "instead of permitting the land exchange . . . the Park 
Service should be seeking to acquire" the Jordan Ranch property to protect it 
from development. He said he would seek an appropriation of $33 million to 
enable the Park Service to purchase more land in the Cheeseboro Canyon area. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Hope nor developers interested in the property could be reached for 
comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's announcement was applauded by environmentalists, who said it will 
force other California officials to take a stand on the land-swap proposal. So 
far, Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) and Reps. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles) 
and Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) have not taken a position on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"We're thrilled," said Siegfried Othmer, a member of the environmental group 
Save the Open Space. "It's the breaking of the dam we've been waiting for." 
</P>
<P>
Elois Zeanah, another member of the group, agreed. "This is a significant 
step," Zeanah said. "This is the first time a federal official has come forward 
and taken a stand. They've all been hiding behind an iron curtain of 
neutrality. This will open the curtain for others. People can't hide anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy, who has supported the land swap, said he was surprised and 
disappointed by Cranston's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm somewhat shocked" that Cranston didn't talk to conservancy officials 
before making his announcement, Edmiston said. "I think he's been misinformed. 
I imagine that his position will change when he gets fully informed." 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston, who has been criticized for supporting the land deal, said the 
arrangement with Hope would free $10 million in conservancy funds that could be 
used to acquire thousands of acres of other environmentally sensitive property. 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston said he was not certain what effect, if any, Cranston's announcement 
would have in swaying other officials. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston said he will ask the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on the 
interior to triple President Bush's budget for buying land that should be 
protected. 
</P>
<P>
"I am dismayed that the National Park Service is opening the door to commercial 
development of Jordan Ranch, which should one day be national parkland," 
Cranston said. He accused the agency of "acting directly contrary to and 
subversive of its mission." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston called Cheeseboro "one of the jewels" of the national recreation area 
that received more than 500,000 visitors each year. 
</P>
<P>
"Californians tell me that the development would degrade the national 
recreation area, adversely affect the flow of a creek that provides water for 
parklands and destroy the wildlife corridor through Cheeseboro Canyon," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The developer working with Hope, Potomac Investment Associates, based in 
Gaithersburg, Md., has proposed building a tournament golf course and a 
community of 750 luxury houses on the Jordan Ranch, a mixture of rocky peaks 
and grassy meadows. 
</P>
<P>
But Potomac needs the 59 acres of national parkland to provide sufficient 
access to the ranch for a development that size. Both parcels in the land swap 
are within the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, a network of 
public parks and private land.

EDUCATION: MOORPARK COLLEGE'S NEW TRAINING FACILITY RECEIVES THE FIRST OF 200 
INHABITANTS. IT WILL BECOME THE COUNTY'S FIRST PUBLIC ZOO.

With a horde of photographers snapping their every move, Rosie and Fernando 
settled into their half-finished $2-million home Friday, high on a windy 
hilltop overlooking Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Rosie the baboon and Fernando Llama -- a llama, of course -- became the first 
animals to move into Moorpark College's new training zoo for the school's 
Exotic Animal Training and Management Program. 
</P>
<P>
When the long-awaited facility opens to the public, possibly in September, it 
will become Ventura County's first public zoo. 
</P>
<P>
"This facility will be different from any other zoo, in that we train animals," 
said program director Gary Wilson, unveiling the new zoo. "It will emphasize 
teaching people about the importance of animals, how they live in the wild and 
why we should be concerned about them." 
</P>
<P>
So far, college officials have spent $500,000 to erect cages and fences to hold 
the program's nearly 200 animals in the new zoo, Wilson said. The facility, 
with a sweeping mountain view, sits on a hill overlooking the original one-acre 
compound, which has housed the college's program since it was founded in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
When the new facility is completed, it will encompass about eight acres and 
include a 400-seat amphitheater, a replica of a tropical rain forest in a 
converted greenhouse, a reptile house, a children's exhibit and a gift shop and 
concession stand, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
The college has been seeking money to build a large facility ever since 
Moorpark officials first raised the idea of a zoo on the campus in 1978. 
College district officials subsequently approved the plan in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The college has raised an additional $500,000 in contributions to continue work 
on the zoo but needs $1 million more to complete it, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Moorpark College Foundation is overseeing the fund raising for the new 
facility, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Lloyd, vice president for administrative services, said the college is 
counting on grants, private donations and other sources of money to get the zoo 
ready for the public by this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark College is the only school in the nation to offer a scholastic program 
in zoo keeping and animal training, Wilson said. Santa Fe Community College in 
Gainseville, Fla., has a zoo-keeping program but does not offer animal 
training, he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 students are enrolled in the program, which teaches them to become 
animal trainers and zookeepers. This year's class of 21 students will graduate 
next week. Previous graduates have landed jobs in the motion picture industry 
as well as in zoos and other animal facilities worldwide, including the Madrid 
Zoo and Universal Studios in Florida, said Bill (Briz) Brisby, who founded the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"We started with one wolf on a chain," Brisby said of the program's beginnings 
in 1974. At its peak, the program had as many as 800 animals tended by student 
zookeepers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
About six years ago, college officials reduced the number of animals by about a 
third after the Humane Society found that some animals lacked adequate shelter, 
Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he said, the facility has had "a virtually spotless record." 
</P>
<P>
"We are a place where distressed animals are taken in when we can handle the 
situation," Lloyd said. "We have a very good reputation with people who care 
about animals." 
</P>
<P>
Next week, college officials will begin transferring other animals to the new 
cages. On May 14, two lions and two tigers will move to their new home. The 
transfer of all the animals, including a gazelle, a water buffalo, a sea lion 
and exotic birds and reptiles, will be completed by early June, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the zoo opens, the school needs to receive accreditation from the 
American Assn. of Zoological Parks and Aquariums. The facility also must be 
approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the state Department of Fish 
and Game. 
</P>
<P>
When it finally opens to the public, however, the zoo will still serve mainly 
as a teaching tool, Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our primary purpose is not the building of the zoo," Lloyd said. "It's the 
expanding of the educational facility for a program that's been in place since 
1974."

HUSTLER CARTOONIST SENTENCED TO 6 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cartoonist who created the Hustler magazine feature "Chester the Molester" 
has been sentenced to six years in prison for molesting a teen-age girl. 
</P>
<P>
Dwaine B. Tinsley, 44, of Simi Valley was convicted in January of five counts 
of sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
The Superior Court jury acquitted him on six additional sex charges involving 
the same girl but were deadlocked on five others, which were dismissed, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Matthew J. Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
Tinsley was known for his Hustler magazine cartoon series "Chester the 
Molester," which depicted an old man who is sexually attracted to children. 
</P>
<P>
Tinsley is free on $50,000 bail until Monday, when a hearing is scheduled to 
decide whether he can remain free while he appeals his case.

<P>
A Ventura city dump truck worth about $10,000 was destroyed after catching fire 
in the city garage Friday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A sprinkler system in the City Maintenance Garage at Thompson Boulevard and 
Sanjon Road put out the fire after it started about 4:30 a.m., preventing 
significant damage to the building, Ventura Police Officer Diane McCaskill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Smoke caused $500 worth of damage to the building, McCaskill said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was caused by an electrical short under the dashboard of the truck, 
which was being repaired, McCaskill said. CAROL WATSON

15-YEAR-OLD HELD IN THEFT OF ICE CREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 17-year-old ice cream vendor was beaten and robbed of 140 ice cream bars in 
Santa Paula, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Police took a 15-year-old girl into custody about 4:30 p.m. Thursday after 
discovering the vendor's cart turned over in her front yard and the bars 
stuffed in her freezer, Santa Paula Police Cmdr. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
The vendor, from La Tapatia Ice Cream of San Bernardino, was hawking the snacks 
from his pushcart on Pleasant Street when two males and a teen-age girl beat 
him and ran off with his cart, Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
The vendor's name is not being released because he is a minor, a Police 
Department spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The vendor, badly shaken by the experience, told police that he had been "hit 
all over," Gonzales said. But he did not require medical attention and was not 
taken to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
No money was taken. The robbers were after only the frozen goods, Gonzales 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Police discovered the cart on its side in front of the girl's house about a 
block away on Walnut Street, Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
Police are searching for the two males, believed to be juveniles, Gonzales 
said.

2 CONGRESSMEN BACK PROPOSITION 115 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reps. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) and Robert Lagomarsino (R-Ventura) on 
Friday announced their support for Proposition 115, the so-called "speedy 
trial" initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"It is long overdue that we start giving as much consideration to the victim as 
we do the criminals," Gallegly said. "Victims have civil rights as well as 
criminals." 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly and Lagomarsino said the June ballot measure will not only help speed 
trials, but ease jail crowding and reduce the cost of prosecuting criminals. 
</P>
<P>
If it passes, Proposition 115 would eliminate some pretrial hearings after 
grand jury indictments, give judges rather than lawyers the right to question 
jurors before trial and consolidate trials of multiple defendants accused of 
the same crime. 
</P>
<P>
The congressmen announced their support for the initiative at a news conference 
outside the Ventura County Government Center. Also attending and endorsing the 
ballot measure were Ventura County Sheriff John Gillespie, Assistant Dist. 
Atty. Toy White and Camarillo resident Patti Linebaugh, whose 2-year-old 
granddaughter, Amy Sue Seitz, was raped and murdered in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"I am outraged at the mockery of our court system, the intentional delays, the 
millions of dollars of taxpayers' money spent to protect the defendants," 
Linebaugh said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time for the voters of this state to demand their rights for an 
expeditious trial and swift carry-out of the punishment rendered. Use the 
taxpayers' dollars to prevent crime, not encourage it."

Agency Quits Perrier: The San Francisco firm Hal Riney &amp; Partners, which 
until recently created virtually all the ads for the troubled Perrier Group, 
has resigned the account in which it created ads for several Perrier-owned 
brands, including Arrowhead drinking water and Calistoga Sparkling Mineral 
Water. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the agency was fired from the $5-million account that 
created ads for Perrier Sparkling Mineral Water. "Perrier has been breaking up 
the account into a lot of pieces," said John Yost, general manager at the 
agency. "It seemed a good time to leave."

FEDERATED, ALLIED STORES LOSE $2 BILLION

Campeau Corp.'s Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores divisions posted 
losses of more than $2.1 billion in their fourth fiscal quarters, largely 
because of a writedown stemming from their bankruptcy reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
But the companies, which own nearly 260 U.S. department stores such as 
Bloomingdale's, Rich's and Lazarus, also reported that they posted operating 
profits for both the fourth quarter and full fiscal year ended Feb. 3. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe we have turned the corner on stabilizing the business and that we 
are well into a period of operational recovery," Allen Questrom, chairman of 
the two divisions, said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, troubled Toronto-based Campeau said it had proposed a business plan 
to its bondholders that includes the sale of real estate assets and a temporary 
halt in its interest payments. 
</P>
<P>
Campeau said it would ask holders of $184 million in bonds to waive any 
defaults and defer interest payments through Dec. 31, 1991. In return, the 
company would sell assets from its real estate holdings to reduce its debt. 
Campeau's real estate consists primarily of shopping malls, office complexes 
and businesses in the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Federated and Allied, together the nation's second-largest department store 
organization, have no stores in Southern California. They sought federal 
bankruptcy court protection from creditors on Jan. 15, citing the burden of 
$7.7 billion in debt. Much of the debt was incurred when Campeau acquired 
Federated in 1988 and Allied in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Federated lost $1.34 billion in the fourth quarter on sales of $1.59 billion, 
contrasted with a profit of $27.6 million and sales of $1.49 billion a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The results were affected by a $1.15-billion writedown of goodwill -- the 
amount over Federated's book value that Campeau paid to acquire the company -- 
an accounting move to reflect the deterioration of Federated's financial 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
The company had operating income of $48.6 million, down from $175.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
Allied lost $836.8 million on sales of $892.2 million in the quarter, 
contrasted with a profit of $37.6 million on sales of $869.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Allied's earnings were reduced by, among other things, non-operating charges of 
$660.3 million for its equity in Federated. Its operating income was $25.2 
million in the quarter, down from $86.2 million a year earlier.

TENTATIVE ACCORD COULD LIQUIDATE LINCOLN'S PARENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American Continental Corp.'s creditors said Friday they reached a tentative 
agreement with the federal government to liquidate the notorious thrift holding 
company and oust its controversial chairman, Charles H. Keating Jr. 
</P>
<P>
If it wins court approval, the pact will provide 22,000 mostly elderly 
bondholders and assorted other creditors with $21 million in at least partial 
repayment of the $200 million they invested in the Phoenix company, which is 
operating in Chapter 11 bankruptcy. American Continental is the former parent 
of the failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
A representative for Keating said the executive plans to resign as American 
Continental's chairman and chief executive next week to head a court-approved 
shareholders committee, which will take part in the Bankruptcy Court 
negotiations over the company's fate. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement would settle significant differences between creditors and 
Resolution Trust Corp., the government agency operating Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators hold Lincoln up as the epitome of everything that has gone wrong in 
the thrift industry. They estimate that the S&amp;L will cost taxpayers $2 
billion, one of the costliest thrift clean-ups in the nation. Federal 
authorities have launched an all-out attack on Keating through a series of 
criminal investigations and a $1.1-billion racketeering suit against him and 
his top executives. Keating denies any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the agreement have not been worked out but are expected to be 
announced by Friday, when the unsecured creditors' committee has said it will 
file its reorganization plan. history. 
</P>
<P>
The pact provides that American Continental's "estate will be liquidated and 
that those proceeds will be distributed first to the creditors," said Michael 
Manning, a Phoenix lawyer for Resolution Trust. The creditors and the 
government also would seek the removal of Keating and all top American 
Continental executives. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement in principle was announced in U.S. District Court in Phoenix and 
came as a surprise to Keating and his associates, who knew only that the 
creditors' committee and the government agency had been talking for the last 
two months. 
</P>
<P>
"RTC has simply refused to negotiate with us," said James J. Feder, a Los 
Angeles lawyer for American Continental. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement between the creditors and the government does not affect the 
racketeering lawsuit against Keating and others; American Continental's 
challenge of last year's federal takeover of Lincoln; and the lawsuits filed 
against Keating and others by holders of American Continental's debt 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
Those bondholders make up the bulk of the company's creditors and would benefit 
most under the agreement. Though the bondholders' payment hasn't been 
determined, lawyers in the case said talks have put the figure at about $14 
million, or nearly 7 cents on the dollar. The other $7 million would go to 
other creditors. 
</P>
<P>
The Bondholders are mostly elderly Lincoln depositors who were persuaded to buy 
nearly $200 million of the parent company's debt securities at the S&amp;L's 29 
Southern California branches. Many say they were misled into believing that the 
securities were insured or "as safe as Lincoln.

UNFLINCHING PURPOSE GUIDES ELOVICH PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH HERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Elovich is not the first observer to compare the scourge of AIDS with 
the genocide of the Third Reich. 
</P>
<P>
In his one-man play, "If Men Could Talk, the Stories They Would Tell," Elovich 
juxtaposes the attitudes and emotional states of men facing death in these two 
historically disparate but arguably parallel situations. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing works faster than fear," is his litany, but his subtext might read: 
"An individual's courage is equal to the specter of death." 
</P>
<P>
Elovich plays all six characters in his 70-minute tour de force at Sushi 
Performance Gallery, the second offering of this year's Neofest. It is no 
coincidence that the New York actor enters to the somber strains of a Bach 
Invention, since Elovich moves from one personage to another with the graceful 
facility of Baroque counterpoint. He projects serene composure, even when 
expressing rage, and his unself-conscious basso sets up a compelling cadence. 
</P>
<P>
Danny, a Jewish AIDS patient around whom the drama evolves, is treated by a 
Czech physician who is a survivor of Theresienstadt, Hitler's penultimate way 
station for Czech Jews on their way to annihilation. Because Danny is a 
comic-book illustrator by trade, the doctor wants Danny to document the 
doctor's experiences under the Nazis, which he narrates in great detail to his 
patient. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph, the flamboyant, gay biology teacher, is simultaneously the doctor's 
volunteer assistant, Danny's buddy during his declining health, and Danny's 
unrequited love interest from some unspecified, earlier student days. 
</P>
<P>
But, despite the eloquence that pervades Elovich's paean to survival, the 
artifice of coincidence mitigates his play's higher aspirations. That this 
single character should so seamlessly integrate Danny and the doctor seems 
cloyingly convenient. 
</P>
<P>
In a different context, where the characters' Jewish identity were not a 
central theme, Joseph would be an archetypal Christ figure, the compassionate 
servant ridiculed by society. Joseph may be Elovich's alter ego, because the 
program notes make no small issue of Elovich's commitment to political action 
on behalf of those living with HIV infection. By the play's conclusion, Joseph 
has moved from helpful volunteerism to an act of political confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
But this easy moral is only a part of 
</P>
<P>
Elovich's parable. The title comes from the play's last line, Danny's sad 
reflection about his father's silence. In a brief sketch, Elovich has Danny's 
mother interpreting his father's stony poses to her son. Elovich is far from 
silent, and his play is also a plea for men to break out of the emotional 
ghetto of masculine stoicism. 
</P>
<P>
Like most performance artists, Elovich writes his own material, but he wisely 
enlisted Cecil MacKinnon to direct and Michael Stiller to light his production. 
</P>
<P>
Under MacKinnon's cleanly analytical direction, Elovich traversed the sparse 
stage -- austerely occupied by a few chairs, a sleeping bag and an ominous 
hospital operating table -- with unflinching purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"If Men Could Talk, the Stories They Could Tell" which was first performed 
earlier this year in New York's Performance Space 122, ends its three-day run 
at 8 o'clock tonight at Sushi.

They beat Pete Bucher with gun butts. They kicked him with their boots. They 
threw him into walls. 
</P>
<P>
"Sonabitchi criminal!" they yelled. "Goddamned liar! Spydog!" 
</P>
<P>
They forced him to his knees. One put a pistol to his ear and cocked it. "Two 
minutes to sign, sonabitchi!" Quietly, he said: "I love you, Rose." He said it 
again. "I love you, Rose . . . " The pistol clicked. 
</P>
<P>
A ploy, Pete Bucher realized, and he regained some composure. So they beat, 
kicked and hit him again with their gun butts, in his stomach, head, neck, 
groin and kidneys. He retched, urinated blood.

They took him to a cellar room. A South Korean spy hung from the wall by a 
leather strap, naked to the waist, a jagged bone protruding from one arm, teeth 
bitten through his lower lip, one eyeball hanging on his cheek and dark liquid 
running out of its socket. He twitched, frothed at the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Bucher blacked out. When he came to, they told him they would take his 
crew, one by one, the youngest first -- and they would kill each man in front 
of him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll sign," Pete Bucher said. And he put his name to a confession that he was 
indeed a spy -- but a confession full of lies, as well. 
</P>
<P>
Late that night, he broke through the ice on the slop bucket in his cell. He 
thrust his head inside. 
</P>
<P>
He tried to drown. 
</P>
<P>
Today, in San Diego, Lloyd Mark (Pete) Bucher and his crew from the spy ship 
Pueblo will get medals. Twenty-two years after their capture and 11-month 
imprisonment at the hands of North Korea, the Navy that tried to punish Bucher 
and some of his men after they were released will take part in formal 
ceremonies honoring them as prisoners of war. 
</P>
<P>
The POW medals have not come easily. It took an act of Congress to get them. 
Pete Bucher knows well that many in the Navy would rather have seen him killed, 
shot to death in a battle at sea, than see him today being honored like this -- 
and he knows too well that people still feel uncomfortable about questions 
reopened by this ceremony, by the capture of the Pueblo and by what happened 
next. 
</P>
<P>
In a book, in articles and, most recently, in a long and reflective interview 
with The Times, Pete Bucher, in anger and occasionally in tears, has relived 
what happened to him and his 82 crewmen on the high seas in January of 1968, 
what happened while they were being held as American hostages in North Korea -- 
and, finally, what happened when they came home. In the interview, he addressed 
a number of these difficult, longstanding questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Why did you try to kill yourself? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I did it because when I was in submarines I had done all of the areas 
then currently in use by the Polaris missile submarines. . . . I worked for 
weeks on the coordinates of the areas they would be using. . . . Those areas 
were my product, and I really had sensitive stuff, and I mean a lot of stuff 
that you can't imagine. There were some lives at stake. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 They (the North Koreans) knew that I am a (former) submarine (officer). 
They've got my goddamn service record there (off the Pueblo), and they are 
going to start questioning me on stuff in there; and these Russians are going 
to come in here, and they won't have too much trouble breaking me down. . . . 
You know, they had shown me this guy, he is not going to live, this (South) 
Korean spy, and I couldn't believe that I had seen that. It was like a goddamn 
nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought: "If that happens to me, they are going to find out everything I 
know". . . I think: "I've got to get the hell out of here, because I won't be 
able to take what that poor bastard is taking down there (in the cellar.)" . . 
. So I went to my slop pail and thought: "I've got to get out of here" . . . 
and I made this attempt, and I could not do it. 
</P>
<P>
He was an orphan from Father Edward J. Flanagan's Boys Town, where he had 
fallen in love with football, even nicknamed himself "Pete" after Pete Pihos, a 
college football hero. In time, he went to the University of Nebraska on a 
football scholarship, where he took to Shakespeare and to martinis and to a bit 
of hell-raising. And he fell in love again, this time with a lovely farm girl 
named Rose Rohling. 
</P>
<P>
He and Rose were married and in time had two sons. He graduated with an ROTC 
commission in the Naval Reserve, became executive officer aboard the Ronquil -- 
and qualified for a submarine of his own. But then he got bumped by a staff 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
At Submarine Flotilla Seven in Japan, Pete Bucher had helped debrief the spy 
ship Banner, because its work meshed at times with covert submarine operations; 
and now the Navy was assigning him to become captain of the Pueblo, one of the 
Banner's sister ships. These were small surface vessels that steamed to 
communist countries, parked offshore and watched and listened. Much of the 
time, they worked for the National Security Agency, the nation's premier 
watcher and listener. 
</P>
<P>
The Pueblo, too, was an orphan, mothballed after long service as an Army cargo 
carrier in World War II. The Navy had adopted her and towed her to its 
Bremerton, Wash., shipyard. As a cover, she had been designated an Auxiliary 
General Environmental Research ship, and now the Navy was outfitting her with 
electronic gear. A Navy crane hoisted an oblong shack onto her deck. It had a 
steel door with three locks. The combinations were changed as often as weekly. 
</P>
<P>
Yard workers had no notion what the shack was. It was called the Special 
Operations Department -- the SOD-Hut. But Lt. Cmdr. Pete Bucher was aware of 
the electronics it would contain. He knew what he and the Pueblo would be 
doing, and he realized that his tubby little ship needed more than a new paint 
job. These urgent needs forced Pete Bucher into a running battle with the U.S. 
Navy over his new vessel, to wit: Her two gray, six-cylinder diesel engines 
sounded like rock crushers. To keep them from losing power and letting his ship 
drift into unfriendly waters, he asked the Navy to overhaul them. 
</P>
<P>
Request denied. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Equipment for the SOD-Hut included several pieces of classified gear: a 
Mark 10 IFF transponder, two tuners and various rotors to send data in code. He 
asked the Navy to install explosives so the gear could be demolished during 
attack -- to keep it out of enemy hands. 
</P>
<P>
Request denied. Instead, the Navy issued fire axes and sledgehammers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dozens of code books and other secret publications destined for the SOD-Hut 
were unlikely to be needed. He asked if he could leave some of them home. 
</P>
<P>
Request denied. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Navy made some weighted bags and said his men could stuff the secret 
documents into the bags and throw them overboard if necessary to deny them to 
adversaries. But that was cumbersome. So he asked for a fuel-fed incinerator to 
burn them if he had to. 
</P>
<P>
Request denied. 
</P>
<P>
 -- For emergency burning, the Navy offered him half of an empty 50-gallon oil 
drum. He declined. He located some paper shredders. But shredders would destroy 
only one sheet at a time. So he took money from his allowance for crew 
comforts, and he purchased a commercial trash incinerator. The device was not 
fuel-fed -- but it had to be better than an oil drum. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Navy ordered him to mount a 3-inch cannon on deck. It would have sunk 
the ship, or capsized her. 
</P>
<P>
Order withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Navy ordered him to install a pair of .50-caliber machine guns. He and 
his superior officer, Rear Adm. Frank L. Johnson, who was commander of U.S. 
naval forces in Japan, opposed it. The ship's mission was to conduct unarmed 
surveillance. The weapons would draw hostility; and then if any shooting 
started, they would hardly be large enough to be of much use. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Johnson told Bucher to stow the guns below. But that would violate 
the spirit of the order. So he finally said to install them on the deck, but to 
keep them hidden under tarps. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pete Bucher asked the Navy to put a scuttling system on the Pueblo, so he 
could sink her if necessary to keep her from being captured. 
</P>
<P>
Request denied. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He tried in vain to find some TNT, primer cord and fuses. He finally 
located some thermite bombs. But Navy regulations forbade thermite bombs on 
board. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Navy took his engineering officer below decks, pointed to two 
15-inch sea valves and handed him, without intending to be funny, another 
sledgehammer. 
</P>
<P>
Like her sister ship, the Banner, the Pueblo probably would be harassed as it 
parked on station to spy, the Navy told Pete Bucher. This meant a likelihood of 
some seagoing games of chicken. But if there was any unusual risk at all, 
briefers told him, his mission would be canceled. One told him, he recalls, 
that the Navy would retaliate against any forces that he could not handle by 
himself before help got there. 
</P>
<P>
Stay at least 12 miles offshore, the internationally recognized boundary for 
territorial waters, the Navy said. There was unspoken reciprocity: So long as 
Soviet ships stayed beyond this country's 3-mile limit, they could spy all they 
wanted. Underlying the mission was an unspoken assumption: that Soviet allies 
would honor Soviet understandings. 
</P>
<P>
During harassment, mind oceangoing rules of the road, the Navy said. Provoke no 
incidents. And above all, do not start a war. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy promoted Pete Bucher to commander and said: Don't worry. 
</P>
<P>
In 150 years, nobody had ever seized a U.S. ship on the high seas. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 11, 1968, the Pueblo set sail. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. When you got to the North Korean coast, off Ung Do Island, and North Korean 
gunboats attacked the Pueblo, tell me about your dilemma: Surrender or fight? 
Your ship or your men? 
</P>
<P>
 A. No. It was never a question of "surrender or fight." It was never a 
question of surrender with me. I never outwardly gave any indication that we 
were surrendering. I never hauled down our colors. 
</P>
<P>
 I had already determined by radar that our dead-reckoning position was 
accurate. We were about 16 miles out from the nearest island, which you know, 
is another 25 miles from the . . . mainland. . . . I was taking a perpendicular 
exit from the coast. I am keeping everybody (in Japan) informed of what is 
going on. I told everybody (on the Pueblo) to prepare to initiate emergency 
destruction (of classified material), and I am thinking: "This is going to be a 
good (harassment) drill for our guys, and we'll get together at dinner time 
tonight and evaluate how well our people responded." 
</P>
<P>
 Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! . . . And I got hit! . . . I thought: "Jesus Christ, 
(they're) serious!" 
</P>
<P>
 And I said: "Destroy classified material! All ahead full!" 
</P>
<P>
 I told Skip Schumacher (his operations officer): "Get a message off, 'We are 
under attack . . . I need help, and I need it immediately!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Our .50-caliber machine guns were no match for their 57-millimeter cannons. 
Ours were under tarps. The tarps were frozen solid. The only way to get to them 
was across decks being raked by guns. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 We saw a couple of MIGs. One fired. I found out later that there were 25 MIGs 
up there. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 We abandoned the flying bridge and went into the wheelhouse. . . . Tim Harris 
(his supply officer) was just nervous as hell, and I didn't blame him, but he 
didn't smoke, you know, and he said: 'How about a cigarette, Captain?' And I 
said: 'Here, take the whole pack. . . .' Tim was smoking, and he was drawing on 
that cigarette so fast the ashes were just disappearing. . . . A goddamn shell 
comes through the port side window, and I could see it in midair, and it comes 
through the damn wheelhouse, and it goes this far (he indicates 3 inches) from 
Tim Harris' ear, and this shell explodes through the front window and goes on 
out and hits the ocean out there and exploded. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus Christ! Tim doesn't even know! . . . He is still smoking!! 
</P>
<P>
 I am trying to ring the phone (to the SOD-Hut) to find out how destruction is 
going . . . but I'd picked up one phone and was ringing another one. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 We bring the ship to all stop. The shooting stops. 
</P>
<P>
 So I went below and went variously around the ship to see how the destruction 
was going. 
</P>
<P>
 Not well. 
</P>
<P>
 And I said: "Goddamnit, Steve (Harris, head of SOD-Hut detachment), get this . 
. . stuff over the side!" 
</P>
<P>
 And old Steve said: "Yes, sir." And he said: "They are shooting at our smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 And I said: "What . . . are you talking about?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dumb, stupidly, I had the ship ventilation shut down to protect watertight 
integrity; and having these guys burning stuff, the whole damn ship was filling 
up with smoke. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Radio says to me: "There are F-105s on the way" 
</P>
<P>
 So I thought: "Hell, we are a long ways out here. Let's play like we are going 
to follow these guys, and our guys will get here in time, and we'll make a run 
for it." So I put her back up to one-third speed. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I went below again to see (how the sledgehammering, axing, burning and 
jettisoning was going on -- and brought Pueblo to another stop to buy more 
time.) 
</P>
<P>
 Bam! Bam! Bam! And (it) starts again. 
</P>
<P>
 And those guys who were down there got the brunt of it doing the destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 One guy got killed. He got blown apart. (Several others were wounded, one 
critically.) . . . When they start banging us, I am thinking, you know: "If my 
guys are gonna have a chance, there has got to be help from our side. We're 
going to probably lose some people here, but let's not throw them away by 
continuing to do something that isn't going to help us. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will hurt us in the long run, it'll hurt the country. It'll hurt 
everything if this whole thing becomes a total disaster and we lose everybody. 
Then they are going to go to war out here. (Then) what the hell is going to 
happen? 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys (his own men) have no way to defend themselves. And I am not going 
to have them killed for nothing. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 I knew that we were going to be taken . . . I figured: " . . . they (U.S. 
planes) ain't never going to get here now." And it's pretty obvious that we 
were going to get boarded. 
</P>
<P>
 I had protest signals flying. There was somebody in the (Korean) boat who 
spoke English just a little bit, and I said: "I absolutely protest this and 
demand that you stay off of this ship," and the guy said: "F--- you, buster. 
We're coming." 
</P>
<P>
 And they did. 
</P>
<P>
Overwhelmed by four P-4 torpedo boats, two SO-1 gunboats and a brace of MIGs, 
the Pueblo was taken into Wonsan harbor. A North Korean hauled her colors down. 
</P>
<P>
By Pete Bucher's account, his crew had managed to smash or to throw overboard 
all of her secret gear -- including the secret rotors used for code. But she 
carried so many secret documents -- and had such poor means of destroying them 
-- that many fell into North Korean hands. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Bucher and his men, including the wounded and the body of Duane Hodges, 
the crewman killed at the height of the attack, ended up at Pyongyang, in a 
building with thick concrete walls. They called it The Barn. Bucher and some 
officers were put into isolation cells. Most crewmen were thrown into four-man 
cells, some 12. A North Korean doctor operated on the worst of the wounded -- 
beneath a bare light bulb hanging from the ceiling, without anesthesia. 
</P>
<P>
For individual and group confessions, the North Koreans beat and kicked the 
crewmen mercilessly, stripped them to their shorts, then beat and kicked them 
more, until their shorts were soaked red with blood. Guards put square table 
legs behind their knees; made them squat until they lost all feeling below 
their thighs; tied their hands; forced them to hold a chair above their heads 
-- and when they could hold the chair no longer and it fell, the guards clubbed 
them and made them run across the floor on their knees again and again, until 
their legs were bloody. 
</P>
<P>
They beat one man until he begged to be shot. One guard liked to place his 
machine-gun muzzle between the crewmen's eyes and fiddle with the safety. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the men prayed for nuclear retaliation, even though they knew they 
would be at ground zero. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to their spy confessions, Pete Bucher and his men admitted falsely 
to intruding into North Korea's territorial waters and said they had tried to 
provoke war. The North Koreans staged propaganda press conferences, where the 
crewmen told the world about their "crimes" and "misdeeds." 
</P>
<P>
But they sent signals to discredit what they were doing. Bucher was the 
inspiration: One day he flashed his middle finger in a guard's face and told 
him it was "an Hawaiian good luck sign." His crew caught on. They flashed "the 
Hawaiian good luck sign" in their propaganda performances. They filled their 
admissions with ridicule about what they were saying: 
</P>
<P>
"I was to be trained by none other than Commander Buzz Sawyer. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"(Before leaving for North Korea) I visited the kingpin of all provocateurs, 
including spies, none other than Fleet General Barney Google . . . 
</P>
<P>
"(With regards to a friend) Garba Gefollows" -- garbage follows. 
</P>
<P>
Bucher's favorite was a confession he wrote, trusting that the North Koreans 
would find in their English-language dictionaries that an obscure noun he was 
using as a verb meant nothing more than a song of praise -- and that Americans 
back home would read the word phonetically: "We not only want to paean the 
North Korean government," Bucher wrote in 
</P>
<P>
blissful rhapsody, "but to paean the North Korean people as well." 
</P>
<P>
At last, the North Koreans thought, Bucher and his men seemed to be 
cooperating. And in return, they eased up on the torture. 
</P>
<P>
They moved Pete Bucher and his crew to better quarters. 
</P>
<P>
But then one day, the North Koreans got back one of their propaganda pictures, 
published abroad. It showed some of the crewmen offering Hawaiian good luck. 
</P>
<P>
The caption said: "The Navy has made fools of (North Korea)." 
</P>
<P>
So began hell week. 
</P>
<P>
They beat one man for 16 hours, used the chair and the table legs for another 
five hours and beat him again for 15 hours more. 
</P>
<P>
They broke a second man's jaw. 
</P>
<P>
They beat a third man for 39 hours straight -- hundreds of blows with a pole 
two inches thick. And when it broke, they beat him with the pieces. And when 
those broke, they came up with still another pole, and it was twice as thick. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What's worst when you're being held hostage? 
</P>
<P>
 A. The real problems, I think, are not the beatings so much as the degradation 
that we went through. Being made to crawl, you know, and being spit on. . . . 
Hearing people yelling, knowing I'm the commanding officer and I can't do a 
thing for them, and I just got to thinking: "The goddamn government has 
forgotten that we're over here. How can that be? Why isn't there some kind of a 
raid here to get us out of this place? Why isn't something happening?" And I 
let myself get down. This is your mind kicking you in the butt. . . . You have 
to let your spirit control your mind. Your soul has to drive you, and you've 
got to tell your mind to knock it off. . . . And here comes down the 
passageway, having been beaten to hell, a guy named (Earl) Kisler, and his head 
is like a basketball, he's been beaten so bad. I looked at him and I just . . . 
He is on his hands and knees. He's crawling, you know, they've got him 
crawling, and he turns his face to me. I was just overwhelmed at what they had 
done to this guy, and he gives me this grin, see, with the blood all in his 
mouth, and he gives me this thumbs up (tears come to Pete Bucher's eyes and he 
stops, then tries to continue). 
</P>
<P>
 I just can hardly talk about it (he stops again and fights for control). 
</P>
<P>
 I just thought . . . (Pete Bucher breaks down, and he cries). 
</P>
<P>
I thought: "I'll never let the bastards get me down again." 
</P>
<P>
The planes never came: Not from the nuclear carrier Enterprise -- whose 
commander had said four of its F-4s probably could have reached the Pueblo 
before the North Koreans put her ashore at Wonsan; not from other carriers in 
the region; not from South Korea nor from U.S. bases there. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody, least of all the Navy, authorized any kind of a mission to save the 
Pueblo, any attempt to rescue her crew or any effort to retaliate against North 
Korea for taking an American ship, killing a crewman and torturing 82 other 
Americans while holding all of them, including the injured, in prison for 
nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
The United States finally gained freedom for Pete Bucher and his men by doing 
exactly what he and his crew had done: confessing -- even to lies -- then 
discrediting the admission of any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
The confession was signed by the senior U.S. negotiator at Panmunjom. He was 
far too formal to offer Hawaiian good luck. 
</P>
<P>
He simply stated that his confession was false. 
</P>
<P>
North Korea accepted it. 
</P>
<P>
When Pete Bucher and his men and the body of Duane Hodges returned home, the 
Navy ordered Bucher, all of the surviving crewman and others involved in their 
fate to testify at a Court of Inquiry. For eight weeks, they were questioned 
about the loss of the Pueblo and whether her captain and crew had violated the 
U.S. military Code of Conduct, which forbids anyone taken captive to tell more 
than name, military rank and serial number. 
</P>
<P>
The only admiral in the Pueblo chain of command who was called to account was 
Frank Johnson, who had told Bucher to cover his guns. 
</P>
<P>
Despite testimony about Pete Bucher's difficulty with the Navy at the Bremerton 
shipyard, nobody summoned any of the top brass responsible for outfitting his 
ship. Despite evidence that the Pueblo's mission should have been re-evaluated, 
perhaps even canceled, nobody summoned the Pacific Fleet commander, or any top 
officers from the Pentagon, or anybody at the National Security Agency or the 
State Department. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the Court of Inquiry said that Pete Bucher and Steve Harris should 
be court-martialed and that the Pueblo's executive officer admonished -- for 
their roles in permitting the ship to be seized and failing to complete 
destruction of classified material. Johnson was to be reprimanded, along with a 
captain subordinate to, among others, the commander of the Pacific Fleet. 
</P>
<P>
But the Pacific Fleet commander, to whom the court reported, ordered that both 
the Bucher and the Harris court-martials be changed to reprimands. He toned 
down Johnson's reprimand. And he vetoed action against the captain who was 
partially under his own command. Finally, on May 9, 1969, the secretary of the 
Navy stepped in. He said he wanted nobody to be punished. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody, he decided, had suffered enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Did the Navy oppose the POW medals? 
</P>
<P>
 A. They said attorneys for the Department of Defense (DOD) made the decision 
that my men were not eligible. Well, attorneys make decisions based on what 
somebody tells them to do. . . . It may have originated at the Navy side. Who 
knows? You could never pin that down. . . . It's not just the medals. There are 
benefits that you are assured, which are associated with medical care in VA 
hospitals, if you are certified as a POW. . . . You never quite relinquish the 
responsibility you have for people who had problems created for them while they 
were in your service, and we've got some of these kids that are 100% disabled. 
Half of them have some disability. . . . These guys got in that situation by 
(being beaten) over and over in that goddamn North Korea. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I was furious about (being denied the medals) . . . I wrote to the chief of 
Naval Operations last year . . . and the chief of Naval Operations sent me back 
a letter saying they're not going to fight with DOD. . . . I wrote to (Sen. 
Pete) Wilson (R-Calif.) Never had an answer. I had an answer back from (Sen. 
Alan) Cranston (D-Calif.), but nothing was ever done. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What about the rest of the California delegation? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Nothing got done. It was a congressman from Massachusetts (Rep. Nicholas 
Mavroules, D-Mass.), who is chairman of an Armed Services subcommittee, who had 
hearings. I got three guys from the crew, and we testified. The Navy sent over 
Vice Adm. (J.M.) Boorda, the chief of Naval personnel, and he gave a statement 
in strong support. Mavroules put in a bill and got it passed, and the President 
signed it in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Then we get this letter from the Navy with a form to fill out for the medal. 
And I said: "Now these bastards are going to send it out in a plain brown 
envelope." When they gave it to the rest of the POWs, there was an incredible 
ceremony, and all. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know why the government doesn't bring the guys out here and pay their 
expenses. The government has responsibility to these men. I don't give up my 
responsibility for what happened to these men under my command, and I don't 
think the government should, either.... 
</P>
<P>
 But we're getting it done ourselves -- a ceremony out here (with contributions 
from supporters for plane tickets and some free lodging). In some ways, it's 
best, you know, that way. 
</P>
<P>
 You're not having to kiss somebody's ass. 
</P>

<P>
The Bush Administration lost its first test of wills with Violeta Barrios de 
Chamorro when an assistant secretary of state, Bernard Aronson, came here to 
warn her against keeping Sandinista Defense Minister Humberto Ortega as head of 
the army. 
</P>
<P>
"But Senor Aronson," replied the opposition publisher who had defeated the 
Sandinista revolutionaries in national elections. "Nicaragua is a family. We 
have to find peace among ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
That exchange, a week before her April 25 inauguration as Nicaragua's 
president, is repeated by Chamorro's aides to portray her as more than a 
matriarchal figurehead. The 60-year-old widow may be a political novice, they 
say, but she is tough-minded in defense of a few guiding principles. 
</P>
<P>
More significantly, the "family" analogy used by Chamorro served to remind her 
American visitor of the web of blood ties, personal loyalties and business 
partnerships that spread across the Nicaraguan political divide like so many 
bridges, even after eight years of war and 30,000 dead. 
</P>
<P>
In a country of 3.5 million people, such networks have as much to do with 
politics as the polarized labels -- Sandinistas, UNO, Contras -- that they 
belie. They help explain the delicate arrangements that eased the first 
peaceful turnover of power from one political force to another in Nicaragua's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, people voted to get rid of the Sandinistas, but in the Nicaraguan family 
the Sandinistas are all mixed up with the others," said a lawyer who worked 
first for the Sandinistas, then for the Contras and now for Chamorro. "We are 
not as uncomfortable with each other as you might think." 
</P>
<P>
In challenging President Daniel Ortega in the Feb. 25 election, Chamorro ran as 
the candidate of the National Opposition Union (UNO), a 14-party alliance 
embracing everyone from Communists to former Contras. Many politicians and the 
rebels who remain armed see her margin of victory -- 56% to 41% -- as a mandate 
to sweep the Sandinistas off the stage. 
</P>
<P>
But in the Nicaraguan tradition of presidential supremacy, Chamorro quickly 
spurned the coalition. Like the Somozas and the Ortegas who preceded her, she 
rules with a team of family advisers. 
</P>
<P>
Foremost among them is Antonio Lacayo, 43, her son-in-law and chief of staff, 
who shunned revolutionary politics while thriving in agribusiness with 
Sandinista partners. Her political strategist is Alfredo Cesar, 38, who is 
married to Lacayo's sister. A master of shifting allegiances, Cesar fought with 
the Sandinistas against Somoza, then directed Contra strategy against the 
Ortegas. 
</P>
<P>
More intent on reviving the war-battered economy than bashing the Sandinistas, 
the two men, both U.S.-trained civil engineers, quietly negotiated a pact with 
the outgoing government to minimize abrupt changes and conflict. 
</P>
<P>
In the new order, the Ortega brothers keep temporary control of a reduced army 
while a more radical Sandinista faction gives up the police. Chamorro's forces 
dominate the elected National Assembly but Sandinistas share its leadership 
posts and are ready to make alliances. Most Sandinistas retain their civil 
service jobs and confiscated homes. After flexing its muscles with strikes just 
before Chamorro's inauguration, the Sandinista labor movement is restraining 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro aides involved in the pact are, like the Sandinista comandantes, men 
in their 30s and 40s. They supported the 1979 Sandinista guerrilla takeover, 
then turned against the revolution's leaders but remain on good terms with many 
who stayed loyal. 
</P>
<P>
"Our generation are the moderates of this country, the ones who told our 
parents, 'Calm down, don't be such thieves,' " said one aide. "We made the 
previous revolution and now we are making this one." 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Hurtado, Chamorro's minister in charge of the police, "is not going to 
put us all on planes to Cuba," said Vanesa Castro, a comandante's wife who 
recruited him into the Sandinista movement in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Sanchez Sancho, a Chamorro power-broker in the new Assembly, is the son of 
prominent Sandinista lawmaker Luis Sanchez Salgado. A photo of father and son 
embracing on the assembly floor last week was published by newspapers here as a 
symbol of cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
When Daniel Ortega went to Chamorro's house to concede the election, he found 
one of his ministers, Alejandro Martinez Cuenca, already there and chatting 
amiably with Lacayo, a high school classmate. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a clandestine coalition, a secret understanding to keep the country 
going," said Dionisio Marenco, a Sandinista from the same class. 
</P>
<P>
Lacayo is a cousin of Maj. Gen. Joaquin Cuadra and Col. Osvaldo Lacayo, 
Sandinistas who are second and third in the army chain of command behind 
Humberto Ortega -- a relationship that helped Ortega win Chamorro's trust. 
</P>
<P>
Family ties help explain another controversial Chamorro decision -- to let the 
leftist guerrillas of El Salvador keep an office here for political activity. 
Two of the president's four children are Sandinistas and are close to the 
Salvadoran guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
"In Nicaragua, families continue to be more important than ideologies," said a 
commentary in La Cronica, a weekly newspaper. "The close family relations 
between the parties in conflict at least make it possible for them to be 
cordial and lower their voices in private discussions." 
</P>
<P>
The loudest conflict in Nicaragua today is between Vice President Virgilio 
Godoy and the Chamorro camp. Chamorro ignored objections by UNO's political 
council, which Godoy leads, to keeping the army in Sandinista hands. After he 
sniped at the decision, she barred him from setting up offices alongside hers 
in the Casa Presidencial. 
</P>
<P>
The feud has split the UNO coalition into two factions, with eight of the 14 
parties supporting Godoy, and threatened to undo the Contras' agreement to 
disarm their forces, now observing a truce, by June 10. 
</P>
<P>
"The National Opposition Union will continue being the opposition, because this 
is not a new government but simply a new facade," Godoy declared. "They don't 
realize that to leave Gen. Ortega in place is to leave a spider that will trap 
them in its web." 
</P>
<P>
In a country that traditionally changes governments by force, Chamorro's aides 
acknowledge the risks of such a pact. But they repeat an old Nicaraguan dictum 
that has defused potential civil wars before: Better a bad deal than a good 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a transition government," one aide said. "The first fully democratic 
government will be in 1996 (when Chamorro's term ends). This is just a bridge." 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro's 13-man Cabinet is dominated by businessmen and technocrats with few 
ties to organized politics. Just one minister is an UNO party leader, while 
four are former Sandinistas. Health Minister Ernesto Salmeron is a pediatrician 
who treats the children of Sandinista comandantes and Chamorro's grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Not represented at all is the Superior Council of Private Enterprise, a 
traditional business group, led by militant anti-Sandinistas. Businessmen in 
the new Cabinet come from newer, more conciliatory power centers -- the 
Commission on the Recovery and Development of Nicaragua and the 
Harvard-affiliated Central American Management Institute. 
</P>
<P>
"This sector of the bourgeoisie, rather than reject everything that smells of 
Sandinismo, sees many of the revolutionary transformations as the basis for a 
new kind of capitalism for the year 2000," said a serious analysis in the humor 
magazine Semana Comica that was headlined, "All Power to the Yuppies."

GORBACHEV IS STILL FULLY IN CHARGE, KEY ADVISER SAYS 
</P>

<P>
Rejecting Western speculation that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is under 
intense pressure from the Soviet military, one of his top advisers said Friday 
that the country's political leadership is still fully in charge in the Kremlin 
and that it remains committed to Gorbachev's reform program of perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander N. Yakovlev, a member of the Communist Party's ruling Politburo, 
dismissed as completely unfounded recent assertions by Bush Administration 
officials in Washington and NATO analysts in Brussels that the Soviet army had 
demanded policy changes from Gorbachev and apparently had forced him to retreat 
in arms control negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no basis for the claim that Gorbachev had to somehow change his 
policies in response to (military) pressure," Yakovlev told a news conference. 
"We do not see any grounds to suspect that our army is hatching some kind of 
plans against the party, against the leadership. We do not believe this is the 
case." 
</P>
<P>
Yakovlev, reviewing the domestic political scene as well as Soviet foreign 
policy, said that he wanted to calm widespread Western speculation that 
portrays an embattled Gorbachev confronted with immense political and economic 
problems at home and consequently under increasing military pressure not to 
make concessions abroad. 
</P>
<P>
While such speculation is common in advance of key Soviet-American meetings 
such as the Soviet-American summit in Washington starting May 30, the current 
round is being used to explain reported shifts in Moscow's positions in the 
strategic arms reduction talks with Washington and the Vienna negotiations to 
reduce conventional forces in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
As read here, the implication in much of the Washington speculation is that 
Gorbachev is not fully in charge, that the Soviet military might balk at the 
agreements he makes and that, as a result, the United States and its partners 
in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should be cautious in making deals 
with a man who might be gone tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
Also implied in this speculation is a Soviet responsibility should the 
negotiations fail to produce agreements, once regarded as all but certain, 
before the Washington summit. 
</P>
<P>
Yakovlev specifically denied a NATO intelligence report, released in Brussels 
on Thursday, that the Soviet military had mounted a show of force, reportedly 
arming 6,000 cadets, during massive anti-government protests here in late 
February as a warning to Gorbachev that it was ready to take over if political 
instability increased. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no movements of military personnel," Yakovlev said, "and no 
pressure was applied to Comrade Gorbachev. No demands were made on the 
government." 
</P>
<P>
However, Yakovlev, the most prominent liberal in the Kremlin leadership, did 
assert that "ultra-rightists," by which he appeared to mean a wide variety of 
groups all along the country's political fringe, are working to bring Gorbachev 
down and to destroy his political and economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the anti-government, anti-party demonstrations during the May Day 
parade in Red Square on Tuesday, Yakovlev confirmed that Gorbachev and other 
leaders, including himself, had left the reviewing stand because of the angry 
protests directed at them. 
</P>
<P>
"The leadership left the tribune and left it for political reasons, being very 
strongly in disagreement with the ultra-right, conservative positions being 
expressed by people who had come onto the square," Yakovlev said. 
</P>
<P>
"My conviction is that this was an action by the ultra-right and those who 
stand behind them. For us, with our difficult and tragic history, it is simply 
impermissible to try to turn history back, which means to head into the abyss. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that all the country's democrats, all normal, decent and 
clear-thinking people . . . should be on their guard and see the very real 
danger," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Perestroika and its leaders are now under threat, Yakovlev added, from 
extremist groups that he characterized as "ultra-right" -- though in Western 
political terms they appear to be on the far left -- and as "conservative," 
though they are even more disdained by conservatives within the Communist 
Party.

INDEPENDENCE DECLARED BY LATVIAN PARLIAMENT 
</P>

<P>
Latvia, dealing another blow to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's hopes for a 
new Soviet confederation, passed a declaration of independence Friday that now 
puts all three Baltic republics legally on record as wanting to get out of the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The republic's Parliament, meeting in the capital, Riga, approved a 
proclamation restoring independence after an undetermined transitional phase. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our last possibility to survive, and we are going to take advantage of 
it. That is why we demand independence," Alberts Bels, a writer, told his 
fellow deputies. 
</P>
<P>
With the Latvian legislature's action -- boycotted by representatives of the 
republic's large Russian community and other ethnic minorities -- all three 
Baltic republics, which were forcibly incorporated by the Kremlin in 1940 as 
spoils of a nonaggression pact with Nazi Germany, now have set separation from 
Moscow as their goal, though at different speeds. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow has taken harsh measures, including economic sanctions, to try to force 
the neighboring republic of Lithuania to back off the unilateral independence 
declaration it adopted March 11. 
</P>
<P>
But the Latvians plotted a course that they believe will spare them such 
treatment. First, they mandated a transitional period that deputies said could 
last as long as four years to allow time for negotiations. Also, they did not 
repudiate the Soviet constitution or laws as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
Their path was similar to that taken by lawmakers in the third Baltic republic, 
Estonia, who in March shied away from declaring immediate independence, 
announcing instead the start of a transitional period that is supposed to 
eventually lead to full self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate reaction from Moscow to Latvia's action. Soviet Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Vadim P. Perfiliev said last month that Latvian leaders were 
told in a meeting with Gorbachev that "the adoption of unilateral measures 
contradicting Soviet constitutional order would lead to the immediate 
termination of negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
But the Latvians, in a clear attempt to avoid a head-on collision with the 
Kremlin, ruled that parts of the Soviet constitution are still in effect that 
do not conflict with the restored clauses of their homeland's pre-Soviet 
constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"For 50 years we have waited for the renewal of our state," Janis Kinna, a 
leader of the pro-independence Latvian People's Front, told the republic's 
Supreme Soviet, or Parliament, in Riga. By a vote of 138 to 0, with one 
abstention, it voted to restore four articles of the 1922 constitution of 
then-independent Latvia, the first of which declares: "Latvia is an independent 
democratic republic." 
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers also stripped the designation of "Soviet Socialist Republic" from 
their homeland, deeming that it should now be known as "the Latvian Republic" 
or simply Latvia. 
</P>
<P>
When the results of the voting were announced by loudspeaker in Riga, several 
hundred people assembled in front of the Parliament building began to cheer. 
Inside and outside, people joined in to sing "God Bless Latvia," the republic's 
anthem. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the lawmakers' precautions, a backlash seemed certain from many in this 
republic, where ethnic Latvians account for only 54% of the population. Leaders 
of the Russian minority, a full one-third of Latvia's 2.7 million people, vowed 
a protest strike and said they would ask Gorbachev to impose direct rule from 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Some voiced fears that Soviet officialdom would deal as harshly with them as it 
has with Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
"If we pass this declaration, Moscow will do the same thing to Latvia," Leonids 
Alksnis warned his fellow 196 deputies before the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Non-Latvian lawmakers also complained they were shown only a draft text of the 
declaration on the day they were supposed to vote on it. But other deputies 
said Latvians had already waited 50 years for restoration of the independence 
their homeland had enjoyed between the two world wars, and the chamber voted, 
139 to 56, to consider the issue without delay. 
</P>
<P>
A two-thirds majority of 132 votes was needed for the declaration, and 
pro-independence forces cleared that hurdle with six votes to spare. 
Fifty-seven lawmakers boycotted the balloting, with the pro-Soviet "Equality" 
group calling the declaration unconstitutional and counter to the wishes of 
many of Latvia's residents. 
</P>
<P>
Alfreds Rubiks, leader of the republic's pro-Moscow Communist Party, warned of 
giant street protests and crippling strikes if the declaration were passed. He 
then walked out of the Supreme Soviet chamber. 
</P>
<P>
A protest strike over the independence declaration was tentatively scheduled 
for May 15. Igor V. Lopatin, leader of the ethnic Russian-dominated Inter-front 
movement, said more than 100 factories have formally pledged to take part, and 
that more were expected to join. 
</P>
<P>
"We have also decided to form a Committee for the Defense of Soviet Power in 
Latvia," Lopatin said in a telephone interview. He said the committee would 
send delegates to Moscow to ask Gorbachev and the national legislature to 
impose presidential rule in the republic. 
</P>
<P>
As the vote on independence neared, scores of protesters from the republic's 
ethnic minorities gathered on Riga's Cathedral Square, carrying signs demanding 
that Latvia not follow the example of Lithuania, its Baltic neighbor to the 
south. 
</P>
<P>
The president of Lithuania, Vytautas Landsbergis, had attended the opening of 
the Latvian Parliament Thursday and recommended that it move as fast as his 
homeland to restore independence. The reelected president of Latvia, Anatoly 
Gorbunov, reaffirmed his commitment to independence, but noted that, unlike 
Landsbergis, he expects no help from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be naive to expect care packages of help from the West," Gorbunov 
said. "The world is not going to risk what has been achieved in arms control 
and what has been achieved with Mikhail Gorbachev for the sake of 5 million 
Balts." 
</P>
<P>
To force the Lithuanians to seek independence through the procedure laid down 
by a recently approved Soviet law, which mandates both a referendum and a 
five-year transition period, Gorbachev has cut supplies of oil and natural gas 
to the republic. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Alexander N. Yakovlev, a member of the ruling Soviet Politburo, 
repeated the central government's position that the leaders of Lithuania must 
suspend their independence proclamation before the Kremlin will agree to 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"You freeze your widely proclaimed declaration, and let's talk," Yakovlev told 
a news conference. He insisted that Moscow is offering Lithuania "an easy way 
out" of the impasse, but Landsbergis has said repeatedly that no retreat is 
possible on the declaration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet republic of Latvia declared itself "an independent democratic 
republic" -- a move that is supported by most ethnic Latvians. About 54% of the 
2.7-million population is Latvian. The rest of the republic's people are from 
other ethnic groups, mostly Russians, and many of them oppose independence. 
Slightly larger in area than the state of West Virginia, Latvia saw an upsurge 
in nationalism following Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's perestroika 
reforms. Last October, the Latvian Popular Front drew up a program for an 
independent, multi-party state. Friday's decision by Parliament, which is 
controlled by pro-independence forces, is the first stage of a process intended 
to take the republic out of the Soviet Union. But in a conciliatory gesture to 
Moscow, Parliament voted to set aside key practical issues for future bilateral 
talks and called for a transition period.

A recent weekend pleasure cruise by Jordan's King Hussein was abruptly 
interrupted when an Israeli naval patrol boat fired shots nearby, Israeli 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The king thought they were shooting at him and ordered his boat to flee into 
the coastal waters of Saudi Arabia. The Israelis say they were only clearing 
their guns. 
</P>
<P>
The incident took place last Saturday in the Gulf of Aqaba at the head of the 
Red Sea and was revealed six days later in the newspaper Haaretz. No one was 
hurt, although the shooting may fuel already mounting ill will between Israel 
and neighboring Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
According to Haaretz, Hussein said that the Israelis pursued his vessel and 
fired repeatedly at him. The royal yacht was accompanied by a Jordanian patrol 
boat, but it did not fire back. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Defense Ministry here said that no boat pursued Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
"No shots were fired by the Israeli navy at King Hussein's yacht, and no chase 
was conducted," the spokesman said. He termed the firing a "routine weapons 
check." 
</P>
<P>
He added that "Israel naval units have longstanding and clear orders regarding 
rules of conduct during the passage of King Hussein's yacht, and in the 
incident noted, the Israel naval vessel acted in accordance with these 
instructions. 
</P>
<P>
"We assured Jordan it won't happen again," the spokesman concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the incident, Jordanian officials asked the United States, 
which is friendly to both governments, to intervene with Israel. William Brown, 
the U.S. ambassador to Israel, met with ranking Israeli officials Tuesday to 
express King Hussein's "outrage" and the Bush Administration's "concern" about 
the potential implications, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the sources said, the Israelis promised to issue strict 
instructions to Israeli sea patrols to ensure that no further incidents take 
place. U.S. envoys then relayed the assurances back to the palace in Amman, the 
Jordanian capital. 
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the meetings, a State Department spokesman said Friday that the 
United States "felt comfortable" with Israeli assertions that the incident was 
"inadvertent." 
</P>
<P>
Sources for Haaretz, a liberal daily, asserted that the firing was no accident. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody could have had any doubt that the king was on the boat," the paper 
quoted a source as saying. "He was standing on the deck, and it was possible to 
identify him easily." 
</P>
<P>
Privately, a U.S. official in Washington said the Israeli explanation was 
"highly unusual." Administration sources believe, however, that the Israeli 
government "did not purposely open up on the king of Jordan." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said that the Israeli response has not fully satisfied Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, tensions have been mounting between Israel and Jordan over 
repeated attempts by renegade Jordanian soldiers to cross into Israel and 
attack border settlements. There have also been incidents of rockets fired into 
Israel from Jordanian territory by Palestinians who infiltrated from Syria. 
</P>
<P>
Rightist Israeli politicians have asserted that Hussein's rule over Jordan is 
illegitimate and that Palestinians who make up the bulk of the population there 
should wrest control of Jordan from him. These rightist Israelis assert that 
this would get rid of the Palestinian demand for an independent state in the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel occupies. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein, alarmed by such talk, has stepped up contact with Iraq, which has the 
Middle East's most powerful army and has voiced threats to use chemical weapons 
on Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Robin Wright, in Washington, contributed to this story.

DIPLOMACY: PROSECUTORS' ACCUSATIONS THAT POLICE CHIEF WAS INVOLVED IN CAMARENA 
MURDER

Allegations by U.S. prosecutors that the current Mexico City police chief 
attended a meeting to plan the 1985 murder of an American drug enforcement 
agent are "irresponsible" and "unproven," the Mexican government charged 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials said the accusation against Police Chief Javier Garcia 
Paniagua would further strain U.S.-Mexican relations, which suffered a setback 
last month with the abduction from Guadalajara to the United States of a 
Mexican doctor charged in connection with the murder. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, one-time president of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, has 
not been indicted in the February, 1985, torture and murder of U.S. drug agent 
Enrique S. Camarena. But federal prosecutors in Los Angeles asserted in a court 
memorandum that Garcia attended a meeting of 10 traffickers and Mexican law 
enforcement officials in Guadalajara in October, 1984, at which they determined 
that "something would have to be done" about Camarena. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexico City police chief is a member of an old-line political family from 
Guadalajara -- his father was a defense minister -- and is the only person 
mentioned in connection with the case who currently holds a government post. 
</P>
<P>
At different times, he has been a federal senator, minister of labor, minister 
of agrarian reform and commander of the now-defunct federal security police, 
several of whose members have been implicated in drug trafficking, murder and 
other crimes. He was once considered a likely successor to President Jose Lopez 
Portillo. 
</P>
<P>
"It is worrisome and irresponsible to put out information, which is probably 
even generated by drug traffickers, to stain the names of Mexican officials and 
citizens without any proof or evidence," the Mexican attorney general's office 
asserted in a statement issued Friday. "This irresponsible attitude, on the 
part of those who issue these versions and those who disseminate them, reduces 
the effectiveness of the fight against drug trafficking." 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. Enrique Alvarez del Castillo issued the statement upon his return 
from Santa Fe, N.M., where he met with his U.S. counterpart, Dick Thornburgh, 
to discuss bilateral drug enforcement relations and the April 2 kidnaping of 
Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain from Guadalajara. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican attorney general was "not satisfied" with Thornburgh's explanation 
of the kidnaping, said a source close to Alvarez del Castillo. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh reportedly told Alvarez del Castillo that the doctor's kidnaping and 
clandestine transfer to the United States was the idea of Mexican authorities. 
Mexican officials charge that the Drug Enforcement Administration arranged the 
abduction, and they have issued an arrest warrant for a Los Angeles-based DEA 
informant who admitted to organizing the operation. The doctor was flown across 
the border to El Paso, where he was arrested by DEA agents, and is now awaiting 
trial in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A source in the attorney general's office said the U.S. government is now 
accusing Garcia "to make it look like they are doing something to fight drug 
trafficking. They don't know what else to do. Next, they'll be charging my 
grandmother." 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican official, who declined to be identified, said the allegations 
against Garcia would "renew tensions" between drug enforcement agencies from 
the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's the proof?" asked the source. "They should put forward the proof if 
they are going to make these charges." 
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. side, there have been accusations that Mexican authorities have 
engaged in a cover-up in the Camarena case, but Alvarez del Castillo has 
maintained that all those involved have been brought to justice.

SOUTH AFRICA: LONGTIME FOES CHATTED AND BANTERED GOOD-NATUREDLY. 'THIS SHOULD 
HAVE TAKEN PLACE YEARS AGO,' SAID ONE ANC OFFICIAL.

<P>
Only a few minutes after they sat eye-to-eye over a long, rectangular 
conference table here this week, South Africa's mortal enemies realized 
something important about each other. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody in the room understood that there was nobody here who had horns -- 
that we had people in the room who are perfectly reasonable," said Thabo Mbeki, 
the African National Congress' foreign affairs chief. "And everybody realized 
then that this should have taken place years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Those opening minutes set the tone for three days of talks that concluded 
Friday with an agreement, which carried historic importance not so much for 
what it said but for the fact that it said anything at all. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC and the government have been at odds for all of the ANC's 78 years, and 
at war for the past 30. Successive South African governments have painted the 
ANC as a Communist-led band of terrorists bent on destroying all that is good 
and decent. And they have jailed ANC leaders, forced them into exile and driven 
them underground. 
</P>
<P>
That ended three months ago when President Frederik W. de Klerk lifted the ban 
on the ANC. And Friday, in a building named for the architect of apartheid, 
Hendrik Verwoerd, the past seemed a distant memory. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson Mandela, only 11 weeks out of prison, was smiling and sharing his first 
news conference with De Klerk as the most notorious ANC leaders mingled amiably 
with their government foes. 
</P>
<P>
"The striking feature of the discussions has been their cordiality," said 
Mandela, the 71-year-old deputy president of the ANC who went to prison 27 
years ago for launching the "armed struggle" against Pretoria. "We have had 
discussions on serious matters in a spirit of conciliation and understanding." 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk returned the compliment. 
</P>
<P>
"I appreciate the good spirit and the earnestness and the honesty which was a 
hallmark of these discussions," De Klerk said. 
</P>
<P>
The talks also included good-natured bantering as the two delegations shared 
cocktails and several meals during the three days of talks on the grounds of 
Groote Schuur, a mansion once occupied by prime ministers. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, ANC foreign affairs head Mbeki, in exile for nearly three 
decades, referred to Roelof F. (Pik) Botha, the government's long-serving 
foreign minister, as "my deputy." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure that Pik was very pleased with that," Mbeki said later, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
When Botha and Joe Slovo, the head of the South African Communist Party, 
engaged in a loud, friendly conversation after another session, ANC executive 
committee member Ruth Mompati jokingly suggested to Law and Order Minister 
Adriaan Vlok that he have Botha arrested. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk welcomed the interaction, saying it allowed the two sides "to get to 
know each other and learn what makes them tick. It built better understanding." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela said his delegation decided early on "to let bygones be bygones . . . 
and conduct discussions without bitterness." 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk was asked if the genial spirit of the talks didn't make him regret 
having waited so long to legalize the ANC and free Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
Looking slightly uncomfortable, De Klerk said: "I'm just glad we're able to 
look forward rather than back."

DRUG-FREE NORIEGA BANK FUNDS SOUGHT; 
</P>
<P>
FAIR TRIAL: JUDGE ASKS PROSECUTORS TO FIND MONEY THAT COULD BE LEGALLY USED TO 
PAY THE STRONGMAN'S DEFENSE LAWYERS.

A federal judge Friday ordered government prosecutors to detail the contents 
and whereabouts of 27 seized bank accounts of Panamanian strongman Manuel A. 
Noriega, following a motion by Noriega's defense lawyers to withdraw because 
they have not been paid. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega, who is imprisoned on drug charges, "must have acquired some assets of 
his own in 20 years in the Panamanian army free of taint (of drug deals)," said 
U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler during a meeting in open court. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, who seized the accounts under U.S. law allowing such action if the 
money is believed to be the product of drug dealing, previously indicated the 
total value of the accounts is about $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
According to Noriega defense attorney Frank Rubino, Noriega has been paid at 
least $11 million over the years by the U.S. government for his work as an 
informant. He received another $7 million from other governments, Rubino said. 
</P>
<P>
Differentiating between what he called monies that are "the product of drug 
dealing," and those "from other sources" is critical to the defendant's right 
to a fair trial, Hoeveler said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have got to recognize that our justice system is on display, and that 
(Noriega) is entitled to be represented to every extent possible by those he 
wants to defend him," said Hoeveler. 
</P>
<P>
Rubino, who represented Noriega for about 18 months before the U.S. invasion of 
Panama led to Noriega's arrest and transport to the United States on drug 
charges Jan. 4, says Noriega is penniless. He said that earlier this year a 
friend of Noriega's had given him "less than $100,000" for legal costs, "but 
that was quickly eaten up." 
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler called Noriega's lawyers and prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney's 
office together in an attempt to end a week of squabbling over money. On 
Thursday, three days after his motion to withdraw, Rubino subpoenaed the CIA, 
the Drug Enforcement Agency and the National Security Agency for records of 
money paid to Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Michael Sullivan said the government did not object to 
providing a list of the accounts, but he said all of them, except one, were in 
foreign banks. 
</P>
<P>
"Foreign governments will have some interest (in the money) and their laws will 
prevail over those assets," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said that defense attorneys' reasons for requesting withdrawal are 
"simply untrue and disingenuous. 
</P>
<P>
"Stripped of its misleading and unsupported allegations, counsel's argument 
represents an attempt to require the government to pay defense counsel a higher 
fee," said Sullivan's motion, which added that " . . . counsel's desire for 
large fees is no legal or ethical justification for withdrawal." Attached to 
the prosecutors' eight-page motion was an affidavit from Cynthia R. Hawkins, an 
assistant U.S. attorney, who said that during a January hearing in Orlando on 
another case, she and Drug Enforcement Administration special agent David 
Willis heard Rubino say the retainer he had been paid to represent Noriega was 
"in the seven figures." 
</P>
<P>
Rubino dismissed that allegation as "foolishness." 
</P>
<P>
"What I said was that the attorneys' fees alone are in the seven figures. But I 
haven't received that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega, being held in a federal jail here, is scheduled to come to trial next 
Jan. 28.

The Army on Friday disclosed that it has lodged murder charges against two more 
soldiers who were part of the American forces that invaded Panama on Dec. 20, 
1989, in the military operation to topple dictator Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
The first case was brought last month against a Ft. 
</P>
<P>
Bragg, N. C., sergeant, charged with killing an unidentified Panamanian man who 
surrendered to U.S. troops after a grenade attack had been made on their 
roadblock, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The second case, which Army officials did not disclose last month, although the 
information could have been made public under military procedures, involves the 
death of a 50-year-old Panamanian woman, shot in a brothel Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers implicated in the slaying are also accused of mishandling firearms 
and disobeying orders not to have "sexual contact" with Panamanian women and 
other orders forbidding the use of alcohol during their deployment. 
</P>
<P>
The dead woman was identified as Leila Diaz de Panay, according to Maj. L. D. 
Walker, an Army spokesman at Ft. Ord, Calif., where the soldiers were attached 
to the 7th Light Infantry Division. Walker declined to provide any further 
details on the circumstances surrounding her death. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Paul Finsel Jr., 25, of Arkoma, Okla., and Pfc. Mark McMonagle, 20, of 
Philadelphia, were charged with murder. Finsel also was charged with conspiracy 
to obstruct justice, impeding the investigation into the charges, leaving his 
company against orders and losing his 9-millimeter Army pistol. 
</P>
<P>
A third soldier, Pfc. Marc M. Gussen, 19, of Teaneck, N. J., pleaded guilty to 
firearms, alcohol and obstruction of justice charges at a hearing April 23 at 
Ft. Ord. He was sentenced to two years in prison and was to be given a 
dishonorable discharge.

As the Philadelphia Inquirer prepared to appeal a record $34-million libel 
judgment, media experts said Friday that the ruling raises serious 
constitutional questions and will likely be overturned. 
</P>
<P>
A Common Pleas Court jury on Thursday awarded $2.5 million in compensatory 
damages and $31.5 million in punitive damages to Richard A. Sprague, a former 
first assistant district attorney. He sued the paper over stories published 17 
years ago that questioned his actions as a prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
The award was the largest ever against the news media. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unimaginable to me that a punitive damage award in this amount could or 
would be upheld," said Floyd Abrams, a prominent First Amendment lawyer. He 
represents NBC in appealing a $5.3-million libel judgment won by entertainer 
Wayne Newton. 
</P>
<P>
"This is another example of libel law running amok," Abrams said. "I think that 
this case and others will sooner rather than later lead the Supreme Court to 
address the constitutionality of punitive damages in libel cases." 
</P>
<P>
Henry Kaufman, general counsel of the Libel Defense Resource Center, a 
media-sponsored clearinghouse in New York, said only two libel judgments of 
more than $1 million have been affirmed on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Sprague, now a successful attorney in private practice, won for the second time 
before a jury in the case. The Inquirer had earlier successfully appealed a 
$4.5-million verdict -- less than one-seventh the amount of Thursday's award, 
which Sprague said gave meaning to the idea of punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
"I intend to fight to maintain it," Sprague said Friday. "The whole theory of 
punitive damages is that it should not just be a little slap on the wrist." 
</P>
<P>
Inquirer executive editor and president Eugene L. Roberts Jr. said the 
newspaper would appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
The award amounts to about one-third of the newspaper's net worth, said the 
Inquirer's attorney, Samuel E. Klein. Roberts said the newspaper would be able 
to stay in business if the judgment stands, "but we would be crippled."

A federal jury decided Friday that a businessman was not lying when he said 
Reagan-Bush campaign officials asked Iranians not to free American hostages 
until after the 1980 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
The jury acquitted Richard J. Brenneke of five counts of false declaration to a 
federal judge in Denver when he made statements describing an alleged 1980 
meeting in Paris at which he said the request about the hostages was made. 
</P>
<P>
One of the counts involved Brenneke's general description of the meeting. He 
also was found innocent of making false declarations when he said the meeting 
was attended by the late CIA director William J. Casey and by Donald Gregg, now 
U.S. ambassador to South Korea, and that he and fellow businessman Heinrich 
Rupp both worked for the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
Brenneke was not charged in connection with his statement to the judge that 
Rupp flew George Bush to Paris in 1980. Brenneke testified Thursday that Bush, 
who was elected vice president later that year, was not at the meeting he 
attended and he did not see him in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
The unanimous verdict was announced after five hours of deliberation. Brenneke 
was embraced by his attorney, Michael Scott, and the two men clasped hands. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom, a smiling Brenneke said: "We told the truth, we told the 
truth all along and, by God, it was believed." 
</P>
<P>
Brenneke was indicted on the false declaration charges after he appeared in 
1988 as a character witness for Rupp, who was being sentenced for bank fraud in 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
In his statements to the judge, Brenneke portrayed Rupp as a friend with whom 
he worked in Southeast Asia for the CIA proprietary, Air America. He told the 
judge that he and Rupp had helped arrange the clandestine Paris trip. 
</P>
<P>
Brenneke said there were three meetings about the hostages on Oct. 19 and 20 at 
the Hotel Florida and Hotel Crillion in Paris. Brenneke told the Denver judge 
he attended one meeting at the Hotel Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal law, false declaration to a judge is a stronger charge than 
perjury, which can involve lies to either a judge or jury.

INSURANCE PRICE PLAN STRUCK DOWN; 
</P>
<P>
PROP. 103: A JUDGE RULES AGAINST PROPOSAL BY COMMISSIONER GILLESPIE TO SUPPRESS 
ZIP CODES AS A BASIS FOR SETTING AUTO PREMIUMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles judge on Friday struck down Insurance Commissioner Roxani 
Gillespie's auto insurance pricing plan that suppressed ZIP codes -- or 
neighborhoods -- as a basis for setting premiums and ruled out use of gender 
and marital status in pricing. Gillespie was ordered to draft a new plan. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Miriam A. Vogel said Gillespie's plan, announced last Dec. 6, must fall 
because pricing of auto insurance has to continue to be cost-based. Vogel said 
that where one lives is an important factor. But she said the part of 
Proposition 103 that the commissioner cited for justification of her plan is 
inconsistent with another part of the measure and must yield to it. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, Vogel ruled that Gillespie's freeze on auto 
insurance rates, announced last Oct. 2, will be allowed to continue 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
The practical effect of the ruling was that Los Angeles and other urban drivers 
will not be getting the rate decreases that Gillespie promised. On the other 
hand, rural and many suburban drivers will not be getting the small increases 
implied when she issued the plan. Current rate structures, under which city 
drivers, particularly in minority and low-income neighborhoods, pay the most 
will stay in effect. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie's attorney for Proposition 103 matters, Karl Rubinstein, vowed to 
appeal Vogel's ruling against the commissioner's pricing plan to the state 
Court of Appeal and seek a stay of the injunction against the plan Vogel said 
she will issue next week. 
</P>
<P>
But the effect of Friday's rulings was once again to delay implementation of 
key provisions of Proposition 103. Vogel specifically said the insurance 
companies will now not have to file new rating plans on May 11, as Gillespie 
was demanding. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen months after the initiative was approved by the electorate, its most 
important parts -- the new pricing plans, rate rollbacks and rate regulation 
according to a fair rate of return formula for the companies -- remain in 
limbo. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie vowed last May, for instance, to make all rate rollback decisions by 
last November, ruling which, if any, companies would have to give rebates of 
premiums. But six more months have passed and she has yet to make a decision 
regarding a single company. 
</P>
<P>
Even when she does set fair rate of return standards for the companies, her 
decision is subject to court appeal, as would be subsequent decisions on which 
companies, according to these standards, will have to roll back their rates and 
give their customers rebates. The appeals process could take years. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer advocates were discouraged by Vogel's decision, with Proposition 103 
author Harvey Rosenfield saying it guts a substantial part of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
But even some insurance company lawyers expressed weariness with the legal 
process and a few pointed out that the freeze on rates that Vogel supported 
Friday has already lasted seven months and seems sure now to last beyond the 
November election. 
</P>
<P>
To that extent, the insurers' lawyers said, Gillespie has been successful in 
that she has stopped what had been a high rate of annual auto insurance price 
increases for the better part of a year. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel is now charged with hearing virtually all litigation involving 
Proposition 103 -- more than a dozen cases. She won the role after the 
appellate courts denied a motion of bias filed against her by Gillespie, who 
believes that Vogel favors the insurance companies too much in her rulings. 
</P>
<P>
In her tentative written ruling Friday, which she indicated might be revised 
slightly before being made final next week, Vogel reiterated that "negative 
social implications" of current insurance rates, such as charging the poor the 
highest rates, cannot be allowed to be decisive considerations in ruling 
whether a regulation passes muster. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Gillespie's regulations were socially desirable, the judge wrote, they 
"are simply not a proper basis for excluding (pricing) factors that . . . (are 
a) sound actuarial basis for fixing rates." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, in mandating substantially lower rates in the cities while allowing 
insurers to recoup only part of the difference with slightly higher rates in 
rural areas, Gillespie was virtually ruling out the possibility that the 
insurers could receive a fair rate of return on their total business, Vogel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel added that there was "no substantial evidence" that Gillespie is 
justified in giving special price advantages to urban areas, regardless of the 
higher accident and claims rates in those areas.

GOVERNOR SIGNS ETHICS BILL HAILED AS REFORM

<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian on Friday signed a sweeping ethics bill designed to 
crack down on the lucrative payments and gifts that California legislators 
routinely collect from special interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
Long sought by organizations such as Common Cause, the legislation marks the 
most significant effort yet by the Legislature and the governor to remove the 
taint of corruption from the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
"We're happy to see that state government has finally responded to the people's 
demand for a higher standard of ethical conduct," said Brenda Robinson, a 
spokeswoman for Common Cause. "We're delighted that he has signed this. This is 
really landmark legislation." 
</P>
<P>
Authored by Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), the 
measure would ban speaking fees, limit gifts to $250 and restrict lobbying by 
officials after they leave office. 
</P>
<P>
The new ethics code would apply not only to the Legislature, but to the 
governor and his appointees as well. However, key elements of the law would 
take effect only if voters approve Proposition 112 on the June 5 ballot, a 
measure that would set the stage for a pay raise for legislators. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Deukmejian has been skeptical of proposals to impose stricter 
standards of conduct on elected officials, arguing that the best way to have 
honest government is for the voters to elect honest candidates. 
</P>
<P>
But legislative leaders of both parties, spurred into action by a long-running 
federal corruption investigation in the state Capitol, urged the Republican 
governor to sign the measure into law. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to help the Legislature's image and they're going to be able to go 
out to the public and point out they have taken these steps," said Michael R. 
Frost, the governor's chief of staff. "From that standpoint, it could be 
helpful. But as the governor has said, the primary way to enforce ethics is to 
elect ethical people." 
</P>
<P>
The reputation of the Legislature has taken a beating in recent months with the 
conviction of Sen. Joseph B. Montoya of Whittier on corruption charges and the 
indictment of former Sen. Paul Carpenter of Downey on similar counts. A Los 
Angeles Times Poll found that most voters believe it is commonplace for 
legislators to accept bribes. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers have long been under fire for accepting thousands of dollars in 
speaking fees and gifts from special interest groups that are seeking 
legislative action. Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), for 
example, reported receiving more than $130,000 in honorarium payments during 
1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"The approval of this legislation should help in restoring the public trust 
that elected representatives are working for their constituents and not for 
special interests," said Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno, a 
co-author of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Said Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), a member of the Assembly Ethics 
Committee: "This was a long time coming and it's a final recognition of the 
fact that business as usual is not acceptable in California." 
</P>
<P>
Backers of the measure say that the new law, combined with the passage of 
Proposition 112, will create the strictest code of conduct for elected 
officials anywhere in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Legislators, the governor and other top officials would be prohibited from 
accepting speaking fees. They also would be barred from taking more than $250 
from each source per year. In addition, they would be prohibited from lobbying 
their former colleagues or subordinates for 12 months after leaving office. 
</P>
<P>
All three of these provisions would take effect only if the voters approve 
Proposition 112, which would create an independent commission to set the salary 
of legislators, the governor and other elected state officials. 
</P>
<P>
Other provisions of the measure become law with Deukmejian's signature and take 
effect Jan. 1, 1991, including the first penalties ever for 
conflict-of-interest violations by legislators. The law also will require 
legislators and lobbyists to attend ethics education courses and will prohibit 
members of the State Board of Equalization from voting on matters affecting 
campaign donors who contributed more than $250. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara), chairman of the Assembly Ethics 
Committee, said the legislation "defies the cynics who didn't believe we could 
do it. Now it's up to the public to approve Proposition 112 and lock it in 
place." 
</P>
<P>
For the executive branch, the most significant part of the ethics package is 
the limit on lobbying by officials who leave office. During the Deukmejian 
Administration, a number of top officials, including members of the governor's 
Cabinet, have left their posts and gone into the lobbying business. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian signed the bill despite questions over the effective date of the 
lobbying restrictions. Proposition 112 would set the date as Jan. 7, 1991, the 
day after Deukmejian leaves office. But the bill moved up the effective date to 
Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's office was concerned that some staff members would have to quit 
a week early if they planned to become lobbyists. But legislators acknowledged 
that the change was an oversight and agreed to carry another bill adopting the 
later date.

UNCERTIFIED BUS DRIVERS TAKEN OFF ROAD; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: STRIKE-BOUND GREYHOUND'S DECISION CALLED A VICTORY FOR ASSEMBLYMAN KATZ. 
COMPANY SAYS ONLY 40 OPERATORS ARE AFFECTED.

All Greyhound replacement bus drivers who do not meet California safety 
standards have been taken off the road until they can pass the state test for 
coach operators, the strikebound company announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The decision is a victory for Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who had 
charged that the uncertified drivers -- stationed primarily in Southern 
California -- posed a public safety hazard. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the right thing to do," said Katz, who first raised the issue. "I am glad 
that Greyhound decided to abide by the law. When the drivers have the proper 
licensing and background checks, they should be allowed back on the road -- but 
not until then." 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to keep buses running during the two-month drivers' strike, 
Greyhound has hired and trained hundreds of replacement operators. The newly 
hired workers had received commercial driver's licenses but most began driving 
before they obtained a tour bus operator certificate -- a requirement imposed 
by the Legislature after the fatal Walker River bus crash of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the bus company said that 160 drivers -- nearly half of the 
Greyhound operators employed in California -- still did not have the 
certificate. But on Friday, spokeswoman Elizabeth Hale said Greyhound's latest 
figures showed that no more than 40 operators now are uncertified. 
</P>
<P>
After The Times reported Thursday that Greyhound was using drivers who do not 
meet state standards, the company ordered them to return to their homes until 
they pass the test administered by the Department of Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't let them drive until they're certified," Hale said. "They will not be 
operating the buses." 
</P>
<P>
Hale said all the uncertified drivers were removed from their jobs by Thursday 
night. Those who were still away from their home terminals Friday were sent 
back as passengers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In April, a California Highway Patrol inspection of the Los Angeles Greyhound 
terminal found that more than 90% of the drivers did not have the tour bus 
operator certificate. Since then, the company had arranged for the drivers to 
take the test but allowed them to continue operating the buses before they were 
certified. 
</P>
<P>
In order to get a tour bus operator certificate, an applicant must pass a 
written test and a driving exam. In addition, anyone convicted of driving while 
intoxicated, reckless driving or other serious driving offenses in the previous 
three years is disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
The certificate requirement was prompted by the Walker River crash that killed 
22 Southern California gamblers on their way to Nevada. A subsequent 
investigation found that the driver of the charter bus had a history of 
speeding and other driving violations. 
</P>
<P>
Greyhound is supporting legislation by Sen. Newton R. Russell (R-Glendale) that 
would exempt its drivers from the tour bus operator certificate. However, Katz, 
who is the chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee, said the 
exemption has no chance of winning passage from his committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Since the strike by Greyhound drivers began March 2, the bus company has 
employed some replacement drivers in California who were not certified under 
the state's strict licensing procedure for coach operators. After receiving a 
warning from the California Highway Patrol, Greyhound has gradually been 
getting its drivers tested and certified, but had continued to keep unqualified 
operators behind the wheel. Meanwhile, Greyhound and its striking workers 
agreed this week to reopen talks aimed at ending the strike. Contract 
negotiations, halted since mid-March, will resume today in Washington.

California's population grew last year by a record 772,400, fueled by the 
highest net migration total since World War II, state population experts said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The state's estimated population, according to the Demographic Research Unit of 
the Department of Finance, hit 29,473,400 on Jan. 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
That was a 2.7% increase in a year. 
</P>
<P>
California's growth included a record number of births, minus deaths, of 
333,990, plus net migration of 438,410. The net migration estimate is the 
highest since 1943-44, when it was 523,000. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco was the only county to lose population, dropping for the third 
straight year. The current population, 727,000, is 2,900 lower than the year 
before. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside County was the fastest growing county in the state, increasing 8.3%, 
to 1,110,000, followed by Del Norte, 7.8%, and Amador, 7.1%. The latter two 
counties had large increases in state prison populations. 
</P>
<P>
Several counties hit population milestones during 1989. For instance, 
Sacramento County exceeded 1 million, at 1,026,800, and San Diego County passed 
the 2.5-million mark, at 2,509,900 in adding 92,300 residents. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County added 117,100 people, to reach 8,769,900; Orange County 
added 46,800 to reach 2,326,200; Ventura grew by 12,800 to reach 668,600 and 
San Bernardino added 88,400 to reach 1,423,800. 
</P>
<P>
Among cities, Los Angeles and San Diego posted the biggest total growth 
numbers. Los Angeles added 34,600 people for an estimated population of 
3,434,000. San Diego has 30,500 more people for a population of 1,118,000.

SEIDMAN SAYS U.S. SHOULD SELL OFF S&amp;L REAL ESTATE QUICKLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The government's portfolio of real estate from seized savings and loan 
associations is $16 billion and growing rapidly, but only $2 billion in 
property has been sold so far, S&amp;L bailout chief L. William Seidman told 
Congress on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The shopping centers, office buildings, homes and condominiums must be sold 
quickly because it costs the government about 10% a year to hold them, Seidman 
said. And it is futile to hope that depressed real estate markets will revive 
quickly enough to boost the eventual sales prices, he warned. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in business to sell assets, not to bet on market movement," Seidman 
told a special S&amp;L task force of the House Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman, who is leaving his job under White House prodding, told committee 
members he had not yet officially resigned. He said he will not leave until he 
finishes selling or closing 140 S&amp;Ls seized by the government. 
</P>
<P>
Committee members lavished praise on Seidman, who serves simultaneously as 
chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which guarantees bank deposits 
up to $100,000, and the Resolution Trust Corp., which dismantles defunct 
S&amp;Ls, repays depositors and attempts to sell the assets. 
</P>
<P>
"I worry about the independence" of the two agencies without Seidman at the 
helm, said Rep. Bruce Vento (D-Minn.), the task force chairman. "The erratic 
implementation (of the S&amp;L rescue law), the indifference, inattention and 
internal squabbling of the Administration have unfortunately made a tough job 
yet more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
"You are a model of government service," Rep. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) told 
Seidman. "The Administration should be on its hands and knees begging you to 
stay." 
</P>
<P>
Seidman diplomatically avoided the opportunity to attack the Bush 
Administration for leaning on him to resign, just nine months after putting him 
in charge of the financial cleanup of hundreds of crippled thrift institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he focused on the need to accelerate real estate sales. The $16 
billion in properties represents only the buildings and land over which the 
government has undisputed ownership, and the figure is likely to grow 
significantly. 
</P>
<P>
Thrifts seized by the government have an additional $150 billion in assets, 
mainly as mortgage loans. The vagaries of the economy and local real estate 
markets will determine how many of these loans ultimately go into default, with 
the properties foreclosed and offered for sale by the government. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman said he wants to accelerate real estate sales before the government is 
figuratively buried under a pile of properties. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L rescue law says the government should sell real estate for at least 
95% of market value in the "distressed" states of Arkansas, Colorado, 
Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas, and charge at least 90% in all other 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
But fair market value is an elusive concept, especially in a depressed area 
filled with foreclosed properties. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman wants to cut prices by 15% if the properties do not sell within four to 
six months and by an additional 5% after three more months. If the properties 
still do not sell, he said, the RTC should seek another appraisal "in light of 
this evidence from the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed new sale policies, which the RTC board will consider next week, 
would provide much more freedom to reduce prices. The RTC would be given "the 
flexibility to determine a lower fair-market value," Seidman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Like most other merchandise, the longer S&amp;L assets sit on the shelf, the 
more they deteriorate," Seidman said. "If a property does not sell, probably it 
is because we are asking too much in the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Seidman wants to sell selected groups of related properties at 
auctions to speed up the disposal of the growing pile of assets. The first such 
sale will take place this summer, with $200 million in properties on the block 
in the biggest real estate auction in history. 
</P>
<P>
But it will take good prices to attract buyers, whether in direct sales or at 
auctions, the RTC chairman said. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman staunchly defended the tough new approach taken by federal regulators 
toward examining the loan portfolios of banks and thrifts. By insisting that 
many loans be reclassified as relatively shaky, examiners are causing 
institutions to be much more wary of making loans, even to once-favored 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman and other regulators blame the easy credit environment of the 1980s, 
when S&amp;L managers took unaccustomed risks in making loans, for many of the 
costly collapses in the thrift business.

COLUMBIA S&amp;L LOSES ALMOST 10% OF DEPOSITS IN FIRST QUARTER; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: THE COMPANY POSTED A $293-MILLION LOSS FOR THE PERIOD. AND LIABILITIES 
SWAMPED ASSETS BY $216 MILLION.

<P>
Columbia Savings &amp; Loan said Friday that withdrawals exceeded deposits by 
$741 million in the first three months of 1990, a decline of nearly 10%. 
</P>
<P>
The Beverly Hills-based thrift also announced a $293-million loss in the 
period. 
</P>
<P>
That contrasts with earnings of $7.9 million in the first quarter of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
That means that Columbia, rendered insolvent last month by heavy losses on its 
junk bond investments, lost $95 million in March, after previously announced 
losses of $198 million in January and February. As of March 31, the 
once-healthy thrift had liabilities that exceeded assets by $216 million. The 
brightest spot was Columbia's statement that it has made progress in finding a 
buyer for its heavy portfolio of junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia revealed that its deposit outflow during the first quarter shrunk its 
base of customer savings to $7.03 billion. Its deposits are insured up to 
$100,000 by the federal government. Columbia has 29 offices throughout Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The deposit outflows through March were expected. Most resulted when brokered 
deposits matured and were not renewed because of customer concern about 
Columbia's financial condition. Brokered deposits are funds raised through a 
middleman, such as an investment banking firm, for a fee. 
</P>
<P>
The question is, to what extent did deposits erode further in April, after 
Columbia announced devastating losses for 1989 and the first two months of 
1990? Columbia's associate counsel, Charles A. Yamarone, wouldn't comment. He 
insisted, however, that Columbia has "sufficient funds available to meet all 
expected deposit outflows." 
</P>
<P>
Columbia's insolvency has made it a likely candidate for a government takeover, 
but regulators have kept hands off so far. Columbia says it needs more than 
$338 million to meet the minimum federal requirements for tangible capital, a 
measure of a thrift's financial reserve to protect against losses. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators declined comment on Columbia's latest losses. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia also said it has several potential buyers for its junk bond portfolio. 
According to a statement, the firm has "obtained several qualifying bids to 
purchase substantially all of the high-yield bond portfolio in a one-time 
structured financing." Company officials declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Once among the nation's strongest and most profitable thrifts, Columbia was 
rendered insolvent by heavy losses in the recent collapse of the junk bond 
market. Junk bonds are risky, high-yielding corporate debt securities. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia has assets of $8.18 billion, with about a third of it in junk bonds. 
Thomas Spiegel, Columbia's former chief executive, is heading the effort to 
find a single buyer for the bonds. Spiegel could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Junk bond industry sources believe that the most likely buyers of Columbia's 
portfolio are wealthy private investors who think that the securities will 
rebound sharply in value and who -- unlike banks or insurance companies -- do 
not operate under the scrutiny of government regulators. 
</P>
<P>
The value of Columbia's junk bonds has been slashed by credit problems as well 
as writeoffs mandated as part of congressional legislation last year to bail 
out the savings and loan industry. The law requires savings and loans to sell 
their junk bonds within five years. 
</P>
<P>
Although Columbia appears hopelessly insolvent, company officials continue to 
maintain an optimistic public posture about its eventual return to financial 
health. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Columbia Chief Executive Edward G. Harshfield said: "We still 
feel that Columbia has the ability to achieve timely, full compliance with the 
capital standards, and we will continue to work toward meeting the challenges 
imposed on us." Harshfield was not available for further comment.

Bondholders of bankrupt American Continental Corp. would recover a small 
portion of their investments under a tentative, $21-million agreement between 
the company's creditors and the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to seek court approval to liquidate the Phoenix 
company and oust its controversial chairman, Charles H. Keating Jr. American 
Continental, now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, is the parent of the failed Lincoln 
Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement announced in U.S. District Court in Phoenix on Friday, much 
of the $21 million would go toward providing 22,000 mostly elderly bondholders 
with at least partial repayment of the $200 million they invested. They would 
have a chance to recover more if the court approved the liquidation. 
</P>
<P>
A representative for Keating said the executive plans to resign as American 
Continental's chairman and chief executive next week to head a court-approved 
shareholders committee, which will take part in the bankruptcy court 
negotiations over the company's fate. 
</P>
<P>
The actions are strategic moves in the high-stakes contest between federal 
regulators and Keating over assets of American Continental. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement would settle significant differences between creditors and the 
Resolution Trust Corp., the government agency operating Lincoln. It also gives 
the agency rights that will help it move faster and more easily against 
Keating. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators hold Lincoln up as the epitome of everything that has gone wrong in 
the thrift industry. They estimate that the S&amp;L will cost taxpayers $2 
billion, one of the costliest thrift cleanups in the nation. Federal 
authorities have launched an all-out attack on Keating through a series of 
criminal investigations and a $1.1-billion racketeering suit against him and 
his top executives. Keating denies any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the agreement have not been worked out but are expected to be 
announced by next Friday, when the unsecured creditors committee has said it 
will file its reorganization plan. American Continental's bankruptcy is the 
fifth-largest in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
The pact provides that American Continental's "estate will be liquidated and 
that those proceeds will be distributed first to the creditors," said Michael 
Manning, a Phoenix lawyer for Resolution Trust. The creditors and the 
government would also seek the removal of Keating and all top American 
Continental executives. They would be replaced by a new, independent 
management, Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement in principle was announced in U.S. District Court in Phoenix and 
came as a surprise to Keating and his associates, who knew only that the 
creditors committee and the government agency had been talking for the past two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
"RTC has simply refused to negotiate with us," said James J. Feder, a Los 
Angeles lawyer for American Continental. "It's too big a cause celebre for them 
to do a settlement with us. They've made Lincoln and Keating their major 
target." 
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement "settles nothing" because the company must be involved in 
the final negotiating process and the court must approve any plan. American 
Continental has had an outline of a reorganization plan pending since last June 
but has not pursued it. 
</P>
<P>
Feder said Keating will probably resign next week as American Continental's 
chairman to head up a shareholders committee, the formation of which was 
approved Friday by District Court Judge Richard M. Bilby. The committee will 
take part in negotiations on a reorganization plan to be presented to Bilby for 
his approval, Feder said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement between the creditors and the government does not affect three 
other legal areas: the racketeering lawsuit against Keating and others, 
American Continental's challenge of last year's federal takeover of Lincoln and 
the lawsuits filed against Keating and others by holders of American 
Continental's debt securities. 
</P>
<P>
Those bondholders make up the bulk of the company's creditors and would benefit 
most under the agreement. Although the bondholders' payment hasn't been 
determined yet, lawyers in the case said talks have put the figure at about $14 
million, or nearly 7 cents on the dollar. The other $7 million would go to 
other creditors. 
</P>
<P>
The bondholders are mostly elderly Lincoln depositors who were persuaded to buy 
nearly $200 million of the parent company's debt securities at the S&amp;L's 29 
Southern California branches.

TIME WARNER INC.'S 32-PAGE AD INSERT BUGS A MEDIA CRITIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FARHI, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Executives of Time Warner Inc. described it as one of the largest 
magazine-advertising campaigns ever -- a 32-page insert that will reach about 
80 million readers of Time, Life, People, Fortune and Entertainment Weekly this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
But one prominent media critic called it a prime example of intra-company 
back-scratching that is "anti-competitive" and smacks of "self-dealing" by the 
giant media concern. 
</P>
<P>
The advertising insert in question was placed in the five Time Warner 
publications this week by Time Warner's movie subsidiary, Warner Bros., to 
commemorate the 50th birthday of Bugs Bunny. In addition to "advertorial" copy 
about the wisecracking cartoon rabbit, the insert carries ads promoting various 
Warner movies, company divisions and products licensed by Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
A Time Warner spokesman said this week that the company's movie division "paid 
fair market value" to the company's magazine division to run the ad supplement. 
He would not specify a price, but sources inside and outside the company 
estimated that such a promotion would go for about $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
However, Ben H. Bagdikian, the former dean of the journalism school at UC 
Berkeley, said the supplement highlights a larger issue involving concentration 
of ownership in the media. "The media that reach the largest audiences are 
becoming dominated by a handful of corporations who can exploit their size and 
power with the kind of self-dealing that these Time Warner ads represent," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ownership of Warner Bros. and the magazines gives Time Warner a built-in cost 
advantage, Bagdikian said, that permits the company to squeeze out small 
competitors. "Presumably, even if Warner pays the going ad rate, Time Inc. will 
make a certain profit in which Warner will participate," he said. "It's all 
going to end up in the same bank anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Reisenbach, Warner Bros.' executive vice president of marketing, said 
Warner began talking with Time about running the ads long before Time Inc. and 
Warner Communications announced that they were merging early last year. The 
supplement was inspired by a similar promotion that Walt Disney Co. ran in Time 
Inc. publications a year ago to promote the 60th year of Mickey Mouse, 
Reisenbach said. 
</P>
<P>
Everett Dennis, executive director of the Gannett Center for Media Studies, 
said the Time Warner ad supplement would have inspired congressional antitrust 
hearings 20 years ago. But he said media ownership is considerably more diverse 
now than two decades ago and the ads appear to raise no issues involving 
anti-competitive practices. 
</P>
<P>
"This is exactly the kind of competitive advantage that Time and Warner hoped 
to achieve by merging," he said. "They are simply maximizing their 
opportunities. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with it." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis added that cross promotion within media firms is common. The Wall Street 
Journal runs ads for subsidiaries owned by its parent firm, Dow Jones &amp; 
Co., and the Washington Post runs ads for Newsweek, which are both owned by 
Washington Post Co.

JOBLESS REPORT TRIGGERS RALLY IN BOND PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A weak employment report triggered a furious rally Friday in the bond market, 
sending interest rates sharply lower. 
</P>
<P>
The bond buying binge offered a marked contrast to the gloom that depressed the 
market for much of April, hammering bond prices and pushing long-term interest 
rates above 9% for the first time since last May. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond climbed 1 5/8 points, or $16.25 for every 
$1,000 face amount, in one of the year's biggest rallies. 
</P>
<P>
Its yield tumbled to 8.81% from 8.97% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the government's report that the unemployment rate rose to 5.4% 
in April was the catalyst for the big price rally. 
</P>
<P>
What caught most bond traders' interest was the report of a measly net gain of 
64,000 nonfarm jobs in April, well below what analysts had expected. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott Platt, fixed-income research director for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; 
Jenrette Securities Corp., said that if the addition of 78,000 temporary census 
workers were excluded from the numbers, jobs would have fallen by 14,000 last 
month. He said analysts had expected an increase of 150,000 jobs, not counting 
the census workers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said wage inflation was up 0.3% in April, when many analysts 
were expecting 0.5% growth, partly because of the April 1 boost in the minimum 
wage. But the increase had minimal impact on overall wage growth, officials 
indicated. 
</P>
<P>
"This report indicates a lot of weakness in the economy. People had thought the 
economy was stronger, with a much deeper inflation problem," Platt said. 
</P>
<P>
The bond market benefits from slow economic growth and low inflation because 
credit demand generally falls off during sluggish periods and allows interest 
rates to decline. 
</P>
<P>
Rising inflation and rapid growth, on the other hand, erode the value of 
fixed-income securities such as notes and bonds and could prompt the Federal 
Reserve to encourage higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing the bond market likes better than bad news," said Robert 
Brusca, chief economist for Nikko Securities International. 
</P>
<P>
He said the bond market had overreacted during the past few months to 
indications that the economy was growing rapidly and inflation was 
accelerating. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate that banks charge each other on 
overnight loans, was quoted at 8.188%, unchanged from late Thursday.

MARKET REACTS TO RALLY IN BONDS; DOW RISES 14

<P>
Stock prices closed higher Friday in a fifth-straight gain, helped by an 
explosive bond market rally that was fueled by a rise in the unemployment rate, 
pointing to a slowing economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 stocks rose 14.19 to 2,710.36, stretching its gain 
for the week to 65.31 points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by better than 2 to 1 in nationwide 
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,020 up, 465 down and 
480 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume slid to 140.55 million shares from 145.57 million Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The market's gain left the Dow index up 2.5% for the week, but many investors 
sat out the rally, unconvinced that the market will continue to move up. 
</P>
<P>
As the day began, the Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate rose 
in April to 5.4%. 
</P>
<P>
The figures also showed an increase of 64,000 in nonfarm payroll employment, 
far less than economists had expected. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the news abruptly dampened recent speculation that the Federal 
Reserve might tighten credit in its campaign against inflation. Interest rates 
fell sharply in the credit markets. 
</P>
<P>
"The talk of Fed tightening has gone by the wayside. There is undeniable 
weakness in these numbers," said Joseph Carson, senior economist at Chemical 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The benchmark 30-year bond climbed 1 5/8 points, or $16.25 for every $1,000 
face amount, in one of the year's biggest rallies. 
</P>
<P>
But stock traders did not take the news with unequivocal enthusiasm. Brokers 
said it raised some fresh doubts about the outlook for economic growth and 
corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
Among the blue chips, International Business Machines climbed 2 1/2 to 110 1/2; 
General Motors rose 5/8 to 45 3/4; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph added 3/8 
to 40 3/8, and American Express gained 3/8 to 26 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
In foreign trading, share prices on the London Stock Exchange closed mostly 
higher, buoyed by better-than-expected results for Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher's Conservative Party in local elections. The Financial Times 100-share 
index rose 27.3 to 2,162.2. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo stock market was closed for a holiday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Jobless News Sparks Decline in Dollar 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell against all major currencies except the Japanese yen after the 
government said the U.S. unemployment rate for April rose to its highest level 
in more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
"That seemed to be what set it off," Mike Ballow, a currency market analyst 
with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said of the dollar's decline. 
</P>
<P>
Signs of economic weakness, such as higher unemployment, may induce the Federal 
Reserve to ease interest rates. Lower rates reduce the attractiveness of 
returns on dollar-denominated investments, compared to those for other 
currencies. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, people (traders) only are concentrating on interest rates," said 
Walter Simon, a vice president at Bank Julius Baer &amp; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Markets in Japan were closed for the Citizens' Day holiday. In London, the 
dollar traded at 158.25 yen, up from 158.10 yen late Thursday. In New York, the 
dollar bought 158.30 yen, up from 158.05 yen a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the British pound moved higher, rising to $1.6595 from $1.6425 late 
Thursday. In New York, the pound cost $1.6635, more expensive than Thursday's 
$1.6410. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Sugar Prices Fall Amid Heavy Selling 
</P>
<P>
Sugar futures prices collapsed, plunging more than a penny a pound on New 
York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange amid heavy selling by frustrated 
speculators on signs of slack global demand. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, cocoa futures also fell sharply; copper futures 
retreated; precious metals were mostly lower; oil futures advanced; grains and 
soybeans were mixed, and livestock and meat futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
World sugar futures settled 0.50 cent to 1.16 cents lower, with the contract 
for delivery in July at 14.44 cents a pound, the lowest close for a near-month 
sugar contract since March 1. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was bailing out of the market today," Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. 
analyst Judith Ganes said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the market had been poised for a fall after repeated failures in the 
past week to sustain prices above 16 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Speculators who had been holding out for higher prices finally gave up and 
began liquidating their positions, analysts said, triggering a sell-off of 
near-record proportions, with an estimated 76,000 contracts changing hands. 
</P>
<P>
The decline was spurred on by a bearish supply-demand report by the London 
trading house E.D.&amp; F. Man Ltd. The firm sharply reduced its 1989-90 sugar 
deficit estimate, predicting that consumption would outstrip production by 
258,000 metric tons instead of 1.46 million metric tons as previously forecast. 
</P>
<P>
Ganes said the Man report probably contributed to the bearish sentiment but 
that the revised deficit forecast was in line with other trade house 
predictions. 
</P>
<P>
She said the sharp rise in sugar prices from less than 13 cents a pound last 
December has stifled demand, which is the reason for the lowered consumption 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
But Monday's sharp decline could stimulate new demand, Ganes said.

BUSH'S SON TO TESTIFY ABOUT THRIFT FAILURE;

S&amp;LS: LOANS TO NEIL BUSH'S BUSINESS PARTNERS WHILE HE WAS ON THE BOARD OF A

<P>
Neil Bush, the president's son, said Friday that he has agreed to testify 
before the House Banking Committee about the failure of a Colorado thrift on 
whose board he served. 
</P>
<P>
The panel, chaired by Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), is looking into the 
December, 1988, collapse of Silverado Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Assn. of 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
The connections among Silverado and other failed S&amp;Ls are being examined, 
including Charles H. Keating Jr.'s Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn. and the 
junk bond operation of former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. financier Michael 
Milken. 
</P>
<P>
The committee has scheduled two hearings. Thrift regulators are expected to 
testify May 22; Bush and other Silverado board members are to appear May 23. 
</P>
<P>
"I have agreed to participate and will continue to cooperate with Congress, the 
Office of Thrift Supervision and any other agencies involved," Bush said in a 
statement released through his attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
The thrift office has alleged that loans by Silverado to Bush's business 
partners, developers Kenneth Good and Bill Walters, were a conflict of interest 
for Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Bush was on the S&amp;L's board from October, 1985, until August, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In January, regulators began disciplinary procedures against Bush that could 
result in a lifetime ban from the thrift industry. Bush has denied any 
wrongdoing.

'SIMPSONS' HELP FOX SEND A SIGNAL; 
</P>
<P>
PROGRAMMING: DESPITE FEWER AFFILIATES, THE FOURTH NETWORK IS MAKING A STRONGER 
SHOWING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Simpsons" is an even bigger phenomenon than most viewers realize. The Fox 
show's ability to finish among the nation's 15 most-watched programs and 
frequently outdraw the Sunday-night competition on ABC, CBS and NBC is somewhat 
analogous to RC Cola ringing up better sales than Coke, Pepsi and 7-Up. 
</P>
<P>
The reason: Fox has only 129 affiliated stations that collectively reach only 
about 90% of the country. By contrast, each of the three major networks has at 
least 209 affiliates that together cover virtually every TV household in the 
nation. And many of Fox's stations transmit comparatively weak, UHF signals 
that the residents of those communities previously had ignored in the same way 
that most Los Angeles area viewers rarely turn to KDOC Channel 56. 
</P>
<P>
So Fox shows are automatically handicapped in their ability to compete for 
national ratings. But Fox executives are hopeful that the skyrocketing success 
of "The Simpsons" and "Married . . . With Children" will help the upstart 
fourth network overcome that handicap in the years ahead as its affiliates 
attract new viewers and new advertisers, then plow at least some of the 
increased revenues back into the stations for equipment and transmission 
improvements that will make them, and Fox, a more formidable threat to the 
three major networks. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, WCOV Channel 20, the Fox-affiliate in Montgomery, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
Before Fox, said station chief David Woods, WCOV was only months away from 
going dark. "We didn't even have money to buy toilet paper," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"When we would try to sell ourselves at an ad agency, they would laugh us out 
of their office. Now they give us the nice chair." 
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1987, WCOV was airing reruns of the 1982 sci-fi series 
"Voyagers," attracting a pitiful 1% of the audience in the Sunday night time 
slot that now houses "The Simpsons." Fox's animated series routinely comes in 
second in its time period in Montgomery with about 20% of the audience, beating 
both NBC and ABC. And with adults between ages 18 and 49 -- the demographic 
that advertisers prize most -- "The Simpsons" grabs a 30 share, crushing even 
top-rated "Murder, She Wrote" on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
It does all this despite the fact that WCOV is vastly inferior in terms of 
power and reach to Montgomery's three major network affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were drag racing," Woods said, "they all have V-8s and I'm an old 
four-cylinder. I have an 800-foot (transmitting) tower, and they all have 
2,000-foot towers." 
</P>
<P>
That means that up to 30 miles from the center of town, Montgomery viewers can 
tune in all four stations with equal clarity. Beyond 30 miles, the reception 
for WCOV gets increasingly fuzzy up to 50 miles away, when the WCOV picture is 
nothing but snow. But the three network affiliates can be seen up to about 85 
or 90 miles away, Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
Such technical inferiority is typical at many of the Fox affiliates nationwide. 
Compounded with the network's 10% disadvantage in the amount of territory it 
covers, this helps explains why "The Simpsons" or "Married . . . With Children" 
could be No. 1 in Los Angeles and other big cities and then barely make it in 
to top-20 in the week's national ratings. Last Sunday, for example, "The 
Simpsons" attracted a whopping 37% of the Los Angeles audience to rank as the 
week's most-watched program, but got only 25% nationally and placed 13th. 
"Married . . . With Children" was fourth in Los Angeles and 18th nationally. 
</P>
<P>
Fox executives say it will take years before their affiliates grow strong 
enough to enable the network to compete on the same playing field with the Big 
Three. Though Fox has been adding two or three new stations to its lineup each 
year, additional stations simply do not exist in the majority of areas Fox 
cannot reach. But "the tremendous performance" of "The Simpsons" and "Married . 
. . With Children" will shorten the time frame, said Peter Chernin, president 
of Fox Entertainment Group. 
</P>
<P>
"When you think of a small UHF station that is not a factor in its market and 
all of a sudden you put what may be the strongest show on television on that 
little station, it's an extraordinary event," he said. "Now all of a sudden 
people that never paid any attention to this station have to go find it. That 
has an enormous impact on the rest of the station." 
</P>
<P>
At WCOV in Montgomery, Woods confirmed that "sampling of other programs here 
has increased considerably. Prior to Fox, no one watched us. Now they tune in 
for 'Married . . . With Children' and they may see a promotional spot for 
'Arsenio' or 'Hard Copy' and come back for that. Once you have the audience 
watching, it's easier to retain them." 
</P>
<P>
Harry Pappas, whose Pappas Telecasting Companies owns Fox affiliates in Fresno, 
Omaha, Neb. and Greenville, S.C., said that the huge ratings for "The Simpsons" 
and "Married . . . With Children" have helped to double and in some cases 
triple prime-time ratings at his stations, doubling and tripling revenues on 
the three nights that Fox supplies programming. Those gains have also rubbed 
off on the rest of his programming lineup, he added. 
</P>
<P>
For many of the Fox affiliates that have long been saddled with weak 
programming, Pappas said, such revenue jumps will enable them to invest in 
technical improvements and promotional efforts that will build their audience 
-- and Fox's -- even more. The Fox blockbusters have also made it easier for 
many stations to obtain financing for such improvements, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
WCOV's Woods said that his station has purchased land at a more strategic site 
to build a new, taller transmitter that will beam the signal farther. 
Completion is still several years away, but WCOV already has built a new 
control room in the last two years, complete with modern graphics equipment 
that he said dramatically improved the look of the on-air product. 
</P>
<P>
"These stations never had a reason to make these kinds of investments," 
observed Jaime Kellner, president of Fox Broadcasting. "Now they have a 
reason." 
</P>
<P>
And what of Fox? Does the fact that the fledgling fourth network has proven it 
can draw a huge mass audience with certain programs raise expectations for 
Fox's other shows, such as "The Outsiders" and "The Tracey Ullman Show," which 
last week were the two lowest rated programs in prime time? 
</P>
<P>
Chernin said that the hit shows have certainly "raised the ceiling of our 
expectations. Six months ago, if you would have said we were capable of such 
national numbers, I would have said, 'No way.' But this network is based on our 
ability to target specific (demographic groups). And the weakest show we have 
is still doing impressive numbers with teens and adults 18-34, and we get 
advertiser premiums for them." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, Fox is structured so that it is able to turn a profit with 
ratings that would drain the other three networks.

'TURTLES,' 'PRETTY WOMAN' FACE OFF IN LIGHTHEARTED AD BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
You could almost call it "Ad Wars," "The Turtles Strike Back" or "Revenge of 
Pretty Woman." 
</P>
<P>
The ad campaigns for the two hit films "Pretty Woman" and "Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtles" have become almost as fierce as their see-sawing battle for first 
place at the box office each week. 
</P>
<P>
There's no doubt though that "Turtles" has the lead with a cumulative gross of 
$98 million to "Woman's" $81.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
First there was the "Turtles" ad parody. Distributor New Line Cinema's ads 
mocked "Pretty Woman" by having one of the turtles and one of the human stars, 
Judith Hoag, pose like Richard Gere and Julia Roberts did in ads for the 
Disney/Touchstone release. The "Turtles" ad line stated: "America's No. 1 
Comedy Hit is Pretty Turtle-rific!" 
</P>
<P>
But that was last week. The Gere-Roberts romantic comedy overtook the hip 
tortoises this week as the No. 1 film, after trailing the "Turtles" the 
previous four weeks. Prior to that, "Pretty Woman" had been No. 1 for one week. 
</P>
<P>
Disney/Touchstone unveiled its lastest zinger Friday. It suspiciously resembles 
an ad for none other than "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" and reads: "America's 
No. 1 Hit Is Putting The Turtles Back In Their Place." 
</P>
<P>
Touchstone wouldn't comment on its ad, but New Line is thrilled with it. 
</P>
<P>
"We accept Disney as having a great sense of humor," said Sandra J. Ruch, 
president of marketing for New Line. "It's flattering to us. I think that 
Disney took what we did in the right way and returned the favor. We are having 
a great giggle."

CHINESE FILMMAKER LOOKS BACK TO FUTURE; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: DIRECTOR EXAMINES THE PLIGHT OF WOMEN IN CHINA IN 'GOLDEN LOTUS.'

<P>
She's young, she's beautiful and she's got all of Hong Kong talking about the 
reincarnation of China's most celebrated "slut of all time." She is Clara Law, 
a 1985 graduate of the acclaimed National Film School in England who is one of 
Asia's hottest new film directors and only one of three working woman directors 
in the fast-paced competitive Hong Kong movie industry. 
</P>
<P>
Combining lush period costumes and a modern setting with illicit romance, 
mystery and reincarnation, Law is clearly poised for international acclaim 
through her newest film, "The Reincarnation of Golden Lotus," which opened 
Friday, at Laemmle's Monica Fourplex in Santa Monica and the Grand Fourplex in 
downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The film opens at the Gates of Hell where a young woman faces a sorceress who 
is preparing her for reincarnation. The story then follows Lotus' second chance 
in mid-1960s China, in a fast-moving drama filled with humor and tragedy 
delivered with a distinct social and political statement about the role of 
women. 
</P>
<P>
Law, 32, takes Lotus, who is a well-known character from classic Chinese 
literature, and by placing her in modern-day China and Hong Kong turns around 
all preconceived notions about the most famous "fallen woman" of Sung dynasty 
China. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally, I thought I would look at it from a moral point of view -- in 
ancient times she was looked upon as a slut. But given a modern way of looking 
at women, she would be like any woman who wants to make her own decisions. So I 
tried to look at it from this perspective but I found it a bit difficult to do 
this in Hong Kong society where, basically, (social values) are still just the 
same (as in ancient times). Women still have to sell their bodies to be able to 
get to the top," Law explained. 
</P>
<P>
After several rewrites, Law and female scriptwriter Lee Pik Wah finally settled 
on portraying Lotus as a young woman who is constantly haunted by flashback 
scenes of her tortured previous life in ancient feudal China, linking her past, 
present and perhaps future to a predetermined fate. 
</P>
<P>
In the original classic, Lotus is a beautiful woman in 10th-Century China who 
is sold, raped, abused and finally murdered -- all at the hands of men. 
Although viewed as pornographic by both Mainland China and modern-day Hong Kong 
standards, the book nonetheless is considered the earliest social criticism 
written in China. 
</P>
<P>
In "Reincarnation," Law shows Lotus as a young woman who is not afraid to go 
after what she wants. But despite the modern setting, Lotus finds herself again 
a victim of fate. Stunningly beautiful, she attracts the unwanted attention of 
men and although raped by her school principal, it is she who is labeled a slut 
for attempting to fight him off. When she tries to again master her own fate 
and gives a pair of shoes to a handsome classmate, she is accused of stealing 
the shoes. She is then sent to the countryside for re-education after the 
classmate bows under peer pressure and disavows her. 
</P>
<P>
But Lotus refuses to give up. In yet another attempt to escape from the 
confines of a society which has labeled her immoral, she enters into a loveless 
marriage with a homely but rich Hong Kong businessman who brings her to Hong 
Kong and showers her with gifts and affection. But Lotus appears to be unable 
to shake either of her pasts and soon discovers that the handsome classmate has 
been hired as a chauffeur by her new husband, who considers him to be a 
brother. In her past life, the Sung dynasty Lotus fell in love with her 
brother-in-law and is eventually killed by him after she seeks out another 
lover in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"We put her in a situation that she can remember bits of her past life at a 
time. She wants to overcome fate. She doesn't want it to happen again. She 
wanted to be in control. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to make a positive statement about the woman," said Law. "I felt that 
she relied on men because she had no way to defend herself against the basic 
social inequality against women. I had a certain sympathy for her. That's why I 
wanted to put her into this life. 
</P>
<P>
"But I wanted to keep a certain romantic notion of the story; what I feel is 
that the brother-in-law in fact loves her but he just doesn't have the guts to 
show it. He wanted to be a man, a moral one. But in modern society, it's not 
that hard to get your brother's wife if you love her enough. But he is just not 
that kind of man. He is more a coward and I really wanted to portray the woman 
as superior -- someone who is willing to pursue her love." 
</P>
<P>
Law's transformation of Lotus from slut to heroine has raised some controversy 
in her native Hong Kong. After the film opened last fall, Law said that the 
audiences found it interesting but they were also disturbed by the subject. She 
said; "Chinese are, in a way, superstitious. They believe in reincarnation and 
the film may have made some people think they too were reliving past lives." 
</P>
<P>
Law feels that all of her films are linked by a common theme of feeling 
"homeless," of not having a place where one can belong. 
</P>
<P>
Her 80-minute graduation thesis film, "They Say the Moon is Fuller Here," which 
won the Silver Plaque at the 1985 Chicago International Film Festival, explores 
the difficulties a young woman from Hong Kong faces when she goes to England. 
The autobiographical bent of the film came one step closer when Law couldn't 
find the right actress to play the role of the woman and ended up both acting 
in and directing the film. 
</P>
<P>
Law's first commercial film, "The Other Half and the Other Half," tackled the 
problem faced by many Hong Kong couples who have separated temporarily to 
ensure that they will have a place to go should China's 1997 takeover of Hong 
Kong prove to be too restrictive. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to explore what happens when a couple is split up in this way. In 
Hong Kong we call them 'tai hoong yun' -- people without their spouses. It has 
become very commonplace. What are you to do with your life when your other half 
is not there? That is a question that is worrying all Hong Kong people." 
</P>
<P>
Law was deeply affected by the Chinese government's violent crackdown on the 
student democracy movement on June 4, which she watched live on Hong Kong 
television. "I was so shocked I cannot forget it," she recalled. "It was late 
at night. I was glued to the set. When the lights went out at Tian An Men 
Square, everything went dark for me. 
</P>
<P>
"This feeling of homelessness, of searching for freedom, for justice in the 
homeland and not able to find it . . . It seems to me that time is running out 
for China."

POP BEAT / REGGAE: SETTLEMENT OF $30-MILLION BOB MARLEY ESTATE IS ANTICIPATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER STEFFENS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nine years after the death of reggae patriarch Bob Marley, it appears that a 
major settlement of the legal disputes surrounding his $30-million estate is in 
the works. 
</P>
<P>
This could mean the release of a major body of his work: more than 100 singles 
that have never been collected on albums, as well as a significant amount of 
unreleased recordings. 
</P>
<P>
Among the unreleased tracks are some songs that have long been legend in reggae 
circles, including "High Tide Low Tide," a hymn to his mother, and "I Know a 
Place Where We Can Carry On," which Marley wrote in 1978 after discovering he 
had cancer. The first releases may come before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Blackwell, president of Island Records and the man who helped establish 
Marley as an international star in the '70s, confirmed the broad outline of the 
proposed arrangements last week from his New York headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the final stages of negotiations right now. We've lined up virtually 
all of Bob's baby-mothers, along with his wife, Rita, and Mrs. Booker, Bob's 
mother," Blackwell said. (Baby-mother is the Caribbean term for the unwed 
mother of a man's children.) 
</P>
<P>
Central to the settling of accounts is the disposition of Tuff Gong, the 
company founded by Marley and his bandmates in the Wailers, Peter Tosh and 
Bunny Wailer, in 1970. When Marley succumbed to cancer on May 11, 1981, at 36, 
his widow Rita Marley assumed control of the company. But in 1986, the Jamaican 
government, which had taken over the estate, forced her to resign her post with 
the company and as executrix of the estate after revelations in court that she 
had been coerced into signing a false will. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, the government appointed banker Louis Byles to take charge of the 
Marley holdings. The tiny flow of unreleased works, which had been initiated by 
Rita Marley, ground to a halt. Her country home was auctioned in the pages of 
the Jamaican Gleaner newspaper to pay back taxes, and she was indicted for tax 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Blackwell has already moved into Tuff Gong. "One of the initial things we've 
done is to close down the company to begin its complete reorganization. I plan 
to put in my own management team as soon as possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1989, the Jamaican government sold the entire Marley estate to 
Blackwell for $8.4 million. The sale was immediately challenged by Marley's 
mother and several others, with the final appeal scheduled last January in 
England's Privy Council. 
</P>
<P>
At the last minute, Blackwell was able to postpone the hearing while he 
attempted to reach a settlement with the many interested parties. These include 
Rita Marley, Bob Marley's mother Cedella Booker, his 11 children by seven 
women, various former co-workers and band members, and music publishers. 
</P>
<P>
In February, the broad outlines of the plan began to emerge. Blackwell would 
assume control of all of Marley's recordings; his properties in various 
countries; his likeness, and more. 
</P>
<P>
Once his assumption of the estate is approved by the Privy Council, Blackwell 
says he will turn it all over to a nonprofit Bob Marley Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
One person exhilarated by the apparent settling of most of the controversies is 
Marley's mother, Cedella Booker, who has gained title to her spacious Miami 
house as part of the resolution. Mrs. Booker also owns a great deal of the land 
in Nine Mile, the rural village in northern Jamaica where Bob was born and is 
buried. Blackwell has plans for the property. 
</P>
<P>
"We are currently looking into the feasibility of moving the Bob Marley museum 
there," he said. "And of course we will need other buildings nearby to 
accommodate the visitors in a properly organized way." 
</P>
<P>
Other ideas include a recording studio in Trenchtown, the Kingston slum that is 
the setting for many of Marley's songs. The facility would be geared to helping 
Jamaican youths learn music. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rita and her lawyer and accountant are still scheduled to go to 
trial in Jamaica on a $16-million fraud charge. 
</P>
<P>
"I welcome this opportunity," Rita Marley said earlier this year in Los 
Angeles. "It will force the government to show everyone just how they have been 
mishandling the estate since they took it away from me five years ago."

NURTURING SEEDS OF GARDENING INTEREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE K. SCHENDEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gardening is a lot like Nintendo. Both are addicting, and once players master 
the basics, they're hungry for a new challenge. 
</P>
<P>
One way a gardener can fill the insatiable desire for more excitement is at the 
20th annual Baldwin Bonanza benefit plant sale at Los Angeles State and County 
Arboretum this weekend, where new, rare and challenging plants will be sold at 
below wholesale and retail prices. 
</P>
<P>
Some video game aficionados might argue that the arboretum's fund-raiser is 
more like the old standby video game, Pac Man -- shoppers zip through the maze 
of flower beds and display tables while systematically snatching up plants. 
</P>
<P>
As with the games, the whole thing starts innocently enough, usually with a 
desire to add a little color to the yard or fill an empty corner in the house. 
But then comes the need for something a little tougher. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how people get hooked on growing plants," said Dodi Murset, California 
Arboretum Foundation member and chairwoman of the outdoor plants at the sale. 
"They start out with something simple, then get interested in orchids and the 
rare and unusual." 
</P>
<P>
The sale's huge selection of rare and popular plants ranges from the blue 
hibiscus (an arboretum introduction) to the popular yellow calla lilies. 
</P>
<P>
"We sold about 600 calla lilies last year," Murset said. "That's a lot of calla 
lilies." 
</P>
<P>
Coinciding with the current less-than-ideal water conditions here in Southern 
California, the sale will promote drought-tolerant and water-conserving plants 
-- plants that take deep and/or infrequent watering. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel water conservation is very important," said John Provine, arboretum 
superintendent. "We'll have a good selection of herbs, perennials and annuals, 
and some natives." 
</P>
<P>
There are even certain plants, Provine said, that people don't realize are 
water-conserving. "People don't think of gazanias as water-conserving and they 
water them too much. They will bloom all summer and do much better with less 
water." 
</P>
<P>
Herbs are growing in popularity all by themselves -- not just because of their 
drought tolerance, but because of their health benefits too, Murset said. Herbs 
are being used more in teas, for natural seasonings and for their medicinal 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
A new addition to the Baldwin Bonanza sale -- which is bound to attract a new 
crop of players all its own -- is a palms section. Usually, palms are sold in 
the summer at a separate sale, but this year the sales are combined. 
</P>
<P>
"Palms are in great demand," Murset said. "For years, they just sat there (at 
the sale). Now, all of a sudden, people decide they like them." 
</P>
<P>
Fountain palms (Livistonia) and climbing cane palms (Calamus caryotoides) will 
be among the hard-to-find varieties at the sale. Others include the fan-leaved 
loulou palms (Pritchardia), which make good house plants, and walking stick and 
feather palms, which do well inside or out. Most will be 1-gallon and 5-gallon 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the plants up for sale were grown in the arboretum's propagation 
nursery, where volunteers, such as Murset's husband, Milt, work throughout the 
year planting seeds, nurturing the young plants and preparing them for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between a plant sale of this scope and the selection at the 
grocery store is that buyers can pick up instructions on how to play the plant 
game along with their plants. 
</P>
<P>
"When you pay $25 for a plant, you darn well better know how to care for it," 
Murset said. "Most of the people who will do the selling are pretty well 
indoctrinated in the care of these plants. You'll get quite a bit of 
information on how to water and care for the plant." 
</P>
<P>
There will also be an information table, where landscapers and other plant 
professionals will offer advice, such as what types of plants to use. 
</P>
<P>
But remember, as with most video games, speed is essential -- most of the best 
plants at this sale go in a hurry.

MORMONS MODIFY TEMPLE RITES; 
</P>
<P>
CEREMONY: WOMAN'S VOW TO OBEY HUSBAND IS DROPPED. CHANGES ARE CALLED MOST 
SIGNIFICANT SINCE 1978. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The central temple ceremony in the Mormon Church has been changed to eliminate 
the woman's vow to obey her husband and other elements that some members said 
were offensive and outdated. 
</P>
<P>
In the new version of the rites, women now pledge to obey God and to merely 
listen to the advice of their husbands. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the most significant change in the church since blacks received the 
priesthood in 1978," said Ron Priddis, vice president of Signature Books in 
Salt Lake City, an independent publisher of Mormon-oriented books. "In a church 
that is so patriarchal, that's quite a step." 
</P>
<P>
Two other features dropped were a dramatization suggesting that Satan beguiles 
Christian clergy to teach false doctrine and the requirement that members make 
throat-slitting and disemboweling gestures as signs that they will not reveal 
the ceremony's contents. 
</P>
<P>
Despite verbal oaths of secrecy that remain in effect, a consistent picture of 
the changes introduced last month has emerged from interviews with both Mormons 
and non-Mormons who monitor church activities. 
</P>
<P>
The new version "reflects greater sensitivity and awareness of women and 
women's role in the Christian church," said Robert Rees, a Mormon bishop who 
also directs the fine arts program for UCLA's extension department. Although 
unwilling to disclose elements of the ritual, Rees nevertheless said that some 
parts eliminated "were historical and cultural anachronisms." 
</P>
<P>
Lavina Fielding Anderson of Salt Lake City, editor-elect of the Journal of 
Mormon History, said she received the revisions "with joy." 
</P>
<P>
"I anticipate further changes with hope and faith," she said in a telephone 
interview. "Some portions of the temple ceremony have been painful to some 
Mormon women and, in some respects, still are," she added, without identifying 
what elements may still be objectionable. 
</P>
<P>
Women, for example, still cover their faces with veils at certain points in the 
ritual, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Also dropped is an "embrace" of a man representing God, who stands behind a 
ceiling-to-floor veil. Reaching through a slit in the veil, the church member 
puts his or her hand to the back of the deity and presses against him at the 
cheek, shoulders, knees and feet with the veil between them. The contact at 
"five points of fellowship," including the hand to his back, has been omitted, 
although the member must still give a secret handshake and repeat a lengthy 
password. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the formal name 
of the 7-million-member Mormon Church, have declined comment on the changes, 
saying the details of the rites are sacred and confidential. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a church that believes in modern and continuous revelation, and the 
changes that were recently made in our temple ceremony are reflective of that 
process," officials said in a statement this week. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most common temple rites performed by members in good standing are 
proxy baptisms and weddings -- in which members stand in for ancestors who are 
thus offered Mormon membership and privileges in the afterlife. 
</P>
<P>
Objections to parts of the ceremony have been raised obliquely in Mormon 
intellectual circles in recent years. Mormon academics have said that the 
temple rites, rather than deriving purely from ancient religious sources, 
borrowed certain features from Masonic fraternal rites during the last century. 
</P>
<P>
David John Buerger of the University of Santa Clara wrote in a 1987 issue of 
the independent Mormon journal Dialogue that, while many Mormons found the 
temple ceremonies entirely meaningful, some were disturbed by "the implied 
violence" of gestures of throat slitting, "the portrayal of a Christian 
minister as the hireling of Satan" and the depiction of women "as subservient 
to men." 
</P>
<P>
In pledging to never reveal the ritual, Mormons formerly made three motions -- 
drawing one's hand quickly across the throat, another indicating one's heart 
would be cut out and the third suggesting disembowelment. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I stopped going to the temple, because (the ritual) was so 
offensive," said a former woman member in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called penalty gestures were criticized as "outgrowing their usefulness" 
in a talk before a Mormon audience about a month ago by Keith Norman, a church 
member in the Cleveland area who holds a doctorate in Christian studies from 
Duke University. "I had no idea this change was about to take place," Norman 
said after the modifications were introduced. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, anti-Mormon, evangelical Christian ministries have been 
spreading reports of the changes. Some candid Mormon officials have 
acknowledged in interviews that the whole secret ritual was published years ago 
by church critics Jerald and Sandra Tanner of Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that dropping the wife's oath of obedience to the husband was a 
concession to the women's liberation movement," said Sandra Tanner in a phone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
Ex-Mormons Chuck and Dolly Sackett of Thousand Oaks, who circulated a brochure 
detailing the changes, noted that single Mormon women also had been required to 
swear obedience to their husbands -- despite the fact they were unmarried. 
</P>
<P>
"Single women will be somewhat relieved of the extreme pressure to marry," said 
the circular. "The wife will no longer be reminded with each temple visit that 
her only channel to her god is through her husband and that his faithfulness 
determines her eternity."

NEW SEMINARY HEAD PLANS TO SPEAK OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES RELIGION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rev. Robert W. Edgar, who served as a Democratic congressman from 
Pennsylvania for 12 years, says he is likely to speak his mind on a variety of 
social justice issues after he takes over in July as president of the School of 
Theology at Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
That would be a major departure from the low-profile stances of the three 
previous presidents at the the United Methodist-related seminary since it moved 
from the USC campus to Claremont in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
But outgoing President Richard W. Cain, who is retiring, said that school 
officials are "very excited" about Edgar's acceptance of the position. "He has 
the ability, background, visibility and commitment that the school needs at 
this point," Cain said. 
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with reporters this week on campus, Edgar said he thought "the 
Board of Trustees and search committee realized that when they offered me this 
opportunity they were going to get someone who is vocal and clear in his 
positions (yet) respectful of other people's views." 
</P>
<P>
Edgar, who served a heavily Republican district in suburban Philadelphia from 
1975 to 1987, said he ranked "stewardship of planet Earth very high" along with 
human rights issues and "the pressures of population." 
</P>
<P>
He said he detoured into politics after spending 12 years in the Methodist 
ministry. "I got angry with what was going on in Washington" in the aftermath 
of the Watergate scandal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The right-wing Christian Voice lobbying group gave Edgar a "zero" rating on his 
voting record in 1982. "I was very proud of that ranking," Edgar said. "Father 
(Robert) Drinan also got a zero then," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Drinan, a Jesuit priest, and Edgar were among "six or seven" ordained clergy 
who were serving in the House of Representatives a decade ago, Edgar said. 
</P>
<P>
Edgar is not a stranger to Southern California. As a politician he came to Los 
Angeles more than once in political fund-raising efforts. In 1986, 
singer-actress Barbra Streisand held a large fund-raiser for six Democratic 
candidates for U.S. Senate seats, including Edgar. He lost that race, however. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, Edgar returned to Los Angeles as national finance chairman of 
Illinois Sen. Paul Simon's unsuccessful primary bid for the Democratic 
presidential nomination. Edgar was director of a private educational group, the 
Committee for National Security, when he decided to seek a position heading a 
seminary or a church-related college, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Among the schools of theology in the country, Claremont would rank very high 
in terms of scholarship and religious leadership," Edgar said. "I think there 
is a lot more we can do." The school's commencement exercises next Saturday 
will have the largest number of Ph.D. graduates -- 13 -- in the seminary's 
history. Altogether, 31 women and 34 men will be awarded degrees, including the 
first graduates of the Korean Bilingual Master of Divinity program. The 
ceremonies will be held at 11 a.m. at the United Church of Christ, 
Congregational, in Claremont.

EL TORO MARINE SHOT AND KILLED IN PHILIPPINES 
</P>

<P>
A U.S. Marine from the Marine Corps Air Station in El Toro was shot in the back 
of the head and killed in a town near the Subic Bay Naval Base, a Navy 
spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate claim of responsibility in the Friday night attack, but 
authorities have evidence that communist guerrillas planned to kill Americans 
before talks begin this month on extending the base's lease. 
</P>
<P>
The incident took place late Friday night in the liberty town of Olongapo near 
the base, located about 50 miles west of Manila, said Lt. Cmdr. Kevin Mukri, 
spokesman for the Subic facility. 
</P>
<P>
Mukri refused to identify the soldier pending notification of next of kin. 
Local police identified him as Sgt. John Fredette, 34. 
</P>
<P>
Mukri said the soldier belonged to a Marine fighter/attack squadron based in El 
Toro, which is currently conducting training exercises in Subic. 
</P>
<P>
The incident is under investigation by both U.S. naval and Philippine 
authorities. No details of the shooting were available. 
</P>
<P>
Mukri said that, as a result of the incident, off-base leave has been canceled 
and non-essential off-base travel has been restricted for U.S. military 
personnel in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Filipino and U.S. authorities have been concerned after local military 
officials reported an alleged member of the communist New People's Army hit 
squad was arrested in Olongapo last week and four other members of the team 
were still at large. 
</P>
<P>
Documents seized from the arrested man, Dionisio Bendoy, indicated a plan by 
the insurgents to assassinate Americans in the city before the opening of talks 
on May 14 on the future of six U.S. military facilities in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
The United States maintains the Subic base, Clark Air Base and four other 
smaller facilities in the country under a 1947 pact that expires in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, guerrillas killed two civilian employees of Camp O'Donnell, a 
U.S. Air Force post near Clark. 
</P>
<P>
In October 1987, communist rebels gunned down three Americans in simultaneous 
attacks outside Clark.

THERE'S ANGER IN THE AIR AS GARDEN GROVE HEARS NEWS

<TEXT>
<P>
The news spread quickly Friday that more malathion is coming to Garden Grove, a 
city already subjected to seven aerial pesticide bombardments in the battle 
against the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
And the judgment on the streets was just as swift. 
</P>
<P>
"Why are they still spraying?" demanded resident Jackie VanGrol, selecting 
groceries in a supermarket. "We haven't found any more flies and this aerial 
spraying just isn't safe. This was a bad decision. They need to consider the 
alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
Another shopper, Snow Pecinovsky, agreed with VanGrol, but expressed confusion 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what should be done," Pecinovsky said. "What happens if they stop 
spraying? What will that mean? How dangerous is malathion? I just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Although the announcement was not made until early Friday afternoon, at 3 p.m. 
many residents and business owners had already heard about the indefinite 
extension. The overwhelming majority opposed further spraying, saying it was 
unhealthy and ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after a round of spraying overnight Thursday that had 
been promised to be the last. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ludicrous," said B&amp;J Auto Parts store owner Paul Schafer. "I think 
we've opened Pandora's box by continuing with the spraying. No one can say 
what's going to be the long-term effect on our health." 
</P>
<P>
In the shop, Shafer's wife Arlene said the spraying doesn't bother her, but 
customer Paul Parry said the safety of malathion has yet to be demonstrated. 
</P>
<P>
"We've wasted an awful lot of money just to save some fruit," said Parry, a 
Garden Grove resident of 35 years. "What about the people? Don't they count? I 
think we need to take a look at our priorities." 
</P>
<P>
Parry called the decision to resume spraying a blatant disregard of residents' 
wants and needs. 
</P>
<P>
"If this is the way our so-called legislators express their concern about the 
citizens, we should get rid of them," Parry said. 
</P>
<P>
"One person is worth a million oranges," said Rae Arroyo, local record store 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
"What are they trying to do? So we get our oranges from Florida -- big deal. 
Enough is enough. You do it once, twice, three times and it doesn't work. 
Enough is enough. Stop it. The people don't want it." 
</P>
<P>
Like many of those interviewed, Shafer and Parry expressed concern over 
malathion's effect on gardening. Shafer showed Polaroid pictures taken Friday 
morning of his aphid-infested strawberry plants. 
</P>
<P>
"Malathion doesn't touch the aphids -- they stay on the underside of the leaf," 
Shafer said. "I haven't seen my shrubs so full of them in at least 12 years." 
</P>
<P>
Shafer said he hasn't seen a ladybug in over four months. 
</P>
<P>
"What's going to happen come fall and you want pollination to take place?" he 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-year Garden Grove resident Sybil Mermer also worried about what the 
spraying would do to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"They've killed all the ladybugs and bumblebees -- how are the plants going to 
get pollinated?" Mermer asked. "This just isn't logical. I don't think the 
spraying is going to help one doggone bit." 
</P>
<P>
Of 24 residents interviewed Friday, 18 said they are opposed the spraying, 
citing concerns over long- and short-term effects on health. The others were 
either indifferent or felt they didn't know enough about the subject to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
An informal survey produced repeated suggestions that the government look into 
alternatives to aerial spraying, including mandatory fruit tree stripping, 
ground spraying, better import controls and bringing in an insect that will 
consume the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we should go back to doing what my grandfather and great-grandfather 
did, using natural bugs to get rid of the pests," said Bonnie Dowling, who 
works in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BATTLE OF THE MEDFLY RAGES ON 
</P>
<P>
A brief history of the Southland's on-again, off-again war on the Mediterranean 
fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
July-August, 1989: Nearly three-dozen fertile Medflies are found in the Elysian 
Park area of Los Angeles. The state responds with limited malathion spraying, 
sterile releases and fruit quarantining. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 17, 1989: Orange County's first Medfly is discovered in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 30, 1989: State helicopters swoop down over an eight-square-mile area 
around Brea for Orange County's first aerial malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 8, 1989: State officials, conceding that they greatly underestimated the 
Medfly's hold in the area and its threat to the state's agriculture, 
drastically escalate their attack. They order more sprayings over a wide swath 
of residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 10, 1990: A fertile Medfly is found in Garden Grove, triggering spraying 
two weeks later in a 36-mile area that includes nine Orange County cities. 
</P>
<P>
March 20: Despite warnings from their scientific advisers, agriculture 
officials announce that spraying over most areas will end by May 9. 
</P>
<P>
May 4: Medfly scientific advisers say spraying should continue and be used more 
aggressively. State agriculture officials, conceding they were too optimistic 
about the May 9 deadline, accept the recommendation in principle. More spraying 
dates will be announced next week.

PAY ISSUE PULLS VASQUEZ AIDE INTO D.A. FRAY; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: CANDIDATE ED FREEMAN SAYS A FORMER PROSECUTOR IMPROPERLY RECEIVED 
$5,679, AND IS ACCUSED OF PLAYING POLITICS WITH THE ISSUE.

<P>
A district attorney candidate has asked the state attorney general to 
investigate whether an Orange County prosecutor-turned-aide to Supervisor Gaddi 
H. Vasquez improperly received $5,679 in county funds by collecting an 
attorney's salary while working in a lower-paying position. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Dist. Atty. Ed Freeman, who is in charge of felony trials in Orange 
County Superior Court, wrote the attorney general's office a month ago saying 
he was concerned that former Deputy Dist. Atty. Ravinder Mehta drew about $10 
an hour more than he was supposed to. 
</P>
<P>
Mehta, 30, who was paid as a prosecutor for about four months although he 
worked full-time as an executive assistant for Vasquez, denied any impropriety 
and said his reputation is being sullied to give Freeman and others a campaign 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
According to the county auditor-controller, Mehta returned the $5,769 in pay to 
the county in March from a deferred compensation account after the discrepancy 
was discovered by the district attorney's office a few months earlier. Mehta 
said he knew he would have to pay back the money after he went to work for 
Vasquez and, in preparation for that day, saved his extra earnings. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a prosecutor, and I don't do this kind of stuff," said Mehta, who 
formerly worked in Freeman's unit. "It is a campaign issue and nothing more. 
Freeman is just muddying up the waters to get some publicity, which is lacking 
for him. . . . I don't want to be a casualty in their war." 
</P>
<P>
Mehta's salary as an executive assistant for Vasquez is about $43,000 a year. 
His pay as a prosecutor was $60,000 to $70,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman wrote to Deputy Atty. Gen. Harley Mayfield, a supervisor in the 
attorney general's San Diego unit, on April 9 and requested an investigation 
into a possible theft of county funds. He said the district attorney's office 
should not look into one of its own because it represents a conflict of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like the whole affair and how it occurred," Freeman said. "It's 
tragically unfortunate that this scenario surfaces during an election year. 
This is not some sort of political maneuver. This transcends any notion of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. Rudolf Corona acknowledged receipt of Freeman's letter and 
said he has begun a routine preliminary review to determine whether a criminal 
investigation should be opened. 
</P>
<P>
"We get requests like this regularly," Corona said. "There is no indication at 
this time that there is anything criminal. The county appears to have dealt 
with the situation, but it is really far too early to say what happened." 
</P>
<P>
In January, Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom Avdeef, a candidate for district attorney, 
tried to make an issue of Mehta's salary during a news conference when he 
charged that Vasquez should not vote to appoint Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. 
Michael Capizzi as district attorney. Avdeef said Vasquez had a conflict of 
interest because one of his staff was on the district attorney's payroll. Mehta 
called the charge groundless and Vasquez voted to appoint Capizzi. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi, who is running against Freeman, Avdeef and Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. 
James Enright in the June election, called Freeman's complaint part of "the 
silly season" and "politics as usual." He said Freeman requested the attorney 
general's help to protect himself from his own mistake. 
</P>
<P>
The events in question began in April, 1989, when Mehta took a leave from his 
job in Vasquez's office, which he had accepted a few months before, to handle 
the trial of Jose Luis Razo Jr., a former Harvard University student charged 
with 10 armed robbery counts. 
</P>
<P>
Razo, whose case gained national media attention, was convicted of six robbery 
counts on June 9, and he received 10 years in prison on Aug. 25. Between Razo's 
conviction and sentencing, Mehta returned to work for Vasquez and kept his hand 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
After Razo was convicted, Mehta said he went to the district attorney's 
administrative office and was assured the paper work for his return to the 
Board of Supervisors, including the salary adjustment, would be taken care of. 
He said he told them he would handle the case through sentencing only. 
</P>
<P>
But information supplied to the attorney general's office suggests that Mehta 
told an administrative staff member he would handle the case through appeal -- 
something normally handled by the state attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
Mehta's time sheets show that he continued to be paid as a deputy district 
attorney from Aug. 25 to Dec. 8, 1989, although he was working for Vasquez. 
According to the district attorney's office, the situation was discovered in 
December during a review of vacant positions. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, the auditor-controller's office was notified that Mehta's 
transfer to Vasquez's staff was effective on Dec. 8, 1989, but on Jan. 22, the 
district attorney's office told the auditor-controller's office to change his 
official transfer date to Aug. 28, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Mehta then notified the county treasurer's office on March 7 to reimburse the 
county with funds from his deferred compensation account. "I'm glad we are 
finally getting this resolved," Mehta wrote in the memorandum. 
</P>
<P>
"Avdeef couldn't do anything with it, so Freeman is doing something now," Mehta 
said. "It is hogwash. They are running scared and don't have a prayer. I don't 
need to risk my career for something like this. I don't need the money. I never 
benefited personally." 
</P>
<P>
Mehta blames the situation on an honest error in the district attorney's 
administration and Freeman, who is ultimately responsible for the unit in which 
Mehta worked. He said Freeman knew about the situation and signed every one of 
his time sheets. 
</P>
<P>
But time sheets obtained by The Times show they were signed by Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Jack Sullens or someone else on behalf of Freeman, who denied ever 
signing the records in question. 
</P>
<P>
"Freeman is responsible for the time sheets," Capizzi said. "It was pointed out 
that they were signed by him. It was something he knew about but did nothing 
until it took on what he believed were possible criminal implications." 
</P>
<P>
Freeman said questions about Mehta's pay were handled in December by Capizzi 
and then-Dist. Atty. Cecil Hicks, who, he added, never informed him about the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked into it when they tried to point the finger at me," Freeman said. "I 
am still concerned about what the facts are. There are questions the attorney 
general must look at and answer: How were Mehta's checks being picked up? What 
did he tell the administration? How was this allowed to continue so long?"

17 MARINES HURT IN HELICOPTER ACCIDENT; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: THE TUSTIN-BASED CRAFT MADE A "HARD LANDING" DURING TRAINING 
EXERCISES AT TWENTYNINE PALMS. 
</P>

<P>
A helicopter based at the Marine Corps Air Station in Tustin made a "hard 
landing" during desert training exercises Friday, injuring all 17 Marines on 
board, officials said. None of the Marines were listed in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
Although the extent of injuries was not released, officials said three Marines 
had serious enough injuries that they were flown to the naval hospital at Camp 
Pendleton for treatment. Twelve of the Marines were still undergoing medical 
examinations late Friday night at the naval hospital in Twentynine Palms. 
</P>
<P>
Two Marines were released back to their duties after treatment, Capt. Timothy 
Hoyle said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about 2:15 p.m. at the Marine Air Ground Combat Center at 
Twentynine Palms in San Bernardino County when the CH-46E Sea Knight helicopter 
made a "hard landing," Hoyle said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the accident is under investigation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the accident, the helicopter was "participating in a combined 
arms training exercise," Hoyle said. 
</P>
<P>
No other details about the exercise were released. 
</P>
<P>
Aboard the craft were 14 infantrymen from Company E, 2nd Battalion, 9th Marine 
Regiment, 1st Marine Division, which is based at Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
The helicopter and its three crewmen belong to the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, 
headquartered at the Marine base in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Knight is considered the workhorse of the Marine helicopter force and 
has been in service since 1965. It is used by the Marines mostly as a troop 
mover. 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft is made by Boeing Vertol Co. of Philadelphia and is generally 
praised for its safety record. In 1984, the CH-46 was listed by Aviation Week 
&amp; Space Technology magazine as having one of the lowest accident rates of 
any aircraft flown by the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
The last reported local crash of a Sea Knight was in March, 1988, at Camp 
Pendleton; four Marines were injured. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, more than 30 Marines around the world have been killed in CH-46 
accidents. The most serious of those accidents occurred in 1986 when 15 Marines 
were killed when their Sea Knight crashed into the Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the helicopter was hit by a string of accidents, in which eight 
Marines were killed and 22 were injured. Seven of the eight Marines killed were 
flying in helicopters at night when the pilots were wearing night-vision 
goggles, which have been under fire in some quarters as being unsafe.

A Rosemead man was killed when his car collided with a pickup truck in Los 
Alamitos, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Chen, 25, died at Long Beach Memorial Hospital at 7:04 p.m. Thursday, 
about two hours after he was airlifted by helicopter from the crash scene. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos Police Cpl. Rod McKenzie said an initial investigation determined 
that Chen tried to make a left turn as he was leaving his workplace on Los 
Vaqueros Circle. 
</P>
<P>
Chen failed to yield the right of way and his Toyota station wagon was rammed 
by an oncoming Ford pickup, McKenzie said. 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie said Chen died from massive head, chest and abdominal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The crash was the first fatal traffic accident in Los Alamitos since October, 
1986, police said. DAVAN MAHARAJ

SMITH, FRY TO RUN FOR MAYOR IN THE FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Charles V. Smith and Councilman Frank Fry Jr. have both announced that 
they will run for mayor in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 57, is a retired aerospace engineering manager and was elected to the 
City Council in 1984 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1988, the council selected him to fill the unexpired term of former 
Mayor Elden Gillespie, who died in office. Seven months later, Smith was 
elected to a two-year term as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Fry, 64, a retired supermarket employee, has been elected to the City Council 
six times since 1966. He was chosen mayor in 1978, when the position was still 
selected by the council, and served a one-year term. The largely ceremonial 
position has been elected directly by the voters since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Potential candidates have until Aug. 10 to file for candidacy.

COUNCIL AGREES THAT MORE POLICE NEEDED

<P>
Concern about youth gangs in the Oakview section of the city dominated 
discussion of public safety issues at the City Council's daylong study session 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Ronald Lowenberg told council members that gang activity is 
increasing, "but they are presently under control." 
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that more police should be hired and a police substation 
should be located in Oakview to deal with the gang problem. 
</P>
<P>
The Oakview area is roughly bounded by Beach Boulevard, Warner and Slater 
avenues and Gothard Street. 
</P>
<P>
City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga told the council that preliminary budget 
forecasts for next year indicate the city cannot afford all of the increased 
personnel Lowenberg has requested. 
</P>
<P>
It was not disclosed during the public session how many people Lowenberg is 
seeking. 
</P>
<P>
"As I understand what the chief was telling us, he said that if we don't do 
something, we're going to lose in our efforts to keep down the gangs," 
Councilman Wes Bannister said. "I don't want to see the gang situation get out 
of control." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Jim Silva said he spent an evening riding with a police officer and 
had seen firsthand that there is a shortage of police available to handle gang 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
The council did not vote on specific budget items at the study session. The 
budget itself will not be formally presented to the council until late this 
month or early June. But the council majority indicated it will be receptive to 
Lowenberg's request for more police. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to find that money somewhere," Bannister said. "We don't want this 
problem to get out of hand." BILL BILLITER

<P>
The City Council has approved a new housing plan that calls for the 
construction of at least 48 housing units over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
The state-mandated plan, which must be revised every five years, also calls for 
saving 20 existing affordable housing units and rehabilitating five other 
existing housing units. 
</P>
<P>
City planners prepared the study by examining population and employment trends 
in La Palma to come up with a strategy for meeting local housing needs. The 
plan includes an assessment of the city's housing stock, a listing of all 
undeveloped land in the city, a statement of the city's housing goals and 
policies, and provisions for enough affordable housing. THANHTHUY NGUYEN

COURT ALLOWS STREET PROJECTS TO CONTINUE

<P>
The city may proceed with its plans to widen a one-mile stretch of Bastanchury 
Road and improve a section of Euclid Street, a Superior Court judge ruled 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Eileen C. Moore said Fullerton resident Mary B. Homme did not prove that 
city residents would be irreparably harmed if Fullerton goes ahead with the 
widening while a group of residents works to stop the projects with a ballot 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton is in the final stages of securing county funds for the Euclid 
project and in the middle of purchasing rights of way for the Bastanchury 
project. Together, the improvements will cost about $6.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Homme had sued the city in March to stop work on the projects until after the 
November election, when she and other members of the Save Our Bastanchury group 
hope to have a measure on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would ask voters whether streets should be improved if resulting 
traffic would create more noise than allowed under the city's General Plan, 
Fullerton's blueprint for commercial and residential development. TOM McQUEENEY

COUNCIL VOTES TO SUE COUNTY OVER BRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council voted this week to sue the Orange County Flood Control 
District in an effort to get a bridge built over the Brea Creek Channel near 
Malvern Avenue and Burning Tree Road. 
</P>
<P>
The bridge would connect separate sections of Burning Tree Road, creating a 
second street into an industrial subdivision under construction. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1987 decision, the City Council voted to require the developer, Santa Fe 
Pacific Realty Corp., to build the bridge and road. At that time, city 
officials thought the county would grant routine permission to cross the creek, 
said Terry Swindle, the city's real property agent. 
</P>
<P>
But the real-estate wing of the county General Services Administration put a 
$100,000 price tag on the easement for the crossing. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton officials believe the easement should cost closer to $1,000, Swindle 
said. The county's figure is based on how much the private developer would 
benefit by having a second road into the project, said Thomas Galvan, manager 
of GSA's real estate division. 
</P>
<P>
The council's unanimous vote was to ask a court to force the county to allow 
the bridge and to set a fair price for the crossing. 
</P>
<P>
"The bridge has nothing to do with flood control, so it looks like the county 
is using this just to make money," Councilman Don Bankhead said. TOM McQUEENEY

CITY TO CONTRACT FOR PROTECTION BY SHERIFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A committee's recommendation that Laguna Niguel contract with the Orange County 
Sheriff's Department to increase police services in the city has been endorsed 
by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the council directed city staff members to negotiate a final 
contract that would shift traffic services from the California Highway Patrol 
to the Sheriff's Department while increasing crime protection for the city. 
According to Councilman Jim Krembas, Laguna Niguel's population has swollen 
from 9,000 to 45,000 since 1977, with little change in police protection. 
</P>
<P>
The contract, which is expected to cost $3.3 million, will be effective July 1, 
according to Pam Van Haun, assistant to the city manager.

Despite a Chamber of Commerce plea that the marketplace should determine what 
percentage of an eatery should be open to smokers, the City Council has voted 
to more than double the amount of restaurant space that must be reserved for 
nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the unanimous vote Tuesday, restaurants will be required to 
increase their nonsmoking sections to from 25% to at least 60%. Bars and 
outdoor areas can be excluded from the calculations. The ordinance was also 
clarified to give restaurant owners the option of banning smoking entirely in 
their eateries.

Lisa Hadfield of Golden West College set a community college national record in 
the 50-yard butterfly at the state swimming championships Friday at Mt. San 
Antonio College. 
</P>
<P>
Hadfield, a freshman from Westminster High School, set the record in 25.84

</P>
<P>
Hadfield also was second in 200 freestyle Friday.

The Orange Coast women's team leads after two days with 298 points. Diablo 
Valley is second with 263 and third-place Golden West has 150.

<P>
If OCC wins the title today it will the women's second consecutive title and 
the fifth in the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's competition, Golden West leads with 365 points. Diablo Valley is 
second with 362 and OCC (332) is third. 
</P>

Twenty-mile runs, 100-mile weeks, the blast-past-everyone pace . . . . Kathleen 
Smith stopped in mid-description of her recent marathon training program and 
nearly laughed out loud. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-milers, three (Sundays) in a row," Smith said. "Can you believe that? 
Isn't that stupid?" 
</P>
<P>
To those who tend to run on the conservative side, it might well be. But to 
Smith, a 24-year-old Balboa Island resident, pressing her luck by pressing the 
pace is the ideal way to prepare for her latest venture, Sunday's Long Beach 
Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
Smith is one of several elite runners expected to challenge for Long Beach's 
$100,000 in prize money. The first-place award, for both men and women, is 
$25,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The money's not the important thing," said Smith, who works at a Newport Beach 
athletic apparel store. "I like to race. I'd race if it were for nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, in her third year at Stanford, Smith was not so enthusiastic. 
She was a prized recruit, having placed fourth in the Kinney National 
Cross-Country Championships as a high school senior in San Antonio. But she 
became increasingly frustrated with injuries and illnesses and quit the 
Cardinal. 
</P>
<P>
After a six-month break from running, Smith restarted gradually. She entered 
her first 26.2-mile race, the hilly Napa Valley Marathon, and placed third in 2 
hours 54 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Months later, she moved to Orange County and started training under the 
guidance of UC Irvine Coach Vince O'Boyle. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, in her second marathon race, Smith placed fourth in the San 
Diego Marathon in 2:45. At mile 13, she took the lead on the women's field, 
holding it until the 22-mile mark. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I crashed and burned big time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In Smith's view, her late-race slump was due to a lack of strength. The remedy, 
she believes, is an increase in her weekly mileage. About mid-March, she set 
off on her first of five 90- to 100-mile weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"But don't write that!" she said. "Or all these people will try it, go out and 
get injured." 
</P>
<P>
Which is exactly what some people expected to happen to Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Sumner, a competitive masters runner who began training with Smith a few 
months ago, said he finally had to quit running with her because she always ran 
too hard, no matter what the distance. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," said Smith, who admitted to pushing the pace. "I kind of felt sorry for 
him." 
</P>
<P>
O'Boyle, an adviser to Smith's club team, Nike Coast, said he certainly hopes 
Smith does well at Long Beach, but that he can't exactly condone the intensity 
of her training program. Smith said he would rather have her doing a few 
training sessions on the track, along with more moderate mileage on the roads. 
</P>
<P>
But Smith said she has managed to fend off injury and burnout. And she feels 
great. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I did a lot, but I'm pretty confident that it worked," Smith said. "I 
had to test it and see if it would work for me." 
</P>
<P>
After the marathon, Smith plans to take a rest, cut back on her mileage and 
train for the summer track season. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, sure I could look back and say I could have done this better or 
that better, but I feel I've done what I planned on doing. At this point, no 
matter how I do (Sunday), it's more like a celebration now. The hardest part is 
over."

ECONOMY SLOWS AS JOBLESS RATE SWELLS TO 5.4% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON

<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's economy created virtually no jobs at all in April and unemployment 
rose slightly to 5.4% in an unexpected signal of economic weakness, the Labor 
Department reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in several years, private payroll employment has declined 
for two consecutive months, pushed downward in part by weakness in construction 
and manufacturing. Even the service sector, the big job creator of the 1980s, 
showed signs of softness. 
</P>
<P>
The weak April report, the first statistical snapshot of the nation's economic 
performance last month, sharply reduces the likelihood that the Federal Reserve 
Board will attempt to crack down on a still-stubborn rate of inflation by 
raising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
"The economy is in low gear, the goods-producing sector is in trouble, so the 
next question for the Fed shouldn't be whether to tighten, but when to ease," 
said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the Fed doesn't wait until the slump arrives before they ease up," 
Kellner added. "Our main threat now is no longer inflation. It's recession." 
</P>
<P>
April's 5.4% civilian unemployment rate was up from 5.2% in March. The overall 
unemployment rate, when members of the armed forces who live in the United 
States are taken into account, was 5.3% in April, an increase from 5.1% in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
"Taken together, the data for the past two months appear to paint a very weak 
employment picture," Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, told Congress' Joint Economic Committee in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
But she noted that the softness appeared in part to be a correction of 
unusually strong job growth in January and February, which "probably overstated 
employment strength and may have contributed to the weaker data that we are now 
seeing." 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of civilian unemployment in California tracked the national averages 
exactly, at 5.4% in April, compared with 5.2% in March. 
</P>
<P>
Total non-farm employment as measured by the government's monthly survey of 
businesses increased by a mere 64,000 in April. In fact, it was only government 
hiring of 80,000 temporary Census workers that kept last month's job creation 
out of the negative column. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing employment declined by 22,000 in April and jobs in durable-goods 
industries such as automobiles fell 30,000. Norwood noted that some 300,000 
jobs have been lost in the manufacturing sector over the last 13 months. 
</P>
<P>
Some of April's job-creation weakness reflected the fact that unusually warm 
weather early in the year exaggerated Labor Department records of new jobs, 
especially in construction. 
</P>
<P>
On average, new job creation this year has been about 225,000 a month, or about 
175,000, excluding the Census hires. The monthly average in 1989 was 200,000; 
in 1988 it was 275,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Private employment has dropped now for two straight months -- and that hasn't 
happened since 1986," said David Wyss, an analyst with Data Resources Inc. in 
Lexington, Mass. "That has to be a bit scary. This should take a lot of 
pressure off the Fed to tighten." 
</P>
<P>
Economists generally agreed that the picture so far this year is consistent 
with the widespread impression of an economy that is slowing but not crashing. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the job slump in April caught many observers by surprise. The consensus 
forecast was a steady unemployment rate of 5.2% and job creation, excluding 
Census workers, in the 175,000 to 200,000 range. 
</P>
<P>
"At first sight, the April report is a shocker, much worse than expected," said 
Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch in New York. "But if you look 
at the details, it wasn't quite so bad." 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg said the loss of 100,000 construction jobs in April appears to be a 
statistical aberration caused by the effect of earlier, seasonal adjustments 
that were themselves somewhat illusory. He noted that total construction 
employment stood at 5.3 million in April, about the same level as in December. 
</P>
<P>
Of more potential concern was a slowdown in the rate of growth in service 
industry employment, which was up 51,000, excluding government hiring, after 
bigger gains in previous months. 
</P>
<P>
"The service sector has been the mainstay of jobs growth for a decade," 
Steinberg said, "and we might be seeing the beginning of a slowdown there." 
</P>
<P>
Other data released in the past week showed that goods inventories declined in 
March, factory orders and export sales rebounded and domestic consumption 
seemed sluggish -- all signs that exports are more likely than services to 
propel growth in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Labor Department reported that factory hours and overtime 
declined slightly in April, while the average work week for the month was 
unchanged -- both signs of lessening inflationary pressure on wages. 
</P>
<P>
The average hourly wage rose only 3 cents to $9.95, despite a mandatory 50-cent 
increase in the minimum wage to $3.85, effective April 1.

MAZDA COMPLETES REORGANIZATION

<P>
Mazda Motor of America Inc., the U.S. importer and distributor of Mazda 
automobiles and trucks, said it has completed a reorganization begun more than 
20 months ago with the streamlining of its sales, marketing and product 
planning functions. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the changes, which became effective May 1, the company created a new 
dealer relations unit to be headed by James Wiesner, former assistant group 
vice president for sales. 
</P>
<P>
A company spokesman said a new sales division head is still to be appointed and 
could come from outside the company. 
</P>
<P>
Mazda officials could not be reached to elaborate on the announcement, which 
was released late Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
But in a prepared statement, Chief Operating Officer Clark J. Vitulli said the 
new changes "respond to Mazda's continued growth and recent sales performance. 
It strengthens three of the critical areas for success in the '90s." Despite a 
nationwide slump in the new car market, Mazda has been posting record sales. 
</P>
<P>
Under the restructuring, corporate functions have been regrouped into new 
product planning, sales and marketing divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Sales, marketing and the dealer relations unit will report to George McCabe, 
group vice president for operations. 
</P>
<P>
Product planning, parts, service, logistics, information systems, human 
resources and public relations will report to Vitulli. 
</P>
<P>
The new Sales Division encompasses MMA's five regional offices, a new truck 
sales position, dealer development, sales planning, fleet sales, vehicle 
distribution and business management. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Thompson, previously vice president for advertising, has been named vice 
president for marketing. Merchandising, market planning, training, motor sports 
and advertising will report to her, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
William Hackett, former head of the Marketing Division, has been named vice 
president for product planning.

TOP MARIACHIS HEADLINE SANTA ANA FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cinco de Mayo and mariachis are as inseparable as the Fourth of July and 
fireworks, and in downtown Santa Ana, the most vibrantly Latino area in Orange 
County, typically there is no shortage of the traditional Mexican bands on May 
5. 
</P>
<P>
Finding a professional, creative band among the ensembles that emerge from 
Santa Ana's bars for the day is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
This year, however, the mariachis will be not only numerous but also very, very 
good: Two of the top mariachis in Southern California -- Los Camperos de Nati 
Cano and Mariachi Uclatlan -- will headline a two-day, 14-hour mariachi 
festival that will also bring junior high, high school and college bands to 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything you do down here with Mexican culture is successful -- that's 
automatic," said Florinda Mintz-Yoder, marketing director for Fiesta 
Marketplace, the sponsor and locale of the event. "But there aren't always 
quality requirements, and we wanted to do something different . . . with an 
artistic challenge, a focus and a lot of energy." 
</P>
<P>
The festival, the first of its kind in Orange County, is patterned after 
international mariachi festivals held annually in Tucson and San Antonio. If 
it's successful -- and, given the lineup and free admission, it is hard to 
imagine that it won't be -- the Santa Ana festival could become an annual event 
with conferences and classes for younger mariachis like those conducted at the 
Southwestern festivals, Mintz-Yoder said. 
</P>
<P>
In booking Los Camperos, the festival is getting the top group in Los Angeles 
and one of the best in the country. They were one of the groups that backed 
Linda Ronstadt on her album of mariachi standards, "Canciones de Mi Padre," and 
have played at La Fonda, their landmark L.A. restaurant on Wilshire Boulevard, 
for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Nati Cano, the bandleader and third-generation mariachi who says he gave up 
playing "40 pounds ago," was a pioneer in bringing mariachi music out of rough 
barrooms and introducing it to middle-class audiences in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But the band was a victim of its own success as well. By playing every night in 
a restaurant that became a tourist attraction, the group gave up some of its 
creativity and tightness, as different members were given nights off and little 
time was left for rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
For the past year or so, Los Camperos has let the Orange-based Mariachi 
Uclatlan cover for them two nights a week while Cano whips his group into 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
The difference is telling, says Mark Fogelquist, the leader of Uclatlan and 
artistic director of this weekend's festival. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Camperos has never been better," said Fogelquist, an ethnomusicologist who 
studied mariachi music at UCLA in the 1970s. "They're like a boxer who puts on 
the gloves and goes straight for the knockout -- they really knock out the 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
For both groups, the festival is a chance to let thousands of people hear 
mariachi music at a new level and in a setting that gives this traditional, 
highly developed art form its due. 
</P>
<P>
A few solo singers from Santa Ana and Mexico will join the mariachis for part 
of the program, but unlike other festivals, which rely on a few big-name 
singers such as Ronstadt, Vicki Carr or Vicente Fernandez to sell thousands of 
high-priced tickets, the Santa Ana festival focuses squarely on the mariachis. 
</P>
<P>
"Nati's been talking for years about letting the mariachis shine," said 
Fogelquist. "His goal has been to make them a show in itself. We subscribe to 
that idea." 
</P>
<P>
Fogelquist and his brother, Jim, have been among the leaders in Orange County 
in giving mariachi music a suitable stage. Having begun as a student group at 
UCLA -- hence the name -- the Mariachi Uclatlan has evolved into Orange 
County's best and since 1981 has played in El Mariachi restaurant in Orange, 
which is owned by the Fogelquists and a few other longtime band members. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, the group has added a harp and two violins to bring its 
number to an even dozen. Uclatlan's arranger, Juan Manuel Cortes -- who is 
serving as the festival's music director -- is coming into his own and 
beginning to build up the group's stylized repertoire, said Mark Fogelquist. 
</P>
<P>
"Our group is known for fairly refined playing," Fogelquist said. "We haven't 
developed power -- we don't collect guys with big voices and temperaments. They 
cause too many problems." 
</P>
<P>
One theme embodied in the festival lineup is the idea of keeping mariachi music 
alive among Latino youth. Besides Uclatlan and Los Camperos, both of which are 
successful enough to play in their own restaurants, the festival will feature 
mariachis from Belvedere Junior High School and Roosevelt High School in Los 
Angeles County; Mariachi Mexicapan, a young East Los Angeles group; and the 
UCLA student mariachi. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a big student movement that we try to cultivate," said Jim 
Fogelquist. "We're trained as teachers, and we want to keep the tradition alive 
as far as we can. We're certainly not in it for the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Mariachi Festival 1990 will take place today and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
at Fiesta Marketplace, 4th and Spurgeon streets, Santa Ana. The Mariachi 
Uclatlan is scheduled to play at 12:20, 1:20 and 3:30 p.m. today and at 3:30 
p.m. on Sunday. Los Camperos de Nati Cano will perform at 2 and 5 p.m. today 
and Sunday. The two groups will play together both days at 5:20 p.m. and will 
be joined by all other mariachis at the festival for the final 20 minutes. 
Admission: free. Information: (714) 550-0910.

HELPING YOUNG PEOPLE LOOK AT 'WHY' OF DEATH;

A play for children . . . about death? 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Repertory Young Conservatory Players, best known for upbeat 
adaptations of familiar children's classics, is challenging its actors and 
audience alike with Aurand Harris' "The Arkansaw Bear," opening today at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
Harris' critically praised play gently traces the stages of emotion felt by the 
dying and their survivors through a fantasy odyssey undertaken by Tish, a 
little girl whose grandfather is dying, and an aging performing bear. Together 
they seek the "why" of death. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get deeper into it, you realize we're doing a play about living," 
said director Diane Doyle, who noted that the work does not touch on specific 
religious beliefs. "The little girl is a footprint, part of a cycle; she 
carries on." 
</P>
<P>
Doyle promised that the show is not shadows and gloom; it has a circus theme 
with clowns, acrobats, a high-wire act, a fairy named Star Bright and the 
dancing Bear. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a scary play," she said. "The message is subtle. It provokes 
conversations, opens the door, so the subject doesn't remain undiscussed. It's 
not a downer, either; Harris makes us laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so simple. It's just the carrying on of the family, the cherishing of 
positive memories." 
</P>
<P>
"The Arkansaw Bear" gives Doyle a chance to fulfill a longtime desire to 
provide theater to older audiences, ages 10 and up, rather than the much 
younger audiences who are most often targeted by children's theater. 
</P>
<P>
She said what her company is doing "should be called theater for youth, not 
children's theater. We want to do plays with words, thoughts and ideas and get 
away a little bit from 'color and noise.' Older children (have been) missing 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Doyle admitted that there may be some difficulty in building that new audience, 
when patrons in the past have felt Players' shows were appropriate for babies 
and toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're marketing differently, using an older approach," Doyle said. "You just 
grit your teeth and hope that older group comes in." 
</P>
<P>
The cast features eight young people, ages 12 to 17, plus four adults. To 
prepare her young actors for the sensitive subject matter, Doyle said: "We had 
a lot of discussion before rehearsing; we really had to talk this all out. I 
make sure my actors know why they're saying what they're saying." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Miller, 17, a theater arts major at Fullerton College, plays the 
World's Greatest Dancing Bear. He was surprised and intrigued by his role. 
</P>
<P>
"In many ways," he said, "the Bear is both the comic relief and the serious 
part of the play; one minute he prances around the stage with pretentious 
monologues in a bad English accent, the next he's weeping at the feet of Death. 
</P>
<P>
"Tish (played by Christine Farrell) helps him figure out what's happening as 
much as he helps her." 
</P>
<P>
Miller was surprised to find how closely he identified with the role. "The 
Bear's a lot like me," he said, "because he's always on, always entertaining 
everybody. I'm a lot like that in real life, I tend to walk around and make 
incredibly bad jokes all the time." 
</P>
<P>
The most difficult part of the role has been playing age, Miller said. "He's an 
old bear, and I'm 17. A teen-ager tends to be all over the place -- the Bear 
still has a lot of energy, but has to be more subdued. You have to focus more." 
</P>
<P>
Miller relates to the play on a more serious level as well, saying that it 
echoes the denial and finally the acceptance he felt at the loss of a close 
family friend not long ago. "It's pretty much the process I went through," he 
said. 
</P>

Arkansaw Bear" is in Founders Hall, Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600

Orange County Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R -- Lomita) will serve as a juror for a 
"conservative art" contest whose sponsor, Pasadena-based radio station KKLA, 
hopes to attract exhibition funding from the National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just basically participating in a spoof," Rohrabacher said Thursday from 
his office in Washington. "A lot of things the NEA has funded in the past look 
strange to most Americans. The other aspect of (the contest) is mainly aimed at 
drawing attention to the fact that quite often more classical and traditional 
artists are discriminated against in favor of the weird and wacko." 
</P>
<P>
The contest was announced Friday at a press conference in Los Angeles. KKLA 
(99.5 FM), which claims its biggest audience is in Orange County, bills itself 
as the largest religious talk station in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like the NEA to recognize all forms of art, not just the artistic 
elite," says Jeff Powell, producer of John Stewart's drive-time talk show, 
"Live from LA." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't feel the average taxpayer should fund the NEA. But if we must, then 
the average taxpayer should have a say in what art actually is. If you're 
taking money from the general population, the artistic elite shouldn't 
determine what art is." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher, who has repeatedly stressed his opposition to federal funding for 
the arts, will judge only the "best satire" category of the contest. The 
winning works in this category are likely to involve "some kind of parody on 
the NEA, or on obscene art or some kind of political parody directed to the 
'croissant elite' in the political community," according to Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
Told that KKLA is serious about getting the NEA to fund a show of the winning 
work, Rohrabacher said he had "no intention of doing anything that would try to 
pressure the NEA on any specific artworks, one way or the other." 
</P>
<P>
"I've given people at the NEA a lot of grief for funding things most people 
think are obscene or indecent . . . but I've never really told them to fund 
what I like. My role as a congressman is not to pressure the NEA to sponsor any 
specific work of art. . . . I'll put a big disclaimer on my participation." 
</P>
<P>
Participation in the contest, which closes June 1, is open to amateur and 
professional artists working in all media. There are no guidelines on subject 
matter. In addition to best of show, three awards will be given to work in each 
of four categories: most creative, most inspirational, best satire and most 
conservative. Stewart says the latter category has to do with upholding 
"traditional family values." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Rohrabacher, the show's other jurors are Tim Solliday, a Pasadena 
painter and illustrator who works in a traditional style; Lindsey Price, a 
teen-age actress in Disney films and commercials; and talk show host Stewart of 
Yorba Linda, who was a leader of a public protest against the film "The Last 
Temptation of Christ" in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Powell said he has been in contact with several possible venues for an 
exhibition but wouldn't specify them. He said he has made some inquiries at the 
NEA about the exhibit but refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Told by a reporter that the NEA funds only exhibitions sponsored by a nonprofit 
group, Stewart said he was certain a suitable space could be found ("even 
churches, schools," he suggested). 
</P>
<P>
Susan Ludowsky, director of the Visual Arts Program at the NEA, said her 
program funds only artists and nonprofit groups. "It's very rare that we fund 
an exhibition." (The NEA's Museum Program pays for exhibitions, but only those 
sponsored by a nonprofit arts organization.) 
</P>
<P>
"From time to time," Ludowsky said, "we're asked what proportion of grants we 
award to realist artists. Generally speaking, approximately half of our awards 
do go to artists working representationally, but that general category is very 
broad. To isolate artists working in a traditional academic style would be 
highly subjective. However, I can certainly say that those artists are 
represented within this larger pool." 
</P>
<P>
Ludowsky mentioned such better-known realist artists as Martha Alf of San 
Diego; Catherine Murphy of Poughkeepsie, N.Y.; Julie Bozzie of Ft. Worth, Tex.; 
Altoon Sultan of New York City, and Willard Dixon of San Rafael as recipients 
of grants from the Visual Arts Program. She added that "many lesser-known 
artists working in this manner" have also received grants. 
</P>
<P>
In a press release Stewart is quoted as saying the exhibition would "determine 
whether the NEA is merely a front for anti-Establishment liberal bigots intent 
on censoring conservative expression." 
</P>
<P>
Informed that the NEA does fund artists who make traditional art, Stewart said 
he was "pleased it does happen. . . . Rather than attacking the NEA, this 
(exhibit) will give them a chance to act consistently with what they (believe) 
they are and promote art that is appreciated by a diverse group of people, 
especially the conservative majority . . . who would not consider (photographs 
by Robert) Mapplethorpe to be art." 
</P>
<P>
Last year's cancellation by the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington of an 
NEA-funded exhibit that included homoerotic photographs by Mapplethorpe lit the 
still-simmering debate between defenders of artistic freedom and defenders of 
traditional values in art. 
</P>
<P>
Solliday, the juror whose art includes both landscapes and figurative paintings 
illustrating scenes from the Bible and literary works, said he believes 
"relativistic thinking has taken its toll on the art world" ever since the 
heyday of Impressionism. 
</P>
<P>
In his view, even Vincent van Gogh was "nowhere near the same (exalted) 
category" as 19th-Century academic painter William Adolph Bougereau. Solliday 
sees his role as an academic painter as "trying to bring beautiful art back 
into people's consciousness."
