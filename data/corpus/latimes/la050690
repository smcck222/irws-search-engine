JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: SPIDERS IN THE SPINES; 
</P>
<P>
DID THE BOMB SQUAD REALLY RUSH OVER TO KEEP THE BIG CACTUS FROM EXPLODING?

THE URBAN MYTH, or fable, is like the mythical dragon that can't be killed: Cut 
off its head, it grows another. (If there is no such mythical beast, I have 
just invented it.) 
</P>
<P>
We keep hearing these fables: 
</P>
<P>
 -- About the jealous husband who poured the contents of a concrete mixer into 
his wife's lover's convertible. 
</P>
<P>
 -- About the helpful driver (always a woman) who is told that to push-start a 
stalled car equipped with an automatic transmission, she must first get it up 
to a speed of 35 m.p.h. So she gets the rescue car up to 35 m.p.h. and bangs 
into the stalled car at that speed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- About the compacted VW Bug -- with bodies enclosed -- that is found days 
later between the front ends of two trucks that collided at high speed. 
</P>
<P>
Such tales are so indestructible that it seems pointless to invent new ones, 
but they keep coming along. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis L. Jones of Temple City writes to ask whether I believe the following: 
</P>
<P>
"It seems a couple bought a large potted saguaro cactus from a nursery. They 
had it in their home for a few days when they noticed it was moving. They 
called the nursery and questioned them about it. The nurseryman told them to 
leave the house immediately, call 911 from their neighbor's and explain what 
was happening to the police. They followed his instructions, and the police 
sent the bomb squad out, entered the home with full bomb gear on, covered the 
cactus with a large tarp and put it in the bomb container. The reason for all 
this was that tarantulas breed inside this type of cactus, (which has) been 
known to actually blow apart with tarantulas flying everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
The most improbable thing about that story is that anybody would believe it. 
Jones says his daughter heard the story from a friend of the principals. It is 
never closer than that: a friend of a friend. 
</P>
<P>
The best urban fables are those that might be true; some even do have a grain 
of truth in them. A popular myth in recent years is that New York City's sewers 
are infested with alligators -- the progeny of baby alligators dropped into 
toilets by vacationers who brought them back from Florida as pets and tired of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
In their book "There Are Alligators in Our Sewers" (Delacorte), Paul Dickson 
and Joseph G. Goulden report an interview with a former sewers commissioner who 
said that in 1935 his men discovered 2-foot-long alligators in the sewer and 
cleaned them out with rifles and poison. 
</P>
<P>
In his book on urban fables "Curses! Broiled Again!" (Norton), Jan Harold 
Brunvand tells the apocryphal story of a wife who stopped her camper by the 
roadside for a moment, and then, not knowing that her husband had stepped out 
of the rear in his underwear, drove off, leaving him behind. 
</P>
<P>
That appears often as an urban myth, Brunvand says; yet it did happen to a Red 
Bluff, Calif., woman, whose husband stopped their camper at a gas station and 
then drove off, leaving her in a restroom with 23 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Evidently, it also happened to my recent acquaintance, Nardi Reeder Campion, 
who described the experience in Family Circle (August, 1985) under the title 
"Gas Station Blues." Mrs. Campion is the author of the much-pirated list of 
common conveniences invented after her Wellesley class of 1938 graduated -- or 
as she put it, things her class was before -- and I think of her as imaginative 
but believable. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Campion wrote that she and her husband were driving from West Palm Beach 
to Hobe Sound in a small rented car. She was asleep in the back seat when her 
husband stopped at a gas station to use the telephone. Without him seeing her 
leave, she got out and went to the women's room. He finished his call, got in 
the car and drove away. She waited impatiently for her husband to return. He 
did not. Having already missed the cocktail hour at Hobe Sound, she telephoned 
their host. He came after her. When they reached his house, her husband was 
already there, having a cocktail with their hostess. 
</P>
<P>
I not only believe Mrs. Campion's story but I also believe that this same sort 
of thing must happen quite often -- too often to be called an urban myth. I 
might very well have driven off from a gas station and left my wife behind, 
except that she sleeps in the front seat, not the back, so I would probably 
have missed her sooner or later. I wonder, though, whether husbands don't 
sometimes drive off and leave their wives behind deliberately. Or vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
However, a saguaro exploding with tarantulas is too improbable, it seems to me, 
even to be included in a book of fables. And that reporting such a fear to 911 
would get you the bomb squad is about as likely as getting a plumber on Sunday.

VIEWING A WORLD BETWEEN WARS; 
</P>
<P>
LACMA PHOTOGRAPHY SHOW OFFERS AN ELECTRONIC AGE VISION OF THE WAY WE WERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It looked pretty much like a traditional, if superior, survey of classic 
modernist photography when it opened at Manhattan's Metropolitan Museum of Art 
last winter. The sense that there was something funny about it was so vague one 
was inclined to write it off to gloomy weather. "The New Vision" is another of 
a worthy brace of photo shows celebrating the 150th birthday of the medium. It 
concentrates on innovations forged between the two world wars. Alfred 
Stieglitz, Man Ray, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy and about 65 more masters in 125 prints 
make up the all-star cast, along with some surprises like shots by 
non-photographers like Rene Magritte and Constantin Brancusi. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing wrong with that. 
</P>
<P>
There will still be nothing wrong with it when the exhibition opens Thursday at 
the County Museum of Art. Here, however, it becomes clear that that feeling of 
oddity at the Met was about something real, at least about something 
aesthetically real. By a coincidence too perfect to have been planned, "The New 
Vision" appears at LACMA simultaneously with two other compelling shows about 
art from the 1920's and '30s. "Envisioning America" concerns the modernist 
imaginings of George Grosz and other German artists in Berlin during the 
yeasty, decadent days of the Weimar Republic. "Thomas Hart Benton; An American 
Original" revives a long-scorned artist who gave American an heroically cozy, 
drawlingly consoling, mythic image of itself during the dark days of the Great 
Depression. 
</P>
<P>
What does it all mean? 
</P>
<P>
Those who poke through art exhibitions like seers sifting through ashes are 
liable to see omens on the wall. It is the final decade of the century. As the 
millennium approaches so do the doomsday fantasies that go with closing 
centuries. No wonder people are asking themselves if the tinseled, hedonistic 
'80s just past were not like the '20s they resemble -- the end of modernism, a 
prelude to economic disaster and apocalypse. 
</P>
<P>
And no wonder, then, these exhibitions seem both compelling familiar and 
poignantly remote. History doesn't really repeat itself, it just intimidates us 
into thinking it's going to. What history does do is move on like a river 
propelling the raft of civilization along, zagging from one bank to the other. 
Occasionally we land on a sand bar to take stock, look at the other shore where 
we used to be and realize we are never going to get back to that point again. 
</P>
<P>
These exhibitions feel like something seen back across the Rubicon. They are 
about a place in time to which we will never return. 
</P>
<P>
But where were we? 
</P>
<P>
We stand on the shore of the Electronic World looking back at the Machine Age. 
"The New Vision " provides clear understanding of how intimately modernism was 
mixed up with machinery -- celebrating it, hating it, coping with it or riding 
the excitement of its power like a mechanical bull in a Texas bar. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally an exhibition of photographs would do that. They are, after all made 
mechanically and these looked, mesmerized, at a mechanical world. 
</P>
<P>
The show and its superior book-catalogue divide into subject-matter sections 
which subdivide into poetic leitmotifs. One show that the nude body came to 
imitate perfect, spare machinery and then literally turned into a mechanical 
robot in Hans Belmer's "The Doll." Mechanical objectivity turned in on itself, 
exploding into the Hindenburg disaster, imploding into cracked absurdity in 
John Heartfield's Dadaist shot of a press worker whose head has turned into a 
newspaper. The French call it la deformation professionnelle. 
</P>
<P>
The New York skyline was formed by industrial-mechanical advance. In Bernice 
Abbott's elongated peek down Exchange Place in 1933 the ambience of power is 
still stylish and humane. The best picture in the city section may be Lewis 
Hines' breathtaking shot of a laborer suspended on a cable called "Icarus, 
Empire State Building." The worker was an individual, a mythic figure. Today 
the myth is unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
Behind this crisp, avant-garde photography lay the notion that the medium 
should stop trying to look like painting and look like itself. That simple 
decision gives it a jolting freshness. Moholy-Nagy's shot of an empty street on 
New Year's morning in 1930 is practically devoid of people but it's not about 
the kind of abandonment and existential anomie such an image would be now. The 
concrete is clean, solid and confident. New York doesn't look like that no 
more. Its teeming crowds are like so many predatory computerized Pac-Men. 
</P>
<P>
Machinery itself is celebrated as if its bolts and cogs were parts of some 
magnificent piano on which to play the social symphony. Ralph Steiner loved 
power switches. Now we love power breakfasts. Symptom of a service society. 
</P>
<P>
Walker Evans saw what a world of checkered cabs and El stairs did to a black 
woman in 1929. Her humanity was ennobled by her fur coat and cloche hat. In 
those days a successful blend with the melting pot was a source of pride. Today 
subcultural separation is king. 
</P>
<P>
In Paris, Brassai saw that the leisure created by Industrial Age wealth caused 
young dudes to go to the bordello and pick a girl from the nude buffet. Some 
things don't change. Murder became more matter-of-fact in Weegee's downshot of 
the cops photographing a head fallen from a cake box. 
</P>
<P>
At first it's irritating to come across the brace of celebrity photos -- Gary 
Cooper by George Holyningen-Huene, Marlene Dietrich by James Doolittle, Picasso 
by Man Ray. What is this, some artworld version of People magazine? New 
York-L.A. obsession with celebrity? Then the point strikes you and you 
paraphrase Gloria Swanson in "Sunset Boulevard" intoning, "Then they had 
faces!" We have an official style so bland that Gary Trudeau can't figure a way 
to depict the President of the United States. Thank goodness for Sen. Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan, one of the last living faces. 
</P>
<P>
Modernist photography developed hand in glove with advanced painting and 
sculpture, sharing its aesthetic concerns. Stieglitz's gallery showed Cezanne 
as well as photo art. Man Ray painted. El Lizitsky took Malevich's painting as 
a model and Moholy-Nagy worked at the German Bauhaus with the painters. 
</P>
<P>
But photography was headed another way. As Christopher Phillips points out in 
his catalogue essay, the approach of World War II caused more and more 
photographers to think of their art as a social tool that should operate in the 
real world as reporter and documentary witness. After the war, art 
photographers reversed the trend, readapting the techniques of the original 
avant-garde to a means of private expression that many of the pioneers had come 
to see as outmoded. In a sense it was over before it was over. 
</P>
<P>
Today photography lives in a land of such blended borders as to be almost 
indistinguishable as a free-standing medium. Galleries show fashion 
photographers hip-on-thigh with metaphysical visionaries. Conceptual art has so 
thoroughly absorbed photography that observers don't even bother to make 
crucial distinctions between the differing wavelengths broadcast by painting 
and photography. In the newspaper business, "art" refers to the photograph 
reproduced to illustrate a story. 
</P>
<P>
So here we stand amid the anonymous hum of the Electronic shore looking across 
time to an irretrievable place where things were clear. Maybe it's just 
hindsight.

<P>
The men who wait for work at El Mosco have been accused of being "dirty," 
"rude" and "intimidating"? As recent immigrants and for the sake of survival, 
perhaps they are simply mimicking the society that surrounds them. 
</P>
<P>
The article told of quite a few dirty, rude and intimidating Norteamericanos. 
</P>
<P>
We must abandon our "them" and "us" attitude because these people will not stop 
migrating in search of a better life. And we cannot expect decent behavior from 
people who have been shown none.

It is about time for responsible journals to illustrate the fact that illegal 
aliens are just that: They are in this country illegally. The national 
consensus, as represented by current law, is that we, as a nation, do not want 
all of the world's poor people to move to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
It is indeed unfortunate that the world today is populated mainly by people 
living in poverty; it is equally unfortunate that the United States cannot 
eliminate world poverty by absorbing all of the world's poor into its 
population. Immigrant "rights" groups would serve future generations better by 
devoting their energies to advocating birth control in Third World countries 
rather than advocating absorbing excess population into this country.

Powers Boothe will play Jessica Lange's extramarital lover in Orion's "Blue 
Sky," a drama directed by Tony Richardson, that takes place on a southern Army 
base in the 1950s. The Bob Solo production, which also stars Tommy Lee Jones as 
Lange's husband, gets under way this month in Alabama and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Pamela Reed will play Arnold Schwarzenegger's partner in Universal's 
'Kindergarten Cop." Ivan Reitman directs this story of a hard-bitten cop who 
goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher to keep track of a drug kingpin's 
wife and child. Filming gets under way in June in Oregon and L.A. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Lowe, F. Murray Abraham and Juergen Prochnow play the men in Helena 
Rubenstein's early life and Shelley Winters the Jewish shopkeeper who first 
employs her in "Helena," a Cosfilm production shooting in Poland, New Zealand 
and Australia starting July 16. The film is based on Paul-Loup Sulitzer's novel 
"Hannah," a fictionalized account of her life, which was a best seller in 
France. Producer-director Georges-Alain Vuille is still looking for his leading 
actress. 
</P>
<P>
James Edward Olmos will star in and Luis Valdez will direct "Bless Me, Ultima," 
a film version of Rudolfo Anaya's famous novel of New Mexico set in 1945, the 
era of the A-bomb. Moctesuma Esparza and Robert Katz will produce from a script 
written by Valdez and Vincent Gutierrez. Production gets under way in New 
Mexico this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Esparza/Katz Prods. has cast Australian pop singing star and actress 
Kylie Minogue in "Most Wanted," a '30s gangster tale written by Dick Guttman. 
Sam Pillsbury will direct in North Carolina in the fall. Negotiations are under 
way for a U.S. distributor on both films. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Steiger and Joanna Pacula join previously announced Timothy Bottoms and Pat 
Morita in Gold Leaf International's thriller "The Ice Runner," which films in 
Murmansk in the Soviet Union in late June. Jeffrey Sneller produces and James 
Fargo directs. Meanwhile, Fargo has bowed out of Eagle Films' "Deadly 
Crossing," a thriller about a giant snake in the Amazon, which will shoot in 
Florida in September. British director Peter Hunt takes over. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Primus joins the cast of writer-director Irwin Winkler's "Fear No Evil" 
(due for a title change), a drama about the Red scare era in Hollywood. Primus 
plays the agent for Robert De Niro who portrays a successful director who finds 
himself blacklisted. Ben Piazza has also been cast to play movie mogul Darryl 
F. Zanuck. 
</P>
<P>
The Oscar-winning "My Left Foot" provides plenty of kick for any project to 
which its writer-director, Jim Sheridan, attaches his name. By agreeing to 
serve as "story consultant" on "Illegals" -- a film written and to be directed 
by Nye Heron, his assistant on "My Left Foot" -- the project raised enough 
money in the U.S. and Europe to begin production in mid-July in the Bronx. The 
Mike George Production tells of a romance between two illegal immigrants, an 
Irish lad and a Dominican woman. KIRK HONEYCUTT

STAGE WEEK: 'EASTERN STANDARD' TO OPEN AT COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"If you were to translate one of Noel Coward's comedies to '80s terms, this 
would be it," said director Johnathon Pape of Richard Greenberg's New York-set 
"Eastern Standard," opening Saturday at the Coast Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"Standard's" credentials are impressive: a reading at Seattle Rep, followed by 
a run at the Manhattan Theatre Club and six-month stint on Broadway in '89. 
"It's a comedy for our time," Pape noted. "The characters are sophisticated, 
intelligent, witty; I hate to use the word 'yuppie,' but OK, let's use it. They 
look good, they talk good, they went to the best schools, they eat at the best 
restaurants. But for some reason, they're not happy." 
</P>
<P>
At fault, the director believes, is a go-for-the-gold culture that's been high 
on external achievements but low on moral values. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it: The '80s were a lot about greed, haves and have-nots," he said 
dryly. "Now these two couples -- one's a gay couple, the other's straight -- 
are having to learn to relate to other people, find the human side. In a world 
that's been about being young and successful and beautiful and charming, 
they're suddenly forced to re-evaluate, regroup, deal with issues. It's also a 
language play, with a lot of snappy repartee. And it's about the way people 
talk to each other, instead of with each other." 
</P>
<P>
The cast includes Lorna Patterson, Gordon Thomson, Lynn Milgrim, Richard 
Waterhouse, Christie Mellor and Andrew Kreiss. 
</P>
<P>
THEATER BUZZ: Inquiring minds wanted to know if it was true that Charlotte Rae 
(playing buried-up-to-her-neck Winnie in "Happy Days" in the Taper's "50/60" 
series) was accompanied by an unseen prompter, hidden beneath the huge mound. A 
Taper spokeswoman confirmed that a prompter "is there as a security blanket." 
There were gaps as long as two weeks between some of the performances, which 
are done in repertory with five other shows, she noted, and "there are a lot of 
words to remember (in the play), when you're doing it that infrequently." 
</P>
<P>
CRITICAL CROSSFIRE: John Burrows wrote the book/lyrics and Andy Whitfield the 
music for "It's a Girl!" (at the Odyssey Theatre), about a quintet of spirited 
British women facing pregnancy -- and fighting a nuclear waste dump. 
</P>
<P>
Said The Times' T. H. McCulloh: "On a realistic, typical Brit pub setting by 
Craig Lathrop and under Kathi O'Donohue's smooth lighting, 'It's a Girl!' 
brings a breath of fresh air to a couple of less than fresh subjects. It's a 
charmer." 
</P>
<P>
From the Daily News' Lawrence Enscoe: "You're not likely to find a better 
directed or acted show anywhere in town. This is political theater at its best, 
most engaging, and with several spoonfuls of sugar to make the medicine go 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Wrote the L.A. Weekly's Ellen Krout-Hasegawa: "Though blessed with a fine 
ensemble . . . (it) still strains the ear, sounding tediously 'politically 
correct' and painfully out of tune with the paradoxes and questions facing 
feminism today." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Drama-Logue's Larry Jonas found "a delicious musical, stylishly cast with 
five distaff charmers, and with a social message well worth a listen."

POP FACES: THE ECCENTRICITIES OF 'MISS AMERICA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a recent issue of Rolling Stone magazine, prominent rockers were asked to 
name their favorite records of 1989. No. 1 on the list turned in by Cowboy 
Junkies singer Margo Timmins was "Miss America," the much-heralded but 
little-heard debut album by Mary Margaret O'Hara, a fellow Toronto native. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Junkies like O'Hara so much they recorded her album's closing 
song, "You Will Be Loved Again," as the capper to their own new effort. Michael 
Stipe of R.E.M. also had O'Hara's record high on his Rolling Stone list as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Told of this approval by a jury of her peers, O'Hara's response is typically 
Canadian: "Really? Good kids, eh?" 
</P>
<P>
"Miss America" is essentially a lovely, lulling, spiritual album, and it 
includes some reasonably accessible torch balladry. It also has plenty of rough 
edges and, in conveying the broken-up patterns of thought, not speech, O'Hara 
sometimes takes her voice into irrational rants that are almost Yoko Ono-like. 
</P>
<P>
"I am usually trying to jump out of my own skin," she explains. "Not trying, 
though -- it's natural. You know how you can do something and your brain's just 
a little bit behind? The thought of doing it is a little bit behind the action? 
. . . I don't like to watch where I'm going. It could be the feeling of jazz or 
improvisation." 
</P>
<P>
Her record company biography describes her, tongue-in-cheek, as "no mere 
eccentric." Does she tire of that tag? 
</P>
<P>
"Quirky is another good one. Eccentric? I don't know. You don't do it to be 
idiosyncratic, you do it because you have your own logic about it, and all you 
want to do is have the right to keep that intact. I came up with a term that 
wasn't so bad. What was it? 'Agrestic subconscious soul singer' -- that's good! 
But when people start calling you 'twisted pop' or whatever, you think, gee. .

NOTEBOOK: WINTER OF DISCONTENT AT FOUR SEASONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joseph Seppi Renggli, who has been executive chef of New York's famed Four 
Seasons -- one of the most famous and respected restaurants in the country -- 
for some 17 years, has been dismissed from his post. 
</P>
<P>
Renggli, reached recently at his Upstate New York home, says simply, "From one 
minute to the next, they told me they don't need me anymore." 
</P>
<P>
According to some reports, he was to remain with the Four Seasons as a 
consultant until the end of the year -- but, says Renggli, 'I left the 
restaurant a month ago, and so far they haven't called me." Though he has 
remained friendly with the establishment's proprietors, Tom Margattai and Paul 
Kovi, Renggli adds, "I guess I couldn't get along with the younger group" -- 
presumably meaning manager Alex von Bidder and Grill manager Julian Niccolini. 
</P>
<P>
The Swiss-born Renggli first came to the United States in 1966, to work for the 
Restaurant Associates group -- which then owned the Four Seasons -- as chef at 
the now-defunct Latin-American-themed Fonda del Sol. Now, he says, after a week 
in May in New Orleans, cooking at a Cajun food festival with Paul Prudhomme, he 
will go back to work for R.A. -- this time as executive chef for the American 
Harvest and Sea Grill restaurants in Rockefeller Center. His replacement at the 
Four Seasons is his longtime assistant, Christian (Hitch) Albin (also 
Swiss-born), who formerly held the title of kitchen chef. Ironically, Albin's 
own new assistant will be Stefano Battistini, who has been chef at the Sea 
Grill. 
</P>
<P>
Asked for a comment about Renggli's departure, Paul Kovi replies, "There's not 
really much to add to the published reports. We have great respect for Seppi, 
but the time came for the separation in a long marriage. Really, we just found 
that we have to go in a different direction, in a different style." He adds, 
though, that it was Renggli who first raised the possibility, about two years 
ago, of partially retiring from the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before Renggli's dismissal, critic Jane Freiman, reviewing the 
restaurant in New York Newsday, had demoted it from three stars ("excellent") 
to one ("good"). Though she quite rightly described Renggli as "one of the 
first kitchen superstars," her review was otherwise filled with words like 
sodden, flavorless, meager, greasy, hideously overcooked, and sickeningly sweet 
-- and she concluded that the place was "a culinary legend that is running the 
risk of becoming a myth." Some observers have suggested that this review was 
the last straw, finally prompting Margattai and Kovi to give Renggli his 
walking papers. "No," says Kovi, "that's not the way it happened. But the 
article was basically a correct one." 
</P>
<P>
WE'D RATHER BE EMPTY: Camelions proprietor Marsha Sands, her son Gene and 
Provencal baker Maite Lombard have very quietly opened Pastis in Topanga. The 
restaurant, now serving breakfast and dinner, features homemade breads and 
pastries, assorted pastas, whole fish roasted Provencal-style in an open 
fireplace, and other specialties of the south of France. Though Pastis is 
already jammed with Topanga locals who have been watching the space for months 
in anticipation, it is apparently attempting to keep a low profile. When one 
Topanga resident called up to ask if the place was indeed in business, whoever 
answered the phone replied, "Well, we're open but we'd really rather you didn't 
come in yet." And Marsha Sands herself, taking such reticence one step further, 
told this column flatly, a few days after Pastis opened, that it had not yet 
opened. 
</P>
<P>
SALT AND PEPPER: Some of the area's best chefs -- including Patrick Healy of 
Champagne, Susan Feniger and Mary Sue Milliken of City Restaurant and Border 
Grill, Claude Segal of Ma Be, Michel Blanchet of L'Ermitage and Roland Gibert 
of Tulipe -- get together with great California wineries such as Acacia, Stags 
Leap, Vichon and Far Niente to cook up a benefit for the National Kidney 
Foundation. The event is taking place today at the Westwood Marquis from 3 to 6 
p.m. Tickets are $125 each. . . . Roy Yamaguchi, former chef at Los Angeles' Le 
Gourmet and 385 North, and now owner-chef of Roy's restaurant in Honolulu, will 
prepare a multi-course menu featuring Hawaiian products at Champagne in West 
Los Angeles, this Tuesday, May 8. Price of the dinner is $42 to $52, depending 
on main course. . . . The culinary arts department of Glendale Community 
College hosts a fund-raising dinner to raise funds for the completion of its 
new laboratory, May 18, at the school. Hugo Molina, executive chef of Parkway 
Grill, is scheduled to cook a four-course dinner for the event. The price is 
$60 per person, including wine and entertainment. . . . From Spain in West Los 
Angeles now serves three-course dinners featuring the dishes of Spain's Catalan 
region, Monday through Thursday evenings, for $19.95 each. . . . The Seventh 
Street Bistro, downtown, has introduced an "American Bistro" menu at lunchtime 
daily, featuring appetizer, main course, and dessert, plus a half-carafe of 
wine, for $18.50 per person. . . . And Riccardo's Ristorante is new in Culver 
City, serving "gourmet Italian/Continental cuisine."

S.D. WILTS ON A SIZZLING CINCO DE MAYO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON and STEPHEN BRAUN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The high temperature at Lindbergh Field was 81 degrees on Saturday, far below 
the record 96 set in 1953, but elsewhere in San Diego County, Cinco de Mayo 
sizzled. 
</P>
<P>
Santee reported a wilting 105 at 2 p.m., and Camp Pendleton reported a high of 
102. Other highs reported on Saturday included 87 in Vista, 94 in Escondido and 
93 in Alpine. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown San Diego and parts of the coast escaped the heat wave because they 
"probably had a little bit stronger breeze today," said a spokesman for the 
National Weather Service in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
It was also unseasonably hot elsewhere in Southern California. Los Angeles 
reported in at 101 degrees, which easily broke a previous record high of 93 
degrees for the day in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
But an absence of off-shore breezes and a high-pressure system that hung 
immobile over much of California throughout the day also helped temperatures 
rise to 104 in Monrovia, 102 in Woodland Hills, Long Beach, Montebello and 
Riverside, and 101 in Pasadena and San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal freeways and roads turned into blocked arteries, clogged with carloads 
of sunstruck beach-goers. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego City lifeguards performed 28 rescues, an unusually high number for a 
Saturday early in May. An estimated 95,000 San Diegans sought cooler 
temperatures at city beaches, while thousands more gathered at Embarcadero Park 
for an evening fireworks display celebrating Cinco de Mayo. 
</P>
<P>
San Diegans can look for more of the same hot weather this morning and 
afternoon. The forecast calls for highs of between 76 and 84 along the coast, 
92 to 100 inland, 70 to 78 in the mountains and 97 to 105 in the desert. The 
high pressure system causing the heat wave is expected to move back into the 
desert tonight and bring cooler temperatures on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County lifeguards said crowds ranged from 100,000 at Long Beach and 
Hermosa Beach to 90,000 at Zuma. In Orange County, estimates ranged from almost 
90,000 visitors in Newport Beach to 5,000 in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica, where an estimated 150,000 shoreline visitors lounged on the 
sand, even the lifeguards were not immune to traffic woes. 
</P>
<P>
"Our guys have been up to 30 minutes late just trying to find places to park," 
said lifeguard Dan Atkins, 34. 
</P>
<P>
Atkins said the peaceful crowds and mild upper-70s temperatures provided for a 
"perfect beach day" -- marred only by a few minor encounters between lifeguards 
and rowdy visitors over excessive beer drinking. 
</P>
<P>
"So far we haven't had to arrest anybody," Atkins said. "Our concern is that 
they'll go into the water drunk." 
</P>
<P>
Campers took to the roads leading north to mountain resorts. At Crystal Lake in 
the Angeles National Forest, where cars and four-wheel-drive vehicles equipped 
with tents filed in all day long, park naturalist Sharon Seales said the heat 
had provided "the biggest warm weather draw of the year." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's mountain communities also reported delightful weather: It was sunny 
and 75 at Mount Laguna, 78 at Cuyamaca Park. 
</P>
<P>
At the Mariachi Festival in downtown Santa Ana, Louise Diaz, wearing a 
full-length, long-sleeved ruffled dress, tried to find relief by eating a 
Popsicle while she waited to take the stage with the Folklorico La Fonda dance 
troupe. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hot!" she said, belaboring the obvious. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County fire officials declared a "red flag warning" -- one stage 
below the red flag "alerts" issued when fire danger is most extreme. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of rare for this time of year" to issue the warning, Fire Capt. Jim 
Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
Weather forecasters said the 100-degree temperatures were not expected to 
return today to the Los Angeles area. Steve Burback, a meteorologist with 
WeatherData Inc., which supplies forecasts to The Times, said the high-pressure 
system that spanned from San Francisco to Nevada's Great Basin would move 
eastward, leaving a few clouds and highs in the upper 80s and low 90s today. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Phillip Gollner in Chatsworth and Dan Weikel in Costa Mesa 
contributed to this story.

EARNED EVERY CENT, SAYS LAWYER UNDER INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lawyer Peggy Moore, under investigation by the county district attorney's 
office after submitting bills last year for 3,758 hours of her time, said she 
earned every penny of the $150,350 the county paid her in attorneys' fees and 
is "a very good value." 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone looks at the numbers and says (private) attorneys are taking 
advantage of the county. We're not taking advantage of anyone or anything. 
We've got probably the most stressful job in the county for attorneys, and the 
numbers are out of this world, that most of us happen to carry. 
</P>
<P>
"I am working too hard and too many hours," Moore said. "I can't keep it up. 
I'm exhausted. The only entertainment I have in my life is that on Sunday 
mornings I go out and feed my horse carrots. And I've had the horse a lot 
longer than this job. I don't want anybody to think I bought a horse off this 
job." 
</P>
<P>
Moore, 48, a juvenile court specialist, said she has been notified that the 
district attorney is investigating her for purported discrepancies in her 
bills. But she defended her work -- and her bills -- and predicted that she 
will be cleared. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, a private attorney, handles cases that the county public defender's 
office won't take because of a conflict of interest. She earns $40 an hour from 
the county for juvenile court work and spent all of her time in 1989 on 
appointed work, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said the problem seems to be that the overall figure of 3,758 hours is 
high and that her daily bills can appear misleading. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, she said, she may not have been consistent when matching a bill 
for work performed to the day the work actually was done. Perhaps, she said, 
she billed the work, in one lump, to a single day, even if it was done over 
several days. 
</P>
<P>
To Moore, the key is that the work got done, not the form in which it was 
listed on a time sheet. 
</P>
<P>
"One day it turned up I had worked, I believe, 24 hours" according to her time 
sheets, she said. "I said. . . . I did the work, I just billed it when I got 
done reading the stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Her overall annual total equals 72 hours billed a week. 
</P>
<P>
At high-powered civil law firms in San Diego and in other major metropolitan 
areas, where the lawyers often take pride in the frantic pace, it's considered 
a major accomplishment to bill 2,500 hours annually, attorneys at those firms 
said. Moore's total of 3,758 is roughly 50% more than even that. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said that, if the time sheets add up to 3,758 hours, that's what she 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
"It's legitimate, that's all I can tell you," she said. "Absolutely legitimate. 
I don't know one day that goes by that I don't work." 
</P>
<P>
"The hours are reasonable and legitimate because I have to spend so much time 
in court, and I have no control over the time I spend in court. And, after 
court, I have to visit the kids, read the reports and prepare for trials." 
</P>
<P>
She said she carries about 350 cases. She said she believes that number is the 
highest caseload of any attorney at the juvenile court, where all the attorneys 
are overworked because of a dramatic surge in filings largely attributable to 
drug-related cases. 
</P>
<P>
To keep up, she said, she works nights and weekends. 
</P>
<P>
During the week, she's up at 5 a.m. and, after a brief dash through the 
newspaper, begins reading case reports at 6:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Evenings often are reserved for foster-home visits with her clients, Moore 
said. Primarily, she represents children in dependency cases, those in which 
the county is seeking custody of a child it contends has been abused or 
neglected. 
</P>
<P>
The day often doesn't end until 11 p.m., when she stops reading and the phone 
stops ringing. Every one of her clients has her home phone number, she said, 
and they frequently call her at night. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Moore took one week off, in March, for vacation. But she took files 
with her and worked on them, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"My main issue is I carry more minors than all of the public defender attorneys 
over there," she said, referring to the four deputies assigned to dependency 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
"And I do not have the support system from the county that they have. And I do 
not believe it is less expensive for the county to have those public defenders" 
than to pay private lawyers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"For instance, they're getting about $60,000 a year in salary," she said. 
Experienced trial lawyers with the county earn a fixed salary up to $74,048 
annually. "And that's just salary, not the employer's cost of the salary, no 
office cost, no nothing. They don't have to buy (malpractice) insurance, no 
overhead. 
</P>
<P>
"We're dealing with the reality that this county has more and more kids in the 
system, and it's not going to get cheaper -- it's going to get more expensive," 
Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
"And we're dealing with a County Board of Supervisors that think they're from 
the backwoods. They're not looking for quality, they're just looking at the 
dollars. But I don't think they're realistically looking at the dollars."

Mayo festival in Santa Ana's Fiesta Marketplace. Costumed girls from the 
Mariachi Olimpico of Belveden Junior High School in Los Angeles clapped to the 
music of the bands and joined in the singing despite the record heat. Fourth 
Street was partially closed to traffic to allow festival-goers to wander past 
the booths, eat Mexican food or just plain listen to the lively music. LACY

But for the 2,000 sheep that arrived recently to feed on the rolling green 
hills east of San Clemente, it's all just another free lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Bleating as they cascaded down the ramps of 10 triple-decker semi-trucks, the 
sheep landed with gazelle-like bounds and headed for the tall grass and scrub 
brush they will clear to make way for 5,000 new homes. 
</P>
<P>
For the developer, Arvida Co., the arrangement means the free removal of tall 
grass and scrub brush that otherwise would have been graded by machine and 
shipped to a landfill. For the sheep rancher, Pedro Indocochea of Perris, it 
means a way to feed his herd. 
</P>
<P>
"We're putting the vegetation into the tummies of sheep instead of hauling it 
away," said Horst Schor, Arvida vice president. "And there won't be any 
pollutants released into the air. Environmentally, this is a good solution." 
</P>
<P>
Known as voracious eaters that will strip their grazing area of all vegetation, 
the sheep will save Arvida several thousand dollars, said company spokesman 
Kevin Canning. 
</P>
<P>
"They will basically eat about anything," said Dorine Indocochea, who keeps the 
books for her rancher husband. "They're real garbage disposals on legs." 
</P>
<P>
The 2,000-acre site of the Talega Valley housing project lies half in 
unincorporated county territory and half in the city of San Clemente. County 
officials have approved plans for up to 2,700 homes, and the San Clemente 
Planning Commission is considering plans for 2,300 more. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Indocochea said he is happy that the Arvida Co. called him in April to 
propose the idea. 
</P>
<P>
With grazing lands becoming scarce in Southern California, Indocochea said he 
is glad to bear the $12,000 cost of trucking the sheep to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"Land development and environmentalists make it really hard to find anywhere 
for them to feed," he said. "I'm glad we're able to find them a home here." 
</P>
<P>
From Needles to Brawley, the flock has bounced around Southern California in 
search of grazeable land, Indocochea said. 
</P>
<P>
"About the only places left for them to eat now are the farmlands," he said. 
"And (farmers) know it and charge a lot for my sheep to use their lands." 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, cattle from South County's sprawling ranchlands have been used 
to control scrub brush in the area. 
</P>
<P>
But sheep, say Arvida officials, are better natural lawn mowers than cows. 
</P>
<P>
"Cattle leave something like the bottom third of the plant," Canning said. 
"Sheep will get it all, right down to the roots." 
</P>
<P>
The partnership between sheep herder and developer is not unknown in the 
building industry, although Schor said it is the first time the arrangement has 
been tried in Orange County since he helped build the community of Anaheim 
Hills in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"The sheep worked out really well back then," Schor said. "They'll do a great 
job here, too." 
</P>
<P>
The sheep, all 1-year-old female breeders, will live off the land here for at 
least three months. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, it's beautiful here," Dorine Indocochea said. "I don't know how 
long it will last."

EDGEMOOR GERIATRIC HOSPITAL IN SANTEE OVERCOMES ITS GRIM PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SANTEE, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By any standard, 1985 was not a good year for Edgemoor Geriatric Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The aging Santee facility, under-funded and neglected for years by county 
officials, came under the intense scrutiny of the state Health Department's 
licensing and certification team. 
</P>
<P>
State officials delivered a scathing critique of the county-run hospital and 
slapped it with a string of citations for medical improprieties, among them: 
giving penicillin to an allergic patient; roughing up a patient for sleeping 
during a meeting; leaving a paralyzed patient unattended in a bathtub. The 
patient drowned. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital was on the verge of being shut down. 
</P>
<P>
But today, Edgemoor staffers say the haunting memories of those woeful times 
are fading fast. The reason: the arrival of a new administrator and the 
infusion of long-overdue county funds that officials say have turned around the 
323-bed hospital that houses elderly, handicapped and mentally ill patients who 
have nowhere else to turn. 
</P>
<P>
Medical records, once left stacked to gather dust in a corner, are now properly 
filed and kept confidential in accordance with state guidelines. A limited 
hospital menu that at one time soured appetites -- many residents lost weight 
-- now offers a wide selection, with each meal receiving a dietitian's stamp of 
approval. Residents, previously left to wilt in their beds, are now encouraged 
to participate in physical rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the public outcry that followed the release of the 1985 San Diego County 
grand jury report that said it "can find no kind words for the county hierarchy 
which has permitted the unwanted to be swept under the rug of isolation at 
faraway Edgemoor," county officials hired Florence McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
Since McCarthy became Edgemoor's administrator in March, 1986, the hospital has 
consistently received better marks in the state Health Department's annual 
evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
According to state records, Edgemoor received a score of 65 in its January, 
1987, evaluation. The tally, in essence, counts deficiencies in a hospital. The 
higher the number, the worse the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Slightly more than a year later, in February, 1988, Edgemoor scored a 37. And 
in January, 1989, the hospital lowered its score again, to 35. 
</P>
<P>
"The care has been dramatically improved since 1985," said Ernest Trujillo, 
district administrator of the state Health Department's licensing and 
certification division. The licensing division surveys medical facilities and 
evaluates health care practices to ensure compliance with standards set by 
Medi-Cal and Medicare. Edgemoor's deficiencies in the mid-1980s almost caused 
it to lose federal funds, which pay for the bulk of the hospital's operations. 
</P>
<P>
"The county took some necessary measures, and the change in administration has 
allowed Edgemoor to come a long way," Trujillo added. 
</P>
<P>
But maybe not far enough. 
</P>
<P>
Although Edgemoor's medical care is vastly improved, a new county grand jury 
report notes that the physical condition of the aging facility -- some 
buildings were built in 1929 -- is deteriorating "at an alarming rate." 
</P>
<P>
The report states that "tunnels containing steam, hot and cold water and 
hydrant lines to the facility are on the brink of collapse. Sewer lines are in 
disrepair and portions of roads around the facility had to be closed to prevent 
accidents." 
</P>
<P>
If the building continues to deteriorate, hospital and county officials worry 
that Edgemoor may once again be threatened with closure. The county has 
financed some repairs, but officials agree that the only way to address all the 
deficiencies is to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
Last month the San Diego County Board of Supervisors took the first tentative 
steps toward that goal, outlining a general course for the project, which is 
expected to cost $55 million. However, they agreed to wait until October before 
determining whether the county should spend money on geologic and architectural 
consultants. 
</P>
<P>
"The maintenance costs for a facility that is 60 years old are exorbitant," 
said Paul Simms, county deputy director of physical health services. "We're 
talking about replacing entire plumbing systems, electrical systems. We don't 
have running water in the wards. The care rendered by the staff is second to 
none, but the employees are doing that in prehistoric conditions." 
</P>
<P>
Deteriorating physical conditions have already caused one injury. In 1987, a 
boiler room mixing valve that controls the release of hot and cold water 
failed. When a nursing assistant turned on a faucet, hot steam came out, 
scalding the foot and ankle of a patient who was being bathed. The hospital was 
slapped with a major citation -- the only one Edgemoor has received under 
McCarthy's tenure. 
</P>
<P>
Although the county's current fiscal crisis complicates rebuilding plans, 
concerns about other accidents have intensified county efforts to find money 
for a new hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"The prospects of rebuilding Edgemoor look better than they have before," Simms 
said. "Through a change in (hospital classification), it is conceivable that 
additional resources will be made available so that reconstruction could be 
pursued without direct cost to local taxpayers or the county." 
</P>
<P>
For now, however, the county plans to fund construction through a bond 
offering, but the funding scheme also includes an $8-million shortfall that 
must be covered through donations or funds from other government agencies. This 
means the project will need community support to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, Edgemoor was classified as a skilled nursing facility and received 
only $55 per patient per day in Medi-Cal reimbursements. But county officials 
argued that Edgemoor provides more complex care, and it recently earned an 
upgraded designation entitling the county to receive $149 per patient per day. 
</P>
<P>
Although concerned about the hospital's physical condition, McCarthy -- who has 
already overcome many obstacles in steering Edgemoor toward respectability -- 
remains optimistic. For starters, she is eagerly pursuing the idea of a 
fund-raiser to help finance rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
Tackling problems with such a "rolled-up sleeve" approach is typical McCarthy 
management style, but McCarthy acknowledges that, soon after taking over, she 
found herself questioning her decision to accept the job. 
</P>
<P>
"The very first day I walked in, I had a visit from the state surveyor (health 
inspector), who said, 'I'm really sorry to do this to you,' but then proceeded 
to slap me with a $25,000 citation," McCarthy said. The $25,000 citation 
stemmed from a 1986 incident in which an elderly patient died after a nurse 
inserted a feeding tube into her windpipe, instead of its intended target, the 
esophagus. 
</P>
<P>
"Reporters were falling out of trees," McCarthy said of those tumultuous years 
when it seemed as if new problems were being uncovered every day. "As you can 
imagine, that didn't do much for morale." 
</P>
<P>
And boosting morale is where McCarthy may have had the greatest impact. 
</P>
<P>
Although many credit McCarthy with the hospital's turnaround, she attributes 
the improvements to money the county poured into the hospital. Criticized by 
the county grand jury and fearing the loss of federal funds, the county spent 
about $3 million and added 125 new staff positions in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the addition of dietitians, therapists, physical maintenance crews and 
medical records staff helped cure many deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
But county Supervisor George Bailey adds, "Edgemoor was a mess, and we did give 
it extra funds, but what the staff did there . . . well, that kind of 
leadership, morale . . . that's something money can't buy." 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy's supporters say her enthusiasm and energy is contagious. Although 
McCarthy expects a lot from her staff, she hardly seems demanding. Instead, 
supporters say, McCarthy delivers constructive criticism in the form of a 
gentle nudge toward better performance. McCarthy's eagerness to share credit 
for improvements, supporters say, has also infused the staff with pride. 
</P>
<P>
" 'You're doing a great job, but maybe, if you did it this way, you could do it 
even better.' Those are the things I hear (McCarthy) saying (to her staff) 
while I'm visiting," said a San Carlos man who regularly visits his 49-year-old 
brother, suffering from Huntington's disease. He also credits McCarthy with 
implementing an employee-of-the-month program that recognizes outstanding work. 
</P>
<P>
"Things like that may seem like no big deal, but it is," the San Carlos man 
said. "It makes everybody try just a little bit harder. And I assure you, 
that's appreciated." 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy also boosted staff and residents' morale in 1986, when she organized a 
"Senior Prom." Hospital staff, volunteers and community supporters spent months 
planning what has become an annual event -- residents are dressed in donated 
formal attire and treated to a gala event in the hospital's dining 
room-turned-ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
Such events have been instrumental in turning around Edgemoor, which Chuck 
Thurman, the hospital's executive housekeeper, says was "atrocious" when he was 
hired five years ago to work in the medical records department. 
</P>
<P>
"When I accepted the job, I assumed there was a department to join, but, when I 
got here, I discovered that I was the department," Thurman said. 
</P>
<P>
Patients' charts were often incomplete, Thurman said, because the understaffed 
nursing corps "was too busy running around taking care of the residents." 
</P>
<P>
No one had time to properly fill out charts, Thurman said. "You can imagine 
what kind of trouble that got us into, because unless treatment is documented, 
it's assumed that it wasn't done." 
</P>
<P>
Although criticism of medical care was often severe, McCarthy and other staff 
members say the problems were not the result of negligence but of an overworked 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
"You just ran out of steam," said Mary Kendricks, a 25-year Edgemoor veteran, 
referring to the workload during Edgemoor's troubled days. Kendricks, who 
worked as a certified nursing assistant, is now a hospital administrator. In 
the mid-1980s, Kendricks said one nursing assistant was responsible for eight 
bed-ridden residents; now, the staffing ratio is one nursing assistant to four 
or five residents. 
</P>
<P>
But hardship also produced some benefits, such as strengthening the resolve of 
Edgemoor's auxiliary, a band of 135 volunteers who help provide care in a 
number of ways, including wheeling and walking patients, organizing bingo and 
sing-alongs and writing letters for residents. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Field, 75, a volunteer for 29 years, proudly states that no one deserted 
the auxiliary during Edgemoor's darkest days. 
</P>
<P>
"No one left," Field said. "In fact, it glued us together because we felt that 
we were needed more than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to keep Edgemoor going," Field added, "because one day I may need to 
come here."

EARTH DAY PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Earth Day, 1990. San Diego Gas &amp; Electric? General Dynamics? The Republican 
Party? What were they doing there? 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Chase, director of the San Diego Earth Day Coalition, rationalizes that 
people who are part of the problem need to be part of the solution. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, but they do not need (nor deserve) to be part of an environmental 
event. 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E, General Dynamics and the Republican Party are responsible for 
immeasurable harm to our environment. Not only were they allowed to set up 
sizable booths, but they were given prominent exposure, whereas the grass-roots 
environmental groups were positioned close to a mile away from the main event. 
</P>
<P>
Allowing SDG&amp;E, General Dynamics and the Republicans to participate at the 
Earth Day event is like making the racist South African government the guest of 
honor at a "Human Rights" event. 
</P>
<P>
Shame on you, San Diego Earth Day Coalition!

A CLEARER PICTURE OF CIVILIZATION COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On April 22, The Times ran an article on UC San Diego's experimental course, 
Making of the Modern World ("A Big-Picture Review of World Civilization"). The 
article gave a brief synopsis of this revolutionary course that has so enamored 
itself with students that some have decided to immortalize it on, of all 
things, a T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
A picture of the back of that T-shirt was printed with the article and served 
as the source for most of the dates that were used. Unfortunately, due to human 
imperfections on all sides, the first paragraph included a few inaccurate 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, Lucy is a 3.2-million-year-old fossil found in Hadar, Egypt. 
According to the time line on the shirt, this find by Dr. Donald Johanson was 
dated at 4 million years and was located in the Olduvai Gorge. As the designers 
of the shirt, we are very sorry. 
</P>
<P>
The second mistake, made by The Times, was that in 490 B.C. the Persian War was 
being fought not in Troy, Ionia, but at Marathon, Greece. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the intent of the T-shirt being fun, the designers included some fun 
places and dates. One of these entries is Nirvana, India. Nirvana is the 
ultimate goal of Buddhists and is the spiritual state of enlightened salvation 
that Gautama Siddhartha (or Buddha) reached in about 483 B.C. 
</P>
<P>
We would like to thank the Los Angeles Times for an excellent article on a most 
deserving curriculum. And as students who have participated in the course, your 
article touched on the most memorable and important aspects of the class.

PRAISE FOR POWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is in answer to Mary Szterpakiewicz's letter of April 29, "Mobile Home 
Rents." 
</P>
<P>
Our government has subsidized our tobacco industry for years, helped out 
Chrysler, savings &amp; loan companies, the list is endless. 
</P>
<P>
These are all multimillion-dollar establishments. Where is it written that 
government can only help the rich? 
</P>
<P>
Isn't it nice that we in Poway have good people sitting on the council that 
care about their residents and are not afraid to buck the establishment of the 
money hungry. I believe everyone should make a profit, that's what business is 
all about. I also believe that a senior citizen has the right to live in 
dignity and not be forced to move in with their children in their golden years 
which happens all too often. 
</P>
<P>
The statement "Poway may use its power to steal another mobile-home park" is 
way out of line; Mary didn't do her homework! To steal means to take another's 
possession illegally without his/her knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
The out-of-state owners have been offered a more than fair-market value for 
their property. For three months, letters were written by legal counsel and 
many phone calls were made. Not once did we have a response. Doesn't this show 
you what the residents have to deal with? We are a community within ourselves, 
399 coaches, dedicated to helping our neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest we refresh our memories with the opening lines from the Declaration 
of Independence, "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." Is that asking 
so much? Thanks to our City Council we all have something to look forward to. 
I, too, will now be able to live here in my Golden Years.

A PARK IN THEORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have been observing the progress of the San Dieguito River Valley Regional 
Park with great interest and frustration. 
</P>
<P>
This 43-mile, sea-to-mountain park from Del Mar to Julian is exciting and vital 
to preserve some of the stunning natural landscape of lagoon, wetland, valley, 
mountain diversity, which is rapidly disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
I hear about the park repeatedly in the press and from political persons as if 
it were a reality. However, the park exists only as a proposal. 
</P>
<P>
No land has, as yet, been acquired. Until land is in public ownership, it is 
not protected. 
</P>
<P>
The bureaucratic structure for the park is in place. There's the joint powers 
authority with representation from the six communities involved; there is a 
Citizens Advisory Committee. There is even $10 million available for land 
acquisition, but why hasn't it been spent? 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile land costs escalate, wetlands disappear -- 90% of the wetlands in 
California are already gone. 
</P>
<P>
The longer the delay, the higher the cost of acquisition and less will be 
purchased with funds available. 
</P>
<P>
Will this be a paper park or the real thing -- and when?

NEW STATE LAW HAS EDUCATORS FEELING UNEASY; 
</P>
<P>
VIOLENCE: QUESTIONS OF FAIRNESS ARE RAISED LESS THAN 2 MONTHS BEFORE 
LEGISLATION TAKES EFFECT REQUIRING TEACHERS BE GIVEN NAMES OF VIOLENT STUDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN YAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anew state law requiring school officials to warn teachers about students with 
violent behavior is confronting educators with thorny educational issues and 
administrative problems in Los Angeles and some neighboring districts. 
</P>
<P>
Adopted in response to the stabbing of a Sylmar teacher last year, the 
legislation was intended to help by providing teachers with the names of 
students who have physically harmed or attempted to harm another person. But 
less than two months before notification is to begin, the law is raising 
questions about fairness to students and how teachers will respond to the new 
information. 
</P>
<P>
"The Legislature after a while may find this law is too unwieldy and may create 
more problems than it's solving," said Don Bolton, head of student attendance 
and adjustment for the Los Angeles Unified School District. "I'm not going to 
say it's bad legislation yet. No one has really thought through the 
ramifications of this thing." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles school officials also said the district probably will not complete 
the massive amount of work necessary -- compiling court and law enforcement 
records and tracking enrollment of its 610,000 students -- to meet a July 1 
deadline under the law. The statute, however, requires only that districts make 
a "good-faith effort" to have a notification system in place by then. 
</P>
<P>
School districts in Glendale, Burbank, Las Virgenes, Santa Clarita and the 
Antelope Valley say they will have an easier time creating a notification 
system, but have many of the same concerns about its effect. 
</P>
<P>
The law was approved after Cynthia Edwards, a teacher at Olive Vista Junior 
High School, was stabbed March 6, 1989, by a student whom Edwards was going to 
send to the principal for using profanity in class. As Edwards wrote a referral 
slip, the 15-year-old boy plunged a three-inch knife into her shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards said later she was not aware that the boy had been transferred at least 
twice for disciplinary problems. 
</P>
<P>
State law at the time gave school districts the option of notifying teachers 
about Juvenile Court convictions. Los Angeles school officials rarely provided 
the notification, arguing that the need for disclosure was outweighed by a 
desire to protect student confidentiality. The teachers union, United Teachers 
of Los Angeles, has contended that administrators also believed the information 
would prejudice instructors against students. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, administrators are required to notify teachers about 
students in their classes who have been accused or convicted of violent 
behavior -- defined as injuring or attempting to injure another person -- in 
the past three years. The district will use police, court and campus security 
records as resources. 
</P>
<P>
As districts move to comply, educators are unearthing a number of conflicting 
views. In Los Angeles, district officials have been meeting to address those 
issues and hope to finish by summer. 
</P>
<P>
High on the list of concerns is the possibility that students will be 
stigmatized for an act of violence -- which could be as minor as a fistfight -- 
and will suffer in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
"A student could be doomed before he can go to class," Bolton said. "Everybody 
thinks this law deals with hard-core criminals." But it also deals with 
students who commit a single act of violence "in the heat of passion, and it's 
going to follow them for three years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
James Catterall, an expert on dropouts and associate professor at UCLA's 
Graduate School of Education, predicted that "a few teachers and students will 
be protected by the availability of this information and some students may get 
extra help from informed teachers who care." 
</P>
<P>
"But I think it far more likely that students 'labeled' as violent offenders 
will be short-changed because of prejudices," he said. "I favor an environment 
in which optimistic assumptions about students are made. If teachers are warned 
that a student has had trouble, they may assume that it will happen again, the 
youngster may sense this as the school's assumption about him, and he may 
proceed to live up to the expectation." 
</P>
<P>
But other educators argue that knowing students have been in trouble might 
prompt teachers to go out of their way to help them. 
</P>
<P>
Harriet Perl, a retired Los Angeles school counselor for teachers injured by 
students, said accusing instructors of being unable to give students a fair 
education was "downright near libelous." 
</P>
<P>
"Ninety percent of teachers who were hurt by kids think it was their fault," 
Perl said. "Amid their tears, they would say over and over again 'I'm sure 
there was something I could have done that would have prevented this.' " 
</P>
<P>
A related issue is the decision to label a student as "violent." If the law 
required reporting students convicted of violent acts only, the definition 
would be simple. But under the law, district officials are required to judge if 
any incident reported in police, court or campus records they possess is 
violent enough to warrant notification. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's a fight, does that qualify?" Bolton asked. "Kids fight all the 
time," Bolton said. "Knocking you down the stairs -- do you have to see blood, 
broken bones? Does it meet the test of the law?" 
</P>
<P>
Gary Hess, student services director for the Glendale Unified School District, 
said officials are worried about making a premature judgment and ". . . two 
years later there's this big sign on this kid saying he's a violent student and 
that's not true." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles administrators are also debating the amount of detail to release 
about a student's violent behavior. The law gives wide discretion in that area. 
The district is weighing three factors: details wanted by teachers, the effort 
required to dig up the information and fairness to students. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers want specific information to keep false impressions from forming and 
to help them decide how to treat each juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
"If the person is using the gun to steal, to assault another gang member, if 
the gun was used among family members -- all that has different meanings to 
me," said Reseda High School instructor Mark Valenzuela, who said forcing 
teachers to deal with violent students but also limiting the information they 
get is wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"If he held a gun to his mother, he has family problems. He would need loving, 
a non-threatening type of person. If he used a gun in a gang situation, I would 
see that as something that's not too abnormal in terms of gang behavior. If 
they robbed a bank, I would be on guard for myself." 
</P>
<P>
But in many instances, those details are not readily available, Bolton said. 
Unlike police and campus security reports, court conviction notices will not 
have crime details. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles school officials do not know how many incidents they would have to 
deal with. But in the 1988-89 school year, the district suspended 20,419 
students for causing an injury or threatening or attempting to do so. And in 
Los Angeles juvenile courts last year, prosecutors filed 30,000 cases. 
</P>
<P>
Providing teachers with full details about incidents raises other concerns for 
Leo Lowe, assistant superintendent for Las Virgenes Unified School District. 
"Is there no protection for the student? I just shudder to think about the 
concerns of confidentiality. It's awfully hard to prevent people from talking. 
I don't want the youngster to be picked on for any reason." 
</P>
<P>
Other instructors said providing details about student behavior also raises a 
longtime, vital concern: Teachers need training in averting confrontations with 
violent students. Information about a student's past serves little purpose, 
they said, unless teachers know how to respond. 
</P>
<P>
Although the district provides classes on how to identify gang members and drug 
users, district officials said budget constraints have prevented them from 
offering training in dealing with violent students. 
</P>
<P>
Not many teacher training institutions offer such training, either. "Education 
tends to lag far behind in terms of what the needs are," said Ron Stevens, 
executive director of the National School Safety Center, an Encino-based 
organization that works with school districts and law enforcement agencies to 
present training on dealing with violent students. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago deans from the nation's top nine teacher training institutions 
identified managing disruptive youths as one of the major needs in schools, 
Stevens said. He said he knew of only a handful of institutions offering 
courses on dealing with violent students, although the number is growing. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you do when a youngster brings a weapon into your class?" he asked. 
"What do you do when you're confronted with two or three gang members? I don't 
think there are many teachers anywhere trained to handle them." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards said that in the absence of training, she developed her own rules based 
on experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't let students get too close to me, come up to my desk," she said. "It 
really deprived me a lot. The closer you get to a student, the more you can 
help that student and gain their confidence. If I get back to the classroom, 
they would never get close to me." 
</P>
<P>
Another question school districts face is whether instructors -- fearing harm 
to themselves and their charges -- should have the right to refuse to teach 
disruptive students. Some teachers said that transferring disruptive pupils to 
teachers who can handle them would help ensure that all the students 
concentrate on education. 
</P>
<P>
Fran Crystal, a special-education instructor at Marshall High, was mugged at 
knifepoint 20 years ago. Her fears from that experience remain. "I just feel 
personally I can't work with a violent child," she said. "Having been a victim 
of a violent crime, I can't put myself in a fearful situation again." 
</P>
<P>
But Crystal said if forced to accept violent students, she and other teachers 
will try to be fair to them. 
</P>
<P>
Others teachers, however, believe instructors who want to refuse violent 
students should turn to another profession. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles district teachers can now suspend students for a maximum of two 
days or request a transfer. But in both cases, the principal has the last word. 
</P>
<P>
Bolton said refusals will "undoubtedly arise," but he does not believe teachers 
should have the right to turn students away. "We have an obligation to educate 
youngsters until they're declared exempt. Principals are upset because now 
they've got another problem: They've got to go one-on-one with teachers." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the issues involved, the district has the practical problem of 
creating a mechanism for tracking students and their behavior. The difficulty, 
school officials said, is that the district has no central data system to track 
all students and their schools. 
</P>
<P>
"They just have a massive records problem because they have so many kids," said 
Phil Kauble, a consultant with the Los Angeles County Office of Education, 
</P>
<P>
Early this year, after being hampered by lack of money for 10 years, the Board 
of Education allocated $11 million and began setting up the index. 
</P>
<P>
It is not expected to be complete until next year, however, and that poses a 
problem for the district. If officials don't know what schools some students 
attend, some teachers will not be notified. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't have a central index, we would be lucky if 50% of the 
notifications will be made," said Joe Fandey, an administrator with Student 
Attendance and Adjustment. "We will have to work exceedingly hard and have a 
great deal of good luck to meet that July 1 deadline." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles teachers union officials said they are not surprised the district 
sees problems in the law because administrators are more concerned with 
protecting student confidentiality than the safety of teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"The school district is trying to make it sound as complicated as possible with 
the intent of denying as much information to the teachers as possible," union 
President Wayne Johnson said. "I know they never wanted the teachers to have 
that information and a law isn't going to change their position."

TEACHER WHO WAS STABBED FACES A LIFE NOW 'TOTALLY OUT OF WHACK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was Thursday afternoon, and in earlier days Cynthia Edwards would have been 
in school. Instead, she was at home, digging holes in the desert sand to plant 
flowers with names she didn't know but whose bright colors and cheering 
influence she has come to depend on. 
</P>
<P>
Since she was stabbed in the right shoulder by one of her ninth-grade students 
at Olive Vista Junior High School last year, Edwards hasn't returned to 
teaching. For a woman used to taking charge of her life and not prone to tears, 
she said the stabbing has knocked her life "totally out of whack." 
</P>
<P>
"I have always been a person who had direction," said Edwards, 39, from her 
Palmdale home. "I had goals, I knew pretty much how I was going to get there. 
Now I have to wait for the doctors to release me, for the district to find me a 
job." 
</P>
<P>
That stabbing spurred lawmakers last year to approve a law requiring school 
districts to notify teachers of students with violent pasts. Edwards was 
unaware that her young attacker had been transferred twice for disciplinary 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards swears she will never teach junior high again and does not feel ready 
to confront students. 
</P>
<P>
When she thinks of the 15-year-old boy who stabbed her, she said, "I feel like 
taking that kid by the neck and . . . " Her hands seize an imaginary throat and 
she makes a "krrr" sound. 
</P>
<P>
For 13 months, Edwards has been trying to get over the anger and bitterness. 
Living by herself in an isolated Palmdale neighborhood, she often felt alone 
and cried without anyone to comfort her. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards planted red, yellow and purple flowers to brighten her life. When she 
felt herself sinking into a depression, she would go to a Palmdale shopping 
center to people-watch and window shop. Once she bought a vividly colored 
flower-print dress because she reasoned it would lift her spirits, she said. 
</P>
<P>
At other times, Edwards would sit on a white lawn chair in the back patio, 
reading Ebony and Redbook magazines, soaking in the peaceful view of the desert 
and the Saddle Back Butte. Outside, where only the birds and the occasional 
barking of a dog could be heard, the quiet soothed her nerves. And when 
memories ripped the calm, she'd get up and water her young peach tree -- using 
her one good arm. It was one of the few gardening tasks she could accomplish 
after the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, Edwards began taking piano and algebra classes at a local college. 
She drove her "play mothers" -- older women who befriended her at church -- to 
the store or nursing homes for visits. On her own, she learned how to knit and 
crochet, making afghans for her church. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm learning to do a whole lot of things I didn't know how to do before, had 
no idea how to do and didn't care how to do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the past two months, her mood has improved, Edwards said. She now 
thinks about returning to work, perhaps as an instructor in adult education, 
where she wouldn't have to deal with disruptive students. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I have to go to work eventually," she said. "But when and what will I 
be doing? It just leaves you in limbo. I'm impatient to know which way my life 
is going." ELLEN YAN

BERMAN HAD NO EASY JOB TO INCREASE FOREIGN AID; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS: THE PANORAMA CITY REPRESENTATIVE USED HIS POLITICAL CONNECTIONS TO 
GET HIS PRIORITIES INTO THE HOUSE BUDGET PROPOSAL. BUT IT WAS ONLY THE FIRST 
STEP IN A LONG PROCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many members of Congress regard foreign aid as budgetary poison ivy, but Rep. 
Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) is not among them. 
</P>
<P>
Berman has pushed for more foreign aid at a time when many congressmen believe 
that few voters appreciate their tax dollars going abroad, especially with 
domestic needs growing and the United States' international economic position 
slipping. 
</P>
<P>
Berman succeeded in getting more foreign aid in the House budget, passed last 
week, for the next fiscal year than the $16.6 billion the government is 
spending this year. If the allocation survives the budget labyrinth, it will 
reverse a five-year decline in foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
What follows is a look behind the scenes, based on interviews with congressmen 
and House staff members, at how Berman shaped one piece of the elaborate 
$1.2-trillion budget process. His success reflected, in part, the importance of 
personal connections -- particularly to influential fellow Californians -- as 
well as sheer persistence. 
</P>
<P>
"Right from the beginning, he made sure it was his goal" to increase foreign 
aid funding, said Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), a Budget Committee ally. 
"Berman worked his tail off for something he believes in, and he got it done." 
</P>
<P>
The story begins in January, when Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) 
sought to redefine the foreign aid debate by calling for a shift from 
traditional beneficiaries such as Israel, Egypt and Pakistan to emerging 
democracies in Eastern Europe and drug-fighting nations in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
To Berman, the only Democrat on both the House Foreign Affairs and Budget 
committees, those were fighting words. 
</P>
<P>
He agreed that more money was needed for Eastern Europe and Latin America. But, 
appealing to idealism as well as self-interest, Berman argued that the pie 
should be expanded rather than redistributed. 
</P>
<P>
"Foreign aid plays a more important role as we redefine our national security 
needs than military aid," Berman said recently. "It's very important in 
supporting development of democracy and America's economic growth." 
</P>
<P>
Berman cited statistics indicating that $2 out of every $3 in foreign aid comes 
back to the United States in the form of U.S. goods and services that foreign 
countries buy. And he said that continued support is essential for the security 
and stability of traditional beneficiaries, including Israel. Berman is one of 
the Jewish state's leading advocates on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Although Berman's approach was often circuitous, his ultimate target was Rep. 
Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey), the powerful chairman of the House Budget 
Committee, which is charged with crafting a budget proposal to take to the 
House floor. 
</P>
<P>
Panetta must produce a budget that falls within the Gramm-Rudman deficit 
reduction limits and satisfies a majority of Democrats on the committee and, 
later, the full House. To do so, he must balance the conflicting demands of 
individual committee members and interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
Berman went to work in late February. His goal was to build a coalition of key 
colleagues by lobbying them individually as well as exhorting constituent 
groups to put the heat on them. The more allies he lined up, the more clout he 
would have with Panetta. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, Berman was acting on behalf of House Foreign Affairs Committee 
Chairman Dante B. Fascell (D-Fla.), the chief proponent of increased aid. 
Initially, the two paid a visit to House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.). 
</P>
<P>
They knew Foley was sympathetic but wanted to get him involved on their behalf. 
Foley said he would speak to Panetta. 
</P>
<P>
Berman then approached Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley) to enlist the 
support of the Black Caucus for more aid to African nations and the Caribbean, 
both of which have suffered cuts in U.S. aid in recent years. Dellums, just 
back from a trip to Africa, offered to send a letter to Panetta calling for 
more foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
Berman then called Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente), another California 
ally, and Puerto Rico's non-voting Resident Commissioner Jaime B. Fuster (D-San 
Juan), to enlist the help of the Hispanic Caucus. In this instance, Berman 
highlighted the need for more money for Nicaragua and Panama. He felt they 
would be supportive if he needed them. 
</P>
<P>
Next, Berman spoke to Rep. William O. Lipinski (D-Ill.), an advocate for 
Eastern European immigrants, and emphasized the need for more aid for new 
Eastern European democracies. He asked Lipinski to organize other members whose 
districts include large numbers of ethnic minorities from that region. 
</P>
<P>
All along, Berman was approaching Budget Committee members who had previously 
supported foreign aid. He started with Democrats, who hold a 21-14 majority on 
the committee, but he also identified several Republicans likely to be 
sympathetic if needed. 
</P>
<P>
With each, he stressed the regions of interest to them. For instance, he knew 
Rep. Mike Espy (D-Miss.) was keenly supportive of aid to Africa. Rep. Richard 
J. Durbin (D-Ill.), who is of Lithuanian descent, was most concerned about 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"We met endlessly," recalled Michael S. Powell, Berman's legislative assistant 
on the budget. "We met for hours upon hours upon hours." 
</P>
<P>
Berman went to see House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) as well. 
</P>
<P>
Cognizant of Gephardt's acute interest in the United States' ability to compete 
with Japan, Berman stressed that foreign aid for the U.S. Export-Import Bank is 
essential to give U.S. industries an even playing field overseas against 
heavily subsidized Japanese and European companies. In addition, he reminded 
Gephardt that Japan had surpassed the United States as the biggest provider of 
foreign aid as a percentage of gross national product. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the most sweeping imaginable increases in foreign aid would have 
negligible effect on the overall budget deficit," Berman wrote to Gephardt on 
Feb. 27. "Yet modest growth will go far in restoring the leadership role we 
once enjoyed among foreign aid donors." 
</P>
<P>
Gephardt, too, expressed his support. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Berman was in touch with the politically potent 
American-Israel Public Affairs Committee and with Employment Through Exports, a 
business coalition that supports the Export-Import Bank. He encouraged the 
groups to turn up the pressure on Budget Committee members to support increased 
international assistance. 
</P>
<P>
He also spoke to the Sierra Club, a natural ally because the foreign aid budget 
includes family planning funds for Third World countries, one of the 
environmental group's priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Then, with the House coalition and constituent groups in line, Berman went to 
Panetta. 
</P>
<P>
The fellow California Democrats know each other well. Among other things, they 
worked closely on the sweeping 1986 immigration reform bill. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a great amount of trust there," said a senior aide to Panetta. "They 
understand each other and they respect each other. There's not a lot of 
posturing between them." 
</P>
<P>
Berman spoke to Panetta on the phone, on the House floor and in private 
meetings. Fascell joined him for one crucial session in Fascell's office in 
early March. 
</P>
<P>
The three lawmakers failed to reach agreement, but Fascell and Berman let 
Panetta know that his proposed $19.1 billion in spending authority and $16.9 
billion in direct spending for foreign aid would not fly with them. This year's 
figures are $18.4 billion in spending authority and $16.6 billion in direct 
spending, or actual outlays. 
</P>
<P>
Spending authority represents congressional approval for federal agencies to 
enter into spending commitments that could span several years, while outlays 
are sums actually spent in a single budget year. 
</P>
<P>
Berman and Fascell pushed Panetta harder than they had in previous years in 
part because they felt emboldened by the dramatic cuts the Democrats were 
advocating in defense spending. "I understand the problem," Fascell said 
Panetta told them. "We'll do the best we can." 
</P>
<P>
Foreign aid was, of course, just one part of a broad budget consensus Panetta 
was seeking. Without the backing of Democratic members, Panetta's budget 
resolution could face a messy internecine battle in the committee or on the 
House floor. 
</P>
<P>
"Leon is under tremendous pressure in the budget resolution," Berman said. 
"Part of the dynamic that produces an agreement is the notion that the failure 
to produce one will result in a lot of opposition." 
</P>
<P>
Panetta subsequently agreed to modest increases. But Berman was not satisfied. 
He talked to Panetta on the House floor and invited Panetta's two top budget 
staff members and his foreign aid budget analyst to his office for two sessions 
of poring over the foreign aid figures. 
</P>
<P>
Berman was bolstered by the presence of Eric Lief, a 10-year veteran of the 
State Department who was working on Berman's staff as a department fellow. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes the member more effective if he can understand what the technical 
issues are," said a Budget Committee staff member who participated in these 
meetings. Berman "really understood the nitty-gritty of what went into 
Panetta's recommendations. It helped him argue where he thought we were short." 
</P>
<P>
Lief helped Berman understand how money for State Department programs is spent 
in the so-called "out years," or those beyond the next year's budget. This 
proved important in persuading Panetta's staff of the need for increased 
spending authority. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very important because the out years are really a mystery to most 
members," Panetta's aide said. "They chose the right policy for '91 that would 
fit with our out-year path and that was really critical." 
</P>
<P>
Panetta eventually agreed to raise the numbers to $20.3 billion and $17.6 
billion -- or $1.2 billion more in spending authority and $700 million more in 
direct spending than he had originally planned to propose. 
</P>
<P>
Berman's triumph, however, was only the first step in a long process. The House 
budget, which was approved along partisan lines, is merely a Democratic 
blueprint for the congressional committees -- particularly the House 
Appropriations Committee -- that will decide later this year how much actually 
will be spent. Those deliberations will follow negotiations with the Republican 
Bush Administration as well as the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives us a shopping license with Appropriations," said Fascell, who called 
Berman's role indispensable. "And Howard's already hard at work on that."

COLLEGE MARKS ANNIVERSARY WITH MEXICAN FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN O'SHAUGHNESSY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was hot and sticky Saturday at the Cinco de Mayo celebration sponsored by 
the College of the Canyons in Santa Clarita, perfect weather for a nice cold 
drink. 
</P>
<P>
But Jered Standing was having trouble with the soda his mother had just bought 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I can drink with this thing," complained the 10-year-old boy, 
referring to the still-wet plaster-of-Paris Mexican mask that a folk artist had 
just created for him. 
</P>
<P>
"Aaaah!" Standing said when artist Lonnie Miramontes gently pulled it off his 
face. 
</P>
<P>
All day long, children lined up to have their faces wrapped in gooey gauze. 
</P>
<P>
And when the masks dried, they sat under a shade tree to paint them with 
brilliant colors. 
</P>
<P>
Miramontes said he hoped to share a little of Mexican culture with the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, that was one of the principal aims of the organizers of the Cinco de 
Mayo festival, which was held to celebrate the college's 20th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really making an effort to bring these two cultures together," said Sue 
Bozman, the college's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Another purpose was to encourage Latinos to become familiar with the college. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're really trying to do is outreach for the Mexican community," Bozman 
said. "To let them know this is a place where they are welcome, where they can 
have fun and learn." 
</P>
<P>
Organizers estimated that 1,000 people would attend the daylong celebration 
that included plenty of music, salsa, folk dancing and dramatic skits. 
</P>
<P>
Among the guests were 200 migrant farm worker families. 
</P>
<P>
It was clearly a day for children, who scampered from one event to another. 
</P>
<P>
They made miniature pinatas out of paper bags and crepe paper, and shaped bowls 
and vases from big mounds of clay. 
</P>
<P>
And once the full-size pinatas appeared, the children all seemed to gravitate 
toward the grassy clearing where the real action was.

When a boy bashed the head off a blue Cookie Monster pinata, bedlam broke out 
as children scoured the grass for candy.

A new "musical sculpture," made by the college's welding students, was a big 
hit with the kids.

When a child hit the large metal sculpture with a rod, it sounded like the

Some adults preferred to escape the heat by slipping into an air-conditioned

Still others crowded around the messy soda booth where frantic volunteers were 
unable to keep up with the demand.

COUNCIL, EDUCATORS REMAIN AT ODDS ON LANCASTER OVERCROWDING ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A months-long effort aimed at forcing developers and future residents to pay 
for relieving school crowding in Lancaster has failed to produce a consensus, 
leaving city and school district officials trading blame for the stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
Beset by funding and classroom shortages, the Lancaster School District wants 
the city to force developers who need certain city approvals to agree to 
special long-term tax assessments on their land. Most of the actual taxes would 
be paid by future owners. 
</P>
<P>
But a special committee of developer, city and school district representatives 
that was formed in February to work out an agreement returned last week with 
none. That left the issue in limbo. The Lancaster City Council is scheduled to 
consider the matter Monday. 
</P>
<P>
School officials returned from the group's most recent meeting last Monday and 
accused the city and developers of deliberately stalling the process. "They're 
playing a game with us . . . We didn't realize we were being set up," Lancaster 
school board President Frank Astourian said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials, however, blamed the school district for not providing enough 
information about needed school projects and their costs. "The city wants to 
cooperate, but every time we ask for information from the district, we don't 
get answers," Lancaster City Atty. Dave McEwen said. 
</P>
<P>
It is the latest in a series of flare-ups between the city and the school 
district over the school funding issue. 
</P>
<P>
A similar debate raged several months ago in the Santa Clarita Valley, and 
public officials and developers throughout the state are arguing over who 
should pay for schools. 
</P>
<P>
A $47-million schools bond measure failed to win approval from Lancaster area 
voters in the April election. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the City Council is scheduled to discuss whether to concur with the 
school district's November declaration that it is overcrowded and needs relief 
from the city. Under state law, the council could then delay or halt approval 
of certain development projects. 
</P>
<P>
The more likely application of the law, though, would be to give the city and 
school district leverage in forcing developers to enroll their land in 
so-called Mello-Roos assessment districts. School officials said the resulting 
tax revenue could help bail out the district. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, developers can agree to have their projects assessed and pay 
some initial taxes. But it would be the ultimate owners of the developed 
property, whether houses or businesses, who would pay the resulting annual tax 
levy for 20 years or longer to support new schools. 
</P>
<P>
McEwen, citing the overcrowding issue, said he believes the city could refuse 
to grant zoning changes to developers unless they agree to the special taxes. 
He said the overcrowding declaration proposed by the school district might 
bolster the city's case. 
</P>
<P>
But whether the City Council is inclined to do that remains a question. Mayor 
Bill Pursley, a city member of the schools committee, did not return calls 
Friday. Neither did the two developer representatives, former Councilman Lou 
Bozigian and former City Manager Jim Gilley. 
</P>
<P>
All three work for Mid-Valley Real Estate, a prominent Antelope Valley realty 
firm. School district officials said the building industry has been pushing 
instead for a speeded-up conversion to year-round schedules to increase 
capacity at the district's 14 existing schools. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the board voted to adopt its first year-round schedules at two 
district schools beginning in August. At the same meeting, interim 
Superintendent Ed Goodwin recommended that two more schools start on year-round 
schedules a year later. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Lancaster City Council will discuss whether to concur with the 
Lancaster school district's declaration that it is overcrowded with students 
and needs relief from the city. 
</P>
<P>
If the council agrees, that could give the city and school district leverage in 
forcing developers to enroll their land in special tax assessment districts to 
help bail out the district. The city could do that by refusing to grant crucial 
zone changes to developers unless they agree to the special taxes. Whether the 
council is inclined to do that remains a question.

NO ROTC DISCRIMINATION AT CSUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is a tragic testimonial to the Los Angeles Times when it is reduced to 
publishing out-and-out lies. 
</P>
<P>
The April 21 News Challenge said student activists blocked the front doors to 
Cal State Northridge's administration building during a protest over 
"discrimination against homosexuals by the ROTC." 
</P>
<P>
Any student may enroll and take courses in ROTC. There is no discrimination. 
The discrimination is by the Lesbian and Gay Alliance, which wants to prevent 
others who may desire to do so from having the opportunity to take such 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
Just as the taxes that support the university come from all elements of our 
society, so too should all elements of our society be allowed to pursue the 
course of instruction that contributes to their individually elected and 
selected needs and desires. No one is protesting the protesters right to such 
opportunity.

HIGH AIRLINE FARES OUT OF JOHN WAYNE ARE UNJUSTIFIED

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I couldn't believe my ears. American and United Airlines want $1,159 to fly 
from Orange County to Chicago and back midweek. 
</P>
<P>
Mind you, this is for a trip in August. In March, they charged $972 to fly 
round-trip midweek from Orange County to Dallas-Ft. Worth. 
</P>
<P>
The same trip to Chicago from Los Angeles instead of (John Wayne Airport) 
Orange County comes in at $786. Will someone from either American or United 
Airlines tell me how you can possibly justify these fares? 
</P>
<P>
For those of us who still think competition is a good thing, apparently it does 
not exist out of Orange County. Duke, where are you when we need you?

PLAN TO SAVE WATER SHOULDN'T BE USED TO DENY PEOPLE HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was interesting to read Phillip Weissburg's letter (Letters to the Times, 
April 29) in which he blames the current water shortage on the fact that Orange 
County Supervisors have not made any attempt to slow the growth in South 
County. The writer then urges Supervisor Thomas F. Riley to "offer a law to 
provide for an immediate building moratorium as they have in Santa Barbara 
County, until the problem passes." 
</P>
<P>
Weissburg conveniently fails to mention the severe water problem, far worse 
than anything we have in Orange County, that Santa Barbara is suffering from 
now. Weissburg apparently does not know or chooses to ignore the fact that 
Santa Barbara has tried to restrict growth by limiting water supply. Sadly, 
this policy of limiting water supply has resulted in the crisis that Santa 
Barbara is now facing. 
</P>
<P>
It would be very instructive to Weissburg if he were to read the article in the 
Opinion Section of the Times by William Kahrl, entitled "Water, Water 
Everywhere . . . (April 29)" in which Kahrl points out that only about 4% of 
all water deliveries are being used in homes. 
</P>
<P>
There are many ways in which water can be conserved but using it as a weapon to 
deprive Californians of home ownership should not be one of them.

SHERIFF'S SPENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's about time that the Shirley Grindles of the world stop their whining 
("Gadfly Buzzing Gates Over His Political Funds," April 22). These people are 
just political rabble-rousers with no understanding of what it takes to get 
things done in Orange County, and I'm tired of reading about them. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Brad Gates spends lots of money on political meetings. But look what he's 
gotten out of them: support is growing for a new jail, his advisory council has 
donated almost a million dollars worth of new equipment and facilities to law 
enforcement, and George Bush himself came to Orange County to get our sheriff's 
advice on how to fight the drug war. And yes, Gates' wife is a hard-working 
businesswoman, and they do have rich friends. So what? His friends are the 
biggest employers in the county. We need the sheriff to enlist their support. 
</P>
<P>
And yes, Brad Gates spent $9,000 over three or four years on his car phone. 
That's next to nothing for a corporate CEO, many of whom manage companies that 
are smaller than the Sheriff's Department. What is he supposed to do? Waste the 
time he spends in his car? I've donated to Brad Gates for years; and as far as 
I'm concerned, I would much rather have him making calls to win support for a 
new jail, the narcotics training center at Rancho del Rio and other law 
enforcement projects.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is intriguing that the Sheridans plan to continue representing Irvine city 
employees in real estate transactions when it was not too long ago that they 
both admitted to me, when I was a realtor also with Remax, that the reason that 
they had worked in an extremely well known real estate firm in Newport Beach 
was because of the possibility of conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
It is also very interesting to note that the Sheridans admit to being "commonly 
the listing agents for property sales in these transactions, which entitled 
them to a small percentage of the sale price." 
</P>
<P>
Most real estate companies share the brokerage fee 50-50, unless the listing 
agency agrees to take a lower amount than is provided to the cooperating 
agency. Let us not open the books and expose to the public all the tricks of 
the trade in transferring real estate, but let us examine in great detail the 
potential of the conflicts of interest. Herein lies the rub!

UPGRADING PIER AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article (April 30) on Huntington Beach's Pierside Village project leaves 
the impression that those of us who oppose the project want the area left in 
its present state. 
</P>
<P>
That is not true; it is obviously a blighted area and needs to be upgraded. 
</P>
<P>
The disagreement is over what should be built on the site. The Downtown 
Specific Plan passed by the Planning Commission and City Council specified that 
commercial uses in this area are to be beach-related. Businesses that can be 
accessed by beach-goers in bathing suits and sandy feet, and that would not 
diminish views along Pacific Coast Highway would surely be supported by a 
majority of area residents.

SATISFYING HIGHER EXPECTATIONS FOR NEW HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE McCORMICK, Steve McCormick is an associate project director at 
Richardson Nagy Martin, a Newport Beach-based architectural and planning firm. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Orange County's population increases and housing prices soar ever upward, 
developers are building on more and more hillsides in order to meet the huge 
demand for housing. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents are justifiably concerned about hillside development. They want 
to protect the value of existing properties and preserve many remaining 
hillsides as open space and visual relief in our increasingly congested region. 
But the public also recognizes that Orange County is growing rapidly, and that 
local residents -- now and in the future -- deserve a full range of housing 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
How can Orange County residents, city planners, public officials and developers 
formulate hillside-growth plans that satisfy all these valid concerns? With 
hillside projects in several communities now in various stages of planning, new 
attention is being focused on the challenge of finding the best way to put 
homes on hillsides without suffering the visual consequences that plagued past 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, hillside development is not inherently bad. Some of California's 
most charming places are characterized by hillside development, such as Laguna 
Beach, Beachwood Canyon beneath the HOLLYWOOD sign, and Russian Hill and 
Telegraph Hill in San Francisco. Beyond California, consider the Italian and 
Greek hill towns, which are some of the most beautiful spots in the world. 
</P>
<P>
What qualities make these high-density hillside communities so appealing? More 
to the point, how can these communities provide lessons for hillside 
development in today's Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
First of all, many of these successful hillside communities have developed in a 
sporadic manner over several decades, if not several centuries. Houses were 
usually built one by one. Each building respected the existing site, and so the 
combined visual effect did not significantly alter the overall hillside. 
</P>
<P>
Also, houses were built in close proximity to each other to minimize the cost 
of roads and connections to existing utilities. Therefore, development occurred 
in random clusters, leaving difficult-to-access areas as open space. The result 
is a pleasing combination of open space intermingled with developed areas. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor is that roads were designed to adapt to the hillside terrain, 
not the other way around. The effect of these narrow, twisting roads was 
minimal impact to the natural hillside landforms. Today's road standards are 
usually over-designed, making it difficult to follow the natural terrain. 
</P>
<P>
And landscaping is essential for a hillside community. Some of the most 
attractive locales have improved over time due to the growth of plantings that 
soften the appearance of buildings and help blend development into the 
environment. In many respects, a hillside community is like good wine: it 
improves with age. 
</P>
<P>
When these communities are viewed from a distance, homes appear to be scattered 
in a random fashion, rather than arranged in rows. Street patterns are nearly 
indistinguishable. Development follows the overall hillside landform and blends 
with surrounding open spaces. The hillsides are preserved -- yet local 
residents' housing needs are satisfied as well. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, new Orange County hillside communities will not be developed house 
by house over several decades, and excessively narrow and twisting roads are 
often impractical. Yet, new communities can still offer the same aesthetic and 
environmental pleasures as the older ones, if we create intelligent community 
planning and housing design standards that are specifically tailored to the 
unique hillside requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Before Orange County residents and public officials can devise improved 
planning standards for hillside communities, however, we must discard the 
unreasonable zoning dictum -- "the higher the hillside, the lower the density" 
-- and then review past disappointments that are the obvious focus of today's 
hillside development opponents. 
</P>
<P>
What went wrong in the planning and subsequent construction of these Orange 
County communities that are so easily criticized? 
</P>
<P>
The real estate developers and their planners disregarded the natural hillside 
landforms by using flatland building techniques. In their eagerness to maximize 
flat, buildable land, developers bulldozed hillsides into large, flat pads 
terraced into the land in long, straight lines. As a result, the houses and 
roads march up and down the hillsides, creating a regimented and unnatural 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of citing flawed designs as reasons to prevent future hillside 
development, let's use the lessons of Laguna Beach and Santa Barbara to 
encourage sensitive growth in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
In planning new communities, developers must learn how to "sculpt" the land. In 
other words, they should blend homes into the hillsides, leaving naturally 
steep areas as open space and blending better into the existing native 
vegetation. They should utilize "hillside adaptive architecture" -- homes that 
follow the natural slope and complement existing natural colors. Importantly, 
they should landscape the hillside development areas far more intensively than 
they do the flatlands so that houses and roads will blend into the terrain. 
</P>
<P>
Not only will these new hillside communities become desirable additions to 
Orange County from an aesthetic and environmental perspective, they will also 
offer other advantages: protection of existing hillsides, less disturbance of 
native vegetation and development plans that will be accepted more quickly by 
government agencies and increasingly vocal community residents. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, well-planned hillside communities will create delightful living 
environments that will mature over time and offer a greater range of housing 
choices for everyone. Isn't that what most Orange County residents want?

IT'S A SHEEP WAY TO CLEAR THE LAND IN SAN CLEMENTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glad to see that a San Clemente developer is now using sheep to clear the grass 
off the hillsides. What a way to make the environmentalists happy, create a 
picture post card scene for the local Chamber of Commerce and save some dollars 
all at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Or so I thought until I read an article in a Seattle newspaper about sheep 
grazing in New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
Seems that in this country of 3.5 million people and 71 million sheep, its 
scientists have discovered that the digestive systems of the sheep are such 
that the animals emit an oxide that is detrimental to the ozone layer. In fact, 
they view it as being so serious that they are actually trying to develop a 
pill to cut down or eliminate this gas. No fooling -- that is what the 
newspaper in Seattle said! 
</P>
<P>
While the New Zealanders ponder this question, I still encourage the developer 
in San Clemente to continue grazing his sheep. And I doubt that their presence 
will greatly adversely affect the ozone layer over Orange County.

FOOTHILL OFFICIALS DIDN'T GET MESSAGE OF STUDENT SIT-IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was with great sadness that I read of the teachers' boycott of the annual 
open house at Foothill High School in Tustin (April 27) -- another myth totally 
put to rest. 
</P>
<P>
The myth: Most teachers have an inborn "calling" and sense of obligation to 
their profession and to their students. 
</P>
<P>
The hope: That teachers are somehow more than just human, that ranks them right 
up there with other "care-givers" like doctors, nurses and ministers. As an 
adult, it is necessary to let go of some of the hopes and dreams of childhood. 
Facing reality is important, but some hopes and dreams are harder to let go of 
than others, and this one (that of the superhumans who become teachers) has 
been a particularly difficult one for me. And it has been slowly but surely 
eroded by the constant emphasis on salary and other contractual issues, the 
strikes, walkouts and boycotts that dramatically and tragically affect the 
nation's children. I guess one could argue that the students are experiencing 
bargaining as it is needed. I, on the other hand, wonder what the students must 
think of their importance to our nation when they are often considered at the 
bottom of the list of concerns by the teachers' negotiating groups. 
</P>
<P>
I agree that teachers should be paid salaries and granted a status far above 
what some currently enjoy. I also believe, however, that teachers themselves 
have eroded their place of honor -- and the people of my generation (parents of 
school-age children) feel a greater loss than many of the teachers at the 
attitude that they themselves have created.

THESE 3 IMMIGRANTS CAN STOP LOOKING OVER THEIR SHOULDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On different nights, in different years, Alicia Lopez, Pedro Zamora and Jose 
Ramos each made their way on foot over scrubby low hills at the place where 
Tijuana turns into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
At the appointed hour, they dodged the spotlight of U.S. immigration agents, 
running as far into the folds of America as they could in one night. 
</P>
<P>
Many others were caught and returned; these three made it. 
</P>
<P>
But in all the years they lived in this country, during every day that they 
toiled at a job, they never stopped looking over their shoulders. After all, 
they were illegal aliens -- the very phrase conjuring up images of beings from 
another planet, people who do not belong. 
</P>
<P>
And visits back to their homeland were filled with the constant anxiety that 
they would be caught crossing the tightly guarded but porous border. 
</P>
<P>
Now, all that has changed. 
</P>
<P>
Last year at Christmastime, Lopez returned to Mexico to visit her parents, 
sitting comfortably in the first airplane she had ever boarded. Below, she 
could almost see the spot where 13 years ago she had crossed the invisible line 
into America. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos and his wife drove into Mexico, more afraid this time of the Tijuana cops 
who stopped them and hit them up for bribes than they were of U.S. Border 
Patrol agents on their return to the States. 
</P>
<P>
Zamora walked across the border at Tijuana and, on his return, patiently waited 
in line as immigration agents questioned those in front of him. This time, he 
felt emboldened. In the wallet in his back pocket, he carried a small document 
saying that he is a legal resident of the United States of America. 
</P>
<P>
"Amnesty," says Sister Kristen Schlichte, executive director of Catholic 
Charities, "has made it possible for immigrants to walk with their heads held 
high." 
</P>
<P>
The transition from outsider to a full-fledged member of American society will 
be complicated for most newly legalized immigrants. Lopez, Zamora and Ramos, 
who have never met, are a testament to that. Their lives in this country began 
the same and all have gone through the amnesty maze, but from that point, their 
stories diverge. 
</P>
<P>
It's 10:35 a.m. and Zamora is ready to give up his wait for a day's work. 
</P>
<P>
Since before dawn, he has stood at the corner of Placentia Avenue and 18th 
Street in Costa Mesa, half asleep but full of hope that today there would be a 
job for him. 
</P>
<P>
About 70 other men wait with him, almost all of them immigrants, their hopes 
rising every time a truck or a car pulls up carrying an American who looks as 
if he might need a dayworker. But only 16 have been hired today. 
</P>
<P>
This is the Costa Mesa Job Center, a city-sanctioned operation where employers 
are matched with men looking for daywork -- unskilled work that mostly only 
immigrants will take because it often pays little more than minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
The men who apply for work here must show proof of residency. It is practically 
the bottom of the economic rung for immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Two blocks down the street, in front of a Winchell's Donuts, clusters of men 
stand around with their hands in their pockets to protect them from the morning 
chill. When a car pulls up, they mob the driver to ask if he has work. 
</P>
<P>
The men in front of Winchell's are mostly illegal aliens. This is the very 
bottom rung. 
</P>
<P>
At both corners, the workers are mostly unskilled, speak little English and are 
willing to negotiate with an employer for a day's wages. 
</P>
<P>
"But if you get a job at this center, chances are you will be better paid 
because we have our documents," Zamora said. "The employers know that, so they 
have to pay you at least minimum wage." 
</P>
<P>
That, to Zamora, sums up the difference between his life before and after 
amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, the men are hired for two-hour moving jobs. If they are lucky, a 
construction supervisor who hires them to break up concrete for a day will like 
the way they work and keep them on for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But work is scarce in the winter. 
</P>
<P>
At least Zamora does not have a family to support, like many of the men here. 
But it is almost the end of the month, and his portion of the $900-a-month rent 
for the one-bedroom apartment he shares with six other men is almost due. 
</P>
<P>
At 23, Zamora has seen more of the Pacific Coast than many young men born here. 
He came to California in 1985 from his hometown outside Mazatlan. He has 
traveled to work in the pine forests near Seattle, the apple orchards in 
Oregon, and other farm work in Arizona, Bakersfield and fields near Sacramento 
and Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
Zamora's fortunes have depended on a network of friends, relatives and 
acquaintances who pass on tips of job opportunities that sometimes don't come 
through. He has learned to maneuver his way from city to city, without much 
English and, until recently, without legal working papers. 
</P>
<P>
In November of 1988, Zamora was granted legal residency under the Special 
Agricultural Workers program, a provision of the amnesty law that legalizes 
immigrants who can prove that they had worked in the fields the preceding 90 
days. Officials of the Immigration and Naturalization Service say that almost 
half of California's amnesty applicants qualified under the agricultural 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Zamora came to Costa Mesa to look for "city work," as he calls it, because 
friends had told him that there is money to be made in Orange County's 
construction trades. But besides working at a condominium construction project 
for a few weeks in December, Zamora has found little work. 
</P>
<P>
He constantly thinks ahead to his next chance for a job. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'll go to Bakersfield tomorrow to look for work in the fields again 
-- unless, of course, I find a girl to fall in love with here," he says, 
grinning. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a grand plan behind the wanderlust existence. 
</P>
<P>
With the money that he has sent back to Mexico, he has built himself a house, 
not far from the home of his parents, who live just outside of Mazatlan. 
</P>
<P>
"I built it for when I marry, so that I can have a place to take my bride," he 
says, noting that he doesn't have a girlfriend and plans to wait until he is 28 
to marry. 
</P>
<P>
As the long wait for jobs continues at the center, a teacher arrives to begin 
the twice-a-week English language classes that she conducts in the old filling 
station. 
</P>
<P>
"What is this?" the teacher asks, holding up a picture. About 40 men answer in 
unison, "This is a wrench." 
</P>
<P>
Zamora is restless as he sits on the couch, grinning self-consciously at the 
lessons. He recites some of the phrases but then decides to leave. 
</P>
<P>
He did not finish high school in Mexico, and he says he would like to learn 
English here, but work is his priority. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I need to learn it, but I will learn later," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Another day, Zamora sits in the living room of his small apartment. The door is 
seldom locked, and no one seems to knock. 
</P>
<P>
Because the men who live here don't have a telephone, anyone looking for them 
has to drop by. It's not a problem. In this small apartment complex on 
Placentia Avenue, almost everyone knows everyone else, and many of the tenants 
are from the same towns in Mexico. Four of Zamora's roommates are here legally; 
the two others are not. 
</P>
<P>
When Zamora was 19, and had been here for a year already, he went to Sacramento 
with a friend who said he knew of a job for both of them. After two days, the 
job did not come through, so Zamora and his friend parted company. 
</P>
<P>
Zamora spent the next three days in downtown Sacramento, trying to call people 
he knew in Bakersfield and in Washington state, to ask that they send him 
money. But no one ever did. 
</P>
<P>
He spent his time -- and the little money he had -- hanging around pool halls, 
bars or the bus station. He learned by asking around what restaurants or coffee 
shops stayed open 24 hours, because he didn't want to spend money on a hotel. 
Most of the time, he stayed drunk. 
</P>
<P>
He started panhandling, and when he collected about $40, he took a bus to Yuma. 
</P>
<P>
"From that time on, I have worked hard and I have never gotten into any 
trouble," he says. "No matter how hungry I am now, it doesn't even occur to me 
to steal when I go into a store. I might ask a friend for a dollar if I am 
hungry, but I would never again ask a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
"Because five years from now, if you sit down and think about how much you've 
earned, and you find that you don't have a penny to your name, it's your own 
fault if you drank it away," he said. "Well, I decided I would rather send my 
money to Mexico, to do something with it there, than to lose it in bars." 
</P>
<P>
at the end of January, Zamora decided he could not afford to pay another 
month's rent at the Placentia Avenue apartment because he was getting work so 
infrequently at the job center. So on the first day of February, he hopped on a 
Greyhound bus at the Santa Ana bus station and headed for Bakersfield, where he 
planned to try his luck in the farm fields again. 
</P>
<P>
Mornings, Ramos attends English-language classes until noon. Then, as soon as 
the teacher dismisses her students, he hops in his 1978 Chevrolet Monte Carlo, 
hurries down Ball Avenue in Anaheim to his home five minutes away, and gulps 
down whatever lunch his wife has prepared. As Esperanza sets the table, Ramos 
tosses his 6-month-old daughter, Daisy, into the air. 
</P>
<P>
Daisy squeals, but the father-daughter "quality time" seldom lasts more than a 
few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos has to be at work six days a week at 12:30 p.m. and doesn't get off until 
11:30 at night. If he doesn't play with the baby at noon, chances are he won't 
see her again until the next day. 
</P>
<P>
It is a hectic routine, but the only way for his family to get ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to learn English and then go on and try to get a career," he 
says. "I don't think you can't do it if you really put your mind to it." 
</P>
<P>
Ramos, 25, is from the tiny village of Atemajac de Brizada in the state of 
Jalisco, the fourth of 11 children born to sharecroppers. He never finished 
high school and knew only farm work when he sneaked over the border in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza Ramos, the fifth of 12 children, emigrated from Sahuayo, Michoacan, 
in 1981 but had attended secretarial school there. 
</P>
<P>
The two met in Anaheim more than three years ago while working at the 
fruit-packing plant where Ramos still drives a forklift. Esperanza used to wrap 
cellophane around the fruit, but she quit last year just before she had Daisy. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, they remember hearing about amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, though, we didn't pay much attention to it," Ramos says, "because, 
well, you don't know who to trust." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, they paid a lawyer $200 to submit their first application, a cost that 
many legal-rights experts say is unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
But they are proud that they will soon become legal residents, although the 
changes in their lives are subtle. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos continues to take classes at Trident Adult Center, even though he long 
ago completed the 40 hours required to qualify for legal residency. 
</P>
<P>
But he still has the same job, working for just above minimum wage with no 
medical insurance or other benefits. They rent a comfortable, three-bedroom 
house in Anaheim for $1,100 a month, which they share with six other family 
members. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to save enough money to buy a house," he says, "but it is very 
expensive." 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza has to think hard to recall what it was that she first knew about 
America, because she has been hearing of it all her life. 
</P>
<P>
"From the time I was a little girl, I wanted to come here," she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
They consider whether they will apply for citizenship, an option they have once 
they become permanent legal residents. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I have to, because of my daughter," Ramos says, sighing. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it here because of the education the children can receive. I want the 
best for Daisy. As one who did not have much in life, you try to give your 
children everything. You suffer much without an education." 
</P>
<P>
They realize that if their daughter grows up here, she could lose much of what 
makes them Mexican -- observing the traditional religious and national holidays 
that are celebrated with great fanfare in their hometowns, or valuing the 
tradition of strong ties with her extended family. Or worse -- not being fluent 
in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
"One never knows how they will turn out," he says. "But I want my daughter to 
speak English as well as Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
For them, the world in Orange County begins to look different. They do not have 
to be afraid all the time. 
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, the INS raided the fruit-packing plant where Ramos works. 
Three years ago, they would have fled as soon as they saw the green uniforms of 
the INS agents. But this time, most of the workers did not run away, and the 
agents found only three who had no documents. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought to myself, 'Well, let them come, we are no longer afraid,' " Ramos 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez never intended to stay long. 
</P>
<P>
But in the 12 years since she came to this country from the Mexican state of 
Nayarit -- because doctors told her that it was the only way to save her infant 
son who suffered from asthma -- the roots she has set down have grown deep. 
</P>
<P>
Her three oldest children, who are in step with American culture and are as 
fluent in English as they are in their mother's tongue, are about to graduate 
from high school. Another daughter was born here. An adopted daughter who has 
polio is receiving medical care that she could not receive in Mexico. And last 
year, as soon as she and her husband received their temporary amnesty papers, 
they looked for a house to buy. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Lopez's family moved into their own three-bedroom home in Santa 
Ana, the culmination of the immigrant's dream. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez works seven days a week as a cook in a chuckwagon that moves from job 
site to job site, at factories and car washes. She starts at 4 a.m., and a bus 
delivers her a block from her house at about 3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
She has been following this routine for years. 
</P>
<P>
"My daughter, Elizabeth, says they never saw me when they were growing up," she 
says one day after work. "She combed her own hair when she was getting ready 
for school in the mornings, and they made their own breakfasts. My youngest son 
used to walk himself to kindergarten." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez is proud of her children. The three oldest are considering attending 
college. Both of the sons, Carlos, 17, and Porfirio Jr., 15, play football for 
Valley High School. On Saturdays, Carlos works at the Orange Coast College swap 
meet, and Elizabeth, 16, worked in the men's alterations department at 
Nordstrom last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez (who uses her father's last name, as is custom for married Mexican women) 
and her husband, Porfirio Arrellano, a carpenter, pay $1,500 a month on their 
mortgage, and seven other relatives who live with them contribute extra income. 
Their budget does not allow much else. 
</P>
<P>
"My children tell me, 'Don't work so hard. We will help you,' " she says. "But 
I tell them, 'If you work more, you will no longer be interested in school.' " 
</P>
<P>
But all in all, it's a far cry from Tepic, Nayarit. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Arrellano had been making the long trek into California to work in 
the fields and earn money to support his family. 
</P>
<P>
"He would go to Indio or San Juan Capistrano, but only for about three months 
at a time," Lopez says. "Whenever the migra would catch him, he would return to 
Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
She and her small children used to sell vegetables in their small, rural 
hometown. "It was a very different life for us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the men in her town migrated seasonally like her husband. Lopez's 
father also had been coming here since he was a young man. When doctors told 
her that Porfirio Jr.'s asthma was getting worse, her father offered to 
accompany them to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The first few years were difficult. Porfirio Jr.'s medical bills came to $1,000 
during the first few weeks of treatment. The Arrellanos were astounded that the 
treatment could cost so much and they eventually applied for public assistance 
to pay some of the medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
Because they had been living here steadily for years, working hard and staying 
out of trouble, they were ideal amnesty applicants. Porfirio had worked for the 
same shutter company for 13 years and had pay stubs to prove it. Her children 
had all been attending school regularly in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the only one who could not prove it," Lopez says. The chuckwagon company 
had been paying her in cash -- and still does -- so she had nothing to document 
her life here. Finally, the schools agreed to write a letter on her behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Their house is the only part of the dream that has soured. It seems to be full 
of problems. 
</P>
<P>
Pipes in one bathroom broke, flooding a bedroom and ruining the carpet. Gas 
vents were roofed over. When they moved in, the seller's real estate agent did 
not even provide them with keys to the house, so Porfirio Sr. broke in through 
a back door and had to change the locks. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Lopez is proud of her home. 
</P>
<P>
A larger-than-life picture of Elizabeth dressed in a white lacy dress and a 
veil hangs in the living room, a symbol of another part of the family's 
success. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, for the first time since she came to the United States, Lopez 
and her family returned to Tepic. The visit coincided with Elizabeth's 15th 
birthday, the time for the traditional Mexican quinceanera, or coming-out 
party. 
</P>
<P>
It was the most elaborate celebration the town had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez and Porfirio had saved for a year to pay for Elizabeth's dress and the 
festivities. They also bought the fabric to make dresses for girls from the 
town who served as her attendants. Porfirio's father gave one of his cows to 
feed the partygoers, and all of Lopez's brothers and sisters chipped in to 
provide two bands. 
</P>
<P>
It was an emotional homecoming for the family, but for the first time in 13 
years, Lopez realized that her ties with Mexico have changed. Her children's 
lives are here, she says, and they can not be transplanted. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to return to visit, but it's not their home," she says. "My children 
say they're Mexican, but now their customs are the customs of this country. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we'll stay here after all."

Dr. Joyce Brothers (April 24)) gives some fascinating explanations of why young 
people are motivated to enter various careers. She sees medicine as attractive 
to those interested in a "nurturing profession (where one) . . . can help 
others." 
</P>
<P>
Law is attractive to young people "who feel they were unfairly treated by 
adults." On the other hand, Dr. Brothers takes the position that teaching, and 
religious ministry, are attractive to those who "like to give orders and be 
seen as authorities." 
</P>
<P>
Get real, Joyce. Young people attracted to law and medicine are mostly drawn by 
the promise of big bucks; and the desire to help and nurture is stronger among 
those who go into teaching and the clergy. 
</P>
<P>
I imagine that Dr. Brothers would assert that young people are drawn to the 
profession of psychology because they believe that they will eat of the fruit 
of the Tree of Knowledge and become like gods. After reading her column, I 
think she could use a few more mouthfuls.

I took RU-486 in December, 1986, when I was three weeks pregnant. Twenty-four 
hours later I began to have severe cramping and started vomiting. When this had 
gone on for 10 to 12 hours, a friend took me to the County-USC Emergency Room. 
After an excruciating pelvic exam, I was given a shot of Demerol, which did 
nothing, and a prescription for a prostaglandin inhibitor to slow down the 
process, which did relieve the pain. I had mild bleeding for a few days and 
then six days after taking the drug, I began to hemorrhage. I continued to 
bleed or spot until mid-March, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not sure why I had such an extreme response. I chose to take the drug 
rather than have a surgical abortion because it had been presented to me as a 
relatively benign experience. I also thought it might help advance the causes 
of both science and women. 
</P>
<P>
Do I think RU-486 should be licensed in the United States? I'm not sure. I had 
access to many resources not available to the general population of women who 
might take this drug. I am a registered nurse who works at one of the most 
sophisticated hospitals in the world. I was cared for by the research team 
investigating the drug. I had no children who needed to be cared for. 
</P>
<P>
The same cannot be said for women of the Third World. It also cannot be said 
for women in the United States who do not have access to adequate health care. 
In France, and all of the industrialized nations of the world, except the 
United States, access to health care is a right, not a privilege. That makes 
the use of RU-486 in those settings a safer option than here or in the Third 
World.

The article about Dr. Grimes and RU-486 was timely and informative. 
</P>
<P>
It was also upsetting. Dr. Grimes stated that women in Bangladesh have more 
reproductive choices than do women in the United States. How sad, scary, and 
upsetting that life-saving medication for women is not readily available. 
</P>
<P>
I admire Dr. Grimes for his courage, perseverance, and concern for women. 
</P>
<P>
What can women do to demand the availability of this breakthrough drug?

Regarding the very long article on Dr. Grimes, what a sad commentary on our 
civilization that such a talented and accomplished doctor is using his medical 
knowledge to extinguish life rather than save it. 
</P>
<P>
It was especially disturbing to read that the doctor and his wife couldn't 
stand to see his first hospitalized pediatric patient die, but that it doesn't 
bother them to see a life snuffed out with the use of the RU-486 pill or other 
means.

POLITICS: UNABLE TO IMAGINE THE VICE PRESIDENT IN THE WHITE HOUSE, AND AWARE OF 
GROWING VOTER DOUBTS, MANY REPUBLICANS JOCKEY TO REPLACE HIM.

<TEXT>
<P>
"The Dumping of J. Danforth Quayle" sounds like a 1920s short-story title, but 
it may turn out to be a 1990s political tragedy -- at least for its leading 
character. With the vultures already circling, from Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III on down, the chance that the vice president will be dropped from the 
1992 Republican ticket is at once very real, probably necessary and maybe even 
a little unfair. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to say Dan Quayle has been a bad vice president. He is probably as 
competent as a third of the previous vice presidents and at least the same 
percentage of current U.S. senators. The Quayle jokes so prominent on 
late-night TV target something else -- his dubious qualifications to succeed to 
the presidency, the only vice-presidential task specified in the U.S. 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Imagining him in the White House is, of course, the problem. George Bush's 
choice of Quayle was mind-boggling to most Republicans attending the 1988 
convention in New Orleans. Many viewers were unimpressed with the young Indiana 
senator's debate with his vice-presidential rival, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas 
-- where Quayle displayed the acuity of a deer frozen in automobile headlights. 
Since then, voters' doubts have festered. Recent Gallup polls show the 
percentage of Americans who believe Quayle qualified to become President has 
dropped from 46% in October, 1988, to 34% in May, 1989, and 31% this March; 
while the percentage who dismiss him as unqualified has increased from 42% to 
52% this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians and observers in Washington share this grass-roots skepticism. No 
one event or foolishness stands out. But Quayle is always making some inept 
remark -- like calling Samoans "happy campers" on a visit there -- and 
nervousness is always high when he leaves on a foreign trip -- after all, he 
returned from his recent Latin American visit with an anatomically correct 
doll. His inability to convey substance is beginning to shape a reluctant 
conclusion that there's little substance to convey. 
</P>
<P>
The dilemma now facing Bush and the GOP is: If the '92 presidential election 
starts looking close, then Quayle's potential role as a 1- or 2-point November 
drag becomes critical. If Bush seeks a second term, he'll turn 70 halfway 
through it, a factor the Democrats could use to turn the spotlight on the man 
who would succeed him. But even if the 1992 election doesn't look close, 
renominating Quayle poses a problem for the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1940s, the vice presidency has evolved from a backwater to a 
waiting-room for the White House party's heir-presumptive. The big jump came 
when Dwight D. Eisenhower's two-term vice president, Richard M. Nixon, became 
next-in-line in 1960, followed by the success of Hubert H. Humphrey, Lyndon B. 
Johnson's vice president, in getting the 1968 Democratic nomination. Then 
Walter F. Mondale, Jimmy Carter's vice president, won the 1984 nomination, and 
Bush carried on the tradition in 1988. Of the last nine U.S. Presidents, five 
previously served as vice presidents. 
</P>
<P>
Thus if Quayle is renominated in 1992, because Bush looks like an easy winner 
and nobody wants to be divisive, he gets a big leg-up on the GOP nomination for 
1996. That's true for three reasons. First, if Bush keeps him in 1992, the 
President will have to burnish his running-mate's marginal credentials. Second, 
anyone with eight years as vice president gets a patina of high-level 
experience, even if deep down he doesn't have it. And third, a two-term vice 
president can bank an awful lot of chits with party organizations and 
officials. All of this, plus history, would tend to make Quayle the early 
nomination favorite for 1996 -- possibly even if a Bush alter-ego such as Baker 
decided on a last-minute challenge. 
</P>
<P>
If Democrats enjoy this scenario, many Republicans don't. Even a top-quality 
vice president has trouble bucking voter restlessness when his party has 
already had eight years in the White House. So selling a Quayle in 1996 -- even 
a more mature Quayle who's graduated from Johnny Carson's monologue -- after 
Republicans have held the White House for 16 years could be impossible. For 
this reason, the argument goes, Quayle has to be kicked out of the training 
room in 1992 so that a GOP heavyweight -- heck, even a light heavyweight -- can 
take his place. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of elected and appointed Republican officials already palpitate every 
time they hear "Hail to the Chief" -- and not a few hope to replace Quayle in 
1992. Besides various senators and congressmen, five Cabinet members have been 
mentioned over the last 18 months -- Baker, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, 
Atty. Gen. Richard L. Thornburgh, Housing Secretary Jack Kemp and drug czar 
William J. Bennett. Three seem to be fading: Thornburgh -- a weak Justice 
Department performance overshadows his credentials as governor of Pennsylvania; 
Bennett -- his ambition exceeds his drug war gains, and Cheney -- unless 
glasnost ends, the Pentagon is a crypt for Oval Office seekers. Two still seem 
strong, however. Baker is one of Bush's closest friends and political allies. 
And Kemp, aside from his credible performance at the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development, has an ideological appeal that could placate conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
Ideology could be a serious problem. Quayle may not be nudging Albert Einstein 
out of the record books intellectually, but he's doing a good job of tactically 
imitating several prior GOP vice presidents by emphasizing his ties to the 
right. If Bush is still edging leftward next year -- inviting gay activists 
into the White House, conservatives grumble, while avoiding "right-to-lifers" 
-- then replacing Quayle with anyone but another conservative could be 
provocative. 
</P>
<P>
Another difficulty could develop if Bush and Baker really do start conspiring 
to slate the secretary of state in as vice president in 1992 and move Quayle to 
the Pentagon morgue. Quayle might assent -- it might even be at his ostensible 
request -- but the White House could bank on dissent elsewhere within the GOP 
coalition. It is not that tactical problems would complicate having Bush and 
Baker on the same ticket -- because Texas' electoral votes could not legally be 
cast for both. Either man could simply shift his voting address after November 
but before the Electoral College met in December. 
</P>
<P>
The real problem is the grandiosity of ambition such a move would signal -- the 
creation of a "Texas Dynasty" to match the "Virginia Dynasty" of the early 19th 
Century. From Thomas Jefferson's 1801 inauguration through the 1820s, the vice 
presidency was a dead-end. Secretaries of state moved on to become President -- 
with one Virginian succeeding another. Finally, Andrew Jackson made his 
secretary of state shift to the vice presidency. Now if Bush wants 
fishing-buddy Baker to be his heir, he may have to do the same. The risk of a 
"Texas Dynasty" debate -- of disgruntlement over the political equivalent of 
incest -- could be considerable. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly what is in Bush's mind no one can say -- probably not even Baker. Some 
cynics believe Bush actually picked Quayle in part as insurance against a 
remotely possible accusation or development in the Iran-Contra affair. The 
Senate, the reasoning went, would never impeach Bush and make Quayle President 
-- as several senators privately said last year when declining to press too 
hard in questioning Bush's former national security aide. But if that was a 
factor in Bush's selection of Quayle, then its fading relevance today could 
increase Bush's temptation to make a new choice for 1992. 
</P>
<P>
If not, there are times when Presidents have to swallow pride and admit they 
picked badly. When Franklin D. Roosevelt was running for a fourth term in 1944, 
a year away from his death, he decided to dump Henry A. Wallace, the 
controversial vice president he had chosen in 1940. Harry S. Truman was picked 
instead, to the benefit of the Democratic Party. Bush might have to make the 
same choice in '92 -- and one way or another, Quayle's fate could be as 
important to the country and his party as Wallace's was almost 50 years ago.

REDISTRICTING: HIGH-MINDED DEBATE IS LARGELY SMOKE AND MIRRORS -- HIGHFALUTIN 
DOUBLESPEAK MASKING A GUTTER WAR FOR CONTROL OF CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE.

It's spring, and hard-core fanatics are poring over box scores and performance 
statistics. Fantasy baseball? No, these are technocrats and politicians 
consumed by reapportionment -- or redistricting, as it's also known. This 
decennial rite of reallocating and reshaping legislative and congressional 
districts is an exercise with stakes much higher than a fictitious World Series 
win. 
</P>
<P>
Some similarities exist, however, between fantasy baseball and reapportionment: 
Both are complex games with their own set of rules. Both are played by small 
bands of zealots who speak a strange language that only they care about and 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
What happens in fantasy baseball -- born during the 1981 baseball strike and 
popular among sports fans -- is that people act as "owners" who put together 
their "dream teams" by "drafting players" off current rosters. It's all done 
with statistics and batting averages. 
</P>
<P>
Redistricting is the political equivalent -- a Byzantine, arcane ritual of 
little interest to anyone except a few politicians fighting to control the 
distribution of power. But gerrymandering -- drawing districts to the political 
advantage of one party over another -- has been a U.S. tradition from the days 
of Massachusetts Gov. Elbridge Gerry. (In 1812, the Republican-controlled state 
Legislature carved up Massachusetts to diminish the power of the Federalist 
Party. One sprawling district resembled a salamander or, as a Federalist 
derided it, a "Gerrymander.") 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, most Californians have largely ignored reapportionment. The 
electorate just doesn't seem to care about politicians' "dugout scuffles." Or, 
as Jay Leno explained the low return of census forms, "The census determines 
how many representatives we have in Congress. No wonder they're not sending 
them back." 
</P>
<P>
But that's exactly why reapportionment is an especially hot topic this year -- 
at least inside the ballpark. California stands to gain about seven new 
congressional seats after the 1990 census. That would bring the state's total 
to 52 -- nearly 12% of the entire House membership. Those stakes have drawn 
Republican and Democratic Party leaders, in California and nationally, into a 
fight over remapping methodology. And they're slugging it out June 5 in the 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
Redistricting in California is now carried out by the Legislature, subject to 
the governor's veto and the possibility of a voter referendum or judicial 
review. That's why, after the 1980 census, state Democrats, controlling both 
the Legislature and the governorship, managed to skew reapportionment in their 
favor. 
</P>
<P>
If the GOP loses the California governorship this year, the Democrats could 
once again draw the lines to suit themselves. The Republicans are trying to 
prevent that. Up at bat are two initiatives, Propositions 118 and 119 on the 
June ballot, which would change the way California draws legislative districts. 
</P>
<P>
Reformers have tried the initiative process before to curb the Legislature's 
power over reapportionment, arguing that incumbent redistricting is an inherent 
conflict of interest. They struck out. 
</P>
<P>
This time the voters might be more receptive, because the call for reform of 
the reapportionment process comes in the wake of scandal, partisan wrangling 
and policy gridlock in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Proposition 118, whose ballot title is "Legislature / Ethics / 
Reapportionment," uses ethics as a hook to sell redistricting. Sponsored by 
Gary Flynn, a Republican ally of Gov. George Deukmejian and supported by 
Republican Party organizations, it places remapping responsibility into the 
hands of a beefed-up Joint Legislative Ethics Committee. The proposal also bans 
gifts and honorariums from legislative lobbyists or people whose firm employs 
lobbyists, and prohibits legislators from becoming lobbyists for one year after 
leaving office. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 118's ethics package has been criticized as "shallow" and "vague" 
by both Republicans and Democrats. However, its redistricting standards are 
more specific. The Legislature retains the authority to redistrict, but a plan 
needs a two-thirds vote of each house to be enacted; only a majority is 
required now. The governor is given absolute veto power over reapportionment 
plans and, once passed, plans must be submitted for voter approval. Proposition 
118 also requires that all districts be compact and respect local government 
boundaries, and prohibits favoring a particular party or incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 119, titled Reapportionment by Commission, is sponsored by San 
Mateo County Supervisor Tom Huening and supported by the California League of 
Women Voters. It takes redistricting completely out of the hands of elected 
officials and creates a 12-member bipartisan commission, appointed by retired 
appellate court justices, to vote on reapportionment plans submitted by 
registered voters. Proposals must meet certain criteria, including a 
requirement that minority populations be divided in such a way that their 
political clout will not be diluted. The plans adopted by the commission would 
become law, subject only to referendum or judicial review. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of both propositions argue that their reforms would decrease 
partisanship and politics in the reapportionment process. Maybe. Maybe not. 
Never underestimate the "unintended consequences of reform." Or dismiss the 
possibility of ulterior motives. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is that redistricting is a political process. That makes it a 
partisan issue and the vote on the two propositions -- and the campaigns 
surrounding them -- will reflect that reality. 
</P>
<P>
The high-minded debate over "fairness," "participation," "compactness," 
"accountability" is largely smoke and mirrors. All this highfalutin doublespeak 
masks a gutter war whose spoils include control of California's future. 
</P>
<P>
Both propositions would decrease the dominance of the Legislature's current 
majority party over the redistricting process. If you're a Republican, you'll 
probably like that. If you're a Democrat, you won't. It's as simple as that. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of both propositions insist "objective criteria" for drawing lines 
will prevent legislators from gerrymandering. But just because a district looks 
pretty doesn't mean it isn't gerrymandered. 
</P>
<P>
Just because the battle over reapportionment is partisan, that doesn't make it 
wrong. Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) hit it when he told a reporter, "I 
don't see any clear line between the political process and the legislative 
process. The legislative process depends on who is elected to office." The way 
legislative districts are drawn determines who governs. Who governs, in turn, 
determines what our state's policy priorities will be. 
</P>
<P>
But don't think that merely changing the reapportionment system will solve the 
problems of political gridlock and weak leadership that plague California. In 
today's political system, a government that is responsible and accountable to 
all its citizens is difficult to achieve. Money, power, personalities and 
values all play a role in preventing it. There's little indication that new 
lines will change that. 
</P>
<P>
Neither will voter apathy and ignorance. If the anemic turnouts of recent years 
are an indication, a small number of June voters will determine how they want 
California's "dream team" chosen and what the players will look like. 
</P>
<P>
That noted sage Yogi Berra would argue, "If the people don't want to come out 
to the park, nobody's gonna stop 'em." Well, that might be fine for our 
national pastime, but it's not so good for representative government. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the outcome of the June election, unless California voters start to 
pay attention, reapportionment will remain a closed game of insider's baseball.

BRADY PLAN FOR LATIN DEBT DESERVES A SECOND CHANCE; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMICS: TREASURY SECRETARY'S SCHEME NEEDS MONEY AND A STRONGER COMMITMENT 
FROM INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS TO MAKE RULES MORE FAVORABLE. 
</P>

Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten years after the debt crisis first hit, a large number of Latin American 
countries, including all the major economies, still cannot service their 
liabilities and grow economically. Imports have declined by roughly $40 
billion. Investment as a percentage of gross domestic product has fallen, from 
23% to 16%. Clearly, the Latin debt crisis is more than a prolonged liquidity 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
The overextended condition of borrowers and creditors was abruptly spotlighted 
in 1981-82, when interest rates zoomed and the prices of the region's primary 
export commodities plummeted. True, many Latin Americans had recognized the 
problem before then. But the creditor governments acted as if the loan 
arrangements were between a neighborhood bank and small-town customers. 
</P>
<P>
When financial crises as Gargantuan as the American savings-and-loan fiasco 
occur, governments usually intervene to keep the financial system solvent and 
sustain domestic output and employment. Though these "public bailouts" violate 
traditional liberal economic theory, they generally prove to be good policy if 
health is restored to the ailing institution. 
</P>
<P>
The Latin America debt problem surely cries out for such comprehensive action. 
The initial efforts of the industrialized countries, however, aimed at 
stabilizing only one side of the international system -- their domestic 
economies and private banks. They succeeded admirably. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, this success seriously impaired the economic performance of the 
indebted countries. When this fact was recognized by then-Secretary of the 
Treasury James A. Baker III in 1985, the solution he offered was too little, 
too late. Not until March, 1989, when Secretary of the Treasury Nicholas F. 
Brady announced his plan, did a more comprehensive debt-relief framework 
emerge. Perhaps its most important feature was to restore balance to the 
distribution of costs and benefits associated with managing international debt. 
</P>
<P>
The Brady plan would enhance and accelerate Latin debt reduction by enabling 
banks to liquidate their "old debt" in one of two ways. Either a country could 
buy back its debt at a significant discount or take on "new debt," again at a 
discount, by changing its "old debt" into creditor equity. 
</P>
<P>
For this approach to work, some public funding would be needed, either to 
finance the buy-backs or, more important, to offer the guarantees that would 
make "new debt" attractive to a creditor. Private banks could also be 
encouraged to participate by modifying legal, regulatory, accounting and tax 
codes that govern them. Thus, the Brady plan intended to stimulate policy 
reform and economic growth in debtor countries through voluntary, case-by-case, 
debt and debt-service reduction. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly a step in the right direction. But the Brady plan has collided with 
difficulties: 
</P>
<P>
It is seriously underfunded. The existing pool of committed public money -- $30 
billion -- can finance only a fraction of needed reduction. The Economic 
Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean estimates that at least three 
times that sum is needed to have an effect. 
</P>
<P>
Private banks in most industrialized countries still lack any incentive, or 
face any punishment, that might spur them to settle their Latin American 
claims. It is thus essential -- and practical -- for the governments of 
creditor banks to change the regulatory, accounting and tax rules. 
</P>
<P>
The Brady-inspired negotiations have been cumbersome, drawn-out affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Mainly for these reasons, many observers, in debtor as well as in creditor 
countries, have mistakenly declared the Brady plan all but dead. Its conceptual 
framework is solid. Most important, the means to make it work are well within 
reach: By global standards, a commitment of $90 billion seems a small price to 
pay for putting Latin American and Caribbean nations back on their financial 
feet. Most of that commitment does not have to be "up front." It need only be 
in the form of contingent liabilities. Further, most of the multilateral 
institutional framework is in place, although the International Monetary Fund 
should be more assertive in guaranteeing financing. 
</P>
<P>
The Brady plan thus contains most of the ingredients necessary to eliminate the 
Latin American and Caribbean debt overhang. Its potential could be further 
reinforced by establishing a multilateral debt agency under the aegis of the 
World Bank and/or the IMF. This agency could lessen the inefficiencies of the 
current piecemeal approach to debt reduction and lower its ultimate public 
costs.

A SOVIET PLEA FOR ENDING MOSCOW'S MILITARY ACCORD WITH EASTERN EUROPE;

<P>
ALLIANCE: A RUSSIAN POLITICAL SCIENTIST SEES SOLID REASONS FOR SCRAPPING THE 
WARSAW PACT. 'THE OLD PARADIGM OF NATIONAL SECURITY IS HOPELESSLY OUTDATED.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Vladimir A. Saveliev, Vladimir A. Saveliev, a political scientist affiliated 
with the Soviet Academy of Sciences in Moscow, is the author of five Soviet 
books on government and politics. He has been visiting the United States with 
an Earthwatch delegation.

<TEXT>
<P>
Today, when Eastern European governments are falling and economies are being 
turned inside out, when the superpowers are finding it harder to flex their 
military muscle, many of us in the Soviet Union are wondering why we still 
maintain the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
How can this bloc, established after World War II in the context of an 
East-West face-off, be relevant to the national security interests of the 
Soviet Union today? What is the purpose of a Cold War alliance whose most 
visible recent troop maneuvers have been trains leaving Czechoslovakia and 
Hungary? 
</P>
<P>
Despite the pace of change in the East, some senior members of the Soviet 
political and military leadership argue for preserving the Warsaw Pact in some 
form. And they have gotten some ammunition from their North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, NATO ministers issued a communique saying: "In the midst of 
change and uncertainty, the alliance remains a reliable guarantor of peace. It 
will provide an indispensable foundation of stability, security and cooperation 
for the Europe of the future." 
</P>
<P>
Some Soviet military experts perceive the pact as a brake against aggression, 
pressure or interference from the West, which remains a very real fear to many. 
Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, former chief of the Soviet general staff and 
currently an adviser to Mikhail S. Gorbachev, summarizes the view of Soviet 
doomsayers: U.S. and NATO armed forces "are not being reduced"; the United 
States and NATO continue to affirm the 20 year-old strategy of "flexible 
response" that entails preparation for a nuclear first strike on Eastern Europe 
and the Soviet Union, and U.S. leaders continue to speak of dealing with the 
Soviet Union from a "position of strength." 
</P>
<P>
This is not only the viewpoint of marshals and generals in Moscow. My father, 
now 74, is a retired lieutenant colonel living in Ulianovsk on the Volga River. 
He remembers World War II firsthand, and has often repeated Oliver Cromwell's 
saying: "Put your trust in God, my boys, but keep your powder dry." He and many 
other Soviet citizens vividly recall the losses and sacrifices of the Great 
Patriotic War and see the Warsaw Pact as an important guarantee against the 
threat of a new war from German territory. 
</P>
<P>
But for all the force and sincerity with which many Soviets cling to these 
traditional views, others, including myself, see more solid arguments for 
scrapping the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, it doesn't take a cynic to wonder why many Western leaders 
paradoxically are more interested than the Soviets in keeping the Warsaw Pact 
going. Behind the talk of "aid to Gorby," continuity, stability and so forth, 
is there not a wish to protect NATO's raison d'etre? If there is no "present 
danger," who will want to spend taxpayers' money to finance a Western military 
alliance? 
</P>
<P>
The need to find a rationale for NATO is made even more pressing by the 
historic changes taking place in all six of the Soviet Union's Eastern European 
allies: Principles of equality and freedom of choice in relations among the 
countries, and developing political and economic pluralism within each, make 
the bogyman of a Soviet tank attack against Western Europe seem more remote 
than ever. 
</P>
<P>
Disbanding the Warsaw Pact would ease tensions between the Soviet Union and its 
East European neighbors. The pact seems likely to die on its own -- even more 
quickly than NATO. But the sooner it is put to an end, the sooner the Soviet 
Union will be able put relationships with its former satellites to the west on 
a sound footing. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Warsaw Pact should go because we can't afford it anymore. 
Americans have complained for years that they're footing too much of the 
defense burden for their allies, while Japan and Germany have been freed up to 
outstrip them in trade. We Soviets have the same problem. 
</P>
<P>
From 50% to 60% of the Pentagon budget is devoted "to protect Europe." Soviet 
expenditures related to the Warsaw Pact are not published, but could account 
for at least as large a share of the Soviet defense budget. Political 
developments in the other pact countries are likely to cause them to reduce 
their financial contribution to the alliance. But why should the Soviets have 
to pay the bill? The prospects of German unification, for instance, should 
remind the Poles and the Lithuanians that they may need Russian protection in 
the future for land that was ceded to them after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary, Poland and other Eastern European countries, driven by economic 
imperatives and political changes, are now starting to cut down the size of 
their armies and develop new national defense doctrines. Shouldn't we Soviets 
be doing the same? 
</P>
<P>
Currently, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in 
London, the Soviet Union contributes about 80% of the Warsaw Pact's fighters 
and bombers, 90% of its armored personnel carriers and 70% of its tanks. So 
Soviets are struggling under an even heavier burden than the United States is 
for its allies. 
</P>
<P>
These countries may wind up becoming as much a trade nemesis for the Soviet 
Union as Japan has been for the United States. I am reminded of an old babushka 
in the market complaining about the ruble drain to protect Cuba or Hungary: 
"When will they stop spending our money abroad and feed the Russians at home? 
Why are they so concerned about unfriendly foreigners and forget their own 
Motherland?" 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the American military presence in Europe is becoming more and 
more unpopular on both sides of the Atlantic. At the end of 1989, only 30% of 
the West Germans approved of the American presence, according to one poll. 
According to polls last January by Gallup and Yankelovich, a majority of 
Americans also favor troop withdrawals. 
</P>
<P>
The process of perestroika in the Soviet Union and of political and economic 
change in Eastern Europe can only exacerbate the strains on the Warsaw Pact. 
Nevertheless, a decision to disband it will come hard, simply because for so 
many years, the question of its usefulness has been "zona vnye kriticki" -- 
untouchable. 
</P>
<P>
Economic and bureaucratic interests that thrived in an atmosphere of superpower 
confrontation will not easily abandon their hard-line views. Nor is 
self-interest the only obstacle to change: Old fears persist long after the 
circumstances from which they arose have changed. One must sympathize with 
those who find it paradoxical to argue that the Soviet Union's security will be 
enhanced if it abandons its bloc umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
But in the end, the emotional logic of the old way must yield to the real logic 
of the new. The old paradigm of national security, which underpins the 
existence of the Warsaw Pact, is hopelessly outdated in a world in which the 
Soviet Union seeks its security in withdrawing military forces from Afghanistan 
and negotiating far-reaching arms reductions at the same time that it marches 
toward democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Soviets have to get rid of that part of their "defense consciousness" which 
whispers that all socialist countries are encircled by mortal enemies just 
waiting for signs of weakness and disunity. We need to forge a new, broader 
view of national security, which considers non-military factors, including our 
country's economic, social and ecological health. 
</P>
<P>
As for the military dimension of security, I would like us to avoid two 
extremes: On the one hand, we must not risk instability by reducing our 
military strength too much, below what is sufficient for a reasonable defense; 
on the other, we must not interfere with efforts to develop new all-Europe 
security arrangements. In time, the latter might involve the Soviet Union, 
Poland and other pact members joining current NATO members in a common security 
system. 
</P>
<P>
It's high time for the Soviet Union to stop thinking in terms of bloc politics. 
As a billion people build a new, integrated Europe, economic and humanitarian 
goals will dominate international relationships. And if the Soviet Union is to 
pursue Gorbachev's goal of a "common European house," it must let Hermes, the 
god of commerce, displace Mars.

ENDING U.S. AID TO EL SALVADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The editorial "El Salvador -- a Big Question" (April 17) goes a long way toward 
recognizing the futility and the immorality of U.S. intervention in El 
Salvador. Yet in the end it accepts the logic that has kept U.S. arms aid 
fueling the war for the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
"Without outside aid," you say, "El Salvador's war-ravaged economy would 
collapse." But for most Salvadorans, with the notable exception of the 
oligarchic and military elite, the economy already has collapsed. More than 
half the adult work force is unemployed, and living standards have plummeted. 
</P>
<P>
Against the aid cutoff proposed by several congressional leaders, you argue 
that such a move might tempt "leftist rebels to try and strike a knockout 
blow." But it is clearly the hard-line right in the government and the army, 
and not the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), that would prefer 
a military solution at this point. 
</P>
<P>
A cutoff of U.S. aid would help produce progress toward a negotiated political 
settlement, with concessions made by both sides. 
</P>
<P>
But even if, as seems unlikely, an aid cutoff were to bring about the outright 
collapse of the Cristiani govennment, its replacement would most likely be a 
coalition of all the democratic opposition forces on the center and left, 
including the Christian Democrats, the social democratic parties, and the FMLN. 
Such a reformist government would be a vast improvement over the nightmarish 
regime now in power. 
</P>
<P>
Until we back up our professed concern for human rights by halting all arms 
aid, the war will continue and the negotiations under way now in Geneva will 
achieve little.

REPLACING QUAYLE WITH BAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So, Republican strategiests are considering taking Vice President Dan Quayle 
off the 1992 ticket, and moving him to secretary of defense! If this item were 
datelined April 1, it would be more appropriate (Part A, April 24). 
</P>
<P>
Here is a man who turned heaven and earth to keep from going to Vietnam -- 
shoehorning himself into the Indiana National Guard and into law school over 
those ahead of him in line. How would our valiant men and women of the armed 
forces regard Quayle as their boss? 
</P>
<P>
Here's another idea that makes about as much sense: Move William Bennett out of 
his job drug czar and put in Timothy Leary.

REPLACING QUAYLE WITH BAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times article is interesting and insightful but you should not have stopped 
just there. 
</P>
<P>
The man who engineered the way for two Presidents, while concurrently placing 
himself in a variety of career-advancing government positions, is far too 
creative to allow his long-time friend and current President to select as his 
first running mate someone who could keep the mantle of supreme power away from 
Baker for an additional eight years. 
</P>
<P>
The real thinking, begun long ago -- and by Baker himself -- probably was: 
"I've done chief of staff, I've done Treasury, while I'm Vicar of State, I'll 
make sure that my last steppingstone to the presidency will be only temporarily 
occupied by a disposable VP." 
</P>
<P>
Such a man as President could be an ominous force in the White House. But is 
that good, or bad?

'SMASH-MOUTH PEST CONTROL' METHOD TO ERADICATE MEDFLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William Jordan is right on with his description of "Smash-Mouth Pest Control" 
("Medfly vs. 
</P>
<P>
Macho," Commentary, April 23). I call it "the testosterone solution." If you 
don't understand something, kill it, rape it, or spray it in a territorial 
frenzy as tomcats do. 
</P>
<P>
I agree with Jordan that women are less inclined to use force. Yet when our 
young are threatened we are dangerous indeed. Even the alpha male cannot stand 
against us then. 
</P>
<P>
I call for an end to the malathion spraying and the prosecution of those 
criminals responsible for upsetting the balance of nature, endangering our 
lives, sickening our children and violating our constitutional rights.

ON MEASURE H, THE METER IS RUNNING; 
</P>
<P>
ETHICS: CABBIES ARE TICKETED FOR IMPROPER DRESS. WHY THEN SHOULD PUBLIC 
OFFICIALS BE REWARDED TO CLEAN UP THEIR ACT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOEL FOX, Joel Fox is president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seems that the Los Angeles City Council and the city's Transportation 
Commission believe that the cabbies have an image problem. 
</P>
<P>
They don't like the way they dress. So new rules have been established to bring 
some conformity to the appearance of these drivers. Hair must be groomed, 
shirts buttoned, hats must match the color of other clothing and toes must be 
covered. Skirts may be worn only by women. And objectionable body odors are 
out. Already a team of investigators is citing cabbies for breaking the rules. 
Companies may be assessed up to $100,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
The city will provide no financial reward to encourage conformity with these 
new guidelines. No money for hair styling or designer jeans (permissible if the 
overall look is "professional"). 
</P>
<P>
Contrast this approach with the code of ethics that the council has drawn up 
for itself and placed on the June ballot as Measure H. This proposed charter 
amendment was touted as the stiffest government ethics package in the country. 
Its proponents say that it will clear up any appearance of chicanery at City 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The code would ban gifts and honorariums, ban outside employment, limit 
spending by candidates for city offices and restrict lobbying by former 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, Measure H would remove the bad odors from city government. 
</P>
<P>
While the cabbies will be slapped with tickets by inspectors for ignoring the 
rules of proper behavior, elected officials must have incentives to clean up 
their act. The charter amendment that the council put on the ballot would 
establish the ethics code and, at the same time, raise council salaries from 
$61,522 to $86,156 a year, and lift other elected officials' salaries as well. 
</P>
<P>
This 40% increase will serve as a great incentive for improving City Hall's 
image. 
</P>
<P>
Why is it that government officials need the carrot of more money to improve 
their bad habits, while the stick of heavy fines is applied to the cabbies? I 
guess its easy to tell who runs things in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The cabbies will have to dip into their own pockets to get a better wardrobe. 
If Measure H passes, the elected officials get to dip into our pockets to run 
their campaigns. A fund not to exceed $8 million is set up for limited public 
financing of campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps there is an answer to this problem. Tell the elected city officials 
that we expect them to live up to the high standards they propose in Measure H 
-- just to keep their current salaries. Then we can take the $450,000 set aside 
for the City Hall raises and buy a store-full of designer jeans and matching 
hats for the cabbies.

<P>
ECONOMY: THE SCHEDULED CLOSING OF VERNON'S OSCAR MAYER PLANT DEEPENS THE 
DECLINE IN L.A. AREA INDUSTRIAL JOBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RODOLFO ACUNA, Rodolfo Acuna is professor of Chicano studies at Cal State 
Northridge.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The restructuring of Greater Los Angeles' economy reminds me of the song, "Ten 
Little Indian Boys." Slowly but surely, heavy industry has dwindled to the 
point where there's almost none. An important economic safety valve for 
thousands of area residents who either could not or did not want to go to 
college has thereby been closed. The scheduled shutdown in September of the 
Oscar Mayer Foods Corp. facility in Vernon is the lastest example of the trend. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Mayer was once a pacesetter in the meat-packing industry, paying good 
wages and benefits. That abruptly changed when the sausage-maker and its 
subsidiary, Louis Rich, were gobbled up in the mid-'80s by the largest food and 
beverage conglomerate in the country, Philip Morris. Oscar Mayer soon cut labor 
costs, largely through technological innovation that enabled plants to operate 
economically seven days a week. It also shifted the bulk of its production to 
more modern facilities in the Midwest. Other savings were extracted the 
old-fashioned way: wage concessions. 
</P>
<P>
Still, most analysts believed that Oscar Mayer would keep its profitable, 
though technologically backward, Vernon facility operating. Southeastern Los 
Angeles only recently regained its stability after the series of industrial 
exits in the late '70s -- General Motors from South Gate, Uniroyal and B.F. 
Goodrich from Commerce, Bethlehem Steel from Vernon. Countywide, 75,000 
manufacturing jobs have disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Some economists downplayed this devastation. These industries were purging 
themselves of inefficient facilities and overpaid managers and workers, they 
said. Soon, the workers were blamed for not being more productive. 
</P>
<P>
Such explanations may have proved satisfactory in the past, but not anymore. 
The workers at the Vernon plant are hardly greedy: In the last 10 years, they 
have received only one raise -- 25 cents an hour, to $10.94 an hour, say union 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Most of them have worked at the plant for more than 15 years and live nearby. 
Many are close to retirement. Sixty-five percent belong to Local 770 of the 
United Food and Commercial Workers International Union; 75% are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
One of the main reasons for closing the facility had little to do with worker 
productivity. Last year, the company paid $319 a month per Vernon worker for 
health-related benefits, compared with under $200 at its Madison, Wis., 
facility. This cost is built into any evaluation of whether a plant is 
efficient or not. 
</P>
<P>
So what's to be done? Let giant corporations eliminate health-care benefits and 
older workers? Oscar Mayer and its parent corporation are making large profits 
from their Los Angeles market. Some of that money should have gone toward 
paying their workers' medical coverage and full retirement plans. 
</P>
<P>
What is amazing is that the labor Establishment has rolled over in response to 
the Vernon closure. After all that has happened in Southeast L.A., labor has 
yet to develop a policy to stop plant closures. In fact, local union leaders 
say they are eager to fight plant shutdowns. They complain that it is the 
officers of the international, worried about other corporate contracts, who are 
eager to cut a deal and leave the locals to preside at a plant's funeral. 
Sources in the Los Angeles labor community say this seems to be the case with

Since it is evident that the labor Establishment won't do something about plant 
closures, the community and the local politicians should step in and call for a 
labor summit. They must recognize that a Los Angeles economy less and less 
industrialized is one that offers fewer and fewer well-paying blue-collar jobs, 
thereby blocking an escape route for minorities stranded in the underclass. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Mayer is entitled to move its plant anywhere it wants. But the community 
has every right to fight the move since it will have to pay the social costs. 
</P>
<P>
At bottom, what's at stake is the kind of metropolis we want in the year 2050. 
A recent study of the Graduate School of Architecture and Urban Planning shows 
that low-paying jobs and poverty are increasing at a faster pace in Los Angeles 
than anywhere else in the country, a trend that is directly linked to the 
flight of industry. Since Latinos are among those who have most acutely 
experienced the impact of plant shutdowns, Latino politicos should take the 
lead in developing a common strategy to stop the Oscar Mayers from moving out. 
If not, the good jobs that remain will, like the "Ten Little Indian Boys," 
dwindle to none.

Playwright/filmmaker David Mamet is reteaming with his favorite leading man, 
Joe Mantegna, for the contemporary New York police drama, "Homicide." 
</P>
<P>
To shoot in August on a $6-million-plus budget, it's about a Jewish homicide 
detective (Mantegna) whose investigation of a case leads to self-discovery. 
Mamet will adapt -- "loosely," we're told -- from the William Caunitz novel, 
"Suspects." Ed Pressman co-produces. 
</P>
<P>
"Look for a very David Mamet movie: very New York, with tough cops and tough 
talk," says a source close to the project, adding that the supporting cast will 
include "the Mamet stock company." 
</P>
<P>
Mamet and Mantegna have teamed previously in films ("House of Games," "Things 
Change") and plays ("Glengarry Glen Ross," "Speed-the-Plow"). From Pat H.

<P>
Armand Assante was still reeling from his first "Tonight Show" appearance when 
we talked with him last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a wreck. I'm just not an anecdotal type of guy," says Assante, who plans 
to write host Jay Leno a thank-you letter "for trying so hard to make me feel 
at ease." 
</P>
<P>
The "Tonight Show" booking was part of a flurry of interest in the versatile 
actor following his bravura performance as Puerto Rican gangster Bobby Texador 
in Sidney Lumet's gritty urban thriller, "Q&amp;A," which has generated 
critical raves. 
</P>
<P>
"As heinous a character as he is, he never lies," says Assante of the complex 
criminal, whom he plays with great ethnic flourish, stealing scenes from stars 
Nick Nolte and Timothy Hutton. "To me, that trait makes him a noble character." 
</P>
<P>
A suave, darkly handsome New York stage actor, Assante made his screen debut in 
Sly Stallone's "Paradise Alley" (1978), then played Goldie Hawn's French fiance 
in "Private Benjamin" (1980). And then, a career lull of about a year and a 
half. "Maybe the town really thought I was French," says Assante, who's of 
Italian/Irish descent. "With my name and looks, a lot of people seem to think 
I'm European." 
</P>
<P>
He's known for his riveting starring roles in small, independent films such as 
"I, the Jury" (1982) and "Belizaire the Cajun"(1986). But, he admits, "I was 
relegated to miniseries for a number of years to support myself. I've never 
really been courted by the studios. Because, except for 'Private Benjamin,' I 
wasn't in big hits." 
</P>
<P>
Assante, 40, who lives with his wife and two young daughters on a farm about an 
hour from Manhattan, has "Eternity" upcoming, co-starring with Jon Voight. And 
he's "in discussions" about two possible film roles, one involving Vietnamese 
boat people, the other a satire on Boston politics. 
</P>
<P>
Neither involves a major studio or director, but Assante assures us: "They're 
both very legitimately produced by the L.A. film community." From Pat H. 
Broeske

<P>
If NBC is successful, the old "Howdy Doody Show" will be resurrected -- with 
David Letterman involved. No, the late-night TV host -- who bears something of 
a resemblance to the gap-toothed cowboy marionette of TV legend -- would not 
play Howdy. 
</P>
<P>
He's been approached to take over the role of host from Buffalo Bob Smith, NBC 
chief Brandon Tartikoff tells us. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had several conversations with David Letterman and his production 
staff about doing a new version of 'Howdy Doody' for Saturday mornings," 
Tartikoff says. 
</P>
<P>
The discussions are only at the talking stage; Letterman's representatives 
aren't commenting. 
</P>
<P>
If Letterman agrees, the network is considering the show for fall, 1991. The 
original show ran 1947 to 1960 on NBC, then was syndicated briefly in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed "Howdy Doody" revival is part of Tartikoff's plan to beef up 
Saturday mornings at a time when network cartoon programs are steadily losing 
viewers to offerings from cable and independent stations. From Sharon Bernstein

Oscar-winning screenwriter Robert Towne is out, and novelist Pete Dexter is in, 
to write the adaptation of Kim Wozencraft's just-published cocaine-and-cops 
novel "Rush," which producers Richard and Lili Zanuck bought last year for $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Dexter, the Sacramento Bee columnist who won the National Book Award in 1988 
for his novel "Paris Trout," was hired because of Towne's lingering repair work 
on "Days of Thunder," the Tom Cruise movie now shooting in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't wait any longer," says Richard Zanuck, who had earlier commissioned 
Dexter to adapt his Western novel "Deadwood" and was pleased with the results. 
</P>
<P>
Dexter, 46, initially cracked the scriptwriting market when Viacom Pictures 
bought "Paris Trout" and let him adapt it for Showtime. "I've done magazines, 
the column and books," Dexter tells us. "I thought, why not try this?" 
</P>
<P>
Dexter spends mornings writing fiction, three afternoons a week on his 900-word 
column and the other afternoons on screenwriting -- currently working with 
director Michael Mann on "The Hat Squad," a project about a special L.A. 1950s 
police detail. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like I'm carrying the whole thing uphill," Dexter said of 
scriptwriting. "You don't have to spend 10 minutes figuring out a way to hold a 
sentence together." From Sean Mitchell

RICKY FORD 
</P>
<P>
"Manhattan Blues", Candid 
</P>
<P>
Tenorman Ford, a veteran of bands led by Charles Mingus and Mercer Ellington, 
displays his enterprising manner of combining modern and traditional values 
into a very appealing style. His big, rollicking sound and fleet improvisations 
make him sound like Ben Webster and Sonny Rollins rolled up in one. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by Jaki Byard (piano), Milt Hinton (bass) and Ben Riley (drums), Ford 
launches into six originals and three classics, Erroll Garner's "Misty" and 
Miles Davis' "Half Nelson" included. He wades through Monk's "In Walked Bud," 
knocking out gnarled, curving lines with aplomb; on the ballad, "Portrait of 
Mingus," he's sentimental without being cloying. 
</P>
<P>
Byard, a magical maverick, does not let us down, and the ageless Hinton (he's 
79) and Riley are the uplifting pair the bottom of a rhythm section should be. 
</P>
<P>
Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to five stars (a classic).

SONNY ROLLINS 
</P>
<P>
"Falling In Love With Jazz", Milestone 
</P>
<P>
Rollins' first album of the '90s is highlighted by two superb musical 
encounters -- on "For All We Know" and "I Should Care" -- with Branford 
Marsalis. 
</P>
<P>
But the most unusual track in the ballad-heavy collection is Rollins' 
transformation of the "Tennessee Waltz" into a soaring, passionately eloquent 
jazz sermon. Pianist Tommy Flanagan, a standout in a select group of backup 
players, plays with exquisite taste and precision on a album that both confirms 
and defines Rollins' preeminence among jazz tenor saxophonists.

DEXTER GORDON 
</P>
<P>
"Doin' Allright", Blue Note 
</P>
<P>
In 1961, when this date was recorded, the late Gordon had just returned to the 
jazz scene after an absence of several years due to personal problems. As even 
a brief listen to this effort will show, Gordon was in remarkable form, blowing 
flowing, rhythmically-dynamic lines buoyed by his trademark hearty tone. 
</P>
<P>
The program moves from medium tempos tunes like the Gershwin's pretty "I Was 
Doing All Right" and Gordon's cooker, "For Regulars Only" (two takes) to the 
exhilarating "It's You or No One," taken at a gallop. Gordon swings 
majestically through it all, and trumpeter Freddie Hubbard and pianist Horace 
Parlan add distinctively complex solo voices. 
</P>
<P>
In a word, this reissue is, as Gordon liked to quip, "solid." 
</P>

Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to five stars (a classic).

MARCUS ROBERTS 
</P>
<P>
"Deep in the Shed", RCA Novus 
</P>
<P>
This is an all blues album, or so says pianist Roberts; it depends on how 
strictly one construes the term. What his writing (for a three- or four-horn 
band) gains in diversity of moods, modes and meters, it loses now and then in 
true blues soul. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he has gone so deep into the woodshed that experimentation sometimes 
takes precedence over celebration. Still, it's an intriguing example of his 
evolution as a composer. Wessell Anderson's alto sax brings to "Nebuchadnezzar" 
the flavor of Ellington, or what Duke might be writing had he survived and 
advanced. "E. Dankworth" is a strong cut, thanks to the inventive trumpeter for 
whom it was named.

POP EYE: DEEJAYS GRATEFUL TO BE 'CLEAN AND CRAZY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
April Whitney, Jed the Fish and Chuck Randall are three L.A. deejays who've 
done time at KROQ-FM (Jed the Fish still handles the rock station's afternoon 
shift). But the trio of radio veterans have something else in common -- they're 
all recovering drug and alcohol abusers. 
</P>
<P>
* When Whitney was a popular KROQ deejay for much of the 1980s, her life was a 
big party -- a party where booze and drugs flowed freely. "There was a time at 
KROQ when it was the inmates running the asylum," she says now. 
</P>
<P>
* Jed the Fish, who's been at KROQ on-and-off since 1978, says he'd been 
involved with drugs for 20 years when he was arrested in March, 1989, for 
possession of heroin and drug paraphernalia. Randall, who was at KROQ in the 
early 1980s, was also a substance abuser. 
</P>
<P>
(Jed says he's been sober for a year; Whitney for more than two; Randall for 
four.) 
</P>
<P>
To celebrate their sobriety, the trio created a unique program that airs 
tonight on KROQ at 11 p.m. Called "Clean and Crazy," the show is devoted to 
such topics as drug addiction, co-dependency and obsessive-compulsive behavior. 
The threesome will also interview sober celebrities (tonight's scheduled guest 
is actress Drew Barrymore). 
</P>
<P>
"For all intents and purposes, this will be the first time I'll have been on 
the air at KROQ -- and been sober," said Whitney, who is married to Randall. 
"It just made sense to share what we've learned in our recoveries through the 
medium of radio." 
</P>
<P>
When Randall first discussed his concept of a "rock and recovery" show with Jed 
the Fish, they felt, they would have to pitch the idea to a small, 
non-commercial station. But KROQ program director Andy Schuon gave tonight's 
pilot episode an immediate green light. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt it was something important to be involved in," said KROQ general 
manager Trip Reeb, who will wait to gauge reaction before making a commitment 
for a regular time slot. "Drugs and drinking are problems that can't be 
over-addressed by the media." 
</P>
<P>
All three deejays have battled substance-abuse problems, but none more publicly 
than Jed the Fish, who was yanked off the air last year after his arrest. He 
spent 65 days in a detox clinic before rejoining the station last July. 
</P>
<P>
"It's scary getting real over the radio about our experiences," said Jed, whose 
drug charges were dismissed after he attended drug-diversion classes. "It's 
been sort of dismaying to see 'getting sober' being so in vogue now. You don't 
want to get sober just because it's hip. You get sober because you want to get 
sober. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important that we deal with this stuff KROQ-style, which is to 
say in a real unorthodox fashion. That's the idea behind the title 'Clean and 
Crazy.' We want to remind people that you can still have fun and be creative -- 
and be sober. 
</P>
<P>
"In the old days, I'd just shoot a bunch of dope, go on the air and do 
anything. I'd developed my crazy style as a result of getting high. But now it 
comes out of being me. I'm more clear-headed and more focused." 
</P>
<P>
Jed says the show's magazine-style format includes news segments, 
sober-celebrity interviews and phone-ins aimed at having listeners talk about 
their problems. The program will also offer distinctly unusual reviews. "If 
there's a film out that deals with drugs, we'll talk about our reactions to 
it," said Jed. "I remember when I saw 'Drugstore Cowboy,' it hit so close to 
home that I was in shock for most of the movie." 
</P>
<P>
If the program attracts a sizable audience, the trio want to syndicate it 
around the country. "We think it's an idea who's time has come," Randall says. 
"The three of us went through so much craziness in the past that it's ironic 
that we're back together to do this." 
</P>
<P>
Jed the Fish agrees. "It's one thing to tell kids not to do drugs. It's another 
thing to be able to tell them why -- from the perspective of your own personal 
pain and experience."

ON THE TOWN: How hot were tickets for Janet Jackson's recent quartet of 
concerts at the Forum? So hot that in a daring early evening robbery two 
Sundays ago, an unidentified thief stole $300 worth of tickets from the main 
gate at A&amp;M Records. According to staffers at A&amp;M, the robber told a 
security guard that he was a list for Jackson tickets. 
</P>
<P>
When the guard left his post to look for a different list, the thief grabbed a 
handful of ticket envelopes and dashed away. A&amp;M has still failed to locate 
the tickets. . . . Meanwhile, you could've put together a serious pick-up game 
with the contingent of Jackson fans who were on hand for the pop darling's 
opening-night show. Hoops royalty in attendance included Magic Johnson (who was 
a promoter of the concerts), Michael Cooper, Byron Scott, James Worthy, Vlade 
Divac and Larry Drew. Other celebs making appearances included Michael Jackson, 
Sly Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger (with wife Maria Shriver), Bill Murray, 
Dennis Hopper, Jimmy Smits, Matthew Modine, Jennifer Grey and Christian Slater.

PIGMENT ENVY

Dr. Frances L. Cress Welsing's theory about the origins of racism will no doubt 
trigger a deluge of mail from whites who feel their pants have been pulled down 
("Public Enemy and a Psychiatrist's Theory of Race," Pop Eye, April 29). I 
don't see how her pigment envy theory is any more ridiculous than Freud's idea 
that women have "penis envy."

I am a white male who has lived in and loved black communities in Detroit, New 
York and Los Angeles. Whites who have been victims of racism by blacks ought to 
consider their own inner feelings. White communities are rife with idiots who 
make racist remarks unchallenged. 
</P>
<P>
I live in Hollywood because while there is still racism here, it is less severe 
than most parts of this country. Ironically, that is probably the result of the 
liberalism of the same Jews that Professor Griff of the Public Enemy rap group 
feels are responsible for "the majority of wickedness."

Obviously, the Welsing theory does not take into account the careful historical 
research of scholars like Frank Snowden and the fact that relations were not 
inherently strained between Ethiopians, Greeks and Romans over 2,000 years ago. 
Nor does this theory help in explaining Japanese corporate racism toward 
African-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a more interesting angle. With the onset of the Cold War there has 
been a systematic effort to silence voices of the left in the black community, 
like Paul Robeson, W.E.B. DuBois and their progeny, who offered explanations of 
racism that focused on the slave trade and profit. 
</P>
<P>
Is it surprising that when one seeks systematically to discredit and to still 
such voices that inexorably stubborn and narrow nationalisms arise? The left 
seeks to unite across racial lines and as Eastern Europe is now demonstrating, 
when it declines, narrow nationalism flourishes. You can't have it both ways, 
i.e., you can't squash the left, then wring one's hand about Public Enemy.

Are we the only ones who resent the 20-minute movie previews we are shown in 
movie theaters? These previews reveal the entire plot, and they show all the 
major action and events. We end up feeling like we already saw the movie. 
Previews should entice viewers, not tell the entire story!

I would like to remind Calendar readers that there is always a rebellious 
nature to "underground" music, such as that performed by Public Enemy, the 
early Rolling Stones, Jim Morrison, etc. But never fear: Capitalism usually 
prevails, and the rebellious go mainstream.

RECALL OF COUNCILMAN IS SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of Inglewood residents began a recall effort against Councilman Garland 
Hardeman last week just six months after he took office. 
</P>
<P>
The residents charged in their complaint that Hardeman is consistently late for 
council meetings, does not respect council colleagues and staff, and has 
"attempted through threats, intimidation and coercion to profit from his 
position on the City Council." 
</P>
<P>
Hardeman, who has a seven days to answer the complaint, labeled the effort 
"name-calling and mudslinging" by political foes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the same individuals opposed to me being elected are now trying to get 
at me another way," he said. "They couldn't defeat me, so now they're trying to 
agitate me." 
</P>
<P>
The notice of intent to recall was filed Wednesday at City Hall by Richard 
Kaufman. The proponents were listed as Mamie Moore, Charles Moore, Viola 
Grahame, Donald Robinson and Peggy Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
There have been attempts in the past to recall councilmen in Inglewood but none 
have been successful, said City Clerk Hermanita Harris.

3 CHARGED WITH FALSIFYING EMISSIONS CERTIFICATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two owners and an inspector at a Wilmington auto import shop face 
misdemeanor charges for allegedly taking telephone orders for smog certificates 
without ever seeing or inspecting the cars. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the state Bureau of Automotive Repair and the Department of 
Consumer Affairs began investigating the trio after they received an anonymous 
tip last year that ASP Imports at 841 W. Anaheim St. in Wilmington was selling 
smog documents illegally, said Mike Qualls, a spokesman for Los Angeles City 
Atty. James K. Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
Under California law, vehicles must pass an automated emissions test every two 
years before their registration may be renewed. 
</P>
<P>
Charged in the case are shop owners Shirin Niaki, 33, and her husband George 
Albas (Johnny) Niaki, both of Park La Brea, and smog check inspector Sohail 
Fahmian, 40, of Redondo Beach, who goes by the name Vincent Castagliola. 
</P>
<P>
Each is charged with one count of falsifying smog certificates and one count of 
issuing the falsified documents as authentic, according to Deputy City Atty. 
Fay Chu. Each of the counts carries a maximum penalty of one year in county 
jail and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
George Niaki said in a telephone interview that Fahmian leased space from ASP 
Imports for his own smog certification business. Niaki said he and his wife 
were not aware that there was any wrongdoing at the smog check station. 
</P>
<P>
Fahmian could not be reached for comment. Niaki said Fahmian gave up his lease 
at the shop a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Undercover investigators made three purchases from ASP Imports, Qualls said. 
During the first purchase, investigators reportedly bought two smog 
certificates for $50. On the second trip, the officials bought five 
certificates for $130, and on their third trip, they bought 10 certificates for 
$260, Qualls said. Each time, he said, investigators telephoned the shop with 
their vehicle information and then picked up the documents without ever taking 
a car to the shop. 
</P>
<P>
The three defendants are scheduled to be arraigned May 24 in Los Angeles 
Municipal Court.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE

<P>
Tracking Drug Money 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 127 to 283, the House defeated the stricter of two proposals for 
banks to keep records of international wire transfers that could involve drug 
money. The proposal was for a Treasury Department pilot program in which 
selected banks would have had to keep track of customers wiring large sums 
overseas. Left intact by the vote was the softer approach, supported by bank 
lobbyists, of letting Treasury draft regulations to address the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The issue arose during debate on a bill (HR 3848), later sent to the Senate, 
that empowered the government to close institutions convicted of laundering 
drug money. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the pilot program aimed at catching drug 
traffickers.

government does not recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and keeps the

Budget Plan 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 106 to 305, the House rejected a blueprint for the government's 
$1.2-trillion fiscal 1991 budget. Popular among Republicans, the measure called 
for higher defense and lower social spending than the Democratic budget plan 
(HR 310) it sought to replace. But it was less generous to defense than 
President Bush's budget. Its main feature was to freeze defense and domestic 
spending other than for entitlement programs at 1990 levels. 
</P>
<P>
The vote occurred as the House worked toward approval of a 1991 congressional 
budget resolution that will guide later action on individual spending bills and 
serve as a bargaining tool in talks with the White House to set fiscal 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the GOP-backed budget plan.

MISL PLAYOFFS: THE SOCKERS SNAP BACK AT TALKATIVE ST. LOUIS, 5-4, TO WIN 
SERIES. THEY'LL FACE DALLAS IN WESTERN DIVISION FINALS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First things first. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers defeated the St. Louis Storm, 5-4, in St. Louis Arena Saturday to 
win the Western Division semifinal series, 3-1, and earn a berth against Dallas 
in the best-of-seven division championship series. 
</P>
<P>
Now, a word from Socker defender George Fernandez, a virtual Hamlet in short 
pants. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd just like to say," said Fernandez, pausing to collect his thoughts. "This 
team (the Storm) all year was talking . . . about us. They said we were the 
worst team, we have no character, we can't win the big game. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's bush. To me, it seemed like they thought they were better than 
us. I think we proved who was better and shoved it right down their throats. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the better team. We have better character. When it comes down to crunch 
time we can do it rather than talking about it." 
</P>
<P>
Defender Cacho added: "We talk after playing." 
</P>
<P>
It was back in February when one Storm player said this was San Diego's worst 
team. The Sockers, particularly Brian Quinn and Waad Hirmez, answered Saturday 
before a PTA-meeting-sized crowd of 3,889. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn assisted on four first-half goals, one short of veteran forward Steve 
Zungul's playoff record May 25, 1985, against Baltimore. The midfielder covered 
both ends of the field. 
</P>
<P>
"Quinn was brilliant," Socker Coach Ron Newman said. "Top of his game." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it was his attitude. He never considered that his team might pull its 
typical disappearing act because they were a step ahead of their opponent. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers were 6-20 away from home during the regular season. Big deal. In 
the playoffs, notes anybody wearing blue and gold, they are 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to win here more than anything," said Quinn, who leads the Sockers 
in the playoffs with two goals and seven assists. "I'm not afraid of failure." 
</P>
<P>
Hirmez, who scored the third hat trick of his playoff career, booted in the 
game-winner with 2:29 remaining, banging a shot off the boards that rebounded 
off goalie Slobo Ilijevski's back and into the goal. It was Hirmez's seventh 
game-winning goal in the playoffs, tying him at the top of the Sockers' list 
with Juli Veee, Branko Segota, Jean Willrich and Quinn. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers opened the scoring in the first quarter with the game's cleanest 
goal, Quinn knocking a crossing pass to Hirmez, who followed to send a 
25-footer into the right corner. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis tied it later in the quarter when midfielder Michael Collins sent a 
shot a few inches off the carpet in the direction of goalie Zoltan Toth. Toth 
appeared in position to make a diving save, but defender Ralph Black tried to 
block the ball, and it popped into the top of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
Storm forward Thompson Usiyan made it 2-1 when he capitalized on a Toth 
deflection from just outside the goal mouth. 
</P>
<P>
A little more than a minute later, Quinn scrapped with Ilijevski, who came out 
of the goal box in an attempt to clear the ball. Quinn won, turned and sent a 
pass across the middle to forward Paul Wright, who beat defender Daryl Doran to 
tie it. 
</P>
<P>
With two Sockers and one Storm player in the penalty box, St. Louis made good 
on a four-on-three advantage, midfielder Claudio De Oliveira scoring off the 
thigh of defender Kevin Crow. 
</P>
<P>
By halftime, the Sockers were back on top, 4-3, Quinn assisting on a goal by 
forward Rod Castro and another by Hirmez. Dropping into a more defensive game 
in the third quarter, the Sockers held the Storm scoreless, but took just two 
of their 24 total shots. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis tied it again 5:57 into the fourth quarter, when defender Mark 
Frederickson followed Toth's deflection of a shot by forward Stan Terlecki and 
sent it into the top right corner. 
</P>
<P>
Toth, now 3-0 in the playoffs, might not have been as sharp as he was Tuesday, 
but he made 23 saves. It was a busy night considering St. Louis took 16 more 
shots than the Sockers. 
</P>
<P>
Segota has yet to find the playoff form that has made him so valuable to past 
Socker championship teams. He was without a point Saturday and had just four in 
the series. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not upset," he said. "I didn't score, but we won. That's what the name of 
the game is." 
</P>
<P>
The playoff game is one the Sockers are quite familiar with. By contrast, this 
is new stuff to the Storm, an expansion franchise. If the Sockers were only 
slightly more talented, they proved to be significantly more cerebral. 
</P>
<P>
And to that, Storm Coach Don Popovic can only tip his hat. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego is a great team," he said. "I think it will be a much more difficult 
series in Dallas for them because Dallas is more disciplined than us. If they 
get past Dallas, I think they will definitely win the championship." 
</P>
<P>
One thing to remember: The Sockers are 28-28, .500 for the first time since 
they were 10-10 on Jan. 12. A sign of better things to come? 
</P>
<P>
"Damn right," Fernandez said. "I think we're hungry to play Dallas." 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
This is the schedule for the Dallas series: Games 1 and 2, Friday and Saturday 
in Dallas. Games 3, 4 and 5, May 18, 20, 22 in San Diego. Games 6 and 7, May 24 
and 26 in Dallas.

DRAKE HITS FOR CYCLE AS MUSTANGS ROUT CSUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN LUIS OBISPO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No baseball team has been as disappointing in California Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. play this season as Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and no Mustang player has 
struggled more than Matt Drake. 
</P>
<P>
So it was fitting that Drake should be the one to lead the team out of the 
doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
Drake, who came into the game batting .178, hit for the cycle and drove in six 
runs to spark a 17-hit attack as the Mustangs rolled to a 17-10 victory over 
Cal State Northridge at San Luis Obispo Stadium on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Man for man, pound for pound, we're as good as anyone in the CCAA," said 
Drake, one of five starters who returned from last year's NCAA Division II 
champion. "I don't think anyone would argue that. But we just haven't played to 
our ability this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we thought things were going to be too easy for us." 
</P>
<P>
San Luis Obispo improved to 21-27 and 12-14 in conference play. CSUN dropped to 
31-18, 18-8. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN started the day tied with UC Riverside for the conference lead but slipped 
a half-game back. The Highlanders beat Cal State Los Angeles, 11-8, in a game 
that had been suspended Friday because of a problem with the lights, then lost 
Saturday's regularly scheduled game, 5-4, falling to 36-16 and 20-9. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was doubly bad for Northridge as center fielder Greg Shockey left the 
game in the eighth inning because of an injured right shoulder. Shockey, who 
was five for eight in the first two games of the three-game series, which ends 
today, slid headfirst into the outfield wall after diving in vain for a line 
drive off the bat of former Saugus High standout Jared Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge starter Scott Sharts, who gave up nine runs and eight hits in 3 2/3 
innings, did not pitch poorly in the first two innings but found himself 
trailing, 5-2, after two Northridge errors led to four unearned runs in the 
second. 
</P>
<P>
With one out and a runner on first, Phil James hit an apparent double-play ball 
to shortstop Mike Solar, who booted it to put runners at first and second. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Rucker followed with a run-scoring single to tie the score, 2-2, and 
after Sharts struck out Pat Kirby, Doug Noce blooped a single to right field 
that scored James and moved Rucker to third. 
</P>
<P>
Right fielder Eric Johnson then dropped Sean Harper's pop fly, allowing Rucker 
to score, and Drake followed with a single that drove in Noce. 
</P>
<P>
San Luis Obispo chased Sharts in the fourth, scoring four times on five hits, 
including a run-scoring double by Drake and a two-run homer by Bill Daly. 
</P>
<P>
Denny Vigo was three for four with two home runs (his 17th and 18th) and five 
RBIs for Northridge.

SOCCER'S L.A. HEAT COOLS OFF THE EMPERORS, 1-0

<P>
On the hottest day of the year, a pair of former South Bay soccer teammates put 
on a stifling defensive display here Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Littman, formerly of El Camino College, and Chris Wilson, last year's 
goalie at Cal State Dominguez Hills, put on torrid exhibitions in goal-tending 
for their respective American Professional Soccer League teams at Ted Runner 
Stadium before the Los Angeles Heat defeated the California Emperors, 1-0, in 
overtime before 3,546 spectators. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, of the host Emperors, gave a steady performance, stopping five shots in 
regulation and four in overtime before getting beaten by forward Bobby Brook's 
game-winner one minute into the second overtime. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the Heat's Littman, whose job is rumored to be in jeopardy, who was 
the crowd-pleaser. The 21-year-old former all-state player from El Camino also 
stopped five shots in regulation and provided some booming punts that helped 
hold the Emperor offense in check for all but the final eight minutes of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Both players formerly played on the Torrance United team under Heat Coach Bobby 
Sibbald. 
</P>
<P>
Littman paid for his heroics with a couple of body-crunching stops, both 
against speedy Emperor left wing Mahnutie Reeves. Finally, he survived a 
last-gap offensive thrust from the Emperors after Brook's goal. 
</P>
<P>
The APSL is just getting into the meat of its schedule, and many of the team 
rosters are not set yet. Littman may have used the Heat's third game of the 
year to build a case for himself. 
</P>
<P>
His second consecutive shutout came at an opportune time. Heat management is 
known to be coveting Olympic goalie David Vanole, whose picture has even been 
put into the Heat media guide. However, Vanole appears to be headed back to the 
U.S. National Team. 
</P>
<P>
The Heat also signed Cal State Dominguez Hills soccer Coach Marine Cano earlier 
in the week. Cano, 35, a former professional goalie, is expected to be 
activated later this week. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson is among Cano's proteges. Another half-dozen players once affiliated 
with Dominguez Hills are playing or expected to sign before the season ends. 
That includes U.S. National Team player and Cano assistant Paul Krumpe, who 
signed late last week to play with Real Santa Barbara when his World Cup 
commitment ends.

<P>
BOTTOM LINE ON NORTHRIDGE SOFTBALL COACH TORGESON: HE HATES TO LOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His teams have won in all manner of ways, accounting for more victories in the 
past decade than any other NCAA Division II softball ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
And, in the process, Coach Gary Torgeson of Cal State Northridge has drawn more 
than his share of critics. 
</P>
<P>
Success breeds success. It also can breed contempt. Torgeson has experienced 
both. 
</P>
<P>
There are those who say his teams are too brash, too demonstrative. Or that he 
is too intense, too singularly focused. They say winning has become his 
obsession. 
</P>
<P>
Torgeson wholeheartedly agrees. 
</P>
<P>
He tried being a good loser once -- it just didn't work out. 
</P>
<P>
Before taking over the softball program in 1982, Torgeson compiled an 8-24-1 
record in three seasons as CSUN's football coach. 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, he was fired. 
</P>
<P>
Torgeson said he tried both eating and drinking his way through the miserable 
months that followed. Neither worked. Then came the opportunity to again be a 
head coach. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that the intricacies of football and softball are not even remotely 
intertwined. They became intertwined. With Torgeson as coach, some of the same 
elements apply. 
</P>
<P>
Intimidation, for one. Torgeson can be credited with all but changing 
Northridge's school colors from basic red and white to black with red and white 
trim. 
</P>
<P>
Why? "Because adding black to the colors adds a little mystique," Torgeson 
says. "You look tougher in black. The girls love wearing it." 
</P>
<P>
Not just any girls. His girls. Those who have braved the inch-thick playbook, 
daylong practices and psychological warfare that go with the territory when one 
plays softball for the Lady Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
Their coach is honest. And blunt. 
</P>
<P>
Early this season, Christy Alves, one-time star pitcher at Burbank Burroughs 
High, approached Torgeson because she was thinking of quitting the team. 
</P>
<P>
Handling the uncomfortable confrontation with his own brand of diplomacy, 
Torgeson told her, "I've lost confidence in you." 
</P>
<P>
End of conversation. End of Alves' career. 
</P>
<P>
Torgeson is not intentionally cruel, but sometimes his drive to succeed can 
make him painfully shortsighted. 
</P>
<P>
Comfortably ahead during a tournament game last season, CSUN continued to 
pinwheel runners around the bases using the hit and run. Later, after taking a 
ribbing from other coaches who watched the game, one of Torgeson's assistants, 
swallowing hard, mentioned that perhaps it wasn't wise to run up the score. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I'm not out to embarrass anybody," Torgeson said, stern-faced. "But we've 
got to practice some things under game conditions." 
</P>
<P>
If the other team wasn't ready, well, that was their problem. 
</P>
<P>
Torgeson once had a player whom he says emulated himself. Her name was Barbara 
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, now a CSUN assistant, was a mercurial player who talked trash, batted 
.400, berated umpires, flung helmets and caught everything hit in the air 
within her ZIP code. She was a three-time All-American as a center fielder -- 
arguably the best, and unquestionably the most feared and hated player in 
Division II softball. 
</P>
<P>
When Torgeson talks about Jordan, he could just as easily be talking about 
himself. To a fault, the ultimate competitor. 
</P>
<P>
"She was out of control sometimes, but yet she was under control," Torgeson 
says somewhat wistfully. "She was a workaholic. She was intense. She was 
emotional. She loved the team. No detail was too small for her to perfect. She 
looked at videotape. She was a student. She was totally oblivious to everything 
that was going on except the game. Totally focused. 
</P>
<P>
"Barbara's whole life was softball and she would not let anything get in the 
way of her playing. And she let everyone know about it . . . and if they didn't 
respond to her, she'd kick 'em in the butt. She didn't care what they thought 
of her. . . . She didn't have many people like her, we're probably in the same 
mold that way. But I loved her." 
</P>
<P>
One would think that after 450 victories and four national championships some 
of Torgeson's passion for winning would have subsided. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, the opposite is true. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect it," Torgeson says of winning. "It's unfortunate. My wife tells me 
all the time, 'You've won four national championships. Why can't you be content 
with that?' 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know. I just can't. I always want to win it again next year." 
</P>
<P>
The phone rang in the softball field house the other day and Torgeson answered 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"You sitting on the phone?" the caller inquired. 
</P>
<P>
"Just waiting for the call from Sacramento about the lottery," Torgeson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you win?" the caller asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Nah, I don't even play," Torgeson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Why not?" he was asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Because I can't stand to lose," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two-liners: Jeff deLaveaga of Cal Lutheran averaged 26.9 points a game to 
finish second in scoring among NCAA Division II basketball players, yet when it 
came time for awards, Coach Mike Dunlap chose not to honor the sophomore as the 
team's most valuable player. Instead, deLaveaga was recognized as the 
"hardest-working" member of the squad. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Cathie Teobaldi of CSUN pulled a muscle in her right arm during the first round 
of last week's Ojai Valley Tennis tournament, forcing her to withdraw. She is 
expected to be back to full health when Northridge meets top-ranked Cal Poly 
Pomona today in the first round of the Division II championships. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Times recently ran a feature on Valley College sophomore second baseman E. 
J. Pape and in it noted that his parents had attended every one of his high 
school and junior college games. That afternoon, Pape played third while his 
parents were vacationing in Idaho.

<P>
EL CAMINO REAL BASEBALL TEAM STRIKINGLY SIMILAR TO '78 VERSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are more than a few similarities between this year's El Camino Real High 
baseball team and the Conquistadores of 1978, the last year in which the school 
won a West Valley League title. 
</P>
<P>
As did its predecessor, this season's team employs a potent righty-lefty 
combination. In 1978, the right-hander was Doug McKenzie, an All-American at 
Cal State Northridge in 1982. The left-hander was Dave Walsh, who played at UC 
Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Treend, a right-hander who is 9-0 this season, is headed to Santa Barbara. 
Ryan McGuire, a left-hander with a 5-1 record, also plays first base, as did 
Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
There's more. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Davis, basketball coach at Canoga Park and a senior on the 1978 El Camino 
Real baseball team, calls the resemblance "kind of weird." 
</P>
<P>
The center fielder in '78 was Neal Marder, whom Davis calls a dead ringer for 
this year's starter, Jeff Marks. "Both were scrappy little guys who made diving 
catches and really hustled," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis was a right fielder and relief pitcher. Sean Boldt, this year's starter 
in right field, is the team's top reliever. 
</P>
<P>
The 1978 team was coached by John DiPonzio; the 1990 team by Mike Maio, both of 
Italian descent. 
</P>
<P>
The catcher in '78, Howard Dashefsky, received a scholarship to Hawaii. 
Dashefsky remained in Hawaii, went into broadcasting and is now the "Fred 
Roggin of Honolulu," Davis said. Bobby Kim, this year's starter, arguably is 
the best catcher among area City Section players. 
</P>
<P>
But there are some things that the 1990 team would rather not mirror. The 1978 
Conquistadores lost to Poly, 7-3, in the semifinals of the City playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"In the preseason, everybody had picked us and Granada Hills to make it to 
Dodger Stadium," Davis said. "We knew Poly was going to be pretty good, but 
they came in and beat us. 
</P>
<P>
"Poly's always tough, they never seem to let down. Jerry Cord's a great coach." 
</P>
<P>
Could it happen again? Poly, unbeaten this season in Valley Pac-8 Conference 
play, is 20-3 overall and has won 18 of its past 19 games. 
</P>
<P>
The 4-A Division playoff seedings will be made next week. 
</P>
<P>
Add 1978: Granada Hills fulfilled its end of the deal. In the 1978 City final, 
the Highlanders snapped Poly's 21-game win streak with a 4-2 win. 
</P>
<P>
Nine Granada Hills players, including a junior named John Elway, eventually 
would play baseball professionally or in college. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What do catchers Rick Dempsey of the Dodgers and Kevin Walsh of 
Crespi have in common? 
</P>
<P>
Tummy ache: He's giving opposing pitchers Ratanatraiphobia. Coaches are 
overdosing on Tums. 
</P>
<P>
Highland Hall's Tum Ratanatraiphob, who emigrated from Thailand in the third 
grade, stole his 40th base Thursday, breaking the school record of 39 that he 
set last season. With two regular-season games remaining, the Hawks (21-2, 7-0) 
have clinched their fourth consecutive Westside League title. 
</P>
<P>
Ratanatraiphob, a sophomore, is an all-league second baseman who is batting 
.452 and has been on base in all 23 games. He had not played organized baseball 
before last season and didn't plan to play at Highland Hall. 
</P>
<P>
But Coach Dave Desmond hounded him to try out for the team last year. 
</P>
<P>
"He gets on first base and we're going to send him," Desmond said. "It's no 
secret. Coaches will scream from the dugout, 'You know he's going!' " 
</P>
<P>
Name game: No matter how many extra-base hits another baseball team might 
accumulate, Highland Hall likely will win the area doubles title. 
</P>
<P>
Doubles, as in first and last names that begin with the same letter. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Ramirez, Josh Johansen, Jakob Jensen, Tommy Tominaga, and Rath 
(nicknamed Tum) Ratanatraiphob all play for Highland Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Both have hit home runs in Crespi games this season. Dempsey, a 
Crespi graduate, homered in the alumni game in February. Walsh hit the Celts' 
only home run of the regular season two weeks ago against Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
Respectable replacements: In the absence of Kevin Tate, Richard Dice and Steve 
Roe, who are academically ineligible, and Kirk Fellows, who is out with 
chickenpox, Alemany Coach Jim Ozella has turned to his younger players. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Bushey and Rob Nary, both freshman pitchers, have been promoted from the 
junior varsity. Bushey is batting .250 and is 1-1 on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
Nary, who has pitched 11 innings, has allowed just one earned run and one walk.

TIME TO SEE WHAT BOBBY HAS BUILT; 
</P>
<P>
CHARGERS: MINI-CAMP BEGINS TODAY, GIVING COACH DAN HENNING AND HIS STAFF A 
CHANCE TO EVALUATE A TEAM THAT HAS BEEN CHANGED A BIT SINCE LAST SEASON.

<P>
About 90 faces will greet Charger Coach Dan Henning and his staff today when 
the team opens its six-day mini-camp. Some of them, he will even recognize. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty players have been traded, been released, retired or left the team 
through free agency since the end of last season. Only 39 players eligible to 
attend the camp were on the team's active or reserve lists at the end of last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Player turnover is a natural part of NFL life. But it is a particularly active 
element when a team finishes 6-10, fires its general manager and replaces him 
with one generally acknowledged as among the most innovative in the NFL. Bobby 
Beathard has brought much of the change. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those who have left were far from household names. But some should 
sound familiar: running back Gary Anderson and wide receiver Jamie Holland 
(traded), offensive tackle Jim FitzPatrick (Plan B free agent), center Don 
Macek (retired) and quarterback Jim McMahon (released). 
</P>
<P>
They and the others have been replaced from a variety of sources by Beathard. 
These include 17 via the team's largest draft class since 1986, nine through 
Plan B free agency and at least 22 through other free agency. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all are expected to participate when the team holds its first of 11 
mini-camp workouts at 4 p.m. today at its practice facility at San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium. The workouts will continue with double sessions Monday through 
Friday beginning at 10:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. each day. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our chance to get a better look at the rookies and some of the other 
new players," Beathard said Friday. "It's just the next step in the evaluation 
process." 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said that only a handful of players have been excused for medical or 
personal reasons. These included linebacker Cedric Figaro and wide receiver 
Walter Wilson, both of whom are attending to college commitments, and offensive 
linemen Mike Simmonds (knee) and Larry Williams (shoulder), who are recovering 
from injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said he was not aware of any player who would not attend the sessions 
because of contract troubles as the agent for McMahon, Steve Zucker, said his 
client would have done before he was released last week. 
</P>
<P>
With McMahon gone, the quarterback role rests solidly with Billy Joe Tolliver, 
who started the final four games of his rookie season last year. But other 
offensive questions remain to be answered, starting with the offensive line and 
running backs. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers have added three Plan B free agents -- Ronnie Harmon from Buffalo, 
Joe Mickles from Washington and Thomas Sanders from Chicago -- to go along with 
three holdover running backs. Chief among the returners is Marion Butts, who 
led the Chargers as a rookie last season with 683 yards on 170 carries. 
</P>
<P>
The offensive line situation could be just as unsettled. Almost no one outside 
of center Courtney Hall and likely left tackle Joel Patton appears assured of 
starting or playing the same position as last year. Guards David Richards and 
Broderick Thomas both might be tried at tackle. Dennis McKnight, after 
experimenting at center before a preseason knee injury ended his season before 
the first game last year, will be tried at left guard. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just a checkpoint for us," Beathard said. "The work we do now will 
make it easier for us to get started when training camp opens in July."

DAVE DISTEL: ATHLETES FROM ESTONIA HOPE TO MAKE MOST OF DAYS IN THE SUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Having dealt with Soviet athletes on a number of occasions in the past, I was 
accustomed to finding them accompanied by mysterious characters with no 
discernable functions. 
</P>
<P>
It would not be an over-simplification to say they looked to be guys out of 
Ludlum novels. 
</P>
<P>
It did not require a doctorate in international relations to figure out which 
branch of the Soviet bureaucracy employed these chaps. 
</P>
<P>
The athletes themselves, speaking through interpreters, were always 
tight-lipped and cautious. It was either that, or the interpreters were saying 
what they wanted to be said rather than what the athletes wanted to say. 
</P>
<P>
Times have changed. 
</P>
<P>
A group of six athletes from the Soviet Union was in town this week to train 
and participate in a track meet at UC San Diego Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Wait a minute. I need to make a correction here. 
</P>
<P>
A group of six athletes from Estonia was in town this week. Estonia is, of 
course, a part of the USSR, but these are times when an Estonian can declare 
pride in being what he is rather than what was imposed upon him (or his 
ancestors) 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, these people were all in San Diego without permission. That may sound 
daring, but it isn't. They don't need permission any more. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, they can speak their mind. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Marek Kaleta is a 28-year-old javelin thrower with a dream he no 
longer has to keep to himself. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking through Anu Purken, an interpreter in a sun dress rather than a trench 
coat, Kaleta talked of going to Barcelona for the 1992 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"It will depend on politics, because things are changing every day," he said, 
"but it would be great to compete with our own team. I'd like to compete under 
our national flag . . . blue, black and white. This is my dream." 
</P>
<P>
Estonia has not competed under its own flag, but rather the Soviet flag, since 
the 1936 Olympics. It was swallowed by the Soviet Union in 1940, occupied by 
Germany from July, 1941, until September, 1944, and then absorbed once again by 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"Little nations," Purken said, "are like toys to the big countries." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, she is hopeful Estonia doesn't become a pawn for international 
gamesmanship in its quest for independence. For one thing, Estonia is going 
about it a little more diplomatically than Lithuania did. 
</P>
<P>
"We are striving for independence," she said, "but we're trying to do it with 
negotiation with Moscow and our government. We don't want to just declare our 
independence like Lithuania did. We're too small a nation and, economically, we 
are so bound to the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
Athletically, Estonia can stand on its own. The biggest sports, Purken said, 
are basketball, soccer, track and field and yachting. Estonians won medals in 
cycling, yachting, track and field, fencing, skiing and basketball in the 1988 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
But being able to stand on its own and being allowed to stand on its own are 
not necessarily one and the same. Estonia's Olympic committee, while never 
disbanded, has been a bit inactive of late. It is currently negotiating with 
the International Olympic Committee as well as the Soviet Olympic committee. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope very much the Soviet Union Olympic committee will approve our Olympic 
team," Purken said. 
</P>
<P>
Quite likely, all these moves for independence will be intertwined. 
</P>
<P>
What the Estonians have now is enough freedom to give them a taste of what it 
might be like to be independent. 
</P>
<P>
Could this group have come on its own to San Diego as recently as two years 
ago? 
</P>
<P>
"No," Purken said, "by no means. The great changes began in 1988. Since then, 
things are improving all the time. We have direct contact with other countries 
and other sports clubs and that would have been impossible before. We can now 
travel freely and talk freely, and that would have been unbelievable a couple 
of years ago." 
</P>
<P>
So here they were on the track at UCSD on a sunny Friday. They had been to the 
San Diego Zoo and they had been to the beach, and the Estonian winter was in 
another world . . . just as Estonia itself seems to be entering another era if 
not another world. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very impressed with San Diego," Marek Kaleta said. "The conditions are 
so excellent here." 
</P>
<P>
In their own way, as visitors, these people were as refreshing to me as the San 
Diego weather was to them. If they are representative of the new spirit and 
attitude in Eastern Europe, I suspect maybe I won't see another trench coat 
outside of a Pink Panther movie.

USD FORFEITS GAMES IN BRAWL AFTERMATH; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASEBALL: TWO COACHES, TWO PLAYERS SUSPENDED AFTER FRIDAY NIGHT'S 
FIGHT.

<P>
Three scheduled baseball games between the University of San Diego and Nevada 
Reno will not be played, and two coaches and two players have been suspended 
after Friday's five-minute, bench-clearing brawl during a game in Reno. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from both West Coast Conference schools decided late Friday to cancel 
completion of that game, and USD elected to forfeit a scheduled doubleheader 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The fight, which began with a hard slide and then retaliation, appears to have 
been a carry-over from an incident in the teams' first meeting in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Base umpire Jim Lenau said Friday's trouble began in the fifth inning with Reno 
leading, 3-1, when USD freshman Chad Boyd dove back to first on a pickoff 
attempt and was tagged hard on the back by junior first baseman John DeRicco. 
</P>
<P>
Lenau said both players were given a warning. The pitcher immediately attempted 
another pickoff, and Boyd collided with DeRicco while diving back. DeRicco then 
shoved Boyd. 
</P>
<P>
Both benches cleared and players from both sides began fighting. A few 
spectators later got into a fight, but none went on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the worst fight I've seen in college baseball in 20 years of 
officiating," said Lenau, who is supervisor of officials for the Sacramento 
Assn. of Collegiate Officials. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from cuts and bruises, no one was seriously injured. The umpires 
postponed the game after order was restored and later said that Boyd, DeRicco, 
Reno Coach Gary Powers and Jake Molina, a USD assistant, had been ejected. 
</P>
<P>
Don Ott, assistant commissioner of the WCC, said that Powers and Molina are 
suspended indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd will miss Tuesday's game with San Diego State and at least Friday's WCC 
game with Pepperdine. DeRicco will miss at least a WCC game Friday against St. 
Mary's. Ott said suspensions of at least a game are mandatory under NCAA and 
WCC rules but can be extended. 
</P>
<P>
Ott said the incident is under review by WCC Commissioner Michael Gilleran, who 
is waiting for more information. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides feared trouble before the series. USD Coach John Cunningham 
expressed his concern to the WCC office, and Reno added extra security. 
Gilleran and Ott had made plans before Friday's incident to fly in for 
Saturday's games and did so, only to find that USD had decided to forfeit them. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on the intensity of the fight, less than than 24 hours was not enough 
time to cool down," said Tom Iannacone, USD athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
Said Ott: "The key reason we wanted them to play was to redeem themselves, to 
give them a chance to rise above the embarrassment they've brought upon 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham chose to say little about the incident Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are serious enough that I'm not going to make any comments until things 
are handled by our athletic director and the conference," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When the two teams met in San Diego in early March, Boyd and DeRicco were 
involved in a similar incident but in reversed roles. DeRicco, attempting to 
break up a double play at second, was struck in the face by second baseman 
Boyd's relay throw. Both benches cleared, but there was no fight. 
</P>
<P>
Joe DeRicco, Reno's third base coach and John's brother, was ejected from that 
game. John DeRicco, an All-WCC selection in 1989, had surgery to repair six 
broken bones in his cheek and was out for a month. 
</P>
<P>
USD was 15-15 (23-29 overall) and tied for third in the WCC entering Friday. 
Reno was 8-12 (26-20) and in sixth. The lost games would not have affected the 
WCC championship or postseason consideration for either team.

VENICE REMAINS HAUNTED BY THE BEAUTY AND ROMANCE OF ITS PAST, DESPITE TOURISTS, 
POLLUTANTS AND RISING TIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When a letter arrived the other day from a friend in Venice, I was reminded of 
Ernest Hemingway and Harry Pickering and Giuseppe Cipriani, individual threads 
in the tapestry of that waterlogged city that miraculously survives the 
vicissitudes of flood tides, hordes of summer tourists and pollutants swept in 
by tides and winds. 
</P>
<P>
One particular summer several years ago I stopped by Harry's Bar, which was 
Hemingway's favorite watering hole, and having just listened to the hum of 
vaporettos plying the Grand Canal and the notes of a violin rising from Piazza 
San Marco, it occurred to me what a tragedy it is to be alone in this 
enchanting city. 
</P>
<P>
This seemed especially true on a summer night when ancient buildings along the 
Grand Canal are bathed in moonlight and gondoliers sing their arias to couples 
caught up by the wonders of Venice: The dome of Santa Maria Della Saute, the 
15th-Century clock tower on St. Mark's Square, the handsome Gothic Campanile, 
the Doges Palace and the Basilica San Marco. 
</P>
<P>
No matter that frequently during the high season it is impossible to secure a 
room, even in a humble pension, Venice continues to play to an audience lured 
by its Byzantine beauty and romance. Gondolas sail beneath the "Bridge of 
Sighs" where couples kiss in a ritual that Venetians insist seals love forever. 
</P>
<P>
And so, indeed, this labyrinth of bridges and canals, palaces and piazzas 
should be shared, particularly Piazza San Marco, where couples sip Campari and 
soda while musicians grind out love songs and the clock tower sounds the hour. 
</P>
<P>
My late friend John Squire met a woman one afternoon near the Rialto, and the 
magic of the city overcame the two of them. During the next several days they 
spent a lifetime together: Marveling at the sunlight on the Grand Canal, 
feeding the pigeons in St. Mark's Square and sipping Champagne on the terrace 
of the Gritti Palace. Venice had cast its spell. 
</P>
<P>
One evening Squire hired a gondola and later, after a pit stop at Harry's, he 
sang opera in St. Mark's Square to this woman who had come into his life so 
unexpectedly. The moment was precious but, well, every episode has its ending; 
personal commitments dictated that they part. And so one afternoon the woman 
returned to Munich and Squire returned to New York City. Although they never 
saw one another again, the memory remained with Squire to the very end. 
</P>
<P>
The magic that is Venice is not easily forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
And so one should not go alone to Venice. Queen Elizabeth arrived with Prince 
Philip; Cary Grant was seen with an exotic beauty and there were the 
Hemingways, Ernest and Mary. 
</P>
<P>
While Hemingway enjoyed Piazza San Marco, he loved Harry's Bar. It was only 
natural that he would, of course, for Harry's pours the best drink in Venice 
and turns out wonderful meals. So Hemingway made it his unofficial headquarters 
whenever he was in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
It is not by accident that Harry's is known to legions of visitors. Cipriani 
struggled to make it special to all who dine and drink there. In the late '20s, 
when Cipriani was a bartender at the old Hotel Europa, there was an American, 
Harry Pickering, who enjoyed the drinks that Cipriani poured. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Pickering was pickled an enormous share of the time. Later, when 
Pickering's aunt left him in Venice, Cipriani took pity on Pickering and lent 
him money. Pickering went on a binge and then one day he disappeared, 
resurfacing several months later to repay Cipriani. 
</P>
<P>
As an additional gesture of gratitude, Pickering lent Cipriani the cash with 
which to buy his own bar. In return, Cipriani named the bar after Harry 
Pickering. 
</P>
<P>
It has been Harry's ever since. 
</P>
<P>
With his debt repaid, Pickering disappeared a final time. Later, when Cipriani 
died, Cipriani's son, Arrigo, took over the popular watering hole. 
</P>
<P>
Harry's creates its own pastas and breads and desserts and homemade ice cream 
and the most delicious chocolate cake in Italy. Harry's also pours one of the 
world's driest martinis (10 parts gin or vodka to one part vermouth). 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when Cipriani served royalty regularly. Even today, a duke or 
a princess or perhaps a deposed king will drop by on occasion. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Harry's bartenders mix hundreds of drinks each day, the favorite 
being the house drink, the Bellini, a combination of fresh peach juice and 
Champagne. 
</P>
<P>
Legions of travelers have made Harry's their hangout since 1931. It has 
attracted hordes of hungry, thirsty vacationers and Venetians, as well as such 
celebrities as Rex Harrison, John Steinbeck, Noel Coward, Prince Rainier, 
Charlie Chaplin and Somerset Maugham. 
</P>
<P>
The list is long. 
</P>
<P>
Harry's holds forth in its original location on the Grand Canal, just steps 
from a vaporetto stop. 
</P>
<P>
Guests line up at the bar, and meals are served upstairs as well as on the 
ground level. For sentimental reasons, a caricature of Harry Pickering hangs 
near the entrance on Calle Vallaresso, a tribute to the man who bankrolled 
Cipriani. On the same wall is a photo of Cipriani with Ernest Hemingway. 
</P>
<P>
Hemingway and the late Cipriani struck up a lasting friendship that brought 
still more fame to Harry's, what with Hemingway spending many hours at the bar 
and the tourists begging for his autograph, or competing for the opportunity to 
occupy Papa's favorite stool. 
</P>
<P>
On other occasions, Hemingway and Cipriani traveled together to Torcello, an 
island that's reached by speedboat from St. Mark's Square. 
</P>
<P>
Cipriani went to Torcello in 1936 to establish a restaurant with guest rooms 
upstairs. It was on Torcello, at Cipriani's inn, that Hemingway worked on 
"Across the River and Into the Trees." 
</P>
<P>
The population of Torcello was small, fewer than 100 people. So Hemingway was 
at peace at Locanda Cipriani, this inn where he drank and wrote and played 
cards, a peaceful plot surrounded by grape arbors and a garden ablaze with 
flowers. 
</P>
<P>
The dining room at Locanda Cipriani receives raves from visitors who travel to 
Torcello merely to dine, returning later to Venice. Others take tables at a 
rival restaurant, Ostaria al Ponte del Diavolo, whose casual atmosphere is 
appealing. 
</P>
<P>
Hemingway took up residency on Torcello more than 40 years ago, during the 
winter of '48, and the desk where he wrote remains in the same room that he 
occupied at Cipriani's. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its peacefulness, Hemingway remained on Torcello for weeks. During 
this period he established a ritual: In the morning he would write and in the 
afternoon he would hunt with the inn's gardener, Emilio, or visit with the 
parish priest, Don Francesco Taglipietra. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Harry's and Locanda Cipriani, Hemingway enjoyed the Gritti Palace, the 
famed hotel on Venice's Grand Canal. 
</P>
<P>
The 15th-Century Gritti Palace has attracted dozens of celebrities: Charles de 
Gaulle, Elizabeth Taylor, the Duke and Dutchess of Windsor, Princess Grace, 
Queen Elizabeth, Winston Churchill, Claire Boothe Luce, Sinclair Lewis, Ava 
Gardner, Clark Gable, Laurance Rockefeller and Greta Garbo. 
</P>
<P>
Maugham, who loved Venice and the Gritti, wrote: "At the Gritti, you are not 
merely a number as you are in those vast caravansaries that appear all over the 
world; you are a friend who has been welcomed as you step out of the motorboat, 
and when you sit down to dinner at the very same table you sat at the year 
before and the year before that, when you see that your bottle of Soave is in 
the same ice pail waiting for you, as it has been year after year, you cannot 
but feel very much at home." 
</P>
<P>
For those searching for less expensive shelter, my vote goes to the cheerful 
little Hotel Patria Tre Rose, on Calle dei Fabbri, as well as another close to 
St. Mark's, the Casanova. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving the Patria Tre Rose one evening, I struck out for a small family 
restaurant I'd enjoyed earlier and became lost in a crowd that had gathered for 
a fireworks display on the Grand Canal. 
</P>
<P>
Exploding skyrockets were reflected in the canal like a watery rainbow. Sparks 
showered down while the crowd applauded, and other fireworks roared off into 
the night from handsome yachts facing the Danieli Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Later I found the restaurant I was searching for, and in a courtyard nearby a 
young woman with braids was playing Venetian love songs on a mandolin to the 
crowd that was leaving the fireworks show. A lad with a fine tenor voice joined 
her and together they sang until the moon had disappeared and the clock tower 
in St. Mark's Square sounded midnight. 
</P>
<P>
While Venice is inviting, it can be trying at times. On a summer day as many as 
30,000 visitors arrive. At the height of the winter carnival in February, more 
than 200,000 -- or twice the number of permanent residents -- jam the city, 
which inspired one Venetian to grumble that Venice will sink one day, not due 
to flooding but under the weight of these invaders. They crowd the vaporettos 
and gondolas and swarm over the Rialto and the Bridge of Sighs. 
</P>
<P>
Poor Venice. 
</P>
<P>
Residents complain that vibrations from rock concerts in Piazza San Marco are 
damaging delicate mosaics in the piazza's magnificent cathedral. And still, 
said a spokesman for the Italian Government Travel Office, they've not been 
outlawed. 
</P>
<P>
If Venice is seduced by tourists during summer, in winter it is ravaged by 
floods. Only inches above sea level, the city is often inundated by tides 
several feet high. And so for years, responsible citizens have struggled to 
preserve the palaces and other buildings on Venice's 100-odd islands. 
</P>
<P>
Artisans spent 15 years and billions of lire refurbishing the Ca' d'Oro, one of 
those lovely palaces on the Grand Canal. 
</P>
<P>
Dating from 1420, the building is considered as much a treasure as the 
treasures it contains: Priceless paintings, mosaics, ancient bronze figures and 
tapestries. Additional billions of lire have been spent restoring bell towers, 
churches and museums. 
</P>
<P>
In the high season, Venetians live under constant pressure. Often when they get 
stressed out they escape north to Cortina d'Ampezzo, the little Alpine village 
in the Dolomites. 
</P>
<P>
Set in one of Italy's loveliest valleys, Cortina lies beneath peaks lost in the 
folds of great billowing clouds, its mountains separating Italy from Austria. 
For Venetians who live surrounded by water, Cortina, with its wildflowers and 
grassy meadows, offers relief. 
</P>
<P>
Waterfalls spill, swelling rivers and lakes, and in the golden time of summer 
the high meadows are yellow with buttercups and blue with forget-me-nots and 
columbine. 
</P>
<P>
With the arrival of fall, cattle are returned to the village from the high 
slopes, the signal for another of Cortina's festivals that attract great crowds 
of Venetians. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists as well as Venetians applaud Cortina's campaign to discourage 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Venetians, the residents of Cortina were aware of threats to the 
environment long before others voiced fears over polluted air and water and 
overcrowded land. It is sobering for Venetians, the contrast between the 
pristine valley of Cortina and the polluted canals of home. 
</P>
<P>
Still, while Cortina is fine for a holiday, legions of travelers -- I among 
them -- prefer the treasures of Venice. Yes, even with the decaying buildings, 
murky canals and oppressive summer heat. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, on a muggy day the beaches of Lido Isle are only minutes away. Those 
who can afford the heavy ransom take shelter on the island of Giudecca at Hotel 
Cipriani, which is blessed with a swimming pool and breezes that sweep away the 
humid air. 
</P>
<P>
The next time I return to Venice, take a table again at Harry's and listen to 
the vaporettos and the music that rises from St. Mark's Square, I shall again 
raise my glass to the ghosts of Hemingway and Maugham and my late friend John 
Squire -- and the other departed souls who shall never again know the serenity 
of a sunset along the Grand Canal.

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: IF YOU HAVE THE MONEY, THEY HAVE THE RENTAL CAR; 
</P>
<P>
AUTOMOBILES: RENTING A CAR CAN BE MORE FUN THAN EVER THESE DAYS, WITH AN 
EXPANDING CHOICE THAT INCLUDES MERCEDES-BENZES, PORSCHES AND EVEN ROLLS-ROYCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tired of the same compact car each time you need to rent an automobile on a 
trip? If you're willing to pay the extra tariff, the business of renting a car 
is getting to be a little more fun. 
</P>
<P>
All across the country, rental fleets are being upgraded. Luxury cars and 
exotic sports cars are being offered at more and more outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Budget Rent-A-Car has a luxury line of automobiles available at locations in 
Los Angeles, Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Hawaii, Miami, New Orleans, 
Phoenix and Washington. Cars include the BMW, Corvette, Jaguar, Ferrari, 
Rolls-Royce, Mercedes, Porsche, Toyota Supra, Mustang convertible, Mercedes 
Benz 190, Porsche 944 and Mazda Miata. 
</P>
<P>
Budget's midweek rate, Monday through Friday, for many of these cars is $99 a 
day. The Beverly Hills-based company's "Drive A Dream" fleet of cars includes 
Ferraris and a complete line of Mercedeses and Rolls-Royces. 
</P>
<P>
High-end vehicles like the 1990 Mercedes 500 SL rent for $395 a day. Ferraris 
start at $500 a day, same as a Rolls-Royce Corniche convertible. But the 
convertible Suzuki four-wheel-drive rents for $49.95, and the Mazda Miati is 
$79. 
</P>
<P>
Many special services are available upon request -- from pickup and delivery to 
car phones and other services. 
</P>
<P>
So who drives these cars? "Everyone from Aunt Rose and Uncle Sid to top-name 
rock-and-roll stars," says Ken Kerzner, Budget's president and chief operating 
officer. "People come here to express themselves, and to drive a dream. They 
park their Chevy and see Hollywood like the stars." 
</P>
<P>
In a city where style often rates a higher priority than substance, Kerzner's 
expensive rental cars do very well. "People are either coming to drive a car as 
a status symbol," he says, "or to wave their hair in the wind and get closer to 
the California life style." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes it can be the reverse. Diane Keaton comes to Kerzner's place to rent 
a VW Rabbit "so she won't stand out." 
</P>
<P>
But other celebrities who seem to go for flashier rental transportation include 
Warren Beatty, Michael Jackson and Diana Ross. 
</P>
<P>
One word of caution: As you might suspect, there can be some hefty mileage and 
insurance charges for some of these cars. For Budget's luxury fleet you get 50 
miles a day free. It's 25 to 50 cents a mile thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
National Car Rental has a special luxury fleet: American classic cars from the 
1950s and '60s. You can find "California Classics" at its Los Angeles 
International Airport location and "Florida Fun Wheels" at four locations in 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago National hired a special car buyer who traveled throughout the 
United States for months. He attended car auctions, spoke with dealers and even 
put notes on windshields of individual cars he saw on the road. Thus National 
began assembling its fleet. 
</P>
<P>
The rates for these cars are surprisingly reasonable: $49 a day and 30 cents a 
mile. There's a small catch: You can only rent one if you are a member of 
National's Emerald Club, the company's frequent renter program. (It's not hard 
to join; a one-year membership costs $60 and includes lots of discount and 
upgrade certificates.) 
</P>
<P>
National rents the cars with the same collision-damage waivers and liability 
insurance provisions as its other cars. "These cars were so well-built," says 
National Vice President Michael Olsen, "that we've had few accidents where the 
old cars sustained damage. And most people treat these cars with kid gloves. We 
had one guy who rented a '57 Chevy to take to a wedding, and he polished it for 
three hours himself." 
</P>
<P>
For the time being you can forget about renting one of these cars -- or any 
other type of "exotic car" -- in cities such as Omaha, Neb., or Canton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
"We would never rent out a Rolls-Royce there," says Kerzner. "You need a place 
with a certain magic, and there are few places like Beverly Hills." 
</P>
<P>
At most Hertz locations, for example, about the most exotic cars you can rent 
are a Cadillac Coupe de Ville, Lexus, Lincoln Continental or Lincoln Town Car, 
each for $49.90. Among the selection of sports cars are the Pontiac Firebird, 
Chevy Camaro and Chevy Beretta. 
</P>
<P>
At Avis you can rent a Cadillac Coupe de Ville, Chrysler Le Baron Convertible, 
Chrysler New Yorker or Pontiac Sunbird convertible. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't mean the car you want is necessarily available. If you really 
want to rent one, call Avis and ask for the "special services" desk. 
</P>
<P>
If the company has a special vehicle available at another location they will 
transport the car, or a similar model, to the requested rental location. Of 
course, you should expect to pay whatever the company had to pay to transport 
the car there. 
</P>
<P>
At the airports in both Denver and Salt Lake City, renters can pick up Broncos 
and Toyota Forerunner trucks for $54.99 a day. 
</P>
<P>
At some locations, companies have tried renting "exotics" without much success. 
Last year Dollar Rent A Car in Hawaii began offering BMW convertibles but the 
program was soon canceled. The company couldn't make a profit -- even at higher 
rental rates -- because of the high cost of maintenance, insurance and repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Still, you can find some special cars to rent in Hawaii. You just have to be 
prepared to pay for them. Ferraris, Corvettes and other exotics are for rent in 
Honolulu. But rates can be as high as $300 a day (not including mileage and 
insurance). 
</P>
<P>
On the Big Island of Hawaii a company called Kona Convertibles will rent you a 
Camaro Iroc Z convertible for $125 a day, or a Corvette at $175 a day. At 
nearby Ciao Rentals you can get other convertibles -- there's the Mazda Miata 
($99 a day), Maserati ($225), Porsche 911 ($250) and, last but not least, a 
selection of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
Not every car-rental company is jumping on the exotic bandwagon. Alamo, the 
fourth-largest rental-car company in the United States, has stayed away from 
renting unusual cars. 
</P>
<P>
But in Southern California, luxury and exotic cars are fixtures on the road. If 
money is no object, you can rent anything from an amphibious landing craft to a 
Ferrari or Rolls-Royce. 
</P>
<P>
At Luxury Line Rent-A-Car in Beverly Hills, if they don't have the car you want 
to rent they go out and buy it for you. Luxury Line Rent-A-Car has offices in 
Los Angeles, Beverly Hills and at the Burbank Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Luxury Line's 700-car inventory includes a full line of Mercedeses, Rolls-Royce 
Corniche convertibles, Ferraris, Jaguars, BMWs and Porsches. "What sets us 
apart isn't so much the cars we rent," says owner Marc Fogel, "it's our 
willingness to go that extra mile." 
</P>
<P>
Fogel's not kidding. A few months back he received a call from a rock star, 
calling from an airplane. The singer would be in Los Angeles in five hours. He 
wanted two white vans for his equipment, a red Ferrari Testarossa for himself 
and a gray or black Rolls-Royce Corniche convertible for his manager. 
</P>
<P>
A further request: The Corniche had to have two cellular phones, a fax machine 
and a secretary. And all had to be delivered to the airport for his arrival at 
5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The vehicles were waiting when the star arrived. The bill for the five-hour 
rental: $5,000. "The funny thing," says Fogel, "is that the rock star chose to 
ride in the van. He never even used the Ferrari." 
</P>
<P>
But sometimes, when speed is essential, a rented Ferrari can truly make a 
difference. Not long ago a man and woman showed up at the Cresskill, N.J., 
offices of Roaring Roadsters, a rental company specializing in luxury cars. 
They rented a red Ferrari for two days. But when they returned the car, the 
manager noticed that the couple had logged more than 1,000 miles on the 
odometer. 
</P>
<P>
Where did they go? On a whim, the couple decided to get married, zoomed up to 
Niagara Falls for a quick ceremony and -- quite literally -- zoomed back.

FREEWHEELING ALONG THE TURKISH AEGEAN COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SELCUK, Turkey 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was my first night alone on the road in Asian Turkey, and long past 
dinnertime. But I was having more than hunger pangs. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen cafes lined a side street in this small village near the famed ruins of 
Ephesus, yet I wasn't sure what my reception would be at any of them. I had 
been cautioned that a lot of restaurants in Turkey's country towns function as 
male-only social clubs, and though there were a few women around, most of the 
patrons appeared to be local workingmen. 
</P>
<P>
I finally settled on a place where family groups occupied several tables topped 
with cheery checkered cloths. No sooner had I tentatively sat down than a boy 
of about 14 came over. In proud grade-school English he asked me to follow him 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
Why, I wondered, did they think I wouldn't want to dine under the stars like 
everyone else this lovely night? I hesitated, but the boy's smile was genuine 
and I was curious. So I trailed after him. 
</P>
<P>
At the door, two beaming men presented themselves with a flourish. One 
introduced himself as the "director," the other the chef, who shook my hand 
vigorously, led me through the kitchen past kettles of simmering daily specials 
and gestured that I should indicate my choice. My young escort then delivered 
me to a better outside table, verified my order and kept checking back to ask 
if I was content. 
</P>
<P>
With a tab totaling $2 for delicious roast chicken, potato, salad, wine, 
coffee, dessert and such a warm reception, I certainly was. 
</P>
<P>
This mealtime ritual was repeated again and again during the week I spent last 
summer driving nearly 2,000 miles along Turkey's Aegean and Mediterranean 
coasts. Everyone I met along the way, whether in crowded resort towns or at 
remote archeological sites, was helpful and gracious. 
</P>
<P>
Contributions to an exquisite tapestry of experiences included a handful of 
fresh figs spontaneously shared by students outside a rural museum, endless 
glasses of hot tea or cold lemonade offered by cordial shop owners and 
innumerable "chats" with tag-along children. The children wanted nothing more 
than to try their minimal English on a visitor from the land of Mickey Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
My drive offered ever-fascinating glimpses of the countryside and Turkey's 
changing culture: peasants riding donkeys and motorcycles; European tourists in 
bikinis picnicking at roadside rest areas next to Turkish women wrapped in 
veils; Elvis Presley beach towels draped over sacks of grain and potatoes in 
coastal village markets; centuries-old ruins alongside modern hotels in 
sophisticated seaside resorts of the Turkish Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
Driving in Turkey presented only one moment of unrest, but it occurred only 
because I'd mistakenly turned onto a back road en route to a popular beach 
resort. The pavement ended and the spiraling dirt track narrowed and became 
increasingly steeper. 
</P>
<P>
I was just about to abandon my rental car and walk back to civilization when a 
Jeepload of young Turks came by and asked if I was in trouble. They helped me 
turn the car around in a wide area just around the next bend, and assured me 
that I was unlikely to encounter another hair-raising route. I didn't. But 
driving in this mountainous region while trying to sightsee is not for the 
faint-hearted. 
</P>
<P>
Auto tourists also have to do a lot of backtracking -- there's often only one 
road in and out of a place. Still, main roads are well-maintained, good maps 
are available and gas stations are plentiful. Drivers are courteous, even those 
aboard the huge smoke-belching trucks, staying to the right as they inch uphill 
and signaling cars when it's safe to pass. The familiar international road 
signs are used everywhere, and though stop signs say DUR, they're at least red 
and hexagonal. 
</P>
<P>
Long-distance buses are modern and inexpensive, working out to something like 
$2 an hour for most journeys. A driver-guide can be cheaper than driving 
yourself, but with the distances that have to be covered, most tourists prefer 
the mobility afforded by having their own wheels. 
</P>
<P>
More compelling than the coastal resort towns, which have a certain sameness 
about them, are the scores of ancient ruins linked with such famous names as 
King Midas and Alexander the Great. At some, discarded pop-tops and drinking 
straws remind you of tour bus encroachments, but at other sites, notably 
Termessos, you are alone in time. 
</P>
<P>
Note that most archeological ruins call for climbing up steep rocky trails 
after a tedious drive. Some are best reached by boat. All are well marked on 
maps and road signs. 
</P>
<P>
The first major site on the route south is Ephesus, about 150 miles from Izmir. 
The most nearly complete ancient city ever excavated anywhere in the world, it 
dates from the 12th Century B.C. It was the capital of the Roman province of 
Asia and one of the wealthiest cities in the Middle East, but was abandoned 
when its harbor silted up and malaria swept through the population. 
</P>
<P>
A good overnight base is the town of Selcuk, about two miles away. Selcuk is 
accustomed to accommodating tourists but small enough to still be curious about 
each new visitor. It offers first-class hotels for under $20 a night, good 
shopping and inexpensive restaurants galore. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 miles farther south you glimpse a skyline not of minarets but of 
construction derricks, preparing you for perhaps the most blatantly touristy of 
Turkey's coastal resorts, Kusadasi. Sunsets behind the small 14th-Century 
island castle jutting into the harbor would be perfect except for the 
six-foot-high letters spelling DISCO atop the modern building next door. Still, 
the ever-gracious Turks courteously cope with the hordes who swarm this 
cruise-ship haven. 
</P>
<P>
Several hours' drive through rocky farmland takes you to Bodrum, an attractive 
town with whitewashed houses crowding the hills above a pretty bay where the 
Mediterranean and Aegean meet. In their villa here, Istanbul-born Ahmet 
Ertegun, the jet-set chairman of Atlantic Records in New York City, and his 
decorator wife, Mica, lavishly entertain the glitterati. You, too, can buy in, 
for anywhere from $40 million to $140 million. 
</P>
<P>
Bodrum is among the yachting centers where you can charter wooden sailboats 
called "gulettes" for what is known as the Blue Cruise along the Turkish 
Riviera; the cost is about $500 a week. Numerous boat-chartering outfits 
operate out of storefronts in between the waterfront restaurants that line the 
harbor, and as you feast on the fresh catch you watch the yacht set dining on 
the decks of their boats -- and watching you. 
</P>
<P>
Though you'll see no golden arches, there seems to be a Benetton on every block 
here, and LaCoste and Boss resort wear is touted everywhere. Still, there are 
mosques and markets, reminding you that this is not Hilton Head. 
</P>
<P>
On less developed Bodrum Peninsula are isolated beaches and fishing villages 
such as Gumusluk, where tiny pensions charmingly if ominously boast "lasting 
water." 
</P>
<P>
On the outskirts of town you pass a vast "carpet farm," with scores of carpets 
laid side by side across a field to be sun-tested. Donkeys and camels laden 
with farm produce stand beside the road, as do children selling fruit and jars 
of honey. 
</P>
<P>
An interesting two-hour detour inland is Pamukkale, which means cotton castle. 
Petrified waterfalls of white stone cascade into thermal waters that collect in 
shallow wading pools. The pools have been used since Roman times for the 
water's therapeutic powers and reportedly were frequented by Cleopatra. Now 
hotels border huge artificial swimming pools as well. Nearby are the ruins of 
ancient Hierapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Back on the coastal route, about two hours from Bodrum, is Marmaris. It has the 
look of an international resort but is casually set amid pine-forested 
mountains on a fiordlike harbor where yachts are gunwale to gunwale. Here, too, 
you dine almost nose-to-bow with their occupants. 
</P>
<P>
Choose from any of the hotels along the main boulevard, and you'll be surprised 
how cheaply you can join the smart set -- as little as $20 a night for a 
seaview room with terrace. 
</P>
<P>
A painfully slow two hours away via a roller-coaster road that winds around a 
dozen peaks (more pleasantly reached by boat for $10 or $15) is the laid-back 
outpost of Datca, Key West-like in its remoteness. Settle in for a few days or 
skip this one. 
</P>
<P>
Temple-like Lycian tombs carved into the cliffs high above Fethiye bring the 
past to hand at this tourist magnet. You can climb up to the tombs, which also 
are eerily illuminated at night. Across the hills is Oludeniz, a lagoon created 
by a sand-bar beach and popular for family outings. 
</P>
<P>
Similar tombs and the ruins of an ancient amphitheater distinguish tiny Kas, 
which offers a handful of nice shops selling carpets and ceramics, plus the 
usual waterfront brigade of restaurants but a less-touristy atmosphere. But 
prices reflect the international crowd that comes through. For local charm at a 
good price, a good place to stay is the homey Hotel Mimosa, with rates of about 
$30 daily. 
</P>
<P>
Next and last stop on most weeklong itineraries: Antalya, the main tourist 
center on the Turkish Riviera. Its old quarter rambles down a hillside to the 
harbor from a congested palm-lined boulevard. The historic Hotel Turban Adalya 
is splurge material, at about $100 a night, but well worth it for ambience and 
amenities. 
</P>
<P>
Antalya is surrounded by beaches, many of which charge a small entry fee but 
offer lockers, showers and water sports if that's your pleasure. It's also the 
best base for a day trip to lofty Termessos, one of the least accessible ruined 
cities. A tumble of huge granite building blocks on a steep wooded mountainside 
is all that's left of this reclusive civilization, which even Alexander the 
Great decided not to tackle. You can visit Antalya's fine museum to fill in the 
details. 
</P>
<P>
From Antalya, it's again only an hour's flight to Istanbul, barely a wink in 
Turkish time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Turkish Travel Made Easy 
</P>
<P>
Getting There: Among the airlines that fly to Istanbul from New York City are 
Turkish Air Lines, PanAm, Trans World, British Airways, Air France and 
Lufthansa. A round-trip ticket between New York City and Istanbul costs $925 to 
$1,400, depending on seat. 
</P>
<P>
When to Visit: The climate is perfect on the Aegean and Mediterranean coasts 
during spring and autumn, about April through June and September through 
November. Temperature changes from about 65 degrees in March to about 93 in 
July. In November the temperature drops to about 70. 
</P>
<P>
Getting Around: Buses cost just pennies, taxis only a few dollars for most 
jaunts in the cities. City buses require tickets bought in advance, but if you 
apologize to the driver for not understanding the system, other passengers may 
offer you one of their spare tickets or you'll be allowed to ride free. 
</P>
<P>
Faster than a bus and cheaper than a cab is the Turkish group taxi, called a 
dolmus (pronounced DOL-mush). Dolmuses, either ancient sedans or modern 
minibuses, follow set routes between major downtown points in cities and 
outlying villages. Sometimes they can be flagged down between official marked 
stops. You pay the driver when you get on. 
</P>
<P>
Money: One U.S. dollar buys about 2,400 lira. Always have your passport with 
you when you change money. Many tourist shops, travel agencies, expensive 
restaurants and some hotels will accept foreign currency, but the rate may not 
be quite as good as you get at a bank. Also, most post offices will give you 
liras for U.S. dollars, but not for traveler's checks. 
</P>
<P>
Car Rentals: Hertz and Avis have outlets in Istanbul. Prices are $20 to $35 
daily, depending on type of car. 
</P>
<P>
Terrain: The Aegean region presents changing views of hillsides covered with 
olive, fig and fruit orchards, along with broad fields of tobacco and 
sunflowers. The Mediterranean coast is mountainous without much beach between 
Fethiye and Antalya, but then opens into a fertile plain between Antalya and 
Alanya east to Adana. 
</P>
<P>
Departure: It is illegal to buy, sell, possess or export antiquities. However, 
you may export valuables that have been registered in your passport on entry or 
that have been bought with legally converted money. For souvenirs, the maximum 
export limit is $1,000 for all items combined. 
</P>
<P>
Driving: Drivers must have a valid driving license. An International Driving 
License is useful, but not normally required. A U.S. license should be enough. 
Third-party insurance such as a "green-card" valid for the entire country or a 
Turkish policy is obligatory.

The word for welcome in Japanese is yosoko, which is the greeting travelers are 
hearing these days from Tokyo to Kyoto and beyond. It was inevitable, I 
suppose. The B&amp;B network has finally reached the land of the rising sun. 
Sayonara to the old life. Groups led by George Cebra and his Japanese wife 
Fumiko of Palm Springs are being hosted in private homes by Japanese anxious to 
earn the extra yen. Inexpensive food and lodging. Departures from LAX 
throughout the summer. Cebra, a musician, began guiding tours after teaming 
with Fumiko, whom he met not in Japan but in an antique store in Pasadena. 
Round-trip air fare, lodging, sightseeing figures out to $2,800 for 10 days. 
For Japan that's cheap. Visits to Tokyo, Nikko, Kamakura, Lake Hakone, Nara 
(extensions offered to other destinations). 
</P>
<P>
Cebra and his wife plan to turn their Palm Springs home into a Japanese-style 
inn, with guests sleeping on futons and with sliding shoji screens for privacy. 
The cost for living like an emperor (or empress) will range from $55 single to 
$75 double, with a choice of Japanese or American-style breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
Write to the Cebras c/o Heart of Japan, Box 9403, Palm Springs 92263, or call 
(619) 327-0705.

Gypsy Caravan: For a new experience in Ireland, consider joining a Gypsy 
caravan. You're in the driver's seat. Each caravan wagon sleeps up to five 
vacationers. Blankets, cooking utensils, a gas stove. Spend the night in a 
meadow or beside a country road. Plenty of peace. And the Irish will love you 
for joining them on their own turf. The season got underway last month 
(continues through October). A week is recommended. Rates: $150/$450. 
Instructions, maps included. For brochures, write to Slattery's Travel, 1 
Russell St., County Kerry, Ireland. 
</P>
<P>

the South Island. Follows a Maori trail across the Alps. Miles of spectacular 
scenery. The same company does a guided tour that starts/finishes in 
Queenstown. Features the Southern Alps, with breathtaking views of lakes, 
rivers, streams. Hikers do about eight miles per day. No age limit, although 
hikers should be in good physical condition. Nights are spent in cabins 
equipped with all the necessities. Only light backpacks are necessary. Cost:

See U.S.A.: For the traveler who intends to see the U.S.A. and Canada this 
summer, start making plans now. This is the advice of George C. Guenther, 
president of the 3,700-member National Tour Foundation that concluded its 
spring convention several days ago in Palm Springs. The NTF focuses on the 
mature traveler, who the amiable Guenther predicts will be out in force across 
the nation this summer. "The mature market is getting younger," he said, 
explaining that more travelers in their early 50s are appearing on the scene 
and that the trend will continue for at least the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
NTA's motor-coach tours take in the major national parks as well as historic 
settings. Popular destinations: Yellowstone, the Grand Canyon, Bryce and Zion 
national parks, San Francisco and the Napa Valley, the Great Smokies and the 
New England states, both during summer and the fall foliage season. Guenther 
brought up one negative point: Hawaii is pricing itself out of the mature 
traveler market due to high prices.

Hawaii Hideaway: If you've vacationed at Kona Village on the Big Island of 
Hawaii, no doubt you will recall Barbara Campbell, who used to arrange sunset 
weddings by the sea. A born romantic. Now Campbell has said aloha to Kona 
Village and is operating a B&amp;B at Kamuela near the Parker Ranch. Calls it 
Waimea Gardens Cottage (antique furnishings, lace curtains, French doors). 
Campbell works with five other B&amp;Bs in the Waimea area. One is a converted 
barn (two bedrooms, a living room with fireplace). Another faces a stream with 
views of Mauna Kea, Mauna Loa and the Pacific Ocean. If you're tired of crowds, 
Campbell promises sweet peace.

SWEDISH ISLAND IS DOTTED WITH VIKING TOMBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NILSSON, Nilsson is a Chicago-based free-lance writer, a researcher 
for the Chicago Tribune and a native of Stockholm, Sweden.

<P>
VISBY, Sweden 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It stopped snowing. Suddenly the sun broke through the clouds. Pale rays of 
light streamed down through the forest and hit the snow-covered pre-Viking 
burial mounds of Trullhalsar grave field; an engulfing mist began to rise. The 
air seemed heavy with the spirits of old warriors. 
</P>
<P>
It was a magical place, the perfect setting for a Wagnerian opera, and I half 
expected Valkyries to come riding out of the mist. Trullhalsar is one of many 
archeological sites on Gotland, the largest island in the Baltic Sea. This 
Swedish island is an important historic area but it is also one of the 
country's most popular holiday resorts. 
</P>
<P>
Film director Ingmar Bergman vacationed here. So did the late Prime Minister 
Olof Palme. Recently the dramatic landscape of Faro, just north of Gotland, was 
the setting for the late Soviet director Andrei Tarkovsky's film, "The 
Sacrifice." 
</P>
<P>
Most visitors come by car ferry to Visby, Gotland's provincial capital on the 
west coast. This beautiful walled city is a mixture of medieval ramparts and 
towers, skeleton-like ruins of once great cathedrals and red-roofed cottages 
lining cobblestone streets. 
</P>
<P>
Its climate is mild compared to the rest of Sweden, so roses bloom in December 
in the gardens of Visby's picturesque homes. "The city of ruins and roses" is 
what Swedes call Visby. 
</P>
<P>
Off-season, this town of 20,000 is a sleeping beauty. Having arrived at dawn 
one day in April while it was still slumbering, my husband and I decided to 
have coffee in a shop at the harbor while waiting for the town to awaken. 
</P>
<P>
Other early risers crowded the casual coffee shop. A blond waitress, wearing a 
red polka-dot apron, was ladling hearty portions of oatmeal porridge as dock 
workers waited in line. 
</P>
<P>
Two policemen sat talking, bent over steaming coffee, their radios buzzing on 
the table. A loudspeaker above our heads was bellowing the morning news. As a 
Stockholmer, I had a hard time following the announcer's melodious Gotland 
accent. 
</P>
<P>
The Gotland dialect of Swedish is the remnant of a different language. Even 
before Roman times, Gotland, strategically in the middle of the Baltic, was an 
important trade center. Medieval Gotland merchants developed and controlled the 
trade routes between Russia and Europe. In the 12th Century, with the arrival 
of German merchants, Visby became one of the most important trade centers in 
Northern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Reminiscent of medieval German cities, Visby has a 13th Century wall more than 
two miles long, one of the longest and best preserved in Europe. From its 
towers in the year 1361 residents watched the troops of Danish King Valdemar 
Atterdag defeat thousands of armed peasants and kill defenseless children. 
</P>
<P>
That famous battle marked the beginning of decline for Visby and the prosperous 
republic of Gotland. Frequent attacks by pirates and foreign powers, and the 
eventual changing of trade routes, further diminished Visby'spower, and in 1645 
Gotland became a Swedish province. 
</P>
<P>
Now Gotland is subject to a new, more peaceful invasion. Only six hours from 
Stockholm by ship, the island hosts more than 200,000 visitors every year, 
quadrupling its population. Visitors are attracted by Sweden's sunniest 
weather, sandy beaches and a lovely landscape. 
</P>
<P>
Signe Pettersson lives in the modern part of Visby outside the wall. She rents 
visitors rooms in her apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Showing us a bedroom with flowery wallpaper and lace curtains, Pettersson's 
daughter explained that her mother was in Stockholm, visiting her son. 
</P>
<P>
Furnished with an antique kitchen settee, crochetted curtains and well-tended 
geraniums, the large kitchen reminded me of a grandmother's kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Visby is not the only historic attraction. Gotland has been inhabited for more 
than 7,000 years and as a result it is Sweden's richest province in 
archeological findings. The island's 1,200 square miles are dotted with Viking 
tombs, rune stones and foundations of Viking settlements. More than 200 Bronze 
Age cairns have been found. These stone formations, up to 90 feet long, are 
called "boat graves"' for their ship-like shape. 
</P>
<P>
The island boasts no fewer than 92 medieval churches. Built after Gotland was 
Christianized in the 11th Century, they are mostly in Gothic style. 
</P>
<P>
We drove east from Visby, passing soft fields, fir forests and red barns. At 
Ekeby, a little village in the interior, we decided to look more closely at its 
church. The door was locked. The only sign of life around came from a gas 
station, where a man was bending over the hood of a 1960s Volvo. When asked how 
we could get inside the church, he looked up indifferently and pointed an oily 
index finger toward a white house across the field. "That's the vicarage," he 
said. "They'll give you the key." 
</P>
<P>
The vicar's wife gave me a rusty iron key as big as my arm. Handing me a 
flashlight, she said: "You will need this to find the light switch. It's in a 
cabinet to your left as you enter. And don't forget to switch it off when youl 
eave." 
</P>
<P>
Inside, we found that the walls were covered with frescos of biblical motifs. 
Behind the altar the entire wall was painted to resemble a theater curtain. A 
beautifully carved and painted pulpit stood in the center. 
</P>
<P>
Spying a narrow winding stone staircase, we decided to climb the bell tower. 
The last portion was a dizzying climb on creaking wooden stairs that had no 
railing and faced an open pit. 
</P>
<P>
We reached the rotunda where two large cast iron bells hung in the center. A 
flock of pigeons, disturbed in their sleep, flapped their wings and disappeared 
through one of the small windows. Brown fields, plowed and awaiting spring 
sowing, spread in all directions. From my vantage point I counted nine church 
towers nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Seven churches later, after stopping several times to take photographs, we 
arrived in Roma, a village in the island center. The church was impressive, 
built on the foundations of an older church. Following the routine, I went to 
the vicarage to ask for the key. This time the vicar answered the door. I was 
startled by his appearance. The tall, blond, boyish-looking man was dressed in 
a long black gown and starched white collar. 
</P>
<P>
Noticing my surprise at his formal attire, he smiled and explained that he had 
just returned from a funeral service. As he strode across the cemetery toward 
the church, coat-tails flapping in the wind, the young man looked like a 
19th-Century Lutheran vicar. 
</P>
<P>
Sunlight poured through the stained-glass rose windows, creating patterns on 
the nave floor. Notes of Bach's St. Matthew Passion floated in the air. The 
organist was practicing for an Easter concert. 
</P>
<P>
The vicar, new to the parish, began to explain details of his church. He also 
told how Sunday services alternate between different churches because each 
parish is too small to fill its church. 
</P>
<P>
By the wooden bell tower next to Roma church an old woman was planting flowers 
on a grave. Looking up, she smiled and said: "Spring came early this year. 
Let's see if these flowers will survive." 
</P>
<P>
Looking at our cameras, she said: "You are from Stockholm." 
</P>
<P>
I explained that though I am a Stockholmer, my husband and I had just arrived 
from Chicago. Surprised and pleased that we had come so far to visit her 
island, she began telling us about the village. 
</P>
<P>
We talked about Gotland's economic dependence on agriculture. Lacking necessary 
resources to mechanize for increased productivity, many small farms have 
closed, diminishing job opportunities. Many, including her children, have moved 
away from the island. 
</P>
<P>
We drove south, past meadows where the tiny but sturdy indigenous ponyies, 
Russ, roamed. The Scandinavian dusk, which would last another hour, turned the 
sky crimson. In this glowing light the windmills and the cottages with pitched 
thatched roofs took on magical forms. 
</P>
<P>
We arrived at Bjorklunda pension tired and hungry. The innkeeper told us that 
though business was slow just then, the pension was fully booked throughout the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
After settling in a comfortable two-room cottage wewalked the 100 yards to the 
main building for dinner. Other guests were helping themselves at a generous 
salad bar. We ordered lamb stew, a local specialty, and beer. 
</P>
<P>
The morning was cool and brisk, the air pristine and the horizon clearly 
visible. It was a day for using the bicycles we had brought with us. The flat 
landscape and a coastline with unspoiled beaches has made Gotland immensly 
popular with cyclists. There are numerous bicycle tracks and roads, all marked 
on cycling maps, and many shops on the island rent and service bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
We stopped in Ljugarn, a town on the east coast, to buy provisions. 
Ljugarnharbor was once an important fishing center. Now it is quiet because big 
trawlers have gone elsewhere. But every spring the smell of turpentine and the 
sound of hammers banging come from the red boat houses as sailboats are rigged 
for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Bundles of the morning paper had just been delivered to the kiosk on the main 
square. Old men lined up, discussing the day's headlines. A woman came out of 
the store, struggling with shopping bags and two young children. Schoolboys 
zigzagged on skateboards, well aware that they were being watched by two 
giggling girls sitting on a bench. 
</P>
<P>
A fisherman climbed off his bicycle to mail a letter. He paused in front of the 
bulletin board, filled with church notices, the schedule for the soccer team 
and sale signs for boat engines and cars. 
</P>
<P>
After buying crisp bread, ham and the famous sweet and spicy Gotland mustard, 
we headed for the beach. 
</P>
<P>
North of Ljugarn the landscape changed dramatically. Sandy dunes and trees, 
twisted and tormented by the wind, led to the sea. Fantastic sculptured rock 
formations resembling petrified giants stretched along the shore. The limestone 
columns, called raukar, are carved by the sea, and are one of Gotland's most 
famous geological wonders. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the rauk field was the cold blue Baltic, where the Vikings once took off 
on arduous trade routes. Fearing plundering by their enemies, they often buried 
their treasures, sometimes so cleverly that they never found them. To this day 
the plows of Gotland farmers unearth coins from Ancient Rome and the Byzantine 
Empire. Some discoveries are on display at the Fornsal Museum in Visby. 
</P>
<P>
In summer Visby hosts historical plays, music festivals and Viking sports 
tournaments. The romantic streets, so quiet and empty in winter, become packed 
with tourists. Artists and ceramists sell their wares and take orders to keep 
them busy through the winter. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurants, cafes and discotheques open their doors. Sailboats line up in the 
marina. The ferry arrives, spewing its contents of cyclists and families in 
Volvos, heading for cottages or campsites by the sea. By midsummer this 
sleeping beauty is awake, regaining some of the vitality of its heyday seven 
centuries ago.

<P>
Getting around Gotland: Car rental available in Visby. Bicycle is the ideal 
mode of transportation on this flat, small island, with abundant smaller 
country roads where farm tractors are the only motor vehicles in sight. An 
eight-day bicycle rental starts at about $25 (including insurance). Or go for a 
package including accommodations at a hotel or campsite. There is also a 
network of buses serving the island. 
</P>
<P>
Where to stay: Several possibilities from hotels, apartments, pensions, to 
youth hostels, cottages and campsites. 
</P>
<P>
Hotels central in Visby are Visby Hotel, (P.O. Box 2044, 621 02 Visby. Tel: 119 
25). A package including ferry transportation (round-trip ticket) bath and

Rental of apartments in Visby and cottages in the countryside are attractive 
alternatives, so make reservations in advance. 
</P>
<P>
The price during summer is about $150-$250 per week for one person, including 
ferry transportation. 
</P>

<P>
The second week of July, at Stangaspelen sports competition, islanders compete 
in sports dating to the Viking era. 
</P>

the sidewalks and in the parks of this joyful and cosmopolitan city, it's 
difficult to realize that it was once the most morally unbending town in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The austerity began in 1536 with the arrival of Frenchman John Calvin (nee Jean 
Cauvin), who preached the Reformation with dictatorial fervor for three decades 
and turned the town into the Rome of Protestants, even burning a Spanish doctor 
at the stake for dissenting theological views. 
</P>
<P>
Calvin would have been more than chagrined to know that the university he 
founded became a crucible for the post-Reformation ideas of native son 
Jean-Jacques Rousseau, for Voltaire, Goethe, Victor Hugo and other renowned 
thinkers, all drawn here by Geneva's flourshing intellectual milieu. 
</P>
<P>
Geneva is the capital of French-speaking Switzerland, and while you'll hear a 
polyglot in cafes and hotels, French is the lingua franca. The city butts up to 
France, with some streets Swiss on one side, French on the other. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a very beautiful city, curving gracefully around Lac Leman (Lake 
Geneva), with a picturesque Old Town riding a hill on the south side of the 
Rhone River, and lovely parks, gardens and smart shops on the north. 
</P>
<P>
Getting here: Fly Swissair, TWA, KLM, Air France or Lufthansa. A round-trip, 
advance-purchase economy ticket will cost from $658 to $1,113, depending on 
airline, season and day of the week. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? Give the city and its galaxy of museums and sights at least 
two full days, with perhaps another for driving along the Swiss or French side 
of the lake. We found lodging and dining costs surprisingly moderate for a 
major European city. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: The Swiss franc recently sold at 1.5 to the dollar. Best time 
for a visit is from April until mid-June. Summers are the most crowded, falls 
lovely. Strangely enough, Geneva usually gets little snow in winter, unless you 
go less than four miles into the Alps. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled in: Le Chandelier (Grand Rue 23; $86 to $126 B&amp;B double) 
sits on a wonderful little pedestrian street filled with antique shops at the 
heart of Old Town. It has a tiny, wood-paneled lobby and minuscule elevator, 
and the bedrooms are spacious yet modest. Breakfast is served in your room at 
this quiet small hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel Touring-Balance (Place Longemalle; $106-$120 B&amp;B double) is at the 
middle of shopping on the south bank, a short walk from the lake front and Old 
Town. Modern bedrooms have mini-bars and TV, and there's a good restaurant with 
a pretty terrace for summer dining. 
</P>
<P>
Mon Repos (131 Rue de Lausanne; $93-$110 B&amp;B double) is across the street 
from a huge garden that fronts on the lake, a few minutes from the north bank's 
center. It's large and modern, with a pleasant restaurant, bar and terrace on 
the lake side. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: The French border crossing is three miles away, so 
menus here are loaded with good things Gallic, plus the wonderful cooking of 
Savoy and the Jura. 
</P>
<P>
Geneva claims longeolle, a pork-and-beef sausage cooked in the oven with sliced 
potatoes gratin, as its very own dish. The same for fricassee genevoise, a 
delicious beef ragout much admired. Lac Leman towns also take pride in the 
perch fillets sauteed with lemon, served with French fries and caught right 
outside the front door. 
</P>
<P>
Vineyards on the lake's sunny slopes produce 6 million gallons yearly, the red 
Gamays and white Perlans being the canton's pride. You'll also see plenty of 
good French and Italian wines. 
</P>
<P>
Good dining: Brasserie Lipp (8 Rue de la Confederation) has become the 
gathering place for tout-Geneve, just as the Paris Lipp is for tout-Paris. 
You'll find the same type of brasserie food: sturdy, satisfying and served 
without frills. Try the cassoulet of Toulouse, choucroute (sauerkraut with 
smoked meats) or perhaps a ragout of pig's feet with mushrooms and buttered 
noodles. This place is jammed at all hours. 
</P>
<P>
Les Armures (1 Rue du Puits Saint Pierre) is a 13th-Century building hard by 
the cathedral and city hall in Old Town. It's really three restaurants on 
different floors, all too atmospheric to believe. They serve everything from 
$30 menus in the Salle des Chevaliers to fondue for $11 in Le Carnotzet, a 
typical Swiss fondue-raclette cellar. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurant du Cent Suisses (18 Chemin de l'Imperatrice) is in the Chateau de 
Penthes, a small castle near the Palais des Nations. While it's a casual place, 
with paper tablecloths and napkins, you'll see folks from the United Nations 
here having the buffet for $12 or the plat du jour for $9. Cent Suisses also 
has a daily menu for $18, with wines by the glass. 
</P>
<P>
Going first-class: Le Richemond (Jardin Brunswick; $266-$300 double) has been a 
labor of love and perfection for the Armleder family since 1875, during which 
time the French writer Colette lived here, and Charlie Chaplin, Marc Chagall, 
Joan Miro, the Aga Khan and other notables were frequent guests. 
</P>
<P>
Le Richemond is a study in what an Old World luxurious hotel should be: Damask 
walls, burnished-wood paneling, gilded baroque mirrors and flower arrangements 
made with loving care. Bedrooms of equal ambience have balconies overlooking 
the lake. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel's Le Gentilhomme restaurant whisks you straight back to the 19th 
Century, including 1892-vintage wines. Eighteen pounds of five different 
caviars are served daily from the trolley. 
</P>
<P>
La Perle du Lac (128 Rue de Lausanne) has a beautiful view of Mont Blanc across 
the lake to go with its marvelous French food and romantic setting. Expect to 
pay $46 to $73 for five-to-seven-course menus. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: Start with a slow walk through Old Town, then take in the 
13th-Century Tavel House for a look at early life in Geneva. The Museum of Art 
and History can't be missed, nor a visit to Petit Palais (Renoir, Monet, 
Chagall, Picasso). Geneva has 30 museums, with the new Red Cross Museum 
(founded here) one of the most moving. 
</P>
<P>
Now take a ride on the lake in a Mouette (sea gull) steamer. The Jet d'Eau, a 
stream of water shooting almost 500 feet high from the lake, is Geneva's 
trademark. It's either a fantastic work of contemporary art or the world's 
tallest monument to faulty plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
And chocoholics can't miss Du Rhone Chocolatier (at 3 Rue de la Confederation), 
which boasts "the most expensive chocolate in the world but also the best." 
</P>
<P>
For more information: Call the Swiss National Tourist Office at (213) 335-5980, 
or write (222 N. Sepulveda Blvd., Suite 1570, El Segundo 90245) for brochures 
on Geneva, hotels, walking tours and the region. Ask for the Geneva package.

CRUISE VIEWS: TWO SHIPS INSPIRED BY THE DOLPHIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MONFALCONE, Italy 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Ships today are made like shoe boxes, like hotels put on top of a barge." 
</P>
<P>
The words are those of Italian architect Renzo Piano, whose first building, the 
Pompidou Center in Paris, created an international stir in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Feeling the way he did, Piano set out to make sure that the first ships he was 
commissioned to design -- the Crown Princess and the Regal Princess, for Los 
Angeles-based Princess Cruises -- be something extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
Piano began with the concept of a dolphin swimming through the water, then 
worked for three years with the designers and engineers of Italy's Fincantieri 
shipyard near Trieste to turn the concept into reality. 
</P>
<P>
"The metaphor of the dolphin was just that, a metaphor," Piano said, "but then 
we decided to make (the ship) with round edges and double curves. It is not so 
easy to do. (But) modernity needs a strong connection with the past and with 
memory." 
</P>
<P>
Piano, 52, considers a ship "a magic object very important in the collective 
memory of people," and describes his design for the Crown Princess as "round 
corners, soft shapes, belonging to the water." 
</P>
<P>
An ardent sailor, Piano had designed sailboats for his own use but nothing on 
the scale of these 70,000-ton, 1,590-passenger vessels. His contribution, he is 
quick to point out, was limited to the top of the ship, the interior and 
exterior of the forehead-shaped dome and the topmost decks, where the sleek 
curved lines soften the usual boxy cruise ship silhouette. 
</P>
<P>
From inside, the dome resembles what Piano calls "the inside of a whale," with 
polished, rounded, bone-colored ribs arching from ceiling to floor and framing 
wide curved windows. Nineteen feet high in the center, the dome will serve as 
casino, observation lounge, cocktail lounge and dance floor. The designer 
compares it to a piazza in a small town where "you walk to meet people." 
</P>
<P>
One deck down, Piano has designed the buffet lunch and breakfast area with teak 
floor and stark white-and-glass bulkheads similar to the dome. The stern 
bulkheads are transparent, giving a view to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
The designer says he started on the project three years ago and made 3,000 
drawings ("not sketches"), working on each tiny detail. He showed as an example 
a finished section of a step in teak with incised grooves filled with silvery 
metal strips. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of Piano's design point to the tall vertical funnel as looking less 
dolphin-like than Princess' traditional raked, streamlined stack. Piano 
counters by saying it is "frank, clear, strong, a strong statement . . . and it 
works beautifully, by the way, to take the smoke away." 
</P>
<P>
He also insists that he does not want to push the dolphin metaphor too far: "A 
ship is a ship, it's not a dolphin." 
</P>
<P>
The Crown Princess is the ninth ship in the line, which began in 1965 with a 
single vintage ferry called the Princess Patricia which offered informal 
sailings down the west coast of Mexico, later dubbed the Mexican Riviera by 
Princess Cruises. 
</P>
<P>
Fincantieri officials say that the Crown Princess is on schedule, and it is 
expected to begin cruising for Princess on July 8 from Athens. Four 
pre-inaugural Mediterranean sailings will be followed by a transatlantic 
crossing to New York, arriving Sept. 21. 
</P>
<P>
After several days of festivities there, the Crown Princess will sail to its 
home port of Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., from which it will cruise the Caribbean on 
two seven-day itineraries priced from $1,295 to $2,985 per person, double 
occupancy, including air fare to and from Ft. Lauderdale.

BARGAIN CORNER: ISLAND ATTRACTIONS IN PUERTO RICO BOOKLET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK ADLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A revamped "Island Attractions" booklet is available for travelers planning a 
trip to Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the discount coupons in the booklet are for folkloric shows given as 
part of the year-round LeLoiLai festival, which celebrates the island's 
traditional music and dance forms. 
</P>
<P>
But the booklet also has coupons for lodging, sports, sightseeing tours, theme 
parks, car rentals, restaurants and shopping. 
</P>
<P>
The coupons, which may include free admissions to some museums and other 
attractions, cover such activities as a cruise around San Juan Bay, 
complimentary rum bottles during a guided tour of a rum distillery, golf, horse 
racing, snorkeling and scuba diving. 
</P>
<P>
You can buy the discount booklets when you arrive in Puerto Rico at $8 for 
adults, $6 for children 11 and under. The booklets are valued at about $120. 
Many of the special festival shows cost $5 or more for general admission. 
</P>
<P>
The booklets are complimentary if you book a minimum of four nights at 
participating hotels at regular room rates during the April 16 to Dec. 15 
off-season. 
</P>
<P>
Another perk is a 20% discount given for stays longer than four nights, Monday 
through Thursday, at a majority of Puerto Rico's country inns. 
</P>
<P>
For more information, contact the Puerto Rico Tourism Co., 3575 W. Cahuenga 
Blvd., Suite 248, Los Angeles 90068, (213) 874-5991. 
</P>
<P>
Farther north, 29 hotels and villas in the Nassau, Cable Beach and Paradise 
Island areas of the Bahamas are offering guests complimentary discount 
booklets, with more than 60 coupons covering: dining and entertainment; various 
sports, including golf; sightseeing attractions, including boat cruises, and 
shopping, which may entail free gifts as well as discounts. 
</P>
<P>
The coupons are good throughout 1990. Contact travel agents or the Nassau-Cable 
Beach-Paradise Island Promotion Board at toll-free (800) 327-9019. JACK ADLER

KEEPING HEALTHY: WATER, WATER EVERYWHERE -- IS IT FIT TO DRINK? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. KARL NEUMANN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when many of us had finally trained ourselves to drink bottled water 
overseas came the news last year that bottled water isn't always perfect. If 
Perrier can contain impurities, is anything safe? 
</P>
<P>
Well, yes. But just because water is sold in a bottle labeled "spring," "pure," 
"mineral" or "natural" doesn't mean it cannot make us sick. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, bottled water comes from either ground springs or is processed tap 
water. For such water to be pure, the springs must be continually monitored 
and/or the water carefully purified. Otherwise, it may not be any safer than 
tap water. 
</P>
<P>
Bottled water generally is safer while traveling because tap water everywhere 
contains microorganisms which, if sufficiently different from those in your tap 
water at home, may cause intestinal upset. 
</P>
<P>
If you can find them, known bottled-water brand names such as Evian, 
Montecantini, Vittel and, yes, Perrier, are probably safest to drink, 
especially in developing countries. Those companies use sophisticated 
techniques to remove potentially harmful chemicals and microorganisms from 
water, techniques that local bottlers may not. 
</P>
<P>
Insist that bottles be opened in your presence to ensure that bottles are not 
filled with tap water. 
</P>
<P>
Some hotels in developing countries provide unsealed canisters of water in 
guest rooms. But even if the water is safe -- and it may not be -- the 
canisters may be unclean. In countries where sanitation is poor, double check 
water safety and if in doubt, do not drink the water in the canisters or use it 
for brushing teeth or cleaning contact lenses. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, deluxe hotels in developing countries purify tap water but systems 
may break down. It probably is safer to drink bottled water. It also makes 
sense to drink bottled water at airports and on flights originating in 
developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
When only local brands are available, drink carbonated bottled water or soft 
drinks. Carbonation acidifies water and can kill some microorganisms. 
</P>
<P>
Minerals in water do not kill microorganisms or prevent disease and may 
increase the cost. In addition, some minerals may not be healthy for people 
with heart and kidney conditions and those taking certain medications. Ask your 
physician if there are any minerals you should avoid. 
</P>
<P>
Ice cubes are generally made from tap water and as such, may not be safe. But 
if you must have a cold drink, carry clean, leakproof plastic bags with you and 
place cubes inside one before placing the bag in your drink. 
</P>
<P>
Carry an electric immersion coil to boil water for making coffee or tea or for 
brushing teeth. Boiling for five minutes or, at high altitudes, 10 minutes will 
help kill microorganisms. Coils are available in many department stores but 
probably will require a current converter and a plug adapter to make them work. 
</P>
<P>
Use chlorine bleach, tincture of iodine or commercial water purification 
tablets (Halazone, for example) to disinfect water when boiling is not 
feasible. Add two drops of 5% chlorine bleach or five drops of 2% tincture of 
iodine to a quart of water and let stand for 30 minutes before using. But 
remember: Like heat, chemicals can kill microorganisms but have little or no 
effect on chemical impurities. So your best bet for safety probably remains 
drinking bottled water.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: VISITORS TO LONG BEACH CAN TRAVEL BACK IN TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Queen Mary and Spruce Goose, currently celebrating a yearlong "Voyage to 
1939" entertainment festival, have designated June as "Senior Fun Days." 
</P>
<P>
Seniors 55 years and pay $13 (regular adult admission is $17.50). Not only is 
it a dollar better than the regular $14 senior rate and but there's an 
additional bonus. 
</P>
<P>
Seniors can bring the grandchildren (ages 5 to 11) for $7 each. That's a 
savings of $2.50 off regular rates. When tickets are purchased, "Senior Fun 
Days" should be mentioned to ensure getting the discount. 
</P>
<P>
The grandchildren will especially enjoy the "Brighton Carnival," an on-shore 
recreation of an old English traveling carnival. 
</P>
<P>
Top draw of the many children's rides and attractions is a two-tiered, 
turn-of-the-century carousel. There also are two Ferris wheels, plus puppet 
shows, jugglers, carnival games and a diving show. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to touring both the Queen Mary and Spruce Goose, there are other 
"Voyage to 1939" events and attractions. 
</P>
<P>
These include a "1939 Auto Show," featuring mint-condition 1939 cars sharing 
space under the Spruce Goose dome; two musical revues, and roving musical 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
Fireworks' shows will take place on Saturday evenings through June 15. 
Afterward they are daily through Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
For those who wish to extend their stay, a package offers one of the former 
liner's 365 first-class staterooms at $78 per couple now through June (regular 
rates start at $95) and includes two general admission tickets. Reservations 
are needed. Call (213) 435-3511, Ext. 1105. 
</P>
<P>
For more information about Senior Fun Days, regular year-round senior rates or 
even lower rates for senior groups of 20 or more, call (213) 499-1629. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach has a wide variety of accommodations that offer senior rates or 
discounts for mature travelers. Most, however, are offered with the usual 
senior discount caveat -- "subject to space availability." Mid-week stays are 
the best bets and reservations are usually essential. 
</P>
<P>
Among the choices are: 
</P>
<P>
Sheraton Long Beach, the city's newest hotel with 430 rooms, across from the 
Convention Center; 25% discount. (213) 436-3000. 
</P>
<P>
Ramada Renaissance Hotel, another Convention Center area hotel of 380 rooms, 
"Best Year's" 25% discount, with grandchildren under 18 free. (213) 437-5000. 
The Ramada Inn on Pacific Coast Highway near the Long Beach Airport has a 
similar discount. 
</P>
<P>
Residence Inn by Marriott, 10% discount. (213) 595-0909. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Marriott, with 311 rooms, near the airport, has its "Leisurelife" 
(age 62+) 50% discount on rooms, 25% on most restaurant meals, 10% on shopping 
in the gift shop. (213) 425-5210 or toll-free (800) 228-9290. 
</P>
<P>
Golden Sails Hotel, a moderate-priced facility at 6285 E. Pacific Coast 
Highway, with 175 rooms, 10% discount. In the evening there are also 
budget-priced buffet meals. (213) 596-1631. 
</P>
<P>
Down a short way in nearby Seal Beach, the Seal Beach Inn and Gardens offers 
10% senior discount for its 23 rooms, including a full breakfast. (213) 
493-2416. 
</P>
<P>
Still more Long Beach senior discounts can be found in chain motels and inns 
such as Holiday Inn, Vagabond Inn, Comfort Inn, Best Western Inn, Econo Lodge, 
Travelodge and the new (Compri) Hotel in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Seniors age 62 and over can also take advantage of the 30 cent rides on the

THE NEW POWER OF TV ADVERTISERS; 
</P>
<P>
THE INCREASING CLOUT OF SPONSORS HAS BEEN SEEN MORE AND MORE THIS SEASON AS 
'OBJECTIONABLE' SHOWS MAKE SOME HIT LISTS 
</P>

When Dave Boylan received an elaborately wrapped package in his mail last 
December, he assumed that one of his business associates had sent him a 
Christmas present. As vice president and general manager of the ABC-affiliated 
television station serving Winston-Salem, N.C., Boylan often receives small 
gifts from the companies selling him the syndicated programs that WGHP-TV airs, 
such as "Regis &amp; Kathie Lee" and "House Party." 
</P>
<P>
"What I expected to be a box of candy was in fact a videotape from Geraldo 
Rivera," recalls Boylan, whose station airs the controversial talk show host's 
"Geraldo" every weekday at 10 a.m. "It was essentially Geraldo's statement that 
he realized he had probably created topics last November that were too hot and 
too exploitable, and that he would seek a different course." 
</P>
<P>
At issue was a monthlong series of shows on topless doughnut shop operators, 
battered lesbians and similar topics. Calculated to boost Rivera's audience 
during a key ratings sweeps period, the sex-themed programs backfired badly: 
Not only did they prompt complaints from outraged viewers and nervous station 
managers, but they also caused several major advertisers to move "Geraldo" to 
the top of their so-called hit lists -- internal rankings of "objectionable" 
shows in which companies do not want their commercials to appear. 
</P>
<P>
These hit lists have begun to shape today's syndicated TV programming and, to a 
lesser extent, prime-time network fare. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera's aggressive, winter-long battle against defections by sponsors, 
stations and viewers is symptomatic of an acute sensitivity to controversial 
content this season that has already contributed to the cancellation of some TV 
shows and the overhaul of others. Changes implemented over the last several 
months by the producers of "Geraldo" and other reality-based series have helped 
assure their survival for at least another season, but other syndicators have 
abandoned the genre altogether in favor of more advertiser-friendly game shows, 
situation comedies and talk programs. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been selling national TV advertising for 10 years and right now there is 
significantly more sensitivity to programing on the part of clients and their 
ad agencies than I've ever seen," observes Clark Morehouse, the executive 
spearheading the "Geraldo" makeover for Tribune Entertainment Co., the show's 
Chicago-based distributor. 
</P>
<P>
Advertiser hit lists are nothing new. Since the inception of television, 
sponsors have maintained "don't buy" policies involving programs with which, 
for a wide variety of reasons, they want nothing to do. 
</P>
<P>
Often the reasons are entirely benign. "Campbell's wouldn't want an ad for its 
tomato soup to air after a bloody stabbing," points out Stephen Battaglio, 
associate editor of Adweek magazine. "No advertiser wants its spot to run next 
to material that might tarnish the image of its product." 
</P>
<P>
Today's hit lists, however, have swollen to include some of TV's highest-rated 
syndicated series and several popular network shows, including 
"thirtysomething," "China Beach" and "Dallas." These programs are being 
rejected as much for their themes, style and tone as for specific 
product-related content. 
</P>
<P>
While there is no unanimous opinion on why advertisers have become so wary of 
potentially offensive programming, industry executives interviewed by The Times 
suggest that sponsors have been sensitized by a combination of events and 
circumstances. Some say today's soft economy and cluttered media environment 
have prompted companies to seek wholesome product images that will be 
acceptable to a wider spectrum of viewers and, theoretically, yield more sales. 
Others feel advertisers are simply trying to avoid the unwanted publicity that 
came their way amid last year's debates over the propriety of "Married . . . 
With Children," "The Morton Downey Jr. Show," "Favorite Son" and other 
boundary-pushing shows. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt that (society) has been in a more conservative mode since the 
late '70s," says Marc Feidelson, senior vice president and media director for 
Dailey &amp; Associates, a Los Angeles ad agency. As a result, he says, "things 
that are sensationalistic get put on a hit list." 
</P>
<P>
The nation's conservatism has fueled the campaigns of self-appointed TV 
watchdogs, many of whom are now directing publicity campaigns and economic 
boycotts against advertisers who appear on shows they consider excessively 
violent, sexual, profane or "un-Christian." 
</P>
<P>
"I am very much against the Don Wildmons and Terry Rakoltas of the world," 
declares Chuck Bachrach, senior vice president of Western International Media, 
in a reference to the most prominent advocates of tamer programming. "But big 
advertisers are so afraid of their letter-writing campaigns that they sometimes 
don't think it's worth the effort to fight (such activists), even if there is a 
big rating at stake." 
</P>
<P>
What bothers one advertiser may not concern another, however, and most shows 
are able to find replacements when a would-be sponsor backs away -- provided 
they aren't on too many hit lists and have decent ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Still, this season, more than any in recent memory, audience size often seemed 
irrelevant to a sponsor's pull-out decision. "A Current Affair," for example, 
turned up at the head of a hit list prepared by the New York-based consulting 
firm Telerep and published last February in the trade weekly Electronic Media. 
Although the tabloid series is among the most-watched syndicated shows in 
America, "A Current Affair" was being "resisted" by 94 potential sponsors on 
the Telerep list. 
</P>
<P>
Telerep President Steve Herson confirmed authenticity of the document in 
published reports but did not return telephone calls from The Times asking 
about its preparation. Herson told Electronic Media that the list, which he 
referred to as an internal document to help the company's sales force, was 
compiled by polling buyers of national TV ad time and cross-checking their 
responses with Broadcast Advertising Reports, a statistical index of commercial 
usage. 
</P>
<P>
Distributed to Telerep clients in January, the index of "sponsor resistance" 
claimed 92 advertisers were staying away from "Inside Edition," another 
syndicated tabloid, and 91 were avoiding "Geraldo." 
</P>
<P>
Just how many millions of dollars programmers are losing to hit lists is a 
matter of conjecture, but knowledgeable sources at Tribune Entertainment 
estimate that the series has lost as much as $4 million a month because of 
depressed national ad rates. They acknowledge that several key stations have 
either preempted objectionable segments, moved the series to less lucrative 
time slots or declined to renew their contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Officials representing other tabloid shows concede they have suffered similar 
losses but insist, like Tribune, that there are plenty of stations and 
advertisers eager to replace defectors. 
</P>
<P>
But other program suppliers are getting the message. "If anyone came in during 
the last few months and spent five minutes trying to sell me a series, four 
minutes was spent telling me how advertiser-friendly the product was," laughs 
one station manager looking to replace "Geraldo" with two game shows. 
</P>
<P>
Not all objections concern the syndicated fare appearing outside prime time. 
</P>
<P>
Cropping up on several hit lists, including Telerep's, are Fox's "Married . . . 
With Children," CBS' "Rescue 911," NBC's "Unsolved Mysteries" and ABC's 
"thirtysomething." 
</P>
<P>
The latter series was conspicuously avoided by several major advertisers 
earlier this season when co-producers Marshall Herskovitz and Ed Zwick included 
a scene in which two homosexual male characters were shown having an intimate 
conversation in bed. 
</P>
<P>
ABC lost an estimated $1.5 million on the episode, even though the network had 
persuaded Herskovitz and Zwick to tone down the scene, which originally had the 
two men kissing. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt the way the network handled that segment was very supportive," says 
Herskovitz, reserving his considerable wrath for timid corporations that he 
believes now pull their commercials at the slightest hint of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if you're selling soap, I think you have to be mindful of the effects of 
such actions," he sighs, likening today's skittish sponsors to the national 
book-sellers refusing to display Salman Rushdie's "Satanic Verses" for fear of 
upsetting Islamic fundamentalists. "There is a real danger of TV taking a giant 
30-year step backward to the time when advertisers controlled the content of 
programs." 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks after "thirtysomething's" bedroom scene aired, ABC faced similar 
advertiser resistance to a made-for-TV biography about Rock Hudson that made no 
secret of the late actor's homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
"(Advertisers) do not want to be involved, and rightly so, in controversy or 
controversial themes," explains Alfred R. Schneider, vice president of policy 
and standards for Capital Cities/ABC Inc. "They certainly do not want to be the 
subject of boycotts or customer dissatisfaction." He insists, however, that 
advertisers are never allowed to override the "independent judgments" of ABC 
censors about what is appropriate for broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this season, CBS apologized to General Motors for some sexually 
suggestive moments in an episode of its "Wiseguy" series. The scene, which CBS 
spokesman George Schweitzer now admits "may have gotten a tad too steamy," 
prompted a phone conversation between the Rev. Donald Wildmon, a long-time 
critic of CBS programing through his Christian Leaders for Responsible 
Television (CLeaR-TV), and John McNulty, GM's vice president of public 
relations. Wildmon's complaint was followed by a barrage of letters from 
CLeaR-TV supporters to GM Chairman Roger B. Smith. 
</P>
<P>
McNulty, explaining that a single offended viewer may represent a loss of car 
sales for years to come, later announced a revamp of its pre-screening policies 
aimed at insuring that a similar slip-up never happens again. 
</P>
<P>
Like most major advertisers, the auto maker will continue to pay an outside 
agency to review advance tapes of every entertainment program in which its 
commercials are scheduled to appear. In an unprecedented move, it has also 
stationed a GM unit manager in the screening company's New York office to make 
sure ads are pulled from any shows "that may gratuitously exploit sex and 
violence, dishonor religions or racial groups, or present one-sided treatment 
of controversial issues." 
</P>
<P>
"Last year," McNulty points out, "General Motors withdrew 67 commercials from 
programs judged unacceptable. Nevertheless, there were isolated incidents 
where, because those who screened our programs were unfamiliar with our 
policies, GM advertising did appear where it should not have." 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine Antoniello, vice president of Advertising Information Services, a New 
York-based company that scrutinizes virtually every prime-time network program 
on behalf of 50 major ad agencies and their clients, says the most sensitive 
areas continue to be sex, violence, profanity, drugs, alcohol and religion. 
"They're concerned about all those things," she confirms, "plus controversial 
issues, of course. Shows that deal with abortion and stuff like that." 
</P>
<P>
Antoniello disputes claims that her screeners have been placed in the effective 
role of censors. 
</P>
<P>
"All of our clients assess our pre-screening reports and do what they like," 
she says. "We never contact the network people directly. We never have and I 
don't ever expect we will." 
</P>
<P>
One reason General Motors and other major advertisers are reluctant to appear 
within reality-based syndicated shows, according to Antoniello, is the 
difficulty in obtaining copies of episodes far enough in advance to make 
judgments about their content. Although steps are being taken to address the 
problem, some programs cannot even tell advertisers what the topic of their 
shows will be from one day to the next. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost everybody has an episodic rule," explains John Mandel, senior vice 
president and director of national broadcasts for the Grey Advertising agency 
in New York. "If we can't pre-screen it or tell them what the topic is, some 
clients just won't run in the show." 
</P>
<P>
One tabloid series, "A Current Affair," has made a concession to advertisers by 
scheduling at least one "soft" episode each week, carefully structured so as 
not to offend sponsors, viewers or station managers. 
</P>
<P>
"We bear in mind the needs of our station clients first and then the 
advertisers in the way we formulate decisions with respect to program content," 
explains Michael Lambert, the Los Angeles-based president of domestic 
syndication for 20th Century Fox Television Corp., which distributes "A Current 
Affair." Lambert insists that the hit lists controversy "hasn't affected our 
clearances or bottom-line yet, but we are concerned about it because we see it 
on the horizon." 
</P>
<P>
"We are doing internal research and sales research to make sure that we are 
being sensitive to the concerns," he continues. "But we want to be very careful 
so that we don't become a mouthpiece for any advertiser and that we maintain 
our First Amendment privileges." 
</P>
<P>
"I got rid of the baby killers and sleazy sexual deviants," explains Westin, 
now a King World vice president. "We've adopted 'the clean air act of the '90s' 
as our credo." 
</P>
<P>
Paramount, meanwhile, has denied reports that the recent cancellation of two of 
its syndicated shows, "Friday the 13th: The Series" and "War of the Worlds," 
was a result of advertiser resistance. The studio says it pulled the plug on 
the programs because of lackluster ratings and because sufficient "Friday the 
13th" episodes had been produced to insure its future in syndication. But an 
anti-violence advocacy group believes otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"Our national protest campaign convinced more than 30 national advertisers to 
reduce or eliminate their advertising in 'Friday the 13th' and 'Freddy's 
Nightmares' (a syndicated Warner Bros. series)," declares David Boyd, director 
of public affairs for the National Coalition on Television Violence. According 
to Boyd, the Illinois-based group began writing protest letters last summer to 
sponsors of the two shows, citing excessive violence, gratuitous sex and 
Satanistic overtones. 
</P>
<P>
"We've chosen to avoid 'Friday the 13th' and 'Freddy's Nightmares,' " confirms 
Lt. Col. David Fredrikson, assistant director of accession policy for the U.S. 
Defense Department, which had been running recruitment ads on the two shows. 
"They deliver a very good audience for us of career-oriented, 18-year-old males 
. . . (but) we are also concerned about what our name and image appears next 
to. We share the same concerns as the coalition does, and we don't want our 
image associated with one of Satanic culture and Satanism. I imagine if 'Cosby' 
had a Satanic theme we'd pull our ads from that show as well." 
</P>
<P>
Asked to estimate how many protests his office had received concerning "Friday 
the 13th," Fredrikson guessed the volume average at "maybe one letter every 
couple of weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Bevilacqua, who pulled ads from the same series on behalf of 
SmithKline Beecham Consumer Brands, said fewer than a hundred letters prompted 
her decision. 
</P>
<P>
"If there are a substantial group of people who are offended (by a program), 
then certainly we're going to look into it," she explains, adding that her firm 
was spending "a considerable amount of money" on "Friday the 13th" and 
"Freddy's Nightmares" to promote sales of its Vivirin, Oxy-10 and Oxy-Cler 
health products. A review of several episodes led SmithKline Beecham to 
withdraw from the two shows because of concerns about Satanism, profanity, sex 
and violence, she says. 
</P>
<P>
"These programs were really not something we wanted to be on," she says. "It is 
true to some extent that (the pull-out) was because of NCTV's campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Despite NCTV's apparent success with some advertisers, the group now regarded 
as the most influential advocate of toned-down programming is the Rev. 
Wildmon's Christian Leaders for Responsible Television, which he co-directs 
with the Rev. Billy Melvin of Wheaton, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
"We have sensitized the corporate world," says Melvin, who also serves as 
executive director of the National Association of Evangelicals. "We've made 
them aware of the problem, and I think they're responding." 
</P>
<P>
CLeaR-TV "does not have a hit list of shows," Melvin insists. "A series can be 
fairly good one time and be very bad the next." 
</P>
<P>
But Melvin concedes that his organization does maintain a "hit list" of 
advertisers whom CLeaR-TV regards as supporters of "bad" programming. 
</P>
<P>
"These companies have been playing games with the American public by telling 
viewers they wouldn't support offensive programs and doing just the opposite," 
says Melvin. "We feel it's time that they be held accountable for that kind of 
shabby procedure." 
</P>
<P>
CLeaR-TV launched a formal consumer boycott of Mennen and Clorox last July to 
protest the broadcast advertising choices those firms made last May. Sources at 
both companies contend that the boycott has had absolutely no economic effect 
on their operations. Clorox, in fact, reports sales increases of more than 11% 
over the past nine months. But just 10 days ago, CleaR-TV called off the 
boycott against Clorox because it said the company had reduced its sponsorship 
of objectionable programming by two-thirds and had assured CLeaR-TV that it 
would continue to avoid such programs in the future. 
</P>
<P>
David L. Goodman, vice president of public affairs at Clorox, says that the 
boycott had not prompted the company to toughen its existing advertising 
guidelines -- which prohibit purchasing time on any program that contains 
graphic or gratuitous sex or violence, disparages any ethnic or religious 
groups, treats individuals in a disparaging manner or glorifies the use of 
drugs or alcohol. But Goodman admits that the action by CLeaR-TV caused Clorox 
to conclude that the company occasionally had been lax in enforcing those 
guidelines, and the company now supplements the screening of programs by an 
outside agency with previews by its own employees. 
</P>
<P>
"We are responding not so much to the group, but to its members," Goodman said. 
"When we receive letters from families that say, 'We love and have always used 
your products, and our parents and our grandparents used your products, but 
we're not going to buy your products anymore because you are associated with 
this kind of television show,' we respond to that." 
</P>
<P>
Both Melvin and Wildmon claim several other major corporations now discuss 
their prime-time advertising decisions directly with CLeaR-TV, although they 
will not divulge any names. The organizers of CLeaR-TV, who consider themselves 
guardians against "un-Christian" programming, are pleased with this response. 
</P>
<P>
"We started going to the sponsors (with programing complaints) because, very 
frankly, we were not making any progress in dealing with the producers and 
networks themselves," Melvin explains. "When we went to the sponsors, we got 
results." 
</P>
<P>
Programming executives at the three major networks have all publicly conceded 
that they paid closer attention to content this season than last, blaming last 
season's excesses on everything from the writers' strike to cutbacks in the 
number of staff censors. Each network now asks producers to forward to them 
rough cuts of any programs that could ruffle advertiser feathers, and some 
sponsors now get to look at made-for-TV movies six weeks or more before air 
time. 
</P>
<P>
At the so-called fourth network, Fox executives declined to discuss advertiser 
hit lists on the record, but one official privately conceded that Fox is 
keeping a closer eye on the content of its shows, which are singled out more 
often than any appearing on ABC, CBS and NBC. 
</P>
<P>
The 36-page Telerep hit list, for example, counts 40 advertisers "resisting" 
placement on "Married . . . With Children," four times the number avoiding 
"thirtysomething." Other shunned Fox shows include "America's Most Wanted" (46 
advertisers), "21 Jump Street" (12), "Cops" (24), "The Reporters" (19), "The 
Tracey Ullman Show" (13), "The Simpsons" (11) and "Alien Nation" (10). 
</P>
<P>
"Viewers like this kind of programming and obviously they don't find it 
offensive or they wouldn't watch it," says Mike Levinton, vice president and 
director of programming for New York-based Blair Television. "Yet the 
advertisers are afraid to go into these things because of the controversy they 
create. I find some paradoxes there." 
</P>
<P>
So do broadcasters. But many find themselves in a crunch. There has been a 
significant downturn in national TV advertising in general. Sales have been 
soft for the past year and show signs of even more softening. 
</P>
<P>
"When your cash-flow was growing at 12 to 15% a year," says Dave Boylan of 
WGHP-TV, "it may have been OK to ignore some advertiser who didn't want to buy 
time on 'The Gong Show.' But now, when cash-flow and operating profits are not 
growing at nearly those rates for many of us (in the TV industry), we're 
willing to pay more attention to complaints."

STEPPING INTO AILEY'S DIRECTORIAL SHOES; 
</P>
<P>
JUDITH JAMISON DROPS EVERYTHING -- INCLUDING PLANS FOR HER OWN COMPANY -- TO 
CARRY HIS MANTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA PERLMUTTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wanted: CEO for a black culture corporation. Preferably of stout heart and big 
shoulders. Limited experience OK. Will consider owner of small mom-and-pop 
store. 
</P>
<P>
That ad might describe the job Judith Jamison inherited -- and her 
qualifications -- when Alvin Ailey died 10 months ago. And now with his Dance 
Theatre about to perform in Los Angeles for the first time without its founder, 
the moment of truth is here. 
</P>
<P>
For most people who are driving, ambitious and energetic, running one dance 
company would seem to be enough. But Jamison has a second agenda, and a third. 
</P>
<P>
That's why the new director of Ailey Dance Theatre has dropped everything -- 
the overseeing of both her own 18-month-old Jamison Project and her late 
mentor's company -- to fly for a single day to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I want America to be proud of the cultural advent he gave it," she says, 
referring to Mayor Tom Bradley's soon-to-be-read proclamation naming a day in 
the late choreographer's honor. "All of us (dancers) are consciously committed 
to speaking to that beautiful talent. We're proud that his light shines 
through, that it touches hearts and souls all over the world." 
</P>
<P>
Jamison may sound like she's delivering the gospel but here in her hotel, 
tucked on a winding road just above Sunset Strip, the one-time Ailey star 
fields phone calls and gears up for the Dance Gallery Guild luncheon at which 
she will be the featured guest. 
</P>
<P>
"Alvin set the example we want to live by," Jamison says, stretching her long 
legs under the coffee table of a suite with full Hollywood view. "And that's 
how I'm trying to keep his spirit alive. He gave something to everyone, 
different things to each person. So that at the memorial service (aired on PBS 
Jan. 6) I could look around and see many strange faces, yet realize he had 
personal connections to them all." 
</P>
<P>
The statuesque dancer, as dramatically lithe as ever, animates her points with 
hand gestures and arm extensions -- geometry in motion. She doesn't sit on the 
couch so much as maneuver around it. In fact, she seizes the situation, 
conducting the interview herself. 
</P>
<P>
And when the subject of the Ailey's five-day Wiltern engagement comes up -- it 
opens Tuesday with a program of excerpts from the late choreographer's oeuvre 
-- she campaigns vigorously. One gets the feeling that whatever the company 
founder did sotto voce, his successor would communicate through a megaphone. 
With pride and love. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing will really change, Jamison vows. But now the original ideals stand to 
be amplified. The notion of what a classic is, for instance, and that Ailey 
forged a genre with historical consequences. 
</P>
<P>
"For the sake of modesty Alvin may not have wanted to brag about his 
contribution. But when you look at it he created true American icons with 
'Revelations' and 'Cry.' " 
</P>
<P>
In effect, the Eurocentric tradition may have "Swan Lake" and "Nutcracker," she 
points out, but God bless the country that's got its own -- especially when 
that "creation can touch everyone and have a universal appeal. And it's not 
just an extraordinary repertory, but the dancers, well. . . . Do people know 
that Dudley Williams is marking 27 years with the company and he's still 
re-inventing himself?" 
</P>
<P>
For Jamison, who grew up listening to her parents preach a sermon similar to 
Ailey's -- "be committed, be prepared, love what you do and keep your humor" -- 
the present course is nothing exceptional. 
</P>
<P>
"Since babyhood I've always evolved from one thing to another. My mother gave 
me ballet lessons at 6 as part of her enthusiasm for the arts and for life. We 
went to museums, to the theater. While her own talent was untapped she worked 
for church causes." 
</P>
<P>
But the single most important message Jamison learned back in her native 
Philadelphia had to do with allowing one's individuality to bloom. That, she 
says, is the very trait Ailey treasured in her and fostered. 
</P>
<P>
"Who else looks like me?" she asks, with a touch of self-mockery, tracing her 
5-foot-10 height and cap-close coif ("Hair that simply doesn't grow"). Only a 
mentor with great freedom of imagination could have encouraged her to pursue a 
career in dance, she insists. 
</P>
<P>
"And when I retreated to the country (after retiring from the Ailey company a 
decade ago and then playing "Sophisticated Ladies" on Broadway for two years), 
it was Alvin who got after me to teach some of his classes. It was Alvin who 
gave me the studio space and told me to try doing choreography. 
</P>
<P>
"It was uncanny how he knew what each person needed -- even those not in his 
immediate view." 
</P>
<P>
After the Jamison Project has fulfilled remaining engagements, it will disband, 
with half the members joining Ailey. ("It was an agonizing decision, since I 
couldn't take them all.") 
</P>
<P>
Less than a year ago Jamison could be heard saying: "I know that I can't handle 
more than a dozen dancers." Now she is charged with running the affairs of 28, 
in addition to the 12 in the Jamison Project. What does that say about change? 
</P>
<P>
"It says live and learn," Jamison admits. "In 1983 I also told Alvin that I'd 
never make dances. And look what happened." 
</P>
<P>
But for the time being, choreography is not a major focus. The director leaves 
that to others -- such as Garth Fagan and Ulysses Dove, who, she says, 
represent a new wave. It is that combination of the classic and the novel "that 
make up our vision." 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the operative word as Jamison sees it is expansion rather than 
change. 
</P>
<P>
"As in our summer camps for what we call 'at-risk' kids. Alvin started the idea 
in Kansas City where the company has a residency and takes along the junior 
ensemble. It's tied up with the idea of education outreach -- teaching 
disadvantaged kids the dignity of discipline and accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what they may do later in life those values will shape a solid human 
being. That's what we want to foster here, and nationally. Alvin (who developed 
here as a dancer/choreographer with Lester Horton) loved Los Angeles so. It's 
only right to bring the program to this city." 
</P>
<P>
And how will Judith Jamison manage to realize her goal -- as well as turn the 
fiscally troubled corner of her new responsibility, the Ailey company? 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I'll talk about to Barbara Bain (Dance Gallery board president). 
After all, whoever has experienced this company will want to help it. 
Everyone's a candidate to participate." 
</P>

THE CUTTHROAT COMPETITION ASSOCIATED WITH THE MOTION PICTURE INDUSTRY IS SELDOM 
SEEN AMONG SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S RESIDENT THEATERS, EVEN WHEN A HOT PROPERTY 
SUCH AS DAVID MAMET'S 'SPEED-THE-PLOW' (RIGHT) IS ON THE MARKET.;

THE GENTLEMANLY STRATEGY OF ACQUIRING PLAYS

<P>
A year and a half after "Speed-the-Plow" closed on Broadway, David Mamet's 
savage glimpse of the movie industry has yet to play Los Angeles. If L.A. 
theatergoers want to catch the Southern California premiere, they will have to 
take a 45-mile ride to South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa next month. 
</P>
<P>
Given the subject, you would have thought the logical place to revive Mamet's 
drama was the Mark Taper Forum, within a stone's throw of Hollywood. Gordon 
Davidson, the Taper's artistic director, certainly thought so. And so did 
Gregory Mosher, the director of New York's Lincoln Center Theater, who staged 
the original Broadway production. 
</P>
<P>
What happened, though, is not only an illustration of the vagaries that 
desirable plays can encounter on their way to Southern California but an 
example of the odd competition for previously produced works, which make up 
more than half of the major offerings at the region's five professional 
resident theaters: the Taper, South Coast Repertory, the Los Angeles Theatre 
Center, the La Jolla Playhouse and San Diego's Old Globe Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Securing the rights to a top stage property rarely if ever requires brilliant 
stratagems. For that matter, unlike the cutthroat rivalry associated with hot 
movie properties, competition among the resident theaters is a gentleman's 
game, the recent court fight between the Gnu Theater and the Burbank Theatre 
Guild over Lee Blessing's "Independence" notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Persistence, enthusiasm and lucky timing -- to say nothing of aesthetic taste 
-- are more likely to count than naked greed or Machiavellian ploys. 
</P>
<P>
The most important reason is the market itself. "You have to start from the 
perception that this is not a commercial arena," said Bill Bushnell, artistic 
director of the Los Angeles Theatre Center (LATC). 
</P>
<P>
All the resident theaters operate as nonprofit organizations, and none can 
offer big money to license a play or launch a new one. All pay a standard 
author's royalty of roughly 5% of gross box office receipts on a new play, 
slightly more for a recently established hit. And all mount productions with 
limited runs, adhering to contractual terms set by the League of Resident 
Theatres. 
</P>
<P>
"An agent is not going to cut a sweeter deal with us or La Jolla, because we 
essentially make the same deals," said Jerry Patch, dramaturge at the 507-seat 
South Coast Rep, where the royalty for the six-week run of a new play averages 
$20,000. "The contracts are so standardized it's like auto dealers working with 
the Blue Book. I've never seen a price war in 14 years." 
</P>
<P>
At the 756-seat Taper, the author's royalty for an eight-week run of a new play 
averages $30,000. That compares with $28,000 for six weeks at the 581-seat Old 
Globe, $15,000 for six weeks at La Jolla's 492-seat Mandell Weiss Theatre and 
$13,000 for eight weeks at LATC's 498-seat Tom Bradley Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar differences -- resulting from variations in attendance and ticket 
prices as well as house size and length of run -- can hardly be ignored. But 
royalties, not being huge in any case, often take a back seat to other 
considerations among playwrights and agents. Production quality, for example, 
easily looms as large as royalties, whether a new script is being shopped by an 
agent or a licensed property is being sought by a theater. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really think about who will pay the most money," said Lois Berman, an 
independent New York agent who represents playwrights Sam Shepard and Blessing. 
"Quality, always the quality. Never the dollars. I go for the productions." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Davidson wanted to transfer the Broadway production of 
"Speed-the-Plow" to the Taper with the original cast of Joe Mantegna, Madonna 
and Ron Silver. "We had a particular interest in the quality and strength of 
those people, and in keeping Gregory (the Lincoln Center Theater's Gregory 
Mosher) involved," Davidson recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"Gordon and I talked about it," Mosher confirmed from his New York office. "We 
were sitting in this little Italian restaurant. At that point it was going to 
be Joe, Ron and maybe Madonna, because she was getting back to records and 
'Dick Tracy' (Warren Beatty's forthcoming movie) and all that stuff. The play 
was still on in New York when we had that conversation." 
</P>
<P>
Mosher no longer remembers precisely why the idea of a transfer was derailed. 
"I probably just didn't want to commit because we didn't know how long the play 
was going to run in New York," he said. Davidson, for his part, needed a 
scheduling date because he had a subscription season to fill. When he couldn't 
get a commitment, he turned his attention elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Later, plans for a national tour took shape with a different cast. Mosher and 
Bernard Gersten, executive producer of Lincoln Center Theater, considered Los 
Angeles a prime stop and asked Davidson to participate. This time Davidson 
chose not to, he said, "because I didn't want to present a road company." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, South Coast's producing artistic director, David Emmes, had 
notified Mamet's agent, Howard Rosenstone, of his interest in licensing the 
play, only to be told the rights were restricted because of the tour 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
When "Speed-the-Plow" finally went out in May, 1989, with a cast of William L. 
Petersen, Bob Balaban and Felicity Huffman, it got no further than its first 
stop at the Kennedy Center in Washington. "That company just didn't sell," 
Gersten said. But the rights remained restricted because he and Mosher hadn't 
given up the idea of sending out another road company. 
</P>
<P>
"They talked about bringing a production to L.A. for the longest time," said 
Emmes, who decided to make one more call, in July, 1989. "We always put our hat 
in the ring on a play we really like. It was the 11th hour for choosing our 
season, and this time I think we just happened to be at the right place on the 
right day." 
</P>
<P>
By then, the Taper season had already been locked in. Even if it weren't and 
Davidson had made the same call, he would not have landed the play anyway. 
According to Mamet's agent, who says he merely passed Emmes' second inquiry 
along, South Coast got "a special dispensation" from Lincoln Center. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't do the deal personally," Mosher recalled. "But whoever it was 
probably came to me and said, 'How do you feel about South Coast Rep doing the 
play?' And I would have said, 'How would it affect a commercial run in L.A.?' 
And the answer would have been, 'Not a big factor.' And I would have said, 
'Fine.' That would have been the extent of the discussion." 
</P>
<P>
As for Mamet's involvement, there was hardly any. "Rosenstone probably would 
have discussed it with him on a checklist of things," Mosher noted. "Mamet 
would have said, 'Well, what do Gersten and Mosher think?' And I would have 
said, 'What does Mamet think?' And if you check far enough, Dan Quayle might 
have ended up making the decision." 
</P>
<P>
For new plays that have yet to be mounted anywhere, it is the agents -- those 
"gatemasters of the system," as Los Angeles playwright Mark Lee describes them 
-- who act on perceived differences in taste among artistic directors and help 
to reinforce those differences with their script submissions. 
</P>
<P>
"I will send a play where I think it will get the right reception," said Helen 
Merrill, who represents playwrights Christopher Durang ("The Marriage of Bette 
and Boo") and Bill Cain ("Stand-Up Tragedy"). "I know exactly what to send 
Gordon Davidson. And I can assure you a play that he wants is not necessarily 
right for South Coast. Social consciousness goes for Gordon, very original 
writers for South Coast." 
</P>
<P>
Merrill, an independent New York agent, also knows that such broad-brush 
characterizations can't be wholly accurate. Yet they serve as a convenient 
shorthand helping to explain why the competition among the five Southern 
California resident theaters rarely gets overheated. 
</P>
<P>
Said Gilbert Parker, a William Morris agent who represents A.R. Gurney and Beth 
Henley: "It is unlikely that Jack O'Brien at the Old Globe and Des McAnuff at 
La Jolla are going to fight over the same play. Des (whom Parker also 
represents) tends to go for more gritty, experimental plays. He'll take more 
unusual flyers than Jack. Jack is more likely to respond to a Gurney play." 
</P>
<P>
McAnuff, for his part, asserted that he has "gone after only two or three" 
licensed properties among the 35 productions that La Jolla has staged since 
1983. The rest were generated through associated artists or co-producing 
theaters. "We don't wait for agent submissions," he said. "The worst thing that 
could happen is if we all became rubber-stamp institutions." 
</P>
<P>
Not that La Jolla hasn't ever gone politely to the mat with the Taper for the 
same property. McAnuff and Davidson vied this season for Athol Fugard's "My 
Children! My Africa!" La Jolla got it (for a West Coast premiere in late 
August), once again proving that size, money, prestige, visibility and desire 
can be overmatched -- this time by unwavering "enthusiasm and tenacity," as 
Fugard's agent Esther Sherman (also at the William Morris Agency) termed 
McAnuff's effort. 
</P>
<P>
Parenthetically, the Taper and South Coast contended for U.S. premieres of 
Timberlake Wertenbaker's "Our Country's Good" earlier this season and George 
Walker's "Nothing Sacred" last season. The Taper won both times. South Coast 
and the Old Globe competed for last season's world premiere of "Abundance" by 
Henley. South Coast won. 
</P>
<P>
"There are very few secrets," said artistic director Martin Benson, who heads 
South Coast with Emmes. "If a show creates a splash somewhere, the word travels 
fast. It doesn't even have to be more than a workshop. The telephones are 
buzzing as soon as anything happens. It would be unusual if something were 
overlooked." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the unspoken joke in Southern California resident-theater circles is 
that whenever an agent submits a new script with the claim that nobody else has 
seen it, that means except Joe Papp of the New York Shakespeare Festival/Public 
Theater. "If he hasn't," said LATC's Bushnell, "it's only because there are so 
many manuscripts piled on his desk that he couldn't get to it." 
</P>
<P>
Once a property is being shopped in Southern California, the pecking order 
starts with the Taper. Because of this, Davidson is wary of throwing his weight 
around. Thus, he and Bushnell have an unwritten agreement not to interfere with 
each other's projects. "I don't play games with rights to plays," Davidson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson and Emmes also cooperate. Emmes recently told him he may want to do 
Tom Stoppard's "Artist Descending a Staircase" next season. The Taper had 
scheduled the play this season but had to postpone it indefinitely when it was 
staged in New York. Davidson still has the rights. Given Emmes' interest, 
Davidson said, he is considering stepping aside. 
</P>
<P>
LATC and South Coast have worked hard to get first crack at new works not only 
by growing in size but by commissioning dozens of writers and creating play 
workshops. Emmes has even taken his gentleman's crusade to the one major area 
of contracts -- subsidiary rights to stock productions and movie sales -- where 
agents and theaters tend to bargain. 
</P>
<P>
Typically a commercial producer of a first production gets as much as 40% of 
the playwright's royalties from subsequent stock productions. In the nonprofit 
arena, a resident theater gets less -- perhaps as much as 20% of the author's 
royalty -- generally because the amount originally invested by the resident 
theater tends to be less. 
</P>
<P>
Emmes, instead of demanding as large a share as possible, as might be expected, 
does the opposite. "Writers are the most underpaid artists working in the 
American theater," he explained. "We believe in taking as little as possible 
from their future earnings." 
</P>
<P>
This attitude is not lost on agents. They are well aware not only that the life 
of a play launched at a resident theater usually depends on the reception of 
its premiere production but that a well-launched play stands to earn more from 
subsequent stagings -- particularly if it gains an open-ended Broadway or 
Off-Broadway run. Moreover, Hollywood's renewed interest in plays, spurred by 
the movie successes of such stage properties as "Driving Miss Daisy" and "Steel 
Magnolias," can generate far greater future income. 
</P>
<P>
Emmes keeps South Coast's royalty share in subsequent sales to 5% of the 
author's net proceeds and often takes less. Thus, the theater will receive a 
tiny fraction -- perhaps $25,000 -- of the reported $1 million or more recently 
paid by Twentieth Century Fox for Craig Lucas' "Prelude to a Kiss." South Coast 
commissioned the play in 1986 for $12,000, its largest commission ever, and 
staged the world premiere in January, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Hall, managing director of the Old Globe in San Diego, calls South Coast's 
policy "saintly." However, he is not inclined to match it. "We look for a fair 
share, but frankly we try to gain as much participation as we can," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years the Old Globe has earned "in the neighborhood of 
$250,000" from subsidiary rights to such mainstream properties as A.R. Gurney's 
"The Cocktail Hour," Neil Simon's "Rumors" and the Stephen Sondheim-James 
Lapine musical "Into the Woods." 
</P>
<P>
Has Emmes' policy worked? 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the reasons we've been popular," said South Coast's Jerry Patch. 
"There are agents who won't even send a play to some theaters because they want 
too much participation. We don't get first crack at everything, but we see a 
whole lot more than we used to." 
</P>
<P>
Postscript: "Speed-the-Plow" may get to Los Angeles this year, after all. Two 
commercial producers from New York have signed Elliott Gould and George Segal 
for a national tour. Now if they can just find somebody to replace Brooke 
Shields, who dropped out.

MUSIC TV FOR ADULTS GROWS UP;

<P>
HOW VH-1 CHANGED ITS LOOK AND WHY MTV'S SISTER CHANNEL IS NOW GETTING BETTER 
REVIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Music television is a medium that has to constantly reinvent itself." 
</P>
<P>
This recent declaration of instant creative metamorphosis comes not from a 
brazen young executive at that arbiter-of-youth-culture channel, MTV, but 
rather from Ed Bennett, president of VH-1, the other, more conservative music 
channel owned by MTV Networks. "Our feeling is we're going to reinvent music 
television for adults." 
</P>
<P>
Music videos for adults? An oxymoron, you say? 
</P>
<P>
It once seemed as contradictory as it sounds, an idea doomed to failure. VH-1 
as originally conceived and unveiled five years ago was stodgy beyond belief, 
consistently programming video clips by Julio Iglesias, Kenny Rogers and Barry 
Manilow, the sort of artists who prove that it's still unhip to be square. As a 
closed-circuit channel for nursing homes, it might have been soothing, but the 
lucid yuppies it was ostensibly aimed at could scarcely have cared less. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Bennett was brought in early last year to help strengthen the 
channel's advertising and marketing operations, changes in image and 
programming were already under way. Network executives had begun to realize 
from research findings and record industry comments that their target 
demographic (the 25-45 age group) was not as conservative as originally 
suspected. By offering more adventurous programming, the channel hoped to both 
broaden its viewer appeal and attract more advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Subtle at first, the changes have become so pervasive in recent months that 
many fans and industry observers feel VH-1 offers a hipper music mix than MTV. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're trying to do is mirror the musical taste of our (target) 
generation," says Bennett, 43, who keeps an electric guitar in his Manhattan 
office to noodle on between meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"So we've become more upbeat, contemporary and innovative. Because so much of 
our programming is new and fresh, people see us as being more out on the 
cutting edge. I think we are going to lose a lot of those viewers who want VH-1 
to be soft, easy listening, because we have moved away from that, but the 
trade-off is going to be well worth it." 
</P>
<P>
VH-1's new look is a hit on many levels. The channel can now be seen in 36 
million homes, up 6 million from a year ago. Advertising revenue is up a 
whopping 112% for the first half of 1990 from the same period in 1988. The 
music business too is finally enthusiastic about what once was virtually an 
industry joke. More than half of today's record purchases come from the over-25 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
While the channel devotes much attention to such veteran artists as Elton John 
and Rod Stewart, it has also demonstrated the ability in recent months to help 
launch the career of new acts. The latter success actively contradicts the old 
record industry stereotype that grown-ups collectively resist the shock of the 
new. 
</P>
<P>
The network's biggest platinum success stories include 10,000 Maniacs, Basia, 
Bonnie Raitt and Sinead O'Connor. Currently being championed for future success 
by VH-1 are such mature -- and critically respected -- developing acts as Julia 
Fordham, Michael Penn, Lyle Lovett, the Cowboy Junkies, Everything but the 
Girl, k.d. lang, Tanita Tikaram and the Roches. 
</P>
<P>
Says Barbara Bolan, vice president of marketing at I.R.S. Records, the fiercely 
independent label that once would have been considered strictly MTV territory, 
"Eight years ago, it seemed like every time you turned around, all retailers 
talked about was, 'If a video's on MTV, then you're gonna sell records.' 
</P>
<P>
"That talk has died down; I haven't felt that nearly with the intensity that it 
used to happen. I have noticed that there's been an increase of retailers who 
are asking that question, if an artist is going to have a video on the air, but 
this time it's VH-1 that they have in mind." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Palmese, marketing VP and general manager at MCA Records, asserts that 
it is "an artists' channel, and they give their viewers a chance not just to 
know songs, but also to know artists." 
</P>
<P>
As a case in point, he cites a half-hour special VH-1 did on hard-to-classify 
country/folk stylist Nanci Griffith, who has received almost no commercial 
radio play. Besides the special, "they gave us incredible support on her 
videos, which took us easily 100,000 units over her original sales base. . . . 
It sure as hell wasn't radio." 
</P>
<P>
Capitol Records marketing VP Ron McCarroll concurs that Raitt's double-platinum 
"Nick of Time" album "until very recently has not been radio-driven. She got a 
lot of consistent exposure on VH-1 which, beyond the shadow of a doubt, caused 
really strong sales for us and kept the project going." 
</P>
<P>
Going all the way to Raitt's recent Grammy win for best album and an acceptance 
speech in which she thanked the network. McCarroll says, "For the audience that 
VH-1 is trying to reach, which is older and a little less hard rock-oriented 
than MTV, Bonnie Raitt was a perfect artist, right in the pocket." 
</P>
<P>
"The people we created MTV for, a good amount of them have already outgrown 
MTV," says Tom Freston, chairman and CEO of MTV Networks (which also includes 
the Nickelodeon and HA! channels). "These are people who are musically active 
at a much later stage in their life than we've seen before." 
</P>
<P>
To show just how much later in life the VH-1 audience is, Spy magazine printed 
a chart in its April issue satirically underscoring some of the differences 
between the commercials seen on the two channels. MTV, the magazine notes, 
advertises chewing gum; VH-1 pitches antacid. MTV sells Levis 501 jeans; VH-1 
sells the Spiegel Catalog. 
</P>
<P>
Don't look for pop's radical edges -- heavy metal or rap -- on VH-1. No teen 
idols, either -- sorry, Milli Vanilli and New Kids on the Block fans. Dance-pop 
and "alternative" music are represented, but to a far lesser extent than MTV. 
The focus, as I.R.S. exec Bolan puts it, remains on "vocal-intensive groups and 
singer/songwriter-style artists." 
</P>
<P>
Still, VH-1's current cross-section of music is miles wider than it was just 
two short years ago when, amazingly, the network still had not added Bruce 
Springsteen -- among many other obvious adult appeal artists -- to its mellow 
playlist. The reason for such strict counterprogramming was simply a parent 
corporation, MTV Networks, with a deep fear of letting its younger child move 
in on its older star prodigy's successful territory. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, we weren't allowed to duplicate any of MTV's music videos," Bennett 
laments. "They got the first pick and VH-1 got what was left over. That denied 
VH-1 the opportunity to pick the music that was universal by creating this 
mutual exclusivity. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we have duplication between the two networks -- though it's only about 12 
or 13% duplication, which leaves VH-1 with about 87% its own videos. But that 
12% that you do duplicate is very important to us, because these tend to be 
very big artists that span the demos. The Rolling Stones will play from 12 to 
50, and Janet Jackson has a very broad appeal." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, VH-1 was granted complete autonomy to staff run its operation 
separate from MTV. Now the heads of both networks report directly to Freston, 
who gets to mediate any disputes and make sure that his two music video 
networks don't overlap too much. 
</P>
<P>
"The overall effect of making them autonomous and taking MTV's foot off VH-1's 
head has been very good for VH-1 and its self-esteem," Freston says. "Before, 
it was like 'What is MTV not playing? That's what we get' and 'Don't try 
running a promotion that weekend, because MTV's doing something.' There's none 
of that any more. They can beat each other to death. VH-1 spends half their 
time trying to figure out great creative stuff before MTV can figure it out, 
and vice versa. They're actually quite competitive. 
</P>
<P>
"The only concern I've really voiced to the two of them is that they should 
make some effort not to be overly duplicative in the music that they're 
playing. One month we had about 40% of the videos the same on VH-1 and MTV. 
There's no question that there are a lot of crossover artists that belong on 
both, but the cable operators and viewers say 'Aw, they got the same stuff on 
both networks,' like they used to say about HBO and Showtime -- 'They have the 
same movies, what's the difference?' " 
</P>
<P>
One of the major differentiation moves at VH-1 was to dump or reassign the 
channel's creaky crew of on-screen video jocks -- "It seems to work better for 
a younger audience than an older audience; a veejay is a different experience 
for a 15-year-old than for a 30-year-old," notes Bennett -- for a more 
formatted, less random regimen. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing the video jocks to a large extent have been the award-winning 
half-hour artist specials, focusing on such diverse artists as Rickie Lee 
Jones, Soul II Soul, Brian Eno, Anita Baker, John Hiatt, Melissa Etheridge, 
Harry Connick Jr., Lou Reed, Fine Young Cannibals, Dave Edmunds, Poco and Syd 
Straw. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the plethora of one-shot specials, called "VH-1-to-Ones," the network 
also has introduced a new crop of weekly or nightly shows, hosted mostly by 
stand-up comics or past or present pop performers. 
</P>
<P>
Former rocker and TV and film actress Ellen Foley perkily presents the Top 21 
each week. Ex-Herman's Hermit Peter Noone hosts the requisite nostalgia fest, 
"My Generation." Nouveau country and jazz both get prominent weekly time slots. 
There are even non-musical shows, like Rosie O'Donnell's "Stand Up Spotlight." 
(The recurring emphasis on laughs may have something to do with the fact that 
Bennett was also recently named president of HA!, MTV's all-comedy network.) 
</P>
<P>
Most impressively of all, the channel hired on self-admittedly "camera-shy" 
producer/artist Nile Rodgers to host "New Visions," a show full of live 
performances and interviews that spotlights a different musical genre each 
night -- rock on Mondays, folk on Tuesdays, "world beat" on Wednesdays, soul on 
Thursdays and jazz on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
"I honestly feel that (the producers) are sincere" about spotlighting the new 
and/or unusual, says Rodgers, laughing. "I don't think they're saying it for my 
benefit because I'm an artist. " 
</P>
<P>
With all of these eccentricities, amid all this cool, critically correct 
programming, it should be pointed out that VH-1 still programs heavy doses of 
the middle-of-the-road videos that gave the channel its old, stick-in-the-mud 
image. 
</P>
<P>
For every John Lee Hooker blues clip, there are several ballads from Gloria 
Estefan; for every David Byrne Brazilian stomp, a heap o' Bee Gees; for every 
Daniel Lanois head trip, several Cher posteriors. 
</P>
<P>
Will an audience that tunes in for the Rock Lite sounds of Elton John, Phil 
Collins and Kenny G stick around for the affected moodiness of Chris Isaak or 
Love &amp; Rockets -- or vice versa? Can VH-1 afford to be square and hip? Are 
set-in-their-ways grown-ups really half as open to the unfamiliar as their 
younger, MTV-weaned counterparts in couch potatodom? 
</P>
<P>
Nile Rodgers isn't convinced himself. "I think that, given the nature of 
adults, they're not traditionally that receptive to new things. 
</P>
<P>
"VH-1 has been called 'the yuppie network,' and so-called yuppies are people 
who can pick and choose, and if they decide they want to have a network that 
isn't very exciting or aggressive, then they won't watch. But the people at 
VH-1 think it's intelligent to offer alternative programming, and if it's not, 
only time will tell." 
</P>
<P>
Whether VH-1 finally goes the adventurous road or the safe route -- and it will 
almost certainly survive to traverse some road, given advertisers' love for 
those upper demos -- at least viewers can feel assured that Julio, Kenny and 
Barry won't ever be back. 
</P>
<P>
Unless . . . Unless . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe," Bennett muses, "we introduce another night of Nile Rodgers' show where 
it's 'New Visions -- Easy Listening.' "

Searing lava from Kilauea Volcano reached the ocean, sending up billowing 
clouds of hazardous steam. 
</P>
<P>
The lava also threw a noose around the only store and remaining church in a 
remote rural community of Kalapana on the island of Hawaii. The steam, called 
laze, since it is a lava-generated haze, poses a potential health hazard 
because the fiery rock hitting seawater generates acid fumes. Strong trade 
winds were blowing the steam out toward the sea, but officials were concerned 
that nighttime sea breezes or a wind shift could send toxic materials over the 
land.

The car plowed through a fence into a bench, hitting people on the field before 
continuing across a busy street and ramming the entrance to a medical clinic in 
the adjoining suburb of Berwyn, police said. The driver, a man who appeared 
about 50 years old, was coherent after the accident and was taken to MacNeal 
Hospital in Berwyn, officials said. He may have suffered a heart attack, but 
there was no indication he had been drinking, officials said.

Sac and Fox Indians received an apology from Wisconsin for the 1832 Bad Axe

trying to flee white pursuers. "I thank you, sir," Elmer Manatowa of Stroud, 
Okla., chief of the Sac-Fox nation told a state legislator who presented a 
proclamation of apology from the Wisconsin Assembly during a ceremony at the 
battle site near Victory, Wis. Known as the Black Hawk War, the pursuit of the 
fleeing Indians and the riverside massacre by soldiers, state militia and 
settlers was described as "one of the bloodiest tragedies in the sad history of

THEATER NOTEBOOK: DURANG'S 'LAUGHING WILD' IS A REAL HIGH-WIRE ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christopher Durang, who gave you "Sister Mary Ignatius," "Beyond Therapy" and 
"The Marriage of Bette and Boo," is back to rattle your theater senses with his 
newest play, "Laughing Wild," opening Saturday at the Tiffany Theater in West 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"Like most of his writing, it's brutally funny," said director Dennis Erdman 
("How the Other Half Loves"), who also staged "Bette and Boo" at Los Angeles 
Theatre Center last year. "But there's also a foundation of pain, which makes 
it very hard to act. If there's too much pain on the surface, it smothers the 
comedy. If there's too little, it's flaccid. So it's a fine line to travel, a 
real high-wire act." 
</P>
<P>
Walking the wire in the two-character comedy are Jean Smart of TV's "Designing 
Women" and Harry Groener of "Dear John," who were also acting buddies in 
college. 
</P>
<P>
"The characters have no relation to each other on the planet except that they 
both inhabit it," Erdman said. "She explodes; he implodes. She has no 
boundaries; he's obsessed with boundaries. But both are struggling to survive 
in a world of chaos, missed connections, injustice. . . . In the end, there are 
no easy answers. The world is what the world is. But the characters are still 
asking questions, trying to find a way to deal with each other. And yet the 
pain is never purged." 
</P>
<P>
And he calls this a comedy? "It is a comedy," the director said earnestly. "It 
is. It really is." 
</P>
<P>
Also this month: 
</P>
<P>
Tonight: One middle-aged and one young married couple exchange notes on modern 
gender roles in "Ruby, Ruby, Sam, Sam," opening at Hollywood's 
Cast-at-the-Circle. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday: Murder and greed are the main ingredients in the new comedy "The 
Heirs," opening at the West End Playhouse in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Friday: Mary Gallagher dramatizes the plight of illegal immigrants in the 
40-character "De Donde?" (in Spanish, "Where are you from?"), opening at 
Friends and Artists Theatre in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday: Two yuppie couples -- one straight, one gay -- try to get past the 
superficial good life in the Broadway hit "Eastern Standard," coming to the 
Coast Playhouse in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>

clash of a changing society and morality, opens at Taper, Too in Hollywood.

unconscious, opens at Beyond Baroque in Venice.

Wingfield and her gentleman caller, is revived at East West Players in 
Hollywood.

contemporary romantic comedy, "Only You," opening at 2nd Stage in Hollywood.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK: 2 MARIMBAS LEAD LATIN JAZZ SEXTET IN SANTA MONICA PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD EVERETT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Julius Wechter and his new group, the Baja Marimbas, will perform at At My 
Place in Santa Monica on Wednesday, the eve of the percussionist's 55th 
birthday. The unusual sight of two marimbas leading the band is all that this 
Latin jazz sextet has in common with Wechter's best-known group, the Baja 
Marimba Band. 
</P>
<P>
And that story, 18 albums worth, began in 1963 when Herb Alpert offered Wechter 
-- who had played marimba and other percussion on several Tijuana Brass albums 
-- his own group. The Tijuana Brass was a relatively dignified group, but its 
A&amp;M label mate, the Baja Marimba Band, was something else. 
</P>
<P>
"We were like the Tijuana Brass' bad little brothers," Wechter says. "Herb and 
his group would dress in tuxedos and put on a tight, professional presentation. 
And we'd flop on stage in big sombreros and old clothes with big pasted-on 
mustaches, smoking cigars and drinking beer." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Baja Marimba Band's music was catchy, distinctive and enjoyable 
enough to land them spots on virtually every nationally televised variety 
program, the joking image was not accepted (or even understood) by everybody, 
Wechter says. "We played the Michigan State Fair one year, in front of 60,000 
people. While we were getting ready to play, a carload of immigration people 
drove right onto the field where the stage was, and the INS people demanded to 
see our green cards. 
</P>
<P>
"We laughed so hard that they almost put us in jail anyway, just on general 
principles. We were of Italian, Jewish descent -- everything except Mexican." 
</P>
<P>
And that led to a more serious problem, one that resulted in the Baja Marimba 
Band cleaning up its act. 
</P>
<P>
"Ricardo Montalban was heading up a campaign to improve the Mexican image, 
which he felt that we and the Frito Bandito advertising campaign, among other 
things, denigrated. Of course, we had no intention of insulting anybody; it was 
all in fun," Wechter says. 
</P>
<P>
The Baja Marimba Band disbanded after five years, and Wechter takes the blame. 
"I was drinking too much and couldn't keep it together," he admits. "When we 
quit, we had to cancel nine months worth of bookings." 
</P>
<P>
Now sober for 18 years, Wechter continues as a free-lance musician. He, his 
wife Cissy and Joan Greenberg collaborated on a musical, "Growing Pains," that 
made its debut at the Room 4 Theater in Studio City in 1987. It was revived two 
years later at the Westwood Playhouse and will be produced soon in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
A 1980 Baja Marimba Band reunion album sank with the label it was issued on, 
and the group's old A&amp;M albums are now available only on compact disc in 
Japan -- where Wechter will appear next month in a reunion tour with Martin 
Denny, now 80. This week's show, the Baja Marimbas' local debut, will 
commemorate the new band's just-released compact disc, "New Deal," on the 
locally based Bay Cities label. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baja Marimbas will perform Wednesday at At My Place, 1026 Wilshire Blvd., 
Santa Monica. Admission is $10. The show begins at 8 p.m. with a performance by 
Rosemary Butler. For information, call (213) 451-8597.

CONTRAS TO GET OWN COLONY IN DEAL TO DISARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MANAGUA, Nicaragua 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Contra leaders pledged Saturday to begin the stalled process of disarming their 
forces this week in return for the permanent demilitarization of a remote 
corner of Nicaragua where former guerrillas will settle as pioneer farmers with 
government aid. 
</P>
<P>
The accord, announced at 1 a.m. after 15 hours of talks, was the first step by 
President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's 10-day-old administration to 
demilitarize Nicaragua after eight years of war between the U.S.-backed rebels 
and the previous Sandinista government. 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro agreed to announce a plan to reduce the Sandinista-led army on June 
10, the rebels' deadline for surrendering the last of their rifles, and to put 
the plan into effect immediately. She promised to guarantee the safety of 
former rebels and to allow them to form a political party. 
</P>
<P>
But the novelty of the accord was its offer to develop a vast but sparsely 
populated coastal plain in southeastern Nicaragua for former rebels who fear 
reprisals by Sandinistas if they disperse to their native towns and villages. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to build an exemplary society in that area," said Israel Galeano, 
the top rebel commander, who like most of his men, is a farmer from the north. 
"We can adapt to any part of the country, and we will feel better staying 
together." 
</P>
<P>
The colonization plan appeared to remove the obstacles to an April 19 peace 
treaty that arose when Chamorro, taking office six days later, left the army 
temporarily in the hands of the Sandinista revolutionaries who lost the Feb. 25 
vote to her center-right coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Last month's treaty established a definitive cease-fire in a conflict that has 
taken nearly 30,000 lives. It obliged the rebels to gather in seven small 
"safety zones" protected by U.N. peacekeeping troops, and to start disarming on 
Chamorro's inauguration day. 
</P>
<P>
By Friday, U.N. officials said, 13,900 rebel soldiers and civilian 
collaborators had reached the zones, and at least 2,000 more were on the way, 
but not a one had turned in his weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's agreement said that the rebels will start disarming on Tuesday, even 
though the ultimate size of the army they had fought since 1981 and the future 
of its Sandinista commander, Gen. Humberto Ortega, will remain unclear for 
another month. 
</P>
<P>
Galeano, whose failure to sign last month's treaty had cast doubt on its 
effectiveness, led the 23-man rebel delegation that took part in the latest 
talks. "There is a fixed date (for disarming), and we are disposed to comply," 
he told reporters after the talks at Managua's Olof Palme convention center. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in a breakfast interview, the 30-year-old rebel chief who calls himself 
Comandante Franklin said his main worry all along was not the size of the army 
nor the permanence of Gen. Ortega but the safety of his Contras. 
</P>
<P>
The new government satisfied that concern, he said, by agreeing to provide 
land, schools, health clinics, housing materials, farming tools and even new 
roads to help settle disarmed rebels and their families in the southeast corner 
of Nicaragua, and to remove the army from the area. 
</P>
<P>
That was an unexpected concession to the rebels. It appeared to offer them a 
degree of control over roughly 7,300 square miles of timber-rich plains 
stretching along the Costa Rican border from Lake Nicaragua to the Caribbean 
Sea and including most of the province of Rio San Juan. 
</P>
<P>
The written accord gave no details of the settlement zone. It said only that 
"poles of development" will be set up to "satisfy the material needs" of former 
rebels and that the boundaries would be defined by May 31. 
</P>
<P>
But the plan to colonize Rio San Juan with former Contras was confirmed by 
rebel and government officials. They said that the area, now inhabited by about 
5,000 people, could become home to most of the estimated 50,000 former 
guerrillas, family members and supporters seeking new homes. Other zones might 
be set up later. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Ferrey, a former Contra adviser who is Chamorro's liaison to the rebel 
leadership, said that the area will be policed by a locally recruited armed 
security force, probably dominated by former guerrillas but responsible to the 
Ministry of Government in Managua. 
</P>
<P>
He said the locally policed zone would probably exclude the towns of San 
Carlos, San Miguelito and El Castillo, which voted Sandinista in the Feb. 25 
election and will be run by Sandinista mayors. 
</P>
<P>
In the rest of the zone, Ferrey said, the government will offer money or land 
elsewhere to anyone who prefers to leave rather than live among former Contras. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't clear whether Chamorro consulted Gen. Ortega, who was not part of the 
talks, about the decision to withdraw troops from the zone. During two years of 
peace negotiations, the Sandinista government ruled out any territorial 
concessions, and the Contras never demanded any. 
</P>
<P>
One exception was a series of peace agreements that allowed Miskito Indian 
rebels to return to their villages along the northern Caribbean coast and keep 
their weapons as local self-defense forces under Sandinista army supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Although he denied any ambitions to create a "state within a state," Galeano 
spoke with proprietary interest in the future colony, which he said will be 
named "the Spring of Democracy, or something like that." 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to sit there and wait for food to fall from the sky; we're 
going to work," said Galeano, who wore a camouflage uniform and a U.S. Marine 
Corps drill hat but no weapon during the talks. "Instead of asking how many men 
we have for an ambush, people are going to ask how much food we're producing 
per acre. We're going to show we have as much capacity without arms as with 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to look for direct support from other countries," he added. "We're 
going to build a great city. We're going to have lots of beaches. In a few 
years you'll want to come spend your summer vacation there." 
</P>
<P>
Government officials said they had commitments of $23 million from the European 
Community and $30 million from the Bush Administration to pay for Contra 
resettlement. They said benefits would be available to any former rebel, 
wherever he chooses to live.

CENSUS TAKERS MAKE FINAL PUSH TO COUNT SOUTHLAND 
</P>

The man who answered the door had no clothes on. Census taker Lynn Beverly, a 
no-nonsense Compton mother who wears her name tattooed on her right forearm, 
refused to turn away. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him to put a towel around himself," said Beverly, 32, on leave from a 
job sorting mail at the post office. "When he refused, I just tried to keep 
looking at him in the face." 
</P>
<P>
For several minutes, Beverly peppered the man with questions about his home, 
his family and his ethnic origin, then thanked him and moved on to the next 
house. 
</P>
<P>
"Aside from being naked," she said, "he was cooperative." 
</P>
<P>
And so it went last week as thousands of U.S. Census Bureau interviewers began 
visiting front porches across Southern California in a frantic effort to 
canvass the citizenry -- clothed and otherwise. In all, the Census Bureau 
dispersed about half of the more than 11,000 so-called enumerators it needs 
regionally to complete the door-to-door survey, which is intended to count the 
millions of residents who either refused or forgot to respond to mailed 
questionnaires, or never received a form. 
</P>
<P>
The count is supposed to be over by June 6, but some census workers faced last 
week with slamming doors and cries of "Go away!" predicted that it will take 
much longer. Census Bureau spokesman Larry Bryant, while more optimistic than 
the rank and file, said workers would be given whatever time they need. 
</P>
<P>
"Our deadline is to get the count to the President by the close of business on 
Dec. 31," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The tally, never an easy task, has become a bigger headache this year because 
of an unexpectedly poor response to the mail-in forms. As of last week, only 
63% of California's residents had returned their census forms by mail, and some 
corners of Southern California were well below that average. South-Central Los 
Angeles has the worst response rate in the state, with just 50% returned. 
Census officials had expected a 70% response nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
With more people to count, the Census Bureau has been looking just about 
everywhere for people to do the counting. Census recruiters can be found at 
shopping malls, Laundromats, grocery stores, churches, homeowner meetings and 
unemployment offices. This weekend, the bureau intends to hit crowds at every 
major Cinco de Mayo celebration south of Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"People think the census is over, but our work is just beginning," said Marcia 
Rodriguez, a recruiter in Santa Monica. "Any place people go, we are going." 
</P>
<P>
Similar efforts are under way across the nation, where census officials say 
they will need to hire about 300,000 census takers from New York City to 
Seattle. Officials described Southern California's recruitment problems as 
"fairly typical." 
</P>
<P>
The census jobs pay anywhere from $6.75 to $9.50 an hour, but one of the 
bureau's biggest hassles has been keeping the people it recruits. Sore feet, 
run-ins with grumpy residents and the general workaday grind results in a heavy 
dropout rate. Bureau officials said they need to recruit eight people for every 
census taker that eventually winds up on the street. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these people just aren't used to working for a living," said one 
census supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
As the tale of the naked Compton man would suggest, however, those census 
takers who have stuck to the job have learned that counting the people of 
Southern California can entail a lot more than numbers. 
</P>
<P>
In South-Central Los Angeles, census taker Susie Ruiz had to summon paramedics 
when an elderly man she was interviewing had a heart attack. In Koreatown, a 
census taker sped away from a gunman while waiting for a colleague who was in a 
nearby home. In Eagle Rock, a young pianist treated census taker Kathy Kovesdi 
to a brief recital from the "The Phantom of the Opera" while she penciled in 
his responses. 
</P>
<P>
"You certainly get to know your neighborhood firsthand," said census taker 
Alicia Diaz-De Leon, who has been knocking on doors in East Los Angeles. "But 
to tell you the truth, I am more afraid of the dogs than the people." 
</P>
<P>
Chung Nam Lee, a Korean immigrant studying acupuncture, said he learned more 
about his Latino neighbors in one week of census taking in Koreatown than he 
had during five years of living there. 
</P>
<P>
"I found many apartments with two couples living together in one bedroom," he 
said. "That is very strange for Koreans. And many times the wife is older than 
the husband!" 
</P>
<P>
In Compton, census taker Latonya McDaniel on her first day on the job stumbled 
on the man who fathered her child living less than a dozen blocks from her 
home. She had lost track of her former boyfriend more than three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel said she introduced the couple's 4-year-old son, Taiwan, to his 
long-lost father. "He knew he had a daddy somewhere," McDaniel said. "The daddy 
came out with tears in his eyes." 
</P>
<P>
Census takers, many of them middle-aged housewives in soft-soled shoes, have 
been mistaken for Jehovah's Witnesses, Avon ladies, encyclopedia saleswomen and 
even drug dealers. One census taker in Compton was bitten in the arm by a 
frazzled woman who thought she was a peddler. Census takers working affluent 
neighborhoods said it's tough just getting past security guards trained to keep 
away solicitors. 
</P>
<P>
Census taker Francisco Parra, a Mexican immigrant living in Inglewood, spent 
one day making 57 calls from a security telephone at a Marina del Rey building, 
trying to find someone who would let him inside. When he did get in, the 
security guard said he could visit one apartment only. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel so happy anyway," Parra said. "It is a very good opportunity to 
practice my English." 
</P>
<P>
The census takers wear badges identifying themselves as official enumerators 
and carry large briefcases bearing a red, white and blue Census Bureau sticker, 
but they are still feared in some neighborhoods as agents of the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service, the Internal Revenue Service and various law 
enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
In East Los Angeles, one census taker watched a half-dozen illegal aliens run 
from the back door of a house as she knocked on the front door. The woman 
explained in Spanish that she had nothing to do with the immigration agency, 
but residents still refused to let her in the house or answer her questions. 
</P>
<P>
In South-Central Los Angeles, census takers who gathered for a morning briefing 
outside their crew leader's home said a lot of problems in their part of town 
can be avoided by wearing neutral colors. The census takers said they never 
wear blue or red -- the colors of the Crips and Bloods gangs -- and always work 
in groups. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, census officials said, as many as 20 workers join together for 
"sweeps" in dangerous neighborhoods. Crew leader Carlos Garcia said he tells 
his census takers to skip rock houses and other trouble spots until the 
weekend, when crew leaders and supervisors join the census takers on rounds. 
</P>
<P>
"If it is a house that is really boarded up, you know not to go up to the 
gate," said Lanae Smith, 20, wearing a white blouse, black pants and a gray 
jacket. "And if you dress for the neighborhood, you won't have any problems." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the neighborhood, census takers said their biggest problem has 
been overcoming public distrust. Census takers have become experts in 
explaining that the Census Bureau is required to keep the information 
confidential for 72 years, but some residents still refuse to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
Most complaints involve questions on the long form -- which is given to 
one-sixth of the residents -- that delve into sensitive financial areas. 
</P>
<P>
In South-Central Los Angeles, one elderly woman refused to disclose the value 
of her house for fear the government would think she was rich and take away her 
Social Security benefits. In Marina del Rey, some residents have refused to 
disclose their income for fear it might invite an IRS audit. 
</P>
<P>
"When you say you are from the government, people automatically get scared," 
said census taker Marcella Persley, 19. "They think that we are trying to get 
them for something, even if they haven't done anything."

<TEXT>
<P>
On a day heavy with history and rich in optimism, the principal World War II 
powers came together Saturday to plan the reunification of Germany and the 
beginning of a new European order. 
</P>
<P>
In an atmosphere conspicuous in its level of mutual goodwill, the foreign 
ministers of the four victorious World War II Allies -- the United States, the 
Soviet Union, Britain and France -- and their counterparts from East and West 
Germany formally committed themselves to the principle of German unity and 
scheduled three additional meetings in Berlin, Paris and Moscow to negotiate 
the process. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cold War is over," declared Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze. 
</P>
<P>
Added Secretary of State James A. Baker III, "We meet in the recognition that a 
historical process is under way: the unification of Germany in peace and 
freedom." 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations, known as the "two-plus-four" talks, deal with the external 
aspects of unification, ensuring that the security interests of neighboring 
states are not eroded. 
</P>
<P>
The talks will also formally end Allied rights in Germany that stem from World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the sense of history that dominated the day, the leaders settled none 
of the most sensitive issues surrounding German unity, such as the possible 
membership of a united Germany in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the 
way to end allied sovereignty in the former German capital of Berlin, and the 
military status of what is now East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Those issues were put off for subsequent meetings. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the agenda itself, the six foreign ministers agreed only to 
invite Poland to attend the Paris meeting, scheduled for July, when the issue 
of Germany's external frontiers will be discussed. 
</P>
<P>
Poland had demanded to take part in the negotiations because of the acute 
sensitivity of the present German-Polish frontier, which runs along the Oder 
and Neisse rivers. About 44,000 square miles of land that was in Germany when 
the war began were ceded to Poland after the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Both Germanys have separately recognized the Oder-Neisse line, but under 
international law, only a united Germany can legally guarantee the border. 
</P>
<P>
Both German foreign ministers on Saturday tried to reassure Poland. 
</P>
<P>
"The crux is to give the Poles what they themselves feel serves their interests 
and guarantees their security," East German Foreign Minister Markus Meckel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Added West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, "The Polish west 
border as laid down in . . . treaties should be the definitive border between 
Poland and Germany." 
</P>
<P>
Immediate breakthroughs on major issues were not expected here, and the upbeat 
atmosphere gave hope that myriad sensitive issues involved in the unity process 
can be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
For the Germans themselves, the day seemed to confirm that unity really is an 
imminent fact. 
</P>
<P>
"From this first meeting for the two-plus-four talks, the message goes out to 
those in both German states that the will of the Germans to unite in one state 
will be fulfilled," Genscher declared. "For us, this is an emotional day." 
</P>
<P>
As he and other German leaders have consistently done in recent months, 
Genscher tried to allay concerns that unity might once again create an 
aggressive Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"We will use the strength arising from our peaceful unification to the good of 
one Europe -- united and free," he pledged. "We wish to create not a German 
Europe but a European Germany." 
</P>
<P>
West Germany is already the dominant economic power in Europe, and unity plus 
the return of complete sovereignty to a united Germany are certain to give the 
country a political weight that will shift the balance of political power on 
the Continent. 
</P>
<P>
Because of this, German unity has sparked discussions of ways of building a 
more united Europe by expanding the 35-nation Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) -- the only major organization that spans Europe's 
old East-West divide. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, Canada and all European nations but Albania are represented 
in the CSCE, which drafted the 1975 Helsinki Final Act guaranteeing basic human 
rights and ratifying existing postwar borders. 
</P>
<P>
"Consideration is being given to expansion and strengthening of the CSCE," 
Baker told a news conference after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The six leaders appeared intent on maintaining the positive atmosphere, despite 
key differences between the Soviet Union and the other five. 
</P>
<P>
On key points -- such as the prospect of a united Germany within the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization, where the Soviet Union finds itself in a minority 
of one -- Shevardnadze clearly avoided public confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow has strongly opposed NATO membership for a united Germany and has called 
variously for a new Germany to be neutral, nonaligned or even a member of both 
NATO and the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, however, Shevardnadze avoided any reference to Germany's future 
military status in his opening remarks, then he dodged direct questions from 
reporters on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we should dramatize (our differences)," he said. "I can assure 
you the Soviet leadership is interested in working constructively with all 
European states to complete this historic process of building German unity." 
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. official at the talks called attention to Shevardnadze's efforts 
to avoid saying anything that would make Moscow appear obstructionist. "That 
was not an accident," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the meeting itself, the Soviet foreign minister repeated Moscow's 
stand that a united Germany must not join NATO. 
</P>
<P>
"For us, NATO remains what it always was -- an opposing military bloc with a 
doctrine based on the . . . possibility of a first (nuclear) strike," he told 
the other foreign ministers. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a senior U.S. official said the reunification process is being 
driven by Western values, something that might not have been possible a few 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, when the Soviets talked about German unity, they were not talking 
about a democratic process," the official said. "Now we have a chance to do it 
democratically." 
</P>
<P>
While Germans insist that NATO strategy reviews and East-West arms control 
agreements will transform the alliance into a predominantly political rather 
than military institution, Moscow still seems allergic to the idea of a united 
Germany as a member. 
</P>
<P>
The fear of Germany is deeply ingrained in the Soviet psyche, and Germany's 
postwar division and continued stationing of Soviet troops there is considered 
by the Soviets to be a triumph of their foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, opposition to unity is strong, especially within the military and 
among conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials believe, however, that there is little Moscow can do to block 
either unification or German membership in NATO. 
</P>
<P>
Genscher noted that the Helsinki Final Act guarantees every state the right to 
make its own decisions on whether to join any alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Senior U.S. officials said that the Soviet Union could, if it wished, stall the 
two-plus-four process, but even if this ended in deadlock, that could not 
prevent either German reunification or German membership in NATO. 
</P>
<P>
"By not acting, the rest of the world does not stop," one official said.

THE TIMES POLL; 
</P>
<P>
LEAD INCREASES FOR FEINSTEIN AS SUPPORT WIDENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON, TIMES SACRAMENTO BUREAU CHIEF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having broadened her base of support, Dianne Feinstein now leads John K. Van de 
Kamp by 13 percentage points with just one month to go in their race for the 
Democratic gubernatorial nomination, according to The Los Angeles Times Poll. 
</P>
<P>
The contest appears to be changing dramatically as the June 5 election nears. 
The "gender gap" has become less of a factor than it was a few weeks ago, 
interviews showed. Women still support Feinstein strongly, but more men also 
are moving into her camp. 
</P>
<P>
The former San Francisco mayor likewise has broadened her base geographically. 
She now is backed by every major region of the state. In fact, she is running 
as well in Los Angeles County as in her native Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
Voters are turning their attention to the long race as the finish approaches -- 
and as the candidates campaign more aggressively in public and pour millions 
into television and radio commercials. People are starting to focus on the 
candidates' messages and becoming less inclined to choose sides based solely on 
instant reflex -- "She's a woman" or "He's from L.A." 
</P>
<P>
The Times poll found Feinstein to be leading Atty. Gen. Van de Kamp among 
registered Democrats by 37% to 24%, with a large 39% still undecided. This 
represents little change from a Times survey in late March, when Feinstein held 
an 11-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, an early April survey conducted by Mervin Field's California Poll 
showed the two candidates to be running virtually even. 
</P>
<P>
The Times poll found additional good news for Feinstein: Her lead increases 
among those voters considered the most likely to cast ballots. For example, 
projecting a turnout of half the registered Democrats -- which is somewhat 
higher than in recent gubernatorial primaries -- Feinstein's lead edges up to 
15 points. 
</P>
<P>
On another high-stakes political issue, The Times poll for the first time found 
voters to be supporting Proposition 111, which would double the gasoline tax 
over a 5-year period and raise the state spending limit to finance the lion's 
share of an $18.5-billion transportation development plan. Voters favored the 
measure by 47% to 40%, with 13% undecided. 
</P>
<P>
A companion ballot measure, Proposition 108, which would authorize a $1-billion 
bond issue to pay for light-rail transit, was supported by a much larger 
margin: 63% to 23% with 14% undecided. 
</P>
<P>
The Times poll, directed by I.A. Lewis, interviewed 1,732 registered voters by 
telephone for six days ending Thursday night. Among those surveyed were 792 
Democrats and 694 Republicans, plus 246 independents and members of minor 
parties. The margin of error for all voters is three percentage points in 
either direction. For either the Democrats or Republicans separately, the error 
margin is five points. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson long ago virtually clinched the Republican gubernatorial 
nomination by scaring off any major opposition in the primary. And he now is 
running virtually even with either of the potential Democratic nominees in 
hypothetical November matchups, the survey showed. 
</P>
<P>
The Times poll found Democratic women preferring Feinstein over Van de Kamp by 
17 points. But men also favored her by nine points, a significant increase 
since the previous Times survey. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein led by 13 points in Los Angeles County, Van de Kamp's home turf, 
where he once served as district attorney and has always had high name 
recognition because of the bakery chain his family founded. She was up by eight 
points in the rest of Southern California and by 10 points in the Bay Area. But 
by far her biggest strength was in the rest of Northern California, where she 
led by 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
The 56-year-old Feinstein has benefited politically from her hard-line 
positions on both the death penalty and abortion rights. She strongly advocates 
each and this places her in the mainstream of Democratic voters, the survey 
showed. 
</P>
<P>
Among Democrats, 46% said they both "favor abortion" and "the death penalty for 
murderers." And among these mainstreamers, Feinstein led Van de Kamp by 21 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, 54, personally opposes abortion and the death penalty. But he 
supports a woman's right to decide for herself whether to have an abortion and 
has pledged to carry out the death penalty if he is elected governor. These 
seeming conflicts between personal beliefs and public positions, however, 
confuse many voters and leave them skeptical, previous Times surveys have 
found. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest poll, only 13% of Democratic voters both supported abortion and 
opposed capital punishment, the liberal positions advocated by most party 
leaders. These voters gave Feinstein only a slight edge. A more conservative 
group that both opposed abortion and favored capital punishment represented 16% 
of the Democratic Party. And among these voters, the candidates were running 
virtually even. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Democratic voters favored abortion by 5 to 2 and supported the death 
penalty by more than 3 to 1, the survey showed. 
</P>
<P>
The Times poll also was told by nearly three-fourths of the registered voters 
interviewed that they would be willing to have their taxes raised for certain 
specific purposes -- a level of public acquiescence that might surprise elected 
officials who still fear the prospect of renewed uprisings from the tax revolt 
of the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
For example, 51% said they would accept a tax increase for education. Among 
other problems deemed worthy of tax increases were crime (44%), the environment 
(39%), health care (38%), the homeless (37%) and affordable housing (34%). 
</P>
<P>
The disquieting news for Gov. George Deukmejian and the coalition of political, 
business and labor leaders pushing Proposition 111 was that voters appeared to 
be lukewarm toward the idea of increasing taxes for transportation development. 
Only 30% supported the idea. 
</P>
<P>
And leaving aside both Propositions 111 and 108, there was only tepid support 
for the concept of raising taxes to pay for either new road construction or 
mass transportation systems. Voters tended to prefer keeping transportation 
taxes at their present level, though they were a bit more inclined to support 
tax increases for public transit than for highways. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Times poll found evidence that it is not the prospect of a gas tax 
increase, per se, that bothers voters the most about Proposition 111. By 5 to 
1, they said their "greatest concern" about the sweeping proposal is not the 
prospect of paying higher taxes at the gas pump, but of not having these new 
taxes "spent wisely" by state government. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly four in 10 people described their local traffic as "very congested." One 
in five said they have "seriously thought about moving" to escape congestion. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps thinking of last October's devastating Bay Area earthquake, voters 
by 3 to 1 placed a higher priority on repairing old highways to make them safer 
than they did on building new freeways to ease traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Voters also tended to be a bit hypocritical about all this. On the one hand, 
they said the "most important" transportation problem is "too many cars on the 
streets." On the other hand, four in 10 reported that they "drive alone on the 
freeways most of the time." A majority, however, said they would use a rail 
transit system if one were available. 
</P>
<P>
As for Proposition 111, voters were divided about equally on it in Los Angeles 
County, which has become a nationwide symbol of traffic congestion. In the Bay 
Area, however, where traffic tie-ups are just as bad, voters were backing the 
measure by 19 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats were supporting the proposal by 15 points, but Republicans were about 
equally divided. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 108, the companion $1-billion bond measure for rail transit, was 
receiving big support throughout the state -- 3 to 1 in Southern California, 3 
to 1 in the Bay Area and more than 2 to 1 in the rest of Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
But voters are divided about evenly on a rival measure, Proposition 116, which 
would authorize a $1.9-billion bond issue for commuter rail systems. 
</P>
<P>
And while the electorate has started focusing on the gubernatorial race, it 
still seems to be ignoring other statewide contests, such as the Democratic 
nomination for attorney general. In that battle, Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Ira 
Reiner is leading San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith by 24% to 16%, with 60% 
undecided. The bulk of Reiner's backing -- 59% -- comes from Los Angeles 
County. But Smith's support is more evenly divided around the state.

ROUTE 66 THE MOTHER ROAD BY MICHAEL WALLIS (ST. MARTIN'S PRESS: $29.95; 256 
PP.; 0-312-04049-0) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Patrick Carr, Carr is author of Sunshine States and Gun People (both from 
Doubleday). An old-time Village Voice and Rolling Stone contributor, the 
British-born writer is now indulging one of his great passions as 
editor-at-large of Country Music magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You're heading southwest out of Springfield, Ill., on old 66 -- the Mother 
Road, as John Steinbeck called it once and Michael Wallis calls it often -- 
when you come on Our Lady of the Highways. 
</P>
<P>
She's nothing much, really, but she's really something. A statue of the Virgin 
set in an alcove on the edge of a cornfield by the side of the road, she's 
advertised by a series of hand-painted signs leading you phrase by phrase 
through the Hail Mary along half a mile of fence posts. Schoolchildren made 
those signs, and dreamed up the Virgin and paid for her in 1959 (she cost $400 
shipped from Italy, plus another $500 for the construction of her grotto), and 
the farmer who gave her a piece of his cornfield back then is still taking care 
of her today. 
</P>
<P>
An item about Our Lady of the Highways: When the Interstate came in, blowing 
the communities along this section of Route 66 back into the socioeconomic 
equivalent of the previous century, the Feds wanted the signs taken off those 
fence posts. Devotional hand-lettering and modern superhighways, they felt 
quite rightly, do not mix. But the signs were four inches inside the farmer's 
property line, and the farmer wasn't an easily intimidated sort, so today you 
can still read that sequential Hail Mary and view Our Lady of the Highways. If, 
that is, you're not in a hurry to get somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
But then, if you were in a hurry, you wouldn't be on old 66 in the first place, 
would you? 
</P>
<P>
So why would you be? Well, as Michael Wallis' opening line observes, "Route 66. 
Just the name is magic." That it is; those double sixes roll fast and snappy 
with a gambler's edge, a certain smooth swagger perfect for the first (and 
American) internal-combustion century. And then also there's "Route 66. An 
inspiration to literature, music, drama, art, and a nation of dreamers," which 
it certainly has been. And there's the highway as "truly a road of phantoms and 
dreams" which was "fashioned from vision and ingenuity." There's a great deal 
else besides -- Wallis is really gunning the gush here, honking his hyperbole 
-- until, finally, the promotional prose concentrates itself into two themes 
which will accompany your whole long ride. 
</P>
<P>
The first theme is "Diners and cafes with big-boned waitresses. Waitresses who 
served up burgers, plate lunches and homemade pie. Waitresses with coffeepots 
welded to their fists. Waitresses with handkerchiefs and corsages pinned to 
their bosoms. Waitresses, like Steinbeck's Mae, who called everybody 'Honey,' 
winked at the kids, and yelled at the cook." 
</P>
<P>
Waitresses, in fact, for 2,400 burger-studded miles, all the way from downtown 
Chicago to Palisades Park at the foot of Santa Monica Blvd., just yards short 
of the Pacific. (That's the turf of Route 66, the continent's first paved 
connection between Lake Michigan and the ocean.) Waitresses beckoning you on 
through eight states, your accumulated distance consumed by the expectation of 
their ribs, dogs, custards, pies, fries, or, in the westerly reaches at least, 
burritos, tacos and beans. 
</P>
<P>
That's how it is in Wallis' book, and that's how it was in reality throughout 
many years of 66's pre-eminence, a series of greasy redolences motivating 
generations forward: Kerouac wanna-be's looking for America, the Beaver in the 
back seat on the traffic-jammed holiday road, millions getting their first 
sight of mountains, deserts and ultimately ocean. Perhaps not, however, the 
earlier Okies taking Steinbeck's "road of flight" to Bakersfield and beyond, or 
soldiers and sailors heading for hell in the Pacific; the burger heaven whose 
memory is still tangible along 66's now broken ribbon wasn't fully in place 
until the early 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
Wallis' journey leapfrogs from meal to meal, then, and between excursions into 
skeletal communities and phantom tourist traps and the odd still-cooking 
enterprise (the Pig Hip Restaurant in Illinois, Tulsa's Metro Diner, Lillian 
Redman's justly praised Blue Swallow Motel in Tucumcari) he samples what real 
all-American road food remains available and reports his experiences 
faithfully. On the worth and wonder of what food has vanished, he can only 
speculate, and he does that too. 
</P>
<P>
The second theme of the book emerges from all this shifting gastronomy, these 
ghostburgers and big-boned waitresses and their surrounding Americana. From 
beginning to end, Wallis equates Route 66 with a familiar nostalgicist's 
package: the combination of small-town culture, high personal individuality, 
low technology and crime rates, and other pleasant attributes which make up the 
generally agreed-upon family version of Yesteryear's U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
He mines this vein with a vigor leading almost to exhaustion, and doesn't stop 
there; we're also hard-sold the proposition that the modernity supposedly 
visited upon us by the Interstates which replaced Route 66 -- the fast food, 
the cultural standardization, the shopping malls, the small-boned waitresses -- 
is deeply regrettable. 
</P>
<P>
So two-lane 66, completely paved from Chicago to the ocean by 1937 and 
completely bypassed by 1984, was once the great western artery of the national 
vitality and is now an all-American treasure to be preserved and honored, while 
I-55 and the rest are conduits of pestilence. OK? 
</P>
<P>
OK, so relax and go with it. At those points where Wallis' efforts to make and 
remake his point overheat his honest but somewhat under-horsed creative engine 
(usually at significant junctures like chapter endings), you can always look 
out the window. The roadside vistas he gives us in pictures old and new (many 
of the new ones made by his wife, Susan Fitzgerald Wallis) are at least half 
the trip. 
</P>
<P>
And what a trip it is, as indeed it used to be when it was taken in reality; 
the Mother Road was a mother in more ways than one. Here, for instance, while 
we're somewhere close to getting out of Illinois, we have Wallis telling us 
that there were "only a few inches and a cigarette paper between you and death 
on Route 66," and there were "wrecks with victims so badly mangled that they 
begged state troopers to shoot them and end their misery." He may not be 
exaggerating, either, because farther on, in Arizona, we have a former 
tow-truck driver saying: "I got tired of those wrecks. When the interstate came 
along and traffic slowed down, a gentleman stopped and asked what I was going 
to do, and I said, 'Stand in the middle of the highway and shout GLORY! at the 
top of my lungs.' " A sole dissenting voice on the interstate vs. 66 issue, 
this; elsewhere, the charms, quirks and violences of the Mother Road are much 
more warmly remembered. 
</P>
<P>
Here, for instance, are the Phillips 66 Highway Hostesses smiling for the 
camera in 1939. These engaging and responsible women, plainly but smartly 
uniformed, "cruised the highway providing assistance to motorists and inspected 
rest rooms for cleanliness." They carried neither guns nor gas masks -- yes, it 
was indeed another age -- and there were of course six of them, not five or 
seven. The hostesses owed their jobs, incidentally, to an Oklahoman (Frank 
Phillips, the oilman of Michael Wallis' last book, "Oilman"), just as Route 66 
itself was born from the ambition of a booster of that state, Cy Avery, and 
first embedded in the public imagination by the artful work of others: Lon 
Scott, Andy Payne, Jack Culbreath, Will Rogers. Even today, says one of what is 
evidently a small legion of admiring "roadologists," "Oklahoma is where it's at 
as far as Route 66 goes." 
</P>
<P>
Many other points of interest elsewhere, though: the Mother Road running 
through Illinois and Missouri and Arkansas into Oklahoma along the 19th-Century 
telegraph route, the old Wire Road ripped down and repaired again and again and 
again in the War Between The States; the genuinely cavernous Meramec Caverns of 
Missouri, claimed rather tentatively as one of Jesse James' hiding places and 
quite authoritatively as the birthplace of the self-adhesive promotional bumper 
sticker; the more grimly ghostly Arizona cave where in 1874 a band of Apache 
raiders and their Navajo women captives were trapped and burned to death by the 
women's husbands and brothers; Gallup, N. M., where later concentrations of 
Native Americans, publicly alcoholic, earned the town the name "Drunk City" and 
got it included on Mother Teresa's list of the world's forsaken places; the 
highway's many red-light districts and overnight or hourly passion pits (the 
originals -- the motor court was a 66 invention); and their opposite, those 
long, dry, lonely Western runs for which you really needed the canvas water 
bags you could buy and hang on your door handles; and of course their opposite, 
the dreaded Jericho Gap west of Groom, Tex., where rain and mud combined into a 
seasonal gumbo which made wreckers rich; and more, more, more, fully half a 
hardscrabble continent's jumble of still-raw history. Sometimes in fact there 
are so many stories and histories, and such a clamor of long-ignored voices 
from the sides of this bypassed road that you're grateful for Wallis' regular 
feed stops. A strawberry milkshake quiets the ghosts, a griddle is home in any 
largeness. 
</P>
<P>
It's that kind of feeling which distinguishes Wallis' book, that uniquely 
American sense of a past still young and wild and accessible, of all the 
national times and deeds and souls not very far away yet. Often all you need to 
see this history is a slightly different angle on the everyday. That's what 
Wallis has given us, and quite nicely too.

PLANTING FOR A DRY DECADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILI SINGER, Singer, host of The Garden Show on KCRW (National Public Radio 
at 88.9 FM), is a horticultural consultant and a contributing editor to 
Southern California Home and Garden magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As we move into "The Decade of the Environment" and the fourth year of serious 
drought, Southern California gardeners' priorities are shifting. Water-hungry 
plants fall out of favor and local landscapes take on a new character. Softer, 
less flashy plant palettes emerge, consisting of low maintenance, 
drought-tolerant plants -- creating gardens more suited to present-day 
lifestyles and to the dry, Mediterranean climate in which we live. 
Unfortunately, practical guides and references specific to Southland gardening 
and the changes at hand are scarce. 
</P>
<P>
With a glut of gardening books hitting the market monthly, book-buying can be 
an expensive, and often disappointing, venture. Few books earn a spot on my 
already overstuffed shelves. 
</P>
<P>
Hooray for Henry Art's The Wildflower Gardener's Guide: California, Desert 
Southwest, and Northern Mexico Edition (A Garden Way Publishing Book/Storey 
Communications, Inc.: $22.95 cloth, $12.95, paper; 176 pp., illustrated). It 
beautifully fills a cavernous gap. This new book is a well researched and 
comprehensive handbook for growing stunning, colorful annual and perennial 
wildflowers of the dry Western regions. Art, a biology professor from the East, 
came West and did his homework. He enlisted the guidance of Southwest experts, 
commissioned the work of talented illustrators, asked lots of questions and 
compiled the answers neatly into an accessible and much needed guide. 
</P>
<P>
This reasonably priced, oversized paperback is a necessary companion to Bob 
Perry's "Trees and Shrubs for Dry California Landscapes," the current standard 
reference on backbone plants for water-conserving gardens. Where Perry's book 
neglects the fanciful, Art spotlights the whimsical, sometimes ephemeral beauty 
of wildflowers. 
</P>
<P>
The design is clean and relaxed; the type face very graceful and easy on the 
eye. 
</P>
<P>
The book begins with explanations of basic botany, culture and propagation in 
straightforward, friendly language, accessible to lay gardeners. Various 
horticultural treatments are suggested, including the use of wildflowers in 
beds and borders, rock gardens, meadows, chaparral gardens, and firescaping. 
</P>
<P>
Splendid charts make it easy to cross-reference between species and to compose 
plant communities, respecting important characteristics such as plant color and 
size, flowering progression, light conditions, hardiness, soil composition and 
soil moisture. Design aspects, technical planning, irrigation and conversion to 
"xeriscape" (desert terrain), however, are more completely covered by recently 
published Ortho and Sunset books. Indeed, this book should be used in 
conjunction with other resources. (Be sure to check out public gardens and 
agencies which sponsor xeriscape workshops.) 
</P>
<P>
Southwestern wildflowers are featured in a gallery of color photos. Effect 
falls a tad short of intent, as dual photos of each species do not always 
portray the contrast between a bug's-eye view of the flower and growth habits 
of the plant in a landscape situation. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, however, the book shines again. Beautiful botanical illustrations 
by Hyla M. Skudder are coupled with complete descriptions of each species. This 
section is chock full of horticultural history and amazing facts about life 
cycles, culture and uses, and propagation techniques, including tips for 
companion planting with these wonderfully resilient plants. Incidentally, in 
addition to English and Spanish common names, the author quite properly 
includes Native American names. 
</P>
<P>
"The Wildflower Gardener's Guide" is representative of new, evolved, realistic 
thinking in horticulture. Henry Art encourages gardeners to know and understand 
their local ecology (climate, soils, pH, and other environmental factors) so 
that they can choose plants which will be most successful in these conditions. 
This essential book helps gardeners learn how to work with nature, not against 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Another entry in the new wave of dry-landscape books is Taylor's Guide to 
Water-Saving Gardening (Houghton Mifflin: $16.95, paper; 440 pp., illustrated). 
Latest in a long series of well produced Eastern-generated gardening manuals, I 
found the information too general and too wide in its geographical emphasis. 
Introductory details on preparation, planting and water-saving fundamentals are 
adequate and well written. Myriad plant subjects are showcased, in an 
encyclopedia with line drawings and in a section of color plates. 
</P>
<P>
Most lacking, however, in this and other books that canvas plants for the 
entire country is a system of regional notation. All areas of the country would 
be better served by a simple key to uses in various ecological zones, as 
opposed to classification solely by USDA hardiness zones. Gardeners are too 
often left confused and frustrated, searching for good plants only to find they 
are unsuitable for their soils or climate. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's Guides are handy-sized paperbacks, always well researched and richly 
illustrated. This one makes a noble stab at addressing a national need for 
water awareness. But what Southern Californians really crave are locally 
produced books which focus on species best suited to our many unique 
environments. 
</P>
<P>
As local as local can be is The Los Angeles Times Planning and Planting the 
Garden by Robert Smaus (Harry N. Abrams: $29.95, cloth; 176 pp., illustrated). 
</P>
<P>
As garden editor of The Times, Smaus is prolific and dedicated to sharing the 
latest in garden design, technique and taste. His current book recounts 
personal forays into Southern California gardening. It is a good beginner's 
book -- non-intimidating and working the new gardener from a macro to a micro 
view of building a garden from the ground up. 
</P>
<P>
The book especially glows when Smaus explains the basic principles of design -- 
perspective, proportion and balance. He stresses the need to leave plenty of 
room for plants to grow and the importance of using green plants for structure 
and contrast with seasonal color. 
</P>
<P>
He elucidates many of the quirks of gardening in this part of the world. 
However, considering the recent vintage of the book, there's a surprising 
paucity of information and illustration relevant to water-conserving 
landscapes. The photographs are exquisite but, with few exceptions (like the 
medieval-ish "No Lawn at All" design by Chris Rosmini), we're looking at very 
thirsty landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
The book's greatest poetry is found in sections entitled "Plant Portraits" and 
"Garden Visits." The plant portraits are lovely, anecdotal snippets, some from 
Smaus' own gardening journal. Writing of his grandfather's delphiniums, Smaus 
takes us on a sweet remembrance. "More Bulb Stories" recaptures every 
gardener's delight at the treats we reap in spring, six months after planting 
those odd little brown nubbies in the cooling autumn earth. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these pieces have been seen as part of Smaus' regular work in the 
paper. For those who missed them, or those who didn't save them, these features 
are preserved in a handsome clothbound volume. I'll aways be eager to get 
another peek at Nancy Goslee Power's secret sunken garden. 
</P>
<P>
I've little time for Gardening America: Regional and Historical Influences in 
the Contemporary Garden by Ogden Tanner (Viking Studio Books/Viking Penguin: 
$40, cloth; 255 pp., illustrated), which left me unsatisfied. According to 
Tanner, the "roots" of American gardening are no deeper than the arrival of 
settlers on the North American continent. A poshly pictorial travelogue fleshed 
out with words, Tanner's idea is to show how native landscapes and plants blend 
with imported cultural and horticultural histories to create distinct garden 
styles in each region. 
</P>
<P>
My question: How can this book purport to explain a synthesis of culture and 
the land when no mention is ever made of the Native Americans whose plains and 
hillsides were invaded and ravaged? Not once does Tanner mention their 
medicinal use of native plants. We do not learn, even in the chapter on edible 
landscapes, that as far back as 5000 BC, Native Americans began domesticating 
native plants, planting edible greens, berries, nuts and roots in their 
gardens; that by 2000 BC, they were planting and harvesting corn (maize), beans 
and squash, brought up from Mexico; that by 1000 BC, these expert 
horticulturists had hybridized a corn that is the precursor to varieties we 
grow and eat today. Nor does he make reference to Native American beliefs in 
nature as God itself -- a concept surely antithetical to Puritan belief 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
The photos are marvelous and some of Tanner's prose is captivating: "Agaves . . 
. seem to sprout from the sand like frozen fountains." But in the end, 
"Gardening America" is a pricy tome which Western gardeners will buy only if 
they happen to be nostalgic for the East, or the past. 
</P>
<P>
A Gentle Plea for Chaos -- the title alone catches the attention. Mirabel 
Osler's book (subtitled "The Enchantment of Gardening"; Simon and Schuster: 
$22.95, cloth; 176 pp., illustrated) grabs the reader with a hook stronger than 
steel. There are no fancy new ideas here, no important revelations on gardening 
in a dry climate. Simply the unself-conscious musings of a hands-on, 
hard-working plant lover. 
</P>
<P>
Short essays tie together each central chapter, five in all -- Trees, Water, 
Walls, Roses and Bulbs. Representing these are the bones of Osler's garden. On 
one-and-a-half acres of land, near the Welsh border in Shropshire, England, she 
and her husband have created a garden where any child would be happy, with 
tunnels, bridges, a marsh to explore, lots of hiding places, even a tree house. 
Adults, we learn, find similar peace, joy, and ever-changing delights. Like her 
garden, her writing calls all the senses into play, evolving naturally and 
eschewing order and ostentation. "A mania for neatness," Osler states, "a lust 
for conformity -- and away go atmosphere and sensuality." 
</P>
<P>
Osler loves to garden -- not just to have a garden. She thrives on, and curses, 
the backbreaking work which leads to the garden's greatest benefits. And we are 
privileged to listen to her musings, to hear the click and whir as she ponders 
the answers to her own esoteric questions. 
</P>
<P>
She is opinionated, but not without humor. In her discussion of national 
gardening styles, she asks about the French horticultural penchant for such 
training techniques as pollarding, espalier and cordoning: "Why do the French 
torture trees?" 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated often by her reference to plants that I've never seen, and that are 
impossible to grow in this part of the world, I am still thankful for her 
musings. 
</P>
<P>
A Hobbit-like map of the house and garden, and carefully selected photographs, 
help the reader to put a face on this garden which Mirabel Osler built out of 
love. A sad irony: It is noted at the end that her gardening partner in life, 
Michael, died shortly after the book's completion. Read this one on a hot 
summer day, and then pass it on to a friend.

<TEXT>
<P>
For the life of me I'll never understand why history is so often regarded as a 
dull subject, an endurance test -- that teacher and student alike must trudge 
through until the final date is memorized and the final grade given. If only we 
could all capture the spark of excitement that has so ignited Deborah Nourse 
Lattimore's love for it. 
</P>
<P>
That love is richly displayed, in quite divergent ways, in her two new works, 
"The Dragon's Robe" and "The Lady With The Ship On Her Head." Lattimore 
expresses an affection that could only come from wandering mentally for 
countless hours through historical material for the sheer joy of it. She 
reveals herself most clearly to a fellow historiophile through her meticulous 
attention to accuracy and detail. 
</P>
<P>
"The Dragon's Robe" is an original tale that the author has extracted from 
historical events in 13th-Century China. It concerns Hui Tsung, who was at once 
artist, poet and emperor. 
</P>
<P>
A young, orphaned weaver girl named Kwan Yin after the Chinese Goddess of Mercy 
(a constantly recurring subject in Chinese art) leaves her village to seek work 
at the imperial palace. In her travels she comes upon the aging and ailing 
caretaker of a shrine to the dragon rain god. Taking pity on the old man, who 
has offered her food and shelter, she decides to stay and care for him and his 
beloved shrine. 
</P>
<P>
They are visited in succession by two untrustworthy vassals of the emperor: 
first, Lord Phoenix, overseer of the emperor's rice fields, and then Lord 
Tiger, general of the emperor's army on the Great Wall. Through their greed and 
irresponsibility they manage to incur the wrath of the dragon-god, and havoc 
erupts. 
</P>
<P>
With rice fields burning and Tatars rampaging, the little weaver desperately 
sets to work to appease the dragon-god by weaving a magnificent imperial robe 
and laying it before the shrine. Just as the great Khan, leader of the invading 
Tatars, seizes the newly completed robe, the great dragon springs to life, 
spewing forth torrents of rainwater -- nourishing to the rice fields, fatal to 
the enemy and transformational to Kwan Yin and the old man. His true identity 
is now revealed as the wiser, if wetter, emperor, who invites the good-hearted 
girl to live in his palace. 
</P>
<P>
Lattimore has wisely chosen the art of Chinese screen painting as her 
inspirational source here. The style, to which this book is virtually one 
extended homage, generously accommodates both text and illustration. Her 
paintings are sumptuously rendered with a reverence for authenticity that 
bespeaks the limitless time spent poring over the source material. Nothing else 
could motivate such a skilled and sensitive adaptation. How I envy her hours of 
research looking for the right tree or the right waterfall or the master of 
this painted mountain or that painted face. 
</P>
<P>
She has extended the feeling of this stylization quite effectively to the text 
as well. Its clarity and formal simplicity evoke a wisdom-of-the-ages grace 
while making it accessible for young readers. 
</P>
<P>
From the sublime to the ridiculous is a tempting and almost unavoidable cliche 
at this juncture, as "The Lady With the Ship on Her Head" comes into view. 
Whereas "The Dragon's Robe" evokes the silken serenity of Eastern thought, "The 
Lady With the Ship On Her Head" plays for the belly laughs. Despite the 
dramatic mood swing, the common bond here is history and the pleasure of it. 
</P>
<P>
I remember once as a child thumbing through an encyclopedia and stumbling upon 
a survey that could have been titled "Hair Styles Through the Ages." There in 
the 18th Century was a fancy French court lady with a ship on her head. What 
wonderful, insane society could possibly have provoked this lady to such an 
absurd extreme?, I wondered. My guess is that Lattimore asked herself the same 
question, for she has come up with a delightfully absurd answer. 
</P>
<P>
Madame Pompenstance is in a dither, for she hasn't figured out a "theme" yet 
for the headdress she'll wear for tonight's fancy-dress ball. In desperation 
she scours the beach for something marvelous, or at least adequate, to wear in 
her hair. As she stoops for a particular shell, a miniature three-masted ship, 
complete with crew and captain, sails into port and onto her head. Unaware that 
her problem has solved itself, she notices the onset of a headache which she 
attributes to her worry over the headdress. The subsequent events of her day 
and evening are hilariously affected by this uninvited ornament. I still laugh 
when I think of the sequence when her headache has grown unbearable due to the 
crew dancing and singing sea chanteys on deck after reaping the benefits of a 
glass of rum dumped on Madame Pompenstance's head by one of her jealous rivals. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lattimore's painting style here lacks the finesse of "The Dragon's 
Robe," it serves well for this send-up of the very notion of style itself. Any 
era that would define elegance and sophistication by dressing its ladies as 
birthday cakes is surely ripe for lampooning, and Lattimore doesn't spare the 
ammunition. The vanity and social customs of a time only slightly more 
exaggerated than ours are cheerfully skewered here by someone who truly 
understands the importance of historical silliness. Of all human 
characteristics, nothing is more lovable than the ability to laugh at 
ourselves. And isn't it fun to think that our ancestors could have been just as 
silly as we are? 
</P>
<P>
History's magic happens when we're moved enough by what we see of ourselves in 
those who've gone before that we begin to appreciate the heroism, wonder, and 
(on occasion) the silliness in all of us. Lattimore's books are a loving nudge 
in that direction.

THE CHILDREN'S BOOKSHELF: THE ECOLOGY OF YOUTHFUL MINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kimberly Olson Fakih, Fakih, whose critical guide to children's books will 
be published next year, is a free-lance editor and book reviewer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In their concern for the environment, parents and publishers, like tardy 
teachers on the way to class, are hurriedly unpacking instructive lesson books 
and serviceable charts in the hallowed cause of making the next generation 
responsible keepers of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps in this context the ecology of children's minds should be just as valid 
and hallowed an issue, if only as ground to be prepared for the future. Since 
the time when Hilaire Belloc danced, trod and trampled on the cautionary tale, 
the moralizing approach that used to strip-mine the children's book vein has 
ceased, and this is no time to resurrect it. 
</P>
<P>
As it stands, the only firm rule of the game, intended never to be broken, is 
to root out and abolish preaching -- because if adults don't, children will. 
When it comes to The Issues, all the classroom interrogations, bandwagon 
slogans, "don'ts," "ought to's" and various other smarmy messages that kids 
love to hate may be lost on their intended audience faster than bumper stickers 
on cars speeding down billboard-studded highways. 
</P>
<P>
The best so-called ecology books, then, don't offer children "Keep Off the 
Grass" signs but foster a regard for fragile, budding nature and tender shoots 
of information. If this regard is tended, it may grow with the child, not as a 
list of rigid moral imperatives but as a code of mutual coexistence with all 
and sundry in our one dwelling place. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's asking too much of a book to replicate a child's experience of 
listening to the sobering cry of a loon rising off a lake, or viewing a male 
emperor penguin peering at his newly hatched young. But even if only within the 
span of a few illustrated pages, there is no substitute for the precognitive, 
nonverbal communication that takes place when a child gazes back at a creature 
of the wild. Such pictures cultivate in children neither pity nor fear toward 
the environment and its inhabitants, but give them the chance to see in 
nature's survival or destruction their own destiny. The next generation may yet 
find out that man is not, after all, the measure of all things. 
</P>
<P>
All the books in this survey, ennobled by their sincerity, aim to communicate 
to the best of their abilities. Some are imperfect, beleaguered by their 
missions. Others use the ever-welcome gentle touch and circumspection; these 
(happily, a majority) do not see in children another frontier for willful 
conditioning and are not anxious to endow them with the imprint of civilized 
man. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its awkward message, Hey! Get Off Our Train (Crown: $14.95; 
unpaginated) shows that John Burningham, at least as an illustrator, is at his 
peak. His familiar landscapes, comical and loose-lined, give way to 
coal-country, soot-colored skies and impressionistic vistas of a sojourn by 
train. But Burningham's usual rebelliousness, so enticing to his regular 
readers, in this book turns to pedantry. A boy commandeers a train through a 
lesson-filled dream time. One by one, endangered animals expound on why their 
days are numbered as they seek passage on the train. 
</P>
<P>
A similar burden of soap-box oratory undermines the unmistakable worth of The 
Great Kapok Tree by Lynne Cherry (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich: $14.95; 
unpaginated), whose other illustrations (including those in books for the World 
Wildlife Fund series on endangered animals) have been moral-free. Splendid 
paintings in tropical colors accompany the story of a young man sent into the 
rain forest to chop down a Kapok tree. After a carefully choreographed pelting 
of pleas by various animals, the man's eyes are opened: He tosses down his ax 
-- perhaps to the detriment of the carpenters' guilds, but environmental 
concerns take precedence over all here -- and walks away. 
</P>
<P>
In Barbara Juster Esbensen's Great Northern Diver: The Loon, illustrated by 
Mary Barrett Brown (Little, Brown: $14.95; 32 pp.), readers meet a graceful 
bird, clumsy only on takeoff, who hits airborne speeds of 60 m.p.h. The author 
sets forth a straightforward rendering of facts and refers to the need for 
loons' solitude in one slim sentence: "On a hidden lake there is little chance 
of being disturbed by motorboats coming close to the nest." After the loons 
migrate, the sky darkens and the nest fills with snow. It's a sorrowful sight, 
that empty home, similar to the hollow cabins that line frozen lakes through 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Thornhill's The Wildlife ABC (Simon &amp; Schuster: $14.95; unpaginated) 
never preaches an ecological cause but tantalizes children first with light 
verse accompanying an ABC listing of animals (similar to the author's "The 
Wildlife l-2-3") and then with a section of "Nature Notes" full of intriguing 
facts: "A is for Auk/who lives by the sea" is later shored up by a poignant 
description of the last of the Great Auks. The woodcut-like portraits abound 
with humorous, human touches; Thornhill includes people in her pictures, taking 
wildlife out of a remote realm and depicting it as close as a housefly 
dive-bombing the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
By creating an environment in which readers come to care for emperor and Adelie 
penguins and Weddell seals, Helen Cowcher's Antarctica (Farrar, Straus &amp; 
Giroux: $13.95; unpaginated) conveys an affecting, subtle message about the 
disturbance of habitat. With their inherent sense of justice, children will be 
shattered by the forced, sudden flight of the Adelies at the sounds of 
helicopters; their eggs are thus exposed to predators. The antarctic 
inhabitants are strikingly stylized solid shapes living among a grayed 
blue-white wilderness; concepts of "home" and "family" are a tacit part of the 
story, as is the unsentimentalized nurturing found in the wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
In Weather by Howard E. Smith, illustrated by Jeffrey Bedrick (Doubleday: 
$10.95; 45 pp.), it's not fear but awe that hurls children into direct 
communion with nature. Information about the theory of global warming is 
incorporated into a simple but encompassing discussion. The data is offset by 
haunting portraits of nature at work -- tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards -- and 
includes storm safety rules. A clean presentation of information neither cloaks 
the facts nor makes them lessons. 
</P>
<P>
What children know about the natural world is as close as their own beds, 
dinner plates and front doors -- they know that animals, too, sleep, eat, and 
have homes. The books that succeed best are those which -- without blatant 
anthropomorphism -- show children the parallels between their sheltered world 
and the wild, and make the issues at once familiar and personal. And, just 
maybe, young readers will grow to disregard man's itch to tame and urbanize the 
Earth, and will abandon his romantic quest -- on horseback, scythe in hand -- 
to conquer the wild forces of nature.

FIRST FICTION FROM CALIFORNIA;

FAULT LINE BY JO-ANN MAPSON (PACIFIC WRITERS PRESS, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, 
IRVINE, DEPT. OF SPANISH AND PORTUGUESE, IRVINE, CALIF. 92717: PRICE NOT SET; 
144 PP.)

<P>
One of the virtuoso techniques of short-story writing is to make the ordinary 
seem extraordinary. Jo-Ann Mapson exercises a variation on this technique. The 
13 stories in this collection focus on ordinary people in ordinary situations 
-- housewives, hospital patients, college students -- and cut recognizable, 
short-story-size slices from their daily lives. Each story reveals a moment 
where the hero understands something about his or her life: he is doomed to 
repeat this habit forever, or this detail is what gives her life meaning. The 
title of the collection, "Fault Line," since it is not one of the story titles, 
presumably refers to the invisible cracking under the surface of daily life; it 
is a familiar short-story theme, and Jo-Ann Mapson gives it a competent 
workout. 
</P>
<P>
The extraordinariness about Mapson's writing, however, begins to sink in once 
you've read several of these stories: It's that all these characters are so 
different. While each is vivid in a quiet way, when they are considered 
together, they take on lives of their own, as if they all live in separate 
universes; and all these universes exist inside one writer's head, extrapolated 
from a few observed details. 
</P>
<P>
"The Red Nightie Network" presents three mothers who meet over coffee. They are 
friends because they are neighbors, but also because each has a child with a 
serious medical problem: asthma, a blood-clotting disorder, cystic fibrosis. 
"Sometimes I feel like I'm raising a dying child," one mother observes. The 
threesome find temporary relief in a shared secret: a flimsy red nightgown that 
each tries out on her husband. In the very next story, "First Chair," Mapson 
takes on the voice of an 11-year-old girl playing fourth-chair violin in a 
school orchestra. She conceives a passionate hatred for the first-chair 
violinist and conductor's pet: "His elbows, knots of bone larger than his upper 
arms, would always lift too high and the conductor would deposit a junior-sized 
rage on the entire section, rather than single out his favored student." 
(Although this character doesn't really talk like a child, the intensity of 
pre-adolescent feeling sounds unnervingly accurate.) 
</P>
<P>
The author's ability to create distinct worlds becomes obvious in a pair of 
stories about a couple. First she examines the man's point of view, then the 
woman's; he is introspective and too much under his parents' influence, while 
she is earthy and rather ferocious. Mapson's stories are nice enough in 
themselves, but the cumulative effect inspires admiration.

FIRST FICTION FROM CALIFORNIA; 
</P>
<P>
REUNION BY RITA WRIGHTON (FITHIAN PRESS, P.O. BOX 1525, SANTA BARBARA, CA 
93102: $16.95; 256 PP.) 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Beginning with the thought that nobody ever forgets who they first saw 
"Casablanca" with, readers of Rita Wrighton's first novel find themselves in 
unadulterated romance territory. We are also in local haunts: at the Woodland 
Hills Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
The year is 1982, and we are celebrating the 38th reunion of Dorsey High School 
in Baldwin Hills. There is none of the discomfort here, though, of people who 
don't quite fit in. High school sweethearts Carrie Donovan and Tom Cartwell 
meet again amid a clamor of old buddies who haven't moved a moment out of sync 
in four decades. Conveniently divorced and widowed, respectively, Carrie and 
Tom are free to reminisce about their youth, a nostalgic world where men had 
manners and theater tickets were always to be had in the first few rows. 
</P>
<P>
Their rekindled romance is cemented when they almost lose each other through an 
accident too improbable to divulge without the running start the book provides. 
In the end, of course, Mr. and Mrs. Charming meet at the altar in a 
picture-perfect wedding, as much in love as their younger selves, but better 
equipped to appreciate what they have. 
</P>
<P>
Wrighton's pretty fantasy has one final twist: an epilogue in which yet another

<P>
Harvey Edwards had a stroke three months after he was sent to prison in 1987 
for child molestation. Now 60, he is confined to a wheelchair and is mostly 
blind. 
</P>
<P>
He takes two insulin shots a day for diabetes and from 16 to 32 pills a day for 
his heart and high blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"I just sit or stay in bed and sleep mostly," Edwards said. "It's like two 
different people -- the one they arrested and the one they've got locked up 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards and perhaps as many as 400 other chronically ill and elderly prisoners 
fill the hospital at the Louisiana State Prison and overflow into the general 
population. They cost taxpayers millions of dollars annually and remain behind 
bars while more dangerous prisoners are turned out, said Tulane University law 
professor Jonathan Turley. 
</P>
<P>
"We're reaching what I call institutional meltdown," Turley said. "We can't 
build cells fast enough to keep up with the growing population. We must work 
out a system to release less-dangerous prisoners -- geriatric, low-risk 
prisoners -- to make room for younger, dangerous ones." 
</P>
<P>
Turley is the founder of Tulane's Project for Older Prisoners (POPS), believed 
to be the first in the nation to deal exclusively with elderly prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
The percentage of elderly prisoners is relatively small now but it is growing 
rapidly, Turley said. Nationally, there are about 20,000 prisoners over 55, and 
he expects that to double by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't house all the prisoners who are coming into the system," Turley said. 
"People will be released. It just makes sense to release the low-risk ones, the 
ones least likely to commit a new crime." 
</P>
<P>
A Bureau of Justice Statistics report in 1989 found age to be the single most 
reliable indicator in predicting recidivism. 
</P>
<P>
"Statistics show that prisoners between 18 and 24 have a recidivism rate of 
about 22% within a year of their release," Turley said. "A prisoner over 45 has 
only about a 2% rate of recidivism." 
</P>
<P>
Forty-two states and the District of Columbia are under court order to reduce 
prison crowding. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989 a record number of new cells were constructed nationwide to handle the 
population overflow, Turley said. 
</P>
<P>
"Prisons are becoming our fastest-growing industry but they aren't keeping pace 
with the population," he said. "In 1988 we built more jail cells in this 
country than any other country in history. We had a 5.2% increase in prison 
cells. At the same time the prison population expanded at the rate of 7.4%." 
</P>
<P>
In the federal system the cost will be $3.8 billion to $5.5 billion for the 
estimated 57,000 to 83,000 new cells needed by 1997, Turley said. By the year 
2000, a new cell will cost a projected $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is widespread, with different states trying various versions of 
early release programs. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana will need almost 4,700 more beds by 1995. Of the more than 12,000 
state prisoners, nearly 4,000 are in parish (county) jails, forcing prisoners 
there to be released early to avoid overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
The state now has 16,000 outstanding felony warrants but arrests are not being 
made because the state has no place to put the prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
In New Orleans, Sheriff Charles Foti has been releasing prisoners charged with 
misdemeanors and minor felonies to make room in the jail. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana imposed a one-week moratorium last summer on new prison admissions, 
then enacted a policy to accept prisoners only on a space-available basis. The 
Legislature is considering spending $56 million on a new 650-bed prison. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee has been under court order since 1982 to reduce crowding and upgrade 
its prisons. The state's early-release policies prompted a $250-million project 
to build six new prisons and a sentence reform law last year that reduced time 
in jail for many nonviolent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Montana's prison has had chronic overcrowding. Currently 1,100 prisoners are in 
a facility designed for 744. State law allows early eligibility for parole when 
the prison exceeds capacity for more than 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon has released prisoners early for years. The state also has a rotating 
bunk system, whereby an inmate is released for seven days while another takes 
his bunk. When the first inmate returns, someone else is released for a week. 
</P>
<P>
Last year in April the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles began an emergency 
early release of 3,000 prisoners to avert a threatened federal lawsuit. 
Georgia's prisons were about 110% over capacity, with 4,000 state prisoners 
backed up in county jails. By September, it had dropped to 40% over capacity, 
with 1,400 prisoners backed up. 
</P>
<P>
However, while the release program was going on, Georgia still recorded a 4.8% 
increase in prisoners in the first six months of 1989, reaching 20,000 
prisoners and climbing. 
</P>
<P>
Under the POPS program, 200 Tulane University law students are compiling 
medical and legal histories of all Louisiana inmates 55 and older. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana has 799 prisoners who are 60 or older, said Martha Jumonville of the 
Department of Corrections. As of December, 1989, 1,989 prisoners faced 
sentences of life, 266 faced 99 years and 928 faced between 35 and 98 years. 
</P>
<P>
Other than medical furloughs for the severely disabled, there are no special 
provisions for releasing the elderly or impaired, Jumonville said. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer than 10 medical furloughs have been granted in the last year, prison 
officials say. To qualify, a prisoner must be recommended by the warden and 
medical staff and must be permanently incapacitated or expected to die within 
six months, said Jane Bankston, a consultant to the secretary of corrections. 
</P>
<P>
They must also have someone who agrees to care for them and pay all their 
medical expenses, said Deputy Warden Richard Peabody. 
</P>
<P>
Prisoners eligible for parole may apply for consideration every six months. 
Because most of the elderly inmates were sentenced without the possibility of 
parole, they must first apply for a pardon, which can only be done once a year 
and must be granted by the governor. 
</P>
<P>
The average expense for medical care and maintenance for inmates over 55 is 
$69,000 a year, about three times the average for other inmates, Turley said. 
</P>
<P>
"The costs of keeping these men in prison is staggering," Turley said. "The 
suffering it inflicts on the elderly prisoner who can't get proper care and 
lives in fear of younger inmates is appalling."

A HOUSE COULD BE THE PRICE OF A JOINT UNDER FEDERAL ASSET-SEIZURE LAW; 
</P>
<P>
DRUGS: LAST YEAR, THE GOVERNMENT SEIZED $580 MILLION IN CASH AND ASSETS THAT 
WERE ALLEGEDLY LINKED TO COMMISSION OF A CRIME. CRITICS CHARGE THAT THE PENALTY 
IS EXCESSIVE AND UNFAIR.

<P>
Until a sheriff's deputy and federal marshals came to his house near Dayton, 
Ohio, Donald Coulter says that he had no concept of the penalties he faced by 
cultivating a small, back-yard marijuana crop. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was Coulter charged with a felony for growing the 25 plants, the 
government also wants to seize his $50,000 house in a lakeshore subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
Said Coulter, a federal employee with no prior criminal record: "If I'd known 
what they could do to me or what they would do to me, I'd have never planted 
those things." 
</P>
<P>
The action against Coulter is part of the government's asset-forfeiture 
program, a relatively new and, prosecutors say, enormously effective weapon in 
the war on drugs. Although its deterrent effect cannot be quantified, its 
financial success can: Last year, the Department of Justice seized $580 million 
worth of goods and cash. Because of the program's success, the Bush 
Administration wants to expand forfeiture penalties -- which currently cover 
primarily drug, gambling and racketeering violations -- to crimes such as mail 
fraud and wire fraud. 
</P>
<P>
And in mid-April, the department announced that it was considering filing suits 
to freeze assets of corrupt savings and loans officials prior to any criminal 
convictions. 
</P>
<P>
"If we put the kingpins in prison for life, it doesn't do much," said Cary 
Copeland, director of the program. "But if we seize the instrumentalities of 
the drug trade, it's like shutting down a manufacturing plant." 
</P>
<P>
Donald Coulter, however, is no drug kingpin. He says he grew the marijuana for 
his personal use. And pointing to cases like his, criminal defense lawyers and 
civil libertarians say that the forfeiture laws are sometimes abused. Property 
seized can be worth far more than normal criminal penalties would be. The 
owners, some of them not charged with any crime, can wait months to get court 
hearings to have their property returned. Overzealous law enforcement officers, 
seeking to increase their budgets through forfeiture, sometimes use dubious 
methods to seize property, defense attorneys say. 
</P>
<P>
"These people who are growing marijuana, if dragged into state court on a 
criminal charge, will probably get probation," said David Smith, an Alexandria, 
Va., attorney who formerly ran the asset-forfeiture program. "But in the 
federal civil forfeiture case, they'll lose their house. It's a very 
disproportionately severe punishment for the crime." 
</P>
<P>
To begin a forfeiture action, the government seizes a possession based on 
"probable cause" that it was used in the commission of a crime. A hearing is 
held later to determine the true ownership of the property, but the government 
has a lesser standard of proof than is required in a criminal trial. It need 
only prove its case by "a preponderance of the evidence" -- in other words, 51% 
of the evidence -- rather than "beyond a reasonable doubt," which is required 
in a criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
Often there are no hearings at all, according to the Justice Department's 
Copeland. The owners of seized property usually do not come forward to reclaim 
their possessions. "The circumstances of the seizure are so incriminating that 
everybody runs like hell to get away from them," Copeland said. 
</P>
<P>
And in some cases, there are no criminal charges filed against the owner of the 
property, sometimes because they cannot be identified and sometimes because 
sufficient evidence is not gathered against them. In other cases, local 
jurisdictions merely seize assets and forgo bringing criminal charges that 
could lead to costly trials. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of civil forfeiture is not new; it is rooted in English Common law. 
When the U.S. Customs Service was first formed in 1789, it was empowered to 
seize boats used in transporting contraband. 
</P>
<P>
But the use of both civil and criminal forfeiture has been expanded broadly in 
recent years. In the 1970s, Congress authorized criminal forfeiture, which 
requires a finding of guilt, in cases involving racketeering conspiracies and 
against drug kingpins. In 1984, Congress expanded the use of civil forfeiture 
statutes to allow the seizure of real property as well as personal property. 
Civil forfeiture does not require a finding of guilt. 
</P>
<P>
Since that 1984 amendment, Congress has added to the list of crimes in which 
forfeiture can be used. And the Justice Department's asset-seizure fund has 
increased twentyfold, from $27.2 million in 1985 to $580.7 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to cash, cars, boat and airplanes, the government has seized real 
estate, including a brass and aluminum foundry near Milwaukee, a golf course in 
Kalamazoo, Mich., and a nightclub in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Lured by the booty of drug dealers, states have quickly amended their laws to 
allow forfeiture actions by local police and sheriffs' departments, which can 
then retain all the money rather than sharing it with the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most aggressive users of a state asset-forfeiture law is Sheriff 
Robert L. Vogel Jr. of Volusia County, Fla., which includes Daytona Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel made a name for himself by catching drug dealers while he was a Florida 
highway patrolman. Then, in 1988, he handily beat four opponents in a 
countywide election. 
</P>
<P>
Reasoning that if drugs were coming north out of Miami, money must be flowing 
south via Interstate Highway 95, Vogel established a controversial "currency 
interdiction program." 
</P>
<P>
A special team of deputies patrol Interstate Highway 95 (southbound), stopping 
drivers for highway infractions. Then, the deputies ask to search the cars. 
Almost everyone consents to the warrantless search, Vogel says. 
</P>
<P>
Even if there are no drugs in the car, the sheriff's unit will seize cash if 
there is "probable cause" to believe it is drug money. Usually, no criminal 
charges are filed. 
</P>
<P>
Using these methods, Vogel's office has seized more than $3 million in currency 
since March, 1989, from about 100 subjects. The amounts seized range from 
$2,000 to $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
"These aren't your average vacationers going to Disney World," Vogel said. 
</P>
<P>
Within 90 days of the seizure, the sheriff's office files a civil suit to 
legally keep the money. The owners of the money are notified. Half of them 
never contest the seizure, Vogel said. 
</P>
<P>
Dan R. Warren, a former prosecutor in Florida who now defends criminal clients, 
said Vogel's tactics are "like Nazi Germany revisited." He complains that 
Vogel's methods violate 4th Amendment rights against unreasonable searches. 
"I'm not willing to give up my 4th Amendment rights for the drug war," Warren 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, the courts, not immune to public sentiment against drug dealers, 
have upheld the rights of government to seize and keep assets in a wide range 
of cases. 
</P>
<P>
Coulter still faces a day in court on the civil forfeiture proceedings against 
his house, which were filed by the Justice Department at the request of local 
authorities. If the government is successful, most of the proceeds from its 
sale will go to the Greene County (Ohio) Drug Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
In early April, Coulter went before a judge on the felony charge of cultivating 
marijuana. His sentence: A $1,000 fine and 100 hours of community service.

YES, WEST VIRGINIA, THERE'S STILL A JAILHOUSE WITH HOME COOKING

<TEXT>
<P>
At Lee and Terri Frederick's place, guests enjoy old-fashioned home cooking and 
are greeted at breakfast with a friendly "Good morning." 
</P>
<P>
They can watch television, play table tennis in the recreation room, use the 
telephone or entertain visitors in the family garage. 
</P>
<P>
Don't pack your bags for a weekend in the mountains yet. The Fredericks' place 
is the Gilmer County Jail, one of the last of the "mom and pop" lockups. 
</P>
<P>
It is an arrangement closer to "Mayberry R.F.D." than to Attica or San Quentin. 
</P>
<P>
While the inmates dine on Terri Frederick's pasta, pizza or a meat entree in 
their cells upstairs, the family is having the same downstairs. 
</P>
<P>
"I just make extra for the guys upstairs," Terri Frederick said. 
</P>
<P>
Every other Thursday, the couple pulls their 1986 Chrysler out of the garage 
and sets up folding chairs so the inmates can entertain visitors. 
</P>
<P>
The Fredericks' house rules are posted in the jail recreation room: 
</P>
<P>
"Golden Rules: If you open it, close it. If you take it out, lock it up. If it 
will brighten someone's day, SAY IT!" 
</P>
<P>
The couple and their sons, Joey, 6, and Lynn, 2, live in the two-story, 
three-bedroom brick house where the county has placed its detainees for 50 
years. The house is atop a hill between the county courthouse and a Glenville 
State College dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the neighborhood is made up of modest, single-family houses that 
look a lot like the Fredericks' place, except they have no bars on the windows. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Frederick, 29, is a former truck driver who took the job of jailer a year 
ago. Terri, 27, lived in the house as a child while her parents ran the jail. 
She does the cooking and cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
In her spare time, she works as a dispatcher of sheriff's deputies, police, 
ambulances and rescue crews. The living room also is the terminus of alarms 
connected to Glenville's two banks. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, when a night jailer was hired, one of the Fredericks was always 
on duty from 7 a.m. until midnight. After that, prisoners could summon Lee by 
pushing a button on the elevator. 
</P>
<P>
Wall-mounted loudspeakers allow Terri to hear calls when she is working in the 
kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to know what's happening among the inmates because "we can hear them 
right through the ceiling," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Frederick said his sons are not allowed to go upstairs no matter how curious 
they get. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll find out about this stuff soon enough anyway," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On an average day, the jail houses about nine people. The most common reasons 
are drunk driving, destruction of property or game-law violations. 
</P>
<P>
In the evenings, prisoners play table tennis or watch television in the 
family-size recreation room. They have access to the telephone every night, but 
long-distance calls are not allowed. 
</P>
<P>
The homey touches aren't lost on the inmates. 
</P>
<P>
"Lee treats me OK, and the food's all right, but I just don't like being in 
jail," said Carson Yeager, 45, who described himself as a "chronic alcoholic." 
</P>
<P>
Yeager is one of the Fredericks' regulars. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of ours are not hardened criminals," Frederick said. "They don't 
need to be exposed to that type of people." 
</P>
<P>
Some former inmates have even come back to say hello. A 21-year-old man now 
incarcerated elsewhere has written the couple four letters in the last two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Such rural "mom and pop" jails increasingly are being phased out because of 
generally substandard conditions, high maintenance costs and a move toward 
regional jails. 
</P>
<P>
"They are a rapidly dying breed," said Michael O'Toole, chief of the jails 
division of the National Institute of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
More than 19 million people spend time in one of 3,300 county jails each year, 
according to U.S. Justice Department statistics. 
</P>
<P>
"Small jails are not cost-effective," O'Toole said. "Although a lot are 
well-meaning and well-intentioned, the conditions of confinement aren't what 
they should be. A lot are just incapable of being up to standards. 
</P>
<P>
"The operation rises and falls on the integrity of the operator. For each 
example where somebody is fulfilling their responsibility, you can look at 
another side of the ledger and see someone who shouldn't have any authority 
over anybody in custody whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the state Facilities Review Panel warned that it would shut down the 
Fredericks' jail unless Gilmer County expanded its staff. 
</P>
<P>
So Sheriff Kenneth Smith Jr. hired a jailer for the night shift and beefed up 
the part-time staff so the Fredericks would not have to work more than 40 hours 
a week. But that's not entirely good news for the family. 
</P>
<P>
"It's cramped our personal lives a little bit, sure," Frederick said.

DOCTORS SPURNED RICHES TO COMFORT THE DYING; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: THEY WERE OFFERED FAME AND FORTUNE FOR THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS BUT CHOSE 
THE SPIRITUAL REWARDS OF WORKING WITH ADVANCED CANCER PATIENTS.

Fame came early for Drs. James Cimino and Michael E. Brescia. But they ditched 
life in the limelight for the quieter rewards of treating patients dying of 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
They insist, repeatedly, that they're not heroes. "We aren't saintly," said 
Cimino. "Whatever people do, they do with the motivation of 
self-gratification." 
</P>
<P>
They praise co-workers at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx and speak with awe of 
the nuns who founded the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"We took a road," says Brescia. "To the left, it looked shiny and gold. But to 
the right, it looked happier to us." 
</P>
<P>
They came to the crossroads 25 years ago, when as internists at the Veterans 
Administration hospital in the Bronx, they developed a procedure now widely 
used in kidney dialysis. 
</P>
<P>
Medical journals touted their achievement. Research opportunities rolled in. 
They were invited to speak at conventions. They were offered an entire 
Westchester County hospital, for a token $1, if they would turn it into a 
kidney center. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they chose the day-to-day rewards at Calvary, the nation's only acute 
care hospital devoted exclusively to advanced cancer patients. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't go home if someone was suffering," said Brescia. "We learned to live 
with tiny victories: The patient was able to eat today, or go to church, or sit 
in a chair, or play with her children. We're mature enough to accept that." 
</P>
<P>
Without that attitude, he conceded, a patient could "put tremendous anxiety in 
you by looking at you and expecting what cannot be done: those pleading eyes, 
looking at you, telling you that you've failed." 
</P>
<P>
In 1961, Cimino, director of renal services at the VA hospital, began spending 
a few hours a week as an adviser at Calvary. Then Brescia, one of his 
residents, joined him. Gradually, it became their life's work. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt this was a mission," said Brescia, who, like Cimino, is a father of 
six. "We saw unbearable suffering of patients and families that we, as 
physicians, could relieve." 
</P>
<P>
"It was an adventure," said Brescia. "But I wasn't unhappy taking it. To me, it 
looked good and right." 
</P>
<P>
Cimino became medical director and Brescia his assistant. Under their 
leadership, Calvary won accreditation. 
</P>
<P>
The two capitalized on their fame to lure other doctors to Calvary. In 1980, 
they dropped their titles to become assistants to the medical director and 
senior attending physicians; mostly, they were "just doctors," and the patients 
think that's just fine. 
</P>
<P>
"I came from another hospital," said Vivian Dowling. "This is heaven in 
comparison -- and I'm not just saying that because the doctor is here." 
</P>
<P>
"I love Vivian; she's brave and courageous," said Brescia. "When you work with 
patients like this, the things you thought were important -- you get home and 
somebody went through the garage door -- don't mean anything." 
</P>
<P>
Calvary, unlike a hospice, is a full-fledged hospital. It uses medical 
treatments to slow the spread of cancer, fight other ailments brought on by the 
disease, and alleviate pain. But the emphasis is on comfort, rather than cures. 
</P>
<P>
Dowling, for instance, "came here in terrible pain: not from the cancer, but 
from a hole in her back," said Brescia, 57. "I cured the hole. Now, she's a 
whole person." 
</P>
<P>
Cimino and Brescia maintain that, even in an era of hospices and patient 
rights, the terminally ill often are shunted to the back wards of big hospitals 
and ignored by busy doctors. 
</P>
<P>
"Some oncologists are not able to work here. They want to see the patients get 
well," said Cimino, 60. "A place like this could be very defeating for persons 
with that attitude. That's why so many of these kind of places are led by 
religious groups. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the worst things in this stage of life is to feel that you're not 
worthy of the attention of a professional," Cimino added. 
</P>
<P>
It's not uncommon for doctors at Calvary to telephone a patient on a holiday. 
New patients are presented with a rose. There is a free beauty parlor and 
barber. "Even the security guards are told to be gentle. Everything is done 
with human dignity," said Brescia. 
</P>
<P>
"It's equally important for the doctors to comfort the families," he said. "The 
families have been through hell: They're devastated. Sometimes we sit them down 
with a cup of coffee. We're trying to undo all the spiritual and emotional 
neglect." 
</P>
<P>
Many patients, some of them lying on colorful gurneys, also attend Catholic, 
Protestant or Jewish services in the chapel or watch them on closed-circuit 
television in their rooms. 
</P>
<P>
The staff relies heavily on "cancer care technicians," who work under the 
supervision of registered nurses to change tracheotomy tubes and surgical 
dressings, groom patients and "give the most essential quality of care: 
kindness and love," said Cimino. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the philosophy of non-abandonment. You keep your promises to the 
patients; you never let them feel isolated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And along with the attention, said Brescia, "We always leave a tiny bit of hope 
in the patient."

SWOLLEN RIVER GNAWS TRAIL OF DAMAGE OVER ARKANSAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The swollen Arkansas River, fed by hard rains and overflowing lakes and 
reservoirs in Oklahoma, pushed relentlessly through Arkansas on Saturday, 
inundating homes in its path toward the Mississippi River. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Talley, spokesman for Arkansas Emergency Services in Little Rock, said the 
river was expected to cause serious flooding through Tuesday as flood crests 
move downstream from the Ft. Smith-Van Buren area on the Oklahoma border. 
</P>
<P>
"We are preparing for the worst flooding in 17 years, since 1973," Talley said. 
</P>
<P>
Weather officials said the river will crest 5 feet above flood stage at Little 
Rock, and flooding could be extensive near Pine Bluff. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, heavy rains subsided in Texas, where floodwaters inundated more than 
2,300 homes. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks of heavy rains and thunderstorms in Oklahoma and Texas took their 
toll in death and destruction in those states, and Oklahoma began opening its 
swelling lakes and reservoirs along the Arkansas and Red rivers earlier this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Talley said the Arkansas River crested Saturday in Ft. Smith at 14 feet above 
flood stage, and 52 homes were under water there. He said the river was rising 
2 inches per hour as it moved downstream toward Pine Bluff, 35 miles south of 
Little Rock, and will flood at each point along its route. 
</P>
<P>
Many people in Ft. Smith were accusing Oklahoma of "stupidity" for releasing 
too much water, but Talley disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Those people who were complaining were citizens, not state officials. They, 
frankly, are misinformed or don't really understand what the problem is. There 
is no question in my mind but that Oklahoma held as much back for as long as 
they could. Oklahoma and Texas had record rains. If anybody was hit harder than 
us, it was Oklahoma and Texas." 
</P>
<P>
The spell of heavy rains left thousands of acres of north Texas under water, 
and the flooding has been blamed for 11 deaths, authorities said. The Red 
Cross, in a preliminary survey, said 717 homes were destroyed and 1,600 others 
were heavily damaged. Sixteen counties have been designated federal disaster 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Although a slow fall of the floodwaters began Saturday in north Texas, the 
National Weather Service at midday issued a flash flood warning for parts of 
four counties south of Dallas on the Trinity River. Levees in those areas broke 
late Thursday and Friday due to strong currents and high water, and the weather 
service said there could be more levee failures. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary estimates from the city of Dallas placed property damage and 
cleanup costs at more than $10 million, said Earnie Taft of the Dallas Office 
of Emergency Preparedness.

U.S. MARINE SLAIN NEAR BASE IN PHILIPPINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
OLONGAPO, Philippines 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suspected Communist gunman shot and killed a U.S. Marine sergeant outside the 
American-run Subic Bay naval complex, prompting officials Saturday to restrict 
travel by all U.S. military personnel in the Philippines as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Navy identified the slain American as Gunnery Sgt. John S. Fredette, 
34, of Buena Park, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
He was attached to the 323rd Marine Fighter Squadron based in El Toro, Calif., 
and was on temporary duty at Subic. 
</P>
<P>
Philippine police said Fredette was killed by a single bullet in the back of 
his head while he was walking at 11:30 p.m. Friday in the liberty city of 
Olongapo, 50 miles northwest of Manila. 
</P>
<P>
In Manila, U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt "expressed shock and sorrow at the 
cowardly murder" of Fredette, an embassy statement said. It said U.S. officials 
were in touch with Philippine authorities regarding the investigation of the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but police suspected 
Communist guerrillas. Fredette would be the ninth U.S. victim of a rebel terror 
strike since October, 1987 and the first in Olongapo. 
</P>
<P>
Navy Lt. Cmdr. Kevin Mukree said off-base travel for the 40,000 military and 
Defense Department employees and their dependents was restricted after the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Mukree said Fredette was shot by "an unknown assailant" and refused to 
elaborate. But Philippine police officials believed the Communist New People's 
Army was behind the killing. 
</P>
<P>
The attack came nine days before the start of exploratory talks on the future 
of six U.S. facilities in the Philippines, including the giant Clark Air Base 
and the Subic Bay Naval Base. The leases expire next year, and there is 
considerable sentiment in the Philippines not to renew them. 
</P>
<P>
Eight Americans have been killed in the Philippines since October, 1987, in 
attacks blamed on Communist guerrillas.

GHOST SUBWAY STOP LOOKS BACK TO FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RUBIN, COLUMBIA NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifty yards from City Hall and 35 feet below it lies a long slow curve into New 
York's past. It is a subway station that recalls a time when underground train 
rides were trips into the future and when terra cotta, not stainless steel, was 
the underground vogue. 
</P>
<P>
Few of the city's daily 10 million subway riders have ever seen or heard of the 
City Hall Station, which was the last stop on the city's first subway line, the 
Interborough Rapid Transit. Since 1948, passengers have had to get off at the 
larger but more plain Brooklyn Bridge stop. 
</P>
<P>
City Hall Station is a ghost station. Its brass chandeliers and vaulted 
ceilings are for the most part seen only by engineers and conductors who guide 
their trains through the station from the downtown to the uptown track. 
</P>
<P>
There are five ghost stations in New York, but none so historically significant 
or remarkably well preserved. 
</P>
<P>
"Each time I go by, it's like going into the past," said John Morton, a driver 
for 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 27, 1904, New York's 93rd mayor, John McClellan, descended the steps of 
one of two kiosks marking the station's entrance in City Hall Park. Then taking 
a silver key from an engineer, he switched on the electricity and drove the 
first train out of the station to the wild cheering of passengers as well as 
above-ground crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its location literally at the foot of New York's government, City 
Hall was the crown jewel among the IRT's original 49 stations. Aside from its 
chandeliers and cream-colored matte ceiling tiles, it featured three skylights 
of tinted glass and station name plaques of blue and white glazed tile. 
</P>
<P>
Work on the original IRT lasted almost five years and cost $35 million. The 
line stretched from the City Hall Station north to Grand Central Terminal, west 
to Times Square and then north again to 145th Street in Manhattan. One 
newspaper reported that although New Yorkers were a little mystified at seeing 
people emerge from underground stations, they quickly embraced their subway, as 
more than 150,000 people went for a ride on opening night. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1948, the city's transit authority decided to end service to City Hall 
Station. It said that the extreme curve of the station, which created gaps of 
one to two feet between trains and the platform, was a hazard for passengers. 
Trains would continue to use its tunnel to turn around, but Brooklyn Bridge, 
which despite its name lies roughly the same distance from City Hall, became 
the last stop on the No. 6 line. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the opening ceremony, City Hall Station closed without fanfare 
on the stroke of the new year. New York's newspapers barely made note of its 
passing. 
</P>
<P>
Citing its historical importance and beautiful tile work, New York's Landmarks 
Commission made City Hall Station a landmark on Oct. 29, 1979. Michael Corbett, 
a commission researcher, said landmark structures are "customarily open to the 
public." 
</P>
<P>
Tour groups cleared by the Transit Authority are now the only passengers 
permitted to see the station. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Previdi, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transit Authority, said that the 
agency had considered opening City Hall to the public, possibly as a 
restaurant, but that the station's narrow platforms and poor plumbing presented 
formidable obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
Melanie Crawford, a traffic controller for the No. 6 line, said that she was 
proud to have the station under her jurisdiction. "You get a feeling of 
history," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The gloominess of the station easily evokes memories of the past. Two of the 
three skylights have been blocked. Only the lights from the chandeliers -- 12 
in all with four bulbs each -- illuminate the platform. A short flight of 
stairs up from the platform, 12 more bulbs provide light for the small 
mezzanine. 
</P>
<P>
The tile work is marred only by a small chip over one of the nameplates, and 
some graffiti. Marvin Capers, a former train engineer who leads tours of the 
station, said it is cleaned regularly. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at how the work has held up," he said. "If you built something like this 
today, the tiles would be gone."

PILSEN, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of Czechoslovaks joined U.S. veterans Saturday for a sun-kissed 
streetfest in the first celebration ever of the liberation of this beer-brewing 
city by American troops in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Pubs were turned into imitations of Wild West saloons and youths with U.S. Army 
paraphernalia rode the streets on vintage Harley-Davidson motorcycles inherited 
from their parents. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 150,000 visitors are expected to descend on Pilsen, a city of 130,000, 
today, including President Vaclav Havel and U.S. Ambassador Shirley Temple 
Black. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. George C. Patton's 3rd Army liberated Pilsen on May 6, 1945, just three 
days before World War II ended in Prague. 
</P>
<P>
By agreement with the Soviets, American troops came to a halt at a demarcation 
line cutting southwest through Czechoslovak territory, leaving the Red Army to 
conquer the capital. 
</P>
<P>
The Communists barred any commemoration of the U.S. liberation of about 3,600 
square miles of Czechoslovak territory and marked May 5 as a day of liberation 
by Soviet troops. 
</P>
<P>
Six months after Czechoslovakia's peaceful revolution in December, however, the 
atmosphere in this grim industrial city had changed remarkably. 
</P>
<P>
American flags adorned the former bastions of Communist officials, and scores 
of U.S. veterans were in town for the celebration. Tens of thousands of people 
turned out Saturday morning to see the ceremonial inauguration of a monument to 
the 2nd Infantry Division on Pilsen's downtown Republic Square. 
</P>
<P>
Those who lived long enough to see the return of Patton's men still remember 
the postwar atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt so right that our town was freed from the Nazis by a Western army," 
Frantisek Kotva, a pensioner, mused over a mug of the city's famous beer. "We 
all loved the GIs, but then we had to forget about them for a long time," he 
said.

TURKEY'S RAGS-TO-RICHES SABANCI FAMILY REMEMBERS HUMBLE COTTON FIELDS HERITAGE 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An old wooden plow adorns the entrance to the Istanbul headquarters of Sakip 
Sabanci's business empire, a poignant reminder of his family's rags-to-riches 
story. 
</P>
<P>
"My father began life from zero as a humble cotton worker. He was very careful 
with money and saved, saved, saved," said Sabanci, 56, an eccentric billionaire 
whose interests range from electronics, banking and textiles to hotels and 
bottled water. 
</P>
<P>
Widely regarded as the "people's tycoon" who enjoys mixing with workers as much 
as with the high and mighty, he is one of Turkey's most popular public figures. 
</P>
<P>
"I relax when I am very successful in the economic or social area. If I am in 
one of my factories shaking hands with managers and workers, I am happy," he 
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
He rarely carries more than a few thousand lira -- just enough to pay for a 
taxi or bus ride -- and dresses in a style that would make devotees of high 
fashion wince. 
</P>
<P>
The Sabanci family numbers Prime Minister Turgut Ozal among its past employees 
and another former premier as top executive of its bank, Akbank. 
</P>
<P>
Its rise mirrors Turkey's struggle to enter the ranks of developed countries. 
</P>
<P>
Sabanci's penniless father, Haci Omer Sabanci, is reputed to have walked 200 
miles through the barren Anatolian heartland in the depressed 1920s to seek a 
cotton worker's job. 
</P>
<P>
He later became a shareholder in a cotton ginning plant in the Mediterranean 
city of Adana. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Sakip Sabanci and his four brothers, who maintain close control of Haci 
Omer Sabanci Holding AS, are looking abroad to fresh markets in Europe and 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
"My father believed that family members should understand each other," said 
Sabanci, who entered the Forbes magazine list of world billionaires in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's success of the Sabanci group is due not to the capital, the technology 
or the equipment. The reason is that members of the family are continuing the 
same way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sabanci said the family would always retain at least a 75% shareholding. It was 
100% until 1972, when the group started to sell small stakes to others. 
</P>
<P>
The name "Haci Omer" litters Sabanci's conversation as he sits beneath a 
painting of his late father, dwarfing smaller signed ones of British Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher and former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald 
Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
"He was No. 1. When I was aged 13 or 14 he took me to the factories and gave me 
the power to handle company money and sign and fill blank checks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sabanci, head of the governing body of the influential Assn. of Turkish 
Businessmen and Industrialists, is always ready to speak out on domestic 
politics and the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"I would vote for any (political) leader who could ensure stable leadership," 
he said, referring to squabbling in the center-right government triggered 
mainly by disputes over economic policy and inflation, now at an annual 62.8%. 
</P>
<P>
With annual revenues estimated at $4 billion in 1989, Haci Omer Sabanci Holding 
is among the first 200 in Fortune Magazine's list of the largest 500 industrial 
companies outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Sabanci's main business thrust over the past decade has been tie-ups and joint 
ventures with foreign firms, including European banks and electronic companies, 
U.S and Japanese cord and tire companies and large insurance outfits. 
</P>
<P>
Sabanci and Japan's Toyota Motor Co. have agreed in principle to form a joint 
venture to produce Toyota cars in a factory in Adapazari, western Turkey, from 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
"Our basic future is with Western Europe but I believe, I hope, 50% of the firm 
will be involved with Japan," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We must have relations with the Japanese. We need them. They (the Japanese) 
are doing very well with technology and have discipline and hard workers," he 
added.

It has been a bad year for Communists, but there were no tears Saturday as the 
diminished ranks of the socialist fraternity paid respects to Karl Marx, 
commemorating his 172nd birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Delegations from China, Mongolia and East Germany made a pilgrimage to the 
London cemetery where the father of communism is buried, bringing flowers and 
their versions of the kinder, gentler communism of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
"It (Marxism) is not dead. Misinterpretation of Marx is dead," said Joachim 
Mitdank, the East German ambassador. "We have more than ever before to make 
correct interpretation." 
</P>
<P>
Marx came to London in 1849 after being expelled from his native Germany. He 
lived in London's Soho district, researching his criticism of capitalism, "Das 
Kapital." 
</P>
<P>
He died in 1883, his writings almost unknown.

Military officers and diplomats at NATO headquarters here are clearly buoyed by 
the firm support they have received from Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
for a future role for the organization. 
</P>
<P>
At a time of uncertainty, they heartily welcomed Baker's reassurance last week 
that President Bush wants to enhance the political role of the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Many senior officials here worry that despite NATO's record as the most 
successful defense alliance in modern European history, the Cold War's end may 
force NATO into premature retirement -- a kind of yesterday's alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Various political voices in Western Europe, particularly West German Social 
Democrats and their foreign allies, suggest increasingly that NATO has outlived 
its usefulness and ought to be scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
These critics do not spell out exactly what should take the place of NATO, but 
there is talk of a European Community with a security dimension, or, better 
yet, a strengthening of the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (CSCE), which includes East European countries. 
</P>
<P>
This disturbs NATO officials, who believe that the alliance should not be 
phased out but be praised and given new tasks. 
</P>
<P>
"When you've just won the ball game, you don't retire the winning team," one 
senior American military man said. "Yet that's just what some Europeans are 
suggesting we do." 
</P>
<P>
The military officers, diplomats, and strategic specialists who support a 
continued NATO are not simply cold warriors who do not want to lose their jobs 
or who stubbornly talk about potential threats from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
They agree that military forces in Western Europe will be sharply reduced in 
the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"We simply think that it is way too premature to disband NATO," said Simon 
Lunn, a senior strategist with the North Atlantic Assembly, a group of 
lawmakers in the member countries. 
</P>
<P>
Another official said: "While nobody expects Soviet armored divisions to roll 
across the north German plain, they are still a force to be considered -- with 
16 divisions in East Germany alone. So there is a need for a Western military 
force in being. Who knows what the Kremlin's policies will be a year from now." 
</P>
<P>
As these people see it, there are still many military tasks for NATO, as well 
as new and broader reasons for its continuing existence. NATO's role, they say, 
should emphasize the political side of the 16-member alliance, which includes 
the key countries of Western Europe plus the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"We have always had a strong political component," Secretary General Manfred 
Woerner said. "We have never been solely a military alliance." 
</P>
<P>
Vernon A. Walters, the U.S. ambassador to West Germany, adds: "NATO has never 
been simply about soldiers and tanks and planes. It's also the seat of European 
political connections, the center of European decision-making since World War 
II." 
</P>
<P>
Of the non-military potential of NATO, a senior U.S. diplomat here said: "With 
Europe in the throes of change, NATO is more than ever needed. NATO is a 
predictable factor. It is a structure that ties in the United States with 
Europe. It gives a united Germany a home. It gives Eastern European countries 
like Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary a sense of not being left in a void. 
And it is in a position to dampen and quell local conflicts, particularly those 
that might break out among ethnic regions in Central Europe and the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
"In short, it is an all-purpose organization that represents calm, certainty 
and stability." 
</P>
<P>
Few Western politicians want to scrap NATO overnight, but some have argued that 
the CSCE, established in Helsinki in 1975, would be better suited to serve new 
European political and security interests since it brings together all European 
nations with the exception of Albania, plus the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of this plan would strengthen the loosely organized CSCE, which is 
an umbrella group for arms control and human rights, and give it a secretariat 
and a wide range of responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
However, many NATO supporters argue that CSCE's very breadth is a drawback, 
perhaps a fatal weakness in any effort to fulfill a realistic security role. 
</P>
<P>
"CSCE operates on a consensus basis," a top NATO planner said, "and it doesn't 
have any security apparatus. Can you imagine trying to get a unanimous decision 
on an urgent military matter with countries as diverse as the United States and 
the Soviet Union, San Marino and Malta? It would be like a mini-United Nations, 
and it just wouldn't work." 
</P>
<P>
But what could be NATO's most important new role, according to some Western 
strategists who are hesitant about discussing the matter publicly, is the 
containment of a unified Germany. 
</P>
<P>
One leading NATO diplomat said: "Let's face it, whether the Germans like it or 
not, they are feared by some nations and worry others. NATO can serve two 
important purposes: reassuring the Germans that they are members of a strong 
Western Alliance and reassuring Germany's neighbors that the alliance can 
embrace Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the Russians are realizing, though they won't admit it publicly yet, the 
advantage of NATO as a containing force for a united Germany." 
</P>
<P>
Secretary General Woerner, a former West German defense minister, has even 
warned that a powerful and neutralized Germany would be a "loose cannon." 
</P>
<P>
In looking toward Europe's future, one NATO ambassador observed: "The veneer of 
European integration is still very thin. The key to future harmony and 
stability in Europe is a united Germany that is balanced and linked to friendly 
powers, most particularly the United States. The only proven and existing 
organization that can play that role is NATO."

<TEXT>
<P>
Those who march to a different drum in Mississippi can find liberal camaraderie 
in the sounds of old instruments such as sacbuts, lutes, krummhorns, cornettos 
and viola da gambas. 
</P>
<P>
The Mississippi Academy of Ancient Music Inc. is sponsoring recitals reviving 
old instrumentation and period music, at the same time providing social 
gatherings for many who may not feel comfortable at Southern black-tie affairs, 
Academy President Rich McGinnis said. 
</P>
<P>
The academy, organized in 1981, evolved from elaborate Thanksgiving weekend 
birthday parties given for civil rights activist Ernst Borinski, who died in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of the one place where liberal Jackson could meet," McGinnis, a 
Tougaloo College chemistry professor, said of the Borinski parties. 
</P>
<P>
Borinski, a Polish-German Jew, fled Nazi Germany for the United States in 1938. 
He had taught sociology at historically black Tougaloo College since 1947. 
</P>
<P>
He is credited with initiating across the state during the 1950s and 1960s many 
academic forums at which blacks and whites met to discuss civil rights issues. 
The former German judge also was undergraduate mentor to many black lawyers, 
including Reuben Anderson, Mississippi's only black Supreme Court justice since 
Reconstruction and the first black graduated from the University of Mississippi 
Law School. 
</P>
<P>
"Borinski would always have a birthday party just after Thanksgiving. It was in 
a very European style," McGinnis recalls. "He would have a little party for his 
friends from the college and so forth, other friends from Jackson. In fact, 
actually, it was a lot of civil rights people. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"One time he was at an ACLU auction, and he bought an evening of music from 
Jean Paul, the St. Andrews (Episcopal) choir master. Jean Paul wanted to play 
'Shadow of Your Smile' or something like that all night on the piano -- but 
here's a college professor, so he figures he'd better do something serious. So 
he brought over some music that they were doing at St. Andrews." 
</P>
<P>
Borinski liked the very old music that Jean Paul played. A month before his 
next birthday, he told McGinnis he would like to have a similar performance. 
McGinnis called on Max Garriott, a tour guide and professional musician in 
Vicksburg who is now vice president of the Mississippi Academy of Ancient 
Music. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew Max had composed some Baroque-style music for parties. So he wound up 
composing special birthday music for Borinski -- some of it adapted from 
Baroque music and some of it original," McGinnis said. 
</P>
<P>
The parties expanded. There were 250 to 300 guests at Borinski's 80th birthday 
party in 1981, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The parties were "one of the crazy things that led into all this," McGinnis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"And it kind of kept that little group of people together" who support the 
ancient music academy. 
</P>
<P>
McGinnis and Garriott said that the group now gets various grants from the 
National Endowment for the Arts, the Mississippi Arts Commission and other 
public and private sources. It sponsors performances by about four professional 
groups each year before audiences of about 200. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the performers come from Europe, the forefront of the movement to 
revive historically authentic performances on period instruments, McGinnis 
said. Jackson is often the groups' only Southern stop on their American tours. 
</P>
<P>
"We present music from 1200 to 1800 -- 600 years' worth of music. And if you go 
to one concert and don't like it, or if you do like it, it doesn't mean you'll 
react the same way to the next one, which may be completely different music," 
McGinnis said.

CASTRO'S POWER, CUBA'S FUTURE HINGE ON CONTINUED ECONOMIC BOND WITH SOVIETS; 
</P>

ALLIANCE: THE TWO COMMUNIST NATIONS RELY ON ONE ANOTHER, OBSERVERS SAY. THEIR 
TIES COULD STYMIE ATTEMPTS TO OVERTHROW THE DICTATOR.

HAVANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cheered by the collapse of communism in East Europe, Cuban exiles have been 
dancing in the streets of Miami in expectation of Fidel Castro's imminent 
downfall. One militant anti-Castro group, Alpha-66, has even begun paramilitary 
training in the Everglades to join battle instantly if there is an armed 
uprising. 
</P>
<P>
But Cubans in the streets of Havana, and experts here from both East and West, 
say that despite international pressures and increased domestic grumbling over 
the Communist country's severe economic problems, the hemisphere's most durable 
dictator may stay in power for years. 
</P>
<P>
"His relationship with the Soviet Union is the key," a Western diplomat said, 
noting that the Soviets' annual $5.5-billion package of aid and credits has 
been the Havana government's lifeline for the past three decades. "If that goes 
on, he goes on." 
</P>
<P>
A top Soviet diplomat, who is privately critical of the Castro regime but 
believes it is in no danger of collapse, said: "I don't think it is possible 
that we will cut our aid to Cuba. We need their products. They need our 
assistance. It will go on." 
</P>
<P>
Not one expert interviewed recently in the course of a two-week visit to Havana 
saw any sign of a significant weakening in Soviet-Cuban ties. This despite a 
newly abrasive tone in the relationship, including stingingly critical articles 
and ominous grumblings about continued aid to Cuba in the Moscow press. 
</P>
<P>
Nor have they detected the kind of restiveness in the military and among the 
people that would suggest that the regime is losing its grip. Among the 
specialists who talked with a reporter on the condition of anonymity were 
diplomats from East and West Europe, Latin and North America, and the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
None foresaw a Caribbean copy of East Europe's experience, but all agreed that 
even with continued Soviet aid, Cuba faces hard times that will keep the 
country on a tough austerity diet for as long as the U.S. embargo lasts. The 
main problems today, they said, are a shortage of hard currency, brought on by 
the country's almost total reliance on trade in nonconvertible rubles and 
barter with the Soviets and the former East Bloc countries, and sluggishness 
and mismanagement in Cuba's centrally controlled economy. 
</P>
<P>
Castro and other government officials have been candid about the grim 
prospects, which they said will become acute in 1991, when trade agreements 
expire and Cuba must begin paying hard currency for spare parts and other vital 
goods from its suppliers in East Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't deny that when our economic ties with Eastern Europe are torn down we 
are going to face some problems," said Jorge Gomez Barata, a top Castro adviser 
in the Central Committee of the Cuban Communist Party. "But we will be able to 
continue without disorder." 
</P>
<P>
While barter and ruble-based trade with the Soviets is expected to continue, 
Castro and the government-run press have warned frequently of the need for 
belt-tightening. Gomez Barata and other senior officials emphasize that they 
have reordered government priorities to emphasize greater self-sufficiency in 
industry and agriculture and a crash program to develop tourism and other 
hard-currency earners. 
</P>
<P>
On the streets of Havana, there is ample evidence that hard times already are 
here. Long lines form quickly at food markets when sparse supplies of imported 
pork, beef and chicken arrive from hard-currency countries such as Brazil. A 
running joke heard in food lines at several Havana markets has it that "if 
there's another revolution it won't be over ideology, it'll be over a chicken 
breast." 
</P>
<P>
As they queue for food, people complain openly about recent increases in the 
price of bread and eggs, both in short supply since December when the Soviets 
delayed a bonus shipment of wheat and feed grains and the Cuban larder ran dry. 
</P>
<P>
A Soviet Embassy official said wheat had routinely been sent a month or more in 
advance of its committed due date, so that Cuba, in effect, received a bonus of 
an extra month's wheat supply after each year's commitment was fulfilled. The 
expectation was that Cuba would stockpile the bonus grain against a rainy day. 
</P>
<P>
The rainy day came in December, when, facing problems at home and with their 
formal 1989 commitment fulfilled, the Soviets withheld the advance shipment. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been telling them all along they should have prepared for it," a Soviet 
economic specialist complained. "It is impossible to live without at least a 
minimum stockpile. It's all very frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
Cuban economist Eugenio Balari, who directs the government's think tank on 
domestic consumption, acknowledged: "There was a certain amount of guilt on our 
side. We should have stockpiled so we had a cushion. As it was, we practically 
had to unload the wheat from the boats and truck it directly to the bakers when 
it came. Now we've increased the price of bread and eggs, not for the money but 
for conservation, so we will have a cushion. Once we have a stockpile, maybe we 
will lower the prices again." 
</P>
<P>
Although one hears grumbling in the food lines, none of the foreign experts 
here believe that the public's unhappiness even borders on the kind of 
discontent that has been responsible for bread riots and rebellion in many 
other Third World countries. 
</P>
<P>
"The average Cuban may be eating a bland diet, but even with shortages, he is 
better fed than most other Latin Americans," a Scandinavian diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Another bonus feature of Soviet-Cuban trade has been a liberal flow of 
subsidized Soviet oil, about 20% to 25% more than enough to meet Cuba's 
domestic needs. Until now, the Castro government has routinely sold the surplus 
oil for desperately needed hard currency. As recently as 1985, the last year 
Cuba reported its oil trade figures, the re-export of Soviet oil earned Havana 
a tidy $621 million. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, re-export earnings have gone unreported, leading some specialists 
to conclude that the bonus oil flow has slowed or even ended. But a Soviet 
diplomat, without revealing figures, said the oil flow continues in excess of 
Cuba's needs. 
</P>
<P>
"The Russians may cut back somewhat, but it's not in their interest to cut Cuba 
down to starvation rations," another diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet economic specialist agreed, saying: "There's no question that we 
need these products. In the U.S.S.R., we produce about 8 to 9 million tons of 
sugar a year and have to buy 4 million tons from Cuba to make up the shortfall. 
The significance to us of the Cuban sugar is considerable. Nickel is vital for 
our industry. And Cuba's citrus fruits are very important to us." 
</P>
<P>
But he hinted at harder bargaining by a Soviet delegation now in Havana to 
begin negotiating new trade terms to replace the five-year cooperation 
agreement that expires at the end of this year. Because of the use of barter 
and overvalued rubles and Cuban pesos, it is hard to calculate the extent of 
the Soviet subsidy to the Castro regime. But experts say the Soviets pay more 
than twice the world price for Cuban sugar and similarly unrealistic prices for 
raw materials and citrus fruits. 
</P>
<P>
Thus Cuba may soon be getting less nourishment from the Soviets than it has in 
the past, but the experts doubt that any future cutback will be sharp enough to 
endanger the Castro government. Even if Soviet aid dropped to only $3 billion a 
year, it would suffice to keep Castro's troubled economic machine running, 
predicted Prof. Philip Brenner, a Cuba specialist at American University in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Like many diplomatic specialists here, Brenner predicted that Soviet aid will 
continue and that Castro might survive as Cuba's leader for another decade. 
</P>
<P>
"Cuba is essential to the Soviet Union's image as a superpower," Brenner said. 
"While it is costly, there are certain benefits, both military and civil." 
</P>
<P>
He cited in particular Moscow's largest electronic eavesdropping network 
outside the Soviet Union and the continued use of Cuban bases for aerial 
surveillance and naval support. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the experts here believe that Cuba's military importance to the Soviets 
has waned, except, as one said, "as the last nice tropical outpost for KGB and 
army officers to do temporary duty." But they said Cuba's military importance 
is not the chief element of the strategic equation in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the strategic military value but the broader geopolitical value that 
counts," one said. "This is one of the Soviets' last claims to being a great 
power. With East Germany gone, Cuba is their most important ally." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, Moscow cannot afford to endanger Castro's grip on power 
by undercutting him too severely in economic terms. 
</P>
<P>
"The regime's arms are still strong, and the army is loyal to Fidel," a 
European diplomat said. "And he still exercises a moral authority unlike that 
of any of the fallen East European Communist leaders. As long as the military 
remains behind him, he will be able to repress any challenge to his power."

JOB INITIATION RITES CAN TURN UGLY, FATAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN COOK, THE GUARDIAN 
</P>

<DATELINE>

LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an alleyway outside a small London print shop recently, a new employee was 
stripped by his fellow workers, tied to a chair, daubed with ink, flour and 
discarded food, and left out in the cold for two hours. Even seasoned printers 
felt that was going a little too far. 
</P>
<P>
Such initiation ceremonies remain common in many jobs in Britain, despite 
growing disapproval by managers and trade unions, and the evidence that they 
can go tragically wrong came in Liverpool Crown Court in December when two 
teen-agers were jailed for manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
They had doused a colleague's trousers with paint thinners, a regular 
initiation ceremony in the Skelmersdale factory where they worked. But they had 
also struck matches to frighten him and he caught fire and suffered fatal burns 
over 80% of his body. 
</P>
<P>
In other cases that have attracted recent headlines, trainee firemen in London 
were hosed with cold water and left standing in the street in nightshirts, a 
young policewoman in Manchester was left handcuffed to railings through a 
freezing night, and Army recruits were forced to call out musical notes as a 
sergeant hit them on their naked buttocks with a baseball bat. 
</P>
<P>
Although there has been some success in attempts to halt such ceremonies, or at 
least to make them less dangerous or humiliating, there also is evidence that 
they are a perennial aspect of group behavior that is unlikely to be 
eradicated. 
</P>
<P>
Allen Abramson, a London University anthropologist who has studied initiation 
rituals, said that most societies used them to mark important developments in a 
person's life, and that they often involved pain or deprivation. 
</P>
<P>
"Wherever you find a group within society which feels that what it's doing is 
seriously different from everyone else, then you're likely to find initiation 
rites," he said. "That's why they're common in the fire service and the Army, 
where people are doing something out of the ordinary and taking greater risks 
than others. 
</P>
<P>
"It also happens in public schools, where new arrivals are considered ordinary 
weaklings until they've been pushed out to survive some sort of ordeal so they 
can re-enter the group with a new identity." 
</P>
<P>
Early last year the Ministry of Defense announced new measures to discourage 
bullying after young recruits disclosed that they had been pushed into rivers 
and pelted with stones. 
</P>
<P>
Commanding officers were asked to crack down on harmful initiation ceremonies, 
and a scheme was started to install "agony aunts" from the Women's Royal 
Voluntary Service so that young soldiers being bullied could get a sympathetic 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
A defense ministry spokeswoman said that 92 "agony aunt" posts had been 
established in Britain and Germany, and 24 filled. "Ill treatment and bullying 
are being tackled with a range of measures including better training for junior 
officers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Harmful initiation rights are definitely out, but non-harmful ones would be 
OK. It would be up to officers to decide what was dangerous and whether to 
discourage it. But it might just take the form of going to the bar to buy 
drinks for everyone, as a way of belonging to the club." 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Service cracked down on initiation rituals after a young woman 
firefighter in London said her colleagues had tied her to a ladder, hosed her 
down, poured urine over her, used foul language and exposed themselves to her. 
Four officers had pay stopped, and London's fire chief fire said it should be 
possible to engender group spirit without "the denigration and ridicule of 
individuals." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Higgs, a spokesman for the Fire Brigades Union, said that initiation rites 
are "not widespread at all. We don't condone them in any way, especially if 
they have racist or sexist aspects. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to think that any sort of physical abuse doesn't go on anymore, 
but this does not mean that people might not get a bucket of water over them 
sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
Printers, traditionally an exclusive "closed shop" of workers, say that 
initiation ceremonies for apprentices are less common now than 20 or 30 years 
ago. Rituals often involved the daubing of men's private parts with indelible 
inks or waste paper and glue. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the print union Sogat said she is happy to say such practices 
are on the way out. "Some could be quite nasty, with people being tied up with 
ink chucked at them. We wouldn't encourage anything which was risky, and some 
were a bit near the mark." 
</P>
<P>
Abramson said he thought that if management or officers tried to suppress or 
control initiation rites, the rank and file would usually devise new ones of 
their own: "There'd be the official ceremony, then the men would take the new 
person off and say, now we're going to really initiate you." 
</P>
<P>
One apprentice print worker who was daubed and paraded on a trolley around 
Croydon in Surrey 25 years ago said: "The worst thing was if they didn't do 
anything to you at all -- it showed you weren't wanted."

TRIO BUNGLES ATTEMPT TO BLOW UP BRITISH MILITARY BARRACKS

Three men planting explosives near a British military barracks today fired at a 
guard before fleeing their bungled bombing attempt, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators later found 65 pounds of the high-powered explosive Semtex in 
three satchels outside a housing block at the British army's Langenhagen 
Barracks in Hanover, British military officials said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not known who was responsible. 
</P>
<P>
A Ministry of Defense spokesman in London said: "We cannot say the men were IRA 
at this moment in time. All we can say is that they were terrorists." 
</P>
<P>
The Irish Republican Army has been blamed for numerous attacks against British 
military installations in West Germany over the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
The IRA has waged a campaign to drive the British from Northern Ireland and 
unite the Protestant-dominated province with the overwhelming Roman Catholic 
Irish Republic. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, a civilian guard making the rounds with a security dog 
noticed three suspicious people on the barracks grounds about 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Three shots were fired by the people, said a British military spokesman, who 
spoke on condition of anonymity. He said the guard was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Henry Day, chief of public information for the British Forces in Germany, 
said the attackers had cut a hole in the barracks' perimeter fence. He told 
British Broadcasting Corp. radio that 70 soldiers were moved from the building.

LADY PORTER TRIES KEEPING RUBBISH OUT OF WESTMINSTER; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: AN ADMIRER OF MARGARET THATCHER, SHE STRUGGLES TO MAKE RICH 
MUNICIPALITY RUN MORE EFFICIENTLY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Margaret Thatcher is not the only grocer's daughter to disturb the old order. 
Lady Shirley Porter is trying to dust the cobwebs off Westminster, which 
includes Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey. 
</P>
<P>
As leader of Westminster City Council since 1983, Lady Porter has struggled to 
make one of Britain's richest municipalities run as efficiently as her father's 
supermarket chain. 
</P>
<P>
The sprawling metropolis of London has no citywide government or mayor. Each of 
the 32 boroughs elects its own council, which in turn picks a leader. 
Westminster's 60 councilors are up for election this month 
</P>
<P>
Lady Porter, wholeheartedly embracing Prime Minister Thatcher's free-market 
revolution, has sold the borough's garbage collection and recreation facilities 
to private contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Since she became head of the council, more than 9,000 council-owned apartments 
have been sold to their occupants as part of a national effort to turn tenants 
of public housing into property owners. 
</P>
<P>
She is an international expert on litter and often is seen walking around her 
bailiwick, picking it up. Lady Porter entered politics in 1974 specifically to 
tackle trash and lists her recreations in Who's Who as "cleaning up London" and 
"waste-hunting." 
</P>
<P>
Her animated brand of radical conservatism invites frequent comparisons with 
Thatcher, who grew up above her father's grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
Sir Jack Cohen, Lady Porter's father, parlayed an East London vegetable stall 
into the Tesco supermarket chain and imbued his younger daughter with his 
motto: "You can't do business sitting on your armchair." 
</P>
<P>
Lady Porter became head of Westminster Council as a free-market Conservative 
determined to eradicate the socialist structures that had long dominated local 
government in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Her strong-willed, sometimes autocratic style has inspired allegations of 
financial mismanagement, most notably after Westminster sold three old 
cemeteries for the equivalent of 8 cents each. Critics claimed it was a case of 
desecrating the dead to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to councils, some boroughs have ceremonial lord mayors. 
Westminster's handles the extensive ritual associated with a 400-year-old 
district in the heart of a pageantry-loving country. 
</P>
<P>
An American-style mayor is more to Lady Porter's taste, and she would like to 
be one. She said it's the best way to "cut through the bickering and the red 
tape and serve the interests of the people." 
</P>
<P>
She sees her goal as saving Westminster from becoming home to only the very 
rich and very poor. Lady Porter says she wants to give Westminster back to the 
middle classes, "to encourage them to stay so that we don't finish up like New 
York." 
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by the magazine Harpers and Queen said Lady Porter is the 20th 
richest woman in Europe, with an estimated personal fortune of 50 million 
pounds ($84.5 million). Her title derives from the knighthood of her husband, 
Sir Leslie Porter. 
</P>
<P>
Lady Porter's family background was reflected in her comment recently before a 
meeting of foreign journalists: "We believe in services to the customer. We are 
a service-oriented council. It's in my blood that people should be treated as 
customers." 
</P>
<P>
Her 170,000 customers are Westminster's permanent residents. They include the 
members of the Royal Family, who live at and around Buckingham Palace, and the 
prime minister, currently Thatcher, who lives down the road at 10 Downing 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
Every day, the population swells to more than 1 million with tourists, shoppers 
and workers who throng the Oxford Street shopping district, West End theaters, 
Hyde Park, Victoria Station, the houses of Parliament, the government offices 
of Whitehall, and the local church, Westminster Abbey. 
</P>
<P>
They leave enough litter to fill Trafalgar Square to the height of Admiral 
Nelson's column five times a year. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster claims that no council has done more than Lady Porter's to fight 
rubbish. Prince Philip, who once accompanied her on a garbage inspection 
detail, has taken to greeting her at social functions by calling across the 
room, "How are the litter bins?" 
</P>
<P>
Businesses pay for the upkeep of 500 garbage cans, and 31 uniformed wardens can 
fine litterers 10 pounds ($17) on the spot. A telephone hotline is planned for 
residents to report litterers, noise and curb-fouling dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Permanent residents get discounts on tourist attractions. Residents can deal 
with officials by telephone or fax and "one-stop services" mean the 
availability at one counter of everything from election registration to parking 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster is among the first British boroughs to introduce glass recycling 
bins.

THOSE ARE NO FISH TALES IN MANILA'S TABLOIDS, JUST ASK THE VIRGIN MARY NEXT 
TIME 
</P>

MANILA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Extra, extra, read all about it: Woman gives birth to fish! 
</P>
<P>
If that's too tame, how about randy spooks impregnating maidens? Or perhaps a 
"routine" appearance by the Virgin Mary? 
</P>
<P>
Such reports are a staple of Manila's lively tabloids, among the most widely 
read of the city's more than 20 dailies. 
</P>
<P>
In a country where the truth is often bizarre enough, English- and 
Tagalog-language tabloids dish out fantasy and flamboyance for those who find 
the broadsheet dailies too tame. 
</P>
<P>
The latest titillation was the saga of "Goldfish Flores Pascua," a 6-inch-long 
mudfish supposedly "born" to Lilian Pascua, 22, of Paniqui in Tarlac province. 
</P>
<P>
Several Manila tabloids reported that Pascua gave birth to the fish on March 31 
and named it "Goldfish." Tabloids splashed pictures of "Goldfish," swimming in 
a water basin, and its "parents" on their front pages. 
</P>
<P>
For several days, tabloids regaled their readers with details of the couple's 
plans to baptize the fish on Palm Sunday, despite healthy skepticism by local 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a fish should not be baptized and registered because it doesn't even 
have the resemblance of a man," said Paniqui Mayor Cesar Cuchapin. 
</P>
<P>
The baptism controversy was resolved when tabloids reported last week that 
"Goldfish's" short but celebrated life had come to an end. It was eaten by the 
family dog. 
</P>
<P>
With "Goldfish" now history, the tabloid Ang Pilipino Ngayon, or Filipino 
Today, reported that an 8-year-old boy had given birth by Cesarean section in a 
hospital in Pampanga province. The baby, a boy, was stillborn, the tabloid 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Not to be scooped, Manila radio station DZXL telephoned the hospital and spoke 
with an official, who confirmed that something resembling a fetus had been 
extracted from the boy. 
</P>
<P>
"How could he give birth when he is only 8 years old," the reporter asked, 
apparently more curious over age than the sex peculiarity. The official was at 
a loss for a response. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the far-fetched reports play on traditions of mysticism and 
superstition which run deep in this predominantly Roman Catholic country. 
</P>
<P>
"Goldfish" attracted almost as much attention as a teen-aged girl in Laguna 
province, who the tabloids reported two years ago became pregnant by the spirit 
of a 19th-Century cleric. 
</P>
<P>
Apparitions by the Virgin Mary are frequently reported, although the church 
hierarchy tends to give them little credence. The most recent was reported last 
year, when the Virgin supposedly appeared in a coconut grove southeast of 
Manila.

COLUMBIA'S SLUMS ARE BREEDING GROUND FOR SICARIOS -- DRUG LORDS' PAID ASSASSINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

MEDELLIN, Colombia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the hillsides surrounding the cocaine capital of Medellin lie the slums that 
supply Colombia's drug lords with a labor force for their dirty work. 
</P>
<P>
The cramped settlements are breeding grounds for the dreaded sicarios or hired 
assassins, who for a small price will kill anybody -- policeman, judge, 
journalist or politician. 
</P>
<P>
Frequently contracted by the drug traffickers to kill anyone who stands in 
their way, the sicarios are on the front line of Colombia's drug war, which has 
claimed more than 300 lives since last August. 
</P>
<P>
"A generation lives here which doesn't know what it is to die of old age," said 
an army major in charge of a nighttime crime sweep in Aranjuez, one of the most 
notorious neighborhoods for sicarios. 
</P>
<P>
Usually between the ages of 15 and 20, the sicarios will do anything to escape 
grinding poverty, often killing for as little as $40. 
</P>
<P>
Their trademark is to shoot at their victims from a motorbike and then speed 
off. Few of their crimes are solved. 
</P>
<P>
The murderer of leftist presidential candidate Bernardo Jaramillo, gunned down 
at Bogota's main airport in March, was a 15-year-old youth who grew up in a 
lower class suburb of Medellin. 
</P>
<P>
Police blamed sicarios hired by drug barons for the murder of 18 policemen 
during a single week last month in Medellin, home of the famous cartel that 
supplies much of the cocaine used in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Aranjuez, to the northeast of Medellin, is no-man's-land for strangers after 5 
p.m., except for the soldiers who periodically sweep the neighborhood in search 
of assassins. 
</P>
<P>
The most feared of the hundreds of gangs of assassins, Los Priscos, came from 
Aranjuez. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Pablo Escobar, accused head of the Medellin cocaine cartel, was 
often seen in Aranjuez. Now hunted by the authorities, Escobar is referred to 
here by the title, Don Pablo. 
</P>
<P>
The violence in Aranjuez can be felt in the harsh stares of the 14- and 
15-year-old youths lounging in the streets. They carry guns and are ready to 
use them. 
</P>
<P>
Army trucks roll into the neighborhood and cordon off a street. Soldiers storm 
the bars, separate the men from the women and ask for documents. A few are 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers systematically search houses for drugs or weapons. They are 
watched impassively by their owners who have grown used to these operations 
since the Colombian government cracked down on the illegal drug trade last 
August.

Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) charged that the manufacturer of the Navy's new 
$1.2-billion guided-missile destroyer is hampering congressional investigators 
examining allegations of contract fraud. Dingell, in a letter to Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney, said Bath Iron Works of Bath, Me., has refused to 
provide the congressional General Accounting Office with documents or allow 
investigators to interview employees unless the GAO promises to withhold the 
information from Congress.

GREYHOUND STRIKE TALKS FAIL TO YIELD PACT

Negotiators for striking Greyhound drivers and the bus line recessed talks 
Saturday after a nine-hour bargaining session failed to produce a new contract 
in the two-month walkout. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service said that both sides were 
reviewing proposals and that mediators hoped to schedule new talks within a few 
days. 
</P>
<P>
The talks were the first in the walkout since mid-March and came a day after 
the company reported a $56-million loss for the first three months of this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
A four-hour round of morning talks, which mostly involved each side talking 
separately with federal mediators, produced "very little" progress, Edward M. 
Strait, president of the Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions, said 
after labor and management broke separately for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Greyhound Vice President Anthony P. Lannie, the company's top negotiator, also 
said "nothing's happened so far." 
</P>
<P>
The negotiators left by a basement exit after the afternoon session, avoiding 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Lannie and Strait are trying to settle disputes over wages, job security and 
seniority issues for the 6,300 striking drivers and 3,000 clerical and 
maintenance workers who walked out March 2. 
</P>
<P>
Union spokesman Nick Nichols said striking drivers were hopeful a new contract 
could be reached soon because there appeared to be less "acrimony and tension" 
between the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
The walkout halted intercity bus service in nearly half of the 10,000 
communities Greyhound serves. Greyhound, the only nationwide bus line, has said 
it has since restored about 83% of its normal service. 
</P>
<P>
But on Friday, the company said it had suffered a $55.8-million loss in the 
January-March quarter, compared to a $14.4-million loss in the first quarter of 
1989. It turned a profit of under $1 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
The company blamed $20 million of this year's first-quarter loss on security 
for the shootings, bomb threats and other violent incidents that have occurred 
since the strike began nine weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the violence, the company withdrew from negotiations in mid-March. There 
have been more than 30 shootings at buses and terminals since the strike began.

CEAUSESCU'S BROTHERS SOLD SOVIET MILITARY DATA TO U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN WEISER, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 10 years before deposed Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's execution, 
the U.S. government secretly bought advanced Soviet military technology from 
Romania through Ceausescu's two brothers, who served in high government 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the clandestine intelligence program coordinated by the CIA, the 
U.S. government paid more than $40 million to Romania through foreign 
middlemen, with about 20% ending up in Swiss bank accounts controlled by the 
Ceausescu family, according to intelligence sources. 
</P>
<P>
The Ceausescu connection was part of a broader U.S. weapons-buying operation 
that reached into the highest levels of the East Bloc military Establishment. 
The CIA and the U.S. military were able to obtain important components of the 
tactical, non-nuclear weaponry -- including air defense systems -- that the 
Soviet Union has in place to protect itself and other Warsaw Pact countries. 
</P>
<P>
From Romania alone acquisitions included the latest version of the Shilka, one 
of the most effective anti-aircraft systems in the Soviet inventory; mobile 
rocket launchers that were improved by the Romanian military, and radar systems 
used in identifying targets and directing the firing of various Soviet 
anti-aircraft weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with this knowledge, U.S. military planners could then develop effective 
countermeasures or perhaps not build a costly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
"The potential value of these things is almost incalculable," a U.S. 
intelligence officer said. "The only way you can truly unlock the secrets of 
your adversaries' weapons is to physically have them." 
</P>
<P>
For example, access to the Soviet radar systems reportedly aided in U.S. 
development of the revolutionary Stealth technology, designed to allow aircraft 
to elude radar detection. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. government officials say that Nicolae Ceausescu was not personally 
involved in the dozen or so transactions but that the operation could have 
succeeded only with his tacit approval. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an assumption from the beginning," said one U.S. intelligence officer. 
"It was never something that we had to debate. None of this could happen, our 
presumption was, without him." 
</P>
<P>
The Romanian operation came to a halt with Ceausescu's overthrow and execution 
last December. The two brothers also are out of the picture: Marin Ceausescu, 
71, was found hanged Dec. 28 in the basement of the Romanian trade mission in 
Vienna, which he headed. Lt. Gen. Ilie Ceausescu, 63, deputy defense minister 
and secretary of the Supreme Political Council of the Romanian Armed Forces, 
was arrested and remains in custody. 
</P>
<P>
The pro-democracy upheaval in Eastern Europe has disrupted the broader 
operation, but not ended it. Over the past decade, the U.S. government has paid 
more than $250 million to obtain the latest versions of Soviet-made weapons 
systems through contacts in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, East Germany and 
Bulgaria, according to those interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
The contacts included influential military or Communist Party officials, whose 
willingness to sell was seen by some in the U.S. intelligence community as a 
reflection of growing discontent among some Warsaw Pact officials. 
</P>
<P>
"It was corrupt to the core," a former U.S. official said. "There was no 
ideological discrimination. If you wanted to use this as an indication of the 
fragility of the system, this was a classic."

WARRANTS TARGET $17.6 MILLION IN ACCOUNTS LINKED TO DRUGS

<P>
Federal drug agents served warrants to confiscate $17.6 million in South 
Florida financial institutions as a nationwide drug money laundering crackdown 
focuses on suspicious accounts, a spokesman said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials froze $400 million in more than 750 accounts nationally three 
weeks ago as part of the long-running Operation Polar Cap. Investigators have 
been working to pin down the origin of the funds, said Drug Enforcement 
Administration spokesman John Fernandes. 
</P>
<P>
The seizure warrants served Friday in South Florida, covering $17.6 million, 
were for accounts in which investigators have concluded that there was 
"probable cause" to believe the money was drug proceeds, Fernandes said 
Saturday. He said he did not have any details on what seizure orders might have 
been issued in other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
The warrants were served on bank officers for 72 accounts at 20 South Florida 
banks -- a legal step in the process of transfering the suspected drug cartel 
money to federal coffers. In all, accounts had been frozen in 78 Miami banks. 
</P>
<P>
The government also could prosecute bankers and the account holders after 
tracing the money, Fernandes said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we show complicity on the part of a bank or bank official or some 
representative of a corporation or a front corporation or what have you, that 
would be a separate part of the civil action," the DEA spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the account holders are preparing to fight the freezing or loss of 
funds, with some arguing they were involved in "flight capital" -- sending of 
assets from troubled foreign countries to the United States -- and not money 
laundering. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only way people in Colombia can have dollars in the United States to 
avoid inflation and other problems with the Colombian economy," said Fred 
Schwartz, an attorney for a Colombian industrialist with $600,000 in frozen 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz and other attorneys say their clients bought dollars in Latin America 
on the black market -- a huge pot of money swelled by the cocaine trade -- 
without knowing the cash was drug-tainted. 
</P>
<P>
The money then was transferred to U.S. accounts, often in violation of currency 
laws abroad, as a cushion against the vagaries of Latin American economics and 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department obtained a court order April 16 in Atlanta to freeze 
accounts in 173 banks in 22 states after investigators estimated Colombia's 
Medellin cartel amassed $1.2 billion from cocaine sales from 1987 to early 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials believe $400 million was returned to the United States to 
support drug trafficking.

TIRANA, Albania 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government of Albania, Europe's last Stalinist bastion, is under siege. 
</P>
<P>
Economic necessity and fears of following other East European Communist 
governments into oblivion are forcing the country's reluctant leadership to 
open what may be the most closed of Marxist societies and undertake limited 
domestic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Rarely since the Communists seized power in 1944 has the government appeared 
more vulnerable to unpredictable domestic and foreign forces, in the view of 
diplomats and analysts who are speculating about when -- not if -- the 
government here will fall. 
</P>
<P>
A five-day visit to Europe's most reclusive, repressive and impoverished 
country, a land of 3.2 million people on the mouth of the Adriatic Sea flanked 
by Yugoslavia and Greece, suggested that the Albanian government is becoming 
defensive about the hard-line, isolationist philosophy under which it has 
governed. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Albanian leadership, which long ago distanced itself from 
other Communist powers and insists that it will not follow other East European 
countries down the road of reform, is trying to impose gradual change from 
above, out of fear of being swept out of power from below. As one diplomat put 
it, Albania is experimenting with perestroika -- Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's name for his restructuring efforts -- "without calling it 
perestroika." 
</P>
<P>
But diplomats and other analysts say the changes being made by the country's 
leaders are likely to accelerate demands for change from a people said to be 
tired of the secret police repression, lack of basic freedoms and shortages of 
meat, milk, soap, toilet paper and consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
"This time something is brewing," said a foreign visitor with extensive 
knowledge of Albania. "People are ready to explode." 
</P>
<P>
In December, students at Tirana University protested a lack of adequate heating 
as well as other living conditions, according to reports. Then, in mid-January, 
a student-led demonstration erupted in the northern city of Shkoder, according 
to reports accepted as accurate by foreign governments. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd's attempts to tear down a statue of the late Soviet dictator Josef 
Stalin sparked speculation about a nascent democracy movement in this country, 
where dissidence in the past has been met with ruthless repression. As many as 
400 arrests were made in Shkoder, according to specialists in the West who 
follow Albanian affairs, and about 100 people are believed still in custody. 
</P>
<P>
Some specialists speculate that pro-democracy sentiment here could be focused 
in Shkoder, with a long Roman Catholic record of anti-Communist resistance, and 
in the increasingly restive ethnic Greek community. Together, the Christian 
minorities make up about one-fifth of the population in the atheist state. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the ruling Communists have kept the population in line through a 
mixture of repression, nationalist pride and fear of foreign invasion. 
</P>
<P>
But now, the government faces dangers for which the thousands of concrete 
bunkers scattered across the land serve no practical purpose. Ingredients for 
turmoil are at hand despite the reputation for effective repression of the 
Sigurimi, the pervasive and dreaded secret police. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Albania is strapped for hard currency. Furthermore, insufficient 
rains this winter point to a third successive bad harvest, and the government 
recently announced cutbacks in hydroelectric power. Albania's ill-maintained 
and obsolete industrial plant is nearing exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the collectivization of farming and sizable food exports for hard 
currency, the government is barely able to feed Europe's poorest -- per capita 
annual income is estimated at under $900 -- and fastest-growing population, 
which increases by about 60,000 people every year. 
</P>
<P>
People's expectations also appear to be rising. Because of access to Greek, 
Italian and Yugoslav television, Albanians are aware of events abroad, and some 
indicated in conversations here that they are impatient for a consumer society. 
An English-speaking Albanian university student in Tirana spoke knowledgeably 
about CBS, NBC and American serials broadcast in English on Yugoslav 
television. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, party propaganda sounds increasingly defensive. "We could have been 
a second Switzerland," said a Communist Party tour guide, "but we preferred our 
independence and feel proud that we did not hold out our hands to anyone for 
aid." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, such appeals to nationalist pride have struck a deep chord among 
Albanians for whom the last 45 years of Communist rule represent their longest 
unbroken period of independence. Albanian history has been marked by five 
centuries of Ottoman occupation, neighbors' efforts to partition the country 
after formal independence was declared in 1912 and an Italian invasion during 
World War II. It is not at all clear if such an appeal will have the same 
effect now. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Communist leader Ramiz Alia has reacted cautiously to the growing 
pressures. In late January, the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of 
Labor, as the Communists call themselves, adopted potentially significant 
reforms. But they stopped well short of following Communist parties in other 
countries that abolished their guaranteed leading role in society and 
introduced multiparty democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Key measures approved here included decentralizing political and economic 
decision-making, introducing production incentives, developing private home 
ownership and improving Albania's much criticized human rights record. 
</P>
<P>
Under consideration is penal code reform, including a reduction in the long 
list of infractions punishable by death, and re-establishment of the Justice 
Ministry and the right of a defendant to have a lawyer, both of which were 
abolished in 1967. Such changes would eliminate the people's tribunals that 
human rights organizations abroad have criticized as allowing condemnations on 
the basis of little more than hearsay. 
</P>
<P>
In the first, if indirect, response to charges of failing to provide official 
information about political prisoners, the government said in March that 83 of 
the country's 3,850 prison inmates were detained for seeking to overthrow it 
"by violence." Other sources said there may be 15,000 to 20,000 political 
prisoners. The last annual report of Amnesty International, the London-based 
human rights monitoring group, said, "It is impossible to estimate their 
numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the reforms appear to reverse trends toward greater agricultural 
collectivization and centralized industrial planning. But so far, no enabling 
legislation has been adopted, despite repeated promises in recent weeks by 
high-placed Albanian officials that the rubber-stamp Parliament will act this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The delay has sparked speculation that Alia and his pragmatic allies are being 
stymied by old-guard Stalinists grouped around the widow of Enver Hoxha, the 
government's founder who ran Albania with an iron hand for four decades by 
liquidating rivals. 
</P>
<P>
Five years after his death, Hoxha's influence is still felt, thanks to a 
personality cult featuring billboard exhortations from 69 published volumes of 
his writings, statues, photographs and an expensive memorial in Tirana. 
</P>
<P>
Underlining Alia's inability to put his personal stamp on domestic affairs is 
the fact that the ruling People's Assembly has been unchanged for the last six 
years. He has, however, encountered less resistance in foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Even before what Alia recently called "the tragedy" of the fall of East 
European communism, Albania sought to improve long-spurned relations with 
foreign governments and international institutions as a way out of its economic 
and financial predicament and self-imposed diplomatic isolation. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a constitutional clause outlawing foreign debt, the government has 
signed important deals with Western firms based on "buy back" provisions paying 
off foreign investment with products. 
</P>
<P>
An Italian firm is interested in offshore gas and oil prospecting rights and 
provides agricultural machinery and a regular truck ferry service to Trieste. 
West German firms are renovating chrome and nickel plants, and France recently 
signed an important contract to supply hydroelectric turbines. 
</P>
<P>
Business sources also have reported that Albania has streamlined its once 
cumbersome bureaucracy since the East European order collapsed in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
This winter, the government also signaled a desire for accommodation with the 
United States and the Soviet Union. In what diplomats called a 
characteristically Albanian rewriting of history, Deputy Foreign Minister 
Sokrat Placa told the Associated Press in February that the lack of relations 
with Washington is "not our making" and that "the ball is in their court." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps even more surprising has been Albania's improved ties with its southern 
neighbor, Greece, which persuaded Tirana to join a foreign ministers conference 
with four other Balkan powers. 
</P>
<P>
Only late last year, Greek Foreign Minister Antonis Samaras and the Greek 
Orthodox Church complained about human rights violations of the Greek minority, 
including a case involving four brothers caught trying to escape across the 
border and allegedly tortured and dragged through their village behind 
tractors. 
</P>
<P>
But early in April, Albania gave way in a landmark case involving a 28-year-old 
ethnic Greek who jumped over the Greek Embassy fence and sought asylum. The 
man, who had been imprisoned repeatedly for his religious beliefs, was issued a 
Greek passport and flown to Athens nine days later. 
</P>
<P>
Albanian determination to improve long-spurned relations with the rest of the 
world now centers on a visit scheduled this month by U.N. Secretary General 
Javier Perez de Cuellar. Although Perez de Cuellar is expected to raise human 
rights violations, his presence will help build Albania's self-image as a 
member of the world community. 
</P>
<P>
The government has proved adroit in suggesting that it will tolerate greater 
liberalization than it in fact does. For example, direct dial telephone service 
initiated and paid for by the U.N. Development Fund opened with 54 countries 
recently, an advance in telecommunications that elsewhere could be construed as 
opening yet another major window on the outside world. But few telephones, 
public and private, exist in Albania, and those that do can be easily 
monitored. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, visitors said they note a relaxation of suspicion and a greater 
tolerance for once-taboo foreign influences. 
</P>
<P>
Greek visitors, previously obliged to sleep in government-owned hotels where 
surveillance is assured, are now allowed to stay with Albanian relatives. Until 
last year, only Albanian emigres were allowed to enter on U.S. passports, but 
two American journalists were allowed to visit Albania with no more ado than an 
admonition to "write positive articles." 
</P>
<P>
That is a far cry from the days when dollars sent by emigre Albanians were 
returned as tainted capitalist money. Dollar shops are now located in major 
towns and offer refrigerators, television sets, tape decks and other consumer 
goods in exchange for family heirloom jewelry sold to the Albanian Central 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
What is more, running shoes, T-shirts, tape decks and pop music cassettes can 
be found among the young with families abroad who can provide them with 
once-banned Western imports or other ways to procure them. 
</P>
<P>
And starting this spring, more Albanians are expected to be allowed to go 
abroad on group visits to Greece, Italy and Turkey. In the past, few Albanians 
were allowed to travel abroad -- mostly party and government officials, 
university professors and other members of the Establishment.

Donald Trump may never set foot in the small southwest Houston bar but he still 
doesn't like its name. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Schaefer, owner of Trumps Pub, received a certified letter from a 
representative of the billionaire businessman ordering him to "cease and 
desist" false claims that "Donald Trump is endorsing your business activities." 
</P>
<P>
The letter from Joseph Silver threatened legal action if Schaefer did not come 
up with another name within 24 hours of receiving the letter. 
</P>
<P>
He said Trump owns the Donald Trump and Trump trademarks and that the Trump 
Organization has "people on retainer merely to do this type of work. We do this 
every day."

MORE JAPANESE WOMEN REJECT HOUSEWIFE ROLE : 'JOB WITH 3 FREE MEALS AND SIESTA'

<P>
A job with three free meals a day and time for a siesta. That's how one old 
Japanese saying describes the woman's role in marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Many Japanese women these days are rejecting that arrangement and getting 
divorces, although they often find it hard to earn a living on their own in 
Japan's heavily male-dominated society. 
</P>
<P>
Women have initiated 70% of the 155,000 divorces filed annually over the last 
10 years. There were none at all until the end of World War II, before which 
only men were entitled to dissolve a marriage. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan's divorce rate is still very low compared to Western nations," said 
Yoriko Madoka, a divorce counselor in Tokyo. "But it doesn't mean there are 
more happy families here. They just can't afford it financially." 
</P>
<P>
Madoka, a former journalist, said she started her business 12 years ago after 
seeing the cheerfulness of divorced women in Scandinavia. 
</P>
<P>
Divorce in Japan was traditionally seen as a disgrace for women, whose most 
important task in society was serving their family. Two divorced women who were 
interviewed for this article, for example, asked that their last names not be 
used. 
</P>
<P>
There are also financial consequences for divorced women. Most divorced women 
here receive little or no alimony. 
</P>
<P>
"It is amazing how people's attitudes have changed over the last 10 years," 
Madoka said. "But the gloomy image of divorce here will not disappear 
completely until women can get jobs to overcome financial difficulties after a 
divorce." 
</P>
<P>
"I really enjoy my life. It's like going back to my youth," said Sachiko, 42, 
who persuaded her husband to give her a divorce two years ago, one year after 
she left him and their two grown daughters in the western city of Osaka. 
</P>
<P>
She said that, like some other Japanese women, she put up with a violent, 
alcoholic husband for more than 20 years until her children could fend for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
After initially living with a friend and helping her run a coffee shop, Sachiko 
now works for a Tokyo company preparing tea and coffee for its employees. She 
has found a new partner and plans to marry soon. 
</P>
<P>
However, not many women are as lucky as Sachiko. 
</P>
<P>
Most companies will not employ women over 30, and statistics show that women 
who do find full-time work earn only 70% of their male counterparts' pay. That 
figure drops to 50% when part-timers are included. 
</P>
<P>
"This is why many women prefer to stay with their spouses even after all 
affection has gone," Madoka said. 
</P>
<P>
She recounts the case of one woman who had lived with her husband for decades 
but had hardly seen him in years. Her husband developed a relationship with 
another woman and only came home late at night to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
The woman once cooked lunch for her husband when he was sick and later found 
the empty dishes with money in a corridor at home. "I don't need your sympathy. 
I bought your service," he shouted from behind the door. 
</P>
<P>
Harumi, 38, has become a successful Tokyo business consultant after divorce 
left her with a 3-year-old son and just $12,500 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I usually don't feel discrimination," Harumi said. "But people are very 
jealous because I don't fit the image of a divorced woman struggling to 
survive. Even my colleagues tell dirty jokes about me when they're drunk." 
</P>
<P>
While the annual number of Japanese divorces has fluctuated over the last 
decade between 150,000 and a peak of 179,150 in 1983, divorces among people 
over 50 have doubled in that time and now make up 6% of the total. 
</P>
<P>
"It is common these days for women to demand a divorce from their retired 
husbands," said Toshihiko Hara, a sociologist at Tokai University. "They can't 
cope with their husbands sitting around at home the whole day." 
</P>
<P>
"That's the tragic generation," said Madoka. "They made a large sacrifice for 
Japan's economic miracle (after World War II), with men at the firm and women 
at home. Now, men are retiring to find they have also sacrificed their family."

COLLECTORS THREATEN TIBET'S ARTISTIC HERITAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from The Guardian 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tibet's artistic treasures are under threat from tourists and smugglers who 
bring them out of the country to sell to wealthy Western collectors. 
</P>
<P>
During the Cultural Revolution, thousands of Tibetan artifacts and religious 
objects were destroyed, melted down or systematically exported to China. 
</P>
<P>
Many more were saved from destruction by fervent ex-monks who worked in the 
fields during the day and by night buried their monastic treasures one by one 
in the frozen earth of the barren Tibetan mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Now that these treasures, and many family heirlooms, have been dug up and 
returned to their original places in rebuilt monasteries and family homes, a 
potentially more permanent danger threatens Tibet's cultural heritage. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists strolling through the streets of the Barkhor market in Lhasa are often 
nervously hailed by young Tibetans who whisper "Statue? Thangka (a religious 
painting)?" surreptitiously gesturing that the foreigner should follow them 
down the alleyways of the Tibetan quarter. 
</P>
<P>
At the height of the tourist influx in 1987-88, one Tibetan was openly hawking 
a thangka, which he claimed had been stolen from Sakya monastery. Impoverished 
Tibetans now sell their family treasures to eager Westerners willing to pay 
many times more than local traders. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest danger comes from the loose network of Western, Nepalese and 
Tibetan traders who carry old Tibetan handicraft and artwork across the 
Himalayas into the hands of shopkeepers or private collectors, with the promise 
of large profits. Concealing a thangka in the lining of a Thermos flask is now 
so common that customs officers at the Nepalese border are on the lookout for 
this method. 
</P>
<P>
Statues of Buddha are carried illegally over the Himalayan passes in the Mt. 
Everest region by Tibetans or Nepalese. Carpets often cross the border into 
Hong Kong as hand luggage. Experienced traders report that old carpets have 
become much harder to find in Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Tibetan Autonomous Region's Department of Culture, who are 
responsible for ensuring the preservation of Tibet's heritage, recently denied 
that there was a problem of relics being smuggled out. They point to the 
well-established law that prohibits the export of valuable relics made before 
1959, the year in which the Dalai Lama fled and Tibetan's traditional social 
and political system was destroyed in what Chinese history books call the 
"Democratic Reforms." 
</P>
<P>
There is no working definition, however, of which pre-1959 objects are 
valuable. Inexperienced customs officers have been known to impound common cast 
iron horse stirrups while passing over priceless thangkas.

SCIENTISTS WILL UNLEASH WASP TO SLOW ASH WHITEFLY; 
</P>
<P>
INFESTATION: CLOUDS OF THE PEST ARE EXPECTED TO RETURN THIS SUMMER. MEANINGFUL 
CONTROL IS YEARS AWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
That other menacing fly -- the pinhead-sized ash whitefly -- has returned after 
a wintertime reprieve to renew its ferocious attack on Southern California 
shade trees. This year, though, a deadly surprise might be lurking in the 
foliage for the bothersome pest. 
</P>
<P>
While an army of state agriculture officials is engaged in a full-scale battle 
with the Mediterranean fruit fly, a handful of entomologists have laid plans to 
launch the first large-scale assault against the ash whitefly. 
</P>
<P>
Later this month, they will set loose speck-sized, stingless wasps to prey on 
whitefly larvae. Between 25 and several hundred of the wasps will be dispersed 
at various Southern California locations, which scientists will closely monitor 
to determine how best to conduct a broader biological war later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The wasp releases will culminate a year of successful research that has 
identified at least one imported whitefly predator that can survive in 
California and eventually help control the flourishing populations, said UC 
Riverside scientists. Previously, it was thought that the whiteflies had no 
natural predators. 
</P>
<P>
A noticeable reduction in whitefly populations, however, is years away. It will 
take that long for wasp colonies to gain a stronghold against the pest. 
Exasperated residents, who competed for outdoor airspace with swarming flies 
during the height of last summer's infestation, can expect the same frustration 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, we can expect to find a whole lot of whiteflies again just like 
last year," said Kathy Brunetti, who oversees the state Department of 
Agriculture's whitefly task force. "But with any luck we will have to live with 
this for only a few more years." 
</P>
<P>
Last September, infestations became so dense that afternoon breezes stirred up 
whitefly clouds, ruining back-yard barbecues and gatherings. Those who braved 
the swarms complained that they were often forced to cover their mouths to 
avoid inhaling the flies. Sticky dew excreted by the whitefly coated cars and 
was tracked inside homes, dirtying floors and carpets. 
</P>
<P>
"We are already starting to see them show up," said BJ Hegedus of North 
Hollywood, whose front yard is shaded by a tall ash tree. "We are bracing for 
the worst again. Although I can't imagine it getting much worse than last year. 
I can't help but think how many I swallowed." 
</P>
<P>
Public demand for whitefly relief is so strong that the locations of the May 
test releases are not being disclosed because researchers fear that homeowners 
will steal the wasps to combat their own infestations. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are calling us asking us for wasps to release in their own 
yard," said Janet White, a spokeswoman for UC Riverside scientists conducting 
whitefly studies. "We don't want people to know precisely where they are. We 
don't want them disturbed." 
</P>
<P>
In July, a panel of county agricultural commissioners will select 12 counties 
to receive limited wasp supplies. James Harnett, Orange County agricultural 
commissioner and chairman of the whitefly committee, said the wasp will likely 
be released in the most heavily infested regions. 
</P>
<P>
The ash whitefly, first identified in California in 1988 at a Van Nuys fruit 
stand, is viewed primarily as an urban nuisance by the state Department of Food 
and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
The fly damages popular shade and ornamental trees, such as ash and pear, by 
sucking juice from the undersides of leaves, weakening and sometimes 
defoliating trees. It also favors apple, citrus, pomegranate and olive trees. 
The insect does not directly attack fruit. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the Mediterranean fruit fly, decried by farmers and state 
officials as a grave threat to agriculture, is the target of an aggressive 
eradication campaign. The Medfly lays it eggs in a wide variety of fruit and 
vegetables, ruining the produce for market. 
</P>
<P>
Ash whitefly infestations have become fully established throughout Los Angeles, 
Orange and Riverside counties. Since 1988, the fly has invaded 16 California 
counties from San Diego to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Officials suspect that the insect had been taking hold for a year or more 
before the outbreak was noticed, but residents with infested trees did not 
report the infestation because other whitefly species commonly invade yards. 
</P>
<P>
Pesticide applications won't work against the whitefly because of the 
infestation's magnitude. Also, it is difficult to knock the fly down with 
sprays, because it lives shielded beneath leaves, entomologists said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is so widespread we can't eradicate it," Brunetti said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year scientists journeyed to Israel and Italy, where the whitefly is fully 
entrenched, and brought back the Encarsia wasp species. Scientists said several 
natural whitefly enemies will be needed to establish permanent control of the 
pest. A beetle imported from Israel is under study. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe biological control is the most economically and biologically sound 
approach," said Tim Paine, a UC Riverside entomologist. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists and agricultural officials say it is impossible for homeowners to 
eliminate the fly on their property because within hours a neighbor's 
whiteflies will infest the tree. 
</P>
<P>
Paine said it would take large doses of pesticide to kill the whiteflies 
infesting a 40-foot-tall ash tree, and the attempt might burn leaves and 
further weaken the tree.

MCCASKILL ON WAY TO AN 11-3 ROMP.

<P>
It is a measure of the Angels' state that Luis Polonia, who has appeared in a 
mere four games, already feels an urgency to do more than he can reasonably be 
expected to do. 
</P>
<P>
"Even myself, I am feeling a little bit of pressure. They expect so much from 
me," said Polonia, who has scored four runs in four games. "I'm getting my hits 
myself and I'm thinking I'm trying to do so much. I want to do so much for this 
team. Today, I was out of control. I was getting myself out. I want to do good 
so bad." 
</P>
<P>
Bad is the way things are turning out, if not for Polonia, then for the Angels. 
Their 11-3 loss to the New York Yankees Saturday before a season-high crowd of 
47,933 at Anaheim Stadium was their third loss in a row, seventh in 10 games 
and 12th in 17. It was also the third consecutive time their starting pitcher 
was hit hard and the second time in three games their opponent reached double 
figures in hits and runs. 
</P>
<P>
In their last 26 innings, they have allowed 22 earned runs and been outscored, 
26-13. 
</P>
<P>
"As a team, we're not hitting on all cylinders," said starter Kirk McCaskill 
(2-1), who had yielded three earned runs in his previous four starts and was 
charged with six Saturday, all in a fourth-inning spree that brought nine 
Yankees to the plate. "You can force it as much as you want, but until things 
work themselves out, you have to work to get through it." 
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old right-hander, who is 0-4 against the Yankees in his career, 
cruised through three innings and was protecting the 1-0 lead provided him on 
Dante Bichette's double and Jack Howell's sacrifice fly in the second. Then 
came the six-hit fourth, which was as far as he went. 
</P>
<P>
"They put the bat on the ball and they found holes," said McCaskill, whose 
earned-run average rose from 1.07 to 2.76. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, the most damaging hits were the run-scoring double by Claudell 
Washington, who was sent to New York in the Polonia trade, and Mike Blowers' 
single through the hole between short and third after the Angels intentionally 
walked Bob Geren -- a .351 hitter -- to get to Blowers, who carried a .208 
average into the game. 
</P>
<P>
But Angel Manager Doug Rader rued the fielder's-choice grounder by No. 9 hitter 
Alvaro Espinoza as much as the extra-base hit. 
</P>
<P>
"After the first couple of innings, I thought (McCaskill) would breeze," he 
said. "The ball that Blowers hit, I couldn't believe. Then Jackie lays back on 
Espinoza's ball. We should have turned two on that. Actually, that was the 
ballgame. I'm not hanging this on Jack Howell. That's what happens to you when 
things aren't going particularly well." 
</P>
<P>
Getting only one out on Espinoza's grounder kept the inning alive for Steve 
Sax's run-scoring double -- which gave the Yankees a 4-1 lead -- and a two-run 
single by Roberto Kelly, which put the game away at 6-1. Reliever Sherman 
Corbett fared even worse than McCaskill, giving up five hits and five earned 
runs in 1 1/3 innings, as every Yankee starter except Espinoza got a hit. 
</P>
<P>
Rader didn't want to criticize his club's offense, but the facts are plain. The 
Angels, who have a league-low team batting average of .231, have yet to score 
more than three runs in an inning this season and haven't scored three in an 
inning in their last 41 innings. They've done it only once in their last 64 
innings. Opponents have scored five runs in an inning three times, six once, 
seven once, and nine once. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult to do things offensively when you're behind by a great 
number of runs," Rader said, "but I didn't think the game was over because we 
gave up three or four runs. We need to make plays and convert outs. Kirk said 
the ball was finding holes -- you give guys enough opportunities, they're going 
to find holes. The whole object is to minimize those opportunities so there 
will be fewer holes." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels insisted they can't force themselves out of their doldrums, and 
Yankee first baseman Don Mattingly agreed. He should know: New York was on a 
five-game losing streak before prevailing over Mark Langston Friday and 
McCaskill Saturday and had been sputtering offensively. 
</P>
<P>
"It turns around quick," he said. "Wally (Joyner), Chili (Davis), those guys 
are going to hit. They always have. It's just a matter of time, just like it 
was for us. They could all get hot tomorrow, but hopefully they won't until 
after we leave." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Angels have suggested that infielder Mark McLemore give up switch-hitting 
at least temporarily in favor of hitting right-handed. McLemore was hitting 
.125 overall, which broke down to .077 left-handed (two for 26) and .214 
right-handed (three for 14) before Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
Dante Bichette entered Saturday's game with 27 hits, a figure he didn't reach 
last season until his 46th game. He extended his hitting streak to 11 games 
with a second-inning double. . . . Brian Downing was not in Saturday's lineup 
and did not appear at all in the Angels' previous five games. . . . John Orton 
started at catcher for the first time since last Sunday, when he injured his 
left shoulder in a home-plate collision. He was hitless in his five previous 
Anaheim Stadium at-bats this season.

SOUTH AFRICA: AFTER DECADES OF ISOLATION, THE NATION WANTS TO REJOIN SPORTS 
WORLD

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Flying to South Africa requires patience and perspective. All of Africa seems 
to be spread out below as the plane zigzags its way to Johannesburg on a 
curious route. The plane must burrow through endless clouds, for although its 
presence in African airspace may be tolerated, the plane may not land unless 
invited. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Kilimanjaro, snow-capped and majestic, juts abruptly from the desert floor, 
rising like a kingdom in the clouds. Miles later, the outline of Nairobi's 
airport comes into view. Landing there, the jumbo jet spits out streams of 
khaki-clad tourists with a clattering of cameras. 
</P>
<P>
After spending a long night on the plane, passengers continuing their journey 
are eager to get out and stretch their legs during the two-hour layover. But an 
announcement from the captain puts an end to that glad possibility. Those 
passengers bound for Johannesburg, South Africa, the captain said, are asked to 
remain on board, at the request of the Kenyan authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Viewed from the plane's window, the Tarmac shimmers in the summer heat. The 
plane bound for South Africa sits alone on the runway, like an unwelcome 
insect. 
</P>
<P>
In a very real way, getting to South Africa is a metaphor for being there. 
International sanctions do not make it easy. It can be circuitous. If you are 
going to South Africa, for whatever reason, there are places where you no 
longer will be welcome. The country's own consulate advises against having a 
South African stamp on your passport. It can be infinitely complicated. 
</P>
<P>
Having gotten there, through the tsk-tsking of international opinion, it 
doesn't take long to sense the isolation. The world does not want to come here, 
and people here aren't free to move about the world. In a sports sense, it is 
as if South Africa is a nation of children, possessing a beautiful playground 
and wondrous toys, but no friends come to play. And every day they watch and 
wait. 
</P>
<P>
But South Africa has grown weary of waiting. Three generations of athletes have 
stood by and watched. Now they want to play. After decades of boycotts -- 
economic, diplomatic, cultural and sporting -- this nation says it deserves the 
right to play with the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
APARTHEID: "A Terrible Dream" 
</P>
<P>
The root of South Africa's isolation is apartheid -- the country's legislated 
and systematic policy of racial separation that has been the law of the land 
since 1948. And, although some reform has occurred in 42 years, the basic 
tenets of apartheid are still firmly in place. The world's response to 
apartheid has been to punish and shun South Africa through a series of measures 
aimed at disrupting the country's status quo. 
</P>
<P>
The longest, and to some the hardest hitting, of all sanctions has been South 
Africa's sports isolation. It began, perhaps, in 1956, when the International 
Table Tennis Federation expelled the South African Table Tennis Union, and for 
the past 30 years, South Africa has been the pariah of sporting nations. 
</P>
<P>
No country has been subject to anything remotely like the sports isolation 
South Africa has experienced. South African athletes have not been allowed to 
compete in the Olympic Games since 1960. There is an international ban that 
forbids any athlete in any Olympic sport from competing in South Africa. There 
is an international "contamination rule" that forbids competition against a 
South African athlete anywhere in the world. South African citizens who wanted 
to watch the 1988 Seoul Olympics in South Korea were told to leave. South 
African journalists wanting to cover the Games were denied credentials. 
</P>
<P>
The state-run South African Broadcasting Co. is not permitted to buy the 
broadcast rights to many of the world's premier sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
South African society has helped fashion its own noose, however. Three decades 
of isolation has come solely because of what has been called "a terrible dream" 
-- apartheid. Apartheid is the mechanism that has kept South Africa's nonwhite 
athletes from an opportunity for comparable competition, training, coaching and 
facilities within the country. Apartheid classifies South Africa's people into 
four strict groups -- African for the black population, Asian for the East 
Indian population, colored for the mixed-race, and white. 
</P>
<P>
The open oppression of the majority -- of South Africa's 36 million people, 27 
million are black, 5 million white, 3 million colored and 1 million Asian -- 
has been enough to keep the world away. The international bans forbidding 
sporting contact with South Africa have been thorough and steadfast. In fact, 
the solidarity that members of the international sporting community display on 
this issue makes it unique. Where else can the United States and Soviet Union 
line up in complete agreement? 
</P>
<P>
Officially, South Africa's isolation is complete. However, sports officials and 
leaders in the private sector occasionally finance so-called rebel tours -- 
athletes from "outside" are brought in at tremendous expense to perform in much 
the same way as entertainers such as Frank Sinatra sing in nearby Sun City for 
$2 million a night. 
</P>
<P>
There is incentive for the promoters, too. The Income Tax Allowance Bill of 
1986 allows a promoter of an international sporting event a maximum deduction 
of 180%. The law asks that qualifying events must show a material advantage to 
South Africa. The government views this tax break as a small price to pay to 
encourage international visitors and ease the sense of isolation. 
</P>
<P>
Companies are lining up to take advantage. In 1988, it was estimated that South 
African businesses spent $120 million in sports sponsorships and promotions. 
Sports-related advertising accounted for about 15% of the total ad sales in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
So starved are South Africans for contact that money is seemingly no object 
when it comes to luring athletes. Money has to be the incentive, because most 
athletes who defy the bans and compete here are themselves banned for years 
from their sports, thus ironically completing their solidarity with South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The system of pay-for-play is an interesting example of market efficiency: 
South Africa creates a market for foreign athletes by offering them enough 
money to compensate for bans or suspensions. Once banned, the athletes are 
bonded to South Africa because there is no other place in the world that will 
allow them to compete. So, they return year after year, and the system steams 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
South African sports leaders have been creative in providing incentive for 
athletes to stay here, because there are methods for South Africans -- using 
false passports and names -- to travel and compete abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Money has been an effective motivator. In this, South Africa is no different 
from any other nation. For top athletes, especially top white athletes, there 
is a lot of money to be made in amateur sports. Aside from prize money, which 
is awarded at even the smallest competition, there is a large pool of 
endorsement dollars available to the athlete who markets himself with savvy. 
</P>
<P>
Large South African companies are looking for a black athlete to use as a 
spokesman, too, but corporate executives say too often a poor education and 
difficulty with the language limit the opportunities for black athletes. Others 
note the irony here, since it is precisely limited opportunities, especially in 
education, that keep blacks from sharing in South Africa's wealth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SPORTS: South Africa's 'Soft Underbelly' 
</P>
<P>
The various international sports organizations knew what they were doing when 
they cut off South Africa. The nation has weathered the economic and cultural 
boycotts with some hardship, but with ingenuity and an inward turn. South 
Africans aren't allowed to see Woody Allen or Spike Lee films, but the 
country's own film industry is thriving. 
</P>
<P>
The problem for sports is more complicated. Whereas South African artists and 
writers, for example, have flourished, athletes -- who almost by definition 
must compete -- have been retarded in their growth. Athletes become weary of 
facing the same competition before the same spectators, able to compare only on 
paper their abilities against foreign athletes, and then only in certain 
sports. They long to see new faces or even the colors of a different uniform. 
There is talent here, but there is also stagnation. 
</P>
<P>
The international sports boycotts have hit at what one official here called 
"South Africa's soft underbelly," for sports are the embodiment of South 
African pride and culture. 
</P>
<P>
Observed David Tothill, South Africa's ambassador to Australia: "Denying South 
Africans the means of expressing their own feelings of nationalism through the 
medium of sport is probably one of the sports boycott's hidden objectives." 
</P>
<P>
In the rest of the world, where participation in the Olympic Games is taken for 
granted, sports surely have their place in society, but a jaded public may fail 
to be impressed with Olympic medals in colors other than gold. In South Africa, 
sports are held on a higher plane. Perhaps the very act of denying this nation 
the right to compete with the rest of the world has created in South Africans a 
heightened regard for the things they cannot have. 
</P>
<P>
What they do have, at every turn, is the back of sports' hand. 
</P>
<P>
"Since 1960, total isolation; there was disappointment in South Africa as you 
have never seen before," said Johan Du Plessis, President of the South African 
National Olympic Committee. "Because of our climate and because of our 
inheritance, we are so sports-inclined. Sport is part and parcel of the daily 
life of a South African. 
</P>
<P>
"You must remember that all over South Africa, international competition is the 
motivation behind everything. The ability and the possibility of a tour to the 
outside world is something that stimulates a sport and it grows. This is 
applicable not only to white people, but also to the blacks, Indian and the 
colored." 
</P>
<P>
At first, sports officials scrambled to offer athletes something to compensate 
for what they were missing. They organized the South African Games -- a 
multi-sport, multinational competition -- on the theory that if South Africa 
couldn't go to the world, the world could be brought to South Africa. The last 
South African Games, in 1973, marked the last time the country has played host 
to an international multisport competition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SPORTS AND POLITICS: An Intimate Relationship 
</P>
<P>
It is popular to speak of "the marriage of sports and politics" in the context 
of contemporary international sports. Adolf Hitler and Jimmy Carter surely had 
political agendas in mind that eventually affected the Olympic Games of 1936 
and 1980. And so it has been, almost since the Games' inception. Recent history 
shows, however, that the world learned many of these lessons at South Africa's 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who married sports and politics were South Africans," said Jannie 
Momberg, a member of Parliament from the liberal Democratic party and a former 
official in South Africa's track and field federation. "This country has banned 
Japanese jockeys because they were nonwhite. We have a long, long list of 
government and politics and sport being placed together here. We are the last 
to complain." 
</P>
<P>
South Africa has meddled time and again in another nation's business when it 
came to the preservation of the racial purity of South African sports. South 
African sports officials have demanded rosters of visiting teams to root out 
unwelcome nonwhite players. South African sports officials have told teams they 
must not bring black athletes, even classifying an entire Brazilian soccer team 
as mixed-race and therefore unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
The popular expression here among anti-government organizers is this: No normal 
sport in an abnormal society. 
</P>
<P>
The hard-liners require from athletes a strict sacrifice for the cause: No 
participation in any government-sponsored event or program. 
</P>
<P>
Given the extent of government presence in almost any endeavor in South Africa, 
that places off-limits nearly every sporting opportunity, including school 
sports and club sports, unless they are non-racial. 
</P>
<P>
And since the anti-apartheid movement here can ill afford to organize and 
provide alternative equipment, coaches, facilities and transportation of their 
own, the children are left with nothing. Sometimes the athlete who decides to 
compete anyway is given a harsh lesson in the realpolitik of sports in South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Plaatjes, the former South African marathon champion, was twice threatened 
with necklacing, a brutal form of township punishment reserved for 
"collaborators" in which a tire is placed around the victim's neck, doused with 
gasoline and set afire. 
</P>
<P>
Plaatjes, who is colored, was singled out because he was a high-profile 
nonwhite and because he wanted to run. To do so in South Africa meant competing 
for the South African Amateur Athletic Assn., the only body sponsoring track 
and field. 
</P>
<P>
"What I object to is, they don't offer any alternative," Plaatjes said of the 
anti-apartheid sports groups. Because of the increased threats against him and 
his family, Plaatjes sought political asylum in the United States and has 
applied for citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
"They tell athletes they must not compete because that will be seen as 
supporting the government," Plaatjes said. "Fine, but they offer no form of 
competition themselves. Athletes want to express themselves and they have a 
finite time to do so. These people say, 'Wait until things are better.' I think 
that is harmful to nonwhite athletes in South Africa. Why not compete and show 
the whites how good we are?" 
</P>
<P>
An underlying philosophy of the boycott is that sports offer diversion from the 
drudgery of daily life, a brief escape from reality. The sports boycott seeks 
to force the white South Africans to face the reality in their country. Another 
way to view boycotts is to understand that the majority of South Africans are 
boycotted daily by their own government. 
</P>
<P>
Apartheid's grand scheme of "separateness" of races has been realized to such a 
degree that any joining together has at times seemed impossible. 
</P>
<P>
However, in South Africa, the love of sport has often taken precedence over the 
rule of law. 
</P>
<P>
Harsh and restrictive apartheid laws were often ignored when applied to 
sportsmen. Parliament has amended some laws to allow mixing in sport. For 
example, black athletes arriving from overseas would normally be subject to 
laws restricting their freedom to move about the country and stay where they 
wish. That was circumvented by the granting of "honorary white" status to 
nonwhite athletes for the duration of their stay. 
</P>
<P>
A solution to the problem of housing foreign athletes was to designate certain 
hotels as "international hotels," where whites and nonwhites would be allowed 
to mix. This solution eased tension among foreign business travelers, too. 
</P>
<P>
The Group Areas Act, which separated the country into racial zones, was amended 
to allow mixing not only on the field at an athletic event, but also among 
spectators, which had been forbidden by law. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Pass Laws were rescinded, nonwhites were required to carry at all 
times a passport-sized booklet that contained the proper papers permitting them 
to be in an all-white area. During that time, if blacks ran in a marathon whose 
course went through an all-white area, the black runner was required to pin a 
photocopied page of his pass to his running uniform or be subject to arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the changes announced by President Frederik W. de Klerk in February, 
apartheid remains and prevents nonwhite South Africans from having access to 
some public facilities. The Separate Amenities Act has legislated the strict 
segregation of buses, theaters and libraries, for example. Sports and 
recreation facilities are common sites for segregation. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, most public beaches were opened to blacks. Previously, a black was 
allowed to be on a white beach only as a nursemaid to a white child. The 
Separate Amenities Act was the law the Dutch Reformed Church used to permit 
blacks to enter its churches to clean them, but not to pray in them. 
</P>
<P>
Not all public pools are integrated. In Pretoria, the seat of the national 
government, the city only two months ago allowed nonwhites to fish for the 
first time at Rietvlei Dam. Even that decision was met with vigorous 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Since the release in February of jailed black leader Nelson Mandela, the 
political climate in South Africa has been highly charged. So, too, has been 
the climate for negotiations in sports. The recent political changes have made 
all the issues more urgent, and sports officials here believe that they, at 
last, may have some momentum. However, never before has the situation been so 
delicate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE ISSUE: People, not Pawns 
</P>
<P>
Bessie Windell coaches a track and field team in Pretoria. While keeping one 
eye on her charges before a meet one night recently, she listed the 
difficulties of coaching athletes who can never go anywhere to compete. 
</P>
<P>
"To keep them going and motivated is really hard," she said. "They never have 
any competition. My attitude is to never run them against anyone in practice, 
only (against) the watch. That way they can learn to push themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I must tell you, whenever I get an athlete who can make it, really make it, I 
have two feelings at once. First, I am excited, because this is what a coach 
works for. Then, I am sad. I know they will never get the competition, they can 
never go to the Olympics. They are not allowed. This is the way we have in 
South Africa. It is the hard way." 
</P>
<P>
The frustration is evident in nearly every athlete and coach. Myrtle Bothma, 
ranked No. 1 in the world this season in the 400-meter hurdles, has still not 
quietly accepted her plight. Bothma, who is white, echoes the popular sentiment 
from athletes -- why hold us responsible for a political system we can do 
nothing about? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how hurting me, not allowing me to run against the best 400-meter 
hurdlers in the world, is going to help anything," she said. "If they don't 
want the white sportsmen to take part, why don't they take the black man? We 
would love to see it. 
</P>
<P>
"You get a feeling, a kind of anger towards people who sit around a table in 
their little suits and look at a little bit of paper and say, 'South Africa, 
no.' They don't know what it's like to be a sportsman, to struggle, to work. 
They can decide my future. 
</P>
<P>
"One day, I wish I was a fly with a sting. I could sit in that boardroom with 
the (International Olympic Committee) in their meeting. When they decide not to 
let South Africa compete, I would give them one sting, to make them think what 
are they doing. I think they see the issue as something on a piece of paper, 
not people."

HEALTHY DODGERS WIN, 3-0; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: MORGAN NO-HITS PHILLIES INTO THE SIXTH INNING, THEN WITHSTANDS 
EIGHTH- AND NINTH-INNING RALLIES TO RUN HIS RECORD TO 4-1.

<P>
Surely the Dodgers, being a group of sensible millionaires, aren't buying Tom 
Lasorda's constant, impassioned rhetoric about how they can survive despite 
injuries to the heart of their team. 
</P>
<P>
Or are they? 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers won again, 3-0, Saturday over Philadelphia and left their manager 
hoarse again in the process. The victory included: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A pitcher, who entered the season with three shutouts in 197 major league 
appearances, throwing his second shutout in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two hitters, who had not hit a home run in the previous two weeks, 
combining to hit the Dodgers' first back-to-back homers in nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A center fielder making the defensive play of the game near the left-field 
foul line. 
</P>
<P>
"I've reminded them and reminded them, and I'm going to keep reminding them," 
Lasorda said quietly. "We will battle. We will not stop believing. No matter 
who we lose, we can still win." 
</P>
<P>
Before 25,290 at Veterans Stadium, Mike Morgan showed he believes. In winning 
for the fourth time in five starts while lowering his earned-run average to 
1.40, he held the Phillies hitless until Len Dykstra singled with one out in 
the sixth inning. Then Morgan cooly survived eighth- and ninth-inning rallies 
for his second shutout in 12 days. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, he would be looking over his shoulder down at the bullpen, 
looking for help," second baseman Willie Randolph said. "But now, he knows can 
he it himself. He knows he can shut it down himself. So he does." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan was probably the only person in the park not visibly moved by the two 
outside forces that helped him to his victory. 
</P>
<P>
In the second inning -- after Eddie Murray's single off starter and loser Ken 
Howell -- Hubie Brooks and Mike Scioscia unloaded consecutive home runs. It was 
the Dodgers' first back-to-back homers since May 14, 1989. Those home runs also 
were in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
It was Brooks' first homer and only his third and fourth runs batted in since 
April 20. It was Scioscia's first homer and only his fourth RBI since April 17. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I start to think about it, and it bothers me when I am leaving guys on 
base," said Brooks, who leads the team with five home runs and 15 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Remember last winter when Juan Samuel said it bothered him to play center 
field? He betrayed that opinion Saturday in the Dodgers' other big play, one 
that made Lasorda marvel. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you see that?" Lasorda asked. "Did you see him hustle?" 
</P>
<P>
It was in the seventh inning, when Morgan found trouble after Ricky Jordan beat 
out a slow roller to third base. John Kruk followed with a fly ball to the 
left-field wall. Kal Daniels leaped in vain as the ball bounced off the wall 
and back over his head toward the infield. 
</P>
<P>
It was a certain double that may have scored Jordan . . . except Samuel was 
there to catch that bounce. He ran over from center field to a spot less than 
30 feet from the left-field foul line. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, rounding second and heading for third, was stunned. Samuel threw to 
third baseman Lenny Harris, who began a rundown play in which Jordan was tagged 
out. Dickie Thon followed with a single to right field before David Hollins 
flied out to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
After giving up a one-out double by Jordan in the ninth inning, Morgan retired 
Kruk on a line drive and Thon on a grounder to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just instinct, I see the ball and I run after it . . . and I guess I 
got a little help from the runner," said Samuel of his play. 
</P>
<P>
Said Lasorda: "Can you imagine what would have happened if he did not make that 
play?" 
</P>
<P>
It's almost like imagining the Dodgers without outfielder Kirk Gibson, third 
baseman Jeff Hamilton, bullpen stopper Jay Howell and starting pitcher Orel 
Hershiser. 
</P>
<P>
Without Gibson all season, they are 14-11. Since Hamilton went down with 
shoulder problems, they are 10-8. Since losing Howell with knee problems, 6-5 
with six complete games from the starting pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
And since Hershiser went out with a torn shoulder after his April 26 start, 
they have gone 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
"At first the injuries were in the back of everyone's mind. We were all trying 
not to bring it up," infielder Mike Sharperson said. "But now it's like, 
baseball is not going to stop. So we're not going to stop." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson ran the bases for the first time since the end of spring training. 
He ran them just four times and at less than full speed. Batting practice will 
begin as soon as he can run the bases hard, which could be in a week. Plans are 
to return him to the lineup within three weeks after he begins taking batting 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
While Jim Gott was not perfect in his first rehabilitation start for Class-A 
Bakersfield Friday (he gave up two runs -- one earned -- on four hits in three 
innings), the Dodgers were satisfied enough that he will make a second start 
Monday against Palm Springs. He remains on schedule to join the active roster 
when the team returns from the trip May 14.

IT'S UNBRIDLED, NOT UNBEATEN; 
</P>
<P>
HORSE RACING: COLT SHOWS HIS IMPROVEMENT SINCE BLUE GRASS WITH 3 1/2-LENGTH 
VICTORY OVER SUMMER SQUALL. MISTER FRISKY IS EIGHTH, 19 1/4 LENGTHS BACK.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unbridled, the unappreciated, won the 116th running of the Kentucky Derby 
Saturday, soundly beating Summer Squall and Mister Frisky, two more glamorous 
horses that sniffed the lilies instead of the roses at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
Mister Frisky, undefeated in 16 races, which made him the most successful Derby 
starter ever, was sent off as the 19-10 favorite. Then he became the 11th 
consecutive public choice to fail here. The Santa Anita Derby winner had the 
lead briefly on the far turn before he faltered, finishing eighth in the 
15-horse field, 19 1/4 lengths behind Unbridled. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall, who had won seven of eight races, was the 2-1 second choice of 
the crowd of 128,257, and while giving a better account of himself than Mister 
Frisky, he was no match for Unbridled when the telltale running began. Summer 
Squall finished second, 3 1/2 lengths back and added to jockey Pat Day's legacy 
in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Day, who has won more races than anybody in the long history of Churchill 
Downs, is winless in eight tries in the Derby. The frustration was compounded 
Saturday, because Summer Squall gave Day an unprecedented three consecutive 
second-place finishes, and Unbridled is a horse that Day rode as recently as 
mid-March, when they won the Florida Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Day also won a race at Gulfstream Park with Summer Squall that day, and said 
after the Florida Derby that he was leaning toward Unbridled as his Kentucky 
Derby horse. But after Summer Squall won the Jim Beam at Turfway Park two weeks 
later, Day dropped his option on Unbridled, sending Saturday's winner back to 
Craig Perret. 
</P>
<P>
In the Blue Grass on a muddy track at Keeneland three weeks ago, Day rode 
Summer Squall to another victory, with Unbridled and Perret finishing third, 3 
3/4 lengths back. 
</P>
<P>
Perret, 39, won on his fourth Derby mount, coming close with third-place Awe 
Inspiring last year and with runner-up Bet Twice in 1987. Perret thought that 
the Blue Grass was a useful race for Unbridled, and that it improved him about 
four lengths -- or the distance needed to perhaps beat Summer Squall. 
</P>
<P>
"I was wrong," Perret said Saturday. "After I worked him here, I felt that he 
had moved up about eighth lengths. Our goal was not to win the Blue Grass, our 
goal was to win the Derby." 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall finished six lengths ahead of Pleasant Tap, the 40-1 shot. It was 
another three lengths back to Video Ranger, the horse from the $40,000 claiming 
ranks who was 1 1/4 lengths better than Silver Ending, the Arkansas Derby 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
Reaching the wire, in order, after the first five were Killer Diller, Land 
Rush, Mister Frisky, Thirty Six Red, Power Lunch, Real Cash, Dr. Bobby A., 
Pendleton Ridge, Burnt Hills and Fighting Fantasy. Country Day was scratched 
from the Derby on Friday after fracturing a bone in his right foreleg. 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled, the fifth betting choice, paid $23.60, $7.80 and $5.80. The other 
mutuels were $3.80 and $3.80 on Summer Squall and $12 for Pleasant Tap. 
Unbridled earned $581,000 of the $756,000 purse, running 1 1/4 miles in a 
creditable time of 2:02 on a drying-out track that was labeled as good. 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled, a big bay son of Fappiano and Gana Facil, is a Florida-bred who was 
bought by his owner, Frances Genter, for $70,000 at Tartan Farms' dispersal 
auction in 1987. Genter, 92, is a Minneapolis resident who has been in racing 
for 53 years. Before Saturday, she said that her biggest racing thrill was 
winning the 1951 Santa Anita Derby with Rough'n Tumble, a horse that cost 
$5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Nafzger, 48, a former rodeo bull rider who started training quarter horses 
in New Mexico in 1968 before moving to thoroughbreds a few years later, gave 
Perret few prerace instructions. 
</P>
<P>
"I only told Craig one thing," Nafzger said. "I wanted him to warm up the 
horse, to jog him. I wanted him to trot the horse a whole bunch." 
</P>
<P>
The jockey didn't have much to say to Nafzger, either. "If we just get that 
much run, I know we'll win this race." 
</P>
<P>
What Perret meant was shaking Unbridled loose in a large field. As it turned 
out, the colt's only problem was a squeeze between Fighting Fantasy and 
Pleasant Tap at the start. 
</P>
<P>
"After three jumps, we were fine," Perret said. 
</P>
<P>
Fighting Fantasy, who went off at 111-1, broke to the right, pushing Unbridled 
into Pleasant Tap. Fighting Fantasy made the lead in the run past the stands 
the first time, but dropped out of the race quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Real Cash held the lead going down the backstretch, with Mister Frisky and his 
jockey, Gary Stevens, running on his right flank. Thirty Six Red and Burnt 
Hills also were in contention then, with Summer Squall heading up the second 
tier of horses, about five lengths behind Real Cash. Unbridled was in sixth 
place, about eight lengths away from the front. 
</P>
<P>
On the far turn, Mister Frisky moved past Real Cash, but could hold the lead 
for only about 10 jumps. Summer Squall and Unbridled were rolling even faster. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't sure I could beat Pat at the five-sixteenths pole, but I knew then 
that it was just me and him," Perret said. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall moved past Mister Frisky, and Unbridled was accelerating right 
behind him. With a half-mile to go, Unbridled was following Land Rush, and 
Silver Ending was coming up on the outside. Perret was able to send Unbridled 
through the hole that those horses might have closed. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the key," Perret said. "The hole was there at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled, on the outside, pulled away from Summer Squall just inside the 
eighth pole, completing the trip and the victory with only a couple of 
right-handed whacks from Perret's whip. 
</P>
<P>
"At the quarter pole, I saw Pat whipping his horse, and I said to myself, "Pat, 
you're in trouble,' " Perret said. "From the middle of the backstretch, I knew 
we were in good shape. I had a golden trip. 
</P>
<P>
"Today was just my day at Churchill Downs. This horse gave me a winning race at 
the eighth pole. I saw the progress he was making (since the Blue Grass). I 
knew he was coming to the race in the right way." 
</P>
<P>
Day didn't get his usual strong finish from Summer Squall. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked over my shoulder just about the five-sixteenths pole and I saw 
Unbridled coming," Day said. "When I looked back at my horse, he had his ears 
straight up. I mean, we were on the lead at that point just turning into the 
stretch, and he threw his ears up and just lost total concentration. 
</P>
<P>
"When Unbridled came by me, my horse got back into it, but it wasn't the burst 
that I anticipated that he was capable of. He came on down there with a 
half-hearted run. I think that he was capable of a better finish than that. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't like he was a tired horse, but he wasn't exerting 100% of his effort 
at that point. My hat's off to the winner, but I think my colt could have made 
it a bit more of a horse race if he had just maintained his attention span. He 
just kind of lost his concentration momentarily at the head of the stretch and 
just never seemed to regain it." 
</P>
<P>
Perret rode Unbridled for the first time for a fifth-place finish in the 
Tropical Park Derby at Calder in January. Jose Velez had been riding Unbridled 
as a 2-year-old, but he broke his hip in a spill. 
</P>
<P>
In the Fountain of Youth at Gulfstream on March 3, Day rode Unbridled for the 
first time, because Perret was committed to Rhythm, the champion 2-year-old 
colt. Unbridled finished third and Rhythm, who eventually dropped out of the 
Kentucky Derby picture after throat surgery, was 10th. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, Unbridled's win in the Florida Derby was demeaned because of a 
slow time and the fact that it was only the third victory in nine starts for 
the colt. The Blue Grass, his next race, did nothing to swell Unbridled's 
reputation, except in the eyes of Nafzger and Perret. 
</P>
<P>
"They built a wall around Summer Squall and Mister Frisky (for the Kentucky 
Derby)," Perret said. "I guess if you win all 16 of your races, you're entitled 
to that, but I never felt this was a two-horse race. Quite a few horses in this 
race had a license to win." 
</P>
<P>
The overriding sentimental choice was Mister Frisky and trainer Laz Barrera, 
who had won the Derby with Bold Forbes in 1976 and the Triple Crown with 
Affirmed in 1978, before two heart surgeries and a dismissed California 
accusation that he had run a horse on cocaine in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Barrera schooled Mister Frisky so much at Churchill Downs -- in the paddock and 
in the starting gate -- that the colt might have been Phi Beta Kappa. Mister 
Frisky, heated up and unruly before the Santa Anita Derby, was a model horse in 
the paddock on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to blame the track, but the horse didn't handle it," Stevens said. 
"When we made the lead, I thought the race was ours. But when Summer Squall and 
Unbridled started coming, my horse bobbled for three or four strides. He was 
uncomfortable. He had done the same thing during a workout here, and I had said 
something about it. 
</P>
<P>
"After that, I asked him for his best, and it wasn't there. The last eighth of 
a mile, I was more concerned about the well-being of the horse. I just took 
care of him the rest of the way." 
</P>
<P>
Barrera said that Mister Frisky suffered a cut on his right front ankle, but it 
isn't serious. Stevens feels that Mister Frisky deserves another chance. 
</P>
<P>
"He pulled up all right, and if he's all right after this, I'd like to see him 
run in the Preakness," Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
The Preakness, the second leg in the Triple Crown, will be run at Pimlico on 
May 19. Unbridled will not be unappreciated when he runs in that one.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

SCOTT VS. GOODEN: HITTERS' DAY IN NEW YORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Baseball fans might look forward to pitching battles, but hitters generally 
regard them like a businessman does Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
But Saturday, when two of the National League's best pitchers, Mike Scott of 
Houston and Dwight Gooden of the Mets, opposed each other at New York, the 
hitters had a ball. 
</P>
<P>
There were 25 hits in the game won by the Astros, 9-5. When Gooden and Scott 
met last Sunday at Houston, the pitchers dominated, with the Astros winning in 
10 innings, 2-1, although neither starter figured in the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Although he gave up four home runs and all five runs in six innings, Scott, a 
20-game winner last season, staggered to his first victory of the season 
against two losses. He yielded home runs to Howard Johnson, Darryl Strawberry, 
Kevin McReynolds and Gregg Jefferies. 
</P>
<P>
Gooden gave up six runs and nine hits in 6 2/3 innings. His wild pitch allowed 
the go-ahead run to score in the seventh. His record fell to 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
"Nine out of 10 times you would get the duel," said Bill Doran of the Astros, 
who had four hits and drove in two runs. "Today was the exception and I can't 
say I'm disappointed. I was due to break out." 
</P>
<P>
Gooden led, 6-5, going into the seventh inning. With one out, Doran and Rafael 
Ramirez singled, then worked a double steal. Craig Biggio's infield out scored 
the tying run, and Gooden's wild pitch enabled the go-ahead run to score. The 
Astros had five steals. The Mets have thrown out only seven of 58 base stealers 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's two-run home run, his seventh of the season, and Strawberry's third 
homer gave Gooden a 3-0 lead in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 4, Montreal 1 -- In his second major-league start, rookie John 
Burkett, a 25-year-old right-hander, outpitched Dennis Martinez at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Burkett, who gave up six hits and a run in seven innings, improved his record 
to 2-0 when Robby Thompson hit a two-run homer over the center-field fence with 
two out in the eighth inning. Thompson began the game batting .214. 
</P>
<P>
"I got Thompson on a low changeup earlier," said Martinez (2-2). "But I got the 
one he hit up. It was not a good pitch. It was much too high. You can't make a 
mistake like that." 
</P>
<P>
Giant Manager Roger Craig is impressed by Burkett: "He pitched a great game. He 
changed his speeds well and he pitches better inside than any young pitcher 
I've seen. He knows how to pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 3-5, San Diego 2-6 -- One game belonged to the Cubs' Shawon Dunston and 
the other to San Diego's Mark Parent. 
</P>
<P>
In the opener in Chicago, Dunston hit a two-run homer with two out in the 
bottom of the ninth inning to give the Cubs a dramatic victory. 
</P>
<P>
Parent was the hitting star in the second game. The Padres' backup catcher is a 
lifetime .181 hitter. Last season, in 141 at-bats, he drove in 21 runs. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, he singled in two runs in the second inning and doubled home two more 
in the fourth. A baserunning mistake by Jack Clark, who left third base too 
soon, prevented Parent from getting another RBI on a fly-ball out in the fifth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
Dunston has five home runs in 23 games. He hit only nine last season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time I ever did that," Dunston said. "Give some credit to 
(Manager) Don Zimmer. I hit a couple out in batting practice on our recent 
trip. He suggested (I) unload once in a while." 
</P>
<P>
Parent was excited about his performance. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit a breaking ball the first time," said Parent, who doesn't play much 
because of the durability of Benito Santiago. "The second time I was looking 
for a fastball and got it." 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 4, St. Louis 2 -- The top of the Reds' batting order is back to 
getting hits in bunches. Chris Sabo and Mariano Duncan, the first two hitters, 
had six hits at St. Louis and the Reds handed Joe Magrane his fifth loss in a 
row this season. 
</P>
<P>
Magrane, who was 18-7 with more than a month left in the 1989 season, has 
failed to win his last 12 starts and is 0-7 since last Aug. 29. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Larkin, who bats third, had two hits and drove in three runs as the Reds 
improved their record to 16-5. 
</P>
<P>
Duncan leads the league with a .406 average, while Sabo is fourth at .365. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Rijo had the Cardinals shut out until he faltered in the seventh. Bullpen 
aces Rob Dibble and Randy Myers finished up, with Myers getting his sixth save. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals loaded the bases with one out in both the fourth and fifth 
innings, but couldn't score. DAN HAFNER

INDIAN LEGEND COULD ENDS BEFORE IT GETS STARTED

LODGE GRASS, Mont. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Elvis Old Bull is a legend in Montana basketball circles. By next year, he 
might be just a memory. 
</P>
<P>
Old Bull, a high school senior on the Crow Indian Reservation in southeastern 
Montana, scored 1,948 points in four seasons, averaging almost 20 points a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"In my 13 years of coaching, there's been nobody better than Elvis, anywhere," 
Lodge Grass basketball coach Gordon Real Bird said. "He's the best." 
</P>
<P>
Old Bull holds 16 school records and led Lodge Grass to three consecutive Class 
B titles. He was named the tournament's most valuable player each time. 
</P>
<P>
But his teachers say too many missed classes threaten Old Bull's graduation. 
Real Bird says he hopes Old Bull might attend college -- but it doesn't look 
promising. 
</P>
<P>
And another Indian legend may stop at the high school level. 
</P>
<P>
Edgar Pretty On Top played in Old Bull's shadow on the reservation, averaging 
12 points a game. But Pretty On Top also has a 3.8 grade-point average in the 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to study psychology," said Pretty On Top, who like Old Bull has a 
traditional Crow name. "I want to set a good example -- by doing good in 
classes and playing ball." 
</P>
<P>
He's been accepted by Western Montana College in Dillon and is eligible for an 
academic scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not much here for me on the reservation," Pretty On Top said. "You 
have to go out and just do it for yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Indian basketball is an enigma. It often dominates Montana prep basketball; 
this season, Indian teams won two of four state class titles. 
</P>
<P>
But its star players seldom use the game as a route to an education and a 
brighter future. 
</P>
<P>
Once the glory days of high school end, the players fade away, most never to be 
heard from again. A few try college for a time, only to wind up back on the 
reservation. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Takes Enemy, a 1984 Hardin High School graduate, was recruited by 
virtually every college in Montana. He attended Sheridan Community College in 
Wyoming, but dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Yarlott, a 1984 Lodge Grass graduate, went on to the College of Great Falls 
and later to Miles Community College before dropping out. 
</P>
<P>
They are the rules rather than the exceptions, and coaches and community 
leaders on and off the reservation admit frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"We've isolated the Indian with reservations," Lodge Grass athletic director 
Rocky Eggart said. "Once you're in one, it's tough to get out." 
</P>
<P>
The problems of the reservation are well-documented -- poverty, unemployment, 
alcoholism, drug abuse, teen pregnancy. Still, similar hardships are found in 
urban inner cities, and players there try to use basketball as a way out. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids in the ghetto, they have a tremendous desire to leave," Eastern 
Montana basketball coach Ernie Wheeler said. "But the Indian kids seem to be 
drawn back to the reservation. In my three years here, not one has made it 
(out)." 
</P>
<P>
"When we signed Kwesi Coleman from Detroit Cass Tech, it was a situation where 
a city kid was anxious to get out," Montana State coach Mick Durham said. 
"Sometimes you think the Indian kids would be like that, too." 
</P>
<P>
The last Indian to play at Montana State on a scholarship was Gil Birdinground 
in 1974, Durham said. 
</P>
<P>
Several Indian players from the high school class of 1990 say they will try to 
change things. 
</P>
<P>
"You have some of your Indian ballplayers who have great high school years, but 
after that some have screwed it up for the rest of us," said Steven Falls Down, 
a Crow at Billings Central High School who earned a full athletic scholarship 
to Rocky Mountain College in Billings. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the last name, so I knew I would have to be two times better than the 
next guy," Falls Down said. "... There's always going to be people out there 
who want to see you fall flat on your face. But I want to prove them wrong. I 
want the kids to look up to me." 
</P>
<P>
Junior Real Bird, the son of the coach, says he wants to become a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking at Dawson Community College (in Glendive)," Real Bird said. "I 
want to go on to school and do it for myself." 
</P>
<P>
What sets Falls Down, Pretty On Top and Real Bird apart from the others are 
their family backgrounds. All three have relatives who graduated from college. 
Old Bull lacks that background, the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
Old Bull had agreed to an interview about his plans and the problems faced by 
Indian players, but didn't keep an appointment with a reporter and subsequently 
did not return messages left at his home and school. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Real Bird said he fears the example set for reservation youngsters if Old 
Bull does not go on to college. 
</P>
<P>
"They all look up to Elvis," Real Bird said. "He's a hero. I told him to go to 
college and do what he does best, then these kids will follow him. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope Elvis makes it."

EVIDENCE MOUNTS THAT ABBREVIATED SPRING AFFECTED PITCHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It will never be known for certain to what extent the insult that was the 
owners' 32-day spring training lockout contributed to the injuries suffered by 
Dodger pitcher Orel Hershiser and others. 
</P>
<P>
The one conclusive fact -- now that the rosters have been reduced and the 
equivalent of a normal six- to seven-week training period has elapsed since 
most camps opened -- is that the abbreviated spring had a major and anticipated 
impact on pitching. 
</P>
<P>
"It threw the balance of the game off-kilter," Fred Claire, the Dodgers' 
executive vice president, said of the three-week training period. "I never want 
to go back to it." 
</P>
<P>
Claire will deliver that message to baseball administrator Bill Murray, who has 
begun polling the 26 clubs regarding ramifications of the shorter spring. 
</P>
<P>
It was once thought that the owners might make the lockout a springboard to 
permanently reducing the training period, but that seems unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Looming over the statistical data that documents the shorter stints by starting 
pitchers and the use of more pitchers per game, there's the shadow of 
Hershiser. 
</P>
<P>
"Pitchers need at least a month," General Manager Lee Thomas of the 
Philadelphia Phillies said in advocating a return to the normal training cycle. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything less is inviting trouble. I mean, it's a shame what happened to Orel, 
and he's not the only pitcher to go down. 
</P>
<P>
"We would not be doing justice to the game and fans (by shortening spring 
training)." 
</P>
<P>
What happened to Hershiser, according to Dr. Frank Jobe, is that the wear and 
tear of 195 consecutive starts devastated his shoulder. One pitch didn't do it. 
A full spring training probably would not have prevented it. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser has acknowledged, however, that he didn't feel as if he had time to 
back off and consider an alternative treatment program under the pressure of 
getting ready in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
He also did no conditioning on his own, choosing to participate in the 
bargaining negotiations and support the union recommendation that players 
resist working out as a team during the lockout, increasing pressure on the 
owners to get it resolved, a theory as ill-conceived as the lockout itself. 
</P>
<P>
The blame, assuming blame is appropriate, can be easily spread, though Claire 
said he believes some injuries are being misread and have no connection to the 
shorter spring. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there is no clear link in most cases, and the reality is that there 
have been fewer injuries than normal. 
</P>
<P>
There were 95 players on the May 1 disabled lists last year and only 72 this 
year -- a significant drop not easily explained. 
</P>
<P>
There also were fewer errors through the same span of 246 games: 370 this year 
compared to 414 last year. In other words, fundamentals did not seem to suffer 
because of the shorter spring. 
</P>
<P>
As for hitting and run production, the changes were minimal. 
</P>
<P>
The American League's cumulative batting average through 246 games rose from 
.255 in 1989 to .256 in 1990, the National League's from .243 to .253. 
</P>
<P>
An average of 8.3 runs a game were scored through 246 games this year compared 
to 8.02 last year. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of the shorter spring is most visible in statistics dealing with 
pitcher stamina: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A total of 1,394 worked in the first 246 games of 1989, an average of 5.6 a 
game. The total climbed to 1,536 in the first 246 games of 1990, an average of 
6.2. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Starting pitchers in 1989 averaged 6 1/3 innings a start and completed 40 
of those first 246 games. The starting pitchers in 1990 averaged only 5 1/3 
innings, and completed only 15 of the 246 games. 
</P>
<P>
If pitching is the name of the game, baseball was operating under something of 
an alias during the first month of the season, despite sensational performances 
such as the Mark Langston-Mike Witt no-hitter for the Angels, the near-perfect 
game by the Seattle Mariners' Brian Holman and Nolan Ryan's 16-strikeout 
one-hitter for the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
A lack of endurance in many cases resulted, as Claire noted, in the balance 
being thrown off-kilter, though everyone had to deal with that same loss of 
equilibrium. 
</P>
<P>
"Pitchers need five or six weeks to get ready, and hitters do, too," Claire 
said. "It's that simple. The hitters may not need it as far as conditioning 
(goes), but they certainly need it for sharpness and timing. 
</P>
<P>
"It just seems like we were in a race to get ready, that the pace was faster 
than it should be when preparing a club for a 162-game season. And the other 
thing that doesn't get mentioned much is that I missed seeing our young players 
in competition against major league talent. We didn't have time for that." 
</P>
<P>
In the broad picture, the injury risk is an overriding concern. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of Hershiser obviously weighs on Claire, as does the absence of third 
baseman Jeff Hamilton, who tried to throw too hard, too soon and is out 
indefinitely after shoulder surgery Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always tried to be extremely careful and cautious (in) conditioning our 
players," Claire said. "Yet all of us recognize that there was a timetable 
there this spring that's unnecessary, that we just don't need again. It would 
be a major mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, it's never before been clearer to me that five or six weeks is the 
proper framework." 
</P>
<P>
Two lockout stories: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jack Armstrong is a 25-year-old right-hander who was 6-10 with a 5.33 
earned-run average in parts of two seasons with the Cincinnati Reds and thought 
he faced a make-or-break situation this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated by the lockout and with only $200 in the bank, Armstrong took out a 
$5,000 loan, left his wife and two-month-old son at home in Neptune, N.J., and 
traveled to Florida, where he drove from one high school field to another, 
looking for a batterymate. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd go through one catcher, then go looking for another," he said. "I had $100 
when the lockout ended, but my arm was ready. I've never been stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong credits that preparation for his 5-0 record as the emerging ace of 
the Reds' staff. 
</P>
<P>
 -- After missing the entire 1989 season because of back surgery, Dave 
Winfield, 38, apparently needed more than three weeks to prepare for his 
return. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield was nine for 49, and hitless in his last 22 at-bats, as he arrived in 
Anaheim with the New York Yankees Friday, unhappily having been reduced to 
sharing left field with Claudell Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that given a normal amount of time, I can be one of the most productive 
outfielders in the league (for) putting numbers up," Winfield said. "I'm not a 
platoon player. I don't think they would have done this with Don Mattingly if 
he went into a two-week slump." 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees' record of 7-13, going into the weekend series, represented their 
worst start in 18 years. They had scored more than one run in only four of 
their last 86 innings, the offense -- last in the league in runs and ninth in 
home runs -- a pale imitation of a proud tradition. 
</P>
<P>
And what might the lineup card have looked like if Rickey Henderson and Jack 
Clark were still teammates of Winfield, Mattingly and Steve Sax? 
</P>
<P>
But Clark was traded to San Diego after the 1988 season for pitchers Jimmy 
Jones and Lance McCullers and outfielder Stan Jefferson, and Henderson went to 
Oakland eight months later for pitchers Eric Plunk and Greg Cadaret and 
outfielder Luis Polonia. 
</P>
<P>
Only McCullers, Plunk and Cadaret are still with the Yankees, and each is 
employed in middle relief. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not taking anything away from the guys they got, but when you trade two of 
the best players in the game, you have to get a top player in return," 
Henderson said in New York the other day. "You don't get guys who are still 
trying to prove themselves. What the Yankees got was absolutely nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Since the second of the trades, the Yankees were 49-64 before Saturday night's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"They ruined that team," Henderson said. "They had a lot of good players they 
could have built around for a few years. But they're always switching so much. 
They just don't give anything a chance." 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Braves experienced their 16th consecutive losing month in April, 
but the vaunted young pitching staff seems to have found itself, producing a 
five-game winning streak and a streak of 11 games in which the starting pitcher 
went seven innings or more. 
</P>
<P>
Whether it can save Russ Nixon's job as manager is unclear. Nixon apparently 
did not help himself with his handling of the Nick Esasky situation. 
</P>
<P>
Esasky, signed as a $5.6-million free agent during the winter, is on the 
disabled list with a vertigo condition that doctors believe stems from a virus, 
though they have not been able to isolate it. 
</P>
<P>
Esasky told Atlanta reporters that he sees a halo around the ball and can't 
focus on a moving object. He said that when he told Nixon about it, the manager 
asked him to stay in the lineup for a few more days, a period during which 
Esasky, unable to see the ball clearly, dived for a pop-up and injured his 
shoulder, complicating his recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Dawson enjoyed a spectacular West Coast swing with the Chicago Cubs, 
going 14 for 32 in eight games, with three home runs and 10 runs batted in. The 
performance eased some of the concern regarding Dawson's tender knees. Although 
he did not play in the field even once during the spring, after having winter 
surgery, Dawson said he is still experiencing late-game stiffness. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, pitcher Rick Sutcliffe will have exploratory surgery Monday for the 
shoulder ailment that hindered him during the second half of last season and 
put him on the disabled list at the start of this season. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran pitcher Bill Long, recently acquired by the Cubs, said he has always 
wanted to play for Manager Don Zimmer. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
"That enthusiasm, that face," Long said. 
</P>
<P>
Voters in Cleveland will cast their ballots Tuesday on financing a new downtown 
stadium. Commissioner Fay Vincent, doing a little lobbying, said eight to 10 
cities are waiting for a team and the Indians might meet the criteria for 
moving if a new stadium is rejected. 
</P>
<P>
The National League, meanwhile, said this week it will not announce expansion 
plans until 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Although only a rookie, Gary Sheffield criticized Milwaukee pitchers last year 
for failing to protect their hitters. It's a new year, and the Brewers have 
been in three fights already, with reliever Chuck Crim having been ejected 
twice for hitting batters. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not proud of being involved in those things, but we do have team pride," 
said Manager Tom Trebelhorn, who also has reason to be proud of his starting 
pitchers, who were 10-0 through Friday.

KERSEY IS BLAZING HOT, 107-94;

<P>
NBA PLAYOFFS: SPURS' ROBINSON HELD TO NINE POINTS ON THREE-OF-11 SHOOTING.

<P>
Jerome Kersey has been promised a raise after this season. The way he's 
playing, it's going to be a big one. 
</P>
<P>
The Portland forward scored 25 points and grabbed a playoff career-high 16 
rebounds Saturday as the Trail Blazers opened the Western Conference semifinals 
with a 107-94 victory over the San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
"I've really got confidence now," Kersey said. "My outside shot is going down 
and that's really opening things up for me. It feels good." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's big game followed Kersey's playoff career-best 29-point effort at 
Dallas Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been playing well the last couple of months of the season, but the last 
two games he's just shot so well," Portland Coach Rick Adelman said. "He knocks 
down so many open jumpers, and that really helps when he's able to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Clyde Drexler added 23 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Portland fell behind by eight points early in the third quarter, rallied to 
edge ahead at the end of the period, then pulled away at the finish with a 15-1 
spurt in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Portland played without starting center Kevin Duckworth, who suffered a broken 
right hand Tuesday night. But the Blazers still held David Robinson to nine 
points on three-of-11 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, guarded much of the game by rookie Cliff Robinson, missed his first 
eight shots and attempted only one in the second half. It was only the second 
time this season that the San Antonio center didn't score in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't play my own game," David Robinson said. "Usually I rebound a lot 
better and position myself a lot better, but I wasn't into it."

JUST WHEN DOES A SLUMP BECOME A WAY OF LIFE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LITTWIN, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some things the slumping Cal Ripken definitely does not need: 
</P>
<P>
More milk. 
</P>
<P>
Another new batting stance. 
</P>
<P>
Cab money. 
</P>
<P>
A day off. 
</P>
<P>
He probably doesn't think he needs any advice, either, although your typical 
talk-show caller might disagree. Of course, your typical talk-show caller not 
only thinks he can solve Ripken's batting problems, but also has some advice 
for NASA on the telescope-cable snafu. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know if Ripken needs advice. Frank Robinson thought a little sit-down 
might help, so manager and star talked for 20 minutes Tuesday afternoon behind 
a closed door, after which the manager pronounced it a good meeting and the 
star didn't say anything at all. Cal Ripken does not like to talk about hitting 
-- or meetings about hitting -- when he isn't doing much of it. That must be 
why he hid in the players' room, with his sumptuous postgame meal of ham and 
potatoes, for at least 45 minutes after Tuesday night's game. Bon appetit. 
</P>
<P>
What is wrong with Ripken? The only one around Memorial Stadium in a bigger 
slump is Wee Willie in the crab race (the worst nightly stadium event, by the 
way, since John Denver used to sing "Thank God I'm a Country Boy"). There are 
many theories, no answers. Robinson likes to trot out the one about the star 
trying to take too much of the load for a slumping team. In other words, he 
isn't relaxed enough. 
</P>
<P>
Another theory is that, with a slumping Mickey Tettleton batting behind him 
most nights, Ripken doesn't get any good pitches to hit. In other words, he 
isn't patient enough. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular theory involves the business of the streak, a monster now out 
of control. Ripken has to play every day, tired or not, focused or not, awake 
or not. How can he quit? The streak, now at 1,271 games, defines him. It also 
has nothing to do with his batting average. Come on, it's the second day of 
May. If a player is tired this time of the season, he'd have to check into a 
rest home by August. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose, whom you may remember, had two long consecutive-game streaks. And he 
didn't just play baseball. Rose went to the track during the day, chased women 
at night and ran to first on walks during the games. And he still managed to 
hit .300 every year. 
</P>
<P>
The problem isn't that Ripken plays too often. The problem is that he isn't 
hitting safely often enough, a condition many players, particularly on the 
Orioles, share. The Orioles are hitting .185 on this home stand. Ripken is 
hitting .184. Is the whole team tired? 
</P>
<P>
This is not a new circumstance, either. Ripken's numbers have steadily declined 
since 1983, his MVP season, when he set a standard he has never been able to 
match. And since mid-season of last year, in what was a magical year for 
everyone else, Ripken has been, well, ordinary. People start talking about what 
a great defensive player he is when they want to say something nice about him. 
</P>
<P>
In his last three seasons, he has hit .252, .264 and .257, respectively. He 
hasn't hit .300 since 1984, and he hasn't driven in 100 runs since 1985. Since 
July of last season, he is hitting .233. When does a slump translate into a way 
of life? 
</P>
<P>
But let's take the worst-case scenario. Let's say the kind of year he had last 
season is all you can expect from him anymore. He drove in 93 runs last year. 
He hit more than 20 homers for the eighth consecutive season last year. He 
played the shortstop of his life last year. Even during his worst slump, the 
one of last September, Ripken still led the team in RBI with 15. A Cal Ripken 
who doesn't live up to expectations is still the Orioles' best player. 
</P>
<P>
But he isn't all the Orioles have. He can't be, or the Orioles are in even 
worse shape than they appear to be right now. 
</P>
<P>
"This is no longer just a Cal Ripken team," hitting coach Tom McCraw was saying 
Tuesday night. "Last year, you could see how Cal might think that way. (Randy) 
Milligan and (Craig) Worthington and (Mike) Devereaux were untested. Now, we 
know Worthington can drive in runs. We know Milligan can hit. It's up to those 
guys, and to Mickey (Tettleton) to do their share, too. It's not just Cal." 
</P>
<P>
It's not just Cal. A year ago, as September began and the pennant race heated 
up, Robinson talked about looking to Ripken as the player who had to lead them. 
He hit .198. Maybe he tried too hard. That's easy to believe with Ripken, who, 
you know, tries as hard as anyone in baseball. Whatever his problems, they have 
nothing to do with lack of effort. He's the original extra-batting-practice guy 
who, when he's finished, takes a couple hundred ground balls. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, he walked twice (he was patient). Breaking an 0-for-12 streak, 
he hit a single to right (he used the whole field). And he popped weakly to 
first (his seventh weak pop to first in the past eight games). 
</P>
<P>
The meeting didn't seem to do much, but Frank Robinson never suggested it would 
have immediate results. Robinson talked to Mickey Tettleton two weeks ago, and 
Tettleton, before an impacted wisdom tooth removed him from the lineup, is one 
for his last 16 with eight strikeouts in his last 12 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, the Orioles' slump will end. "We have one every year," Robinson says. 
"People forget every year how bad it was." Ripken's slump will end, too. The 
question on Ripken, and on the team, is how good they will be when they do 
start hitting. Will the Orioles be good enough? And will Ripken, who is only 
30, ever approximate what he once was?

PINIELLA ENJOYING HIS FREEDOM TO RUN THE REDS

<TEXT>
<P>
It is three hours before game time and Red outfielder Paul O'Neill, already in 
full uniform with his glove on his right hand, marches to the office of Lou 
Piniella. He does not enter. He stops at the doorway, crosses his arms on his 
chest, tilts his head and doesn't say a word. Piniella knows why he is here. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just giving you a day off, that's all," Piniella says. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't need a day off," O'Neill counters. "We've got one tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
"I just want you to relax, get your head together," Piniella says. "Don't 
worry, you're not platooning." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill hangs his head and leaves. 
</P>
<P>
He is obviously displeased with the night's lineup. But this much he can be 
sure of: It is Piniella's lineup all the way, just as it is his clubhouse and 
it is his team. It is the first time Piniella can make that claim, though he 
managed 417 games before he signed a three-year contract Nov. 3 to manage the 
Reds. Of course, all of those other games occurred while he was under the 
employ of George Steinbrenner, the Yankees owner whom Dallas Green came to call 
"Manager George." 
</P>
<P>
Only now is Piniella finding out what it is like to be a big-league manager. 
What he did before was work for Steinbrenner. The difference is the same as 
sitting on your father's lap as a boy in the driver's seat of a car, your hands 
clutching the steering wheel -- "Look, you're driving!" -- and actually 
operating an automobile for the first time and marveling at the power and 
freedom at your disposal. 
</P>
<P>
Piniella has his first set of wheels. Sporty, fast and shiny red. So far, it is 
the best thing going on the National League streets. 
</P>
<P>
"The one major difference," Piniella said, "is over here I make the decisions 
and they stand. I control the lineup and I control the clubhouse situation. 
That's paramount for a manager. There hasn't been any interference. 
</P>
<P>
"I write out the lineup card I want. If people need rest, I rest them. I didn't 
have that luxury in New York. You have to win right now, today, every day over 
there. It's important for the players to understand the manager is in control 
of the situation. And we might send some people out from time to time, but we 
won't have a minor-league shuttle just for the sake of a shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
"George is tough. He's a good friend. I liked him. I just didn't like managing 
for him. I was physically and mentally tired. 
</P>
<P>
"George is mean. George's demands are unrealistic at times. But I learned a lot 
there. I'll tell you, no managing job is easy. But is this one easier? Yes. 
</P>
<P>
"See, the big thing over there is that as a manager you lose control. Everybody 
who goes there thinks it's going to be different. I did. But invariably, you 
come to realize that so many things are out of your control. It really becomes 
disillusioning." 
</P>
<P>
Piniella fires up another cigarette and begins pulling on his Reds uniform. His 
wardrobe no longer includes pinstripes, which for recent Yankee managers have 
become associated more with imprisonment than tradition. 
</P>
<P>
He won't say whether his freedom will make him a better manager. "Time will 
tell," he said. But clearly, he is a happier one. 
</P>
<P>
"I think so," said his wife, Anita. "He's happy because he really has full 
control over what he wants to do. He's in control. That's what a manager should 
feel. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I don't think he ever would have forgiven himself if he hadn't tried 
this. He had a good job (broadcasting and advising) with the Yankees and had a 
guaranteed contract and we have a home in New Jersey. We knew how much 
difficulty this would create in our lives. But I think he wanted this one 
chance to be in control, to see how he does. I'd be so happy if he would just 
go out and win it all and that would be enough." 
</P>
<P>
Piniella has jumped headlong into his new job, not bothering to stick a couple 
of toes in first to check the water. As shortstop Barry Larkin said, "Lou 
Piniella has made a tremendous difference here. Ever since day one of spring 
training, it's been his team. He calls the shots." 
</P>
<P>
When the Reds played poorly in the second game of spring training -- that was 
just one week into camp -- Piniella ordered the club to run in the outfield 
while he fumed near the foul line. 
</P>
<P>
"Relax, skip," coach Sam Perlozzo told him. "It's only the second game." 
</P>
<P>
Piniella shot back, "Damn it, these guys have been here a whole . . . week." 
</P>
<P>
"Then," Perlozzo recalled, "he realized what he'd just said and just started 
laughing. But it just goes to show you what he demands from his players." The 
Cincinnati players have welcomed his intensity. They were a sorry lot last 
season, watching their season fall apart under the weight of numerous injuries 
and the troubles of their manager, Pete Rose. A first-place team on June 10, 
they went 40-53 thereafter to finish 75-87 and in fifth place. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out that Rose was more of an albatross than a manager. He spent much 
of his time defending himself while the national media rummaged through his 
life, hunting for clues to his gambling habits and his choice of friends. Rose 
often took sanctuary behind the closed door of his office. 
</P>
<P>
After that act, the Reds were all the more eager to welcome Piniella, a 
complete newcomer to Cincinnati and the league. They don't even like to talk 
about Rose now. The only clubhouse reminder of Rose is an engraved silver 
tankard on Piniella's desk that Rose received for being named a Sports 
Illustrated player of the week in 1984. It is used as a pencil cup. 
</P>
<P>
"Lou's in the game all the time," outfielder Eric Davis said. "He talks to us 
constantly. The major difference is he prepares us to play. We go over the 
other team's hitters all the time, things like that. He keeps us focused 
instead of just writing out the lineup card." 
</P>
<P>
Said reliever Rob Dibble: "Lou's fantastic. He sets up everybody's role. 
Everybody knows their job. He gave me a day off the other day. Last year, I'd 
have to ask for one -- and even then I might not get it. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of people coming out to see the Big Red Machine and Pete Rose and his 
coaches, they're coming to watch us play. People are coming to watch the 
Cincinnati Reds, a team out there on the field, not the Big Red Machine sitting 
on the bench. That was like a circus atmosphere. It was a sideshow. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got our own identity for a change. We know it and other teams know it." 
</P>
<P>
Piniella, out of the Yankees organization for the first time in 17 years, is 
searching for his own identity, too. With the Yankees, he was criticized for 
mishandling his pitching. But as Piniella said, "I didn't have pitching." Now 
he does, even if starters Danny Jackson and Jose Rijo still are struggling to 
overcome injuries. And so far, he has found the right balance of work for his 
talented relievers. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, this is a different team than the Yankees and Piniella is a different 
manager. The Reds lead the league in hitting, are second in stolen bases and 
third in sacrifice bunts. And Piniella, who sometimes saw his manager's office 
in New York as a bunker, is a hands-on manager here, whether it be helping 
Chris Sabo rediscover his power or just keeping the clubhouse loose, though 
this bunch of guys doesn't need much help with that. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen the need to communicate more," Piniella said. "The way things go in 
New York you can get in a foul mood sometimes. You withdraw a little. That's a 
mistake. The players have to know who the boss is. At the same time, you want 
to create a good, healthy atmosphere in the clubhouse." 
</P>
<P>
The problem in New York was that Piniella's players knew exactly who the boss 
was. And it wasn't the manager. Steinbrenner often hounded Piniella through the 
red desk telephone in the Yankee manager's office. The same model telephone 
sits on Piniella's desk in Cincinnati. Right there, all similarities end 
between Piniella's former and current jobs. "This phone," Piniella said with a 
smile, "doesn't light up."

400 IN FIELD FOR STATE AMATEUR QUALIFYING MAY 15-16 IN CHINO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The road to Pebble Beach for the 79th California Amateur Championship will go 
through Los Serranos Country Club in Chino -- as it has for the past 20 years 
-- for golfers from Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
A record 517 low-handicap golfers filed entries for the tournament from the 
southern half of the state, a number that the Southern California Golf Assn. 
had to pare to 400 to accommodate the two Los Serranos courses where qualifying 
will be held May 15-16. 
</P>
<P>
On the first day, half the field will play the 7,110-yard, par-74 South Course, 
and the other 200 will play the 6,200-yard, par-71 North Course. 
</P>
<P>
The fields will be cut to the low 50 and ties for the second round, with the 
players switching courses. After 36 holes, the low 43 will receive invitations 
to play June 25 at Cypress Point in the first round of the State Amateur. 
Actually, there will be 50 from Southern California, but there are seven 
exemptions. Another 50 from Northern California will complete the field. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Stankowski, the Southern California Amateur champion from Oxnard, heads 
the list of players who have exemptions. Others are Dave Stockton Jr. of 
Mentone, runner-up in last year's State Amateur; Mark Johnson of Barstow, the 
SCGA Mid-Amateur champion, and the others who reached the quarterfinals last 
year -- Jack Spradlin Jr. of San Diego, Pat Duncan of Rancho Santa Fe and Craig 
Steinberg of Van Nuys. Another spot will be held open for the NCAA champion, in 
case he is from Southern California, as was Phil Mickelson of La Jolla last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Pastore, the SCGA senior champion from San Diego, also had an exemption but 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion is Casey Boyns of Pacific Grove, a caddy at Pebble Beach, 
who defeated Stockton, a USC student and son of former two-time PGA champion 
Dave Stockton, 3 and 1. The elder Stockton was recently named captain of the 
United States Ryder Cup team, which will meet a European team next year at 
Kiawah Island, S.C.

Players will find a number of minor changes on the North Course at Los 
Serranos, which is owned by former tennis star Jack Kramer. One they won't 
find, however, is that No. 9 has been changed from a 217-yard par-3 to a 
345-yard par-4. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the SCGA ruled Friday that qualifying rounds would be played with 
the old hole, reasoning that the change would confuse players who had practiced 
under the par-3, par-71 format. 
</P>
<P>
"No. 9 was a monster, especially when the wind was blowing," said Kevin 
Sullivan, manager of the Los Serranos Golf Club courses. "It was a backbreaker 
that hardly anyone reached. Now, it is a much fairer hole and will give the 
course a par-72 rating. It isn't long, but it has a two-level green and is well 
protected by three traps around the green and three more on the fairway." 
</P>
<P>
The State Amateur will conclude on June 29 with a 36-hole championship final at 
Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The American Golf Club, a 50,000-member organization that is based in Santa 
Monica and has the largest membership of any golf club in the country, is 
planning its own national scrambles team championship. 
</P>
<P>
Qualifying tournaments will be held at the more than 100 courses operated by 
American Golf Corp. Included are Long Beach's five municipal courses, Brookside 
in Pasadena, Camarillo Springs, Fullerton, Oceanside, Rancho San Joaquin in 
Irvine, Vista Valencia and Los Angeles County courses at La Mirada, Los Verdes 
and Mountain Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
American Golf is also negotiating to take over operation of the Knollwood 
county course in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Once the four-player teams are established, 13 regional tournaments will be 
held around the country. Southern Californians will play at Brookside, 
Oceanside or El Dorado in Long Beach. The finals will be Nov. 17-19 at the 
Painted Desert course in Las Vegas. Two teams will qualify from each regional 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Players need not be American Golf Club members to participate in the event. 
Entry fees are $30 for members, $40 for non-members.

Gilligan's Island, died of cancer, and receipts will go toward cancer research, 
according to Tom Barber, Griffith Park professional and tournament chairman. 
For $15, players will get nine holes of scrambles golf, a clinic and a chance 
to reminisce about their old pal.

British soccer fans clashed with police and one another in several cities on 
the closing day of soccer season, leaving dozens injured and more than 80 
people arrested, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The worst violence was in the south coast resort town of Bournemouth, where 
hometown fans clashed Friday night and Saturday with police and visiting fans 
from Leeds. 
</P>
<P>
At least 50 people were arrested and charged with assault, criminal damage or 
public order offenses, police said early today. At least 20 people, including 
six police officers, were hurt, police said. 
</P>
<P>
In the hours before Saturday's game, 2,000 fans -- many without tickets or with 
forged tickets -- began showering police with rocks, bricks and bottles and 
threatening Bournemouth players. Police brought in reinforcements from as far 
away as London, 95 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble began the night before the match, when about 100 soccer fans set 
fire to Bournemouth's famous pier and smashed windows at a posh shopping 
arcade. About 300 others attacked workers and customers at a seaside pub and 
tore apart furniture, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
At Chesterfield, just south of Sheffield, 12 people were taken to the hospital 
and others were treated at the stadium after clashes between rival fans and 
police. None of the injuries was said to be serious, but there were 30 arrests.

Soviet amateur Viatcheslav Bobrik broke away from the pack in the Virginia 
countryside, then used a powerful late attack Saturday to take the overall lead 
after four stages of the Tour de Trump bicycle race. 
</P>
<P>
Bobrik, 19, broke from a trio of riders on the second three-mile city street 
circuit before claiming the 87.7-mile Fredericksburg to Richmond Road Race 
third stage in 3 hours 50 minutes 11 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
A few hours later, Bobrik's seven-rider squad finished fifth in the 39.3-mile 
Richmond Team Time Trial in 1:16:48. 
</P>
<P>
"The leader's jersey is an enormous responsibility, and it's a heavy shirt," 
said Bobrik, who holds a 1-minute 19-second lead over third-place road race 
finisher Thierry Bock of Belgium. Previous leader Olaf Ludwig of East Germany 
is third, 2:58 behind. 
</P>
<P>
Mike McCarthy of New York, a member of the U.S. national amateur team, finished 
second in the road race in 3:50:42. Bock was third in 3:50:57. 
</P>
<P>
Bobrik, McCarthy and Bock broke away from the field of 131 riders 25 miles into 
the trek through central Virginia, building nearly a 15-minute margin. 
</P>
<P>
When the lead cyclists arrived in Richmond, Bobrik made his move. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-Eleven team from the United States won the fourth stage with a 52-second 
victory over the Netherlands' PDM in 1:15:10. 
</P>
<P>
Two-time Tour de France winner Greg LeMond finished 60th in the road race and 
guided his Z-Kickers squad to a fourth-place finish in the team time trial. He 
is 49th, trailing Bobrik by 3:32. 
</P>
<P>
Greg McNeil of Ojai crashed in the final lap of the road course and suffered a 
broken collarbone.

SEAHAWKS WON'T BET AGAINST THE SPREAD

<P>
A year ago, Jeff Chadwick and James Jones were elder statesmen in a Detroit 
Lions offense about to undergo a change. 
</P>
<P>
Mouse Davis spent the spring implementing the Run-and-Shoot into a Detroit 
offense that had been known as the Duck-and-Sack. At first, Chadwick and Jones 
were excited. Chadwick was a 6-foot-3 receiver with speed. Jones carried the 
ball and the franchise's offense on his broad shoulders through the Lions' 
worst years. 
</P>
<P>
"I was excited about the Run-and-Shoot," Jones said. "I loved it. You know 
you're the back and you know you're going to get the running room." 
</P>
<P>
Little did they know that with the Run-and-Shoot came their own walking papers. 
The new offense cleaned out Chadwick and three other returning receivers, a 
starting tight end, two of the top three quarterbacks and all the running 
backs, including Jones, who was traded to the Seattle Seahawks for cornerback 
Terry Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
And just when Chadwick and Jones thought they found peace and contentment in 
the Ground Chuck offense, Coach Chuck Knox switches to the Run-and-Shoot. 
</P>
<P>
"They are only doing a portion of it," Chadwick said. "It's just a little 
package that we're putting in. It is one of the things that helps to get the 
ball to different people." 
</P>
<P>
Judging from the practice Thursday, Knox's so-called Spread offense showed more 
run than shoot. Four receivers spread the field, but quarterbacks spent half 
the time handing off to a lone setback. 
</P>
<P>
The '90s might have spurred the development of Air Knox, but there's still a 
lot of Ground Chuck bringing things down to earth. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some pass plays in there," quarterback Dave Krieg said. "There was only 
a couple of running plays and a couple of pass plays. I like the concept. It 
spread things out. You've got to utilize the things we're best at and that is 
when we are in four wide receivers. That's the thing we've been doing the 
best." 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, the Seahawks' Spread offense is an expansion of their four wide 
receiver attack, which had been used mostly on third downs and ranks among the 
most productive units in the NFL in recent years. The Spread will be tried on 
some first- and second-down plays. The only way observers could tell the 
difference on third downs is whether Krieg plays directly behind center (in 
which case it's the Spread) or if he's in shotgun formation (the old four wide 
receiver set). 
</P>
<P>
"We will run more out of the Spread than we do in the four wide receiver 
alignment," John Becker, the offensive coordinator said. 
</P>
<P>
Becker installed some of the fundamentals of the new scheme during the minicamp 
this week. Players' reaction unanimously was positive. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good changeup so that we won't be predictable," Pro Bowl wide receiver 
Brian Blades said. "It's a real good outlet for receivers. No matter what 
coverages they get, someone should get open." 
</P>
<P>
As starters, Blades, Chadwick and Louis Clark are being used as the "wide" 
outs. Tommie Kane and Paul Skansi are the inside "slot." 
</P>
<P>
What comforted Chadwick the most was that the version used by Knox and Becker 
makes him an asset instead of a decoy as in the Run-and-Shoot system. In the 
pure Run-and-Shoot, split ends only make the job easier for the slot receivers. 
</P>
<P>
"The outside guy in that Run-and-Shoot doesn't get the ball that much," 
Chadwick said. "They just clean out for the inside guys. You are doing the 
running but not getting the gratification that you want. In other words, you 
are not getting the ball thrown to you." 
</P>
<P>
Chadwick had plenty of chances Thursday. He broke his routes short and made 
receptions. He cut them to the sidelines for catches. Once, a cornerback 
muttered his frustrations after a Chadwick reception. 
</P>
<P>
"This offense should keep defenses off balance," Skansi said. "Defenses can't 
tell if you are going to run or pass." 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to do what Detroit does and use it as 100 percent of your 
offense," Becker said. "We are not taking every idea and are not becoming a 
true Run-and-Shoot team." 
</P>
<P>
Expect screen passes to the lone setback. Expect more running plays than 
normal. Working from a pure Run-and-Shoot, rookie Barry Sanders of Detroit led 
the National Conference in rushing with 1,470 yards. 
</P>
<P>
A back as talented as John L. Williams could dream of gaining 1,000 yards 
receiving and rushing if he stays healthy. Standing behind him as a prime 
candidate for the one-back slot is Jones, who taught Williams how to be a 
fullback when they were teammates at the University of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"This will mix it up and make our offense more explosive," Jones said. "In 
Detroit, in four years, we had three different head coaches. When you keep 
changing head coaches, you're going to start cleaning out the old guys, and if 
you're going to lose, you're going to want to lose with young guys. Their 
offense require little guys who can catch the ball. They didn't want to have a 
Jeff Chadwick, who is too tall. They were able to get something for me." 
</P>
<P>
Knox's Spread doesn't want midget, so Chadwick has a place. So do 230-pound 
running backs such as Williams or Jones. 
</P>
<P>
And just remember, Knox and Becker keep insisting that the Run-and-Shoot can be 
used for the run.

HOCKEY IN MAY IS NEW EXPERIENCE FOR LIUT, CAPITALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF JACOBS, HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>

LANDOVER, Md.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Washington Capitals and Mike Liut have held much in common for several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Each has enjoyed a number of dynamite regular seasons. Neither has been to the 
Final Four of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
April showers may mean plenty of sweet-smelling things will blossom in May. But 
never the Caps or Liut. Hockey in May is a new experience for both. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of funny things can happen in the playoffs," said Liut as he prepared 
for Thursday's Wales Conference final opener in Boston. "Hockey can be such a 
fragile thing." 
</P>
<P>
The Caps became one of the NHL's premier regular-season teams starting in 1982. 
So what happened this season? They finished under .500 for the first time in 
eight seasons but are enjoying their greatest playoff success in their 16-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Liut was a first-team NHL All-Star in 1981 in St. Louis. He was Canada's goalie 
in the Canada Cup that year. In 1987 with the Whalers, Liut was named a 
second-team All-Star. 
</P>
<P>
"But how many games has he won in the playoffs the last three years or so," 
asked Hartford Whalers General Manager Ed Johnston a few days after he traded 
Liut to Washington March 5 for Yvon Corriveau. "Not many." 
</P>
<P>
Liut, in his 11th NHL season, and the Caps always have had their share of 
admirers and detractors. And those detractors still will tell you that Don 
Beaupre, who won four of five games and had a 2.55 average before hurting his 
groin, actually has been sharper than Liut. 
</P>
<P>
But Liut is 4-2 with a 3.24 goals-against average. And unless Coach Terry 
Murray pulls a surprising switch in favor of the healing Beaupre, Liut will be 
in goal for Game 1 against the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
"This is great," Liut, 34, said. "But the league's so close now I thought we 
had a chance in Hartford to be in this position this spring, too. It's crazy 
how momentum changes so quickly in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Liut didn't play the night of the Whalers' Game 4 disaster, a 6-5 loss to the 
Bruins. Beaupre did. When the score flashed up at the Cap Centre that the 
Whalers were ahead 5-2 in the third period, Liut said he looked down the bench 
at former Bruin Bob Joyce and said, "'Boston's dead.' But just at the end of 
our game, it flashed up, 5-5. It was mind-blowing." 
</P>
<P>
So was the trade. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an emotional blow," Liut said. "I didn't want to be traded as much for 
personal reasons as for professional ones. People say what does Hartford have 
compared to Boston, New York or Washington? Well, it's a heck of a nice place 
to raise a family. If I felt I needed a culture boost I could be in New York in 
two hours. We have a lot of friends in Hartford. It was really hard. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had the year that I had last year (13-19-1, 4.25 GAA) and I got traded, I 
might have retired. I hate to say one year was my best, but I was playing as 
well as I've ever played this year." 
</P>
<P>
Liut, whose 19-16-1 record pushed him to 13th on the all-time NHL victory list 
at 270, led the league with four shutouts and was second in goals against 
(2.53) and save percentage (.905). 
</P>
<P>
"My (knee) injury might have cost me an All-Star Game and a (Vezina) trophy," 
Liut said. "I felt I played as well as them (Patrick Roy and Daren Puppa), just 
not as many games." 
</P>
<P>
Liut says he will sell his Simsbury, Conn., home and move to the Washington 
area, although he hasn't decided if he will buy there. His wife, Mary Ann, and 
three children remain in Connecticut while he lives in a hotel. It has not been 
an easy two months for a devoted family man. 
</P>
<P>
Was he shocked by the trade? 
</P>
<P>
"There had been a lot of talk a few weeks before. I was involved. And I made a 
comment to Joel Quenneville and Ronnie Francis in the back of the bus (at the 
Cap Centre March 2), 'I may have played my last game for Hartford.' But I have 
to say I still did not think it would happen. 
</P>
<P>
"There was talk about Kevin Dineen, too. But nobody wants to pull a trigger on 
something like that. The one guy who they could trade with relative ease of 
conscience was me. At my age, there's much less chance I could embarrass them. 
Kevin could do it on and on and on." 
</P>
<P>
Is he bitter? 
</P>
<P>
"I've accepted the trade," Liut said. "I understand why they did it. You want 
to talk fiscal responsibility. Fine, we can write it off to that. They had to 
make a decision on goaltending and they made the decision to go with the 
younger guys. 
</P>
<P>
"And I think when they secured (No. 1 pick Bobby) Holik they started looking to 
next year. We weren't going anywhere in the standings. I thought I was in 
position to help that team for a couple of more years. The experience factor 
means a lot to younger players as long as the veteran player is willing to 
impart what he knows and they're willing to accept it." 
</P>
<P>
Liut has been promised a contract extension. It is a contract that pays 
$460,000 this year and enters its option next year. The Whalers have said they 
are picking up about $100,000 on the remainder of his deal. Liut said one more 
year probably would be added by the Caps. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to come down here as a Band-Aid," Liut said. 
</P>
<P>
So, Mike Liut, one of the bigger names in Hartford sports history, pushes on in 
life. After the Caps eliminated the Rangers 2-1 in overtime Friday, Liut came 
home Saturday for his daughter Jenna's First Communion. 
</P>
<P>
"The timing couldn't have been better," Liut said. "It's a big time in her 
life. She's a Camp Fire Girl, too. I was home for a day and I got to make an 
appearance, too, with her."

<P>
GARCIA DOES BETTER THAN OLD FRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Julio Garcia fared a lot better Saturday at Hollywood Park than his old friend 
did in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
Mister Frisky's rider for 10 of his 13 victories in Puerto Rico, Garcia won the 
second race aboard Syrian Winter, a maiden filly trained, ironically by Laz 
Barrera, then returned to score a $28.60 victory on Prospectors Gamble in the 
$110,200 Triple Bend Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
John Sadler looked to have a stranglehold on the seven-furlong Triple Bend with 
his duo of Olympic Prospect and Frost Free. The former, who had won six of his 
10 previous starts at Inglewood, was a 7-10 favorite. 
</P>
<P>
A month after the best effort of his life, Olympic Prospect went flat. Although 
he had a fast half-mile (21 2/5 and 43 3/5), the Northern Jove gelding appeared 
to be going easily under David Flores. 
</P>
<P>
However, he surrendered without a struggle in the final eighth of a mile and 
wound up fifth. Frost Free, who is partial to Santa Anita, was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth down the backside, Prospectors Gamble got the lead in midstretch and 
beat Raise A Stanza by nearly two lengths in 1:21 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
Raise A Stanza, the 4-1 second choice, was two lengths better than Hot 
Operator. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Wallace Dollase thought Itsallgreektome might be short for the $111,050 
Spotlight Breeders' Cup Handicap, which was run two races before the Triple 
Bend. 
</P>
<P>
Jockey Corey Nakatani didn't think the 3-year-old son of Sovereign Dancer had 
much chance against Warcraft, Somethingdifferent and six others in the mile 
turf race. 
</P>
<P>
Itsallgreektome proved both of them wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Making his grass debut and in his first start as a gelding -- a change not 
listed in either the Daily Racing Form or the track's official program, 
although it was reported by Dollase to the proper people -- Itsallgreektome, a 
31-1 shot, held off Warcraft to win by a nose in 1:34 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
"He ran to his work (48 2/5 on the turf Thursday morning), but actually I 
thought he might come up a little short," Dollase said. "He was very studdish 
and we castrated him after his last race (March 4). It made a big difference." 
</P>
<P>
Warcraft, the 8-5 favorite, didn't have the best of trips in his first grass 
outing. 
</P>
<P>
"He ran well, but he ran spotty," trainer Charlie Whittingham said. "I don't 
know about the Preakness. I'll think about it." 
</P>
<P>
If Unbridled was your pick in the Kentucky Derby, Hollywood Park was the place 
to be Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-1 fourth choice at Churchill Downs, Unbridled paid $44 at Inglewood. The 
$2 exacta coupling him with Summer Squall paid $145.20 locally, compared to 
$65.80 in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
The $930,617 handled at Hollywood Park was a record for a $2 exacta pool. 
Combined, Hollywood Park and the 10 intertrack locations handled $2,597,453 on 
the race and this was also a record for a single race.

CUDAHY'S MAJORITY HOPES TO BURY BICKERING AND GRUDGES FOR GOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

CUDAHY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The late-night April party after the election of incumbent City Councilman 
Joseph Graffio and his running mates, Alex Rodriguez and Jack Cluck, was more 
than just a victory celebration. 
</P>
<P>
To the three council members and their supporters, it also signaled the end of 
a city government so consumed by ceaseless bickering, political wheeling and 
dealing and personal grudges that council members were either calling each 
other names or refusing to speak to one another much of the time. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the council was virtually at a standstill while Cudahy emerged 
as one of the poorest cities in the nation and one of the most overcrowded 
cities in Los Angeles County, according to residents, business people and even 
the members of the old council. 
</P>
<P>
"The old council wasn't giving the city any guidance," said Councilman Joseph 
Fregeau, appointed to the City Council in 1989 to replace the late Gabe Zippi. 
"Everyone was fighting so much, no one cared about the city. . . . The people 
have said they are sick and tired of what's going on. They are tired of the 
(bickering over) gambling, the recalls, the council fights over social 
services. They are telling the council to get off the pot and start doing 
things for them." 
</P>
<P>
Council members, business people and residents said last week that they hope 
the new council will put aside the personal differences that plagued the former 
council and help get the city back on its feet. 
</P>
<P>
New council members say there will be no more bickering. 
</P>
<P>
Graffio and newcomers Rodriguez and Cluck are expected to join with Fregeau to 
form a solid bloc on the five-member council for the first time since 1986. 
They are political allies, and personal friends of Fregeau, who acted as their 
campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
Graffio, Rodriguez and Cluck mailed pamphlets during the campaign proclaiming 
themselves as "The Right Team." They also endorsed the same agenda. 
</P>
<P>
The strong ties may end a council split that reached a peak after Councilman 
Tom Thurman announced in January that he was resigning before the expiration of 
his term in April. 
</P>
<P>
After Thurman departed, the council met just once before the April 10 election. 
Almost nothing was accomplished, as the meeting dissolved into shouts and 
name-calling. Without Thurman to cast the swing vote, every key item failed, 
2-2. 
</P>
<P>
In separate interviews last week, Fregeau, Graffio, Rodriguez, Cluck and 
Councilman John Robertson outlined some of their ideas for Cudahy's future. 
They spoke of redevelopment, attracting new businesses to town and finding ways 
to control population density. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone was optimistic that the fighting that paralyzed the last council 
is a thing of the past. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson, the outsider on the new council, said the majority has already 
demoted or fired political foes on the city staff. Jim Herrin, an unsuccessful 
council candidate supported by Robertson, was replaced as a planning 
commissioner by former Councilwoman Faye Dunlap. Ebbie Mouton, who as city 
clerk had been involved in several clashes with City Manager Jack Joseph, was 
demoted to executive administrative aide. 
</P>
<P>
In replacing Herrin and Mouton, the new council members have already proven 
themselves to be "vindictive," Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not very hopeful things are going to get any better," he said. "Kicking 
out everyone who doesn't agree with you is not the way to end bickering. The 
council has to recognize that some things are going to be accomplished better 
by compromising than by eliminating people. 
</P>
<P>
"Until they are willing to sit down and get all the factions together, I 
predict that in two years we will see exactly the same thing we saw on the last 
council." 
</P>
<P>
The old council spent much of its time arguing about how bingo games and social 
services should be operated and who should run them. Some residents, fed up 
with constant bickering, targeted each member of the council for recall at one 
time or another during the last four years. All of the recall efforts failed. 
</P>
<P>
Some council members said Thurman's resignation stemmed from the fighting and 
the pressure that his colleagues exerted on him as the deciding vote on several 
issues. Thurman had earlier been removed as mayor by Graffio, Robertson and 
Fregeau, who said Thurman had been "indecisive." 
</P>
<P>
While the council members battled, the city was deteriorating, according to 
business people, residents and council members. 
</P>
<P>
Planning Commissioner Esmer Bryant said construction in the city has run 
rampant because of poor planning. 
</P>
<P>
Planning Director William Davis said city zoning laws and narrow, deep lots 
encourage construction of apartments. About 60% of the city is zoned for 
multifamily residential units. 
</P>
<P>
Most lots are about 52 feet wide and 395 feet deep, which encourages apartment 
development when single-family homes are vacated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The projects that the planning commission has been approving, some of which 
call for the replacement of a single-family home with a five-unit apartment 
building, have not helped the city's density problem, Davis acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
Cudahy ranked as the third-most-crowded city in the county in January, 1989, 
according to the Los Angeles County Department of Regional Planning. An 
estimated 20,955 people lived then in the 1.07-square-mile city. 
</P>
<P>
Cudahy has changed dramatically in the last decade. Once a conservative 
community of single-family homes populated by transplants from the Midwest, it 
now teems with Latino families who rent. The only commercial strip is along 
Atlantic Boulevard, which runs through the center of town. The big homes on 
spacious lots have been replaced by many apartments, creating traffic problems 
and a shortage of parking space. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been years of overpopulation and overbuilding, and the council let 
it happen," Bryant said. "They just have to put a stop to it." 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Cluck and Fregeau said the city is looking at ways to intensify code 
enforcement, such as cracking down on landlords who allow more than one family 
to live in a home or apartment. The council may also examine the General Plan 
and update zoning codes, Fregeau said. 
</P>
<P>
Cluck said the council has also discussed placing a moratorium on building 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
But much more has to be done, said businessman Henry Lee, who has operated his 
manufacturing company in Cudahy since 1957. 
</P>
<P>
The city needs to attract more businesses, he said. The city now receives most 
of its money from the sales tax produced by K mart and a Tiangus grocery store, 
and from a share of vehicle registration fees collected by the Department of 
Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"Our little city needs a whole lot of guidance, and it's got a tough way to 
go," Lee said. "Little has been done toward improving revenues for the city in 
the last few years, and we need development of businesses, especially along 
Atlantic Boulevard. Those will bring in the sales tax (revenues) we need to 
bring more development." 
</P>
<P>
Lee said the city should lobby harder for federal grants that would help Cudahy 
perk up its business climate. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said they plan to woo developers to improve the city's services 
and pad its small budget of $5 million a year. Fregeau said money that could 
have been used to improve the city had been wasted on projects that never 
materialized. 
</P>
<P>
"We just can't afford it," he said. "If we quit throwing away money and start 
being efficient, we can do what is best for this community." 
</P>
<P>
Council members said they have their work cut out for them but are already one 
giant step ahead of the last council. "Instead of having the friction we had 
before, we have councilmen who are going to work together," Graffio said. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't see anything in our future but go, go, go." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND In 1986, Cudahy voters elected Tom Thurman, Bill Colon and Joseph 
Graffio to the City Council. They joined John Robertson to oppose Councilman 
Gabe Zippi, who supported opening a card casino in the city. But issues 
relating to card casinos and bingo games continued to dominate council meetings 
in the next four years, triggering arguments and sharp divisions that virtually 
paralyzed city government, according to several officials and others.

BAUER, DAVIS WON'T SEEK REELECTION TO RENT BOARD; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA MONICA: THEY ARE ARGUABLY TWO OF THE BIGGEST PROPONENTS OF CONTROLS. BUT 
IN RECENT YEARS THEY HAVE BEEN AT ODDS WITH RENTERS' RIGHTS ORGANIZATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Monica Rent Control Board Chairwoman Susan Packer Davis and Commissioner 
Wayne Bauer, arguably the two most vocal proponents of rent control, announced 
last week that they will not seek reelection in November. 
</P>
<P>
A third commissioner, Eileen Lipson, has not formally announced her plans, but 
sources say Lipson has said privately that she will not run again. Lipson could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
If Lipson does not run, three of the four seats up for election would be 
without incumbents. The fourth seat is held by recently appointed Commissioner 
Jay Johnson, who says he will run for the post. The remaining commissioner is 
Dolores Press, whose term expires in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The three open seats are unlikely, however, to open the doors for a 
pro-landlord takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the situation probably will allow Santa Monicans for Renters Rights, a 
tenants group that successfully fought for rent control in 1979, to regain 
control of the board. 
</P>
<P>
Bauer and Davis, who in 1986 were elected as SMRR-backed candidates, have in 
recent years been on the opposite side of issues from the group, saying it was 
more interested in politics than in preserving low-cost housing for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
SMRR opposed a plan proposed by Bauer and Davis last year that allows landlords 
to raise rents significantly on some units, if an equal number of units are set 
aside for low-income tenants. When SMRR recently proposed changes in the rent 
control ordinance to allow landlords some increases and pass-through costs for 
improvements, Bauer and Davis denounced the proposals. 
</P>
<P>
If both had run in the November election, they surely would have faced 
candidates backed by the well-financed SMRR. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been very difficult for them to win without the SMRR 
endorsement, and I don't think they would have gotten it," said Brad Jones, 
co-chairman of SMRR. 
</P>
<P>
Even landlords concede that SMRR-backed candidates are likely to be elected 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
"I see no chance for anybody to be elected to that board who would be more 
neutral, simply because everyone who has been elected in the last 11 years has 
been cleared by SMRR," said John Rodriguez, president of Action, a local 
landlords group. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Lambert, an attorney and landlord, put it more concisely: "The rent 
control board will always be pro-tenants." 
</P>
<P>
Jones said it is too early to discuss possible candidates for the board. 
</P>
<P>
The announcements by Bauer and Davis did not come as a total surprise. There 
was some question about their eligibility for reelection because of a two-term 
limit imposed by the city Charter. Both had been appointed to complete 
unexpired terms of other commissioners and had been elected to another term and 
could have argued that they had not served two full terms. 
</P>
<P>
But Bauer and Davis said they decided not to run to abide by the spirit of the 
law. Bauer has served since being appointed in 1983. He was elected to a full 
term in 1986. Davis was appointed in 1981 and served until 1984, then stepped 
down. She was elected in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Rent board administrator Mary Ann Yurkonis had asked the city attorney to issue 
an opinion on their eligibility to run again, as well as Lipson's. Lipson was 
appointed to complete a term in 1984 and was elected to a full four-year term 
in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Robert M. Myers said that with the decision by Bauer and Davis not 
to run, his office will render a decision only on Lipson. He did not say when 
that opinion would be issued. 
</P>
<P>
Bauer, who is scheduled to graduate from law school this summer, said he is 
likely to retire from elected public service when he gets off the board in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
"I did the best I could," he said of his often-controversial seven years on the 
board. "That's not to say that if I could do things over again I wouldn't do 
some things differently. But I don't see myself as a public official again, 
although I do see myself playing a role politically for those things I believe 
in." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said one factor in her decision not to seek reelection was her 
frustration with state intervention in local rent control, particularly the 
1986 state Ellis Act, which allows landlords to evict tenants and get out of 
the rental business. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of our power was stripped by the state," she said. "I did not want to be 
presiding over something that is not quite alive." 
</P>
<P>
Press, who after the November election could be the only commissioner with more 
than a year of experience, said that if nothing else, Bauer and Davis were 
committed. 
</P>
<P>
Bauer and Davis caused a stir last December when they began to remain seated 
and bowed their heads in silence rather than salute the flag at the beginning 
of each board meeting to protest U.S. involvement in El Salvador and the 
killing of six Jesuit priests there. 
</P>
<P>
Many landlords, including some veterans, called the protest inappropriate and 
demanded their resignation. 
</P>
<P>
"Although we disagreed on some occasions, I have never doubted their sincerity 
or purpose," Press said. "Susan and Wayne have both fulfilled their 
responsibilities to the people of Santa Monica with great passion and 
commitment." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson added: "They are probably the most committed in the city to protecting 
low-income tenants."

HOMEOWNERS OK PLAN FOR GATED COMMUNITY; 
</P>
<P>
BALDWIN HILLS: CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL IS NEEDED. COUNCILWOMAN RUTH GALANTER 
OPPOSES THE PROPOSAL IN ITS PRESENT FORM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal to turn the Baldwin Hills Estates into a gated community was given 
overwhelming support in a community election which attracted slightly more than 
50% of the residents. 
</P>
<P>
The Baldwin Hills Estates Homeowners Assn. proposed the gates as a means of 
deterring vandals, burglars and the curious who have taken to wandering into 
the isolated hillside community since a fire devastated much of the area five 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was approved by a vote of 423 to 121 last week. The vote represented 
slightly more than half the 957 households in the community. 
</P>
<P>
"It means that the community is concerned about our security, our lifestyle and 
the value of our homes," said Joseph Gardner, the association's president. "It 
is a very positive vote." 
</P>
<P>
City Council approval is needed for the plan, but Ruth Galanter, the council 
member who represents the area, said that she does not support the proposal in 
its present form. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner said that the next step is for the association to start obtaining the 
necessary city permits for the project and to begin collecting the money to pay 
for the gates. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, seven electronic gates will be used to cut off vehicle and 
pedestrian access to the community. Residents will be able to operate the gates 
with a device similar to a garage door opener and from their homes by phone to 
let in visitors. Police, fire and other city services will be given secret 
codes to open the gates. 
</P>
<P>
It is expected to cost an estimated $225,000 to install the gates, about $225 
per household, Gardner said. Annual maintenance costs have not yet been 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
"We are obviously going to need the participation of the residents for the 
gates to be built, but the vote is a strong indication that we will get it," 
Gardner said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal to install the gates has been under discussion since the community 
was hit by an arson-set fire on June 2, 1985, which destroyed 53 homes, damaged 
13 others and killed three people. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter, questioned the plan, saying that communities seeking to become gated 
should be prepared to assume responsibility for maintaining other city 
services. 
</P>
<P>
"If it is owned by the public and maintained by the public then the public 
should be able to use it," she said. "The question really is how much financial 
burden can the city be expected to shoulder for an area that is not available 
to all city residents." 
</P>
<P>
Gardner said that the association plans to meet with Galanter to work out any 
differences. If they cannot do that, he added, the association will go 
elsewhere for support. "We certainly hope to have her support, but if we have 
to we will go directly to the City Council for approval," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter said the council will not support the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"If they are asking for the public to maintain private streets, no one on the 
council will swallow that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The association's plans call for two gates at the intersection of Don Miguel 
and Don Lorenzo drives. Other gates will be located at Don Lorenzo near Don 
Porfirio Place; Don Quixote Drive near Don Tomaso Drive; Don Miguel Drive near 
Don Tomaso Drives; Don Felipe Drive near Marlton Avenue; and Hillcrest Drive 
near Don Ricardo Drive.

While many cities offer rewards for information that leads to the arrest and 
conviction of such vandals, Lynwood officials said their program offers a 
reward for simply naming them. 
</P>
<P>
The city is offering $300 more for information that results in an arrest and 
conviction. A reward fund of $10,000 was established. 
</P>
<P>
To earn the bounty, a person must call City Hall with the name and correct 
address of a vandal. If the information is verified by sheriff's deputies, the 
citizen will be given the $50, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, letters were sent to the city's 14,000 residents asking for 
help in identifying vandals. Officials promised that the information would be 
kept confidential. 
</P>
<P>
So far, about 15 citizens have called. Just 10 callers left their names. The 
city has not yet paid the $50 bounty to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they started the reward-for-names program because they were 
disgusted with graffiti. "We're fed up with them destroying our city. We are 
ending up with everything looking like hell," Mayor Robert Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
For about a year the vandals have been hitting all areas of the city, he said. 
"They hit around schools, major streets and buildings," he said. "They want 
other kids to see their work. They hope the other kids will join them. They 
think its a big joke." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Louis J. Heine said the city spends more than $200,000 a year on 
graffiti cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
"We have got to do something to stop spending this money on graffiti," he said. 
"We could be using it to make necessary repairs to the streets and sidewalks." 
</P>
<P>
Vandals keep six employees of the graffiti work crew busy five days a week, 
Ralph Davis said. Davis supervises the graffiti removal crew. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1989, the crew had 426 cleanup jobs, compared with 529 in February 
this year, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Spraying graffiti is a misdemeanor punishable by a $1,000 fine and six months 
in jail.

Tracking Drug Money 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 127 to 283, the House defeated the stricter of two proposals for 
banks to keep records of international wire transfers that could involve drug 
money. The proposal was for a Treasury Department pilot program in which 
selected banks would have had to keep track of customers wiring large sums 
overseas. Left intact by the vote was the softer approach, supported by bank 
lobbyists, of letting Treasury draft regulations address the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the pilot program aimed at catching drug 
traffickers.

Budget Plan Rejected 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 106 to 305, the House rejected a blueprint for the government's 
$1.2-trillion fiscal 1991 budget. Popular among Republicans, the measure called 
for higher defense and lower social spending than the Democratic budget plan 
(HR 310) it sought to replace. But it was less generous to defense than 
President Bush's budget. Its main feature was to freeze defense and domestic 
spending other than for entitlement programs at 1990 levels. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the GOP-backed budget plan.

DELAYS ON CANAL WORK UNNECESSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As longtime canal residents and property owners, we found Nancy Hill-Holtzman's 
April 22 article on the Venice Canals misleading. 
</P>
<P>
The original concrete bulkhead project sponsored by the Venice Canals Assn. was 
acknowledged as environmentally unsound in the Environmental Impact Report that 
the VCA bought for the city. 
</P>
<P>
That city bureaucrats and some property owners chose to repeatedly ignore 
numerous environmental and historical cautions from the federal and state 
agencies does not warrant a revision of the facts. 
</P>
<P>
Simply put, the VCA lobbied the city, reality was ignored, and hundreds of 
taxpayers' dollars were spent developing a project that was predictably 
unacceptable to the state and federal agencies that had final approval. It is 
to Councilwoman (Ruth) Galanter's credit that once she assumed office she 
refused to allow the city to waste anymore Coastal Commission time on this 
fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
We are disappointed that Councilwoman Galanter is going to allow the VCA to 
delay the project for another 18 months. During the past two years, at the 
request of the VCA, the city has conducted many studies of Amorflex and 
Loffelstein (types of concrete blocks). These studies always come to the same 
conclusion, that Amorflex is safer, more environmentally appropriate, and 
significantly less costly (two to three times) than Loffelstein. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Galanter needs to bring this to a closure. Trying to satisfy the 
VCA is expensive, time-consuming and impossible. There is nothing to debate and 
the city should stop pandering to the VCA. All of the experts say that Amorflex 
is the material to use.

RENT LAW CHANGES MUST BE REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was recently reported that landlord groups are planning an initiative 
campaign in Santa Monica to change the rent control law to allow "vacancy 
decontrol." As a co-chair of Santa Monicans for Renters' Rights (SMRR), the 
organization that won rent control in 1979, I urge Santa Monica residents not 
to sign the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The landlords want us to believe that vacancy decontrol will protect against 
Ellis Act evictions, but there is no guarantee in their initiative. Rising real 
estate values will continue to spur Ellis evictions in order to build 
condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
The landlords want us to believe that current tenants will be protected against 
harassment. However, with vacancy decontrol, unscrupulous landlords will have a 
huge monetary incentive to "encourage" current tenants to leave if they can get 
two or three times more from the next tenant. 
</P>
<P>
These are two specific reasons to oppose this initiative, but the most 
important reason is that vacancy decontrol is bad policy for the community as a 
whole. With vacancy decontrol, within a few years we would see rent levels in 
Santa Monica surge beyond those in West Los Angeles. Santa Monica would become 
a haven for the very rich, and the diversity we cherish would be gone forever. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, we in SMRR recognize that conditions have changed since 1979. 
Some changes may be needed in rent control. SMRR is working right now on 
proposals to make rent control work better for everyone, tenants and landlords, 
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, our rent control law has worked well to keep rents affordable to 
people of all income groups and ages. Most of us couldn't afford to live here 
without it. It must be maintained. 
</P>
<P>
This vacancy decontrol initiative tears the heart out of the rent control law. 
It must be rejected. Please do not sign it.

CULVER CITY ELECTION COVERAGE CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I wish to criticize the Times' biased reporting during the recent Culver City 
election. Through half-truths and innuendoes, The Times castigated several of 
our city's leading citizens due to the honest mistake of one. 
</P>
<P>
I invite a review of the articles in the April 8 edition, where the newspaper 
portrayed a war between "slow-growth forces," "pro-growth forces" and also 
"advocates of expanded development." It stated: "The names of those signing 
Measure I were released by City Clerk (Pauline) Dolce to pro-development 
forces. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Dolce did not release names to "forces," pro- or anti-development. The names 
were given to one, two or perhaps three council members sometime in 1988, 
before there was any discussion of competing slow-growth measures and at a time 
when all involved believed that the signature list was public knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
Although it may not be exciting, the truth is that the overwhelming majority of 
Culver City residents share the same opinion on development: It must be 
cautious, reasonable and beneficial. That is why Marina Place was so strongly 
supported. An idiot could travel Culver City's borders with Los Angeles and 
realized which community is pro-growth and which is pro-citizen.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tracking Drug Money 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 127 to 283, the House defeated the stricter of two proposals for 
banks to keep records of international wire transfers that could involve drug 
money. The proposal was for a Treasury Department pilot program in which 
selected banks would have had to keep track of customers wiring large sums 
overseas. Left intact by the vote was the softer approach, supported by bank 
lobbyists, of letting Treasury draft regulations to address the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The issue arose during debate on a bill (HR 3848), later sent to the Senate, 
that empowered the government to close institutions convicted of laundering 
drug money. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the pilot program aimed at catching drug 
traffickers.

Budget Plan 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 106 to 305, the House rejected a blueprint for the government's 
$1.2-trillion fiscal 1991 budget. Popular among Republicans, the measure called 
for higher defense and lower social spending than the Democratic budget plan 
(HR 310) it sought to replace. But it was less generous to defense than 
President Bush's budget. Its main feature was to freeze defense and domestic 
spending other than for entitlement programs at 1990 levels. 
</P>
<P>
The vote occurred as the House worked toward approval of a 1991 congressional 
budget resolution that will guide later action on individual spending bills and 
serve as a bargaining tool in talks with the White House to set fiscal 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the GOP-backed budget plan.

DOES SKIN COLOR MAKE A DIFFERENCE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Did Mayor (William) Thomson and City Directors (John) Crowley, (Kathryn) Nack 
and (William) Paparian use poor judgment? Let's examine the facts: 
</P>
<P>
It seems that Mr. Hawkey has had the support of Mayor Thomson and the three 
directors for the past several weeks. This same group has not supported Mr. 
Bond. 
</P>
<P>
Let's look at the qualifications of Mr. Hawkey and Mr. Bond: 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Bond is presently the president of the National Forum for Black Public 
Administrators. He has an impeccable record as county manager of Durham, N.C. 
He has guided the county from a stagnant economy to a robust, high-tech 
industrial-based economy. He has an excellent reputation as an administrator 
throughout Durham and the surrounding areas. There appears to be no discord as 
a result of his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Hawkey's administration has been embroiled in controversy throughout his 
tenure. He took over a city with serious racial and economic problems. However, 
very little progress, if any, has been made in any of these important areas. He 
has been told that he will be "fired" as of May 15 if he doesn't find other 
employment by that date. He has recently been rejected employment in Anaheim, 
Calif., and Maricopa County, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
I ask the question, why should Pasadena hire someone as city manager who has 
been refused employment by three other cities? It would appear that the mayor 
and the three board members have clouded vision. 
</P>
<P>
Let's consider what would have happened during the screening process had Mr. 
Hawkey been black and Mr. Bond white, leaving their respective qualifications 
unchanged. There is no question, in my mind, that Mr. Bond would have received 
a unanimous vote of approval. There is also no doubt, in my mind, that Mr. 
Hawkey would have been disqualified early on in the selection process. 
</P>
<P>
The standard rule of thumb in the hiring process is not to hire when there are 
too many "red flags" surfacing. The premise being when you see smoke, there is 
probably a fire. So why should Pasadena take a chance on a questionable 
candidate when they have an unblemished candidate to choose from? 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Bond is obviously doing an outstanding job in Durham. Why, then, is our 
mayor so determined to hire Mr. Hawkey, a second-rate administrator from 
Toledo? Could it be that the color of one's skin really does make a difference? 
Can Pasadena afford to be divided because our mayor and three board members 
refuse to objectively review the candidates? 
</P>
<P>
Again, I ask, what if Mr. Hawkey were black and Mr. Bond were white?

SLANTED REPORTING ON CHOICE FOR PASADENA CITY MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I greatly admire The Times, which generally seems to report objectively. 
However, the April 29 report with the biased -- clearly non-neutral -- heading 
"Doubts Cloud Pasadena Choice," on the question of installing Philip Hawkey as 
the Pasadena city manager, was quite noticeably slanted. 
</P>
<P>
"Doubts Cloud" sounds decidedly damning. And, about Hawkey's "career hopes," 
the staff writer, Vicki Torres, asserted that they "have plummeted." This is 
not reportage. This is an expression of the personal view of the writer. 
</P>
<P>
On April 26 the Pasadena City Directors dutifully met to reconsider Hawkey 
after being prevailed upon to do so by a storm of protest that had erupted at 
their April 24 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
But this was old "news" when the April 29 story was printed. The latest news 
was that on April 27 Bernard Culp, the black former Toledo, Ohio, city official 
controversially fired by Hawkey, defended the man who fired him, saying, "It is 
time to let City Manager Hawkey find a job" (as Pasadena city manager). 
</P>
<P>
Because of this development and other reasons, Hawkey's prospects had begun to 
look much brighter. And your writer wrote that Hispanics in Toledo had not been 
"hired in numbers equal to their representation in the work force," giving the 
impression -- without giving specifics -- that Hawkey had mistreated them. The 
evidence was so thin that this subject should not even have been mentioned. 
Torres failed to say that the percentage of Hispanic residents in Toledo is a 
mere 3% -- not nearly enough for statistical reliability in pinning down 
culpability by Hawkey -- who has hired blacks in excess of their representation 
in the work force. 
</P>
<P>
Seemingly, your staff writer just doesn't want to see Philip Hawkey hired as 
Pasadena city manager.

FISHING INDUSTRY TRIES TO REVIVE TAX EXEMPTION; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATION: ASSEMBLYMAN GERALD N. FELANDO'S BILL WOULD EXEMPT COMMERCIAL 
DEEP-SEA AND CHARTER FISHING BOATS FROM THE SALES AND USE TAX FOR DIESEL FUEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
California's commercial fishing industry, reeling from hard times, is 
attempting to resurrect a tax break worth at least $1.1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
With fishing industry support, Assemblyman Gerald N. Felando (R-San Pedro) is 
seeking passage of legislation to exempt commercial deep-sea and charter 
fishing operations from the sales and use tax for diesel fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Twice in the past six years, the Legislature has approved temporary diesel fuel 
tax breaks for the state's commercial fishing vessels. The most recent tax 
break lapsed on Jan. 1, 1989, but Felando now is pushing for a permanent 
exemption. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just trying to save an industry," said Felando, 55, who as a youth 
worked aboard his father's fishing boat. "Every little bit helps." 
</P>
<P>
Fishermen also say they should be treated the same as farmers, who since the 
1930s have enjoyed a similar diesel tax exemption for farm vehicles. Felando's 
bill is opposed by the state Department of Finance, which says the measure 
singles out one business class for special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Lenny Goldberg, lobbyist for the California Tax Reform Assn., a public interest 
tax group, has criticized the proposal as "the tax exemption that won't die." 
Goldberg complained that there has never been a determination of who benefits 
from the tax break. "There are no hard numbers that it makes a difference." 
</P>
<P>
But fisherman John Vilicich estimated that when the exemption was in place he 
saved from $7,000 to $14,000 a year on diesel fuel for a large tuna boat. He 
said owners of smaller boats could save several thousand dollars a year. 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of whether you catch the fish or not, you still burn fuel," 
Vilicich said. The San Pedro fisherman said he used the savings for boat 
maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of several commercial fishing groups said they have been persistent 
about reviving the legislation because their members are facing economic rough 
seas. The fishermen complain they are plagued by increasing foreign 
competition, rising costs and dwindling numbers of fish. 
</P>
<P>
Fishermen trace their troubles to 1984, when they experienced serious drops in 
income because of El Nino, a warm ocean current that disrupted worldwide 
weather patterns. 
</P>
<P>
Mindful of those adverse conditions, the Legislature approved a two-year diesel 
fuel tax exemption. But in 1986, Gov. George Deukmejian vetoed an extension of 
the exemption, saying: "Other industries experiencing similar hardships are not 
afforded similar tax exemptions." 
</P>
<P>
Later, the industry persuaded the governor to sign a one-year exemption for 
1988. It was designed to cushion commercial fishing boat operators from 
economic disruptions caused by the closure of canneries, increased insurance 
costs and rising ship-repair costs, according to an Assembly analysis of the 
latest Felando proposal. Two other efforts to revive the exemption died in the 
Legislature. The latest legislative initiative -- the Felando bill -- is 
pending in the Assembly Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters say Felando's bill should be enacted, in part, because boat 
operators continue to face tough times. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back to 1980, 800 million pounds of fish, valued at $316 million, were 
brought into California's ports, according to the state Department of Fish and 
Game. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, with fishermen feeling the brunt of El Nino, the figures dropped to 
357 million pounds caught off California, valued at almost $127 million. But, 
by 1988 -- the latest year for which figures are available -- the picture 
brightened with 496 million pounds of fish worth $201 million coming into the 
ports. Still, the amount was below the 1980 level. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Crehan, general manager of the San Pedro-based Fishermen's Cooperative 
Assn., said low catches are continuing, describing April as a poor month for 
his members. In the past five years, he said, the membership of his fish 
marketing cooperative has dropped by a third -- from 24 to 16. 
</P>
<P>
But even without the bad times for the fishing industry, the tax exemption 
should be reinstated, say other supporters of the bill. They note that farm 
equipment and off-road logging trucks that use diesel fuel are already exempted 
from the sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
Crehan argued that marine fishermen should get the same break as farmers 
"because both of them are producing food." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Fletcher, president of the San Diego-based Sportfishing Assn. of 
California, voiced a similar argument, saying that fishing enthusiasts aboard 
his group's party boats are fishing for food. "We believe that most of our 
passengers are from lower-income levels and supplement their protein by eating 
fish," Fletcher said. 
</P>
<P>
The opponents, however, regard the legislation as unfair. 
</P>
<P>
If the fishing industry requires help, said Goldberg of the Tax Reform Assn., 
the state should target the economic aid to those fishing boat owners who need 
it the most. Goldberg added that the state has failed to study the impact of 
previous exemptions. "It's unclear whether (they have) made much difference," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
In its review of the bill, the Finance Department noted that the fishing 
industry already receives preferential treatment because, under existing law, 
ships and their component parts are exempt from sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, according to the department's analysis, the original exemption was 
"intended to provide temporary, not permanent" relief.

JAMES FLANIGAN: DON'T BELIEVE ALL THE BAD ECONOMIC NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We may be looking good. A spate of government statistics and Federal Reserve 
surveys released last week show the economy to be in relatively good health 
after a slow period. 
</P>
<P>
Or we may be looking bad. A Federal Reserve official worried that rising 
inflation in the strong economy could force a hike in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
In short, another case of the two-handed economy: sunshine on the one hand, 
rain on the other. 
</P>
<P>
What should you believe? Very little. When it comes to most claims about the 
economy, it's best to be skeptical and to look behind the statistics, where, as 
it happens, the story is often reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
A clear eye could be particularly useful this week because the U.S. government 
will offer $30.5 billion of new Treasury bonds for sale in one of its periodic 
refundings of the national debt. The bonds, in maturities of 3, 10 and 30 
years, are expected to offer high interest rates -- approaching 9%. 
</P>
<P>
Experts are calling them a good deal for the small investor, who can buy bonds 
directly from the Federal Reserve or through banks or brokers in $5,000 
increments for the three-year maturities and in lots of $1,000 for the longer 
durations. 
</P>
<P>
But this is where you need a feel for inflation, because a rise in the consumer 
price index on the order of the 8.5% jump that occurred in the first three 
months of 1990 could wipe out the return on the bonds. At 9% interest, a $5,000 
investment will pay $450 interest per year, or $324 after 28% federal income 
tax. If inflation stays at 4.5% or less, that would give you a real gain of 
$100 a year or more. But if inflation were higher, your Treasury bond would be 
a loser. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, higher inflation would bring still higher interest rates, causing 
your bonds to sell at a discount -- meaning you would lose principal if you 
sold before maturity. The upshot is that if the outlook is higher inflation, 
you'd be better off in a short-term money fund, which can keep abreast of 
rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
So it's important that you know the real story on inflation -- which is 
reassuring. Experts are agreed that the first quarter was a fluke -- food and 
fuel prices rose because of extreme cold weather. The April-June quarter will 
show inflation below 4%, says Stacy Kaufman of Georgia State University's 
Economic Forecasting Project, and the rate for the year should settle at 4.5% 
or so. 
</P>
<P>
Even that may overstate the case, if you consider what goes into the 
government's inflation index. Apparel, for example, is a major component of the 
CPI. But clothing prices jump around as stores go from discounting older styles 
to charging more for new spring fashions. Later, as those fashions are 
discounted in turn, prices fall and with them the inflation rate. Apparel is a 
big industry to be sure, but nobody believes that fashion should determine 
interest rates for the whole economy. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, 4.5% inflation is no crisis. 
</P>
<P>
As to the economy, the good times returning are not boom times and so are 
unlikely to force a boost in interest rates. The recovery owes a lot to 230,000 
workers regaining their jobs in the automobile, metals and rubber industries, 
explains John Paulus, chief economist at Morgan Stanley. The rise in 
unemployment last month reflects a slowdown in construction. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the defense-aerospace industries, which employ roughly 1.3 million 
nationwide -- perhaps 400,000 in Southern California -- remain vulnerable to 
budget cuts being debated in Congress. Cutting back will present problems, but 
not inflationary ones. 
</P>
<P>
"Business is gradually regaining momentum, but there is no boom," says Adrian 
Dillon, chief economist of Eaton Corp., a Cleveland maker of automotive and 
electrical equipment. And good profits are hard to come by, especially with 
global competitors setting up right in the U.S. market. The result is that 
American companies are having to cut costs -- which is why the latest figures 
show rising investment in computers and other automated equipment. That 
spending will result in more production at less cost -- higher productivity, in 
other words, and thus lower inflation. 
</P>
<P>
But even there, measures of the economy may not fully reflect reality. It is 
said, for instance, that medical costs keep pushing up inflation. But that may 
be measuring the cost more than the economic benefit of the expensive new heart 
monitor that saves lives. More simply, if the dentist fills a tooth less 
painfully because of new materials or equipment, the bill may go up to reflect 
the equipment but the gain in painlessness may go unrecorded. 
</P>
<P>
The point is that simple statistics seldom capture the complex and resilient 
U.S economy -- $5.4 trillion a year in goods and services. And fears about its 
fragility are usually overblown. 
</P>
<P>
In that regard, you may recall the Treasury's last refinancing, in February, 
and the widespread worry then that Japanese investors wouldn't be big buyers. 
As it happened, Japanese investors bought their customary percentage, but the 
real story of that $30-billion auction was that U.S. investors were eager 
buyers. 
</P>
<P>
And this week should see brisk demand for the Treasury's new bonds. Why? 
Because the American people have recently increased their personal savings by 
$200 billion and so have plenty of investable funds. Those are the same 
Americans who only recently were said to be saving so little that the whole 
economy was threatened. The moral, again: Don't believe everything you hear and 
keep your eyes open.

Q: I'm watching the stock of Wendy's. It appears to have been forming a base at 
about $4 a share. Is this company a sound investment or am I just too fond of 
burgers? -- Glenview, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
A: Wendy's did bounce off the $4 level and was recently selling for nearly $5. 
But don't interpret that to mean that this company isn't still in a pickle 
trying to compete with the likes of McDonald's. Edward M. Tavlin, an analyst 
with Josephthal &amp; Co., has a neutral opinion on Wendy's right now. "Wendy's 
is a survivor involved in a continuing struggle in a very competitive market," 
says Tavlin. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy's earned 25 cents a share in 1989, plus it had 7 cents in extraordinary 
gains for a total of 32 cents. It will probably come close to that performance 
in 1990, according to Tavlin. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My inquiry has to do with Safeway Stores' 1996 warrants. A friend of mine 
told me to buy them. Since Safeway has announced its intention to issue stock, 
are my warrants being called? Should I buy more warrants? I'm neither a widow 
nor orphan, so I don't worry about the risks involved. -- Larkspur, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
A: You didn't give any details about the warrants, so it took some digging. But 
here goes: 
</P>
<P>
The warrants are callable by the company only after 1991. But after you wrote 
your letter, Safeway indeed issued 10 million shares, representing 10% of the 
company. They were priced at $11.25 a share on April 26 and closed that day in 
New York at $12.375. The warrants you hold can be converted into stock at your 
option. As you probably know, each warrant represents the right to purchase 
approximately 0.279 common shares. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Executives of Ames Department Stores have been buying a lot of the company's 
stock lately, starting at around $12 a share. Now it sells for just above $4. 
Can all these insiders be wrong? Or is Ames a smart buy? -- Grand Island, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
A: If Ames executives have been buying a lot of their company's stock as you 
say, it just proves that insiders can be as dumb as anyone else. Since you 
wrote, Ames stock has halved in price. It's now selling for just $2 a share. 
And even that may be too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
The Connecticut-based retailing company has lots of problems that began with 
its 1988 acquisition of Zayre Corp. for $800 million. It couldn't turn the 
discount store chain around and has been closing stores ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My question involves Skyline Corp. Why are its assets so liquid and its 
stock value so low? -- Skokie, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
A: Robert Curran, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., says Skyline's stock 
has never really reflected the fact that the company has a lot of cash and very 
little debt. And he can't explain why. 
</P>
<P>
According to Curran, Skyline -- which makes recreational vehicles and 
manufactured housing -- has more than $9 a share of cash on its books. Even so, 
its stock was recently selling for a little over $14. Curran says the same 
relationship between the amount of available cash and the stock price has 
existed for years. Not too many years ago, some enterprising corporate raider 
would have had his eyes on all that cash. But today, as you've probably read, 
the raiders have all been put to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
One factor that's been weighing heavily on Skyline's stock is slipping profits. 
The company earned $1.53 a share in the fiscal year that ended in May, 1989. 
Curran is estimating that profits will be down to 85 or 90 cents this year. 
Institutional Brokers Estimate System says the most optimistic analyst is 
predicting a 25-cent decline. 
</P>
<P>
Skyline's business has been hurt by tax law changes in the mid-1980s, which 
promoted the construction of apartments in suburban areas. These apartments 
proved attractive competition for mobile homes. Also, when mortgage rates 
declined from their peaks a decade ago, many consumers opted to splurge on 
houses rather than buy mobile homes. And now, with home prices declining in 
many parts of the country, the conventional single-family dwelling is an even 
more attractive alternative. JOHN CRUDELE

DECISION THAT IS PROTECTING DOLPHINS SHOWS THAT ONE INDIVIDUAL CAN MAKE A 
DIFFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, an individual has made a difference ("Film Turns Tide for Dolphins 
at StarKist Tuna," April 14). 
</P>
<P>
Here's to Samuel F. LaBudde, the biologist-photographer, whose painful-to-watch 
videotape documented the killing of dolphins during tuna fishing operations. 
</P>
<P>
And here's especially to Jerry Moss, A&amp;M Records executive, who took it a 
step further and met at lunch with Anthony J. F. O'Reilly of H. J. Heinz Co., 
to persuade that firm's top man to boycott tuna at StarKist that had been 
caught using dolphin-killing methods. Untold numbers of animals will be spared 
cruel and needless deaths because of Jerry Moss' persistence and dedication. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, here's to O'Reilly as well. His announcement of such a boycott 
started the snowball rolling, prompting other tuna packers to announce similar 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
Here's to dedicated individuals like these everywhere and the profound, humane 
differences they -- and all of us -- can make.

LINCOLN SAVINGS FAILURE WON'T COST UNCLE SAM

<TEXT>
<P>
In "Lincoln S&amp;L Posts Loss of $1 Billion for Year," (March 28) the last 
line reads "the failure of the thrift . . . could cost the government more than 
$2 billion." 
</P>
<P>
This is wrong. It will not cost the "government" one cent because it has no 
money.

It will cost the taxpayers $2 billion -- or more.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

In "Diet for a New America," author John Robbins points out that fast-food 
hamburger chains are the principal offenders in the rape of the rain forests. A 
football field of atmosphere-nourishing trees are razed daily, primarily to 
provide pasture land for beef (despite clown-faced Ronald McDonald's 
reassurance that hamburgers grow in hamburger patches). 
</P>
<P>
Robbins, who points out that any ecological turnabout must begin on our own 
plates, suggests that every American who forgoes one quarter-pounder per week 
effectively saves an acre of rain forest per year.

HOT PROPERTY: BATMAN'S GIRL BUYS IN THE HILLS 
</P>

<P>
Actress KIM BASINGER, who starts work this month with actors Alec Baldwin and 
Robert Loggia on Hollywood Pictures' production of Neil Simon's period romance 
"The Marrying Man," has purchased a Hollywood Hills hideaway for nearly $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Basinger, who most recently co-starred with Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson 
in "Batman" -- one of the top-grossing movies of all time -- bought the 
1,728-acre town of Braselton, Ga., in January with a Chicago company for $20 
million. They plan to develop a film and recording center there. 
</P>
<P>
Her one-story, 1,700-square-foot Hollywood Hills house has only one bedroom, 
but it's behind gates, on half an acre, and has a spa. She plans to use the 
pied-a-terre as a retreat and place to work when she's in town, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"It also has view of the city that would rattle your teeth," said selling 
broker Alan Long of Dalton, Brown &amp; Long. 
</P>
<P>
Long wouldn't discuss financial terms of the deal but described the house, 
which was built in the 1950s, as being "a wonderful Spanish bungalow that the 
former owner turned into a Faberge egg, it was done in such detail." 
</P>
<P>
The seller is a co-owner of a trendy beauty salon on Burton Way in Beverly 
Hills. He purchased a larger home behind gates farther west through Long. 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Crane, daughter of actress Lana Turner, represented Basinger through 
Long's firm, though Crane is now with Alvarez, Hyland &amp; Young. She was 
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
TED FIELD, executive producer of the movies "Bird on a Wire" and "Three Men and 
a Baby," has put his Westside estate, known as "Greenacres," on the market at 
what is believed to be the highest price ever asked for a private home in the 
United States: $55 million. 
</P>
<P>
He has also listed his two-house Aspen, Colo., compound at $29 million. "It is 
probably the most expensive Alpine chalet in the United States," said Paris 
Moskopoulos of Paris Realty in Beverly Hills, who represents Field on both 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
Field bought the larger, 15,000-square-foot house in Aspen a couple years ago 
from Chris Hemmeter, who developed the Westin Kaui Lagoons and other hotels in 
Hawaii. Field then purchased a 4,000-square-foot house next door from a doctor 
and connected the two homes, using the smaller one for guests. 
</P>
<P>
Field, an heir of Chicago department store magnate Marshall Field who is listed 
in the Forbes 400 as having a net worth of more than $500 million, and his 
third wife, Susie, recently filed for divorce after 2 1/2 years of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
"But they are on very good terms," Moskopoulos said. "In fact, they are dating 
each other." 
</P>
<P>
He is buying her a 23,000-square-foot Beverly Hills house near Greenacres, 
however, which is in escrow at close to $14 million, its list price with Bruce 
Nelson of John Bruce Nelson &amp; Associates. Until that deal closes, in a 
couple of months, Susie, who is expecting the couple's third child, is staying 
at Greenacres, which Field owns and also calls home. 
</P>
<P>
That house is 36,000 square feet in size, with five family bedrooms and four 
bedrooms for the staff. 
</P>
<P>
Greenacres, partly in Los Angeles and partly in Beverly Hills, was built in 
1928 by silent-screen star Harold Lloyd, who lived in it until he died at age 
77 in 1971. It was a museum for a year, when it was sold because funds to 
maintain it ran short and neighbors were complaining about the traffic it 
generated. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-acre property was subdivided in 1976, and the Italian Renaissance-style 
house, on a bit more than 5 acres, was sold in 1979. The new owners restored 
it, had it designated a historic monument, then sold it, when they were 
divorced, to Field. 
</P>
<P>
He moved into it in May, 1987, after buying it for what was considered a low 
price at the time: $6.5 million. Then he practically gutted the mansion, 
restored everything and installed an 80-foot-long swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
Field has held a number of political and other fund-raisers at Greenacres since 
completing the restoration, including a sit-down dinner in February for 850 
people. Field also owns a Malibu Colony house that he bought from actor Michael 
Landon last August for $6 million, then nearly razed and is almost completed 
rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
He owns a Bel-Air house that he bought from comedienne Joan Rivers last August 
for about $5 million, which is being used by his second wife, and he owns 
another Bel-Air house that is being used by his first wife. 
</P>
<P>
He also owns a 40-acre ranch in Santa Barbara and the 16-story Murdock Plaza in 
Westwood, where the Interscope Group, encompassing his movie production and 
record companies, are headquartered. 
</P>
<P>
Lakers guard LARRY DREW and his wife, Sharon, just purchased a new, 
4,500-square-foot house in Encino for close to its asking price of $1.15 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"They just had a baby, Larry Drew II, and that's why they wanted a big house," 
said a spokeswoman for Fred Sands Realtors, which had the listing through Sandy 
Brickman and Cynthia Leech. 
</P>
<P>
The Drews had been living in Inglewood, according to selling broker Stephen 
Shapiro of Stan Herman &amp; Associates, Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro also represented realtor Herman in the purchase of a Carbon Beach house 
with 100 feet of ocean frontage for nearly $5.5 million.

<P>
CONSULTANTS PLAY MAJOR ROLE IN DEVELOPERS' DECISIONS ON WHERE, WHEN, WHAT TO 
BUILD 
</P>

When Signal Landmark got tentative approval to build homes on 1,700 acres in 
the Bolsa Chica area of Orange County, one of the first things company 
officials did was hire a consultant to tell them what type of homes to build on 
the coastal property. 
</P>
<P>
The adviser they hired, Goodkin Real Estate Consulting Group of San Diego, 
supervised an in-depth survey of 100 upscale households. 
</P>
<P>
Respondents were asked housing likes and dislikes, and to comment on 36 
drawings of homes, walls, landscaping and other architectural and design 
features. 
</P>
<P>
"Results from the study, (completed in December) show consumer tastes evolving 
toward the more traditional," said Sanford R. Goodkin, head of the firm that 
bears his name and a real estate consultant with more than 30 years of 
experience. For example, respondents stated a preference for homes with raised 
molding detailing on the ceiling, and they voiced a strong desire for 
old-fashioned front porches. 
</P>
<P>
"When television came into the home years ago, it made the front porch 
unnecessary in the minds of many builders," Goodkin said. "Now, it might be 
time to bring it back." 
</P>
<P>
Consumer research, like that conducted for Signal Landmark, is just one type of 
service provided by the estimated 150 independent real estate consultants 
working in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
They offer help with a variety of architectural, design, pricing, zoning and 
marketing questions -- although not necessarily all on a single project. 
</P>
<P>
And, in the process, the consultants help determine what consumers will wind up 
with in a new home, and at what cost. 
</P>
<P>
The real estate consulting business started in the middle to late 1950s, on the 
heels of the postwar housing boom. For the decade or so up to then, developers 
didn't have to worry about market research -- they were too busy satisfying 
pent-up demand for houses. 
</P>
<P>
"But in the mid-'50s, builders faced their first period of oversaturation," 
said Goodkin, who started in the field in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
Consultants provide expert assistance for smaller clients who lack their own 
research staffs, and they render an independent second opinion to large 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, consultants confirm what you already know; at other times, they 
give you new insights," said Stefan Markowitz, president of Barratt Irvine, a 
residential builder that regularly uses two outside consultants besides its own 
in-house analysts. 
</P>
<P>
The advice isn't cheap. A three- to 10-page report on a specific project 
question might run $3,000 or more, while a several-months study that includes 
consumer surveys could cost more than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
The larger, more established consulting firms routinely charge anywhere from 
$75 to $225 an hour and up, depending on the job and the expertise required. 
Alfred Gobar, a nationally known consultant based in Brea, said he sometimes 
charges as much as $500 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
That might seem like exorbitant prices to pay for somebody's opinion, but it's 
relatively small potatoes compared to the many millions of dollars that 
residential builders routinely risk in a project. 
</P>
<P>
"A developer might spend $750,000 on an architect, $50,000 to decorate the 
sales office and another $30,000 on sales brochures," said Eric C. Brown, a 
vice president at the Meyers Group, a research and consulting firm based in 
Encino. 
</P>
<P>
"By comparison, it doesn't seem too much to spend $5,000 or $10,000 to see if 
the project will sell." 
</P>
<P>
Developers who don't conduct the necessary market research could wind up 
building incorrectly priced homes with unpopular features in saturated areas. 
</P>
<P>
Marta Borsanyi, partner in the Newport Beach office of consultants Robert 
Charles Lesser &amp; Co., pointed to a Rancho Cucamonga development known as 
Marlborough Villas as an example. 
</P>
<P>
The project proved popular with buyers when it debuted in the early- to 
mid-1980s. Rival companies hastened to duplicate the success of Marlborough 
Villas without first analyzing which factors buyers found most appealing 
</P>
<P>
Sales lagged at some of these other developments, at least in part because the 
builders didn't understand the public's preferences, Borsanyi said. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, some of the builders altered the Marlborough Villas floor plan, 
which had appealed to a broad range of buyers, while retaining such features as 
a semi-private courtyard between the common greenbelt and the actual living 
area. 
</P>
<P>
"The front courtyard was a Marlborough Villas weakness, because people 
considered it unusable space," Borsanyi recalled. "But it was copied anyway." 
</P>
<P>
As another example, Borsanyi cited the "conversation pit" -- a sunken part of 
the living room in front of the fireplace that builders routinely incorporated 
into expensive houses during the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"People didn't want these rooms but they got them," she said. "Builders copied 
one another without asking the buyers." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, builders devise expensive plans based on little more than rumors, 
tips and hunches. And sometimes, consultants must douse these dreams with a 
shower of cold, hard facts. 
</P>
<P>
For example, consultants say some developers have heard of the 
disproportionately large amount of money on deposit in banks and savings and 
loans in Hemet, and they conclude that the Riverside County town must be ready 
for a lot of new, expensive homes. 
</P>
<P>
But consultants point out that the money is on deposit -- it's not being spent. 
And they add that there's no proof that the cash belongs to local folks who 
would desire larger homes in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Builders generally don't like to cancel plans for a project just because a 
consultant says it won't fly. But most listen to the advice because they 
realize that land in Southern California is too expensive for them to hit and 
miss. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no minor mistakes here," Goodkin said. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, Gobar persuaded a client not to build a seniors-only housing 
development in the Riverside County town of Perris because of low perceived 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
"The client was angry, but he eventually agreed to sell the property and plans 
to somebody else," Gobar said. 
</P>
<P>
The project eventually was completed, and Gobar monitored it for a while 
thereafter: Units were being sold at a rate of 1.4 a week -- a level that he 
and the original client considered insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, Gobar had conducted a feasibility study, a common type of job in 
which consultants are asked to evaluate whether a proposed development makes 
financial sense. 
</P>
<P>
Feasibility studies can easily become comprehensive and detail-oriented, but 
they all revolve around a central concern: 
</P>
<P>
"A client will want to know if he can sell a certain number of units at the 
price he wants -- we analyze that question," said S. Kelly McDermott, formerly 
vice president at Market Profiles, a consulting and research firm based in 
Costa Mesa, and now head of her own consulting company, Common Ground. 
</P>
<P>
A builder who wanted to buy a parcel of land and build homes in Victorville 
recently asked McDermott what she thought of the plan. She recommended against 
the transaction, based on the economics of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"The price for the land would require that he price the houses too high," she 
explained. "He would be competing with (San Fernando) Valley prices." 
</P>
<P>
But even consultants who study the local real estate market for a living, admit 
they don't always know what the future will bring on the crucial pricing 
question. 
</P>
<P>
"I often recommend that a builder open a small phase first and see what 
happens," McDermott said. "If they can't sell two units a week, they had better 
not raise prices." 
</P>
<P>
Smaller builders often hire consultants to evaluate a proposed project to 
secure a building loan. Retailers will want to know where homes are selling, so 
they can plan new store outlets. And lenders will contact consultants for help 
in assessing population growth and economic strength in areas where they're 
loaning money. 
</P>
<P>
In troubled real estate markets, such as Phoenix, banks or savings and loans 
sometimes find themselves taking control of foreclosed homes. 
</P>
<P>
"The lender will want to know how to dispose of the property," Brown said. 
Enter a consultant, who will conduct a "highest and best use" study. This 
analysis helps the lender determine what to do with the property -- sell it, 
redesign it, rezone it or take some other action. 
</P>
<P>
Some researchers, including Market Profiles and the Meyers Group, do more than 
just evaluate specific projects. They also collect reams of data on new real 
estate developments and sell that information to builders, mortgage lenders, 
retailer -- and other consultants. 
</P>
<P>
They find the number of residential units going into a project, along with room 
configurations, square footage, prices and other data. They tap a variety of 
sources, including builders, brokers, leasing agents and local government 
planning departments. 
</P>
<P>
Some researchers, such as Gobar, collect information from the federal 
government in the form of building permits, census reports and the like. 
</P>
<P>
The Meyers Group publishes three types of real estate reports for subscribers 
and markets some of this information in the form of an on-line computer 
database. 
</P>
<P>
The company also has a map division, which features custom-made aerial photos 
showing existing construction and upcoming development in an area. The 
5-year-old company now has about 60 employees, including six who collect data 
full time. 
</P>
<P>
The Goodkin Real Estate Consulting Group, numbers about 100 employees in the 
United States and also does work in Britain, Japan and other foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1987, Goodkin linked up with accounting firm Peat Marwick Main &amp; 
Co., in part to tap into the latter's resources and client contacts. Most large 
accounting firms now have a real estate consulting division. 
</P>
<P>
On the other end of the scale, some consultants run one- or two-person 
operations, perhaps enlisting the aid of a secretary or clerk. They can 
sometimes offer more personalized service at a lower cost than their larger 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
The Meyers Group estimated that there are as many as 150 real estate 
consultants, including accounting firms, working in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
There are no qualifying exams or required educational prerequisites to enter 
the consulting field, so people bring different types of backgrounds to the 
business. At Market Profiles, key employees have college degrees in subjects as 
diverse as art, psychology, finance, economics, philosophy, sociology and 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Consultants must be able to piece together bits of information to spot trends 
in the big picture. "You need good pattern recognition," McDermott said. 
</P>
<P>
Consultants tend to find themselves in greater demand when the housing market 
softens. Residential sales have tapered off and prices aren't rising at the 
torrid rate of 1988 and early '89. Consultants foresee a busy period ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the last couple of years, when everything sold well, developers felt they 
haven't needed us as much," McDermott said. "Now that's changing."

SAM HALL KAPLAN: WELCOME MATS OUT FOR NEW COURTYARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SAM HALL KAPLAN

<TEXT>
<P>
Courtyard housing, which served Southern California so well in its early 
development, is being rediscovered. 
</P>
<P>
The hope is that courtyard housing will be an alternative to the overscaled, 
ticky-tacky shoebox-like apartments and condo projects that are defacing many 
neighborhoods these days. 
</P>
<P>
The courtyard concept calls for the clustering of sensitively scaled attached 
houses, townhomes or apartments around a well landscaped common open space, 
lending the development a distinct and pleasant identity. 
</P>
<P>
Design guidelines encouraging courtyard housing were adopted recently by West 
Hollywood in recognition of the fact that "it is as important to regulate the 
quality of spaces created by and between buildings as the buildings 
themselves," said Mark Winogrond, the city's director of community development. 
</P>
<P>
He adds: 
</P>
<P>
"While modern architects and developers have shown that it is indeed possible 
to design a courtyard that is dreary and inhuman, at its best a courtyard 
reflects people's fondness for the California climate, for the outdoors, and 
fosters a sense of community while providing a sense of protection and oasis 
within a larger urban context," 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Pasadena approved an imaginative package of zoning ordinances that 
shift the focus of its multifamily residential plan reviews from "hardscaping" 
to accommodate the automobile to "softscaping" to enhance the ambience of the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to emphasize the garden character that graces our streets and 
distinguishes our city," said Pasadena landscape architect Phoebe Wall, one of 
the authors of a landmark study that was the basis for the ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
Similar ordinances also were implemented by Santa Monica for its Ocean Park 
neighborhood, with the result that some distinctive new apartment complexes 
have been built there. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly praised has been the bungalow-styled Ocean Park cooperative 
consisting of 43 units on five sites, designed by the firm of Appleton Mechur 
&amp; Associates. 
</P>
<P>
The encouragement of the courtyard concept through design guidelines also is 
being explored by a host of other cities, including Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Courtyards were first developed in Southern California nearly 100 years ago in 
the form of modest bungalows to provide inexpensive housing for the waves of 
newcomers settling here and others who vacationed here. With front porches and 
common areas encouraging mingling, the courts became, in effect, small, 
friendly neighborhoods in an increasingly anonymous city. Some still persevere. 
</P>
<P>
But more common these days is the "ding bat" or "shoe box" multiunit structure, 
filling up a lot with a long, narrow building sitting awkwardly on a raised 
parking garage. What setbacks are required usually do not provide any usable 
open space, other than a place to store trash cans, nor do they tend to prevent 
the building from shading adjoining buildings and back yards 
</P>
<P>
"'Most of them are just out of scale and out of place, and not very 
neighborly," comments Matthew Marchand of Highland Park, where in the last few 
years dozens of such complexes have risen. Marchand is a member of the Highland 
Park Revitalization Project that is urging the city to enact stricter urban 
design guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Why so many of the projects are objectionable is not as much an issue of 
density as it is of design, declare both opposing developer and community 
representatives, and the planners and architects in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that Southern California needs more comfortable and convenient 
housing, nearer to jobs. But the housing must work for the neighborhoods it is 
to be located in, as well as for the people who will live in it. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is developers milking the sites for every last square buildable 
inch and 'schlock' architects who repeat plans regardless of the orientation of 
the site, the context, and area," observed Deborah Murphy, who reviewed 
hundreds of such projects in the Los Angeles City Planning Department before 
recently being appointed an aide to Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
Architects have contended in defense of designs that a part of the problem is 
the city's building and safety requirement of semi-subterranean parking. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to sink the parking lower, bring the buildings more into scale, 
but the parking requirements are, in a word, unreasonable," says an architect. 
"The result is that instead of lawns and flowers, there are driveways and 
grills." 
</P>
<P>
"You feel you are walking past jails, not houses," observed Sandy Brown, a 
Westwood activist who fought against the overdevelopment of North Westwood 
Village. 
</P>
<P>
"There was density there, but it was set back behind trees, with the parking in 
garages in the rear. Now we have cell blocks."

"Growth is happening. The challenge is to shape it to work for a neighborhood 
rather than against it," said Johannes Van Tilburg, whose architecture firm 
specializes in the design of multiunit developments. 
</P>
<P>
Van Tilburg's design of the four-story, 60 unit Marabella Apartments at 600 S. 
Detroit St. -- replacing two traditional low-rise fourplexes -- drew strong 
protests by local residents, while his design of the Venice Renaissance, an 
89-apartment complex on Main Street, has been widely praised. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, changes encouraging the courtyard concept do not guarantee better, 
more neighborhood-friendly projects. Design guidelines generally tend to 
mandate mediocrity, not excellence, with such projects as in Ocean Park the 
exception, not the rule. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there is the hope that the resurgence of the courtyard concept can make 
a difference.

SUPPORT FOR LICENSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A "Speaking Out" column (April 15) featured Vernon Martin, an appraiser for a 
major financial institution, questioning the value of pending legislation that 
would license and/or certify real estate appraisers. The appraisal profession 
is unique in that until now, there have been no requirements for entry into the 
profession. 
</P>
<P>
A number of appraisal organizations exist, some more reputable than others, but 
membership is purely voluntary. The most recognized and prestigious appraisal 
organizations represent only a small fraction of practicing appraisers. 
</P>
<P>
With this in mind, I can't imagine why anyone in the industry would oppose 
licensing-certification of real estate appraisers. Not only is state licensing 
required by Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and 
Enforcement Act of 1989 (S&amp;L bail-out), but will also regulate the 
activities of the large number of practicing appraisers who are not affiliated 
with any recognized appraisal organization. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Martin believes that legal action against errant appraisers is a better 
solution, apparently not realizing the cost of such litigation; who needs more 
lawsuits anyway? Is fear of legal action any greater deterrent to appraisal 
abuse than the possible loss of license and livelihood? I think not. 
</P>
<P>
The writer's fear that licensing will be administered by the Department of Real 
Estate is also unfounded. This is contrary to the intent of the federal 
legislation, noting that both licensing bills under consideration in the 
California Legislature (AB 527 and SB 2380) propose regulation of appraisers 
within the Business, Transportation and Housing Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Licensing of real estate appraisers isn't a panacea. But with proper 
enforcement, it is better than the current system, which allows unqualified 
and/or dishonest appraisers to do their thing with little fear of retribution.

We reside in Arbol Verde in one of the houses owned by Claremont McKenna 
College, and we believe that Kaplan's comments in no way describe accurately 
the current situation 
</P>
<P>
In our view, the houses owned by the college are the best maintained in the 
entire neighborhood. Residents have known about the college's plans for its 
property for at least three years. 
</P>
<P>
Is this not ample notice for any landlord to give its tenants? 
</P>
<P>
Of much greater concern to us and to dozens of other Arbol Verde residents is 
the "destabilization" of the neighborhood caused by gang activity centered at 
one of the few houses not owned by Claremont McKenna College. Drive-by 
shootings have now resulted in injuries and a death; thus far the only 
responsible concern that has been shown has been initiated by Claremont McKenna 
College.

ABOUT REAL ESTATE: LEASE-OPTION MAY HELP SELL HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENNY L. KASS, Kass is a Washington lawyer and newspaper columnist 
specializing in real estate and tax matters. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: We are trying to sell our house and are having difficulties finding 
qualified or interested buyers. Recently, we received a contract that meets our 
price but contains language to the effect that the purchasers will lease our 
house for a period of up to two years with an option to purchase at the end of 
that period. Can you discuss this kind of transaction? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: With home sales lagging in today's marketplace, we are seeing a revival 
of the so-called "creative financing" techniques that were so popular in the 
early 1980s, when real estate sales were also slow. 
</P>
<P>
Sellers are willing to experiment with any legal avenue to give them an 
opportunity to sell their house. 
</P>
<P>
One such creative method is a lease with an option to purchase. This is a 
legitimate real estate transaction. Basically, under the arrangement you have 
discussed, your purchasers will move into your property, will be tenants for a 
period of time, and some time within the next two years may buy your house. 
</P>
<P>
First, you must recognize that if your purchasers buy, you may be selling your 
house as late as two years from now, but at today's prices. Although I am not a 
fortune teller, and am troubled about the future of mortgage-interest rates, I 
remain confident that the price of real estate in the metropolitan area will 
continue to increase. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, even before considering some of the legal protections needed in an option 
to purchase, you should consider the economic potential of this transaction. 
You might want to provide an escalation clause, so that the price will go up 
periodically depending on when the sale takes place. 
</P>
<P>
A second consideration goes to the status of your existing mortgage. I suspect 
that your purchaser is attempting to gamble that rates will go down within the 
next two years, and your purchaser will have an opportunity to select the best 
time to go into escrow. However, you should analyze your own mortgage document 
(the deed of trust on your present house). 
</P>
<P>
The standard form instrument specifically states that if such a lease contains 
an option to purchase, the lender reserves the right to call the entire 
mortgage due and payable. This may trigger the so-called "due on sale" clause, 
which has been the subject of much litigation and comment throughout the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Before signing the contract with your prospective purchaser, discuss this 
matter with your present lender to assure yourself that the lender will not 
accelerate the payments and create difficulties for you during the lease option 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, you should explore the taxable consequences of such a transaction. If 
you are selling the house in which you live (for tax purposes called the 
principal residence) the Internal Revenue Service will permit you to defer the 
profit you will make on the sale of your house if within 24 months of the sale, 
you purchase another principal residence equal to or greater than the selling 
price of your present home. 
</P>
<P>
If you plan to purchase another house within the next 24 months, and if your 
purchaser does not exercise the option to purchase until after that time, you 
may be hit with a substantial tax on the profit on the sale of your house. You 
must carefully review this situation with your tax adviser before you sign the 
lease-option contract. 
</P>
<P>
If, after giving consideration to these matters, you still want to go through 
with the lease-option arrangement, here are some suggestions to protect your 
interest: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The purchaser should be required to give a substantial deposit now. If the 
purchaser decides to walk away from the deal within the next two years, the 
deposit should be forfeited in your favor. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Draw up a document that will look like a standard landlord-tenant lease. 
Work out the details of the transaction now, before your purchasers move into 
the property. For example, who will pay the utilities and the real estate 
taxes? If your tenants pay the taxes, what guarantee do you have that the 
payments are made -- and made timely? 
</P>
<P>
 -- The contract must also reflect that at the actual settlement, the 
purchasers will take the property in an "as is" condition. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, you do not want to guarantee the plumbing, structure or any 
other condition of the house when the settlement takes place -- which can be as 
late as two years from now. After all, your purchasers will be occupying the 
property, and you do not want to guarantee against their own living style. 
</P>
<P>
What happens if your purchasers decide not to go through with the transaction? 
This is a very delicate area for discussion, but must be spelled out, in 
writing, before you allow your purchasers to move in. After all, an option to 
purchase is not a guarantee that the purchasers will in fact buy. It is not a 
binding purchase and sale contract. 
</P>
<P>
The appropriate landlord-tenant laws of your jurisdiction should be explored, 
and appropriate safeguards spelled out in the basic arrangements. 
</P>

DESIGN SOLUTIONS: 1990S COLORS: NOT JUST A MATTER OF TRENDINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I've read articles about color forecasts for decorating. Does someone 
really decide what's going to be in? Who decides this, why is this done and 
what are the colors I'm supposed to like in the 1990s? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Color Assn. of the United States (CAUS) and Color Marketing Group (CMG) 
are two of the organizations that forecast colors. Color forecasts are not 
simple, trendy decisions made to hasten the obsolescence of clothes, products 
or furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
These predictions are the result of extensive research into consumer attitudes, 
political and economical climates, cultural events and current market trends. 
Experts in color marketing, merchandising and design professions research these 
trends and predict how they will influence color preferences. 
</P>
<P>
High costs for product development necessitate that industries use color 
palettes that consumers are more likely to buy. As our world shrinks and 
borders are opened, there is a need to create palettes that appeal to more 
nations and cultures. As a result of color forecasting, industries can 
color-coordinate differing products. For example, new fabrics will match new 
carpeting, and bathtubs and sinks will be made in the same colors. Imagine 
trying to find a match if there was no industry coordination as to color choice 
or selection. 
</P>
<P>
Color organizations are already beginning to focus on palettes for 1992-93. 
Palettes fall into three categories -- established, ascending and forecast 
colors. Established colors are the safer, traditional colors used previously. 
Ascending colors are based on the established colors but with some changes 
(lighter or darker). Forecast colors are the predictions of new color 
preferences. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore each forecast has "something for everyone" and varying color ranges 
appropriate for different types of products. Because three categories exist in 
each year's palette, color trends will not be too drastic from year to year, 
especially for major product investments. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 color palette by the Color Assn. uses richer, more saturated colors. 
The brighter colors, from previous forecasts (recommended as accents) will now 
emerge as major colors. Purer green, blue, yellow and purple will probably 
appear in less frequently used parts of the home. The 1990 reds are 
"blue-based" reds similar to burgundy. 
</P>
<P>
There is a range of "muddier" yellow-based greens (avocado), gold and rust. The 
neutrals are beige, tans, off-whites and browns with only a few remaining gray 
tones. Black is still a dramatic accent. The names of these new colors 
definitely reflect our changing cultural and international awareness, such as 
Kenya Green, Ming Green, Osaka Tan, Hokkaido White, El Greco Brown, Blue 
Strasbourg and New Delhi Blue.

Getting Started on New Look for Home 
</P>
<P>
Q: How do I know where to start improving my environment? I want to make it 
look better but I don't know how to. What should I do first? 
</P>
<P>
A: The first step is to determine the feeling that you are most comfortable 
with. A marvelous vehicle for discovering what your personal "better" may be, 
are the myriad decorating magazines on the market. 
</P>
<P>
Buy a stack, tear out photos of rooms that appeal to you, rooms that you can 
visualize yourself or your family living in. Don't deny yourself anything in 
this phase. Fantasy has no budget and, should you utlimately hire a designer, 
an imaginative, resourceful one can achieve the look that you want within your 
financial limits. Keep in mind the structure of your home and your lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
When traveling or visiting friends whose homes you like, snap a shot of a whole 
room or a detail that particularly pleases you. It could be a molding, a vase, 
a rug, windows, doors, a skylight or stairway or a combination of things that 
appeal to you. 
</P>
<P>
As your collection of bits and pieces grows, a definite pattern will emerge. Be 
aware of colors that trigger a good feeling. Pick up paint chips, tack them on 
the wall and live with them for awhile. Notice the predominant colors that are 
in your wardrobe. Are these the colors you could surround yourself with? 
</P>
<P>
Your file should be bulging in no time at all, and you'll be anxious to begin 
the adventure of improving your environment.

Don't Delay Decision on Floor Coverings 
</P>
<P>
Q: When redoing a room from scratch, at what point do you choose the floor 
covering? 
</P>
<P>
A: It is essential to decide on all floor coverings at the same time that any 
architectural changes are being considered. Changes such as removing a wall, 
adding a fireplace hearth, installing new doors, adding a room or redoing a 
kitchen and bath are important considerations in reaching a decision on the 
type of floor covering to use. 
</P>
<P>
In as much as the finished product is only as good as the subfloor it is 
covering, any problems with the subfloor will affect the finished floor. As an 
example, moisture problems or irregularities will arise if the sub-floor is not 
treated properly at the onset of construction or remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
In using marble, wood, tile, vinyl or broadloom, you must be aware of traffic 
patterns and noise so that you can determine whether the material you have 
selected is practical for your situation.

Seeks Alternatives for Hated Draperies 
</P>
<P>
Q: I hate draperies in the Southern California climate. What are some options 
that will still protect furnishings from all that sunlight? 
</P>
<P>
A: There are several ways to protect your furnishings from our bright 
California sun. 
</P>
<P>
The wide louver "plantation" shutters offer protection and a gracious ambience 
to any decor. Vertical blinds, both fabric and vinyl, are practical and present 
a clean contemporary look. Pleated soft shades come in a variety of colors -- 
some with aluminum backing to reflect the sun. They can be raised to any height 
like a miniblind, and when completely raised, will fit under any valance or top 
window dressing. 
</P>
<P>
Fabric draped over a heavy rod above the vertical or soft shade offers an 
alternative to valances and a softer look that works well in more traditional 
settings. 
</P>
<P>
For additional protection from strong sunlight, many companies offer a 
translucent window tinting in a variety of shades; however, choose carefully as 
these tints change the appearance of your fabric colors.

D. WIEDMANN, FORMER CAR EXECUTIVE, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Donald A. Wiedmann, a seaman turned realtor widely credited for making the 
California Assn. of Realtors a political powerhouse in Sacramento, has died at 
the age of 60. 
</P>
<P>
Wiedmann had been hospitalized and was undergoing treatment for cancer at a 
Westside hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Ohio, Wiedmann entered the real estate business in San Diego in 1960 
after a 10-year Navy stint. He was elected president of the California Assn. of 
Realtors in 1978, a largely ceremonial one-year position. 
</P>
<P>
But his political savvy and ability to foresee long-term changes in the real 
estate industry were soon recognized by realtors across the state, who soon 
named him executive vice president -- the most powerful job in the realty trade 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Wiedmann was one of the first housing experts to sense the growing role that 
politics -- from special-interest groups to environmental issues -- was having 
on the state's housing industry. 
</P>
<P>
Under his leadership, the trade group beefed up its lobbying staff in 
Sacramento and solidified a grass-roots network of realtors across the state 
who could be mobilized at a moment's notice to exert political pressure on 
local and state lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
He was a driving force in passage of dozens of bills that affect all California 
homeowners and real estate agents, including a 1987 law that requires home 
sellers to disclose defects in their homes to buyers and a 1981 law that 
requires veteran realtors to take "continuing education" courses before they 
can renew their licenses. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Wiedmann retired last June, California realtors represented about 
one-fifth of all the members of the National Assn. of Realtors -- the biggest 
trade group in the nation and a powerful political force in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Wiedmann leaves a brother, Gerald Wiedmann; two sisters, Lois Lowstuter and 
Ginny Schuster, and an aunt, Virginia Sabatinos. All reside in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
He was buried last Monday in Chula Vista at the El Camino Memorial Park. 
</P>
<P>
Contributions in Wiedmann's memory are being accepted by the Don Wiedmann 
Scholarship Fund, which aids college students interested in real estate 
studies. Checks should be made out to the fund and mailed to the California 
Assn. of Realtors, 525 S. Virgil Ave., Los Angeles, Calif. 90020.

GRAND OPENINGS: GATED COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hidden Hills Country Estates opens today in the west San Fernando Valley, with 
eight large houses on 1- to 4-acre lots. 
</P>
<P>
Developed by Continental Communities of Woodland Hills, the project -- the 
largest in the gate-guarded city of Hidden Hills -- will have 62 houses at 
build-out. The eight houses in the first phase have five to eight bedrooms, up 
to nine baths, 5,800 to nearly 10,000 square feet of living area and are priced 
from $2.3 million to about $4.5 million, according to Robert E. Zuckerman of 
Continental Communities. First move-ins are planned for June. 
</P>
<P>
The houses feature up to nine baths, dining rooms with butler's pantries, 
libraries, oak spiral staircases, master suites with fireplaces, sitting rooms 
and separate dressing room and, in most plans, a motor court and a 
porte-cochere. 
</P>
<P>
All 62 houses will border the community's riding trail system. Opening this 
summer as part of the development will be the Hidden Hills Country Estates 
equestrian center with a riding ring, an announcer's booth and a viewing area. 
</P>
<P>
The sales office is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at 24399 Burbank Blvd., 
Woodland Hills, reached from the Valley Circle Boulevard exit of the Ventura 
(101) Freeway.

BIG BROTHERS POINT WAY TO SUCCESS FOR 2 PREP STARS; 
</P>
<P>
TRACK: BANNING HURDLER TERRENCE CAMPBELL HAS THE BEST POSSIBLE ROLE MODEL. HIS 
BROTHER TONIE IS A THREE-TIME OLYMPIAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Terrence Campbell would sit in front of the television as a youngster and watch 
with envy as his older brother Tonie would win race after race in the hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, Terrence would rush out to the front lawn of the Campbell's 
house in Carson and set up a line of cardboard boxes. Then he would jump over 
each one in succession and imagine he was his brother on his way to another 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
The childhood fantasy would have to wait for years to become a reality, 
however, since Terrence didn't begin running the hurdles competitively until 
his sophomore year at Banning High. By then, Tonie was gearing up for an 
unprecedented third straight appearance in the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
Terrence, 18, is a senior at Banning and in no way the track equal of his 
brother. But then again, when Tonie was a senior at Banning in 1978, he was a 
skinny kid just hoping to hook on with any college team. 
</P>
<P>
Nearing his 30th birthday, Tonie has been ranked among the top 10 110-meter 
high hurdlers in the world for 11 straight years. He has been victorious at 
almost every large meet, and won a bronze medal in the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, 
South Korea. He is currently ranked third in the world, and is a solid bet to 
make the '92 Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
Terrence has the second-fastest times in the City Section this spring in both 
the 110-meter high hurdles (14.1 seconds) and 300-meter intermediate hurdles 
(39.5). He won both events Thursday in the Southern-Pacific Conference 
championships at Carson, beating rival Curtis Hawkins of Carson in each race. 
</P>
<P>
Terrence, eyeing his first City and state titles, considers Tonie his role 
model and looks to him for support. 
</P>
<P>
"Who would have ever thought (my success) would last this long?" laughed Tonie 
the other day in between a workout with Terrence at Banning. "When I first made 
the Olympic team in 1980, I felt on top of the world. I told myself if this was 
the end of my track career I wouldn't be upset because I never expected to get 
this far. Now many, many years later, I still feel the same. This has been the 
best roller-coaster ride of my life." 
</P>
<P>
And that ride has featured plenty of peaks and valleys, much the same course 
Terrence has taken in his young career. The Campbell brothers just never seem 
to take the easy road to success. 
</P>
<P>
Both experimented with a variety of sports and got late starts in track. Both 
have had their share of grade troubles in the classroom, resulting in lengthy 
periods of ineligibility. And there have been the other normal growing-up 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonie went through a period during his teen-age years where he was a little 
rebellious and wanted to do things his own way," said Albert Campbell, the 
boys' father. "He didn't really settle down until he started having some 
success in track and receiving a few pats on the back. 
</P>
<P>
"Terrence is a great kid with a lot of potential, but he just doesn't know what 
he wants to do with his life. All the potential in the world doesn't mean a 
thing if you don't do something with it." 
</P>
<P>
Tonie, who attended USC, nearly had his scholarship revoked after his freshman 
year in 1979 when he posted disappointing times on the track and disappointing 
grades in the classroom. He was academically ineligible his senior season and 
never returned to college. 
</P>
<P>
Terrence missed the first half of track season his sophomore year because of 
grade troubles, and voluntarily sat out the second half of last season to 
concentrate on his studies. 
</P>
<P>
But they have been able to overcome the obstacles through strong family support 
and their desire to compete. 
</P>
<P>
"If I do nothing else in high school track, I want to win City and state in the 
110 hurdles to show everybody that I am capable," said the 6-foot, 160-pound 
Terrence. "I've admired my brother's successes for a long time, and I want to 
make him proud with some championships of my own. It would really mean a lot." 
</P>
<P>
The clearest observation of the two at this point is that Terrence has been 
blessed with more natural athletic ability than Tonie, but he has yet to show 
the same dedication to succeed. Time, they both say, will tell all. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never wanted Terrence to feel like he had to fill my shoes," Tonie said. 
"When he decided to go out for track, I told him to try all the events. The 
fact that he ended up in the hurdles didn't have anything to do with my 
pressuring him. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can say, is that if he gets real serious about the sport, it's scary to 
think how far he might go. He definitely has a chance to be better than me." 
</P>
<P>
During high school, Tonie was anxiously looking for a sport to excel in so he 
could earn a college scholarship. He had played football and baseball his whole 
life, but at 5-10 and 145 pounds, he knew he was too small to enjoy a lengthy 
career in those sports. He went out for track as a sophomore and stumbled onto 
the hurdles because he said he was "too slow for the sprints, too weak for the 
long-distance races and hated field events." 
</P>
<P>
"I loved the hurdles right away because of my love for flying," Tonie said. 
"Going up over them made me feel like I was a pilot. It has always been a great 
feeling for me." 
</P>
<P>
He ran on the junior varsity as a sophomore and qualified for the City finals 
in the 70-yard high hurdles and 330-yard low hurdles. He moved up to the 
varsity as a junior and qualified for the state meet in the 120-yard highs. 
</P>
<P>
Tonie came into his own as a senior, dueling with his cousin Philip Johnson of 
Gardena to be the top hurdler in Southern California. The two went back and 
forth in victories in the high hurdles all season, but Johnson beat him in the 
City and state finals. Tonie set a personal-best time of 13.81 seconds that 
season, which still stands as the school record, although the race is now run 
in meters instead of yards. 
</P>
<P>
Although Tonie wasn't as well known as his cousin, USC took a chance and 
offered him a scholarship along with Johnson. His freshman year was a disaster 
-- he was the worst of the school's four hurdlers -- and Coach Ken Matsuda 
threatened to revoke his scholar 
</P>
<P>
ship if he didn't get his act together. 
</P>
<P>
"The summer between my freshman and sophomore years was the turning point in my 
life," Tonie said. "I really grew up. Coach Matsuda broke me mentally and 
physically and taught me a lot about life. I trained two times a day and really 
got in shape. I started to accept responsibility. I really wanted to keep my 
scholarship because if I lost it I was headed for a junior college and no 
opportunity to ever achieve all of my goals." 
</P>
<P>
After that summer, Tonie developed a close relationship with Matsuda, who has 
remained his coach to this day. And Tonie went from being the fourth-best 
hurdler on his own team to qualifying for the Olympics in the 110-high hurdles. 
He finished second in the Pac-10 championships and fourth in the NCAA finals. 
He finished third at the Olympic trials in Eugene, Ore., with a 13.44. He even 
made the Dean's List with a 3.72 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
The United States boycotted the 1980 Olympics in Moscow, which is still a sore 
spot with Tonie. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I could have earned a medal that year," he said. "It took me a long 
time to get over not having the chance to go. When you're 19 years old, it's 
hard to understand setbacks like that." 
</P>
<P>
Tonie was rated the top high hurdler in the country his junior year, but since 
USC was on probation for using an ineligible athlete, the Trojans weren't 
allowed to compete in the Pac-10 or NCAA championships. 
</P>
<P>
By this point, Tonie was a world-class athlete and outgrowing his college 
competition. He took a tough course load the fall semester of his senior year 
and was ruled ineligible for track after failing to carry the necessary 
grade-point average. Coach Matsuda redshirted him, but Tonie decided to call it 
quits and devote all his time to training. He has yet to earn a college degree. 
</P>
<P>
But his track career has been a glamorous one. In 1987, he was rated No. 2 in 
the world and has been No. 3 for three years running. Although he is considered 
an old man by track standards, his times continue to get better. He has run a 
13.42 already this year and will travel to several big meets around the world 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I said I was going to retire after the 1988 Olympics, and here I still am," 
said Tonie, who is now 6-3 and 170 pounds. "Now I figure I will retire after 
the '92 games. But knowing my track record, I'll probably still be around in 
'96." 
</P>
<P>
It is unlikely that Terrence will follow directly in his brother's footsteps. 
For starters, Terrence also plays football and earned a scholarship in that 
sport to Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Terrence played football his sophomore year at Banning, but sat out as a junior 
to concentrate on track. He went out for football again this year and played as 
a wide receiver. He admits that football is a game he's loved since he was a 
little kid. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't begin his track career until he was a sophomore, but after years of 
observing Tonie he felt he knew the sport long before he started. He always 
wanted to run the hurdles, he said, because the event is very graceful. 
</P>
<P>
His successes to date have been limited because he has sat out much of the past 
two years, but this season he has lost only one race in the 110 highs. His list 
of victories includes the prestigious Mt. SAC Invitational three weeks ago. And 
with Thursday's conference victories, he appears to be hitting his peak in time 
for the City finals, scheduled May 24 at Birmingham High. Preliminaries begin 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Terrence, who with 4.4-second speed in the 40-yard dash is considered quick, 
said his goal is to break his brother's school record. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I have the ability to do it," he said. "Everyone I know feels I can do 
it. I guess it's just up to me now to prove I can." 
</P>
<P>
Banning Coach Kem Stumpf has given him plenty of support, but the extra edge is 
being provided by Tonie. The elder brother has been spending many of his 
workouts with Terrence, helping him in any way he can. When he's not there, he 
gives Terrence his workout over the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't let our age difference fool you," Tonie said. "We're as close as two 
brothers can be. We help each other out and provide pointers. When Terrence 
notices I'm doing something wrong, I welcome his observations. And he looks to 
me for the same advice." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Matsuda, who has closely watched both track careers, said: "Terrence has 
all the tools to be a great one. We're all just waiting on pins and needles to 
see if he does anything with it. It's really in his hands."

Bryan and Patrick Ivie grew up on the beach, and for years dreamed of nothing 
more than becoming professional surfers. 
</P>
<P>
But as their bodies began shooting up and outgrowing their boards, they started 
looking for alternate means of entertainment. After experimenting with a 
variety of sports, they finally found a permanent home on the volleyball court. 
</P>
<P>
And what an accommodating home it has been. The Ivie brothers, born and raised 
in Manhattan Beach, have established themselves as two of the top players in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan, 21, is a junior at USC and a leading candidate for college's National 
Player of the Year honors. He also is a member of the U.S. National Team and a 
good bet to make the '92 Olympic Team. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick, 17, is a senior at Mira Costa High and one of the most sought-after 
prep players in the country. He recently committed to USC and hopes to be in 
the starting lineup with his brother next year. 
</P>
<P>
There are plenty of similarities between the brothers. Both are middle blockers 
leading their teams in kills. Both are tall. Bryan is 6-foot-7 and Patrick 6-5. 
And both play for winning teams. USC advanced to the NCAA Tournament this 
weekend in Fairfax, Va., and Mira Costa is undefeated and the No. 1-ranked prep 
team in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The two also have plenty of differences. Bryan is a late bloomer in the sport, 
taking up the game during his junior year of high school. Patrick is a finely 
tuned prep standout, with four years of intense training. Bryan is a calm, 
laid-back player, while Patrick is well known for his ranting and raving. 
</P>
<P>
"When Pat was younger, I think all of his screaming and yelling was a 
disadvantage," Bryan said. "I think it made him lose sight of what he was 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
"He's learned to control it, though. I think he's actually mellowed out a bit, 
while I've gotten a little more emotional." 
</P>
<P>
Bryan was so mellow in high school that during a summer tournament four years 
ago in Albuquerque, N.M., his coach pulled him out of the starting lineup for 
what he termed a lack of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick, on the other hand, was recently described by a teammate as a 
"scowl-faced killer." 
</P>
<P>
Emotional differences aside, the two know how to play volleyball and are 
effective masters of the net. Patrick has a team-high 110 kills and 68 blocks 
this season, and Bryan leads the Trojans with a staggering 659 kills and 111 
blocks. Bryan has appropriately adopted the nickname "Poison." 
</P>
<P>
Their rise to the top, so to speak, has been achieved in different manners. 
Bryan started late and was forced to learn the game quickly. Patrick started 
early and allowed plenty of time to sharpen his skills. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Bryan was an awkward freshman at Mira Costa looking for something to 
do. At 6-5, he said, he was too tall for surfing. He played defensive lineman 
on the freshman football team and center on the junior varsity basketball team, 
but didn't feel comfortable in either sport. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really going through some awkward growing periods," Bryan said. "I was 
uncoordinated at almost everything I was doing." 
</P>
<P>
During the fall semester of his junior year, Bryan met Mira Costa volleyball 
Coach Mike Cook in a driver's education class. Cook couldn't help but notice 
Bryan's size and encouraged him to try out for the volleyball team. Bryan took 
his advice and played middle blocker on the junior varsity squad that spring. 
</P>
<P>
"I went out because of my size," Bryan said. "I certainly didn't have the 
skills. I was very inexperienced. But I had fun out there, and really learned 
to like the game." 
</P>
<P>
Bryan joined the Torrance Volleyball Club that summer and played every day, 
furiously trying to make up for years of missed opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
By his senior season, Bryan was a starter and a mainstay for the highly 
regarded Mustangs. He had 115 kills and 96 blocks, leading Mira Costa to a 
runner-up finish to Newport Harbor in the Southern Section 4-A finals. 
</P>
<P>
Since Bryan was a relative unknown heading into the season, he received little 
college recruiting attention. When then-USC Coach Bob Yoder stopped by a match 
to watch the team, he was pleasantly surprised to find Bryan. 
</P>
<P>
"I was impressed with Bryan the minute I saw him," said Yoder, who retired last 
season after eight years at USC and one NCAA title to his credit. "He wasn't a 
great skilled player at the time, but he had great foot movement and unlimited 
potential. I was shocked to find out that no one was really actively recruiting 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Bryan signed with USC and has been a starter since his freshman season. In 
1988, he was selected Freshman of the Year on the college All-American team. 
Last year, he led the Trojans in blocks (162) and was selected a second-team 
All-American. He also made the U.S. National Team, and traveled to Puerto Rico, 
Sweden, Russia and throughout America last summer. 
</P>
<P>
This season, he asserted himself as one the country's top college players and 
was again selected to the national team. He is pictured on the cover of the USC 
volleyball program. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything that has happened to me seems like it has occurred earlier than 
it's supposed to," said Bryan, who is 6-7 and 220 pounds. "I haven't had a lot 
of time to comprehend all that's happened because I've been so busy playing." 
</P>
<P>
Those who have seen Bryan and Patrick play are eagerly waiting to see if the 
younger Ivie will be able to equal or surpass his brother's achievements. 
</P>
<P>
"I've watched Pat play all through high school," Yoder said, "and he's a far 
superior high school volleyball player than his brother was at this point. He 
is very fine-skilled and does some amazing things." 
</P>
<P>
Patrick followed his brother's lead into volleyball and began playing 
competitively as a freshman at Mira Costa. He joined the Torrance Volleyball 
Club in the summer of '87 and has been playing the game year-round since then. 
</P>
<P>
He initially also went out for the water polo and basketball teams at Mira 
Costa, but found they left him little time for volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been playing volleyball on the beach since I was a kid," Patrick said. 
"But when I started playing competitively in high school, I really started to 
love the game. I wanted to devote all of my time to it." 
</P>
<P>
Patrick played on the junior varsity his sophomore year, but has started on the 
varsity for Coach Cook the past two seasons. As a junior, he was All-Ocean 
League and All-CIF, helping lead Mira Costa to a runner-up finish in the 4-A 
playoffs to Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
This year's team may be the finest ever assembled at the school. The Mustangs, 
a traditional power in the sport, have three players in addition to Ivie who 
have received Division I scholarships: middle blocker Mike Ashenfelter (USC), 
setter Canyon Ceman (Stanford) and outside hitter David Swatik (UCLA). 
</P>
<P>
"I had a chance to watch my brother play when he was here, and that was a very 
neat feeling," Patrick said. "But I really want to win that CIF title for my 
brother because he never had a chance to. It would really mean a lot." 
</P>
<P>
The brothers get their height from their father, Floy Ivie, who is 6-6. Their 
mother, Ella, is just 5-2. David Ivie, the oldest of the family's three 
children, is 6-3 but never played competitive volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
"These are beach kids, so the fact that they ended up in volleyball isn't 
really a big surprise," Floy said. "But I am surprised how far they've gone 
with the game." 
</P>
<P>
USC first-year Coach Jim McLaughlin said signing Patrick was a major coup, and 
he figures the younger Ivie will have a legitimate chance at a starting job 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
"Patrick is probably the No. 1 overall player in high school because he can do 
so many things," said McLaughlin, who worked as an assistant at Pepperdine for 
four years before going to USC. "The thing I like about him is that he can 
block, pass and set, which makes him a very effective threat. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were recruiting him, I told him he will be a different player than his 
brother and that there wouldn't be the same expectations. Patrick will play a 
different position and contribute in other ways. What I really like about him, 
though, is his strong desire to win. He's incredibly competitive." 
</P>
<P>
Patrick, who at 6-5 and 195 pounds feels he may be done growing, will likely 
switch to outside hitter in college. He said he may be a little short for 
middle blocker. 
</P>
<P>
The opportunity to play together is appealing for Bryan and Patrick, since 
neither has played on an organized team at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
"During the recruiting period, I didn't pressure Patrick to come here at all," 
Bryan said. "I remained low-key and told him I wanted it to be his own 
decision. But I was hoping he would choose USC because I feel we can make a 
winning team. I'm really looking forward to helping and playing with him." 
</P>
<P>
The brothers say they have a close and open relationship, one with few fights 
and plenty of room for long talks. They regularly watch each other play and 
evaluate each other's performances. 
</P>
<P>
"My brother is very inspiring to me and helps me out whenever I ask him to," 
Patrick said. "My brother is a great player, and I wanted to go to USC because 
I wanted to be surrounded by the best. I still have a lot of learning to do." 
</P>
<P>
Said Bryan: "Patrick is a good high school player who is ready to take his game 
one step further. I hope we can both learn from each other."

I couldn't agree more with Mark C. Taylor's Endpapers article, "Love of 
Learning and the Celebration of the Learned" (Book Review, April 15). 
</P>
<P>
The norm in our society is to hail and exalt our athletes and movie stars while 
totally ignoring or berating our scholars and intellectuals. Whoever makes the 
most bucks receives the greatest adulation in our sick society. 
</P>

I suggest that we make National Library Week a national holiday so everyone 
will go to the library at least once a year.

RUTH REICHL'S TOP 40 RESTAURANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH REICHL, Ruth Reichl is the Los Angeles Times' food editor and 
restaurant critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EVERY TIME I FINISH WRITING A REVIEW OF A REALLY WONDERFUL RESTAURANT, I AM 
OVERwhelmed by a pair of conflicting emotions. The first is enormous excitement 
over a great discovery. The second is enormous sadness that I won't be going 
there again. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurant critics must move on. While you're dining at the latest discovery, 
I'm eating at the next new place. There aren't enough nights in the week -- or 
enough dollars in the expense account -- to allow me the luxury of going back 
to eat in a restaurant simply for the fun of it. 
</P>
<P>
That's why this assignment was such a pleasure. When I was asked to pick the 
Top 40 restaurants in the region, I immediately wrote a list of places I was 
eager to revisit. I came up with almost 100 restaurants, and during the past 
four months I ate in all of them. 
</P>
<P>
I had a terrific time. I also had some disappointing evenings. At dinner in one 
of Los Angeles' most revered restaurants, the waiter arrived at the table only 
to ask who got the chicken. This might not ordinarily offend me, but since the 
chicken in question cost $28, I thought he should know. Other lapses in service 
convinced me that, although the restaurant was good, it was not good enough. 
Another high-priced place had wonderful service but food so dull that had I 
been asked to spend my own money on the meal, I would have been incensed. I 
thought you would be, too; I left it off the final list (which is in no 
particular order). 
</P>
<P>
Also missing are some of the amazing places that have opened during the past 
few months. If the restaurant wasn't open when I began my research, it wasn't 
eligible for the Top 40. 
</P>
<P>
The Top 40 are special-occasion places. Most people can't afford to eat in them 
very often; I can't either. If you want to know where to find me most days, 
look at the recommendations that appear in the margins. These are the 
restaurants I go to again and again. As far as I'm concerned, it is the 
abundance of great, inexpensive ethnic restaurants that makes living in Los 
Angeles so exciting. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, if you find yourself convinced that I've missed a truly great 
restaurant, please drop me a card. I'm always ready to eat -- even if it's only 
my own words. 
</P>
<P>
CITRUS 
</P>
<P>
If you asked me where I want to eat, right this minute, I'd probably say 
Citrus. 
</P>
<P>
This is a restaurant with soul, because chef-owner Michel Richard truly loves 
his work. No chef enters a kitchen with greater joy -- and few chefs send such 
consistently satisfying food out of it. 
</P>
<P>
Richard's technique is French, but his years in Los Angeles show. This is light 
food with a sense of humor. Shrimp might come wrapped in strands of potato and 
deep-fried. Scallops float in a bit of stock with a banner of pink pasta 
floating across the top. Whitefish lounges on a bed of mashed potatoes wearing 
a sauce of chicken and shallots. Richard's years as the city's premier pastry 
chef show, too. Nobody makes more beautiful food. 
</P>
<P>
Can't decide what to eat? Don't despair. Simply ask the chef to make a meal and 
then sit back and wait for the fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
Are there problems with the restaurant? Of course. You may be kept waiting at 
the door. This casual room can become uncomfortably crowded, and the covered 
patio tends to be too hot or too cold. The chairs could be more comfortable. 
Still, it's hard to get grumpy when you can look up and watch Richard running 
around in his glass-enclosed kitchen having such a wonderful time. 
</P>
<P>
 6703 Melrose Ave.; (213) 857-0034. Entrees from $21 to $26. 
</P>
<P>
VALENTINO 
</P>
<P>
Many years ago, I went to lunch at Valentino and stayed for dinner. It's that 
kind of restaurant -- a place for languorous meals, lots of wine and romance. 
But afterward, when I told people how wonderful the restaurant was, they'd look 
at me knowingly and say, "But Piero Selvaggio knows you." And of course he 
does. 
</P>
<P>
So I sent a secretary in for dinner and waited to see what would happen. Her 
report? "I've never had a better meal -- or felt so well taken care of. Piero 
came up and asked us if we would like him to make a meal for us. He talked 
about what was in the kitchen, and together we devised a menu for the evening. 
It was heavenly; we started with little deep-fried cheese-stuffed zucchini 
blossoms, went on to deep-black squid risotto and then had loin of beef in 
balsamic vinegar. I asked him to choose the wines as well -- and they were 
fabulous. He made me feel like I was someone: I'm saving my pennies for the 
next meal there." 
</P>
<P>
And so am I. I go for the fried squid and ricotta fritters, the risotto (any 
risotto), the sweetbreads and mushrooms in Cabernet. I go for the pasta. I go 
for the wine (the wine list is L.A.'s biggest, and probably its best). In a 
town of few elegant, upscale, good restaurants, Valentino stands out. The 
restaurant was remodeled a couple of years ago, and now the city's best Italian 
food has a room that is worthy of it. 
</P>
<P>
 3115 Pico Blvd., Santa Monica; (213) 829-4313. Entrees from $17.50 to $26. 
</P>
<P>
KATSU 
</P>
<P>
When I first discovered sushi, eating it seemed like an amazingly mysterious 
ritual. The initiation rites included memorizing the names of the fish in 
Japanese, bribing the sushi chefs with big tips so they'd remember me on 
subsequent visits and ostentatiously demonstrating that I knew that the fish 
was supposed to be dipped into the soy sauce, not the rice. The other part of 
the ritual was learning not to jump when the sushi chefs shouted vociferous 
hellos. 
</P>
<P>
But one sushi bar was different. It was a quiet, beautiful room where the walls 
held the sort of art that makes you think (a Barofsky, a Mark Lere), and the 
sushi was served on trendy, handmade plates. And it was a place that 
demystified the process of eating sushi; behind the bar they spoke English, and 
at the table the waiter simply handed you a list of what was available and you 
checked off the fish you wanted to eat. 
</P>
<P>
There was one other thing that impressed me about this particular sushi bar. 
The sushi looked more beautiful than it did in other places, artfully arranged 
on those spectacular plates. And it tasted better, too; you always knew that 
everything you ate at Katsu would be wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
After all these years, you still do. 
</P>
<P>
 1972 N. Hillhurst Ave.; (213) 665-1891. Entrees from $7.50 to $16; sushi from 
$2.75 to $10. 
</P>
<P>
CITY 
</P>
<P>
When I met Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger 10 years ago, they were cooking 
in a kitchen so small that it could barely contain them both at the same time. 
They didn't mind: They were so excited by cooking that they acted as if the 
City Cafe was the most wonderful restaurant in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Now they've got an empire -- City Cafe became the Border Grill, they opened 
City restaurant and now there's a new Border Grill in Santa Monica -- but they 
still work with the same exuberance. Cooking is their passion. 
</P>
<P>
City is young, hip, spare, cool -- a huge barn of a room with the most 
eclectic, eccentric menu of any Los Angeles institution. The chefs are 
impeccably trained in French cooking, but they are equally interested in the 
cuisines of other countries: Susan goes to India every year to cook in a small 
village, and Mary Sue has cooked in Thailand. Together they spend time in 
Mexico researching food. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other chefs, however, they feel no need to put their own stamp on the 
dishes. Their Indian food -- great tandoori meats and breads, wonderful little 
fried appetizers -- are unadulterated. Their Thai melon salad is like a taste 
of Thailand. They make wonderful Korean ribs, great American hamburgers, a 
delicious reinvented beef Stroganoff. Their menu also has Greek touches 
(peppers with feta cheese), Japanese touches (sashimi) and an occasional 
Italian accent (terrific gnocchi). The desserts, however, are pure Americana: 
They even make their own version of Hostess cupcakes. 
</P>
<P>
 180 S. La Brea Ave.; (213) 938-2155. Entrees from $16.50 to $23. 
</P>
<P>
MANDARIN 
</P>
<P>
Cecilia Chiang, who started the first Mandarin in San Francisco in 1961 and 
opened the second in Beverly Hills in 1975, is a force of nature. During the 
1949 revolution, she walked out of China with gold sewn into the hems of her 
dresses. On a return trip a few years ago, she managed to drink 32 shots of 
cognac at one banquet without showing the slightest effect. She is one of those 
women who always looks gorgeous, says the right thing and seems to be having a 
better time than anybody else in the room. It is no wonder that her restaurants 
-- the first in California to serve Northern-style Chinese cooking -- for years 
have been the best places to eat Chinese food outside of Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
But last year Mrs. Chiang sold the Beverly Hills Mandarin to her son. To 
everyone's surprise, the restaurant actually improved. Philip Chiang injected 
energy into the restaurant, updating the room so that it is still elegant but 
now seems younger. He changed the menu, too, adding all sorts of wonderful 
little tidbits -- steamed dumplings, fried-onion pancakes, crepes wrapped 
around a chicken-and-vegetable mixture, glazed walnuts. You can nibble these 
little dishes at your leisure, then go on to superb Peking duck, an unusual 
braised lamb on a bed of spinach or whole steamed fish. And if you like, you 
can drink well while you eat; this is one of the few Chinese restaurants around 
that actually pays attention to the wine list. 
</P>
<P>
430 N. Camden Drive, Beverly Hills; 272-0267. Entrees from$6 to $34. 
</P>
<P>
CELESTINO 
</P>
<P>
Of all the little Italian restaurants in town, this is the one that most makes 
me feel that I'm eating in Italy. Locanda Veneta is like a Hollywood dream of a 
cozy trattoria. Angeli is a bit too hip, Pazzia a tad too fancy. But bright 
little Celestino, with its table of desserts plunked in the middle of the room 
and its waiters with their charming accents, makes you start looking for lira 
to pay the valet. 
</P>
<P>
The food doesn't do anything to dispel this illusion. I think the restaurant's 
two strengths are the rustic dishes -- such as malloreddus with sausage, tomato 
and pecorino cheese and a wonderful roasted rabbit in black olive sauce -- and 
its way with fish. Spaghetti with bottarga (a sort of dried caviar) is exotic; 
the restaurant's most famous dish is seafood cooked in a huge balloon of foil, 
and they work wonders when they simply throw a piece of fish on the grill. 
</P>
<P>
Desserts here are forgettable, but that's true to form: When was the last time 
you got a great dessert (other than fruit and cheese) in a small Italian 
trattoria? 
</P>
<P>
236 S. Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills; (213) 859-8601. Entrees from $17 to $21. 
</P>
<P>
CHAYA BRASSERIE 
</P>
<P>
Chaya's so hip that I never expect the personnel to be nice to me. The 
surprising thing is, they always are. 
</P>
<P>
Why go to Chaya? Because it is among the prettiest rooms in town, an improbable 
cross between a traditional Japanese inn, a French bistro and a New York 
singles bar. And because of the buzz that settles just beneath those high 
ceilings. At lunchtime, this is echt Hollywood -- the seats filled with agents 
and actors looking around to see who's there to see them. The same people show 
up for dinner, but they're harder to spot because at night they blend into a 
crowd of foodies, businessmen and tourists. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, you go because this is the city's most original blend of French, 
Italian and Japanese food. You can start with sashimi or seaweed salad, go on 
to escargots a la bourguignon, follow it up with fettuccine and have steak for 
a finale. Wash it down with a bottle from a truly exciting wine list (it's not 
big, but everything on it is good). And walk out the door with an understanding 
of what new Pacific cooking is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 8741 Alden Drive; (213) 859-8833. Entrees from $9.50 to $30. 
</P>
<P>
REBECCA'S 
</P>
<P>
This restaurant drives me crazy. I think it's the loudest room in town -- the 
sound assaults you; it can actually be a relief to walk out the door. And 
getting in the door isn't easy; you almost always find yourself standing around 
waiting for a table or trying to squeeze into a place at the bar. I am usually 
in a rage by the time I get a seat. 
</P>
<P>
And then I calm down: The food is worth the wait. The kitchen does almost 
everything right: It creates fresh seafood cocktails from just-opened shellfish 
and fresh juice, serves the lime-sprinkled corn chips hot from the fryer, uses 
great ingredients for the steak tostadas, the lobster enchiladas and chicken 
chilapitas. The French fries are fabulous, and the flan is a dream. This is 
Mexican food at its most uptown -- and it's absolutely terrific. 
</P>
<P>
The architecture is something, too. Designed by Frank Gehry, it's California 
goofy, with an alabaster private dining room floating over the bar and huge 
crocodiles dangling from the ceiling. Between the food and the room, Rebecca's 
is a diner's Disneyland, a roller-coaster ride that leaves you breathless and 
happy. 
</P>
<P>
2025 Pacific Ave., Venice; (213) 306-6266. Entrees from $14 to $22. 
</P>
<P>
SPAGO 
</P>
<P>
The thing to remember about Spago is that it's just a neighborhood restaurant 
for stars. While you wait (and you probably will wait), console yourself with 
unabashed people watching as the famous are led past you to their tables; and 
remind yourself that they are part of the reason you wanted to come here in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
Once you're finally seated, you'll feel fine. The food is consistently 
delicious, the service is good and the place simply rocks with good vibrations. 
Wolfgang Puck and Barbara Lazaroff manage to make you feel as if you are in the 
midst of a very fun party. 
</P>
<P>
What to eat? Personally, I think the famous designer pizzas are the 
least-interesting things on the menu. But Spago does serve the world's best 
chopped salad, incredibly good homemade salami and smoked salmon and a 
delightful array of pastas. Among the entrees, the Chinese duck is good, the 
lamb is wonderful and the roasted salmon with black pepper and Cabernet butter 
is a treat. If there are enough of you, ask for a combination plate for 
dessert. And don't be embarrassed to ask for a doggy bag; portions are not 
small, and even the stars sometimes walk out with leftovers. 
</P>
<P>
1114 Horn Ave., West Hollywood; (213) 652-4025. Entrees from $19.50 to $26.50. 
</P>
<P>
ST. ESTEPHE 
</P>
<P>
There is not another restaurant in the world quite like St. Estephe. It began 
as a very good little French restaurant under the aegis of classically trained 
chef John Sedlar. One day, Sedlar decided to go back to his New Mexican roots, 
exploring his own heritage of blue corn tortillas, tamales and chile peppers. 
He studied the art of his native region as well, turning out plates as lovely 
as sand paintings. 
</P>
<P>
When the dishes are successful -- as in carne adobada-stuffed ravioli served in 
a cream garlic chevre sauce, blue corn tortillas served with smoked salmon and 
American caviar, and lamb with chile, grapefruit zest and yucca root -- this 
food is a revelation. (When it is not, it seems downright silly. And some of 
the dishes are so small you have trouble finding them on the plate.) Desserts 
can be outstanding, too; don't miss Sedlar's version of crepes suzettes, which 
uses blue corn crepes and pumpkin ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant, in a shopping center, once looked like a typical little French 
place. A recent remodeling left it with the clean, easy lines of the Southwest. 
If you sit on the adobe patio on a sunny day, it's almost possible to imagine 
that you're in New Mexico and that the car revving up in the parking lot on the 
other side of the wall is actually a coyote starting to sing.

CHAMPAGNE 
</P>
<P>
See those people at the table in the corner, eating dinner with their little 
boy? It's probably proprietors Patrick and Sophie Healy sitting down to a meal 
with their son, Benoit. They almost always seem to be here -- which is one of 
the things that gives this restaurant a personal touch. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Healy is one of the best young chefs in town. Trained in France, he 
went to work at L.A.'s Le St. Germain. Two and a half years ago, when he opened 
his own restaurant, Healy decided to do things differently. Most chefs go out 
and find investors; Healy put his own money where your mouth is. The result is 
a kitchen that really cares. And you can taste it. 
</P>
<P>
The menu is divided among rustic French dishes (great cassoulet), contemporary 
California fare (crispy Norwegian salmon with leaf spinach and a black 
peppercorn sauce) and spa cuisine (the best eggplant soup you've ever eaten -- 
and only 150 calories). Big eaters will want to try the spectacular prix fixe 
menu. It's $68 a person -- and worth it. 
</P>
<P>
When Champagne first opened, the service was shaky and the wine was list a 
joke. But now the restaurant is aging well; both have grown up and gotten 
respectable.

THE GRILL 
</P>
<P>
Ever wonder why there aren't more older waiters in Los Angeles? I do -- every 
time I walk into The Grill and find myself being served -- beautifully -- by 
men who make waiting tables seem like a profession. They aren't hip, they don't 
tell you their names and they don't seem like they're about to rush off for 
auditions. They simply serve food with grace and dignity. 
</P>
<P>
That's one of the nice things about The Grill. Consistently fine, no-nonsense 
food is another. Eating here is not a great gourmet experience; there's nothing 
fancy or frilly about what they serve. But you know that you will always find 
great basic American fare: a spectacular Caesar salad, good shrimp Louis, fine 
grilled meats and fish, huge baskets of sourdough bread and, at lunchtime, one 
of the city's best burgers. 
</P>
<P>
You also know you'll always find an interesting mix of people. It's a power 
place: The guys huddled at the next table may be making a movie deal. It's a 
celebrity joint, too: You'll almost always see a famous face. But it's also a 
genuine family restaurant where you can bring your kid and not be embarrassed 
if he starts playing peekaboo with the couple in the booth across the way.

CHINOIS ON MAIN 
</P>
<P>
I have a special relationship with Chinois: While it was being built, I spent 
months on the site, writing about what it takes to open a restaurant. I hung 
around so much that everybody forgot that I was there. I watched Barbara 
Lazaroff charm inspectors, fight with workmen and come close to having a 
nervous breakdown when the glass for the bar was cut the wrong way. And I 
watched Wolfgang Puck experiment with the menu, creating a new kind of 
Chinese-French-California hybrid cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
Opening night was a hectic event: At 6 p.m. the painters were still painting, 
the electricians were still working and the cooks were on the verge of 
hysteria. At 7 there was still chaos. It seemed almost magical, but it all came 
together, and when the first guests walked in, they entered a serene fantasy of 
flowers and copper and chinoiserie. And they sat down to eat dishes like 
sauteed foie gras on pineapple in cinnamon sauce. They were charmed by duck, 
mushrooms and cilantro in Sichuan pancakes and amazed by "sashimi tempura." The 
restaurant's opening was an event; the place had an energy about it. To date, 
nobody has managed a successful imitation. Chinois is the restaurant that wrote 
the book on East-West cuisine.

TULIPE 
</P>
<P>
I wish Tulipe were a little less loud. It would be nice if the tables had a 
little more space between them, too. And if the lights were just low enough to 
give the room some romance, this would be the perfect little French restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, it's practically perfect. This is a wonderful modern bistro, serving 
true French food at its robust best -- fully flavored, gutsy, fun to eat. It is 
French food that, unlike much of what is served in town, has not been 
California-ized into something pretty, small and delicate. This is also, it 
must be added, French food that you can afford (a couple can easily get out the 
door for $50). 
</P>
<P>
My favorite dishes are the ones with the most intense flavors. A tart made of 
pears and Roquefort cheese. An occasional special appetizer made of pig's 
trotters and snails fashioned into a most elegant little dish (a friend said it 
was the best thing she'd ever tasted -- before she found out what it was). A 
whole lamb's shank. A pot-au-feu made of pigeon. Striped bass served in a 
sliced-potato coat. And be sure not to miss the city's best apple tart. 
</P>
<P>
There's one more wonderful thing about Tulipe: It has one of the nicest little 
wine lists in town, filled with interesting, moderately priced wines from small 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, if only the lights were a little bit lower. . . .

LOCANDA VENETA 
</P>
<P>
My husband tried to bribe me into not writing about Locanda Veneta. 
</P>
<P>
He argued that it was the perfect cozy little Italian restaurant with good food 
and reasonable prices that everybody in Los Angeles was dying to discover. 
</P>
<P>
He was right: The only way we've managed to get in since is by reserving a 
table weeks in advance. 
</P>
<P>
When we do go, we tend to order the same things. We start with a pile of fried 
whitebait with onion marmalade, homemade white cheese with prosciutto or 
insalata di radicchio. Then we have a simple pasta -- maybe just spaghetti with 
tomato and basil sauce. Occasionally we'll splurge on the Venetian seafood soup 
(chef Antonio Tommasi is from the Veneto) or a piece of grilled meat. 
</P>
<P>
And then, when we think about dessert, we look at all the people waiting for 
our table (the restaurant is really small) and decide to take pity on them and 
leave. Invariably, as we pay the bill, we wonder why more people don't open 
restaurants just like this one.

RUTH'S CHRIS STEAKHOUSE 
</P>
<P>
If you're American (and not vegetarian), you probably get a craving for steak 
every once in a while. 
</P>
<P>
When I do, this is where I come. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth's Chris (the name, if you need to know, came about when a woman named Ruth 
bought the Chris Steak House in New Orleans, added her own name and franchised 
the concept) looks the way a steak place should. Dark. Down-to-earth. Serious. 
</P>
<P>
The portions look the way they should, too. They're huge. Especially the 
porterhouse, which is big enough to serve 2, 3 or 4. That's the cut to have: 
I'm convinced that steak that comes to the table still attached to its bones 
tastes best. Besides, there is nothing quite as satisfying as gnawing on a bone 
at the end of a meal. Potatoes come in seven varieties, and all of them are 
good. So are the onion rings; grown men have been known to squabble over the 
last one left on the plate. 
</P>
<P>
The desserts here pay homage to New Orleans: If you are still able to eat when 
you come to the end of your steak, order the bread pudding with whiskey sauce. 
And then hum a few bars of the "Star Spangled Banner" as you stagger out the 
door.

THE IVY 
</P>
<P>
"I hate the place," said a friend one day. "They're always mean to me. The 
food's expensive. And it's not very good." 
</P>
<P>
"Want to have lunch at The Ivy?" I asked the next day. 
</P>
<P>
"What time?" she replied. 
</P>
<P>
The Ivy is the restaurant that everybody loves to hate. My files are groaning 
with letters from people complaining about how badly they've been treated and 
promising never to again darken the restaurant's door. And I'll bet that every 
one of the writers has gone back for more. 
</P>
<P>
There is something seductive about The Ivy. It's cozy and pretty, with the air 
of an inn in the south of France. It has a certain buzz, too. And in the end, 
the food is really very good. What it serves are new American classics -- great 
cracked-crab salad, big plates of pasta, lime-grilled chicken, crab cakes. It's 
a simple menu but a satisfying one. And after you've watched your weight and 
eaten something clean and fat-free for your main course, you can indulge in one 
of the delightful desserts. 
</P>
<P>
They might ask you to hurry up and drink your coffee (they've done it to me). 
You'll be momentarily annoyed. But you'll be back.

PATINA 
</P>
<P>
Of all the restaurants in Los Angeles, Patina is the one that would be least 
embarrassed if it woke up one morning and found itself in France. It is, 
despite its white walls, modern sconces and cool contemporary airs, an 
exceedingly proper restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
You sense this immediately; the service is absolutely comme il faut. Is your 
ice melting in your ice tea? The waiter will wordlessly replace it. Do you need 
more bread? Here's the busboy at your elbow. The glasses are so thin they seem 
to float into your hands, and the plates were made just for these tables. The 
cutlery is heavy, the napkins are, too, and the single stem on your table is 
absolutely elegant. 
</P>
<P>
As is the food: Joachim Splichal and his wife, Christine, have created a 
perfect setting for his state-of-the-art French cooking. Some of this food is 
inspired: Try the brilliant lasagna made of polenta, salmon and parsley. Don't 
miss the exquisite salade nicoise. The rare tuna with ponzu sauce is a 
wonderful dish, and the creme brulee with corn is so good you wonder why you've 
never eaten it before. 
</P>
<P>
As good as Patina is, the food here occasionally lacks elan. This is a 
restaurant to which I'd invariably send proper people who care deeply about 
both food and service. But for those who want to be thrilled by a meal (and who 
might not mind a little noise, a little wait), Citrus is the place.

TRUMPS 
</P>
<P>
When Trumps first opened, I thought it was Los Angeles gone mad -- all white, 
all concrete, all noise, all flash. And the menu seemed like something of a 
joke. Were they seriously intending to serve caviar on top of plantains and 
black beans? 
</P>
<P>
It soon became clear that Trumps would have the last laugh. The restaurant was 
extremely serious about everything, except those concrete seats. It dumped 
them, but not much else has changed. It is still modern, still white, still 
objectionably noisy. And the plantains and caviar are still on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
For good reason: They're delicious. So are all of Michael Roberts' seemingly 
outrageous combinations. Roast duck with black beans and pickled pumpkin? 
Superb. Chicken with candied lemon? An inspiration. Even the silly sounding 
Brie and grape quesadilla with sweet-pea guacamole turns out to be solidly 
delicious. 
</P>
<P>
Beware of Trumps imitations -- too many chefs without Roberts' skill have taken 
outrageousness to heart. It's a pity more don't follow another of his creative 
(and more easily cloned) leads: serving a wonderful afternoon tea.

MUSSO AND FRANK GRILL 
</P>
<P>
Nobody could call the food at Musso's great -- but to me this is still a great 
restaurant. Ask me if I want to eat there, and I'll always say yes. 
</P>
<P>
I love the way it looks. The front room is filled with people huddled 
comfortably in dark wooden booths. Along one wall runs a counter where men have 
earnest conversations as they watch a cook fling huge chunks of meat onto a 
charcoal grill. The back room is brighter and filled with people who look happy 
to be there. And everywhere, waiters scurry about, serving great martinis and 
pretty good prime rib (my usual choice) and sea bass and a lot of other things 
that you probably don't want to eat (like Welsh rabbit or creamed spinach that 
tastes mostly like nutmeg). 
</P>
<P>
I love the way Musso's feels, too. It's the sort of place where people waiting 
at the bar will turn and talk to one another. It hasn't changed much in 71 
years; it has always been a restaurant where people feel comfortable. Is it any 
wonder that this is the bar and grill that half the other restaurants in town 
wish they could be?

PAZZIA 
</P>
<P>
I know that the fact that I'm including Pazzia and not Mauro Vincenti's other 
place -- his big-deal downtown Rex -- is going to raise a lot of eyebrows. Rex 
is undoubtedly the most beautiful restaurant in Los Angeles. It has the most 
amazing tables, the most extraordinary silverware, the clearest crystal -- and, 
as far as I'm concerned, one of the least-interesting menus in town. Once I get 
past the first courses, I can never find anything I want to eat. 
</P>
<P>
Pazzia is different: At Pazzia I always want to eat everything on the menu. I 
never know whether to start with the pappa al pomodoro or that amazing salad of 
pears, Cacciota and walnuts. There's wonderful risotto. Terrific pizzas. And 
the pasta is always impeccable. 
</P>
<P>
I like the main courses as well: Something as simple as the lamb chops with 
thyme, artichoke and eggplant can make me perfectly happy. Give me some gelati 
to end the meal and I'm a happy woman. 
</P>
<P>
The place is pretty, too. It's not Rex -- but it's by far the most dignified 
and modern of the small Italian restaurants in town. So I'm sorry: If you want 
to go to Rex and spend hundreds of dollars, be my guest. I'll be far happier 
spending far less at Pazzia.

L'ERMITAGE 
</P>
<P>
Let's face it; when it comes to old-line fine French dining, Los Angeles is at 
a disadvantage. We simply don't have anything to equal the great elegant French 
restaurants of New York (Le Bernardin, Le Cirque and Lafayette come immediately 
to mind). If you want to dine on that level, you can choose L'Orangerie or 
L'Ermitage. L'Orangerie offers a gorgeous setting, but the last meal I had 
there was so disappointing -- amateur service, high prices and food that was 
little more than bistro cooking -- that I've narrowed the field to L'Ermitage. 
</P>
<P>
This is the last bastion of really correct French cooking in L.A. The kitchen 
has the personnel to do things right, and the service is both fond and 
solicitous. The room is so dark, muted and pleasant that it's a bit like dining 
beneath the sea. 
</P>
<P>
And the food is good; chef Michel Blanchet is a great technician. His food may 
lack the excitement and innovation of places like Patina, Citrus and Champagne, 
but you come here knowing exactly what you will find -- dishes such as truffle 
soup in the style of Paul Bocuse, a rather fussy saddle of rabbit stuffed with 
spinach and truly remarkable home-cured salmon. It makes you feel that French 
food has remained unchanged for centuries. But as the waiter rolls up with the 
huge glass cheese cart and slices off a ripe piece of Brie, it might suddenly 
occur to you that this is not such a bad thing.

KITAYAMA 
</P>
<P>
This is a restaurant built by the Japanese for the Japanese. At lunchtime it is 
filled with what must be the Japanese equivalent of ladies who lunch -- tables 
of women who all seem to be eating the same thing. At night it is filled with 
Japanese businessmen eating the rarefied and wonderful multicourse kaiseki 
dinners. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike many restaurants that the Japanese have created for themselves here 
in California, this is one where you feel totally welcome. It's a lovely, 
soothing, peaceful place where the waitresses wear kimonos and make you feel 
incredibly cared for. And the food is exquisite. The shumai alone -- 
ruffle-edge pyramids stuffed with the most astonishingly delicate crab meat 
filling -- are worth the trip. And the lunch of marinated black cod, which also 
comes with a bit of sashimi, pickles, steamed spinach and eggplant, a bowl of 
rice and miso soup, is probably the most delicious lunch in Orange County; at 
$7.50 it is certainly the most amazing value. 
</P>
<P>
In the evening, reject the rather pedestrian American menu and ask for the 
translation of the Japanese list. Better still, splurge and call ahead to order 
a kaiseki dinner.

72 MARKET ST. 
</P>
<P>
One reason why people come to 72 Market St. is to stare at the celebrities. And 
with Tony Bill, Dudley Moore and Liza Minnelli as owners, there are plenty of 
those. Some nights you'll even catch Moore at the piano in the back dining 
room. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason is that it is a swell-looking restaurant -- architecturally 
innovative and filled with good art by the likes of Robert Graham and Laddie 
John Dill. 
</P>
<P>
But the main reason is the food. Leonard Schwartz has turned out to be 
something of a culinary prophet, the first serious chef to spot the 
all-American trend and put meatloaf on his menu, along with chili and mashed 
potatoes. This is serious, delicious, intelligently conceived food. The 
shellfish from the oyster bar is fresh and fine. The salads are terrific. 
Entrees -- grilled veal chop with porcini and broiled polenta, charred tuna 
with olives, capers and lemon -- are simple and satisfying. The desserts are 
big, rich and American. During the day, it's a great place for a hamburger. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, 72 Market St. has turned into one of those well-run, 
consistently reliable restaurants that everybody is eager to get into. 
Sometimes we all remember that the owners are celebrities, but most of the time 
we forget.

MICHAEL'S 
</P>
<P>
Michael McCarty breezed on to the Los Angeles restaurant scene in 1979 like a 
brash whirlwind, stirring everything up. "I want to blow your socks off," said 
this then-25-year-old wonder, proceeding to do just that. His was a new kind of 
restaurant that ushered in the modern age of American cooking. Michael's was 
hip, modern, expensive and good. The food was French, but it was made with 
American products and cooked by young American chefs. It was an overnight 
success. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven years later, Michael's is no longer young, brash or innovative. (It's 
not as expensive either; prices were recently lowered by a third.) But it's 
still a reliable place to go for elegant food and good service in an atmosphere 
that has improved with age. The modern art collection gets better and better, 
and as the garden has grown, it has become Los Angeles' loveliest outdoor 
eating area. 
</P>
<P>
My favorite meal at Michael's is brunch -- the blueberry pancakes or the 
barbecue beef sandwich. At other times of the day, I'll eat pasta with seafood 
and Chardonnay cream sauce (a signature dish) for old times' sake. The specials 
are always the most interesting offerings, salads are a close second, and 
dishes such as sweetbreads with lemon, capers and parsley butter or grilled 
chicken with French fries are beautifully cooked. Come thirsty: The wine list 
is one of the finest in town.

CAMPANILE 
</P>
<P>
I could happily eat Campanile's earthy food every night. I'd start, perhaps, 
with the poached mozzarella. Or maybe I'd have the world's most delicious 
nicoise salad. And then I'd follow it with flattened chicken. Or fish soup. Or 
the boneless prime rib with white beans and greens -- a great piece of red 
meat. While I ate, I'd be scarfing down the bread (it comes from the La Brea 
Bakery, also brought to you by owners Mark Peel and Nancy Silverton). 
</P>
<P>
And then it would be time for dessert, and I'd be eager to try everything 
because Campanile has raised dessert to a new art. Silverton's desserts are 
food, not fluff, more flavorful than sweet and utterly delicious. 
</P>
<P>
The room's great, too: The office building once owned by Charlie Chaplin and 
his first wife has been turned into a neo-romantic fantasy that combines all 
the best elements of old and new. There's a fountain in the courtyard, there 
are vaulted arches, there are balconies; at the same time, there's an open 
kitchen and modern art. 
</P>
<P>
There's only one problem with this little fantasy: I'd have to spend all my 
time waiting. Everybody complains about this problem. Personally I think this 
is food worth waiting for, but if you demand a table instantly, plan to eat 
early or late.

LA TOQUE 
</P>
<P>
"When I own my own restaurant," Ken Frank said at the ripe old age of 23, "I'll 
start making a lot of money." He was then the head chef at Michael's. 
</P>
<P>
A few months later, he opened his own restaurant -- and found out how wrong 
he'd been. Ten years later, he has yet to make his fortune, but bad luck and 
hard work have honed the talent of this formerly brash young man and turned his 
restaurant into one of the town's most pleasant places to eat. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Frank is probably our most regularly underrated chef. And his restaurant -- 
one of the few places that is romantic, quiet and serves state-of-the-art food 
-- is too often overlooked. The food at La Toque -- French food with California 
accents and a little soupcon of Asia (Frank was an early worshiper at the sushi 
shrine) -- is innovative and delicious; for a real measure of his craft, try 
one of his degustation dinners at $55 per person. If you want to spend less, 
you can have a wonderful salad and a plate of pasta. People think of this as a 
fancy -- and expensive -- restaurant, but if you're careful you can eat well 
and reasonably.

<P>
MATSUHISA 
</P>
<P>
The Zagat guide rates Matsuhisa as having the best food in Los Angeles. That's 
one of the reasons I don't trust the guide. As much as I like Matsuhisa, I 
wouldn't put it that high on the list. (It also rates Magdalena's as having the 
next best food in Los Angeles; I took a few trips to Bellflower, and I did not 
agree. But that's another story.) 
</P>
<P>
Matsuhisa is an unadorned little place with just a few tables, a sushi bar and 
an ever-present line of people waiting for tidbits from Nobu Matsuhisa, a brave 
chef who has broken the rigid sushi code and actually started playing with the 
form. He uses garlic; he uses chiles; he uses truffles. The results of his 
experimentation can be fascinating. His great triumphs include a dish in which 
squid is scored to look like shell pasta, quickly cooked and served in a garlic 
and asparagus sauce. Toro, fatty tuna, is grilled like a steak in one 
spectacular presentation. Chilean sea bass is showered with sliced truffles in 
another. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that the restaurant encourages omakase dinners, in which the 
chef sends what he will to your table. Regulars seem to do well with this, but 
the last time I tried it I got the same sauce twice, some pretty dull dishes -- 
and an enormous bill to boot.

PASCAL 
</P>
<P>
When I first walked into Pascal, my heart sank. Stuck off in the corner of a 
shopping mall, it doesn't look like an impressive restaurant. And the menu, 
with its old-fashioned offerings (standbys like onion soup and chicken 
Provencal) was hardly encouraging. Then I noticed a French couple off in one 
corner having a serious discussion over an even more serious cheese plate. I 
noticed that the people at the next table were French, too. And I noticed that 
the salad they were eating looked pretty spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
Then chef Pascal Olhats walked out of the kitchen, and I knew this was the real 
thing. His eyes scanned the room, looking for problems. He walked from table to 
table, making suggestions, receiving compliments, offering advice. This is, in 
short, that good little French restaurant we're all always hoping to find. 
</P>
<P>
The food, with its emphasis on fresh herbs, fresh vegetables and olive oil, 
leans toward Provence; it is fragrant and remarkably light. Meals begin with a 
basket of crudites and go on to dishes such as crisp-skinned, free-range 
chicken on a bed of diced tomatoes or sea bass in a coating of herbs. And while 
you eat the sweet, thick lemon tart, you'll remember all your favorite places 
in the south of France.

TALESAI 
</P>
<P>
Right before I moved to Los Angeles, I spent a month in Thailand eating the 
best food of my life. It seemed almost impossible to get a bad meal there; I'd 
munch my way down the streets and through the markets, eating sticks of grilled 
meat and wonderful bowls of herb-laden noodles and curries so hot they set my 
mouth on fire. I ate sticky black rice with coconut and mangoes and raw crabs 
and fish that were grilled right on the beach. The only times I ever ate badly 
were when I walked into fancy restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
That's why Talesai is such a surprise. It's Los Angeles' fanciest Thai 
restaurant; it's also one of its best. 
</P>
<P>
The setting is charming, and the food is delicate and surprising. Try the 
Talesai special, a mixture of shrimp, peanuts and minced pork cooked in coconut 
milk that you scoop up with crisp rice crackers. Or naked shrimp, silky little 
morsels that wear nothing more than a clear sauce whose major notes are lime, 
chile and fish sauce. There's a great ginger duckling, the city's best pad Thai 
and cool coconut ice cream to end the meal. 
</P>

$15.95.

<P>
FENNEL 
</P>
<P>
It seemed like the silliest gimmick: Four chefs with restaurants in France 
decided to open a restaurant together in California. They made a deal with Air 
France making it economically feasible to come flying into town, a few weeks 
here, a few weeks there. It seemed like it would be total chaos. 
</P>
<P>
It's not; it is, instead, a restaurant that is constantly in touch with its 
roots. Chef Jean-Pierre Bosc is the glue that holds it together, the one who is 
always there. When the owners -- Michel Rostang, Yan Jacquot, Andre Genin and 
Michel Chabran -- show up, they bring a jolt of energy into the kitchen. And a 
lot of fresh ideas. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that in addition to the regular offerings -- dishes such as the 
wonderful rotisserie chicken served in two courses and the spectacular hot 
chocolate tart with pistachio sauce -- there is a constant parade of new 
dishes. If you want to know what's going on in France and can't afford the air 
fare, this is a good substitute. 
</P>
<P>
There are two drawbacks. The room itself is not totally charming: It is cool 
(both physically and visually), slightly cluttered and hardly a serene setting 
for a wonderful meal. And the prices on the wine list are ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
1535 Ocean Ave., Santa Monica; (213) 394-2079. Entrees from $20 to $24.

<P>
ROCKENWAGNER 
</P>
<P>
The first time I walked into this tiny restaurant, it was 3 weeks old and I was 
the only person in the place. That, it appeared, was an improvement. "Last 
night," the waiter confided, "not a single person came to dinner." 
</P>
<P>
Things have changed. These days, you need to reserve far ahead to get one of 
the 50 seats in Hans and Mary Rockenwagner's restaurant. And no wonder -- it's 
one of the few places that serves really fine modern French food at an 
affordable price. 
</P>
<P>
The best of the menu are Hans' signature dishes such as crab souffle with 
sliced papaya or a salad of baby lettuces and sauteed sweetbreads topped with 
an icy tomato sorbet. My favorite entree draws upon his German heritage, his 
French training and his California experience -- roast pork tenderloin rolled 
in cracked black pepper, topped with warm goat cheese and served with homemade 
spaetzle. 
</P>
<P>
But it is more than food that draws people to Rockenwagner. The restaurant is 
so small, the owners so young and appealing, that you end up feeling as if you 
are truly their guest. As you scoop up the last morsel of a wonderful hot apple 
tart, you can't help being glad that Rockenwagner survived its rocky 
beginnings. 
</P>
<P>
 1023 W. Washington Blvd., Venice; (213) 399-6504. Entrees from $16.50 to $22. 
</P>
<P>
TRATTORIA ANGELI 
</P>
<P>
When the original Angeli opened on Melrose Avenue, it was a great day for Los 
Angeles eaters. It was small, loud, modern, plain. But it served the sort of 
simple Italian food you'd actually find in a similar setting in Italy : 
fragrant pizzas with crisp crusts and real ingredients on the top, pasta 
without a lot of sauce, simply roasted chickens. At lunchtime, there were 
wonderful sandwiches, made with the restaurant's own bread, of roast pork loin 
or fresh ricotta cheese. It was all delicious and inexpensive, and it was so 
wildly successful that within months it had dozens of imitators. 
</P>
<P>
When Angeli opened a second restaurant, it did more than imitate itself -- it 
improved upon the original. The Trattoria is bigger, with a far more ambitious 
menu. (And, it should be mentioned, an incredible wine list.) In addition to 
the pizzas, pastas and antipasti, there are grilled fish, great fish soup, 
impressive desserts. It's still loud, still young, still filled with energy. 
But although its cutting-edge modern decor may make Angeli look like here, the 
food makes it taste like there. 11651 Santa Monica Blvd., West Los Angeles; 
(213) 478-1191. Entrees from $10.50 to $16.50. 
</P>
<P>
PARKWAY GRILL 
</P>
<P>
Would I put Parkway Grill on the list if it weren't in Pasadena? Probably not. 
It's just another Spago clone, with an open kitchen, wood-burning oven, pizzas, 
grills and so forth. They even make their own version of Wolfgang Puck's famous 
"Jewish pizza" (smoked salmon and cream cheese.) 
</P>
<P>
But it is in Pasadena, a town that once had one of the area's most ambitious 
restaurants -- La Couronne -- and didn't support it; a town that seems most 
eager to spend its dining dollars elsewhere; a town that has any number of 
pleasant places -- Old Town Bakery and Roxxi to name just two -- but doesn't 
seem eager to support any real culinary innovation. In this atmosphere, the 
success of Parkway Grill is slightly surprising. 
</P>
<P>
For it is a thoroughly modern restaurant plunked down in a large old brick 
building. The menu is as eclectic as they come, mingling delicious pizzas, 
crisp Chinese duck, blue corn tostadas, Thai tagliatelle . . . no food trend is 
absent. To make matters even more interesting, the restaurant has a program 
that brings some of the country's most innovative chefs (Mark Miller, Jasper 
White, Anne Rosenzweig) flying in for visits. So if I'm eating in Pasadena, 
this is probably where you'll find me. 
</P>
<P>
 510 S. Arroyo Parkway, Pasadena; (818) 795-1001. Entrees from $8.50 to $22 
</P>
<P>
GINZA SUSHIKO 
</P>
<P>
When I first walked into this sushi bar, hidden in an unprepossessing strip 
mall in the mid-Wilshire district, I didn't know I was about to order the most 
expensive meal I had ever eaten in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
How could I? Nothing about the place was particularly ostentatious. It looked, 
in fact, like almost every other sushi bar I've been in. With one exception. 
This was not a sushi bar with a glass case filled with fish for diners to point 
at. The chef stood behind his counter, following his own whims, taking fish out 
of a hidden refrigerator, slicing it and placing little morsels before me. 
</P>
<P>
But what fish it turned out to be! Perfect slices of pink abalone. The richest 
tuna I'd ever tasted. An orange and purple clam that looked like a painting by 
Georgia O'Keeffe. Sea urchins that were bigger, fatter than any I'd ever 
encountered. The meal went on and on, ending with two giant strawberries. And a 
bill for $100. 
</P>
<P>
This may seem expensive. But to the Japanese businessmen who make up the 
majority of the clientele, Ginza Sushiko is a bargain. Were they eating at the 
Tokyo branch of the restaurant, the bill would be at least twice as much. 
</P>
<P>
3959 Wilshire Blvd., A-11, Los Angeles; (213) 487-2251. Sushi from $4 to $10 
per piece. 
</P>
<P>
FINO 
</P>
<P>
Worth the trip? Probably not. But if I lived in Torrance, I'd haunt the place, 
for Fino is certainly the most interesting restaurant to open in the South Bay 
in quite some time. 
</P>
<P>
It feels wonderful, with all the energy of a small bistro in the south of 
France. It smells even more wonderful, primarily of the roasted garlic and 
olive oil that are plunked on your table, along with a dish of olives and a 
loaf of bread, when you sit down. And there's a real warmth about it, which 
might emanate from all the wine and beer that is consumed on the premises (both 
the beer list and the wine list are gems). 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the food in this cozy little boite all sounds spectacular; the menu 
offers a list of rustic Mediterranean favorites, stretching from Spanish tapas 
to Provencale tapenades and Italian pesto. But much of the cooking is too 
intense; the chef seems to think that if a little of something is good, more is 
better. When a stew has wine and orange peel in it, neither is subtle; when a 
pasta is made with olives, they are overwhelming. Still, it hardly matters. 
This is the sort of place where you drink your wine, eat a large order of tapas 
and think about how much fun life can be. 
</P>
<P>
24530 Hawthorne Blvd., Torrance; (213) 373-1952. Entrees from $7.95 to $19.95. 
</P>
<P>
FRESCO 
</P>
<P>
When I feel in need of comfort, I think of Fresco in Glendale. It's one of 
those restaurants that always manages to make me feel cared for. 
</P>
<P>
There's even something comforting about the scale of the place: Everything is a 
little too small. The effect is to make you feel that you're in a restaurant in 
some small town (well, actually, you are). And co-owner Lino Autiero is one of 
those people who must have been born in a tuxedo; he's the perfect maitre d', 
who acts as if his sole desire in life is to make you feel good. More warm 
bread? Yes, please -- it's fabulous. How about some wine? But of course. You 
don't see anything you want on the menu? The chef would be happy to cook 
something special. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the chef can cook something special is what makes all this work. 
Lino's partner is chef Antonio Orlando, who loves to make fancy Italian food 
such as corn crepes with duck in port sauce and cannelloni stuffed with lobster 
and spinach. These may be impressive, but I prefer his simpler dishes; there's 
nothing quite as comforting as fried calamari followed by a plate of whole 
wheat pasta with cheese and black pepper. 
</P>
<P>
514 S. Brand Blvd., Glendale; (818) 247-5541. Entrees from $13 to $20. 
</P>
<P>
HARBOR VILLAGE 
</P>
<P>
At 11 a.m. you might get a seat, but by noon you'll find yourself surrounded by 
hordes of people, waiting clamorously for a table. Considering the size of 
Harbor Village (huge), that's quite a testimonial to the quality of the food. 
Take a seat in the ornate dining room, and you'll instantly understand: The 
carts that roll endlessly past contain the most inventive selection of dim sum 
this side of Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Village, a branch of a Hong Kong restaurant, is also the perfect choice 
for a blowout Chinese banquet. At night, the enormous dining room shrinks when 
ingenious sliding panels slice it into a multitude of private dining rooms. On 
almost any evening, you can peek into one of these little rooms and see tables 
filled with privileged people eating truly exotic delicacies. 
</P>
<P>
For regular evening diners, however, the restaurant can be problematic. You 
might end up with fabulous food -- great steamed fish, special salads, simple 
plates of vegetables, Peking duck. Or you could be unlucky and wait a long time 
for food that turns out to be merely mediocre. (To be safe, don't order fried 
food at night, and stick to simple dishes.) Even on the off nights, however, 
there's something so wonderfully foreign about the place that you end up 
feeling as if you've been on a quick trip to Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 111 N. Atlantic Blvd., Monterey Park; (818) 300-8833. Entrees from $5 to $25. 
</P>
<P>
SORRENTO GRILLE 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach on a sunny day can be so seductively lovely that you are inclined 
to plunk yourself down on the sandy beach in the middle of town and just sit 
there, gazing out to sea. If you get hungry, you don't have far to go; the 
Sorrento Grille is just a lazy walk inland, and it serves the perfect sort of 
food for this setting. 
</P>
<P>
Freshness is the hallmark here: The produce in this casually elegant restaurant 
comes from the superlative Chino ranch, the chicken is free-range, the bread is 
homemade. The theme is basically Italian, but the chefs feel free to cook 
anything that strikes their fancy. You can watch them tossing a really 
springlike pasta primavera in the open kitchen -- but you can also see them 
slicing a slow-cooked beef brisket that would please any red-blooded 
meat-eater. Soups and salads are especially good here; pizzas are not. 
</P>
<P>
Finding the Sorrento Grille in Orange County is a special pleasure. Orange 
County, after all, is the place that only yesterday prided itself on offering 
footstools and roses to the ladies in its best restaurants and enormous bills 
to the gentlemen. Things have changed: These days, flowers and footstools are 
hard to find. Good food, however, is not. 
</P>
<P>
 370 Glenneyre St., Laguna Beach; (714) 494-8686. Entrees from $11.50 to $20. 
</P>
<P>
IL GIARDINO 
</P>
<P>
When I first moved to Los Angeles, I couldn't believe that so many rich people 
were clamoring to get into a place where the rug was Astroturf, the prices 
high, the waiters hardly able to speak English, the chairs uncomfortable and 
the tables too small. Then I tasted the clean, straightforward Italian food, 
and I understood. 
</P>
<P>
There is something seductive about the sheer simplicity of Il Giardino. When 
you arrive, there's a big bowl of raw vegetables sitting on the table and a 
bowl of oil and vinegar to dip them into. The risotto is superb, as are the 
simpler pastas (when you get into the more baroque offerings, the quality goes 
down). The best entrees are the grilled bronzino -- served with roast potatoes 
and greens -- and the herb-scented broiled sliced steak. 
</P>
<P>
Power is the other seduction of Il Giardino; it's all around, and it's 
ostentatiously low-key. As one studio executive explained to me early on, "It's 
where famous people go when they don't want to be seen." 
</P>
<P>
 9235 W. 3rd St., Beverly Hills; (213) 275-5444. Entrees from $10 to $25.

<P>
</P>
<P>
BEST BREAKFAST 
</P>
<P>
THE COFFEE SHOP AT THE BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL 
</P>
<P>
Come on in to the perfect pink counter shop. Sit down; watch Gary as he grills 
greaseless bacon and pours perfect pancakes. Drizzle real maple syrup over the 
pancakes, have some eggs and wash it all down with a glass of orange juice that 
was squeezed just seconds ago. If there's a better way to start the day, I 
haven't found it. 9641 Sunset Blvd., Beverly Hills; (213) 276-2251. 
</P>
<P>
BEST CHICKEN 
</P>
<P>
VERSAILLES 
</P>
<P>
Everybody knows that the garlic chicken at Versailles is fantastic. And who am 
I to disagree? The black beans and rice are pretty swell, too. But there's one 
pressing question: With a new restaurant about to open on La Cienega Boulevard, 
will the big time ruin Versailles? 10319 Venice Blvd., Culver City; (213) 
558-3168. 
</P>
<P>
BEST LUNCH DEAL 
</P>
<P>
CAFE BLANC 
</P>
<P>
This is what you get: homemade soup; a large, fresh salad; a plate filled with 
mashed potatoes and crisp chicken in mustard sauce. This is the price: $4.95. 
Spend a little more and you can have Chilean sea bass topped with orange rind 
and pink peppercorns. A line starts forming around noon. (Dinner prices are 
much higher.) 3706 Beverly Blvd.; (213) 380-2829. 
</P>
<P>
BEST HOT DOG 
</P>
<P>
THE WURST PLACE 
</P>
<P>
There are two schools of thought on hot dogs. The non-food approach demands 
that the dogs be nothing more than good greasy fun and makes eating at Pink's 
perfectly legitimate. The other school requires that the hotdogs have some sort 
of nutritional value. If you fall into the latter category, you can't do better 
than the Wurst. 17874 Kinross Ave.; (213) 824-9597. 
</P>
<P>
BEST STOREFRONT THAI 
</P>
<P>
JITLADA 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's just because I've been coming here so long. Maybe it's because it's 
so convenient for me. Although there are hundreds of more authentic Thai 
restaurants in Southern California, I have an abiding affection for Jitlada. I 
know that when I tell them I want really hot food, they'll believe me. 5233 
Sunset Blvd.; (213) 667-9809. 
</P>
<P>
BEST TACO 
</P>
<P>
YUCA'S HUT 
</P>
<P>
It's just a little stand in the middle of a parking lot, but it's such a 
friendly place, and the food's so terrific, that it's become a community 
hangout. People sit at rickety tables eating great carne asada tacos, letting 
the grease from the cochinita pibil run down their cheeks and pouring fiery hot 
sauce onto great bean burritos. 2056 Hillhurst Ave.; (213) 662-1214. 
</P>
<P>
BEST BURGER 
</P>
<P>
MEATY MEAT BURGERS 
</P>
<P>
There's lots of controversy about who makes the best burgers. The truth is that 
if you're willing to spend big bucks, any number of places make great ones. 
(The Grill, West Beach Cafe, City and Morton's come immediately to mind.) But 
if you're looking for the people's burger -- fatty, peppery meat, lots of 
lettuce and tomatoes, all the works and not much money -- this is the place. 
(The fries are pretty good, too: They may be limp, but they're greaseless and 
have a fine potato flavor.) 5855 W. Pico Blvd. (corner of Fairfax Avenue); 
</P>
<P>
(213) 933-2640. 
</P>
<P>
BEST POT STICKERS 
</P>
<P>
MANDARIN DELI 
</P>
<P>
These pot stickers are fat crescents, soft on one side, crunchy on the other 
and filled with an airy mixture of meat. They're wonderful. (So are the boiled 
fish dumplings, the noodle soups and the garlic-drenched seaweed salad.) 727 N. 
Broadway, (213) 623-6054; 356 E. 2nd St., (213) 617-0231; 701 W. Garvey Ave., 
Monterey Park, (818) 570-9795; 9351 Reseda Blvd., Northridge, (818) 993-0122. 
</P>
<P>
BEST SAUSAGE 
</P>
<P>
JODY MARONI SAUSAGE 
</P>
<P>
Even if Jody didn't make terrific sausage, it would be worth coming out to the 
Venice boardwalk just to watch him run through his spiel. He shouts, he 
cajoles, he pleads, he exhorts; he wants you to try his sausage. Go ahead; 
you'll be glad you did. Venice Boardwalk; (213) 730-0941. 
</P>
<P>
BEST AIRPORT FOOD 
</P>
<P>
HOST CAFETERIA AMERICAN AIRLINES TERMINAL 
</P>
<P>
Your plane's late. You face one more miserable meal in this cafeteria where 
everything is overpriced and awful. Don't despair: For the increasing flow of 
Japanese travelers, Host now sells a big bowl of udon -- noodle soup. It's 
good, and it's only $5.95. 
</P>
<P>
BEST SRI LANKAN FOOD 
</P>
<P>
SIRI LANKA CURRY HOUSE 
</P>
<P>
There are dozens of good Indian restaurants serving northern tandoori dishes 
and curries as well as a growing number of places offering vegetarian food of 
the south. But this is the only place I know serving the fragrant food from the 
island at India's southern tip. I love the lacy egg-topped pancakes called 
appam. 1308 N. Highland Ave.; (213) 466-8238. 
</P>
<P>
BEST LEBANESE FOOD 
</P>
<P>
MAROUCH 
</P>
<P>
Before you've finished a meal in this bare-bones restaurant, your table will be 
covered with little bowls containing wonderful concoctions to scoop up with 
pita: smoky eggplant dip, fat beans, bowls of tangy sour cream. Go on to roast 
chicken with garlic sauce, wrapped up in big sheets of lavash. And be amazed by 
how little it all costs. 4905 Santa Monica Blvd.; (213) 662-9325. 
</P>
<P>
BEST SHRIMP 
</P>
<P>
OCEAN STAR 
</P>
<P>
The "swimming shrimp" are fished, live, out of the tank, steamed and served 
with a bowl of soy sauce and chilies. Other tanks hold live lobsters and 
scallops. (There are plenty of non-fish foods worth eating here, too, such as a 
Cantonese beef stew with turnips.) 112 N. Chandler Ave., Monterey Park; (818) 
300-8446. 
</P>
<P>
BEST PUB 
</P>
<P>
MITSUKI 
</P>
<P>
Pity the poor people waiting for a table; customers sit here for hours, 
drinking and munching their way through the large menu. The sushi's good, and 
there are grilled offerings (eggplant, mushrooms, various meat and fish) and 
big bowls of warming soups. The perfect place after a very hard day. 201 N. 
Western Ave.; (213) 871-0703. 
</P>
<P>
BEST SANDWICH 
</P>
<P>
PHILIPPE'S 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Philippe didn't really invent the French Dip back in 1918 -- but his 
restaurant still makes a mean one (I like beef best, but the lamb's good, too). 
Sawdust on the floor, communal tables, 10-cent coffee and great doughnuts -- 
why aren't there more restaurants like this one? 1001 N. Alameda St.; (213) 
628-3781.

ENDPAPERS: SELF-HELP AND THE AMERICAN DREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN K. ROTH, John K. Roth teaches about the American Dream at Claremont 
McKenna College, where he is professor of philosophy. He has published numerous 
books on American thought, including, most recently, American Ground: Vistas, 
Visions, and Revisions (Paragon). 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When the kids were little, we used to play Milton-Bradley's "Game of Life." 
Winning meant being a millionaire, but unlucky rolls of the dice could make you 
a loser instead. In that case, the game board said, you retired to the country 
and became a philosopher. A few years later, Milton-Bradley varied the theme. 
While millionaire status was still the goal, the game of life became the 
American Dream. 
</P>
<P>
These pursuits of happiness both provided help along the way. You could take a 
stock market tip, buy insurance, or try a new career. Failure to make the right 
move at the right time spelled mediocrity if not misfortune or disaster. The 
game designers, however, neglected to offer assistance that Americans 
apparently consume as quickly as publishers can put their writers' 
advice-filled words between covers. 
</P>
<P>
To reflect American life accurately, somewhere the "Game of Life," and "The 
American Dream," should have let you land on a square where you could buy, 
read, and heed a self-help book. Doing the latter is a part of the American way 
as old as it has been profitable for those whose trade is books. Scores of 
self-help books appear every year. They cover a host of topics. Some offer to 
teach us how to enhance business by becoming one-minute managers. Others 
prescribe how to improve our looks or personalities, how to achieve better 
health by adopting a vegetarian diet, or how to expand happiness by doing 
aerobics or running a marathon. By reading you can also learn how to cope with 
earthquakes or the Internal Revenue Service. Still other examples preach the 
power of positive thinking, or, if that's not trendy enough, the latest "new 
age" spirituality. Principles of success, rules for living well, and the steps, 
always simple it seems, to put them into practice -- these are the keys to the 
kingdom of self-help. Not surprisingly, many of them unlock the secrets of the 
"Game of Life" and "The American Dream." They promise the way to wealth. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the aim envisioned by self-help books, their pitch is usually that 
grasping the goal is within everyone's reach. Yet the appeal is also that if 
you take their advice, the wisdom you show in doing so will make you different 
and better than the mediocre majority who lack the good sense and initiative to 
improve. These books sell both ways: "Anyone can do it," they insist, but their 
advice is for you, the discerning individual who has the uncommon determination 
to try. 
</P>
<P>
If such appeals want to make us "feel good about ourselves" twice over, they 
trade on guilt pangs, too. Failure to buy, read, and heed its advice, warns the 
typical self-promoting self-help book, equals lost opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
The advertising for one recent entry in the self-help field, Mark Fisher's "The 
Instant Millionaire," provides a case in point. Its hype describes the book as 
"a concise, quick two-hour read," by a writer who wants to share generously 
with others the secrets of a philosophy that did not force him into country 
retirement but made him a millionaire at 36 instead. One promotional blurb 
identifies a few of Fisher's secrets -- they include cliches such as "don't be 
afraid to ask," "don't underestimate your own self-worth," and "aim high" -- 
and then tantalizes the prospective buyer by asking: "For $12.95, who among us 
can afford not to read this book?" 
</P>
<P>
Fisher's advice isn't bad. One could certainly do worse things with $12.95 than 
to buy, read, and heed his book. However improbable, doing so might even help 
to make one an "instant millionaire." Less remote to ponder, though, is what 
the continuing popularity of the self-help genre may tell us about ourselves. 
That line of thought takes us back to the game of life in the United States and 
to the American Dream in particular. 
</P>
<P>
Few terms are defined in so many different ways or bandied about more loosely 
than the American Dream. To some people, the term is a joke, an object of 
satire, derision, or contempt. To others it denotes a unique set of social and 
moral ideals -- liberty, for example, and justice for all. Typically, however, 
the idea suggests individual opportunity, ever-present new beginnings to 
achieve self-determined success. 
</P>
<P>
The American Dream depends upon the gospel of self-help. Already in the 18th 
Century, Benjamin Franklin understood and promoted that vision. His witty 
wisdom for good living -- "God helps them that help themselves," "Early to bed, 
and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise" -- made his "Poor 
Richard's Almanac" an early self-help classic. He was urged to complete his 
equally famous "Autobiography" by a friend who judged no one to be better 
qualified than Franklin "to promote a greater spirit of industry and early 
attention to business, frugality, and temperance with American youth." It 
provided more advice -- for instance, "Imitate Jesus and Socrates." 
</P>
<P>
Franklin hoped for the prudent and ethical practice of business, but in the 
next century, the Transcendentalist philosopher, Ralph Waldo Emerson, found 
Americans distracted by materialistic interests. His corrective, in contrast to 
Franklin's, entailed an awakening of spirit. Yet these advisers shared 
important traits as well. Both criticized Americans for being half asleep, for 
failing to energize their potential. Each was also highly optimistic about what 
American life could achieve. But everything hinged on what Emerson called 
"self-reliance." His 1841 essay on that subject urged the American individual 
to avoid conformity, to understand that "a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin 
of little minds, and to trust thyself." 
</P>
<P>
Emerson's Self-Reliance became the quintessential statement of America's faith 
in individualism. Although in some ways the self-help genre is really a form of 
"other-reliance," advising us to do what others say, it nevertheless remains 
quintessentially individualistic. Thus, it is doubly indebted to Emerson and to 
Franklin before him. Much good has come from American individualism and from 
the self-help initiatives it has produced and promoted. 
</P>
<P>
But dangers lurk within this tradition, too. Insofar as self-help favors 
self-fulfillment over civic virtue and a publicly responsible patriotism, we 
may care too much for individual wealth and not enough for our commonwealth. 
</P>
<P>
To be really helpful in the 1990s, American self-help needs to concentrate less 
on individual success and more on the fatal interdependence of all human 
action. It needs to emphasize insights such as those in the preamble to our 
Constitution. There the framers said nothing about instant millionaires or even 
about winning the game of life. Their American Dream concentrated instead on 
establishing justice, promoting the general welfare, and securing the blessings 
of liberty not only for ourselves but also for our posterity. Their goal was 
not greater individualism but "a more perfect union." 
</P>
<P>
For all of their individualism, Franklin and Emerson understood and cared for 
those ideals, too. We Americans could help ourselves indeed by reinvigorating 
that part of our self-help tradition.

THE NEXT COMPUTER FASHION OF THE '90S

FOR A LONG time, computer lovers referred to the NeXT computer as "vaporware" 
-- it sounded great but was never quite ready to enter production. Everything 
about it sounded larger than life, including the $100,000 fee reportedly paid 
to Paul Rand to design the logo (that's $25,000 per letter). 
</P>
<P>
The NeXT is the brainchild of Steve Jobs, co-creator of the original Apple 
computer and the Macintosh. Jobs claims that computers have a 10-year life 
span: The IBM PC (introduced in 1981) is moribund, the Macintosh (introduced in 
1984) has peaked, and the '90s, he boasts, will belong to the NeXT. Instead of 
a conventional floppy or hard disk, the NeXT incorporates a state-of-the-art 
removable, erasable optical drive. And its screen resolution is nearly twice 
that of the Mac, to better display the reference books in digital form that 
come bundled with the computer, including the complete works of Shakespeare and 
Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
As a design object, the NeXT (for $10,000) fascinates. Instead of the customary 
beige-colored keyboard, mouse and monitor, NeXT's are stark black. That plus 
the jazzy connectors evoke an Art Deco look. The incongruous mix of advanced 
technology and '30s future-world styling evokes the phantasmagoric worlds of 
such '80s movies as "Batman," "Blade Runner" and "Brazil." Such unusual looks 
help persuade buyers that the NeXT really is different from previous personal 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 The NeXT computer system is available at all Businessland stores. DAVID LASKER

SOUTHLAND SWEATS OUT SIZZLING CINCO DE MAYO; 
</P>
<P>
HEAT: ANAHEIM'S 98-DEGREE HIGH IS HOTTEST FOR DATE IN 37 YEARS. THOUSANDS 
SWELTER THROUGH HOLIDAY FESTIVITIES.

Record temperatures baked Orange County and the rest of the Southland on 
Saturday as thousands headed for the cooling waters of the Pacific or choose to 
take the heat at a host of Cinco de Mayo celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
Light wind and a stationary high-pressure system sent the mercury soaring to 
101 degrees in Los Angeles and 98 in Anaheim, the highest readings for May 5 in 
both areas in 37 years, according to the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hot," said Louise Diaz, with a pineapple Popsicle in hand. Diaz, wearing 
a full-length, long-sleeved ruffled dress, was waiting to perform Saturday with 
the Folklorico La Fonda dance troupe at the Mariachi Festival in downtown Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Weather forecasters said the 100-degree temperatures were not expected to 
return today. Steve Burback, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which 
supplies forecasts to The Times, said the high-pressure system that spanned 
from San Francisco to Nevada's Great Basin would move eastward, leaving a few 
clouds and highs in the upper 80s and low 90s today. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures are expected to return to seasonal norms Monday when a marine 
layer with cool, moist air and onshore breezes is to resume. 
</P>
<P>
Air quality was rated unhealthful Saturday, according to the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District. The AQMD predicted the conditions will continue 
today. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, tens of thousands of people sought relief at the beaches, 
where lifeguards described the weather conditions as near-perfect. Air 
temperatures ranged from 70 to 75 degrees and the water was an inviting 68 
degrees. Winds were light; the surf a paltry two feet. 
</P>
<P>
"Conditions are ideal," said Newport Beach Marine Safety Officer Mitch White. 
"It's a beautiful sunny day, there is hardly any wind, the water is warm and 
there are Cinco de Mayo parties along the beach." 
</P>
<P>
Crowd estimates ranged from almost 90,000 in Newport Beach to 5,000 in Laguna 
Beach. Huntington Beach lifeguards said attendance was moderate to heavy. And 
in Seal Beach, lifeguards reported a crowd of about 10,000, only 2,000 less 
than the average daily attendence for July through September. 
</P>
<P>
The perfect conditions were marred by coastal roads clogged with carloads of 
sun-loving beach-goers and a few minor encounters between lifeguards and rowdy 
beer drinkers. Authorities reported a handful of first-aid calls and rescues 
involving children. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County lifeguards reported crowds ranging from 100,000 at Long 
Beach and Hermosa Beach to 90,000 at Zuma. In Santa Monica, an estimated 
150,000 shoreline visitors lounged on the sand. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 customers in Laguna Niguel lost electrical power for about half an 
hour Saturday afternoon because excessive demand from air conditioners knocked 
a circuit out of service, said Steve Sullivan, spokesman for Southern 
California Edison Co. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the county, Latinos and aficionados of Mexican culture sweltered 
in the heat at Cinco de Mayo celebrations to mark the victory of a band of 
heavily outnumbered Mexicans over the French at Acutzingo Peak in Puebla, 
Mexico, on May 5, 1862. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the largest observance was at Centennial Regional Park in Santa Ana, 
where the only real relief from the 93-degree temperature were cold drinks, 
beer and the banks of the park's small lake. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of the Cinco de Mayo events were singing, folk dancing, carnival rides, 
Mexican food and music, including the first mariachi festival held in Orange 
County, which began Saturday at Santa Ana's Fiesta Marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
At UC Irvine, activities included "Noche de la Raza," a student theatrical 
production chronicling Mexican history through music. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people milled around the grounds of Centennial Park, where 
advertisers' huge inflated beer cans and cigarette packs stood like sentinels 
over the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Bands played from two stages. Revelers sampled Mexican cuisine, guzzled beer 
and queued up for games and prizes at dozens of display booths, including "El 
Mundo de Drackett" (The World of Drackett), where people tossed rings over 
plastic bottles of Drano drain cleaner in hopes of winning them. 
</P>
<P>
Others waited patiently for free spinal exams from several chiropractors, who 
set up temporary shop on the park's field. Those without a penchant for Mexican 
food dined on "beef on a stick" and Thai-Chinese food. 
</P>
<P>
At Fiesta Marketplace, 4th Street was closed to cars between French and Birch 
streets, allowing people to gather and wander through the street to listen to 
mariachi music, buy tacos or have their faces painted. 
</P>
<P>
Booths offered information on everything from cosmetics to becoming a police 
officer, but the longest line was at a booth selling state lottery tickets. 
Except for one drunken man who was escorted away from the stage by police, 
there were no incidents by late afternoon Saturday.

EMOTIONAL SCARS TORMENT WOUNDED SANTA ANA CHILD 
</P>

SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even before a bullet tore through the living room wall of his house and 
traveled through his young body, Carlitos Alvarez had been frightened by gang 
violence in his neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Now, two weeks after being shot during one of Santa Ana's bloodiest weekends, 
the 8-year-old is home from the hospital, having barely escaped permanent 
physical injury. 
</P>
<P>
Emotionally, though, he may never be the same. 
</P>
<P>
When nightfall comes, Carlitos does not want to sit in the room where he was 
struck by the bullet, which police believe was fired from a passing car. He 
won't say why, but he will tell his family that it is time for everyone to go 
to bed, especially his younger brothers and sisters. 
</P>
<P>
Nightmares disturb his sleep. And as he tosses and turns, he mutters out loud 
as if in pain, according to his mother, Reyna Alvarez. During the day, he is 
quiet; quieter than she remembers him ever being. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctor says he is fine," Alvarez said last week, "that he is recuperating 
very quickly, but that he is traumatized. . . . He is very sad, and he isn't as 
he was before. 
</P>
<P>
"But that he is even alive," she added, "that is so much already." 
</P>
<P>
School psychologists and others who work with gang prevention programs say the 
scars of violence can remain forever. For children who are victims, it is 
important that adults in their lives help them work out their fears and 
anxieties. 
</P>
<P>
"The nightmares won't go away overnight," said Tony Borbon, director of the 
gang prevention program operated by Turning Points Family Services. "It's not 
like the bullet that pierced the child and entered and exited his body right 
away. The harm is spiritual and mental. Only time and attention will heal 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Schools throughout the county have programs to encourage children -- as young 
as elementary-school age -- to stay out of gangs. Teachers try hard to equip 
them with decision-making skills and self-confidence to stand up to gang peer 
pressure and help them cope with the accompanying fear. 
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult for some children," said Cathy Makin, principal of Santa Ana's 
Spurgeon Middle School. "Especially when you're 8 years old -- what have you 
done? You just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't just forget this after a week or two. It will take years to get over 
it. I would put a lot of pressure on the parents (of Carlitos) to seek some 
sort of help for him." 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez said that when Carlitos went for his last checkup after being wounded, 
the doctor gave her the telephone number of a psychologist. But she is waiting 
to see how much her son's medical bills will be before calling. She has, 
however, phoned her pastor, who has promised to visit. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Santa Ana Unified School District, which Carlitos attends, 
said that when the boy returns to classes, he will be referred to a school 
psychologist or someone else if he appears to need help readjusting. 
</P>
<P>
It will be up to Carlitos' teachers to judge whether other children also need 
counseling, as did the classmates of 9-year-old Nadia Puente, a 4th-grader at 
Santa Ana's Diamond Elementary who was abducted and murdered last year. In that 
instance, the district sent over a team of counselors to help the children deal 
with their grief. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Rydell, coordinator for Santa Ana's school psychologists, said no 
counselor has been requested yet for Carlitos' class. When one child asked what 
had happened to his classmate, the teacher allowed the children to talk about 
the shooting. She used it as an opportunity to tell them about the harm that 
gangs can bring, Rydell said. 
</P>
<P>
The one to worry about, Rydell said, will be Carlitos. The kinds of thoughts 
going through his head about this injury, she said, are not the same as if he 
had been hurt, say, playing catch. 
</P>
<P>
"Something violent has been done to him, and he's not going to feel safe," 
Rydell said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are a lot of children at Santa Ana who don't feel safe. But 
everybody is working on it. We know it's not going to go away unless we work on 
it and fix it, and I think good things are happening right now, with so many 
programs working together to deal with this." 
</P>
<P>
Along with school counselors, there are community-based programs working in 
tandem with the schools and the Police Department to help parents and children 
understand that they do not need to tolerate violence in their neighborhoods, 
Rydell said. 
</P>
<P>
Carlitos, a nickname the child goes by because an uncle Carlos also lives in 
the family house on West Lingan Lane, at first spoke very little when visited 
by a reporter last week. 
</P>
<P>
He wore a small bandage on his back, near his right shoulder, covering an 
inch-wide hole that the bullet made after passing through the wall and the 
couch where he sat watching TV on the night of April 23. Another bandage runs 
across his stomach, where the bullet exited just left of his navel, still with 
force enough to pass through another wall and bruise the shoulder of an aunt 
asleep in bed. 
</P>
<P>
For the reporter's visit, he was dressed in blue shorts and a pajama top, with 
Batman slippers on his feet, and sat round-faced and shy, flashing an easy 
smile. 
</P>
<P>
When he walked, he kept his head down, complaining that the pain in his right 
shoulder makes it difficult to hold his head high. 
</P>
<P>
When asked whether he remembers what happened to him that night, he shook his 
head no. But slowly, drawn out by conversation on other topics, he began to 
recount the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"When they shot me, I didn't hear anything," Carlitos said. 
</P>
<P>
"You didn't feel it when they hit you?" his mother asked gently. 
</P>
<P>
He shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
"Did it hurt?" she continued. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt the blood coming out of me and I was crying," he replied. "When they 
(paramedics) tried to put the mask on me, I said no. At the hospital, when they 
tried to put something on my head, I shook my head so they wouldn't do it. I 
was crying." 
</P>
<P>
"The nurses said you were saying, 'abuelita, abuelita,' " his mother reminded, 
explaining that he had called for his grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Carlitos' little brother Gabriel, 3, came up to him, and they 
spoke about his watch, which has Mickey Mouse on the face. 
</P>
<P>
"My cousin has been to Disneyland, and she told me all about it," Carlitos said 
cheerily. "She took pictures, and she showed them to me, pictures of her with 
Mickey, of her with some little cars, of her with all the characters from 
Disneylandia. My mother said we will go there too after I am well." 
</P>
<P>
For five days, the wounded boy had been at UCI Medical Center in Orange, and 
every night except the first, his grandfather or his mother stayed with him. 
</P>
<P>
"I love my grandmother very much," he said. "I also love my mother a lot, and 
my grandfather I love a lot too." 
</P>
<P>
Carlitos has been in the United States just two years, since he and his 
grandparents joined his mother, who had come here several years before. Because 
he has spent much of his early childhood with his grandparents, he is close to 
them. Besides Gabriel, he has a 2-year-old sister, Isabel, and a baby sister, 
Yvette, born just seven days before Carlitos was shot. 
</P>
<P>
Since the shooting, Carlitos said, "I dream about many bad things. . . . About 
monsters. 
</P>
<P>
"At the hospital, I had dreams about monsters and about what happened to me. I 
couldn't sleep very well. I was awake all the time except when morning came, 
and then I would sleep." 
</P>
<P>
As Carlitos spoke with the visitor, the house bustled with activity. His 
grandmother was cooking. His stepfather was in the back, cleaning the yard. An 
uncle was getting ready for work. An aunt sat and listened to his conversation. 
His brothers and sisters played around him, and cousins came and went. The 
five-bedroom house is home to about 15 family members and others. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 13 months, family members say, the household has fallen victim to 
several other incidents of gang violence. Two other family members have been 
wounded by gunfire in separate incidents, and a few months ago a homemade bomb 
was thrown through a sliding glass door -- but didn't explode. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the latest bullet, the one that went through Carlitos, may have 
been a gang retaliation. A few months ago, a 15-year-old cousin was arrested in 
connection with the killing of a gang member. 
</P>
<P>
Carlitos, who likes playing with toy cars and reading books, seemed not to know 
much about that when asked whether he knows who shot him. 
</P>
<P>
"No. I think one was a cholo who was following another one, and they shot each 
other, and maybe one of the bullets came in here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Classmates from school have written him stacks of get-well cards. Carlitos went 
to get them from his room and came back with a shopping bag of blue, pink and 
purple pastel colors brimming with the toys his mother had given him at the 
hospital. Inside were the 91 cards and letters that students at Jackson 
Elementary School wrote, some in English and some in Spanish. They are 
colorful, with drawings on construction paper, or on white paper with dinosaurs 
sketched by felt-tip marker. Most are cheery, with entreaties for Carlitos to 
get well soon. A handful are more thoughtful -- and telling. 
</P>
<P>
"Dear Carlos: I want you to get well soon. I think about you a lot. . . . How 
is the food in the hospital? Good, I hope." 
</P>
<P>
"Dear Carlos: . . . If it happened to me, I could be just like you. I hope the 
guy that shot you pays the price. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Dear Carlos: We love you very much. Every night, I think of you. Carlos, I 
know that you are suffering, but you will be back to school soon. Carlos, we 
are very sad that you are not with us at school. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Dear Carlos: I hope you get better soon. I pray to God that this doesn't 
happen to the rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
One card said simply on the front: "Get Well Soon," and then the word gangs is 
circled and crossed out.

CORONA AGAIN AT REDEVELOPMENT CROSSROADS; 
</P>
<P>
DOWNTOWN: LEADERS OF THE GROWING RIVERSIDE COUNTY COMMUNITY SEE A NEED TO 
ATTRACT ITS NEW RESIDENTS TO THE CITY'S CORE.

<TEXT>
<P>
When the Riverside Freeway opened almost 30 years ago, it was a boon to 
motorists but a blow to downtown Corona, supplanting what was once a bustling 
commercial district along 6th Street as the primary route to the coast. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown interests fought back, partly rebuilding Corona's historic core in 
time to benefit from the boom of the 1980s, when the city almost doubled in 
size as newcomers found it a haven of relative affordability and convenience. 
</P>
<P>
But civic leaders today, wary of early signs of decay and the recent flight of 
at least one longtime business, are now suggesting that it may be time again to 
redevelop. 
</P>
<P>
While some hope that downtown will regain pre-eminence as the city's retail 
center, others want to solidify the gains that attracted banks, real estate 
agencies and insurance offices. 
</P>
<P>
Crime has increased in the past five years downtown and there still is an acute 
lack of parking. Redevelopment could persuade white-collar businesses to remain 
and might also prevent the area from becoming a collection of abandoned 
mini-malls and cheap motels, civic leaders believe. 
</P>
<P>
"It's at a point where it could go either way," said Kent Hansen, the immediate 
past president of the Corona Downtown Business Assn. ". . . It could be a row 
of junk shops or it could be something we are proud of." 
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, growth has been explosive, with many living in Corona and 
commuting to work in Orange and Los Angeles counties. But instead of buying 
downtown, many new residents have chosen to shop at regional centers in Orange 
County or at new retail strip malls near their own neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The result has been what some residents say is a disjointed city lacking a 
central retail business district. 
</P>
<P>
"For many people, they need a sense of focus for their community," said Susanna 
Branch, a member of the Corona Historic Preservation Society. "Many people want 
our town to have a feeling that it's not just a place to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
The Downtown Business Assn. has asked the City Council to study the entire area 
within Grand Boulevard, which forms a circle around downtown and the city's 
historic residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to redevelopment, the association also has proposed creating a 
business- and parking-improvement district to better promote the downtown area, 
beautify decaying buildings and provide extra security to blighted areas. Under 
the plan, improvements would be funded through a 35% surcharge on business 
licenses issued each year. The City Council is expected to take up the matter 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
If Corona chooses to redevelop, it would be the second time the city has 
attempted to revive its core. 
</P>
<P>
Sixth and Main streets, in the middle of the proposed redevelopment area, were 
once the central shopping areas. The streets, crossing in Corona's center, were 
home to many small merchants and a major department store, J.C. Penney. 
</P>
<P>
But the area declined with the coming of the Riverside Freeway, and by the late 
1960s numerous businesses had moved out of decaying buildings -- many of which 
dated to the turn of the century -- and left the downtown area altogether. So 
Corona city leaders, vowing to restore downtown as the hub of the city's retail 
activity, launched a redevelopment project. The key was the construction of 
Corona Mall, an outdoor shopping center spread over two blocks near Main and 
6th streets. 
</P>
<P>
But the mall failed to attract a major department store and by 1980 had become 
dominated by the offices of lawyers, Realtors and insurers. Half a dozen 
restaurants and several dozen specialty shops have remained. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Pauly, then vice chairman of the Redevelopment Commission, said the project 
failed to blossom because it lacked the full support of merchants and 
politicians. But he insists that the project still managed to prevent a total 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"If we hadn't done what we had done, we would have lost the whole downtown 
area," said Pauly, who co-owns Emerson-Pauly Men's Wear, which is located in 
the Corona Mall. "It would have turned into a slum." 
</P>
<P>
Now some feel there's again a threat to downtown. A First Interstate Bank 
branch, located just a block east of the Corona Mall, recently announced that 
it would move out. 
</P>
<P>
"That became somewhat of a call to action for businesses," said George 
Guayante, the city's redevelopment director. 
</P>
<P>
Arne Leavitt, manager of the branch, said the bank simply needs more parking 
space. 
</P>
<P>
Other downtown businesses have complained of drug activity and prostitution on 
East 6th Street, Police Chief John Cleghorn said. There also have been more 
reports of vagrancy and panhandling, and the area now includes several 
transient hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Cleghorn said that although such crime isn't rampant, trying to control it has 
been frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a cyclic kind of thing," Cleghorn said. "You crack down and get rid of 
the problem and then they are back again. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a typical downtown problem where people don't have a place to go." 
</P>
<P>
Sixth Street boasts several new low-rise office buildings, but many structures 
date from the days when Corona was on the main road. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like consistent, attractive uses," Hansen said. "The core problem is a 
mixture of deteriorating business structures and new businesses." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor William Miller said he hopes new redevelopment would focus on 
establishing Corona as a center for specialty retail businesses rather than 
attempt to capture major chain stores. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are the types of businesses that are going to set us apart," said 
Miller, who owns a business in the Corona Mall that specializes in buying and 
selling historical documents. "We have got to have something other than 
mini-malls and gas stations.

SLAIN MARINE FEARED POST IN PHILIPPINES, HIS BROTHER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The brother of a U.S. Marine from El Toro who was killed by a shot to the head 
in the Philippines said Saturday his family is outraged, and he labeled the 
Buena Park man's death an act of terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Navy identified the slain American as Gunnery Sgt. John S. Fredette, 
34. Fredette was attached to the 323rd Marine Fighter Squadron based in El Toro 
and had been on temporary duty at Subic Bay Naval Base for one month. 
</P>
<P>
"It's cold-blooded murder. Terrorism, call it whatever you want," said Mark 
Fredette from the family's home in Chicopee, Mass. "This happened for nothing. 
It tore out the heart of a lot of people around here." 
</P>
<P>
This was his brother's second trip to the Philippines, and he expressed concern 
to his family about returning there, Mark Fredette said. 
</P>
<P>
"He told our mother that he didn't want to go. But the job required his 
expertise," the brother said. "He knew what was going on there." 
</P>
<P>
Philippine police said Fredette was killed by a single bullet in the back of 
his head while he was walking at 11:30 p.m. Friday in the liberty city of 
Olongapo, 50 miles northwest of Manila. 
</P>
<P>
In Manila, U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt "expressed shock and sorrow at the 
cowardly murder" of Fredette, an embassy statement said. It said U.S. officials 
were in touch with Philippine authorities regarding the investigation of the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but police suspected 
Communist guerrillas. Fredette would be the ninth U.S. victim of a rebel terror 
strike since October, 1987 and the first in Olongapo. 
</P>
<P>
Navy Lt. Cmdr. Kevin Mukree said Fredette was shot by "an unknown assailant" 
and refused to elaborate. But Philippine police officials believed the 
Communist New People's Army was behind the killing. 
</P>
<P>
Family members said Fredette was last seen at a bar just outside the base. His 
body was found in a nearby alley, Mark Fredette said. 
</P>
<P>
"He wouldn't fight. He was too smart for that," he said. "He was the kind of 
person who would help someone who was in need. A real gentle giant. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We're all very angry. We just hope the people responsible are brought to 
justice," he said. "We do it for drug dealers, we have to do for a man who 
served his country for so long." 
</P>
<P>
Fredette enlisted in the Marines at age 18 and rose to gunnery sergeant, one of 
the highest-ranking enlisted positions, family members said. He served in the 
Marines for 13 years, 10 of them at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, he managed the on-deck electronics system aboard the aircraft carrier 
Coral Sea when fighter jets from the ship bombed Libya, his brother said. 
</P>
<P>
It was his expertise in electronics that led Fredette to be dispatched with 
other members of the squadron to Subic Bay, where he was repairing airplanes, 
family members said. 
</P>
<P>
Fredette left the United States in April, serving briefly in Japan and Hawaii 
before moving to the Philippines, his brother said. 
</P>
<P>
"He loved his job," Mark Fredette said. "He joined the Marines right out of 
high school with a buddy. He just liked what he was doing there. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Mukree said off-base travel for the 40,000 military and defense department 
employees and their dependents was restricted after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a very somber mood here. We truly feel the anguish that the family 
must be going through," Mukree said. "The Marine Corps is going to be behind 
them." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his wife Julie, Fredette is survived by his parents, Augustine 
and Armand Fredette of Chicopee, and eight brothers and sisters. 
</P>
<P>
Family members said Fredette will be buried in Chicopee two weeks after 
investigators in Manila release his body. 
</P>
<P>
The attack came nine days before the start of exploratory talks on the future 
of six U.S. facilities in the Philippines, including the giant Clark Air Base 
and the Subic Bay Naval Base. The leases expire next year, and there is 
considerable sentiment in the Philippines not to renew them. 
</P>
<P>
Eight Americans have been killed in the Philippines since October, 1987, in 
attacks blamed on Communist guerrillas. Among them was Army Col. James Rowe, a 
decorated veteran of the Vietnam War and former prisoner of war.

LAST CALL FOR PATRONS OF OLD SALOON IN SAN JUAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ASHCRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was a time when the San Juan Saloon was a rollicking bar and bordello, a 
way station for hard-living cowboys who herded cattle during the week and rode 
into town for a weekend on the town. 
</P>
<P>
With a hitching post and faded plank signs outside, the saloon survived over 
the years as a workingman's watering hole as growth and urbanization changed so 
much around it. 
</P>
<P>
But time, and progress, finally caught up with the dark, musty beer parlor 
located just off the railroad tracks and a stone's throw from the historic San 
Juan Mission. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the horseback saddles and branding irons and faded pictures of 
cowboys and their mounts were taken off the walls and sold to loyal customers 
who gathered one last time to bid the old place a final farewell. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the 1932-vintage saloon became a victim of the same progress that 
has turned so much of the once rolling farmland and verdant foothills of South 
Orange County into a series of freeway off-ramps and residential communities. 
City officials, eager to spruce up the town's image, bought the saloon and 
ordered it closed. 
</P>
<P>
In its place will be installed an upscale restaurant, more in tune with the new 
multiscreen movie theater across the street and the million-dollar 
redevelopment that has taken hold in downtown San Juan. 
</P>
<P>
The saloon's last official day open was April 23. But the loyal customers came 
by Saturday to drink a few rounds on the house, recall old times and purchase a 
few keepsakes from the old bar that had withstood progress for so long. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the closing of an era," said Donna Timney, the bar's owner. "It's the 
oldest liquor bar in San Juan." 
</P>
<P>
Ownership of the bar and restaurant changed hands several times, going under 
various names -- Nick's Palace, The Watering Hole and Mexico Lindo -- before it 
became the Donales San Juan Saloon, Timney said. But it always attracted an 
eclectic mix of fun-seeking rowdies, businessmen, bikers and those drawn to the 
bar's offbeat appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a place that looked like you had to fight your way in and fight your 
way out," said Joe Oliver, 62, of San Clemente. "But once you came in, it was a 
congenial group." In an age of posh bars that cater to yuppies who want to be 
seen, the San Juan Saloon became an anachronism with sawdust-covered floors, 
country-western music, pool aficionados and dart throwers. 
</P>
<P>
The bar opened at 6 a.m. and served coffee to those who boarded the Amtrak 
train at the adjacent depot to commute into Los Angeles. Other workers 
frequented it in the evenings. 
</P>
<P>
And during the day on weekends, a circle of foreigners fast became friends. 
They sat around a large circular table, singing folk songs and discussing 
everything from politics to giant carrots. 
</P>
<P>
"They called us the knights of the round table," said Jack Wareing, 60, who 
moved to Orange County from England in 1963. "They also called us the United 
Nations because we had some English, some Irish and one German." 
</P>
<P>
He lamented the place's closing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame," said Wareing, quaffing an ale. "We should all be wearing black 
today." 
</P>
<P>
But people were hardly mourning. Saturday was the last day for the bar, and 
they were enjoying the camaraderie, yarn-spinning and free drinks. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Myler of Long Beach relished his newly purchased mounted "jackalope" head. 
A creature of folklore, the jackalope is a jack rabbit with antelope antlers. 
This one had been mounted on the wall next to the television. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen a mounted jackalope before," the 43-year-old marveled. 
</P>
<P>
His wife was less enthused. "He's not putting that in my house," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A former bartender sauntered over. "You know where those are from?" asked 
Shelly Dodsworth. 
</P>
<P>
"Wyoming," Myler said. 
</P>
<P>
"Arizona," she corrected him. 
</P>
<P>
"Wyoming." 
</P>
<P>
"They breed in Arizona." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh. Then they go to Wyoming." 
</P>
<P>
One woman recalled getting slugged in the face at the bar. "This girl was 
arguing with one guy," said Barbara Bradley, a local resident. "She went to 
punch the guy. He ducked and I got it right in the chin. That's one thing I'll 
never forget about this place. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some good times here." 
</P>
<P>
Scott Perguson met his wife at the bar. "I asked this woman to share her darts 
with me one day, and we ended up sharing our lives together," the 27-year-old 
said. "Now look what we got." 
</P>
<P>
He pointed to his curly-haired 3-year-old daughter, Holly. "She won't meet her 
husband here." 
</P>
<P>
The bar was apparently not the type of place to meet a spouse in its early 
Western days. But it was a place to meet prostitutes in the rooms directly 
upstairs from the bar, Timney said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a well-kept secret," Timney said. "Only the locals knew about it. Dads 
would bring their kids and let them play pool downstairs while they would go 
upstairs." 
</P>
<P>
The bar outgrew its reputed prostitution, but complaints of loud music and 
disorderly patrons persisted until the bar was purchased by the city. 
</P>
<P>
"Progress is nice, I guess," said Stan Gamette, who owned the building before 
selling it to the city. "But it ruins the Old West-type thing." 
</P>
<P>
With the San Juan Saloon closed, the Swallows Inn remains the most popular bar 
in town. It too is owned by the city and is part of a redevelopment district. 
But it is not known what the future holds for the Swallows. 
</P>
<P>
"Where are the people going to go?" Myler asked. "They've been here for all 
their lives."

LOCAL ELECTIONS SEAL BEACH CITY COUNCIL; 
</P>
<P>
VOTE SEEN AS REFERENDUM ON HELLMAN RANCH PROJECT 
</P>

<P>
When voters go to the polls Tuesday to fill two open seats on the City Council, 
they will be voting not only for the four candidates in the runoff but also 
deciding the future of development in this beach community, the candidates say. 
</P>
<P>
The central issue in the campaign is the Mola Development Corp.'s proposed 
$200-million housing project for the Hellman Ranch property. 
</P>
<P>
Local leaders say Tuesday's election -- which offers voters a choice between a 
two candidates for and two against the Mola plan -- will be, in effect, a 
referendum on what residents want the city to do with one of the last remaining 
parcels of vacant land in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"This election is probably one of the most important the city has had in a long 
time," said outgoing Councilwoman Joyce Risner, a supporter of the Mola 
proposal. Risner is vacating her District 3 seat because of the city's two-term 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
The council seats up for election represent two of the most diverse districts 
in the city. 
</P>
<P>
In District 1, which covers downtown and Surfside, the candidates are Marilyn 
Bruce Hastings, 61, and Joe Rullo, 54. 
</P>
<P>
In District 3, which covers part of the Leisure World retirement community and 
the area between Pacific Coast Highway and Gum Grove Park, the candidates are 
Galen F. Ambrose, 49, and Gwen Forsythe, 35. 
</P>
<P>
Rullo and Forsythe support the Mola proposal, while Hastings and Ambrose oppose 
it. The four were the top vote-getters in their district races in the March 27 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Mola's proposal was approved by the City Council last fall, but an Orange 
County Superior Court commissioner in March invalidated that approval. Now a 
new council will begin a new round of public hearings on the project, soon 
after the new council members are seated May 15. 
</P>
<P>
The current Mola plan calls for 329 homes, 26 acres of parks and 41 acres of 
restored wetlands. According to Forsythe, who headed the effort to have the 
parks included in the plan, this project may represent the best use the city 
can make of the land. 
</P>
<P>
Her opponent, Ambrose, disagrees, saying that local decision-makers are selling 
Seal Beach's most precious commodity to the highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
Ambrose is co-founder of Wetlands Restoration Society, which succeeded in 
getting the Mola plan invalidated on the grounds that permits for the project 
were issued under a section of the city's General Plan that was outdated. 
Ambrose proposes doing away with most of the project's 329 proposed units in 
the interest of saving 100 acres of what were originally wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
Hastings said she believes that slow, controlled development of the tract may 
be necessary, but that she would fight to do away with the Mola plan in hope of 
getting a better deal for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Rullo, her opponent, said the plan's density of 2.2 homes per acre and the 
public amenities included in the plan would benefit Seal Beach citizens. 
</P>
<P>
If Ambrose and Hastings both succeed in gaining council seats, Mola may have a 
difficult time gaining approval for the project. Much of the support for the 
development in the past has come from council members Risner and Mayor Victor 
S. Grgas. Grgas is also leaving the council because of the two-term limit. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates have been spending much of their pre-election energy pointing 
out the lack of experience of their foes and defending their own track records. 
</P>
<P>
Rullo accused Hastings of being a Johnny-come-lately who has never been 
involved in city affairs until this election. "I'm running on experience," he 
said. "I have experience, she has none." 
</P>
<P>
Hastings countered that she has been involved in the city as a concerned 
citizen since she got involved in a successful fight against a development of 
more than 700 houses planned four years ago for Hellman Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Forsythe -- described by her opponent, Ambrose, as an "inexperienced housewife" 
-- called the campaign mudslinging "low blows" and said Ambrose resorts to 
these tactics because he is afraid that he cannot win by running on the issues. 
</P>
<P>
Forsythe, who has helped her husband operate a sign business since it opened 
five years ago, has been a member of the city Planning Commission since earlier 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Ambrose, in a letter to constituents earlier this month, said: "A person can 
only negotiate skillfully (with developers) if they have education, knowledge 
and experience." 
</P>
<P>
He cited his master's degree in business and his experience as controller of a 
company with a budget larger than the city's as qualifying him for the job. 
</P>
<P>
Though many laud Ambrose for his efforts to save the wetlands, Risner -- who is 
supporting Forsythe and Rullo -- said Ambrose's three years as a Seal Beach 
resident have not given him enough time to understand the city's issues and the 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Others question why someone billing himself as an environmentalist would work 
for a commercial air-conditioning factory, which produces ozone-depleting 
chlorofluorocarbons. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to make a living like everybody else," Ambrose said. "I don't know of 
any industry that doesn't impact the environment." 
</P>
<P>
SEAL BEACH CITY COUNCIL CANDIDATES 
</P>
<P>
District 1 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Bruce Hastings 
</P>
<P>
Age: 61 
</P>
<P>
Occupation: Property management specialist 
</P>
<P>
Background: Hastings served on the board of directors of Children's Memorial 
Hospital Auxiliary in Long Beach and was the founding member of the Long Beach

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: 2 BARRIOS: KNIVES GIVE WAY TO GUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When my sister was in junior high school she came home one afternoon, crying 
and frightened. She told my mother that two older girls, also students, had 
pulled knives on each other in the back of the bus and had gotten into a fight. 
</P>
<P>
No blood was shed. The bus driver broke it up. My sister didn't want to go back 
to school, but my mother said she had no choice. 
</P>
<P>
She had to ride the bus because our family of nine had only one car, and my 
father needed it for work. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of us were concerned with how my sister, the oldest, would fare in the 
following days. But nothing terrible happened to her, or to us. 
</P>
<P>
This was south Texas in the early 1960s. There were tough words and knives and 
cool nicknames and cigarettes dangling from the lips of hip-talking girls with 
teased hairdos. Guys tended to grease their hair into pompadours. 
</P>
<P>
But there weren't any automatic weapons or innocent victims of drive-by 
shootings or drug dealing or even drug use, as far as I knew. 
</P>
<P>
Switch to Southern California, Orange County, almost three decades later. A 
17-year-old is gunned down at a pay phone. An 8-year-old boy is seriously 
injured when the bullet from another drive-by shooting tears through him and 
grazes a woman sleeping in the same house. A 15-year-old boy is killed outside 
another party. 
</P>
<P>
Police in Santa Ana double the number of officers assigned to go after gang 
members. On weekends, they send out officers to pick up youths who look 
suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
My newspaper writes stories about a community alarmed about gang violence. I 
write about it too. 
</P>
<P>
But do I understand it? I don't. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, at the funeral of Cesar Salgado, a 15-year-old who died from a 
bullet wound, a group of girls, friends of his, approached me when I was 
talking with some of Cesar's male friends. 
</P>
<P>
"Just don't say lies about us," one of them said, almost threatening. 
</P>
<P>
Just because some of them dressed the same, walked the same, talked the same, 
didn't make them all criminals, she said. 
</P>
<P>
More than anything, I think she was talking about stereotyping people and 
neighborhoods. I remember that. I recall overhearing some kid in the 
predominantly Anglo school that I attended saying that you had to ride in an 
armored tank if you were going to go down Main Drive, the street where I grew 
up. 
</P>
<P>
That's funny, because what I remember about my barrio is springtime, when 
mothers would pile cut flowers from their own yards in their daughters' arms, 
so that we could walk in a procession, singing songs in Spanish, to the church 
down the street. 
</P>
<P>
I can't recall a single white-collar worker among the parents on Main Drive. 
For the most part, the people who lived there were trying to do the best they 
could for themselves and for their families. 
</P>
<P>
The two girls at the back of that bus that day may have been La Susi and La 
Gata, two toughs from our neighborhood. They went on to other fights in other 
places. They never graduated from high school, as far as I can remember. Their 
boyfriends, also our neighbors, were involved in fights too, sometimes at 
wedding dances, or Quinceaneras -- 15th birthday party celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
Tires were slashed at these dances sometimes. The adults -- my parents' 
generation -- worried about the turf fights between the Main Drive boys and 
rival bands of youths from Clarkwood or McNorton, other nearby barrios. They 
worried it gave the rest of us a bad name and a bad time. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure some folks in the neighborhoods where some of these recent shootings 
occurred in Santa Ana feel the same way. 
</P>
<P>
I have talked with people in this county who work with youths, dynamic 
community leaders who are coming up with innovative ways to combat what is 
infecting a whole generation in certain neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
It has to do with lack of self-esteem, they say, no one believing in some of 
these kids, a leadership vacuum that is being filled by thugs instead of 
positive role models. I understand some of that. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, there is the peer pressure to belong. 
</P>
<P>
At Cesar's funeral, a woman my age, who graduated from Santa Ana High School 
and now works at a bank, said she didn't approve of the kids we saw dressed 
alike in their matching black sweat shirts or white T-shirts, and the girls 
they hung with. 
</P>
<P>
But she remembered the tremendous pressure all of her life to become like them. 
When she was a student at Cal State Fullerton, she recalled, other Chicanos at 
parties would inevitably ask, "Who do you claim? Who do you claim?" Which gang 
did she affiliate with, in other words. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of belonging to such a group can be at once seductive and 
intimidating. 
</P>
<P>
But kids killing kids? Who can understand that?

SENATE MEDFLY BILL DIES WITH HELP FROM COUNTY DELEGATION 
</P>

<P>
Orange County senators, some representing people outraged by repeated aerial 
sprayings of malathion, were either absent or voted against a proposal last 
week that would give their constituents added time to sue the state for health 
problems related to use of the pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
Without support from the Orange County delegation, the proposal by Assemblyman 
Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) fell three votes short of the 21-member majority 
needed for approval by the upper house. But backers of the bill said the 
measure will likely be revived. 
</P>
<P>
State health experts have repeatedly said the aerial spraying of malathion to 
eradicate the Medfly in Orange County and other parts of Southern California is 
not endangering public health, although the pesticide is known to ruin the 
paint on cars left uncovered during the applications. 
</P>
<P>
Roos and other anti-malathion legislators contend, however, that the experts 
have been wrong in the past -- as in the cases of Agent Orange, Thalidomide and 
asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
And they want to give residents ample time to sue the government and malathion 
manufacturers if medical problems are eventually traced to the pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
The Roos bill does that by changing the deadline for filing such suits, which 
under current liability law is up to a year from the date the malathion is 
actually sprayed on the ground. The measure would extend the deadline to a year 
after an illness or a death is linked to the malathion spraying, no matter how 
long ago the aerial application was made. 
</P>
<P>
Of the Orange County delegation, only Sen. Cecil N. Green (D-Norwalk) voted for 
the measure. Voting against it were Sens. Ed Royce (R-Anaheim) and Marian 
Bergeson (R-Newport Beach). 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson and Royce said Friday they voted against the measure because they do 
not believe malathion poses a health problem and because the extended deadline 
would open the door for frivolous lawsuits against the state. 
</P>
<P>
"California has too many lawsuits and too many lawyers, and this measure 
(would) cost taxpayers with frivolous lawsuits," said Royce, whose central 
Orange County district includes Garden Grove and Anaheim, two communities that 
have been sprayed. 
</P>
<P>
Although Royce said he does not believe the spraying poses a health threat, he 
is pushing his own solution to stop the aerial application -- the use of 
sterile Medflies. The Royce bill, yet to come to the Senate floor, would spend 
$1 million to produce an additional 250 million sterile flies for possible 
release in infested areas. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson said she was also afraid the Roos measure would provide an "avenue for 
constant litigation, and frankly that's an expense and hassle that the state 
doesn't need right now. 
</P>
<P>
"I would support the bill if there is information that malathion poses that 
threat," she said. "But all of the information we have been given -- and we've 
had document after document, and testimony -- says that malathion in the doses 
that are administered is not dangerous and not a threat to human beings." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) did not vote on the malathion bill Thursday 
because he left the floor to catch a plane to Los Angeles for a televised 
debate with Bergeson, his opponent in the Republican primary for lieutenant 
governor. He said Friday that, although he has some questions about the 
measure, he would likely support it when it comes up for reconsideration. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no problem whatsoever with the portion of the bill that gives extended 
time" for the lawsuits, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Frank Hill (R-Whittier) was also recorded as absent or abstaining on the 
measure. Calls to his office Friday were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
Roos said he is "very disappointed" in the no-shows or no votes from Orange 
County senators. 
</P>
<P>
"Their counterparts in the Assembly are itching to vote on a bill to get 
themselves on the record against spraying or to say that we want an insurance 
policy in regard to these experts, who say there are no health risks," Roos 
said.

AS EX-ANGEL, WASHINGTON CAN STOP CHASING THE A'S 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Claudell Washington did not want to stop wearing an Angel uniform. He did not 
want to be traded. 
</P>
<P>
But when he reluctantly shed the Angel uniform, he shed a burden with it. 
</P>
<P>
Now he no longer has to concern himself with trying to catch the Oakland 
Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
He leaves that to his former teammates. And now that he is no longer among 
them, he no longer speaks with much optimism. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a tough task for them," Washington said after driving in two 
runs to help the New York Yankees to an 11-3 victory over the Angels six days 
after he was traded with Rich Monteleone for leadoff man Luis Polonia. 
</P>
<P>
It's early in the season, but already the Angels trail the World Series 
champions by 7 1/2 games after playing 24. It might have been 8 1/2, had not 
the A's also lost Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to give the guys a chance, give the team a chance," Washington said. 
"As long as the guys don't get too down, they can come back and still have a 
productive season. They might not be able to come back and catch them, but 
there's money in second and third, too." 
</P>
<P>
The season's not over. 
</P>
<P>
Those are words the Angels often repeat, and they are certainly true. But 
Washington's perspective is different now, and has the ring of a concession 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels talk with respect of the confidence the A's exude. 
</P>
<P>
"Oakland is never worried about anybody," Washington said. "They've got a great 
team." 
</P>
<P>
When an Angel talks about that aura, it is tempered with some claim of 
confidence in the face of it. It is different for a former Angel. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as (the A's) stay healthy and stay focused, there's nobody in the 
Western Division that can slow 'em," Washington said. "It might be different in 
the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
These are the words of a man who has been jilted, one who has been traded away, 
and one who called Saturday's victory over the Angels, "Revenge. Sweet 
revenge." 
</P>
<P>
But they are also educated words. 
</P>
<P>
Washington did not play in the opening game of the series at Anaheim Stadium, 
sitting out for his first day since the trade last Sunday at the conclusion of 
a series between the teams in New York. 
</P>
<P>
He had started every game until Friday's, when the Yankees faced a left-handed 
pitcher in Mark Langston, and Manager Bucky Dent held out Washington in favor 
of Dave Winfield, who bats right-handed. 
</P>
<P>
The two appear to be platooning, though Winfield said it might not be precisely 
right to say he plays only against left-handers. 
</P>
<P>
"They say platoon, but it really isn't," Winfield said. "I don't play against 
most people." 
</P>
<P>
Washington has represented himself well in five games, going five for 17 and 
driving in three runs. 
</P>
<P>
Although Washington joined the Yankees right away, Polonia did not join the 
Angels until Wednesday, and has yet to start in an Angel victory, taking part 
in the past three defeats. 
</P>
<P>
Washington is on a team that is struggling, too, but he has won two in a row 
against his former teammates. 
</P>
<P>
It looked as if he had disappointed himself early in the game, when his one-hop 
throw to the plate in the second inning didn't prevent Dante Bichette from 
scoring on Jack Howell's sacrifice fly. Washington's throw was strong, but 
catcher Bob Geren couldn't control the ball after the bounce. 
</P>
<P>
That gave the Angels a 1-0 lead, their only lead of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Washington did his part for the offense, driving in a run with a double to 
right in the fourth and another with a sacrifice fly in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
And after today's game, he gets to leave behind Anaheim Stadium and the pursuit 
of the Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as them catching Oakland, I really don't see them making up 10 games on 
a team like Oakland."

TAKING ISSUE WITH THE ISSUES;

ADMINISTRATORS TACKLE THE PROBLEMS FACING PREP SPORTS;

<P>
There is more to high school athletics than game-winning touchdowns, 
last-second baskets and state championships. As the California Interscholastic 
Federation (CIF) and the Southern Section continue to grow, so does the number 
of issues facing high school administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Sportsmanship, violence, drug testing, open enrollment, growth and summer 
participation are among the many issues school administrators are currently 
dealing with. How are administrators dealing with crowd control? How effective 
is voluntary drug testing? Is summer participation contributing to athletic 
burnout? How realistic is open enrollment? What are the consequences of it? 
</P>
<P>
The Times Orange County prep staff posed these and other questions to Stan 
Thomas, Southern Section commissioner of athletics; Tom Triggs, La Habra High 
School principal and Orange County representative to the Southern Section, and 
Margaret Davis, CIF associate commissioner of athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, the Southern Section commissioner since 1986, has held teaching and 
administrative positions at a variety of levels. He was a teacher, football 
coach, principal and assistant principal at Neff, Excelsior and Foothill high 
schools. Thomas has a bachelor of arts degree and a masters of education degree 
from Whittier College. 
</P>
<P>
Triggs has spent 28 years as a teacher, coach and administrator in Orange 
County schools. He is in his 10th year as principal at La Habra, where he also 
taught and coached tennis in the early 1960s. He is in his second year as 
Orange County area representative to the Southern Section. He earned his 
bachelor's degree in mathematics and masters' degree in education from Whittier 
College. 
</P>
<P>
Davis has worked for the state and Southern Section for 16 years and was 
largely responsible for organizing the girls' sports programs in the Southern 
Section in the early 1970s. She began her teaching and coaching career in 1970 
at Poway High School, where she was a physical education teacher, assistant 
athletic director, department chairwoman and girls' basketball and softball 
coach. She has a bachelor of arts degree in physical education from San Diego 
State and a masters' degree in educational administration from Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q. The Southern Section has taken some steps to solve the problem of violence 
in prep sports. What is the present plan to re-educate players, parents and 
coaches regarding sportsmanship and officials? 
</P>
<P>
A. Tom Triggs, who designed a package of rules to deter violence in the Freeway 
League: When you sit on the hearing panels, especially the ones that deal with 
violence, afterwards you always say, "That could happen at La Habra High 
School." Each of those registered in a very dramatic fashion in terms of my 
views of high school athletics. And I'm not alone in that. Principals I deal 
with in the Orange County section share the same concerns I have in terms of 
the escalation. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the communication I've received (about the Freeway League violence 
package) has been from other leagues in Orange County. I would say many of them 
are considering implementing similar rules that we have now in the Freeway 
League. I think you'll see similar rules come forth in the (Southern) Section. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Davis: It's statewide and nationwide (problem). Our general council 
has undertaken to write some language that is before the May council meeting 
(this weekend). Basically it says that any student who perpetrates, instigates, 
etc., a physical assault upon a person in a game or event official shall be 
banned from interscholastic activity for the remainder of the students' 
eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you have any reaction to this issue on a personal level? 
</P>
<P>
A. Triggs: I really didn't enjoy basketball games at the high school level this 
year. A lot of it has to do with that level of anxiety about what can happen in 
a gymnasium. They are very emotional young people, parents and players. I'm a 
fan of basketball, that's my favorite sport. But for me to sit in the 
gymnasium, and all I'm doing is watching the crowd and looking for signals of 
something that could happen, has distracted me from watching the game. 
</P>
<P>
I really had concerns about opening the sports section Saturday morning and 
reading about the next incident. I didn't look forward to that, but it was sort 
of on a regular basis. These things were popping up on Friday nights. That just 
has no place in high school athletics. One of the primary functions for school 
administrators, athletic directors and staff now is to look for possible 
violence that could take place. And that takes away from the enjoyment of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is there anything the CIF can do to attack the violence at the source? Do 
you know what the source is? What's causing the difference in attitude and 
behavior? 
</P>
<P>
A. Triggs: There are a number of reasons why this has come about. One has to do 
with the interest. There's heightened interest on behalf of parents and 
students in athletics. Then, our young people see things happening in the 
college and professional ranks and think it's OK to do that at the high school 
level. 
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, there are fewer teachers in the officials pool of candidates. We went 
through a declining mode in our school district; we went a number of years 
where we hired no coaches or teachers. That has had a bearing on this. When you 
bring in the walk-on (coaches), they're not trained in terms of working with 
kids and that has contributed to this. 
</P>
<P>
Davis: The (state) CIF would like to target the coaches. We have a proposed 
certification program being discussed. It will help all people employed as 
coaches to be prepared in working with youngsters in a healthy way -- in a 
safe, caring environment. Part of the curriculum will be in crowd control, 
youth psychology and teaching techniques that could assist the walk-ons in 
particular. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Thomas: The overriding response to the question rides with the role model 
of the coaches. When you see coaches who are completely under control in the 
most stressful and adverse conditions, so is their team. When you see coaches 
who are yelling and screaming and challenging the officials, so is their team 
and so is the crowd. . . . It all begins with the coach on the field and the 
behavior that coach demonstrates to the players as well as the crowd. Any time 
you have a riot, at least the ones we've dealt with this year, and we've had a 
whole bunch of them, it generally became an issue where the coach lost control. 
</P>
<P>
There lies the problem in my opinion. 
</P>
<P>
. . . We need to have more instruction because we have fewer staff coaches and 
more walk-on coaches than we ever (had). That trend isn't going to change, it's 
going to get greater. 
</P>
<P>
We are training coaches, and the training is outstanding. The best people are 
being brought together through the auspices of the Amateur Athletic Foundation. 
We are currently (partners) with them in a program that will include Los 
Angeles City, San Diego, and the Southern Section in boys' and girls' soccer, 
more than 700 schools. We've just completed a soccer program with more than 100 
schools. We're entering a complete training program with boys' and girls' track 
with more than 100 schools. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Numerous incidents this year involved crowds. Is there anything you can do 
to stop a crowd from getting out of hand before it happens, instead of reacting 
to it? 
</P>
<P>
A. Triggs: We'll (the Freeway League schools) have sessions in September 
involving parents, students, activity directors in terms of better defining the 
role that they play. The yell leaders have pretty much become performers. I 
think they can play a very important part in crowd control along with our 
campus supervisors and administrators and working with booster groups. It's a 
perfect topic to have with them. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What can be done about the declining number of officials? Does this pose a 
significant problem? 
</P>
<P>
A. Thomas: I can assure you without a question that the next major issue we're 
going to deal with will be the officials. An official today is no longer the 
school person who works all day and then goes out and does a game. It's the 
other way around. Ninety percent of them used to be school people. Today, only 
10% of them are school people. Ninety percent of our officials today are 
firemen, lawyers, stockbrokers and salesmen. 
</P>
<P>
They're (from) every walk of life, and they're starting to count on the money 
that they earn as income in order to live. They're becoming a more militant 
group of people within the Southern Section. I've already had two major escapes 
with officials saying they were going to withhold services. When our next 
negotiating contract comes up (this is the first of three years) our schools 
have reached the level of payment that I think is fair, it's stretching their 
(Associated Student Body) accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Today we spend, in the Southern Section alone, $2.5 million a year just for the 
services of officials. We're talking boys' and girls' (events). If you continue 
to pay the officials the way we are now, you're going to have a lot of 
officials. We have some shortages in some sports, we just need to separate the 
days of the week for contests so we can maximize them. The hardest time to get 
an official is in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Q. There are currently two measures in the state senate calling for wholesale 
open enrollment throughout California. How would you see open enrollment 
affecting sports? 
</P>
<P>
A. Davis: I have a response from my boss (Tom Byrnes). He said the job of the 
CIF is to adjust our program to what is best educationally. If open enrollment 
is best, the CIF will adjust. He says, however, our legislative advocate has 
made it clear to the authors of those two bills that the CIF's basic transfer 
rule would be preserved. And should be preserved. And that nothing should 
preclude the CIF from exercising its transfer rule. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas: I would not perceive this to be something whereby a youngster would 
play football at (school) A, move over and play basketball at B, then baseball 
at C, then start that all over again. 
</P>
<P>
Q. The public school vs. private school issue heated up again (April 26) at the 
general council meeting. Is it inevitable that we will have a merger of the 
public and private schools in 1992, in the next releaguing cycle, and do you 
anticipate an outcry on the part of the public schools? 
</P>
<P>
A. Triggs: The Orange County principals are pretty much in place in opposition 
to that. And I don't see that changing in terms to their views. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas: Throughout the Southern Section, we have every type of cross-section of 
leaguing you can think of. We have public and Catholic. Catholic and public. 
Private and public. We have every opportunity within the section to share what 
is best. 
</P>
<P>
Q. But we don't have that in Orange County. Why? 
</P>
<P>
A. Triggs: There have been schools that have been in public leagues in Orange 
County for a sport or two. So we have had relationships. It comes down to 
football and basketball mainly -- that's what's at issue. 
</P>
<P>
Davis: I just want to add that the trend in the state is to mix the schools. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you think that's healthy? 
</P>
<P>
A. Davis: Yes, I do, personally. Recently, the (North Coast Section) broke up 
an all-Catholic league and mixed them up (with Public). 
</P>
<P>
Q. We have a hard time seeing the public schools (in Orange County) welcoming 
these schools with open arms. Aren't there going to be some lukewarm feelings? 
</P>
<P>
A. Davis: Well, change does come hard. I think it will be worked out. It has 
(been worked out) in other areas. The merger occurred. It seems to be working 
now. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you see the use of anabolic steroids as a major concern heading into the 
'90s? Is there a chance drug testing will become a part of high school sports 
the way it is with the NCAA and pro leagues? 
</P>
<P>
A. Triggs: I think we'll see an increase in drug testing. Part of the problem 
is the financing of it, especially the steroid test. You're talking about $85 
per test. In our school district, the Fullerton district, we're considering 
testing for next year. One of the things we're groping with is the financing of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
But there's an interest. Every school that's involved with it now sees it as a 
deterrent. It's giving students an opportunity to say to their peers, "There's 
a possibility I will be tested." 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are you worried about the legal ramifications of drug testing? 
</P>
<P>
A. Triggs: Yes. In fact, the testing companies have that same concern. The 
schools that have become involved in voluntary testing have had little 
involvement. It's voluntary, first of all. And secondly, the results are given 
to the parent. The school has no involvement other than providing a program. 
</P>
<P>
A. Thomas: Currently, we have schools testing on a voluntary basis. Fontana was 
the exception, starting out on a mandatory program. A lawyer from the (American 
Civil Liberties Union) came over and did a number on them. 
</P>
<P>
I would predict, in the very near future, as soon as we get over this rights of 
privacy, as soon as we can get past that, then I would think a legislator would 
have some pretty good success mandating drug testing within high schools for 
all activities. 
</P>
<P>
It's done everywhere. It's done in college, pros, the federal government. 
Almost everywhere we go today we see drug testing. 
</P>
<P>
So we're getting to the point where rights of privacy are being set aside. 
(High school athletics) is voluntary. You don't have to do it. If you want to 
participate, you're going to be tested. It's a wonderful thing to have. It 
could be a real deterrent to the drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
(Drug abuse) is an issue, an issue we need not to turn our heads away from. An 
issue we need to face squarely and deal with to try to correct it. 
</P>
<P>
A. Davis: Our state executive council has targeted steroids as an issue of 
major concern. Our medical adviser has already addressed the council at its 
last meeting. He is currently studying an action plan. I would anticipate some 
plan would come out (in the fall). 
</P>
<P>
Q. Drug testing, where it exists, is voluntary and schools do not learn the 
results but the parents do. What effect does this have? 
</P>
<P>
A. Thomas: The key thing is, what I've been told -- and Edison is the primary 
leader in this whole voluntary drug testing process -- the kids are so proud of 
being clean they put it (their test results) right on the (Edison athletic 
department) bulletin board. They take that thing when it comes back and says 
"No Trace" and put it right on that bulletin board. And that puts a lot of 
pressure on everybody else. 
</P>
<P>
(They can say) "Where's yours? I want to see yours." Peer pressure is a 
tremendous thing. It gives the kids a chance to say, "I might be tested." It 
gives them an out. It's great. 
</P>
<P>
Q. With congestion on the freeways, growth in the desert areas in Riverside and 
San Bernardino counties, is the Southern Section too big? Isn't it time for a 
change? Isn't it time to split it into smaller sections? 
</P>
<P>
A. Thomas: Six or seven years ago, there was a consideration on the part of the 
state to re-section. And a committee did an exhaustive study. And the vote was 
close, but it was to maintain the status quo. That was probably the closest 
we've come to it. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Tom, why don't you explain what happened with a study undertaken by an 
Orange County group? Tell us the positives and negatives of being part of a big 
section. 
</P>
<P>
A. Triggs: George Allen, the principal at Esperanza, chaired the group. We 
brought the principals of Orange County together. There wasn't the support to 
continue the study. The satisfaction with the current operation is there. I 
would say the strong financial base of the Southern Section has a lot to do 
with it. There are a lot of question marks if we had an Orange County Section 
as far as the costs. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, and these are not necessarily my views, but they were 
expressed, the concept of local control (is an issue). Another issue would be 
the nature of Orange County and there is corporate sponsorship that would 
assist. And the obvious one about congestion and transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Q. It seems like a lot of problems are coming from summer sports competition 
and the lack of control over same. There doesn't seem to be anyone who wants to 
step forward and monitor it. 
</P>
<P>
A. Thomas: Recently, a survey of all California superintendents was taken 
requesting data on summer sports and one of the most interesting suggestions 
was establishing a fourth season of sport. The CIF should take a hard look at a 
fourth season. I know the state office is against that. 
</P>
<P>
A. Triggs: I would like to cut the string for the summer. And that we have no 
contact with the students and coaches. That would be my preference. I don't 
think we need another season of sport. We see our young people being taxed now 
in terms of what they're doing. Some youngsters participate in three sports and 
their nights are tied up. And they're hitting the weights and I think that's an 
overemphasis. There has to be a time for the family. I believe that so much. 
There has to be a time for parents and children to have some time together. But 
when they are driving their young person each night of the week to some type of 
event dealing with athletics, we're a little off base. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Don't you think coaches should say to parents, "Yes, you can take a summer 
vacation and your kid will still have a chance to play on the team next 
season"? 
</P>
<P>
A. Triggs: I think we have coaches that are saying that. I would say most 
coaches are saying that. The problem we have is when we have a three-sport 
athlete, who is having to make decisions, which is hard. I have a lot of 
trouble with the summer situation because I've seen what has happened to 
families. When a young person enters high school, many parents strongly feel 
their son (or daughter) is going to get an athletic scholarship. And that (the 
earning of the scholarship) is going to be the solution to all the problems in 
this family. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Isn't there something wrong when summer basketball people are paid high 
amounts of money from athletic shoe companies at the cost to a lot of families' 
time? 
</P>
<P>
A. Thomas: We have, in Orange County right now, several schools who will 
compete, say, in the sport of basketball in the summer in excess of 40 
contests. Our rule of (regular) season contests is 20. They will more than 
double the number of contests because there are no limitations. I think of all 
the sports, basketball is the biggest abuser. There are so many tournaments and 
so many games. And, it's not a casual pickup game where you have fun. Winning 
is important. Losing is not accepted. 
</P>
<P>
The same with some people who get into these crazy (football) passing leagues. 
It becomes almost like a league contest. And I know some of the best football 
coaches in our section -- Dick Bruich out at Fontana, Ted Mullen, who used to 
be here in Orange County -- their summer activity in football was laid-back. 
Dick Bruich won't go to a passing league. Ted Mullen won't go to a passing 
league. These people are as good coaches as the Southern Section has ever 
produced. We have others that are going two and three times a week. And the 
kids are getting hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere we have to say enough is enough and bring it back to a position where 
it's best for our kids. 
</P>
<P>
Q. But you understand the rationale of coach A, who says if I'm not doing it 
and coach B is, then he has a competitive edge? 
</P>
<P>
A. Thomas: But Bruich disproves that theory. Bruich's idea of a summer program 
is to lift (weights) and to get to know everyone. If he gets through the summer 
on that basis, he's achieved his goal. Then he goes out and kicks everyone's 
butt. 
</P>
<P>
It's a craziness. I don't subscribe to that philosophy that we have to compete 
during the summer in order to be the best in the fall. There's more to life 
than first and 10. You do have to put it into perspective. It's up to us to 
give that direction, I think.

PHEBUS COLLECTS KEY POINTS, TITLE

<P>
Keri Phebus swept past Jennifer Baker, 7-6, 6-2, to win the 18-and-under 
division of the Seventeen Magazine Tennis Tournament of Champions Saturday at 
the Marguerite Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
And then she called herself lucky. 
</P>
<P>
"I just . . . won all the key points," said Phebus, a 16-year-old sophomore at 
Corona del Mar High School. "It happened in a lot of my matches." 
</P>
<P>
Rest assured, however, talent played a large part in Phebus' victory, her 
second consecutive Seventeen title. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, a 17-year-old from Wesley Chapel, Ohio, gave Phebus fits in the first 
set with a barrage of short shots. Phebus said it was a far different game than 
the baseline players she had faced in earlier rounds. 
</P>
<P>
There also were other obstacles to clear Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Phebus' serve, strong though rarely overpowering, was off the mark early in the 
match. She had seven double faults in the first set. 
</P>
<P>
Further, she said she felt sluggish from the semifinals and quarterfinals held 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I was having trouble just moving," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Phebus, who dropped the first two games, rallied. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, having broken Phebus' serve, was leading, 5-4, and serving for the first 
set when Phebus snapped out of her lethargy. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I had to buckle down and start winning some key points," she said. "I 
was really lucky that whole match." 
</P>
<P>
Phebus went up, 6-5, but Baker forced a tiebreaker. From that point on, Phebus 
overwhelmed her opponent. 
</P>
<P>
She won the tiebreaker, 7-4, then blitzed Baker with a stream of passing shots 
she couldn't return in the second set. 
</P>
<P>
"I started playing better once I got used to playing her style of game," said 
Phebus, who won the 16s title at the Tournament of Champions last year. "My 
serve in the first set was worse than terrible. When my serve's not working, 
everything else falls apart." 
</P>
<P>
She began serving better, double faulting once in the second set, and Baker 
seemed defenseless. 
</P>
<P>
Phebus, who turned 16 Wednesday, said she will next turn her attention to the 
Junior Nationals 18s in August at San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
Two other finals were decided Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The 14s final featured a cross-town battle between Palos Verdes residents 
Lindsay Davenport and Janet Lee with Davenport, the top seeded player, winning, 
7-6, 6-1. In the 16s, Jill Craybas of East Greenwich, R.I., defeated Ditta 
Huber of La Jolla, 6-0, 6-1.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For thousands of low-income Latinos, Jose Manuel de la Jara burst on to the 
scene as a modern-day messiah promising to transport his own kind into 
middle-class comfort and a life free of financial concerns. 
</P>
<P>
On Spanish-speaking television and radio, De la Jara repeatedly broadcast his 
message of hope -- he knew a way to earn a 22% annual rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
Guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
De la Jara's Santa Ana-based American Finance and Investment Group (Inversiones 
Y Finanzas Americanas) claimed it was buying real estate around Southern 
California and it was looking for partners. 
</P>
<P>
The company's salespeople said de la Jara knew what he was doing. He was, they 
said, a rich businessman from Peru. He had a couple of Mercedeses and a big 
house in Costa Mesa. And he wanted to spread the wealth. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a Latino and he was getting ahead, so I figured I could too," Los 
Angeles investor Jose Espinosa De Los Monteros said through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
Federal and state authorities now say IFA was nothing more than a 
well-contrived scam, the largest ever perpetrated on the Latino community in 
Southern California. De la Jara, they say, operated a Ponzi scheme through IFA 
in order to enrich himself from March, 1988, through September, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
So far, a state-appointed receiver -- who is selling off de la Jara's estate -- 
has identified 700 investors who have lost more than $8.2 million. Most of the 
money has vanished. 
</P>
<P>
The victims are nearly all working-class people, scattered around Southern 
California. Very few speak English. 
</P>
<P>
"People are in financial ruins," said Carlos Negrete, a San Juan Capistrano 
attorney representing several victims. "I don't know of one family that wasn't 
literally devastated by it." 
</P>
<P>
De la Jara is now under investigation by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles on 
bank and mail fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators say he wasn't the godsend he seemed. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, de la Jara is wanted by Interpol -- the international police 
agency -- for misappropriation and swindling in his native Peru. Police there 
say he carried out a scheme similar to IFA, bilking Peruvian investors out of 
$7 million in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Besides being an alleged con artist, federal authorities claim de la Jara 
launders money for associates of Colombia's Medellin drug cartel. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, he was convicted in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on 
money-laundering charges. The prosecution introduced into evidence scores of 
documents seized from de la Jara's home and business, including a notebook full 
of names and telephone numbers of known narcotics traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
De la Jara, 44, is currently being held at Metropolitan Detention Center in Los 
Angeles. He refused to be interviewed for this story, but in the past has 
denied the charges against him. He has said he is an honest businessman, forced 
out of Peru because of threats against his life. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, de la Jara and his son were kidnaped in Lima by the feared Los 
Retacos gang of brothers -- Peru's version of Jesse and Frank James -- who 
strapped dynamite to de la Jara's chest and threatened to blow him up unless 
his well-to-do family paid them $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The family handed over the ransom and then fled to the United States, where de 
la Jara eventually started IFA. He has used as many as 10 aliases in the last 
three years, something he says was necessary to stay one step ahead of his 
kidnapers. 
</P>
<P>
"This entire case is very Alice in Wonderland," concluded state Department of 
Corporations attorney Dorene B. Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
Catalina Torres came to this country from Mexico in 1977. Even though she earns 
only about $200 a week sewing garments 10 hours a day, Torres and her husband 
had managed to put away $40,000 in savings. 
</P>
<P>
In late 1988, the South-Central Los Angeles couple were notified that the 
building they live in is going to be demolished at the end of this year. Torres 
decided it was time they bought a house, but she figured they needed more money 
first. 
</P>
<P>
While watching Spanish-language KMEX Channel 34, Torres saw an ad for IFA. The 
company was guaranteeing a 22% interest rate -- not as much as the 40% you can 
earn in inflation-plagued Mexico, but pretty good nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
She paid a visit to the company's East Los Angeles office and met with a 
salesman. 
</P>
<P>
"I went there and I spoke to him before I gave him the money and he told me 
they were a company that had been in business 25 years," Torres said through an 
interpreter. "He said the money was going to be safe." 
</P>
<P>
She invested $40,000 in January of 1989 and has apparently lost it all. Now the 
Torreses aren't sure where they and their two children are going to live after 
their apartment building is destroyed. "You can't imagine how I feel," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal and state investigators say her experience is typical of those who 
passed through IFA. 
</P>
<P>
The company told investors they would earn very high interest on money loaned 
to IFA, which would be secured by trust deeds on one of 16 different properties 
the company had acquired around Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
People invested anywhere from $1,000 to $300,000 -- the average loan was about 
$40,000. The company had promised to give trust deeds on the properties to 
anybody loaning IFA more than $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Corporations claims IFA sought loans on the same 
properties over and over again and then issued numerous trust deeds on the same 
house. On de la Jara's Costa Mesa home, for instance, county records show there 
are eight people holding trust deeds. They had invested close to $280,000 
collectively. 
</P>
<P>
Some trust deeds were actually recorded with county officials and a few deeds 
were allegedly issued on property IFA didn't own, according to state 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
"By having a trust deed, investors thought, 'I have a secured interest in a 
property,' not realizing that if it's not recorded it's not worthless but close 
to it," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Carolyn Kubota. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, early investors in IFA didn't suspect anything was wrong because 
monthly interest was paid on time. But state officials say that was because de 
la Jara was running a Ponzi scheme -- paying earlier investors with the money 
provided by new investors. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo National Bank claims in a lawsuit against de la Jara that he 
duped it into loaning him around $1 million by using 11 of the 16 properties as 
collateral. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny institution said title searches showed numerous owners of each 
property but that de la Jara provided them with full reconveyances -- which 
state officials now say were forged -- showing IFA owned the property outright. 
</P>
<P>
State examiners now say De la Jara needed those loans from Mission Viejo to 
keep IFA afloat. 
</P>
<P>
Just where all of the money has gone is something of a mystery, particularly 
because IFA failed to keep its books up to date. The raid on de la Jara's home 
and IFA headquarters did produce documents showing he had opened several 
offshore bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
He paid $29,500 to the government of Montserrat to operate International 
Hispanic Bank of North America in the British West Indies. And he had an 
account with St. Gallische Kantonal Bank in Switzerland. Both institutions 
refuse to provide any information to U.S. authorities. 
</P>
<P>
State auditors say they know IFA took in at least $14.7 million, but only about 
$500,000 in cash and $2.6 million in real estate were remaining last September 
when law enforcement officials raided the company. 
</P>
<P>
"The defendant had cleaned out the bank accounts pretty well before we got 
there," Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
IFA allegedly commingled investor funds, which were used to pay some of de la 
Jara's personal expenses, according to the state audits. 
</P>
<P>
"He misappropriated investor funds for personal use, ran no legitimate 
income-producing enterprise and utilized funds of later investors to pay off 
the earlier investors," said state appointed receiver Gilbert Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
Jorge Palomino said he was so upset about losing his money he hired a private 
detective to track down de la Jara. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't any happier when he discovered de la Jara was in a U.S. jail. 
</P>
<P>
Palomino is one of hundreds of investors in Peru who claim de la Jara fled to 
the United States with funds they had invested in his first investment company, 
International Money Market of Lima. 
</P>
<P>
The Florida Department of Banking and Finance says it has received about a 
dozen complaints from Peruvians saying de la Jara had millions of dollars in 
investments transferred to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"They had purchased what they believed were certificates of deposit in Peru," 
said Florida banking investigator Morgan Cronin. "Mr. de la Jara had a lot of 
those funds transferred into Florida banks." 
</P>
<P>
Cronin said his department is investigating de la Jara with the U.S. Attorney's 
office in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Palomino, a rare-book dealer, says he lost $50,000 to de la Jara. 
</P>
<P>
"He has an ambition to get money," Palomino said through an interpreter. "He 
had very nice houses (in Peru) and he always flaunted his money." 
</P>
<P>
Because de la Jara has used so many aliases and has admitted moving from place 
to place, his background is a bit blurry. 
</P>
<P>
He was born on Sept. 17, 1945, somewhere in Peru. He became wealthy there at 
least in part from exchanging inte, the Peruvian currency, for U.S. dollars. He 
has testified in court in Los Angeles that he ran one of his country's largest 
currency-exchange businesses, Picaref S.A. ($30-million annual revenue, U.S. 
dollars). 
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian government nationalized its banking system in 1987 and Picaref was 
shut down. 
</P>
<P>
De la Jara has said Interpol's issuance of an arrest warrant against him is 
wholly politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
"The Peruvian government instigated a series of administrative and judicial 
proceedings to discredit Mr. de la Jara and his business affairs in Peru," his 
wife, Maria Ledesma, said in a court filing. 
</P>
<P>
De la Jara moved to Miami the same year Picaref closed and opened an 
International Money Market branch there. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors claim de la Jara was already laundering drug money at this 
point, out of Miami and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Internal Revenue Service first noticed in the summer of 1987 that de la 
Jara -- using the name Jose O. Fernandez -- was depositing hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in Southern California banks in increments of less than 
$10,000. Federal law requires cash transactions of more than $10,000 to be 
reported to the U.S. Treasury Department. 
</P>
<P>
 During de la Jara's money-laundering trial, a former associate testified the 
two men drove around Southern California in August, 1987, with a paper bag in 
the trunk containing $126,000. They made deposits at 16 different branches of 
Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
De la Jara's attorney, public defender Lupe Martinez, told jurors his client 
didn't want the money to be detected for fear it would be seized by Peruvian 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
But Assistant U.S. Atty. Karin Immergut said de la Jara was laundering drug 
money and showed jurors a notebook in his handwriting which contained detailed 
information about narcotics traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Among the entries was this one about two traffickers: "They have contact with 
fishermen who transport the drug from the Islands that are close to Miami in 
the Bahamas Zone. They work for one of Pablo Escobar's trusted men in Miami. He 
goes by the name of Jerry . . . This guy, Jerry, is a very dangerous man." 
Escobar has been identified by U.S. officials as chief of the Medellin drug 
cartel. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the descriptions were so detailed they included information such as 
what kind of car a particular trafficker was driving. 
</P>
<P>
"Luis drives a Chevette, light blue with dark blue doors. . . . He supplies 
weapons to the Colombian guerrillas in exchange for drugs," the entry read. 
</P>
<P>
Immergut then showed jurors what she said were payoff ledgers, which contain 
the names of many of the same traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
"There were references to kilograms and amounts that appeared to correspond to 
kilogram prices of cocaine," Immergut said. "He said they were currency 
exchange rates." 
</P>
<P>
De la Jara said he had gotten in contact with the narcotics traffickers because 
he thought they could help him catch his kidnapers. 
</P>
<P>
"He was looking for these people to help him look for those individuals who had 
kidnaped him and were hiding out in Colombia," said IRS special agent Ray 
Rivera, who has interviewed de la Jara. "His rationale for that was that the 
only ones with power in Colombia are the drug traffickers." 
</P>
<P>
To cement a case against de la Jara, the Internal Revenue Service conducted a 
sting operation against him last year. Federal agents wanted to get him on tape 
agreeing to launder supposed drug money. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo in Glendora agreed to employ an undercover IRS agent as a personal 
banker and within six months he had befriended de la Jara. Agent Oscar Garcia 
soon approached de la Jara about laundering some money, supposedly from drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"De la Jara answered that that was not a problem. He said that in today's world 
there are few businesses that are not involved in something illegal," according 
to an IRS affidavit. "De la Jara discussed de la Jara's ability to get money 
into various South and Central American countries. De la Jara indicated that 
Colombia was a problem; Venezuela was fine but Costa Rica was better." 
</P>
<P>
De la Jara was convicted April 24 on three of the four money-laundering charges 
stemming from that undercover operation. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS agent brought in an undercover investigator from the Drug Enforcement 
Administration, who told de la Jara he was a narcotics trafficker whose main 
business was selling chemicals used to make cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"On Aug. 8, 1989, de la Jara stated that he was interested in obtaining ether" 
used in processing of cocaine paste, the affidavit claims. And later -- 
according to the affidavit -- de la Jara "suggested that maybe he could help 
with the selling of the cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
But later "de la Jara informed the undercover agent that he currently did not 
have a customer for the cocaine and suggested that the cocaine deal be put on 
the back burner for now. De la Jara told the undercover agent that the people 
he spoke with were distrustful of people they did not know." 
</P>
<P>
Exactly one week before Christmas last year, state-appointed receivers Gilbert 
Vasquez and Oscar Gamez met with about 600 families in the auditorium at East 
Los Angeles College. One by one, victims approached the microphone and pleaded 
to get their money back. One man said if he was only going to get one penny on 
the dollar he wanted to get that one penny now. 
</P>
<P>
State officials say they don't know how much -- if anything at all -- can be 
returned to investors. For many, the damage is already done. 
</P>
<P>
Alfonso Garcia, 44, owned two small houses in Orange County and took out 
mortgages on both thinking he could increase his income. The mortgages were at 
10% or 11% and IFA was supposedly paying 22%. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana resident lost $120,000 and is now having trouble keeping up with 
his mortgage payments even though he and his wife are working an extra eight 
hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
But he says the worst thing of all was deciding he had no choice but to sell 
his childhood home in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"My father bought that house when he was very young, even before he got 
married," Garcia said through an interpreter. "In my life and in all of my 
family's life this is a big disaster." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATION INTO AMERICAN INVESTMENTS (IFA) 
</P>
<P>
The company's records included a listing of the 16 properties used as 
collateral for trust deeds issued to investors. In most cases, the amount owed 
to investors exceeds the cost of the property. Although trust deeds totaling 
$3.6 million were issued, state appointed receiver said other records indicate 
that the total "invested" was closer to $8.2 million.

Bob Newhart, Mary Frann, Tom Poston, Julia Duffy and Peter Scolari take their 
final bow May 21 in the series finale of "Newhart." In the 184th and final 
episode, Dick Loudon staunchly refuses to sell the Stratford Inn to a Japanese 
investor. Everyone else in town clears out, and the inn's weathered clapboards 
are soon being pelted with golf balls, as the structure becomes a hazard on the 
14th fairway of the Tagadachiville Hotel and Country Club's golf course.

CBS DEATH WISH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are times when it seems that "60 Minutes," as brought to us by CBS, must 
have some sort of unconscious death wish. On April 15, this same outfit which 
damned itself in the Andy Rooney affair chose to give its viewers a Jewish 
segment on Easter Sunday, of all days. 
</P>
<P>
We are not religious, but we would feel it the poorest of taste for TV to be 
bringing us a dope-in-the-slums program on the birthday of Martin Luther King. 
We would think it a tasteless failure if "60 Minutes" brought us a segment on 
the failure of the Latino parent on Cinco de Mayo. Is there no racial or 
religious sensitivity at this network?

CASTING CALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a viewer devoted to KCET and video feature films, I took some heart with the 
debut of "Twin Peaks" on network television. 
</P>
<P>
The series is mature, artistic and engaging. There is only one point with which 
I would quibble. 
</P>
<P>
With casting directors having achieved the professional pinnacle that calls for 
full screen credit and, thus, presumed heightened expertise, why do they cast 
actors who appear to be in their 20s in roles calling for the late teens of 
high school? The otherwise splendid film, "Dead Poet's Society," suffered from 
this identical flaw.

Excuse me, but I thought this was a free society. I didn't know that Judy 
Garland had a monopoly on "Over the Rainbow." Toni Jacobson's (Viewers' Views, 
April 15) statement that Diana Ross had no business at the Academy Awards was 
really a pitiful statement.

COVER STORY: THE FUN TIMES OF ABC'S 'WONDER' KID FRED SAVAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Daniel Cerone 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first team to score 10 wins, and Fred Savage's outsized teammates had nine 
points, plus possession of the basketball. Lunch was winding down on the set of 
"The Wonder Years," where Kevin Arnold's real-life alter ego was engaged in a 
sweaty game of hoops against some of the bigger, taller crew members. 
</P>
<P>
Fred tossed the ball in bounds to his geeky friend on the show, Paul Pfeiffer, 
played by Josh Saviano. Gone were the dork eyeglasses and awkward manner, as 
Saviano eyed the court with sharp eyes, smoothly dribbled between two defenders 
and whipped the basketball back to a wide-open Fred. From 15 feet out, Fred 
launched the ball from his chest and swished it through the rim for the game 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
"That's all she wrote!" the 13-year-old shouted, high-fiving the players. 
</P>
<P>
A crew member poked his head onto the court, dampening the celebration. "Fred, 
they want you on the set for makeup." 
</P>
<P>
"I got to go, guys," Fred said. "We'll play again tomorrow. That was fun." 
</P>
<P>
Fun. An innocent little three-letter word that's not often associated with 
anyone who works in the entertainment industry these days. But it seems to be 
the key word in Fred's life, and his favorite word in interviews. Try to ask 
Fred a driving question, and he's more likely to buckle over in laughter than 
buckle under the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Fred, you're so young. Why do you work so hard? Who do you do it for? 
</P>
<P>
"I do it for fun," he said with a wide-eyed smile that served as a punctuation 
mark. "I mean, my parents don't force me to act. As soon as it stops being fun, 
then I'll stop acting." 
</P>
<P>
There's a common belief that kid actors sprout too fast and skip the 
nourishment of childhood. If childhood is supposed to be a good time, then Fred 
is not missing out on anything. His life is a fun zone. Whether he's bounding 
across stage to accept a People's Choice Award, jiving with Arsenio Hall or 
scrunching his face as the niece of Dana Carvey's "Church Lady" on "Saturday 
Night Live," Fred is having the time of his life. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, everything that I'm doing, whether it's Jay Leno or an awards show, 
it's all fun," Fred reiterated from inside his cramped dressing room, where he 
spoke in between large mouthfuls of tortilla chips and spicy guacamole. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the whole reason I got into acting. I don't do this like some grown-ups 
have to do it, because they have families, and they have to make money. It's 
not my job. My dad works to support our family. So I just do it for fun. When 
I'm asked to do something, I have to think, 'Well, will that be fun?' Because 
if it's fun, then I'll do it. 
</P>
<P>
"I make most of my decisions on the basis of . . ." -- he paused for a moment 
to fight down some guacamole that was working its way back up his windpipe, and 
burped out the last word -- "fun." He turned red and started laughing. "Sorry." 
</P>
<P>
"The Wonder Years," in its third year now, has been a consistent Top 10 ratings 
hit for ABC. The series shot 23 original episodes this season, the last one 
airing later this month. In each nostalgic episode, Fred serves as a 
pre-adolescent tour guide for adults, grabbing their hands and hearts and 
leading them through the joys and sorrows of growing up in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
"A school dance, your first pimple, your first kiss -- those are pretty real 
experiences," Fred said. "That's what makes the show so popular. Adults come up 
to me all the time and say, 'You know that show, that's exactly what happened 
to me.' And then the kids are watching, because they're going through it now. 
Whether it's 1970, 1990 or 2010, kids will be going through the same 
experiences." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, not all kids go through the experiences Fred does. Instead of 
schoolchildren teasing him about a girl he might like, Fred receives his barbs 
from national tabloids and teen magazines. "I was on 'Arsenio Hall,' and he 
asked me who my favorite musicians were," Fred said. "Paula Abdul was the only 
girl I listed. So the tabloids started writing about my love affair with Paula 
Abdul; that I was contemplating suicide because she wouldn't go out with me." 
</P>
<P>
Fred suddenly grew serious. "I've gotten over her though. I'm moving on now." 
He smiled. 
</P>
<P>
Joanne Savage, Fred's mother, tries to keep her son's growing popularity in 
check. She recently turned down a cover story for Newsweek because she believed 
it was just too much publicity for the young Savage. "If they ever start a 
class on mothering an actor, I'll be the first to sign up," she said. "Fred 
gets requests all the time to do parades, schools, talk shows and interviews. 
He's extremely giving with his time, but you have to be realistic." 
</P>
<P>
After an exhaustive nine-month shooting schedule, which often involved 10 to 12 
hours a day on the set, Fred now has a brief three-month window to enjoy the 
summer before production begins next season. Last summer, Fred had a starring 
role in "The Wizard," a sort of adolescent version of "Rain Man" that didn't do 
well in theaters. This summer, he's taking a break. 
</P>
<P>
"Since he worked so hard this season, he's going to take this summer off," his 
mother said. "He just wants to spend time with the family." Fred has a younger 
brother, Ben, who is a regular on the Robert Mitchum sitcom, "A Family for 
Joe," and a younger sister who also acts. 
</P>
<P>
When asked what he planned to do over the summer, Fred smiled brightly and 
raised his eyebrows without missing a beat. "I'm going to have fun."

ARCHIE MAKES A MOVIE FOR NBC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan King 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Archie: To Riverdale and Back Again," the first live-action movie based on the 
characters from the popular Archie comic books, airs Sunday at 9 p.m. on NBC. 
Michael Silberkleit, the publisher and chairman of Archie Comic Publications 
Inc., talked about Archie and his colorful history with Susan King. 
</P>
<P>
 Why has it taken so long for Archie to become a live-action film? 
</P>
<P>
We started on TV in 1969 with the animated show and were on for seven years, 
and have tried over the years to get people interested in doing a live Archie 
show. Unfortunately, there were other properties that were hotter. There was 
more interest in adventure characters. But it's our turn. There's a movement 
back to nostalgia and away from violence. 
</P>
<P>
Were you reluctant to have Archie and the gang depicted as adults in their 30s? 
</P>
<P>
It would be silly for me to say that I wasn't. To me and to my partner (Richard 
Goldwater) and my son and people who work for us, Archie is a real live human 
being. He really exists. But people do grow up. Obviously, he's not going to 
take drugs, get drunk, break the law or molest children. It's still true to the 
Riverdale motif. It's still the same old Archie. We are not going to do 
anything to screw up the character. 
</P>
<P>
Why has Archie maintained its popularity over 49 years? 
</P>
<P>
Archie is everyman to everybody. He lives in middle America. Archie is who you 
wish you were but aren't. 
</P>
<P>
Have you kept Archie contemporary? 
</P>
<P>
By all means. Our writers are instructed to constantly read the latest 
magazines. Whatever is going on in the world will find itself into a story in 
some degree. Magazines carry public service messages on "Say No to Drugs." The 
Archie "Say No to Drugs" message is on over a billion-and-a-half milk cartons. 
We have addressed the AIDS situation and missing children in public service 
announcements. 
</P>
<P>
How many copies of Archie comics are sold yearly? 
</P>
<P>
We sell about 15 million a year. Some come out monthly and some come out every 
other month. We have about 40-50 different titles. We are constantly expanding 
our line. 
</P>
<P>
Kids really believe Archie lives because they call here and ask to speak to 
Archie. Sometimes I am Archie, and sometimes Richard is Archie, but we talk to 
them. We have an answering machine on the weekends, and then you can see how 
many kids call from all over -- I'm talking from South Africa, New Zealand and 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Are there any other Archie projects in the offing? 
</P>
<P>
I am working on an Archie fast-food restaurant. I want it to be healthy, low 
cholesterol, low-fat food. We have signed a licensing deal for a line of 
clothing for adults, and we signed an agreement with Warner Bros. to do a live 
feature like "Batman," but without the violence.

RERUNS TO RE-WATCH: DONNA DEAREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN FANTAZIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To most of Hilldale, Donna Stone is the perfect wife and mother. But those who 
watch her every move on Nickelodeon know that she can be a tyrant. 
</P>
<P>
Take the time she grounded the kids for disobeying her. Or when she made a 
thoughtless deliveryman go back and get the right item. Once she even got 
annoyed at daughter Mary for expecting her to make all her decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The only reason she isn't always a monster is that she's too busy keeping the 
house spotless, waiting on her husband and children, doing charity work and 
solving the community's problems. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't believe there is a dark side of Donna, just tune in to 
Nickelodeon's "The Donna Reed Show" marathon, which begins Sunday and runs 
through next Sunday-Mother's Day. This marathon isn't afraid to show Donna 
Dearest at her best and worst. The Donna-thon preempts regular Nick at Nite 
programming (from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m.). 
</P>
<P>
In some of her better moments this week, Donna will help out Buster Keaton 
(Tuesday at 2:30 a.m.), learn a lesson from trumpeter Harry James (Thursday at 
5:30 a.m.) and inspire singer Tony Martin (Saturday at 2:30 a.m.).

<TEXT>
<P>
So you've found the almost-perfect house: it's in the perfect location at the 
perfect price. The problem is that its floor plan gives you the blues. In that 
case, buying and remodeling it may be the answer. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that an increasing number of consumers are buying homes and 
remodeling them soon after they move in. If planning such a move, it's wise to 
take a realistic look at the costs involved. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are in fact buying older houses and may want to shape them to 
their own needs," said Michael O'Brien, a spokesman for Western Wood Products 
of Portland, Ore., which represents trade associations in 12 lumber-producing 
states. 
</P>

"If anything is contemporary, having a remodeling job done is. Remodeling is an 
incredibly booming industry," he said. Dumpsters "have become status symbols in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
The prices and scarcity of new homes are forcing would-be owners to consider 
older houses, O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
Census Bureau figures show that there are about 100 million residential homes 
in the United States, 60% of them 20 years old or more. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people do buy with (renovating) in mind and they do it very quickly after 
buying the house," said Ken Betz, editor of the Chicago-based Qualified 
Remodeler magazine, a trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
As a first step in deciding whether to buy a home to remodel, some experts 
advise hiring a private inspector or an experienced contractor to detail 
exactly what is needed and what it will cost. This can have several advantages. 
</P>
<P>
"It behooves a homeowner to look for someone with some professional credentials 
-- who has an office and can give some references -- to examine the house," 
Betz said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, buyers should have contracts drawn up "spelling out what will be 
done and what it will cost," Betz said. "We can't afford the informal handshake 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
An inspector can tell you whether costly systems such as the plumbing, heating, 
air conditioning, hot water or electrical units need replacing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Patchan, executive director of NAHB's remodeling council in Washington, 
advises buyers to have inspectors check for the presence of environmental and 
health hazards such as asbestos or radon gas, which can cause cancer, and 
lead-based paint, which can damage the nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
"All of those things are quite expensive to repair and can be found in a home 
built in 1950 or earlier," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Finances will dictate if a home's repair needs are too costly, Betz said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some problems that are so severe that it would be very costly and 
time-consuming to repair," he said. Buying a home with "major structural 
problems or problems like rot, termites and water damage" is often not 
advisable, according to Betz. 
</P>
<P>
But Patchan offers a different opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's say the house is in terrible shape and needs a lot of remodeling but the 
price is right. Then it might be a good investment if it's in a good 
neighborhood," he said. "It's always a good idea to know what you're buying. 
That's why inspectors are really advisable." 
</P>
<P>
An inspector's report also can be used to "negotiate on the price," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Studies show that new owners most often revamp their kitchens and bathrooms or 
add a family room or master bedroom. The cost, which can run as high as $15,000 
per room, should not put the house above the value of neighborhood homes. 
</P>
<P>
More money is spent on installation of insulating windows and doors, than any 
other remodeling project, Betz said, followed by kitchens, room additions and 
bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When you purchase a house, you're buying more than just the property. You're 
also "buying" a neighborhood and, along with that, neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
While there are a great many people who exist quite comfortably in 
neighborhoods they may not necessarily like, it is a great advantage to find a 
place that will appeal to you. If it does appeal to you, it likely will appeal 
to others, meaning that the value of the property will probably be stable, or 
possibly increase substantially through the years. 
</P>
<P>
Simply put, buying in a good neighborhood is like buying a blue-chip stock. 
</P>
<P>
But what makes a good neighborhood? Unfortunately, there's no one answer 
because in evaluating a neighborhood, everyone has different needs. But here 
are some factors to consider in your selection process: 
</P>
<P>
Do you need to be close to your work? Are you willing to commute? How long? 
</P>
<P>
Do you prefer the city, the suburbs or the country? 
</P>
<P>
Are there parts of a city that you find appealing -- places close to major 
parks, near a lot of restaurants you can walk to, near the best elementary 
school, far from the local college? 
</P>
<P>
Do you need to get away from it all when you come home from work? 
</P>
<P>
Is location even important? Would you be willing to live just about anywhere 
within reason, if it meant getting the right house? 
</P>
<P>
One obvious factor here is whether you have -- or are planning to have -- 
children. If so, you probably have some ideas about the kind of neighborhood or 
area in which you'd like them to grow up. 
</P>
<P>
How about public transportation? If you're older, or if you have children who 
need to take buses to school or other activities, this may be an important 
factor. 
</P>
<P>
Is it important for you to live near department stores, hospitals, parks, 
restaurants, schools, supermarkets or theaters? 
</P>
<P>
Once you have some neighborhoods or towns in mind, you should pay them a visit 
-- not just once, but several times. 
</P>
<P>
And don't just drive through. Get out of the car and walk around. Go into the 
local supermarket, eat at a local restaurant, check out a local drugstore, walk 
down the main street, ask questions of people in areas that interest you. 
</P>
<P>
You'll soon begin to get a feel for whether this area is really a good choice. 
</P>
<P>
In doing your research, you'll want to know not just what the neighborhood is 
like now, but where it is going. The neighborhood's future will have an effect 
on the value of a home and your ability to sell it later on. It will take more 
than just looking around to determine this. Some neighborhoods may look all 
right, but after asking some questions you may find it's going down hill. 
</P>
<P>
One indication would be a lot of vacant houses or for sale signs. It could mean 
that a growing number of people are frustrated with the noise, litter, crime, 
or whatever. Similarly, a neighborhood that doesn't look great may not 
necessarily be a bad neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Schools are one place to find the answer, even if you don't have school-age 
children, because the quality of local schools can tell you a lot about a 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
According to Anthony B. Sanders, a professor of real estate finance at Ohio 
State University, positive trends in the scholastic rankings of a school 
district indicate a neighborhood on the way up. 
</P>
<P>
If, for example, you are moving to a new town or city, you may not be familiar 
with the local school system and some basic research may be needed. 
</P>
<P>
And remember, looks may be deceiving: The shiniest new suburb may have an 
underfunded school system compared to an older, more established one closer to 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a lavish public school system may indicate that local real 
estate taxes are sky high. Moving to the next suburb or town could make a 
difference of hundreds or thousands of dollars in taxes alone. 
</P>
<P>
Crime rates are another obvious indicator of quality neighborhoods. A visit to 
the local police precinct or a chat with a police officer on the street could 
tell you all you need to know about the crime in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Owner occupancy is still another way to judge a neighborhood. Areas where there 
are more owners than renters tend to be more stable and better taken care of. 
If there are a lot of recent renters, it could mean that unfavorable conditions 
resulted in owners leaving the neighborhood and renting out their homes to 
others. 
</P>
<P>
If you really want to do some digging, go to a local library and look through 
1- or 2-year-old real estate classified ads for the neighborhoods you are 
considering. 
</P>
<P>
If home prices seem to be rising faster than those in the rest of the region, 
it's a good bet that they will continue to rise -- and that the neighborhood 
will continue to improve. 
</P>
<P>
Another good source of information is the local land use or planning office. 
Officials there can provide some insight about a neighborhood, and perhaps tell 
you about any future development that may affect home values. 
</P>
<P>
Timing, of course, is of the essence, particularly when considering 
neighborhoods that may be in transition. You may find an improving 
neighborhood, but it may take a year or so before it rises to the level that 
you find acceptable. But if you find the right neighborhood too late, you may 
be priced out of the market.

GOOD REAL ESTATE AGENT CAN BE BUYER'S BEST FRIEND; 
</P>
<P>
BROKERS: FIND A REAL ESTATE REPRESENTATIVE WHO LISTENS TO WHAT YOU WANT, OFFERS 
EXPLANATIONS AND KEEPS IN TOUCH -- THEN STICK WITH THE AGENT TO THE END. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDITH LANK, Lank is the author of the book The Complete Homebuyer's Kit 
(Longman Group U.S.A., 1989), from which this article is adapted.

<TEXT>
<P>
You will meet real estate agents by answering ads, calling the numbers on lawn 
signs and visiting open houses. Best of all, perhaps, is a name suggested by a 
relative or friend who has had a good experience -- but only if the agent in 
question specializes in the areas or type of house you want. 
</P>
<P>
In a strange town, you can write to the chamber of commerce for maps and 
information; you will probably hear from several brokerage firms interested in 
working with out-of-towners. If you study the local newspapers, you will 
discover which agents are active in the areas you like. 
</P>
<P>
Remembering that you have no legal obligations to the agent, you might be 
tempted to play the field, thinking that you'll get many people out there 
looking for your dream house. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, though, the buyer who works with many brokers is working with no 
one. The first time an agent calls to tell you about a house new on the market 
and hears "as a matter of fact, we saw that one with someone else this 
morning," your name is crossed off the list. In the absence of a legal 
relationship, most successful transactions flow from informal trust between 
buyer and broker. When you find a good broker, stick with him or her. 
</P>
<P>
Here are a few tests by which to judge an agent: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Does he or she return phone calls promptly? This simple question is a good 
screening device, whether you're looking for a broker, lawyer or plumber. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Does the agent explain things so you can understand them? This is 
especially important with first-time buyers. If you can find an agent who is a 
born teacher, you're in luck. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Does the agent seem ready to invest time in you? For example, when the 
broker is holding an open house, does he or she just wave you on through, 
asking as you leave whether you're interested in the house and letting it go at 
that? 
</P>
<P>
You want someone who, if not busy with other prospects, shows you the house in 
a professional manner, asks questions about your needs and offers to discuss 
other properties if the one you are looking at doesn't interest you. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Does the broker suggest an initial session in the office, rather than 
simply meeting you at the house you called about? To get good service, you need 
that financial analysis and discussion of your whole situation. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Does the agent ask questions about your finances soon after meeting you? 
This may not ordinarily be good manners but it's the mark of an efficient 
broker who aims to give you good service. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Does the broker explain up front that he or she is acting as the seller's 
agent? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Do the first houses suggested show that the broker has been listening and 
understands your wants and needs? If you're shown houses that have the wrong 
number of bedrooms or are clearly out of your price range, forget it. 
</P>
<P>
Once you find a broker with whom you feel comfortable, one who inspires 
confidence, stick with him or her. Tell your broker about other firms' ads that 
interest you, even about "for sale by owners," so he or she can investigate for 
you. Ask for advice before visiting open houses on your own. 
</P>
<P>
If you have the agent's home phone number, don't hesitate to use it. Real 
estate agents are accustomed to evening and weekend calls. Service is the only 
thing they have to sell, and they welcome any sign that you want to take 
advantage of it. 
</P>
<P>
The average person assumes that a real estate agent's job is to help you find a 
house, but that's only the tip of the iceberg. The typical broker will spend 
more time bringing you into agreement with the seller and, most important, 
helping you arrange to finance your purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Some services you can expect, even if, as is most usual, you are using the 
seller's broker: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Analysis of your financial situation. Don't be offended by what appear to 
be personal questions. A good agent asks them at the beginning because a 
lending institution may ask them later on. During a first conversation, the 
broker is already forming a strategy for financing your purchase, based on the 
various mortgage options available locally. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Education in basic real estate principles. Brokers expect to spend extra 
time with first-time home buyers. You have a right to insist that every step be 
explained so that you feel comfortable with it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Recommendation of a specific price range. Without those parameters all 
parties involved -- sellers, agents and buyers -- are just spinning their 
wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Orientation to a new community. If you are moving out of town, send for the 
local newspaper, read the ads and write to a couple of real estate firms that 
handle property in the area or price range you might be interested in. You may 
receive long-distance phone calls, maps and offers to meet your plane, arrange 
motel reservations or baby-sitting. Seeing the town with a broker as your 
chauffeur is one of the best ways to learn about neighborhoods, schools, 
shopping and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Information about different locations. The agent is not supposed to answer 
questions or volunteer information touching on any of the protected classes 
under human rights law -- ethnic or racial composition of neighborhoods, for 
example. But a broker may answer your questions about the location of 
vegetarian restaurants and health clubs, give you factual information on 
per-pupil expenditure in various school districts or pinpoint on a map the 
organizations or religious institutions you are interested in. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Screening of listings. The agent will show you any house on the market and 
must be careful not to narrow your choice by the use of subtle steering based 
on racial, religious or other forbidden criteria. Keep in mind, though, that a 
good agent is a skilled matchmaker who listens instead of talks, then helps you 
narrow down available listings for efficient use of your time. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Showing of property. The agent will set up appointments for house 
inspections and will accompany you. During the tours, don't be afraid to ask 
questions. The agent will have at hand a wealth of data on each house you see, 
including lot size, property taxes and assessment figures, age of the house, 
square footage, heating system and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Estimation of ownership costs. When you are seriously interested in a 
specific house, your agent will help you figure out how you could buy it and 
what it would cost you each month. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Negotiation. The agent will prepare a "purchase offer" that reflects your 
proposed purchase price and other terms. Unless you're offering to pay the 
seller's full asking price, the seller will likely make a counter-offer. The 
negotiations will continue until you and the seller finally reach agreement on 
terms of the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Financing expertise, which is probably the most important, and certainly 
the most time-consuming, of the agent's activities. A skilled agent keeps in 
close touch with local lending institutions and helps you find the one that 
best suits you, out of what may be hundreds of different mortgage plans. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mortgage application assistance. In many localities, the agent expects to 
make an appointment for you with a lending institution and help you prepare for 
the application interview, perhaps accompanying you. While you're waiting for 
loan approval, the agent will keep in touch with the lender to straighten out 
any hitches that develop. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Settlement. Local customs vary, but in many areas the broker attends the 
closing session, and in a few places actually effects the transfer of title.

WINSOME WINNIE: THE ACTRESS BEHIND THE GIRL BEHIND THE BOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It's weird. People come up and say, "Hi Winnie!" They know me, but I don't 
know them." 
</P>
<P>
The truth is, most people only know 15-year-old Danica McKellar as Winnie 
Cooper, Kevin Arnold's puppy love affair on "The Wonder Years." The show has 
completely swept bittersweet TV audiences into the post-pubescent liaisons of 
the two star-crossed lovers. The first kiss. The Valentine's card. The make-out 
room. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Danica nervous that is some people don't want to know who Winnie 
really is. They want to believe Kevin and Winnie's relationship is as authentic 
and tangible as their own fragile memories of first love. "So many people are 
tied up in the relationship," Danica said. "It's kind of freaky." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Savage agrees. "Sometimes when I'm walking down the street, people will 
yell out, "Hey Kevin, where's Winnie?," he said. "It just makes me laugh." 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we're together, so everything is OK," Danica said. "But it can't 
last too long, or we wouldn't have a story, right?" 
</P>
<P>
The young actress said that at the very least, people want to believe that she 
and Fred are an item off screen. "Everybody asks that. Everybody wants to know 
if Fred and I are going out. And they want it to be true. They want it to be 
real." 
</P>
<P>
Danica exhaled a deep breath, like a teacher repeating information for the 
students who weren't listening. "We're good friends. That's all." On the set, 
Danica and Fred interact like any of the other young actors-in fact, just like 
the regular kids that they are. "A lot of times I may be having a conversation 
with Fred on the set, and similar lines will appear in the script two weeks 
later because the writers were listening," Danica explained. 
</P>
<P>
"The Wonder Years" is Danica's first acting job on a regular series, following 
three years of acting school and bit TV parts. "It's not like having a job at 
the mall on Sunday," she said. When Danica was 12, she answered a cattle call 
for the role of Winnie. The field was ultimately narrowed down to her and 
another girl-her younger sister. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried out for the part with my sister, Crystal," Danica said. "We both got a 
call back the next day. It was down to just the two of us. They kept us there 
until late that night trying to decide. Finally, they told me that I got the 
job, but they liked Crystal so much that they wrote a part for her also." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, 13-year-old Crystal plays Becky, Kevin's girlfriend before 
Winnie. Although Kevin received his first kiss from Winnie in the pilot, Winnie 
found an older boyfriend, so Kevin took up with Becky for a short-lived fling 
earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
Both sisters live with their parents in West Los Angeles. Danica doesn't see 
future scripts of "The Wonder Years" until the episode is being shot. So she 
wasn't able to provide any insight into what's in store for Kevin and Winnie's 
relationship. But she expects to be around for the duration of the series, even 
if it's in a limited role. 
</P>
<P>
"I think The Wonder Years' will run the five years of its contract," she said, 
"and not get picked up after that. We all want to go on to other things. I want 
to act in films. We'll all be grown up at that point, anyway. I'll be 18 years 
old. There won't be as much left to wonder about then." DANIEL CERONE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since the summer night in New Orleans when he accepted the Republican 
nomination for President, two terms have followed George Bush: "a thousand 
points of light" and "a kinder, gentler nation." They have provided fodder for 
cartoonists and columnists, served as inspiration to faithful followers, been 
used ironically by fierce foes. But they have not been forgotten. They are the 
product of Peggy Noonan's pen. 
</P>
<P>
The 39-year old former speech writer started putting words in the mouths of 
famous men as a writer for CBS Radio, where, she writes in her best-selling 
book, "What I Saw at the Revolution," she was trotted out as the house oddity 
-- the conservative. 
</P>
<P>
Though Noonan grew up as one of seven children in an Irish Catholic family 
where Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy numbered among the household 
gods, she became convinced that it was the Republican Party that spoke for 
working-class families with strong religious beliefs -- families like hers. 
Then came Ronald Reagan and Noonan found inspiration. She conspired to get to 
the White House and, in 1984, succeeded, making the odd transition from writing 
for Dan Rather to writing for Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
In her book, Noonan describes with some humor the prats and pitfalls she took 
in her first months as the "woman speech writer." But eventually she settled in 
to write some of the most memorable and goose-bump provoking addresses that 
Reagan ever gave, including his tribute at Normandy to "the boys of Pointe du 
Hoc" and his response to the Challenger disaster. When Bush formally moved into 
the presidential campaign, he threw his hat into the ring with Noonan's words. 
Bush then turned to her for the other moments when the nation would be 
listening: the acceptance speech in New Orleans and the Inaugural Address on 
the steps of the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
That day, the chairs in the reserved section held signs for the specially 
invited dignitaries. One said "Peggy Noonan," another "Mr. Noonan." In fact, 
"Mr. Noonan" is Richard Rahn, an economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He 
and Peggy are now separated and she lives in New York with their son, Will. 
</P>
<P>
Question: You talk a lot about the male culture in this town in the book, the 
men in Congress who are fighting with each other in the committee and then 
leaning over to each other and saying, "Check out the one in row three, look at 
those legs." 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Washington is a power place. The magnet is power. The little bits of 
metal that the magnet collects are people who really want power, believe in 
power. They have been historically, as you may have noticed, men. So if it's a 
power town, it's a bunch of guys. If it's a power town, it's a guy town. Well, 
if it's a guy town then there will be a certain amount of bonding done around 
the issue of, say, sexual sameness. "We're boys. Did you see a girl coming down 
the hall, let's make a joke about the girl -- does she have good gams?" So 
there is that, the chauvinism in Washington comes out very understandably. 
</P>
<P>
I think it's a little bit like chauvinism in the Catholic Church, in that "Hey, 
this has been, excuse me, a male bastion for a long time, and we are simply not 
used to having a lot of women here. And it's going to take us a while to 
readjust. And some of us will readjust a little clumsily, some of us will feel 
a little bit inadequate and to cover our sense of inadequacy, we will sometimes 
make women feel bad. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Q: When you came, did you take the woman speech-writer slot? 
</P>
<P>
A: I did. I didn't know it was called that until I'd been hired. Until I was 
there my first week, and then I was introduced by a fellow speech writer as, 
"Hello, this is Peggy Noonan. She got the woman speech-writer's job." And I was 
appalled. I thought he was going for a joke. I thought it was like he was 
showing solidarity with me. "We're both young, we're both hip, we laugh at 
sexism." But he was not going for a joke. And that's how they looked at it, 
because for a few Administrations there had been historically one woman speech 
writer. I don't know why. There just was. 
</P>
<P>
Q: And was she supposed to do all the sort of touchy-feely things in the 
speeches? Was she supposed to deal with children and Mother's Day, or was she 
supposed to just be there as the token woman on the staff? 
</P>
<P>
A: I don't know. When you're hired as a speech writer, you're there to work; 
they don't have room for a token. I don't know what it was like in the past, 
but when I worked at the White House my immediate superior was Ben (Bentley) 
Elliott, who brought me in, not because I was a woman, but because he was 
swamped by all of the speeches he had to do, and he wanted me to take a major 
part in them, and take a major share of them. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You had the experience as the woman speech writer of being asked to write 
speeches for the First Lady . . . and you chose not to do that. 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, I chose not to do that. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why was that so important? 
</P>
<P>
A: It took me a few weeks to sort of scope out, "Wow, it is kind of different 
to be a woman here. And, it is not necessarily in your interest to be a woman 
here." And I gathered that speech-writing itself was a highly competitive shop 
and that there was a lot of competition going on in the White House, a lot of 
competitiveness between groups and offices and such. 
</P>
<P>
And I felt that if I, as the only woman speech writer, wrote some speeches for 
the First Lady, I would become pegged as the First Lady's woman speech writer, 
and I would never be given any more serious assignments. Like when Reagan went 
away on a big trip and had a big speech, I thought, "Oh, boy, they'll never 
give me those speeches now. They'll give me the First Lady's speech to the 
women's club." 
</P>
<P>
I just didn't want that, so I said no. It was just not what I came to the White 
House for. And I was willing to not work at the White House if I had to do 
that. This is not to suggest I mean to denigrate a First Lady's speeches or the 
groups she speaks to. But I was aware that that was not really where the action 
was. OK. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Did you suffer any repercussions? 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, the Reagan White House was an interesting place. There was a 
considerable amount of intrigue. There was a considerable amount of 
back-stabbing. There were a lot of tong wars. 
</P>
<P>
One of the things that I thought was interesting about the Reagan White House 
was that sometimes you could die and no one would tell you. You'd notice after 
six months nobody had given you a serious assignment and nothing good had 
happened to you. And you'd realize, "I am one of the walking dead. And no one 
told me, I guess I'd better leave." 
</P>
<P>
I got the impression, it was very subtle, but I did get the impression that I 
had made a major faux pas, and done nothing to help my career by getting the 
First Lady's chief of staff and the First Lady herself irritated with me. And 
as I say in the book, I did not handle it in the best way possible. I was not 
politically astute, both because of anger and because of a sort of bumptious 
lack of knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
Q: One of the things that surprises me is you also say that in going to CBS you 
had the experience which I had had more than 10 years before, of men saying, 
"You're not authoritative enough to be on the air." I thought by the time you 
were there and some of us were on the air that was over. 
</P>
<P>
A: No, and that was about 1977-78 that he said that to me. He was a major news 
director for a major CBS O&amp;O (owned &amp; operated station). He had heard 
about me through a former boss of mine who said of me, "This is a young woman 
who can write." Writing, as you know, on radio is a lot of the anchor's art. So 
they auditioned me because I was a writer and after that audition, I must say, 
the news director was very blunt with me. He said, quote, "Your voice, it has 
no balls." That was like 13 years ago. I still don't know what the proper 
snappy reply is to that . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Q: I'm enough older than you that for our generation we all heard that. But I 
really did think that it had changed. 
</P>
<P>
A: Well I ran into it too. Want to know something? It has changed. I know it's 
changed. It was better in '77 than it was for you in '72 or '66 or whatever. 
But you know what, as long as -- I was just going to say as long as men run 
networks there will always be this problem. 
</P>
<P>
But do you want to know something funny? If more women were in high executive 
slots and picking on-air talent . . . oddly enough, I think a woman executive 
would tend toward males with authoritative personas. You know, I still do. I -- 
that may be an awfully sexist thing for me to say, but somehow I would think 
that even if women moved into the top executive slots, it would not necessarily 
advance women in media. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are you a feminist? 
</P>
<P>
A: I don't know. I get asked that a lot. Look, we all have our biases. I am not 
sure I am a feminist. I think I am a female chauvinist, however. Now, that's 
different than a feminist, but a female chauvinist cannot help it. She has this 
bias that, by and large, women are better than men. I'm sorry. Please note I 
said I'm sorry. I mean it's not a nice thing to say but you know it is my bias. 
So there you are. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I think it's one most women would agree with, however. But why, when you say 
that, are you hesitant about the word feminist? What does it imply to you that 
you don't embrace it? 
</P>
<P>
A: A political agenda that I do not embrace. To call oneself a feminist now is 
to become inevitably associated with say the National Organization -- is it 
"for" Women or "of" Women, I always forget? 
</P>
<P>
Q: It's "for." 
</P>
<P>
A: For Women. The National Organization for Women. And their political agenda 
which, excuse me, is way to left of where I am. Or to become say, to suggest 
implicitly that you support the ERA (equal-rights amendment), which I don't. 
</P>
<P>
Actually I am afraid I am one of those women who thinks that she has seen women 
gain so much through the feminist wave that began in the mid-'60s and that we 
are still enjoying. But I have seen us lose a lot too. And I think some of the 
women who lost things are not women that the leaders of the feminist movement 
are thinking about. 
</P>
<P>
You cannot go into a county courthouse in America and walk in unannounced on, 
say, a divorce trial, a child-custody trial, and not get the sense that the 
marvelous feminist spirit of the '60s and '70s has in fact hurt some women -- 
mostly women who can't afford to protect themselves with expensive lawyers. But 
you find that a woman who's leaving a guy, she doesn't have much money, he has 
some more. They decide they're going to fight about the kids. It was once 
assumed in America that mom gets the kids. It is not anymore. Is that progress? 
No, but I am the only one of my friends who believes that. 
</P>
<P>
I was very moved by the women fighting in Panama. I like having women in the 
U.S. armed forces. I like it that they're brave and resourceful and talented 
and I want them to get a lot of medals. I do not ever want women drafted in 
America -- ever. Now, I don't know, would Gloria Steinem say, "Uh-oh, 10 points 
off your feminist score. Wrong position." I think she would. I think it is the 
quote "wrong position." But it is definitely my position. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 As for her job -- writing in the President's voice -- Noonan felt the 
differences in writing for Ronald Reagan and George Bush: 
</P>
<P>
A: He (Reagan) had a beautiful voice, a really beautiful and distinctive, 
lovely old Midwestern voice. And he had a warmth to his nature that made him 
find anecdotes that expressed his views. Perfectly congenial for him, and I 
think that the voice and the warmth had something to do with the actor's art. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Well, that's a lot like writing for radio. 
</P>
<P>
A: It was a little. You know I used to write for Charles Osgood. With his 
lovely warmth and he had a similar almost a proto-avuncular voice and style. . 
. . We're getting back to the old authority questions in a way, they spoke with 
a certain -- to call it a moral authority would be too much. But there was a 
certain obvious integrity in them that radiated through those airways. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Bush does not have a beautiful voice. How was it different to write for that 
voice? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Oh, you know there's an old phrase, they're as different as chalk and 
cheese. They are. Bush does not love the oratorical part of his presidency. He 
loves the pushing of the levers in the Oval Office. And then being on the 
phone. He does not massage a speech the way Reagan did. Reagan would get his 
hands around it, you know. You could almost see his print marks on it when you 
saw the text after he'd given it. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's personal conversational style and his public speaking style has more to 
do with short bursts of words and thought, of fragments, sometimes fragments of 
sentences, fragments of thoughts. Almost more the suggestion of thoughts than 
the statement of thoughts. He was harder to write for in many ways and easier 
in a few. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Reagan is publicly a sentimental man. But privately there was a certain 
coolness to him. Publicly, Bush is not comfortable with sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
An example: I once worked with him on funeral remarks when (Justice) Potter 
Stewart died and Potter Stewart was a very close friend of Bush. Bush was 
giving the eulogy, or one of the eulogies, at the service for Potter Stewart. 
We had worked on the remarks, I gave them to him that morning. He looked over 
them in the car on the way to the church and he started to cry and so did his 
wife. And he said, "I can't say this." 
</P>
<P>
That never would have happened with Reagan. Bush couldn't say it because he 
knew he'd cry in public, and he didn't want to do that. It just never would 
have happened with Reagan, as you know. So he got up there, and he just winged 
it. He took certain pieces of it, and then just told anecdotes, did it as 
quickly as he could and left. Because in a way his heart is more on his sleeve 
than Reagan, although it does not appear to be so. It's a funny thing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is there anybody you listen to now, in public life and say, "Gee, I'd like 
to write his or her speeches?" 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Not because there aren't some really good people out there, but only 
because I do not feel the desire to write speeches anymore. Arthur Schlesinger 
said, "Nobody should write speeches over 40." And he was right, it's a kid's 
game. It's really for when you're in your early and mid-'30s. I think that's 
when the best speech writers are throwing their best fastballs. And then, if 
you're a writer, you should go on and become another kind of writer and do 
other kinds of things and really write in your own voice. So there, so I never 
think about it. You know I never see anybody and think, "Oh I'd love to write 
her stuff or his stuff."

MIKE PENNER: REESE: WORK OF ART AT 85 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nicest man to ever wear an Angel uniform got a terrible scare Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmie Reese, roommate to Babe Ruth, best friend to Nolan Ryan, somewhat older 
brother to Jim Abbott and fungo master to the world, sat in his Westwood 
apartment clutching a hand to his 85-year-old chest. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmie had just finished listening to the radio broadcast of that evening's 
Angel game in Baltimore and the news had been good. The Angels won, 7-1, and 
Abbott pitched seven strong innings for his first victory of the season. Abbott 
and Reese are tight -- a March-November kinship if there ever was one -- and a 
dentist friend named Norman Kumai phoned Jimmie to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, the conversation shifted to how Jimmie was feeling. Jimmie said not so 
good. He told Kumai about these pains in his chest and within minutes, Kumai 
was in his car, headed first to Jimmie's apartment and then to St. John's 
Hospital in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
According to doctors, Jimmie had suffered a coronary occlusion. To you and me, 
that's not much different than a heart attack. Jimmie had a blocked blood 
vessel leading to his heart and to unblock it, Dr. Harry Rockoff performed an 
emergency angioplasty, which entails the insertion and inflation of a miniature 
balloon into the vessel. 
</P>
<P>
Four days later, Jimmie is listed in stable condition and resting comfortably 
at St. John's. But the Angels say Reese will be sidelined through the All-Star 
break, which will be the longest they've been fungo-less since 1972, when they 
added Reese, then a tadpole of 63, to their coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 18 seasons, Jimmie has held the official title of Angel 
conditioning coach. For most of the 1980s, that was good for a laugh. During 
those years, the annual Freeway Series was played between the Dodgers and the 
codgers, when the Angels had a graying nucleus of Rod Carew-Bobby Grich-Reggie 
Jackson and a motto: Never start anyone under 30. 
</P>
<P>
Were those Angels old? 
</P>
<P>
Hey, their conditioning coach was pushing 80. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmie laughed along and lasted longer than any of them. He was there when 
Frank Tanana broke in. He was there when Abbott broke in. He has hit fungoes to 
Andy Messersmith. He has hit fungoes to Mark Langston. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmie has spent 73 seasons in professional baseball and not many of them got 
much better than 1989. Last summer, the Angels hosted the All-Star Game, which 
meant Jimmie could throw out the first pitch and spend one more day on the same 
side with Ryan. It was a 10-year reunion, the all-time major league strikeout 
leader and the man after whom he named a son: Reese Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer also introduced Reese to Abbott, the one-handed pitcher who 
followed in Ryan's footsteps -- straight to Jimmie's locker. They are the 
oldest and youngest Angels, separated by more than 60 years, but they are bound 
by what they mean to the sport. Tim Mead, the team's publicity director, had 
his picture taken with the two Jims and calls it his prized possession. "They 
both stand for so much," Mead says. "Jimmie shows what the elderly can do and 
Jim shows that those born without everything are still capable of anything." 
</P>
<P>
The photo hangs in Mead's office, along with several others, all framed by 
Reese. Jimmie is good with wood, be it half a bat or four pieces of varnished 
walnut, and picture-framing has been a longtime hobby. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmie estimates he has made more than 20,000 frames for friends over the 
years. "He's very insulted when he sees something on your wall framed by Aaron 
Bros.," Mead jokes. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, friends turn the trick on Jimmie. Because of the 100-mile drive 
between Anaheim and Westwood, Jimmie spends Angel home stands at the Jolly 
Roger Inn across the street from Disneyland. There, in the hotel lobby, is one 
of Jimmie's Angel jerseys, old No. 50, framed and on display. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel also has named one of its largest suites "The Jimmie Reese Room" and 
offers a menu that features "The Jimmie Reese Breakfast." The main course? 
Oatmeal, Jimmie's daily morning standby. 
</P>
<P>
At 85, Jimmie is a man of routine. He's set in his ways. Before every Angel 
home game, for instance, just as batting practice concludes, he refuses to join 
the rest of the team in the clubhouse. Instead, he shuffles down the left field 
line and mingles with the fans, signing autographs, posing for photos, patting 
toddlers on the head. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmie likes everyone. Even sportswriters. Last season, this one was working on 
a Ryan profile, so Jimmie was an obvious source. Jimmie compared Ryan to Walter 
Johnson -- he's an eye witness to both -- and he reeled in all the memories, 
including the game in which Ryan threw 170 pitches and won, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Interview finished, I turned to leave but Jimmie wouldn't allow it. He pulled a 
cardboard box out of his locker stall, opened it and said, "Reach in." 
</P>
<P>
I pulled out a baseball. It was signed by Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
"Keep it," Jimmie said. "I've got lots of them." 
</P>
<P>
Right now, Jimmie isn't quite up to receiving visitors or phone calls, but St. 
John's will pass along cards and letters. The address is 1328 22nd Street, 
Santa Monica, 90404. The patient is one of a kind. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels won't be the same until he's back on the active roster. They want 
him at full strength, fungo in hand, the picture of good health. 
</P>
<P>
Suitable for framing.

KIVIAT IS OLDEST LIVING MEDALIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
BALTIMORE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most strenuous exercise Abel R. Kiviat gets these days is walking 200 feet 
to the mailbox and back at his Lakehurst, N.J., residence. The next most 
strenuous exercise he gets is the 150-foot, round-trip journey to the trash 
bin. 
</P>
<P>
Some people count the miles they run. Abel R. Kiviat counts the steps he takes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't do walking, I don't take any exercise," he said, pride in his craggy 
voice. 
</P>
<P>
He's earned the right. At the age of 97, Kiviat is the oldest living Olympic 
medalist. He was nosed out of a gold medal in the 1912 Stockholm Games when a 
fast-finishing Englishman named A.N.S. Jackson took the 1,500-meter run in 
3:56.8. Kiviat's 3:56.9 barely held off U.S. teammate Norman Taber for the 
silver. 
</P>
<P>
Kiviat took some consolation -- but not much -- when the United States won the 
3,000-meter team event. He got a gold even though his time was not among the 
top three scoring times for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Kiviat was at Essex Community College this week to help kick off Fitness Month 
and Older Americans Month on Senior Fitness Day, and to talk about his silver 
medal and his longevity. 
</P>
<P>
He is a monument to clean living. Well, relatively speaking, anyway. Aside from 
the glass of John Dewars scotch (on the rocks) and two Optimo Admiral cigars he 
allows himself each day, he has no other admitted vices. 
</P>
<P>
At the least, Kiviat, who turns 98 on June 23, is the product of good genes. 
The son of Russian immigrants, Abel has a sister still living who is 96 and a 
brother -- the baby in the family -- who is 86. His son, Arthur, will be 76 on 
Christmas Day. His mother lived to be 81, while his father died at the tender 
age of 66. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been lucky," Kiviat said several times during a two-hour reminisce. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't kidding. He survived World War I as a buck private in a supply outfit 
in France. "Promoted three times," Kiviat remembered, "busted three times." 
</P>
<P>
One fateful night, he was scheduled to be in a threesome that drove ammunition 
to the front. He let another soldier go in his place, though. "He was an Irish 
boy," Kiviat said. "He made the suggestion (to switch)." 
</P>
<P>
The truck ran over a mine that night and all three people in it were killed. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to what he attributes his longevity, Kiviat repeats this litany: 
</P>
<P>
"I used no condiments. I got plenty of sleep. And I kept my nose clean, after I 
had it broken playing football and baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Although he says he was less than 5 feet tall and under 100 pounds at the time 
he competed in the 1912 Games, Kiviat was quite an athlete. He was an 
accomplished shortstop at Curtis High School in Staten Island, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
According to Glenn Kasper, who regularly accompanies Kiviat on speaking 
engagements as deputy director of the New Jersey Governor's Council on Physical 
Fitness &amp; Sports, Abel was being scouted by the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
As the story goes, Kiviat got his start in track after winning a challenge race 
against a member of the Curtis track team. He became New York City's mile and 
880 champion as a prep runner, and then was invited by Lawson Robertson to join 
the Irish American Athletic Club. Kiviat was the only Jewish athlete on what he 
calls the "poor man's track club." 
</P>
<P>
According to Kasper, Kiviat went undefeated in every race he entered in 1911. 
He set a world record for the 1,500-meter run in the U.S. Olympic trials at 
Harvard Stadium in 1912, a record that stood until 1930. 
</P>
<P>
And he was favored to take the gold in Sweden. As the race was described in 
"The Story of the Olympic Games, 776 B.C. to 1964" by John Kieran and Arthur 
Daley, he took the lead in the bell lap and ran down the stretch with teammates 
Taber and John Paul Jones abreast of him. 
</P>
<P>
Great Britain's Jackson passed them all, however, on the final turn. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember it vividly," Kiviat said. "In fact, I had nightmares about it." 
</P>
<P>
There were no Olympics in 1916, and Kiviat didn't get around to competing again 
until 1924. At that point, his career effectively ended when he was asked to 
run the steeplechase in the trials. He promptly hit a hurdle, fell into the 
next water hole, and suffered a badly sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Kiviat worked a number of jobs in the ensuing years -- he was a sporting goods 
salesman for Wanamaker's and worked in the New York Stock Exchange -- before 
settling in for 41 years with the government as a court clerk. He retired at 
age 71. Some eight years ago, Olympic historian Stan Saplan looked up the 
forgotten Kiviat and Abel has been making appearances ever since. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Kiviat, who had lost his Olympic medals, received replicas from the 
great grandson of the king of Sweden, who had initially given him the medals. 
In 1989, he met President Bush and was a torch bearer at the U.S. Olympic 
Festival in Oklahoma City. And, if all goes well, he will lead the U.S. Olympic 
delegation at the '92 Games in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
He will be 100 in 1992.

NO SATISFACTION FOR INFORMANT IN CAPITOL STING; 
</P>
<P>
CORRUPTION: MAN WHO WENT UNDERCOVER FOR THE FBI IS UNHAPPY WITH THE PACE OF 
PROSECUTIONS. HE ALSO SAYS LEGISLATURE STILL HASN'T CLEANED UP ITS ACT.

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has been 20 months since the FBI raided the state Capitol and brought an end 
to its undercover political corruption probe, and Marv Levin is running out of 
patience. 
</P>
<P>
A private businessman who became a crucial government informant for more than 
three years in the elaborate federal sting operation, Levin says he is 
frustrated by the slow pace of prosecutions. And he is even more annoyed with 
the Legislature itself for what he sees as its failure to get its own house 
quickly in order. 
</P>
<P>
"I see the (legislative) games become more sophisticated," Levin told The Times 
in an interview that ended a year and a half of silence. "The old boys' network 
is alive and well, just doing things a little differently now." New ethics 
reform moving through the Legislature is a step in the right direction, he 
said, but only a step. 
</P>
<P>
Levin, who is 55 and not in the best of health, said he had hoped the system 
would change and that he is speaking out now because voters need to be told 
that it hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
He also believes the time has finally arrived when he can safely call attention 
to himself. He feels he has earned a brief moment in the light to explain how 
he risked financial ruin to help set right a political system that often favors 
those with the biggest checkbooks. 
</P>
<P>
It was Levin who helped the FBI write special-interest bills that would 
supposedly help a bogus company open a plant near Sacramento. It was Levin who 
advised undercover investigators posing as Southern businessmen on the 
intricacies of moving those bills through the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
And it was Levin, wearing a concealed recording device, who acted as the 
go-between with legislative aides who saw to it that the measures were passed. 
</P>
<P>
More than six years after he began assisting the FBI -- and long after his 
direct role in the sting had ended -- he still wears an electronic pager given 
to him by the agents. The federal agents still beep occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the undercover operation, Levin feared that the disclosure that he 
was a paid informant for the FBI could damage him and destroy the $600-million 
Lighthouse Marina project that he and his partners are developing on the 
Sacramento River. And once his role did become public four years later, he 
found that instead of being hailed as a hero, his personal integrity was being 
questioned. 
</P>
<P>
Many people believed "that you can't be involved in something like this unless 
you're a crook yourself," Levin explained. 
</P>
<P>
At one critical moment in 1988, it took a letter of commendation from the FBI 
to allay the suspicions of local government officials who were reviewing the 
marina development. 
</P>
<P>
Terry L. Knowles, who headed the FBI's Sacramento office, wrote in Levin's 
defense: "The personal sacrifice and time spent by you without consideration 
for your own personal well-being should serve as an example to the community." 
The marina was approved by West Sacramento officials. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, looking back at events, Levin wonders whether going undercover 
was worth the risk -- to his business, to his health, to his family. At one 
point, he even worried that some of those who were snared in the sting might 
try to exact their revenge on his children. 
</P>
<P>
"This has taken an enormous toll on me personally," Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had (legislative) members who wouldn't see me any more," he said. "There 
are several I thought of as friends, as acquaintances, who refuse to deal with 
me." 
</P>
<P>
The federal investigation has already led to the conviction on political 
corruption charges of Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), who recently was 
sentenced to 6 1/2 years in federal prison. The probe has also resulted in 
similar charges being filed against State Board of Equalization member Paul 
Carpenter and a Montoya aide, and guilty pleas from a Republican legislative 
aide, a county sheriff and the sheriff's one-time top deputy. 
</P>
<P>
Levin describes himself as a reluctant participant in the federal investigation 
of political corruption. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, he even approached a Republican assemblyman he knew, hoping that the 
lawmaker would agree to take his place in assisting federal agents. The 
legislator had long complained that something needed to be done about 
corruption. But he refused to help, Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the federal investigators brought in their own replacement, a one-time 
United Nations official from New York who had been convicted of fraud and was 
hoping to win a presidential pardon by acting as an undercover operative in the 
Sacramento investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'I'm out of it. I'm so happy,' " Levin said. "He was very 
distinguished-looking. He wore glasses. He was well dressed. He had all the 
things I didn't have. He smelled of wealth. . . . This was someone who really 
looked and played the part." 
</P>
<P>
Levin hoped that he would be able to stay in the background, playing a strictly 
advisory role for the FBI while the New Yorker would be the one to make the 
direct contacts and secretly record his conversations. 
</P>
<P>
But ultimately the federal authorities decided they could not use the outsider 
because his criminal record could prove to be a problem when prosecutors took 
their cases to court, according to Levin. (This and other details of Levin's 
account were confirmed by sources familiar with the investigation.) 
</P>
<P>
Levin had a number of contacts in the Legislature because of his past jobs as a 
consultant-lobbyist with a nonprofit small business development corporation and 
as an official with the state office of small business development. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to get the sting going, but I really didn't want to be part of it," 
Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the agent in charge of the FBI probe -- a friend whose son had 
sometimes played in a neighborhood park with Levin's children -- said that the 
only way for the investigation to succeed was if Levin would agree to go 
undercover. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'If you don't do it, we can't go forward. There is no alternative,' " 
Levin said. "He hit me between the eyes. 'You're the one bitching about our not 
doing anything. Others have refused (to cooperate). Are you going to do the 
same?' " 
</P>
<P>
With considerable trepidation, Levin agreed to go ahead. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't the first time that Levin had agreed to wear a wire for the local 
office of the FBI. A few years before the Capitol sting, Levin had told local 
FBI agents about a fishy business deal that had been offered to him involving 
an official of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. He ended 
up with an FBI tape recorder stuffed inside a new pair of $200 cowboy boots he 
had bought for the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
When the federal authorities began the preliminary work on the sting in 1984, 
the FBI paid Levin $1,800 a month for almost a year, while he was pretending to 
be a consultant for Gulf Shrimp Fisheries Inc. of Mobile, Ala. The phony 
company was supposedly seeking state help in setting up a shrimp processing 
plant near Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The federal investigators supplied Levin with a set of fake correspondence from 
John E. (Jack) Gordon -- on paper, the president of Gulf Shrimp, but in reality 
an undercover FBI agent. On one of the letters to Levin, intended to be flashed 
at legislative staff members and legislators if the authenticity of the company 
was questioned, Gordon scrawled a handwritten note to Levin: "You could make 
some money too!" 
</P>
<P>
Levin helped the phony firm secure a $100,000 loan from a nonprofit agency 
headed by a former legislative aide, Darryl O. Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
Then Levin, who had once been a lobbyist and consultant for the California 
Rural Small Business Development Corp., helped the agents craft a narrow bill 
that would supposedly benefit Gulf Shrimp, but not any other company. 
</P>
<P>
To help move the sting bill, carried by Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los 
Angeles), through the Senate, Levin turned to an old acquaintance, legislative 
aide John Shahabian. Levin introduced Shahabian to Gulf Shrimp's "Jack Gordon." 
Shahabian told Gordon that it would cost $20,000 to win passage of the shrimp 
bill -- money that went into the campaign coffers of Carpenter, then a state 
senator. The measure passed in 1986 but was vetoed by Gov. George Deukmejian, 
who had been tipped off about the FBI sting. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, Levin aided federal investigators in an effort to turn Shahabian 
into an undercover informant. 
</P>
<P>
Levin said the FBI brought in a two-man "psych team" to help figure out the 
best way to approach Shahabian. Levin said the bureau's human behavior experts 
believed that Shahabian's close ties to his family made it likely he would 
agree to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
Frightened by the prospect of going to prison, Shahabian agreed to help the 
federal probe with a second sting bill, and for more than a year, he too led a 
double life as an undercover operative. 
</P>
<P>
Levin said he has some regrets about bringing Shahabian into the sting. 
Although the former legislative aide was granted immunity from prosecution 
because of his cooperation with the FBI, he eventually lost his Senate job. 
</P>
<P>
But Levin is also convinced he did the right thing, despite the misgivings. 
</P>
<P>
During one particularly low moment in 1987 -- just before the FBI persuaded 
Shahabian to cooperate -- Levin wrote a long letter to the agent he had 
befriended almost a decade before. "I became involved because I was enraged 
with a political system that had one standard for money and power and another 
for everyone else," Levin wrote. "I still don't personally think that what 
happens as a result of your effort will cause substantive change. However, I 
don't think I have a right to complain unless I am willing to act for change 
when given the opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
A year later, Levin had become a kind of fugitive, taking a cruise to escape a 
burst of press attention after the FBI raid. 
</P>
<P>
From aboard ship, his pulse racing and his blood pressure high, he wrote his 
friend at the FBI: "The reason so few people step forward to help is that the 
price of helping is very high. . . . Would I do it again? Probably, although I 
don't know whether I could physically take it. I would do it because one has to 
believe in something and stand up for your beliefs."

ELTON RULE, EX-CHIEF OF ABC, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Elton H. Rule, who graduated from the ranks of local television in Los Angeles 
to lead ABC's transformation from industry laughingstock to the dominant 
network in the 1970s, died Saturday. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
Rule, who was president and chief operating officer of American Broadcasting 
Cos. Inc. from 1972 until 1983, died of cancer at his Beverly Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
When he took over the struggling network, it had fewer stations, fewer hit 
shows and fewer viewers than its older competitors NBC and CBS. 
</P>
<P>
ABC, the joke went, was fourth among the three commercial networks. 
</P>
<P>
But during Rule's tenure, ABC accomplished a remarkable ascension, passing NBC 
in the race for viewers to challenge perennial leader CBS, and building a 
management structure regarded as the most solid in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no parallel in the history of broadcasting," Time magazine stated in 
1977, the year ABC surged to the top. "It's as if in the space of two years, 
Chrysler had surged past General Motors and sent Ford reeling back to Dearborn. 
Or as if China had discovered some mysterious 'Z' bomb and in victorious glee 
ordered both the White House and the Kremlin dismantled and shipped to Peking." 
</P>
<P>
Rule, who had demanded and received more autonomy to run the network than any 
other television president, was cool even in victory, telling a Times 
interviewer as he walked along the beach at his vacation home in Trancas: "I 
was surprised at the degree of success, but we were always headed this way, we 
were always in the game." 
</P>
<P>
Elton Hoerl Rule grew up with broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Stockton on June 13, 1917, he attended Sacramento College, then 
gravitated to a local "100-watt station," KROY, in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
He later described that job as "announcer dash writer dash salesman dash 
producer dash director dash. . . . On those stations, you did everything. You 
went out and sold ads, came back and wrote the copy, put a show together -- 
news, interviews, music -- and did the announcing." 
</P>
<P>
After infantry service in the Pacific during World War II, during which he 
achieved the rank of major and earned a purple heart, Rule moved to Los Angeles 
to sell advertising for KLAC. 
</P>
<P>
"KLAC had a television station, Channel 13, but nobody paid any attention to 
it," Rule said. "I became one of the first salesmen to try and sell TV time." 
</P>
<P>
Actress Betty White once recalled that it was a touch-and-go operation, 
requiring her to stand on one foot filling air time, nervously waiting for Rule 
to rush in with a client so that she could tout the client's refrigerator or 
other product on the air. 
</P>
<P>
Rule next moved to Los Angeles' KECA-TV, which became KABC, and he had his 
toehold on the ABC empire. He became station manager in 1960, and kept his 
station at the top of the Los Angeles market when NBC and CBS networks 
dominated television nationally. 
</P>
<P>
In 1968, after ABC's merger negotiations with the ITT conglomerate fell, the 
entertainment company's chairman, Leonard Goldenson, called Rule to lead his 
television operation out of its doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
"Either I make it and turn the network around or I go home to California," Rule 
told The Times' television critic Cecil Smith as he set off for New York. 
</P>
<P>
He made it, and he didn't come home to California for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
The climb was rapid. In 1968, Rule was named president of ABC Television. In 
1969, he became a group vice president of ABC Inc. In 1970, he was named to its 
board of directors and, in 1972, he became president and chief operating 
officer of the entire company. 
</P>
<P>
Rule and his coterie of wizards, including Hollywood producer Aaron Spelling, 
Roone Arledge, Fred Silverman and Martin Starger, boosted ABC out of the 
ratings cellar with popular if frivolous series like "Starsky &amp; Hutch," 
"Love Boat," "Charlie's Angels," and "Happy Days" and sports events including 
"Monday Night Football" and the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
But Rule also presented miniseries, specials and made-for-TV movies of a 
superior quality unseen before on television that proved remarkably popular 
with viewers: "Roots," "Eleanor and Franklin," "Merchant of Venice," "Long 
Day's Journey into Night," and "Duel." 
</P>
<P>
He had brought the network a long way from the days when analysts said ABC 
would never be successful because there wasn't enough business for three 
networks, and when jokes were rampant: "Put the Vietnam War on ABC and it'll be 
over in 13 weeks," or "They found Patty Hearst; she was hiding on ABC on Friday 
night." 
</P>
<P>
The network began turning a profit in 1972, and by 1977 collected more money 
for advertising time than the other two networks. In Rule's time, 1968 to 1983, 
the television network grew from 146 affiliated stations to 214, and the radio 
network increased from 365 stations to 1,809. 
</P>
<P>
While Rule shared credit for the turnaround to those who surrounded him, most 
industry analysts said he was primarily responsible for the dramatic shift in 
fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
When Rule retired in 1983, turning the reins over to his hand-picked successor, 
Frederick S. Pierce, he became vice chairman of the company, second to 
Goldenson. 
</P>
<P>
Rule retired from that position in January, 1984, and left ABC's board of 
directors the following September. 
</P>
<P>
As a "retiree," Rule had founded two production companies. 
</P>
<P>
Among his awards were the Gold Medal Award of the International Radio and 
Television Society in 1975, the Governor's Award of the Academy of Television 
Arts and Sciences in 1981, and the Distinguished Service Award of the National 
Assn. of Broadcasters in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Rule is survived by his wife, the former Betty Louise Bender whom he married in 
1942, and three children, Cindy Dunne, Christie and James Rule, all of Los 
Angeles, and two grandchildren.
