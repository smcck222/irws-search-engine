JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: YOU SAY POTATO . . .; 
</P>
<P>
. . . AND WHAT THE OTHER GUY SAYS IS BUT ONE EXAMPLE OF A PRONUNCIATION GAP 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
WE WHO THINK that our pronunciation is correct may be surprised by "There Is No 
Zoo in Zoology (and Other Beastly Mispronunciations)," a Collier book by 
Charles Harrington Elster of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
With wit, scholarship and much personal opinion, Elster tells us the way that 
many commonly mispronounced words should be pronounced. He notes that many 
words are consistently mispronounced by our political leaders (President 
Eisenhower never could get nuclear) and by radio and television talkers. 
</P>
<P>
It would be pointless of me to review this book without focusing on the words 
that I have been mispronouncing; there is no point in reading it simply to 
verify what I already know. 
</P>
<P>
Elster recalls that his mother kept a Webster's Second International Edition on 
the dining-room table and that whenever anyone mispronounced a word, he or she 
was told to look it up. Thus, the correct pronunciations he selects are 
generally standard -- those preferred by most authorities. 
</P>
<P>
He concedes that the language changes constantly, but he adheres to Alexander 
Pope's advice on words: 
</P>
<P>
 Be not the first by whom the new are tried. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor yet the last to lay the old aside. 
</P>
<P>
 I knew that the word accessory is pronounced ak-SES-uh-ree, not uh-SES-uh-ree; 
but Elster nailed me on aqua. I've always pronounced it AHK-wa. He says: It's 
AK-wa -- A as in cat, not as in father. That goes also for aquaplane, 
aquamarine and aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
Now that coitus may be used in polite company, I'm also afraid that I have been 
mispronouncing it. It is not koh-EYE-tus (which is what I thought it was), 
ko-AY-tus or COY-tus. All those, Elster says, may be found in the Kamasutra but 
not in any dictionary. So, if the subject should come up, the preferred 
pronunciation is KOH-i-tus. 
</P>
<P>
I am chagrined to find that I have been pronouncing coupon incorrectly for 
years. It's KOO-pahn, not KYOO-pahn. I learned the latter pronunciation from my 
mother, who also taught me to pronounce wash as warsh. Elster says the R sound 
has to go. 
</P>
<P>
I am stunned to find that daiquiri (that exotic drink) is pronounced 
DY-kuh-ree, not DAK-uh-ree, which is how my wife pronounces it when she orders 
one. Fortunately, I have given them up and may never be obliged to use the word 
again. 
</P>
<P>
It is not a word that often comes up, but I'm afraid that I have also been 
mispronouncing guillotine. It is not GEE-uh-teen, Elster says, but GIL-uh-teen. 
"The word has long been anglicized and the Ls should be pronounced." 
</P>
<P>
I have never been sure how to say long-lived, vacillating between LIVD and 
LYVD. It's LYVD, Elster says, the word coming from life, not live. 
</P>
<P>
I rarely give a paean, but from now on when I do, I will say PEE-an, not 
PAY-an. Also, I've always pronounced the word piquant as pee-KHANT. Not right. 
It's PEE-kint. Somehow that doesn't sound as piquant to me. Also, still in the 
Ps, I must try to get the L out of psalm. It's SAHM, as in calm. 
</P>
<P>
I am of two minds about valet. I have always pronounced it VAL-it, since it has 
long since been anglicized. As Elster notes, VAL-ay and val-AY are pseudo 
French. He makes an exception for valet parking, which, he says, "seems to have 
been created to provide a socially acceptable outlet for the potentially 
destructive impulses of young male drivers." To avoid val-AY for the correct 
VAL-it, Elster says, would seem to be pedantic. In this case, I choose 
pedantry. 
</P>
<P>
I am happy to see Elster's entry on chaise longue (shayz-LAWNG), which is 
French for long chair, but is often misspelled and mispronounced as chase 
lounge, giving the impression that this piece of furniture is a lounge upon 
which one pursues a romantic object. 
</P>
<P>
He also points out that forte, meaning one's strong point, is pronounced FORT, 
not for-TAY. Broadcasters almost never get that right. Few of us say 
thee-AYT-ur anymore, but if you do, Elster warns, you may be thought 
uneducated. Or worse, you may be thought to be from the South. It's 
THEE-uh-tur. 
</P>
<P>
And for heaven's sake, let's try to get nuclear right. It's NOO-klee-ur, not 
NOO-kyuh-lur.

POLITE AGIT-POP EXHIBIT IN 'A FOREST OF SIGNS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today the Museum of Contemporary Art launches an ambitious examination of an 
influential and contentious branch of contemporary art. On view at the museum's 
agreeably cavernous Temporary Contemporary wing in Little Tokyo until Aug. 13, 
the survey is called "A Forest of Signs" and presents works by 30 American 
artists, including such luminaries as Jenny Holzer, Jeff Koons and Cindy 
Sherman. Even viewed during its installation, the exhibition clearly promised 
to be an event to be reckoned with. 
</P>
<P>
Since the late '70s, artists of the stamp seen here have tried to revolutionize 
the way we look at art. Actually, according to this lot, we no longer look at 
art in the conventional sense -- soaking it up through our eyeballs -- we read 
art like a book. Actually we read it more like a somewhat cryptic advertising 
poster. If you happen to be one of those people who hates to read standing up, 
this can be tiresome. 
</P>
<P>
If you also happen to be one of those conscientious souls who bones up before 
going to an exhibition, the verbal bunting surrounding this one is sufficiently 
intimidating to make your self-confidence shrivel up like an overcooked pea. 
The catalogue -- with several refreshing exceptions -- is couched in the kind 
of language seemingly designed to make the ordinary viewer who doesn't much 
like the show feel that it is his own fault because he is just too dumb to 
understand it. Essays are laced with references to esoteric contemporary 
philosophical systems having to do with the analysis of language and punctuated 
with buzz-words like semiotics, deconstruction, texts and appropriation. 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry. The actual exhibition is considerably more straightforward than 
the writing that is supposed to clarify it. Take just one example by Mitchell 
Syrop, a big painting-cum-poster which reads, "This is one of those great 
masterpieces that will go unrecognized in its own time. This is your 
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make a decision that will reward you in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
Oh. That's easy. Syrop's work is a satire of the shameless commercialism and 
self-promotion rife in today's art world. It is also very much a part of that 
which it satirizes. 
</P>
<P>
Syrop is not the most interesting artist in the exhibition, but he is among the 
most typical. Another group of his poster-like images is united by a common 
slogan familiar from brassiere ads and instructions on how to open packages, 
"Lift and Separate." Syrop combines this slogan with a variety of images -- a 
slick ad photo of an enthralled symphony audience applauding, a workman's lunch 
bucket, fancy silverware. 
</P>
<P>
On the face of it, the recombination seems to demonstrate how the meaning of 
the slogan changes each time it is put up against a different image. On 
reflection, however, we realize that is always saying the same thing, namely 
that advertising always encourages us to better our condition, get richer and 
consume more. That's the "Lift" part. The "Separate" part suggests that as we 
rise in the consumer hierarchy we are parted from any grass-roots group we 
might have come from and are thus less likely to act with them politically to 
improve the lot of the "masses." Syrop is saying that in a capitalist society 
"Lift and Separate" means "Divide and Conquer." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the mild intellectual fun of cracking Syrop's "code," it is hard to 
imagine who would find such tired Marxist cant revelatory. Understanding how 
his art works, however, does cast some general light on the genre -- both the 
artworks and the intellectual fog surrounding them tend to act as a blind for 
social criticism or -- given the markedly equivocal nature of much of the work 
-- social "comment." 
</P>
<P>
Since when does art "comment"? Isn't a comment a fairly minor reaction to the 
main event? Talk-show hosts comment. Cartoonists comment. Recently Doonesbury's 
artist character J.J. was commissioned to paint the john on Donald Trump's 
yacht with a faked-up Michelangelo mural. She decided this outrageous sell-out 
of her talent was a "comment" on nouveau-riche consumerism. 
</P>
<P>
Does Michelangelo's David "comment" on heroism? Tom Lawson presents a piece 
that juxtaposes a photograph of the standing David with a shot of the Forest 
Lawn version toppled by an earthquake. It is a quite wonderful comment on 
artistic authenticity in our time, but that's all it is, a visual quip, a 
one-liner. 
</P>
<P>
The show is full of them. Sara Charlesworth uses the front pages of newspapers 
to remind us that the same stories and images make up the daily news around the 
world. Getchen Bender puts her own captions on TV sets broadcasting the usual 
fare. Richard Prince letters smutty jokes on canvases. 
</P>
<P>
Why does it all seem so flat and familiar? 
</P>
<P>
The work, on the whole, does not react to human reality. It is a reaction to a 
vastly popular substitute for reality: The World According to The Media. 
</P>
<P>
These artists work as if they have no friends, lovers or family. They work as 
if they never left the city or smelled the roses. I take that back. Chris 
Williams photographs flowers like a botanist. Most, however, work as if they 
spent their lives shuttling from reading Foucault and Derrida to staring at the 
telly, analyzing magazines, listening to their Walkmans and having paranoid 
fantasies about the coercions of the American Corporate structure (while 
plotting how to sell art to corporate collections and become art stars). 
</P>
<P>
They have a love-hate obsession with big-league communications. They ape its 
objectivity and get stuck with its deadhead heartlessness. Sure, there are 
exceptions. Jack Goldstein's paintings of electrical storms have a frightening 
cold passion. Jeff Koons' art-vending machine and his kitsch knickknack 
sculpture betray bittersweet affection. Barbara Bloom's neoclassical room gets 
beyond its own feminist "comment" and into a realm of brittle, wistful 
elegance. 
</P>
<P>
"A Forest of Signs" gets one thing wrong from ground zero. The title is from a 
poem by Baudelaire that suggests that the job of art is to find correspondences 
between itself and life. He didn't mean the kinds of intellectualized semaphore 
signals broadcast by this show, he meant correspondences between sensations. 
There is hardly a one to be had here. 
</P>
<P>
All the same, the exhibition, organized by Mary Jane Jacob, is the most 
penetrating survey of its kind I have yet seen. It traces this art's roots from 
Pop and Conceptualism in the '60s to its present estate as what? A kind of 
polite Agit-Pop, a sort of rococo impersonation of the social art of the 
revolutionary Russian avant-garde. It also reads as a strange mutant rebirth of 
middle-class 19th-Century narrative art, which appealed to its bourgeoise 
audience with anecdotes. You don't have to know about art to get this work. 
</P>
<P>
By negatives the exhibition proves that it is not enough for art to reflect its 
society because this surely does that. Art needs to leave itself room to 
express more than it intended. This work is too shallow and too much in 
control. It can only tell us what we already know. Maybe a little more. An 
amount of fear seeps out of Holzer's wallpaper word wall. Longo's contorted 
figures mean to broadcast ambiguous agony, but their detachment curdles into 
nastiness. There is considerable general anxiety around the edges which 
questionsthe whole artistic enterprise as if the artists are wondering if they 
are not wrecking a noble edifice from within. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Kelley presents an installation in the form of a long, narrow corridor 
lined with giant portraits of artists, poets and assorted intellectuals. Each 
bears a quotation in which the subject identifies with violent criminals, 
destructive madmen and social outcasts. Jean Genet says, "I want to sing 
murderers and love murderers." 
</P>
<P>
Having set us up to wallow in this romantic rhetoric, Kelley then opposes it by 
ending the series with a small, barely identifiable drawing of an actual mass 
murderer. At the entrance to the hallway stand plastic containers soliciting 
donations to be given to a Victim's Rights fund. 
</P>
<P>
Kelley's piece recalls that terrible incident when novelist Norman Mailer 
interceded to get a murderer released from prison because he was a gifted 
writer only to have his protege turn around and waste an innocent citizen. 
</P>
<P>
A strange Populist literalism laces Kelley's piece. It tends to make artists 
look like a pack of featherbrained crackpots because it fails to maintain a 
simple distinction between the imaginative and the real. In caving into the 
merely topical and the excessively prosaic, the artists of "A Forest of Signs" 
betray fear of the leap of imagination and threaten themselves with becoming as 
dated and disposable as, well, yesterday's newspaper.

<P>
With Witness (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.) Australian director Peter Weir made an 
exceptionally potent American debut in this intelligent 1985 romantic thriller, 
which found Harrison Ford's Philadelphia cop taking refuge in an Amish 
community, where he and a beautiful young Amish woman (Kelly McGillis) find 
themselves mutually attracted. 
</P>
<P>
The Trial of the Incredible Hulk (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.) brings back Bill Bixby 
and Lou Ferrigno in a new TV movie reprise of their series. This time out 
Bixby's research scientist, Dr. David Banner, is thrown in jail for a crime he 
didn't commit. 
</P>
<P>
Top Gun (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.) is that wildly popular 1986 picture, a male 
bonding adventure that's both mind-boggling and vacuous. Allegedly based on the 
Navy's crack fighter pilot program at San Diego's Miramar Naval Base, it sucks 
us into a high-tech world of multimillion-dollar aircraft and hell-for-leather 
fliers. Tom Cruise is Maverick, an egotistical hotshot pilot; others involved 
are Kelly McGillis, Val Kilmer and Anthony Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
In the dreadful 1981 comedy, Modern Problems (Channel 5 Tuesday at 8 p.m.), 
that air traffic controller Chevy Chase develops telekinetic powers through 
contact with nuclear waste is so grim as to be awe-inspiring in its sheer 
inappropriateness as a source of humor. 
</P>
<P>
The 1982 Fast Times at Ridgemont High (Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) seems an 
ambitious movie struggling against the formula dictum that teen-agers must 
never have anything on their minds but sex. Even so there are many believable 
young people in the film, and they are played by then-such terrific newcomers 
as Jennifer Jason Leigh, Sean Penn and Judge Reinhold. 
</P>
<P>
The new TV movie Murder by Moonlight (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.), a futuristic 
outer space thriller, stars Brigitte Nielsen, Julian Sands and Gerald McRaney. 
</P>
<P>
In The Money Pit (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), New Yorkers Tom Hanks and 
Shelley Long succumb to the temptation of grabbing a million-dollar Long Island 
fixer-upper for a mere $200,000. The stars of this 1986 comedy shine, but it 
might have been funnier had the catastrophes of remodeling not been laid on 
quite so thickly. 
</P>
<P>
Blame It on Rio (Channel 11 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is a misfired 1984 remake of 
the French film "One Wild Moment" in which Michael Caine, who for once cannot 
transcend his material, plays a middle-aged vacationer who winds up in an 
affair with the teen-age daughter (Michelle Johnson) of his best friend (Joseph 
Bologna). 
</P>
<P>
Three Amigos (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), a very broad spoof of silent 
movie making, requires a total ignorance of the era for the humor of this 1986 
film to have a hope of seeming funny. The trio of inept 1916 stars -- Steve 
Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short -- not surprisingly turn real-life heroes. 
</P>
<P>
That multi-Oscar winner One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest returns on Channel 5 
Thursday at 8 p.m., and The Heavenly Kid (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a 
highly derivative and unfunny 1985 teen fantasy comedy that is entirely 
skippable. 
</P>
<P>
Amityville: The Evil Escapes (NBC Friday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie starring 
Patty Duke as a mother confronted with a mysterious evil force threatening to 
destroy her family. 
</P>
<P>
Dim Sum: A Little Bit of Heart (Channel 28 Friday at 11:30 p.m.) evokes with 
tenderness and humor the plight of a young Chinese-American woman (Laureen 
Chew) trying to leave her mother (Kim Chew) in order to make a life of her own. 
An endearing gem of a film. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday evening offers a lineup of familiar fare: 9 to 5 (Channel 5 at 6 
p.m.), On Golden Pond (Channel 5 at 8 p.m.), A Fistful of Dollars (Channel 13 
at 10 p.m.) and Hitchcock's Sabotage (Channel 28 at 10 p.m.).

Are advertising agencies purposely scuttling their clients? An automobile 
manufacturer allows its agency to couple its car with a pig in the minds of TV 
viewers and potential customers. Another TV ad splashes pictures of sloppy 
people chomping on barbecued ribs. Not an appetizing image for the average 
viewer. I'll buy a carton of ladybugs to protect my garden from insects rather 
than purchase a product that uses magnified sounds of someone crunching an 
apple to advertise a safe pesticide. The apple growers should be sore about 
this one; it gives fruit lovers another reason for switching to raspberries.

ADVENTURES IN THE DRUG TRADE; 
</P>
<P>
HOW 4,000 COLOMBIANS TOOK THE 'CHAMPAGNE DRUG' TO THE INNER CITY AND TURNED 
L.A. INTO A COCAINE CAPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM OVEREND, William Overend is a Times staff writer who has covered the 
growing cocaine problem since 1976. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE FORMER OUTLAW drug prince, in T-shirt, jeans and a hippie ponytail, sits in 
his small house near Marina del Rey, recounting his career. In the space of a 
decade, he has seen firsthand an upheaval in the cocaine scene in Los Angeles. 
Marty, one of the names he uses, was one of the most active Westside coke 
dealers in the late 1970s. His customers included some of the most famous 
actors and rock stars in Los Angeles. He cruised the city in rented limousines, 
dined at the most expensive restaurants, bought a few small businesses and 
condos and basked in the status then attached by many to anyone with a constant 
supply of coke. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his hair style, Marty was never a flower child. He had a cynical view 
of the world around him, and he saw himself as a local Al Capone. In the days 
when many L.A. drug dealers went unarmed, he had his own AK-47 automatic rifle 
and a small arsenal of other guns. But they were mainly for show. Marty was one 
of the early breed who wanted to look tough but hesitated when it came to 
violence. By the 1980s, there was real violence all around. The drug world in 
Los Angeles became a bigger, uglier and more vicious business than a generation 
of hometown dealers such as Marty ever anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
"The glamour's gone," he says morosely. "Most of the guys I grew up with are 
out of the business now, trying to make it in the real world. What happened was 
that most of the middle class got scared off coke, and a lot of white dealers 
went broke. When the Colombians and the Mexicans and the blacks moved in, 
everything changed. It's not a rich man's sport anymore. It's a poor man's 
drug. It used to be a big status thing, but any bum can get it now." 
</P>
<P>
Marty, who distributed as much as 50 pounds of cocaine a month during his most 
active years as a dealer, is in semi-retirement now; he stopped his serious 
dealing two years ago, he says. He still dabbles in cocaine, but mostly to cut 
the cost of his own use. His fall from the highest rungs of the L.A. drug 
hierarchy -- along with the demise of many other white coke dealers -- came as 
the public's view of cocaine was dramatically changing. The "champagne drug" of 
the rich in the 1970s has become the plague of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere has the change hit harder or more devastatingly than in Los Angeles, 
which now rivals Miami as the nation's coke capital. Cocaine has taken to the 
streets with a vengeance and become an urban nightmare. Heavily armed street 
gangs make the headlines day after day with their violence. Each week, there is 
a new drug bust that seems to be the biggest in history. The jails are full of 
cocaine users and dealers. And federal drug officials say the city's banks are 
stuffed with billions of dollars in illegal profits being laundered back to 
South America by Colombian mobsters. 
</P>
<P>
The cocaine scene in Los Angeles was transformed by twin revolutions exploding 
across racial, cultural and economic borders. 
</P>
<P>
First came the invasion of Southern California by Colombian drug dealers who 
formerly limited their U.S. cocaine sales to the Miami area. Driven from 
Florida by tough federal law enforcement and good business sense, the 
Colombians saw Los Angeles as a prize target for expansion. Smuggling drugs 
into Miami and then to the rest of the United States had become increasingly 
difficult. Although thousands of miles farther from Colombia, Los Angeles was 
reachable by land routes long used by Mexican drug smugglers. The Colombians 
and Mexico's drug families forged a partnership, and the Colombian drug cartels 
began sending ever-larger shipments of cocaine into California. With the drugs 
came first hundreds, then thousands of Colombian mobsters. 
</P>
<P>
Their arrival in force sounded the death knell for the hometown L.A. coke 
dealers who had monopolized the relatively small cocaine trade during the '70s. 
No longer was a big-time dealer the flashy local boy with Miami connections who 
could bring 20 or 40 pounds of cocaine from Florida to Los Angeles. Now it was 
the unobtrusive Colombian newcomer who just rented the house next door, with 
500 pounds to 1,000 pounds of the drug stacked up like cordwood in the garage. 
</P>
<P>
With that simple change at the dealer level came an even more dramatic shift in 
the user population. Lured to cocaine in the middle 1970s partly by the 
assurances of experts that the drug was non-addictive, with an abuse potential 
"no greater than that of aspirin," according to one Harvard expert, a large 
segment of the white middle class spent a few years of disastrous 
experimentation with the drug before discovering that the "experts" had no idea 
what they were talking about. By the end of this period, tens of thousands of 
white cocaine users in deep trouble were lined up for admission to hospitals 
and drug-treatment programs, confronted by the grim knowledge that their drug 
adventures had turned into horror stories. Although many police officials 
believe that there is just as much white coke use as ever, most agree that it 
has not dramatically increased in recent years and that the typical white user 
has "gone underground." 
</P>
<P>
Just as the white-user population was beginning to peak, however, the rich 
man's drug found its way to the ghetto and the city's black gangs. With the 
spread of crack cocaine in the inner city, a new and poorer user population was 
created virtually overnight in the black community. Crack, a smokable, diluted 
form of cocaine also called rock cocaine, was a cheap high, just as addictive 
to those using it as cocaine itself but much more readily available from 
street- corner dealers selling it for as little as $10 a rock. While the 
battered white users went into hiding, the city's black gangs took cocaine to 
the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Cocaine has become "the fast food of the drug trade," says Ronald K. Siegel, a 
UCLA psychopharmacologist and an authority on cocaine. "It's obviously wreaking 
havoc on the streets. What's happened, essentially, is that cocaine has become 
the kind of drug that the yellow journalism of the 1920s and 1930s told us it 
was." 
</P>
<P>
The Way It Was 
</P>
<P>
IT WAS A GREAT ADVENTURE in the beginning, and Marty still recalls his first 
trip to Miami in 1976 and the secret meetings there with his Cuban and 
Colombian contacts. In those days, the cocaine trade in Los Angeles was 
dominated by white dealers bold enough to risk traveling to Miami or even 
Colombia and carrying back a few kilos at a time. (A kilo is 2.2 pounds.) In an 
era when the seizure of a few ounces of cocaine was a major event for law 
enforcement, a kilo dealer qualified as a big-time operator. Marty saw himself 
in that light. 
</P>
<P>
Marty, a graduate of Santa Monica High School now in his late 30s, had a 
special talent for his work. He had a flair for chemistry and was a natural at 
testing cocaine and picking the purest product. That made him especially 
valuable to the relatively small local drug ring that financed his initial 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Marty's peak year as a drug dealer was 1978, he recalls, when the white middle 
class was experimenting in large numbers with cocaine. The total cocaine 
seizures by the Los Angeles Police Department barely topped 100 pounds -- 
compared with 11,000 pounds in 1988 -- and a multi-kilo dealer such as Marty 
automatically qualified as one of the biggest coke dealers in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The first run to Miami was for a kilo, and we were tooting coke all the way 
back to L.A. in the first-class section of the plane," Marty recalls, smiling 
at the memory. "It was wide open. We might as well have been wearing 'Coke 
Dealer' signs around our necks. In those days, it was anywhere up to $55,000 a 
kilo. You'd carry the money with you to Miami and bring back 2 to 8 kilos on 
the plane. It was always dangerous, but it was a kick at first. Then it was a 
living. Then it was just a job that got more and more boring as the years went 
by." 
</P>
<P>
Marty and a dozen other white dealers once had a virtual monopoly on cocaine 
distribution in West Los Angeles. But law enforcement was increasing its 
efforts, and many of Marty's most important connections ended up in prison. Not 
only did that affect his business, it also made him think about finding another 
way of making a living. About the same time, the Colombians began moving a 
sizable part of their operations to California. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, there were hundreds of newcomers in town with access to literally 
tons of the drug. The days of the white outlaw drug dealer were rapidly ending. 
Marty had other reasons to quit, including his own costly cocaine addiction. 
Even if he could have survived as a major dealer, he had burned himself out in 
one decade of life in the fast lane. For him, the romance was over. 
</P>
<P>
"They give it away now," says Marty, who now works in the construction 
business. "Now it's nothing for somebody to have 30 or 40 kilos in the trunk of 
the car, and those are the errand boys. 
</P>
<P>
"On top of that, the whole scene has changed," he adds. "Now there are black 
dealers moving hundreds of pounds a month, and there's the whole crack scene in 
South-Central. And anybody doing it gets pegged as an addict. There are a few 
whites at the 60-to-80-pound level (per month), but most of the whites I know 
either went broke dealing or became low-level users." 
</P>
<P>
Says one L.A. police officer: "The whites are out of the market because of the 
viciousness of the Colombians and the blacks who have moved into the big time. 
The white guys just aren't up to the final solution, which is murder." 
</P>
<P>
The Colombians Arrive 
</P>
<P>
THE MAN IN THE $5,000 suit at the bar at the Sheraton Grande Hotel in Los 
Angeles in 1985 was one of the new breed of high-rolling Colombian mobsters who 
hastened the demise of early L.A. coke dealers. Just as Marty typified the 
major drug dealers of the 1970s, Hugo Obando Ochoa was the prototypical coke 
dealer of the 1980s. Obando, a former guerrilla fighter in Colombia, had 
slipped across the U.S. border on this visit to Los Angeles to negotiate a 
multimillion-dollar business deal. This millionaire drug dealer from Medellin, 
Colombia, who was given to bragging about his Rodeo Drive wardrobe, was waiting 
at the bar with a man named Joe Lopez, whom he had met through friends in 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Obando felt comfortable enough with Lopez to ask him if he could do him a favor 
by killing three Cuban drug dealers in Miami who had stolen 700 pounds of 
cocaine from him, and Lopez had promised to look into it. The friendship was 
developing, and the two men had progressed to talks about shipping tons of 
cocaine into Los Angeles and laundering millions of dollars in drug profits 
back to Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
What Obando didn't know was that Lopez was an undercover agent of the U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Administration. Obando was a major target in a two-year 
investigation called Operation Pisces, destined to become the single most 
successful undercover drug case in U.S. history. By the time the case ended in 
1987, the DEA had seized $49 million in cash and assets -- $28 million in 
Southern California alone -- and the L.A. Police Department, working in close 
partnership with the DEA, had confiscated more than 11,000 pounds of cocaine. 
Although it received relatively little attention, the undercover operation 
offered the first close look at Colombian drug operations in Los Angeles. 
Almost every major cocaine seizure in the city during that time was a part of 
Pisces. In Los Angeles, there were 220 arrests and more than 190 felony 
convictions of Colombian drug dealers. About $55 million in laundered cash 
headed for Colombia was seized, $40 million of that in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Before Operation Pisces, nobody in law enforcement had an accurate measure of 
the full scope of Colombian drug dealing in Southern California. The 
investigation revealed that the Colombians were in control of the local cocaine 
market, in many cases all the way down to the kilo level. As a result of 
Pisces, DEA officials could estimate with reasonable accuracy that there were 
about 4,000 Colombians in the L.A. area actively involved in dealing cocaine 
and laundering the profits back to Colombia. Hundreds of Colombian drug 
"cells," small units of Colombian dealers and money-launderers operating 
independently along the lines of classic espionage rings, were controlled by 
the cartel in Medellin. The investigation culminated in the arrest and 
conviction of a top Colombian money launderer named Jesus Anibal Zapata, now 
serving a 30-year federal prison term. Federal officials said Zapata, a quiet 
accountant who regularly slipped across the U.S. border from Mexico dressed as 
a Mexican farm worker, was one of the top 20 or 30 members of the Medellin 
cartel, as was Obando. Together the two men were in charge of laundering $17 
million a week in drug profits from Los Angeles to banks in Miami and Panama. 
</P>
<P>
According to information gleaned largely from Pisces, the Colombian drug 
network in the Los Angeles area operates in many ways like any legitimate 
international conglomerate. At the top rungs of the management structure are a 
dozen or so cartel leaders, headed by Pablo Escobar Gaviria, a former Colombian 
politician who helped revolutionize the cocaine market in the early 1970s by 
uniting Colombia's warring drug factions along big business lines. Immediately 
below the top cartel leadership is another group of 20 to 30 lieutenants with 
operational responsibility for moving drugs into the United States and 
funneling profits back to Colombia. The DEA estimates that there are as many as 
several hundred stash houses in Los Angeles County alone, operated by Colombian 
nationals on two-year "tours of duty," who are assigned to find the most 
nondescript locations possible. 
</P>
<P>
"Typically it's one male or a young woman who rents a house in a family area," 
says Assistant U.S. Atty. Russell Hayman, who prosecuted the Pisces cases. 
"Ideally, they want a house on a cul-de-sac (to make surveillance difficult), 
with an automatic garage door so they can move in and out as fast as possible. 
They'll get 1,000 kilos delivered there, then move it out in 50-to-100-kilo 
lots in a week or so. Then the house is vacant for a couple of months until all 
the dope is sold and the money is laundered back to Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
"Then the next shipment comes in. Most of the coke is committed for before it 
ever arrives here, and it's almost always fronted (sold on commission with no 
money exchanged up front). Colombians take most of the 100-kilo assignments and 
the large amounts, then deal it in smaller units to blacks and whites. But, 
more and more, the Colombians and Mexicans are moving in at the lower levels, 
too. There are Colombians dealing kilos and even ounces now." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the drug-dealing activities, there are separate money-laundering 
organizations whose members, at the simplest level, traipse from bank to bank, 
depositing amounts less than $10,000 at as many as 20 banks a day to escape 
federal currency transaction regulations that require the filing of Treasury 
Department reports on transactions of more than $10,000. Federal officials 
estimate that several billion dollars a year is being laundered from Los 
Angeles through Panama and other countries and back to Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, the arrival of the Colombians in Los Angeles has not triggered the 
sort of violence that marked the battles in Miami during the 1970s, when rival 
Colombian factions machine-gunned each other in the streets and attracted 
national notoriety. The prevailing theory is that the Colombians learned the 
same lesson that the Mafia learned decades earlier: Too much violence is bad 
for business. 
</P>
<P>
"The Colombians are like General Motors now," says the DEA's Los Angeles 
spokesman, Ralph Lockridge. "They don't have to go around killing people 
anymore. Their reputation is already secure." 
</P>
<P>
Operation Pisces was an intelligence coup revealing information about Colombian 
operations that is difficult to obtain because the organizations are so tightly 
controlled. "Whenever we take down somebody in a stash house, we get almost 
nothing," says one federal drug agent. "They are told when they come up here 
that if they talk, their families will be killed first, and then they will be 
killed. They just don't roll on their superiors. In most cases, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Although Pisces was obviously a costly blow to the Medellin cartel, letting 
Obando get away was a major disappointment to federal officials. In his earlier 
days, Obando had been a so-called M-19 guerrilla, one of the anti-government 
terrorists devoted to killing Colombian politicians. Like many of the M-19s, 
Obando soon found himself an ally of Colombia's top cocaine dealers, quickly 
rising as one of Escobar's chief lieutenants. Obando was best known in 
drug-dealing circles for his solution to an unexpected wage dispute with an 
American drug smuggler on a Colombian airstrip. When the pilot demanded more 
money, Obando reportedly pulled a pistol, shot him in the leg and ordered him 
to take off immediately if he wanted to stay alive. 
</P>
<P>
A lifetime in the jungles of Colombia and the streets of Medellin had made 
Obando as cautious as he was ruthless. By the end of Operation Pisces, he had 
grown suspicious of Lopez and the other DEA agents who were slowly brought into 
the operation. And when the DEA stalled about paying him $400,000 for 25 kilos 
of coke, he skipped a planned meeting and disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
During Operation Pisces, the DEA had laundered almost $55 million for the 
Medellin cartel through banks in Panama, a move defended by law-enforcement 
officials as necessary in gaining "credibility." Despite the huge drug profits 
that the United States helped channel to Colombia, it remains unknown whether 
the operation had any long-term effect on Escobar's cartel, still the major 
supplier of cocaine to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"His operations were disrupted, and he lost a lot of product and top 
lieutenants. The seizures were unprecedented," Assistant U.S. Atty. Hayman 
says. "But you have to remember we're dealing with a man whose personal wealth 
is now estimated at somewhere between $3 billion and $15 billion. He is 
probably the wealthiest man in the world. We obviously hurt him, but how much 
is anybody's guess." 
</P>
<P>
The New Black Dealers 
</P>
<P>
COINCIDING WITH the mass arrival of Colombian drug dealers in the Los Angeles 
area in the past few years was a virtual revolution in the nationwide marketing 
of cocaine by black drug dealers initially operating in South-Central Los 
Angeles. Although freebase cocaine, at first obtained by a highly volatile 
chemical conversion process using ether, was briefly popular among some white 
users, it never became widespread. In the black community, however, a much 
simpler conversion process that used common baking soda resulted in the 
creation of the smokable freebase form of cocaine known as crack. 
</P>
<P>
A new generation of cocaine users -- those who could not afford $100 for a gram 
of cocaine hydrochloride powder but who could scrape up $20 or less for a rock 
of crack -- was created almost overnight. Although many white users turned to 
crack, it became most popular among inner-city blacks. In the impoverished 
neighborhoods of South-Central Los Angeles, cocaine offered a sudden, new 
opportunity for instant wealth, an opportunity embraced by the city's rival 
gangs. The gangs' involvement and their turf battles over the drug trade set 
the stage for the rise of a new class of prison-toughened black coke dealers, 
already accustomed to violence and much quicker to resort to deadly force than 
their white predecessors. Knowledgeable about the ghetto, they had the 
connections necessary to do business with the city's gangs and the 
sophistication to move outside the inner city to set up new black drug networks 
that quickly stretched from Los Angeles to black areas across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Before the 1980s, Thomas E. (Tootie) Reese had been viewed by law-enforcement 
officials for almost two decades as the top black drug dealer in Los Angeles. 
But the amounts of cocaine he allegedly dealt were infinitesimal contrasted 
with the tonnage now sold monthly by his successors in the black community. One 
white drug dealer remembers Reese's pulling a shotgun on him in the 1970s to 
ensure that he could purchase a pound of cocaine. Later, Reese was sentenced to 
35 years in prison for selling just 2 pounds of cocaine to a DEA agent. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, federal and local drug officials estimate that crack dealing in 
South-Central alone is now a $5-million-a-week business, and there are more 
than a dozen black drug dealers in the city distributing 200 kilos to 300 kilos 
of Colombian cocaine a month. The key to their dramatic ascendancy was the 
establishment of direct links with Colombians. One theory of some narcotics 
agents is that the blacks and Colombians connected in the nation's prison 
system. Others take the view, however, that Colombians actively sought out 
black dealers during the past three years, trying to cash in on the growing 
demand for crack cocaine in the black community. In either event, according to 
law-enforcement officials, the ties are solid. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, the major drug cases in both the state and federal courts in Los 
Angeles involve black dealers charged with the sale of millions of dollars' 
worth of cocaine. One recent case that most clearly shows the Colombian 
connection involved the November arrest of a former South-Central street thug 
named Brian (Waterhead Bo) Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say Bennett, just 24, had risen from inner-city poverty to millionaire 
status in just two years after meeting a Colombian drug dealer named Mario 
Ernesto Villabona Alvarado, a member of Colombia's Cali cartel, the chief rival 
to Escobar's group. It's not known whether Bennett was recruited or if he met 
Villabona by chance. But drug officials allege that the two organized a drug 
ring based in Los Angeles that distributed more than a ton of crack a week from 
Los Angeles to Detroit. Says Deputy Los Angeles Police Chief Glenn Levant, who 
supervises all narcotics investigations for the LAPD: "This is the single most 
important partnership ever established between a major South-Central drug 
dealer and the Colombians. Bennett was supplying thousands of rock houses all 
over the country, and his connection was straight out of Colombia." Bennett, 
whose trial is scheduled for September, is pleading not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
By the time of Bennett's arrest, he had moved from Los Angeles to Arizona, 
where he was living in a $1-million house. Increasingly, that has been the 
pattern of the most successful black drug dealers who started on the streets of 
South-Central. While deriving their income from the inner city, the black 
dealers prefer to live in mansions in the suburbs. In their place, they leave 
gang members as young as 13 to man their rock houses and to be the small-time 
street dealers who now are among the city's most troublesome problems. "It's 
not the big-time drug dealer who's most likely to shoot you," says DEA 
spokesman Lockridge. "It's the small-time guy who doesn't know any better. The 
black street dealers are scary because they are unpredictable. A lot of those 
people have very little to live for." 
</P>
<P>
The Way it Will Be 
</P>
<P>
ANY LOCAL LAW-enforcement officials are convinced that Los Angeles has become 
the new Miami, the emerging center of the nation's drug industry. There is some 
evidence to support that view, including the fact that a kilogram of cocaine 
now sells locally for about $14,000, about $2,000 less than in Miami -- one 
indication that there is more cocaine on the market here. Last year, for the 
first time in history, federal and local drug agents seized more cash from drug 
dealers in Los Angeles -- more than $100 million -- than anywhere else in the 
country. Cash reserves at the Federal Reserve Bank in Los Angeles now top $3.8 
billion, up from $165 million just four years ago and just $1 billion less than 
in Miami, indicating to federal drug officials the massive money-laundering 
activity here. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no other explanation for that much of an increase in cash reserves," 
says U.S. Atty. Robert C. Bonner. "The Colombians are now laundering staggering 
amounts of cash out of Los Angeles. A very conservative estimate is several 
billion dollars a year. Two years ago, the figure was closer to $1 billion." 
</P>
<P>
The fact remains that actual seizures of cocaine in South Florida are still 
double the total in Southern California, where about 30,000 pounds was 
confiscated in 1988. The result is a somewhat academic debate over which city 
is really the worst. To DEA officials in Washington, D.C. -- who have assigned 
190 drug agents to Miami, in contrast with 125 to the Los Angeles region -- 
Miami remains the center of Colombian activities. "Miami is still ahead," says 
DEA Washington spokesman Joe Keefe. "It is the main center for coke in this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Bonner, who has spent the past six years watching more than 1,500 major drug 
dealers file from the U.S. Courthouse in Los Angeles into prisons throughout 
the country, is one of the many local officials who dispute that assessment. "I 
think the amount of coke coming here now is significantly higher than the DEA 
estimates," he says. "We have become a cocaine warehouse for much of the 
country, with shipments going out regularly to Detroit and Chicago and New 
York. We've even intercepted one shipment going into Florida. All this suggests 
to me that over 50% is now coming into L.A. 
</P>
<P>
"In time, that will become even clearer," Bonner says. "It just makes sense for 
the Colombians to shift more of their operations here. It's easier to get coke 
across the Mexican border than through the Florida sea lanes, where there are 
natural choke points that make interdiction easier." 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, Colombia's drug cartels have confined their violence to 
Colombia, where dozens of judges and political leaders have been killed and 
where the families of cartel members are frequently held as hostages while 
their relatives perform cartel work in the United States. Threats by some 
Colombian drug kingpins, however, have many U.S. officials worried that the 
violence in Colombia may ultimately be exported to the United States. In recent 
months, federal officials have received information that Colombia's drug lords 
are considering striking back against U.S. authorities for their stepped-up 
law-enforcement activities. The U.S. Marshal's Service is guarding at least two 
local federal prosecutors now involved with Colombian drug cases. 
</P>
<P>
Although the cocaine problem has grown dramatically, the proposed solutions are 
the same as they've been for most of the decade. Crack down harder. Legalize 
everything. Emphasize long-range educational programs such as the Los Angeles 
Police Department's DARE program in the schools. Invade Colombia. Seal off the 
Mexican border. Meanwhile, an estimated 300,000 pounds of cocaine found its way 
to Los Angeles in 1988, and law-enforcement officials agree that there is no 
decline in sight. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Bonner says, "I guess my general sense is that in many ways we have 
begun to turn the corner on the drug problem . . . that coke usage has peaked. 
The problem is that the peak is very, very high." 
</P>
<P>
But UCLA's Siegel has darker view. "I know the anti-drug advertisements today 
promote the idea that cocaine will fry your brain," he says. "But I don't 
believe the health issues with cocaine have ever had a deterrent effect or ever 
will. We have one or two deaths a day in the United States from cocaine, 
compared to hundreds a day from alcohol. We can live with cocaine toxicity. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, what we are going to see next is coca cultivation in the United 
States," Siegel says. "I've seen small fields in California. Right now it's 
window-box growing -- people doing it for personal use. But it's simple to move 
from that point to larger operations."

Operation Pisces, the federal Drug Enforcement Administration's huge, two-year 
undercover effort, was an intelligence coup that revealed the inner workings of 
the drug trade from Colombia to the United States. When the case ended in 1987, 
officials had arrested 220 drug dealers and seized $28 million in cash and 
assets and more than 11,000 pounds of cocaine in Southern California. Here is 
an illustration of the flow of drugs and money between Colombia and Los 
Angeles, and some of the main players. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JUAN SANCHEZ-PEREZ 
</P>
<P>
Colombian drug dealer. Arrested with 10 other Colombians at one of three Orange 
County stash houses April 4, 1986. 1,600 pounds of coke, $728,225 in cash 
seized. Sentenced to 14 years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JORGE RESTREPO 
</P>
<P>
Colombian drug dealer, money launderer. Arrested near LAX with 65 pounds of 
coke on March 24, 1987; 1,660 additional pounds seized at a stash house in 
Rowland Heights. Sentenced to 20 years in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LEOPOLDO PILOTO 
</P>

JAMES A. VAN HORN JR. sits at a table in the spacious Congressional Room of the 
Capital Hilton in Washington, listening as a parade of federal bureaucrats 
prescribe their latest remedies for America's drug problem. The husky, heavily 
bearded mayor of Artesia doesn't need to be reminded of the facts that brought 
him here: The county of Los Angeles has 80,000 known gang members. That's the 
equivalent of four Army divisions, he'll tell you. They control the streets and 
franchise the drug trade. The police are outmanned and outgunned. 
</P>
<P>
So far, there have only been a few murders, only one drug-dealing gang in Van 
Horn's predominantly working- class, industrial community. But, as he likes to 
say: "The hoodlums of Los Angeles don't know any boundaries." 
</P>
<P>
So heavily does the problem of drugs weigh on the spirits of Van Horn and most 
American mayors that they have changed the name of their annual "National 
Conference on Crime" in Washington this year to "National Conference on Crime 
and Drugs." And most invoke the imagery of war when they call on the federal 
government to help them eliminate the scourge of drugs. "The country doesn't 
need a federal narcotics czar. It needs a supreme allied commander," Van Horn 
tells the mayors. He envisions that commander leading an army with a 
single-minded mission: to squelch the drug hoodlums and wipe out the supply of 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
But what he hears from the experts he'd hoped to count on to lead the war 
against drugs drives him to fury. Some of the federal bureaucrats in the 
forefront of the war are urging the mayors to focus on cutting the demand for 
drugs, not the supply. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in law enforcement for 24 years," Thomas C. Kelly, the smiling, 
smooth-shaven deputy administrator of the federal government's Drug Enforcement 
Administration, tells the mayors, "but I'm not ashamed to tell you that law 
enforcement is not the answer to our problem." 
</P>
<P>
On hearing that, Van Horn steps up to a microphone near his table and bellows 
into it angrily. "You see, guys, the Viet Cong is abroad in our society," he 
shouts. "We have guerrillas in the street armed with AK assault rifles. Our job 
now is to get our streets back." The mayor demands that the United States 
recall its troops from Europe, where, he says, they are unwanted anyway, and 
enlist them in the fight against drugs. All the money saved from closing bases 
overseas could then fund more police. "What we don't need," he says to a 
reporter later, "are bureaucrats who sit in Washington and pontificate about 
demand. I'm sick of it." 
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the nation's mayors reflects a bitter truth about the nature of 
the country's fearsome drug problem: While public pressure mounts and 
politicians sound ever-more-strident calls for a renewed war on drugs, a deep 
sense of pessimism pervades the ranks of the specialists who deal most directly 
with narcotics and narcotics addicts. They've been thwarted, they say, at every 
turn. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Reuter is an Australian researcher for the RAND Corp. whose work is 
highly regarded by specialists on all sides of the narcotics field. "At the 
moment," he says, sitting in his book-lined office in Washington, "the 
conventional wisdom is (that) nothing works. It's a view that comes out of 
despair." 
</P>
<P>
Reuter does not share this despair completely, but he contributed to it last 
year with a pair of reports crammed with statistical evidence indicating that 
the much-publicized patrolling of borders and policing of the streets during 
the past eight years have failed to damage the drug trade significantly. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush is not ready to accept this dismal view. He and federal drug 
czar William J. Bennett often invoke furious allusions to war when they talk 
about drugs. Last month, in his first dramatic act as director of the White 
House Office of National Drug Control Policy, Bennett excoriated the Washington 
drug scene as being "out of control," scorned the leaders of the city and sent 
a task force of federal agents into the battle. Bennett's tone was so 
belligerent that Rep. Lawrence J. Smith (D-Fla.) mocked him for trying to act 
like "a supercop with a red cape and blue suit." 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the rhetoric, however, Bush and his officials acknowledge that the 
paramilitary approach so dear to the hearts of many politicians falls short of 
a complete answer. And there is little doubt that Bennett, as he develops the 
national drug-control strategy he's required to outline under the 1988 law that 
created his job, will underscore the more soft-spoken themes already voiced by 
the DEA's Kelly and by the President. 
</P>
<P>
Bush proclaimed in a Feb. 10 address to a joint session of Congress that "the 
scourge of drugs must be stopped." He asked for almost a billion dollars more 
in spending "to escalate the war against drugs . . . on all fronts." He said 
the money should be spent on border controls, tough law enforcement, education 
and research. 
</P>
<P>
"But for all we do in law enforcement, in interdiction and treatment," Bush 
went on, "we will never win this war on drugs unless we stop the demand for 
drugs." The President was echoing a prevalent view in the federal government 
these days that sounds like an answer to a sphinx's riddle: If you can't cut 
the demand for drugs, it's a hopeless task trying to cut off the supply; if you 
can cut the demand, it won't matter what happens to the supply. 
</P>
<P>
Even as Washington prepares to pour millions of new dollars into the nation's 
struggle, the people closest to the problem -- from front-line police officers 
to doctors and scientists probing the roots of drug use -- admit that they have 
little confidence in anything they've tried so far. 
</P>
<P>
The Failure of the Reagan War 
</P>
<P>
THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION put most of its faith and resources into the 
paramilitary approach to fighting drugs. Treatment and education were neglected 
while federal narcotics agents, customs officers, Coast Guardsmen, border 
guards, local police, prosecutors and judges concentrated on fighting the 
system that supplies the drugs. The statistics seemed impressive: Seizures of 
cocaine and heroin, numbers of arrests, length of jail terms all increased 
dramatically. But so did the supply of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The value of such policing was directly challenged last year in the depressing 
reports done by research teams working under Reuter at the RAND Corp., the 
prestigious research institute that often prepares studies for the Department 
of Defense. 
</P>
<P>
In the first report, requested by the Pentagon, the RAND team concluded that 
the U.S. government, despite having spent more than $700 million a year on 
trying to stop cocaine from crossing the borders, had accomplished little more 
than increasing the earnings of producers in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. 
Whenever cocaine is seized, smugglers simply buy more from the producers and 
try again to slip it into the United States. The total seized by the Coast 
Guard and Customs Bureau increased from 1.7 metric tons of cocaine in 1981 to 
27.2 metric tons in 1986. (One metric ton is about 2,205 pounds.) 
</P>
<P>
But the researchers insisted that these enormous seizures -- usually ballyhooed 
as battlefield victories -- only reflect the increase in the amount of cocaine 
entering the United States. Citing official surveys, the RAND report estimated 
that cocaine imports jumped from between 38 tons and 68 tons in 1981 to between 
111 tons and 153 tons in 1985. The cost of cocaine in the United States, 
according to the Department of Justice, dropped from $60,000 a kilogram in 1981 
to $35,000 a kilogram in 1986, another sign that, despite the war, cocaine was 
more -- not less -- plentiful in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"If . . . the United States wished to prevent the smuggling of 
Japanese-manufactured automobiles, it could probably succeed with relatively 
little effort," Reuter wrote. " . . . Cocaine represents almost the opposite 
kind of target. . . . A single cargo plane, fully loaded, could supply the 
nation's current demand for a year." 
</P>
<P>
The second RAND report -- an analysis of the war on drugs in Washington 
prepared for the Greater Washington Research Center -- was even more 
discouraging for police and narcotics agents. Despite all the abuse heaped upon 
Washington these days as a glaring failure in law enforcement, many politicians 
and drug experts were praising it just a couple of years ago as a grand 
success. Specialists had looked on the capital as a model city in terms of its 
attempt to wipe out the drug trade through tough enforcement. Washington police 
had organized sweeps of drug markets without letup. In six years, the number of 
arrests for drug trafficking increased more than 12 times, from 408 in 1981 to 
5,274 in 1986. Prosecutors indicted a heavy percentage of those arrested, 
juries convicted them, and judges doubled the average length of prison 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the researchers could find no evidence that law enforcement had hurt the 
drug trade. Police raids of markets often did little more than drive these 
markets to other streets. The street price of drugs even declined. The 
percentage of arrested Washingtonians testing positive for cocaine increased 
from 15% in March, 1984, to 60% in December, 1987. Studying results from these 
tests and from polls of the rest of the population, Reuter wrote: "The 
available drug-use indicators show no decline. Indeed they point to growing use 
for more dangerous drugs" -- mainly crack, a cheaper and smokable form of 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"More disturbing," the report went on, "is the possibility that the intensified 
enforcement has raised the violence of the drug trade, simply because the 
participants feel more threatened. . . . Dealers threatened with a high 
probability of a lengthy prison sentence following arrest have strong 
incentives for resistance." 
</P>
<P>
As crack dealers fought over territory in a new market, murders increased 
steadily in Washington, reaching a record of 372 last year. 
</P>
<P>
In this climate of escalating violence, the federal narcotics czar allocated 
most of the $70 million to $80 million to be poured into the city's "drug 
emergency assistance program" into more law-enforcement measures: a task force 
of 57 federal agents to wipe out the city's open-air drug markets, a new 
detention center and a new prison. He also assigned 25 FBI agents and 10 U.S. 
military lawyers to augment the task force's investigations. 
</P>
<P>
But, following the latest strategy, Bennett did not ignore treatment and 
education, promising to build three new clinics to treat a total of 300 
outpatients and to increase federal spending for drug-prevention programs in 
the Washington schools to $1.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Bennett program evokes little enthusiasm from most specialists. Says 
James Fyfe, a tall, baggy-sweatered former New York City policeman who is now a 
professor of criminal justice at American University in Washington: "It's like 
little Peter putting his finger in the dike. He can't keep his finger in there 
forever. Someday you have to fix the dike." Fyfe insists that Washington will 
never solve the inner-city problems of drugs and crime until American society 
faces up to the root causes of poverty and racial discrimination that spawn the 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
But most law-enforcement officials do not intend to wait for that utopia. They 
are placing their hopes of cutting the demand for drugs on education and 
treatment -- even though most of these hopes are founded on meager evidence. 
Relatively little education and treatment has been tried. In 1986, according to 
the RAND Corp., federal, state and municipal governments spent $6 billion on 
drug law enforcement nationally and less than $600 million on education and 
treatment. Surely, some officials believe, the drug problem can be eased 
dramatically by putting far more money into education and treatment than ever 
before. But experience to date offers little certainty of their effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
The Trials of Treatment 
</P>
<P>
JAMES P. MORAN JR. is the genial mayor of Alexandria, Va., a town in the 
Washington suburban area that encompasses some of the area's most affluent -- 
and some of its poorest -- neighborhoods. Moran started a treatment program a 
few years ago to treat heroin addicts by substituting oral doses of methadone, 
an addictive, though less harmful, drug. The clinic, supported by local taxes, 
is the only one of its kind in Northern Virginia, and an average of 160 
addicts, a few driving 50 to 60 miles each way, show up every day. The clinic 
recommends three years of treatment, but many patients drop out sooner. Studies 
show that methadone-treated patients, even if their habit cannot be broken, 
tend to avoid heroin and crime and have no need for the needles that spread 
AIDS. But Moran is unhappy with his program's results. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not only that it costs more than a luxury hotel," he says. "You also have 
to factor in the low rate of success." He estimates that, as in most methadone 
programs, only 15% to 20% of those treated at the Alexandria clinic break their 
addiction to heroin. If you tack on the cost of unsuccessful treatments to that 
of the few successes, the mayor went on, you come up with a figure of $60,000 
for every addict treated successfully. "It's just not worth it," Moran says. 
"We're not successful with treatment. Most of the money you put into treatment 
is wasted right now." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, with the federal government viewing addiction as more of a police 
problem than a health problem, there were not enough treatment facilities to 
meet the demand. Yet, when treatment expands under Bennett's developing 
proposals to cut drug use, the results could still disappoint the public. 
Methadone treatment -- regarded as the most successful way to break the heroin 
habit -- has a relapse rate estimated at 80%. Cocaine treatment is discouraging 
as well. Scientists have not developed any legal drug like methadone to 
substitute for cocaine, so doctors depend mainly on counseling, trying to 
rebuild the personality of a patient and hoping to eliminate the problems that 
made cocaine attractive in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Although smoking cocaine or crack is regarded as just as addictive as injecting 
heroin because it is absorbed so quickly by the body, snorting cocaine is 
considered less addictive. That may explain why treatment for cocaine is 
somewhat more successful than treatment for heroin. But the record is hardly 
impressive. In 1986, for example, doctors could classify only 38% of the 
patients completing cocaine treatment in southern Maryland as cured or free of 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers actually know very little about the causes and treatment of 
addiction. They cannot even agree on a definition of an addict. Dependence on a 
drug is both psychological and physical. According to a 1981 study, for 
example, heroin addicts tend to lose their craving when they can't get drugs in 
prison, but the craving returns once they are released. 
</P>
<P>
The main goal of a treatment clinic, then, is to keep addicts away from a drug 
while helping them overcome the withdrawal pains. Doctors have two methods: 
detoxification -- where no other drug substitutes for the withdrawn drug -- 
and, in the case of heroin addicts, methadone substitution. In an influential 
book, James B. Bakalar and Lester Grinspoon of the psychiatry department of the 
Harvard Medical School concluded that detoxification usually offers only 
temporary relief, while substituting one opiate for another is not a cure but 
simply a way of reducing the inconvenience of addiction. 
</P>
<P>
"Evaluations of drug-treatment programs," Bakalar and Grinspoon write, "show 
that once detoxification or methadone maintenance has ended, we have no clear 
idea of what to do." 
</P>
<P>
According to a nationwide study by the National Institute of Drug Abuse, a 
majority of patients treated for heroin or heavy cocaine addiction were using 
drugs again at least once a week within a year after they finished treatment. 
Doctors have recorded cures mainly with patients breaking a mild dependence on 
marijuana or alcohol. Many psychologists insist that relapse is almost certain 
whenever a supposedly cured addict returns to the same environment that made 
drugs irresistible in the first place -- poverty, unemployment and despair, in 
the case of most inner-city addicts. "Recovery from drug dependency is a long 
process," Reuter wrote in his report on Washington, "often requiring the 
dependent person to rebuild his life." It's a challenge for any treatment 
program. 
</P>
<P>
PLAN B: EDUCATION 
</P>
<P>
IF TREATMENT, police work and the Border Patrol have failed, the current 
reasoning goes, perhaps we should stress prevention. There is a kind of 
desperation in this last hope, a dependence born of pessimism. Says Reuter with 
a smile: "As an Australian, I can say this: Americans are big on prevention. An 
ounce of prevention is worth God-knows-how-many kilos of cure." He is not 
mocking American faith in education but warns that much of the hope could be 
shattered. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any data (showing) it prevents future use," says William 
Claiborn, who runs the Alexandria, Va., drug-education program. "We have faith 
and hope that it works." 
</P>
<P>
Critics believe that some education programs have been crippled by exaggerating 
the dangers of drugs. Principals and teachers, watched closely by city 
officials, feel pressured not to teach pupils that marijuana, although harmful, 
is less addicting than cigarettes. A Department of Education pamphlet, issued 
by Bennett when he was secretary of education, insisted that "cocaine in any 
form can cause cardiac arrest and death." Yet the late Norman E. Zinberg, a 
Harvard University psychiatrist regarded as one of the nation's leading 
specialists on drug problems, concluded that "despite the publicity surrounding 
individual cases, death from cocaine caused by heart stoppage is rare." Failing 
to acknowledge such information, school programs can lose credibility. 
</P>
<P>
But more-honest programs could be even more harmful. "Several studies have 
demonstrated that drug education . . . has usually resulted in an increase in 
use," Zinberg wrote recently. 
</P>
<P>
There is a good deal of controversy, as well, over media campaigns. Some 
educators believe that sports stars who have broken a drug habit can drive the 
anti-drug message home to youngsters. But "messages from athletes who have been 
treated for alcohol or drug abuse, whatever the intent," wrote Reuter, "may 
just reinforce the impression that this is what stars do, and you can get away 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
The most prominent media campaign in recent years was the Just Say No drive of 
Nancy Reagan. Her aim was to persuade schoolchildren to reject any drug offered 
them "by just saying no." Although it is hard to prick holes in this kind of 
publicity, many critics insisted that it diverted attention and resources to a 
minor part of the drug problem. Just Say No, with all its emphasis on children 
forming anti-drug clubs and signing anti-drug pledges, was aimed at 
middle-class America. It is much like joining the Boy Scouts. Desperately 
impoverished children in the South Bronx tend not to become Scouts; neither do 
they sign pledges for Nancy Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Critics like Zinberg also believe that Nancy Reagan oversimplified the problem. 
"The Just Say No attitude," he said, "doesn't leave much room for 
experimentation. If you think that any thing less than stamping out drug use is 
condoning it, you can't get anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
A LAST RESORT: LEGALIZATION 
</P>
<P>
LEGALIZATION IS SO delicate a subject that a criminal court judge in a large 
city will only speak about it softly, carefully and anonymously in the privacy 
of his chambers. "For a kid on the streets," he says, "the choice is working at 
McDonald's for $3.35 an hour for four hours a day or earning a thousand dollars 
a day with drugs. You and I would make the same choice in their situation. The 
decision is based on rationality. 
</P>
<P>
"I know of no judge who will hesitate about locking up an addict and throwing 
the key away if he has committed a crime injuring someone," the judge goes on. 
"And yet, every time I do this, I realize that I am driving up the black market 
price of drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Such talk often leads to more discussion of the possibility of some kind of 
legalization of drugs to put an end to the incredibly lucrative black market, 
but the subject never gets very far. Proponents of legalization feel certain 
that it would reduce murders and other crime but have a harder time making a 
case that it would cut drug use. 
</P>
<P>
The question is still largely academic, anyhow. The idea of legalization is too 
abhorrent for most Americans and their politicians to contemplate. American 
views on the subject are so strong that officials have difficulty initiating 
any program that seems to allow any use of drugs without punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, for the first time in decades, a few distinguished voices were raised last 
year in favor of some kind of legalization of drugs that might put them in 
somewhat the same legal category as alcohol and tobacco -- two harmful, 
addictive substances that are frowned on but not treated by society as criminal 
and evil. Mayor Kurt Schmoke of Baltimore, a former federal prosecutor and 
Rhodes scholar, shocked the U.S. Conference of Mayors last year by proposing 
that they look into legalization. "Profit is the engine driving drug 
traffickers," Schmoke wrote later. Legalizing drugs, he said, would "take the 
profit out of their enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
A similar call came from Ethan A. Nadelman, a Princeton public affairs 
professor, in the prestigious quarterly Foreign Policy. But even while 
proposing legalization, Nadelman recognized the near-futility of raising the 
issue with policy makers. "Indeed, the very suggestion of such a possibility 
quickly conjures up images of an America transformed into a modern-day Sodom 
and Gomorrah," he wrote. "Yet there are powerful reasons to at least attempt a 
reasoned analysis of the costs and benefits of current drug policies." 
</P>
<P>
The calls for legalization have whipped up hardly any support. In the three-day 
Washington conference on crime and drugs in early February, the mayors never 
mentioned legalization, not even to knock it down. 
</P>
<P>
DANGERS OF THE WAR MENTALITY 
</P>
<P>
FEDERAL DRUG czar Bennett, in his belligerent mood, and with Atty. Gen. Dick 
Thornburgh and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp at his 
side, announced the federal war on the Washington drug market at a highly 
publicized news conference. Marion Barry, the troubled black mayor of largely 
black Washington, was nowhere in sight. The mood, the tone and the setting 
exacerbated one of the concerns of many critics of federal policy -- the fear 
that the war on drugs may turn into a war on blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett's aggressive manner, in fact, seems to have evoked a good deal of 
sympathy for Barry, long under a cloud because of his reported personal 
contacts with alleged drug dealers. "I wonder if Bennett would have said the 
same things and done the same things," says Fyfe of American University, "if 
the mayor was white and there was a different population in the city." 
</P>
<P>
It's no coincidence, some observers believe, that the government's fierce 
crackdown on drug users is occurring when the user population has shifted from 
being largely white to largely nonwhite. Statistics indicate that the decline 
in use of cocaine by middle-class whites has been paralleled by an increase in 
the use of cocaine -- in the form of crack -- among poor blacks. Mark Gold, who 
runs a New Jersey telephone hot-line service on cocaine problems, reported 
that, in 1983, 50% of the calls came from college-educated cocaine users, a 
figure that dropped to 16% in 1987. At the same time, the percentage of calls 
from unemployed cocaine users increased from 16% to more than 50%. 
</P>
<P>
Heavily financed education and treatment programs could further widen this gap, 
feeding speculation that the drug problem could be perceived as a black problem 
in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
"If this war heats up," said Zinberg just before his death April 2, "it will 
not be just a war on drugs but a war mobilized by the reigning cultural 
majority, the franchised and employed, against a minority -- an essentially 
disenfranchised and deeply alienated segment of our society." 
</P>
<P>
Endorsing this theory, David F. Musto of Yale University, a prominent historian 
of American drug policy, insists that "a two-tier system" is developing in 
American attitudes toward drugs. Middle-class whites, according to Musto, are 
realizing that drug use "is damaging to their long-term interests." But "these 
restraints don't exist in the inner city," he says. As a result, there is 
continued and even growing drug use among poor blacks, who feel they do not 
have jobs or educational opportunities to lose, he says. And middle-class 
whites who give up drugs "become very intolerant" and look on drug users "as 
beyond the pale." 
</P>
<P>
Yet speculation about a war on drugs turning against blacks does not sound 
persuasive to black leaders. Most want to drive drugs from their communities 
and, like President Bush, insist that this can be done only through a war on 
many fronts. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking anonymously again in his chambers, the criminal court judge, who 
believes that many of the nation's tough policies are self-defeating, deplored 
the attitude of those black leaders. "One major problem," he says, "is that the 
minority community is the strongest that believes a war on drugs is necessary. 
They are afraid that anything else represents an attempt by others to abandon 
their community." 
</P>
<P>
The imagery of war creates other problems. The rigidity of public attitudes 
toward drugs makes research difficult. All the bluster blurs scientific focus. 
It is difficult, for example, to regard addicts as victims of a disease when 
the drumbeat of war makes them seem like enemies of the state. Moreover, while 
some specialists believe in the eventual success of treatment and education, 
they fear that both will show such slow progress that Congress and the public, 
in a mood for quick and total victories, will give up on them. 
</P>
<P>
As the Bush Administration formulates its own version of the war on drugs, the 
nation seems to be in for a good deal more anger and frustration -- much like 
the dramatic outburst of Mayor Van Horn of Artesia at the mayors' conference. 
And that, some scholars fear, could leave the country with problems even more 
damaging than drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"What will happen to the enormous fear and hostility that are building up on 
drugs?" Musto asks philosophically. "People can get so angry at the drug use in 
the inner city that they will believe everyone there is a drug user." As a 
result, the historian warns, most Americans could lose the patience to invest 
the time and money needed to create the schools, jobs and community spirit that 
could drive drugs from the inner cities in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to have public policies that cause more harm than good," he 
says.

Drawing, COLOR, Lane Smith ; Photo, COLOR, As police tactics prove ineffective 
against the growing drug trade, emphasis is shifting to treatment and 
prevention. Experts caution, however, that approaches including group therapy, 
Just Say No programs and methadone treatment have shown little success. Alan

OUTTAKES: WHERE THERE'S A WILLA

How did producer Robert Radnitz ("Sounder," "Cross Creek") manage to get the 
rights to the late Willa Cather's "Oh, Pioneers"? Following a film adaptation 
of her novel "A Lost Lady" in 1934, she decided never to allow another one of 
her books to be filmed -- a stipulation in her will when she died in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
"I was first aware of this when I tried to get Cather's 'Death Comes to the 
Archbishop' in the 1950s," Radnitz told us. "Over the years I'd inquire about 
one book or another but the answer was always a polite no." 
</P>
<P>
However, last year, while Radnitz negotiated for film rights to Elizabeth 
Speare's Newbery Award-winning "The Witch of Blackbird Pond," the publisher 
(who also reps the Cather estate) told Radnitz that he would talk to Charles 
Cather, the author's nephew, about "Pioneers." Cather and Radnitz met and a 
deal was recently reached, which includes consultation with the estate. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of my great dreams," said Radnitz, "and I realized that I've got an 
extra challenge to do it right and with respect or Cather will be out of reach 
again." Leonard Klady

"Pieces of Silver," the latest film from Oscar-winning compilist Chuck Workman 
("Precious Images"), has been pulled from the Cannes Film Festival. "Pieces" -- 
310 sequences celebrating the 100th anniversary of Edison's purchase of Eastman 
Kodak film for moving pictures, running 7 1/2 minutes -- hit clearance 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to scenes from American and foreign movies, "Pieces" -- which 
premiered at the recent AFI Fest -- includes anim-ation, newsreels, 
commercials, documentaries, experimental films and home movies. It will be 
distributed through the National Assn. of Theater Owners this 
summer.538976343have all rights secured. But the French felt otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm annoyed but there's nothing that can be done now," Workman said. "I always 
make the films first and get the rights later. It's creatively more effective 
because you work without constraints." Leonard Klady

LOOKS: A L'ORANGE; 
</P>
<P>
THE FRESHEST COLOR IN FASHION INSPIRES A TANGY NEW TWIST IN MAKEUP SHADES 
</P>

ORANGE -- A COLOR born in Southern California -- is emerging as a major 
spring/summer fashion shade. Now orange lipstick, nail polish, blusher and even 
eye shadow are part of the trend. As Vivian Behrens, vice president of 
marketing for Estee Lauder, says: "Orange is going through a major 
reawakening." 
</P>
<P>
Once pegged as a makeup color for casual, beachy, California types, orange 
became sophisticated and internationally important last fall when French and 
Italian designers showed their purple and khaki spring fashions on models 
wearing orange cosmetics. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Paul Gaultier not only featured orange on his models' lips and eyelids but 
also scattered a few "I Love Lucy" redheads throughout his fashion show. 
Gianfranco Ferre used deep mango and persimmon shades on lips and nails to 
accent his elegant evening gowns and swimwear. And New York's pricey designers 
-- Donna Karan, Louis Dell'Olio for Anne Klein and the upstart Isaac Mizrahi -- 
all have used orange as a spring staple. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, many women would not wear orange clothes because the yellow 
undertones in pumpkin-orange seemed to drain their complexions of color. But 
this season, fashion designers are using oranges that are rich with red or gold 
undertones. With the right makeup, the new oranges can make skin tones come 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
Estee Lauder is offering bold oranges in its Heading West and Perfect Lipsticks 
collections. Behrens of Estee Lauder reports that consumers are eagerly opting 
for the bright new oranges. A new Lauder moisturizing lipstick called Perfect 
Orange has been a sell-out success in every store that carries it, she says. 
</P>
<P>
"The sun-streaked look is hot right now, and the trend is going to continue 
through the summer," Behrens says, adding that touches of orange makeup are the 
perfect complement to the sunny look. 
</P>
<P>
Clinique's newest shades include Sun Tang, a rich coral lipstick pencil with a 
built-in sun-protection factor. 
</P>
<P>
Princess Marcella Borghese's Tangeri is a deep, true-orange lip color that is 
sold in the same collection with orange eye shadow from Borghese's Solare 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
In its see-through tube, Sunshine gloss from Christian Dior looks just like 
Crayola orange, but on the lips it becomes a sheer, golden tint. Yves Saint 
Laurent's summer line features a lip and nail color called Golden Apricot. 
</P>
<P>
Max Factor's Chameleon, a versatile coral, can be worn with pink and red 
outfits as well as with shades of orange. Maybelline is promoting mocha- and 
ginger-color lipstick that is worn with apricot blusher. 
</P>
<P>
Whether intense or barely there, the overall effect of beauty's new oranges is 
decidedly tawny yet sophisticated. As Gale Hayman, the Beverly Hills cosmetics 
manufacturer, says: "This is the look that started in California and came back 
via Paris."

SOUND &amp; VISION: FACE THE VIDEO AND DANCE; 
</P>
<P>
NENAH CHERRY, INNER CITY GET INTO THE GROOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The advent of the video disco has been a mixed blessing at best. For dancers 
who prefer to gaze toward banks of TV screens rather than into their partners' 
eyes through an entire six-minute club mix, the trend may be a technological 
godsend. 
</P>
<P>
But there's probably less good video work done in the field of dance music than 
any other pop genre. On the afternoon cable show "Club MTV" (weekdays at 4) -- 
which has supplanted "American Bandstand" as the teen dance party of choice -- 
only snippets of the actual video clips are shown, as the cameramen concentrate 
on amazing low-angle studies of the bouncing female physique. It doesn't take a 
lecher to prefer the up-to-date gyrations of MTV's jailbait dancers over the 
dull videos themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem lies with a plethora of uninteresting dance-music artists, 
of course. There's a new light on the horizon, though: Nenah Cherry turns in a 
star-making performance in the wonderful "Buffalo Stance," which is propelling 
her fast-rising single -- easily one of the year's best -- quickly up the 
charts. 
</P>
<P>
That's one of the highlights in this month's danceable edition of Sound &amp; 
Vision, where current pop clips are rated on a 0-100 scale. Also featured is 
another of the year's best singles, Inner City's "Good Life" (which, like 
Cherry's debut, is available on 12-inch single and on the "Slaves of New York" 
sound-track album), plus interesting video work from Was (Not Was), Ice-T and 
Kool Moe Dee. As for dance deadbeats Sam Fox and Milli Vanilli, well, they're 
no match for "Club MTV's" bobbing body parts. 
</P>
<P>
CLIPS PICKED TO CLICK: 
</P>
<P>
Concrete Blonde's "God Is a Bullet." (Director: Jane Simpson.) "Muerte no!" 
reads a piece of graffiti at the close of this urgent diatribe against Los 
Angeles' senseless urban bloodshed. "It could have been your mother," wails 
singer Johnette Napolitano in this hard-rocking, pleading lament, but the point 
is forcefully made that this gunplay is a disease of the young, though the old 
occasionally get in the way. The "Peter Gunn"-like bass theme gives way to a 
sirenlike guitar riff, and unsensationalized shots of L.A.'s bullet-riddled 
barrios give way to Napolitano delivering a sad message in sign language, along 
with a few printed words on screen that act as a sort of video message in a 
bottle to the rest of the world from an outpost in L.A.: "Daughter . . . Shot . 
. . Killed . . . Sorry . . . Americans . . . One World . . . AFRAID." You said 
it, Johnette. 77 
</P>
<P>
Was (Not Was)'s "Anything Can Happen." (Director: Nigel Dick.) "She wasn't that 
great / But it was getting kind of late." What romantics these fellows are! 
Much is askew, as usual, in this seemingly pretty tale of happenstance love -- 
first, with a sullen, plain-Jane computer whiz, and later with a Marilyn Monroe 
look-alike who blows the singer a kiss from a passing sports car. A screwy 
tribute to random chance from rock's most melodic Dadaists. 72 
</P>
<P>
Nenah Cherry's "Buffalo Stance." (Director: John Maybury). "No money-man can 
win my love / It's sweetness that I'm dreaming of," sings Cherry, turning down 
a "gigolo" who may or may not be a garden-variety pimp. Nothing new there, but 
the pleasure of this tale is in the telling, and Britain's ripe-and-ready 
Cherry is an irresistible storyteller, rapping the verses with cocky defiance 
and singing the choruses with equally unruly loveliness. The fluorescent 
special effects surrounding her performance are unremarkable but sufficient; 
it's a decent video for an essential record. 71 
</P>
<P>
Inner City's "Good Life." (Director: Andrew Doucette.) No record this year will 
have a better groove (or mixture of grooves, really) than this one from Inner 
City, a Detroit band bringing to the commercial forefront the "techno-house 
sound" -- colder and more outrightly electronic on its surface, but with a 
typically booming bass underneath. The lyrics yearn plaintively for something 
better, which may seem a bit ironic when set against film clips from the 
much-derided "Slaves of New York," which isn't exactly about Manhattan's most 
down-and-out denizens. But the irony may not be unintentional. 67 
</P>
<P>
WORTH A LOOK &amp; A LISTEN: 
</P>
<P>
Christmas' "Stupid Kids." (Directors: Jonathan Dayton, Valerie Faris.) 
Everyone's favorite alternative rockers from Las Vegas apparently couldn't 
afford to do this clip the way they wanted -- so instead they sing into the 
camera while a long printed crawl rolls over the picture, explaining the Great 
Lost Concept (on an "8th grade reading level," no less). Highlights include: 
"Christmas are playing Madison Square Garden. . . . The ceiling of the 
auditorium unfolds like peeling paint and God's hand descends placing a 
30-foot-tall bust of Voltaire formed by thousands of trained slugs on the stage 
. . . " You get the picture. 62 
</P>
<P>
Ice-T's "High Rollers" (Director: Mitch Sinoway; Kool Moe Dee's "Road to the 
Riches" (director: Fab 5 Freddy). In the age of the amoral "reality" of N.W.A, 
some rappers are still coming out with an anti-drug line, though going out of 
their way not to "preach." Ice-T's video is the more vivid of these two 
cautionary tales, picturing the singer lounging in poolside luxury thanks to 
the illegal trade before rivals break in and gun him down in bed. Kool Moe Dee. 
starts his clip warning an adoring little boy not to follow in his "gangster" 
footsteps -- footsteps which, we soon see, have bought the character a 
well-furnished office with a "Scarface" poster behind the desk. Do these videos 
glorify or sensationalize as much as they scare kids off? The debate goes on. 
48 
</P>
<P>
GAMMA RAY ROT: 
</P>
<P>
Samantha Fox's "I Wanna Have Some Fun" and "I Only Wanna Be With You." 
(Directord: Scott Kalvert, Brian Grant, respectively.) Can't sing, can't act, 
isn't what you'd call drop-dead gorgeous, and -- on the basis of these clips -- 
certainly can't dance one-tenth as well as the kids on "Club MTV." A true pop 
star for the late '80s. 10 
</P>
<P>
Milli Vanilli's "Girl You Know It's True." With their hilariously hapless 
Terence Trent D'Arby wanna-be posing, these two almost make Sam Fox look like 
an artist. 7

L.A. BEAT: ROCK SEEKS A SLICE OF CITY FUNDING PIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mix of corporate money and rock has proved to be always controversial. 
</P>
<P>
But what about government money and rock? 
</P>
<P>
With the city of Los Angeles figuring out how to allocate its newly created 
$20-million arts endowment, that could soon become an issue as members of the 
local rock community are currently exploring ways in which rockers could access 
some of the funds. 
</P>
<P>
But Lee Ballinger, Long Beach-based associate editor of New York writer Dave 
Marsh's Rock 'n' Roll Confidential newsletter -- and an outspoken critic of the 
corporate-rock relationship -- sees no conflict in the pursuit of public grant 
money. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying that government money is totally a good thing, or that if 
funding became a big thing the government wouldn't try to control how it was 
used," he said. "But the marketplace ain't working very well in terms of 
ensuring a broad range of acts and venues. And where else can you go (besides 
the government)?" 
</P>
<P>
Len Fagan, who books the shows at the Hollywood club Coconut Teaszer, agreed 
that city funding would have more positive than negative results, even if in 
some ways it seems to go against a certain notion of what rock 'n' roll is 
"supposed" to be. 
</P>
<P>
"You're supposed to starve and live on peoples' couches," Fagan said. "But pay 
to play (the recently dominant system in L.A. clubs where bands have had to 
rent a facility) goes against the way rock's supposed to be because anyone who 
has a real band is too broke to pay to play. So I don't see what's wrong with 
taking grant money. A band like the Doors couldn't get off the ground the way 
things are today." 
</P>
<P>
Both Ballinger and Fagan, who led several meetings of the music community to 
field ideas and questions about funds allocations, as well as make local 
musicians aware of the impending funds, advocate that the money be used in ways 
that doesn't just support musicians, but brings their work into the community 
through in-school programs and community festivals. 
</P>
<P>
But according to Barbara Goldstein, project coordinator of the city's Cultural 
Arts Department, those programs already exist, and city money is already 
available to musicians with acceptable proposals. The difference with the new 
endowment, which she says will be allocated beginning in late summer, is that 
it is significantly larger than what is available now. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a lot more festivals to employ and expose local musicians, and a 
lot more opportunities for the city to fund people who play music," she said. 
</P>
<P>
TEEN-O-RAMA: A recent life-threatening bout with meningitis actually helped 
Dave Alvin get in the frame of mind to write songs for John Waters' upcoming 
'50s teen fantasy "Cry Baby." 
</P>
<P>
"I was in the hospital for 10 days with doctors coming in telling me I was 
lucky to be alive," Alvin, 32, said of the illness that struck him while he was 
touring with the Pleasure Barons, a large aggregation fronted by him, Mojo 
Nixon and the Beat Farmers' Country Dick Montana. "That cured me of feeling 
old." 
</P>
<P>
Alvin was tabbed to write three songs for the film, which he describes as "a 
fantasy movie about the birth of rock 'n' roll using every cliche from every 
'50s rock 'n' roll movie." Set in Waters' usual Baltimore locale, it stars 
Johnny Depp (with L.A. rockabilly figure James Intveld doing his singing) and 
features appearances by Iggy Pop, Traci Lords, Patty Hearst, Troy Donahue and 
David Nelson. So far, Waters, who set very strict standards for the sound and 
styles of the music, has accepted two Alvin compositions: "King Crybaby" 
(co-written with Doc Pomus, whose classics include "Teenager in Love" and "Save 
the Last Dance for Me") and "High School Hellcats." A third, "Teenage Rage" 
(being co-written with Intveld) is still in the works. 
</P>
<P>
For the former Blaster, the experience has been a jolt back to life, not just 
after his illness, but during a time of some career confusion, as he and Epic 
records have parted ways after one fine, but commercially ignored album, 
"Romeo's Escape." Lately Alvin has been torn trying to decide which of his 
musical interests to follow. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got songs for a rockabilly album, an acoustic folk album, a blues album 
and a rock album," he said. "If I put them together it'd be too weird, so I'm 
working in a bit of a vacuum right now. But this movie thing's been a lot of 
fun. I've gone back to listening to a lot of early rockabilly. After the war 
between rock and country (raised by Epic's marketing difficulties with the 
album), it's great to go back to where it all started." 
</P>
<P>
HOME ON THE RANGE: Remember Range War, the lauded country band fronted by 
former Fear leader Lee Ving? The band's been off the local club circuit since 
Ving had a motorcycle accident last year. 
</P>
<P>
Now, what Ving immodestly calls "the best damn country band around" is back in 
action, Ving and crew are currently in the studio putting together some songs 
for a combination demo/self-released record. And when that's done, Ving says he 
plans to "get a hillbilly bus and take the band around the country." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the gregarious Ving is continuing with his acting career. He's just 
started work on a horror movie called "Grave Secrets." 
</P>
<P>
"I play a nasty redneck named Zack," he said, laughing menacingly. "It'll be 
all too easy." 
</P>
<P>
METALLURGY: Miracle Workers is currently on a two-month European tour promoting 
its new German-released LP, "Primary Domain," and hopes to generate some 
Stateside label interest when it returns here in June. The quartet's album 
shows a brand of garage rock that has a deceptively dressed-down intensity that 
is not easily categorized, but it should help the band shake the Stooges-MC5 
label that has dogged it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The melodic rock 'n' pop group Tomorrow's Child has been signed by Arista. The 
deal has pretty much been a done deed for several weeks now, but ever since the 
label came up the loser in its battle with Geffen for Little Caesar, it has 
been keeping a low profile on its potential acts until the contracts have been 
signed. 
</P>
<P>
BUZZWORDS: Perhaps the most interesting of a slew of new local records is Dread 
Zepellin's debut on Birdcage Records. The band, which, as the name implies, 
specializes in reggae versions of Led Zep songs, has released a red vinyl 
single of "The Immigrant Song," backed with "Hey, Hey, What Can I Do," which 
was the flip side of the very first Zep single and never appeared on an album. 
The Dreads will be playing at Club Lingerie on My 20.. . . The Little Kings, a 
couple years ago one of the hottest items on the L.A. club scene, but quiet 
more recently, has released a debut album, "Head First," on the independent 
Epitaph label.

POP EYE: OLD RECORDS ARE NEW HITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL GREIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thanks, but no thanks. 
</P>
<P>
That's the reaction at most record companies to radio stations' current 
fascination with resurrecting old records. 
</P>
<P>
Four singles on Billboard magazine's current Hot 100 are old hits or near-hits 
that were revived by radio programmers -- Benny Mardones' 1980 hit "Into the 
Night," the Belle Stars' 1982 stiff "Iko Iko," Jimmy Harnen &amp; Synch's 1986 
flop "Where Are You Now?" and Real Life's 1985 hit "Send Me an Angel." 
</P>
<P>
These successes come on the heels of 1988 resurrections of UB40's "Red Red 
Wine" and Sheriff's "When I'm With You," both of which went to No. 1 on the 
national sales chart. 
</P>
<P>
You'd think that the record companies would be ecstatic that key radio stations 
saw potential in these long-forgotten singles and began playing them on their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
Guess again. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish it wouldn't happen, to be honest with you," said Mel Delatte, national 
singles director at Polydor Records, which was prompted to re-release Mardones' 
hit two weeks ago after stores reported demand for the record. 
</P>
<P>
One reason Delatte is unhappy is that Mardones isn't signed to Polydor anymore 
and his album has been out of print for years. In fact, label executives last 
week didn't know where to find Mardones -- though they'll have to track him 
down soon so they can start sending him royalty checks. 
</P>
<P>
"I would much rather spend time developing my new and upcoming acts," Delatte 
said. "And yet this week I have more adds on Benny than I have on any of the 
records that I'm really looking for." 
</P>
<P>
Delatte isn't alone in his frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"We should be looking forwards rather than backwards," said John Fagot, Capitol 
Records' vice president of promotion. "There are so many great artists out 
there who deserve exposure that it's kind of a waste of time to expose these 
old records. You don't have anything to build. There's no future in it." 
</P>
<P>
Fagot helped pilot the Sheriff single -- which had stalled at No. 61 when it 
was first released in 1983 -- to No. 1 in February. But there's no long-term 
payoff for his efforts: Sheriff broke up several years ago. Synch and the Belle 
Stars have also disbanded -- though Synch's lead singer, Jimmy Harnen, has 
signed with WTG Records as a solo artist. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's a way to break a band, then obviously it's fantastic," said Steve 
Meyer, senior vice president of MCA Records. "But if you're just getting a 
record played and there is no band, you could be taking away from the artists 
you're building futures with." 
</P>
<P>
Meyer noted that radio has different priorities. "They're interested in 
ratings, and if by playing a record they get the demographics they need for 
their market, then it works for them. But record companies are interested in 
building careers." 
</P>
<P>
Fagot predicted that this will be a short-lived fad, similar to the rashes of 
"Hooked On" and medley records in the early '80s. "As soon as you get two or 
three of these songs that don't happen, the trend will be over," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But, in the meantime, you can expect more old records to resurface. This week, 
WTG is re-releasing Peter Gabriel's 1986 hit, "In Your Eyes," which is featured 
in a key scene in the hit movie "Say Anything." 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden, because of the picture and where that particular song was 
placed, radio has picked up on it," said Jerry Greenberg, senior vice president 
of WTG. 
</P>
<P>
But Greenberg agreed that the boom will eventually go bust. "I think it's a 
little trend that people will fool around with for a little while and then 
everybody is going to get real serious about today's music and what the next 
phase will be."

AIRPLANE UPDATE: Marty Balin has rejoined the retooled Jefferson Airplane, 
which has signed with Epic Records. The lineup now includes all of the key 
players of the original Airplane, which shot to stardom in 1967 -- Balin, Grace 
Slick, Paul Kantner, bassist Jack Casady and guitarist Jorma Kaukonen. 
</P>
<P>
The group announced its plans to regroup two months ago, but Balin wasn't on 
board at that point. But he and his former band mates have since come to terms. 
The group is recording its first Epic album in a Los Angeles studio, sharing 
production chores with producer Ron Nevison. It's the first time that all of 
the Airplane principals have been in the studio together since 1972 when they 
cut "Long John Silver." 
</P>
<P>
Starship, which evolved in 1985 out of Jefferson Starship -- a spinoff of the 
original Airplane -- carries on, still signed to RCA. None of its members were 
around in the Airplane days. The longest-serving member is Craig Chaquico, who 
joined in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
There is talk of an Airplane tour to coincide with the expected release of the 
new album in August.

FLAMING CAKES AND DRUNKEN LOBSTERS; 
</P>
<P>
AT EL MOCAMBO THE FOOD IS A TROPICAL FANTASY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH REICHL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Mocambo, 8338 W. 3rd St., Los Angeles. (213) 651-2113. Open for lunch and 
dinner daily (Sunday brunch). Full bar. Valet parking. All major credit cards 
accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $35-$80. 
</P>
<P>
 The waiters gather around the table behind us. One of us groans. The waiters 
hitch up their ruffled sleeves and begin to sing: "Hap . . . py . . . Birth . . 
." they croon as the kitchen door opens and the cake, held high above our 
heads, soars toward the table in a blaze of flames. "How many candles are on 
that cake?" someone at our table wonders as the singing reaches a crescendo and 
the cake is plunked in front of the birthday boy. And just then we see -- there 
are no candles. The entire cake is on fire. 
</P>
<P>
El Mocambo would be a perfect place to celebrate a birthday. It's filled with 
all the innocent fantasy of a child's birthday party: Fake tropical trees, 
theatrical lighting, tables topped with ceramic leopards lounging next to 
wooden maracas (which shake salt and pepper all over the table when you pick 
them up). The waiters slink around in rumba costumes and the hostess wears an 
impossibly tight dress. Half the diners look as if they were on their way to a 
costume party, and by the time you've finished a Babaloo-loo-loo (three kinds 
of rum, pineapple, orange and cranberry juices) or a Desi Arnaz (a martini made 
with banana Schnapps) you'll probably feel as if the party's for you. 
</P>
<P>
So go ahead -- the drinks really are delicious. Avoid the Mangorita (fresh 
mango, Mohala liqueur, tequila, lemon and lime do not shake themselves into a 
wonderful frenzy), and opt for Guanatanamo Bay (three kinds of rum, Frangelico, 
pineapple, mango, lemon and lime juices) or the turquoise Blue Beguine (you 
probably don't want to know what's in it). If you're not feeling adventurous, 
there's always a Pina Colada. 
</P>
<P>
El Mocambo calls itself Cuban, but it is the Cuba of tourists in those days 
before the revolution brought the good times for foreigners skidding to a stop. 
The food here is a throwback, the sort of stuff that someone dreaming of life 
on a lazy tropical isle might conjure up. Many of these dishes seem rooted not 
in reality, but in some imaginary land. 
</P>
<P>
Does anybody in the real world actually eat langosta borracha -- a whole 
lobster, broiled in garlic and lemon, then flamed with Bacardi 151 rum? 
Probably not. But if you've been fantasizing about white sand and azure seas, 
this is the dish for you. It arrives on a huge blue platter decorated with 
banana leaves. The lobster in this case is perfectly cooked and though I 
wouldn't want every lobster to have to undergo this treatment, eaten here it 
tastes pretty good. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the other dishes on the menu have a similar fantasy quality. Do real 
Cubans sit down to corn chowder as rich and creamy as this one? Probably not, 
but we eat every drop. And they probably don't dip their croquettes (made of 
chicken, shrimp or vegetables) into a salsa concocted out of pineapples, onion 
and mint either . . . but they should. 
</P>
<P>
Appetizers are such perfect little tidbits that we end up eating them with our 
fingers. We dip fried slices of plantain into black bean sauce. We pick up 
babaloo boats -- chicken mousse wrapped up in plantains and cooked until crisp 
-- and top them with more of that fine pineapple salsa.The shrimp tamale isn't 
exactly finger food, but it is sweet and seductive -- a pillow of corn topped 
with a saute of shrimp and vegetables that has just the tiniest bit of bite. We 
eat it and order another. Bocaditos de pollo -- teensy tortillas topped with a 
tangle of tomato, chiles and chicken -- look like something Carmen Miranda 
should be wearing on her head. The presentation here is campy, the flavors so 
aggressively sweet and forward that the food tastes as colorful as it looks. 
</P>
<P>
It's no surprise to discover that the salads aren't wonderful. Salad, the 
dutiful food your mother thinks is good for you, has no business being here. 
Pescado del dia -- fish of the day -- probably falls into the same category. 
Today it is a soggy sea bass that tastes as if chef Toribio Prado (who was 
responsible for all that fabulous food at Cha Cha Cha) just doesn't have his 
heart in it. 
</P>
<P>
Try a shrimp dish instead. Ours comes out on one of those big blue platters, 
surrounded by more bright yellow rice than we really want to eat. Chino y 
Cubano -- tropical fried rice made with shrimp, crab, chicken and vegetables, 
then topped with bean sprouts -- is a sort of silly dish that fits right into 
the program. It certainly makes more sense than the paella, which takes itself 
very seriously -- at $25 it should -- but just isn't very good. 
</P>
<P>
The best dishes tend to be made with meat or chicken. A grilled breast of 
chicken is marinated in garlic, lime, rum and spices -- it's delicious. Pork is 
cooked with lemon, garlic and oregano and served in various cuts. Steak comes 
in many incarnations too: I'm particularly fond of the New York steak that is 
smothered in a tangy sauce of sauteed onions, tomatoes, garlic, black beans and 
lots of spices. The earthy flavor of cumin mingles with the bittersweet bite of 
tamarind to give this steak an exotic tinge. Served with fried yuca (the 
starchiest substance on earth), black beans and rice or crisply fried tostones 
(plantains), it is a dish that makes us feel like rich tourists on a binge. 
</P>
<P>
If you really want to go on a binge, have another drink for dessert. We're 
doing just that, having tried brazo gitano (literally "Gypsy's arm"), a 
jellyroll of a cake that is more sweet than anything else. We tasted the flan 
(not fabulous) and the rice pudding (decidedly forgettable) too. On the other 
hand, we just couldn't pass up that flaming tarte tatin. It might not be 
anybody's birthday, but we can pretend. Who knows how long it will be until we 
find another cake that comes down to the table in flames? 
</P>
<P>
 Recommended dishes: corn chowder, $5; shrimp tamale, $10; marinated breast of 
chicken, $10.50; N.Y. steak, $15; tarte tatin, $5.

NOTEBOOK: THE FIVE-DAY PASTA STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Westside restaurateur Bruce Marder must be worried that he'll wake up one day 
without enough to do. He's already the proprietor of three of Los Angeles' most 
popular restaurants -- West Beach Cafe, Rebecca's and DC 3 -- and is at work on 
a fourth place, the Broadway Deli, which he plans to open in December in Santa 
Monica (in collaboration with chef Michel Richard and restaurant investor 
Marvin Zeidler). Now Marder has come up with a concept for yet a fifth place. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be a very limited Italian family-style restaurant," he reveals, "open 
only for dinner and only from Wednesday through Sunday. The menu will be very 
small, and the wine list will probably just be red wine and white wine, 
period." Marder's new enterprise will be located at 17th Avenue and Speedway in 
Venice, in a space which has housed a number of restaurants over the years but 
is now unoccupied. 
</P>
<P>
Artist Chuck Arnoldi, who conceived the interior for DC 3, will design this 
restaurant, too, adds Marder. Stan Pratt and David Millen, head chefs at the 
West Beach Cafe and Rebecca's, respectively, will function as co-proprietors 
and consulting chefs at the place, while retaining their primary duties at the 
other restaurants. Venice real-estate investor Werner Scharff, who is Marder's 
partner in Rebecca's and the Broadway Deli and his landlord at the West Beach, 
is also a partner here. 
</P>
<P>
Marder adds that he hasn't decided on a name for his Italian venture, which he 
hopes to open by the middle of next year -- but jokes that maybe he should call 
it "Speedway, Ltd.", in honor of its address and its menu limitations. "But the 
name I really like," he adds, "is 'Five-Day Italian Restaurant'." 
</P>
<P>
BEVERLY HILLS UPDATE: The Beverly Restaurant and Market, which opened to much 
fanfare in 1987 with Lydia Shire as consulting chef, has closed its doors. 
Owner Bill Chait, also the proprietor of the Angel City Grill on Melrose and of 
three Louise's Trattorias in Santa Monica, West L.A. and the Larchmont area, 
plans to open a fourth Louise's on the site. . . . A branch of Hugh Carpenter's 
Chinese fast-food mini-chain, Chopstix, is the restaurant that will open in the 
spring of next year on the Beverly Hills glamour corner -- Beverly Drive and 
Little Santa Monica Blvd. -- where the La Scala Boutique now stands. The 
building, which today houses both the Boutique and its parent La Scala, is 
scheduled for demolition. Chopstix will go into the new low-rise building that 
will take its place. As noted previously in this column, La Scala itself will 
reopen at another Beverly Hills location. . . . And one of New York's major 
chain-restaurant franchise holders, Dennis R. Riese, has just purchased a 60% 
interest in the Ed Debevic's '50s-style diner chain -- including two Southern 
California units in Beverly Hills and Torrance. The 60% in question had 
belonged to Collins Foods International, Inc., operators of Kentucky Fried 
Chicken and Sizzler outlets all over the United States and Australia. The 
remaining Debevic's equity remains in the hands of Richard Melman's Lettuce 
Entertain You Enterprises, Inc. of Chicago and Big Four Restaurants, Inc. of 
Phoenix. . . . 
</P>
<P>
CHEF STORY: "Suddenly the owner's dream comes true," reads the press release. 
"After months of hard work the reservation sheet is fully booked every night. 
But, then the dream turns into nightmare -- i.e., the talented chef is lured 
away by a rich Los Angeles restaurateur. . . ." The release comes from Cafe 
Katsu of West Los Angeles, a tiny California/French restaurant owned by Katsu 
Michite, also proprietor of the top-rated Katsu sushi bar in the Los Feliz 
district. He is referring, of course, to the fact that his well-reviewed chef 
at Cafe Katsu, Joseph Miller, was hired away recently by restaurateur Bob Burns 
to cook at the high-budget Brentwood Bar &amp; Grill. The press release goes on 
to announce that, happily, a good new chef has been found -- Gary Messick, a 
veteran of the kitchens at L'Orangerie, the Four Seasons Hotel and Bistango. It 
concludes, "P.S. Rich restaurateurs please stay away!" 
</P>
<P>
TABLE SCRAPS: The tropical-themed Key West is scheduled to open this week in 
Santa Monica, just off the Third Street Promenade (as they're now calling the 
old Santa Monica Mall). The proprietor is Italian-born, Pacific 
Palisades-raised Nicole Focone, who also runs Buon Gusto on Santa Monica's Main 
Street. . . . Danny's Diner, featuring what is billed as "fresh-from-scratch 
food of the '50s" is new on Sunset at La Brea in Hollywood. . . . Claude 
Levayer is the new chef at Le Triumph in Mission Hills. That establishment's 
former chef, Robert Loison, has departed to open his own place in Peyson, 
Arizona. . . . 
</P>
<P>
WORTH NOTING: Spago hosts a cooking-and-wine class this Tuesday, May 9 at 11:30 
a.m. in conjunction with UCLA Extension. The restaurant's new chef, Serge 
Falesitch (he replaces Anne Gingrass, not Wolfgang Puck), will demonstrate a 
four-course meal -- which will then be served to participants. Spago maitre d' 
and wine buyer Bernard Erpicum will conduct a tasting of wines from Burgundy 
and from California's Kalin Cellers. Kalin winemaker Terry Leighton will also 
speak. The event is priced at $95 per person. Call Cecilia de Castro at (818) 
993-0752 for details. . . . UCLA's William Andrews Clark Memorial Library, in 
conjunction with the university's Center for 17th and 18th Century Studies, 
hosts a seminar on wine and food in the 18th Century, on May 20 from 9 a.m. to 
3 p.m. Participants will include Sacramento wine authority Darrell Corti, 
restaurateurs Michael Wild and Carol Brendlinger of the Bay Wolf in Oakland, 
and UC Santa Barbara professor of French Ronald W. Tobin (who will speak on 
gastronomy and malnutrition in Moliere's "The Miser"). An appropriately 
18th-Century-style lunch will be served. The extremely limited tickets are $75 
per person, $125 per couple. Call (213) 731-8529.

CARTOON MOONSHINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I recently took my young son to see the Walt Disney movie, "The Rescuers," and 
I was extremely disturbed by one aspect of it. 
</P>
<P>
A character in the film (whose name I believe is Barnaby) is very attached to 
his jug of moonshine. Barnaby repeatedly offers moonshine to characters who 
have become tired or despondent. Each time he exhorts, "It'll make a new man of 
ya!" or words to that effect. And each time the potion seems to have an 
energizing effect. 
</P>
<P>
Parents, schools, law enforcement, the government, children's television 
programmers and others are struggling to teach our young that drugs are not the 
answer to problems. I am at a loss for words to express my anger, 
disappointment and sorrow that a company such as Walt Disney Productions 
apparently is not sensitive to the importance that its messages and images can 
carry for young children.

CLEO'S RACE

<TEXT>
<P>
In reference to Bob Stanford's April 29 letter about the race of Cleopatra: She 
was black. 
</P>
<P>
Her father, Ptolemy XIII (Neus Dionysius), was black. He called himself "The 
New Osiris." (See "Sex &amp; Race," Vol. I, by J. A. Rodgers). You will see 
that the racial features of Ptolemy XIII are the same features as the Nubian 
pharaohs also pictured on the page. 
</P>
<P>
Also, if Bob Stanford didn't know, a lot of the ancient Greeks were Ethiopians 
or had Ethiopian blood (see "What They Never Told You in History Class," by 
Indus Khamit Kush).

I wish to protest the fiction, which the Los Angeles Times connives at, that

JAMES FLANIGAN: WORLD ECONOMY FEELS IMPACT OF PERESTROIKA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN

<TEXT>
<P>
Will Gorbachev survive, and does it matter anyway? In perestroika's latest 
episode, U.S. Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney said a week ago that Soviet 
leader Mikhail Gorbachev's attempts to reform his country's economy would lead 
to his downfall. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's comment was countered somewhat by President Bush, saying he told 
Gorbachev that we in America want perestroika to succeed and backing that 
sentiment with an OK for subsidies on grain sales to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
But more than American exports will be affected by Gorbachev's policies, which 
bring the challenge of change to the United States as well as to the Soviet 
Union. The promise of lowered East-West tensions is already producing second 
thoughts about NATO missiles in West Germany. And no doubt it is also 
contributing to the prospect of long-term shrinkage in the U.S. defense 
industry -- a $300-billion-a-year mainstay of the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, in short, makes a difference. In speculating on his possible 
downfall, Cheney wasn't arguing for higher defense spending but cautioning 
against a hasty withdrawal of U.S. troops from Europe lest today's sweet talk 
is replaced by tomorrow's growl. 
</P>
<P>
Opening up closed economies is difficult and perilous. The exhilaration of free 
markets is soon replaced by confusion and rage at rising prices. What people 
don't realize is that inflation has always been there but evident in shortages 
rather than high prices. 
</P>
<P>
"There are two kinds of inflation," an official of East Germany's government 
once explained succinctly, "the kind in which I cannot buy because the price is 
too high and the kind in which I cannot buy because the products are not 
there." Perestroika, literally restructuring, means awakening from illusion. 
But that doesn't make it less painful. 
</P>
<P>
Next will come unemployment, as state-owned railroads and airlines, factories 
and offices try to lay off surplus staff and become efficient. Still, with all 
the difficulties, voters in Moscow (and students in Beijing) are calling for 
further change -- having tasted economic freedom, they want political 
self-determination. Ultimately, what is going on in the reforming Communist 
world will present profound challenges to U.S. foreign and economic policies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weakening Hold on Asia 
</P>
<P>
"Within 25 years, if not sooner, the Russian empire will have disappeared," 
says Peter F. Drucker. "In fact, the more Gorbachev's perestroika succeeds in 
reviving a decaying Russian economy, the faster will the Russian empire 
unravel." 
</P>
<P>
Drucker is best known as an authority on business management, but he is more an 
historian of economics and culture. At 79, he is publishing his 25th book this 
month, "The New Realities," a collection of essays based on lectures he gave 
last fall at the Claremont Graduate School about the implications of the 
information age. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the book's arresting essays, Drucker writes not only of the Soviet 
Union's changing relationship with Eastern Europe but the weakening hold of the 
European Russian leadership over vast stretches of Asia, as the Russian half of 
the Soviet population grows at one-third the rate of the country's Central 
Asian peoples. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union is not a melting pot society; the ruling Russians don't even 
equip Asian soldiers with live ammunition. One reason Gorbachev offered to 
reduce Soviet troop strength by 500,000, says Drucker, is that lacking Russian 
youths to fill the ranks, he would have to recruit and arm Asians. 
</P>
<P>
So Russia is changing in more ways than one. Which means, writes Drucker, that 
the United States has to rethink 44 years of foreign and economic policies that 
centered on the Soviet Union. Protecting countries from Soviet power is 
difficult, after all, when they no longer think that they need protection. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany is already turning eastward toward the vast and underdeveloped 
Soviet market. The Soviet Union has a gross national product of about $2.2 
trillion, comparable to that of Japan and double that of West Germany. But 286 
million Soviet citizens have a standard of living -- GNP per person -- that is 
less than half that of Japan or Germany. Germany's second thoughts about NATO 
are related, of course, to its ambitions for trade and ties with the East. 
</P>
<P>
In Asia, too, things are changing. Japan wants to build its own fighter plane, 
the FSX. Does the United States support this reach for independence or demand 
continued dependence? 
</P>
<P>
Of course, all these developments are positive. They mean that the American 
postwar policy of fostering economic recovery in Europe and Japan has 
succeeded. There's a lot of truth in President Bush's remarks last week that 
"the United States should hope that economic reform succeeds everywhere in the 
world. With its emphasis on incentives and market economics, economic reform 
leads to more freedom." 
</P>
<P>
What does it all mean? Militarily, America won the war; philosophically, it has 
won the postwar. Now it is challenged to come up with an encore.

LOWER PRICES ON WOMEN'S CLOTHES ARE NOW IN STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
When women balked at paying $350 and up for suits, New York clothing maker 
Harve Benard took a drastic measure. It slashed what it charged retailers and 
encouraged stores to price this fall's suits at a more affordable $190 to $239. 
</P>
<P>
Designers at Liz Claiborne Inc., the huge maker of moderately priced 
sportswear, devised a machine-knit sweater for fall that is almost identical to 
and half the price of earlier hand-knit models priced at $150. 
</P>
<P>
And no less a fashion eminence than Donna Karan, whose devotees pay thousands 
of dollars for items in her couture collection, recently launched her casual 
DKNY line. Among the offerings is a three-pack of T-shirts for $85, which, in 
her world at least, is peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
Thus are some savvy clothing companies hoping to pry open the wallets of 
customers who for months have balked at paying escalating prices for women's 
fashions that they viewed as shoddy, mundane or inappropriate, notably the 
miniskirt. 
</P>
<P>
With 20 months of sluggish sales under their belts -- the longest drought that 
many in the business can recall -- a number of apparel companies and department 
and specialty stores appear to have sized up some of the problems that caused 
business to dry up in fall, 1987. For much of the slump, clothing designers 
have shifted from one hapless style to another and left high and dry those 
customers in search of fresh, high-quality fashions that didn't take them to 
the cleaners. 
</P>
<P>
But at long last, observers say, parts of the tattered women's fashion business 
are on the mend, thanks to snappier styles and more realistic pricing. Some of 
the emphasis on keeping prices in line is akin to the "everyday low price" push 
going on in general merchandise and discount chains such as Sears, Montgomery 
Ward, Target and Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, in some rare cases during this fashion slowdown, companies 
have succeeded by moving upscale. But they, too, have converged on a void in 
the business where price and styling were mismatched. 
</P>
<P>
Few companies escaped the downturn unscathed. The Gap and the Limited -- the 
merchant-manufacturers that for years were the ones competitors copied -- led 
the plunge. Even Liz Claiborne, which beat the socks off rivals by successfully 
appealing to 30-ish career women, showed an 11% profit drop for 1988. But all 
three are now winning kudos for strong turnarounds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prices a Sore Point 
</P>
<P>
One prominent New York retail analyst, stopping short of calling recent sales 
gains a robust comeback because they follow weak figures last year, noted that 
clothing makers and merchants at least do not seem to be repeating the mistakes 
of last year. 
</P>
<P>
"They've just stopped hitting themselves over the head with a hammer," said 
Joseph H. Ellis of the Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
The high price of keeping up with the fashionable Joneses has been a sore point 
with women for years, although they went along when the styles were well 
defined and compelling. Baby boomers in the 1960s and 1970s bounced from minis 
to maxis or from bell bottoms to cigarette-leg jeans, often replacing entire 
wardrobes to keep up with the fashion vagaries. 
</P>
<P>
Once these women entered the work force, building a wardrobe became the object. 
And when design mavens went astray and started foisting off youthful or 
uninteresting styles on these women at outlandish prices, customers simply laid 
off spending. 
</P>
<P>
"Prices are ludicrous," said Walter K. Levy, a New York retail consultant. 
"When you look at a blouse for $200 and men can buy a suit for $250, there's 
something wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Even cartoonist Cathy Guisewite -- whose alter ego Cathy typifies the 
high-strung, consumption-minded 1980s yuppie -- has poked fun at the clothing 
industry and the cost of staying chic. 
</P>
<P>
In the view of some manufacturers, part of the problem was that stores inflated 
their markups to help subsidize markdowns. Customers caught on and increasingly 
waited for items to hit the sales racks. (Stores, in turn, point to ever rising 
wholesale prices as the cause.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trying to Stimulate Business 
</P>
<P>
Harve Benard saw an opportunity in bringing the initial price down to a level 
that stores and customers could live with. 
</P>
<P>
"With everything going up in price, we're going the other way," said Robert H. 
Cohen, a vice president at Harve Benard. "It's a way to shake up the market." 
</P>
<P>
By cutting the wholesale prices of its career suits, the company plans "to 
stimulate a constant day-in-and-day-out business," he said. Rather than buying 
just one suit, he reasoned, young customers will be able to afford three or 
four. Styling, fabric and quality, he said, will stay the same. 
</P>
<P>
To accomplish the reductions, Harve Benard has cut special deals with fabric 
suppliers and garment factories in return for guaranteeing increased volume. 
And the company is actually slicing its own profit margins. By making less on 
each suit but selling lots more of them, the company figures, it will reap 
bigger sales and profits. 
</P>
<P>
So far, store buyers have reacted enthusiastically, Cohen said, but the acid 
test with customers will come when the fall suits hit the stores in June and 
July. The goal is for suits to account for 60% of the company's wholesale 
business, up from 35%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Instant Success 
</P>
<P>
Designer Karan, known for pricey garments, also saw a void in the more moderate 
arena. When she couldn't find any jeans to fit her, she made her own. 
</P>
<P>
"Donna had a lot of clothes that she'd like to wear, but she couldn't really 
design those in her collection line," said Denise Seegal, president of DKNY. 
"They didn't fit into the price points or attitudes." So was born a casual line 
featuring $85 jeans, $95 poplin shirts, $350 jackets and $195 khaki silk wrap 
skirts. 
</P>
<P>
On a Sunday morning in February, 380 customers showed up at the Bullock's 
department store in the Beverly Center to get first crack at DKNY. "We were 
packed," said Cheryl Fox, a Bullock's spokeswoman. "They went wild over her 
merchandise." 
</P>
<P>
Even if DKNY prices are steep by most American women's standards, the line's 
instant success seemed to demonstrate pent-up demand for the right fashions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Giving More Value 
</P>
<P>
At Liz Claiborne, the sobering downturn made officials more sensitive to price 
and styling. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to give consumers as much value as we can," said Vice Chairman 
Jerome A. Chazen. "We're sharpening our pencil wherever we have to. Maybe we'll 
make a little bit less money on individual things." 
</P>
<P>
The company made some wise early commitments for fabrics such as wool and silk 
that are cushioning it from recent drastic upswings in price. And savings such 
as those on the machine-made sweaters that look hand-knit are helping to hold 
Claiborne's fall prices overall to last year's level, and, Chazen reports, "The 
stores love it." 
</P>
<P>
As a sign that many women are indeed resistant to rising prices, Chazen noted 
that more Claiborne customers are buying cardigans rather than blazers to 
complete their outfits. The cardigans generally cost about half what a jacket 
would. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's always going to be a small segment that's going to want the 
kind of clothing that makes them talked about," Chazen said. "But most women, 
especially at today's prices, are being much more practical in terms of 
wardrobe needs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Push Upscale 
</P>
<P>
If Harve Benard, Karan and Claiborne moved down or held the line on prices, 
other companies have successfully gone upscale. 
</P>
<P>
Allen B. Schwartz, chairman of Los Angeles-based A.B.S. Clothing Collection, 
recently switched out of the shrinking, trendy contemporary market into the 
bridge business with what he describes as "casual career" clothes. The designs 
are geared to women who want fashion classics with an updated twist without 
paying couture prices. 
</P>
<P>
Each week, the company brings out a group of 12 to 18 new pieces, compared to 
many companies that bring out only four or five groupings a year. Many are 
featured at the company's sole retail outlet in Santa Monica. Even on weekdays, 
the shop bustles. For spring, the store's most expensive item is a silk blazer 
that feels almost like suede and costs $302. 
</P>
<P>
Emily Draper, a free-lance costume designer from Westwood who was shopping at 
A.B.S. recently, said she tends to shop at specialty boutiques offering more 
unusual, and often more expensive, clothing. "The prices are not the problem," 
she said. "A lot of the stuff in the department stores is just ugly." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quality Fits Price 
</P>
<P>
What A.B.S. is to successful women in their 30s, 40s and 50s, the Limited's 
Express division is to younger women. 
</P>
<P>
When the chain started six years ago as Limited Express, it carried hot junior 
fashions in small stores decorated with bright lights and white tile. Today, 
the chain -- renamed Express Compagnie Internationale -- is appealing to an 
older crowd with prototype superstores featuring wood floors, sleek props, more 
sophisticated clothes -- and higher prices. The Euro-chic setting comes 
complete with piped-in sound track that sounds like a French radio station. The 
reformulation is going over well with customers. 
</P>
<P>
"We've changed the quality to fit the price," said Pete Grimes, executive vice 
president of operations for Express. "You can't take a garment that last year 
you were selling for $20 and this year decide to sell it for $28 and not change 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The success of Express has been in spotting fashion trends early and putting 
its massive clothing manufacturing facilities firmly behind them. A few years 
ago, when neon-colored styles were featured in tiny areas of department stores, 
Express "made an entire store of it," Grimes said. "We were not afraid to make 
a fashion stance." 
</P>
<P>
But when some of the successful young looks at Express went out of vogue 
seemingly overnight in late 1987, the chain suffered. Now it appears to be 
safely back on track, but it's appealing to an older customer. "Where our 
target customer used to be 21, it's now 28," Grimes said. 
</P>
<P>
Bargain hunters, note: The $48 tapestry vest at Express could pass in a pinch 
for the $136 model at A.B.S., and both have fraying button holes. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the renewed optimism of companies such as the Limited, Harve Benard and 
Claiborne, clothing makers acknowledge that the industry is not yet out of the 
woods. John Pomerantz, chairman of Leslie Fay Cos., a huge maker of suits and 
dresses, told shareholders at the company's annual meeting that "1989 is 
shaping up as a puzzling year in retail, with some categories of merchandise 
shining and others being slow to develop." 
</P>
<P>
As quoted in Women's Wear Daily, a trade publication, he offered a clumsy 
metaphor: "There's no consistency. Blouses may have a good week, then it will 
be sweaters or some other category. It's hard to put a candle up to know what's 
hot at any given time."

REAGAN ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS FIND THE PATH TO PRIVATE JOBS IS PAVED WITH 
GOLD

<P>
At the Pentagon, he presided over what critics say is a bloated, badly managed, 
occasionally corrupt bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
But when former Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci walked away Jan. 20 from 30 
years of government service, he was transformed into a darling of the corporate 
world. 
</P>
<P>
In a matter of weeks, he accepted posts on the boards of directors of nine 
corporations -- four of them major defense contractors. Between them, he easily 
will earn in excess of $150,000 a year -- considerably more than the $99,500 he 
was paid to be second in command of the nation's defense. And that doesn't even 
count the income, in an amount undisclosed, from his full-time job as vice 
chairman of a Washington investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
But Carlucci was only the most aggressive of Ronald Reagan's Cabinet members in 
striding into the corporate power elite. And the Reagan Cabinet is only the 
latest to participate in a long -- if not universally regarded as honorable -- 
tradition in which top officials convert their government experience into 
earnings and influence in the corridors of corporate power. 
</P>
<P>
At best, critics of Washington's "revolving door" say, the flow of officials 
from the highest reaches of national government to corporate board rooms -- 
and, sometimes, back again -- creates an appearance that government is at the 
beck and call of big business. At worst, they say it fuels public suspicion 
that national policy and spending is compromised by top government executives' 
ties to private industry. 
</P>
<P>
And at a minimum, some analysts find it unseemly for Cabinet members to appear 
to be cashing in on their public service by lending their star value, and maybe 
the secrets in their Rolodexes, to industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever they say," said Thomas L. Whisler, a University of Chicago business 
professor who has studied corporate boards, "my suspicion is what (companies) 
are getting is just a gorgeous bunch of information about who's doing what, who 
to see and who to call." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 Reagan Cabinet members who left office with the President, five have 
accepted appointments to corporate boards: Secretary of State George P. Shultz, 
Secretary of Labor Ann Dore McLaughlin, Secretary of Housing and Urban 
Development Samuel R. Pierce, Secretary of Commerce C. William Verity and 
Carlucci. 
</P>
<P>
Such service is not illegal. Federal ethics laws put limits on the contact 
senior government officials can have with the agencies they served, including a 
range of prohibitions on sales and lobbying. But they do not restrict 
officials' post-government employment or their service on corporate boards. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean that the conduct of former top government officials is free 
from controversy, however. 
</P>
<P>
Former senator and arms negotiator John Tower lost his bid to become Carlucci's 
successor in part because of questions about his work as a defense industry 
consultant after leaving the government. Former President Gerald Ford has faced 
stiff criticism from ethics experts and historians for going on more than a 
dozen boards and accepting consulting fees from yet more companies after his 
exit from the Oval Office -- a merchandising program that made him a 
millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan Cabinet has not faded into the board room's oak-paneled woodwork 
quietly, either. 
</P>
<P>
When Chevron shareholders met Tuesday in New Orleans, right-wing political 
organizer Howard Phillips, chairman of the Conservative Caucus, had hoped for a 
face-to-face confrontation with Shultz, who recently joined the oil company's 
board. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips and some other conservatives strongly opposed Reagan Administration 
policy toward Angola, charging that the United States was not fierce enough in 
its support of the non-communist rebels who are fighting to topple the Marxist 
regime in Luanda. As they saw it, Shultz and Reagan's policy was tilted toward 
protecting Chevron's extensive oil-drilling holdings in Angola -- holdings that 
generate the taxes and fees that prop up a pro-Soviet regime. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips did not get to challenge Shultz, who missed last week's meeting. And 
shareholders overwhelmingly rejected his resolution calling for Chevron to pull 
out of Angola. But Phillips insists, nonetheless, that the former secretary of 
state's election to Chevron's board caps years of devoted service to the 
company's interests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wants Pull-Out 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, Chevron has multibillion-dollar interests in Angola," said Phillips. 
"Clearly it is outrageous that the clear interests of the United States have 
been subordinated to the interpretation that what's good for Chevron is good 
for the U.S.A." 
</P>
<P>
Shultz, a professor of international economics at Stanford University, could 
not be reached for comment. Sherri Zippay, spokeswoman for the San 
Francisco-based company, called the allegations "totally absurd and ridiculous" 
and "an insult to the people involved." 
</P>
<P>
Carlucci's board service with four large defense contractors -- Westinghouse 
Electric, Kaman Corp. and Ashland Oil, all among the Pentagon's 100 top 
contractors, as well as Santa Monica's RAND Corp. -- crystallizes, for Pentagon 
critics and ethicists, dilemmas that pervade the Defense Department's 
relationships with its contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Congress for years has tried to devise a way to guard Pentagon procurement 
against the conflicts, and appearances of conflict, that arise when personnel 
drift back and forth between jobs in the defense industry and the Defense 
Department. At the same time, legislators have not wanted to deny individuals a 
livelihood in their field of expertise, nor deny the nation the talents of some 
of its finest defense experts. 
</P>
<P>
"In an earlier time, those who passed through the 'revolving door' were known 
and praised as citizen-statesmen," Washington attorney Lloyd N. Cutler, a 
member of President George Bush's Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform, 
testified at a congressional hearing last year on revolving door issues. 
</P>
<P>
The result of the balancing act has been a prodigious assortment of ethical 
rules and laws that limit defense workers' employment options, the job searches 
they can conduct while still in public office and the work they can do for 
defense contractors. 
</P>
<P>
None of the rules prohibit a former defense secretary from joining a defense 
contractor's board. But Carlucci's recent predecessors -- Donald H. Rumsfeld, 
Harold Brown and Caspar W. Weinberger -- all have steered clear of such posts. 
(Both Rumsfeld and Brown, though, are $3,000-per-year directors of RAND, a 
nonprofit think-tank that gets about 75% of its funding from the armed 
services.) 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, I would not think it appropriate to serve on the board of a company 
that had extensive contractual relationships with the department, particularly 
not if they had those relationships while I was in office," Weinberger said in 
a written response to questions from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Full Disclosure' 
</P>
<P>
"I do not have in mind any particular rule change which would prohibit a former 
Secretary of Defense from serving as an executive or director of a defense 
contractor," he said. "I do not think it should be done, but I prefer to rely 
on full disclosure and the good judgment of the individuals concerned to avoid 
any appearance of, or any substantive, problems." 
</P>
<P>
Carlucci, a 58-year-old career civil servant who started as a foreign service 
officer and rose up to No. 2 posts at the Central Intelligence Agency and the 
Pentagon before becoming defense secretary in 1987, sees things differently. 
</P>
<P>
"Cap is entitled to his own preferences" Carlucci said of Weinberger, his boss 
in the early '70s at the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and later 
at the Defense Department. 
</P>
<P>
Carlucci turned down board posts at what he called "well-known" defense 
contractors to rule out, he said, any appearance of impropriety. The defense 
contractors he serves all are highly diversified, with extensive civilian 
operations as well, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
All the same, "I did not feel constrained to say 'no' because somebody 
contracts with the Department of Defense," Carlucci said. "Are we removing all 
elements of integrity and trust from government service? You can take that 
appearance-of-conflict-of-interest standard so far and say the only thing you 
can do when you come out is serve in a monastery or Sears Roebuck." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Sears was the company for which Carlucci worked during the one short 
period a few years ago when he left government, heading the retailer's 
international trading company. Without greater experience in private industry, 
he said, board service seemed one of his few opportunities to earn the money he 
needs to support his family. 
</P>
<P>
He won't be able to send his young daughter to college, Carlucci said, on a 
$40,000 annual federal pension. 
</P>
<P>
"At age 58 or 59, you don't start into medical school," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The contractors that elected Carlucci to their boards say he was selected for 
his breadth of knowledge and experience, not his insider perspective on the 
federal pocketbook. 
</P>
<P>
John C. Marous, chairman and chief executive of Westinghouse Electric, the 
nation's 18th-largest defense contractor, said "Carlucci's background matches 
our goals: He is rich in experience, has a great international background and 
understands and embraces quality." 
</P>
<P>
Roger Schrum, spokesman for Ashland Oil, the 75th-largest military contractor, 
candidly noted one more quality Carlucci contributes: "Quite frankly, he adds a 
lot of prestige to our board." 
</P>
<P>
Critics of Carlucci's conduct ask whether the public is paying too large a 
price for whatever advantages the former defense secretary and the companies he 
serves are garnering from the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Danielle Brian-Bland, an analyst at the Project on Military Procurement, a 
Washington organization that casts a skeptical eye on defense spending, said a 
former defense secretary could provide contractors with just the kind of inside 
knowledge that the government's Operation Ill Wind prosecutions have sought to 
protect. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming out of government, you can give these companies advice about ways to 
tailor their proposals," she said. "If they have inside information, even if 
it's aboveboard, that still can give these companies an unfair advantage." 
</P>
<P>
Retired admiral Eugene Carroll, deputy director of the Center for Defense 
Information, another Washington defense watchdog group, said it seemed apparent 
that it was Carlucci's Pentagon service that made him an attractive board 
candidate for defense contractors. 
</P>
<P>
"You invite the man who was in charge of the henhouse to join you in figuring 
out how to get more eggs out of the chickens," Carroll said. "He can sure give 
them some good phone numbers. I'm sure he took his Rolodex with him. And I'm 
sure if the call is from Frank Carlucci, it will get returned." 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing in Washington in March, Rep. Charles E. Bennett (D-Fla.), one of 
the authors of the most recent congressional stab at regulating defense 
officials' post-government employment, said Carlucci's directorships were proof 
current laws were inadequate and poorly enforced. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett has proposed legislation that simply would bar Pentagon officials from 
working in the defense industry for two years after leaving the government. The 
Bush Administration, meantime, wants tighter restrictions on how former 
officials can use the information they acquired on the inside. 
</P>
<P>
Carlucci says the critics misconstrue the role board members play. 
</P>
<P>
Only once has he been asked a question about the Pentagon at a board meeting. 
"I was asked, 'What do I think is going to happen with the defense budget?' And 
that is pure conjecture," Carlucci said. "I was never asked to give any kind of 
information about defense. That's not what boards do. Boards are at a level of 
oversight that does not get into that kind of detail." 
</P>
<P>
Some ethics specialists say it is not at all clear what standard should 
regulate the revolving door. 
</P>
<P>
If Carlucci -- whose reputation for rectitude is unblemished -- or some other 
former Cabinet member takes care not to give inside knowledge to a company he 
serves as a director, is it fair, they ask, to conjure up scenarios that 
suggest an appearance of a conflict of interest? And is it reasonable, some 
ethicists wonder, to bar those who have held high government positions from 
bringing their experience to bear on the challenges facing American business? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Carry Our Resumes' 
</P>
<P>
"We all carry with us our resumes," said Michael Josephson, president and 
founder of the Joseph and Edna Josephson Institute for the Advancement of 
Ethics, in Culver City. "It is certainly clear we want to be careful how people 
use that when part of that resume was built up by, or in some senses paid for, 
by the public. On the other hand, you can't take it away from the person." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, former government officials can choose on their own to keep their 
business affiliations to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
That's the path former President Reagan has taken. The only board on which he 
intends to serve is that of the National Review, the conservative political 
magazine edited by his friend William F. Buckley Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Wick Allison, publisher of the magazine, says board members are called upon 
regularly to offer advice on editorial policy and ways the publication can 
increase its influence in the conservative community. 
</P>
<P>
The fee collected by Reagan and the other directors? Not one red cent.

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / MURRAY WEIDENBAUM: GLOBAL ECONOMY AND GOVERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MURRAY WEIDENBAUM, MURRAY WEIDENBAUM is director of the Center for the Study 
of American Business at Washington University in St. Louis. This academic year, 
he is on leave to serve as distinguished scholar at the Center for Strategic 
and International Studies in Washington. He is the author of Rendezvous With 
Reality: The American Economy After Reagan. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a growing tension between the increasingly global nature of modern 
economic life and the far more restricted territorial orientation of government 
decision-makers. The global village envisioned by the writer Marshall McLuhan 
may not yet be here, but the global enterprise surely is. 
</P>
<P>
Already, about one-half of all U.S. imports and exports are transactions 
between U.S. firms and their foreign affiliates or parents. What from the 
viewpoint of public policy is an international economic transaction turns out 
to be so often just an internal transfer within an individual business firm. 
Thus, the traditional geopolitical map and the dynamic techno-economic map are 
out of sync. Government policy still responds in a very static way to the 
desires of voters who live in a given city or state or country. 
</P>
<P>
The global enterprise is not merely a high-blown phrase. Unisys is a good 
example of this development. Half of its sales are overseas, covering more than 
100 advanced and developing nations. The company uses components produced in 
virtually every continent, and its financing is worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
The company is simultaneously a customer of -- and a supplier to -- Fujitsu, 
Hitachi, IBM, Honeywell, Phillips and Siemens. Together these companies 
(headquartered in five different nations on three continents) engage in joint 
ventures, serve as sources for each other, share output and compete. 
</P>
<P>
Unisys is not unique. Corning Glass gets more than half of its profit from 
joint ventures. Two-thirds of the ventures are with foreign companies, such as 
Samsung in South Korea, Ciba Geigy in Switzerland and Asahi Glass in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Here is an interesting turnabout: In 1986, Texas Instruments sued Hitachi for 
patent infringement. Today, the two companies are jointly developing the next 
generation of memory chips. One more example of the new global economy: Ford 
and Volkswagen -- tough competitors in our domestic market -- merged their 
operations in Brazil and Argentina a few years ago to form Autolatina. 
</P>
<P>
But the political debates -- in any country -- seem to be taking place in a 
different, perhaps earlier world. Ironically, 19th Century-style protectionist 
concerns are rising as we prepare for the 21st Century. Some business and labor 
leaders are pushing hard to limit imports into the United States. It seems that 
competition is always nicer to contemplate in the abstract. The battles over 
international air landing rights always ignore the needs of the consumer -- the 
passenger. 
</P>
<P>
Other "defenders" of the private enterprise system want to restrict exports, 
especially items containing new technology. Still others worry about all the 
foreign investment coming into the United States (although they get even more 
upset if the foreign funds are invested in some other country, making their 
industries more competitive). This new wave of protectionist sentiment is 
reminiscent of the plaintive plea of that mythical business executive who 
yelled, "Stop the world, I want to get off." 
</P>
<P>
Some historical perspective is useful. The rise of Japan and the other Pacific 
rim countries as global economic powers in recent years has a parallel in the 
changing role of the United States in the middle of the 19th Century. At first, 
the major European countries dominated world trade. However, their citizens 
invested heavily in our railroads, canals and heavy industry. 
</P>
<P>
The result was the birth of a new economic giant in North America that broke 
for all time the historic European monopoly in world trade. Fortunately for all 
concerned, the Europeans did not try to prevent this change, although never 
again have they dominated international commerce. The United States joined the 
club of advanced economies. In the years that followed, the trade -- and output 
and living standard -- of each nation rose. The benefits of competition were 
impressive. 
</P>
<P>
A similar process is at work today. Japan followed by South Korea, Taiwan, Hong 
Kong and Singapore are gaining important positions in many product lines. The 
United States is unlikely ever again to be No. 1 across the spectrum of world 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
However, if we do not try to prevent the current round of change, the odds are 
that we, too, will enjoy rising absolute amounts of production, trade and 
investment in a growing world economy. The alternative is to try to maintain a 
constant share of what would be a diminishing world economic "pie." 
</P>
<P>
It is always difficult, however, to adopt new ways of thinking. On reflection, 
it is natural -- perhaps inevitable -- that political officials reflect the 
views and concerns of their constituents. Thus, we can expect government to 
take parochial "territorial" stands on matters of international commerce as 
long as the voters they represent continue to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the challenge facing us in truly a task of economic education, to help 
citizens/voters/taxpayers understand the increasingly global nature of economic 
life. True, it is easier to see the impact of foreign money in the United 
States than it is to visualize the role of American investment in other 
nations. Yet the effects flow in both directions. 
</P>
<P>
Less than a quarter of a century ago, the citizens of France and other Western 
European nations were complaining about making the world one big Coca-Cola 
franchise. The "American challenge" was a popular topic for public debates. Our 
reply was that U.S. investment benefited them by creating employment, income 
and tax collections in their countries. That was true then and it is true now. 
But the shoe is now on the other foot. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the results are very similar. Foreign investment is creating jobs 
and income and tax revenue in this country. With the financing of our outsized 
budget deficits draining off so much of our domestic savings, that foreign 
money is a key factor in the continued prosperity of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In this light, it is fascinating to contrast the economic with the political 
views of many Americans. Often the very same people who urge their legislators 
to take "tough" restrictionist positions on issues of foreign trade and 
investment act very differently as consumers. 
</P>
<P>
In spending their own money, they buy items from anywhere in the world, caring 
more about quality and price than country of origin. They go to movies made in 
a great variety of countries and they watch television performers from every 
part of the globe. Without thinking about it too deeply, most consumers are 
adapting to an increasingly global economy. The sooner local, state and 
national politicians understand that, the brighter will be our prospects for 
the future.

BIG-NAME STAFF AT ISSUE IN LINCOLN S&amp;L FUROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was November, 1985, and Charlie Keating was perturbed. 
</P>
<P>
His company had bought Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine less than two years 
earlier, and federal regulators were trying to curtail his use of new state and 
federal laws that gave him wide discretion to invest S&amp;L funds -- mainly 
customer deposits -- in an array of ventures. 
</P>
<P>
It was then that Keating offered a high-paying job to Edwin J. Gray, the 
nation's top S&amp;L regulator at the time. Gray turned the job down flat. A 
year later, he characterized it as a brazen attempt to "buy me out." 
</P>
<P>
Others were not so quick to reject Keating's overtures. Since purchasing 
Lincoln in 1984, the Phoenix financier has hired or retained at least half a 
dozen former state and federal government officials, including the head of a 
regulatory team that was examining the thrift. Five years ago, he even retained 
prominent economist Alan Greenspan, former head of the President's Council of 
Economic Advisers who is now chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. 
</P>
<P>
Those hirings have become a major issue in the controversy surrounding Charles 
H. Keating Jr., chairman of American Continental Corp. On April 13, the Phoenix 
holding company filed for protection from creditors in federal bankruptcy 
court. The next day, Lincoln was seized by regulators, who claimed that the 
thrift was engaging in unsafe and unsound business practices. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Unique' 
</P>
<P>
Critics claim that Keating has used his political connections and financial 
resources to buy influence in government circles. By contributing hundreds of 
thousands of dollars to elected officials and by hiring former state and 
federal agency officials to represent him, the critics allege, Keating kept 
regulators at bay while he mismanaged Lincoln's assets for his own benefit. 
</P>
<P>
While the migration of government workers to positions in private industry is 
not unique to American Continental, "I'm seeing this pattern in a very great 
extreme with Lincoln," said Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va., industry consultant. 
</P>
<P>
In the words of one federal regulator in San Francisco, "Keating stands in a 
league of his own" when it comes to seeking political influence. 
</P>
<P>
Whether it has worked is subject to debate. 
</P>
<P>
"If he's trying to buy influence, he's wasted his money," said Roger Martin, 
one of the three members of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in Washington, 
which oversees the nation's federally insured savings and loans. Martin said he 
has never encountered any "political interference" as a board member. 
</P>
<P>
While Keating's campaign contributions may have gained him access to elected 
politicians, his employment decisions have not been based on political 
considerations, an American Continental spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"That is absolutely not the intent at all," said Mark M. Connally, the 
spokesman. Connally is the son of former Texas Gov. John B. Connally, whose 
unsuccessful campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in 1980 was 
managed by Keating at one point. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Connally said Greenspan was retained at the suggestion of a New York law 
firm that American Continental had retained to fight proposed restrictions on 
the ability of thrifts to make direct investments in real estate. The law firm 
decided that it needed an expert to render an opinion on the economic damage 
the restrictions would cause, he said, and Keating was not trying to capitalize 
on Greenspan's political prominence. 
</P>
<P>
Keating's political connections are being scrutinized as part of a lawsuit 
filed recently on behalf of 22,000 bondholders who may have lost more than $250 
million that they invested in debt securities issued by American Continental. 
</P>
<P>
The suit claims that Keating and other directors and officers of American 
Continental perpetrated a "massive fraud" on unsuspecting, unsophisticated 
investors. Many had gone to Lincoln offices with the intention of placing their 
savings in insured certificates of deposit but were persuaded instead to buy 
uninsured bonds issued by American Continental, the suit claims. 
</P>
<P>
Connally said the company "absolutely denies" that it defrauded the 
bondholders. 
</P>
<P>
The suit is aimed at the company's directors and officers as well as the 
lawyers and accountants who advised them. It is being handled by two of the 
lawyers who won more than $70 million from advisers of convicted San Diego 
swindler J. David Dominelli, who bilked millions of dollars from investors. 
</P>
<P>
Keating and his cohorts, the suit alleges, tried to "cover their tracks and buy 
extra time" over the last five years by hiring or retaining former government 
officials who could use their connections to keep American Continental 
operating while the company sold more bonds. 
</P>
<P>
"Without the assistance of these and other paid professionals, the 
multimillion-dollar scheme alleged in this complaint would not have been 
possible," the suit states. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit names only one former government official -- Franklin Tom -- as a 
defendant. 
</P>
<P>
Tom, as commissioner of the California Department of Corporations, gave 
American Continental approval for a $200-million bond offering in December, 
1986. After leaving office in early 1987, he returned to private practice with 
his former Los Angeles law firm. In that capacity, he represented American 
Continental before the Department of Corporations. The firm, Parker, Milliken, 
Clark, O'Hara &amp; Samuelian, is named as a defendant in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lobbied to Kill Restrictions 
</P>
<P>
Other government officials hired or retained by Keating are not named as 
defendants in the suit. Except for Greenspan, the lawsuit identifies them only 
by their former positions. But Ronald Rus of Orange and Joseph W. Cotchett of 
Burlingame, the lawyers handling the suit, acknowledged that they are: 
</P>
<P>
* Lawrence Taggart, former commissioner of the California Department of Savings 
and Loan. On behalf of American Continental, Taggart lobbied lawmakers in an 
effort to kill restrictions on new powers that allowed S&amp;Ls to make direct 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
* John Rousselot, former U.S. congressman from San Gabriel who tried to buy 
Lincoln before regulators seized it. After leaving the presidency of an 
industry trade group last year, Rousselot was hired by American Continental as 
a consultant. * A. Melvin McDonald, a former U.S. attorney in Phoenix. Since 
leaving his post in 1985, McDonald has handled legal work for American 
Continental, including an investigation into alleged leaks by regulators about 
confidential information on the condition of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
* Joseph Kotrys, head of a controversial 1986 examination team from the Federal 
Home Loan Bank of San Francisco. Regulators in Washington threw out the team's 
report on Lincoln after it was completed in 1988 and stripped the San Francisco 
office of its supervisory responsibility for Lincoln. Kotrys works for Lincoln 
in Irvine, handling regulatory compliance matters. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also contends that Keating "enlisted the active assistance and 
intervention of many public officeholders." 
</P>
<P>
Those officeholders included five U.S. senators who met with regulators in 
April, 1987, to question a lengthy regulatory examination of Lincoln's books. 
The group consisted of John Glenn (D-Ohio), Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), John 
McCain (R-Ariz.), Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) and Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich). 
</P>
<P>
All five senators are from states in which American Continental and Lincoln 
operate. 
</P>
<P>
The five had received a total of more than $300,000 in campaign contributions 
from Keating, his family and American and Lincoln executives. Riegle 
subsequently returned the $76,000 he had been given.

Connally said none of the people identified in the suit was hired or retained 
for political reasons. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental had already retained the Parker, Milliken firm before Tom 
returned to the firm from the Department of Corporations. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving his government post, Taggart joined an old friend in a company 
partially owned by Lincoln. Since his views were similar to Keating's, he was 
"a natural" for American Continental to hire in the fight to maintain the rules 
on direct investments, Connally said. 
</P>
<P>
Keating's involvement with Greenspan arose from that same lobbying effort. The 
New York law firm retained Greenspan as an expert on the economic validity of 
the restrictions that regulators wanted to adopt. 
</P>
<P>
Connally said Kotrys and Atchison came to Keating looking for jobs. Keating did 
not lure them into the company, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't stop people from saying what they want to say," Connally said. "But 
Charlie Keating was not buying influence."

Journalistic predictions are risky. But here's a sure thing. On or before May 
30, the Bush Administration will significantly heighten trade tensions with 
Japan and a congressionally mandated report will be the catalyst. 
</P>
<P>
By that date, U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills must identify and 
initiate action against America's "unfair" trading partners who run up chronic 
trade surpluses. And Japan, exporting nearly three times what it buys from 
America, will be presumed the unfairest trader of all. 
</P>
<P>
Before leaving the Treasury Department for the State Department, James A. Baker 
III debased the "strong" Reagan dollar and improved the U.S. balance of trade 
in the process. But the export surge has stalled, at a time when America is 
still sucking in more than $10 billion worth of imports in excess of exports 
every month. And since Japan accounts for 45% of this imbalance, it will draw a 
corresponding amount, or more, of America's ire. Tokyo's large contribution to 
the stubborn U.S. deficit is accepted as prima facie proof of unfairness; the 
surplus exists, in other words, because Japan keeps its own markets closed. 
</P>
<P>
Several senators, including Democrat Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, plus the AFL-CIO, 
certain high-tech industries like semiconductors, low-tech industries like soda 
ash producers and the Commerce Department, among others, are all dead set on 
seeing Japan make the May 30 list of unfair traders. 
</P>
<P>
Some cautious voices inside the Administration, primarily at the State 
Department, warn against stigmatizing Japan just yet, especially during a 
period of uncertainty for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. They think it 
wiser to brand more tractable countries, like Korea or Brazil, before taking on 
America's creditor. But should that happen, Japan will be put on ostentatious 
notice that it's next. So the prediction still holds. 
</P>
<P>
The May report is merely one in a series mandated by the complex "Super 301" 
clause of the 1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act. In earlier 
incarnations, Section 301 was an entirely understandable, indeed invaluable, 
part of U.S. trade law. It authorized the President to impose trade sanctions 
against any country engaged in unjustifiable policy that "burdens or restricts 
United States commerce." The President could choose from a wide variety of 
sanctions, everything from an outright embargo to tariffs or quotas on foreign 
goods. Section 301, in other words, was a necessary legal recourse to hit other 
countries when they failed to live up to their negotiated trade obligations. 
</P>
<P>
Super 301 is quite another matter. In scope it is almost breathtaking, for it 
allows the United States to penalize Japan, say, for its convoluted 
distribution and marketing system. The practice does not have to be illegal 
under current international trade law. It simply has to be deemed 
"unreasonable" in America's unilateral judgment. After the May report is 
issued, the Bush Administration has 18 months to get a barrier dismantled. If 
negotiations fail, then the President will be empowered (also pressured) to 
impose sweeping sanctions against the foreign malefactor. 
</P>
<P>
For a true sense of just how misguided Super 301 is, consider the clause's 
legislative history. Only then does it become apparent that Super 301 is 
perhaps the worst piece of American trade legislation since the Smoot-Hawley 
Tariff Act of 1930. 
</P>
<P>
The story begins in May, 1982, when Houdaille Industries, a Florida-based 
conglomerate, petitioned the Reagan Administration for protection against 
Japanese machine-tool imports. 
</P>
<P>
Houdaille had been one of the top 12 U.S. machine tool builders since the 
mid-1960s but was suffering an unprecedented loss of market share to the 
Japanese. None of this was due to its own ineptitude, the conglomerate claimed. 
Rather, in a 714-page petition, Houdaille charged that Japan had instigated and 
subsidized a machine-tool cartel bent on carving up the United States and 
decimating U.S. builders. 
</P>
<P>
Houdaille's argument was an admixture of fact and fancy that did not support 
its thesis. Government subsidies and Ministry of International Trade 
exhortations were not the main reasons behind Japan's successful penetration of 
the U.S. market. Success derived from a Japanese willingness to invest heavily 
in plant and equipment, to market their products aggressively throughout the 
world, to work doggedly toward long-term goals and pay unusual attention to 
worker training and motivation. This description is derived almost verbatim 
from the finding of a study mission sent to Japan by the National Machine Tool 
Builder's Assn., the U.S. industry's major trade association. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Houdaille, and many other American builders, failed to invest 
(somewhat understandably so) during the uncertain economic climate of the 
1970s. In addition, Houdaille labor-management relations were poor, and like 
many other conglomerates it was addicted to managing by the numbers rather than 
by the product. 
</P>
<P>
Houdaille, moreover, was the first large industrial corporation to undergo a 
leveraged buyout, in 1979 (a buyout engineered by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts 
&amp; Co., the same firm that recently leveraged RJR Nabisco for $25 billion). 
Houdaille's nearly $400-million LBO played no small part in the decision to 
manufacture a Washington solution to its debt crunch: blaming the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
It's always easier to prey on American conspiratorial suspicions about Japanese 
trade and industrial practices than to engage in self-criticism. And so for 13 
months, despite its shortcomings, the novel Houdaille petition was the focal 
point for a titanic, bitter struggle between protectionists (called 
"Japan-bashers") and free-traders (called "white hats") inside the Reagan 
Administration. The petition was treated as a claim under Section 301 of the 
1974 trade law; it seized the imagination of both Congress and the press. 
</P>
<P>
When Ronald Reagan turned down Houdaille in April, 1983, the conglomerate's 
legion of sympathizers in Congress believed the company got a raw deal. So the 
lawmakers subsequently sought to reward Houdaille for its extraordinary, Don 
Quixote-like struggle. They decided the real culprit (aside from the Japanese) 
was the inadequate, pusillanimous U.S. trade law -- in particular, the fact 
that the White House was not enforcing Section 301 when American manufacturers 
were victimized by so-called predatory foreign export targeting. 
</P>
<P>
First in 1984 and then again in 1988, Congress extensively rewrote Section 301. 
Members were goaded by other beleaguered industries, most notably semiconductor 
manufacturers and organized labor. The final result was a score of far-reaching 
changes in Section 301, and its super transformation. 
</P>
<P>
Bad facts, as usual, made for bad law. Section 301 went from a necessary weapon 
to a blunt, bullying instrument. Congress' attitude was if the President wasn't 
vigorous in enforcing fair trade, it would force him, via Super 301, to perform 
that duty. And Congress attempted to accomplish this the only way -- aside from 
purse strings -- Congress knows how: by imposing a nightmarish array of 
reporting requirements, confrontational deadlines, mandatory actions and other 
micro-management practices. 
</P>
<P>
With the worst still to come, Super 301 has already caused a big headache at 
the agency charged with carrying out most of its provisions. The Office of the 
U.S. Trade Representative, one of the smallest autonomous units in federal 
government, has long enjoyed a reputation as a can-do bureaucracy and impartial 
judge of competing interests. Now it drowns in a sea of reporting requirements 
and often impossible demands, such as the mandate to quantify the cost of trade 
barriers to U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
Basic economic theory says that the value of trade barriers can never be 
measured accurately. The agency already shows signs of becoming paralyzed and 
demoralized by a paper monster while its important work goes undone. 
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, these same reporting requirements are often 
self-righteous in the extreme and violate long-standing trade goals. Take the 
report due May 30, identifying countries with unfair trade practices. That's 
like identifying a drinker at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. Every country 
engages in discriminatory practices. But the proper forum for settling disputes 
over trade practices, as the United States has heretofore argued, is the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Super 301 dispenses with the multilateral approach and exchanges it 
for crude, bilateral bullying as the U.S. government unilaterally declares 
certain practices unfair. They may well be, but several U.S. trade practices 
could also be tagged unfair by another country with a Super 301 on its books. 
Trade experts are calling this approach "procedural protectionism" because 
eventually it will provide an excuse for erecting new U.S. barriers on the 
grounds that other countries don't live up to pure free trade standards. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, however, the worst aspect of Super 301 is focus; it will divert 
attention from the profound domestic sources of America's manufacturing crisis. 
Put aside for a moment any notions of how open or closed the Japanese market 
is. When American manufacturers cannot compete or don't exist at home, the root 
problem is not foreign but domestic. Solving this problem will be a formidable 
challenge, requiring nothing less than an American brand of perestroika in both 
foreign and domestic policy. In the meantime, unbecoming and shrill exercises 
mandated by Super 301 postpone the day of reckoning, assuring that the cure 
will be all the harder for having been postponed. 
</P>
<P>
But then it is always easier to find a scapegoat.

EUROPE: FROM COMMON MARKET TO UNCOMMON CONFEDERATION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When President Bush visits Europe this month to attend the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization summit meetings he will observe two opposing tendencies -- 
Western Europe growing together, Eastern Europe moving apart. 
</P>
<P>
These developments carry the seeds of potential disruption with the revival of 
some of Europe's age-old disputes, but they also offer long-term opportunity to 
build a genuine European settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Such a possibility would need to satisfy the security needs of the Western 
Alliance and the Soviet Union, and at the same time strengthen the nascent 
plural societies beginning to emerge in Eastern Europe. With both parts of 
divided Europe on the move, the current thaw in East-West relations will 
accelerate changes already taking place. 
</P>
<P>
The future is unclear but it is not too soon to begin thinking about how those 
changes can be influenced to secure the best interests of all the people of 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Allow me to outline the view of one non-official European. The creation of a 
single market in the countries of the 12 member states of the European 
Community by the end of 1992 is an event of the greatest economic significance. 
The intention is to establish a commercial policy on a continental scale. 
Myriad national regulations governing foodstuffs, automobiles, construction and 
other industries will be mutually recognized as valid by all member states; 
capital movements will be freed; public procurement policies will be made more 
open. By these and other decisions a more free market will be created. Many 
obstacles will still remain such as currency problems, taxes and excise duties 
which neither governments nor public opinion will be willing to solve by 
yielding national sovereignty. Nevertheless, the general direction toward 
unification is irreversible and by the end of 1992 several giant steps will 
have been taken. 
</P>
<P>
Some Americans fear the creation of "fortress Europe"; I believe this to be 
inaccurate. Although there will be tensions, for example over agriculture, the 
community is not protectionist in origin or outlook. Hard bargaining and the 
knowledge that our joint interests are overriding will keep these problems in 
perspective, while the spread of protectionism will be held at bay as long as 
the world does not slide into recession and our systems can provide jobs in a 
period of rapid change. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union and Eastern Europe is altogether a different case. The supply 
side of these economies cannot meet a huge pent-up consumer demand. So far, 
perestroika shows few signs of the benefits that Mikhail S. Gorbachev looks 
for. He has a long row to hoe before the Soviet Union can consider itself a 
part of the world economy in any competitive sense. 
</P>
<P>
There will be little time and few resources to devote to foreign adventures, 
and if Mr. Gorbachev can save money on defense without endangering Soviet 
security he will do so. His announced intention that within two years he will 
cut Soviet forces by 500,000, will withdraw 50,000 troops from Eastern Europe 
and will reduce the number of tanks in East Germany by 10,000 may mean that he 
has absorbed Walter Lippmann's dictum that a wise foreign policy must be 
solvent; there must be a balance between military, economic and political 
commitments and a state's effective power. 
</P>
<P>
But this praiseworthy attempt at a more realistic balance carries its own 
dangers. We have already seen that the relaxation of Moscow's centralized grip 
over its republics has led to instability in Latvia and Georgia, while the 
tension between Armenia and Azerbaijan could easily be repeated on a larger 
scale between the states of Eastern Europe themselves, where the East-West thaw 
is uncovering ancient animosities frozen for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Long disputed borders are emerging as a source of friction. So are complaints 
by minority groups about their treatment. Claims by Eastern European countries 
to annexed territories are being revived. These grievances, silently nursed for 
decades, are now reinforced by a thirst for basic human rights and democratic 
practice. Together they form a potentially explosive compound. 
</P>
<P>
All of these questions, inseparably bound up with the Soviet Union's estimate 
of its own security needs, will come to the fore in the next few years -- and 
looming over all will be the future of the two Germanys. 
</P>
<P>
Western Europe exorcised ancient Franco-German hostility with the creation of 
the European Community, to which West Germany anchored itself by freely taken 
decision. Now it is the turn of Eastern Europe to discover its own path forward 
from outdated nationalism and the West should stand ready to assist. 
</P>
<P>
Henry A. Kissinger has challenged us (Opinion, April 16) to delineate a concept 
for Europe's future. In response I offer mine: Our goal should be the creation 
of a Grand European Confederation open to any country in East and West Europe, 
but not including the Soviet Union. Its core structure might initially be an 
agreement between the European Community and those other countries -- whether 
members of the Soviet Bloc or not -- that wished to join and would fulfill 
defined conditions about human rights and a minimum level of democratic 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
The confederation should start work in such areas as the provision of common 
public services, the protection of the environment, the freer movement of 
workers and, as confidence grows, move to other issues. 
</P>
<P>
Both NATO and the Warsaw Pact would continue to exist, with no alteration in 
the present status of the two Germanys, although I would expect as the years 
went by differences would lessen and the military pacts would become less 
important. Such a concept would need frank, prolonged and detailed discussion 
with the Soviet Union, in which the United States would have an essential role. 
Nothing would be possible until the Soviet Union was reassured about its own 
security, while the presence of the United States is essential -- initially to 
safeguard Western Europe, and then as time passes, as a guarantor of the 
European confederation's peaceful intent. 
</P>
<P>
The signs are that the forthcoming NATO summit will spend much of its time 
discussing the modernization of nuclear weapons, a subject of wide 
disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
Is it too much to hope that somewhere on the agenda a space might be found to 
discuss ideas on which a positive and constructive concept for a new Europe 
might be founded?

ARMING THE MIDDLE EAST: AN OMINOUS LIST EXPANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

the Free University of Rome.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The quickening arms race in the Middle East is raising concerns among nations 
bordering the Mediterranean. Libya, Israel, Syria, Iraq and Egypt have acquired 
new and dangerous military technology, dramatically increasing the dangers of 
local confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
Europeans, who welcomed the elimination of the SS-20, cruise and Pershing 2 
missiles, are dismayed by the prospect of a proliferation of new 
mass-destruction weapons at their southern doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
The list of hardware creating ominous risks gets longer every month: chemical 
weapons, missiles, nuclear arsenals and sophisticated bombers. 
</P>
<P>
As for Col. Moammar Kadafi's chemical plant, strong U.S. pressures have not 
prevented the continuing transfer of technology and basic materials from 
industrialized countries to Libya, according to European sources. The Western 
World will soon have to decide what to do about it, but in the meantime a new 
dimension has been added to the Libyan threat: the Soviet supply to Tripoli of 
high-performance bombers and an airborne refueler. 
</P>
<P>
Allies on the southern flank of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have 
been puzzled by the Soviet move, which contradicts the Kremlin's claim that 
Moscow wants to play a more conciliatory role in the Arab-Israeli conflict, 
seeking to increase its influence in the region through policies that bolster 
stability, rather than undermine it. 
</P>
<P>
The international press has focused its attention on the threat that an 
enhanced Libyan capability might imply for Israel. However, William H. Webster, 
director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, recently told a congressional 
committee that if Libya extended the range and performances of its warplanes, 
the entire balance of power in the region could be altered. All the more so, 
given Kadafi's unpredictability. A couple of years ago he substantiated his 
threats against Italy by ordering two Scud missiles -- which fortunately missed 
-- to be fired at the Italian island of Lampedusa. Kadafi claimed a U.S. Coast 
Guard station on Lampedusa had guided American planes on their April, 1986, 
raid on Libya. The Italian Ministry of Defense has pointedly announced that new 
radar systems will be installed in the southern part of the peninsula, 
acknowledging that the Soviet SU-24 bombers recently sold to Libya could, if 
refueled in the air, reach all of Italy -- as well as parts of France and West 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
While the chemical weapons situation is not encouraging, recent developments 
concerning missiles and their potential payloads are no brighter. These weapons 
appear to be more freely available in the international arms market than was 
intended by the seven industrial nations (the United States, Britain, Canada, 
France, Italy, Japan and West Germany) when they agreed to restrict access to 
missile technology in April, 1987, with the Missile Technology Control Regime. 
And now there is a growing risk that surface-to-surface medium-range missiles 
will be armed with nuclear warheads and spread throughout the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials have alleged that Iraq is secretely engaged in a crash 
program to build nuclear warheads for a medium-range missile under development 
with technical and financial assistance from Argentina and Egypt. While the 
missile project (called Condor 2 by the Argentines) has been confirmed, the 
allegations about the Iraqi nuclear program have raised doubts. Both the news 
and the unconfirmed allegations, nevertheless, offer Israel a good reason -- or 
a good pretext -- for proceeding with its crash program on nuclear arms, 
missiles and other sophisticated weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates on the number of atomic warheads Israel possesses vary considerably, 
depending on interpretations given to data that Israeli technician Mordechai 
Vanunu disclosed in his Oct. 5, 1986, interview with the London Sunday Times. 
Israel might have an arsenal of 100 to 200 nuclear devices, according to 
several specialists who analyzed the data and examined the photographs supplied 
by Vanunu. Accepting the authenticity of his technical data, Theodore Taylor, a 
former U.S. weapons designer, and Frank Barnaby, a British nuclear scientist 
who debriefed Vanunu extensively, also believe Israel has produced weapons that 
use nuclear fusion: H-bombs. 
</P>
<P>
The consensus among U.S. officials who have access to the information provided 
by intelligence sources is that Israel's nuclear arsenal contains no more than 
50 to 70 devices. Yet even an arsenal of this size is much bigger than all 
previous estimates and could enable Israel to develop a nuclear strategy based 
on a panoply of tactical, medium range and strategic atomic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
This is a distinct change in the Middle East scenario. France has been until 
now the only medium-size power to have a totally independent nuclear deterrent, 
the force de frappe -- striking force -- and an original doctrine for its 
employment. Has the force de frappe concept proliferated? Israel is apparently 
developing a missile that can reach the Soviet Union. Should we conclude that 
Israel has a nuclear defense strategy? 
</P>
<P>
If this is a plausible conclusion, then Gen. Charles de Gaulle's predictions 
have been proved right. De Gaulle was utterly skeptical about the possibility 
of preventing the spread of atomic weapons trough international constraints. 
His nuclear doctrine was based on the assumption that every industrial nation 
would, in time, possess its own nuclear arsenal composed of a panoply of 
weapons adapted to its specific situation and needs -- its own force de frappe. 
</P>
<P>
The importance of Israel's nuclear development has increased to a point that it 
might constitute an Israeli force de frappe doctrine -- a doctrine playing a 
vital role in Israeli defense and strategic thinking. This, in turn, gives a 
powerful impetus to the arms buildup of the Arab and Muslim states in the 
region. Something must be done to arrest this calamitous spiral.

TEAS AND CHINAS AT THE HUNTINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the second spring for the remodeled rose garden at the Huntington 
Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens in San Marino, and the flowering 
is so profuse that one cannot tell the old from the new. Indeed, Ann Christoph, 
who did the plans, has handled the space so deftly that the inherent 
aberrations add to the charm. 
</P>
<P>
"All are at different angles," she commented, talking about the rose garden 
itself and the surrounding Shakespeare Garden, the former residence of Henry E. 
Huntington that now serves as art gallery, the rose arbor and the patio 
restaurant that was Huntington's pool and billiard room. The problem started 
when Huntington planted the rose garden before he built his home, then changed 
the house plans to preserve two stately oak trees, skewing the intended 
alignments. "My problem was to preserve the gracious and semiformal design 
without making it look like an obvious mistake," Christoph added. 
</P>
<P>
The rose garden was planted in January of 1908, featuring large blocks of 
color, with no more than 200 varieties, most of them common and popular, 
according to Clair Martin III, curator of roses. Now there are more than 1,700 
different types, including one of the world's greatest collections of the Tea 
and China roses that reached Europe from China at the beginning of the 19th 
Century, the first roses that flower repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington has a special Mother Lode collection of Teas and Chinas. "I go 
periodically to the old cemeteries in the Gold Rush country of California to 
get cuttings," Martin said, smiling at the thought of himself, a tall and 
conspicuous horticulturist, armed with pruning shears, working his way past old 
gravestones. In this way, he harvests some of the 2,000 China and Tea cultivars 
that were transported around the Horn from England and the East Coast to 
California from 1850 to 1900. 
</P>
<P>
Near the China and Tea roses are the old garden roses -- Martin calls them 
"O.G.R.'s." Some date to the beginnings of history. But they bloom just once a 
year. Crossing the "O.G.R.'s" with the Chinas and the Teas created the modern 
roses that bloom in California from April until Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"Gardens like this, and Exposition Park and Descanso have great value besides 
being beautiful and quiet places," Martin commented. "Visitors can see how the 
different roses grow, actually in the ground, and under different conditions, 
before they buy them." 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Gardens are engaged in the future of roses as one of 30 test 
centers for the annual selection of All America Roses and with a display of all 
the recent All America selections. The affection for the past, however, is 
evident in Martin's special pride with a huge new bed planted to honor the 
genius of David Austin, an English hybridizer who has developed 60 different 
cultivars with the fragrance, soft colors and shapes of the roses of old, all 
with names drawn from English literature and history. "He loves Shakespeare and 
Chaucer, which ties in nicely with our library," Martin said, leaning over to 
sniff a creamy pink named Lordly Oberone, and another called Chaucer. 
"Unbelievable," he said. And they were.

CHENEY ON GORBACHEV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cheney is a brave man ("Cheney Predicts Gorbachev Will Fail, Be Ousted," Part 
I, April 29). He appears to be the only Cabinet officer willing to express 
openly the hidden agenda of the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
By predicting the failure of Gorbachev's reform efforts, he attempts to justify 
U.S. resistance to Gorbachev's many initiatives to relax the present 
U.S.-Soviet military confrontation. Cheney argues for continued pressure on the 
Soviets in the form of increased Western European defense spending plus 
alliance resistance to nuclear reductions. 
</P>
<P>
His prediction of Gorbachev's failure is a classic example of a self-fulfilling 
prophecy. Keep the pressure on as a means of bringing Gorbachev down and then 
point to the consequences and say, "I told you so." 
</P>
<P>
Why would anyone advocate a no-win strategy? Simple. If one wants to justify 
large military forces and promote a huge military budget, it helps to have a 
strong, threatening enemy. Hard-line Soviet leadership would satisfy the enemy 
role far better than the dovish Gorbachev who daily weakens the Soviet's enemy 
image. 
</P>
<P>
There is a genuine opportunity today for constructive agreements to reduce the 
level of conventional and nuclear armaments in Europe. It is irresponsible to 
pursue policies designed to block such reductions in a cynical attempt to 
perpetuate record levels of military spending.

GRAB THAT OPPORTUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Southern Pacific Transportation Co. has offered Los Angeles-area transit 
officials an opportunity to move closer to having the modern, integrated 
mass-transit system that it needs. The opportunity should not be missed. 
</P>
<P>
The company is offering to sell local governments more than 75 miles of 
railroad lines that are no longer being used. The lines are all along, or close 
to, transportation corridors where officials have discussed putting additions 
to mass-transit systems already being built, like the Metro Rail subway and the 
Los Angeles-Long Beach light-rail line. If the old railroad lines are 
integrated into the new systems, the resulting transit routes would link 
downtown Los Angeles with Santa Monica to the west, the heart of Orange County 
to the south and San Bernardino to the east. 
</P>
<P>
The longest of the three rail-line segments that Southern Pacific is offering 
to sell runs 50 miles from San Bernardino to Los Angeles. It runs through 
existing cities like Covina as well as the rapidly developing Fontana area. 
There also is a 14-mile segment that starts in Santa Monica, runs parallel to 
the Santa Monica Freeway to Venice Boulevard, then runs along Exposition 
Boulevard to USC and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, terminating close to 
the route of the light-rail line to Long Beach. And there is a 12-mile segment 
that could serve Orange County, running from Stanton through Cerritos to 
Norwalk, where the new Century Freeway will eventually include a light-rail 
link to Los Angeles International Airport, intersecting with the Los 
Angeles-Long Beach line along the way. The Orange County Transit District has 
already purchased the old Southern Pacific right-of-way from Stanton to Santa 
Ana. The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission should use the same kind 
of foresight and move quickly to pursue this latest offer. 
</P>
<P>
Experts have long debated how a vast area like greater Los Angeles could best 
be served by mass transit, and more than one specialist has pointed out that 
the simplest means of linking the area's many cities together would be to 
follow the old railroad routes that helped define this region's sprawl in the 
first place. In the past, some railroad officials have resisted giving up their 
old rights-of-way, despite a reduction in railroad traffic. But in this case, 
Southern Pacific is not just willing to talk, but to sell, an offer of 
negotiations not to be missed.

CHENEY ON GORBACHEV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cheney's prediction of Gorbachev's demise was obviously meant to rationalize 
further spending on Star Wars and other defense programs we can no longer 
afford, and no longer need. But his remarks came off as both arrogant and 
incredibly funny, considering that reforms in the Soviet Union stand a much 
better chance than reforms of the Pentagon and the defense establishment. 
</P>
<P>
I predict that Cheney will be unable to reform the hopelessly corrupt and 
cumbersome procurement process, and will be overthrown by the defense 
contractors.

OBSERVATORIES

Reading Paul Grossberg's letter, I must concur with his "observations" on the 
famous observatory. 
</P>
<P>
When we moved here 17 years ago we were delighted to be living so close and 
made the trip, coming away with the same disappointment. Ten years later we 
tried again, hoping to find some improvement in the public relations of this 
facility. How can we inspire some effort to enlighten the visitors, especially 
children, on what an observatory means to astronomers and how it operates?

NEED FOR ELECTRIC CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It seemed an interesting coincidence on the April 20 Editorial Page when a 
letter about electric cars followed your editorial on fuel-efficiency 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
One can only hope that the Bush Administration will follow through on these 
initial steps toward a fuel economy policy, and maybe even a national energy 
policy. If our energy demand continues to rise as it has in the Reagan years, 
OPEC will again be calling the shots as it did in the 1970s. Also, the large 
part of our trade deficit attributable to imported oil should not be 
overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
As for electric cars, all is not lost. During the Ford-Carter years the 
government had a very active program for electric car development. When the 
Reagan Administration took over, the order went out to stop all such commercial 
nonsense. Fortunately Congress, in its wisdom, insisted that a very modest 
($10-$12 million annually) program of research and development be continued. 
Such an effort is ongoing. Consequently, vastly improved batteries, drive 
trains, transmissions, motors and controllers are available for the next 
generation of electric vehicles. The state-of-the-art can now provide a 
delivery van or utility vehicle that can more than satisfy the mileage 
requirements. Think of the smog alleviation if most of the urban and inner-city 
vans and delivery trucks were electric.

PROPOSITION 103 RULING: A PYRRHIC VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM C. GEORGE, William C. George was chief consultant for the Assembly 
Finance and Insurance Committee for nine years. He currently is chief 
consultant for bill analysis for the Assembly. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
And so the big news of the day is that the constitutionality of last November's 
Proposition 103 has been upheld by California's Supreme Court. Or has it? A 
closer reading of the opinion shows that the justices -- even though they found 
the 20% rollback permissible -- refused to allow insurance companies to be 
hammered into bankruptcy, regardless of how laudable the initiative's goal. The 
court also selectively upheld various provisions of the proposition to allow 
several loopholes significant enough to drive an uninsured truck through. 
</P>
<P>
The voters got their rate rollback but only for the time that it will take an 
insurer to run over to the commissioner's office and file an application for 
higher rates -- and immediately begin charging them. Because even though the 
court found the rollback constitutional, it said that the allowable rates must 
be "fair and reasonable," which means a fair rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
Even after Nov. 8, when rates must be approved by the commissioner before they 
can be charged, the commissioner can approve an interim rate pending her final 
decision. So voters are cautioned not to make that down payment on the vacation 
they were going to pay for with their insurance premium refunds. You'll be 
needing that money shortly. 
</P>
<P>
So what if we aren't going to get the refund? The insurers have to renew our 
policies. Yes, that's what the court said -- unless, of course, there is a 
"substantial increase in the hazard insured against," in which case the court 
said, they don't have to renew. And when the insurer does renew, it is 
"guaranteed fair and reasonable rates," according to the court. In other words, 
it has to renew but not necessarily at the same price. 
</P>
<P>
Well, it still looks like we've got the insurers where we want them -- they 
can't leave the state. Or can they? The court said that they can leave 
California as long as they follow the steps set out in the state Insurance 
Code. In fact, the court said Proposition 103 recognizes the possibility that 
insurers may withdraw from some insurance markets. 
</P>
<P>
But if the insurers stick around, we have this consumer advocacy corporation 
that will go after them. Wrong again -- the court threw that out because it 
violates the state Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Well, how about getting a refund from some of those so-called old obscene 
profits? I don't think so, because the court said: "profits from the past 
cannot be used to sustain confiscatory rates for the future . . . no case 
supports an unreasonably low rate of return on the ground that past profits 
were excessive." 
</P>
<P>
So what do we have after this "victory for consumers?" Beginning in November of 
this year, we'll have a new way of regulating insurance rates called "prior 
approval," which means that the Department of Insurance will have to 
substantially increase its staff to handle all the applications for rate 
increases. According to the legislative analyst, for the first full year 
(1989-90), an additional 300 people and $15 million to $16 million will be 
required to implement Proposition 103. And as the analyst points out, the money 
for all this comes from "fees levied on insurance companies, brokers and 
agents." Since these are legitimate costs of doing business, they can be 
included in the premium rate base. In other words, our rates will increase 
because of our consumer victory. But it's good for employment in the 
commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
And so after this agony that began last November, the problem is still with us. 
Insurance prices are still pretty much as they have been and will stay there 
until someone challenges them. At which time they will be vigorously defended 
by the insurers in both administrative and judicial hearings. 
</P>
<P>
What have we learned? For one thing, we've learned that we should examine our 
consumer advocates to see if they know very much about what they are trying to 
do. In the case of Proposition 103, it was clear early on that drafters Harvey 
Rosenfield and Ralph Nader were ignorant of the biggest consumer vs. insurer 
issue around at the time -- the practice of insurers denying or delaying claims 
in bad faith. In 1979 the California Supreme Court said that both first- and 
third-party claimants could sue the insurer under the unfair-claims statutes 
and were not limited solely to a complaint to the commissioner. In 1988 our new 
court overturned that decision and destroyed the most effective sanction 
consumers had against insurers. Although another of last November's ballot 
measures, Proposition 100, would have restored the right to sue for unfair 
claims practices, Proposition 103 was conspicuously silent on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
After Proposition 103's tortuous trail through the initiative process, the 
election and the courtroom, Rosenfield and Nader must feel like Epirus' King 
Pyrrhus after his victory over the Romans in 279 BC. After winning the battle 
at a cost of the lives of most of his men, Pyrrhus was heard to remark 
something like "One more victory like that and I'll lose the war."

DREAM A LITTLE DREAM, BUT BE HONEST: WHAT WOULD YOU REALLY DO WITH $12 MILLION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY TABER, Wendy Taber is a writer who lives in Northridge.

<TEXT>
<P>
My husband walks in at 11:43 Saturday night, eyes downcast, clothes rumpled, a 
smudge that looks like lipstick on his collar. He is four hours late and I am 
furious. My stomach knots, but I have to ask. He knows that I have to ask. 
</P>
<P>
"Where have you been?" 
</P>
<P>
He shuffles his feet a bit, then reaches for his pocket. "Don't worry," he 
says. Clenched between his forefinger and thumb, he produces the 
orange-and-white ticket. Our marriage is saved. 
</P>
<P>
It's Lotto time. Every Wednesday and Saturday, regardless of health or mood, we 
ritualistically plunk down two dollars for two Quick Picks. 7-11. Bob's Liquor. 
Mark's Valley Drugs. It's doesn't matter that in almost two years we have won 
only $10 and have spent $212. It doesn't matter that the odds of winning big 
are 14 million to one. Driven by the California Lottery's "Dream a Little 
Dream," we enthusiastically make the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Petty was wrong. The waiting isn't the hardest part, it's the best part (so 
far). Since we always wait to read the winning numbers in the morning paper, we 
have approximately 12 hours, twice a week, to fantasize about how we will spend 
the millions we have won. By 7 a.m., there is $57 left of the $12 million and 
we are out of milk. 
</P>
<P>
How did we spend it? Not on chalets in Switzerland or Rolls-Royces or yachts or 
Beverly Hills. Call it proletarian, but my big dream is to pay off our four 
maxed-out Mastercards. And then sending the banks a note. A nasty note. 
</P>
<P>
I dream of paying an inventor to invent a tracking device that can locate my 
20-month-old daughter's shoes. 
</P>
<P>
I dream of buying out the major magazines that have sent rejection notices back 
with my untouched manuscripts and dedicating a whole issue to my writing. 
</P>
<P>
I dream of buying See's Candies and refusing to sell to people who weigh under 
135 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
My husband is a schoolteacher and his dreams, understandably, are different. He 
dreams of summers without starvation (or, at least, the threat of starvation). 
</P>
<P>
He dreams of taking over my job, being able to stay home with our two young 
daughters. (I suspect, however, he privately dreams of hiring a part-time 
nanny). 
</P>
<P>
Together, we have power dreams. 
</P>
<P>
We dream of being able to own our own house, in any place but Sacramento, 
sometime before retirement. 
</P>
<P>
We dream of being able to afford a baby-sitter once a week so we can see movies 
like "Skin Deep" and complain about wasting $13 on the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
We dream about replacing all the burned-out light bulbs in the house. 
</P>
<P>
We dream about being able to afford the processing fee for the nine rolls of 
film sitting in the kitchen drawer. 
</P>
<P>
We dream of hiring a person to pick up and deliver videos for the rest of our 
lives and the lives of our children. 
</P>
<P>
We dream of buying the beer factory on Roscoe Boulevard and turning it into a 
flower factory. If we don't have enough money for that dream, we dream of 
buying oxygen tanks for everyone who's within smelling distance on warm days 
and nights. 
</P>
<P>
We dream of hiring someone to organize the 8,423 toy pieces scattered 
throughout the house and garage. 
</P>
<P>
Of course we have your basic liberal, border-line communist dream of feeding 
the hungry. But realistically, $12 million isn't enough to feed millions of 
hungry Americans for too long, and it's not nearly enough to run for President. 
</P>
<P>
Some dreams are scheme dreams. We dream about making more millions by owning 
the first facility where you can work out, sip a margarita and do your laundry 
at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
We have a lot of revenge dreams, too. They involve the computer store that 
turned us down for credit in 1985 and the man in the red Mercedes that jumped a 
traffic light and smashed into our car. They involve the person who stole our 
Hyundai's stereo and the insurance company that refuses to buy a new one. 
</P>
<P>
But these particular dreams shouldn't be detailed in writing. 
</P>
<P>
It is now Sunday morning and we have lost. We didn't even get one number. Ouch. 
</P>
<P>
But there is sunshine in the forecast, and at age 30 Joe can still play a mean 
game of basketball; our kids are healthy and brilliant, and after four years of 
marriage and motherhood, I still get carded. Things aren't too bad. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, Wednesday is just 72 hours away.

ON VIEW: MARLBOROUGH'S VIOLETS ARE IN BLOOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marlborough School in Los Angeles' Hancock Park, a school that calls its 
students "violets," has reached 100 years, without wrinkles. More vibrant than 
ever, it sends five seniors to Harvard this year from a class of 70. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, the violets staged a black-tie gala at the Western Heritage 
Museum to culminate a year's activities and a final weekend, including an 
alumnae luncheon (honoring "A Woman From Each Decade"), a headmaster's wine 
reception, an evening of musical comedy ("Then and Now"), a Saturday of 
seminars and a Sunday of class reunion brunches at homes all over the city. 
</P>
<P>
Centennial Celebration Committee chairman Terry Von Hagen Bucher, class of '59, 
who spent five months in Antarctica this year doing postgraduate research on 
penguins, was ecstatic about the celebration: "Marlborough has succeeded for 
100 years because of people; people will help us survive another 100 years." 
</P>
<P>
At the black-tie gathering trustees chairman Susanne Fitger Donnelly, '50, 
noted: "The one thing that we hope will never change is the teaching of values 
-- that is what has distinguished Marlborough in its 100-year history." 
</P>
<P>
The committee chose Pam Mullin and Barbara Myerson to chair the party and the 
duo staged a huge tent washed in mauve lights and projected violets on the tent 
ceiling. Then the crowd danced the night away on a black-and-white 
checkerboard. Among the many were Louise (centennial co-chair) and Peter Reich, 
Patti and Pat Doheny (she was the generations tea co-chairman with their 
daughter Kacey McCoy, who was at Cate School for son Patrick's graduation), 
Suzy and Don Crowell, Bill and Daryn Horton. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees Peter Mullin, Hugh Evans, Donn Miller, Marjorie Wong Chen and Dr. 
Henry Takei were among the crowd. Shelley Dickerson and Betsy Barash flew in 
from New York. Said trustee Martha Porter Mitchel (wearing splendid green 
taffeta) on the arm of husband Glen: "We have come a long way and all these 
Marlborough students look terrific." Said Peter Mullin: "Marlborough has 
changed in the sense that the curriculum is a broader experience. From a proper 
girls' school, it now prepares students for a broader and more complicated 
world." 
</P>
<P>
COOLING DOWN: There were no penguins, no polar bears, no snow or icicles -- 
except on the invitation Lisa Williamson designed for the "housecooling" party 
in San Marino of the English manor house owned for years by her grandmother, 
the late Ruth Chandler von Platen. Warren (Spud) Williamson, Sue Dulin and 
Norman (Tad) Williamson, Mrs. Von Platen's children, extended the invitations 
to old and close friends because they are parting with the manor house and its 
five acres of gardens, the scene for countless black-tie Christmas parties, 
weddings and charity affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The night was special for Spud and Alyce Williamson's son, Henry. Not only was 
it his 27th birthday, but he announced his engagement to Robin Ferrante, 
daughter of Lucy and Orlando Ferrante (a Disney executive) of San Marino. It 
also was special for Adams, Duque &amp; Hazeltine attorney Waller Taylor. The 
house was built for his grandmother, the late Mrs. Frank Emery, in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
For the occasion, the hosts imported Igor and His Cowboy Jazz Band from 
Arizona. There was a lot of heated stomping by a good percentage of the 
Polytechnic Class of 1943 -- Spud's class -- including Bill Taverner, Karl von 
Platen Jr., David Wilson, Ben Shattuck, Stuart O'Melveny, Anne Shattuck. 
</P>
<P>
The party was held under a huge clear tent with sparkly lights, not too unlike 
that erected when Sue Williamson and Bob Dulin married. All their children were 
there -- Jim Dulin, Cinnie Herr and Ken Dulin with their respective spouses, 
Sarah, Frank and Sally. The Jim Dulins and the Herrs live in Chicago, the Ken 
Dulins in Denver. More good friends were Sally and Bill Wenzlau, Sallie and 
Harry Colmery, Connie and Gordon Fish. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end, Tad Williamson picked up his banjo, and to the whistles from 
son Jonathan, played those old-time sing-along favorites while his wife, 
Victoria, and son Fred and his new wife, Kate, and son Chandler and daughter 
Emily gave support. 
</P>
<P>
More in the crowd were Charles Thornton, Dodie and Otis Booth, Martha Chandler, 
Ruth Williamson, neighbors Julie and Art Pizzinat, Sally Lewis, Gwen and Bob 
Cheesewright, Frannie Clayton, Anne and Susan Babcock, Mimi and Nelson Jones. 
Attempting two parties in one night, Spike and Debbe Booth, Bob and Janice 
Carpenter and Eunice and Doug Goodan managed to attend both the housecooling 
and the Marlborough centennial. 
</P>
<P>
LEADERS: Not always does the YWCA of Los Angeles bestow its Athena Award, its 
ultimate tribute. Caroline Ahmanson, Judith Murphy, Anna Bing Arnold and Ann 
Shaw are the previous recipients over 15 years. At a huge luncheon at the 
Bonaventure, the fifth Athena Award went to Harriet McElroy Luckman, wife of 
architect Charles Luckman and herself architect of the Muses and Les Dames de 
Champagne. "I share this with all of you," she said. "We couldn't get along 
without us." 
</P>
<P>
Receiving Silver Achievement Awards were Ruth Ashton Taylor, communications; 
Betty Kozasa, public service; Joan A. Payden, business and industry 
(entrepreneur); Nancy Dicks, business and industry (corporate), Varnette 
Honeywood, creative arts; Brenda Levin, professions/science; Janet Evans, 
sports; and Vikki Carr, volunteer community service. Maria Contreras-Sweet 
chaired the luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
SALUTES: The Coro Public Affairs Awards recognize leadership and dynamic

NEVER TOO LATE TO KEEP IN SHAPE; 
</P>
<P>
AT 73, FOOTBALL HAS PASSED HIM BY . . . BUT NOT FITNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON, Dr. Neil Solomon is a specialist in endocrinology and 
metabolism and an authority on obesity. He also holds a doctorate in 
psychology. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: At the age of 73, I have given up all hope of becoming a professional 
football player. But my son keeps after me to do some walking every day because 
he says it will make me feel better. At my age, I feel better doing as little 
as possible. Do you see any good that walking would do for someone my age? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Exercise should be a part of the routine of all people, regardless of 
age, although the type of exercise obviously has to be tailored to the 
individual's particular needs. From what you write in your letter, your son is 
suggesting that you do some walking, not that you become a professional 
football player; there is a difference between the two. 
</P>
<P>
Walking can help an older person maintain muscle strength and agility. Not only 
can this have a beneficial effect on the person's overall well-being and 
quality of life, the physical benefits include a reduction in the risk of 
accidental falls, a serious occurrence in the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I go to a track in a high school in my neighborhood for some walking 
exercise a few times a week, and I meet a lot of other walkers and some runners 
there. Some of the runners check their pulse while they exercise, and I would 
like to know why they do this and what it is that they are looking for. 
</P>
<P>
A: The pulse rate indicates how hard your cardiovascular system is working. 
Many people who engage in aerobic exercise check their pulse by obtaining the 
rate for 10 seconds and multiplying that figure by six to get the rate per 
minute. A healthy 20-year-old, for example, should have a pulse rate after 10 
minutes of exercise in the range of 138 to 174. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Professional athletes go where it's warm to get into shape, but very few of 
us who work for a living can do the same. I jog during the year and I also like 
to keep in shape during the winter months, but I don't know if jogging in cold 
weather is a good idea. Can't it hurt the lungs if you breathe cold air? 
</P>
<P>
A: Breathing cold air is not harmful to the lungs because the body warms the 
air as you breathe it. If the cold air bothers you, however, you might try 
wearing a scarf over your nose and mouth; you may find that this added 
protection makes breathing somewhat easier. 
</P>
<P>
If you decide against running outside in the cold weather, there are a number 
of alternatives. An indoor track is one possibility, and a brisk walk, which 
can even be taken in a shopping center, can be beneficial. A stationary bicycle 
and a rowing machine are other possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I hear more and more about the immune system, especially concerning AIDS. 
Would you please explain just what the immune system is or what it does? 
</P>
<P>
A: The immune system protects the individual from infection and takes part in 
the regulation of normal processes within the body. 
</P>
<P>
As you might expect, it is a complicated network. It consists of organs, 
tissues, cells and regulatory substances that circulate in the blood. 
</P>
<P>
In some diseases, there are changes in the cells. These changes seem to 
contribute to the disease. 
</P>
<P>
An immune response can protect a person from infection. In chicken pox, for 
example, the immune system is stimulated to produce antibodies that will react 
against the virus. Subsequently, on exposure to the virus, the antibodies will 
help destroy it. This is the reason it is a rare event when someone gets 
chicken pox more than once. 
</P>
<P>
The same sequence of events would occur naturally with a disease such as polio; 
however, polio is too dangerous to leave to nature. Therefore, people are given 
polio vaccine, which stimulates the immune system without subjecting the 
individual to the risk of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I know someone who was told by her doctor that she had fibrocystic disease 
but that it is not cancer. If it is not cancer, can you please tell me what it 
is? 
</P>
<P>
A: Fibrocystic disease refers to a variety of benign conditions of the breast. 
It is manifested by a feeling of lumpiness or by breasts that are irregular to 
the touch. As you note in your letter, fibrocystic disease is not a cancerous 
condition, nor does the fact that a woman has fibrocystic disease mean that she 
is going to get cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The condition is very common and has been estimated to occur in as many as 80% 
of women. In fact, some physicians believe that almost all women over 30 years 
of age have some fibrocystic breast tissue.

<P>
ON AGING: RETIREES CAN HELP END TEACHER SHORTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By The UCLA/USC Long-Term Care Gerontology Center 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is there a teacher shortage? If you're talking to the National Education Assn., 
Carnegie Foundation or Rand Corp., the answer is yes. But the National Center 
for Education Information, Department of Education and Bureau of Labor 
Statistics say no. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides agree that the profession has been helped by recent reforms, 
including better pay and more decision-making power in the classroom. The Labor 
Department contends that these changes, along with "normal market adjustments," 
should prevent shortages and may even let schools be more selective in hiring. 
</P>
<P>
But suppose the demand for teachers does not exceed supply? One solution would 
be President Bush's program to encourage "alternative certification" that would 
"allow talented Americans from every field to teach in America's classrooms." A 
largely untapped pool of potential teachers being eyed are those retiring from 
business, industry and the military, and homemakers. 
</P>
<P>
Given that people are living longer and many seek early retirement, launching a 
second career is feasible. 
</P>
<P>
How could this potential be tapped? A state, for example, in partnership with 
local companies, could launch a recruitment campaign aimed at private-sector 
employees, military personnel and homemakers. Recruits would receive 90 days of 
intensive teacher training at a state university, followed by a semester of 
assistant teaching under an experienced mentor. 
</P>
<P>
For recruits coming from early retirement in the private sector, employers 
could be encouraged to pay part of the teaching salaries, a subsidy made 
possible by lower pensions provided to early retirees. 
</P>
<P>
Corporations such as Polaroid, Digital and IBM have been experimenting with 
creating teaching paths for early retirees, and 23 states are experimenting 
with alternative-certification paths. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Recently, my 72-year-old father and I got into an argument when I 
told him I planned to mortgage my house to remodel the kitchen. He claims I'm 
being irresponsible by assuming so much debt. Are these generational 
differences common? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Your experience illustrates what one researcher contends many overlook: 
that money means more than dollars and cents. Says Francis Lomas Feldman of 
USC: "Money has special economic and social" connotations that usually reflect 
back on "something that happened earlier in the person's life." 
</P>
<P>
For many Americans age 65 and older, that "something" was the Great Depression. 
These survivors may be "very careful about money because they remember how 
important it was (in the 1930s) to save for a rainy day," Feldman notes. 
</P>
<P>
Such conservative habits may place Depression babies at odds with baby boomers, 
who grew up in a more prosperous, consumption-oriented society. In recent 
years, the boomers' spending rate has jumped 15% despite evidence that their 
real income has dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Older people may feel uneasy about such spending patterns. Moreover, many view 
costly contemporary products and goods as extravagances. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, younger adults may fail to recognize that attitudes toward 
money form early in life and are not easily relinquished. Also, they may not 
appreciate that money and control over it often heightens a person's sense of 
autonomy in the face of physical and social losses that accompany age. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am writing you in desperation. My 45-year-old sister was recently 
diagnosed as having diabetes. Somehow, the idea of the illness is driving her 
wild. She's contemplating going to Brazil for some type of cure and is also 
considering using bee secretions and juniper berries, largely ignoring 
conventional medical advice. How can I help her? 
</P>
<P>
A: It is unfortunate that your sister is having such a difficult time accepting 
her illness and is not working with qualified medical personnel to manager her 
diabetes. Diabetes, a condition in which an individual's body is unable to 
convert sugars and starches into usable energy, is incurable. But with 
appropriate medical treatment, it can be managed and the diabetic can resume a 
normal life. 
</P>
<P>
Diet, exercise and either insulin injections or medications taken by mouth are 
the main approaches to treatment of diabetes. Most patients whose diabetes 
starts in their 40s or later can maintain a near-normal blood-sugar level 
without insulin injections. Those who ignore medical advice about diabetes risk 
their lives and jeopardize their health. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, your sister is not alone in her quest for an instant cure. A 
study by the Department of Health and Human Services found that 25% of adults, 
many of them older adults, don't believe traditional medicine offers the most 
effective treatment for serious diseases.

ON YOUR OWN: WHAT DEFINES THE 'SUCCESSFUL' WOMAN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. HOWARD HALPERN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I recently printed a letter from "a successful single woman" of 40 who had 
begun to question her career strivings. She has the income, status, elegant 
apartment, expensive clothes and vacations that come with success, but she 
often asks herself what she has really accomplished. She added: "What is so 
important about increases in my company's sales figures? . . . Am I single 
because I concentrated on my career?" 
</P>
<P>
I asked my women readers to send me their thoughts and reactions to her letter. 
Here are two (I'll print more later) that give much food for thought. 
</P>
<P>
An Indiana woman wrote: 
</P>
<P>
"I am a 30-year-old single woman, well educated, living in my own home and 
supporting myself. After graduating from business school several years ago, I 
took a position with a prestigious Fortune 500 company. I was immediately put 
on the "fast track." I was working 12-hour days and weekends, earning more 
money than I ever imagined and surely was headed for 'success.' 
</P>
<P>
"Despite all this, there was a certain sense of emptiness and loneliness in my 
life. Here, I seemed to have everything but felt that I had nothing. Gradually 
I began to realize that I had forfeited outside interests and relationships in 
favor of my career -- I had chosen a corporate culture that demanded that of 
me. My only source of self-esteem was my career -- what I did was the same 
thing as who I was. 
</P>
<P>
"What changed me? Luckily, one day I was informed I would be 'counseled out' 
because my performance wasn't up to par. I was unemployed for many months. This 
gave me more than enough time to examine my life's priorities and what 
'success' and 'failure' meant to me. 
</P>
<P>
"My life is very different today. I have a job that I enjoy very much, but I 
also take time for myself -- my outside interests, relationships, etc. I guess 
I could sum it up in a word -- balance. My career is important to me, but so is 
my running, my boyfriend (I have time for one now!), friends, etc. That sense 
of disquiet and emptiness has been replaced with intimacy, both with myself and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 'woman-at-home' or 'woman-at-work' dilemma, the pendulum has swung from 
one extreme to the other in two generations. After watching my mother's 
frustration at being a housewife, a career on the 'fast track' seemed to be the 
answer to happiness. Like most things, the answer is probably somewhere in the 
middle." 
</P>
<P>
Similar views were expressed in a letter from a California woman who said that 
wanting to establish her career identity "first" came naturally to her. Her 
mother was a professional, and she had witnessed many women "trapped in unhappy 
marriages because they were so utterly dependent on their husbands." So, by her 
mid-20s she had "a satisfying career in the business world and achieved all the 
trappings of success and power." 
</P>
<P>
However, she recognized two disturbing aspects about herself: 
</P>
<P>
"One was that I was still unhappy. All the success in the world could not make 
up for the satisfaction derived from a true and intimate love in my life. The 
other was that I was losing some aspects of my personality -- the gentle, soft 
and compassionate side. I did not like the self I was becoming. From that point 
on, I decided to keep my life and my personality 'balanced' while maintaining 
an active life in the business world as before. Now, several years later, I am 
very happily married and I like my 'balanced' self much better. 
</P>
<P>
"The task is not easy. The business world still is not the least bit 
sympathetic toward love, family and softness. I have observed many women 
blindly absorb every characteristic of the competitive world and be reduced to 
half a person. They focused only on work, competition and power, instead of 
growing and evolving into a fuller self. I feel sad whenever I see a perfectly 
normal, competent yet feminine woman turning into a hard, unfeeling monster."

ARE THE NEW VET ETHICS KIND TO ANIMALS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How ironic and sad that the animal rights recognition, so late in coming, is 
bringing with it the evil side effect expounded in your article "Vet Ethics" 
(by Allan Parachini, April 26). 
</P>
<P>
I have always felt that the one thing in which animals were more fortunate than 
humans was that they could be painlessly put to sleep when they suffered from 
disease, age or lack of a good home. Now I see that this good luck could come 
to an end. According to your article, the possibility looms that in the future 
animals could be forced to undergo expensive and painful treatments just to 
exist a bit longer, the same as humans. 
</P>
<P>
People who have the kindness, intelligence and courage to do so will no longer 
be allowed to put their pets to sleep painlessly, but will instead have to 
torment them with all manner of therapies, or if they can no longer care for 
them, pass them out to strangers, or the animal shelters, who definitely do not 
screen homes, but give them to anyone who will take them. They can wind up in 
research laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
My worst nightmare would be not to live long 
</P>
<P>
enough to put all my pets, young, old and healthy, to sleep before I die, thus 
making them forever safe. 
</P>
<P>
Those vets ought to rethink their rethinking!

ON GAYS, THE POLICE FORCE, PUBLIC SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congratulations on the thoughtful and moving profile by Bob Sipchen on gay 
ex-LAPD officer Mitchell Grobeson ("A Gay Officer's Lonely Patrol," April 28). 
Mitch's accomplishments and great personal courage are inspiring, and the 
inexcusable abuse he suffered from fellow officers because he is gay is deeply 
disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of patriotic lesbians and gay men serve in our armed forces, and many 
other dedicated lesbian and gay public servants are included in the ranks of 
our local police forces. Thanks to the bigotry that still rules in this 
country, most of these courageous individuals are forced, like Mitch was, to 
hide their lesbian and gay identity from those around them. 
</P>
<P>
That is the personal toll bigotry exacts on our lives. It is society as a whole 
that suffers, however, when bigots are permitted to force people of 
accomplishment like Mitch out of positions of community service. Hopefully, 
through the airing of stories like this in the mainstream press, we can begin 
to overcome the pernicious effects of homophobia on individuals and society at 
large.

I read your feature article called "Car Salesmen Talk of Perils, Precautions," 
by Beverly Beyette (April 21) and noted that one automobile sales manager said, 
"If I was going to steal a car, I wouldn't steal a Hyundai. I'd steal a 
Mercedes." 
</P>
<P>
According to CCC Information Services of Chicago, a car valuation service, the 
top 10 imported cars that were stolen in 1988 included the 1987 Hyundai Excel 
and the 1988 Hyundai. 
</P>
<P>
According to the CCC company, thieves target certain models based largely on 
demand for the cars and their parts. The top 10 domestic cars stolen in 1988 
included the 1980, 1981, and 1984 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. (Reference: Your 
Wheels, Los Angeles Times, April 20)

explained that was a violation of family privacy, so she simply invited them

LONDON'S ANTIQUE FAIRS

Wight. 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One is known simply as the Fair; the other is called the Burlington. 
</P>
<P>
Just about anyone who is anyone on the London antiques scene knows what that 
means: the lustrous 11-day Grosvenor House Antiques Fair on fashionable Park 
Lane in June, and the sparkling nine-day Burlington Fair at the Royal College 
of Art in November. These are the jewels in the crown of the city's antique 
season. 
</P>
<P>
For the price of admission you can browse among the treasures in the 
chandelier-dripping Great Room, the largest ballroom in Europe, at Grosvenor 
House or in the exhibition halls of the Burlington. But if you are thinking of 
buying, you had better have a wad of traveler's checks at hand, for these fairs 
are a far cry from the bargains of the street markets. 
</P>
<P>
The stalls of the street fair may well be loaded with the bric-a-brac of 
granny's attic; the Grosvenor and the Burlington are heavy with the splendors 
of the leading dealers of the British Isles and the Continent. These are the 
kinds of places where you can pick up a set of gold English egg spoons, an 
18th-Century harpsichord or, if your pockets are deep enough, an Old Master. 
</P>
<P>
It's all part of the colorful London antiques scene that, in the words of one 
Paris dealer, has made the city "the antiques mecca of the world." 
</P>
<P>
There really is just about something for everyone, no matter what the taste or 
the pocket, whether it be found in the wealth of antique shops throughout the 
city or in the street markets and covered arcades such as Portobello Road and 
Bermondsey or the Chelsea Antique Market or Camden Passage, which calls itself 
London's antique village. 
</P>
<P>
The Portobello Road Antique Market is London's leading and largest Saturday 
antique market, situated in the borough of Kensington and Chelsea, about a 
15-minute walk from Kensington Palace, the London residence of Prince Charles 
and Lady Diana and Princess Margaret. For many years, dealers, collectors and 
the general public have flocked to Portobello Road to roam the stalls and shops 
that offer an unending source of reasonably priced antiques. 
</P>
<P>
While a development in recent years has been the appearance of the one-day 
antiques fair (usually on a Sunday) at hotels and halls around the city, the 
top of the line remains the multiday fairs, with many of them authenticating 
every item before it is put on display. 
</P>
<P>
It is in June that the quality shows burst upon the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Coming in with the biggest bang of all will be the Fine Art and Antiques Fair 
at Olympia, a great exhibition hall on London's Hammersmith Road. No fewer than 
320 dealers will display their wares, spread through 10,000 square yards of 
space in the Grand Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"The selection of items is simply enormous," says one organizer. "There is a 
choice of everything: furniture, jewelry, toys, paintings, clocks, clothing, 
books, scientific instruments, glass, porcelain." 
</P>
<P>
At one time the fair claimed that the cheapest item was 5 (about $9 U.S.); that 
has been doubled to 10. The highest price is 50,000, usually for a painting or 
a piece of furniture such as a breakfront bookcase. 
</P>
<P>
One of London's specialist fairs, the International Ceramics Fair and Seminar, 
will be in June at the Park Lane Hotel in Piccadilly. The Ceramics Fair is 
avowedly more democratic than the high-glitter Grosvenor and Burlington or even 
the more rambunctious Olympia, with its exclusive invitation lists and 
high-priced preview days. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe in previews," says Ceramics Fair organizer Brian Haughton. 
"We don't have them and never will. We believe that everyone should have the 
same opportunity to view and buy." 
</P>
<P>
The Ceramics Fair is unlike other quality fairs in another respect: It has no 
dateline on articles, the emphasis being on quality rather than antiquity. With 
leading dealers from throughout the British Isles, the Continent and North 
America, the fair concentrates on porcelain, pottery, glass and enamels. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to prices, the Grosvenor House Fair and the Burlington put all 
the other fairs in the shade. A couple of years ago, within two hours of the 
Grosvenor House Fair opening, an inlaid cabinet sold for 1.2 million (about 
$2.16 million). 
</P>
<P>
"I can't give an average price because the range is so wide," says organizer 
Alison Vassiere, "but I can say that an article under 100 is pretty rare." 
</P>
<P>
The Grosvenor House Fair is customarily very much a British affair, with all 90 
dealers being from the United Kingdom. This year, however, because the fair is 
commemorating the 300th anniversary of the accession to the British throne of 
William of Orange and Mary, some members of the Dutch Fine Arts Assn. will be 
exhibiting. The Queen of the Netherlands will also be placing some of her 
personal possessions on exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
Every item on offer at the Grosvenor House Fair is checked for authenticity by 
125 experts from museums and auction houses who serve on 18 committees covering 
silver, furniture, icons, paintings, antiquarian books and bindings, clocks, 
glass, jewelry, Oriental works of art, prints, scientific instruments, 
tapestries and carpets. In the main, the dateline for the articles is 1889; in 
effect, everything must be 100 years or older to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
Now in its 10th year, the West London Antiques Fair scheduled for August in 
Kensington Town Hall will feature almost 90 stands of furniture, all pre-1870, 
with the rest of the items 100 years or older, from 50 ($90 U.S.) to 50,000 
($90,000 U.S.). 
</P>
<P>
This fair, with its accent toward the decorative English country look, is 
organized by Caroline Penman, an antiques figure who runs several fairs 
throughout London and has plans for more. 
</P>
<P>
September brings one of Penman's most popular fairs, the Chelsea Antiques Fair, 
to be held at Chelsea Old Town Hall in London's colorful King's Road. The 
12-day Chelsea is small but prestigious, with only 40 dealers. 
</P>
<P>
The theme of the Chelsea is furniture, and as it has set a dateline of 1830 
that means Georgian and Regency, resulting in quite a different look from other 
furniture fairs that include articles from the Victorian Era. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the furniture are the furnishings -- everything that can be used in 
the home from brass candlesticks to papier-mache tea caddies. The dateline on 
silver and ceramics is 1851, and on paintings, jewelry and carpets, 1887. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scrollwork From Churches 
</P>
<P>
A major piece of furniture at the Chelsea can cost 30,000, but it is possible 
to find good 17th-Century carvings -- scrollwork from churches, paneling from 
homes -- for 100. 
</P>
<P>
The antiques year basically comes to an end in November, when the big event is 
the nine-day Burlington that is held in London every two years, alternating 
with the world-famous Biennale Internationale des Antiquitaires in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
The Burlington is truly international, with dealers exhibiting from throughout 
Europe and the United States. All are leaders in their fields, be it Old 
Masters or fine silver. 
</P>
<P>
Says organizer Gillian Craig: "Members of the Royal Family who are among our 
patrons will be lending some of their private collections for public exhibition 
for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
November also brings the City of London Antiques Fair at the Barbican, the 
massive concrete music and exhibition hall in the eastern section of the city. 
</P>
<P>
A big fair with 140 stands, its furniture dateline is set at 1850. In 
combination with the fair will be the City of London International Art Fair, 
with 100 dealers in watercolors and oils. With no dateline, works of art could 
be modern or 19th Century.

ANSWERING CANADA'S CALL OF THE WILD ON A VOYAGE THROUGH THE WILDERNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
SANDSPIT, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Above the stream flowing into the Pacific Ocean, the majestic bald eagle 
circled lazily, its outstretched wings barely moving. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, in a single movement, the bird swooped down, hardly broke the surface 
of the water, seized a salmon in its talons and rose triumphantly. Before 
disappearing, the eagle turned and flew over its awe-struck audience as if to 
show off its kill. 
</P>
<P>
At the foot of a high cliff, relentless breakers pounded the rocky shore. Above 
the roar of the surf came the cries of a family of eagles wheeling far above on 
the wind currents swirling around the cliff. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unforgettable Images 
</P>
<P>
These were two unforgettable images in a 10-day sailboat voyage through the 
South Moresby wilderness of the Queen Charlotte Islands, 62 miles off British 
Columbia. Known as Canada's Galapagos, the area is protected as a national park 
reserve. 
</P>
<P>
By sailboat, South Moresby can be seen much as the Haida Indians see it. Once 
south of Sandspit you enter an area without roads, communities, facilities or 
services, a true wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
Sailing in South Moresby means anchoring at whim, putting a canoe over the 
side, paddling ashore and exploring for hours. 
</P>
<P>
Take the Bischof Islands, a group of tiny islets at the head of Juan Perez 
Sound. Beach the canoes and climb over the rocks. A red-billed black oyster 
catcher scarcely notices as he sits on a nearby rock. A placid tidal pool 
covers dozens of brilliant red sea urchins and an octopus scuttles under a rock 
as its solitude is broken. 
</P>
<P>
On a ridge perfectly sited between two beaches, an old weathered hammock 
sagging between two trees is still strong enough to support an after-lunch 
siesta. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago a hermit called Butterfly Ron decided this was the place to get 
away from it all. In the bushes is his old bathtub and a beautifully shaped 
piece of driftwood that formed an elegant toilet seat. 
</P>
<P>
Butterfly Ron used to make his own beer. When unsuspecting visitors came ashore 
on what they thought was a deserted island, he would jump out from behind a 
tree and offer a cold one. 
</P>
<P>
Close to the Bischof Islands is Hotspring Island. The springs bubble out of the 
ground near the highest point of this tiny island and fill the pools maintained 
by the Haida. One pool is covered by a hut and there you can soap away in 
privacy. The other open pools offer a more communal form of relaxation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Untouched Rain Forest 
</P>
<P>
North of Hotspring is Lyell Island, which contains Windy Bay watershed. Windy 
Bay symbolizes the struggle to preserve South Moresby and contains one of the 
last untouched stands of rain forest in the Charlottes. 
</P>
<P>
No neat footpaths weave through the woods of Windy Bay. Instead, walk is on a 
springy carpet of thick moss that covers the forest floor. 
</P>
<P>
Moss covers everything like a mantle of gentle green snow, from the smallest 
twigs to the rocks in the creek. It softly rounds the trees that have fallen 
over the years so that it is impossible to tell exactly what is beneath the 
moss. 
</P>
<P>
Giant cedars tower straight and true, living things that are hundreds of years 
old. Some soar for more than 100 feet before a branch occurs. 
</P>
<P>
Even the trees that have fallen to the forest floor over the centuries are not 
really dead. Ferns sprout from their exposed roots and the moss-covered trunks 
act as "nurse logs" to the seeds that fall and take root, sending up new trees. 
Other living trees wear a shaggy overcoat of moss from which spring small 
plants and grasses. 
</P>
<P>
At the extreme southern tip of South Moresby is Kunghit Island, and on its 
northern shore, on Houston Stewart Channel, is Rose Harbour, the site of an old 
whaling station deserted in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
This channel is reputed to be one of the best places on the Pacific Coast to 
view whales, though we had only a glimpse of one. 
</P>
<P>
From Rose Harbour it is a short sail to Anthony Island and the remains of the 
village of Ninstints, the most isolated of all Haida villages and designated a 
United Nations World Heritage cultural site. 
</P>
<P>
A visit to this remote village is a high point of any trip to the Queen 
Charlotte Islands, for it is here that the spirit of the people who inhabited 
these islands for centuries remains the strongest. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Island is exposed to the open Pacific, but Ninstints occupies a 
sheltered site with a single approach on its lee side. 
</P>
<P>
To reach the village you paddle ashore through a cleared channel in the rocks. 
Above the beach stand the gray, weathered totem poles raised by the Haida more 
than 150 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the best poles have been removed over the years; some are in the Museum 
of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
The poles are more visible now than they were a few years ago when the growth 
of the forest threatened to swallow them up. Trees that sprouted between the 
poles have been felled and the weeds on the poles removed. 
</P>
<P>
Remaining poles offer a dramatic impact, with the images of Eagle, Bear and 
Raven glaring out as fiercely as when they were carved by the skilled Haida.

DINING OUT: A MOVABLE FEAST RIGHT ON A CANAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL LASLEY and ELIZABETH HARRYMAN, Lasley and Harryman are Beverly Hills 
free-lance writers. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
FT. LAUDERDALE, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The late afternoon sun glinted on the water as we sped along the canals of Ft. 
Lauderdale in our water taxi on the way to dinner. We passed pastel-colored 
homes with louvered windows and manicured yards dotted with palms. 
</P>
<P>
It was nearly dusk when our boat pulled up to the dock at Stan's restaurant; 
tiny white Tivoli lights glowed along the railing. Lou Vassaluzzo, the tuxedoed 
maitre d', ushered us to an upstairs room, with a polished oak bar at one end 
and floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Intracoastal Waterway. 
</P>
<P>
We watched sleek white yachts ply the canal as we ate an appetizer of fresh 
Florida stone crab claws, served cold with a piquant, Key lime/honey-mustard 
sauce. Next came a Caesar salad with anchovies, followed by fresh grouper, a 
firm and flavorful fish. It had been sauteed and was served with shrimp and 
mussels in a white wine cream sauce. 
</P>
<P>
For dessert we tried a South Florida specialty -- Key lime pie. To be 
authentic, the pie must be made with the small Florida Keys limes, known for 
their intense flavor. The pie traditionally is made with a graham cracker 
crust, and opinions vary on whether the topping should be whipped cream or 
meringue. Stan's version was smooth in texture, with a strong taste of lime and 
topped with whipped cream. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Upstairs, Downstairs 
</P>
<P>
By the time we were finishing our coffee a quartet was playing on a small stage 
as couples danced. Entrees at Stan's cost $17 to $23 and include Caesar salad. 
Appetizers and desserts are $3-$4, except for some of the fresh seafood, which 
is priced daily. (Four large crab claws, for example, were $13.50.) The same 
menu is available upstairs as well as downstairs, but the downstairs room is 
more informal. 
</P>
<P>
Many good restaurants line the Ft. Lauderdale canals. The best way to visit 
them is by water taxi. Also, it's often the most convenient way. And the $2.50 
fare generally will be less than the cost of a cab from your hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the most popular waterside restaurant is Shooters on the Water. 
Started seven years ago by four yachtsmen who wanted a place where boaters 
could tie up and dine casually, the restaurant has become the prime watering 
hole for the college crowd. Shooters has valet parking for boats. During 
cocktail hour, yachts are often lined six deep in front of the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
You can dine inside, where people crowd around a central bar, or outdoors by 
the side of the waterway or around the restaurant's swimming pool. Shooters is 
more for the experience than the cuisine, but best bets are such fresh-caught 
fish as snapper, grouper, swordfish and tuna ($10-$15), or thick hamburgers 
served on poppyseed Kaiser rolls ($4.95). 
</P>
<P>
Conch fritters are a local appetizer -- meat from Bahamian conch shells is 
mixed with chopped onion, green pepper, jalapeno pepper and beer, formed into 
balls and deep-fried ($3.95). The Key lime pie ($3.95) here was too heavy and 
gelatinous. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Novelistic Setting 
</P>
<P>
Two other casual waterside restaurants are near Shooters. To the south is the 
Bootlegger, used as the setting for Elmore Leonard's novel, "The Stick." 
Specialties at this open-air restaurant are barbecued baby back ribs ($12.95) 
and sandwiches of mesquite-grilled chicken on a Kaiser roll ($5.95). 
</P>
<P>
To the north is Durty Nelly's, where the movie version of "The Stick" was 
filmed, because the Bootlegger had been remodeled. Durty Nelly's retains a 
suitably funky atmosphere, with wooden floors and old wooden tables and 
benches. Big, gooey sandwiches of roast pork or steak with green pepper and 
onions are served for under $4. 
</P>
<P>
A more formal restaurant in the same area is Charley's Crab. Fresh seafoods are 
served in a cool, sedate setting. Prices for entrees are $15 to $28 at dinner, 
$10 to $17 at lunch. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fashionable Tastes 
</P>
<P>
Down the Intracoastal Waterway near Port Everglades, Pier 66 Resort and Marina 
has several restaurants. On the water is Cafe 66, a sleek, trendy restaurant 
with an outside deck overlooking the marina. 
</P>
<P>
We dined there one warm evening while music from a live rock band blared from 
inside. A Caesar salad came with fresh shrimp and pecans that added a nice, 
slightly sweet flavor to the tartness of the Caesar dressing. 
</P>
<P>
Grilled tuna was served with a cilantro butter, and red peppers, carrots, 
zucchini strips and red cabbage which had been lightly sauteed. Entrees cost 
$15-$19. Gourmet pizzas are a specialty at $10.95. On the pier at Pier 66 is 
the Pelican Bar, a little sandwich shop serving hot dogs and hamburgers for 
$2.95-$4.95. 
</P>
<P>
Just across the heavily trafficked Stranahan River is the 15th Street Fisheries 
restaurant and marina. Wooden plank boards line the walls, and long sheets of 
white paper serve as tablecloths. It's not fancy, but the fish is fresh and 
simply prepared. 
</P>
<P>
We sat on stools around a high table and watched pelicans perch on poles 
outside the window as we tried an appetizer of fish fingers ($4.50) -- pieces 
of grouper, deep-fried in a light batter and not overly greasy. A salad of 
fresh greens was served with a house dressing, and mesquite-grilled dolphin 
($8.95) had a firm, smooth texture and great flavor. The vegetables were fresh, 
but overcooked; better to stick with the French fries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Postprandial Stroll 
</P>
<P>
Up the New River, water taxis stop at the Riverside Hotel, where sandwiches and 
salads are served in the "620" restaurant for $5-$6. Dinners of fresh seafood 
and steaks are served in Le Cafe International for $10-$16. 
</P>
<P>
From the hotel you can stroll along Las Olas Boulevard, with its many shops and 
new restaurants. Las Olas Patisserie makes a great breakfast stop. Flaky, 
buttery croissants sell for $1.29, and owner/baker Scott Schwaner's winter 
fruit cake, a yellow cake with butter cream icing, topped with strawberries and 
kiwi ($3.50 a slice), is heavenly. Soups and croissant sandwiches are served at 
lunchtime. 
</P>
<P>
Also along the boulevard is Au Bain Marie where you can buy a variety of pates, 
cheeses and salads for a picnic. Boxed lunches are $3.40-$4.50. The two best 
restaurants in Ft. Lauderdale are also accessible by water taxi -- The Down 
Under and Casa Vecchia. 
</P>
<P>
Opened in 1968, The Down Under is a fantasy of art nouveau furniture, high 
ceilings and hanging plants. Chef Gerald Smith features such local specialties 
as Florida red snapper, stone crabs and pompano -- a sweet, delicate white fish 
-- as well as such foreign-influenced dishes as confit de canard and chicken 
curry. 
</P>
<P>
For dessert, a smooth almond orange cake and a rich, dark-chocolate mousse are 
standouts. The Key lime pie here was the best we'd had -- light, delicately 
flavored with lime and topped with perfectly finished meringue. Dinners cost 
about $50 per person, lunches $8-$16. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Romantic Evenings 
</P>
<P>
Casa Vecchia, featuring northern Italian cuisine, is one of the most romantic 
restaurants anywhere. In a house built in 1937 as a honeymoon home for a member 
of the Pond's cold cream dynasty, it overlooks the Intracoastal Waterway. 
Inside, dining alcoves are furnished with antiques and decorated with an 
eclectic mix of oil paintings, Oriental carpets, hand-carved woodwork and 
chandeliers of Venetian glass. 
</P>
<P>
We began with an appetizer of escargots in a green peppercorn sauce. The snails 
were tender, and the slightly spicy sauce was a pleasant change from the 
traditional garlic butter. 
</P>
<P>
Next came house-made linguine in a pesto sauce of fresh basil, surrounded by 
large chunks of blue crab and topped with a fresh tomato fondue. For dessert we 
tried the cannoli. This version of the traditional Italian pastry was a 
cylinder of light, flaky pastry with a rich cheese filling, lightly flavored 
with orange. Dinners at Casa Vecchia cost about $50 per person, excluding wine.

<P>
Two water cab companies -- Canal Cab, (305) 527-1600, and Water Taxi of Ft. 
Lauderdale, (305) 565-5507 -- offer transportation to the restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Both companies operate from about 10 a.m. to 2 a.m., but will start earlier if 
requested. While it's best to call about 20 minutes ahead of your desired 
pickup time, it's also possible to hail a passing cab from the pier. The fare 
is $2.50, one way, to anywhere on the city's waterways.

SUPPORT BUILDS FOR SPECIAL VOTE IN S. PASADENA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sentiment favoring a special election to fill the vacancy left by the death 
last month of Councilman Joseph Crosby appears to be growing among civic 
leaders, despite some support for the appointment of an unsuccessful candidate 
in last year's election. 
</P>
<P>
The four remaining members of the council must, by May 19, appoint someone to 
fill Crosby's seat for the next three years, set an election date for the seat 
or appoint a temporary council member until an election can be held. 
</P>
<P>
Crosby, 69, died of cancer on April 19. According to City Manager John 
Bernardi, his death came just as his council colleagues were meeting to select 
a new leadership team. Crosby was selected by his colleagues to be mayor pro 
tem. Longtime council member Sam Knowles was selected as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
According to city officials, supporters of retired contractor Frank Novarro's 
council candidacy last year are militating for his appointment to fill Crosby's 
seat. Novarro came in third in the election, in which Crosby and Evelyn Fierro 
were elected to fill two vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pro-Business Candidate 
</P>
<P>
Novarro ran on a pro-business platform, suggesting that South Pasadena should 
seek to attract revenue-producing businesses as a long-range solution for the 
city's fiscal problems. 
</P>
<P>
But others, such as former Councilwoman Helen Simmons, are pressing for an 
election. Simmons said the new council member should reflect a burgeoning 
slow-growth sentiment in the city. "I want somebody in there who's 
representative of the current feelings of the voters of this city," Simmons 
said. "I think that over the past year feelings have been changing." 
</P>
<P>
The election option appears to have significant support among council members. 
"I think we've informally agreed that an appointee would have to be someone all 
four of us can live with," Fierro said. "I just don't see four votes there for 
Novarro. I think ultimately we'll have a special election." 
</P>
<P>
Knowles said there were "pluses and minuses" for all options. "If we wait for 
an election, we'll be operating essentially short-handed for a period of time," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Election Options 
</P>
<P>
City Clerk Ruby Kerr said the earliest that a special election could be 
scheduled would be in the middle of July. A June election on an education bond 
issue is too close to include a vote on the vacant council seat, she said. The 
next regularly scheduled election after that is a school board election set for 
November, Kerr added. 
</P>
<P>
A major concern about scheduling a special election is the cost to the city. 
"The last general municipal election we held cost $14,000," Kerr said. 
"Everything seems to be going up (in cost) very fast." She estimated that a 
special election, before the school board election, could cost the city more 
than $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Code Requirements 
</P>
<P>
The State Government Code requires that the council decide how a seat will be 
filled within 30 days of the vacancy having occurred. The council has placed 
the matter on the agenda for its regularly scheduled meeting on May 17. 
</P>
<P>
The sudden vacancy may signal the emergence of controversial former Councilman 
Robert Wagner, largely absent from the South Pasadena scene in the past year, 
as a force in city politics. 
</P>
<P>
A letter published in The Times on Thursday urged the council to hold an 
election rather than make an appointment, claiming that such a choice would 
"adhere to the democratic process." The letter was signed by former Mayor John 
L. Sullivan, former council members L. L. Balk and Helen E. Simmons, and former 
Planning Commission Chairman Alfred Chaix Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Balk said this week that it was his understanding that Wagner, who did not sign 
the letter, had written much of it. "I think he didn't sign it because he 
eventually wants to run again himself," Balk said. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner denied that he had written the letter and that he was interested in 
filling Crosby's seat. "Somebody who was circulating the letter asked me to get 
Balk's support," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he was not interested in running again for the council, unless 
there were a draft from "prominent citizens." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Out of Local Politics 
</P>
<P>
Wagner, 66, is a senior senator representing Los Angeles County in the 
California Senior Legislature, an advocacy group that meets annually in 
Sacramento to draft bills on behalf of senior citizens, and a leader in 
celebrations marking the Georgetown University bicentennial. Wagner said he had 
been too busy recently to concern himself with local politics. "I haven't given 
it a thought," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since Wagner declined to run for a second term last April, the council has 
operated harmoniously, closing ranks against state plans to complete the Long 
Beach Freeway along a downtown corridor. 
</P>
<P>
Crosby had lived in South Pasadena for more than 50 years. He had served for 
nine years on the Planning Commission. He had recently retired as president of 
the California Liquid Fertilizer Co. in Pasadena and was a director of First 
American Bank. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe was a very dedicated councilman, a political volunteer for many years, and 
he was a close and cherished friend," said Knowles. "He certainly will be 
missed."

A QUEEN AT 3; 
</P>
<P>
COMMERCE GIRL POSSESSES POISE BEYOND HER YEARS

<P>
The 3-year-old beauty queen was on the living room floor, her eyes fixed on the 
television screen as a videotape of her victories rolled. 
</P>
<P>
When it ended, Brandi Nichele Alvarez rose with a smile and walked across the 
room. Because she is shy and young, she did not talk about the two beauty 
contests she has won, nor did she mention the six- and seven-foot trophies, the 
$75, the rabbit fur coat, the six-inch television set, several decorative 
crowns and the "Talking Mother Goose." She has also won the right to compete 
for the Miss American Beauty Pageants' national title this summer in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
But John Alvarez tells a story that reveals some of his daughter's thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
"There was one time we called her princess and she said 'I'm not a princess. 
I'm a queen,' and then she starts to laugh," said Alvarez, 27, a bartender and 
long-time Commerce resident. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez and his wife, Nancy, hope the beauty contests eventually will lead to 
parts in television commercials and perhaps a modeling career when Brandi grows 
up. But they say it is too early to tell whether Brandi will be successful or 
happy in that role. "I'd like to see her be a performer," Alvarez said. "We'll 
just guide her and let her make her own decision." 
</P>
<P>
The young queen smiles easily but is quiet. She is petite with round dark eyes, 
long lashes and auburn hair. Brandi likes to look at books and sing when she is 
at home. Her mother said Brandi is trying to learn the words to "Over the 
Rainbow." Her parents say she has plenty of "ham" in her, that she has always 
enjoyed dressing up and being in front of a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Brandi has long drawn the compliments of admiring adults. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to this Tupperware party and this girl told me I should put her in a 
baby contest," her mother said. "I had to hold her (during the contest). She 
was about six months old." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Brandi competed only in city-sponsored baby contests. She won first 
place for the longest eyelashes in 1986, an award for cutest nose in 1987, and 
another for longest eyelashes in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the Christmas Wonderland Beauty Pageant last December at the Park 
Hotel in Anaheim. The event was sponsored by Miss American Beauty Pageants of 
West Covina. Miss American stages preliminary pageants throughout California 
and in 15 other states leading up to its national contest, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Brandi won the overall title for 3-year-olds and an award for having the 
prettiest eyes. She competed against 10 other girls. 
</P>
<P>
"When she won we both looked at each other and didn't know what to say," said 
Nancy Alvarez, a cashier at a fast-food restaurant. "I was shaking." 
</P>
<P>
Brandi possesses ability and poise beyond her years. She flashed a little smile 
and appeared to be at ease as she walked down the runway. A petticoat filled 
out her pink and white dress. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no problem with her going up on stage or before people," her mother 
said. "She's not afraid." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Preparation 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Alvarez said she did little to prepare her child for the December 
contest. But for the second one, Brandi studied the tape from her first victory 
to see how some of the more experienced girls moved. 
</P>
<P>
"She kept watching and watching it," her mother said. "I kept showing her, 
'See, that's how you stand.' " 
</P>
<P>
Brandi swept every category she entered in the Valentine Sweetheart Pageant in 
Anaheim in February, taking home overall honors for 3-year-olds. She competed 
against 11 other girls. 
</P>
<P>
But the mini-beauty queen has only just begun. The Alvarezes, proud and still a 
little surprised by their daughter's success, say they plan to keep entering 
her in contests. 
</P>
<P>
The Alvarezes, who have three other children, say they are careful not to 
pressure their daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't push her. Some of the parents get on their daughters," Nancy Alvarez 
said. "If she wins, she wins. She likes being with the girls and getting 
dressed up." 
</P>
<P>
Some of Brandi's showmanship qualities surfaced last week during activities at 
her day-care center at the city's Rosewood Park. The instructor taught the 
3-year-olds a step to a Mexican folk dance. 
</P>
<P>
After Brandi performed a rough rendition, she smiled and took several bows. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Classmates Don't Notice 
</P>
<P>
Her beauty goes virtually unnoticed by her classmates. "They're still a little 
too young for that," day-care instructor Mary Anne Griego said. And Brandi 
takes part in the usual childhood antics -- a young boy turned his hands into 
the shape of a gun and shot at Brandi. She returned fire. 
</P>
<P>
The Alvarezes say they are mindful of the pitfalls that accompany beauty. 
</P>
<P>
"She hasn't changed at all," John Alvarez said. "We've noticed no change. We 
hope there won't be." 
</P>
<P>
So Las Vegas, with all its glamour, awaits the young beauty queen who has a 
knack for charming a crowd. She has been practicing her walk in the family 
living room, and her mother plans to buy her a new pageant dress. The 
competition is expected to be stiff, but Brandi seems unworried. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she thought she would win, Brandi nodded her head, smiled and said in 
the tiniest of voices, "yeah."

SPECIAL YOUNGSTERS SHARE JOY, BEAT OBSTACLES AT TRACK MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The emphasis was on overcoming obstacles, not winning ribbons. Just being 
there, running and jumping with abandon on that pylon-littered grass field in 
Lakewood, seemed enough for the 400 retarded youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
Their joy, from the time they warmed up with wild arm-flailing versions of 
jumping jacks, was uncontainable. 
</P>
<P>
The team from Mayfair High, one of 19 schools represented at the Melbourne 
School for the Trainable Mentally Retarded's 16th annual track meet Thursday, 
looked sharp in blue T-shirts. It was ready. Victor Guitierrez and Ramon 
Fernandez, both 15, engaged in a flurry of high-fives and patted each other's 
cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
One of the Mayfair members loosening up had the look of an athlete and the 
admiration of his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm doin' good, how you doin'?" said Jess Porter, 19, tall, lean and autistic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I'm Ready to Run' 
</P>
<P>
"Jess is the best runner," said Tim Kennedy, 18. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm ready to run," said Porter, "if I have the time." 
</P>
<P>
A band played the Flintstones theme and the "Hokey Pokey." Guitierrez ate a 
rapidly melting chocolate bar, despite warnings from his teachers that his 
waistline would be further expanded. 
</P>
<P>
Then he went right out and shined in the sun: He jumped 4 feet 8 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the participants, who ranged in age from 3 to 21, are also physically 
impaired. But all were required to compete in each of the events -- shuttle 
run, long jump, soccer dribble, batting, obstacle course, Frisbee throw, basket 
toss and marathon. 
</P>
<P>
Youngsters aimed a Frisbee at Hula Hoops affixed to a chain-link fence. Landing 
the disc inside a hoop was worth one, three or five points. Some sailed high 
over the fence, landing on a blacktop playground. But Mayfair's Juan Varela, 
18, nailed the five ring with consistency. "Good job, Juan," praised the 
volunteer officials, and Varela's day was made. 
</P>
<P>
The reward for Mary Crowley, an adapted physical education specialist and meet 
coordinator, will hopefully come, she said, this summer when Varela, using this 
skill he has learned, plays with a Frisbee at home. 
</P>
<P>
The soccer dribble presented a problem for those in wheelchairs. So while being 
pushed by a volunteer, they used a hockey stick instead of their feet to nudge 
a ball around three pylons on a 25-foot-long course. 
</P>
<P>
With a well-muscled left arm, Greg Morton, 19, a deaf student at Pace School in 
Bellflower, worked his stick. Smiling all the way, he gave the ball a last 
solid tap and was applauding by the time he reached the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Students Spurred On 
</P>
<P>
At the shuttle run, the students, spurred on by Wendy Purvine, the event's 
volunteer chairwoman, ran without regard to their lack of coordination. 
</P>
<P>
"Run, run, run, run, run!" urged Purvine, and Marlena Ruffin, 10, of the 
Mendenhall School in Garden Grove, took off toward a pylon 30 yards away. 
Surprisingly, she stopped when she reached the pylon, returning only when she 
heard cries of "Come back, come back." 
</P>
<P>
"They look like they don't understand anything," Purvine said. "But they know . 
. . and they love every minute of it. This is their chance." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Hill, 16, of Pace School, despite unfluid legs, threatened to run out from 
under the helmet he has to wear because he sometimes has seizures. 
</P>
<P>
"Faster, faster, faster, faster!" Purvine shouted as Joe touched the pylon and 
started back. He pounded over the grass, kicking up the sand beneath it, and 
crossed the finish line with a happiness that was almost unbearable -- to him 
and those who watched him. 
</P>
<P>
He sat down and was given a drink of water by his proud sister, Tina Albritton, 
who said, "He's been excited about this since 6 this morning." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nine Shots in a Row 
</P>
<P>
Over at the basket toss, Wendy Wheeler, 17, of the Columbus School in Downey, 
stood a few feet from a can and with an underhand delivery made nine shots in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
As the youngsters waited to be escorted to their next event, they would talk 
excitedly: "I beat you. . . . " "Did you see me?" "What are we going to do 
next?" 
</P>
<P>
Jess Porter was doing very well. He jumped 7 feet 6 inches. And he ran like a 
gazelle, easily outdistancing his competitors. 
</P>
<P>
At the batting station, a whiffle ball was set atop a tee and the batters aimed 
at a fence that had numbers attached. Porter swung hard on his first attempt 
but sent the tee, not the ball, against the fence. He settled down and ripped 
several line drives. 
</P>
<P>
"I got 14 points," he said. "I tried but couldn't hit one over the fence." 
</P>
<P>
A volunteer asked him, "How's high school going? Any cute girls?" 
</P>
<P>
"Well, some of them," Porter said. 
</P>
<P>
As someone told him how handsome he looked with his new teeth braces, he waited 
with hands on hips for the basket toss. He tossed ball after ball into a can. 
</P>
<P>
"Jess Abdul-Jabbar," a teacher said. 
</P>
<P>
No praise could have been greater. 
</P>
<P>
Porter turned to leave, not smiling but with his head held high. Softly, he 
repeated those magic words, "Jess Abdul-Jabbar."

PEERLESS PORKER;

<P>
LIBRARIAN SINGS PRAISES OF FICTIONAL FRIEND FREDDY, A PIG OF MANY TALENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To Michael Cart, Freddy is "the pig o' my heart." 
</P>
<P>
Freddy isn't a live porker, but a fictional pig who talks and types and writes 
doggerel. And Cart, the 48-year-old director of the Beverly Hills Public 
Library, is president of the Friends of Freddy, an international league of men, 
women and children shamelessly stuck on the porcine hero of 26 children's books 
written by the late Walter R. Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could claim credit for founding the Friends of Freddy since I've been 
a friend of Freddy since I was 7 years old," Cart said. But that distinction 
goes to Canadian playwright Dan Carley, who formed the group in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Today the society of Freddyphiles has more than 200 members who receive a 
quarterly newsletter, hold Freddyfests and work tirelessly, Cart says, "to 
spread Freddy's name and fame throughout the known universe." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Encounter 
</P>
<P>
Cart first encountered the "peerless porker," as he has been known to call 
Freddy, in third grade while growing up in Logansport, Ind. Cart's reader 
contained an excerpt from the first Freddy adventure, "To and Again," published 
in 1927. Later, "as luck or fate or God would have it," Cart discovered the 
whole book, along with subsequent tales of Freddy, on a shelf at his public 
library. "The rest," he said, "is history." 
</P>
<P>
In Freddy's day he was an extremely popular pig. Cart, who is writing a 
critical biography of Brooks, says 340,000 copies of the Freddy books were sold 
before Brooks died in 1958. In addition to books for children, Brooks wrote 
novels and short stories for adults, including a series featuring a talking 
horse named Ed, called Mr. Ed on television. 
</P>
<P>
Freddy fanatics dependent on the public library for their fixes sometimes 
resorted to desperate measures. Friends founder Dan Carley confessed in an 
interview at the 1988 Freddyfest how he and his older brother worked their 
hometown public library together. "He was really strong," Carley said of his 
sibling, "so when the children's section of the library opened, he'd hold all 
the kids back while I ran in. I was well-coached as to which titles to get. 
Finally, we were slapped with a two-Freddy-books-a-week quota." 
</P>
<P>
The books were aimed at elementary schoolchildren, but Freddy fans clung to 
them long after their voices had changed. Brooks never wrote down to his young 
readers, Cart says, and the stories are very funny and characterized by 
wonderful wordplay. 
</P>
<P>
To a child who was "literary" (rather like Freddy himself), the books were 
filled with verbal delights. Cart learned the meaning of the word 
sesquipedalianism, the big word that means using big words, from Brooks. "I ran 
to the dictionary many times when I was reading the Freddy books," Cart 
recalls. 
</P>
<P>
The books present an idyllic view of rural American life, Cart says, but their 
main magic, he believes, is their protagonist. 
</P>
<P>
"Freddy," Cart argues, "was a pig of many parts: poet, playwright, Pied Piper, 
pilot, politician . . . detective, newspaper editor, banker, magician, cowboy, 
peripatetic adventurer and, always, a friend -- to both his fictional 
counterparts who lived with him on the Bean Farm in Upstate New York and to 
devoted readers like me who lived with him only in their imaginations." 
</P>
<P>
As a student of Freddy as well as an enthusiast, Cart is convinced that Freddy 
was Brooks' alter ego. "Their emotional provenance," Cart says of the books, 
"was clearly that of Brooks' childhood." 
</P>
<P>
Cart too saw himself in the pig, "with his occasional bouts of hubris and 
vanity, which were always punctured." Freddy, he added, "was the way I wanted 
to be in terms of his virtues. My God, how I wanted to have a friend like 
Freddy! If I couldn't, I determined at an early age, I would be the kind of 
friend to other people Freddy always was."

Perhaps most important, the Freddy books allowed Cart to escape, if only for a 
time, from the sometimes suffocating world of childhood. "The Freddy books were 
a source of spiritual nourishment," he said. "They were a sanctuary and a 
refuge for me. Brooks had created a parallel universe, so that when things got 
tough in Indiana I could go off to the Bean Farm, where the quality of life was 
a little better." 
</P>
<P>
The first two Freddyfests were held near Roxbury, N.Y., in the Catskill 
Mountains where Brooks lived during his last years. His widow, Dorothy, who 
read the Freddy books aloud to Brooks in the months before he died, has 
welcomed the convening Friends into their home. Cart has even slept in Brooks' 
bed. He also has the ancient Corona portable on which the pig was born. 
</P>
<P>
A high point of the 1988 convention, Cart says, was the presentation of an 
endowment of $1,500 in Brooks' memory to the Roxbury Public Library. The income 
will be used to buy children's books. The third convention will be held in 1990 
at a place yet to be decided. 
</P>
<P>
When the friends of Freddy gather, they ponder such mysteries as why the Freddy 
books are no longer widely read and why the charismatic pig is not as famous as 
Uncle Wiggily or Babar. There are those who think Brooks influenced George 
Orwell's "Animal Farm" and E. B. White's conception of the pig Wilbur in 
"Charlotte's Web." 
</P>
<P>
Yet all but one of the Freddy books was out of print until, at the urging of 
the Friends, Alfred A. Knopf reissued eight of the titles in 1986, with an 
introduction by Michael Cart. The books did not sell particularly well, much to 
the chagrin of the Friends, and additional titles are in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Nor has Freddy gone the animation route, despite the elegant illustrations Kurt 
Wiese did for the series. Hanna-Barbera had an option on Freddy, which it 
dropped. ABC now has an option on the stories but no current plans to turn them 
into Saturday-morning cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
Children who can find the books love them still, Cart says, "even Beverly Hills 
kids." The Beverly Hills Public Library has an almost complete set, and they 
circulate very well, he reports. "Chris Olson, the supervisor of children's 
services, regularly brings children into my office to see my Freddy collection 
and the famous typewriter." 
</P>
<P>
Cart is so fond of Freddy that he is willing to look a little foolish in his 
service. Co-producer and host of a weekly cable TV show on books and authors 
called "In Print," Cart makes no apologies for his unusual enthusiasm. Books 
matter, he believes, especially Freddy's. 
</P>
<P>
As to why, Cart cites the observation Brian Alderson, children's book editor of 
the London Times, once made to him. "Books are only important," Alderson said, 
"if you consider literature to be important. And literature is only important 
if you consider civilization to be important."

'SLOW-MOTION DEMOLITION'; 
</P>
<P>
RUSH TO BUILD DOOMS OLD HOLLYWOOD HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although he often talked of moving from the two-story, turn-of-the-century 
ranch house he has rented for six years, there was something about the place 
that made Paul Gordon want to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Once surrounded by citrus orchards that covered much of Hollywood, the house at 
5552 Carlton Way, built by one of Hollywood's early developers, is a relic 
encircled by apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Forced to Leave 
</P>
<P>
And even though the floors creak and the wind howls through the eaves, Gordon, 
a writer, and his wife, Donna Williams, a sculptor, say they would gladly stay 
if they weren't being forced to leave. 
</P>
<P>
After watching their neighbors move out one at a time, when a developer began 
buying up homes in order to demolish them and build apartment buildings, Gordon 
and Williams got their eviction notice last October. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Gordon says the neighborhood has been "caught up in a kind of 
slow-motion demolition" as transients have occupied vacant houses awaiting the 
wrecking crew. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Couldn't Refuse' 
</P>
<P>
"It was a shock, because the man who owned (our) house is a preservationist in 
his own right," Gordon said. "He called to tell me the news one day, saying he 
and his partner had simply been offered a price they couldn't refuse." 
</P>
<P>
The seller, landscape architect Ed Hunt, said the decision to sell the house 
was made by his partner "as part of an understanding we had that, if either of 
us wanted to sell, the other would go along." 
</P>
<P>
The new owner, Diversified Income Properties Inc. of Century City, went to 
court to have Gordon and Williams evicted, and last week they agreed to vacate 
the house in July. The company also bought the house next door and two others 
behind it that face another street. 
</P>
<P>
Later this month, the city's Cultural Heritage Commission is to decide whether 
to designate Gordon's house as an historic landmark. Such a designation would 
serve only to protect the property from demolition for up to six months, 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a nonprofit corporation headed by preservationist William Delvac has 
entered into talks with the development company in an effort to buy the house 
and save it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're keeping our fingers crossed that something can be worked out. We feel 
like we've done all we can do," Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
Although eager to see the house saved from demolition, he and his wife say it 
is too late to remedy much of the damage the neighborhood has suffered. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Under Siege' 
</P>
<P>
"We feel like we've been under siege here," he said. "Most of our little 
neighborhood has disappeared before our eyes." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a block-long row of single-family homes on Carlton Way was bulldozed 
to expand Grant Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
In the last several months, he and others say that four homes purchased by the 
development company have been torn down. The Department of Building and Safety 
halted demolition of four others, after preservationists complained that the 
demolition permits were not in order. Several calls to Diversified Income 
Properties officials were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
As families have been uprooted, the pattern of life in Gordon's block has 
changed dramatically, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife recall when children sneaked up their driveway at night to 
stare wide-eyed at the old rancho in the belief that it was haunted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Neighborhood Gone' 
</P>
<P>
"Now," Gordon said, "those children are gone. Just look around, a lot of the 
neighborhood is gone. 
</P>
<P>
"Even in a community such as Hollywood, where people are accustomed to change, 
it got to be a bit much." 
</P>
<P>
Although there are fences around the abandoned houses, transients cut through 
them in short order. 
</P>
<P>
Doors and windows have been torn off. Walls and cabinets are punched full of 
holes, and what were once well-kempt yards are dotted with piles of trash and 
debris. 
</P>
<P>
Broken liquor bottles, excrement and clumps of discarded clothing fill the 
parlor of the bungalow next door to Gordon, where just a few months ago a 
friend, who is a part-time actor, lived with his family. 
</P>
<P>
The house and two others behind it on St. Andrews Place were "invaded" almost 
immediately, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drug Abusers 
</P>
<P>
"We've witnessed up to 22 people at a time using the house," she said. "They're 
mostly drug and alcohol abusers, gang types, violent people. There's a constant 
turnover. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
For awhile, Gordon said, "there was a Spanish-speaking family living there. And 
although we're talking about a place with no water or electricity, I think they 
appreciated having it. They even did little things to keep up the front yard." 
</P>
<P>
"Then one day, like a lot of other people in this neighborhood, they just up 
and left, disappeared."

SANTA MONICA BEACH ACCESS KEY TO FLAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What a surprise! Douglas Badt, manager of the private Sand and Sea Club, was 
quoted in Times Staff Writer Alan Citron's article on April 30 saying, 
"Everyone wants the beach to stay as it is." Badt and his elite members wish to 
keep things as they are -- they have had exclusive access to a beach site for 
which they pay the city of Santa Monica next to nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Badt and his members . . . are suddenly outraged that a hotel will block access 
to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Badt is currently funding an initiative drive aptly named "Save Our Beach". 
Save our beach for whom? For the 200 or so wealthy members of the Sand and Sea 
Club? No, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Santa Monica City Council, under pressure from the state of 
California, which owns the property, chose a new mixed-use plan for the club 
site. The goal was to dramatically improve access for all beach-goers, while 
generating substantial revenues for the bankrupt Beach Fund. The Beach Fund 
pays for the upkeep and improvement of all Santa Monica beaches. 
</P>
<P>
The city chose Michael McCarty to build a hotel and community center on the 
Sand and Sea site. As a Pico Neighborhood activist, I was one of numerous 
representatives from community organizations throughout Santa Monica to help 
design the community center. It will include community meeting space, a staging 
area for public events, a low-priced cafe, a children's park, a marine and art 
learning center, and most importantly, year-round beach access for all of the 
public. A 148-room hotel at the site will pay for these public uses and will 
restore the Beach Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Badt's initiative takes advantage of people's concerns about overdevelopment 
while actually preserving the private privileges of a few. The city's plan 
opens public access to the beach and deserves our support.

CAR BROKER SURRENDERS IN THEFT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A car broker charged with 16 counts of grand theft and operating without a 
salesman's license has surrendered to police, authorities said last week. 
</P>
<P>
John Davis Allsbury, 38, turned himself in to police Wednesday after his 
attorney and police worked out the details of his surrender, Police Capt. Dave 
Hinig said. 
</P>
<P>
Allsbury, an Arcadia resident, was arraigned in Pasadena Municipal Court that 
afternoon and was released after posting a $50,000 bond, Hinig said. Allsbury 
was accompanied by his attorney, Doug Trousil, when he arrived at the Police 
Department, Hinig said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. Walt Lewis said a preliminary hearing for 
Allsbury, who pleaded not guilty during the arraignment, is scheduled for June 
20. Allsbury and Trousil could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Allsbury was charged April 27 with eight counts of grand theft and eight counts 
of selling cars without a license, Lewis said. The charges stemmed from 
Allsbury's car brokering business, Auto Marketing Concepts, 159 E. Huntington 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Evidence 
</P>
<P>
The charges were based on eight brokering deals Allsbury handled, but Lewis 
said there is evidence of other misdealings. 
</P>
<P>
James Lee Roper, general manager at Auto Marketing Concepts, has been charged 
with four counts of grand theft and three counts of operating without a 
salesman's license, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said charges were filed against Allsbury and Roper after months of 
investigation prompted by complaints from the Department of Motor Vehicles, car 
dealers and some of Allsbury's former customers. 
</P>
<P>
Customers and car dealers for whom Allsbury acted as a go-between told 
authorities that Allsbury defrauded them of between $12,000 and $59,000, Lewis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Allsbury's customers paid him to purchase cars from dealers of autos, such as 
Jaguar, Mercedes Benz and Toyota, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
When dealers discovered Allsbury had given them bad checks, they repossessed 
the cars from buyers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints against Allsbury date from November, 1987, to February, 1989, Lewis 
said.

BREAKING NEW GROUND; 
</P>
<P>
CITY TURNS TO WATER-SAVING GARDENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Silver bells and cockleshells might have done the job in Mary's garden, but in 
Santa Monica, city landscapers have something else in mind. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last few weeks, workers have uprooted the grass in three gardens near 
City Hall and replaced green turf with Australian bluebell creepers, 
bougainvillea and other "drought tolerant" plants. 
</P>
<P>
The $10,000 demonstration project is designed to promote an increasingly 
popular method of gardening called "xeriscape." From the Greek word xeros, for 
dry, xeriscaping uses a combination of stones, mulches and plants that need 
little water. 
</P>
<P>
A xeriscape can save up to 40% of the water that would be used by a 
conventional garden or lawn, officials say. And in Southern California, 50% of 
the average household's water bill goes to outdoor uses. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of xeriscaping has been around for years, but the public -- until 
recently -- resisted exchanging lush green lawns for water-thrifty gardens 
planted with desert flora. Advocates of xeriscaping have had to dispel the 
notion that water-thrifty plants are generally drab and ugly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Just Sagebrush' 
</P>
<P>
"We want to show people that xeriscape landscaping can be nice-looking and 
colorful and not just consist of cacti and sagebrush," said Stan Scholl, 
director of General Services for Santa Monica, the office that is overseeing 
the city's xeriscape project. 
</P>
<P>
Although last year's drought -- which led to emergency water-conservation 
measures in dozens of California cities -- is now considered over in most of 
the state, water management officials are encouraging homeowners, developers 
and other water users to permanently adopt water-conservation habits, such as 
xeriscaping. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica, a new law requires that xeriscaping be used in all commercial 
and multifamily construction that includes landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
The concept was first developed in Denver. Its slowness in catching on locally 
is perhaps ironic, given the fact that much of Southern California originally 
was an arid land of chaparral and tumbleweed. 
</P>
<P>
But over the decades, hordes of Midwesterners and Easterners moved to Southern 
California, and they wanted the same kind of verdant front yards they had back 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to move people away from that mentality and toward a more 
natural landscape, toward plantings that are native to Southern California and 
to arid zones," said Jay Malinowski, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Water 
District of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Campaign to Begin 
</P>
<P>
The agency, which provides just over half of the water used in Southern 
California, is about to launch a $2-million campaign to promote water 
conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Malinowski said the tide has turned and that people are being persuaded to try 
xeriscaping. A conference on the subject in Orange County drew about 40 
participants five years ago, he said; the same conference this year attracted 
about 600.

Under a proposal that was passed upon second reading by the City Council, the 
Planning Commission will increase its efforts to advise residents of 
developments proposed for their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The revisions in the commission's notification guidelines were prompted by 
complaints from neighborhood activists that they sometimes do not know of 
development plans until they have already won city approval. 
</P>
<P>
When dealing with large projects -- more than 45 feet in height, more than 
100,000 square feet in floor area and with a seating capacity of more than 500 
people -- the commission will send notices to property owners within a 500-foot 
radius of the proposed development site rather than within a 300-foot radius, 
as now required. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, resident managers of rental properties within the proposed 
area also will be notified.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By a vote of 172 to 252, the House defeated an amendment sponsored by the 
Democratic leadership in hopes of getting Republicans, Democrats, 
conservatives, liberals and moderates to agree on budget priorities. This 
occurred during debate on a bill (HR 2072) providing $4.7 billion in 
supplemental appropriations for domestic programs in the remaining five months 
of fiscal 1989. It caused Democratic leaders to abruptly pull the bill from the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
The bill's price tag is $2.6 billion more than sought by the Bush 
Administration, as a result of the Democratic-led Appropriations Committee 
adding money for housing, homeless, veterans, anti-drug and other domestic 
programs. At issue was how to cut the overall federal budget to make room for 
the additional spending. 
</P>
<P>
The plan rejected by this vote called for across-the-board cuts affecting most 
discretionary spending programs in the remainder of fiscal 1989 and totaling 
nearly $2.6 billion. Because defense as well as social programs were seen as 
being impaired, conservatives and liberals joined to provide the wide margin of 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Tom Foley (D-Wash.) the House majority leader, said the amendment 
offered members "the first opportunity we will have this year to indicate 
whether we are going to live within the budget restraints." 
</P>
<P>
Objecting to defense cuts, Joseph McDade (R-Pa.) called the measure "management 
by meat cleaver." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the Democratic leadership's budget plan.

To Waive Budget Act 
</P>
<P>
The House agreed, 223 to 198, to debate the supplemental appropriations bill 
(above) under a rule waiving the fiscal restraint of the Congressional Budget 
Act. This cleared the way for floor consideration of the measure (HR 2072). The 
waiver was needed because the bill's $4.7-billion price tag exceeded legal 
spending limits Congress imposed on itself for fiscal 1989 under the budget 
act. The House and Senate often grant such waivers so they can spend more than 
they previously allowed themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey) said the waiver would not increase the 
deficit because the bill's pay-as-you-go approach was designed to honor 1989 
spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Bob Michel (R-Ill.) the minority leader, said the regular granting of 
budget waivers "explains in part why the deficit is still where it is." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to exempt the supplemental appropriations bill from 
statutory spending limits.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By a vote of 172 to 252, the House defeated an amendment sponsored by the 
Democratic leadership in hopes of getting Republicans, Democrats, 
conservatives, liberals and moderates to agree on budget priorities. This 
occurred during debate on a bill (HR 2072) providing $4.7 billion in 
supplemental appropriations for domestic programs in the remaining five months 
of fiscal 1989. It caused Democratic leaders to abruptly pull the bill from the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
The bill's price tag is $2.6 billion more than sought by the Bush 
Administration, as a result of the Democratic-led Appropriations Committee 
adding money for housing, homeless, veterans, anti-drug and other domestic 
programs. At issue was how to cut the overall federal budget to make room for 
the additional spending. 
</P>
<P>
The plan rejected by this vote called for across-the-board cuts affecting most 
discretionary spending programs in the remainder of fiscal 1989 and totaling 
nearly $2.6 billion. Because defense as well as social programs were seen as 
being impaired, conservatives and liberals joined to provide the wide margin of 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Tom Foley (D-Wash.) the House majority leader, said the amendment 
offered members "the first opportunity we will have this year to indicate 
whether we are going to live within the budget restraints." 
</P>
<P>
Objecting to defense cuts, Joseph McDade (R-Pa.) called the measure "management 
by meat cleaver." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the Democratic leadership's budget plan.

SLAIN APARTHEID FOE MOURNED IN PROTEST MARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bespectacled anthropologist, David Webster, concluded a recent paper on 
repression in South Africa by singling out the "steady tempo" of anti-apartheid 
activists slain by right-wing death squads. 
</P>
<P>
Webster said these clandestine groups control government opponents by 
assassination after official methods, such as detention, have failed. "It is a 
very rare event indeed when such assassinations are ever solved," he added. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, before that paper could even be published, about 5,000 white and 
black South Africans marched through Johannesburg's white suburbs to bury 
Webster, himself a victim of an assassination squad. 
</P>
<P>
The gentle-mannered, 43-year-old white professor was killed outside his home 
Monday by a single shotgun blast fired from a car carrying three white men. His 
funeral march was one of the largest anti-apartheid processions here since the 
government imposed a state of emergency three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Webster was the 61st anti-apartheid activist assassinated in South Africa since 
1978, and the ninth in less than two years, according to human rights groups. 
The authorities have filed charges in only one such case in 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
The hearse carrying Webster's simple casket was escorted on a five-mile journey 
from St. Mary's Anglican Cathedral downtown to a suburban cemetery Saturday by 
jogging throngs of mourners, carrying anti-apartheid banners and singing songs 
extolling the outlawed African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
During a three-hour funeral service, attended by the leading lights of the 
anti-apartheid movement, Webster was eulogized as "a gallant soldier whose 
determination to fight apartheid was more important than his life," in the 
words of Mohammed Valli Moosa, a United Democratic Front official. 
</P>
<P>
"It is people like David Webster who make black people realize that white South 
Africans are human beings," said the Rev. Frank Chikane, a black church leader. 
"His death is a clear indication that he was a thorn in the side of the 
disciples and beneficiaries of apartheid." 
</P>
<P>
Well-planned attacks on political activists and bombings of anti-apartheid 
group offices have escalated in recent years, and political analysts blame 
shadowy, pro-apartheid vigilante groups, some reportedly made up of police 
officers or former police officers unhappy with government constraints on 
security force behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"These are guys who believe they are the white knights of the white race, 
appointed by God to keep the black hordes and communism at bay," Mark Swilling, 
an expert on black politics at the Center for Policy Studies in Washington, 
D.C., said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Swilling said it's no coincidence that the increase in vigilante activity has 
coincided with a decline in the number of massacres, beatings and incidents of 
torture by police, who are under intense international pressure to shape up 
their image. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Muzzles Police' 
</P>
<P>
The right-wingers "think the government has betrayed whites. And when the state 
muzzles the police, they figure the only natural and moral thing is to take it 
upon themselves to eliminate the revolutionaries," Swilling said. 
</P>
<P>
Max Coleman, a white activist and friend of Webster, said his colleague's death 
"bears all the hallmarks of a professional, well-informed hit squad. And there 
is no more profitable place to start the investigation than within the ranks of 
the police themselves." 
</P>
<P>
The South African police have denied involvement in any of the bombings or 
assassinations since 1978, and they have launched a highly publicized search 
for Webster's killers, issuing sketches of the wanted men and offering a 
10,000-rand ($4,000) reward for information leading to their capture. 
</P>
<P>
But the failure to solve these crimes in the past "feeds suspicion that agents 
of the state, on duty or off duty, are guilty, and that the state itself does 
not want the crimes solved," the Business Day newspaper said in an editorial 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unlikely Target 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, Webster seemed an unlikely target for such a hit squad. 
Although he was one of the few white members of the UDF, a banned 
anti-apartheid coalition, the quiet, baldish professor was not a prominent 
political activist. He often referred to himself as "just a small fry," friends 
said, and unlike thousands of other activists he had never been banned, 
detained or restricted by the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
But Webster was well-known to the local police because of his work with the 
families of detainees. He helped organize many social gatherings for released 
detainees and their relatives, often booking the meeting halls in his name. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, he had frequently come face-to-face with police attempting to 
break up those "detainee tea parties" in black townships. Webster usually 
attempted to negotiate with the police, and he was warned several times that no 
more tea parties would be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
Less than two weeks before his death, police surrounded a Johannesburg church 
during another tea party. Webster's attempts to mediate that time were futile 
and police ordered the meeting to disperse. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the kind of person every security policeman loved to hate," said 
Swilling. "He had a moral courage that the police came into contact with 
regularly. And he was a white man whom the black comrades loved." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Webster had begun writing about government repression for 
human rights publications, and he became an expert in the field of "extra-legal 
repression" -- political assassins, hit squads and vigilantes. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Webster and Maggie Friedman, his girlfriend and co-researcher, had 
driven their small pickup to the bakery and returned home, parking on the 
street. When Webster walked to the back of the truck to let his dogs out, a car 
drove slowly past and a shotgun was fired at Webster's chest. He collapsed and 
died almost instantly. 
</P>
<P>
His funeral drew dozens of foreign diplomats and hundreds of anti-apartheid 
leaders, including white activists such as 84-year-old Helen Joseph, the Rev. 
Beyers Naude and Raymond Suttner. Suttner, a law professor and former detainee, 
served as a pallbearer, defying a government order that prohibits him from 
being with more than four people at a time. 
</P>
<P>
Webster's friend Johnny Clegg, South Africa's most famous pop musician, flew in 
from Los Angeles, a stop on his current U.S. tour. Clegg and Webster, both 
anthropologists, shared a passion for black township life and music. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unrestricted Funeral 
</P>
<P>
Anti-government demonstrations of any kind are illegal in South Africa, and 
police have routinely limited the number of mourners and speakers at political 
funerals. But Webster's funeral was not restricted, and several hundred police 
impassively monitored the funeral and parade route. 
</P>
<P>
Webster's murder reminded many of the death of Ric Turner, a white professor at 
Natal University, who was shot to death as he answered a knock on his front 
door in 1978. No one was arrested in that case, and since then a string of 
activists have been killed by "persons unknown," in the words of the police. 
</P>
<P>
Griffiths Mxenge, a Durban civil rights attorney, was stabbed to death on his 
way home from work in 1981. His wife, Victoria, began a campaign to identify 
his killers but, four years later, she was hacked to death in front of her 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Godfrey Dhlomo, 19, made allegations of police brutality last year in a 
documentary aired by CBS and was later interviewed by police about those 
claims. Four days after he talked to police, he was found shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
The only such killing to result in arrests was that of Eric Mtonga, 35, a 
regional director of the Institute for Democratic Alternatives for South 
Africa. Mtonga was beaten to death and then stabbed in the heart. Several 
senior police officers from the Ciskei homeland have been charged. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, more than 50 anti-apartheid activists have been killed by 
unknown assailants outside of South Africa. And unknown bombers and arsonists 
have destroyed several buildings occupied by anti-apartheid organizations.

U.S. TO TEST EXTENT OF SOVIET REFORMS; 
</P>
<P>
BAKER TO ASK GORBACHEV TO HELP WITH MIDEAST, TERRORISM, POLLUTION ISSUES

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III sets off on his first visit to Moscow 
this week, intent on testing the depth of Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's sweeping changes by challenging the Soviets to work with the United 
States on a broad range of issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Can military confrontation really be replaced by political dialogue and even 
cooperation?" Baker asked in a speech Thursday. "Will the (Gorbachev) slogan of 
'new thinking' be translated into enduring action?" 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said Baker plans to deliver a two-part message during his 
two-day stay in Moscow: 
</P>
<P>
 -- That President Bush supports Gorbachev's perestroika reforms of the economy 
and political structure but wants to see them reflected more fully in Soviet 
behavior around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 -- That the Administration wants to expand the focus of the Moscow-Washington 
dialogue beyond the traditional emphasis on arms control and human rights to 
give greater prominence to conflicts in such regions as the Middle East and to 
such global problems as terrorism and pollution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changing Relationship 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, one official said, the Administration hopes to help change the 
relationship from one dominated by the nuclear confrontation of the Cold War to 
"a more normal relationship between two great powers." 
</P>
<P>
"The overall theme that we're trying to focus on is testing Gorbachev, . . . 
probing opportunities in an activist fashion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That may lead to some sharp exchanges in Moscow over such contentious areas as 
the Middle East and Central America. Unfortunately, complained a senior 
Administration official, so far the United States "has seen more old thinking" 
in Soviet actions in those regions. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Middle East, we'd like the Soviets to constrain their military support 
for Syria and Syria's activities in Lebanon," he said. "Instead, we see them 
sending SU-24s (medium-range bombers) to Libya and continuing the high level of 
military supplies to Nicaragua." 
</P>
<P>
And in Iran, he noted, the Soviet Union has been slow to condemn calls for 
terrorism by the regime of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, which the Kremlin 
is wooing as a possible ally. He said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze "visited Tehran without publicly mentioning the Salman Rushdie 
affair," in which Khomeini called for the author's assassination because of a 
novel that allegedly blasphemes Islam. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Review Unfinished 
</P>
<P>
About the only tangible agreement expected from Baker's visit is a date, 
probably in June, for resumption of the strategic arms reduction talks (START). 
A senior State Department official said Baker does not intend to engage in any 
specific discussions on arms control, apparently because the Administration 
still has not completed its review of U.S. negotiating strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Another senior official said Baker does not intend to discuss short-range 
nuclear forces in Europe, an issue that has split the Western Alliance, 
"although we might express hope that the Soviets will make unilateral cuts in 
their 1,400 (short-range) missile systems." The United States and its allies 
have only 88 comparable systems in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's agenda, like his Thursday speech outlining the Administration's 
approach to U.S.-Soviet relations, breaks no new ground on specific issues. 
</P>
<P>
White House and State Department aides have objected to the characterization of 
their policy toward Moscow, compared to President Ronald Reagan's, as "status 
quo plus." But in fact, veteran career foreign policy officials said, it is 
only a little more than that. 
</P>
<P>
"The framework of the past four years is solid and flexible enough to tackle 
the problems," said a State Department officer. "This Administration just plans 
a more active attitude, a more forward-leaning approach toward change, 
implicitly setting its sights higher than its predecessor." 
</P>
<P>
He cited three examples of the Bush Administration's cautious innovations: 
</P>
<P>
 -- On arms control, the Administration has indicated that negotiations should 
go beyond merely seeking a balance in armaments on both sides. Rather, they 
should aim for constraints on how each side structures its nuclear and 
conventional forces in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On the Middle East, the Administration will ask the Soviets to participate 
in the peace process and to behave responsibly in the region. That marks a 
subtle shift from the past, when Washington had said Moscow could take part in 
the peace process only after its behavior turned responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On Eastern Europe, the Administration is developing a policy to expand 
economic and cultural exchanges with the increasingly autonomous countries of 
the Soviet Bloc, beginning with a package of economic and trade benefits for 
Poland that it unveiled last month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Changing Relationship 
</P>
<P>
Despite the modest scale of these changes, there is growing recognition in 
Washington that the broader political relationship between the superpowers is 
changing. 
</P>
<P>
"A qualitatively new relationship is emerging," said William Green Miller, 
director of the American Committee on U.S.-Soviet Relations. "Contacts are no 
longer formal, between officials, but occur at every level in every field, 
across the board, far beyond the previous issues of security and attitudes of 
hostility." 
</P>
<P>
A new set of common U.S.-Soviet interests has emerged, a development that was 
not foreseen by V.I. Lenin, leader of the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, and cannot 
be explained by the conflict of communism and capitalism, Miller said. These 
include transnational questions of nuclear arms, environment, poverty and 
disease, which require cooperative measures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Military Disengagement' 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the military relationship between the superpowers is becoming 
more stable, and U.S. officials believe less attention needs to be devoted to 
the risk of conflict. "A military disengagement of sorts is beginning," said a 
State Department expert, "which means more energy can be focused on solving 
regional and global problems." 
</P>
<P>
As the risk of military confrontation in Europe recedes, Baker aides say, the 
importance of solving conflicts in the Middle East and other Third World 
trouble spots increases. Not only are those the most likely arenas for wars to 
begin, but the proliferation of ballistic missiles and chemical weapons makes 
brush-fire wars ever more dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials visiting Washington have shown a revived interest in setting 
out new rules of behavior, akin to the "Basic Principles of U.S.-Soviet 
Relations" that were signed at the 1972 summit to guide the emerging new 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unenforceable Principles 
</P>
<P>
These principles, as former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger later wrote 
in "White House Years," were broad and unenforceable -- such items as the 
importance of avoiding confrontation and the need for mutual restraint. They 
were intended, Kissinger said, to "establish a standard of conduct by which to 
judge whether real progress was being made." 
</P>
<P>
The "rules of the road" failed, however, to prevent Soviet adventures in 
Africa, Nicaragua and elsewhere. The Bush Administration, like its 
predecessors, remains highly suspicious about writing new ones or resurrecting 
the 1972 agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the White House intends to build the new U.S.-Soviet relationship 
cautiously, "one step at a time," taking the pertinent issues as they arise. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Visit to Moscow 
</P>
<P>
Baker, who has never visited the Soviet Union, will spend 32 hours in Moscow. 
He is scheduled to arrive Wednesday morning, meet with Shevardnadze and other 
Soviet officials and then talk with newly elected members of the Congress of 
People's Deputies and a group of Soviet Jews. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Baker is scheduled to meet for about two hours with Gorbachev 
before wrapping up his talks with Foreign Ministry officials. He will leave 
Moscow on Thursday afternoon for Brussels.

FOUR-YEAR SAGA OF WILLIE ED HARRIS; 
</P>
<P>
GUN DEALINGS LEAVE TRAIL OF FRUSTRATION FOR LAWMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HURST, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gun shows seem harmless enough, on the surface. 
</P>
<P>
There is even a festive, make-believe quality to these weekend events held at 
county and state fairgrounds and at civic convention centers all over the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes men dress in soldier of fortune camouflage outfits and walk around 
carrying assault rifles. A man wearing a buckskin shirt with a six-shooter 
strapped to his hip is just part of the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the men who buy, sell and trade guns at the shows seem to truly adore 
and appreciate these weapons. One federal firearms agent likens gun shows to 
the gatherings of model train collectors. The guns are so plentiful and are 
handled so casually that they don't seem to be quite real. 
</P>
<P>
But they are real. And while most participants in these events are probably 
just plain law-abiding, gun-loving folks, law enforcement officials say that 
some of the transactions conducted at the shows are not only illegal but can be 
dangerous to society. 
</P>
<P>
Gun shows, say law enforcement officials, can be a marketplace for stolen 
weapons and a source of firearms for criminals because weapons transactions at 
these events frequently go unrecorded and handguns often are sold in violation 
of state law requiring a 15-day "cooling-off" period and a criminal records 
check of the purchaser. 
</P>
<P>
The shows are sometimes linked, say investigators, to street gangs and 
narcotics dealers and to international gun smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
Take the case of Willie Ed Harris. 
</P>
<P>
When police arrested Harris at a gun show in Pomona on May 5, 1985, it looked 
like just another misdemeanor handgun sale. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Harris was only one of 32 people charged with breaking California 
law by selling handguns cash-and-carry to undercover police officers at the 
weekend show. The miscreants could expect to be fined a few hundred dollars and 
sent on their way. 
</P>
<P>
But Harris' arrest proved to be not just another misdemeanor case. It was 
instead the first step in a twisting, frustrating four-year journey that led 
investigators from gun shows to violent street gangs in Los Angeles, to a drug 
dealer, to a Filipino gun-smuggling operation and to a Los Angeles County 
sheriff's reserve deputy who allegedly ran an illicit firearms business, 
according to court records and interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona police realized that Harris was not simply guilty of a misdemeanor when 
a criminal records check revealed two previous felony convictions: assault with 
a deadly weapon involving a pistol in 1978 and lewd acts with a child under the 
age of 14 in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
It is against the law in California for a convicted felon to possess a 
concealable weapon. It is also against state law for a person convicted of a 
felony involving a gun to possess any type of firearm. In other words, Harris 
was prohibited from possessing handguns, rifles or shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
On May 15, 1985, 10 days after his arrest at the gun show, Pomona police 
officers served a search warrant on Harris' home on Redondo Boulevard in a 
working-class neighborhood west of downtown Los Angeles. They found two 
handguns, a blackjack, a billy club and at least a dozen empty firearms boxes, 
according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No-Contest Plea 
</P>
<P>
On June 13, Harris pleaded no contest in Los Angeles County Superior Court in 
Pomona to three felony counts of being a convicted felon in possession of 
handguns and two felony counts of possessing illegal weapons: the blackjack and 
billy club. Superior Court Judge Loren Miller Jr. put Harris on two years 
probation without supervision, over the objections of Deputy Dist. Atty. Harold 
W. Hoffman Jr. A condition of Harris' probation was that he not possess any 
firearms. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, in an interview, defended giving Harris probation rather than jail 
time, stating: 
</P>
<P>
"I remember how chicken I thought it was to arrest somebody at the gun show. I 
thought that (selling guns) was the purpose of the gun show. . . . People are 
roaming around the street killing each other and they (police) are all camped 
out at the gun show arresting people." 
</P>
<P>
On July 25, 1985, just over a month after he was put on probation, Pomona 
police officers went back to Harris' home, accompanied by Los Angeles police 
officers, and found two loaded AR-15 assault weapons and 12 boxes of 
ammunition, according to court documents. Harris was again charged with 
illegally possessing firearms and with child endangerment, because his children 
allegedly had easy access to the guns. 
</P>
<P>
Harris posted bail and remained free as the case worked its way through the 
Superior Court system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Federal Involvement 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Los Angeles police and federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms agents began taking a closer look at Harris. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, gangs in Los Angeles were beginning to use assault weapons in street 
killings. In mid-April, 1986, police got a tip that "an individual by the name 
of Bill was selling fully automatic weapons to (Rolling 30s Crips) street gang 
members, as well as handguns," according to a search warrant affidavit on file 
in Los Angeles Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit, signed by Los Angeles Police Detective Jaime Samaniego, stated 
further that, "Your affiant learned through departmental channels that 'Bill' 
is Willie Ed Harris." 
</P>
<P>
On April 29, 1986, detectives from the LAPD Gang Activities Section arrested 
Harris for allegedly selling an informant a Mac-10 assault pistol equipped with 
an illegal silencer, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, police found an AR-15 assault rifle under Harris' house and 
seized two boxes of bullets with explosive tips and nearly 1,000 rounds of 
other ammunition from inside the home, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
Harris told police that he had bought the Mac-10 assault pistol at a gun show. 
</P>
<P>
"Defendant stated that (he) had sold numerous weapons at gun shows," says a 
police report on file in Superior Court. "Defendant stated that he made extra 
money by buying and selling weapons. He sold weapons to anyone, including 
(narcotics) dealers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Denies Gang Link 
</P>
<P>
Harris told The Times that he did buy the Mac-10 and the silencer at a gun show 
and that he sold them to an acquaintance nicknamed "Way Out" who turned out to 
be working with the police. But he denied allegations that he sold weapons to 
gang members or drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
The LAPD subsequently turned over its case against Harris to agents of the 
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Cates, who is now working for U.S. Customs, was a federal firearms agent on 
the Harris case more than two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"My partner and I were working gangs," Cates recalled. "We identified him 
(Harris) as an individual who in our estimation bought . . . quantities of guns 
and then . . . sold them to black youth gang members." 
</P>
<P>
Serial numbers on handgun boxes that had been seized from Harris were traced by 
firearms agents to a federally licensed gun dealer in Highland Park. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strange Combination 
</P>
<P>
James Glen Boyd and Willie Ed Harris would seem to be an odd couple to form a 
partnership of any kind. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, 46, is black, over 6 feet tall and overweight. One of his eyes stares 
off into the distance as he talks. Harris says he suffers from high blood 
pressure, gout and diabetes. And there are the multiple felony convictions. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd, 52 at the time of the investigation, was described as white, tall and 
handsome with gray hair. A firearms agent said he looked like actor Peter 
Graves of "Mission Impossible." And whereas Harris was a convicted felon, Boyd 
had been a Los Angeles County sheriff's reserve deputy since 1968 -- a position 
with all the authority of a regular peace officer. He resigned in 1986 -- in 
April, the same month that Harris was arrested with the Mac-10 and silencer. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd did not operate a regular gun shop. Instead, he sold weapons out of his 
home in Highland Park and at weekend gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
Harris says he met Boyd at a gun show and began to peddle weapons for him on 
consignment. 
</P>
<P>
"Any weapon that Willie Harris could acquire," Cates said, "he would sell it to 
anybody who wanted to buy it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Falsified Forms 
</P>
<P>
During their investigation, firearms agents discovered 64 federal weapons 
purchase forms that Harris and Boyd allegedly falsified apparently to conceal 
the fact that Boyd was delivering weapons to a felon. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, federal agents also discovered that during 1985 and 1986, Boyd 
was falsifying firearms forms to sell large numbers of handguns to Nestor 
Atacador, a citizen of the Philippines, who was smuggling the weapons out of 
the country in microwave ovens for resale on the black market in the 
Philippines and other countries, according to court documents and interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the handguns turned up in Japan on June 6, 1986, according to court 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
An informant told federal agents that Atacador met Boyd in a bar, but Cates 
says he believes the two became acquainted at a gun show while Atacador was 
looking for weapons. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 31, 1986, a federal grand jury indicted Atacador for allegedly 
attempting to smuggle 41 pistols out of the country and on nine counts of 
allegedly falsifying federal firearm documents. 
</P>
<P>
With Atacador under indictment, federal agents continued to put together their 
case against Boyd. 
</P>
<P>
But in December, 1986, Atacador jumped his $50,000 bond and disappeared. He 
remains at large. 
</P>
<P>
Still trying to build their case against Boyd, federal prosecutors struck a 
deal with Harris in January, 1987, to gain his cooperation. In exchange for his 
promise to testify against Boyd, prosecutors agreed to reduce pending charges 
against Harris. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Death Ends Inquiry 
</P>
<P>
But none of this would prove to be enough to put Boyd in prison. 
</P>
<P>
As federal agents in Los Angeles worked on their case against him, the gun 
dealer moved to rural Virginia and bought an old colonial style home. 
</P>
<P>
Then, some time after the deal with Harris was made, firearms agents in 
Virginia called Los Angeles. Boyd was dead. Natural causes. Case closed. 
</P>
<P>
On July 9, 1987, Harris, who remained free, was finally tried on the charges of 
possessing the two assault rifles discovered in his home by Pomona police two 
years before. 
</P>
<P>
Harris pleaded guilty to one felony count of being a felon in possession of a 
gun. He was sentenced by Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Gordon Ringer 
to three years in state prison, but Ringer suspended the sentence and instead 
placed Harris on three years supervised probation. Again, a condition of 
probation was that Harris was not to possess firearms. Harris was also given 
180 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll do 180 days in County Jail," said Ringer. "No work furlough. No work 
release. No county parole." 
</P>
<P>
But Ringer stayed the jail time for a month to give Harris time to straighten 
out his personal affairs and on Aug. 4 the judge granted a motion to modify the 
sentence to 120 days at a private halfway house to be served Wednesdays through 
Saturdays at Harris' expense. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still in Business 
</P>
<P>
Harris served the halfway house time but, according to a federal search warrant 
affidavit filed last January, has continued to deal in firearms. The affidavit 
says that Harris drives a 1988 Lincoln Town Car as well as a 1988 Mustang and 
sometimes conducts his weapons business by car phone. 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit maintains that Harris used a woman acquaintance -- sometimes 
paying her with cocaine -- to buy handguns for him. The woman apparently was 
able to pass the state-required criminal background check that is made before a 
handgun can be legally purchased. 
</P>
<P>
The federal affidavit alleges that when Harris and his female companion were 
apprehended with three brand new handguns on March 7, 1988, Harris admitted the 
weapons had been purchased for a known narcotics dealer. 
</P>
<P>
"Harris added that he was supposed to telephone (the drug dealer) on his car 
phone once he got the firearms and then meet him to make delivery," says the 
affidavit. "Harris stated that (the drug dealer) had already paid him for these 
firearms and that he had sold (the drug dealer) other firearms in the recent 
past." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drug Dealer Arrested 
</P>
<P>
Harris then led federal agents to the narcotics dealer, according to the 
affidavit, and delivered the handguns to him while agents waited nearby to 
arrest the dealer on firearms charges. 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit alleges that Harris continued to arrange purchases and sales of 
guns through last fall and winter and finally on Jan. 23, firearms agents 
searched his home with a federal warrant. 
</P>
<P>
The results must have been disappointing to the agents. They found a couple of 
hundred rounds of ammunition, several gun bags and cases, a couple of holsters, 
but no guns. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the agents apparently think they have enough on Harris to make a federal 
firearms case stick. They turned their information over to a federal prosecutor 
this month for consideration as a grand jury case. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, in the meantime, is still free. 
</P>
<P>
He sat on the front porch of his home one recent morning, one eye on a reporter 
and the other askew, gazing off it seemed toward the traffic rolling by on 
Redondo Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"The feds have been trying to build a case on me," he said. "They've been 
trying to nail me with something." 
</P>
<P>
But Harris insists that he is innocent and says he doesn't mess with guns 
anymore.

EUROPE BUSY CLOSING DOOR TO FOREIGNERS

ALGECIRAS, Spain 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They come at night, braving the treacherous strait in leaky 20-foot fishing 
boats called pateras. 
</P>
<P>
Paying up to $1,700 for the nine-mile illegal crossing to Europe's southernmost 
tip, many Moroccans ante up their life savings, gambling on a brighter future 
in a land rich beyond their dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, winds and currents in the Strait of Gibraltar swamp the 
overloaded boats, tipping their human cargoes into the sea and almost-certain 
death. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, the Moroccans are caught by Spanish authorities and returned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Networks of Smugglers 
</P>
<P>
But with luck, they reach the shadowy networks that smuggle them to Madrid, to 
the French border and to menial black market jobs in the inner cities of 
northern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Algeciras Police Chief Javier Fernandez calls them espaldas mojadas -- 
literally, those with wet backs -- and says it is almost impossible to stop 
them completely. 
</P>
<P>
"The coast is too wide and we are too few," he said, shrugging. 
</P>
<P>
Their numbers -- hundreds each week, according to most estimates -- are small 
compared to the 850,000 Mexicans caught attempting to cross illegally into the 
United States last year. 
</P>
<P>
But for a continent where people already feel overwhelmed by a rising tide of 
immigrants, refugees and asylum-seekers, they add a worrisome dimension to a 
serious problem. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Multicultural Europe 
</P>
<P>
Western Europe's social democracies are only now digesting the sobering fact 
that most of the estimated 10 million to 15 million foreigners among them are 
no longer foreigners but part of a new multicultural, multiracial, 
multireligious Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of these outsiders, the majority of whom arrived legally and by 
invitation, represents one of the most fundamental and deep-seated social 
changes in Europe since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly Europe is accustomed to immigrants and refugees. Its catalogue of 
wars, revolutions and persecutions has seen to that. But the resettlement of 
large numbers of non-Europeans is a new and unsettling phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
Consider, for example, that: 
</P>
<P>
 -- By 1995, every second child born in Brussels, the self-proclaimed capital 
of Europe, will be Arab. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Twice as many Britons speak Urdu, Punjabi or Gujarati as Welsh, the native 
language of Wales. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In France, an estimated 700,000 Arabs will be eligible to vote in the next 
presidential election, a number nearly twice as large as the margin that 
separated the candidates in the 1974 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In West Berlin, three of the city's television stations now broadcast in 
Turkish. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Spain, road signs have appeared in Arabic to ease confusion among the 
estimated three-quarters of a million Moroccans who cross the country every 
summer on vacation trips from cities to the north. 
</P>
<P>
For a part of the world whose principal experience with non-Christians has been 
in religious wars and colonial exploitation, the ramifications of this 
population shift are considerable -- and occasionally disquieting. 
</P>
<P>
Protests surrounding Salman Rushdie's novel "The Satanic Verses," the death 
threat against Rushdie by Iran's supreme leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini, and the subsequent assassination of a leading Muslim clergyman in 
Brussels sent shock waves across the Continent. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rushdie affair," Britain's Home Secretary Timothy Renton commented in an 
interview, "is a new dimension for a lot of people who haven't really thought 
about . . . the idea that a distant prophet, a religious leader, can lay down a 
fiat, a law that Muslims throughout Europe can take as a binding commandment. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from adding to social tension, what West Europeans call "the foreigners 
issue" has complicated European attempts at unity, tilted the political 
equation in several countries, raised questions about the future role of the 
Continent's generous but hard-pressed welfare states, influenced demographic 
trends and begun to change the way Western Europe views itself as a society. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rooted in Economic Boom 
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, Europe's problem is rooted in its post-World War II economic 
recovery. To ease crippling manpower shortages that threatened to strangle the 
boom of the late 1950s and early 1960s, governments and large corporations 
recruited cheap, unskilled labor abroad. 
</P>
<P>
With the lure of a quick fortune, Turkish "guest workers" arrived to sweep 
streets of Geneva or build Volvos in Goteborg, Sweden, at wage levels they had 
only dreamed of. Moroccans and Tunisians came to dig coal in French Lorraine or 
stoke the coking ovens of West Germany's Ruhr region. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Britain's textile industry, in order to remain competitive, did not 
buy costly machines but recruited cheap Pakistani labor to work the old ones. 
Jamaicans answered ads in Kingston newspapers and took jobs driving London's 
buses, trains and subways. 
</P>
<P>
In more recent years, large numbers of illegal laborers, mainly from North 
Africa, slipped into Spain and Italy and found work picking grapes and in 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Influx From 'Colonies' 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the influx, war and unrest in formerly colonial areas brought in 
hundreds of thousands of additional refugees in the 1960s and early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the oil crisis pitched Europe into recession in the mid-1970s, many 
guest workers had established roots, brought wives and started families. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, dreams of going home began to fade. And only then did the long-term 
implications of Europe's massive recruitment begin to dawn on its 
policy-makers. 
</P>
<P>
Today, in an atmosphere where individual countries are desperately trying to 
close their doors to more outsiders, "the foreigners issue" has complicated 
European Community efforts to dismantle by 1992 the checkpoints on borders 
dividing its member nations. 
</P>
<P>
"There are few issues in Europe more challenging," said C. D. de Jong, a senior 
official in the Dutch Ministry of Justice. "We're doing a lot of thinking." 
</P>
<P>
So are many others. Right-wing parties that appeal to anti-immigrant sympathies 
have sprouted in several countries, including West Germany, France, 
Switzerland, Denmark, Norway and Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
In recent West Berlin municipal elections, a party headed by a former member of 
the Nazi SS shocked political observers by taking advantage of an 
anti-immigrant backlash and winning 7% of the vote, enough to topple a 
coalition headed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks later, an election in Frankfurt produced a similar result. 
</P>
<P>
In a country that recently coined the word ueberfremdung, which means 
"overwhelmed by foreigners," the same issue could decide who will be chancellor 
after next year's national elections. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extreme Right Reacts 
</P>
<P>
In France, Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front revived the country's extreme 
right with the simple message that France's 5 million residents of foreign 
origin must either become completely assimilated or go. 
</P>
<P>
Le Pen collected more than 4 million votes in last year's presidential election 
on that theme, and from his hillside chateau on the western outskirts of Paris, 
he recently launched, with the same idea, his party's campaign for June's 
European Parliament elections. 
</P>
<P>
"The call for Europe is to defend the historic, ethnic, cultural and spiritual 
identity of the European people," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
The idea that 350 million West Europeans could feel overwhelmed by a minority 
population representing barely 4% of their total number seems a puzzling 
overreaction. Ethnic and racial minorities make up roughly five times that 
percentage of the U.S. population. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Explosive Combination 
</P>
<P>
But in Europe, the concentration of minorities in large urban areas, together 
with intense competition for social services and jobs, makes for a potentially 
volatile political cocktail. 
</P>
<P>
In a region where indigenous populations have begun declining, high birthrates 
among minorities inject additional fears of being overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
"Europe is subjected to a threat from the demographics of the Third World and 
Islamic expansionism," Le Pen said. 
</P>
<P>
But most important, Europe, unlike the United States, has developed no melting 
pot to immerse new arrivals in its culture. Its instinct has been to isolate 
rather than absorb new minorities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Citizenship Strictures 
</P>
<P>
In some instances, access to citizenship in Europe has been tightened. Official 
discrimination is often demoralizing. 
</P>
<P>
A West German-born son of Turkish parents living in the country for 20 years 
may yearn to be like his peers, but he has no automatic right to citizenship, 
and his special "foreigner status" prevents him, among other things, from 
becoming a public servant, a doctor, a pharmacist, a policeman or even a 
railroad locomotive driver. 
</P>
<P>
"Second-generation youngsters want to be the same as German kids -- study, play 
and dream of a future, but everywhere there are limits," said Barbara John, who 
runs an immigrant assistance office for the West Berlin city government. "If we 
don't open up and become more flexible, there's a danger of real difficulties." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Immigration Cut Sharply 
</P>
<P>
Except for family unification, European governments have virtually ended 
immigration from Third World countries. (Immigration from Eastern Europe, 
however, has increased sharply amid a more relaxed East-West climate, with 
about 200,000 East Europeans arriving to resettle in West Germany alone last 
year.) Authorities also scrutinize refugees and political asylum-seekers from 
outside Europe far more closely than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
In most countries, acceptance rates for political asylum-seekers have dropped 
from between 80% and 90% in the mid-1970s to around 10% today. Some refugee aid 
groups fear that tough new European Community proposals could effectively shut 
the door completely. 
</P>
<P>
People dealing with caseloads say the shift reflects not so much a hardening of 
criteria as a new breed of applicant -- one not fleeing political persecution 
but seeking a better life style. 
</P>
<P>
But they admit that the public mood also plays a role. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a fact of life that (our) society wants us to say no," said De Jong, the 
Dutch Justice Ministry official. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strengthening Frontiers 
</P>
<P>
As the European Community's 12 member states work to dismantle their internal 
frontiers, the debate centers on how -- not whether -- to strengthen the 
Community's frontiers with the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
In the corridors at EC headquarters in Brussels, immigrants are a problem 
usually lumped together with drug-runners and terrorists on the list of 
headaches. Visa requirements have already been tightened, making visits by 
foreigners' families more difficult to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
In Madrid, Spanish officials talk of a new coast guard service to crack down on 
illegal immigrants. They say that beginning next year Moroccans entering Spain 
legally will be required to have visas, return tickets and minimum funds for 
their European stay. Some predict that this will bring chaos. 
</P>
<P>
"We're under a lot of pressure from the other (EC) countries to resolve this," 
said Aquilino Gonzalez, a senior official in the Spanish Interior Ministry. "If 
the door is open in one of the 12, it's open in all 12." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second-Class Rights 
</P>
<P>
For foreigners already resident here, the discussions have raised the prospect 
that they will find themselves with a form of second-class rights in a 
post-1992, border-free Europe. 
</P>
<P>
At present, an Algerian legally a resident in France has as much access to the 
French job market as his French counterpart, but if present EC thinking 
prevails, he could be blocked from joining his French counterpart on a transfer 
to work in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
"What 1992 represents is a transformation of nationalism into a white 
continentalism, altogether more tight, resilient and with more power," said 
Christopher Mullard, a professor at the University of Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
When Europe sent out a call for guest workers in the 1950s and 1960s, "no one 
placed any limits on the residence of those recruited," noted Lutz R. Voss, a 
senior official in the West Berlin Internal Affairs Department. "People just 
assumed the guest workers would return (home) after a few years, so officials 
didn't even think along those lines." 
</P>
<P>
They do now. 
</P>
<P>
With Western Europe struggling as hard today against unemployment as it once 
did to recruit labor, several governments have offered lucrative incentives to 
persuade these workers to go home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Return Fare Offered 
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands has even offered to pay the return fare for unemployed 
immigrants, then send them Dutch social security benefits once they get there. 
</P>
<P>
Some have gone, but far more have stayed. 
</P>
<P>
In Britain and, to a lesser extent, France, social tensions have boiled over 
into street violence. Bitter riots in London and some northern English cities 
earlier in this decade shocked British authorities into drawing up one of the 
Continent's few race-relations programs. 
</P>
<P>
In most countries, however, community relations are characterized more by 
mutual suspicion, subtle discrimination and low-grade hostility. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bitter Reaction 
</P>
<P>
"Once we were well-liked; we helped build the 'economic miracle,' " recalled 
Serdar Yilmaz, a 26-year-old Turkish-born travel agent who, as a child, 
followed his father to West Berlin 20 years ago. "Now, people see there are 2 
million unemployed and 4 million foreigners and say, 'Just ship 'em home.' " 
</P>
<P>
Azeddine Guessous, Morocco's ambassador to Spain, said: "These countries came 
to recruit workers for their boom and recovery, but the moment there are 
problems, the first victims are those who contributed most. We don't think it's 
just." 
</P>
<P>
But any serious discussion of repatriating Europe's foreigners has long since 
been overtaken by the fact that to an increasing extent they are no longer 
foreign. 
</P>
<P>
French sociologist Juliette Minces estimates that at least 60% of the people 
with North African roots living in France and widely viewed as immigrants, are, 
in fact, French-born. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feel They Belong 
</P>
<P>
"They feel this is where they belong," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In Britain, roughly half the nonwhite population was born in the British Isles, 
and two-thirds of West Germany's 1.5 million Turks are under 16. 
</P>
<P>
But for Europe's new minorities, there are also some reasons for optimism. 
</P>
<P>
Nonwhites now appear in British television ads, an important development, 
according to civil rights groups, because many rural Britons have had no 
contact at all with minorities. 
</P>
<P>
In Britain and France, where an earlier, more liberal attitude provided 
generations of colonials with citizenship, minority groups have created voting 
muscle. 
</P>
<P>
In Britain's 1987 general election, four nonwhite candidates, including the 
first black woman, won seats in the House of Commons; while in France, 
second-generation North Africans, called Beurs, achieved a major success by 
winning more than 500 of the 36,000 seats in municipal elections last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Breakthrough in France 
</P>
<P>
"It is an important breakthrough," said Arezki Dahmani, president of France 
Plus, an immigrant-rights organization. "It means France has accepted our 
permanence." 
</P>
<P>
Such public figures also provide important role models for a generation bereft 
of cultural signposts. Some have even had the temerity to suggest that their 
heritage has something to offer Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with French television, Koshi Yamgnage, a Togo-born engineer 
recently elected mayor of the small Breton village of St. Coulitz, explained 
why he consulted so many residents before making decisions that other 
politicians might make on their own. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, it's not possible to take an important decision without consulting the 
people," he said. "It comes from my African culture."

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mayors of Dallas and Ft. Worth easily won reelection Saturday, and San 
Antonio's former mayor regained her office by a commanding margin as elections 
were held in four Texas cities. 
</P>
<P>
The least predictable contest appeared to be for mayor in El Paso, where 
political observers forecast a runoff from the six-candidate race. 
</P>
<P>
In Dallas, with 151 of 299 precincts reporting, Mayor Annette Strauss had 73% 
of the vote to 20% for attorney Peter Lesser. 
</P>
<P>
In San Antonio, former Mayor Lila Cockrell won with 59% of the vote to 31% for 
insurance executive Carl Mauthe. 
</P>
<P>
Cockrell, who was mayor of San Antonio from 1975 to 1981, was supported by the 
man who replaced her, Henry G. Cisneros, a leading Latino political figure. 
Cisneros, beset by personal problems, decided against seeking a fifth term. 
</P>
<P>
Ft. Worth Mayor Bob Bolen, who faced no serious opposition in his bid for a 
fourth two-year term, won with 89% of the tally. 
</P>
<P>
In El Paso, with only absentee ballots counted, City Council member Suzy Azar 
had 32% of the vote total to 27% for Mayor Pro Tem Ed Elsey. The other four 
candidates did not receive significant votes. If no one gets a majority of the 
vote, the top two finishers will face off May 27.

GAZA'S 'WAR DAY': 3 DIE, 100 HURT;

<P>
CLASHES WITH ISRAELI ARMY BRING HEAVY TOLL AMONG ARABS

GAZA CITY, Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Young Jamalat Abu Lulu pondered the violence approaching her door Saturday with 
calm as reports of fresh deaths in nearby refugee camps circulated and an 
Israeli army helicopter buzzed overhead. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation is getting worse and worse," she said, fingering her "I Love 
Palestine" bracelet. "People are getting more and more committed." 
</P>
<P>
The 14-year-old is herself a walking showcase of violent commitment. She has 
been wounded three times and is something of a hero in her neighborhood inside 
the chock-a-block Rafah refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Her tenacity seemed to mirror the events outside on a day when three 
Palestinians were shot to death during some of the fiercest confrontations in 
the 17-month-old Arab uprising. It was a day designated by Palestinian rebel 
leaders as one "of war and confrontation," and the violence reminded onlookers 
of the chaotic first months of the uprising, when mass demonstrations often 
ended in violence and large numbers of casualties. 
</P>
<P>
The toll of wounded Saturday reached single-day levels never before seen in the 
Gaza Strip -- at least 100, according to U.N. officials. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin flew into the Gaza Strip by helicopter 
to survey the violence. The Gaza area had been declared "pacified" by Israeli 
military officials just a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
The unrest capped a bloody month of Ramadan, a time when devout Muslims fast 
and pray to commemorate the period when the Prophet Mohammed received the word 
of God. At least 40 Palestinians died in clashes with troops during the month, 
mostly in the Gaza Strip and the southern part of the West Bank, where Islamic 
fundamentalism is strong. 
</P>
<P>
In the Nusseirat refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, a procession of several 
hundred congregants from a mosque tried to converge on a cemetery where they 
planned to hold memorial services for Palestinian dead, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd chanted "We redeem our martyrs with blood and soul!" and "We want our 
state!" then threw stones at observing Israeli troops. An Israeli helicopter 
launched tear gas and soldiers fired into the crowd, using marble-sized metal 
projectiles, plastic bullets and full-metal rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Word of the unrest in Nusseirat spread to other refugee camps, and crowds took 
to the streets, putting burning tires in roadways and pelting army jeeps with 
stones if they tried to enter their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting worse than ever before," said Jorgen Rosenbal, director of Ahli 
Hospital, run by the Anglican Church. 
</P>
<P>
Ambulances pulled up frequently to the hospital, bringing patients with a 
variety of wounds, especially to the face and upper body. Of the 55 victims 
treated by 1:30 p.m., most suffered some injury from bullets, while some had 
been hit with the metal marbles and others had been bruised from beatings, 
doctors said. Muslim imams broadcast calls for blood donations from 
loudspeakers atop minarets. 
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Abdullah Zakout, 35, and Raid Muanes, 20, were shot dead in Nusseirat, 
and Id Alama Saud, 22, was killed in the Khan Yunis camp in Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
At some point, Palestinians in Khan Yunis stabbed a suspected collaborator to 
death, bringing the day's fatal toll to four. 
</P>
<P>
The latest leaflet circulated by the leadership of the uprising had called for 
Saturday to be a day of "war and confrontation." So had published instructions 
from the Islamic Resistance Movement, known as Hamas, which commands a large 
following in Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Follower of Hamas 
</P>
<P>
Abu Lulu is a follower of Hamas; she wears a modest black cloak of the type 
fundamentalist women wear and believes that all of what once was Palestine, 
Israel included, should form a single state under Islamic law. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday morning, Abu Lulu was sure the violence would soon arrive in Rafah. "I 
myself will join up when we hear the call," she assured visitors. 
</P>
<P>
The slightly built girl makes no bones about her role in the intifada, as the 
uprising is called by Arabs. Unlike some Palestinians who claim to have been 
shot while out shopping, Abu Lulu says she was injured confronting the 
soldiers. 
</P>

Fled Home in 1948 
</P>
<P>
Abu Lulu's family fled their home in Beersheba, a desert town east of the Gaza 
Strip, during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Forty-one years later, the younger 
generation has built a record of combat against the Israelis; her eldest 
brother, Farid, 21, is spending time in jail for organizing stone throwers to 
attack soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
Three other brothers have served short terms in prison; two are in hiding and a 
third is recuperating from a chest wound. 
</P>
<P>
Only on occasion does a fancy surface that might seem appropriate to someone 
Abu Lulu's age. When asked who here heroes are, she answered: "(PLO leader) 
Yasser Arafat and (pop singer) Michael Jackson."

PALESTINIANS DENOUNCE CALL FOR ATTACKS ON WESTERNERS

Prominent Palestinians on Saturday condemned a senior Iranian official's call 
for the killing of five Westerners for every Palestinian slain in the uprising 
in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Britain and France, meanwhile, joined the United States in condemning Iranian 
Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani's call on Friday to kill American, 
British and French citizens, hijack planes and blow up factories in retaliation 
for the killing of Palestinians by the Israeli army. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea why the Iranians would suddenly make statements about the 
Palestinians," said Sari Nusseibeh, a prominent Palestinian philosophy 
professor in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. "I believe they should really look 
into their own business and allow us to look after ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Nusseibeh disassociated the Palestinian cause from Rafsanjani's statements. 
"They reflect a total alienation from the entire Palestinian situation, not 
only the Palestinian situation but also the political reality of the world." 
</P>
<P>
In London, Palestine Liberation Organization official Faisal Aweidah said 
Westerners aren't to blame for Israeli actions. 
</P>
<P>
"Every man has the right to say what he wants, but we do not approve of that 
policy, and we do not think it is conducive to the peace process that is going 
on around the world despite what Israel is doing." 
</P>
<P>
In Amman, Jordan, local PLO representative Abderrazak Yahia, who is a member of 
the organization's Executive Committee, said: "The Palestinian revolution 
embodied in the intifada is not based on terrorism but on a nonviolent 
strategy. . . . Rafsanjani's statement is a clear expression of a sick, 
terrorist mind."

ARABS SEEK TO DEFUSE WHO CRISIS 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arabs seeking to placate Washington have passed word to European and other U.S. 
allies that they will not consider abstentions "hostile" when the World Health 
Organization votes Tuesday in Geneva on the admission of the Palestine 
Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
They argue that abstentions, instead of votes for admission, could soften the 
impact of the heavy majority that is expected to favor the PLO's admission, 
which has so far been publicly opposed only by the United States and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Arab diplomatic sources, speaking on condition that they not be named, said PLO 
leader Yasser Arafat was reluctant to confront the Bush Administration over 
joining the U.N. health agency because official talks between the United States 
and the Palestinians have been under way in Tunis, Tunisia, since late last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
But one said that Secretary of State James A. Baker III "pushed us into a 
corner" by announcing his opposition to PLO membership in WHO and threatening 
to cut off U.S. funding for the agency if the Palestinians are admitted to full 
membership. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appeals for PLO Retreat 
</P>
<P>
WHO's general director, Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, appealed for a PLO retreat 
because loss of this year's $73.8-million U.S. assessment, plus another $25 
million in back dues, would virtually halt the agency's work. The United States 
pays a quarter of the budget of the agency, which finances immunization, 
nutrition and other public health programs largely benefiting people in the 
Third World, including Palestinians in Israeli-occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
Arab diplomats said the PLO is merely following a path blazed by "national 
liberation movements" in the former Portuguese colonies in Africa in the 1970s. 
Despite opposition from Western nations, such movements in Angola, Mozambique 
and elsewhere declared themselves governments and were admitted to membership 
in U.N. agencies with the backing of African, Arab and Soviet Bloc votes. 
</P>
<P>
A simple majority of WHO's membership can raise the Palestinians from observer 
to full status, despite the assertion of opponents that the PLO fails to 
qualify as a government. There is little doubt that the votes will be 
forthcoming, and Arab diplomats meeting with Baker last week urged him to 
accept the PLO bid for membership, the sources said. But the secretary remained 
obdurate. 
</P>
<P>
"We explained to him that Arafat badly needs some kind of gesture of support 
from Washington because he's under heavy attack from Palestinians to his left 
and right," an Arab diplomat said. "His critics contend that Arafat has made 
all the concessions and Israel has made none in attempting to build a base for 
negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
One of the suggestions made to Baker, they said, was the reopening of the PLO 
information office in Washington that was closed by congressional order in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
They said that Baker, however, resisted reopening the Washington office as well 
as suggestions that he press Israel to adopt a more liberal stance toward the 
PLO.

Oliver L. North, speaking before a cheering crowd of hard-core supporters 
Saturday, attacked Congress for intervening in foreign affairs but avoided any 
mention of his conviction on three of 12 counts in the Iran-Contra scandal. 
</P>
<P>
North's only reference to his legal situation was indirect, coming when he 
criticized Congress and the independent counsel's office for spending $40 
million on investigating the Iran-Contra affair. He said the money would better 
have been spent supporting the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
It was the retired Marine lieutenant colonel's first scheduled public 
appearance since he was convicted Thursday of supplying Congress with a false 
chronology of the Iran-Contra events, shredding documents to cover up the 
deceit and accepting a $13,800 home security system from Richard V. Secord, who 
still faces trial for his part in shipping weapons to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
The event was sponsored by conservatives among Miami's Nicaraguan and Cuban 
immigrants, who are helping pay North's legal bill.

WRIGHT SOLICITED FUNDS, S&amp;L WITNESS SAYS

A former savings and loan executive has testified that House Speaker Jim Wright 
offered to block legislation that could hurt thrifts in exchange for $250,000 
in contributions to a political action committee. 
</P>
<P>
David R. Farmer was testifying Friday in the trial of three former savings and 
loan executives on charges that they allegedly participated in what federal 
prosecutors say was a conspiracy by the thrifts to evade federal laws by 
channeling corporate contributions to political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
No direct evidence that Wright had made any such promise was presented. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Task Force Probe 
</P>
<P>
Wright was not named in the federal indictment against the three defendants, 
Robert Hopkins, Morton Hopkins and John Harrell, who were charged after 
investigations by the Dallas Bank Fraud Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
The three are former executives of Commodore Savings Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Farmer, former senior vice president and chief financial officer of Commodore, 
said he gave a $1,000 donation to the East Texas First Political Action 
Committee in 1985, then was told to file a false expense report to get the 
money back. 
</P>
<P>
Farmer said it was understood that Wright, the Democratic majority leader at 
the time, had guaranteed that specific legislation unfavorable to savings and 
loans would be blocked from making it out of committee. The former Commodore 
executive did not cite the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"In return for the contributions, Jim Wright guaranteed the legislation would 
not get out of committee," Farmer said. "Both John (Harrell) and myself were 
amazed that as high ranking an individual in the Congress as he (Wright) would 
be involved in something like this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Says 10 Contributed 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning, Farmer said 10 savings and loans were contributing a total 
of $250,000 to the political fund. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview after the court session, the New York Times reported, Harrell 
did not dispute Farmer's testimony, but he said he never spoke directly with 
Wright about raising funds and would not say where he got his information. The 
newspaper said Farmer testified that he was told about the deal by Harrell, the 
savings and loan's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
In other testimony last week, witnesses said Commodore employees gave donations 
to a political action committee and were given raises in return. 
</P>
<P>
A Commodore secretary testified that some of the money donated to the political 
action committee was laundered through Vernon Savings &amp; Loan. On one check 
the words "For Jim Wright" were written on the memo line, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Calls from the Associated Press to Wright's Washington and Ft. Worth offices 
went unanswered late Friday night.

HEAT DEATH OF MENTAL PATIENT INVESTIGATED

<P>
San Bernardino County prosecutors have launched an investigation to determine 
whether criminal negligence contributed to the death of a mental patient who 
had been subjected to 110-degree heat while locked in a room at Patton State 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Francisco Morfin, 23, of Los Angeles died last September shortly after being 
found slumped in a chair with a body temperature of 104.6 degrees, said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Jim Hackleman. 
</P>
<P>
The coroner's office attributed Morfin's death to a toxic effect related to the 
drug lithium, widely prescribed for people with mental disorders. A deputy 
coroner said toxicity was caused by the combination of the high room 
temperature, dehydration caused by lithium and clogged arteries.

FRANK O'ROURKE, 72; PROLIFIC WRITER OF WESTERNS, MYSTERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frank O'Rourke, who wrote more than 60 novels after embarking on a writing 
career with "E Company" in 1945, has died of complications of asthma, it was 
learned this week. 
</P>
<P>
O'Rourke, who specialized in Westerns and mysteries, was 72 when he died April 
27 in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
"The Writers Directory" lists more than 60 novels and short-story collections 
under his name. He often completed three books in a single year. His books 
appeared so often that his publishers asked him to use pseudonyms, which he 
did. Some of them were Kevin Connor, Frank O'Malley and Patrick O'Malley. 
</P>
<P>
Some of his works were made into films, including "The Bravados," a 1958 
Gregory Peck vehicle, "A Mule for the Marquesa" (called "The Professionals" 
when it was released with Burt Lancaster in 1966) and "The Great Bank Robbery." 
</P>
<P>
Some of his major novels were "The Bright Morning," telling of youths growing 
up in the Midwest in the 1930s; "The Far Mountains," a historical novel of the 
Southwest in the 19th Century, and his first, "E Company," about his military 
service. 
</P>
<P>
His works were sprinkled with colorful names, some of them old cowboys he had 
encountered in his travels. One was Doughbelly Price, featured in two of his 
books, "The Diamond Hitch" and "The Last Ride." Others came from historical 
sources, such as Talache Coyote in "The Bride Stealer." O'Rourke found Coyote 
in the Spanish Archives of New Mexico, which the writer said contained records 
from 1621. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by compilers of the anthology series "Contemporary Authors" what advice 
he would offer aspiring writers, O'Rourke responded: "I learned a long time ago 
that people don't want advice."

Three hundred anti-nuclear protesters appeared outside Kings Bay Naval 
Submarine Base near St. Mary's, Ga., and 59 were arrested in the largest of 28 
demonstrations at nuclear facilities around the country. Pax Christi, a 
national Roman Catholic peace group based in Erie, Pa., organized the protests 
to mark the anniversary of a 1983 pastoral letter from U.S. Catholic bishops 
that opposed the development of first-strike nuclear systems. Those arrested, 
including a 79-year-old woman who carried a sign that read "Granny for Peace," 
were cited for trespassing and obstructing the road in front of the base, 
police said. Bruce Nelson, a spokesman for the Camden County Sheriff's 
Department, said two demonstrators, who gave their names as John and Jane Doe, 
were jailed on charges of refusal to give their proper names. The others were 
released after being given warning citations, he said.

Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh is threatening to end the role of the American Bar 
Assn. Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary in screening prospective federal 
judges unless the ABA keeps a commitment not to consider political or 
ideological beliefs. Thornburgh said "we expect them to honor" an agreement to 
revert to pre-1980 language in the ABA's judicial screening guidelines. The 
1977 version does not contain any exception to the statement that political and 
ideological views are not considered. Later versions of the guidelines contain 
an exception that such views are considered if they bear on the ability to be a 
fair, impartial and open-minded judge. The dispute broke out Tuesday when ABA 
leaders took issue with Thornburgh's testimony to the House Judiciary Committee 
that the group had agreed to the change.

IRAQI DEFENSE CHIEF KILLED

Iraqi Gen. Adnan Khairallah, defense minister for 10 years and President Saddam 
Hussein's closest confidant, was buried in a state funeral after he was killed 
in a helicopter crash in northern Iraq. In a statement broadcast by the state 
radio and television, the Iraqi leader said the pilot of the helicopter flying 
the 50-year-old general to Baghdad on Friday lost control during a sandstorm. 
One person reportedly survived the crash. Khairallah, deputy commander in chief 
of the armed forces, had been considered the second-most powerful official in 
the tight-knit clan that rules the country. He was both a cousin and 
brother-in-law to Hussein.

For the first time since Hungary's 1956 anti-Soviet revolt, official radio 
broadcast a speech Premier Imre Nagy made in Budapest while Soviet troops and 
tanks crushed the uprising. The broadcast was seen as another step in a 
reassessment of that period in Hungary's history and the show trial that led to 
Nagy's execution in 1958. The speech Nagy gave on radio on Nov. 4, 1956, 
declared, "At dawn today, Soviet forces began an attack on our capital, 
obviously with the aim of toppling the legal, democratic Hungarian government."

A judge in New Caledonia charged a hard-line separatist with murder in the 
killing of two senior leaders of the independence movement in the French South 
Pacific territory. Andre Tangopi was charged in the shooting deaths of 
Jean-Marie Tjibaou, leader of the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front, 
and his top aide, Yeiwene Yeiwene. Police did not say what role Tangopi, who 
was wounded in an exchange of gunfire after the assassination, played in the 
attack. The two leaders were shot and killed Thursday by Djubelly Wea, who was 
then killed by Tjibaou's bodyguards. A witness has said five or six gunmen 
participated in the assassination.

Eight nations of South America's Amazon basin called on wealthy countries to 
provide money for the preservation of the world's greatest rain forest and for 
the economic development of the region. At the first summit meeting on the 
Amazon, the governments said the funds should be provided without any strings 
attached. The presidents of Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname 
and Venezuela and the foreign minister of Bolivia met in Manaus, Brazil, and 
issued a "Declaration of Amazonia." The document, taking note of the world 
outcry over the onslaught on the forests, said the international attention paid 
to the Amazon should be converted into "measures of cooperation on the 
financial and technical levels".

Communist firebrand Boris N. Yeltsin said that more than one person could be 
considered for the Soviet presidency, but he shied away from declaring himself 
a candidate to face the most likely contender, his one-time supporter, Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev. The Congress of People's Deputies, the parliament to which 
Yeltsin was elected by a landslide, meets May 25 to choose a president from 
among its 2,250 members. If past Soviet Communist Party practice holds, 
Gorbachev, the current president and party general secretary, will be the only 
candidate. But in an interview, Yeltsin did not discount the possibility of 
alternative candidates. "There could be other suggestions from deputies," he 
said.

MUSIC MERCI UPSET IN SPOTLIGHT HANDICAP;

<P>
HOLLYWOOD REPORTER, 15-1 SHOT, WINS RACE AFTER STOPPING FOR A BITE

While Sunday Silence and Charlie Whittingham were busy turning the racing world 
upside down in the Kentucky Derby, a former claimer named Hollywood Reporter 
shocked the folks back home with a $32.20 surprise in the $84,000 Spotlight 
Handicap Saturday at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
It was a bad day for odds-on favorites everywhere. Music Merci, at 1-2, was the 
Easy Goer of the Spotlight field and had no apparent excuse for his 
second-place finish in the one-mile turf event. 
</P>
<P>
"Turning for home, I thought we were going to win easy," said Chris McCarron 
with a shrug. 'He just got outrun." 
</P>
<P>
Outrun, as a matter of fact, by an ornery colt who took a bite out of his pony 
going to the post, then spotted the rest of the field a 20-yard head start 
while he was looking around for something else to chomp. 
</P>
<P>
"He ripped a hole in the outrider's pants, too," said jockey Rick Dominguez of 
Hollywood Reporter. "I guess we owe him a new pair." 
</P>
<P>
The $50,250 first prize earned by Hollywood Reporter will cover the cost 
nicely, while at the same time it more than doubled Hollywood Reporter's 
lifetime earnings. 
</P>
<P>
While Hollywood Reporter fumbled his way out of the gate, Music Merci and the 
aptly named Double Quick made right for the lead. Those two controlled a 
realistic pace, with an opening quarter in :23 1/5 and the half in :46 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Dominguez was more concerned about finding a way to avoid 
complete embarrassment. The 28-year-old journeyman never had won a stakes at 
Hollywood Park, and, as far as he was concerned, that did not figure to change. 
</P>
<P>
"I just kept creeping up on them," Dominguez said. "At one point I thought, 
'Maybe I'll get a piece of it.' Then, when we straightened into the stretch, I 
felt like he had a chance to win it all." 
</P>
<P>
Music Merci never knew what hit him. Hollywood Reporter passed the 
front-runners with a final rush that took him one length clear at the end. 
Music Merci finished a head ahead of third-place Exemplary Leader. 
</P>
<P>
The winner paid $32.20, $6.20 and $4.40. Music Merci returned $2.80 and $2.40, 
and Exemplary Leader paid $2.80. 
</P>
<P>
Owned by television producer Allan Landsburg and New Yorker Robert King, 
Hollywood Reporter began his career in the Wayne Lukas barn, where one of his 
regular exercise riders was Dominguez. 
</P>
<P>
It was not the same Hollywood Reporter, though. The son of Saratoga Six lost 
his first five races by a total of 68 lengths before breaking his maiden for a 
$50,000 claiming price last December. On April 12 Lukas dropped the colt in for 
$32,000 and didn't really mind losing him. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Vladimir Cerin gave Landsburg the credit for making the claim. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would be a dicey claim," said Cerin, 34, who got his first stakes 
victory. "But I did like the breeding. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought maybe he could win an allowance race up north, and then, if he 
didn't win too impressively, we could run him back for a $25,000 tag and get 
all our money back." 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Reporter split from the program immediately, winning an April 22 
allowance race at Golden Gate Fields by 13 lengths. Cerin turned from the 
claiming races to the stakes schedule, and now he will look around the country 
for the colt's next start. 
</P>
<P>
"I think maybe the Gold Rush Stakes at Golden Gate or the Jersey Derby," said 
Cerin. Told that unbeaten King Glorious probably would be waiting for him in 
San Francisco, Cerin quickly made up his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"Then it's the Jersey Derby for sure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another former claimer, the 5-year-old Sensational Star, outlasted favored 
Oraibi to win the co-featured, $83,450 Triple Bend Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Ridden by Rafael Meza, Sensational Star pressed a fast pace and still had 
enough left to win by a half-length in 1:21 2/5 for the seven furlongs on the 
main track. 
</P>
<P>
Trained by Bill Spawr and owned by Tony Calhoun and Lawrence and John J. 
Sullivan, the California-bred gelding paid $22, $6.60 and $6. Oraibi paid $3.40 
and $3.40, and Hot Operator returned $8.40. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Southern California fans (34,553 at Hollywood and 18,773 at eight off-track 
sites) bet $2,361,952 on the Kentucky Derby. For a while, local hero Sunday 
Silence was favored over Easy Goer but eventually drifted up to close at 2-1. 
The Easy Goer-Awe Inspiring entry was 4-5 and the local exacta paid $13.80, 
compared with $15.20 at Churchill Downs. . . . Harvey Cohen, co-owner of Music 
Merci, had a good news/bad news day. Although the Spotlight got away, he will 
be cashing a Future Book ticket on Sunday Silence at odds of 30-1.

MORGAN, DODGERS STOP CUBS, 3-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD HOFFER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Morgan, who hasn't been a .500 pitcher since the 1979 season at Ogden 
(well, he was 1-1 in 12 innings at Seattle four years ago), is making up for 
losstime as a Dodger this season. 
</P>
<P>
He threw six more scoreless innings, on top of eight similar innings in his 
last start, to get his third consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, 3-1 with a league-leading earned-run average of 0.69, is still 32 games 
below .500 in his curious career. But after the Dodgers' 3-0 victory over the 
Chicago Cubs Saturday night, he has certainly shown a reversal of fortunes. 
With the victory, before a Dodger Stadium crowd of 47,389, the Dodgers (15-15) 
are at .500, even if Morgan is still a ways under. 
</P>
<P>
The story continues to be Morgan, 29, the sore-footed pitcher who was rescued 
from the Baltimore Orioles this spring. His best year in the majors was in 
1987, when he went 12-17 with a 4.65 ERA. His worst, which is a tough pick, was 
probably last year at Baltimore, where he was 1-6 with a 5.43 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
And now? Understated Mike Davis, who scored one run and drove in another: "I 
think the Dodgers got more than they expected when they got Mike Morgan over 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan continues to be troubled by a sore big toe on his right foot, his power 
foot, the one he drives 220 pounds off with each pitch. Indeed, that was why he 
failed to get the shutout. He mentioned to his coaches that the toe had been 
bothering him all night, even as he warmed up in the bullpen. "Why take a 
chance?" Manager Tom Lasorda said afterward. Still, the six innings of 
three-hit ball he pitched, before yielding to reliever Jay Howell, were signs 
of a healthy career. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan's sudden development as a winning pitcher -- he was 34-68 with five 
organizations before coming to the Dodgers -- is difficult to account for. 
"More luck here," is about all he'd do to address that issue. He got a couple 
of outstanding defensive plays -- Mariano Duncan and Willie Randolph both made 
nice snags in the infield -- and enough offense from the Dodgers' stricken 
lineup. A walk and a single here, a walk and a double there, a stolen base and 
a hit over here. 
</P>
<P>
But he is clearly operating on something beyond fortune. OK, he has got some 
talent. He was picked to the big leagues right out of high school, Charlie 
Finley doing the picking, which tells you he had some raw ability. And over the 
years, that ability never let him down. His teams did, of course. But the arm 
stayed hinged. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got that arm," he said after the game. "And I've worked hard all my 
career. I've come out on the short end, but I've always had the arm. That's why 
six teams took a chance on me. When you've got an arm, teams will always take a 
chance on you." 
</P>
<P>
About all that looks to jeopardize his personal comeback is that toe. "Some 
pitchers wake up with sore arms," he said, "I wake up with a sore foot." He has 
had two surgeries on his foot and many cortisone shots. The off-season didn't 
help as he continues to go off and on with soreness. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no fun," he said, "and I'll probably have to battle on it" the rest of 
the season. I can't worry about my toe. It's just one of those things that I'll 
have to battle all season." 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't hurt that anybody else notices. Not even Andre Dawson, who came into 
the game with hits in eight consecutive at-bats, could reach him. After Morgan 
halted the streak two shy of the National League record in the first inning, 
Dawson returned in the third to scratch out an infield single. That was about 
it for the Cubs' offense. 
</P>
<P>
The only other threat, and this tells you something, came in the fifth inning 
when Shawon Dunston topped a ball in front of the plate and tossed his bat 
ahead of it. He appeared to be safe on a close play, but then all four umpires 
convened for a confab and decided that the tossed bat was interference. He was 
out. 
</P>
<P>
While the umpires discussed this, and the odd manager or two, Morgan continued 
to toss. He said later that the extra pitches probably didn't help his sore 
toe. So now teams know how to chase him: Top a ball, throw a bat and yammer at 
the umpire. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers meanwhile are not playing breakout ball themselves. The Cubs' Rick 
Sutcliffe (4-2) was hardly hammered in his seven innings. He was more like 
chiseled. The Dodgers, with all their power on the bench (Kirk Gibson, Mike 
Marshall, et al), had to scratch away for their runs. In the fifth inning, John 
Shelby beat out an infield single, stole second and then scored on Franklin 
Stubbs' single. 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth, Davis walked and eventually scored on Mickey Hatcher's single. 
Then in the eighth, Davis drove in Randolph with a double. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who had been batting .216 in spot play, was not overly excited about his 
two hits. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one game," he said, "I still haven't done anything." He was more 
impressed with Morgan, whom he had seen in the American League. "Mike Morgan is 
awesome right now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan said there was nothing strange about it. "Throw strikes, get good 
defense," he said. Still, a remarkable start, with only one regret: "I'd have 
liked to go nine, hear the roar of the crowd, the manager coming out." A small 
thing, though, for a pitcher who's finally back on the right, although sore, 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hamilton, who missed Friday's game while awaiting the birth of a child, 
didn't start Saturday, but played. He was up into the wee hours the night 
before during his wife Shelley's delivery of a baby boy at the Regional Medical 
Center in Tarzana. . . . Mike Marshall also missed another start, because of a 
stiff lower back. . . . Cub Andre Dawson was stopped two short of the National 
League record for consecutive hits. He hit a deep fly to right field in the 
first inning to end his streak at eight hits in a row. . . . The Dodgers' 
medical makeshift lineup, the one that started Saturday night's game, is not 
exactly Murderer's Row. Only Eddie Murray had homered this season.

KAREEM GETTING DOWN TO BUSINESS OF WINNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Left alone with his thoughts and the basketball, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar apparently 
is still capable of playing at a level from which many believed he had 
permanently fallen in his final National Basketball Assn. season. 
</P>
<P>
No longer required to provide personal insights during the public spectacle 
that was his farewell tour, and no longer warranting double coverage when 
receiving the ball, Abdul-Jabbar returned as an effective offensive weapon in 
the Lakers' first-round playoff sweep of the Portland Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar's scoring average of 15.3 points a game in the opening round was 
5.2 higher than during the regular season. His six-rebound average was an 
improvement of 1.5 a game. His verve and vitality made it seem, as Portland 
guard Clyde Drexler observed, that Abdul-Jabbar occasionally played as if he 
were 22, not 42. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Abdul-Jabbar has once again proved an offensive threat, he will no 
doubt draw more attention from the Seattle SuperSonics, who face the Lakers 
today at the Forum in Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
While Portland concentrated on stopping the Lakers' outside shooting, the 
SuperSonics figure to converge inside and make Abdul-Jabbar give up the ball. 
Thus the Laker center's role is expected to revert to that of a passer more 
than a scorer. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll probably collapse on me, like they play against everyone," 
Abdul-Jabbar said after practice Saturday at the Forum. "I just want to be 
effective and do what needs to be done in my area. I have to make sure I can 
pass the ball well and find the open guys. They don't want big men scoring on 
them inside." 
</P>
<P>
In that regard, the SuperSonics have been effective in their defensive scheme. 
In five regular-season games against Seattle, Abdul-Jabbar averaged 4.8 points, 
shot 48% and averaged five shots. 
</P>
<P>
But that was the regular season. The Lakers don't expect Abdul-Jabbar to repeat 
his 22-point performance in last Wednesday night's series-clinching victory 
over the Trail Blazers, but they are heartened that Abdul-Jabbar showed he can 
still score in important games. 
</P>
<P>
"(Laker big men) have to show patience and find the open man," Coach Pat Riley 
said. "But I don't want Kareem to get caught up in that. I still want him to be 
an offensive player in this series." 
</P>
<P>
SuperSonic Coach Bernie Bickerstaff said he always has considered Abdul-Jabbar 
an offensive threat. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to give away my scouting report, but I can tell you that we have 
the utmost respect for Kareem," Bickerstaff said. "I'm sure he's motivated. He 
wants to end his career with something other than a Rolls-Royce." Abdul-Jabbar 
credited two factors for his playoff revitalization -- the single coverage in 
the low post by the Trail Blazers and his single-minded purpose after dealing 
with the distractions of his farewell tour. 
</P>
<P>
Now that all the goodbys have been said, Abdul-Jabbar has acknowledged that the 
tour affected his concentration. He appreciated the affection and gifts, but it 
interfered with his play. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have that (anymore)," Abdul-Jabbar said. "It's very simple now. I 
don't have to deal with any ceremonies. I can play now." 
</P>
<P>
Also, because he had been all but phased out of the Laker offense during the 
season, most opponents didn't double-team him in the low post. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time (teams) go against me one-on-one, I try to take the shot, the best 
shot I can," said Abdul-Jabbar, who averaged 50% in the Portland series. "It'll 
help the team if they can rely on me. It'll open things up." 
</P>
<P>
Against Seattle, however, Abdul-Jabbar probably will face a one-on-three 
situation when receiving the ball. The player most often left open when that 
happens will be power forward A.C. Green, who benefited by averaging 19.8 
points (six more than his season average) in six games against the SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how they play," Abdul-Jabbar said. "They play everyone that way. They 
are very physical. They use a lot of guys. Their big men use up a lot of fouls 
to throw you off." 
</P>
<P>
If Bickerstaff watched videotape of the Lakers' three-game sweep of Portland, 
he surely won't consider leaving center Alton Lister to fend for himself 
against Abdul-Jabbar. The Trail Blazers left Abdul-Jabbar alone with a young, 
strong center, Kevin Duckworth, who was outplayed. 
</P>
<P>
But having the defense collapse on Abdul-Jabbar will mean that outside shooters 
such as Byron Scott and Magic Johnson will be open on the perimeter or that 
James Worthy and Green will be left unguarded underneath. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it," Riley said. "(Abdul-Jabbar) may not have the ability to 
sustain it (running) up and down the floor, and he might not have the movement 
like he used to have or the jumping. But if you let him down in the low post 
and put one guy on him, he doesn't forget that. That (scoring touch) comes back 
to him." 
</P>
<P>
Mychal Thompson, Abdul-Jabbar's backup, said opponents will be forced to deal 
with Abdul-Jabbar differently than they did during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said he has noticed an upsurge in Abdul-Jabbar's competitiveness, as 
in past playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
"One guy can't stop Kareem from taking his hook shot, so (teams) shouldn't do 
that," Thompson said. "And now he's really geared into it, so forget it. 
</P>
<P>
"Kareem's a clutch player. He did it for us last year against Detroit (in the 
finals), and there's no reason why he can't do it again this year. We aren't 
really surprised. Just pleased." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, doubts might have lingered in the minds of some teammates after a 
rough regular-season during which Abdul-Jabbar reported to training camp 
overweight, then suffered an early season injury that hindered his progress and 
almost forced Riley to bench him. 
</P>
<P>
"His season's been kind of up and down for him, so nobody really knew what was 
going to happen," Johnson said. "But to see him play like he did boosted 
everyone's confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar said he has never lost his confidence. He also said that he 
doesn't necessarily feel more inspired during the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not about attitude," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It's merely, as everyone knows, that the playoffs are what matter most. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's unfair to say he was bored (during the regular season)," Worthy 
said. "I just think the guy can't have the same type of regular season he's had 
for the past 14 or 10 years. He's had his energies divided by those ceremonies. 
He still tried to concentrate as much as he could while it was going on, but it 
was just too much, I think." 
</P>
<P>
Added Riley: "I think he got distracted more than anybody else. But I always 
thought that he'd lift his level of play." 
</P>
<P>
Ceremonies aside, Abdul-Jabbar almost always has been more productive in the 
playoffs than during the regular season. Only twice in the last six seasons has 
Abdul-Jabbar's scoring average been higher during the regular season than in 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a veteran," Scott said. "He knows what it takes. This is different than 
the season. He's been more into it. But you expect that." 
</P>
<P>
The only change is in Abdul-Jabbar's play, not his demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see that much change in Cap," Riley said. "I really don't. He's not 
coming in and (clapping) or anything. He's got the same personality . . . but 
his practice habits and drills are more intense. I think he realizes it works 
for him." 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar and other Laker big men have been working on combating physical 
play by opposing centers in the low post under the supervision of assistant 
coach Bill Bertka. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill's been working with Kareem the last 10 days on taking the bumps down 
low," Riley said. "That (physical play) sometimes takes Kareem out of his 
rhythm, but I think those drills have helped. Sometimes, even a 20-year veteran 
forgets some of the little things." 
</P>
<P>
It is obvious, however, that Abdul-Jabbar has not forgotten how to make the sky 
hook, how to take advantage of the lack of congestion in the lane and how to 
reawaken each spring. Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
The SuperSonics arrived in Los Angeles Saturday afternoon, after beating the 
Rockets in Houston Friday night, and had a light practice at the Forum. Coach 
Bernie Bickerstaff said he has not had much time to prepare a detailed game 
plan for the Lakers. "We're probably going to have to wing a lot of things in 
the first game," Bickerstaff said. "But I don't know how (his players) are 
going to react. We've never been in this position before with this group. It's 
going to be tough, because we're playing probably the best playoff team in 
basketball. Look at the collective playoff experience they have.". . . Since 
early April, when forward Xavier McDaniel replaced Michael Cage in Seattle's 
starting lineup, the SuperSonics went 8-2 in the regular season and 3-1 in the 
playoffs. McDaniel averaged 30.5 points in the final 10 games, but only 17 in 
the playoff series against the Rockets. "X (McDaniel) gives us a lift right 
away, and Michael is starting to make the adjustment and is playing well off 
the bench," Bickerstaff said. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Coach Pat Riley said the Lakers' main objective is to control McDaniel 
and prolific guard Dale Ellis. McDaniel averaged 18.7 points against the Lakers 
this season; Ellis 28.3. "We can't give them open shots," Riley said. "We have 
to play them tough and make them drive to the basket and work for their shots." 
Added forward James Worthy: "They are the keys to their club. When they get 
going, it opens up things for guys like (Derrick) McKey and (Sedale) Threatt.". 
. . Ellis, who suffered a broken nose during Game 2 of the opening round, will 
no longer wear a protective mask. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Lakers swept the SuperSonics in the Western Conference finals two 
seasons ago, the SuperSonics say they are not fearful of a repeat. "We're a 
different team, and they are a different team," SuperSonics forward Russ 
Schoene said. "I'd be very surprised to be swept this year. Not that they're 
not capable of doing it, but we're better prepared. We're ready and we could 
sneak in a win down here.". . . Because Game 2 is not scheduled until Wednesday 
night, Bickerstaff said the SuperSonics will return to Seattle tonight and fly 
to Los Angeles Tuesday night. "Otherwise, it would be like one of those six- or 
eight-day road trips," Bickerstaff said. "We've already been on the road five 
days."

<P>
A horse they thought so little of they did everything but leave him on a park 
bench with a note on him won the Kentucky Derby Saturday and may be the 
greatest thing to come down a homestretch in this decade and maybe in several. 
</P>
<P>
If he was a cat they might have drowned him at birth. He was knock-kneed, he 
wobbled when he walked like a teen-ager in high-heels. He was so ugly he was 
almost 2 years old before they were sure he wasn't going to be a camel. 
</P>
<P>
Twice, they tried to auction him off. But the horse-buying public was too smart 
for that. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody wanted Sunday Silence till Charlie Whittingham got a look at him. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Whittingham has been around race horses since the days of Dan Patch. He 
knows they don't have to look like something out of a Roy Rogers movie. You 
judge a horse with a clock, not a mirror. Man o' War might have had a lousy 
profile. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie liked Sunday Silence so much, he bought half of him. The horse the 
tuxedoed auctioneers could not get a nibble on looked to Charlie like a bigger 
bargain than a hot diamond. 
</P>
<P>
The horse who won $574,200 Saturday and $980,000 in his life wouldn't bring 
$17,000 at a dispersal sale two years ago. When Arthur Hancock III declined 
that sale price, his partners backed out. "You take him, then," was their 
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham, on the other hand, reacted as if a rich uncle had just left him an 
oil field. He couldn't believe a horse this good would be available at any 
price. The horse was not only good, he was as well-behaved as a Boy Scout and 
as trainable as a circus seal. Talent often comes coupled with moodiness, 
truculence, temperament. Talent often hates to be told what to do and how to do 
it. Good Soldier Schweiks, they're not. Sunday Silence was like a kid who eats 
his vegetables and cleans the blackboards. If he could talk, he would say "Yes, 
sir!" 
</P>
<P>
That's all Charlie Whittingham needs -- a fast horse who will do what he tells 
him. 
</P>
<P>
So, the horse nobody wanted is the toast of Kentucky today. He won the coldest 
-- and the slowest in 30 years -- Kentucky Derby on a gelid May Saturday when 
sleet swept down the backstretch and a cold wind whipped in the horses' faces 
on the turn for home. 
</P>
<P>
Was the winner much the best? Well, look at it this way: How many Kentucky 
Derbies do you see with the winner running sideways in the stretch? 
</P>
<P>
The race was run in the slow-freight time of 2:05. Horses move faster than that 
pulling surreys. That was the slowest Derby since 1958. There's no telling what 
Sunday Silence might have run if he hadn't come down the stretch like a guy 
carrying a football -- or being thrown out of a waterfront bar. Saddle broncs 
in a rodeo do less jumping around. Patrick Valenzuela must have thought he was 
trying to stay on a Brahma bull. 
</P>
<P>
The least surprised guy in Kentucky was Charlie Whittingham. Whittingham has 
been telling everybody who would listen for months that his horse was something 
special. It was such a startling change of posture for Charlie that the public 
chunked in $592,058 on his horse to win. 
</P>
<P>
It has always considered an act of faith back here in the bluegrass country 
that horses who come over the mountain from the Pacific are, by definition, 
"nice little California sprinters." They're not supposed to like it when 
anything draws alongside them. 
</P>
<P>
The horse who was supposed to expose them at Churchill this year was a speed 
demon infelicitously named Easy Goer. Tracksiders couldn't make up their minds 
whether he was another Man o' War -- or merely another Secretariat. Wonder 
Horse III. He didn't even need to be whipped. He had won the Wood Memorial 
under a hand ride like a horse on a bridal path being ridden by a debutante. He 
had come within a click of a world mile record with nothing chasing him. No one 
had ever shopped him around or put an ad in the paper or offered to throw in 
the saddle if someone would bid on him. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Whittingham was unimpressed. "Maybe he's a wonder horse," observed 
Charlie. "He better be." 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't. It was a case of easy come, Easy Goer. He did finish second. It was 
the second time he had lost at Churchill in six months. Maybe he didn't care 
for the track. It was hard to. It was greasier than a truck stop hamburger. The 
field often looked like Charlie Chaplin trying to cross a waxed dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
It was vindication of two sorts for his principal owner, Arthur Hancock III. He 
not only refused to sell Sunday Silence short -- twice -- but he had the laugh 
on those who said he was not serious enough to run the family heirloom, 
Claiborne Farms. When Arthur Three got out of college, he passed up mucking the 
family stalls in favor of playing a guitar in honky-tonks and writing songs 
about guys whose wives left them for truck drivers and took the kids with them. 
He even named Sunday Silence from a Kris Kristofferson lament titled, "Sunday 
Morning, Coming Down." 
</P>
<P>
The family wasn't sure they wanted a guy who would rather be Willie Nelson than 
a stud farmer, rather have a hit record than a Derby horse. Arthur took his 
guitar and left home. 
</P>
<P>
Claiborne Farms had 34 horses in 28 Derbies, winning two of them. Arthur Three 
has been in four Derbies and won two. 
</P>
<P>
The horse nobody wanted and the owner the family didn't want either hauled down 
the biggest prize in racing Saturday. If he -- they -- win the Triple Crown, 
they may set a new trend in the sport of kings. Get owners out of rock concerts 
and horses out of the Yellow Pages.

OFF-ROAD GRAN PRIX; 
</P>
<P>
EVANS GETS THE WIN; GORDON GETS DISQUALIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Walker Evans, the elder statesman of off-road racing at age 50, and Robby 
Gordon, the sport's latest phenom at 20, put on a finish Saturday night in the 
Rose Bowl the likes of which stadium racing had never before seen. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, who led from the start as the fast qualifier in his Jeep, was challenged 
late in the 12-lap race by the charging Gordon, winner of three of the previous 
five Grand National Sports Truck races in the Mickey Thompson Off-Road Gran 
Prix series. 
</P>
<P>
On the final trip around the short course that zig-zagged back and forth across 
the Rose Bowl football field, Gordon drove his Toyota into the side of Evans' 
Jeep and the two crippled vehicles crossed the finish line stuck together. 
</P>
<P>
The finish brought the crowd -- announced as 43,294 -- to its feet, but they 
filed out not knowing that Gordon had been disqualified and placed last for 
rough driving. 
</P>
<P>
"It was well-deserved," Evans said of the disqualification. "Actually, if he'd 
backed off just before the finish, I'd probably have rolled over. It was his 
bumper that kept me up." 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth time in recent weeks that Gordon had been censured by the 
rough driving committee, and each time the incident involved Evans. Gordon 
finished first at Seattle, but was dropped to third, and was forced to start 
last in the main event at Houston for misconduct in a heat race. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon's disqualification moved his Toyota teammate, Ivan Stewart, into second 
place with Danny Thompson, whose late father Mickey founded stadium racing, 
getting third in his Chevy truck. 
</P>
<P>
Evans gave an indication of the power in his Jeep when he set fast time in the 
afternoon qualifying session and then came from last place to win the first 
8-lap heat. He had some help from Thompson, whose Chevy rolled over on its side 
while running second. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson made no mistakes in the second heat, winning wire-to-wire despite 
sustained pressure from Roger Mears' Nissan and Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
Al Arciero of Anaheim maintained the family dominance in the super 1600 buggy 
final, fending off Mitch Mustard of Arvata, Colo., for 12 laps. Arciero took 
over the lead when pole-sitter Bob Gordon of Orange stalled on the first lap. 
</P>
<P>
Teammates Lloyd Castle of Bellflower and Vince Tjelmeland of Yorba Linda 
finished 1-2 in the ultrastock final, boosting Tjelmeland's series lead over 
defending champion Jeff Elrod, of Campbell, Calif., who finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Marty Hart of El Cajon became the season's first repeat winner in the four- 
wheel ATV class, and Terry Peterson of Huntington Beach followed suit in the 
superlite final. Hart previously won at Seattle and Peterson at Anaheim.

Breakdown: The Minnesota Twins lost 11 of 12 games before beating Cleveland, 
malfunctioning on all fronts. A defense that last year set a major league 
record for fewest errors in a season, 84, made 11 in the 12 games, including 
five by third baseman Gary Gaetti, who made seven all last year. The offense, 
having produced 89 runs in a 9-5 start, produced 31 in the 1-11 collapse. 
Starting pitchers were 1-8 in the 12 games and relievers 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
Payroll: With the acquisition of Jesse Barfield, the New York Yankees are 
paying five right fielders $4,576,037, including Dave Winfield, who is on the 
disabled list, and Gary Ward, who was released. The ledger: Winfield, 
$1,958,652; Barfield, $1,015,385; Mel Hall, $875,000; Ward, $607,000, and Bob 
Brower, $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
What's in a Name?: Pete and Zane Smith are a combined 0-8 in 12 starts for the 
Atlanta Braves while the rest of the rotation is 10-3 in 16 starts. The Braves 
are 1-111 over the last two years in games they've trailed after eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
Revolving Door: Alex Madrid faces the Cincinnati Reds today, becoming the 
Philadelphia Phillies' ninth starting pitcher this year. Only five times has a 
Philadelphia starter gone more than four innings. 
</P>
<P>
Ink-Stained: Texas Ranger outfielder Pete Incaviglia had such hatred for the 
University of Texas when he was at Oklahoma State that he once challenged the 
entire Longhorn baseball team to a fight. Inky, however, has been no challenge 
to a pair of Texas products. He is 0-7 with seven strikeouts against the Boston 
Red Sox's Roger Clemens and 0-15 with nine strikeouts against the Cleveland 
Indians' Greg Swindell. Manager Bobby Valentine benched Incaviglia Friday night 
against Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Productive: Pedro Guerrero has driven in 53 runs in 71 games with the St. Louis 
Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Mismatch: The Oakland Athletics' Mike Moore has a 3-12 career record against 
the Toronto Blue Jays, has lost seven in a row to Toronto and is 1-8 in 
Exhibition Stadium, where he will never have to pitch again because the Sky 
Dome opens next month. 
</P>
<P>
Depth: Ten different pitchers have victories for the A's in their last 12 wins 
through Thursday. On another front: the A's have grounded into 33 double plays 
and are on a pace to break Boston's major league record of 171. ROSS NEWHAN

REDS WILL HAVE CHOICE: BRISTOL OR HELMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ross Newhan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"A contingency plan is not needed." 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Murray Cook of the Cincinnati Reds apparently said it with a 
straight face the other day when asked if he and owner Marge Schott has 
discussed a replacement for Manager Pete Rose if Rose is suspended for his 
gambling activities or associations. 
</P>
<P>
Don't believe it. Reds' management has discussed a variety of contingency plans 
throughout the Rose investigation. 
</P>
<P>
And now, with attorney John Dowd scheduled to deliver his report to 
Commissioner Bart Giamatti Wednesday and a decision by Giamatti expected a week 
or two later, the Reds' contingency plan seems to call for a choice between 
coaches Dave Bristol and Tommy Helms. 
</P>
<P>
Had it happened earlier, had there been a need to replace Rose before the 
season or in the first week or two, the Reds might have gone outside the 
organization, choosing, perhaps, from among several candidates still being 
rumored as in line: Chuck Tanner, Hal Lanier and Jim Fregosi, among them. 
</P>
<P>
Fregosi, idle since he was not retained as the Chicago White Sox manager, has 
been touted to Cook, former general manager of the Montreal Expos, by Montreal 
Manager Buck Rodgers, a longtime friend of Fregosi. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the likelihood is that management will respect continuity and 
stay within the family, choosing between Bristol and Helms, if a choice is 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Helms would seem the logical choice, having replaced Rose during his 30-day 
suspension for the run-in with umpire Dave Pallone last year, but logic does 
not always work with Schott. 
</P>
<P>
Helms recently went through a sticky divorce, and Schott is intent on 
projecting a family image. 
</P>
<P>
It is believed that she is leaning toward Bristol, if a manager is needed for 
the remainder of this season, and that she is determined to try to bring Sparky 
Anderson back to Cincinnati if she does not bring Rose back. 
</P>

Schott reportedly did not want to rehire Rose for 1989 but bowed to pressure 
from her minority owners and the fear of public reaction. Rose has a two-year 
contract but it is unlikely he will be retained by Schott if there is any kind 
of suspension. 
</P>
<P>
The flu kept Rose in Cincinnati Wednesday and Thursday when his Reds played in 
New York, under the direction of Helms. 
</P>
<P>
Of the media onslaught Rose would have faced in the Big Apple, Met Manager Dave 
Johnson said: "If he was sick, he'd have gotten a lot sicker here. I know the 
feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Alluding to the Reds' decision to put Eric Davis on the disabled list, Helms 
displayed a way with words. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, when you have your key dog out of there, you have to try and find 
the right combination," he said, hoping a platoon of Herm Winningham and 
Rolando Roomes is that combination. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets' Kevin Elster extended his streak of errorless games to 86 Saturday, a 
major league record for shortstops, but he was almost wishing it would end. The 
graduate of Marina High in Huntington Beach said he thinks it is affecting his 
hitting, of which he hasn't been doing much. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying that's the only reason I've struggled," he said of his .241 
average. "I'm not swinging the bat like I can. But it has had an effect on me. 
It's always there. I'm thinking about it all the time. 
</P>
<P>
"Like, if I have a bad at-bat, I'll say, 'It's OK. I'm doing the job on 
defense,' instead of getting ticked off and going out there next time and 
making up for that at-bat. The problem has been that I haven't been bringing a 
plan up to the plate. That's what I have to do. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying that when I make an error I'll bust out with 10 straight hits. 
But it has been on my mind." 
</P>
<P>
A former shortstop and manager and now a scout with the New York Yankees, Gene 
Michael said of Elster: "He's the best shortstop I've ever seen, as far as 
catching the ball. He's got such great hands and is always in position to field 
the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Responded Elster: "That's nice. Who's Gene Michael?" 
</P>
<P>
With three hits in his last 24 at-bats through Thursday and his batting average 
in the depressed neighborhood of .200, the Hit Man was depressed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating, frustrating, frustrating," Don Mattingly, New York Yankee 
first baseman, said. "I feel lost. I'm in a black hole and I can't see any 
light. Usually, I struggle in April but still hit .240 or .250 or .270. But 
this . . . I'd just like to put it behind me. Play the next 140 instead of 
thinking about the first 20. Can we start over again? Can we call the league 
president?" 
</P>
<P>
Mattingly broke out of it with three hits Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly at a loss is designated hitter Larry Sheets of the Baltimore Orioles, 
once considered one of the American League's most promising young hitters. 
</P>
<P>
That was when he was 27 and had 31 homers with 94 runs batted in and a .316 
average in 1987. His inexplicable drop-off last year was the biggest in 
baseball: 10 homers, 42 RBIs and a .230 average. 
</P>
<P>
Sheets is still struggling. He was three for 18 with runners in scoring 
position through Friday with a .216 average, seven RBIs and one home run. 
</P>
<P>
"I can sit on a pitch, get the pitch and still not hit it," he said. "I'm so 
frustrated I feel like I've never played the game before." 
</P>
<P>
Al Campanis trod on dangerous sociological ground again Wednesday night, when 
he visited Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda and wound up as a mediator in the 
Lasorda-Pedro Guerrero peace talks. Campanis alluded to Guerrero's spring 
criticism of Lasorda and said: 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes Latin people may say something when they're distraught and may not 
mean it." 
</P>
<P>
Campanis, of course, lost his job with the Dodgers when he appeared on the TV 
show, "Nightline," and said, among other things, that blacks may lack the 
necessities to manage in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
There is more to applaud Glenn Davis for than his single-handed attempt to 
carry the Houston Astros' offense. 
</P>
<P>
KTXH in Houston, the station that televises Astro games, uses a beer commercial 
every time a Houston player hits a homer. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, about the only Houston player who ever homers, told the station: "Don't 
do it with me." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he gave up alcohol after he was involved in an automobile accident 
as a teen-ager in which alcohol was a factor. He said he didn't like a message 
implying that beer was a reward for hitting a homer. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball, hypocritical in its verbal crackdown on substance abuse while 
encouraging beer sponsorship, could learn a lesson. 
</P>
<P>
The Kansas City Royals' 18-10 record before losing Saturday represented their 
best start. Can they keep it up without George Brett? He is not expected back 
until mid-June after tearing a ligament in his right knee, the 16th time he 
will have missed eight or more games because of injury. 
</P>
<P>
"It's different from years past," Manager John Wathan said. "Before, when 
George would get hurt, people would sit there wondering how are we going to win 
without him. I don't sense that now." 
</P>
<P>
The reason for Wathan's optimism is Luis de los Santos, recalled from Omaha to 
replace Brett. De los Santos was voted the American Assn.'s most valuable 
player last year when he hit .307 with 86 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
His two-run single in his first game Tuesday night enabled the Royals to defeat 
New York on the anniversary of the end of Lou Gehrig's streak of consecutive 
games. That prompted the Royals to needle Brett about being the new Wally Pipp, 
suggesting that he has lost his job permanently to de los Santos.

<P>
CONE GETS BACK AT ASTROS, 2-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unaccustomed as he became to losing last season when he came from nowhere to 
post the best record in the majors, David Cone has been disappointed in his 
start this season. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Mets' right-hander, pushed into the starting rotation last season 
after being 5-6 as a rookie reliever in 1987, finished with a 20-3 record. He 
did not lose his second game last season until July 4 and played a key role as 
the Mets won in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine his chagrin last Sunday when the light-hitting Houston Astros pounded 
him for seven hits and seven runs in 2 1/3 innings and handed him his second 
defeat this season. 
</P>
<P>
Cone was impressive against the Astros Saturday in New York when he pitched the 
Mets into first place with a 2-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Johnson's third-inning two-run home run gave Cone the runs he needed and 
he pitched a five-hitter, striking out eight, to improve his record to 3-2. In 
27 games, the Mets are 16-11 but have had only two complete games, both by 
Cone. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody was as cognizant of the change in Cone as Glenn Davis, the man who 
carries the Astros' offense. Sunday Davis tagged him for two hits. This time it 
was a mismatch. Cone struck him out four times. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked like Cy Young against me today," Davis said. "It was a combination 
of breaking stuff and me getting myself out with bad swings." 
</P>
<P>
Cone thought he might have turned everything around. "There's no better way to 
redeem yourself than to come back and pitch well against the team that beat 
you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros scored in the sixth and loaded the bases with one out in the 
seventh. But Cone induced Ken Caminiti to hit a grounder to second baseman 
Gregg Jefferies who turned it into a double play. The middle man was shortstop, 
Howard Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Davey Johnson is going to find a spot for the hot-hitting Johnson. 
After moving into the No. 2 spot in the order, Johnson has hit in 11 of 12 
games with five home runs and 14 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
It was a tough loss for Jim Clancy, facing the Mets for the first time. He 
escaped a first-inning jam largely because of the Mets' poor baserunning. But 
the one Met who faced him when he pitched for Toronto beat him. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I remembered him," Johnson said. "I had my first major league hit off 
him. I had gone 0 for 3 in Toronto when I singled against him. 
</P>
<P>
"I had told our players that Clancy would come right at you. He'll win a lot of 
games for them." 
</P>
<P>
Only if the Astros find some offense to go with Davis. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 9, St. Louis 0 -- Rick Reuschel, who will be 40 later this month, 
moved within a victory of No. 200 by giving up five hits in six innings to halt 
the Cardinals in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-six of Reuschel's victories have come since 1982, when everyone thought 
arm problems had ended his career. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he appears to be getting better with age. He won 19 for the Giants 
last season and is 5-2 despite aching knees this season. 
</P>
<P>
Reuschel, who departed with an 8-0 lead, left because he wants to save wear and 
tear on the knees. He will try for No. 200 at Montreal Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants jumped on Jose DeLeon and finished him off with six runs in less 
than two innings. DeLeon (5-2) came in having limited opponents to a .152 
average. He retired only five batters and gave up seven hits. 
</P>
<P>
"Jose was due for one of those," Cardinal Manager Whitey Herzog said. "He had 
nothing. Reuschel was the same as always. He throws a little slider, and a 
little sinker and he doesn't let you run." 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals also lost left fielder Vince Coleman, who strained his right 
hamstring beating out a bunt in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 13, Montreal 3 -- Only the Dodgers have a worse team batting average 
than the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves got 19 hits against Pascual Perez (0-4) and three other pitchers, 
including infielder Tim Wallach, en route to their fourth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Thomas drove in five runs at Atlanta, Jody Davis four and Lonnie Smith 
and Ron Gant hit home runs as the Braves improved to 14-17 and climbed out of 
the cellar in the West. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago the Braves were 9-22, 10 games behind and already talking about next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Wallach gave up an unearned run in one inning. Monday night in a 19-6 loss to 
Cincinnati, infielder Tom Foley took a turn on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 7, Philadelphia 4 -- Todd Benzinger hit a go-ahead single in the 
fifth inning at Cincinnati, and Paul O'Neill and Ron Oester each drove in two 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Schmidt drove in two runs for the Phillies, who twice wasted one-run leads 
and lost for the fifth time in six games. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt, who drove in 62 runs in 106 games last season, has driven in 24 in 28 
games this season. 
</P>
<P>
Padres 4, Pirates 2 -- Mark Parent, subbing for slumping Benito Santiago, drove 
in all four San Diego runs with a sacrifice fly and a three-run homer as the 
Padres ended a three-game losing streak at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Hurst (4-2) held Pittsburgh hitless until one-out doubles by Barry Bonds 
and Jose Lind in the sixth inning made the score 1-1. Hurst left after yielding 
one-out singles to Bonds and Lind in the eighth inning and Mark Davis went the 
rest of the way for his major leagues-leading 12th save in 12 opportunities.

NUNN'S SUCCESS BRINGS MANAGER INTO LIMELIGHT

<P>
Dan Goossen used to be humble. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, when his middleweight, Michael Nunn, was making $1,500 per fight, 
Goossen never seemed to have much to say. 
</P>
<P>
Now Nunn is the middleweight champion and making $1 million-plus per fight. He 
gets $5,000 for a personal appearance. And Goossen has become cocky. 
</P>
<P>
The other day, he was talking about a British promoter who was paying for Nunn 
and Goossen to fly first class to London for the Nigel Benn-Michael Watson 
middleweight fight May 21. 
</P>
<P>
Benn, who has reached the superstar level in England, will probably win. Then 
British tabloids will shriek for a Benn-Nunn bout. 
</P>
<P>
"How much would Nunn get for a Benn fight in London, Dan?" 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, I hate to talk about money figures," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"What about $3 million?" 
</P>
<P>
"Three million? Well, OK, that would certainly take care of our travel 
expenses. But there'd be other considerations, too." 
</P>
<P>
"Like what?" 
</P>
<P>
"Well, we'd want some seats in the Royal Family's box . . . " 
</P>
<P>
These days, Goossen has to find things for Nunn to do during the countdown for 
Nunn-Sugar Ray Leonard in 1990. Or is it '91? 
</P>
<P>
Goossen says he has all but wrapped up an August HBO appointment for Nunn 
against Iran Barkley, probably in Reno, with Atlantic City, N.J., still 
bidding. 
</P>
<P>
"Barkley is definitely Michael's next opponent, and Reno looks like the place," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn will make slightly more than $1 million and Barkley somewhere between 
$300,000 and $400,000, Goossen said. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn's dance card filled up quickly after his stunning 88-second, one-punch 
knockout of Sumbu Kalambay in March. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Nunn was inducted into the Iowa Hall of Fame. Monday, the Desert Inn 
sent a jet to Iowa to take him to Las Vegas for a personal appearance -- fee: 
$5,000 -- at a banquet honoring a Japanese businessman who donated $1 million 
to a children's hospital in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's the media, Goossen goes on, you have no idea how tough it is 
-- the demands on Michael's time by reporters . . . 
</P>
<P>
With heavyweight Frank Bruno having gone the way of all British heavyweights 
with his defeat by Mike Tyson, British boxing fans are focusing on Benn, a 
hard-hitting middleweight from London's suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
The London tabloids have worked themselves up to the froth level ("Boom Boom 
Benn," they call him) over Benn, who has knocked out all 22 opponents, 19 in 
the first or second round. 
</P>
<P>
Benn's May 21 bout in London will be his first U.S. television (NBC) 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Five boxers are in the top 10 in Sport Magazine's annual survey of the 100 
highest-paid athletes. Mike Tyson ($22,133,333), Michael Spinks ($13,500,000), 
Sugar Ray Leonard ($11,700,000) and Donnie LaLonde ($3,846,667) are ranked 
first through fourth. Larry Holmes ($2,800,000) is sixth, behind fifth-ranked 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar ($3,000,000), the highest-salaried team sport athlete, 
according to the survey. 
</P>
<P>
The Forum plays host to two attractive boxing shows within 48 hours next week. 
Saturday night, Julio Cesar Chavez and Roger Mayweather meet for Mayweather's 
World Boxing Council super-lightweight championship. On May 15, the card 
features a 12-round, $225,000 Forum super-lightweight tournament championship 
bout between Sammy Fuentes and Rodolfo Aguilar. 
</P>
<P>
Boxers from the Soviet Union may arrive in the United States to turn pro as 
soon as June. Bruce Silverglade, who runs Gleason's Gym in New York, said 
Thursday that his gym may be the training center for the Soviet boxers. New 
York promoter Lou Falcigno announced recently he has signed an agreement with 
the Soviet sports federation that would permit Soviet boxers to turn pro in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Canada's Lennox Lewis, who scored a mild upset at Seoul when he defeated 
American Riddick Bowe in the gold-medal bout of the super-heavyweight class, 
will turn pro in England. The London-born Lewis, 6-foot-3 and 215 pounds, 
signed with British manager Frank Maloney and will debut as a pro in London in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night's outdoor boxing show at Santa Ana Stadium recalls the heyday of 
outdoor boxing here, the late 1950s and early 1960s. The last major outdoor 
boxing show in the Southland was the 1967 Floyd Patterson-Jerry Quarry draw at 
the Coliseum, before 23,000. In 1958, when Patterson was the heavyweight 
champion, he defeated Roy Harris at old Wrigley Field. In the same park, three 
weeks later, 22,500 turned out to watch L.A. favorite Art Aragon get hammered 
by Carmen Basilio.

4,500 MARATHONERS TO COMPETE TODAY IN LONG BEACH RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 4,500 runners will compete in the eighth annual Long Beach Marathon 
today, starting at 7:30 a.m. in front of the Long Beach Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the field are runners in the Pacific Rim Championships, which 
feature entrants from 14 countries -- among them the Soviet Union, China, 
Japan, Indonesia and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's overall winner, Naek Sagala of Indonesia, is back this year, again 
competing in the Pacific Rim race. His winning time in last year's warm 
conditions was 2 hours 21 minutes 37 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Sagala is not the favorite, however. A Soviet runner has the fastest time of 
those entered, although there was some speculation whether the Soviets, who did 
not arrive as scheduled, would show up. Viktor Gural, a 27-year-old student, is 
the prohibitive favorite with his time of 2:11:30. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Dettmer of Anaheim, who was second in last year's race, is the top 
American with a time of 2:14:20. Jose Luis Chuela, 29, of Mexico, has a 
2:12:08. 
</P>
<P>
The women's race is decidedly weak. Irina Ruban, 27, of the Soviet Union has 
the fastest time, 2:30:40. Soviet teammate Tatiana Zueva, 31, has the field's 
second-best time, 2:32:30. Anita Johnson of Long Beach is the top American 
woman with a best time of 2:52:52. 
</P>
<P>
Race walkers will start at 7:20 and the wheelchair competitors at 7:25, at the 
corner of Long Beach and Ocean boulevards. JULIE CART

<P>
CRENSHAW CLAIMS THAT COSTLY SHOTS ARE NOT EASY TO FORGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It has been said that the average golfer has a selective memory, recalling only 
his few good shots in any round. 
</P>
<P>
The pros, though, are haunted by memories of bad shots at the worst possible 
times, or even circumstances beyond their control. 
</P>
<P>
After Scott Hoch had won the Las Vegas Invitational last Sunday, beating Robert 
Wrenn on the fifth hole of a playoff, he conceded that the pain of missing a 
two-foot putt while losing in the recent Masters playoff against Nick Faldo had 
eased slightly. 
</P>
<P>
"But the monkey will always be on my back," Hoch added, referring to the short 
putt that would have won the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Norman is constantly reminded that he hasn't won a "major" in the United 
States, even though he is acknowledged as one of the world's best golfers. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Norman has been star-crossed. He watched Larry Mize take the Masters title 
away from him with an incredible 140-foot chip shot in a playoff in 1987. It 
will be a while, if ever, before that memory fades away. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Crenshaw, who played last Monday at the Bel-Air Country Club in a 
fund-raising event for college golf, said that he has a skeleton of his own. 
</P>
<P>
"I've lived with a two-iron shot that I hit in the water in the 1975 U.S. Open 
when I had as good a chance to win as anybody," Crenshaw said. "Winning the 
Masters in 1984 makes that thought ebb somewhat, but I'll never forget that 
two-iron shot." 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw could also be brooding about the bogey he shot on the 18th hole of 
this year's Masters, which prevented him for getting into a playoff with Faldo 
and Hoch. 
</P>
<P>
But he seemed philosophical about his disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
The players were battling the elements, rain and descending darkness, near the 
finish of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked my caddie, Carl Jackson, if he had an extra towel in the bag to dry 
the clubs," Crenshaw said. "He said he did, but then he couldn't find it. He's 
been with me at the Masters for 13 or 14 years and he felt terrible about it." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Crenshaw's hand slipped on the club in his approach shot to 
the 18th green and he wound up in a bunker. He got out with a shot 10-12 feet 
from the pin, but missed the par putt that would have put him in the playoff. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball went right through the break," Crenshaw said. "The green wasn't as 
wet as I thought. What I didn't know was that they had just squeegeed the 
greens." 
</P>
<P>
Though Crenshaw is regarded as the tour's best putter, he missed the important 
putt. 
</P>
<P>
He held a putting clinic at Bel-Air and, as he talked about that part of the 
game, casually stroked in three consecutive putts from 20 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw had a three-week layoff after the Masters in early April. He said that 
he was emotionally drained by the tournament that he favors above all others. 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw, 37, is a golf traditionalist, who reveres the former masters, such as 
Bobby Jones, and courses with traditional values. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like going to a museum and looking at art," he said of his favorite 
courses, which include Riviera, Pebble Beach, Los Angeles Country Club's North 
course, Winged Foot, Pine Valley, Marion, and, of course, Augusta National. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very easy to build a hard golf course," Crenshaw said. "But it's another 
thing to build a course that people can enjoy. Average golfers have to have a 
route they can take on a course." 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw finished sixth on the money list last year, earning $696,895. He has 
yet to win a tournament this year and said that the tour is more competitive 
than it has been in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
"The players are just better. You're battling more odds now trying to win," 
Crenshaw said. "Regardless where you play, or what the conditions are, someone 
does something spectacular every day." 
</P>
<P>
In golf, the double-eagle is a rare species. Crenshaw says he has witnessed 
only one double eagle in his 16 years on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw Hal Sutton do it four years ago in a tournament at Dallas," Crenshaw 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A double eagle is three strokes under par on a par-five, or par-four hole. Of 
course, if accomplished on a par-four, it would also be a hole in one. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Sarazen's double-eagle in the 1935 Masters is generally acknowledged as 
the most renowned shot in tournament history. He holed out a 220-yard four-wood 
shot on the par-five, 485-yard 15th hole at Augusta. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, there have been only four double eagles recorded on the 
tour, in contrast with 52 holes in one. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Resner is not a touring pro, but he's a proud member of the double-eagle 
club. He recorded his April 28 at Bel-Air on the par-five, 460-yard first hole, 
using a seven-wood from 205 yards. Resner, a Princeton graduate student, has a 
12 handicap. He attended Pepperdine, but didn't play on the golf team, simply 
because the school didn't have one at the time.

Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ben Crenshaw participated in the Friends of Golf tournament Monday at Bel-Air, 
which raises money for college golf and funds some high school, junior golf and 
caddie programs. "It's a unique group of some 600 people, literally from around 
the world, who participate either by playing, or contributing," said Eddie 
Merrins, the pro at Bel-Air. Famous golfers who have previously appeared are 
Greg Norman, Arnold Palmer, Byron Nelson and Lee Trevino. 
</P>
<P>
"Scholarships were founded in their name in perpetuity at UCLA," said Merrins, 
who is retiring as the Bruins' golf coach after this season to devote more time 
to his duties at Bel-Air. Crenshaw's scholarship money will be divided between 
his alma mater, the University of Texas, and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Nicklaus will design his first course in Scotland, a 250-acre championship 
layout in Gleneagles. It will be a par-72, 7,100-yard complex. . . . Larry 
Gephart, teaching instructor at Industry Hills, is scheduling classes May 20-21 
in the full swing and May 27-28 in the short swing. . . . Sandi 
Alexander-Coffer won the Newport Beach Country Club women's championship April 
28 for the third consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
Chi Chi Rodriguez in Golf Digest on the prospect of Nicklaus and Trevino 
joining the senior tour: "When they come in, 10-under par on the tour will look 
like nothing. They'll probably be like Jesse James and Frank James on this 
tour. I'd just like to be their caddie." . . . Merrins said he has witnessed 
only one other double-eagle, by Doug Sanders, in his 25 years as the pro at 
Bel-Air. . . . Bob Burns, 21, set a Valencia Golf Club course record with a 65 
Thursday, 29-36. . . . The fourth annual NutraSweet tournament, benefiting the 
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, will be held Monday at Riviera Country Club.

MIZE SHOOTS A 63 TO TIE WITH LEVI

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps Wayne Levi should have looked at his television schedule. 
</P>
<P>
An unexpected and unusually early starting time threw Levi off his rhythm and 
opened the gates to a host of challengers Saturday in the third round of the 
$1-million Byron Nelson golf tournament at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Levi, who did not have a bogey in the first two rounds, had three in a round of 
68 and dropped into a tie for the lead with Larry Mize, who made a 25-foot 
birdie putt on the final hole for a 63. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't check the starting time," Levi said. "I figured noon at the earliest. 
Who ever heard of a last starting time of 10:50?" 
</P>
<P>
The unusually early weekend times were scheduled to enable television coverage 
to be completed before the start of the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't follow horses," Levi said. "When I found out, I had to rush. I didn't 
hit as many balls as I wanted to. I didn't putt as much as I wanted to." 
</P>
<P>
The co-leaders were at 13-under-par 197. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Nelson birdied two of his last three holes and shot a 67 that left him at 
198. 
</P>
<P>
Loren Roberts and Dave Rummells were next at 199. Roberts shot a 66 and 
Rummells a 67. 
</P>
<P>
Jody Rosenthal made six consecutive birdies to charge into the lead before bad 
weather halted play in the second round of the LPGA's Crestar tournament at 
Chesapeake, Va., for the second straight day. 
</P>
<P>
Half of the 136-player field was still on the Greenbrier Country Club course 
when lightning, rain and an approaching hailstorm forced play suspended with 
Rosenthal five under par with seven holes to play. 
</P>
<P>
The non-finishers will complete second-round play this morning, with the final 
18 holes to follow. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's round began with Betsy King and Juli Inkster tied for the lead after 
three-under-par 69s Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Inkster, the defending champion, had two birdies and a bogey, leaving her four 
under par through seven holes, but King dropped three strokes with a 
double-bogey and a bogey on the fifth and sixth holes, and was one under par. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Mowry shot a five-under-par 67 to take a one-stroke lead over Gay Brewer 
in a Senior PGA Tour tournament at San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
Mowry was at 11-under-par 133 after two trips around the Dominion Country Club 
course. Brewer, the first-round leader, shot a 69. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Henning, with a 65, and Miller Barber, who shot a 70, were next at 136.

<P>
THE PUBLIC LIFE OF OUR PUBLIC FIGURES BY WILLIAM F. BUCKLEY JR. (RANDOM HOUSE: 
$22.50; 499 PP., ILLUSTRATED; 0-394-57568-7) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Valenti, Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Assn. of America, is 
the author of The Bitter Taste of Glory (World), A Very Human President (W.W. 
Norton) and Speak Up With Confidence (William Morrow). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marcel Proust's housekeeper once declared that after working for Proust all 
others seemed quite vulgar. It is not unlikely that Bill Buckley feels the same 
way about William F. Buckley Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Buckley is more than "Everyman"; he is "Everywhere." His talents, protean is 
the only word for them, were never more vividly exhibited than in his own 
account, in the New Yorker magazine some years ago, of his "work week." The 
velocity of Buckley in action resembles nothing so much as a cyclone rakishly 
invading the culture of a neighborhood. Sailor, editor, publisher, columnist, 
novelist, political philosopher, essayist, social critic, conservative grouser, 
apostate Yalie, he is the contemporary mirror of a Renaissance man moored 
somewhere between Voltaire and Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
But it is television that catapulted Buckley so grandly from a mistily observed 
right-of-center grand vizier to a public icon, only slightly less publicized 
than Geraldo Rivera. And it is his "Firing Line," public television's longest 
running program (it began in 1966, predating Public TV) that is Buckley's 
national rostrum. 
</P>
<P>
This volume is an exegesis of the best of "Firing Line," assembling mannerly 
and witty exchanges between Buckley and his guests, smeared generously with 
what Buckley would call "orgulous" musings. 
</P>
<P>
I am not one to reread in hard cover that which has been published in daily 
newspapers or performed on TV. A merry band of syndicated columnists makes a 
nice living stirring old porridge. But I exempt "On the Firing Line." If you 
enjoy literary karate chops, delivered with elegance, this book is for you. 
Dullness is the one sin for which there is no expiation. Whatever one thinks of 
Bill Buckley, and the possibilities are tauntingly delicious, he is rarely 
dull. 
</P>
<P>
You have to picture Buckley on the tube, clipboard on his lap, lounging 
indolently, casting a half-lidded gaze at his high-powered guests, 
interrogating them with an intermittent patrician stammer which is genetically 
connected to high-born Englishmen, and then spearing them with a lance dipped 
in curare while they haplessly flap about in some confusion. But often Buckley 
extracts from his guests the best that is in them. 
</P>
<P>
Consider that celebrated White House aide and recent felon, G. Gordon Liddy, 
discoursing on violence in the community: "The experience of mankind is that 
the big fish eat the little fish, that Jaws is still out there, not Charlie 
Tuna." 
</P>
<P>
Or Al Capp, the creator of "Li'l Abner" when Buckley queried him about a 
Harvard dean: "And what caused Dean Monroe, in your opinion, to make this error 
in judgment?" 
</P>
<P>
Says Capp: "Because he's a fathead." 
</P>
<P>
One of Buckley's favorite guests is the famous professor, John Kenneth 
Galbraith, who when he unreels himself is some 6 feet 8. Ostensibly ideological 
enemies, in real life Buckley and Galbraith are neighbors in the posh Swiss 
countryside where they repair each year to unburden themselves of yet another 
published volume. 
</P>
<P>
When Buckley chastises Galbraith about lying about with his hatchet on the 
corporate rich, Galbraith lobs this one: "One of the marvelous good fortunes of 
being an author that I share with Buckley is that authors, unlike automobile 
companies, are not yet required to recall their defective works." 
</P>
<P>
When Rosalyn Tureck, renowned harpsichordist and pianist, comes aboard, she 
recounts a famous pianist who performs for recordings the C-Minor Chopin in 
about 3,000 takes so that innocent listeners would believe it was a seamless 
web of excellence. Said Buckley: "He should have left in one mistake to make it 
plausible!" 
</P>
<P>
Every now and then a guest scores. Witness Michael Kinsley, editor of the New 
Republic magazine. Said Kinsley to Buckley, "I have a reform for you and it 
sounds so perverse I think you will like it." 
</P>
<P>
Buckley impales Robert Schrum, one of the finest artisans of the political 
speech, with this: "Mr. Schrum, you spent a lot of time in the opening program 
to discuss this question. I would like to take you seriously, but to do so 
would be to affront your intelligence." 
</P>
<P>
So it goes. Go buy "On the Firing Line." If you don't summon up a few chuckles 
and/or an ascending sense of enjoyment, you've got the ranch, the drugstore and 
the bowling alley. One confession. I am now, always have been, a fan of Bill 
Buckley, so factor in that bias when you make your own assay.

CRISIS IN THE LIFE OF AN OLD ACTOR; 
</P>
<P>
LAST CALL BY HARRY MULISCH; TRANSLATED BY ADRIENNE DIXON (VIKING: $19.95; 288 
PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Stewart Lindh, Lindh is a frequent contributor to the Los Angeles Times Book 
Review. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The house of translation has many rooms. Some are large, like French; others 
small. How fortunate when the door of a smaller room -- here the Dutch -- opens 
and a work of art emerges. 
</P>
<P>
If English were Harry Mulish's native language, he would need no introduction. 
His reputation would be as established as the quality of his writing and the 
subtlety of his plots; however, only in 1985, with the publication of "The 
Assault," were American readers given their first opportunity to read this 
exceptional novelist. 
</P>
<P>
Now with "Last Call," Mulisch again offers us a remarkable work. A rigorously 
condensed tale, this novel is like an onion being peeled away by the narrator's 
hands, until nothing is left -- then the peeling continues, undoing the very 
fabric of nothing itself. 
</P>
<P>
Translation is like reaching into a stream to retrieve a bright-colored fish 
and instead holding up a gray stone. The operation of lifting living language 
out of its habitat petrifies words, no matter how skillful the translation. 
</P>
<P>
A critic must remember that the language used to translate a novel is closer to 
this side of experience, reading, than the other, writing. In the case of "Last 
Call," Adrienne Dixon has worked hard to preserve the linguistic integrity of 
Mulisch's brilliant tour de force. 
</P>
<P>
The protagonist, Uli Bouwmeester, 78, was an unsuccessful actor in his youth. 
During World War II, he entertained Dutch SS soldiers and was ostracized by the 
theatrical community after the war. 
</P>
<P>
Now widowed and living with a sister in the Dutch polder, that blank landscape 
seized from the sea, Uli exists in an atmosphere that recalls Beckett or Pinter 
-- two souls waiting for death in a cold house filled with nothing but 
recrimination, remorse and brittle memories. 
</P>
<P>
Uli's life is a set stripped to the bone. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly comes a call to enter into a different dramatic universe, one much 
closer to Pirandello. Uli is visited by two strangers who offer him the lead in 
a new play. With his last role, Uli realizes that he can transform a lifetime 
of small parts into an oeuvre. 
</P>
<P>
Soon Uli senses that the role for which he has been chosen reverberates with 
louder and louder echoes from his own past. The play is that most dangerous of 
devices -- a dramatic Ouroboros -- a play within a play within a play. Uli is 
to portray the early 20th-Century Dutch actor Pierre de Vries, giving his 
farewell performance in "The Tempest," itself a play effacing the difference 
between reality and illusion. There is linkage not only from Uli to Pierre, but 
from them to Prospero as well. 
</P>
<P>
The meshing of the plays with Uli's life forces dark secrets from his past. In 
playing another, Uli is truly revealing himself. As he enters into his role, 
the hidden parts of his life emerge -- and we see a human iceberg rising before 
us. 
</P>
<P>
Moving closer and closer to his last call, Uli believes that he will soon 
appear on the stage as though before the extended audience of his life and at 
last receive the critical vindication he deserves -- as person and actor. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, waiting in the wings is reality, which through three different tragic 
encounters, usurps Uli's hopes and replaces them with an awareness that the 
final curtain is doming down before it had a chance to go up. 
</P>
<P>
A stunning remark is made by the play's director (himself a character in the 
narrator's mind -- again, a role created by Mulisch): 
</P>
<P>
". . . An actor never crawls into the skin of a character. That is an old 
misconception. The character must crawl into his skin. As an actor you do not 
become another person, the other person becomes you." 
</P>
<P>
The reader of "Last Call" finds himself a telescopic audience -- viewing 
simultaneous performances of Uli's life, memories and relieved past, mixed with 
that of De Vries' role and Prospero's magical part. 
</P>
<P>
"Last Call" is not the sort of book one can put down to later pick up -- 
without feeling confused, much as the protagonist does, riddled with the 
question: Not, where am I? But who? 
</P>
<P>
This labyrinth of a novel offers only the frayed string of a narrative to help 
the reader find his way. If there is an Ariadne, it is Mulisch himself -- 
removed, waiting for the reader to emerge from his a-maze-ing novel with a new 
awareness of role, character, personality and part. These terms of the theater 
and psychology become so thoroughly blended that we do not know how to answer 
Yeats' haunting question: "Are we anything more than the masks that we wear?" 
</P>
<P>
In Zen gardens -- no matter where one sits in relation to the stones -- one is 
always missing. Move as one will, a stone remains unseen. 
</P>
<P>
The whole is forever beyond our grasp. 
</P>
<P>
Uli's life seen through the magnificent rehearsal of "Last Call" is an 
extraordinary attempt to locate the missing stone . . . or is it soul?

THE GENESIS OF A MASTERPIECE; 
</P>
<P>
PICASSO'S GUERNICA HISTORY, TRANSFORMATIONS, MEANINGS BY HERSCHEL B. CHIPP 
(UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRESS: $37.50; 248 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Hugh Thomas, Thomas is the author of Spanish Civil War (Harper &amp; Row). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guernica, as everyone now knows, is a small town in the Basque provinces. It 
was heavily bombed, unexpectedly, in the course of the Spanish civil war by 
German aircraft in the service of Gen. Francisco Franco's nationalist forces 
advancing on Bilbao. About half the town was flattened and about 1,000 people 
were killed. The Basques had no aircraft for defense. 
</P>
<P>
The outrage does not seem large by the standards of later years, but, at the 
time, there was a real outcry. Friends of the Spanish Republic seized on the 
event as an indication of how far the Nazi air force would go in pursuit of 
power. The protest was such that the Spanish nationalist propaganda department 
in Burgos fabricated an extraordinary tale claiming that the Basques themselves 
had blown up Guernica. 
</P>
<P>
It was not possible to check or expose this story, because Franco's troops 
occupied the town a day or two later. But in Paris, a city where the 
international protest had been the most vehement, Pablo Picasso, a resident for 
many years, set about his famous painting that makes the name of this Basque 
town a historic landmark. 
</P>
<P>
The full story of Picasso's painting is well told in a beautiful and scholarly 
volume by Herschel B. Chipp, professor of art history at UC Berkeley. The 
originality of the book is threefold: First, and most important, he integrates 
the history of the painting with the history of the Spanish civil war and its 
aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
Second, he discusses in a way that no one else has, to my knowledge, the 
various inspirations of Picasso for the painting. (These were not all 
political, since Picasso was not a political person and had only once before, 
in the series "The Dream and Lie of General Franco," ventured into painting 
that was connected with contemporary events.) 
</P>
<P>
Third, the book is sumptuously illustrated with 50 large plates and a great 
many smaller ones that illustrate the possible influences on Picasso at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Chipp does not allow himself to be drawn into any new interpretation of the 
events leading to the destruction of Guernica. This is rather a pity, for there 
still remain, 51 years after the event, questions of whether Franco knew of the 
bombing before it happened, and whether, if he did, he was aware of the sacred 
meaning the town held in Basque life. My guess is that he did not know either. 
</P>
<P>
The background to the concealment of the Guernica affair is also something that 
I should myself like to know more about. I suspect, however, that Luis Bolin, 
who seemed a most courteous man when I knew him as Spanish consul general in 
New York in the 1960s, carried that secret with him to the grave. But whoever 
thought up this propagandistic tale could scarcely have believed that it would 
be fewer than 33 years before the truth would begin to be told in Spain by 
writer Vicente Talon, whom Chipp quotes. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the book has two exceptionally revealing chapters on how 
"Guernica" traveled from the Museum of Modern Art in New York to Madrid in 
1981. The complexities attending this great return were compounded by the 
desire of Picasso to return the painting to a republican, not just a free, 
Spain. But then, on one occasion, he gave conflicting instructions. This was 
all sorted out successfully by lawyers, among whom Roland Dumas, now foreign 
minister of France, seems to have played a main part. MOMA deserves 
congratulations for its intelligent forbearance in the affair. 
</P>
<P>
As for the art criticism in the book, Chipp is particularly illuminating in his 
discussion of where "Guernica" fitted in the series of paintings, or drawings, 
in which Picasso had explored, before 1937, the theme of bullfighting. His 
tauromaquiacal phase was, in 1937, just ending. 
</P>
<P>
The reader also may be interested to know the extent to which the appearance of 
women in the painting can be related to Picasso's previous depictions of his 
then-companion Marie-Therese Walter. Walter had not long before she finally 
supplanted Picasso's wife, Olga, but soon would be dethroned herself by Dora 
Maar. 
</P>
<P>
The analysis of the criticisms that "Guernica" received at the time is 
interesting too -- particularly the patronizing blast delivered at the Spanish 
artist by an arch-conventional critic of Marxist persuasion, Anthony Blunt. 
</P>
<P>
The notes and appendices in the book seem to be a model of careful scholarship. 
Included also is a copy of the accounts that the Spanish Embassy in Paris kept 
in 1937 showing that Picasso netted the sum of 150,000 francs for his expenses.

FICTION IN BRIEF: THE SHOPLIFTER'S APPRENTICE BY ELLEN LESSER (SIMON &amp; 
SCHUSTER: $16.95; 127 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Did he find her "lovely"? one of Ellen Lesser's protagonists wonders while 
posing nude for a painter. "When he looked at her shoulder, delicately 
rendered, was he thinking of her?" Lesser's sensitive characters often cast 
about this way for signs of who they are and what they want. Rather than 
experiencing the sudden epiphanies that lend drama to the lives of many fiction 
characters, however, they, like real people, must make do with only glimpses of 
self-discovery. 
</P>
<P>
These glimpses (also as in real life) are often taken reluctantly. Rachel's 
feelings are ambivalent, for instance, when the husband of her old college 
friend Susan enters the room just as Rachel was about to tell her how "so much 
of herself was suspended, how she seemed still to be only paying her dues . . . 
while other people were actually living." "She greeted the sight of him with a 
mixture of indignation and relief," Lesser writes. "She felt strangely 
vulnerable, precarious, as though she'd come to the brink of something and 
wasn't sure whether she was being held back or saved." 
</P>
<P>
Lesser affirms her character's indecision as natural and necessary in these 
gentle stories, subtly illustrating how a certain degree of reserve can help 
bind us to the human community. In the title story, for example, Rachel sees a 
"strangely handsome" man filch a champagne bottle from a store. More nervous 
than he, she flees the store, but after sleeping with him that night, she comes 
to envy his wealth of stolen amenities. Eventually, that "fine veil" separating 
her hands from the merchandise falls away, allowing her to take at will and 
stimulating a "rush of chemicals (that) wasn't only fear, it was a terrible 
freedom. Anything could happen now." By becoming so strong-headed, Lesser 
implies, the woman also has become isolated, unable to show vulnerability and 
thus, unable to receive love.

FICTION IN BRIEF: THE DREAMS OF ZOO ANIMALS BY VALMAI HOWE (ST. MARTIN'S:

Ever since Freud demonstrated that people actually do not grow apart from 
family when they come-of-age -- they merely try to recreate as father and 
mother the social dynamics that ordered their lives as son and daughter -- 
novelists concerned with individual freedom have been busy engineering ways for 
their characters to escape the familial trap. Most prominent among them today 
is John Fowles, whose dauntless heroines surmount even love to "find their 
freedom," often making Jell-O out of noblemen in the process. Sarah, Valmai 
Howe's protagonist, continues in this tradition, although at the beginning of 
this novel (which has been nominated for the Canadian Book Award), she emerges 
as the most gentle of girls: At her most mischievous, she takes a few sea 
creatures from rock pools as "prisoners," carefully keeping them in water and 
returning them after an hour. 
</P>
<P>
After taking a summer job as a maid at a resort to gain some distance from her 
dominating father, Sarah falls in love with Leon, the resort's medical officer. 
An intense, lachrymose young man, Leon eventually suffers a nervous breakdown, 
however, breaking into a zoo the two had visited and killing a lion they had 
seen in a cramped cage "to put him out of his misery." While Leon is in jail 
for the crime, Sarah decides to leave Australia and live permanently in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah's decision is presented as a courageous way of preventing herself from 
being subsumed by another, but it seems more likely to prevent her identity 
from fully flowering. Sarah's personality, after all, is almost singularly 
defined by her caring, symbiotic relationship with Leon and several other 
friends; in departing so abruptly, she seems to contemn this central dimension 
of her identity. Sarah's mistake lies in failing to realize that human 
character is defined in relation to other people, not in complete isolation 
from them. 
</P>
<P>
"The Dreams of Zoo Animals" has other flaws -- dialogue is often incidental, 
for example, and provocative issues are raised and then abruptly dismissed -- 
but this novel remains compelling for its seemingly earnest text: believable, 
one suspects, because Howe, like Sarah, left Australia as a young adult to 
begin again in America.

CORNER POETRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So the Book review has finally given up on poetry altogether. Congratulations. 
Not only do you can the reviews. The next thing I know main man Eder 
offhandedly informs us that an epigram like " 'To write poetry after Auschwitz 
is barbaric' " is "a form of poetry, of course." (Book Review, April 16). And 
who finally shows up in your Poetry Corner but that longtimeman of letters 
Randy Newman. 
</P>
<P>
Excuse me, but wasn't it Pound who said good poetry should be as well-written 
as good prose? Newman is a talented songwriter, a talent of a higher order than 
most of the "poets" you print. But he's better off in the Calendar section with 
his blood relatives than lurking around in your "What's Cute This Week" Corner.

Peter Hebbethwaite's review of Penny Lernoux's "People of God" was beneath your 
usual standards. Knowing your preference for "authority" reviewers who are 
authors or chairs of commissions and universities, I can see why you chose 
Lernoux's colleague at the Reporter, but I don't know why you persisted in 
printing the review you received. We find out very little about the book 
reviewed, much more about the book reviewer. 
</P>
<P>
I disagree with much of Lernoux's thesis, but I think she makes a cogent case 
and the review you ran failed to do it justice.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: CAPOTE A BIOGRAPHY BY GERALD CLARKE (BALLANTINE BOOKS:

Gerald Clarke spent nearly nine years interviewing and recording Truman Capote. 
He spoke as well to nearly everyone who knew the man, and he had exclusive 
access to Capote's unpublished letters and segments of Capote's unpublished 
writings and notes. 
</P>
<P>
Capote's life had a less-than-auspicious start: His parents' honeymoon "skidded 
to a halt" when his father, Arch Persons, ran out of money and put his bride, 
Lillie Mae, on a train and sent her home to Monroeville, Ala. As the marriage 
also skidded to a halt, Lillie Mae discovered that she was pregnant and, though 
determined to have an abortion, was unable to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Truman was reared largely by Lillie Mae's cousins, three middle-aged sisters. 
</P>
<P>
Capote worked as a copyboy at The New Yorker, and his earliest dream was to be 
published there, but he was ultimately fired (he inadvertently insulted Robert 
Frost). Instead his first works were published in women's magazines: Harper's 
Bazaar and Mademoiselle. 
</P>
<P>
Thus a meteoric career was launched and propelled itself through American and 
European high society, until it finally sputtered out in dissolution, 
alcoholism and despair. 
</P>
<P>
"Capote's last years ran out in a chaos of alcohol, drugs and scabrous scenes 
with a series of lovers," Richard Eder wrote in these pages. "Clarke's detail 
throughout is prodigious."

Quinn is presumably at work on his fiction (he's had short stories published in 
The New Yorker) in his Boston apartment, and sees his wife, Claire (a professor 
at Williams College), only on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
It is Quinn's natural curiosity, his penchant for snooping (living proof, in 
Claire's view, that he is a born novelist) that inspires him to follow home a 
well-heeled woman he has seen shoplift a purse at Bonwit Teller. After "the 
Criminal WASP from Beacon Hill" gets in her front door, Quinn turns around to 
find that he's been followed as well by a man in a gray suit -- who 
propositions him sexually. 
</P>
<P>
"Shoplifter" is actually a sanguine description of Sarah Slade: She has 
previously killed and mutilated a lover but never served time because she 
pleaded temporary insanity. The gray-suited man, Angelo, is the brother-in-law 
and lover of Sarah's brother, Porter, and also Sarah's protector. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah and Quinn will become involved, and Sarah's story will evolve into 
Quinn's novel. 
</P>
<P>
"Normality . . . and monstrosity are L'Heureux's poles, and he joins them with 
extraordinary dexterity," Richard Eder wrote in his review. "The ending is not 
to be revealed, other than to say that it is bloody and grotesque and that 
normality and monstrosity become utterly indistinguishable."

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: LIBBY THE ALASKAN DIARIES &amp; LETTERS OF LIBBY BEAMAN,

At Libby Beaman's request for a favor from "Father's old friend," President 
Rutherford B. Hayes, her husband, John, was appointed assistant agent 
overseeing the seal-fur trade in the Alaskan Pribilof Islands. Libby would be 
the first white woman to sail to these distant islands, much against the will 
of her husband's superior, identified only as the "Senior Agent, SA." More 
difficult than being "icebound, rockbound, weather-bound" during that first 
year was the fact that Libby and John would live in a single cabin with the 
senior agent. 
</P>
<P>
The senior agent's presence in the cabin caused constant friction: John was 
extremely jealous and it was clear that the senior agent found Libby 
attractive. In her journals, Libby admits that she reciprocated his interest, 
though their passion was never acted upon. 
</P>
<P>
Betty John, Libby's granddaughter, collected the journals and letters into this 
fascinating volume, in whose epilogue she reveals the identity of the 
mysterious senior agent: Harrison Gray Otis, who returned to California and in 
1882 founded the Los Angeles Daily Times, which later became the Los Angeles 
Times.

5.2% JOBLESS RATE TAKEN AS SIGN OF COOLING ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's unemployment rate bolted to 5.2% in April -- up from 4.9% in March 
-- the government reported Friday, providing dramatic confirmation that the 
economy is slowing visibly. But analysts said it still is too early to tell 
whether a recession is in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
The jump marked the second time this year that the monthly jobless rate has 
risen. The number of new jobs that the economy created also slowed markedly, 
edging up a scant 117,000 over the month -- about half the growth that 
economists had expected. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's financial markets, which had feared that the economy's earlier 
overheating might prompt the Federal Reserve Board to push interest rates up 
further, welcomed the news as a sure sign that the central bank would not 
tighten any further. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials soared more than 20 points immediately 
after the figures were announced -- although profit-taking eventually sent the 
index plunging. The Dow closed at 2,381.96, or 2.94 points below its level on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dollar Fell Sharply 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell sharply but later recovered. Traders said that if the Fed 
seemed likely to raise interest rates, the U.S. currency would have climbed 
still higher. 
</P>
<P>
The White House sought to play down the April rise. Press Secretary Marlin 
Fitzwater said the economy "continues to grow with low inflation. It's a very 
positive economic outlook." 
</P>
<P>
But economists were divided on whether the slowing would lead to a recession. 
Jerry Jordan, economist for First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, said the 
economy now "has downshifted substantially. Everybody's in the process of 
revising their numbers down." 
</P>
<P>
Roger Brinner, economist with Data Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass., 
cautioned that the economy still has a lot of momentum from earlier months and 
may end up slowing only enough to lessen inflation pressures. "This is not a 
sign of a recession in progress," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Labor Department analysts noted one reason that the unemployment rate jumped so 
sharply was that the economy was beset by a larger than usual number of new 
job-seekers -- 395,000 in all -- some of whom may have been fearful that 
opportunities would fade if the economy continued to slow. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, manufacturing firms -- themselves uncertain about the outlook 
-- merely scheduled more overtime rather than hiring more workers immediately. 
The length of the average workweek rose by 0.4 of an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Janet L. Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, pointed out 
that in conditions such as today's, the jobless rate can be erratic. "We have 
had two other occasions during this long expansion" when the jobless rate rose 
and then declined again, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lowest in 16 Years 
</P>
<P>
The number of new payroll jobs created in April was the smallest since mid-1986 
-- and about a third of the average that has prevailed over the last several 
months. The jobless rate in March -- 4.9%, down from 5.1% in February -- had 
been the lowest in almost 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
In a sign that inflation pressures are returning, the report showed that 
average hourly earnings of factory workers rose 0.7% in April after climbing by 
0.3% for the two previous months. Such increases for workers may later push up 
the prices for the goods being produced. Still, Norwood insisted that wage 
patterns often occur "in fits and starts." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts suggested that at least some of the changes in the April report may 
have been exacerbated by statistical problems. The Easter holiday fell in March 
this year instead of April, distorting the department's procedures for 
adjusting the figures for seasonal patterns. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, some analysts believe the job data may prove more buoyant in May 
and early summer. David D. Hale, economist for Kemper Financial Services of 
Chicago, said Friday he thought the markets had "overreacted" to Friday's news. 
"It's still a gray area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Norwood conceded that the April slowdown "is real. While we are not 
getting net job losses, we are creating far fewer jobs than we were even a few 
months ago," she said. "And few industries are significantly expanding their 
employment." 
</P>
<P>
As has been the case in recent months, the bulk of the increase in new jobs 
came in the service industries, such as medical care and wholesaling. 
Employment in construction and in manufacturing remained flat. Job levels in 
electrical equipment and lumber actually declined. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the increase in joblessness came among adult men, whose 
unemployment rate jumped four-tenths of a percentage point to 4.6%. The rate 
for Latinos jumped to 8.3% over the month, wiping out a similar-sized decline 
in March. Rates for other groups were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
At Late-1988 Level 
</P>
<P>
The April rise brought the total number of workers out of jobs to 6.55 million, 
up from 6.13 million in March. The level is about the same that prevailed 
during most of the final three months of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In an assessment that appeared to reflect the views of most economists, Jordan 
said that the increase in joblessness "removed any lingering chance" that the 
Fed would decide to push interest rates up further when it meets later this 
month to map out its future strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Jordan sees interest rates declining later in 1989 -- possibly by as 
much as 2 to 3 percentage points by the year-end. 
</P>
<P>
The 5.2% figure for the April unemployment rate is compiled to include those 
members of the armed forces who live in the United States. An alternative 
measure that does not count servicemen and women in the total showed the rate 
at 5.3%, compared to 5.0% in March.

PRESIDENT'S 'KINDER, GENTLER' PHRASE IS TAKING A BEATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOLE, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When George Bush coined the phrase "kinder, gentler nation," he probably didn't 
know it would catch on. And on, and on, and on. 
</P>
<P>
In Detroit, new road signs admonish motorists to be "kinder, gentler, safer 
drivers." In Windsor, Ontario, a strip joint advertises itself as a "kinder, 
gentler adult entertainment center." 
</P>
<P>
Recently in Phoenix -- one year after he was impeached for misusing funds and 
obstructing justice -- former Gov. Evan Mecham vowed to run again and lead "a 
kindler, gentler Arizona." 
</P>
<P>
And in South Carolina, plumber Curt Whisennant has erected a billboard on U.S. 
1 in Columbia advertising his ABCOE Plumbing Co. as a "kinder, gentler plumbing 
company." 
</P>
<P>
That may not have been what the now-President Bush had in mind when candidate 
Bush first used the phrase in his acceptance speech at the Republican National 
Convention last August. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lampooned by Cartoonists 
</P>
<P>
The "kinder and gentler" saying and Bush's "thousand points of light" remark 
frequently have been lampooned by cartoonists and others who have poked fun at 
the attempt at presidential poetry. 
</P>
<P>
But the phrase isn't without fans. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's probably going to be more successful than 'Where's the beef?' " 
said Charlie Claggett, chief creative officer for the advertising agency D'Arcy 
Masius Benton &amp; Bowles in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's the beef?" was the Wendy's hamburger restaurant slogan co-opted during 
a 1984 presidential candidate debate by Democratic nominee Walter F. Mondale 
against then-President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
"The trend today is toward neo-traditional values. When Bush made that speech, 
I thought, 'My God, this man is reading the same research we are.' And, of 
course, he is," Claggett said. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Claggett said: "I wouldn't dare go over to Anheuser-Busch and suggest 
they advertise a 'kinder, gentler beer.' How kind and gentle can we be, 
anyway?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's Madison Avenue' 
</P>
<P>
The phrase "meets a desperate human need at a time when you can step out of 
your house in Washington, D.C., and get shot down by cocaine sellers," said Ray 
Browne, head of the popular culture department at Bowling Green State 
University in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for something to save us from ourselves," Browne said. "It's a 
Madison Avenue phrase. I don't know who cooked it up, but it's tremendous." 
</P>
<P>
It was Bush's idea, said B. J. Cooper, deputy White House press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed to capture the kind of tone he wanted for his presidency," Cooper 
said. "He's often joked about it. . . . But he's also very well-defined what 
those two phrases are supposed to mean." 
</P>
<P>
That's nonsense, Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is more than a rhetorical honeymoon -- it's a deliberate attempt to grab 
an element of human emotion and exploit it," he said, conceding, "I don't know 
what . . . it means." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Mariutce, executive creative director for DDB Needham Worldwide in New 
York City, agreed: "Slogans like this are like Chinese food. They're good, but 
they leave you hungry for something with more substance later." 
</P>
<P>
Hungry or not, the phrase is finding varying degrees of usage in serious 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
In February, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh vowed to take a "rougher, tougher 
attitude" toward violent drug traffickers to achieve Bush's goal of a "kinder, 
gentler America." 
</P>
<P>
And in New Orleans last month, students at Tulane and Loyola Universities wrote 
Bush that their attempts to rescue nine monkeys from a primate research center 
were their contributions to a "kinder, gentler nation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Perhaps More Gentile 
</P>
<P>
When Arizona's Republican Party passed a resolution last year declaring the 
United States a Christian nation, House Minority Leader Art Hamilton said 
Republicans probably misunderstood Bush and thought that he had called for a 
kinder, more Gentile nation. 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, insist that "kinder and gentler" is completely overworked and 
should be avoided as the worst of cliches. 
</P>
<P>
The phrase has been nominated for next year's Dishonour List of Words Banished 
from the English Language, compiled annually at Lake Superior State University 
in Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., spokesman Bill Crawford said. Bush's "read my lips" 
quote made the 1989 list. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say it's got a good shot at making the list, because one of the criteria 
is overuse," Crawford said.

<P>
Bucking the global trend, a chain of Pacific islands is eyeing a 
multimillion-dollar plan to import American garbage. 
</P>
<P>
While countries around the world are giving a thumbs down to the international 
trade in waste, the Marshall Islands sees profit and possible salvation from a 
plan to import up to one-tenth of the nontoxic waste produced on the West 
Coast. 
</P>
<P>
The waste would be used as landfill to enlarge the chain of remote, low-lying 
atolls. In return, the Marshall Islands would also get millions of dollars in 
fees for the trash. 
</P>

The nation's parliament passed a resolution in March authorizing President 
Amata Kabua to negotiate a deal with a California-based company to ship 
millions of tons of rubbish. 
</P>
<P>
Several other Pacific islands have recently turned down similar deals offered 
by U.S. firms to dispose of trash. 
</P>
<P>
Admiralty Pacific Inc., a waste disposal company, hopes to begin transporting 
garbage to the Marshalls, 4,200 miles southwest of the United States, by June, 
1990, and eventually ship tens of millions of tons a year. 
</P>
<P>
Kabua, who first endorsed the scheme last October after meeting with Admiralty 
officials, says he wants the garbage for the money and for badly needed 
landfill in the archipelago. 
</P>
<P>
The atolls cover a 70-square-mile area and few of its islands rise more than 5 
feet above the sea. 
</P>
<P>
But the environmentalist group Greenpeace is accusing the company, which says 
it wants to ship 10% of household waste produced on the U.S. West Coast, of 
trying to evade American regulations on waste disposal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
International Treaty 
</P>
<P>
Most of the world's nations reached agreement on March 22 in Basel, 
Switzerland, on an international treaty to control the export of hazardous 
waste. 
</P>
<P>
The convention aimed to curb what African countries called "garbage 
imperialism," dumping of waste by the West in the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
Admiralty's owner, Dan Fleming, says the company will respect Majuro and 
Washington safety laws in shipping the waste to the Pacific nation, an 
operation he says will be cheaper than transporting it by land to other parts 
of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Imported waste is not a new concept to the 43,000 inhabitants of the Marshall 
Islands, a double chain of low-lying coral atolls that Washington used as a 
nuclear testing site in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
Some 66 nuclear weapons were exploded on Bikini and Enewetak atolls at that 
time, and some areas are still uninhabitable due to radiation contamination. 
</P>
<P>
The islands were a former United Nations Trust Territory administered by 
Washington until gaining semi-independence in 1986. They depend on U.S. aid for 
90% of their government budget. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Majuro's Parliament hotly debated the resolution on the garbage plan 
before passing it on March 10 by a 20-3 majority. Critics raised fears that the 
Marshalls might unknowingly end up importing toxic waste. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Hiroshi Yamamura, who represents an island contaminated by radioactive 
fallout from the 1950s testing, said Majuro had no way to be sure that the 
waste was safe. 
</P>
<P>
"Do we really trust the Americans?" he asked in Parliament. "How can we know 
that the so-called household garbage is nontoxic waste?" 
</P>
<P>
"Admiralty Pacific may hide the toxic waste in order to get the money," said 
Senator Tony de Brum. "More than 40 nations have turned down the U.S. offer 
regarding the dumping proposal. Why should the Marshall Islands accept it?" 
</P>
<P>
In the last year, Papua New Guinea, Western Samoa, the Solomon Islands and 
Tonga have turned down a variety of waste disposal and incineration schemes 
proposed by American firms. 
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace estimates that a ton of American household garbage contains 20 
pounds of toxic material, such as cleaning fluids, lead-based paints and 
pesticides, and that their removal would make a deal like the one proposed by 
Admiralty unprofitable. 
</P>
<P>
President Kabua, who hopes to bring in as much as $56 million a year importing 
the trash, and his cousin and sponsor of the resolution, Sen. Imata Kabua, said 
Majuro could hire scientists to evaluate the safety of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The Majuro government says the plan still depends on the completion of 
environmental, landfill and other studies to see if it will benefit the 
Marshall Islands. 
</P>
<P>
Admiralty is expected to complete an engineering feasibility study, which it 
began in January, this month. 
</P>
<P>
The British pressure group Ark said last month that global warming because of 
the pollution-induced "greenhouse effect" could raise the world's sea levels by 
more than 15 feet over the next 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
If such studies prove true, the Marshalls could be totally submerged.

The Bush Administration, anticipating that Gen. Manuel A. Noriega will try to 
rig elections in Panama, is considering additional punitive measures against 
the strongman after today's presidential balloting, U.S. officials said. The 
officials, who declined to be identified, said the options range from an effort 
to seize Noriega's assets abroad to enlisting the support of friendly 
democratic countries in a campaign to increase Panama's international 
isolation.

Soviet poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko says the CIA helped the KGB clamp down on 
Soviet dissidents in 1966 in order to divert world attention from the U.S. 
bombing of Vietnam. In an article in the Soviet weekly Ogonyok, Yevtushenko 
recounts how Sen. Robert F. Kennedy (D-N.Y.) told him that the U.S. 
intelligence service had given its Soviet rival the pseudonyms of dissident 
writers Yuli Daniel and Andrei Sinyavsky. Both were prosecuted with alleged CIA 
evidence. Yevtushenko wrote he learned of the alleged CIA involvement when he 
was invited to the senator's New York headquarters during a visit to the United 
States in November, 1966.

STUDY OF IDENTICAL TWINS LINKS GENES TO JOB SATISFACTION 
</P>

Hate your job? Love your job? Part of the reason may be your genes, a study 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
By studying identical twins who grew up in different families, researchers 
found evidence that genes influence a worker's satisfaction with his job. 
</P>
<P>
That may be part of the reason some people seem happy no matter what they do, 
while others have trouble finding a satisfying job, said industrial 
psychologist Richard Arvey. 
</P>
<P>
The findings do not suggest that people who dislike their jobs are genetically 
doomed to unhappiness at work. The apparent genetic impact is quite modest, and 
like other genetic influences it may be modifiable by environment, Arvey said 
in a recent telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
The study is presented in April's issue of the Journal of Applied Psychology by 
Arvey, a professor at the Industrial Relations Center of the University of 
Minnesota's Carlson School of Management, and university colleagues Lauren 
Abraham, Thomas Bouchard, Jr. and Nancy Segal. 
</P>
<P>
Arvey said the study does not prove genetic influence over job satisfaction, 
but only supports the idea. He also noted that the study was small, and urged 
caution in applying the results to the general population. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Link to Previous Research 
</P>
<P>
Two scientists who have studied genetic influence on personality commented that 
the new findings fit in with previous research. 
</P>
<P>
John Loehlin of the University of Texas at Austin said other research suggests 
genetic influence on personality and temperament, and an effect on job 
satisfaction appears plausible. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Rose of Indiana University in Bloomington said Finnish studies of twins 
have found evidence that genes may influence a person's job choice, 
satisfaction with life, and frequency of changing jobs for such reasons as 
dissatisfaction or being fired. 
</P>
<P>
But psychologist Leon Kamin of Northeastern University, who has analyzed 
nature-vs.-nurture research, said he is skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
Kamin said previous studies showed that twins reared apart tend to grow up in 
similar family environments, which he said could explain such similarities as 
degree of job satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
The new study focused on 34 pairs of identical twins who had been separated at 
an average age of less than 6 months. They were not reunited until about age 
32, on average. Twenty-five of the pairs were female. 
</P>
<P>
Each twin completed a 20-item questionnaire about satisfaction with the "major 
job" in his or her life. 
</P>
<P>
Arvey said the job list was diverse, including research chemist, coal miner, 
assembly line worker, computer analyst, machinist, nurse and financial planner. 
Seventeen women said being a housewife was their major job. 
</P>
<P>
Comparing jobs held by each member of twin pairs, researchers found evidence 
that twins tended to hold jobs with similar degrees of mental complexity, 
physical demands and physical coordination requirements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Personality Factor 
</P>
<P>
That finding supports the notion that genes also affect which jobs people seek, 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts contend that it does not explain the apparent genetic influence on 
job satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
Arvey said there are several possible ways genes could influence happiness in 
the workplace. Affecting personality is a "very likely mechanism," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, genes may influence what people pay attention to on the job, 
such as supervision, he said, or they may affect what people want out of a job.

QUAKE RESEARCH SHAKES UP USUAL THINKING ON SAFEST CONSTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. LEIGHTY, United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RICHMOND, Calif. -- California's building industry, lulled into complacency by 
the relative quiet along the fault lines that crisscross the state, will be 
rudely awakened to the need for stronger structures when the inevitable "big 
one" strikes, a top earthquake engineer warned. 
</P>
<P>
There are, of course, ominous reminders of the powerful forces at work beneath 
the surface -- mild quakes of about 4.4 magnitude rumbled through both Northern 
and Southern California during April's Earthquake Preparedness Month. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, with the exception of modern skyscrapers, which are designed to sway but 
not break in a major tremor, few innovative techniques for dissipating the 
destructive jolts of earthquakes are being used in the construction industry. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, just a simple and inexpensive bracing system could be used 
within a building to foil the force of an earthquake, preventing damage and 
saving lives. Unfortunately, even these devices are largely ignored in 
construction and renovation projects. 
</P>
<P>
A "base isolation" system for small- and medium-rise buildings is also 
available and consists of placing the structure on a series of barrel-shaped 
steel and rubber "sandwiches" that isolate the building from the horizontal 
motion of the earth. Only a few builders, however, have actually used the 
technique in this country. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt we'll have a big one and when we do we'll have a disaster," 
said Vitelmo Bertero, director of the Earthquake Engineering Research Center. 
"This is what really worries me. We have to wake up. The building industry has 
to wake up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Employs 'Shaking Table' 
</P>
<P>
The research center, operated by the University of California, is the site of 
the nation's largest and most sophisticated "shaking table," a 50-ton concrete 
slab that can simulate earthquakes for testing practically any type of 
structure -- buildings, dams, bridges, even sections of pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
It would seem that private industry would heavily support research that would 
lead to safer and stronger houses and buildings, especially in earthquake-prone 
regions, but Bertero said this has not occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Funding for the shake-table experiments has come mostly from the university and 
National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, he said, Japan, which has been in a 20-year cycle of severe 
earthquakes, has moved rapidly ahead in the field because the construction 
trade funds the engineering research and is using the results in practical 
building applications. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan has made tremendous progress," Bertero said. "We're way behind in terms 
of application. If we don't change, future construction power in seismic 
regions will be in the hands of the Japanese. Even in this country we have been 
losing markets and we'll lose all the markets. It's unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Scientists, including Bruce Bolt, director of the University of California's 
seismographic laboratory, said there's a 50-50 chance a major shake similar to 
the great San Francisco earthquake of April 18, 1906, will hit along the San 
Andreas or Hayward faults in Northern California within 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, the chances are similar for a big quake along either 
the same San Andreas or the San Jacinto fault. 
</P>
<P>
At the shaking table, a control center can simulate any recent earthquake from 
recorded data and test how different buildings, materials or earthquake devices 
would have withstood the event. Bertero said a product that shows great promise 
in buffering vibrations is something known as ADAS -- Added Damping and 
Stiffness. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reliable Absorption System 
</P>
<P>
ADAS structural elements are "the best energy dissipation system we have 
tested," Bertero said of the bracing system. "It's very reliable, inexpensive 
and has a good future both for retrofitting buildings and for new 
construction." 
</P>
<P>
The ADAS elements, he said, provide increased damping, which lessens shaking, 
and greater overall stiffness to a structure that helps lessen earthquake 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan has other systems more sophisticated using hydraulic jacks and based on 
friction, but they're tremendously expensive, which is the drawback," Bertero 
said. "You need economy and reliability." 
</P>
<P>
UC engineering professor James Kelly, who has led the development of the base 
isolation system at the Richmond center, agrees with Bertero about the Japanese 
dominance in the application of seismic devices. 
</P>
<P>
"They are extremely active and there are perhaps 20 buildings on isolation 
systems in Japan," Kelly said. "The Japanese started later but have gone much 
farther with it." 
</P>
<P>
"Probably the real reason is the difference in attitude in Japan. Here, 
construction companies work at minimizing costs first. In Japan, they're 
willing to pay 5% to 10% more" to build with devices that would reduce 
earthquake damage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rancho Cucamonga Center 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, Kelly said, the first building to use base isolation was 
the $30-million Foothill Communities Law and Justice Center in Rancho 
Cucamonga, Calif., a 265,000-square-foot complex sitting on 98 rubber bearings 
30 inches in diameter and 15 inches high. 
</P>
<P>
The structure, located in prime earthquake country, got its first real test in 
October, 1985, when a small earthquake shook the building, equipped from top to 
bottom with instruments for measuring stresses and strains. 
</P>
<P>
"The response of the building was very, very favorable," Kelly said. "It was 
exactly what we expected." 
</P>
<P>
Energy amplification on the roof of the five-story complex, he said, was 
actually less than what the quake measured on the foundation below the 
isolators. A similar building nearby, also with instrumentation but 
conventionally built, measured an energy acceleration on the roof five times 
greater than that of the foundation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The significant difference, he said, was actually overstating the case since 
small quakes tend to amplify the signals more than would an intense quake. 
Damage also absorbs energy, he said, so if there is no damage in a small quake, 
there would be more energy amplification. 
</P>
<P>
Another large building using base isolation is the Evans and Sutherland 
computer manufacturing plant in Salt Lake City. Under construction is the 
County Fire Command and Control Facility in Los Angeles and in the planning 
stages is a University of Southern California hospital. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Application Limited 
</P>
<P>
Base isolation is only effective for small- or medium-sized buildings under 
seven stories and when used on a firm surface. Kelly is also developing 
low-cost isolation systems for residential structures, including masonry, brick 
and adobe homes. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that in the next 10 or 20 years we'll see a fairly large 
number of buildings using base isolation, but it will never be more than a 
small percentage overall," Kelly said. He said the best opportunity for the 
method is in rehabilitating existing masonry buildings, for example, that are 
of architectural or historical value. 
</P>
<P>
"Conventional rehabilitation with earthquake protection generally requires a 
change in the fabric of the building. Isolation only affects the foundation 
level and it's much cheaper." 
</P>
<P>
He said California's earthquake building codes, although stringent, have as 
their basis the protection of life rather than minimizing of structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
"If designed to code, a building can have serious damage and even be rendered 
completely uninhabitable, but still satisfy the life safety requirements. In 
many cases, what is needed is more damage control, which isolation can provide. 
It will reduce severe damage and in the long run, the costs will be lower." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Great Deal Known 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have learned a lot about which structures stand and which ones 
collapse from studying recent powerful earthquakes -- including the devastating 
Armenian temblor last December that killed at least 25,000 and injured 19,000, 
leaving 500,000 homeless and damage estimated at over $16 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Unreinforced structures collapsed, heavy damage occurred to buildings on fill 
or sandy soil, and buckling occurred in structures with poor bracing and weak 
joints. 
</P>
<P>
Bertero said that in San Francisco, although many tall buildings are on fill, 
they are probably constructed well enough to withstand a strong quake. The 
downtown danger, he said, would be from falling objects from decorative facades 
and shards of glass that would hit the narrow streets like deadly missiles. 
</P>
<P>
"The real problem in San Francisco and most of our cities are those buildings 
four to 10 stories tall, the condominiums, those built just for business and 
real estate transactions, these are the ones that collapse," Bertero said.

AIDS TESTING IS STATE-OF-ART; LAB FACILITY IS OF ANOTHER AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID BAUDER, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ALBANY, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists at the world's busiest AIDS testing laboratory face not only blood 
samples contaminated with a deadly disease, but peeling paint, exploding light 
bulbs and a sink with no drain. 
</P>
<P>
There's even a sign on the elevator warning not to use it; it gets stuck. 
</P>
<P>
New York, a leader in AIDS testing and research in this country largely because 
it has more AIDS patients than any other state, does most of this key 
scientific work in a laboratory built in 1917. 
</P>
<P>
Potholes line the driveway leading to the three-story brick building, where 
gleaming computers sit alongside equipment rusted with age. Exposed wires run 
along walls and paint peels from the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of ironic," said Colleen Flood, a bacteriologist who runs the 
program that tests newborns for the presence of the human immunodeficiency 
virus. "We're down here doing work that's at the forefront. When people come in 
here . . . they say, 'How can you work in such a dilapidated lab?' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Measures of Pride, Indignity 
</P>
<P>
Flood and her colleagues have learned to adjust to a job that brings with it 
certain measures of pride and indignity. They took the job partly because it is 
more exciting than routine lab work, but they deal with a disease that still 
comes with a taint and work in conditions that cannot match private labs. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually any testing needed to combat a public health emergency in New York 
eventually finds its way to the New Scotland Avenue Laboratory here, said 
Donald Berns, director of the Health Department division of clinical sciences. 
</P>
<P>
When medical waste began washing up on beaches last summer, it was bagged and 
sent to Berns for examination. When there was an outbreak of salmonella in 
eggs, they were brought to New Scotland Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS is overwhelmingly the state's most pressing health epidemic. It had 20,476 
confirmed cases by the end of 1988, one-fourth the national total, and about 
300,000 New Yorkers are thought to be HIV infected, a possible precursor of 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
The state conducts nearly 750,000 tests related to AIDS a year here, including 
half a million HIV tests. That is more than any other laboratory anywhere, 
Berns said. The military conducts more than 600,000 HIV tests a year at a Miami 
lab. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
20 Assigned to AIDS Testing 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of blood vials a day are delivered by mail to the laboratory where 
they are placed in a black bin for sorting. Each vial is assigned a number and 
information about the test subject is typed into a computer. Of the 138 
laboratory employees, 20 deal exclusively with AIDS testing. 
</P>
<P>
Five white freezers hum in one of many small rooms. Each contains 20,000 blood 
serum samples, part of the state's research stockpile. Each sample taken since 
the beginning of the AIDS epidemic is kept here as a ready resource for tests 
done on the disease. 
</P>
<P>
The freezers stand next to a rusted sink covered with a cardboard sign: "Do not 
use sink. No drain." 
</P>
<P>
It is one of dozens of little reminders of the building's limitations. The 
elevators were installed before the Roaring '20s. The ovens where glass was 
made for test tubes and beakers have been dormant for years, so outdated the 
equipment is not safe, said Russ Toombs, the lab's operations director. 
</P>
<P>
Mold sometimes grows on the ceilings, said researcher Diana Schoonmaker. Lights 
occasionally flicker, and bulbs have exploded during power surges. 
</P>
<P>
Schoonmaker was one of 15 workers who tested positive in 1983 for exposure to 
tuberculosis, one of many viruses tested there. Each worker was treated with 
antibiotics for a year, and none developed the disease. But it scared them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating to me," Berns said of the building. "It's a real problem to 
have to deal with this. But the quality of the people make up for a lot of the 
problems you have." 
</P>
<P>
Flood, 28, said her fiance, a high school teacher, did not want her to take the 
lab job because of fears about the AIDS virus. Neither did her parents. 
</P>
<P>
"After a while they figured that I was intelligent enough to know that if there 
was any risk involved then I wouldn't take it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Keeps Work From Friends 
</P>
<P>
Rosalyn Moore, who also tests blood samples for AIDS, said she thinks twice 
about telling acquaintances what she does. Usually she just tells them she 
works in a laboratory, without going into specifics. 
</P>
<P>
The employees are strict about wearing rubber gloves and white coats and say 
they do not worry too much about the danger. But like their superiors, they 
would like a better place to work. 
</P>
<P>
"With New York state and all its wealth, it seems they could provide a little 
better working atmosphere," said Mike Neal, a bacteriologist. 
</P>
<P>
There has never been an accident involving the AIDS virus, Berns said. The 
virus is not "a hardy virus" and quickly dies when exposed to air. 
</P>
<P>
He would not characterize the building as dangerous, "but I also would be 
dishonest if I didn't say the potential for accidents is far higher here." 
</P>
<P>
Modern laboratories are sealed so germs cannot escape from floor to floor. New 
Scotland's ventilation system is less modern -- windows are opened, often in 
the winter because of inconsistent heating -- and it is believed that this 
contributed to the TB virus exposure six years ago, Berns said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Obsolete, Deteriorating' 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Mario Cuomo has called the lab "obsolete, deteriorating and incapable of 
meeting modern federal standards for biosafety" and asked the Legislature for 
$75 million to rebuild it and six other buildings, all built before 1949. 
</P>
<P>
Few people dispute that the building needs to be replaced. "It's just a 
question of staying with it," said state Sen. Joseph Bruno, who sponsored 
legislation to appropriate the money. The bill is pending. 
</P>
<P>
Designs have already been drawn up for the new lab. They are outside Berns' 
office, awaiting the governmental go-ahead. But money is tight in New York this 
year, with Cuomo saying he had to deal with a potential $2.6-billion deficit as 
he prepared a budget proposal for the fiscal year that began April 1. 
</P>
<P>
"You stretch a rubber band as far as you can," Berns said. "This rubber band 
has been stretched to the point of breaking."

ONCE USED FOR CHEWING GUM;

<P>
A LOST ART: HARVESTING CHICLE IN YUCATAN JUNGLES

The healed herringbone scars, crisscrossing high up the trunks of the tall 
sapodilla trees, are the diaries of the bold chicleros who slashed them with 
their machetes years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Chicle -- milky liquid latex -- once trickled freely down the sluices hacked in 
the trees, collecting in canvas bags at the base. Boiled down and molded into 
rubbery gray blocks for export, it was the basic ingredient of chewing gum 
until a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Chicleros, the rugged, resourceful men who risked their lives and endangered 
their health in their quest for the once-essential substance, have passed into 
the folklore of their verdant homeland. 
</P>
<P>
They scrambled up the thick trunks of the sapodillas, leaned out on ropes tied 
around their waists 60 or 80 feet above the floor of the tropical rain forest 
and went about their dangerous work. 
</P>
<P>
All too often, a careless machete stroke severed a rope and sent a chiclero 
plunging to his death. 
</P>
<P>
For those who survived, staying alive and healthy in the jungles of Mexico's 
southern Yucatan Peninsula, the Peten region of northern Guatemala and northern 
Belize was a relentless challenge. 
</P>
<P>
They had to work during the rainy season, when the chicle was flowing. They 
slept in hammocks slung from makeshift shelters. They slogged through dense, 
dank vegetation filled with malarial mosquitoes, poisonous snakes and a species 
of fly that infected them with disfiguring "chicleros' ulcers," which sometimes 
caused ears, noses and other extremities to fall off. 
</P>
<P>
Probably nobody knows more about chicleros than Herman W. Konrad, an 
anthropologist at the University of Calgary, Canada. He has been doing research 
on them for more than a dozen years and has actually lived in their camps. 
</P>
<P>
The growth of the chicle industry was related directly to the growth of the 
chewing-gum industry in the United States. Konrad traces its origins to the 
1830s. Sales increased after the 1860s, and by the Gay '90s the sugary 
confection had become a national fad. 
</P>
<P>
Konrad estimates the fluctuating chiclero workforce in Mexico, the major chicle 
producer, at 1,200 in 1890, surging to 20,000 in 1945, and tapering off to 
1,600 in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"I've declared the industry moribund since 1980," says Konrad. U.S. imports 
have ceased but small amounts of chicle are still used regionally or exported 
to a few other countries. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Weber, consumer affairs administrator for the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. of 
Chicago, a leading gum manufacturer, explains the decline of chicle: 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the encroachment of civilization in the rain forests of Central 
America, the difficulty and expense of harvesting chicle, and the discovery of 
other suitable natural and synthetic latexes, the importance of chicle in the 
chewing-gum industry has greatly diminished." 
</P>
<P>
So where does that leave the surviving chicleros? Some apply their detailed 
knowledge of the tangled terrain to tamer endeavors, such as mahogany lumbering 
or the collection of exotic ferns for export to American florists. A few, as 
they always have, seek black-market riches from looted Maya artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
The machete-swinging exploits of their chicle-gathering days live only in 
memory.

KEEPER OF BLARNEY STONE MAKES LOTS OF FRIENDS ON PRECARIOUS WIND-SWEPT PERCH 
</P>

BLARNEY, Ireland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Dineen hangs upside down each morning on top of a wind-swept tower and 
kisses a stone. He then spends the rest of the day helping others to plant 
their precarious kisses. 
</P>
<P>
This portly and jovial figure has what must rank as one of Ireland's most 
unusual jobs: keeper of the Blarney Stone. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 250,000 people per year climb up the tower at Blarney Castle in western 
Ireland because legend decrees that whoever kisses the stone is given the gift 
of eloquence. 
</P>
<P>
Winston Churchill, one of this century's great orators, kissed the stone. 
Comedian Stan Laurel kissed it, but his bulky partner Oliver Hardy declined. 
</P>
<P>
Television actor Larry Hagman, never at a loss for words as the villainous J. 
R. Ewing in "Dallas," had to take off his Stetson to pay lip-service to the 
stone. 
</P>
<P>
Kissing the stone is not for the faint-hearted or those who suffer from vertigo 
or bad backs. 
</P>
<P>
You have to lean over backwards at the top of a 90-foot-high tower, stretch out 
across an awkward gap in the parapet, grasp two iron railings and plant your 
kiss while upside down. 
</P>
<P>
That is where Dineen comes in. He provides a rug for you to lie on, perches 
above the abyss himself and guides you toward the gift of immortal eloquence. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Dineen insists, kissing the stone "is very safe. . . . I kiss it 
every morning. It definitely works." 
</P>
<P>
But who holds onto his legs for the awkward maneuver? 
</P>
<P>
"That has to be self-service." 
</P>
<P>
"The oldest I have had was a woman of 104 from Los Angeles. The oldest couple 
were an 87-year-old and an 84-year-old from San Diego, Calif. They put them in 
here as early as 6 weeks old," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The best floor show in Blarney is provided by watching the people who come from 
all over the world clambering up the tower steps and then realizing what they 
have to do. 
</P>
<P>
Dineen, his pockets stuffed with American dollars from grateful customers he 
has held tight, said, "Stick around here long enough and you will hear the 
screams." 
</P>
<P>
Honeymooners have traditionally tried to kiss the stone side by side. Everyone 
has to make a wish. Many are too scared and forget while they cling on, staring 
into space. 
</P>
<P>
As a crowd of hesitant tourists built up around the stone, one American took 
the plunge -- but not literally. 
</P>
<P>
After hanging his head upside down and planting his kiss, he confessed, "I just 
asked to come back alive." 
</P>
<P>
An Australian woman wondered afterward if it was worth the trouble. "It's only 
the Irish who are never lost for words," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The art of conversation certainly ranks alongside drinking Guinness stout and 
betting on race horses as one of Ireland's great national pastimes. 
</P>
<P>
With 60 million people of Irish descent around the world, the stone still has 
plenty of customers to come. 
</P>
<P>
"It is definitely Ireland's most popular tourist attraction," Dineen said 
proudly. 
</P>
<P>
The stone's exact origins are lost in the mists of time, but Britain's Queen 
Elizabeth I is credited with introducing into the English language the word 
blarney, meaning pleasant talk intended to deceive without offending. 
</P>
<P>
During Britain's colonial rule over Ireland, the Earl of Leicester was 
commanded to take possession of the castle from the then lord of Blarney, 
Cormac McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy always suggested a banquet or some other form of delay so that when 
the queen asked for progress reports, a long missive was sent to her. The 
castle remained untaken. 
</P>
<P>
"This is all blarney. What he says, he never means," the queen complained. 
</P>
<P>
Another more romantic tale suggests that the local king of Munster saved an old 
woman from drowning in the lake beside the castle. 
</P>
<P>
She turned out to be a witch who told the king about a special stone in the 
tower that would offer eloquence in return for a kiss. 
</P>
<P>
Dineen reassures hygienically-minded visitors that the stone is washed four to 
five times a day.

PLANE CARRYING AMERICANS CRASHES IN MEXICO JUNGLE; 6 KILLED

<P>
Six passengers were killed when a plane carrying American tourists lost power 
in one engine and crash-landed in a remote jungle of the Yucatan Peninsula, 
Mexican officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Aerocozumel flight was returning Friday afternoon to the Caribbean resort 
island of Cozumel after taking the tourists to view ancient Indian ruins at 
Chichen Itza, about 115 miles inland. 
</P>
<P>
The plane crashed at 3:30 p.m. just outside Playa del Carmen about 20 miles 
from the island of Cancun, the airline said. A federal police spokesman said 
the pilot had radioed the Cancun airport that he was having engine problems. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen of the 18 people aboard the plane were believed to be American 
tourists, said U.S. consul Bryant Salter. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Leonardo Tunchon of the Isla Mujeres naval sector, whose forces were 
coordinating the rescue, said six people were killed. A Red Cross official said 
the victims included two men and four women -- apparently all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we know, 16 passengers listed in the manifest all had U.S. 
addresses, so we assume they're Americans," said Salter, U.S. consul in Merida, 
capital of Yucatan state. He refused to disclose passenger names until next of 
kin were notified. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 16 tourists, the British-made Trislander aircraft carried a 
pilot and a tourist guide, Salter said. The Excelsior news agency said the 
aircraft, which was filled to capacity, lost power in one engine but was able 
to crash-land. 
</P>
<P>
Diego Acosta, commander of the Red Cross in Cancun, said the jungle terrain 
hampered rescue operations, but authorities managed to airdrop food and 
medicine until army troops could reach the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
Red Cross worker Josefina Cardiel said the plane crashed inside a ravine in 
thick jungle and troops had to clear a path to the site and then provide 
rappelling equipment so that rescue workers could reach the plane.

GERMANY JAILS GYNECOLOGIST WHO PERFORMED 79 ILLEGAL ABORTIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
A gynecologist in the predominantly Roman Catholic state of Bavaria was jailed 
for 2 1/2 years Friday for performing illegal abortions. 
</P>
<P>
In an eight-month trial dubbed a "witch hunt" by its critics, Horst Theissen, 
50, was charged with carrying out at least 79 illegal abortions between 1981 
and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
He said he knew he was breaking the law but did so because of his clients' 
distressing circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
West German law allows for a pregnancy to be terminated only when a second 
doctor agrees it is socially or medically necessary. In rural, strongly 
Catholic areas of southern Germany, abortion is virtually unobtainable. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution questioned 79 witnesses on the circumstances of their 
abortions, to establish whether they could have kept the baby or given it up 
for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the trial said it was the women who appeared to be on trial, not 
Theissen, and former Health Minister Rita Suessmuth said the court violated 
their privacy. 
</P>
<P>
The radical Greens party said the verdict was a major setback for women and 
doctors.

ROSETTA STONE'S CITY SEEKS ITS SARDINES 
</P>

ROSETTA, Egypt 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
History made Rosetta one of Egypt's best-known places, first as a major seaport 
for the Ottoman Empire, then as the city that gave its name to the Rosetta 
Stone, which yielded the key to ancient hieroglyphics. 
</P>
<P>
But the Rosetta of today hardly does justice to its rich past. Few pay any 
attention to its history and the sardines that once gave it wealth vanished 20 
years ago -- victims of the Aswan High Dam about 750 miles south. 
</P>
<P>
The town also languishes in worry about a destructive Mediterranean Sea, which 
took away its beach three years ago, swallowing up summer cabins and now 
threatening precious agricultural land. 
</P>
<P>
Rosetta's history lingers in 22 Ottoman-style, three-story houses tucked among 
new buildings. Long neglected, the houses overlook narrow streets shared by 
horse-drawn carts and 1956 Chevrolets. 
</P>
<P>
"This collection of Islamic antiquities from the Ottoman Empire is second only 
to Cairo's," said Mohammed Mallah, curator of the Al Amasyali House, now 
restored and open as a museum of Rosettan life in the early 19th Century. "In 
fact, there are more old houses here than in Cairo." 
</P>
<P>
Founded in the 9th Century, Rosetta flourished and faded, then flourished 
again. By the 17th Century it had become one of the most important ports 
between Europe and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Gypsum figures in a recently restored military museum depict Rosettan townfolk 
pitched in hand-to-hand combat against Napoleon I's troops in the late 18th 
Century and against British soldiers in 1807. 
</P>
<P>
Napoleon's soldiers found the Rosetta Stone in 1799. Twenty years later 
Jean-Francois Champollion, the world's first Egyptologist, solved the puzzle of 
ancient heiroglyphic writing through texts from the Rosetta Stone, a basalt 
tablet now housed in the British Museum in London. 
</P>
<P>
Rosetta's importance began to diminish after that, and by 1819 it was no longer 
a major port because a new canal south of Rosetta diverted Nile trade to 
Alexandria, 40 miles to the west. 
</P>
<P>
Rosetta, its treasures and its 80,000 people are on hardly any tourist's 
itinerary these days. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's because it has no presentable hotels or restaurants. Or because of 
the disrepair into which most of the once-elegant houses have fallen, their 
intricately designed wooden ceilings and marble baths left dark and dusty. 
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian government envisions a new future for Rosetta -- tourism. A key to 
the plan is a new sea wall. 
</P>
<P>
Local people hope the wall, however, in stopping sea erosion, will bring back 
the sardines. 
</P>
<P>
"Rosetta was famous for its cafes. They were built and spread around with the 
sardine wealth," said Helmy Zayed, head of the Rosetta City Council. "People 
caught sardines during the season, then spent their money on businesses, 
weddings, pilgrimage and coffee houses. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to have heaps of sardines, so many you would lift them with spades. 
Every single person in our society has been affected by the lack of sardines, 
from the fisherman to the truck driver to the tradesman." 
</P>
<P>
But the building of the Aswan High Dam had blocked sea erosion-resisting silt 
far upstream in the Nile, and by the 1970s the Mediterranean was washing away 
580 feet of Rosetta's shoreline every year. The lack of silt, which contained 
nutrients that attracted the sardines, already had finished off the fishing 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
An alarmed national government contracted with a company owned by the 
Nationalist Chinese government on Taiwan to build the $31-million seawall to 
protect the shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
The wall is well along now, workers are restoring many of the old houses and 
mosques, and plans are in place for hotels and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say after completion of the seawall they will be able to build a 
summer resort and a modest hotel and restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot to see in Rosetta," said Yehia Ibrahim Mohammed, a part-time 
museum employee. "We have some foreigners visiting now, but they're mostly 
architects and Islamic art experts."

PRO-WHITE POLITICS: BACKWATER OR RISING TIDE?

<P>
The middle-aged white woman in the David Duke sweat shirt was pleasantly 
enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
"He's for fair play for all," she said of the former Ku Klux Klan leader she 
had come to hear. "Right now it's like we've become the minority and we need 
someone to do something." 
</P>
<P>
Duke, who has made the jump from radical fringe to elected official, points to 
such people as proof that his message is becoming acceptable to the mainstream. 
Now leader of the National Assn. for the Advancement of White People, Duke won 
election to the Louisiana Legislature by talking about the high birth rate 
among unwed women on welfare and claiming that whites are victimized by civil 
rights laws. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I spoke out loud what a lot of people say around the dinner table," he 
said. "People were so impressed by the ideas that they voted for me despite the 
controversy of my background." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foes See It, Too 
</P>
<P>
Duke is not alone in his thinking. Much of what he says is echoed by those who 
have opposed him throughout his career. 
</P>
<P>
"The David Duke election was a signal of a sour mood of resentment on the part 
of some whites that has been a long time in developing," said Irwin Suall, 
director of fact-finding for the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. "There 
is a perception out there that blacks are being favored at the expense of 
whites, not merely in employment, but in status in the media." 
</P>
<P>
Some dismiss Duke's election by just 200 votes as an anomaly; his suburban New 
Orleans district is 99% white. But Suall and other trackers of racial tension 
believe that disparate events, such as Duke's slim victory at the polls and the 
rise of the racist skinhead subculture, are warning signs to be taken 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"These people and these events represent something larger," said Chip Berlet, a 
researcher for Political Research Associates of Cambridge, Mass. "They are like 
the canaries in mines -- telling us there is an undercurrent of people that are 
very unhappy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
White Complaints 
</P>
<P>
This unhappiness, Berlet and others say, runs long and deep. It is the result 
of economic changes that have nibbled away at the blue-collar, union-wage 
culture, of fear of drugs and crime, of the perception that affirmative action 
and other civil rights programs are unfair to whites, and of a general 
hopelessness within the white working class, which sees its power in society 
shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
At a shopping mall on the edge of Duke's district, a white woman in her 30s 
offered her opinion but would not give her name: 
</P>
<P>
"You see all this about black power and black pride and helping blacks 
economically, and I guess that started out with good intentions. But it's not 
right when whites lose jobs and it's not fair when you're called a racist for 
complaining about it." 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to measure this mood. Most polls show the American public as 
far more tolerant of racial differences and integration programs than it once 
was. But Michael McKeon, a pollster who has worked with the Democratic 
Congressional Campaign Committee, said standard surveys that ask yes-or-no 
questions can't plumb the depths of individual attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Disenchantment' Noted 
</P>
<P>
McKeon said his phone surveys, which involve conversation with the respondents, 
show "big-time disenchantment." 
</P>
<P>
"It's nothing you can put a number on, but there is a resentment out there that 
the lower middle class, and their children, aren't going to be any better off 
than they were," he said. "If you ask, 'Are you mad because your kid didn't get 
a scholarship and a black kid did?' they're going to say no. But if you talk to 
them you're going to see this resentment woven into the fabric of their 
thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
Those in the civil rights trenches, such as Curt Koehler, an organizer for the 
Chicago Commission on Human Relations, note a simmering anger, especially among 
young whites. 
</P>
<P>
"A growing number of white people in their 20s feel they are on the short end 
of the stick," said Koehler, who tries to defuse racial tension in the 
blue-collar neighborhoods on Chicago's Southwest side, an area that has seen 
KKK rallies and skinhead violence. 
</P>
<P>
Koehler said the lower-middle-class white bastion of the secure union job is 
crumbling. At the same time, the disenchanted see a growing black middle class 
moving in, and believe it is the result of government favoritism. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blacks Get Blame 
</P>
<P>
"A black on his way up might have a chance to buy a home in a neighborhood 
where a young white kid just saw his job leave," he said. "The anger is being 
placed now on black folks and affirmative action." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the economics is an issue of group identity and pride. The higher 
profile of minorities on stage, in the movies and on television gives some 
whites a sense that their importance in society is diminishing. 
</P>
<P>
Berlet noted that while relatively few blacks appear on TV, those few have 
appeared so rapidly that black representation can seem disproportional. "Blacks 
make up 15% of the population and maybe only 4% on TV," he said, "but when some 
whites see . . . more black faces on television, they think they're taking 
over." 
</P>
<P>
Gregg, a 20-year-old Atlanta skinhead who would not give his last name, 
complained bitterly about "black propaganda."

"I was watching television and they had these blacks sitting around, telling 
everybody it was blacks who invented this and blacks who invented that. It was 
a bunch of lies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Skinhead's Viewpoint 
</P>
<P>
Bert, a fellow skinhead, sees concepts such as black pride and black history as 
coming at the expense of white identity. 
</P>
<P>
"White heritage is not being taught in school. It's like you're supposed to be 
ashamed of being white while they're teaching black heritage full force," he 
said. "They completely downplay the role whites have in this country." 
</P>
<P>
These frustrations can blossom into acts of racial violence that Koehler has 
seen in his Chicago neighborhoods. "Or," he said, "these people can vote for a 
David Duke in the belief they can protect what is mine." 
</P>
<P>
Whether that will mean election of others who espouse similar ideas is a matter 
of debate among social pulse-takers. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Lipset, a Stanford University sociologist, said he believes that other 
white-rights candidates may be elected to local offices, "but they're dead if 
they have any ambitions to go further." 
</P>
<P>
Duke, however, believes that he is only the first to tap a growing sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Duke Sees a Trend 
</P>
<P>
"I think that this is the beginning of a time when we will see candidates 
discuss these things," he said. "A candidate who doesn't have to carry the 
political baggage I had to carry, and who discusses these issues, will win." 
</P>
<P>
Duke was elected after several unsuccessful attempts. In 1979 he ran for state 
Senate and lost. He topped two other candidates but ran a distant second with 
30% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
The differences between then and now, says Duke, are the sophistication of his 
organization and a change in the mood of the voters. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a tremendous shift in the last few years," he said. "I think 
there is a majority of whites that is starting to say we have rights, too, that 
we have a heritage that is worthy of preservation and we don't want to face 
racial discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
Sam Altobello, registrar of voters in Jefferson Parish for 18 years, said 
Duke's message hit such a responsive chord that people outside his district 
called to see if they could register there so they could vote for him. 
</P>
<P>
"He got his message over," said Altobello. "He was saying things that people 
have been thinking for a while. He said it, and it went over." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
White Power Campaigns 
</P>
<P>
Whether Duke's rhetoric and its success will carry over in other parts of the 
country remains to be seen. Several groups with KKK or neo-Nazi ties have 
announced plans to field candidates. Duke says he has been contacted by more 
than 200 candidates or elected officials interested in his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the radical people are going to be getting more votes in this country. 
The shrinking middle class sees those in power have nothing left to offer," 
said Tom Metzger, the former Klan leader who heads the separatist White Ayran 
Resistance, which has courted the skinheads.

<P>
UNIQUE CUBAN SKIN TREATMENT ATTRACTING FOREIGN PATIENTS -- AND HARD CURRENCY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A unique Cuban treatment for skin disease is luring thousands of patients to 
Havana as Cuba tries to establish itself as a top medical center for the 
developing world. 
</P>
<P>
Already claiming to have one of the Third World's most advanced medical 
systems, Cuba is exploring ways to use this expertise to earn vitally needed 
hard currency amid its worst foreign exchange shortage since the 1959 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
To help turn medical advances into monetary dividends, the government 
established Servimex as a subsidiary of the Cubanacan holding company set up in 
1987 to generate hard currency by developing tourism and joint ventures, a 
novelty in socialist Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
Primarily through "health tourism" packages, Servimex is expected to earn $30 
million this year, a jump from about $4 million in 1988, said its director, Dr. 
Ricardo Martinez Rojas. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of our medical technology is very successful in developing countries. It 
was a matter of finding new outlets, and also to respond to demand," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the potential foreign patients are those who suffer from vitiligo, a 
disorder that causes smooth white patches on the skin. It affects 40 million 
people worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
A Cuban doctor, Carlos Miyares Cao, pioneered the use of "melagenina" ointment 
to treat the loss of pigmentation. 
</P>
<P>
"People hear about our vitiligo treatment, they want to know more, they 
eventually visit us," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody dies from vitiligo; therefore, it is little known. But it carries a lot 
of social rejection. People mistake it for leprosy or syphilis," Miyares Cao 
told Reuters in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
He began developing the treatment with melagenina -- a placental extract in 
alcohol solution -- in 1973 and began using it on a large scale in 1985. In 80% 
of the cases, Miyares Cao said, the treatment is successful. 
</P>
<P>
He said a clinic in the Canary Islands offered vitiligo treatment with the 
"made in Cuba" medicine. Contacts have been established that could lead to 
manufacture of the ointment under license in Britain, Canada, India and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
About 110 patients per month from 70 countries come to his small, modern clinic 
in the residential Miramar district. 
</P>
<P>
Servimex travel packages that include room and board at a Havana hotel allow 
them to stay at least a week. This and the treatment -- including computer 
analysis of how the cure is progressing -- cost up to $250. 
</P>
<P>
Patients come from as far away as Australia and India. 
</P>
<P>
One Indian diplomat recounted how, in a country where most marriages are still 
arranged, misconceptions about vitiligo and the stigma it carries can cloud a 
young woman's prospects. 
</P>
<P>
Miyares Cao's best known patient, Sri Lanka native Sarojini Ariyanayagam, 35, 
knows how it feels to be looked upon as "a freak." 
</P>
<P>
She came here from Britain in 1986 for three months, and returned a year ago to 
stay until the end of the treatment. 
</P>
<P>
She describes hers as a "test case." She has recovered skin color on 40% of her 
body; 85% of her skin had been affected. 
</P>
<P>
Her photograph adorns Servimex brochures, and she works at the clinic in 
exchange for the treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The vitiligo clinic is a stone's throw from the Cira Garcia clinic, where 
Cubanacan offers a three-hour physical check-up for foreign visitors for $200, 
with a 10% discount for participants in international meetings and events. 
</P>
<P>
Other sectors in which Cuba can use its potential as a "medical power" are 
cornea, kidney and bone marrow transplants and brain tissue transplants for 
Parkinson's disease patients. 
</P>
<P>
An assembly-line setting for the treatment of nearsightedness went into 
operation last year, only the second of its kind in the world after Moscow.

CHINA TAKES A TIP FROM THE WEST

<P>
After years of debate, official China has bowed to one more once-taboo 
capitalist practice -- tipping. 
</P>
<P>
A fast-food restaurant run by American and Chinese managers in reformist city 
Tianjin has gotten the go-ahead to test out tipping. 
</P>
<P>
The official Beijing Review magazine said Saturday that servers who once 
recoiled in shock at being given a tip now take the money "as a matter of 
course." There are indications, the magazine said, of a more flexible official 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
But as foreigners in China have learned, taxi-drivers and other tourism workers 
made their policy decision a long time ago.

ARMY TRAINING FACILITY IN W. GERMANY;

<P>
JUST DON'T CALL IT A 'SPY SCHOOL'

<TEXT>
<P>
Surrounded by snow-capped Alpine peaks, an elite U.S. Army school turns out 
experts on the Soviet Union. They go on to become military attaches, Pentagon 
intelligence analysts and even ambassadors. 
</P>
<P>
But, says the colonel in command of the U.S. Army Russian Institute, don't call 
the Bavarian outpost a "spy school," as some Soviet and other critics insist 
that it is. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Richard S. Kosevich adds that the institute will become even more 
important if agreements are reached with the Soviets on cutting back missiles 
or conventional arms. 
</P>
<P>
The institute's two-year program covers Soviet military and political affairs, 
Marxism-Leninism, the news media, military history, arms control and the fine 
points of the Russian language, as well as numerous other subjects. 
</P>
<P>
The student body ranges from about 40 to 50 at a time, one-third civilian from 
the U.S. State Department and the Defense Department and two-thirds military. 
About half a dozen are women. 
</P>
<P>
The courses are taught in Russian, and Soviet military posters with Cyrillic 
script fill the walls. There's a large portrait of President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev in one hallway. 
</P>
<P>
The school, with a current faculty of 18, has turned out more than 800 
graduates since it was founded in 1947, originally to train officers to deal 
with the Soviets when Germany was occupied by Allied armies. 
</P>
<P>
Among the more recent graduates was Maj. Arthur D. Nicholson Jr. of the U.S. 
Army, who was shot to death by the Soviets in March, 1985, while on a patrol in 
East Germany from his base in Potsdam. 
</P>
<P>
Graduates who have gone on to serve in high diplomatic posts include Jack F. 
Matlock Jr., ambassador to the Soviet Union, and Roger Kirk, the ambassador to 
Romania. 
</P>
<P>
The school's graduates fill military attache posts in U.S. embassies throughout 
the Soviet Bloc as well as in Helsinki, Finland, and in Vienna. Others advise 
the U.S. military in West Germany, man the "hot line" between Washington and 
Moscow, work as Defense Department intelligence analysts in Washington and 
teach and perform many other tasks. 
</P>
<P>
"If we get a SALT agreement or if we get a conventional arms agreement, the 
demand for people who can speak Russian and have military knowledge is going to 
be 100 times what it is right now," Kosevich said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the student body will increase to 75 students by the summer of 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
"Military-to-military contacts with the Soviet army are opening up, expanding 
all the time. We hope to get more and more involved in that." 
</P>
<P>
The institute is part of the U.S. Army's Intelligence and Security Command. It 
is in a single building inside a sprawling Army post in Garmisch, ringed by 
craggy Alpine peaks that also provide some of the best skiing in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The students arrive after having at least one year of intensive 
Russian-language training and after getting a master's degree in Soviet studies 
at an American university. 
</P>
<P>
Kosevich emphasized in an interview the importance of having native Russian 
speakers as teachers, many with professional credentials. 
</P>
<P>
"This enables us to get into the thought processes of the Soviet professional 
officer, both military and civilian, to understand how he thinks, acts and 
reacts." 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Ted Kirkpatrick, 33, of Minneapolis, came to the school after starting 
his Russian-language studies in high school and continuing them in college. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess my long-term goal is to become an attache in Moscow," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When the school was founded after World War II, most of the teachers were 
"displaced persons" from the Soviet Union. Now the 16 native Russian speakers 
on the faculty are mainly legal emigres from the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"American students are more devoted to what they are doing," said instructor 
Lev Yudovich, a former defense lawyer in Moscow who also taught postgraduate 
law courses. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to understand, really want to understand the current developments." 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 64-year-old Yudovich added that he is troubled by the bad treatment the 
school has received in the Soviet news media, including a recent article in 
Pravda, the Soviet Communist Party newspaper, which referred to it as a spy 
school. 
</P>
<P>
He calls the Soviet press efforts a "continuation of psychological war." But 
Kosevich remains optimistic.

DROUGHT PRODUCING A BOUNTIFUL CROP OF BOOM-TO-BUST TALES;

AMERICA'S HEARTLAND: THE EXODUS IS UNDER WAY

<P>
For the first spring in 19 years, Duane Schaefer starts his workday with a 
dark-of-night drive past quiet moonlit fields. This is the season of rebirth -- 
and he's on his way to a new life. 
</P>
<P>
At 42, the third-generation farmer has called it quits. No more crops to plant, 
no soil to till. No more weather worries, either. There were enough of those in 
the Great Drought of '88, when Schaefer decided to make the break. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it pushed me over the edge," the burly, proud ex-farmer said of the 
dry spell that followed years of debt and decline. Last spring, he still hoped 
to hang on to the only career he'd ever known. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It Forgot to Rain' 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to give it one more good try," said Schaefer, who now works 
overnights at an auto parts plant. "We gave it our all and it forgot to rain." 
</P>
<P>
"When I decided to quit, I felt like a failure," he said. "The farther I get 
away, the less I feel that way . . . . I feel better now than I have in the 
last 20 years. I'm more optimistic I can make something of myself." 
</P>
<P>
Experts don't yet know what impact the drought will have on the '80s rural 
exodus that already has seen more than 1 million people leave the land and 
273,000 farms go out of business. But they say America's heartland, parts of 
which remain parched, will likely see the greatest thinning of ranks. 
</P>
<P>
"We do anticipate some exiting of farmers, particularly in the northern plains 
and part of the western Corn Belt," said Gregory Hanson, an Agriculture 
Department economist. He said the rate will be higher than in drought-recovered 
areas such as the South. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Noose Tightened 
</P>
<P>
"What we saw in 1988 was a tightening of the noose around the necks of some of 
the more heavily indebted farmers," explained Neil Harl, an Iowa State 
University economics professor. 
</P>
<P>
The most vulnerable farmers, he said, had little or no crop and no surplus. 
Prospects were even bleaker for those without crop insurance. 
</P>
<P>
A recent Agriculture Department report said the drought put 10,000 to 15,000 of 
550,000 commercial farmers on the ropes. That number would be doubled if not 
for a $3.9-billion federal aid package, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, experts don't expect widespread flight because 1986 and '87 were good 
crop years and the '80s' farm crisis already had forced out many on the edge. 
</P>
<P>
Risks remain for farmers in still dry areas such as eastern Iowa. A second 
straight bad year in 1989 could force them out. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer, who was renting 1,450 acres, didn't wait. 
</P>
<P>
He sold out in December after losing 75% of his corn and 35% of his soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
"You could compare it to being unemployed," he said. "There isn't any income 
coming in." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Couldn't Break Even 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer sold surplus grain and received a substantial disaster payment -- 
$52,000 -- but he wasn't close to breaking even. About two-thirds of his grain 
proceeds paid a government loan and the disaster aid went toward bank debts, 
Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, he added, his rent and planting costs were about $250,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
"A guy getting a paycheck for $20,000 to $30,000 . . . thinks, 'This guy got 
$52,000 from the government,' " he said. "People don't understand the amount it 
takes to operate a farm. It goes back to debt and land. It's not net money . . 
. . The farmer doesn't see it very long." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, without aid, "I would have had the banker breathing down my 
neck. I probably would have declared bankruptcy." 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer said he tired of living with too much stress and unsteadiness and too 
little satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
He endured four droughts since 1976 -- and 1988 was the worst. 
</P>
<P>
"You make money for three years, then a drought comes along," he said. "Then 
you lose everything you made in the last three." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Pain Than Pleasure 
</P>
<P>
"The last few years, it was more of a pain than enjoyment," Schaefer said. "I 
could see people coming home with a paycheck. My paycheck was a gamble . . . . 
Everytime I remotely start thinking about (farming), I think of a paycheck on 
Friday night. It's a sure thing." 
</P>
<P>
That's some solace for Schaefer, his wife, Susan, a part-time substitute 
teacher, and their two children. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 42. I'm looking at 65," Schaefer said. "If I'm doing this, every two-three 
years there's not going to be anything there. I want to get to a place where I 
can set money aside." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Schaefer said she, too, was "tired of the uncertainty. I wanted him to 
get out of it. But in the back of my head, I said, 'He's good at this.' " 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer's boom-to-bust tale started in 1971, when he began farming after 
earning an accounting degree. Gradually, he bought tens of thousands of 
dollars' worth of equipment, rented more acres and purchased a house. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was borrowing," he said. "You didn't want to say no if it was offered 
. . . . When you walked out the door of the bank, they said, 'Is that enough?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Land Values Plummet 
</P>
<P>
But in the '80s, interest rates soared, land values fell and Schaefer amassed 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. In 1985, he averted foreclosure but 
lost his house and farm in a settlement with the Federal Land Bank. His land, 
once worth $2,700 an acre, dropped to $800 an acre. 
</P>
<P>
The Schaefers moved nearby and continued farming. Despite the hard times, 
Schaefer said his banker urged him to continue in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"With a little creative financing, we could have survived," he conceded. "All 
you're doing is borrowing yourself more trouble . . . you're borrowing against 
the future . . . . I got tired of that." 
</P>
<P>
"He's very honorable," said Irene O'Meara, county Agricultural Stabilization 
and Conservation Service director. Her husband owned some of the land Schaefer 
rented. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot (of farmers) will stay in a year or two . . . and take bankruptcy. The 
creditors don't get paid," she said. "He said, 'I'll quit while I can still pay 
everybody off.' 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites Family Worries 
</P>
<P>
"He deserved better," O'Meara added, "but then what can you do? . . . . You go 
on hope for a few years. After a while, you don't feel it's fair to your 
family." 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer works the midnight to 8 a.m. shift at an auto stamping plant 21 miles 
away. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm starting closer to the bottom than I'd planned," he said. "I 
didn't expect to get a $30,000-a-year job. (But) I didn't expect trouble 
getting a $15,000 to $16,000 a year job. There's a lot of young stallions out 
there."

<P>
The upside, Schaefer said, is that for the first time in 22 years he has paid 
most of his debts, using proceeds from the sale of machinery and assets.

TRAVELER'S DIARY: INTRIGUING RUINS AT COBA AND TULUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
COBA, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today we breached the jungle at the "Queen City of the Yucatan," hub of a 
civilization that lasted for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
First explorations of the area were made in the late 1920s and early 1930s, but 
this once-vast city, most of whose estimated 6,500 structures remain hidden 
beneath a tangle of rain forest, did not really begin to be uncovered until 
1972. 
</P>
<P>
Maryknoll sisters arranged medicine and food drops until a landing strip was 
peeled away. Now, there is a road, and travelers who want a break from Cancun, 
roughly 100 miles away, can rumble in by bus. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other discoveries they will make at the end of a longish tramp along 
jungle trails is the Nohoch Mul pyramid, more than 120 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
It takes 120 aching steps to reach the top. But from that lofty perch one can 
survey pyramid mounds that rise above the plain and are especially visible when 
sunrise or sunset casts shadows over the endless carpet of green. 
</P>
<P>
Just to the left of Nohoch Mul is a 400-foot square leveled terrace bearing 
evidence of houses that once stood on what the archeologists call "The Great 
Platform." 
</P>
<P>
Near the plaza in front of the pyramid is a stele, or tablet, depicting a Mayan 
ruler standing atop two kneeling slaves, with two other slaves kneeling nearby. 
</P>
<P>
The Mayan culture endures, and candlesticks, money and flowers are often placed 
at the foot of monuments. Some of the stelae, covered now by straw canopies, 
are 10 to 15 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
Conveniently -- albeit almost incongruously -- a Club Med has risen at Coba. 
</P>
<P>
A two-story inn encircles a swimming pool and overlooks a thatched-roof 
pavilion. It offers air-conditioned rooms at $42 a night double occupancy, with 
breakfast an additional $5. 
</P>
<P>
Coba lies at the hub of several dozen ancient roads, one of them stretching 
almost 60 miles. These highways, both ceremonial and utilitarian, once formed 
the largest network in North America. 
</P>
<P>
A new 30-mile stretch from the inland jungle leads to the walled seaside city 
of Tulum. 
</P>
<P>
Our guide, Raul, insisted that Tulum does not mean "wall" as some believe, but 
rather "evil-smelling ground," a sobriquet it earned because of its location 
above and around mangrove swamps. 
</P>
<P>
He said the city was also called Zama, meaning dawn, and that, too, makes sense 
because from Tulum's clifftop perch one can see the sun rising out of the 
Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
Tulum, open and visible, with no hint of jungle to impair the view of its 
ruins, belongs to a period, perhaps AD 700 to 1000, when the Mayan civilization 
was already in decline. The earliest-known stela here is said to date from AD 
564, but there is some argument on this point; some insist that the tablet was 
carved elsewhere and transported here. 
</P>
<P>
There is little argument that the city-fort was constructed three centuries 
before the Spaniards first came ashore in 1518. The Spanish, viewing the city, 
called its most imposing structure El Castillo, the castle. 
</P>
<P>
Buses and rental cars are available daily in Cancun for the visit to Tulum with 
its myriad souvenir shacks. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the 30-mile spur road to Coba and the promise of its little inn, 
Tulum and Coba make for an unforgettable if somewhat exhausting trip.

SPIRIT OF OLD OSLO IS ALIVE ON ITS NEW WATERFRONT 
</P>

OSLO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Memory often gives us a view of the past through rose-colored glasses, so after 
an absence of more than 10 years I was apprehensive about returning to this 
Nordic capital, which I remembered so fondly. 
</P>
<P>
I wanted to view Aker Brygge, the new waterfront revitalization project, but I 
also hoped to find enough of the earlier Oslo to confirm my recollections. 
</P>
<P>
I needn't have worried. It was all here, much as I had left it. 
</P>
<P>
Oslo's setting is still spectacular, wrapped around the magnificent, 
island-studded Oslo Fiord that carves deeply into the southern junction of 
Norway and Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
Urban sprawl hasn't noticeably diminished the number of lush parks, forests, 
hills and playgrounds so abundant in and around the city. In fact, all building 
has been on less than 12% of Oslo's 175 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Easy to Explore 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the city always has been easy to explore on foot, concentrated as 
it is around the waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, one of the first things I did on my trip down memory lane was to 
take a walk along the main street, Karl Johansgate, from the Royal Palace on a 
gentle hill at one end to a beautiful, 300-year-old cathedral at the other. 
</P>
<P>
It was reassuring to pass the inviting shops and restaurants and see such other 
remembered landmarks as Norway's Parliament House, the National Theater, the 
University of Oslo and the nearby National Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
As I wandered I noted that statues, theaters and museums in Oslo continued to 
pay tribute to three of their most famous sons -- composer Edvard Grieg, 
playwright Henrik Ibsen and painter Edvard Munch. 
</P>
<P>
I found a bolder tribute a short bus ride from town at Frogner Park, home to 
the works of noted artist and sculptor Gustav Vigelund. 
</P>
<P>
In the 80-acre outdoor gallery are hundreds of massive unclothed figures, 
beautiful and bizarre, that the artist sculpted to depict the cycle of human 
life from birth to death. 
</P>
<P>
In Oslo I stay at the Hotel Continental across from the National Theater and 
near the palace and waterfront. Although it, too, has undergone some cosmetic 
changes it remains one of Oslo's most elegant hotels, with abundant Old World 
charm. 
</P>
<P>
At one corner of the hotel is one of my favorite places, the lively 
Theatercafeen, a Viennese-type cafe that is popular with the lunch and pre- and 
post-theater crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Others seek out the hotel's Continental Bar, a more subdued room lined with a 
collection of the omnipresent works of Munch. Or enjoy the Annen Etage for 
gourmet dining. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Waterfront Stroll 
</P>
<P>
Near the harbor, the Continental is around the corner and a few blocks down 
Roald Amundsgate from the waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
Overlooking the harbor is the city hall, a twin-towered block of red stone 
filled with murals, sculptures and paintings by many of Norway's contemporary 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
Completed in 1950 in time for the celebration of Oslo's 900th anniversary, its 
ostentatious design created almost as much controversy as Vigelund's 
sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
Facing the harbor with my back to city hall I could see the Akershus 
castle-fortress atop a promontory off to the left. 
</P>
<P>
Built by Haakon V in 1300, about the time he decided to make Oslo the capital 
of Norway, it is one of the oldest buildings in Norway. 
</P>
<P>
During World War II the Nazis used it as a headquarters. Vikdun Quisling, the 
infamous Norwegian traitor, was executed there. 
</P>
<P>
On its grounds are the Resistance and Defense museums, both appealing to World 
War II buffs. 
</P>
<P>
During an earlier visit, a group of fellow travelers and I had followed local 
custom -- we bought some prawns at the dock, then wandered over to the castle 
and climbed the parapets to sit and eat as we took in the spectacular view of 
the harbor, the outlying islands and Bygdoy, a peninsular suburb of Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
Bygdoy is the site of a collection of naval memorabilia: the Viking Ship 
Museum, with its three well-preserved Viking ships; the Fram Museum, with the 
polar ship Fram; the Kon Tiki Museum, with Thor Heyerdahl's raft, and the 
Norwegian Maritime Museum, with Roald Amunsen's Northwest Passage ship, the 
Gjoa. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Bygdoy is the Norwegian Folk Museum, a collection of 150 preserved old 
buildings from all parts of Norway. It's a worthwhile stop and easily reached 
by bus or ferry. 
</P>
<P>
My interest on this trip, however, was on the big change occurring on the right 
side of the harbor, across the bay from Akershus. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fisherman's Wharf 
</P>
<P>
I'd heard and read about Aker Brygge (Aker is a proper name and brygge means 
pier), the new "Fisherman's Wharf" of Oslo that was patterned after San 
Francisco's revitalized waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
I wanted to see whether the huge entertainment, shopping and residential 
project was "retaining the waterfront atmosphere" and "reestablishing a closer 
link between city and sea," as officials hoped, or whether it would wind up as 
another civic bone of contention. 
</P>
<P>
From my vantage point in front of city hall the view was encouraging. I could 
still see the outline and facades of the old warehouses and the long, 
wood-planked wharf where ferryboats were loading and unloading passengers. 
</P>
<P>
I followed the tide of pedestrians across the coast highway and headed to the 
wharf for a closer look. 
</P>
<P>
Pleasure hunters seemed to have found a target. Street performers drew 
appreciative crowds; children shrieked and laughed as they slid down the slides 
in a play area; throngs sipped and snacked around small tables that filled the 
ferry landing platforms and sidewalk cafes, or munched finger foods from food 
stands. From somewhere the music of a Dixieland band filled the air. 
</P>
<P>
Strolling the length of the promenade I saw that the shells of the old 
warehouses had, indeed, remained intact, though their interiors had been 
scooped out and another building added to create a spacious shopping mall. It 
is much like the larger ones in the United States, with specialty shops, 
restaurants and entertainment facilities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shops Galore 
</P>
<P>
Already open or scheduled to open this summer are shops offering designer 
clothes, beauty care, toys, books, interior design, art and gifts, in addition 
to a post office, bank, supermarket, nightclub and theater. 
</P>
<P>
To provide easier access, a new east-west highway and a new bus terminal are 
under construction to connect Aker Brygge with other parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, housing will be offered on upper floors and in buildings being 
built adjacent to the quayside shops. Walkways and plazas will connect them, 
and parking buildings will be built on the perimeter to keep the complex 
traffic-free. 
</P>
<P>
Also planned are an expanded marina, an enclosed aquatic center and a "fun and 
adventure" center scheduled for completion by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
As I sat at an outdoor table and watched the passengers pour off the ferryboats 
and stream in from town on foot, it was easy to see that Aker Brygge already 
had achieved its goal to renew the link between the city and sea. It also gave 
me a new memory of Oslo. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Rooms at the Continental begin at $120 double occupancy. A money saver is the 
Oslo Card, available at the tourist center and at many hotels. It offers 
discounts on many attractions and unlimited travel on public transportation.

FOOTLOOSE: TAMIL CULTURE THRIVING IN EASYGOING MADRAS

MADRAS, India 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few days here in the most Indian of all the country's major cities introduces 
you to a leisurely life style and gentle traditions. 
</P>
<P>
Madras and its state of Tamil Nadu on the Bay of Bengal, founded by Dravidians 
more than 5,000 years ago, have preserved their Tamil culture and language, 
remaining largely unaffected by Aryan invaders who diluted the literature, 
cuisine, architecture and arts of ancient India in the north. 
</P>
<P>
The British presence from 1639 until India's independence in 1947 left 
superficial marks and memories of the Raj era, with such anomalies as the Ice 
House, a building near the beach where ice was delivered by clipper ships from 
New England to cool the tall drinks favored by colonials in India's torrid 
climate. 
</P>
<P>
The self-assured and easygoing Tamils weathered the transient indignities of 
foreign rule, considering them mere slights in their long and colorful history. 
</P>
<P>
India's south has 75% of the nation's temples, and Tamil Nadu has them 
sprinkled from one end to the other in great profusion. The Dravidian temples 
are unlike those of the north, having a distinct architectural style and 
riotous colors that have caused some to liken them to "an Indian Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
Getting here: British Airways flies to Madras with a London stop. Pan Am flies 
to Bombay with two stops, then on to Madras via Indian Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? Madras requires three days, including two for day trips to 
the temple towns of Mamallapuram and Kanchipuram. You'll find lodging and 
dining costs moderate for a big city. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: India's rupee recently traded at about 15 to the dollar, or 
.066 each. Madras is warm year-round, April and May being the hottest months. 
Its coolest season is the same as our winter, with monsoons playing havoc from 
June through September. 
</P>
<P>
You'll need a visa. Malaria pills should be taken before, during and after your 
trip. Always slake your thirst with mineral water, pop, beer or fresh lime with 
soda. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled in: Enchanting Connemara (Binny Road; $53 double), Madras' 
oldest luxury hotel, has been a home away from home for very pukka Britons 
since it opened in 1904. Now a member of the Taj Group, it combines the large 
rooms and brisk service of yesteryear's hotel, yet boasts the latest amenities, 
including a beautiful pool/courtyard area at the center. 
</P>
<P>
Taj Coromandel (17 Nungambakkam High Road; $70 double) is considered the city's 
finest, another Taj Group hotel with comfortable rooms, hair dryers in 
bathrooms, a pool and several fine restaurants, including the Szechuan Golden 
Dragon. 
</P>
<P>
Savera (69 Dr. Radhakrishnan Road; $46) is a touch of luxury at a budget price, 
a modern hotel in the city center with fine bedrooms having views of the pool 
area and city. There's a great bar with beautiful wicker furniture and a choice 
of Indian, Moghlai, Chinese and continental dining. 
</P>
<P>
Temple Bay Ashok Beach Resort (Mamallapuram; $39 double) is another bargain, 
even with the $10 cab ride from town. It's a handsome resort near the temple 
town, giving you a choice of a room in the main building or your own 
thatch-roof cottage on a piling, the Bay of Bengal beach at the foot of your 
stairs. There's a private beach, pool and a truly lovely dining room with views 
of Mamallapuram temples in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: Southern India is the original home of the thali, a 
Tamil meal of from four to eight dishes or pots placed on either a metal tray 
or banana leaf. Orthodox Tamils are vegetarians, so your thali will usually 
have rice at the center, surrounded by pots of dhal (lentils) and other curried 
vegetables such as cauliflower, eggplant and peas. There's often a thin soup, 
sometimes a sweet dessert, and the hot rice keeps coming. 
</P>
<P>
Dosas of thin bread made of lentils-and-rice flour are also a Tamil specialty, 
served with coconut chutney and other spicy sauces or filled with a masala 
mixture of curried vegetable for breakfast; it's a great way to start the day. 
</P>
<P>
The British lay claim to mulligatawny, a thick pepper-and-lentils soup, but 
Tamils tell us it was here long before the British arrived. Madras is the place 
to go for marvelous curried prawn, shrimp and fish. 
</P>
<P>
Good dining: Rain Tree (Connemara Hotel) is a garden restaurant so romantic and 
beautiful that you hate to leave its tinkling fountain and lush foliage. A 
sod-roof gazebo serves as a bar-buffet counter, an ancient rain tree at the 
center and the Chettinad cuisine of South India. 
</P>
<P>
Try the nandu kara kuzhambu, crab cooked in a spiced gravy of the Chettinad 
region. Or have the prawns, fish or mutton in the same gravy. There are also 
seafood, lamb and vegetables prepared with kurmah gravy, made from subtle 
spices thickened with coconut milk. With Indian music and dance every evening, 
the Rain Tree is indeed a small spot of Eden. 
</P>
<P>
Mysore (Taj Coromandel Hotel) is a small room with Indian decor and a silver 
vase with single rose on each table. Dishes come from the four corners of 
India. A dancer performs the classic Bharatanatyam, 1,800-year-old temple 
dances of the region, under a silken canopy. 
</P>
<P>
The seafood tandooris are excellent here, rice biryanis their equal. And there 
are lots of irresistible Indian desserts. 
</P>
<P>
Silver Sands (Mamallapuram Beach), a casual, rustic and very inexpensive beach 
hotel ($25 double), has a thatch-roof dining area right in the sand. This is 
the place to order your thali, served on a plantain leaf and going for $1 to 
$2.75. Or spring for $9 and a huge lobster from the grill. Silver Sands is a 
very international stop; we saw Russian tour groups looking for a bargain. We 
joined them in the spirit of glasnost. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: Visit the colorful San Thome Cathedral for the rather arresting 
sight of an altar with a statue of Jesus rising from a lotus blossom, peacocks 
at either side, often a garland of jasmine around his neck. Doubting St. Thomas 
is said to be buried here. 
</P>
<P>
Madras' Kapaleeswarar Temple is a study in ancient Dravidian architecture 
dedicated to the god Shiva. The fragrances of roses, jasmine and lilies hang 
heavy in the air, originating in stalls around the temple where the flowers are 
sold as offerings. 
</P>
<P>
The Government Museum and Art Gallery, on Pantheon Road, has a magnificent 
collection of bronzes going back to the 9th Century, including one of a dancing 
Shiva at the entrance that is reproduced all over India. 
</P>
<P>
Make time for the 38-mile ride to Mamallapuram and its gigantic granite 
bas-reliefs, carved between AD 600 and 850 during the Pallava dynasty. Those 
craftsmen also carved a monolithic village of temples from the solid granite, 
now often covered by climbing goats and surrounded by grinning schoolchildren 
on field trips. 
</P>
<P>
Kanchipuram, one of India's seven most sacred towns and a center for Madras 
cotton and silk weaving, is said to convey eternal happiness to its visitors. 
Known as the Golden City of Temples, it dates back to the 2nd Century and was 
later capital of the Pallava dynasty. There are 124 temples here, 108 to Shiva 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
For more information: Call the Government of India Tourist Office at (213) 
380-8855, or write (3550 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 204, Los Angeles 90010) for a 
brochure on Madras, another on all of India, plus a map of the country. Ask for 
the Madras package.

HOW TO PUT SOME BITE IN A MANHATTAN BUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM UPTON, Times Staff Writer

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most women don't like being referred to as cheap. I consider it a compliment. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it is good value that I admire. Whether it's an expensive meal or an 
inexpensive bus ride, all I ask is that the return reflect the investment. 
</P>
<P>
This holds true, too, when dining in New York City, where a corned-beef 
sandwich in a theater-district deli can cost more than $10, and receiving the 
dinner check can ruin even my appetite. 
</P>
<P>
So for fun, exercise and good value, here's a progressive dinner that combines 
eating in a variety of locations with a stroll and $1 bus ride through the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Start on the Upper East Side at what was originally an automat but has been 
transformed, by time and economics, into the Horn &amp; Hardart Dine-O-Mat, 942 
3rd Ave. between 56th and 57th streets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bit of Nostalgia 
</P>
<P>
See the automat you remember from childhood turned into a bit of nostalgia. 
It's a frightening thought. Don't linger on it. Sip a soft drink or a pink 
caddy, made with pineapple, grapefruit and lime juices with vodka and creme de 
noy, and ponder your first date in a car, if you can remember that far back. 
</P>
<P>
Next, saunter a few blocks south for high-quality sushi at Nippon, 155 East 
52nd St. Or you can phone in an order -- (213) 355-9020 -- to take back to your 
hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
Two can eat an assortment of 14 pieces of sushi for $17. With a cup of tea or a 
bottle of beer, it makes an excellent light meal. You can also order sushi by 
the piece at Nippon and sit in. Prices are about $2.10 to $3.50 per piece. 
</P>
<P>
For the next course, ramble a few blocks east and south to Market Street, 900 
2nd Ave., just south of 48th Street, for great antipasto or a curried chicken 
salad sandwich on rye. Sandwiches are about $5 to $6.50. 
</P>
<P>
This is not an eat-in kind of place, so grab your snack and eat it while you 
walk west to Fifth Avenue and north two blocks to St. Patrick's Cathedral. Drop 
in for some visual candy. Even though there is nothing to eat there, it's worth 
the time. Turn south for your next course. 
</P>
<P>
By the time you reach Lord &amp; Taylor at 424 Fifth Ave., you should be ready 
for a little shopping and a generous bowl of Scotch broth. To find the broth, 
go to the 10th-floor restaurant, the Soup Bar. Fragrant with lamb, the 
delicious soup is filled with vegetables and barley and served with as many 
crackers as you can eat. For $3.75, it's good food and great value. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warm Spinach Knish 
</P>
<P>
Following soup, wander west to pick up a 2nd Avenue bus south to Houston 
Street, where you will find Yonah Schimmel, 137 E. Houston St., between 1st and 
2nd avenues. There you'll devour one last snack: a potato and spinach knish. 
Ask for it to be warmed. Although the cost of about $1.15 may seem sturdy, it's 
an excellent price per pound . . . for both you and the knish. 
</P>
<P>
From Yonah Schimmel, trek a few blocks east and south to Dean and DeLuca, 560 
Broadway, for a finale of excellent cappuccino ($1.50), the best bargain in the 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Dean and DeLuca is sort of a Sak's Fifth Avenue for food. Currently fashionable 
are dried beans from all nations and dried chiles at prices so high that 
Californians accustomed to seeing them for pennies will laugh out loud. 
Suppress that desire. You wouldn't want the New Yorkers to think you feel 
superior. 
</P>
<P>
From there you can wander the streets of SoHo and see all the locals looking 
fashionable but hungry. You won't be. 
</P>
<P>
Another trick for newly arrived Californians, who, with the three-hour time 
difference, probably aren't enthusiastic about food until noon anyway, is to 
eat a late breakfast and schedule a lighter meal at dinner time. 
</P>
<P>
Popover Cafe, 551 Amsterdam (between 86th and 87th streets), has omelets, 
sandwiches and salads. Try the smoked chicken with Gruyere and sauteed onions. 
It's worth the calories. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Giant Popovers 
</P>
<P>
But the giant popovers with strawberry butter are the real reason to go. Good 
value, at less than $10 a person, with coffee. Dinner also is served, but 
prices are slightly higher. Entrees run from about $12 to $17. 
</P>
<P>
SarahBeth's Kitchen, at two locations -- 1295 Madison Ave. and 423 Amsterdam 
Ave. -- are good places for breakfast, lunch or brunch. For breakfast, order 
Goldie Lox, which is scrambled eggs with bits of lox and chunks of cream 
cheese, or Pa Pa Bear Porridge, served with strawberries, raisins and honey. 
Also order a pumpkin muffin. 
</P>
<P>
For lunch, try a smoked mozzarella sandwich with avocado served on homemade 
seven-grain bread. Or order a pecan-breaded chicken-breast sandwich. Breads, 
muffins and jams are made at the restaurants. Breakfast or lunch can be under 
$10 per person, including coffee. 
</P>
<P>
If you are short of cash or for some odd reason not hungry, make your breakfast 
a fresh bran and blueberry muffin and herb tea at Between the Bread, 141 East 
56th St. at $1.75 per muffin. They are big, filling and not very sweet, a 
characteristic some misguided souls would consider an attribute. Despite that 
defect, they are enjoyable. 
</P>
<P>
Or grab a wonderful carrot, coconut, raisin and walnut Glorious Morning muffin 
($1.25) at Cafe Buongiorno at the Market at Citicorp Center, 53rd and 54th 
streets, between Lexington and 3rd Avenues, and eat it in the enclosed Atrium. 
</P>
<P>
Also, cookies and brownies and other foods of questionable nutritional value 
are available. The health-minded will skip those, of course. But if you know 
someone who eats cookies, tell him that the rainbow colored squares covered in 
chocolate are delightful . . . or so I'm told. 
</P>
<P>
And while you are sampling some of the modest-cost foods of New York City, hope 
for sunshine. Eating in the rain isn't fun. But if it is raining, grab a taxi 
or, better yet, hire a limo. 
</P>

THE TIMES SHOPPER: CARRYING ON ABOUT LUGGAGE AND OTHER GADGETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER MERIN, Merin is a New York City free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Successful shopping sprees can be greatly aided by practical preparation in the 
form of sturdy, efficient luggage. 
</P>
<P>
Luggage manufacturers offer hard-sided (more protective, but heavier) or 
soft-sided (more stuffable) cases in a great many sizes and shapes, in plain 
colors or patterns, with a variety of pockets and special features, and with or 
without wheels (either built-in or removable). 
</P>
<P>
Choosing isn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
However, interviews with a random sampling of luggage retailers nationwide, 
found that two manufacturers, Tumi and Andiamo, were consistently mentioned. 
Both manufacturers are known for their durable and functional products. Tumi's 
style is conservative and businesslike. Andiamo is more sporty. Both use 
super-rugged nylon, offer long-term guarantees and are similarly priced. 
</P>
<P>
Tumi's line includes carryalls and carry-ons, as well as large and small 
suitcases with optional wheels. 
</P>
<P>
Available in cowhide (black or brown) or 1050 Denier Ballistic nylon (black, 
navy or sage), Tumi luggage is popular with business travelers who carry 
five-suit ($525 in leather, $335 in nylon) or tri-fold garment bags ($475 in 
leather, $295 in nylon), both with convenient U-shaped pockets, plus 
overnighter/briefcases ($295 in leather, $195 in nylon). 
</P>
<P>
Acquisitive travelers should put the packed garment bag into an empty suitcase, 
then carry purchases home in the suitcase. Or use a small suitcase inside a 
larger one. Nylon suitcases (with strong and collapsible poplar wood frames) in 
24-inch ($250), 27-inch ($275) or 30-inch ($295) lengths are best bets. 
</P>
<P>
When full, 32-inch cases ($315) may exceed airline weight limits; 21-inch 
($225) cases are as small as carry-ons. Tumi's sturdy zippers are designed to 
avoid stress; wheels ($20 per set) are optional. 
</P>
<P>
Tumi is sold in Los Angeles at H. Savinar (4625 W. Washington Blvd.; discounted 
prices on Tumi and other brands) and By Design (at the Beverly Center in West 
Hollywood). For brochures and/or other retailers, call toll-free (800) 
322-TUMI. 
</P>
<P>
Tutto, neither as well known nor as widely distributed, makes distinctive 
luggage that conveniently functions as both a suitcase and a luggage cart. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stable Enough to Stack 
</P>
<P>
Tutto's attractive high-tech, square-shaped bags are made of durable vinyl that 
has been securely attached to lightweight metal frames on balanced castor 
wheels. The sturdy cases are stable enough to stack (or carry additional 
luggage, piggyback-style). They also can be wheeled about with U-shaped metal 
handles. 
</P>
<P>
Available in 28-inch ($130), 26-inch ($115) and 20-inch ($90) sizes in black, 
gray, navy or gray-gold, the cases collapse to a width of 2 1/2 inches for easy 
storage or packing inside each other. 
</P>
<P>
Tutto cases, which have a five-year guarantee, are sold at H. Savinar, 
Industrial Revolution (7560 Melrose Ave.), Fred Segal in Santa Monica (500 
Broadway) or through the American Airlines catalogue. For more retailers, call 
(415) 873-0254. 
</P>
<P>
Several luggage carts are recommended. A handsome high-tech collapsible model 
made of black anodized aluminum and gold-colored polyamide plastic, weighing 2 
pounds and able to carry up to 66 pounds, is featured in the New York Museum of 
Modern Art's catalogue for $90. Call (800) 447-6662. 
</P>
<P>
Brookstone, of Peterborough, N.H., offers a big-wheeled aluminum dolly ($55) 
with an optional case ($19) that carries up to 200 pounds. Call (603) 924-9541. 
</P>
<P>
The flight attendant's luggage trolley from Hammacher-Schlemmer ($89.95) 
carries up to 175 pounds and has retractable rear wheels for extra support. The 
store is at 309 N. Rodeo Drive, Beverly Hills, or call (800) 543-3366. 
</P>
<P>
If luggage pops open, extra bindings can prevent loss. Construct bindings by 
buckling together several old belts, or order strong nylon straps (72 inches 
long with buckles, in black or blue) from Le Travel Store (295 Horton Plaza, 
San Diego, (800) 854-6677) for $4.25 (other stores charge $10 and up). 
</P>
<P>
In addition to sets of small plastic bottles and kits for manicures/sewing, 
other invaluable packing accessories include Brookstone's see-through vinyl 
cases ($10 to $14) and special shoe suitcases (which can hold up to eight pairs 
of shoes, for $55) and Le Travel Store's see-through net ditty bags ($4 to $5), 
multipocket garment-bag organizers ($15 to $19) and shoe sacks (two pairs for 
$5.95). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Zippered Portfolio 
</P>
<P>
For organizing travel documents, credit cards, checks, currency and receipts, 
Yamani's sleek 23-pocket zippered portfolio of soft leather is available from 
The Sharper Image, (800) 344-4444, for $119. 
</P>
<P>
Although it's advisable to travel with few encumbrances and as light as 
possible, several gadgets are well worth their weight in comfort and security. 
Inflatable pillows fit around the neck to allow for comfortable dozing and to 
prevent stiffness on plane or train rides. Available from Brookstone ($9.50) 
and Le Travel Store (adult and children's sizes, $9.95). 
</P>
<P>
For safeguarding valuables and travel documents, Le Travel Store has waterproof 
cases to be worn around the neck ($9.75) or waist ($10), or looped over a belt 
and tucked inside trousers ($8, or $18.50 for a leather version from 
Brookstone). 
</P>
<P>
Le Travel Store's secret-pocket belt is in twill ($20), Brookstone's is leather 
($27.50). Traveler's Checklist (335 Cornwall Bridge Road), Sharon, Conn. 06069, 
(203) 364-0144) offers lock and bolt devices that secure drawers or doors 
($11.50), while Brookstone sells small combination safes ($35) that clamp on 
door knobs, and portable alarms ($37.50) that sound when someone touches the 
doorknob to which they're connected. 
</P>
<P>
For personal safety, the Traveler's Instant Fire Escape ($395, exclusively at 
Hammacher-Schlemmer) features 130 feet of stainless-steel cable (weighing 8 1/2 
pounds) that enables an adult (with child) to exit a burning high-rise hotel 
when other means of escape are not available. 
</P>
<P>
Health-related products include the Salt-Chek Sodium Sensor ($35, Sharper 
Image), a small, probe-like device that measures salt content in airplane or 
restaurant food, and the Brita Travel Water Filter (about $10 at The Broadway, 
Robinson's and health-food stores, or call (800) 537-2823). The latter is said 
to remove up to 90% of the chlorine, copper and lead from tap water and prevent 
the growth of bacteria in water that has been filtered. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Converting Currencies 
</P>
<P>
Pocket-size computers instantly convert foreign currencies into dollar amounts 
($15, Le Travel Store) or translate frequently used words into five languages 
(English, French, Spanish, Italian and German; $79 from Sharper Image or $84.50 
from Hammacher-Schlemmer). 
</P>
<P>
The Talking Alarm Clock ($124.75, Hammacher-Schlemmer) announces the time in 20 
cities in 24 time zones and has a readout with time and date at your present 
location. 
</P>
<P>
Hammacher-Schlemmer boasts the world's smallest camera, the Minox EC ($301). 
Measuring 1 3/16 inches by 3/8 inch, it weighs only .15 ounce and fits into 
your palm.

THE BARGAIN CORNER: PASSES FOR DOWN UNDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK ADLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here are several programs to consider for Australia. 
</P>
<P>
The Austrailpass offered by Railways of Australia is available in first or 
economy class for consecutive periods of 14, 21, 30, 60 or 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the current rate of exchange, the 14-day pass costs about $567 U.S. 
first-class and $347 for economy, with the 21-day pass going for about $711 and 
$446, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Deluxe Coachline offers a Koala Pass for 7, 10, 14, 21, 30, 60 and 90 days, 
about $185 for seven days and $238 for 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
Even better rates -- about 30% off the Koala Pass fares -- are offered on the 
Space Pass. However, this pass involves traveling on a standby basis, though 
seats can be confirmed up to four hours before departure. The Space Pass is 
issued in the same time periods as the Koala Pass, starting at $131 for seven 
days and $167 for 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
The Aussie Wanderer Pass provides discount rates for four itineraries around 
Australia. The pass can be used anywhere on the routes and for up to 12 months. 
A key restriction is that you can't repeat a place unless it's part of the 
routing. 
</P>
<P>
There are also several directional passes. For example, the 30-day Reef Pass 
covers the area between Cairns and Brisbane, which includes the Great Barrier 
Reef. You have to travel in one direction only, without backtracking. 
</P>
<P>
All of the programs are good until Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Pioneer, another Australian motor coach, has Aussiepasses for 7, 10, 15, 21, 30 
and 60 days, starting at $176 for the seven-day pass. A Super Aussiepass 
combines accommodations with the coach passes. 
</P>
<P>
Contact travel agents or Australian Travel Service at (800) 232-2121, Extension 
840. 
</P>
<P>
Greyhound Australia has a bus pass starting at $176 for seven days. On the 15-, 
21-, 30- and 60-day passes, you can stay up to seven days at a place without 
this time counting against your pass. 
</P>
<P>
Mount Cook Line of New Zealand offers a 9-, 12-, 18-, 14-, 32- and 45-day 
Downunder Coach Pass good for travel in both New Zealand and Australia. The 
nine-day version is $221.

HER WORLD: BEATING FREEDOM'S PATH ALONG STREETS OF BOSTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MORGAN, Morgan, of La Jolla, is a magazine and newspaper writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I asked the taxi driver to wait while I dropped my suitcase at the Lenox Hotel 
across from the Boston Public Library. I had come straight from the airport and 
was overdue for a gathering at the Globe Corner Bookstore on School Street. 
</P>
<P>
This bookstore, on the rock-bound Freedom Trail, is both old and new. Its 
red-brick Yankee exterior dates to 1718; its mellow interior -- a mix of maple 
and cherry cabinetry, fine lighting and fragrant books -- is from the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, I climbed gleaming wooden stairs and greeted some proper Bostonians. 
Then I excused myself to hang up my trench coat and search for a ladies room. 
As I stepped into the hallway a door shut behind me. And locked. 
</P>
<P>
I rapped on the door, but no one could hear through the muffle of the cloakroom 
and the babble of the party. I began looking for help. Two flights up, a man 
was working at the Historic Boston Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Familiar Route 
</P>
<P>
He led me down to the street, unlocked a side door and pointed toward the 
corner. I knocked on the Globe Bookstore door and was admitted by the same 
young clerk as before. I shrugged, rather than explain. He shrugged, rather 
than ask. 
</P>
<P>
As I once again climbed the gleaming stairs, the manager was describing how 
this Early American building had been saved by the Historic Boston Foundation. 
I felt a link because Historic Boston had just saved me. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years the brick building, with its graceful gambrel roof, served as 
private home and publishing house for books and periodicals, including the 
Atlantic Monthly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Literary Characters 
</P>
<P>
The Old Corner Bookstore opened there in 1829, and provided haven for such 
literary characters as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and 
Ralph Waldo Emerson. 
</P>
<P>
After stints as a hat shop, haberdashery and tobacco store, the ground floor 
became the King-of-Pizza parlor. When urban renewal threatened demolition in 
the 1960s, Historic Boston intervened. 
</P>
<P>
The bookstore is one of the landmarks on Boston's Freedom Trail, a 2 1/2-mile 
walk that begins at Boston Common, the oldest public park in America. 
</P>
<P>
You are guided along the trail by a wide red line painted on bricks and 
sidewalks. It passes the Old State House and the site of the Boston Massacre, a 
1770 skirmish between British troops and protesters in which five colonists 
died. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rainy Afternoon 
</P>
<P>
Several of us left the bookshop at dusk on that rainy afternoon and strolled 
toward the waterfront and Faneuil Hall. Our destination was The European, a 
North End Italian eatery. Thin, crisp-crust pizza was the order of the evening. 
A nearby table of Chicago natives kept insisting that there was no pizza like 
home, but the waiters ignored such an aberrant notion. 
</P>
<P>
Pizza is big in Boston, which is better known for beans, chowder and lobster. A 
card in my hotel room touted "pizza made fresh in our kitchen and delivered 
piping hot to your room." When I checked in, the bellman turned the TV on to 
the Red Sox game at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Pizza and beer and baseball," he said in an Aussie accent. "There's a winner." 
</P>
<P>
Boston is a consummate walking town, and pizza is not the sole reason. A 
compact maze of crooked lanes, cobblestones and winsome, unsigned streets 
fosters the urge to explore. It is not an easy path, and motorists seem to 
invent their own rules. 
</P>
<P>
On another Boston trip, when I had a rental car and a couple of baffling maps, 
I asked a taxi driver for directions. He shrugged and said in an Old World way: 
"Follow me. I don't know how to explain you." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Restoration Notices 
</P>
<P>
My recent weekend was far from calm. The Lenox is in the throes of restoration. 
Steam heat hisses at odd times. A notice on a thermostat near my closet read: 
"Too hot or too cold? Construction is under way to install a state-of-the-art 
heating/air conditioning system. The thermostat at this location will afford 
you individual climate control -- by the fall of 1989." I could not wait, so I 
opened the window. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel also was wrapped in cops and barricades because it's at the finish 
line of the Boston Marathon, America's oldest annual footrace. Almost 6,500 
runners signed up for the 93rd running, which starts 26.2 miles to the west, in 
Hopkinton, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
On that same day, two lads re-enacted the April ride of Paul Revere and his 
less-remembered cohort, William Dawes. And the anniversary of the revolutionary 
battle of Lexington and Concord pitted costumed Redcoats against Patriots on 
the Lexington Green.

As I checked out of The Lenox a sign in the hall made me smile:

The marathon affects all walks of life.

<P>
Boy George is at it again, challenging the conventions of the pop-music 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
George, who six years ago made the androgynous look acceptable for everybody 
from grandmas to little kiddies, has his first Top 10 hit in years. 
</P>
<P>
But there's a twist: The song, "Don't Take My Mind on a Trip," is a hit only at 
radio stations that specialize in black music (such as KACE-FM in Los Angeles). 
Pop-oriented stations (such as local powerhouse KIIS-FM) have passed on the 
record. 
</P>
<P>
The record is up to No. 6 on the black-music chart in the current issue of 
Billboard magazine, but isn't even listed on the Hot 100 pop chart. 
</P>
<P>
It's not unusual for a white artist to land a hit in the black-music field, as 
the success of recent singles by George Michael and Sheena Easton attests. But 
their songs were also big hits at pop radio. It's unprecedented for a single by 
a white pop artist to be a hit only on black stations. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, George has made a career of defying the norm. 
</P>
<P>
Think back to February, 1984. The Englishman's group, Culture Club, had just 
won the Grammy Award as best new artist, and George was addressing a national 
TV audience. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to thank America for knowing a good drag queen when they see one," 
deadpanned the gender-bending star. 
</P>
<P>
The remark got a big laugh. But then why shouldn't it? George, just 22 at the 
time, was the toast of the music business. "Karma Chameleon," Culture Club's 
fifth straight Top 10 single, was just coming down from the No. 1 spot. And the 
group's second album, "Colour by Numbers," was hanging tough at No. 2 -- just 
behind Michael Jackson's invincible "Thriller." 
</P>
<P>
George's fame extended far beyond records. He was a media celebrity, 
interviewed on "Face the Nation" and a Barbara Walters special. He was a 
favorite sparring partner of Joan Rivers on "The Tonight Show." He 
guest-starred opposite Mr. T on "The A-Team." He was listed as one of the 
world's 10 sexiest men in Playgirl magazine. One Halloween, Boy George costumes 
were a favorite of party-goers and trick-or-treaters. 
</P>
<P>
But George's ride on the roller coaster was brief. By the end of 1984, the fizz 
had gone out of Culture Club's frothy mix of pop, R &amp; B, reggae and dance 
music. The records stopped selling and ultimately the group broke up. Boy 
George looked like a classic backlash case. 
</P>
<P>
That was the least of George's troubles. In 1986, he was convicted in London 
for possession of heroin and treated for addiction. The same year, a musician 
died of a drug overdose at George's London home. Many expected George to become 
the next rock 'n' roll casualty. 
</P>
<P>
But George (full name: George O'Dowd) has been laboring to get his personal and 
professional lives back on track, with mixed results. 
</P>
<P>
His solo debut album for Virgin Records, "Sold," scarcely made a ripple in 
1987. Sales of his second album, "High Hat," have been sluggish since its 
release two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
But the acceptance of "Don't Take My Mind on a Trip" at black-oriented radio 
stations has finally brought a glimmer of light to the Boy George story. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of George's record says a lot about the politics of radio, the 
fickleness of fame, and the dangers of overexposure. It also raises several 
questions: 
</P>
<P>
* Was there really a public backlash to Boy George, or was it a media backlash? 
</P>
<P>
* If George is shunned by pop stations, why is he welcomed at black stations? 
</P>
<P>
* How did George go from being the toast of the music business to a virtual 
pariah? 
</P>
<P>
* Can he make a comeback? 
</P>
<P>
On the set of "The Arsenio Hall Show" at Paramount Studios recently, Hall was 
interviewing George by satellite from London. The singer couldn't be here in 
person because he lost his visa after the drug conviction. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's talk about America and England," Hall began. "Who's been the most 
forgiving as far as what you've been through and what you've done?" 
</P>
<P>
George thought for a second and replied, "My mother." 
</P>
<P>
Boy George hasn't lost his knack for the clever quote. 
</P>
<P>
But a moment later he grew more serious. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a big difference between the public and the media," he said. "With the 
press it's the story. You're Ben Johnson, you're Elton John. . . . You're a 
story, you're not a person." 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview the same day from his home in London, George -- who is 
writing songs for a Culture Club reunion album -- said radio can also be a 
harsher judge than the public. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult to decide who's cutting you off," he said. "Is it the 
public or is it a few people at radio stations? The public isn't necessarily of 
the same mind as the radio people, but if they don't hear a record, they're not 
going to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been very difficult for me with white radio in America since my 
troubles," he said. "It's been very hard to get any kind of warming from them." 
</P>
<P>
Industry figures disagree on the extent to which the public has turned against 
George. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Wyatt, program director of Los Angeles' No. 1 radio station, KPWR-FM 
(which is playing the record), said that George has a loyal, enthusiastic core 
of fans. 
</P>
<P>
"The response to Boy George is always incredible," Wyatt said. "Despite his 
troubles, he has one of the most dedicated followings that we've ever seen. I'm 
not sure that Boy George has a negative image. I would guess that 50% of the 
audience doesn't give a damn one way or the other. And 20% may be crazy about 
him -- and they tend to be active, the kind who write letters and call in. Now, 
you weigh them against the negatives and the apathy, and you have a different 
picture." 
</P>
<P>
Rob Kahane, who co-manages George Michael, offered a much bleaker assessment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's yesterday's news," Kahane said flatly. "I don't think people are 
that interested in him. I don't think a radio station is going to sell any more 
commercial time because they're playing a Boy George song, and 'Don't Take My 
Mind on a Trip' isn't an important enough song for them to take a chance on. 
It's good but there's not a lot of depth to it. If I was a programmer, I 
wouldn't take the chance." 
</P>
<P>
Phil Quartararo, Virgin Records' senior vice president of marketing and 
promotion, acknowledged the resistance to George, but said, "I think there are 
a lot of Boy George fans out there. My impression is that the media and the 
industry are afraid of George." 
</P>
<P>
Quartararo pointed out that the American public tends to forgive some fallen 
heroes but not others. 
</P>
<P>
"How many times did we see the Rolling Stones get busted? How many times did we 
hear the stories about Liberace -- and yet he found his way into all of our 
grandmothers' homes. The question is how they choose and whom they choose to 
freeze out." 
</P>
<P>
What's the main reason that "Don't Take My Mind on a Trip" has been embraced at 
black radio stations? You can answer that question in two words: Teddy Riley. 
</P>
<P>
Riley, who supervised "Trip" with his partner Gene Griffin, is so hot right now 
that his name on a record is enough to get it in the door at most 
black-oriented radio stations. Among the team's hits: Bobby Brown's "My 
Prerogative" and Johnny Kemp's "Just Got Paid." 
</P>
<P>
"To a certain extent it's the song, not the singer," said Ed Eckstine, senior 
vice president of Wing Records. "Let's face it: 'Trip' sounds like any number 
of Teddy Riley records with Boy singing it. I think there may be a significant 
number of people who hear that record on the dance floor and don't know that 
it's Boy George -- and don't care. All they know is that it's a slamming Teddy 
Riley groove." 
</P>
<P>
Quartararo said that the main reason for the disparity is that pop stations 
rely more on research. 
</P>
<P>
"The more research-oriented they are, the more image-conscious they become and 
right now they're really research-crazy," he said. "Pop stations are more 
perception-oriented while black radio just plays a song because it's a good 
song." 
</P>
<P>
"Live My Life," the first single from Boy George's "Sold" album, was a much 
bigger hit at black radio than at pop radio. So George expected black radio to 
be the path of least resistance again. 
</P>
<P>
"It was clear that that was the route to take," he said. "You go where you're 
wanted in this world. They seem to be a bit more open-minded on black radio at 
the moment as regards Boy George. They're not looking at it in a political way 
at all. If they like the record and it has a good groove, they'll play it. 
That's the way music should be." 
</P>
<P>
What's the main reason for George's fall from grace? 
</P>
<P>
That's a tough one. 
</P>
<P>
"He had so many negatives," said John David Kalodner, an A &amp; R executive at 
Geffen Records. "I think it's the combination of everything about him. He 
didn't do much to help his career. He was a big superstar and he did everything 
he could to turn everybody off." 
</P>
<P>
George's drug use was a major factor, especially because he had such a young 
following. But if drug problems alone banish artists from the airwaves, such 
commercial hotshots as Guns N' Roses would be out of the business. 
</P>
<P>
George's bisexuality was also a factor. "It definitely limits you in the 
Midwest," said Kahane. "It alienates a very large audience -- both male and 
female. Kids outside of the major metropolitan areas aren't receptive to that." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the flamboyance that made him a star also hurt him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that George has changed so much, it's that society has changed so 
much relative to George," Virgin's Quartararo said. "Our society is much more 
conservative than it was six years ago. Society is much more willing to pass 
judgement on an artist like that right now." 
</P>
<P>
Another problem, according to Kahane, was the fact that George didn't grow 
musically. "I don't think he ever transcended that first record," he said. 
"Culture Club's first album was so fresh and vibrant, but after that, the music 
just didn't hold up. He never grew musically from that Motowny pop sound." 
</P>
<P>
Overexposure was another key factor, especially because George's image was so 
extreme and cartoonish. 
</P>
<P>
"He really went over the top," said Ron DeBlasio, who co-manages X. "The only 
person he didn't take pictures with was Morton Downey Jr. He was there at every 
opening of every manhole. 
</P>
<P>
"After a certain point, he should have laid low and kept quiet. When Joan 
Rivers starts mentioning you in her act and the mention of your name 
automatically gets a laugh, you're in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the biggest factor in George's decline is that audiences like to 
align themselves with winners. At the moment, they see George Michael and 
Whitney Houston as winners, but they see Boy George as a loser, and worse than 
that, as a schmuck -- someone who had it all and lost it all through stupidity 
and self-indulgence. 
</P>
<P>
Said Kahane: "When people think of Boy George, they think of drugs. They think 
of a loser. And pop radio doesn't play that. He needs to put an image out there 
that is much more consistent with what a winner is all about." 
</P>
<P>
George didn't sound tense or uncomfortable as he discussed the factors that 
contributed to his decline. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference between me and a lot of artists is that I've never tried to be 
anything else than what I am," he said. "What you see is what you get. I'd 
rather be a schmuck than be schmaltzy." 
</P>
<P>
What does George think is the main reason for the backlash? 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's easy to kick a freak when he's down," he said dryly -- and if 
there's a trace of bitterness in his remark, there is also a lot of truth. 
</P>
<P>
George said that the press in England has been especially harsh. "The 
journalists here are like terrorists," he said. "I'm not like that. I don't 
take a cheap holiday in other people's misery." 
</P>
<P>
George acknowledged that the drug convictions hurt him. "I think maybe the fact 
that I was so high-profile and my addiction was such a public fiasco is one of 
the reasons," he said. "But there are many people who have had drug problems. I 
still hear Doors records being played on white radio, so I think it's a little 
bit hypocritical to single me out. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's just general prejudices," he said. "There were a lot of people 
who didn't like me in the beginning and the drug thing has given them an 
excuse." 
</P>
<P>
George also agreed that he was overexposed. "It's very easy for that to 
happen," he said. "Nobody ever questions success. Obviously what I did in the 
past was very stylized. You can only eat so much of something." 
</P>
<P>
If he had it to do over again, George would be more mindful of overexposure. "I 
think the best pop careers are built on illusion -- the idea that if you can't 
have something, you want it more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
How about the gay image? 
</P>
<P>
"I think it really depends on who the person is whether he feels affronted by 
it or comfortable with it," he said. "I've always said if you can't deal with 
it, that's your problem. Obviously, a lot of artists throughout history have 
been very dishonest, and are they happy? 
</P>
<P>
"My sexuality would be the same whether I was Boy George or Bob Smith. I've 
always been very up-front about that, and I think it did a lot of good. I still 
get letters from kids who say, 'You changed my life.' " 
</P>
<P>
What are the chances that George can make a full-scale comeback? 
</P>
<P>
"Less than fair," said Kahane. "I think he has about a 25% chance of being 
received again at pop radio. It's sad because the guy is really talented. He 
was the flavor of the month, but I thought his songs were so strong that he 
could transcend the image. I know that George (Michael) thinks he's amazingly 
talented. I think everyone feels a little sorry for him because he had such a 
bright career and then he kind of flushed it down the toilet." 
</P>
<P>
In the interview, George seemed at peace with himself, not desperate to claw 
his way back to the top. "I believe that everything happens when it should," he 
said. "I believe in my karma and I believe if I deserve it I'll get it and if I 
don't, I won't." 
</P>
<P>
George said he is trying to keep his sense of humor about his fall from 
superstar to cult figure. "There's something beautiful about being a sort of 
folk hero," he said. "I don't have record sales but I have peace of mind." 
</P>
<P>
George is reapplying for his visa, which would allow him to enter the U.S. "I 
think if I could come to America I could make a bigger wave," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Being in England, I can't feel the response from America. I'm like a stand-up 
comedian: I have to work on emotions and response. And here in England, the 
record was completely ignored. If you blinked you missed it. Here they don't 
seem to be into me at all. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the time, people forget that what I went through was a personal thing 
as well as a public thing," he added. "It would be nice if they remembered 
that. I've come through all that stuff, and I think I'm a better person now. I 
can do a lot more good by exposing the fact that I've overcome those problems 
rather than sort of being pushed aside. People can learn something from my 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a politician. I'm not trying to get votes, I'm just saying, 'Look, 
this is the record and I'd really be happy if you played it.' I've had a tough 
two years but I've tried very hard to get over it and I am getting over it and 
I think other people should give me some courtesy for that. I'm not asking for 
a medal, but I am asking for a chance."

A DAY ON THE SHOW-BIZ BEAT WITH 'ET'; 
</P>
<P>
BEHIND THE CAMERAS OF 'ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT' AS IT COMES UP ON SHOW 2,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
"Entertainment Tonight" will air its 2,000th show on Friday. Although thumped 
by critics since it debuted on Sept. 14, 1981, the syndicated program has 
survived. Entertainment reporters are now as common on TV as weather reporters, 
in part because of "ET," which has remained television's leading news show 
devoted solely to the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Last September, at the start of its eighth season, "ET" introduced a new 
format, with glitzier graphics, strobe-light pacing and two new features -- its 
opening Inside Story and the ET Insider, a gossip-column-style commentary by 
co-star John Tesh. 
</P>
<P>
 While some observers say "ET" is as lightweight as ever, insiders contend that 
the format change has given the show a "harder edge" and credit it with pumping 
new life into the enterprise. As evidence, Paramount points to a 25% rise since 
November in the number of stations airing "ET" in the coveted hour before prime 
time -- to 53 stations in the top 100 markets (it is carried by a total of 165 
stations). Critics may not like "ET," but, if ratings are to be believed, 10 
million people who watch television do. 
</P>
<P>
 Following is a behind-the-scenes look at how a typical day's show -- in this 
case, No. 1,984, the April 20 edition -- is put together. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a few yawns past 5 o'clock in the morning. The sun hasn't risen yet on 
the Paramount lot's huge blue-sky backdrop, but in the Mae West Building, Jim 
Van Messel is already presiding at his second meeting of the day. 
</P>
<P>
As the "ET" machine shudders to life in the pre-dawn hours of April 20, 1989, 
all eyes are on the videocassette recorder in the office of Van Messel, the 
program's senior producer. The start of a typical day. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The shape of any day at "ET" is determined by the fact that the show must be 
ready shortly after noon to be fed to the outside world by satellite. The daily 
12:30 p.m. deadline is a time bomb beneath the feet of the show's 125 staffers 
as they work throughout the morning. "We are mice on a treadmill," Van Messel 
says as he reviews the story lineup for Show No. 1,984 with members of the "ET" 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
The basic elements of the show were determined at an early afternoon meeting 
the day before. Now the lineup must be firmed up, the taped stories given final 
form, a script fashioned for co-stars John Tesh and Mary Hart. 
</P>
<P>
One of Van Messel's first decisions this morning is to kill a tentatively 
scheduled story. It is an interview with the girl who always had her back to 
the camera as Patty Duke's identical cousin on Duke's 1960s ABC show. "ET" had 
expected to see the woman who actually doubled for Duke. Instead, the piece, 
done for "Nick at Night" on the Nickelodeon cable channel, is an unfunny spoof. 
</P>
<P>
Van Messel moves through the lineup story by story. Today's opener -- Inside 
Story -- is on Steven Stayner, kidnaped in 1972 at age 7 and sexually molested 
over the next seven years. Stayner, who eventually escaped his captor, is the 
subject of a May miniseries on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
The Stayner piece, which includes clips from the miniseries, interviews with 
stars and a few words with the real Stayner on location, runs just over three 
minutes -- an epic by "ET" standards, where most stories run 90 seconds, tops. 
A dozen staff members have been working on the piece for almost a week. Now, 
only a few hours before air time, Van Messel decides an exchange between 
Stayner and the actor who plays him doesn't make sense. "You have to think too 
hard," Van Messel says of the present version. 
</P>
<P>
Changes are ordered in other stories. Van Messel wants a reference to actress 
Geena Davis changed in a piece on Jeff Goldblum. In the current version, Davis, 
Goldblum's co-star in "Earth Girls Are Easy," is described as his off-screen 
partner. "He's married to Geena Davis, isn't he? Partner implies (the living 
arrangement of) Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn." 
</P>
<P>
Today's show will also include a breaking story, of sorts. Early every morning, 
"ET" staff members study the entertainment stories sent out by the wire 
services and read the industry news in a stack of papers, including the Los 
Angeles Times, the Herald Examiner, the New York Times, Daily Variety and the 
Hollywood Reporter. Van Messel and others also look over the East Coast gossip 
columns faxed out by "ET's" New York office. 
</P>
<P>
This morning, a morality-in-media item in the New York Post has caught Van 
Messel's eye. The news staff is already checking it out. In the next few hours, 
"ET" will whip together a segment on the close scrutiny that fundamentalist 
Donald Wildmon plans to give "The Wonder Years" and other popular TV shows for 
evidence of sex, violence and anti-Christian stereotyping. 
</P>
<P>
All day long, information flows into "ET" through its four segment producers -- 
one each for movies, TV, music and publishing, the last based in New York. The 
segment producers are the ones who keep in touch with the publicists who 
control access to most celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever others may think of "ET," the people who work here view it as a news 
show. "We're news guys," Van Messel says of himself and David Nuell, executive 
producer of the show. Most mornings, Nuell is beside Van Messel during the 
meetings with "ET" director Ron de Moraes, supervising producer Barry Berk, 
segment producers, writers, directors of varying rank and dozens of people with 
the word producer somewhere in their job titles. But on April 20, Nuell is 
vacationing in France. 
</P>
<P>
Nuell and Van Messel, who have headed "ET" for 2 1/2 years, have worked 
together for 15 years, most recently as station manager and news director, 
respectively, at WRC-TV in Washington, D.C. During their tenure, WRC broke some 
big stories, including the asbestos danger posed by hair dryers. Nuell and Van 
Messel are a team, with complementary interests and gifts. Nuell, who is "ET's" 
CEO, is large and voluble and likes to schmooze. Van Messel is small and 
intense and focuses on efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Nuell nor Van Messel claims "ET" is "60 Minutes." "This isn't 
investigative journalism," Van Messel says ("It isn't?" Tesh, who overhears, 
says in mock disbelief). But both producers insist "ET" is newsier than it has 
been in the recent past. Both speak of "ET's" harder edge. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt people wanted to have meat," Van Messel says. "We'll start with 
something hard and then come right back with something soft and cuddly." 
Today's meat includes, besides the Stayner story, a piece on how talk-radio 
hosts are urging their listeners to boycott Exxon. Today's cuddliest story -- 
adorable to a fault -- is a 35-second segment in which Corbin Bernsen of "L.A. 
Law" hugs dogs that can be adopted. 
</P>
<P>
With an estimated $500,000 to spend weekly, "ET" has the resources to chase the 
stories it wants. It recently worked the phones on three continents to nail 
down a genuine scoop: evidence that a 3-year-old Yugoslav orphan, hired as an 
actor, was mistreated during the shooting of a concentration-camp scene for the 
ABC miniseries "War and Remembrance." (Producer-director Dan Curtis denied the 
allegation.) 
</P>
<P>
The management will woo a big star for an interview for a year or more, but it 
won't pay for one. Van Messel acknowledges that celebrities are willing to talk 
to "ET" because they know they won't be embarrassed on camera. "People realize 
they are not going to get hurt," he says. 
</P>
<P>
But before Don Johnson would give "ET" an interview on the set of the movie 
"Sweet Hearts Dance," he asked for a written agreement that the interviewer 
would not ask him about ex-girlfriend Barbra Streisand, drugs or "Miami Vice." 
"ET" decided it could get by with what it already had on Johnson in its vast 
tape vault. "Don Johnson could not command that kind of leverage," Nuell told 
Tristar Pictures, producer and distributor of the film. Today's ET Insider 
contains a joke mentioning "Don Johnson's ego." 
</P>
<P>
Many "ET" staff members have had far grittier news experience than the show's 
content sometimes suggests. Bob Flick, the grizzled, Hemingwayesque man who is 
writing gags about Geraldo Rivera for today's show, was head of the NBC news 
crew ambushed near Jonestown. "I did El Salvador next, and then I decided I 
couldn't do it anymore. I didn't have the nerve." Flick has no apparent regrets 
about leaving network news. "I don't think there is any hard news anymore." 
</P>
<P>
"We succeed when we accomplish a visceral response in the viewer," says Nuell, 
who makes no apologies for the show's sometimes odd blend of show biz and news. 
"ET" is put together with the understanding that it must grab the viewer, often 
a woman between the ages of 18 and 49, who has a remote control at the ready. 
As Van Messel explains, "ET" doesn't have "appointment viewers" -- people who 
set aside time to watch the show. "ET's" potential viewer is spinning the dial, 
trolling the airwaves. Hot graphics help "ET" mesmerize the dial-turner, and so 
does "the inside concept." 
</P>
<P>
" 'ET,' " Nuell explains, "was the first show that consistently took people 
inside show business." The management does not believe, however, that viewers 
want to go so far inside that they have to hear about daily fluctuations in 
ratings and other news the industry dotes on. The show attempts to stay 
"viewer-friendly," which is to say of interest to a viewer who is not an 
entertainment insider, not a media historian and not necessarily a New Yorker 
or an Angeleno. 
</P>
<P>
"When I think of the viewer, I think of myself the day I got here," Van Messel 
says. "I don't know every movie that was ever done. I have this book of Leonard 
Maltin's to tell me." 
</P>

The Talent doesn't have to get up at 4 o'clock in the morning. The Talent can 
sleep till 7. Typically, Mary Hart and John Tesh arrive at Paramount between 8 
and 8:30 to do voice-overs and promos for upcoming shows. 
</P>
<P>
On April 20, Hart,who has been the show's star since 1982 and is said to be 
asking for $1 million to renew her contract, comes to work in aerobics shoes, 
white athletic socks and black-and-yellow exercise clothes. Her hair is pulled 
onto the top of her head and fastened with a butterfly clip. The former Miss 
South Dakota wears no makeup. She is still beautiful, but in a fuzzy, 
ill-defined way. 
</P>
<P>
At 10 a.m., the Talent, still in civvies, sit down in the conference room with 
Van Messel, the director, the script supervisor and a production assistant to 
read through today's script. Script supervisor Shirley Alberti uses a stop 
watch to time each of Hart's and Tesh's "ins and outs," the lines delivered 
before and after stories. 
</P>
<P>
While it is hard to imagine Hart pitching "Silas Marner" to bored teen-agers, 
the fact is she taught high-school English for three years, and she reads the 
script with both an actor's ear for what works aloud and a schoolmarm's eye for 
the subject that doesn't agree with its verb. Van Messel and the others mark up 
the scripts in front of them as Hart untangles the syntax of one of her lines. 
</P>
<P>
Across the conference table, Teshie, as he is frequently called by female 
staffers, makes sarcastic, albeit resonant, comments. On the surface, Hart and 
Tesh look like minor variations on the theme vanilla. But Tesh, who has been on 
the show for three years, insists he has a darker side, "a really black sense 
of humor." 
</P>
<P>
Tesh says he likes "ET" because "this show never pretends to be more than it 
is." He doesn't know most of the celebrities he reports on, he says, and he 
maintains a certain ironic detachment from the industry. "I'm very cynical 
about this business. It's fun to make fun of this stuff." He has always been 
irreverent, Tesh says. "There was a lot of detention for this kid." 
</P>
<P>
Hart moves in celebrity circles, and there are stars, including Frank Sinatra, 
who give her exclusive interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Tesh, a Grammy-winning composer and keyboardist, has his own following. 
"Sting," Nuell says, "only wants to be interviewed by Tesh." Music is Tesh's 
passion. Tesh is ebullient today because singer Michael McDonald is going to 
drop by Tesh's studio after "ET" to do a vocal for an album. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hart and Tesh share most on-camera duties, Tesh has one small venue of 
his own: the ET Insider. "Mary was so established we wanted to have something 
for John that he would be associated with," Van Messel says. 
</P>
<P>
Tesh has no problems with today's Insider script, but he requests and gets a 
change in his lines following the Stayner piece. Tesh thinks it is 
inappropriate to editorialize about the kidnaper's prison term. "We're 
convicting him twice," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
At 11:30 a.m., Hart and Tesh are on Stage 28, ready to take their places behind 
the smoked Plexiglas desk on the "ET" set. The desk hides the fact that, at 6 
foot 6, Tesh is a foot taller than his co-star. In suit and tie, Tesh looks 
much as he did during the read-through. But dressed up, made-up and coiffed, 
Hart is transformed. She gleams. Her red-leather suit is simultaneously 
ladylike and sexy. Instead of aerobics shoes, she wears bad-girl shoes with 
three-inch heels. 
</P>
<P>
At the stage manager's signal, Hart smiles and Tesh begins: "The real-life 
ordeal of a kidnaped child held captive for seven years comes out of the 
shadows and into prime time. The Inside Story on 'Entertainment Tonight' . . . 
April 20th . . . 1989."

AN EXHIBITION IN SEARCH OF THE 'REAL' REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH VENANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Real is a tricky term," says the Museum of Contemporary Art's chief curator, 
Mary Jane Jacob, contemplating the work represented in "A Forest of Signs: Art 
in the Crisis of Representation." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, at the Temporary Contemporary, focuses on the multiplicity of 
signs that represent the modern world and the contemporary artist's attempt to 
reveal how they function. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty artists, whose work is variously examined over the past 12 years, 
investigate such issues as the impact of mass culture on individual identity, 
the role of originality in producing meaning in a work of art and the artist as 
a self-conscious producer of commodities. 
</P>
<P>
"The question in all of this is where is the real reality," says Jacob, who 
organized the show with assistant curator Ann Goldstein. 
</P>
<P>
In a society enveloped by media images, meaning is an unstable commodity. 
"Context defines meaning," says Jacob. 
</P>
<P>
Placing a pre-existing image in a new context creates new meaning. The 
technique, "the appropriation of images" -- is one of the art world's most 
fashionable terminologies, and one invited by the show. 
</P>
<P>
What is appropriated can be anything already in existence that an artist makes 
his or her own. A stuffed teddy bear becomes a large-scale porcelain sculpture, 
a photograph is rephotographed and presented as a separate artwork. 
</P>
<P>
In Dara Birnbaum's "PM Magazine," which examines TV's representation of women 
by reprocessing film footage of the show, "appropriation was crucial," 
Goldstein points out. "Before VCRs, the only way to gain access to TV shows was 
to actually get someone at the studio to lend you a tape." 
</P>
<P>
 In physically acquiring the film, says Jacob, "Birnbaum was playing out a 
recapturing of power from the corporate media system to bring that power back 
into the hands of a woman." 
</P>
<P>
When Birnbaum takes the film images out of the context in which they were 
constructed, dissolving, then reconstructing them as an artwork, she courts 
another popular art-world term, "deconstruction." Applied to literature, 
deconstruction questions the ability of language to represent reality. 
</P>
<P>
But both curators shy away from it in art. 
</P>
<P>
"The term gets thrown at the work, but I don't think it describes it," says 
Jacob. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a vague term," adds Goldstein, who is willing to define it only loosely 
as "art that's been manipulated," and "the aftermath of appropriation." 
</P>
<P>
"You get lost in rhetoric," warns Jacob. "Our point of view is the artist's, 
not the critic's." 
</P>
<P>
Labels aside, artists have portrayed meaning through images for centuries, only 
now the images have proliferated and changed. "The Renaissance man never knew 
the Madonna from seeing her," says Jacob. "But when he saw the image of the 
Madonna, it meant something about his or her life with the church. 
</P>
<P>
"What are the images that have meaning in our lives today? Cigarette ads, 
television programs, movie personalities, products. We don't live up to being 
the Madonna anymore; we live up to looking like the woman in the makeup ad." 
</P>
<P>
For a TV-bred generation, media images are powerful and real. Says Jacob: "Do 
we really know Michael Jackson or do we know images of Michael Jackson? The 
artists are saying, I think, that the media images are the real Michael 
Jackson, not Michael Jackson himself." 
</P>
<P>
Neither curator will attempt to speak for the artists, however, nor to define a 
theme for the show. 
</P>
<P>
"The expectation is that museums present something that is definitive, where 
we've worked out all the answers. These artists are telling us that life is no 
longer simple and linear. It might seem hard to grasp or unfamiliar at the 
moment, but we aimed to deal with ideas that are still in formation." 
</P>
<P>
Though most of the artists have achieved considerable fame within recent years, 
few, if any, were known in the late '70s, the period with which the exhibit 
begins. "They weren't the ones receiving the headlines at the time Julian 
Schnabel or David Salle were stealing the show," says Jacob. 
</P>
<P>
"We were concerned about work that might have been excluded because it wasn't 
fashionable. It's a revisionist attitude of looking at art that had a 
conceptual art base but had been pushed under the rug while painting and 
Neo-Expressionism were being discussed." 
</P>
<P>
Not everybody agrees with the method of art-making that can easily blur the 
boundaries between the commercial and the aesthetic. In a catalogue essay, 
Jacob quotes New York magazine critic Kay Larsen, who questions, "How valid is 
any critique of capitalism that aims at total success within the system?" 
</P>
<P>
Which raises the question: How will the man on the street respond to the art? 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone is going to find things they can relate to, because they're images that 
are very close to our day-to-day existence," says Jacob. 
</P>
<P>
And that includes the man and woman who may never have heard of deconstruction, 
not to mention understanding it.

A MARTIAL ARTIST MARSHALS CAREER; 
</P>
<P>
MARK SALZMAN'S STAR RISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The day that communications failed 100 miles southwest of Shanghai, Mark 
Salzman broke his hand. 
</P>
<P>
It happened early during 13 weeks of filming in a resort city in Hangzhou when 
Salzman -- who wrote the critically acclaimed book "Iron and Silk" and stars in 
the upcoming movie of the same name -- was supposed to demolish a brick wall 
with one well-placed karate chop. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese film crew had been told to weaken the concrete-coated wall. But as 
the camera rolled, the first-time actor and martial-arts expert stepped up to 
the wall, threw a right hook and turned his hand into ground round. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't weaken it enough," Salzman says today with a twisted grin. "We 
were only three weeks into filming and I had to shoot the rest of the movie 
with a broken hand." 
</P>
<P>
Salzman also had to settle for bandaging his injured hand between scenes, since 
a cast would have marred the breathtaking wushu -- traditional Chinese martial 
arts routines -- showcased in "Iron and Silk." 
</P>
<P>
Today, with the movie itself wrapped and scheduled for fall release, his hand 
healed and a multimedia package tucked firmly under his black belt, Salzman has 
lots to grin about. 
</P>
<P>
He has gone from an unemployed Yale graduate with a dubiously marketable degree 
in classical Chinese literature to a mini-cottage industry that is churning out 
travel literature, novels and screenplays. He's had a photo and blurb in Time 
magazine's People section, and there's a possible starring role in a TV 
adventure series, in addition to a Dewar's Scotch profile scheduled later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for a 29-year-old guy who hates to travel, is lukewarm about 
contemporary China and says his favorite movie is "ROBOCOP." 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say I have particularly artsy tastes, and I'm not a China watcher," 
Salzman said. "The thing I dread most is being invited to a dinner party where 
everybody's talking about China." 
</P>
<P>
In the film version of "Iron and Silk," Salzman plays himself, an American 
preppie who spends 1982 to 1984 teaching English at Hunan Medical College and 
learning martial arts from a colorful character and former national champion 
nicknamed "The Iron Fist." 
</P>
<P>
In between, he jousts with the swinish Chinese bureaucracy in Changsha, the 
capital city of Hunan Province; elicits poignant tales from his students, and 
has a yearning friendship with a beautiful young Chinese woman doctor. 
</P>
<P>
"All I had to do was pretend to be myself a few years ago," says Salzman, who 
learned to speak Mandarin and Cantonese. "If I could feel natural in front of 
the camera and relive my experiences honestly, I was happy." 
</P>
<P>
Salzman co-wrote the screenplay with Shirley Sun, the movie's director. 
Shanghai-born and U.S.-reared, Sun earned a doctorate in art history and 
studied film making at Stanford University. She was Bernardo Bertolucci's 
consultant for "The Last Emperor" and co-wrote and produced "A Great Wall," a 
tongue-in-cheek Chinese "Roots." 
</P>
<P>
Sun, who has often filmed in China and was the first American movie maker 
invited there in 1979 when Washington normalized relations with Beijing, had no 
problem getting permission to return for "Iron and Silk." Both she and Salzman 
hope the movie -- one of only a handful shot by Americans since then -- will 
whet curiosity about modern China and traditional wushu, which resembles 
Mikhail Baryshnikov more than Bruce Lee. 
</P>
<P>
Salzman, whose devotion to wushu borders on obsession, says the martial-arts 
routines in "Iron and Silk" stress grace and poise without the violent revenge 
themes typical of kung-fu movies. Wushu routines are more dancelike and 
elaborate than the austere, clean lines of Japanese martial arts showcased in 
movies such as "Above the Law." Still, Salzman &amp; Co. wield some pretty 
scary instruments in the movie, including 4-foot sabers, halberds and a 
nine-section chain whip with a dart at the end. 
</P>
<P>
The film's budget, which Sun pegs at under $5 million, was minuscule by 
Hollywood standards. ("The Last Emperor" cost $26 million, by contrast.) 
</P>
<P>
Because she wanted him to act naturally, Sun wouldn't let Salzman see the 
dailies, he recalls. But some real-life things happened right on cue. When they 
arrived in China to cast roles, Salzman's memorable wushu teacher Pan Qingfu 
walked into their office and asked to play himself, the "Iron Fist" whose 
nickname comes from hitting his hand 1,000 times a day against an iron plate. 
</P>
<P>
Serendipity had brought him to Hangzhou to judge a wushu championship, and 
after seeing what a character he was, Sun signed him on. 
</P>
<P>
"He was so excited, he wanted to do every martial-arts act known to Earth," 
Salzman says. 
</P>
<P>
They got Vivian Wu, the Chinese actress who played wife No. 2 in "The Last 
Emperor," to play the beautiful doctor with whom Salzman has a wistful 
friendship. 
</P>
<P>
Filming "Iron and Silk" turned out to be a battle with the incredible and 
constant noise generated by a country of 1 billion people. 
</P>
<P>
As Salzman and Pan started shooting a martial-arts scene that took all day to 
set up, an awful screeching erupted outside where peasants were trussing up 
pigs, throwing them in wheelbarrows and wheeling them off to slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated pleas, the peasants refused to hold off, informing the film 
crew that their work was just as important as that of the film. 
</P>
<P>
The film crew had to wait. 
</P>
<P>
And cultural confusion reigned when Salzman's fiancee, Jessica Yu, a 
fourth-generation Chinese-American who speaks no Chinese, visited him on the 
set. The Chinese made a beeline for Yu and addressed her in Chinese while 
ignoring him. Ironically, he would then have to translate. 
</P>
<P>
Sun says she will finish editing by June and screen the movie this fall at the 
New York International Film Festival and Telluride -- where "A Great Wall" 
premiered three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Salzman isn't sitting on his sword. He recently moved from San 
Francisco to Glendale with his fiancee and is three-quarters of the way through 
a novel for Random House -- which signed him to a two-book contract after the 
success of his first book. 
</P>
<P>
For someone who rode the Orient Express to fame, Salzman has a paradoxical 
love/hate attitude toward China, an enchantment with classical Chinese arts and 
a disillusionment with the country's modern shortcomings. He wrestles with the 
tensions between those two worlds in the book, the movie and in everyday 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
And he still practices wushu three hours a day in parking lots, basketball 
courts and his back yard. Self-defense runs in the family: Yu was ninth-ranked 
in the trial competition for the Seoul Olympics last year. 
</P>
<P>
Standing in his driveway, Salzman demonstrates a routine that involves deft 
parries with a 6-foot, wood-handled spear topped with a flowing red tassel and 
announces gleefully that "my neighbors must think I'm crazy." 
</P>
<P>
But advertisers and TV executives apparently don't. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got star quality," says Andrew Susskind, president of television at 
Weintraub Entertainment Group Television, which has developed two pilots in 
which Salzman would battle world evil with martial arts. Weintraub says he's 
now shopping the series around to the networks. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, celebrity art photographer Herb Ritts photographed Salzman for the 
Gap's new print ad campaign, in which accomplished young adults strike hipster 
poses. 
</P>
<P>
Salzman's infatuation with China began at 13, when he saw his first episode of 
the TV show, "Kung Fu." Calligraphy and martial-arts lessons followed, and 
Salzman worked at Chinese restaurants in his teens to learn Mandarin and 
Cantonese. 
</P>
<P>
Salzman, who grew up in a small middle-class neighborhood outside New Haven, 
Conn., never finished high school, but was accepted into Yale as a cello 
prodigy. There, he switched to Chinese language and literature and graduated 
Phi Beta Kappa and summa cum laude in 1982. At loose ends, he then took a 
two-year teaching job in China. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, however, Salzman was the prototypical "Accidental Tourist." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a good traveler, I hate traveling. God, it was miserable, I was so 
homesick," recalls Salzman, who crossed off the 712 days on his calendar one at 
a time and studied wushu to stave off boredom. 
</P>
<P>
Contemporary China proved a rude shock. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was going to read poetry and sit on a boat and do calligraphy and 
that's ridiculous. China is a dirty, modern, industrial country in the throes 
of an incredible upheaval," he says. 
</P>
<P>
When he returned stateside, Salzman had no intentions of writing a book. 
Instead, he wrote a screenplay that he admits now was awful. But it led to a 
short story about his martial-arts teacher Pan Qingfu, which Salzman showed to 
a friend, who sent it to another friend at Random House in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"The writing was magical. Mark's a natural-born storyteller," says Becky 
Saletan, who became Salzman's editor at Random House. 
</P>
<P>
"Iron and Silk" was the first book she acquired, and Saletan says today that 
the whole process was "a real Cinderella story, a first-time book by an unknown 
writer that everybody loved but nobody expected to take off commercially the 
way it did." 
</P>
<P>
Salzman's approach to China was simple, if not unique for the time. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people like to write about China and how different it is. I was surprised 
at how similar it was," he says. 
</P>
<P>
For now, though, Salzman is firmly grounded in Los Angeles where he meets with 
TV executives, worries about his movie performance and toils at his novel, 
which he calls a sort of Holy Grail, coming-of-age epic about a young Chinese 
orphan in America forced to reconcile old loyalties with his new life with the 
help of a mythical character called the Monkey King. 
</P>
<P>
Salzman, for his part, also must reconcile his old life with the potential of 
his new one. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep reminding myself that this could all fizzle at any time. And I don't 
want to be turning 50 and doing the flaming-sword routine in Las Vegas and be 
known as the Liberace of martial arts," he says with his trademark grin.

THE PAINFUL IRONY OF MELLENCAMP; 
</P>
<P>
ROCK'S CHAMPION OF SMALL-TOWN VALUES TURNS ON HIMSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is unusual for a recording artist to begin an interview by mentioning 
someone else's music, especially when he's got his own new album to promote. 
But this is an unusual time for John Cougar Mellencamp. 
</P>
<P>
"I just made a record with a kid named James McMurtry," the 37-year-old rock 
singer said even before the first question was asked in a Beverly Hills hotel. 
McMurtry is the son of novelist Larry McMurtry, a long-time friend of 
Mellencamp. 
</P>
<P>
"And you've got to understand that the last thing I want to do is go into the 
studio and work on someone else's record. But this kid is such a wonderful 
writer. He's just 25, but he writes like he's 50 . . . like he's seen so much." 
</P>
<P>
Without prompting, Mellencamp (who co-produced the McMurtry album, due this 
summer) described one of the young writer's songs. 
</P>
<P>
"You heard my new record? Well, there's a song on James' album -- 'Song for a 
Deckhand's Daughter' -- that makes 'Jackie Brown' sound like a joke," he said, 
dismissing a cut on his own LP. "It's so touching. It's about a woman who loves 
someone regardless of what a (jerk) he is. 
</P>
<P>
"In the song, this guy is out mowing the grass one summer and he just heads 
down the road. The song goes, 'Came back at Christmas, never said where he had 
been, just presents for the children, just stories for the men.' " 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, Mellencamp -- still raving about McMurtry -- was 
interrupted by a knock at the door. An assistant handed Mellencamp a package 
filled with photographs of his own paintings. He thumbed through them as he 
returned to his chair. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's how I've been spending my time recently: painting," the singer said 
enthusiastically, holding up a favorite photo. "It is so satisfying. My mom 
used to paint when I was a kid, but she used to take forever to finish a 
painting because she also had to raise us kids. 
</P>
<P>
"But I found it's just like songwriting. . . . Sometimes it takes weeks to 
write a song, then other times it just pours out. I've done 80 paintings since 
August." 
</P>
<P>
If you get the feeling Mellencamp's mind isn't solely on his own music these 
days, you're right. 
</P>
<P>
He's at the peak of his career in terms of critical and commercial success -- 
his last four albums have sold an estimated 14 million copies worldwide. But 
Mellencamp appears disenchanted with much of the rock world. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, it's the old story of chasing success for years, only to find 
that the money and fame don't bring you happiness. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Mellencamp's mood may be burnout. He's one of rock's most celebrated 
performers, but he doesn't like touring, and those nearly 150 concerts last 
year took their toll. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Mellencamp is also unusually introspective, and his malaise apparently goes 
deeper than the usual complaints about the hectic pace on the pop 
merry-go-round. 
</P>
<P>
After championing traditional values and small-town life in his recent albums, 
Mellencamp finds himself, uncomfortably, battling aspects of his own behavior 
-- tendencies such as selfishness and infidelity that are aggravated by all the 
hero worship surrounding rock stars. 
</P>
<P>
In the angry, self-mocking "Big Daddy," the title track of his new album, you 
can feel Mellencamp wrestling with his own emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 You used to chase your women right into your home 
</P>
<P>
 You used to tell them you love them over the telephone 
</P>
<P>
 Now they all see through you and you're sinking like a stone. 
</P>
<P>
 No one's knocking at your door 
</P>
<P>
 No one calls 
</P>
<P>
 How does it feel to be the big daddy of them all? 
</P>
<P>
 About the song, Mellencamp said: "Being a big daddy doesn't mean you have to 
be rich and famous. There's a little bit of big daddy in everybody, whether 
you're the head of the kitchen at the restaurant or the head of a big record 
company. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first started writing that song, I thought I was writing about that 
part of everyone, but I eventually realized I was writing the song about myself 
because if you're a rock star, it's real easy to take advantage of people by 
being a big daddy 24 hours a day." 
</P>
<P>
If there is any anger in the lines of "Big Daddy," there is a sadness in "Void 
in My Heart" that mirrors equally Mellencamp's state these days: 
</P>
<P>
 Been a parent, had three children 
</P>
<P>
 And a big house on the hill 
</P>
<P>
 Hundred dollars in my pocket 
</P>
<P>
 And it didn't buy a thing 
</P>
<P>
 Now there's a void in my heart 
</P>
<P>
 And a hole in my dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Mellencamp still lives in Bloomington, Ind., 45 miles from where he was born 
in Seymour. He sees his second wife, Vicky, and their three daughters almost 
every day, he said, even though they have been separated for nearly two years. 
He lives alone behind the imposing walls of a two-story home on the edge of 
town. 
</P>
<P>
The rock star's separation was recently splashed all over the pages of the 
National Enquirer, which suggested that he was a womanizer. He frowned when the 
story was mentioned, but he acknowledged he has to work on certain areas of his 
character. 
</P>
<P>
"There is still somewhere in the back of my mind that little boy out behind the 
barn smoking a cigarette trying to get away with something," Mellencamp said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to deal with that or I'm going to end up . . . like the song says. . 
. . Being the big daddy of them all, . . . being 70 years old and just 
floating, . . . not being committed to anything or anybody except yourself, and 
that scares me." 
</P>
<P>
It's ironic that Mellencamp is down on himself at a time when he has convinced 
once-doubting critics that he deserves a leadership role in rock. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when "arrogant," "obnoxious" and "derivative" were the words 
most frequently applied to him by critics and other industry observers. Even 
after he broke into the Top 10 in 1981 with such hits as "Jack and Diane" and 
"Hurt So Good," Mellencamp was frequently branded shallow and contrived. 
</P>
<P>
The critical breakthrough for Mellencamp began in 1983 with "Pink Houses," an 
ironic, bittersweet look at the state of the American Dream. His "Scarecrow" 
album in 1985 also signaled an increased maturity. Despite some minor moments, 
the album touched on a warmer, personal, socially-conscious tone. 
</P>
<P>
Mellencamp gained more new admirers with 1987's "The Lonesome Jubilee," an 
album that had an even more original "heartland rock" tone. Along with such 
other veteran artists as Bruce Springsteen, Don Henley and Bob Seger, he seemed 
to be addressing an older rock audience: his contemporaries. 
</P>
<P>
"Lonesome Jubilee," he said at the time, was about a generation whose dreams 
haven't come true, but that shouldn't mean the end of those dreams. "We can 
waste our time by saying, 'Damn it, I should have done this or I should have 
done that,' but it's all a shallow exercise unless you do more," he said. "To 
me, rock 'n' roll was always about tonight. . . . Have a good time. But it was 
also about tomorrow, . . . the idea of doing something with your life." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of reflecting on the world around him, Mellencamp seems to be looking 
inward on the "Big Daddy" album. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to listen to a song like 'Big Daddy,' " Mellencamp said. "When I 
first played the song to a couple of guys in the band, they just kind of went, 
'Do you really want to make this record?' They knew exactly whom I was talking 
about." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than go on tour in support of his new album, Mellencamp is going to 
spend time working on his painting and thinking about his future. He's planning 
to drive around the country, taking photographs for future paintings. That's a 
dramatic move in an industry where touring is considered a key to selling an 
album. 
</P>
<P>
"I really understand what John Lennon meant when he said 'I'm not in this race 
anymore,' " Mellencamp said. "Ten years ago, they were words, but I relate to 
them now. It's how I feel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not important for me to be in this magazine or that magazine. The 
important thing is getting my life together and that's what I'm concentrating 
on. I followed the rock 'n' roll dream for a long time and it has given me a 
lot of rewards, but it also distracted me from the things I need to work on . . 
. in my own life. I think it's time now to start paying attention to them."

AVANT-GARDE ARTISTS TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEW CRITICALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINE McKENNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Forest of Signs: Art in the Crisis of Representation," marks the official 
unveiling of what the avant-garde's been up to for the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
A crash course in a movement that's been dubbed the New Criticality, "Forest of 
Signs" gives Los Angeles its first comprehensive look at a generation of 
artists fed on the philosophy of Andy Warhol, the advertising industry and the 
flickering box that converts reality into a series of easily digestible images, 
the TV set. 
</P>
<P>
The show at MOCA, surveying work by 30 young American artists from Los Angeles 
and New York, takes its title from a poem by Charles Baudelaire, and many of 
the ideas it explores are French imports as well. French writers Jacques 
Derrida, Jean Baudrillard, Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes and Paul Verdier -- 
all of whom serve up a provocative blend of history, art theory, Structuralism, 
Semiotics, sociology and psychology -- developed many of the ideas at the heart 
of this exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
With strong links to Pop art and '70s Conceptualism, "Forest of Signs" explores 
a wide range of ideas including linguistics and the manner in which signs and 
symbols resonate in the collective unconscious, the uses and abuses of new 
technologies, and the ownership and pirating of images. 
</P>
<P>
This work calls into question the importance of originality and sincerity 
(criteria by which society has traditionally evaluated the value of a work of 
art). It also reevaluates the romantic archetype of the artist and explores the 
power structure of the art world -- which basically boils down to survival of 
the fittest -- as a metaphor for life. Modern culture's relentless drive to 
commodify anything and everything (including artworks -- popularly regarded as 
something pure and wholly separate from the dirty world of money) comes under 
attack repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
Inviting a detached, analytical response rather than an emotional one, this 
exhibit has a veneer of sophisticated cynicism, but in fact, this is intensely 
political art; repression in all its forms -- sexism, racism, corporate fascism 
-- is a central concern. These are but a few of the ideas this ambitious show 
attempts to address, and as can be seen in the comments of nine participants, 
"Forest of Signs" does not represent a unified front. There is plenty of 
healthy disagreement within the ranks of the New Criticality. 
</P>
<P>
MITCHELL SYROP: Frankly, I have my doubts about this show. "Art in the Crisis 
of Representation"? I'd like to know what the crisis is -- I don't think I'm 
having a crisis. If appropriation is what the crisis is about, it doesn't 
figure prominently in my work and never has. Appropriationism highlights a 
practice that's gone on forever, and the controversy around this show is that 
there is no controversy. 
</P>
<P>
I also don't think there's a clear school here, and though Semiotics is being 
cited as a common thread, I think it's being blown out of proportion -- but 
then, isn't that a curator's job? To blow things out of proportion, to take one 
common point and create a fiction around it? 
</P>
<P>
My work is about the ambiguity of language, and my sources are much more 
eclectic than this show suggests. The things I read, the people I talk to -- 
none of it has a hell of a lot to do with "Forest of Signs," and given a 
choice, I'd rather see the current show at LACE. Most of these artists showed 
at LACE long before they showed at MOCA, so if I wanted to find out what's 
really going on, that's where I'd go. 
</P>
<P>
HAIM STEINBACH: "Forest of Signs" is one of the most important shows of the 
decade. Over the past 10 years there's been a turn in the road as far as how 
artists function in the culture, and this show brings together some of the most 
important people who've brought this change about. Historically, I think it's a 
remarkably accurate show, and I feel a deep kinship with this group of people. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of these artists, Semiotics has influenced me quite a bit. Humor is 
also central to much of this work -- it's often used as a distancing device -- 
and there's a lot of anxiety in this work as well. We in the 20th Century are 
very aware of developments in sociology, anthropology and psychoanalysis, and a 
lot of these artists are involved in those things. 
</P>
<P>
"Forest of Signs" is also about the destruction of the romantic archetype of 
the artist. The starving, struggling creature who isn't recognized until he 
dies -- there will always be people who live that life, but increasingly, 
artists are objecting to the extremity of this 19th-Century myth and refusing 
to participate in it. The public, of course, is always reluctant to relinquish 
an archetype, and many people reject this work as cold and cynical. Personally, 
I find this art extremely hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
CINDY SHERMAN: My work is about identity -- how people choose their identities, 
how environment enhances identity, and the ways that society sees itself. As to 
my own identity, I'm very different from my work. I'm extremely shy, retiring 
and a homebody and I'm not remotely intellectual. I've never been a reader of 
books and my sensibility has been completely shaped by mass media. I watch a 
lot of TV and movies, and flip through magazines. Bad TV and manipulative 
advertising are valid language systems that can't be ignored, and I watch the 
worst TV shows I can find to remind myself of just how bad it is. Whatever 
books I have, I simply look at the pictures. It's not that I think reading is 
unimportant -- I wish I was more literate -- but my mother was a reading 
teacher and maybe this is my way of rebelling. 
</P>
<P>
Commodification also interests me, and I try to address it in my work in a 
roundabout way. I don't make art about the art marketplace, but I try not to 
make my work too accessible, sometimes to the point that I challenge people as 
far as wanting to own some of the pieces. These difficult pieces are my 
response to the popularity some of my work from a few years ago was 
experiencing. 
</P>
<P>
Is the work in this show cynical? Yes, I think it is. This art came out of a 
boring era -- the '70s -- and there's an anger in the work that's a response to 
that. My work seems to be growing increasingly cynical, although generally I 
wouldn't describe it as cynical. There's a humor and poignancy in my work that 
tempers any underlying cynicism -- but then, I'm always wrong in my 
interpretations of my work. I always think it's not nearly as affronting as 
other people seem to find it. People tell me I have a real whacked-out sense of 
humor. 
</P>
<P>
MATT MULLICAN: My father was a Surrealist painter and his generation really 
believed they were pioneering a new way of seeing things, but my generation is 
too aware of how the world works to harbor that illusion. At the same time, I 
don't think this generation of artists is any more savvy about commerce than 
the last one was. This commodification business seems to be a big deal in the 
art world right now, but I find art that critiques its own market a bit boring. 
There have to be other things going on as well. 
</P>
<P>
Graphics and design interest me greatly, and my work is essentially about the 
language and fabric of signs. I devised a language of signs that could 
accommodate different ways of interpreting the world, and a lot of my early 
signs were taken straight out of the culture -- the international signs you 
find at airports, for instance. Because of that, I was called an appropriator 
when that was the hot word. 
</P>
<P>
Because I use words like God, heaven and hell in my work, people seem to 
perceive me as some mystic off in the countryside inventing systems that have 
nothing to do with reality. I have a funny image, maybe because I've used 
hypnosis in a lot of my work, and that's made people see me as some kind of 
shaman. But if you want to talk about mass media, hypnosis is right there. 
</P>
<P>
In a funny way, I'm the oddball in every show. I was recently in a show called 
"The Spirit in Abstract Painting," which was the exact opposite of this show in 
many respects. But then, all these group exhibitions are abstractions. They 
take one aspect of various artists' work and blow it up so there's a visible 
link between artists who are actually very different. I feel more of a kinship 
with this group of artists than I've felt with many groups I've been lumped in 
with, but there aren't real strong links in our work, other than the fact that 
none of us are concerned with painterly issues, and we're not hands-on artists. 
I do most of my work in my notebooks and have things fabricated all the time. 
</P>
<P>
MIKE KELLEY: Most of these artists use the vocabulary of mass media rather than 
the traditional high art vocabulary, but beyond that, you can't make 
generalizations about this show because there are great differences among the 
artists it includes. My work, for instance, is basically about glossed-over 
degradation, while Matt Mullican -- who represents the opposite end of the 
spectrum -- is a spiritual artist. 
</P>
<P>
Much of this work deals with the commodification of the art world -- a fact 
that seems to shock many people but doesn't faze me in the least. The art world 
functions just like the business world and always has. The only difference is 
this cultural myth that artists are 'special people' -- which, of course, 
they're not. 
</P>
<P>
This work is often described as cold, but I find it highly emotional. My 
generation doesn't see corporate stuff as devoid of emotion -- there's an 
intense emotionality to the repressive corporate mentality. 
</P>
<P>
BARBARA KRUGER: My work is about how pictures and words have the power to tell 
us who we can and can't be -- I try to dislodge that power in my work. I'm 
often described as a political artist, but really, isn't there a politic in 
every conversation we have? Every deal we close? Every face we kiss? Politics 
is in every exchange of power between human beings. 
</P>
<P>
I've also been described as a conceptual artist, but I come out of graphic 
design, and formally, my work is almost entirely shaped by having worked for 
years with words and pictures as a graphic designer. I didn't have an art 
education and don't think about the art world. I write a monthly column for 
Artforum, not about art but about TV and movies because those are language 
systems I understand. 
</P>
<P>
I'm also extremely interested in journalism, and if I had tons of money I'd 
start a new daily newspaper in New York. Journalists have tremendous power to 
construct histories -- as do television writers and museum curators -- and the 
ways in which histories come to be written is very important for me. For the 
past two years I've co-organized a series of panel discussions on the 
regulation of fantasy, sexuality and the law, journalism and the construction 
of the news, and we have a book coming out on all this in two months. It's 
called "Re-Making History" and it's a compilation of essays on the ways that 
gender and race have come to bear on history. 
</P>
<P>
My piece for this show is based on the Pledge of Allegiance, which I'll present 
juxtaposed with questions such as: Who is beyond the law? Who is bought and 
sold? Who laughs last and dies first? It will be on a large exterior wall, so 
people who know nothing about MOCA will read it, and I find that 
extraordinarily exciting. I'm very happy the MOCA curators have allowed me that 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
GRETCHEN BENDER: The advertising industry, politics merging with entertainment 
-- art has to infiltrate these things that the media does so beautifully, and 
that's what this show is about. Pop art explored much of this territory during 
the '60s, but Pop worked in a different way; Pop tended to flatten things, but 
these artists take a more active, guerrilla tactics approach. This culture has 
an incredible capacity to neutralize anything and everything, so it's very hard 
to make an effective statement of any kind, but my hope is that art will become 
more dangerous and politically active. 
</P>
<P>
Women are very prominent in this field of art making because women aren't as 
invested in the idea of the heroic, and this is very anti-heroic art. That 
women do well with this kind of work could also have something to do with the 
fact that we've been excluded from the culture in so many ways for so long that 
maybe we've learned to analyze the culture more deeply -- in an attempt to 
understand why we occupy the position we've been given. 
</P>
<P>
STEPHEN PRINA: In some respects I don't believe in the idea of mass media. Mass 
media is often discussed as if there's something apart that can be identified 
as mass media, but in fact, it's enveloped the entire culture. Everything is in 
channel and you can't get outside of it, so I don't think in terms of low and 
high culture; they completely permeate one another. 
</P>
<P>
The mechanism of translation -- how one thing gets translated into something 
else -- is a central concern in my work. For instance, I took a phrase to 
Berlitz Translation Service and had it translated into all 61 languages they 
had at their disposal. Linguistic systems are also of interest to me, as is the 
system of exhibition and how it leads to the interpretation of artworks. I see 
this exhibition as a means of clarifying issues that may not be immediately 
intelligible; how a subject is constituted, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
ROBERT LONGO: "Forest of Signs" is about what's been going on while everybody 
was out buying Neo-Expressionist paintings. This is art about media literacy 
and not ignoring what you know, and all these artists are very tuned in to the 
landscape that we live in -- and, that landscape has a great deal to do with 
the media. We're the children of 'The Medium is the Message,' and we want to 
know what's under the surface of the images that surround us. I wanna know 
what's going on when a slick advertiser tries to sell me Jello. 
</P>
<P>
This work is often discussed in terms of Semiotics, but Semiotics hasn't been 
important for me. People like Baudrillard -- that stuff makes no sense to me, 
and though I don't reject Semiotics, I don't read it. But then, I'm not a 
reader -- I make images.

IS THIS THE PASTA OF THE '90S? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE OCHOA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In November, a front-page story in the Wall Street Journal announced it had 
gained cachet. Last month, Cook's magazine called it "The Pasta of the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
This isn't some boutique farmer's neat new invention. This is rice -- you've 
heard of it. Most of the world has been hip to it for some time. In China, the 
Rice Measure symbolizes justice, mercy and virtue. In Hong Kong, social workers 
ferret out welfare cheats by snooping in applicants' rice bins to check the 
quality of rice stocked. And in Los Angeles, risotto is showing up in all the 
best places. 
</P>
<P>
But is rice really the pasta of the '90s? 
</P>
<P>
"No way," Valentino's Piero Selvaggio says. "Rice is one-dimensional while 
pasta is multi-multi dimensional." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, no, no, no," says Celestino Drago, owner/chef of Beverly Hills' Celestino. 
"I don't think that rice can ever be as popular as pasta in America." 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely not," Mauro Vincente of Rex and Pazzia declares. "It's more 
popular, yes, but nothing can replace pasta." 
</P>
<P>
You can't blame Italians for being defensive about pasta. If F.T. Marinetti had 
his way in Italy before World War II, rice would have been the pasta of the 
'30s. His "Manifesto of Futurist Cuisine" denounced pasta -- and especially 
macaroni -- as an oppressive political element responsible for, among other 
things, weakness, pessimism, inactivity and fat-bellied conceit. The only 
solution Marinetti saw to this macaroni blight was a total ban on pasta -- with 
rice as the sole starch substitute. Needless to say, Mussolini ignored his 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
Even American-born chefs think pasta is irreplaceable. "We don't have the same 
relationship to rice as we have to pasta," says chef Evan Kleiman of Trattoria 
Angeli. "I mean, every kid in America eats spaghetti, right? It's a fun thing 
to eat. Rice, on the other hand, has always been this badly treated, boiled 
gloppy thing that sat on the side of the plate." 
</P>
<P>
So what is it about rice? Well, where Rice-a-Roni was once the most exotic rice 
dish Americans -- Southerners excluded -- had been exposed to, interesting 
ethnic rice dishes are now common, at least in large cities. Kleiman admits to 
being hooked on the crusty Persian rice dish sometimes called chelo or chilau. 
And Toribio Prado, who always cooked at least one token pasta dish at Cha Cha 
Cha and Cafe Mambo, decided no pasta dishes were necessary on the rice-heavy 
menu at El Mocambo (see review above). What's more, Cook's magazine reports 
that American rice consumption has doubled since the late '70s. 
</P>
<P>
And if you thought you were tired of oat bran stories, wait till rice bran 
fever hits. Once the stuff was used as cattle and pig feed, but last year 
preliminary experiments on test hamsters at the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
in Albany, Calif., showed that defatted rice bran not only lowers cholesterol 
levels, it's a double-strength cholesterol reducer -- something like new 
improved double-strength Tide.

It wasn't your typical help-wanted ad for a job in San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
The job description called for someone who is visionary, creative, a leader, a 
team player, a salesman, a personnel administrator, a business manager, a 
financial planner, an effective communicator and an accomplished academician. 
Preference, as they say, will be given to those who can walk on water. 
</P>
<P>
The ad ran once in a trade journal and, combined with a targeted direct mail 
campaign, helped generate 180 job applicants from throughout the United States. 
By June 13, one man or woman will be selected for the job that carries with it 
the title of president, California State University, San Marcos -- at a site of 
a one-time chicken ranch. 
</P>
<P>
On and around this person, a university will be built, the first new one in the 
California State University system in 20 years and, according to the American 
Assn. of State Colleges and Universities, the first one of its size and scope 
in 10 years in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The people making the search are confident that they won't get a slouch for the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
50 Presidents Among Candidates 
</P>
<P>
The names of the candidates are not publicly disclosed, but among them are 50 
current presidents of universities and colleges. They come from private schools 
and public ones, including from the California State University system itself. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the largest turnout, the largest showing of interest, we've ever had for 
any of our presidencies," said Caesar Naples, vice chancellor for faculty and 
staff relations for the CSU system and the staff executive leading the search 
for the president. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm impressed by the turnout, but I'm not surprised," Naples said. "I can 
understand why almost anyone, from the East Coast to the West, north to south, 
large university or small, would be fascinated and captivated by the challenge 
of starting a new university. It would be the 20th campus in an outstanding 
public higher education system coupled with a wonderful location." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Letters Also Sent Out 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the ad that ran in the Chronicle of Higher Education, Naples 
sent letters about the San Marcos post to 1,400 college and university 
presidents and chancellors across the country, as well as 500-plus letters to 
heads of minority organizations involved in education, soliciting nominations 
for the job. 
</P>
<P>
The 13-member search committee has since narrowed the list to 15 semifinalists 
based on the strength of their resumes and a reading of their one- and two-page 
cover letters. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven of the 15 have already been personally interviewed by the search 
committee, which includes trustees, professors, alumni, a university staff 
employee and a student. The final four candidates will be interviewed May 24. 
</P>
<P>
After the interviews, the 15 will be narrowed to three to five finalists whose 
names will then become public and who will be taken to the San Marcos campus 
site early next month for further interviews and meetings with university and 
community leaders. During the same period, background checks will be conducted 
on their home campuses, where a more accurate picture of the candidate may 
develop. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, on June 13, the finalists will be interviewed again by the full board 
of trustees in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
University trustees are expected to make -- and announce -- their decision that 
same day. 
</P>
<P>
There will be little negotiation between trustees and the applicant; starting 
salary will be about $106,000 a year, plus benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"All 15 people we're interviewing now meet all the requirements. Obviously, 
they're different people with different strengths -- some are stronger in one 
area than another," Naples said. "But we're in the fortunate position of not 
having to say, 'This particular person can't do X, but he does Y quite well.' 
In our situation, we have people who meet all the qualifications, and now it's 
a question of the fit, of who will be best for our needs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Finest Educators in Country' 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at the finest educators in the country," Naples said. "It's my 
job to be aware of all the presidential vacancies in the country, and to see 
who is available to fill them. I can tell you we're getting the lion's share of 
the best people in our search for San Marcos." 
</P>
<P>
And who wouldn't want the job? An offer to go out and build a university is a 
once-in-a-career opportunity. Hire your deans. Recruit your core faculty. 
Design a curriculum. Attract the students. Build a marriage between campus and 
community. Create a reputation. 
</P>
<P>
It would seem, then, that the best man or woman for the job is the trustees' 
for the picking. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Day, president of San Diego State University, isn't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
Day contends that the best person for the job will have to be convinced to take 
it. Anyone less cautious about stepping into the unknown should be viewed 
warily, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're looking for someone who is very good, as a general rule you're 
looking at someone who is doing well where he is, and who probably wants to 
stay there, and is not desperate for a new job elsewhere," Day said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Don't Come Looking for You' 
</P>
<P>
"You could post almost any job and get 100 to 150 candidates. There are groups 
of people who will apply for anything, and may not be qualified," he said. 
"When you're in private industry, when you look for a CEO, you usually have to 
persuade that person to come to you. They don't come looking for you. 
</P>
<P>
"That shouldn't be any different with a university president," Day said. "The 
best people come from that small cadre who have to be persuaded they want your 
job more than they want their own. The shoe is on the foot of the CSU to 
persuade the right person to come. If they get down to three, four or five, 
hopefully you'll be dealing with someone whose mind-set is that you have to 
persuade me that I want the job, that it's better than the one I already have 
or is better than an offer I am considering elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Day was not asked to participate in the search for a president at San Marcos, 
although he might seem a logical choice, given that SDSU planted the seed for 
the campus when it opened its North County Center in Vista in 1979 with 148 
students. Because of its success, and the population growth in North County, 
the state Legislature agreed that a full-fledged university should be built, 
and the 300-acre site in San Marcos was purchased. The campus will open in the 
fall of 1992 with upper-division and graduate students, and in 1995 will open 
to freshmen and sophomores as well. 
</P>
<P>
But Day is not popular in the highest ranks of the chancellor's office in Long 
Beach. His infighting with headquarters, characterized by some as a power 
struggle between him and Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds, is a poorly kept secret. 
</P>
<P>
The leverage lacking with Day and his many local supporters -- including State 
Assemblyman Bill Craven (R-Carlsbad) -- was evident last year when they 
unsuccessfully argued to CSU trustees that the San Marcos campus should remain 
under the wings of SDSU as a satellite campus until at least 1995, to give it a 
running start. But trustees, at the recommendation of Reynolds, opted for the 
immediate establishment of the autonomous campus, partly so that, with its own 
president, it can begin formulating its own curriculum, core faculty and 
identity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opening Is 4th in 2 Years 
</P>
<P>
The San Marcos presidency opening, Naples noted, is the fourth over the past 
two years within the CSU system, and through that repeated presidential search 
process his office has an extensive knowledge of who is, and isn't, on the job 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Naples won't say whether the chancellor's office has attempted to recruit 
specific candidates for the presidency of San Marcos. But the office has done 
it in the past. 
</P>
<P>
A case in point is John Pfau, who in 1962 was a dean at the fledgling Sonoma 
State College, situated at the time in a row of garden apartments before a 
permanent campus was built about 70 miles north of San Francisco. Pfau, busily 
hiring faculty members and establishing a new curriculum in social sciences, 
was asked by the chancellor's office to apply for the job as founding president 
of Cal State San Bernardino -- a university that existed only on paper. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew a college was opening up somewhere in Southern California, but I didn't 
know they were starting the search for a president until I got a call from 
someone in the chancellor's office who knew about my professional career," Pfau 
said. He said he was flattered by the request that he apply for the job and he 
is unsure if he would have applied on his own. 
</P>
<P>
He was founding president of Cal State San Bernardino until his retirement in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
Pfau said he believes he got the job because, at the dean level, he had 
practical experience in building an academic department from the ground up. By 
extension, trustees decided, he could build an entire university. 
</P>
<P>
Pfau later served on four presidential search committees -- including the one 
that led to Day's selection as president of SDSU. And, like Day, Pfau is an 
advocate of seeking out specific people for the job. But he also agrees with 
the chancellor's office that the best candidate may simply nominate himself 
after reading the job announcement in a trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that, if you know somebody who has the right kind of 
background, skills and ability, you ask him to apply and you may end up with a 
good person," he said. "But there are a lot of good people out there who you 
might not know, so you advertise and spread the word, too. You find a lot of 
good people that way." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Day was a vice chancellor at the College Park campus of the 
University of Maryland when he took over as president of SDSU in 1978. "I was 
perfectly happy there and wasn't looking around," he said. But a friend 
nominated him for the SDSU presidency and he pursued it, partly because "I 
wanted to see San Diego. When it came to that stage of the interviews, I 
decided to fly out and look at the place." 
</P>
<P>
Day said visiting the campus convinced him he wanted the job, because of "its 
spirit, the atmosphere, the campus life and a tremendous faculty that was very 
alive and interesting." Such sales points don't exist when trying to persuade a 
university executive to commit to a non-existent campus, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Being a founding president "is too chancy," Day said. "It could be a very 
attractive job if you've got the state giving you money for buildings and 
operations and the chancellor's office is behind you and the board is behind 
you so when the inevitable foul-ups occur during the first few years, they 
don't turn from you. 
</P>
<P>
"But it can be an absolute quagmire, too," Day said. "The faculty can harass 
you if you don't hire this person or that. The funds can dry up." 
</P>
<P>
Day said he is especially doubtful that the search committee will find a 
sitting president in his 50s who wants the job. "It's most unlikely that a 
really talented, good-working, sitting president of that age would want to 
start over again. You've already gotten the adulation of being called 
president. You won't get anything new in being president of a small, unknown 
institution that you haven't already gotten where you are. If an older 
president really wants it, I'd be worried about why. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Challenge for Younger Person 
</P>
<P>
"For a younger president, 45 or 40 at the youngest, it may be a real challenge 
to start in mud and build a monument -- and I might apply myself, if I was that 
young," Day said. "But the trustees would have to persuade me. My frame of mind 
would be, 'Show me why I should want it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Others see it differently. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Marchese, vice president of the American Assn. for Higher Education and 
author of "The Search Committee Handbook," said a role as a founding president 
holds certain allure to people on a mission, including sitting presidents 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's a chance to involve yourself in areas you really care about, but with a 
clean slate -- increasing minority participation or improving faculty 
scholarship or better serving the host community or making the school more 
accessible to adult, part-time students. There's no seat better to advance 
those things than as president of a new university," Marchese said. 
</P>
<P>
A founding presidency, he said, "is the kind of task that would excite the most 
talented individuals. Here's a chance to start from scratch. It would 
definitely interest many sitting presidents who are frustrated in their current 
situations and welcome a chance to run with some of their own ideas in a fresh 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
"I know a lot of presidents who are 50 or 55 and who are not burned out. They 
have lots of energy and still have fire in their belly," Marchese said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reputable Dean May Surface 
</P>
<P>
Others say a reputable dean, experienced in curriculum development and faculty 
hiring, may surface as the president. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 15 semifinalists, according to search team members, are candidates 
who have, to one degree or another, been involved with establishing new 
colleges elsewhere and are familiar with starting from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of a president will probably turn political at some point, 
Marchese said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many more competing interests and constituencies in a presidential 
appointment than there are in a simpler, inside appointment such as that of a 
dean," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The governor will have an interest. The board members will. The alumni, the 
administrators, the faculty, the staff, the students, wealthy donors and even 
the surrounding community," Marchese said. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Punch, coordinator of student services at the SDSU North County Center, 
was assigned to the search committee to lend a university staff perspective to 
the search. She says she is doing that. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Motivation of Staff 
</P>
<P>
"We want someone who understands and is committed to affirmative action and 
believes in the continuing education and motivation of the staff, someone who 
is an open communicator with the staff and who will listen to the people 
working for him, sharing in our expertise," Punch said. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow committee member E. Nicholas Genovese, a professor of classics at SDSU, 
said he is looking for "a proven administrator with a record at a reputable 
institution -- a university -- who has an academic background of publication 
that would gain the respect immediately of every professor at the institution." 
</P>
<P>
Added Genovese: "I'm not disappointed in who we have before us. We have people 
who can do the job right." 
</P>
<P>
Genovese said he is not sure if any of the semifinalists have to be sold on the 
job, despite the position of his own university president. "Even if someone is 
satisfied in their current position, I'd expect them to see this as an 
extraordinary opportunity and not hesitate to come and be a founding president. 
The people I see are eager, not to escape somewhere else, but because they 
think this is really good for them." 
</P>
<P>
CSU Trustee and San Diego businessman Ralph Pesqueira is chairman of the search 
committee and said he brings the bias of a businessman to the selection. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Dynamic Personality' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking for a chief executive officer with a dynamic personality who will 
not only be able to communicate with the community, but with contractors, deans 
and faculty members," Pesqueira said. "He's going to have to have the ability 
to have a dozen things running through his mind at the same time, have a 
take-charge attitude and not spend a great deal of time in personal decision 
making. I want him to have confidence and be willing to make a mistake if he at 
least makes his decision quickly -- and make adjustments quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Pesqueira said he has detected a difference among the candidates he has so far 
interviewed for the job. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember one person making the comment that it would be a tremendous 
opportunity to do something fresh. With some of our candidates, you can see 
their independence. Others aren't. The more independent ones are the ones 
really excited about building a campus," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia LaCrowix, with the respected Los Angeles executive search firm 
Korn-Ferry International, said she has found during eight years of searching 
for campus administrators that finding a president for an established 
institution calls for different criteria than for finding one to start up a new 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
It's one thing to look for a presidential candidate "who can bring a certain 
level of sophistication to a well-established operation. Some people thrive on 
that," she said. "But there are others who are excellent in start-up 
situations, a roll-up-the-sleeves, hands-on approach to setting up an 
institution from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people would be overwhelmed by that, and others would be challenged and 
excited," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ira Krinsky, who runs his own Los Angeles-based headhunter firm specializing in 
education, said one of the initial challenges of the San Marcos president "will 
be to convince people in town that the university is a good thing. He's going 
to have to allay the fear of people who are against growth and who want to make 
sure this university won't be a behemoth, the tail that wags the dog." 
</P>
<P>
Said Pesqueira: "Each of us on the committee has his or her own idea of what a 
president looks like, true or false. I am quite surprised at the caliber of the 
people who are applying for this job. I was overwhelmed." 
</P>
<P>
The search has been enlightening, Pesqueira said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the candidates looked "so good on paper -- their resumes were far and 
away the best in the group -- we wondered, 'Why not hire this guy today? Why 
look further?' But, in the interviews, the guy didn't cut it. You ask yourself, 
'Is this the same guy we read about on the resume? What happened to him?' " 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, he said, some applicants had sketchy resumes. "But, when they walk 
in and sit down, they command your attention and you think, 'This guy is 
great!' " 
</P>
<P>
Pesqueira said he expects to learn even more about the finalists when they are 
taken to the San Marcos site for still more interviews with others. 
</P>
<P>
"I was told of a previous search where an excellent candidate passed the 
interview with the committee and had an excellent resume, but then he was taken 
out to the campus for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
"At 12 noon he said he had to take a nap," Pesqueira said. "Needless to say, he 
didn't get the job. He didn't have the stamina for it." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Margarito Sanchez planted more than 1,000 tomato plants last year, in between 
fixing fences, growing cacti, feeding donkeys and repairing the roof of his 
stepdaughter's three-bedroom home in Jamul. 
</P>
<P>
For any other hard-working tomato farmer, it might have been just an average 
year. But, for Sanchez, 39, who lost a leg and severely injured the other in a 
train accident two years ago near Tijuana, it was an exceptional year. 
</P>
<P>
Despite having to rely at times on a wheelchair and on a heavy, home-made, 
wooden leg, Sanchez manages to climb trees to cut away overgrown branches, 
repair water lines for neighbors and clamber up ladders to paint houses. In 
December, Sanchez, a Mexican national, was granted temporary amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
But he knows that to stay among his beloved tomato plants he will have to 
convince immigration authorities that he can support himself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fixes Everything 
</P>
<P>
"Now, working is the principal thing, my No. 1," said Sanchez, whose temporary 
amnesty expires at the end of the year. He lives with his stepdaughter, a legal 
resident, and her husband, a U.S. citizen, and hopes to be granted permanent 
amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
His stepdaughter, Leticia Sullivan, said Sanchez, who grew up in Mexicali, 
fixes everything around the house. "Electricity, water, he never complains . . 
. . He can't stay lying around the house. He's so hyper. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not afraid to go fishing. He goes out in a boat by himself. He built his 
own room in the garage, because he wanted to live there. . . . He does 
everything. He even washes his own clothes and he makes good flour tortillas." 
</P>
<P>
Before the accident, Sanchez was a truck driver, fisherman, mechanic and 
odd-job man, but his life changed forever on a set of railway tracks in the 
Mexican town of La Mesa, near Tijuana, when a San Diego and Imperial Valley 
Railroad engineer spotted him too late to stop the train. The freight, which 
goes through Tijuana at least six times a week and makes a run to Tecate twice 
a week, originates in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The train tore off his right leg and pinned his left leg against the track. 
Sanchez said that, if he had had a pistol, he would have shot himself, the pain 
was so bad. Sanchez conceded that he was drinking the night of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Screaming and Screaming' 
</P>
<P>
"I was screaming and screaming until I couldn't scream anymore," Sanchez said 
through an interpreter. It took authorities more than an hour to free him. He 
was taken to a public hospital in Tijuana where he said "they treated me really 
bad, gave me a bed and that was it." 
</P>
<P>
Both his stepdaughter's husband, Gene Sullivan -- a Los Angeles County 
probation officer who lives in Jamul three days a week -- and a Spring Valley 
chiropractor who later treated Sanchez speculate that he drank until he passed 
out on the tracks. Leticia Sullivan thinks someone slipped something in one of 
her stepfather's drinks. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez, who says he no longer drinks, believes the train was heading to 
Tecate, but records show it was going the other way. Either way, follow-up care 
was poor and Leticia Sullivan is bitter that doctors did not work harder to 
save her stepfather's left leg. 
</P>
<P>
From the room in Tijuana where he spent time recovering, Sanchez used a pair of 
binoculars to watch illegal aliens crossing the border. A few months later, 
after family friend and chiropractor James A. Wilson wrote immigration 
officials saying he would treat Sanchez's injuries without charge, authorities 
allowed him to enter the United States for medical care. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the first things he did when he got here was ask me for a block of wood 
so he could start carving a leg. . . . He calls it a bionic leg," Gene Sullivan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The second thing he asked for, Sullivan recalled, was a packet of tomato seeds. 
Sanchez had crossed into the United States illegally several times before to 
work in the fields. 
</P>
<P>
Since his injury, he has worked hard to make the Sullivan's two-acre plot on 
Lyons Valley Road home, raising tomatoes, cacti and geraniums, and fixing 
anything that needs repair. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Sanchez will have to tie each tomato plant so that it grows straight. 
There are 900 plants now, but more will be planted. Before the harvest, when 
some of the plants are 6 feet tall, Sanchez will have had to tie each plant 
three times. He hand-fertilizes each plant with horse manure and, if necessary, 
a handful of commercial fertilizer. Using his arms to drag himself from plant 
to plant, he also picks off any bugs he sees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sadness Is Gone 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he harbors resentment about the accident, Sanchez said, "I don't feel 
anything. The sadness is gone. The only thing I know is I cannot walk." 
</P>
<P>
Smoking a cigarette during a break from installing a new irrigation system, 
Sanchez told a visitor that he draws his strength from watching his plants grow 
and bear fruit. 
</P>
<P>
"My strength comes from my mind; the body is not as important," he said. "In 
the beginning I felt bad. But working, you don't think about it. Keep busy. 
It's the best thing you can do. If I'm just lying there, I'm going to think 
(about) depression." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, the Spring Valley chiropractor who offered Sanchez his services, said: 
"He's got a fighting spirit. . . . He wouldn't be here without it. He would 
have been dead a long time ago. A lot of people lay down and expect society to 
wait on them. He's not one of those people. He's no burden to anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Sporting a sea-green work shirt, faded jeans and a pair of denim cutoff shorts 
-- so as not to wear out the seat of his pants -- Sanchez grinned as he 
remembered making a bus trip to Sacramento alone. 
</P>
<P>
He earned enough money from the $1,200 the Sullivans took in last year -- after 
selling more than 4,000 pounds of tomatoes -- to visit his sister and 
brother-in-law for several months. While he was there, he took up temporary 
employment in a print shop. Back in Jamul afterward, Sanchez repaired cars, 
fixed washing machines, built geranium planters, erected greenhouses and pulled 
down fences. From his wheelchair he even shot rabbits that dared eat his tomato 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
In his spare time, which is rare, he likes to eat a steak-and-tomato dish

BORDER SEWAGE PLANT PROPOSAL ON RIGHT TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The revival of the idea to build a plant in the United States to treat Mexican 
sewage should come as a welcome relief. 
</P>
<P>
For too long, San Diegans have deluded themselves with the idea of returning 
Tijuana's "renegade" sewage flows to Mexico for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The return-to-sender idea is one that appeals to a natural sense of equity: In 
a perfect world, Mexico's sewage should be treated in Mexico. Mexico would 
prefer it; so would the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But, right now and for the foreseeable future, that's not realistic. 
</P>
<P>
Tijuana took a significant step toward the goal of treating its own sewage in 
1987 when it opened a sewage treatment plant. That was a major accomplishment 
given Mexico's severe economic problems. But the plant, designed as just the 
first phase of a larger plan, has been overburdened from the beginning. And the 
country's economic difficulties remain daunting. So Tijuana -- a city where 
many homes do not even have running water -- is probably a long way from an 
adequate sewage treatment system. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as Tijuana makes progress in bringing water to more homes -- a 
priority understandably ahead of sewage treatment -- the amount of raw sewage 
flowing into the Tijuana River is increasing. Every day, 8 million to 12 
million gallons of raw sewage enter California and flow into wetlands and into 
the Pacific at Imperial Beach. That is estimated to increase to as much as 40 
million to 50 million gallons a day by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
The Tijuana River is essentially an open sewer. 
</P>
<P>
Already, 2 1/2 miles of U. S. beach are quarantined, and have been for six 
years. Health officials say this quarantine could spread to Coronado or San 
Diego Bay under certain conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Mosquitoes, which are carriers of encephalitis and malaria, breed in the 
sewage, as do bacteria and viruses that cause serious intestinal diseases, such 
as hepatitis. Health officials say this is a serious health threat. 
</P>
<P>
The sewage is damaging a wildlife refuge and the Tijuana River National 
Estuarine Sanctuary, one of only 18 such federally protected research reserves 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
But, in spite of these ongoing problems, the idea of building a plant in the 
United States to treat this sewage to protect our beaches and health has been 
politically and diplomatically unworkable. 
</P>
<P>
Congress has not wanted to foot the bill to solve another country's problem, 
and the Mexican government, although it could not afford to solve the problem 
itself, did not want to relinquish control of it. 
</P>
<P>
So plans were made to build a defensive system to route the sewage back to 
Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Some of this has been done. But the idea of building a huge pipe to send back 
millions of gallons of sewage to a plant that is having trouble handling its 
current load makes no sense. 
</P>
<P>
What makes better sense is the newest plan for a treatment plant in the United 
States, being spearheaded by International Boundary and Water Commissioner 
Narendra Gunaji. 
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the plant, with an initial capacity of 25 million gallons 
a day, could be built with realistic contributions from Mexico, the U.S. 
government and the state. The plant also might mesh well with San Diego's 
efforts to upgrade its sewage treatment to meet federal standards. 
</P>
<P>
What's most promising about this revival of the plan, however, is that the 
Mexican government appears to be giving it serious consideration, and further 
talks are planned for this summer. 
</P>
<P>
But there is still considerable skepticism on whether Congress can be persuaded 
to appropriate upward of $100 million to build the plant. 
</P>
<P>
That reluctance is understandable. But having an open sewer emptying into a 
national estuary and spoiling beaches in the United States in 1989 is 
unacceptable. It has become as much a U.S. problem as a Mexican problem. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the $192-million overall projected cost of the plant is a 
relatively small amount in this country. To put it into context: Upgrading San 
Diego's sewage treatment to meet federal standards is expected to cost at least 
$1.5 billion and the half-cent sales tax increase for jails and courts is 
expected to generate $100 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
But Mexico must also contribute and cooperate. This will be especially 
important as Tijuana's population grows. 
</P>
<P>
Neither side has been able to solve this problem alone. But perhaps this time, 
by working together and setting aside mistrust, a long-term solution to the 
long-term problem of sewage is possible.

LAKE AND DEMOCRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It would seem that Mayor O'Connor and most of the San Diego City Council do not 
have the pulse of the people they purport to serve. 
</P>
<P>
By a 7-2 vote they decided to keep the "Save Miramar Lake" referendum from 
September's ballot. True, the development agreement with BCE has been 
rescinded, but it still leaves no protection for the hills on the north side of 
the lake. Even though over 47,000 voters signed the petition, they cannot vote 
on the issue. Doesn't speak too well of our democratic way. 
</P>
<P>
It would appear that the three members of "Gang of Five" up for reelection in 
September have a fear of being "in bed" with the developers publicly if the 
matter were put to a public vote.

3 CHARGED IN ROOF-COATING SCHEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three men were charged with 18 felonies, including robbery, burglary and grand 
theft, in connection with a home-repair scam that bilked mostly seniors, 
authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the suspects, James Monroe, 46, of Lakewood, and Bill Thompson, 36, of 
Norwalk, were fugitives and being sought on warrants, Sheriff's Deputy Pat 
Hunter said. The third suspect, Bob Tillis, 32, of Norwalk, faces arraignment 
May 24, Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
The three "allegedly duped several elderly homeowners into paying up to $7,500 
for having their roofs sprayed with a substance that the suspects claimed would 
seal the roofs against the elements for up to 20 years," Hunter said. The roof 
treatment, a concoction of gasoline, aluminum paint and a sticky tar-like 
material, "is useless as a sealant and is equivalent of painting the roof with 
a thin coating of aluminum paint," Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
When they were arrested the men had $4,000 in cash, stolen property and false 
certificates guaranteeing their roofing jobs, authorities said.

CELEBRATED PIECE OF CHICAGO ADDS SPICE TO NEWSY HOT DOG STAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chicago is Norm Rubin's kind of town. 
</P>
<P>
But he can't be there all the time, so the Santa Monica real estate developer 
brought a little piece of the Windy City to the City of Angels. He bought a 
dismantled 38-foot section of Chicago's famous elevated railway line and used 
it to construct a Chicago-style hot dog stand in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a four-year dream come true," Rubin, 60, said Saturday as he relaxed 
on the patio under the railway tracks in front of his restaurant, Rubin's Red 
Hot, scheduled to open Tuesday. "Some people at my age buy yachts; I wanted to 
buy a hot dog stand." 
</P>
<P>
Rubin's vision on Ventura Boulevard across from the Sherman Oaks Galleria is 
far more than just a bare-bones corner hot dog stand. It is a whimsical 
building that cost $750,000 to construct and is a Hollywood version of the 
atmosphere that Rubin, a former Universal Studios vice president, remembers 
from his childhood in suburban Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
As a boy, Rubin said, he used to buy a Pepsi for a nickel in the corner 
drugstore and read comic books in the aisles until the druggist kicked him out. 
"Children here today don't have any place to go to have a hot dog and buy a 
newspaper," Rubin said. "I wanted to marry a hot dog stand with a newsstand." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kiosk From Paris 
</P>
<P>
His newsstand is a green newspaper kiosk imported from Paris at a cost of 
$20,000. Rubin said the cylindrical structure is reminiscent of the days that 
he was stationed in Paris with the military. The kiosk sits on the patio and 
will offer newspapers and magazines so patrons can eat, drink and read, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As well as kosher hot dogs shipped from Chicago, the restaurant will serve 
chicken and fish salads and sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
Once Rubin decided three years ago to create his ideal hot dog stand, he wanted 
to develop a unique logo. That's when a relative who still lives in Chicago 
told him that a three-block section of the elevated railway at the end of the 
Jackson Park line was slated for demolition. Rubin decided to buy a piece of 
the El. 
</P>
<P>
"McDonald's has the golden arches -- we wanted something that would make a lot 
of noise," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin paid $75,000 to buy the dismantled segment of the train track, ship it to 
California and put it together again. The structure, which is an integral part 
of the restaurant's architecture, had to be reinforced so that it would comply 
with building codes. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin's son, Samuel, 25, who helped his father develop the restaurant, said 
buying the El segment wasn't that expensive -- it was sold at the going rate 
for scrap metal. Most of the cost was for shipping and rebuilding the 
structure, he said. 
</P>
<P>
All did not go smoothly with the transaction, however. The portion of the track 
that Rubin initially purchased was accidentally melted down in Illinois. To 
prevent similar mishaps, Rubin and his son flew to Chicago and watched the 
workers while they dismantled the length of track now in front of the 
restaurant. They kept their eye on the pieces until they were safely on the 
train to California. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin, who has his own real estate development firm, said he does not plan to 
play a large role in the restaurant's day-to-day operations. He said his 
primary goal in launching the project is to have fun and create a place where 
he can relax and enjoy the company of friends. 
</P>
<P>
But construction costs were three times what he had expected, he said, so he 
hopes the venture will make some money. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps eventually I will go and buy that yacht after all," he said.

GROUP BACKS PORTER RANCH PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
CRITICS QUESTION DEVELOPER'S INFLUENCE ON CITIZENS PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a proposal for a $2-billion development at Porter Ranch approaches a key 
hearing Thursday before the Los Angeles Planning Commission, backers of the 
project are pointing to its nearly unanimous endorsement by a committee of 
citizens who live or work in Northridge or Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Eager to marshal public support, officials of Porter Ranch Development Co. have 
suggested that the plan for about 3,000 residences and 7.5 million square feet 
of commercial space in the hills above Chatsworth is as much the work of the 
citizens panel as of the developer. And City Councilman Hal Bernson, who 
appointed the 14-member committee in 1987, described it as "a cross-section of 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
But a review of members' backgrounds and interviews with dissident members 
raise questions about whether the panel was, in fact, broad-based and 
independent of representatives of the developer, who participated in its 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Executive of Consulting Firm 
</P>
<P>
Eleven of the panel members are in business, including four who work in real 
estate or land development. One member is an executive of a consulting firm 
that worked for the developer on the Porter Ranch project. 
</P>
<P>
The panel includes a former and a current president of the Rock Point 
Homeowners Assn. But the president described himself as "somebody that approves 
of growth." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, no member is employed by environmental agencies or groups, nor is 
a spokesman for "slow-growth" organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson said the panel included "no-growth" advocates, but declined to name 
them. "I don't want to get into personalities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although not announced to the public, the committee's meetings were always 
attended by several consultants, as well as the developer representatives -- 
including former City Councilman Robert Wilkinson -- who often commented on or 
sought to refute statements by committee members. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like they, particularly in some meetings, . . . ran the meeting," said 
one city official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Also attending were 
officials from the city planning and transportation departments, which support 
the project because of road improvements that the developer is expected to 
finance. 
</P>
<P>
The Porter Ranch representatives "sat in on the meetings every night and if 
there was ever any discussion among the members," they would "jump up and start 
trying to, quote, clear the air or to explain the situation, but it was always 
a very lopsided, one-sided viewpoint," complained Faires Ruddell, the only 
dissenter from the panel's 13-1 vote in favor of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel used," said Ruddell, an insurance agent who lives in Simi Valley. It 
"was pretty much predetermined what was going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
John Kelly, who resigned from the committee in a dispute with chairman Howard 
Green, said: "I can't think of anything that was presented to us that wasn't 
from the developer's viewpoint." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Needed at Meetings 
</P>
<P>
But other committee members sharply disagreed. They said they needed project 
officials at the meetings to answer questions. They denied that they were 
overly influenced by the developer's needs and views. 
</P>
<P>
The developer's representatives "were more helpful than they were disruptive," 
said Green, an insurance agent from Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure we asked them for their opinions from time to time because they had 
the background on the project that we didn't have," said committee member 
Robert Whyte, a retired salesman from Chatsworth and president of the Rock 
Point homeowner group. "We had to get it from somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Several committee members said they sometimes had to rebuke the developer 
representatives for taking up too much time during the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"There were many times when we just told them to sit down and observe and be 
quiet, so it was not at all a matter of the tail wagging the dog," said Leo 
Gendernalik, a Northridge developer and vice chairman of the panel. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the committee's work, there will be a long-term plan for development 
of the 1,300-acre site, said member Frank Mazzeo of Northridge, an official of 
Allied-Signal Aerospace Co. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a benefit to having a 20-year plan," Mazzeo said. Without it, 
"helter-skelter development" might result, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Concessions 
</P>
<P>
And members said they secured many concessions from the developer, proving that 
they were not unduly influenced. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the developer's plan for 9 million square feet of office and 
commercial space was shaved to 7.5 million square feet. The developer also 
agreed to provide cultural amenities, such as a theater, under pressure from 
the committee, members said. 
</P>
<P>
With development of a scenic tract on the property a foregone conclusion, the 
goal was to "squeeze our developer real hard so he can give us the amenities 
the community needs," said member Arthur Pfefferman, president of the Donut Inn 
chain. 
</P>
<P>
Committee members, who served as unpaid volunteers, said they spent countless 
hours reviewing reports and attending dozens of meetings during a 14-month 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Porter Ranch representatives have been quick to characterize the plan as one 
proposed by citizens, rather than by the developer. 
</P>
<P>
"To call it a developer's plan would be unfair to the citizens who spent 15 
months of their lives putting it together," said Paul Clarke, a spokesman for 
the development firm. 
</P>
<P>
But Paul Chipello of Northridge, a critic of the proposal, said it should not 
be described as "the citizens' plan," but as "the developer's plan that had 
been somewhat modified by" the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Chipello, who heads a group called PRIDE that is opposed to the 
development, said strong community opposition at public hearings earlier this 
year shows that the panel was not truly representative of the northwest San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very apparent to anyone that public support . . . is certainly not 13 to 
1 in favor of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson said he has been using citizens committees over the past 10 years to 
involve the public in development decisions. In the case of Porter Ranch, 
Bernson said, he supports approval of about 6 million square feet of commercial 
space, a 20% cut from the committee's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a great deal of clout with me," Bernson said. "I would say that 
about 95% of the time I go along with the committees." 
</P>
<P>
One of Bernson's appointees is Frank Wein, an official with Michael Brandman 
Associates, a consulting firm that helped prepare the environmental impact 
report for Porter Ranch Development. Wein was out of town and could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Several committee members said that they did not know that Wein worked for 
Brandman or that Brandman worked on the project. They also said Wein raised 
good questions and did not seem to support the project more than other members. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson said he was unaware of Wein's ties to Brandman or of Brandman's 
involvement in the project. Clarke, the Porter Ranch spokesman, said Wein was 
not directly involved in Brandman's work. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the committee's information came from the developer and from the city, 
both supporters of the project. 
</P>
<P>
City departments -- such as fire, and recreation and parks -- gave 
presentations at some committee meetings. But the panel did not hear from 
environmental agencies, such as the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District, according to several committee members. 
</P>
<P>
Although city planners staffed the meetings, the committee did not have 
independent technical or legal experts review the developer's plans and data. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, some panel members discussed whether to require Porter Ranch to make 
traffic improvements beyond those the developer thought justified, Kelly said. 
At the next meeting, he said, he was handed a legal opinion from the firm's 
lawyer contending that such improvements could not be required. The opinion was 
written by Daniel P. Garcia, who had recently resigned as president of the City 
Planning Commission and had become an attorney for Porter Ranch. Kelly said he 
felt "a little intimidated." 
</P>
<P>
The Porter Ranch project, to be built over 20 to 30 years, would be among the 
largest in Los Angeles history. It would house about 9,300 residents, employ 
27,000 workers, and include office buildings and a shopping mall the size of 
Northridge Fashion Center. 
</P>
<P>
Porter Ranch Development is a partnership of Liberty Building Co. and Shapell 
Industries, headed by Beverly Hills developer Nathan Shapell. He also chairs 
the Commission on State Government Organization and Economy, a government 
operations watchdog panel better known as the Little Hoover Commission, and is 
a big contributor to charitable causes, and state and local election campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported in March that Shapell Industries and other building and 
consulting firms and individuals connected with the project contributed 
$410,000 in campaign funds since 1982 to the mayor and members of the City 
Council, which ultimately will decide the project's fate. The largest council 
recipient was Bernson, who received $50,380 from them. 
</P>
<P>
Committee members said they do not believe that any member would benefit 
directly from the project. 
</P>
<P>
But most committee members believe that the project will raise property values 
and benefit business in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"More bodies is going to have to be more business for everyone," said member 
Paul Smith of Woodland Hills, who owns a liquor store at Tampa Avenue and 
Rinaldi Street, east of the project site. 
</P>
<P>
Gendernalik said the project would enhance local real estate values. "In terms 
of how it's laid out, how it's planned . . . it cannot help but do that," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gendernalik added: "I'm very excited about the work that the committee has 
produced, and I'm anxious to see it take form." No other large development has 
been planned "with as much forethought," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's anything like it in the city of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission could make a recommendation to the City Council on 
Thursday.

'BOILER ROOMS' PREY ON STAFF OF DISTANT FIRMS

The thieves took more than $600,000 from the Greeneville Sun before the 
Tennessee newspaper's publishers even noticed that it was gone. 
</P>
<P>
They were both sophisticated and greedy, and they got the newspaper's money 
without leaving the San Fernando Valley -- by using the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
The Sun was the victim of United Business Exchange, based in North Hollywood, a 
"boiler room" that authorities believe took more than $2 million a year from 
out-of-state businesses in a long-running telemarketing scam involving office 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
And United Business Exchange's take is only a drop in the bucket. In Southern 
California, which authorities call the boiler room capital of the United 
States, the Valley has become home base of the office-supply scam. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 Valley boiler rooms bilk hundreds of millions of dollars each 
year from businesses across the country, authorities estimate. 
</P>
<P>
These boiler rooms use slick, high-pressure sales tactics to persuade unwitting 
purchasing agents to buy supplies ranging from yellow legal pads to generic 
copy-machine toner at prices inflated as much as 1,000%. Often the products are 
never even delivered. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Unlimited Opportunity' 
</P>
<P>
"It is the valley of unlimited opportunity," said Assistant U.S. Atty. David 
Katz. 
</P>
<P>
Katz coordinates the San Fernando Valley Task Force, a team of investigators 
from several federal agencies who are attacking the boiler room problem. 
Established earlier this year, the task force has had some success -- its 
agents arrested the chief operators of United Business Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
But investigators concede that the task force is overwhelmed by the number of 
boiler rooms in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they do not know why Valley boiler rooms specialize in the 
office-supply scam, as opposed to other telemarketing frauds. But, they 
speculate, the area has lots of relatively inexpensive warehouse space, which 
those operating the scams need to store supplies. 
</P>
<P>
The average boiler room, authorities said, employs about 20 sales agents, but 
some have as many as 50. It is common for the salespeople to establish their 
own operations after they learn the ropes of the scam and develop their 
contacts, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Boiler room operators -- called "scammers" by authorities -- prey on the 
naivete of their victims and count on the odds. Business directories from 
cities all over the country provide a supply of potential marks, and the sales 
agents, cold-calling hundreds of businesses each day, regularly connect with 
victims, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Get Foot in Door' 
</P>
<P>
"They are going for the 2% of the calls where they can get their foot in the 
door," Katz said. "If they get in and can tap into a large pool of money, then 
they are off to the races." Using carefully prepared scripts, the salespeople 
initially attempt to sell a small quantity of marked-up supplies and usually 
try to turn the purchasing agents into willing collaborators by sending them 
small gifts or "premiums," investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Scammers, authorities said, hope that the purchasing agents will order larger 
and larger quantities of the exorbitantly overpriced copy toner, pens, papers 
and other supplies to continue receiving the premiums -- thinly disguised 
bribes that can range from TVs to trips to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
It is a process that investigators call "hooking the mooch." Once company 
insiders, or mooches, have accepted gifts, the scammers play on their greed to 
continue the scheme. Some mooches may even receive direct cash kickbacks. If 
the mooches hesitate after receiving initial gifts, they are threatened with 
exposure, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the buyer wants to balk, . . . the operator will say, 'Look here, how would 
you like your boss to know about the gifts that you are getting at home?' " 
said Larry Johnson, a federal postal inspector in Los Angeles who is assigned 
to the task force. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rewarding Trade-Off 
</P>
<P>
It is a lucrative trade-off for the boiler rooms. If a sales agent finds highly 
cooperative mooches, investigators said, the boiler room may not even send the 
office supplies. Checks to the boiler room from the victimized company and 
phony receipts and kickback checks to the mooch may be the only items going 
through the mail, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Such was the case with Edith Malone, a 28-year-old bookkeeper for the 
Greeneville Sun. Authorities said she enabled United Business Exchange to 
siphon more than $600,000 from the newspaper in 1985 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
According to authorities, she received $40,000 and numerous gifts from United 
Business Exchange while sending back company checks, sometimes for more than 
$100,000 a month. Few of the supplies that she purchased were delivered, 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Malone was caught when her superiors noticed the large cash shortages during an 
internal audit. Malone cooperated with an FBI investigation and later pleaded 
guilty to forgery. She was sentenced to five years in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
"We were hit quite a lick," said Gregg K. Jones, co-publisher of the newspaper. 
Although insurance covered most of the loss, he said, "it really set us back." 
</P>
<P>
Malone was described as a naive woman who left Greeneville County for the first 
time when she was sentenced to prison. She was a trusted employee who 
authorities believe was initially tricked into her initial order of supplies by 
high-pressure sales tactics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Received VCR, TV 
</P>
<P>
Later, authorities said, she willingly joined the scheme, receiving a 
telephone, a food processor, a VCR, two stereos and a television in addition to 
the $40,000 as kickbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"After three or four gifts, she was hooked," said Tom Dugan, another Los 
Angeles postal inspector on the task force. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the main operators of United Business Exchange, Laszlo Grabecz and 
Peter Tripp, both 41, were indicted in Greeneville on fraud charges, along with 
two sales managers, Richard Fonseca, 54, and his son, Christopher Fonseca, 25. 
</P>
<P>
When the suspects were arrested, they were operating a boiler room under a new 
name, Business Systems Exchange, in Sherman Oaks. They are scheduled to be 
arraigned this week in U.S. District Court in Greeneville. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the case shows how lucrative the boiler room business can be 
for its operators, particularly if a sales agent can develop a "mega-mooch." 
</P>
<P>
On the day the operators of United Business Exchange were arrested, Grabecz was 
driving a Bentley and Tripp was driving a Rolls-Royce, authorities said. Both 
lived in homes in the Mulholland Drive area. After their arrests, they put up 
$1 million in bail each and were released. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Valuable Resource 
</P>
<P>
Since "mega-mooches" are so valuable to boiler rooms, the operators may sell 
the information about cooperative mooches to other operations, Dugan said. 
</P>
<P>
An office manager at a Denver-based business management consulting firm became 
a mooch for National Industries of America, a boiler room based in Sherman 
Oaks. After she helped it filch $10,000 from her employer, she was contacted by 
seven other Valley-based office-supply boiler rooms, which either bought or 
were told information about her, Dugan said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman wound up helping the eight boiler rooms steal $100,000 from her 
employer before she disappeared in February, after being told that the office 
was scheduled for an internal audit. Presumably, she received about a 10% 
kickback on the orders she placed, said authorities, who are still 
investigating the eight boiler rooms. 
</P>
<P>
In past years, boiler rooms rarely hooked "big-money mooches," authorities 
said. But, Katz said, his investigators believe that the office-supply scammers 
are becoming more sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
"Six months ago, I would have said $100,000 was a mega-mooch case," he said. 
"Now I have two cases where there are $1-million mooches." 
</P>
<P>
But whereas cases involving mega-mooches draw the most attention, authorities 
said boiler room operations do not require inside operators to make a profit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Toner Phoner' Scam 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Levin-Epstein, office manager of a New York law firm, has become an 
expert in the small scam known as the "toner phoner." 
</P>
<P>
In July, just two months after he began work as the firm's office manager, he 
said he became a victim when he was called by a boiler room now under 
investigation by the Valley task force. 
</P>
<P>
Levin-Epstein said the caller told him that the price of toner for the firm's 
copy machine was about to increase and asked if he would like to place a final 
order at the old price. Levin-Epstein said he had never before ordered toner 
and ordered two cases, thinking that he was getting a deal. 
</P>
<P>
When the bill arrived, he was charged $916.55. If he had purchased the same 
toner from Xerox, the firm's legitimate supplier, the cost would have been 
$306, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They represented themselves as the authorized Xerox supplier, and me being new 
in the office and naive, I said, 'Fine,' " Levin-Epstein said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Part 
</P>
<P>
About a month after the first shipment, the telemarketing firm called 
Levin-Epstein again, and he was told that the second part of his order was 
being shipped, along with a color television he had won in a lottery of 
customers' names. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought maybe the second part of the order explained the inflated prices," 
he said. But shortly after the second shipment of four cases of toner arrived, 
so did a second bill -- this time for $1,785 -- and the TV. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the gift, Levin-Epstein wasn't hooked. He said he contacted Xerox and 
discovered that the company he had dealt with had misrepresented itself. He 
refused to pay the bill and contacted authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Like Levin-Epstein, many purchasing agents realize after several deliveries 
that they are being cheated and cease doing business with the boiler rooms. But 
the victims usually feel it is not worth their effort to try to recover their 
losses of $500 to $1,000 from boiler rooms hundreds or thousands of miles away 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say there are victims of Valley-based boiler rooms in every state 
but one -- California. Local telemarketing scammers scrupulously avoid calling 
businesses here because they know that a lack of in-state victims makes 
prosecution more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Since in-state victims are a rarity, Johnson said, state and local authorities 
have difficulty investigating boiler room operators -- which leaves the task to 
federal authorities such as the FBI, IRS and Postal Service. Those agencies 
have agents assigned to the Valley task force. 
</P>
<P>
The task force is involved in multiple investigations of boiler rooms. In 
addition to arresting the suspects in the Greeneville Sun case, its agents 
raided three other boiler rooms last month. Six other boiler rooms shut down 
this year after investigators confronted the operators with complaints. 
</P>
<P>
To help stem the tide of boiler rooms in the Valley, the task force routinely 
cooperates with local authorities in the victims' regions. The Greeneville Sun 
case is being handled by prosecutors in Tennessee, and another case, involving 
a North Hollywood man, is being prosecuted in Oklahoma County, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities there say John Hagey, an experienced boiler room sales agent trying 
to launch his own operation, offered 10-ounce silver bars to purchasing agents 
who ordered office supplies priced at about three times their market value. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Rogers, an assistant district attorney in Oklahoma County, said one of 
the people Hagey called with that offer was Gene Kelly, the county purchasing 
agent. With Rogers' permission, Kelly ordered supplies, received four bars of 
silver and tape-recorded his conversations with Hagey. 
</P>
<P>
Hagey is being prosecuted on charges of bribery and racketeering. He has 
pleaded not guilty.

LOYOLA STUDENTS, PRESIDENT MEET OVER BIAS PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the wake of a student protest against alleged racism at Loyola Marymount 
University, President James N. Loughran met Thursday with minority students who 
one week earlier had taken over his office. 
</P>
<P>
Although Loughran declined to comment Friday on his discussions with the 
students until he had issued a statement to the university community, he said 
Thursday's meeting was mostly to confirm agreements made after the student 
takeover last month. 
</P>
<P>
Loughran characterized both of his meetings with the students as "polite, civil 
and courteous." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Insensitivities' on Campus 
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued last week, Loughran acknowledged that insensitivity 
toward minorities is an issue on the campus. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt in my mind that there exist on our campus misunderstandings 
and insensitivities that need to be addressed," Loughran said in the statement. 
"I want to make recent events the beginning of that process." 
</P>
<P>
On April 27, five minority students arrived at Loughran's office in St. 
Robert's Hall at the end of the business day, demanding to discuss issues 
concerning minorities, including allegations of racism among administrators. 
</P>
<P>
The students were members of the Concerned Student Union, a group formed last 
fall to promote equality for minorities among the university's 3,773 
undergraduates, said President Hugh Lowe. 
</P>
<P>
During the nine-hour takeover, the students presented Loughran with a list of 
five demands, among them requests for a task force to investigate racism on 
campus and an increase in funding for minority student services, Lowe said. 
</P>
<P>
The group also requested the resignation of Lane Bove, vice president of 
student affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The students, who had met with Bove last fall, charged that she is particularly 
insensitive to minori ties, that minorities are underrepresented among students 
and faculty, and that a plan rumored to be under consideration by the student 
affairs office to merge minority student services with other offices would be 
unfair to minorities. 
</P>
<P>
But Loughran indicated in his statement that Bove would remain at Loyola and 
would be working with students to ease their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"At no point in the confrontation/conversation was asking for Lane Bove's 
resignation a possibility in my mind," Loughran's statement read. "Moreover, 
Lane Bove will obviously have to be a key player in resolving the issues before 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Loyola spokeswoman Rena Bloom said the university is considering a proposal to 
create the new position of an assistant vice president who would report to Bove 
and who would oversee the minority student services offices for Asians, blacks 
and Latinos. The offices of counseling, health and placement would also report 
to the new assistant vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Some minority students, however, feared that the move would merge all the 
departments and dilute the importance of minority student services. 
</P>
<P>
But university officials said the students' concerns were unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a plan to have minority support services report to counseling," 
Bloom said. "It is not a plan to merge them, and certainly it is not a plan to 
eliminate them." 
</P>
<P>
On the same day the group of five students met with Loughran, about 100 
students and faculty members attended a Mass and candlelight vigil to protest 
racism. At the vigil, some students and professors complained that there are 
not enough minorities on the faculty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recruitment Efforts 
</P>
<P>
But Loyola officials said the university has undertaken an increasingly 
assertive and successful campaign to recruit minority faculty and students. 
</P>
<P>
About 31% of Loyola's undergraduates are minorities, officials said. Of those, 
14.6% or 531 are Latino, 11.5% or 423 are Asian-American, and 4.8% or 174 are 
black, Bloom said. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, at USC, 30.5% of the school's 16,113 undergraduates are 
minorities, a school spokesman said. About 7.5% or 1,194 are Latino, 17.5% or 
2,792 are Asian-American and about 5.5% or 878 are black. 
</P>
<P>
At UCLA, which has an undergraduate population of 23,330, about 46.8% are 
minorities, according to spokesman Stuart Wolpert. About 15% or 3,500 are 
Latino, 19.4% or 4,525 are Asian-American, 7.3% or 1,705 are black, 4.2% or 980 
are Filipino, and 0.9% or 210 are American Indian students, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At Loyola, academic vice president Albert P. Koppes, who oversees minority 
recruitment, defended the school's efforts to recruit and retain minority 
students. 
</P>
<P>
"We have attempted to identify those students whose SATs are not truly 
indicative of their capabilities," Koppes said. "We have a special faculty 
committee which looks into applicants with good school records but low SATs." 
</P>
<P>
For the 1989-90 school year, Loyola accepted 25 of the 46 minority candidates 
in that category "who would otherwise have been rejected," Koppes said. 
</P>
<P>
On the Loyola faculty, the number of minorities has increased from 7% in 1983 
to 12% this year, Koppes said. 
</P>
<P>
Koppes said the school advertises faculty openings in higher education 
periodicals targeted to minority groups and that preference among comparable 
candidates for open faculty positions is given to members of minority groups 
and women. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Minorities in Faculty 
</P>
<P>
On the Loyola faculty, four of 19 tenure-track faculty members hired this year 
are minorities, which would bring the total number of minorities on the 
208-member faculty to 24 next year, or about 12%, Koppes said. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison UCLA has a similar number of minority faculty, about 12.2%, or 
225 minorities among its faculty of 1,847, spokesman Wolpert said. 
</P>
<P>
USC has 182 minorities on its 1,385-member faculty, or about 13%, a university 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Loughran said Friday that he was optimistic that his discussions with students 
would lead to improved relations between minority students and the 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
"We envision that a stronger university family will be the result," he said.

FELANDO SHELVES BILL DESIGNED TO HELP CONSUMERS

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with opposition from the Deukmejian Administration and food and 
agricultural groups, Assemblyman Gerald N. Felando (R-San Pedro) last week 
shelved for this year a sweeping consumer protection bill. The measure would 
have required grocery stores to post signs disclosing additives and antibiotics 
in meat, poultry, commercially raised fish, fruit and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
After a hearing by the Assembly Health Committee, Felando agreed to delay until 
next year a vote on his measure. In exchange, committee members agreed to hold 
further hearings on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Felando listed the bill among his top priorities two weeks ago when he returned 
to full-time legislative duties after radiation treatment for mycosis 
fungoides, a form of lymphoma that affects the skin and sometimes spreads to 
internal organs. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Felando told the committee: "The public has a right to be informed 
about what they are ingesting." 
</P>
<P>
But Don Beaver, president of the California Grocers Assn., labeled the bill 
"absolutely ludicrous," because it would be impossible for retailers to 
identify all the additives in food. The measure also was opposed by the state 
Department of Food and Agriculture.

Reckless bicyclists, skateboarders, and roller skaters be warned. 
</P>
<P>
The Hermosa Beach Police Department is cracking down on trick riding, group 
riding, and speeding along the strand and at the Hermosa Pier. 
</P>
<P>
"It's such a congested area, the bicyclists, the skateboarders, the roller 
skaters and the pedestrians all are vying for a few feet of the strand," Sgt. 
Wally Moore said. "We're now at the point where we have to do something." 
</P>
<P>
He said aggressive enforcement of the city's ordinances governing bicyclists, 
roller skaters and skateboarders will begin Monday in an effort to prevent 
injuries. Leaflets explaining the crackdown are being distributed this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, Moore said, a bicycle rider died after being thrown over the 
handlebars, and pedestrians have been injured. 
</P>
<P>
Police fear that skateboards shot into the air like arrows by stunt riders who 
fall off their boards could cause serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Violators will be issued citations similar to traffic tickets, and in extreme 
cases, police can confiscate the skateboard or bicycle, Moore said. Jeffrey L.

JOBS CONTROL SUPPLY OF HOUSING WITHIN THE ECONOMIC REACH OF BUYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By C. KEITH GREER, C. Keith Greer is vice president and general manager of 
Irvine Community Builders, a division of the Irvine Co. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During recent hearings examining affordable housing, an Irvine city 
councilwoman shared with the audience the fact that her daughter is living in a 
lovely apartment in Cleveland that costs only $400 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Why, she asked with more than a hint of frustration, is affordable housing not 
an issue in Cleveland while it has become one of the most difficult public 
policy issues at the top of local government agendas in Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
The succinct answer was provided by Claude Gruen, a nationally respected 
housing economist, who had been invited to Irvine to participate in a 
remarkably informative effort by the city to explore this issue. Gruen said 
that in Cleveland, there are more houses than jobs. Thus, the political 
hand-wringing there is over the depressed state of Cleveland's economy, which 
is not providing sufficient employment for those who need and want it. 
</P>
<P>
In Irvine and, for that matter, in most of Orange County, there are more jobs 
being created than houses. 
</P>
<P>
Gruen's conclusion: The imbalance between jobs and housing is the primary 
source of the problem. Any serious public policy effort to encourage affordable 
housing must begin with a commitment to keep job creation and housing 
production in balance. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, in Orange County, as well as in other dynamic and attractive 
areas with an appealing quality of life, the momentum to "do something" about 
affordable housing is running headlong into the resistance of policies that are 
discouraging new housing production. 
</P>
<P>
Is there any wonder, then, why "affordable housing" is now at the center stage 
of public policy discussion? The legislative debate no longer is whether 
"affordable housing" is desirable, necessary or important to maintain the 
diversity and economic vitality of our communities. On that point I see virtual 
unanimity. 
</P>
<P>
The tougher question for all of us -- including elected officials, taxpayers, 
business interests and, yes, developers -- is what practical, workable steps 
can be taken to make housing available to more than just the most affluent? 
And, more fundamentally: How much is needed? Who will create it? How much will 
it cost? And who pays? 
</P>
<P>
When you encounter the term "affordable housing" at City Hall, in newspaper 
editorials and in speeches, it is usually jargon for a government-initiated 
program to encourage construction of "subsidized shelter." 
</P>
<P>
When you encounter the term in a real estate office, in a family discussion or 
over coffee with a friend, "affordable housing" takes on a different meaning; 
namely, adequate shelter to match our desires and pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the Irvine Co. and the city of Irvine have created the most 
successful program in Orange County to deal with "subsidized shelter." More 
than 20% of the new housing units built in Irvine during the past 5 years have 
met an "affordability" test that provided subsidized shelter to families in 
need. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, the city- and county-sponsored low-interest financing that made 
the subsidized housing feasible has been depleted, and the prospects for new 
financing is dim. Thus, the city's goal of continuing to provide housing for 
all is in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine has been conducting a thorough public examination of how it can 
accomplish that ambitious goal in an era of declining state and federal 
subsidies, and at a time when the demand for housing to serve new economic 
growth is in direct conflict with pressure to build less housing, not more. 
It's a tall order. 
</P>
<P>
A parade of housing experts from around the state has offered advice, which 
generally can be summed up as follows: There are no easy or cheap answers; it 
will cost money, lots of it, and less money will be available from Washington 
or Sacramento. So, for housing to become a community priority, it will need to 
be supported politically and financially by the entire community. 
</P>
<P>
Money can come in many forms: Incentives and bonus densities for developers; 
fees on new development; a transfer tax on the sale of property; what remains 
of federal and state subsidies, or, most likely, all the above and other 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line: The amount of affordable housing built in Irvine, and other 
cities that want results, will have a direct relationship to the breadth and 
depth of support from the entire community. We must realistically assess what 
the cost will be. The last thing we need is to set unachievable goals that 
raise false expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"Affordable housing" progressively has become less and less available only in 
selective regions where the increase in jobs has outstripped the production of 
homes. This gap has produced the "affordable" crisis. 
</P>
<P>
To its credit, Irvine is approaching its housing problem in a systematic and 
sophisticated way, having now engaged a reputable outside consulting firm to 
estimate the cost and potential sources of support for a workable program. 
</P>
<P>
The goal is a General Plan Housing Element that is more than a statement of 
good intentions about providing shelter opportunities but a realistic vehicle 
that will bring about actual, measurable results. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who sat through the hours of testimony and advice to date is struck by 
the enormity and complexity of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Inescapably, the twin public policy goals -- providing "subsidized shelter" and 
effectively influencing the broader problem of "affordability" -- will be most 
effectively addressed when we make a renewed commitment to encouraging more 
housing of all kinds in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Relying on a balance of supply and demand will not entirely solve our housing 
problems, but it certainly will help. Take, for example, Irvine, which is 
creating far more jobs than housing. Virtually everyone is arguing that we 
should be encouraging closer proximity of jobs and housing to improve air 
quality, shorten commute trips and reduce traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
But the impartial Southern California Assn. of Governments estimates that 
Irvine needs to authorize 18,000 new housing units in the next 5 years to keep 
balance with anticipated job creation. The city has approved just 2,200 housing 
units. 
</P>
<P>
Where will these new Irvine job-holders find housing they can afford? What will 
their presence in a tight housing market do to on already sky-high prices? What 
happens to the economic growth and vitality of Orange County when living here 
is beyond the economic reach of most people who work here? 
</P>
<P>
These are the larger, long-term questions that must be addressed as Orange 
County struggles to provide affordable housing.

WETLAND SURVIVES, WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a ceremony Wednesday at Upper Newport Bay, the 752-acre ecological reserve 
was formally included as part of the California Wildlands Program, the first of 
its kind in the nation, according to state officials. It is one of only nine 
areas in the state and one of only three in Southern California to be included, 
which underscores the great value of the reserve and the importance of ensuring 
that it remains in its natural state, its environment protected. 
</P>
<P>
The bay property would now be a private marina had it not been for the vision 
of a handful of environmentalists about 25 years ago. They made the 
irreplaceable Upper Bay area one of the county's first battlegrounds against 
indiscriminate development, and they won. After 11 years of conflict and 
effort, the area was designated in 1975 as one of the largest reserves of its 
kind in the state -- a coastal wetland to remain in perpetuity as home to 
hundreds of species of birds, fish and mammals. 
</P>
<P>
The reserve is an oasis of natural beauty and serenity surrounded by the urban 
clatter and clutter of jet aircraft, autos, homes, hotels and commercial 
buildings. Guided tours are offered. It has become a popular place for 
naturalists, fishermen, bird watchers, hikers, joggers and people just seeking 
escape to the peace and quiet the Upper Bay still provides. 
</P>
<P>
Although access to the refuge is and will remain free, the state's new wild 
lands program is using the reserve's drawing power to generate revenue by 
charging people a fee for the guided nature walks and demonstrations provided 
by the state Department of Fish and Game. The money raised will be used to help 
cover the costs of preserving the Upper Bay's natural habitat and putting even 
more of its acreage into public reserve, goals that are well worth continued 
public support.

FUNDS FOR 'GENETIC FINGERPRINTING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a letter to the editor a few weeks ago, I voiced my concern about the 
apparent non-use of DNA "genetic fingerprinting" in Orange County. I asked if 
someone could tell me why it was not being used here. I assumed this would be 
just a rhetorical question. 
</P>
<P>
To my surprise, the next day I received a telephone call from Larry Ragle, 
director of forensic science in the county. He assured me that, indeed, genetic 
fingerprinting was very much in the forefront of the collective forensic minds 
here and that the obstacle is funding for equipment and analysts to handle the 
test results. He invited me to a Sheriff's Advisory Council reception for the 
business people of our community to hear more about it. What I learned about 
genetic fingerprinting was very interesting, but what I valued most was seeing 
the dedication of our law community officials to this cause. 
</P>
<P>
The benefits of this forensic tool would save Orange County taxpayers millions 
of dollars to say nothing of the absolute proof of guilt it could establish in 
court. I am appalled that today, with crime out of control and the courts 
inundated with cases, these officials must go to private citizens with hats in 
hand to solicit $200,000 that the county should be providing for this important 
work. I urge the Board of Supervisors to take another look at their priorities.

CAPISTRANO SCHOOLS MAY 9 BOND ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the past several weeks, a number of articles have appeared in newspapers 
regarding the $85-million school bond issue proposed by the Capistrano Unified 
School District, which is to be decided by voters at the special election 
scheduled for May 9. In these articles, as well as in comments made to various 
citizen groups, it appears that representatives of CUSD have attempted to 
deceive voters. 
</P>
<P>
As a case in point, statements have been made that senior citizens, age 62 and 
older, will be exempt from the annual property tax assessment. This is only 
partially true, since this exemption is not automatic; it is dependent upon 
each senior making a request for such exemption annually; unlike the homeowner 
property tax credit, which is requested once and remains in effect so long as 
the taxpayer owns that property, to avoid the school bond assessment a senior 
must request an exemption each year. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the San Clemente Citizens Growth Management Committee, an 
official of CUSD, when asked why this issue was not placed on the November 
ballot, thus avoiding the cost (more than $100,000) of a special election, he 
replied that CUSD felt that the measure would not have much chance of being 
approved on the November ballot. In essence, this official was saying that the 
only chance of passing this measure is to schedule a vote on it at a time when 
enough people who are opposed to it will not show up to vote. 
</P>
<P>
There is no question that CUSD needs more classrooms, given the pace of 
development in south Orange County. But the real issue is: Who has caused this 
need for more classrooms and who should pay for it? 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the people who have lived here for a considerable period of time 
have not caused the need; yet, under Measure A, these people will be paying for 
years to come. Obviously, the need for additional classrooms is caused by new 
development. 
</P>
<P>
The most equitable way to finance new school facilities is to incorporate a fee 
into the cost of the new homes whose residents are creating the need.

FETAL RIGHTS FOR DRUG, OTHER BABIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Drug Babies Push Issue of Fetal Rights" immediately caught my eye as I picked 
up my morning paper (April 25). Fetal rights for drug babies? I thought Roe vs. 
Wade guaranteed that no fetal rights -- including life -- could take precedence 
over the mother's rights, even her right to kill her unborn child deliberately 
through the agency of a doctor and a few tools. Why would inducing drug 
dependency in the unborn or subjecting her fetus to the dangerous side effects 
of her own drug abuse be considered worse than terminating the fetus' life? 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, your article didn't clear up the mystery for me. Too often I 
read articles on controversial issues whose authors think they're being 
objective because they give an equal number of column inches to each side. 
Rarely do I read an article whose author has probed behind the rhetoric to the 
root issues of the controversy. It's too bad this article counted inches rather 
than arguments. 
</P>
<P>
Why are third parties charged with crimes against fetuses but mothers aren't? 
Why can government agencies, including courts and social services, intervene in 
prenatal care but not in abortion? Why was Laura Moute (who was 7 months' 
pregnant and a cocaine user) wrong to want her unborn child to die from drug 
abuse when any California woman has the right (protected by state and federal 
courts) to terminate through abortion a pregnancy that is 7, 8 or even 9 months 
along? 
</P>
<P>
Could it be that, at least as far as the unborn are concerned, one's value is 
determined by whether or not one is wanted? What an idea! One's humanness 
increases with the number of people who care! How awe-inspiring to think that 
the Bon Jovis and Princess Dianas of this world are more human than I!

WHY DENY DEADHEADS ACCESS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I attended the Grateful Dead concerts Saturday and Sunday at Irvine Meadows and 
would like to commend the Irvine Meadows staff, the security staff and the 
Irvine Police Department. They did an excellent job of crowd control and 
traffic control and were at all times that I saw extremely courteous, helpful 
and professional. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper headlines Sunday implied a near-riot, property destruction and 
widespread drug use. By Tuesday, however, Irvine Assistant City Manager Paul 
Brady, the Irvine Police Department and Irvine Meadows management were stating 
that incidents were few and isolated, blown out of proportion and no worse than 
any other event, except for the traffic mess compounded by the air show. This 
was our experience: great shows by the Dead, great event management, a great, 
well-behaved crowd, with only a few "rowdies" who are not fans of the band. 
</P>
<P>
The Grateful Dead should be welcomed back to Irvine and should not be banned 
because of the actions of a few. Their annual shows add to our musical richness 
here in Orange County and generate considerable income to local businesses. 
What would make a difference would be much more responsible journalism -- knock 
off the sensationalist stories about the life styles of a few that insult those 
of us who are responsible, active members of the community.

CONSOLIDATION OF TRANSIT AGENCIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The subject of my letter is the consolidation of the Orange County 
transportation agencies. 
</P>
<P>
I'm a handicapped person who knows a lot about the Orange County Transit 
District and I get a lot of information on the transportation needs of Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
I ride the buses a lot, and I can tell you that the OCTD's bus and van service 
is increasing as much as the OCTD says. This fiscal year the ridership is up 
15%. The OCTD was predicting only a 3% increase. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Transportation Commission wants to take the OCTD and CTSA 
(Consolidated Transportation Service Agency) services over. The OCTD is doing a 
very good job. I do know that CTSA is trying to do a good job for the 
handicapped and the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
In the "Orange County 20-year Master Plan of Transportation Improvements" 
prepared for the Orange County Transportation Commission, there is nothing 
about bus or van service improvements, but there is evidence there will be a 
decrease in service in some part of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
OCTC's staff says "trust us" with the taxpayers' money. How come there is an 
investigation by the Orange County Grand Jury on the OCTC's staff deliberately 
overstated effectiveness of the car-pool lanes on the Costa Mesa Freeway? 
</P>
<P>
I think the Orange County Grand Jury should do a study on the cost of 
consolidation of the transportation agencies before the state Legislature votes 
for or against the proposed merger.

HELMETS CAN ALSO PROTECT BICYCLISTS FROM INJURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is in regard of the controversy over helmets being required for 
motorcyclists. There is much evidence that proves that the helmet can save the 
rider from serious injury. I am sure that people who ride motorcycles are well 
aware of the dangers and preventive measures. 
</P>
<P>
These riders that refuse to wear (helmets) want their freedom from the burden. 
It is obvious they do not mind if they fall and crack their head open. So why 
should we? 
</P>
<P>
There is really no point to press the issue forward if there is so much 
resistance. It does not make sense why someone would want to make such a big 
deal over it if they do not even ride bikes.

AUTHORITIES IDENTIFY MAN SLAIN BY DEPUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man shot to death by a sheriff's deputy after a traffic stop in Vista turned 
into a foot chase and a struggle has been identified as Junior Sylvester Clark, 
authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, 28, was shot in the torso about 4 a.m. Friday when he tried to choke 
Deputy William Anderson, said Lt. John Tenwolde. 
</P>
<P>
Coroner's deputy Chuck Bolton said Clark was a janitor, adding that it was not 
clear whether Clark lived in San Diego. His next-of-kin has been identified as 
his mother, who lives in Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson had stopped Clark in the 300 block of Hillside Terrace after 
suspecting he was intoxicated. Authorities said Clark ran from the car, 
Anderson gave chase and both ended up in a fight further down the street. After 
Clark began choking Anderson, the deputy fired one shot, hitting Clark, 
Tenwolde said.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NO ACTION ON LOW CAP SCORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials at West High School in Torrance have decided they will not try to 
identify the seniors who deliberately flunked this year's California Assessment 
Program test, saying it would be nearly impossible to track down every 
sabotaged test. 
</P>
<P>
Principal William Bawden said administrators had considered identifying the 
tests in order to recalculate the West High scores but decided Thursday that it 
would be difficult to accurately identify every test. 
</P>
<P>
"It would just be too hard to find all of them," Bawden said. "There were a few 
that were easy to identify, but there were some that were very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Bawden acknowledged that the decision was also influenced by media attention 
given to the school and the test. 
</P>
<P>
"We just felt like we needed to make a decision and get on with our lives," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
School officials disclosed last month that at least 18 seniors intentionally 
failed the test, which is used to gauge a school's academic performance. The 
students, part of a class of 400, were upset because they believe 
administrators place too much emphasis on the test, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Reading scores dropped from the 85th percentile statewide in 1987-88 to the 
51st percentile this year, while math scores fell from the 95th to the 71st 
percentile. Administrators blame the lower scores on the sabotaged tests. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators are concerned that the seniors' action may set a precedent for 
other schools in Torrance, Bawden said. However, he said he believes next 
year's class will not follow their example. 
</P>
<P>
"What I've heard from the junior class is that they disagree with what the 
seniors did and say, 'We would never do that,' " he said.

20 CUSTOMERS FLEE SALVATION ARMY OUTLET AS 4-ALARM FIRE DOES $400,000 DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A four-alarm fire Saturday morning at the Salvation Army Thrift Store at 6875 
El Cajon Blvd. caused $400,000 worth of damage but no injuries, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out in the clothing section of the store about 11 a.m. when the 
store was busy with about 20 shoppers, but people were able to escape safely, a 
Salvation Army spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
"The fire seemed to burst out and everybody saw it in time to get out," said 
Louise McKorn, stores supervisor for the Salvation Army. "There were quite a 
few shoppers . . . but no injuries." 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters responding to the call made an initial attack on the flames but 
were forced back because of the intensity of heat and smoke, a department 
spokesman said. Firefighters cut holes into the building's roof with chain saws 
to ventilate the heat and smoke but had to evacuate as flames began to burn 
through the roof. 
</P>
<P>
The fire -- which was spread by combustible material and upgraded to a 
four-alarm blaze when additional firefighters were called in -- was 
extinguished in about an hour. The blaze was blamed on discarded smoking 
material, firefighters said. 
</P>
<P>
"As I understand it, the Fire Department has condemned the building," said Ken 
Berquist, Salvation Army assistant residence manager. "The contents are a total 
loss, and very little of anything was saved." 
</P>
<P>
Berquist said revenue from the thrift store funded the Salvation Army's drug- 
and alcohol-rehabilitation service. 
</P>
<P>
Damage to the 5,000-square-foot building was estimated at $300,000 and damage 
to the contents was about $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heat Was Intense 
</P>
<P>
"The inside of the building really looks terrible. Even in an area where it was 
apparent the fire did not reach, the plastic hangers melted," McKorn said. 
"It's a tremendous loss to us because it's material that donors have been kind 
enough to donate to us." 
</P>
<P>
McKorn said that it will probably take several months before the store is 
reopened. Because the merchandise had been donated, it is not covered by 
insurance, she said. The nearest Salvation Army store is 10 miles away, on 
University Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of our nicest stores."

SUSPECT ARRESTED IN SHOOTING DEATH OF BAJA OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Baja California state judicial police officer was shot and killed in Tijuana 
on Friday by a suspect in a jewelry store robbery, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican authorities later arrested a suspect, Ramiro Cornejo Barreto, said 
Sergio Barrios, state police homicide investigator. The suspect is a Mexican 
citizen who was apparently residing in the United States, police said. He will 
be charged with murder and robbery, Barrios said. 
</P>
<P>
After the shooting, Mexican police were stationed south of the border in 
Tijuana, attempting to head off the suspect should he attempt to enter the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
The dead officer was identified as Manuel Soto Beltran Ruiz, 35, who had been a 
state police officer for seven years. Soto previously worked with the Tijuana 
police. 
</P>
<P>
The officer was shot three times with an automatic weapon about noon when he 
attempted to question a man sitting behind the wheel of a pickup truck on 
Tijuana's Avenida Lazaro Cardenas, Barrios said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Soto was investigating a robbery that occurred at 10:20 a.m. at the 
Mex-Suiza jewelry store, in downtown Tijuana.

YANKEES THINKING LIKE CONTENDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAIRE SMITH, Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yes, the New York Yankees have returned to form, trading away the future to 
benefit the present. But, hey, isn't the real story that the Yankees are once 
again even thinking about the present? 
</P>
<P>
The trading away of Al Leiter and the acquisition of Jesse Barfield might have 
seemed a frivolous, foolish maneuver three weeks ago. After all, the Yankees 
had started 1-7 and evoked only memories of the team's not-so-glorious past, 
doing a real scary imitation of the last-place 1966 Yankees in every aspect. 
</P>
<P>
That was three weeks ago. The Yankees still have a pitching staff that yields 
more than four runs a game and an offense that scores less than four runs a 
game. But that's OK. This team is a contender. They may have been only 12-12 in 
April, but that was good enough for a share of first place in the American 
League East. And that .500 April was more than enough to put the Yankees on the 
scent again. 
</P>
<P>
Crazy as it may seem, the team is gearing up. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we can compete and when you have a player (Barfield) of that caliber, 
you have to take a shot at it," Yankee Manager Dallas Green said last week. 
"I've said all along that this is going to be a dogfight division and if you 
hang around .500, you have a chance to win a dogfight." 
</P>
<P>
So, the Yankees are back to making those deals that serve only to bulk up the 
major leagues and make the purists crazy. "Any trade is a gamble," Green said. 
"And it's always a bigger gamble when the guy you're trading away has 
potential. But we've all seen guys with that word attached to them who never 
amounted to a hill of beans." 
</P>
<P>
So, amazingly, the Yankees are thinking like contenders. Are they playing like 
contenders? Well, that's all relative. 
</P>
<P>
They still have a gargantuan problem at third base, still are holding their 
collective breath to see if Alvaro Espinoza is the real thing at short, if 
Steve Sax could possibly be that good at second and if Roberto Kelly has really 
arrived as a threat in center. But the fact is, the positives are overshadowing 
the host of negatives now because the Yankees are in first place. The mere idea 
they survived, if not thrived, in April, that they never fell more than four 
games out, had to cause a re-assessment. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Yankees will say that they always felt they should be considered 
a contender, but the truth is, their thinking has changed because their 
surroundings changed. 
</P>
<P>
If the Yankees were cursed with a berth in the American League West, they'd be 
about six games back, chasing the finely tuned Texas Rangers and Oakland 
Athletics and still planning a hefty part of their tomorrows around Leiter. But 
the Yankees are not being buried. This time they've lucked out. They reside in 
the down-and-out American League East. 
</P>
<P>
The once-haughty division, is no longer reverently called "The Beast," but 
rather, pathetically called "The Least." So, the Yankees' 12-12 April looks 
like a bolt from the gate in comparison to the wretched start by the Blue Jays 
and mediocre Aprils by the banged-up Milwaukee Brewers and stumbling Boston Red 
Sox. That, more than anything, had to give the Yankees pause. 
</P>
<P>
If the division plays out the rest of 1989 the way it played April, it may take 
only 85 victories to win. The Yankees, in spite of the problems, have to figure 
they can do that. And they figure their chances of winning it all will be 
greatly enhanced by Barfield's presence. 
</P>
<P>
Barfield may not be Dave Winfield, but he was thought of highly enough last 
season to be considered in a straight-up deal for Winfield. Now, the comparison 
is moot because the Yankees don't have Winfield, haven't had him all year and 
may not get him back this season because of Winfield's back operation. 
</P>
<P>
This trade may well be criticized because of the Yankees' pursuit of the 
immediate fix, but the Yankees decided that they need the offense more than 
they need a wild left-handed starter with a load of potential. 
</P>
<P>
Barfield, who viewed the Yankees from afar, knows the need and believes he can 
meet it. "Without Winfield, it's been a different ballclub," he said. "Without 
the home runs, it's not the same. I think I can add to it. And, I think my 
defense (two Gold Gloves) speaks for itself." 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees hope to see immediate results. They also hope they do not get 
burned, that they have not acquired a player on a serious downslide. The 
numbers show Barfield has slipped from his 40-home run, 108-RBI season of 1986. 
Barfield says that slide was caused by a chronic injury to his left wrist, but 
he's healthy now. And even at half speed, he looks real good compared to what's 
been passing as the Yankees' long-ball threat. 
</P>
<P>
Barfield has five home runs. The Yankees have eight. Those numbers alone Green 
finds soothing. And don't tell the manager about declining numbers. "Leiter 
didn't have any numbers," he said bluntly. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Green and the rest of the Yankees hierarchy are braced for the history 
lesson, and no doubt will hear the honor roll of alums who were dealt away 
before they ever had a chance to blossom. But that's OK, Green said, because 
this time it is different. Really. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't go for a DH, bad-bodied, slow-running, quick-fix type of guy," Green 
said. "He's a player. He can DH, just like Don Mattingly can DH occasionally, 
just like Rickey (Henderson) can. But Jesse can help you in other ways besides 
hit home runs. Barfield is not 90 years old. He's 29 years old." 
</P>
<P>
That's certainly young enough for Barfield to be considered a part of the 
Yankees' future. But that's not really this team's concern. The Yankees will 
worry about the future only if and when it gets here.

ORIOLES HAVE FAITH IN CAL RIPKEN'S BAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Cal Ripken Jr. goes into a slump, no one in the Baltimore Orioles 
organization goes into a funk. 
</P>
<P>
When he goes on a tear, no one leaps into the air. 
</P>
<P>
That is called confidence in a professional, no matter which way the winds are 
blowing. 
</P>
<P>
Ripken has reached that status accorded players whose season-long numbers are 
almost taken for granted, a testimony to their proven worth. 
</P>
<P>
So it is at the moment with the Oriole shortstop, who entered Tuesday night's 
game with a .390 batting average in his last 15 games but with no home runs in 
nearly a month. 
</P>
<P>
Neither figure is eliciting much of a reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not concerned about the home runs," Manager Frank Robinson said. 
"They're just a matter of hitting under the ball another quarter of an inch. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing is that Cal is hitting the ball hard. The rest of it takes care 
of itself." 
</P>
<P>
Ripken is coming off a series in which he went 6 for 13 (.461) against Seattle 
and knocked in four runs in three games. He also had consecutive multi-hit 
games against the Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm driving and stinging the ball," he said. "If you consistently do that, the 
home runs will come. It's just the result of seeing the ball and hitting it 
hard with a good swing. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing to be worried about. I'd be more concerned if I was hitting 
home runs and not getting any other hits." 
</P>
<P>
Ripken said he felt no added pressure to go deep now that he had supplanted 
Eddie Murray as the team's cleanup hitter. 
</P>
<P>
"At times through 162 games, you get streaks when you hit home run after home 
run. And other times, you just don't," he said. "But I know if you have the 
ability to do it, somehow it will work out." 
</P>
<P>
As with Murray before him, Ripken has been a consistent power hitter, 
collecting between 23 and 28 homers in each of his seven full seasons. 
</P>
<P>
He is only the second shortstop (Ernie Banks is the other) to accomplish that 
feat. 
</P>
<P>
But last season, he hit only one in his final 33 games (including a string of 
29 straight without one) and, after hitting two in the first week this season 
(off Roger Clemens and Frank Viola), he has gone homerless since April 9. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy's track record speaks for itself," Orioles hitting coach Tom McCraw 
said. "He knows what he wants to do. Guys like him and Phil Bradley, you just 
give them the vehicle and they adjust and get ready. 
</P>
<P>
"Rip is hitting the ball hard. The home runs follow. Just pencil him in the 
lineup and don't worry about him." 
</P>
<P>
Ripken began the season with a new batting stance, then went back to the old 
version after going 4 for 36 (.111). 
</P>
<P>
Over the next 10 games, he batted .447 (17 for 38) and has remained hot. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to analyze about the stance," he said. "You can think too much 
and get all messed up."

OLSON NOT LETTING FAST START GO TO HIS HEAD 
</P>

Rookie Gregg Olson had three victories and two saves in his first 11 
appearances this year. But he still dwells on the negative. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish the good ones stayed with me as long as the bad ones do," Olson said. 
"I remember the bad ones a lot longer. I don't think that's all bad. I evaluate 
what I did wrong and I get something out of it. . . . The Seattle outing, the 
Minnesota outing, I wish I could put them away." 
</P>
<P>
This is how Olson looks at his fast start. He is quick to bring up his first 
appearance against Minnesota on April 7, when he gave up three runs on five 
hits, and his outing on April 28 in Seattle when he allowed two runs in 
one-third of an inning. 
</P>
<P>
Among his other first nine outings, in which he has pitched 17 2/3 innings and 
allowed seven hits and two runs (for a 1.02 ERA), are shrugged off. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be a fluke," he said with a laugh. " . . . I'm still looking over my 
shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
Olson, a right-hander who was pitching at Auburn University at this time last 
year, said he has always been this hard on himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I may not (succeed) my next time out. . . . I could hurt my arm. Who knows?" 
Olson said. "It's happened before to other guys . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old native of Omaha, Neb., knows his viewpoint is slightly askew, 
but adds he doesn't need any more advice on the subject. "Nobody could say 
anything now that I haven't heard before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles made Olson their No. 1 draft choice, and the fourth selection 
overall, last year. When he left the U.S. Olympic team to sign with the 
Orioles, Olson said he hoped to be in the majors by the end of the 1988 season. 
He made it, but not without a few struggles along the way. 
</P>
<P>
After eight appearances with the Orioles' Class A affiliate in Hagerstown, Md., 
Olson was promoted to the Class AA level, where he posted an 0-1 record with a 
5.84 ERA with one save. 
</P>
<P>
"I really struggled at Double-A," Olson said. "I tried to do the things that 
were successful for me in A-ball and in college, just throw it as hard as I 
can, and it didn't work. . . . I thought at times that I ha, and it didn't 
work. . . . I thought at times that I had reached my level." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the Orioles brought Olson up last September and he went 1-1 with a 
3.27 ERA in 10 appearances. 
</P>
<P>
In spring training prior to this season, Olson became the subject of much 
debate. Did he need more seasoning? Should he be a starter or reliever? The 
swirling questions were hard on the young pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"I struggled a lot with it in spring training," Olson said. "I'd look around 
and say, 'Those five guys are going to make it. It's down to the three of us.' 
Then somebody else would have a good outing. Everytime I had a bad outing I 
thought it was going to be held against me. . . . I thought it (making the 
Orioles) would come down to politics and I couldn't control that. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . Then there was talk about me starting. There were already seven 
starters there, so where did that leave me? . . . I didn't want to go back (to 
the minors). I'd much rather lose here than down there." 
</P>
<P>
Olson hasn't done any losing so far. He has shown off a highly touted curveball 
that has buckled the knees of hitters like Minnesota's Gary Gaetti and 
Oakland's Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
Although confident that he can get those kind of hitters out, Olson still has 
not allowed himself to expect it. 
</P>
<P>
FO Baltimore reliever Gregg Olson, 22, who made it to the major leagues in less 
than a season, is off to fast start in 1989. Here, he is congratulated by 
Manager Frank Robinson after a win.Associated Press

ANDERSON HAS STYLE, AND HIS OWN BLENDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sports Illustrated is researching a story on lead-off hitters, their role and 
importance to a team. It's a statistical rating, very technical. Three days 
ago, the highest-rated lead-off man in 1989 was Brady Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
That made Brady Anderson smile, although he probably already knew it. The 
lead-off hitter for the Baltimore Orioles usually knows what his batting 
average is, how many hits, steals, extra-base hits he has, how many reps he can 
do, how many vitamins he has left in his black bag and how many times a day he 
brushes his teeth. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I've got less plaque than any lead-off man," Anderson said, smiling. "I 
floss more than any lead-off man." 
</P>
<P>
Less plaque. More flossing. Exactly what goes through this guy's mind on a 
daily basis? 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles aren't quite sure, but they don't seem to be worrying about it now. 
Oh, he has only one bunt hit (they'd like to see more), and he didn't run out 
an infield pop-up on a recent night in Seattle, which resulted in Oriole 
Manager Frank Robinson yanking Anderson out of the game after he already had 
run to his position in center field. Otherwise, Anderson has done all the 
Orioles have asked of him. 
</P>
<P>
Through 24 games, he is batting .266, slugging .436 and has an on-base average 
of .367. He has 41 total bases, equaling Cal Ripken's total, second-best on the 
Orioles to Phil Bradley's 43. He leads the team with 12 extra-base hits and was 
tied for the league lead with nine doubles entering last night's games. He has 
not gone hitless in consecutive starts. 
</P>
<P>
His eight steals in April set a club record for the month. He leads the team in 
runs with 18. His headfirst slides and daring sprints from first to third base 
have sparked the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
To put a few things into perspective, consider that the Orioles had used seven 
different lead-off hitters -- including Fred Lynn and Tito Landrum -- through 
24 games last year. Those seven were hitting .219 with 11 runs, six steals, 
five extra-base hits and seven walks. 
</P>
<P>
To put into perspective how much better Anderson has done this year with the 
Orioles compared with last, when he batted 177 times for them, he already has 
more runs scored, doubles, triples, extra-base hits, steals and walks in 83 
fewer at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
No one is certain, however, why Anderson has played better. He still has an 
unorthodox stance and swing. He didn't play winter ball, and he didn't hit much 
during the winter because the net for his back-yard batting cage didn't arrive 
until the day he left for spring training. He spent the winter working out with 
decathletes and studying how to be more explosive as a runner rather than how 
to hit a hard slider. 
</P>
<P>
So far, it's working. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson is playing as he did in the minor leagues when he was considered a top 
prospect by the Boston Red Sox. He hit mostly third, not lead-off, in the minor 
leagues and was the Boston Red Sox's lead-off hitter Opening Day 1988. He went 
3 for 5 off the Detroit Tigers' Jack Morris that day but was back in the minor 
leagues by June 4. 
</P>
<P>
When he came to the Orioles in late July, his hamstring injury from spring 
training had curtailed his running game. Now, his speed is back and Anderson is 
making the Orioles offense go. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to run. I like going first to third," he said. "It's discouraging when 
you're not able to run. I never really knew how important it was to me until I 
got hurt last year." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said last year "wasn't a fun year," cringing at his .212 batting 
average -- .198 as an Oriole. That's gone, Anderson said, and this is the year 
he will shine. Mainly, he said, because he is healthy. 
</P>
<P>
This is a man who loves bodybuilding, who studies kinesiology even though he 
was an economics major at UC Irvine. Last weekend, he jokingly told Oriole 
trainer Richie Bancells the two should spend Monday's day off "doing squats for 
12 hours." Seriously, he said that last winter he sometimes would go to the UC 
Irvine track at 1 p.m. and not leave until 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a guy who learned how to run faster with proper technique. He said that 
he became faster when he "grew naturally." As a high school freshman, he was 
5-feet-2, 105 pounds. As a senior, he was 5-11, 140. As a junior at UC Irvine, 
he was 6-0, 168. After his first season as a professional, 1985, he was 6-1, 
182. 
</P>
<P>
He's no pesky lead-off hitter. 
</P>
<P>
He is a strong man. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 6-1, 190, but not many people know I'm that big," said Anderson. "I'm not 
sure why. I matured late. I grew a couple inches when I was 21." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Anderson was quiet and removed from the rest of the team. He would 
carry around that mysterious black bag -- it looks like a doctor's bag -- 
filled with health foods, supplements and a small blender to mix his 
health-food drinks. He isn't one who dives into the post-game spread of burgers 
and fries. 
</P>
<P>
Although his teammates wonder about a guy who carries around a blender, 
Anderson is more open with them this year. Indeed, he's a pretty funny guy. 
</P>
<P>
After Bob Milacki faced the minimum 27 hitters April 23, Anderson, who had one 
putout, said, "I was bored. I didn't even have my glove on out there." 
</P>
<P>
Someone asked him about his increase in stolen bases, and Anderson said that he 
read a book on base stealing written by Ernie Lombardi. He was kidding. 
Lombardi, a Hall of Fame catcher, moved slightly faster than a glacier. 
</P>
<P>
In the Red Sox media guide last year, Anderson listed his top thrill in 
baseball as "seeing a groundskeeper in Mexico accidentally light himself on 
fire three times." 
</P>
<P>
On the day Rickey Henderson broke Bobby Bonds' record for homers leading off 
the first inning (36), Anderson was asked how many first-inning, lead-off 
homers he has hit. He said, "Counting the one yesterday . . . none." 
</P>
<P>
He was not happy when Robinson pulled him off the field Saturday night, but 
when he said it was forgotten "two minutes later," it seemed credible. He said 
of the play, "I was jammed on the pitch. I was reliving the at-bat. I couldn't 
do that in a full sprint to first." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson clearly has his own way of doing things. That still seems to concern 
Robinson, however slightly. Last year, Robinson said that he wasn't sure if 
what he told Anderson about the game was getting through.

At 52, Bobby Beathard and the Washington Redskins are the same age. This is 
significant, because the unassuming genius suddenly calling it a career here 
has had more impact on the Redskins than anyone since the fellow who brought 
them here. 
</P>
<P>
George Preston Marshall gave the Redskins life in Washington, 20 days after 
Beathard was born. Sonny Jurgensen gave them style. Vince Lombardi gave them 
credibility. Sammy Baugh gave them all-around excellence that never has been -- 
and may never be -- equaled. 
</P>
<P>
George Allen in 1972 took the Redskins to a plateau, the National Football 
League title game, unscaled in 27 years. Beathard in the 1980s got them there 
three times -- and to the absolute peak twice. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Gibbs was the coach of those two Super Bowl champs. Beathard hired Gibbs -- 
and provided the players Allen had not left behind after his own hasty 
departure in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Although Jack Kent Cooke gave Beathard the thickest wad of money with which to 
operate in the NFL, he did not hire him. Proving his own brilliance, Cooke 
trusted Beathard's judgment on Gibbs and lesser matters. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps if Cooke or Gibbs or a chorus of Redskin fans had whispered that 
lately, Beathard might have stayed. Confident to the point of being offensive 
in his area of near-unique expertise, Beathard also seems to need ego-stroking 
in a way the owner and coach either could not -- or would not -- do this time. 
</P>
<P>
Lots of us snapped to attention when stories of Beathard's dissatisfaction and 
possible departure started to surface a few weeks ago. Then we remembered 
similar flurries when his contract was being negotiated other times during his 
11 years with the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
Smugly, we chuckled: Bobby's crying wolf again. Or Chargers. Why would he jog 
away from the most free spending and creative owner in the league? And a coach 
second only to Beathard's previous boss, Don Shula, after Tom Landry was 
blind-sided off the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Most likely, the seesaw of power Beathard and Gibbs supposedly have balanced 
since 1981 had tilted inexorably the coach's way. Even the strongest general 
managers usually lose to successful and charismatic coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Conflict between strong-willed general managers and coaches is almost 
unavoidable. Loyalty is mainly why. Any coach who wins as grandly as Gibbs has 
over a period of time develops knot-tight ties, to a style of play and to 
players heroic in ways often obvious only to him. 
</P>
<P>
The general manager must be more restless and daring, for he literally scouts 
the future. Youth and promise excite him. And when a Beathard sees one of his 
young and scar-free behemoths losing a roster battle to some graying and 
stitched geezer, he frequently cries: "You've got to be kidding!" 
</P>
<P>
Beathard very likely never had so much fun, in a pure-scouting sense, as during 
the player strike two years ago. Seat-of-the-pants football is what it was. 
Only teams with the smartest management, backed by lots of money, survived. 
</P>
<P>
The replacement team Beathard assembled and Gibbs taught was unbeaten in three 
games -- and helped vault the regular team into the playoffs and that Super 
Bowl rout. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Beathard also needs some time to determine priorities, a football 
sabbatical. After a naturally restless man has put teams together in about 
every way possible, some recharging may be in order. 
</P>
<P>
If Beathard does stay away a while, this will have been a whopper of a 
leave-taking time in the NFL. The architects of five Super Bowl winners in the 
1980s, Bill Walsh and Beathard, stepping aside; the founders and caretakers of 
America's Team, Tom and Tex and Gil, cast aside by a grindstone Cowboy. For 
Pete's sake, even Rozelle is gone. 
</P>
<P>
The good work Beathard and his men do is done mostly alone and is always 
tiring. They travel thousands of miles, eat dozens of lousy meals and overturn 
hundreds of fool's-gold players to mine one genuine gem. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard's stage has been a portable podium at Redskin Park on draft day, when 
he tests his courage and wits and bedazzles lots of the league. Routinely, he 
will trade a future No. 1 draft choice to select a Russ Grimm in the third 
round (1981), or fare far better in later rounds than he does in the second. 
</P>
<P>
When George Allen left the Redskins, Washingtonians assumed they would never 
see such a trade-mad man again. Beathard succeeded him -- and proceeded to open 
an even more bustling swap shop. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Allen prided himself on struggling through a couple of miles after 
practice on a track he had specially built inside Redskin Park. The much 
younger Beathard clips off eight to 12 miles daily and competes in marathons. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard won a power struggle with coach Jack Pardee in 1980, then was 
responsible for building and overseeing a team second only to the 49ers for 
Super Bowl success the next nine years.

SABATINI FAVORITE AT ROME

ROME 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steffi Graf stayed home. Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert dropped out. But 
the way Gabriela Sabatini has been playing it might not have made a difference. 
</P>
<P>
The dark-haired Argentine with an Italian surname will be the crowd favorite at 
the Italian Open when it begins Monday and she'll also be favored to win. 
</P>
<P>
The defending champ and 1987 runnerup is ranked third in the world and is 
poised to move up in a year in which she has already beaten No.1 Graf, No. 2 
Navratilova and No. 4 Evert. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini, who turns 19 this month, has a game perfectly suited for the slow red 
clay courts although she has been working on her net game and especially her 
service. 
</P>
<P>
With the field at the top thinned, the tournament shapes up as a battle in the 
56-player drawer among such athletes as Manuela Maleeva of Bulgaria, Stephanie 
Rehe of the United States, Canada's Kelesi and Arantxa Sanchez of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Graf skipped the event for the second year in a row in favor of her native 
German Open the week after the Italian Open. Navratilova has said she'll skip 
all European clay court tournaments this year. And Evert, who for some time has 
hinted at retirement, says she has been playing too much and feels exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
One player to watch at Rome is Monica Seles, a 15-year-old Yugoslav 
left-hander, who won her first professional tournament last weekend, upsetting 
Evert in the Virginia Slims of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Seles has been trained in Florida by Nick Bollettieri and features a two-fisted 
backhand. The victory was expected to boost her into the top 20. 
</P>
<P>
"Seles has the possibility of really aiming high both because of her technical 
and competitive qualities as well as her spirited personality, which helps in 
tennis," said Rino Tommasi in the Italian sports daily La Gazzetta dello Sport. 
</P>
<P>
The men's event opens May 15, the day after the women's final, and will be 
missing the defending champion and world's No. 1 player, Ivan Lendl, who last 
year complained bitterly about the crowd's behavior, the weight of the balls 
and the pollen in the spring Rome air. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Wilander of Sweden and Americans Agassi and McEnroe, the 
64-player drawer includes Kent Carlsson, American veteran Jimmy Connors 
returning to Rome after a long absence, Yannick Noah of France and Miloslav 
Mecir of Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Like the women's event, the men's championship features an emerging star, 
hard-hitting Alberto Mancini of Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old is coming off a dazzling performance at Monte Carlo, where he 
beat Wilander and Boris Becker of West Germany on consecutive days to win the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Mancini, in Argentine style, prefers to stay back but scores points with his 
topspin and remarkably quick backhand. 
</P>
<P>
He was ranked No. 31 before Monte Carlo and is now expected to jump up in the 
rankings.

BASEBALL CARD FAD IS GROWING IN A MINOR WAY

<P>
New York Mets infielder Gregg Jefferies may be starting the season slowly on 
the field, but the rookie's minor league baseball card is a hit among 
collectors. 
</P>
<P>
His 1986 Columbia (S.C.) Mets card is selling for $70. Not bad, considering a 
set of the entire team could have been bought for $3.95 two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The card is not unique. Chicago Cubs' Mark Grace's 1987 Pittsfield (Mass.) Cubs 
card and Philadelphia's Ricky Jordan's 1986 Reading Phillies card go for $27 
each. A 1986 Omaha Royals' card of David Cone -- a Mets' pitcher -- goes for 
$16. 
</P>
<P>
Minor league cards are a big hit, and a printing company in suburban 
Philadelphia is considered the main reason. 
</P>
<P>
The owners of ProCards, Inc., started small -- producing a set of cards for the 
Reading team in 1985. "The fans loved them. The players loved them," said Jan 
Marcus, head of the team's marketing. 
</P>
<P>
ProCards owners -- Jeff Rogovin and Jon Metzger -- then went to baseball's 
meetings the following winter, hoping to sign 30 to 35 teams. Instead, 88 teams 
wanted sets. After a boom of 102 teams in 1988, the company this year is 
producing cards for 77 teams, including all 26 Triple-A teams, 16 of 26 
double-AA teams and 23 single-A. There are about 150 minor league teams in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"The teams give them away on promotion nights and sell them from the souvenir 
stands," said Rogovin. 
</P>
<P>
The players enjoy the cards as much as the fans. 
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, "We've only had one or two players refuse to pose," 
Rogovin said. "Its amazing. The players will be at practice all day in the hot 
sun, but they're willing to stand in line to get on a baseball card." 
</P>
<P>
Only a handful of players have refused to pose, "and they've called back later 
to see if there was any way to get one," Rogovin said. "But by then they are 
out of luck." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike major league cards -- which are printed in the fall and begin appearing 
on stands after the beginning of each year -- the minor league cards are 
printed at the beginning of the season, after spring trainin begins. 
</P>
<P>
"That way, we get up to the minute team rosters," Rogovin said. "We've even had 
guys traded at the beginning of the spring on both teams' cards." 
</P>
<P>
ProCards also receives a player's current stats from Boston-based Howe Sports 
Data International, the official statisticians of the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Huston, publisher of the Minor League Monthly Price Guide, said the stats 
are a major reason ProCards stand out from the cards produced by four other, 
smaller firms. 
</P>
<P>
"Their stats go back the furthest, while some of the others only use the last 
two years," Ms. Huston said. 
</P>
<P>
The stats are important because most collectors guess which players will move 
into the major leagues, thereby increasing the value of their minor league 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike major league card collecting -- where complete team sets are important 
-- minor league card collecting focuses on individual players. "You have to dig 
a little bit more to find cards that may turn out to be blue-chip investments," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Irv Goldblatt, a Philadelphia card collector known as "the baseball man," 
agreed. "There usually is only regional interest in a team. Only the fans in a 
minor league city want the set." 
</P>
<P>
Only cards of stars like Jefferies sell well, Goldblatt said, "but even that's 
a limited market." 
</P>
<P>
Limited because ProCards produces only a certain amount of cards per team. The 
number produced overall -- about 20 million -- sounds enormous, but that's 
fewer than 9,000 cards per player. And the 20 million seems tiny compared to 
the major league card producers such as Topps, Inc. Topps spokesman Kenneth 
Liss said "well over a billion cards" are produced each year. 
</P>
<P>
Ms. Huston's guide indicates interest in minor league cards has been growing. 
She began the North Lima, Ohio-based guide in Nov. 1988, producing 3,000 
copies. Currently, she sells about 5,000 each month. There have been 
minorleague cards of some sort almost since the beginning of organized 
baseball, but collecting had almost died out before ProCards jumped into the 
market. "This is the heyday of collecting," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, neither Rogovin or Metzger are avid collectors. Metzger's mother 
threw his collection out years ago, and he now collects sparingly. 
</P>
<P>
Rogovin collects only items connected with his cousin, Saul Rogovin, a 
journeyman pitcher who posted a 48-48 record back in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the two branched out of minor league baseball cards and into minor 
league hockey cards. 
</P>
<P>
They approached the local American Hockey League club, the Hershey Bears. "We 
looked into it," said Doug Wingst, a Bears spokesman, "And decided they would 
be good publicity." 
</P>
<P>
With the Bears' help, the other 13 AHL teams and five International hockey 
League teams signed up for the season. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been received tremendously," Wingst said. 
</P>
<P>
Are major league plans in ProCards' future? Rogovin declined to comment, but 
Metzger said, "I wouldn't rule that out."

FOR A LACROSSE GOALIE, LIFE IN THE NET IS TOUGH

<TEXT>
<P>
Gary Gait emerges from a throng of players at midfield after the opening 
faceoff and heads down the center of the field toward the Cornell goal, where 
All-American goalie Paul Schimoler waits. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gary's twin brother, Paul, scampers down the right side, twirling 
his lacrosse stick as though he has the ball. In the dimly lit Carrier Dome, 
Schimoler is fooled. While he intently watches Paul Gait's every move, a huge 
grin creeps across Gary's face as he unleashes a blistering, 35-yard shot that 
whizzes past Schimoler's ear and into the net just 13 seconds into the game. 
</P>
<P>
Schimoler never even sees it. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the world of the college lacrosse goalie. You think a hockey goalie 
has it tough? 
</P>
<P>
Try guarding a cage that measures a gaping 6 feet by 6 feet, with no bodily 
protection save a caged helmet, a throat protector and a chest protector 
thinner than a baseball catcher's, gloves, and an oversized stick. Never mind 
that most shots originate within 8 to 14 yards of the goal, and that the 5 
1/2-ounce hard rubber ball doesn't exactly tickle when it hits bare skin. 
</P>
<P>
It may just be the toughest, most unrewarding position in team sports. 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought hockey goalies had to be a little left of center to get in 
there and face a hockey puck," Hobart coach Dave Urick said. "Granted, that 
puck can still hurt, but a hockey goalie is pretty well protected. Lacrosse 
goalies are facing a similar object in terms of velocity, but they're 
protecting a much bigger area with a lot less protection." 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about a situation where they're throwing the ball 85 miles an 
hour," added Richie Moran, who's coached Cornell lacrosse for the past 21 
years. "How would you like to have a guy throwing the ball at you being a foot 
away or two feet away with that velocity?" 
</P>
<P>
So just who wants the job? 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose it requires somewhat of a different mental approach," says former 
Hobart netminder Guy Van Arsdale, who now coaches at Rochester Institute of 
Technology. "I think that for a long time goalies in all sports have been 
thought of as being flakes or nuts or crazy. But I used to think I was a heck 
of a lot more sane than those other guys who ran around outside the crease and 
had people beat on them with sticks. At least nobody could beat on me with a 
stick." 
</P>
<P>
Spoken like a true goalie. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very gratifying," says senior goalie Rich Barnes of Division III Cortland 
State who, along with two teammates, allowed a not-so-gratifying 26 goals last 
year in a game against Syracuse, which went on to win the Division I title. 
"But it's frustrating. You've just got to get the mind-set that you're not 
going to stop everything. A goal scored is a goal forgotten. It's very hard (to 
come to that realization). This is my last year in college, but I still have 
trouble. It drives you nuts!" 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy it," claims Schimoler, who faced 58 shots in that game against 
Syracuse in mid-April and allowed 20 goals. "I enjoy coming out of the cage and 
being active. I just don't save the ball, I like to be part of the offense as 
well. You can score if you want." 
</P>
<P>
Really? How many goals have you scored, Paul? 
</P>
<P>
"None." 
</P>
<P>
Rich? 
</P>
<P>
"None." 
</P>
<P>
Anybody? Unfortunately, the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association 
lists goals, but not by position. Suffice it to say, however, that it doesn't 
happen a whole lot because for a goalie to join the offense requires an 
attacker to stay back and tend goal. Enough said? 
</P>
<P>
As for injuries, amazingly, they're usually just bumps and bruises. Sure, 
there's the occasional mishap that leaves the crowd buzzing. Like when Hobart's 
Dave Creighton suffered a black eye when a shot went through his mask in the 
1972 North-South game. Or when Van Arsdale caught one on the thigh against 
Syracuse in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a native American named Greg Tarbell whose shot was clocked at well 
over 100 miles an hour," Van Arsdale said. "The whole leg went dead. The next 
day the leg was black and blue from about just above the knee to almost the 
groin, and all the way around the whole leg except for about a four-inch strip 
of white skin." 
</P>
<P>
"In the game you don't feel anything," says Syracuse netminder Matt Palumb. 
"But about two hours later you're sitting around and all of a sudden you get up 
and boy, that hurts, and this hurts, and everything else hurts. Sometimes you 
have to take a look at yourself and wonder (why you're a goalie)." 
</P>
<P>
There's more bad news. In lacrosse, unlike in hockey, it's possible for a team 
to lose six players at once to the penalty box. That never happens, but teams 
frequently lose two players simultaneously. Imagine that power play. 
</P>
<P>
And. 
</P>
<P>
"There are times when you have to turn your back to the shooters because the 
ball can go behind the goal," Urick said. "The goalie has to turn his back to 
the cage sometime. In hockey the goalie doesn't do that -- he kind of turns his 
shoulder. But there's such a big area behind the goal you've got to learn to 
play a feed and then re-focus on the shooter real quick. That makes it very, 
very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
So do the shooters, whose plastic sticks are incredibly accurate. Goalies are 
seeing more shots from a greater variety of angles. And, of course, players can 
shoot either right- or left-handed. 
</P>
<P>
And never mind the goalie. What about the poor coach? What do you say to 
Schimoler after he allows 20 goals? "Way to go, Paul. Hell of a game. You made 
some incredible saves." 
</P>
<P>
He sure did among his 21 stops. But he also let in 20, got humiliated on the 
game's first shot, and probably wished he'd stayed in bed. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to be a certain type of person, and goalies are a certain breed," 
says Gary Gait, who last year scored an NCAA record 70 goals -- in 15 games. 
"They've always got a funny character about them. They get a hundred balls shot 
at them -- it takes a certain type of person, there's no doubt. 
</P>
<P>
"Crazy!" he said, laughing.

CSUN TRACK MEET GETS RECORD TURNOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the championship track and field meets just around the corner, Coach Don 
Strametz of Cal State Northridge said it was imperative that the Matadors take 
advantage of Saturday's Northridge Open to qualify more athletes for the NCAA 
Division II championships. 
</P>
<P>
Because scoring points will take precedence over producing good marks in the 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. championships at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo 
next week, Strametz reasoned that the meet at CSUN was an ideal place to post a 
qualifying mark. 
</P>
<P>
His hunch was right as two Northridge athletes broke stadium records and 
another three qualified for the Division II meet in Hampton, Va., May 24-27. 
</P>
<P>
Juniors Darcy Arreola and Lolita Pile led the way, setting stadium records in 
the women's 1,500 meters and triple jump, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Arreola won her race in 4 minutes, 16.55 seconds, and Pile produced the longest 
effort of her career to win the triple jump in a wind-aided 42 feet, 1 1/4 
inches. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, sophomore Sean Rapp, freshman Garrett Noel and junior Gena 
Jauregui all set personal bests to qualify for the national championships. 
</P>
<P>
Rapp won the B section of the pole vault with a personal best of 16-3 1/2, Noel 
placed second in the javelin with a school freshman record of 209-7 and 
Jauregui placed sixth in the women's 1,500 in 4:29.68. 
</P>
<P>
With a lap to go in the 1,500, Arreola appeared to be on the verge of 
destroying her personal best (4:15.35 in 1987), but she slowed over the final 
200 meters and had to settle for the third-fastest time of her career. 
</P>
<P>
Arreola, the defending Division II champion in the 1,500 and 3,000, trailed 
Leslie Noll of USC for the first 880 yards (2:15.0), before taking control of 
the race with 600 meters left. After running 3:05 for the first 1,100 meters, 
Arreola needed a modest last lap of 70.3 seconds to lower her lifetime best, 
but the final 400 took her 71.5. 
</P>
<P>
In other events, Mike McGee of Northridge won the 400 intermediate hurdles in 
53.19 and freshman teammate Sasha Vujic placed third in the men's 1,500 with a 
personal best of 3:53.73.

The Regals had only one hit through four innings against Azusa Pacific when Cal 
Lutheran Coach Wendy Olson -- Beckemeyer decided that it was time for a quick 
lesson. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't taking advantage of the first pitch today," Olson -- Beckemeyer 
said. "The first pitch to every batter was right down the middle for a strike 
and the girls were just taking the pitch, so I told them to be aggressive 
first-ball hitters." 
</P>
<P>
The lesson was well-taken. Cal Lutheran pounded out four hits -- three on first 
pitches -- in the bottom of the fifth to take a two-run lead en route to a 4-1 
victory at home and its second consecutive district championship. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been walked the last eight times that I batted so I was real hungry to 
get some hits today, " said Danielle Piotrowski, whose two-run double on a 
first pitch highlighted the fifth-inning rally. "It just took one person to get 
a hit and that got us started." 
</P>
<P>
Azusa Pacific (16-18) scored its run in the second inning when CLU starting 
pitcher Leslie Stevens walked Kim Young with the bases loaded. The Lady Cougars 
held onto the slim lead until the fifth when the CLU batters began to take 
advantage of Dana Swingrover's perfect first pitches. 
</P>
<P>
DeeAndra Pilkington came in from center field to pitch three stellar innings of 
relief. Pilkington, normally a starter, gave up one hit and struck out three in 
improving her record to 17-4. 
</P>
<P>
Olson -- Beckemeyer told Pilkington, who had only one previous relief 
appearance, to be ready if needed. "I wanted DeeAndra to keep warmed up between 
innings in the outfield because I wanted to bring her in as an intimidation 
factor since Azusa has never beaten her this year," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Piotrowski went three for three with a triple, double and three runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran (33-16) will play host to Mesa College of Grand Junction, Colo., 
in a three-game regional series Friday and Saturday. The winner will advance to 
the NAIA championships in Midland, Mich., May 18-20. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be a great challenge for us, but if we play together like a team 
like we have been doing, we can beat them," Pilkington said.

SERVICE BREAK;

<P>
AFTER A LEAVE OF ABSENCE VAN NUYS' SHANNON GORDON RETURNS TO TEACH TENNIS AND 
DOMINATE LOCAL EVENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHANNON GORDON , Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Christmas morning surprises go, this one doesn't exactly rank up there with 
finding bulging stockings over your fireplace or sled marks on your roof. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Shannon Gordon found herself in a cast after leaving skid marks on the 
sidewalk near her parents' Van Nuys home, the result of a freak roller-skating 
accident. One minute Gordon was sailing down the street on a shiny pair of 
skates. The next, she was staring at a broken right foot and perhaps the end of 
a promising tennis career. 
</P>
<P>
The competitive part of that career had begun at age 13 and had blossomed at 
Grant High in Van Nuys. There, Gordon had reached the City singles final as a 
junior. The following year, she moved from the girls' to the boys' team, 
seeking tougher competition. She thrived on it, working her way onto Grant's 
No. 1 doubles unit and, by season's end, the All-City team. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon went from there to UCLA, where she made the squad as a walk-on and 
became a two-time All-American, playing No. 1 doubles and anywhere from No. 4 
to No. 6 singles. In 1979, she was named Outstanding Women's Athlete for 
Tennis. 
</P>
<P>
"It was tough when I first got there," Gordon said. "Almost everyone else was 
recruited. They all had scholarships and some were nationally ranked. I had 
never even played in a national tournament." 
</P>
<P>
There is tough, and then there is tough. 
</P>
<P>
Upon leaving school, Gordon took a swing at the pro tour. Having barely 
qualified for a tournament in Tucson, where she lasted a couple of rounds, 
Gordon felt that her game was peaking when it came time for a holiday break. 
</P>
<P>
The break she got, however, was nearly disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
It was Christmas, 1980, when Gordon took her fateful roller-skating run. She 
sat out most of the following year but recovered completely and hit the pro 
tour in earnest in 1982. For the next two years, she toured the world, playing 
everywhere from Africa to South America to the Orient. She made enough money to 
break even and also cracked the top 200 in the world rankings. She even won 
several doubles events. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I would have done better if I had had my own coach," Gordon said. 
"Without that, it's a pretty hard grind. It can be pretty lonely out there. You 
have friends but, the next day, you might be competing out there against them 
for financial survival." 
</P>
<P>
After two years of struggling to survive, Gordon came home. 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't do as well as I had wanted to," she said. "I probably should 
have given it another year. They say you should give it three years, but I was 
looking for some stability in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon went back to school and another love -- basketball. She enrolled at 
Valley College and became the school's starting point guard. 
</P>
<P>
But tennis remained her primary passion. She began to teach it and today, at 
31, is a full-time instructor with about 30 students. She teaches at the 
MountainGate Country Club, various private courts and in her parents' Van Nuys 
back yard, where her father has built a court. 
</P>
<P>
She also has returned to competitive tennis, playing in area tournaments in 
both the open division and one for women aged 30 to 35. In the age division, 
Gordon has won 22 of 23 matches and six of seven tournaments, including the 
recent Southern California Sectional Championships in Universal City. Last 
June, in a tournament in Griffith Park, she played in both the open and women's 
30 divisions and won both. 
</P>
<P>
She is currently ranked No. 1 in women's 30-35 division and No. 7 in the open 
division by the Southern California Tennis Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard sometimes to mix teaching and playing competitively," she said. "I 
remember I was playing an opponent at Universal City and I kept hitting the 
ball to her because that's what you do with your students. I finally had to 
tell myself, 'No, you're supposed to be hitting it away from her. You're 
supposed to end these points.' 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't have the time to put in to practice like I used to. But I still 
like to play competitively and I think it gives you fresh insights that you can 
give to your students, fresh ideas. What's fun for me now is to see my students 
improve." 
</P>
<P>
But considering the large purses being awarded on the pro circuit these days, 
does she harbor any regrets about her decision to give up the pro tour? 
</P>
<P>
"It would be awfully hard to get back to that level," she said. "I don't know 
if I'd have the desire to leave the life I've worked myself into and the 
clients I have. But you get tempted." SHANNON GORDON

CSUN RALLIES IN 9TH INNING TO STAY ALIVE IN CCAA RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It does not take a rocket scientist to pick the Cal State Northridge baseball 
fans out of a group. 
</P>
<P>
The Matador fans are the ones with their fingernails bitten to the quick and 
pacemakers under their shirts. 
</P>
<P>
Those cardiac kids of the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. had their 
faithful on pins and needles again Saturday before pulling out a 5-4 conference 
victory over Chapman with a two-run rally in the ninth inning at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
The victory kept Northridge (28-17-1, 14-11-1 in conference play) in the CCAA 
title chase. But the Matadors must their remaining five conference games, and 
CCAA-leading Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (19-10) must lose its remaining game -- 
against Northridge on Tuesday -- if the Matadors are to tie for the title. 
</P>
<P>
Only three teams will go to the NCAA Division II Western regionals. The CCAA 
champion automatically earns a berth. Northridge Coach Bill Kernen concedes 
that his team's chances of making the regionals are slim if the Matadors don't 
win the conference title. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a long shot," Kernen said. "We're going to have to charge down the 
stretch." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge charged down the stretch Saturday to defeat Chapman for the second 
time in three days. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors, who have won 11 one-run decisions and five two-run decisions this 
season, handed Chapman (23-26, 11-16) its eighth one-run conference loss. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge was sailing along with a comfortable 3-0 lead after seven innings 
before senior left-hander Fili Martinez (7-4) gave up a two-run homer to Chris 
Cutliff in the eighth, sending Matador fans to their cuticles. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez seemed to recover in the ninth, striking out the first two batters, 
but Jason Rolish singled to left and Ken Briggs smashed a towering home run to 
left-center to give Chapman a 4-3 lead heading into the bottom of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
But as Matador fans have learned, it's never over until it's over. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Mike Solar led off the bottom of the ninth by lining his first 
collegiate home run over the left-field wall to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman freshman Pete Coleman (1-3), who had not allowed a hit in 4 1/3 innings 
of relief until Solar's homer, seemed to unravel at that point, giving up a 
double to Greg Shockey and an infield single to Randy Thompson, putting runners 
on first and second with nobody out. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Patuano, a submarining senior right-hander, relieved Coleman and got Craig 
Clayton on a fly to deep center, but Shockey, representing the winning run, 
tagged and went to third on the play. 
</P>
<P>
That brought Ted Weisfuss to the plate, and he fisted a 1-0 pitch down the 
right-field line for a single, scoring Shockey to end the game. It was 
Weisfuss' fourth game-winning hit this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Our games have been close all year, and we always find a way to win," Weisfuss 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, who had a two-hit shutout after six innings, settled for an 
eight-hitter, striking out eight and giving the Matador staff its 31st complete 
game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I should have been able to close the door," Martinez said. "I choked is what I 
did. I hung the breaking ball and they hit it. I'm just glad the team came back 
to win it."

<TEXT>
<P>
After serving as track coach at two Del Rey League high schools in the past two 
seasons, Alemany's Jon Mack made it three for three Friday when he accepted an 
offer to coach at Loyola High. 
</P>
<P>
Mack, 28, has coached six high school All-Americans in a nine-year career that 
includes eight years at Notre Dame and one at Alemany. 
</P>
<P>
Mack will finish the school year at Alemany and begin at Loyola in September. 
He will teach biology and also serve as an assistant football coach at Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
Mack's teams have compiled a 58-15-1 dual-meet record and four times have 
finished the season in the Southern Section 2-A Division top 10. Loyola, an 
all-boys school with an enrollment of 1,100, won this season's Del Rey League 
championship. STEVE ELLING

PERILS OF GYMNASTICS OBVIOUS TO ADAMEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Lynch 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Watching them prance around barefoot and clad in white tights, gymnasts rank 
low on the macho meter, but after serious examination of the sport, it is 
difficult to challenge their courage. 
</P>
<P>
Danger and injury are part and parcel of the day-to-day life of a dedicated 
practitioner, which accounts for much of the sport's appeal, according to Shawn 
Adamek, one of the top gymnasts in City Section history. 
</P>
<P>
"When you master a skill by overcoming the danger and putting your fears behind 
you, you feel like a man," the 18-year-old Monroe senior said. "It takes a long 
time to get used to the danger. You try not think about it but you can't help 
being scared. You've got to be an idiot not to realize how dangerous the sport 
is." 
</P>
<P>
Even those at the opposite end of the intelligence spectrum, however, fall prey 
to the sport's dangers. Adamek (5-foot-11, 140 pounds) carries a 3.5 
grade-point average, is editor of the school newspaper and will attend Stanford 
next fall on a gymnastics scholarship. But academic achievement buys little 
insurance against bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
Adamek suffered a broken bone in his left forearm during a routine warm-up 
drill before a match against University on March 30. While limbering up on the 
high bar, his left hand became entangled and locked up while he swung around 
the bar. He attributed the injury to a new pair of leather hand grips but said 
that the accident could have happened to anybody. 
</P>
<P>
"You can always lock up on the high bar. It's just part of the sport," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it led to a gruesome afternoon for Adamek. He hung for nearly a minute 
with his arm wrapped around the bar and it took seven teammates to get him 
down. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't exactly remember how many times I went over but I could feel that my 
hand wasn't moving," he said. "Some people say you go into shock but I never 
did. I felt the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
Adamek was taken to the hospital where the worst part of the ordeal ensued. 
After the bone broke in half, the pieces overlapped each other because the 
surrounding muscles had cramped and contracted. Traction in the form of a small 
weight attached to his arm was prescribed in order to separate the bones. 
</P>
<P>
"That was probably the worst pain," he said. "For about 15 to 20 minutes I sat 
there. They didn't give me any drugs. It was torturous." 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, he underwent surgery that left two metal plates and 10 screws 
in his arm. He missed two weeks of school and had the cast removed this week. 
The pain has long since subsided, but he was reminded of the anguish when the 
new City Section champion, Frank Baca of Huntington Park, was crowned this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
As a junior, Adamek led Monroe to the school's 10th City title and swept all 
seven events in the individual championship, a feat accomplished only by 
Monroe's David Moriel, who won an NCAA title at UCLA in 1987. Not only was 
Adamek sidelined for Thursday's meet at University, he did not attend. Because 
of his injury, he is unable to drive. 
</P>
<P>
He faces a lengthy rehabilitation process and it seems likely that he will miss 
this summer's junior national competition in Wisconsin. Perhaps the lone bright 
spot for Adamek is his own history. He has learned the hard way that he is a 
fast healer. 
</P>
<P>
His gymnastics career started when he was 7, and, by the time he was 12, he 
ranked among the top five in the country in the his age group. But as a 
seventh-grader, he underwent surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff in his left 
shoulder. He returned to competition after an 18-month absence and placed a 
disappointing 60th in the junior nationals in the 15- to 18-year-old division. 
</P>
<P>
"I was losing to guys I used to beat regularly and that was pretty hard to 
take," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A year later as a sophomore at Monroe, he competed in just one full meet. 
First, he broke the top plate of his right foot during a floor-exercise 
routine. Then, he broke his left foot in his first meet after the right foot 
had healed. 
</P>
<P>
Adamek's attitude after each injury has remained consistent: He wants to get 
back on the pommel horse. 
</P>
<P>
"I replay the injury all the time and try to make myself remember," he said. 
"If I don't think about it, it could become my worst fear. I want to get back 
to the gym, even if it's just to breathe the chalk." 
</P>
<P>
Les Sasvary, who has coached at Monroe since 1963, calls Adamek his most 
talented gymnast. He has seen his protege compete since he was 7 and is a close 
friend of the Adamek family. Both he and Adamek's father Joseph escaped from 
Hungary during the 1956 anti-government uprising that was eventually quashed by 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very, very sad for Shawn," Sasvary said. "He's intelligent, 
tremendously motivated and is lean and very flexible. Within a short time he 
will emerge as one of the top collegiate gymnasts. One day he may be in the 
Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
Adamek says that he dreams of Olympic gold, but other goals are more immediate. 
After a wasted senior season, he wants to start anew in college. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of luck involved with the Olympics," he said. "If you reach your 
height in the wrong year, you're out of luck. I feel like I'm just starting my 
career now. I haven't been in the thick of the nationals yet. This feels like 
the start of the big time."

CAMP NEXT IN CHARGERS' LEARNING PROCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
They call it a mini-camp when actually it's a maxi-fraud. It's a dress 
rehearsal without dresses. The NFL doesn't even allow its players to wear 
shoulder pads in mini-camps. 
</P>
<P>
And it starts Monday for the Chargers at their San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium 
practice facility. It will last five days. 
</P>
<P>
It's a fraud because most of the players present will have been working out on 
the same practice field before the mini-camp and will continue to work out on 
the same practice field when the mini-camp ends. 
</P>
<P>
More important than anything that happens on the field in five days will be the 
results of physicals given to the 94 players expected to take part. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, there are questions begging. And even if Dan Henning, the new 
coach, has figured out the answers in private, he will finally be asked about 
them publicly this week. Fact is, he has already started answering some of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Questions such as: 
</P>
<P>
 How does rookie Billy Joe Tolliver's arm strength look? 
</P>
<P>
 "He has the type of arm we drafted him for," Henning says. Henning is more 
concerned with Tolliver's weight. The Chargers drafted him at 217 pounds. Right 
now, he's about 222. That's a lot for a quarterback who's only 6 feet tall. "I 
don't give a . . . what he weighs," Henning says. "But I don't want it to be 
fat." Henning says Tolliver must reduce his body fat content by three 
percentage points. "Which means," he says, "somewhere along the line he's got 
to transfer about seven or eight pounds of fat into muscle or just flat out 
lose seven or eight pounds." 
</P>
<P>
Where will No. 1 rookie Burt Grossman line up? 
</P>
<P>
 Probably at right defensive end, according to Gunther Cunningham, the 
defensive line coach. Cunningham has said Leslie O'Neal will play outside of 
Grossman. But he hasn't made it clear in what kind of alignment. Tackle Joe 
Phillips is unsigned and making noises about how much more money the Chargers 
will have to pay him if they switch him permanently to the thankless position 
of nose tackle. 
</P>
<P>
What kind of practices will Henning run? 
</P>
<P>
His predecessor, Al Saunders, delegated most of the authority during practices 
and did very little hands-on coaching. Saunders also had this habit, impossible 
to ignore, of becoming more animated and more hands-on every time owner Alex 
Spanos showed up to watch practice. It's hard to imagine Henning keeping his 
hands off the wide-open quarterback situation no matter who's looking on, even 
though he has hired, in Ted Tollner, one of the best quarterbacks coaches in 
football. 
</P>
<P>
How tough will Henning's classroom be? 
</P>
<P>
The mini-camp meetings will be more difficult than the workouts. By far. The 
Chargers have to get their roster down to 80 players by June 1. The marginal 
players who are quick in the classroom will have a big advantage over those who 
are not. "The mental strain we will put them through during the five-day period 
will be even greater than it would be starting out in training camp," Henning 
says. 
</P>
<P>
How will Henning treat the rookies? 
</P>
<P>
The same as he will in training camp -- as raw recruits. "When in doubt, the 
veteran gets the nod," Henning says. "We pick these rookies for potential. But 
we play people for production. There are a number of things that a rookie has 
to go through that you don't ever know until you get there. Moving into a 
strange town, being out of college for the first time in their life. Learning 
how to deal with the media and the free time they'll have when they're not in 
class. And going through a 16-game schedule. All the vets have been through 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Explaining why he advised unsigned running back Gary Anderson not to 
participate in mini-camp drills, agent Peter Johnson cited the case of former 
linebacker Ron Faurot. Johnson said Faurot suffered a career-ending knee injury 
while working out for the Chargers in 1985. Johnson said Faurot was unsigned at 
the time. The Chargers contend Faurot was signed in 1985 before he hurt his 
knee. The record shows they placed him on injured reserve Nov. 7, 1985, before 
eventually releasing him May 30, 1986. Faurot signed with the Colts April 22, 
1987, and was waived three weeks later. If, as Johnson says, the injury was 
career-ending, why did the Colts sign Faurot in 1987 when he would have had to 
pass their physical before signing? . . . The Chargers are tentatively 
scheduled to begin training camp for veterans July 29 at UC San Diego. They 
also are tentatively set to scrimmage the Cowboys Aug. 2-4 in Thousand Oaks. 
The Cowboys are owned by Arkansas millionaire Jerry Jones, who dismissed 
longtime personnel boss Gil Brandt the other day without the courtesy of a 
handshake. "That's why those scrimmage dates are tentative," Charger Coach Dan 
Henning said, dryly.

It's mid-morning at Mira Mesa Bowl. A man sits at the counter of the dimly lit 
bar with a drink. The pool tables await the first break of day. The lanes are 
nearly deserted. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Stayrook approaches the table where her husband, Jess, is talking about 
his professional bowling career. Eyes widening, she grabs the ashtray filled 
with cigarette butts and looks at Jess in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
He assures her he has only smoked two. The rest were already there. Smoking is 
his vice. He knows it's bad but can't quit. 
</P>
<P>
Jess Stayrook, 30, a native San Diegan who has earned three times more in four 
months this year on the Pro Bowlers Assn. tour than he did the past two years, 
is very honest. He's the first to admit he has made some bad decisions in his 
life, smoking being one of them. But he's learning, and progressing. 
</P>
<P>
At 16, Stayrook made what he considers his biggest mistake, quitting high 
school and taking a job in construction. To this day, he regrets it. He hopes 
he can prevent others from making the same mistake. 
</P>
<P>
He talks about school: "School really teaches you discipline. You've got to 
have your education. You're going to know the right moves and the wrong moves. 
You have counselors. If you're not in school, you have to make these decisions 
on your own." 
</P>
<P>
So he has, learning with each wrong turn. 
</P>
<P>
Another mistake was turning pro in 1983. He thought he was ready. The previous 
year he was player of the year in San Diego, averaging 228. The tour slapped 
him in the face. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't even close to being ready," he said. "Out on tour, if you can't shoot 
spares, you can't make money. They say the strike ball is everything. I 
disagree. If you're not picking up the spares, the strikes don't mean 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't pick up many spares. His average was 170, and he quickly realized he 
was out of his element. So he returned home and practiced a lot. 
</P>
<P>
Now, $61,000 richer since January after 14 tournaments and a third-place finish 
in the U.S. Open (worth $30,000), some people are calling him an overnight 
success. Funny how all the years of practice and frustration are forgotten when 
someone finally hits it big. For instance, people used to tell Stayrook to give 
up bowling and get into something where he could earn some steady money. His 
father wanted him to become a policeman. 
</P>
<P>
Overnight success? Yeah, sure. This is a guy who, while working as a glass 
cutter in Florida six years ago, entered a small tournament to make money 
because he was broke. He had $8 in his pocket. He bought a well-worn house ball 
for $5, got someone to make the holes bigger so it would fit his fingers and 
won the tournament. That was good for $400. 
</P>
<P>
Stayrook's friend, Steve Wiedmann, who has bowled with him since they were 15, 
recalls one day when Stayrook bowled five games against a recreational bowler 
for money. Stayrook was up 130 pins after three games and wound up losing. 
</P>
<P>
"On the way home," Wiedmann says, "he was very serious about throwing his 
bowling balls off the freeway. The guy he played was just a hack." 
</P>
<P>
Suffice it to say, this isn't the story of someone blessed with unlimited 
natural ability. Stayrook and bowling weren't magic from the start. He was 
always good, and dedicated. But it was a long time before he blew anybody away. 
</P>
<P>
As a kid, he played baseball. It was fun, he was good and everything was fine 
until he showed up late for All-Star practice one day after a dentist 
appointment. He had a note, but the coach kicked him off the team. Seems the 
coach's son was next in line for Stayrook's spot. So the third-best pitcher in 
the league and a .450 hitter hung up his glove. 
</P>
<P>
"I was devastated," he said. "I could see that happening in the big leagues. 
Somebody is making all your decisions. You have no control." 
</P>
<P>
Bowling was different. He had complete control. Practice was never a problem; 
he'd bowl at least 10 games a day. And his game started to take shape. Slowly. 
Of course, he never put much stock in his accomplishments as a teen-ager. Of 
the time he took second in singles at the state junior tournament, he says: "It 
was OK. If you don't win, no one ever remembers." 
</P>
<P>
Between 15 and 25, Stayrook didn't miss many parties. It was fun, he says, but 
basically a waste of time. When he was 25, he quit drinking for nearly a year 
and was amazed how his concentration and coordination improved. He thought, 
"I've got to knock that off for good" and was back on the tour the following 
year. This time, he knew what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
Professional bowlers, Stayrook says, can be extremely friendly away from 
competition. You can slap backs, tell jokes and have a good time. But when the 
tournament starts, look out. 
</P>
<P>
"When you hit the lanes, they'll hate you and everything you stand for," he 
said. "They'll do anything to win. That was something that took me a while to 
get used to." 
</P>
<P>
Say this about Stayrook, he kept going. He never seriously considered quitting. 
Friends he has bowled with over the years gave up the dream of making it on the 
tour, but Stayrook stayed with it. Wiedmann sometimes bristles when he hears 
people at the bowling center bragging that they know Jess Stayrook. Those are 
the ones, Wiedmann says, who were saying three years ago that Stayrook would 
never make it. 
</P>
<P>
Stayrook has the right personality for this sport. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't worry about anything," Kathy says. 
</P>
<P>
Except one thing. "The only thing he ever worried about," Kathy says, "was 
having enough money to keep going and get to the next stop." 
</P>
<P>
Kathy, on the other hand, used to worry a lot. One time, shortly after Jess 
rejoined the tour, Kathy was so nervous during a tournament that she bolted 
from the lunch table and went to the bathroom to throw up. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy has gotten calmer. And for the Stayrooks, success is nice. It allows Jess 
to do some of the things he wished someone had done for him when he was a kid. 
A small child came up to him recently and asked if he had any bowling balls for 
sale. "Break out a dollar," Jess said. The kid gave him a dollar. Stayrook went 
and got him a ball. The kid couldn't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
There are things Stayrook has trouble believing himself. His average, for one. 
Last year it was 207. This year, it's 217. 
</P>
<P>
"Unbelievable," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Or how about this? In the qualifying round of the U.S. Open -- in which 
Stayrook lost to eventual champion Mike Aulby, 234-222, in the next-to-last 
match of the stepladder final -- he defeated Marshall Holman, the all-time 
money winner on the men's tour. For years, he has watched and admired Holman on 
television. But, as Stayrook will tell you, sitting on the couch thinking about 
beating him is one thing. Doing it is quite another. 
</P>
<P>
"To wax his cake felt great," said Stayrook, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
The praise felt even better, 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought Marshall Holman would come up to me and shake my hand and say 
'Nice bowling.' " 
</P>
<P>
Or course, he never thought he'd be an instant celebrity either, kids asking 
for autographs and all that. 
</P>
<P>
"That's probably my favorite thing," he said. "It's a good feeling to have 
people appreciate someone who has worked hard and had a lot of success. It's a 
confidence-builder." 
</P>
<P>
Well deserved, says Wiedmann. 
</P>
<P>
"If anyone deserves success in bowling it's my friend, Jess," he said. "I don't 
know anyone that's more dedicated."

FLOW OF MONEY TO CENTRAL AMERICA IS MAJOR BUSINESS ENTERPRISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Being separated from her children is painful, but Maria del Carmen Chang draws 
some solace by sending a little money home each month so her son and three 
daughters can buy themselves a small toy, school supplies or a dress. 
</P>
<P>
The 41-year-old housekeeper earns a modest $100 per week but still manages to 
make regular visits to the offices of an express courier service in the 
Westlake area that sends money orders and small packages to Guatemala City 
almost overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Chang said she felt guilty because she could scrap together "only $75" to send 
to her children, the youngest of whom is 3 years old. "I've been here for more 
than a year and I haven't seen them," she said in Spanish in a tone of deep 
resignation. "You come here to work and that's the way life is." 
</P>
<P>
Others filtered into the office during a recent Sunday morning, including a few 
more housekeepers, a Salvadoran construction worker and a welder who said he 
was sending half of his most recent paycheck to Guatemala as a Mother's Day 
gift. 
</P>
<P>
In all, about 500 Guatemalan and Salvadoran immigrants come each day to the 10 
offices of Garza Express, one of half a dozen courier express chains that have 
become a fixture in Los Angeles' Central American community. 
</P>
<P>
According to university researchers, the courier agencies are among the fastest 
growing businesses in the city. But they are themselves only the most visible 
sign of the ever-growing flow of money and consumer goods sent home by Latino 
immigrant workers, many of them here illegally. 
</P>
<P>
Added together, the immigrants' money orders of $75, $100 or $200 are not 
exactly small change. Economists estimate that "remittances" by immigrants in 
the United States to El Salvador alone total from $500 million to $1 billion 
each year, a greater source of foreign exchange than coffee, the country's 
leading cash crop. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remedy for Suffering 
</P>
<P>
With El Salvador suffering from a harsh civil war for almost a decade, and 
Guatemala going through one of its worst economic crises of the century, the 
payments and packages have taken on an added importance. A money order for a 
few hundred dollars can help a family make a rent payment and a package of 
clothes can keep children warm in the winter. 
</P>
<P>
"In most cases they send the money back home and the money is used for 
immediate needs," said Norma Chinchilla, a professor of sociology at Cal State 
Long Beach. "It's phenomenal the amount they squeeze out of their meager 
earnings to support their relatives." 
</P>
<P>
Getting that money home, however, has always presented something of a problem, 
because the postal services in Central America are notoriously inefficient. 
</P>
<P>
Immigrant entrepreneurs have stepped into this void in the last few years by 
creating courier services. Nora Hamilton, a political science professor at USC 
who recently completed a study of local Central American businesses with 
Chinchilla, said the courier chains have at least 30 offices in and around Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Business was brisk at Garza Express in Westlake, where customers dressed in 
their Sunday best stood at the counter and quickly wrote letters to send along 
with their money orders. Typically, the charge is about $10. 
</P>
<P>
"This week, I'm sending money to my mother," said Victor Morales, a welder 
whose letter home to Guatemala included a money order for $130 -- to help his 
family "cover costs" -- and some snapshots of a reunion with his brother in 
Monterey Park. "Next week, it's my wife's turn." 
</P>
<P>
Blanca Lucho, a 24-year-old housekeeper, sent home a package that included a 
money order for $150 and a few gifts for her mother, whom she has not seen 
since coming here in 1984. Inside the small "CARE package" was a pair of dress 
shoes, a change purse, a pincushion in the shape of a heart, and two small jars 
of cold cream and B-12 vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
Because the housekeeper's package was headed for Guatemala City, chances were 
it would reach its destination quickly, said Garza Express office manager 
Franklyn Marquez. But the same cannot be said for packages and letters sent to 
the remote jungle and mountain areas of Guatemala, or to the countryside in El 
Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
"We deliver anywhere in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. That's what makes 
us unique." Marquez said. "Unfortunately, there are places where our couriers 
can't get through." 
</P>
<P>
To prove his point, Marquez produced a small stack of returned envelopes, 
covered with the scrawled messages of frustrated couriers: "Couldn't deliver -- 
war zone," and "the guerrillas wouldn't let me pass." 
</P>
<P>
Another chain, Pipil Express, has solved the problem of delivery to El 
Salvador's war zones by announcing the arrival of the money orders and packages 
on local radio stations so that the recipients can pick them up in the relative 
safety of a regional post office, said manager Mauricio Saravia. 
</P>
<P>
Although more and more Central American immigrants seem to be using the courier 
services, many say the preferred way to send money and packages home is with a 
friend returning to the home country. 
</P>
<P>
Invariably, flights from Los Angeles International Airport to Central America 
are filled with passengers carrying television sets, blenders, skateboards and 
every other type of small appliance or toy that can fit into a box or suitcase. 
</P>
<P>
Among those waiting for TACA Airlines Flight 511 to depart on one recent 
evening for San Salvador and Guatemala City was Antonio Hernandez, a 
38-year-old Salvadoran construction worker. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez was not a passenger on the flight, but his friend Jose Pablo 
Villatoro was. Hernandez explained that Villatoro was doing him the favor of 
taking a stereo to his relatives. 
</P>
<P>
"When someone travels, you take advantage of the opportunity," Hernandez said. 
"It's the cheapest way to send things home." 
</P>
<P>
Villatoro was traveling alone to San Salvador with six large boxes and two 
suitcases. They were packed, he said, with clothes and more stereo equipment 
for his own family. "When you have a chance to buy things, you have to share 
with people there who don't have that chance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some passengers packed their suitcases and boxes over the weight limit and were 
told by airline officials they would have to rearrange their luggage into 
smaller, lighter boxes that wouldn't strain the backs of the luggage handlers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to take out 20 pounds, we have to take out more," said Edwin Torres as 
he helped his friend Teresa Henriquez unload clothes from an overstuffed box. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's take out the microwave," he said finally, lifting the brand-new 
appliance from underneath several layers of dresses, pants and blouses. 
</P>
<P>
Once they arrived in Central America with their booty, the passengers of Flight 
511 would face one last obstacle -- local customs officials. Stiff customs 
duties are designed to protect the local economy from foreign competition. But 
most of the passengers on Flight 511 said they could easily avoid any duties by 
bribing an official. 
</P>
<P>
Nor are the Central American governments likely to try and stop the flow of 
dollars into their countries. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good for the families but the money helps the economy, too," said 
Hamilton of USC. "The money has to be changed to the domestic currency and the 
government eventually gets the dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Helping the economy, however, seemed to be far from the minds of most of the 
immigrants who came to Pipil Express on Vermont Avenue last week. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation is very difficult over there," said Jose Fernando Castaneda, 33, 
a native of Usulutan in eastern El Salvador. His money order would help his 
parents buy food and plant crops on their farm, he said. "At least with what I 
send home, life is better for them."

TOO HIGH ROLLERS?; 
</P>
<P>
DODGERS' O'MALLEY MAKES A PITCH FOR RESTRAINT IN PAYROLL SPENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dodgers' recent recall of outfielder Chris Gwynn to replace the injured 
Kirk Gibson did more than reshape the roster. 
</P>
<P>
It provided the club with at least one player earning less than $100,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn has a split contract. He makes $80,000 with the Dodgers or $40,000 at 
Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
Club owner Peter O'Malley sat in his office at Dodger Stadium the other day and 
attempted to make dollars and sense of a payroll that increased about 20% over 
the winter and is baseball's highest ever. 
</P>
<P>
He called for economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
"The system we now have hasn't worked, isn't working and won't work in the 
future," O'Malley said. 
</P>
<P>
"The concern over player payrolls is real -- both on my part and throughout the 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
Is this at odds with the portrait of improved profitability painted by Peter 
Ueberroth when he stepped down as commissioner on March 31? 
</P>
<P>
O'Malley would not comment on anything Ueberroth might have said. 
</P>
<P>
The former commissioner frequently cited the industry's economic growth during 
his administration but never said that the system, as it pertains to player 
signings and movements, was working. He obviously believed that it wasn't, in 
fact, because it was allegedly under his auspices that collusion occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Of the call for reform, Donald Fehr, executive director of the Major League 
Players Assn., said: 
</P>
<P>
"The system helped the Dodgers win a World Series last year. The O'Malleys have 
become fabulously wealthy because of the system, and still they complain. I 
don't know what to make of that. If anyone has no reason to complain it's Peter 
O'Malley." 
</P>
<P>
Said O'Malley: "Our club will continue to do fine, but for the sake of the 
clubs in general there has to be a change. We can survive if the industry can 
survive, but we can't survive in a vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're going to have baseball in the smaller markets, if we're going to 
expand, we have to find a system which allows both sides to prosper. I'm not 
saying roll back salaries or bring back the reserve system. 
</P>
<P>
"For a long time the owners had all the leverage and abused it. Now the players 
have all the leverage. In many cases they're not being paid for performance as 
much as for being in the right place at the right time. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, if they're looking at free agency in a year, it's likely they'll get a 
three-year contract for a staggering amount. 
</P>
<P>
"There has to be a middle ground. There has to be a better way to compensate 
the players." 
</P>
<P>
Preparing for expiration of the collective bargaining agreement at the end of 
the season, the owners are examining their options. 
</P>
<P>
Collusion is out. Faced eventually with major penalties for their sins of the 
previous three winters, penalties that could erode Ueberroth's portrait of 
profitability, the clubs reopened the market during the recent off-season with 
a spending spree reminiscent of their undisciplined response to free agency in 
the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball salaries rose about 14.6% last winter, the opening-day average 
climbing from $447,291 a player in 1988 to $512,804. 
</P>
<P>
So now what? Which avenue will the clubs choose within the framework of a new 
bargaining agreement? 
</P>
<P>
Salary caps? Revenue sharing? Tighter restrictions on free agency, arbitration 
or both? Abolishment of one or the other? More equitable distribution of cable 
TV money, such as the 12-year, $500-million contract that the New York Yankees 
recently signed with the Madison Square Garden network? 
</P>
<P>
O'Malley said he has some thoughts on the subject but wouldn't reveal them. He 
will leave the inevitable war of words to others. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to hold hands and work together," he said of management and the union. 
"Instead of bashing each other, we need to be creative." 
</P>
<P>
One of the creations the owners already have in place is a spring lockout date 
if a collective bargaining agreement hasn't been signed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand the purpose of that other than to force the players to 
accept a rollback," Fehr said. "I think the clubs have already decided to go 
through the motions (of negotiating a new contract), then stage the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't like free markets and it has always been their goal to convince the 
players to accept a system that will produce lower salaries. I hope I'm wrong, 
but they seem determined to provoke a confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be posturing, but a bunch are already talking publicly." 
</P>
<P>
And Fehr, of course, doesn't accept a lot of what he is hearing. 
</P>
<P>
If baseball needs a new system, he said, why did 58% of the Texas Rangers, who 
have never even won their division title, sell for an estimated $25 million? 
</P>
<P>
Why, he wondered, is it virtually impossible even to put a price tag on the 
Dodgers or Angels? 
</P>
<P>
"Look at revenues," he said. "The new national television contracts (effective 
next year) represent about $15 million to each club or more than $600,000 for 
each player in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"That's before tickets, concessions, parking, licensing and local TV-radio are 
factored in." 
</P>
<P>
The average major league ticket sold for $7.17 last year. If every visitor to 
Dodger Stadium spent a modest $12 for his ticket, food, gifts and parking, that 
alone would be more than $36 million. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the $15-16 million from national TV, the estimated $15 million to 
$18 million from local TV and radio, the $500,000 -- a figure rising rapidly -- 
from major league licensing, the undisclosed shares from appearances on 
opposing clubs' cable networks and what is believed to be significant income 
from the 400 acres that the Dodgers own in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
O'Malley obviously isn't hurting. Neither is he crying. He is merely addressing 
the industry's stability, speaking on behalf of clubs that do not own their 
stadiums and do not operate in a market of Southern California's size. 
</P>
<P>
And, he said, even the Dodgers cannot afford a 20% payroll increase every year, 
cannot have the payroll double every two years, as his has. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The 1989 salary commitment to the 25 players, including the sidelined John 
Tudor, who were with the club opening day is $22,193,555, the highest ever. The 
figure does not include signing bonuses from previous winters but does include 
$2,050,000 in signing bonuses given to Orel Hershiser, Jay Howell, Mike 
Marshall, Alejandro Pena and Alfredo Griffin last winter. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The average of $887,742 is also the highest ever, of course, and the 
Dodgers are the first club to open a season with the entire roster earning 
$100,000 or more. The Dodgers, in fact, have seven players making $1 million or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
This year, as well, in inheriting Mike Morgan's $375,000 contract from the 
Baltimore Orioles, the Dodgers have broken a policy and accepted incentive 
provisions. Morgan can make another $150,000 in award and appearance bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, believing that incentives help reduce guaranteed terms in some 
cases, have a $12.3 million payroll but could dole out another $2.5 million if 
every incentive is realized. 
</P>
<P>
How did the Dodger payroll climb so far so fast? 
</P>
<P>
Cynics might suggest that it was too low to start with, that during the 
disastrous 1986 and '87 seasons the club ignored the availability of Tim Raines 
and other free agents because of a commitment to collusion. 
</P>
<P>
O'Malley, however, said that the Dodgers' commitment to winning has been 
continuous, and that at a time when it is impossible to build strictly through 
the farm system, supplemental trades and free-agent signings are bound to 
inflate a payroll. 
</P>
<P>
He cited the signing of Gibson to a three-year, $4.5-million contract and the 
trade for Eddie Murray, who is guaranteed $2.5 million, $2.7 million and $2.8 
million in the final three years of a five-year contract he signed with the 
Orioles, who are believed to be picking up the $500,000 of each year's salary 
that Murray has deferred. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 24 active Dodgers, only 10 are home grown.

<P>
Is the club also paying a price for winning the World Series? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that has anything to do with it," O'Malley said. "If we had lost 
the World Series or lost the playoffs or finished second in the division, what 
players would have been signed for less?" 
</P>
<P>
It seems obvious, however, that the Dodgers' postseason success strengthened 
the bargaining power of several players and made the club more responsive to 
negotiation demands, including those of Hershiser, whose three-year, 
$7.9-million contract will make him baseball's highest salaried player. 
</P>
<P>
"We went higher than we planned with Orel," O'Malley said. "People say to me, 
'Peter, you didn't have to sign him,' and I always say, 'That's fine, do you 
have any other suggestions?' 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, if we don't sign him, then he probably leaves as a free agent when the 
season is over."

TOROS' UNLIKELY GURU; 
</P>
<P>
TEAM GETS MENTAL, PHYSICAL BOOST FROM ITS PUREST FAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Standing in front of the dugout at Cal State Dominguez Hills, Bill Puett tugged 
at a baseball cap on his head and shuffled his feet in the brick dust. He was 
there to see a Toro baseball game, but first he wanted to talk to the team. 
From a hip pocket he withdrew a crumpled piece of notebook paper and, beckoning 
curious players around him, read aloud: 
</P>
<P>
 We once played a team called the Chapman, 
</P>
<P>
 Who thought that they played like the Batman, 
</P>
<P>
 They really were Robin, 
</P>
<P>
 And came away sobbin', 
</P>
<P>
 The Toros had kicked where they sat, man. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 The holder of a Ph.D., Puett sees the athletic field as an extension of the 
classroom, so what he termed "a silly poem" was a sort of test. He had written 
it, like others before, as inspiration for a team that was 10 games below .500 
and woefully in need of some motivation. 
</P>
<P>
Puett developed an unorthodox visual and conditioning program while a part-time 
faculty member here five years ago, and since then he has worked with 
professional baseball players and other world-class athletes. But it's here on 
the windy knoll where the Toro baseball field overlooks the oil refineries of 
Carson and the picturesque Palos Verdes Peninsula, that he likes to work most. 
</P>
<P>
"The Division II level is the purest form of baseball," he explained. "There is 
no big-time pressure, just a little pureness to it. I have an attachment to 
Dominguez Hills." 
</P>
<P>
He is easily the purest baseball fan the university has, although he's not the 
type to yell and holler. There are few Dominguez Hills players who haven't felt 
Puett's warm squeeze on the nape of the neck, listened to comforting words of 
wisdom or received his customary goodby hug. 
</P>
<P>
"He has the ability to make a guy feel good," said Toro Coach George Wing. "He 
really cares about you." 
</P>
<P>
Most of Puett's ideas in the areas of conditioning are so new that they have 
not yet been accepted in the so-called normal channels of athletic performance 
workouts. But at Dominguez Hills, Athletic Director Dan Guerrero, a former 
All-American baseball player at UCLA, was one of the first to recognize their 
value. For that, says Puett, he will be forever grateful. 
</P>
<P>
"They made me part of the woodwork, and I appreciate that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Puett's conditioning programs can be described as brilliant and exotic, helpful 
and avant-garde. Puett has the allure of brilliance and eccentricity. His 
portfolio is diverse. He has researched childhood development, written about 
bonding between mother and child and helped found a toddler think tank and 
child-care center at Dominguez Hills. In Puett's latest research, artists reach 
new creative heights by convincing themselves to think like a child. 
</P>
<P>
One of his favorite projects was to develop a nutritional program devoid of 
fast-food trappings. 
</P>
<P>
It is also one that he follows religiously. Employees at Dominguez Hills still 
talk about the time he showed up at a party and, forgoing the dip and chips, 
ate a bag of garlic pills. 
</P>
<P>
Said his wife, Kathy: "Bill's idea of splurging is (low-fat frozen yogurt)." 
</P>
<P>
Puett is more at home wearing a flannel shirt with a backpack slung over his 
shoulder than he is in more traditional professorial garb. His gaunt, earthy 
image belies a subtle superiority. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the brightest guy I've ever met," said Guerrero. 
</P>
<P>
But not with his finances. Supporters gasp when Puett hands out free advice. 
Said Wing: "It's almost to a fault, in a sense, that he's opposed to making 
money off of (his work)." 
</P>
<P>
Puett's work with athletics has taken two distinct paths. In vision training, 
he asserts that eyes can be trained to see better through concentration. He 
also developed and patented Ultimate Performance, a conditioning program "to 
help realize the potential of both amateur and professional athletes" through 
unorthodox aerobic and anaerobic workouts. He considers a game of Ping-Pong, 
for example, a better training device than hours of heavy weight lifting. 
</P>
<P>
"The average baseball player will never need more than a pair of 10-pound 
dumbbells," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Such ideas undercut the conventional, tough 1980s approach to conditioning, but 
Puett's supporters say his work is on the cutting edge of biotechnology. 
</P>
<P>
Some of his philosophies include: 
</P>
<P>
* Training a batter, for instance, to pick up a pitched ball about seven feet 
after it leaves the pitcher's hand -- not at the instant it is released, which 
is the popular theory. Puett worked with former Dodger Terry Whitfield the year 
that Whitfield came within one hit of tying the club record for pinch hits in a 
season. 
</P>
<P>
* Players who play better at night see less in the day. They should wave a 
150-watt light bulb in front of their closed eyes for five to 10 minutes a day 
to make them less sensitive to light. 
</P>
<P>
* Diet plays a prime role in building muscle tissue. Puett recommends a 
low-protein, high-complex carbohyrate diet. Supplements made from green 
Australian mussels, garlic and alfalfa are helpful. He also prefers holistic 
medicine. 
</P>
<P>
* Swimming and power weight lifting are worthless to most athletes because they 
promote development of "slow" muscles. Puett calls his program Bar Plyometrics, 
workouts consisting of jumping, hopping and reaction drills keyed to the 
individual athlete. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the best athletes in the world are Ping-Pong players, asserts Puett, 
because they have trained their eyes to focus on a small object traveling at 
high speed, and react to it in a split second. Table tennis is a staple of Bar 
Plyometrics. 
</P>
<P>
Puett's big claim to fame could be Bob Boone. Once known as one of major league 
baseball's strong men, Boone gave up power lifting five years ago after he met 
Puett. According to Puett, Boone, then 36, was coming of a season with the 
California Angels where he batted just .202 and "received physical therapy 
everyday." Through vision training, Boone steadily raised his average to last 
year's career-high .295. 
</P>
<P>
Boone has used Puett's Bar Plyometrics to drop about 15 pounds and get out of 
the training room, where Puett said Boone was taking four hours of ice therapy 
each game. Boone has caught more games than any other major league catcher and, 
barring injury, could go on for years. 
</P>
<P>
"I have changed Bob's program many times in the last four years," Puett said. 
"He continues to improve because of these changes." 
</P>
<P>
About his success with Bar Plyometrics, Boone told The Times: "The idea is to 
extend the career by raising the performance level with power-oriented 
exercises rather than the usual strength and endurance exercises." 
</P>
<P>
Puett's theories are not well-known, but he says he thinks they will catch on 
someday. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were a general manager of a baseball team and you had a valuable 
product like a pitcher and you could see what this had done for other players 
like Boone, wouldn't you want to see what this program is about?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Wing had his players use Puett's conditioning drills in the fall but let them 
slide when spring practice got under way in January. Five players eventually 
developed sore arms. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking back at it now, that hurt us," he said. "Next year we'll be more 
direct with the players and see that they continue his workouts." 
</P>
<P>
Puett has been working with pitcher Rick Davis, who is expected to be picked 
high in June's major league draft. Before the recent Chapman College-Dominguez 
Hills game, Puett got Davis and three others into a game of "hot potato" with a 
baseball. The idea was to build vision and coordination while keeping the ball 
off the ground with foot, hand or glove. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a game that the old-timers played, and I recommend it," said Puett. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, by all accounts, is deep into Puett's philosophies. They held a private 
consultation in the dugout during the Chapman game, which Dominguez Hills won, 
3-2. 
</P>
<P>
"Is this fun?," Puett reflected. "It is a hobby. Certainly on the college 
level, it is an avocation." 
</P>
<P>
When the game was over, Puett gave Wing a big hug. 
</P>
<P>
"Listen," admonished Wing to Puett. "Some guy asks you to help him, charge him. 
You can give it to us for free, but you (get an offer from the pros), you get a 
lawyer and make some money." 
</P>
<P>
Puett grinned and said little. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't tell me, 'Someday,' " continued Wing. "You do it." 
</P>
<P>
But Puett probably wasn't listening. He slipped the backpack over his shoulders 
and walked to the parking lot next to the Olympic Velodrome, where Kathy would 
pick him up for the trip home to Vista. The lot had emptied, but Puett was 
still full of ideas. Soon he was offering his workout program to an amateur 
softball player with an injured rotor cuff. 
</P>
<P>
Then, with a hug, he was off, pondering, no doubt, what more he could do for 
the guy.

THOMAS QUITS AFTER LEUZINGER WALKOUT; 
</P>
<P>
2-YEAR COACHING TENURE WAS STORMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A stormy two-year relationship between Leuzinger High's baseball team and Coach 
Derrel Thomas ended Thursday when the ex-Dodger resigned after most of the 
Olympian players turned in their uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger Athletic Director Steve Carnes said Friday that the players who quit 
have been reinstated and that Thomas will be replaced by junior varsity Coach 
George Mendez for the team's two remaining Bay League games Tuesday and 
Thursday against Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's flare-up between Thomas and several players came after the team 
forfeited its league game against Hawthorne, a loss that eliminated Leuzinger 
from playoff contention and brought down the curtain on a disappointing season 
for the once-promising Olympians. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole situation is just crazy," said a Leuzinger teacher, who asked not to 
be identified. "But (the school) put up with it for two years. Thomas has had 
conflicts with players before." 
</P>
<P>
The teacher said Thomas, a walk-on coach, was almost fired last season for 
grabbing a player and has been criticized for frequently missing practices and 
team meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Reports vary as to who was at fault for Thursday's forfeit. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said only six players were on the team bus when it departed for the game 
at Hawthorne. He said other players who missed the bus because they were late 
drove to the game in cars but were ineligible to play. 
</P>
<P>
"It's because of insurance purposes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Carnes said there is no CIF-Southern Section rule restricting the mode 
of transportation to and from games. He said if the players drove to the game 
on time, they could have played. 
</P>
<P>
But when the remaining players arrived at Hawthorne, Thomas informed them that 
they would not play and Leuzinger would have to forfeit. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when they walked by me and handed in their uniforms," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he tried to talk the players out of quitting, Thomas said: "Why should 
I? I didn't have to talk them into playing baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said nine players walked out, including star pitcher Tyrone Scott, the 
South Bay leader in strikeouts. He said only three starters did not turn in 
their uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had problems with them being late for the bus," he said. "I got fed up 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
The incident capped a rough week for Thomas. His father, Lorenzo, died Monday, 
forcing him to miss practice that day and have Mendez serve as acting coach in 
Tuesday's 10-9 loss to Hawthorne. He attended the game and returned to practice 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I had planned to take the whole week off," he said. "But just doing nothing 
didn't seem to be too productive. My spirits weren't that high, but I still 
tried to coach anyway." 
</P>
<P>
The resignation did not surprise many at Leuzinger. When Thomas was hired 
before last season, he said he didn't plan on coaching at Leuzinger for more 
than two years. The Olympians were 25-29-1 under Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
"The entire baseball situation has been building to this," Carnes said. "I 
think, under the circumstances, the resignation is best for all concerned. It 
hasn't been easy for Derrel. He's had some personal problems this week with his 
father passing away." 
</P>
<P>
Carnes said the school plans to advertise for a new coach. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for a teacher, somebody who is on campus all the time," he said. 
"I think that will be best for the program." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Thomas' arrival at Leuzinger last year was met with enthusiasm by 
many of the same players who walked out Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Many felt the presence of an ex-major leaguer would help fill the void left by 
Dennis Bowman, who died of a heart attack in May, 1987, after coaching the 
Olympians to a 142-86-2 record in nine seasons. 
</P>
<P>
But the high expectations never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger took third behind Redondo and El Segundo in the competitive Pioneer 
League last season and lost in the opening round of the Southern Section 4-A 
Division playoffs, finishing with a 12-16 record. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas predicted that the Olympians would win the Bay League title this season, 
and that seemed possible in March after they captured the championship of the 
Costa Mesa Tournament and brought a 7-2-1 record into league play. 
</P>
<P>
However, Leuzinger played inconsistently, and reports of Thomas' run-ins with 
umpires and his players overshadowed the team's lackluster performances on the 
field. A source at Leuzinger said Thomas was ejected from a game with Crespi on 
April 22 in the Palos Verdes/Redondo Tournament and drove away in his car while 
the team rode home on a bus. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he had to go to a (baseball) card show," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
The frustration felt by Thomas and Leuzinger's players seemed to come to a head 
in recent weeks as the team dropped out of contention in the Bay League. The 
forfeit to Hawthorne marked the Olympians' seventh loss in the last eight games 
and kept them in seventh place at 4-8, 13-13-1 overall. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a good team, easily one of the top teams in the area," said a 
Leuzinger teacher. "And now they're zilch." 
</P>
<P>
Carnes, who coaches Leuzinger's football team in addition to serving as 
athletic director, said he sympathized with the players who quit. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to realize they're disappointed because of the way the season has 
turned out," he said. "I know they weren't happy about quitting. But they're 
kids, and they're impulsive." 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo and St. Bernard, co-leaders in the Camino Real League baseball race, 
will square off at 7 Wednesday night at El Segundo Recreation Park in a game 
that will most likely decide the league championship. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo snapped St. Bernard's Southern Section record of 35 consecutive 
league victories with a 9-6 win April 15, but the Eagles figure to face a 
different pitcher Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard's ace left-hander, Dan Melendez (9-1), did not pitch in the last 
meeting but is scheduled to start this time. Melendez hit two home runs and had 
five RBIs in the first game with El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
Carson's baseball team forfeited its game with visiting Crenshaw on Friday when 
Coach Marty Blankenship was ejected for arguing about a balk in the first 
inning. The loss knocked the Colts into last place in the four-team Pacific 
League with a 6-6 record and hurt their chances of qualifying for the L.A. City 
4-A playoffs with three games remaining.

SAM HALL KAPLAN: GEHRY SHUNS THE ARCHITECTURAL RUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM HALL KAPLAN

<TEXT>
<P>
One of the more engaging characteristics of architect Frank O. Gehry is that 
despite reams of awards and honors -- the latest being the prestigious Pritzker 
Prize -- he continues to experiment with his design process and vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
Many architects who have reached superstar status tend to repeat the 
architectural themes that brought them fame, regardless of differing sites and 
projects. Partly to blame are clients, who usually want a signature building -- 
"like the one that won that last award" -- and architects with too many thumbs 
in too many half-baked pies. 
</P>
<P>
Among the genuine talents who, I fear, appear to have fallen into this rut -- 
at least judging from the photographs of their more recent proposals and 
projects -- are Philip Johnson and James Stirling, Pritzker winners in 1979 and 
1981, respectively, Post-Modernist Michael Graves and local, Richard Keating. 
</P>
<P>
But mediating his instincts as an artist and his integrity as an architect with 
the soul of a survivor, Gehry, at 60 years of age, continues to grow, avoiding 
"isms" being wielded by pandering critics and sycophantic academics. 
</P>
<P>
Each new project in which he is involved appears unique, exploring context, 
materials and space in a highly individualistic style that demands a response, 
be it visceral or intellectual. 
</P>
<P>
Such was his house in Santa Monica, which he "deconstructed" then expanded in 
odd, raw shapes and materials; the Aerospace Museum in Exposition Park, a 
collision of sculptural objects decorated with a jet fighter; the 
chain-link-draped Cabrillo Maritime Museum in San Pedro; the Loyola Law School 
campus, a collage of classical forms; and more recently, Edgemar, a valiant 
attempt to reinvent a mini-mall in Ocean Park, and his proposal for Disney 
Hall, a graceful assemblage focused not on itself but a public space. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these projects have been less than successful in their siting, 
functioning, styling and detailing. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to find the entrance to the Aerospace Museum; the Cabrillo Museum is 
awkwardly sited, the law school campus is not very neighborly and the 
chain-link-wrapped elevator shaft clutters up the small interior of Edgemar. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the Aerospace Museum makes an important architectural statement in an area 
desperate for one, the Cabrillo Museum works, the fragments of the law school 
are a welcome alternative to a monolithic, anonymous structure, and Edgemar, 
with its exuberant, unfinished shapes, rough edges, clashing materials "reads" 
Main Street, Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
As for the house, it is his castle as well as a legitimate exercise in 
architectural research and development. I am glad I live near it, not next to 
it. 
</P>
<P>
And unlike many architects, Gehry admits his mistakes. In a recent interview, 
when I raised the Edgemar elevator shaft, Gehry generally agreed with the 
criticism. Such a reply can be disarming, especially to a critic. 
</P>
<P>
He has even admitted that he hates chain link, saying he only used it in an 
artistic way as an exploratory material because it was so pervasive. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always learning, trying new things, seeing if they work or don't work," 
Gehry said. You can say what you will about Gehry's highly publicized art and 
architecture juggling act with accompanying commentary, which he performs very 
much in the guileless style of a design-conscious Will Rogers, but one has to 
respect his talent and spirit. 
</P>
<P>
So what if he has dropped a few balls and has performed some questionable rope 
tricks as his act has matured. It is nonetheless a class act, from an 
architectural point of view, entertaining, educating and energizing. 
</P>
<P>
The Pritzker jury summed it up well in its citation: 
</P>
<P>
"Gehry's architecture reflects his keen appreciation for the same social forces 
that have informed the work of outstanding artists through history, including 
many contemporaries with whom he often collaborates. His designs, if compared 
to American music, could best be likened to Jazz, replete with improvisation 
and lively, unpredictable spirit. 
</P>
<P>
"Always open to experimentation, he has as well a sureness and maturity that 
resists, in the same way Picasso did, being bound either by critical acceptance 
or his successes." 
</P>
<P>
It continued: 
</P>
<P>
"Although the prize is for a lifetime of achievement, the jury hopes Mr. Gehry 
will view it as encouragement for continuing an extraordinary 'work in 
progress,' as well as for his significant contributions thus far to the 
architecture of the 20th Century." 
</P>
<P>
And, in particular, of Los Angeles.

AT HOME / PACIFIC PALISADES: AFFLUENT COMMUNITY CHERISHES ISOLATION; 
</P>
<P>
NEW ARRIVALS NEED TWO INCOMES AND HEFTY EQUITY IN THEIR FORMER HOMES TO BUY IN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When Elizabeth and Giovanni Cecchetti began looking for a house in Los Angeles 
two decades ago, they narrowed the choice to Westwood and Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
"We considered Westwood Village, which would have been more convenient and less 
isolated, but the schools in the Palisades, along with the beauty of the area, 
convinced us to buy in the Palisades," Elizabeth Cecchetti said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a sense of community in the Palisades that reminds me of a small 
town," said Cecchetti, whose husband is a professor of Italian at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
They bought a house in the Marquez Knolls section of the Palisades for slightly 
more than $70,000, she said. It is probably worth close to $1 million today. 
</P>
<P>
Isolation from the rest of the city of Los Angeles has long been a prized 
quality in this affluent community of winding streets lined by mature trees, 
where many houses have Pacific Ocean views. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attractive Location 
</P>
<P>
The isolated location attracted the community's Methodist founders in the 1920s 
and has been a factor in the Palisades ever since. That isolation has both its 
good and bad points, according to recent arrivals and longtime residents of 
this community of about 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
On the positive side, the Palisades is geographically removed from much of the 
crime, air pollution and traffic congestion that afflicts most of the city. 
Despite the presence of Will Rogers State Beach, Palisades residents think of 
their area as a seaside community with more in common with, say, Santa Barbara, 
than the typical California beach city. 
</P>
<P>
On the negative side, the isolation means that commuters face long drives on 
Sunset Boulevard or Pacific Coast Highway, the only routes in or out of the 
Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
One major criticism of the Palisades is that despite the numerous organizations 
in the community, there are too few activities for teen-agers. Young people 
seeking entertainment in popular Westwood Village must travel seven winding 
miles on Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Isolation and relative freedom from crime also has attracted newer residents 
who can afford houses in a community where the average single-family house 
sells for more than $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moved From Ocean Park 
</P>
<P>
When the Cecchettis moved to the Palisades in 1969, "the husband worked and the 
wife stayed home to raise the children," Elizabeth Cecchetti recalls. "Now, 
both work and a baby sitter or housekeeper watches the kids." 
</P>
<P>
Her description fits one of the newest families in Pacific Palisades, Larry and 
Randi Dubey, who moved recently to a $675,000, 1,700-square-foot house on 
DePauw Street. They had owned a house in the the Ocean Park section of Santa 
Monica for the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
"We were looking for a community with less crime than our area of Santa Monica, 
which wasn't far from Lincoln Boulevard," Randi Dubey said. She's an executive 
of Sacks SFO, a chain of discount fashion clothiers; her husband is a partner 
in Ernst &amp; Dubey, a residential contracting firm. 
</P>
<P>
The Dubeys, with two young children, wanted to live in an area where there are 
other families. With about an 80% to 20% ratio of homeowners to renters, the 
Palisades is in sharp contrast to Santa Monica, where the ratio is reversed. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're single or don't have children, you can live anywhere," Randi Dubey 
said. "But when the children come, you start looking for safety. We rented here 
in 1982 and grew to love the community." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two-Income Families 
</P>
<P>
"We like to say that we bought our house because the neighborhood is great and 
because the kitchen had just been remodeled," Larry Dubey said, adding that the 
equity in their Santa Monica house, purchased in 1983, was a big help in 
qualifying for the Palisades house. 
</P>
<P>
According to real estate broker Bud Petrick, whose firm sold the Dubeys their 
house, virtually every family moving to the Palisades from elsewhere in the Los 
Angeles area has two incomes and a hefty equity in their previous home. 
</P>
<P>
It's a matter of economics, he said. The latest multiple listing book for the 
Palisades has an asking price of $475,000 for the least expensive single-family 
house, with the most expensive, in the Riviera section, listed at $5.3 million. 
The least expensive condominium is $210,000, a one-bedroom, one-bath unit, he 
said, while the most expensive condominium lists for $795,000. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Los Angeles Board of Realtors, Pacific Palisades was the 
second most active area in the city last year, with 395 sales, just behind 
Silver Lake-Echo Park, with 398. The average price for all 1988 sales in 
Pacific Palisades was $704,477, a 32.5% increase from the 1987 average price of 
$531,755. 
</P>
<P>
"The Palisades was largely built up in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s and, aside 
from a few lots in Palisades Highlands and tear-down lots elsewhere, there's no 
place to build here," Petrick said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Purchased for the Land 
</P>
<P>
The property values have reached such levels that houses on the so-called 
"alphabet streets" (named for prominent Methodist missionaries: Albright, 
Bashford, Carey, Drummond, Embury, Fiske, Galloway, Hartzell, Iliff and Kagawa) 
are being purchased for their lots, at prices that have ranged as high as 
$600,000, Petrick said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the big concerns in the Palisades is that people who buy these 
properties will build houses that are much too large for the lots," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Outsized houses and development in general are major topics of conversation in 
the Palisades, according to Flo Elfant, president of the Pacific Palisades 
Community Council, and manager of the Palisades office of Merrill Lynch Realty. 
</P>
<P>
The powerful council serves as a forum on issues of concern to residents, she 
said. It has representatives from 15 cultural organizations, two homeowner 
groups, men's and women's service clubs, the chamber of commerce and the 
ministerial society. 
</P>
<P>
The developers who tried to create a shopping center at the site of the Santa 
Monica Land &amp; Water Co. building on Sunset Boulevard at Swarthmore Avenue 
learned a hard lesson about the clout of the council about six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stop Unwanted Development 
</P>
<P>
The landmark building would have been demolished for a center anchored by 
Bullock's. An intense "Don't Mall the Palisades" campaign convinced Bullock's 
to back out of the project. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Dean, an attorney and a past president of the Pacific Palisades 
Residents Assn., said the Palisades derives much of its power to stop unwanted 
development from the organizations -- including his 1,000-member group -- that 
make up the community council. 
</P>
<P>
That power was demonstrated last November, when Palisades residents and others 
joined forces to defeat a controversial Los Angeles ballot measure sponsored by 
Occidental Petroleum Corp. that would allow oil drilling in the Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
"Residents call me all the time, and I tell them I'll put their complaint or 
suggestion on the agenda for the next meeting," Elfant said. 
</P>
<P>
She said that a major topic of discussion in the community these days is 
Palisades High School and the problem of alcohol and drug abuse there -- along 
with what many Palisades residents believe is an inordinate amount of media 
coverage of the school and the community. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subject of TV Show 
</P>
<P>
Pali High, already the subject of a 1965 Time cover story and a 1976 book, was 
featured on the April 21 edition of ABC-TV's "20/20" show. Besides describing 
the affluent community and its academically excellent high school, a reporter 
took a camera crew to a party in the mountains where Pali High students and 
others used alcohol and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The program showed parents and their children at a substance-abuse program and 
pointed out that Pali High has one of the few Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) 
chapters on a high school campus. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Jelikovsky, a drug and alcohol counselor who has been trying to organize a 
Palisades teen center, said the "community has structured itself to meet the 
needs of adults, but has neglected the needs of the children." 
</P>
<P>
Proposals to expand the Palisades YMCA or build teen centers have met with 
resistance because adults are more concerned with property values or the 
environmental impact on the community, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, the Palisades has a low crime rate. Of 41 incidents reported in 
February, 20 were thefts from a vehicle and 10 were stolen cars. Most of the 
other incidents were residential and business burglaries. A rare exception to 
this pattern was the June 22 rape and murder of an 18-year-old Pali High 
senior. A 32-year-old security firm employee is awaiting trial on the charges.

SPEAKING OUT: COULD JAPANESE REALTY HOLDINGS HURT U.S.? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE COLLINS, Catherine Collins is co-author of Selling Out, which will 
be published this month by Contemporary Books. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I spent last year working on a book about Japanese investment in the United 
States. I can't count the times I heard real estate pundits say, "Sure, we'll 
take their money. They can hardly take these investments back home with them." 
</P>
<P>
But while Japanese investors can't take their office buildings, hotels, 
shopping centers, golf courses, homes and manufacturing plants offshore, the 
issue is more important and complex than that. The real issue is the trading of 
short-term financial gains for a long-term loss of sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
The United States is one of the few industrialized countries that does not 
monitor foreign investment in some manner, and as a result there are no solid 
numbers for foreign investment in any industry. Estimates by the private sector 
for Japanese real estate investments in 1988 range as high as $16.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Like other foreign investors, the Japanese have been drawn to U.S. real estate 
for many reasons -- relatively higher rates of return in the U.S. market 
because of its greater depth and sized compared to other markets throughout the 
world, especially Tokyo; the decline of the value of the dollar against the 
yen; an affinity for high-quality downtown properties, a market that has been 
replenished throughout the 1980s by a commercial real estate boom, and, perhaps 
most important, because Japanese investors view the U.S. market as a safe haven 
from political and economic turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Question of Meaning 
</P>
<P>
The question is what does Japanese investment mean for the U.S. real estate 
industry? Will real estate go the route of the consumer electronics and auto 
industries? 
</P>
<P>
Can the Japanese capture enough of this decentralized market to become a 
dominant force, setting rents and determining housing costs for a nation of 
tenants? 
</P>
<P>
By using the growing power of Japanese-owned banks and influencing policy 
through the best lobbyists money can buy, can they affect zoning laws and 
wide-ranging government policies? 
</P>
<P>
And will the real estate industry suffer dire consequences if the Japanese are 
forced to retreat suddenly because of economic difficulties at home, as the 
Mexicans did in the early 1980s? 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of unlimited investment claim that it is a stabilizing factor in the 
overall market and they ignore the perils posed by allowing yet another vital 
segment of the domestic economy to become vulnerable to exchange-rate 
fluctuations and other components of a global economy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Downtown Office Space 
</P>
<P>
Already, Japanese investors control more than 25% of the office space in 
downtown Los Angeles. The list is impressive: Arco Plaza, with a price tag of 
$620 million; Broadway Plaza, $210 million; Chase Bank Plaza, $137 million; 
Manulife Plaza, $62 million; World Trade Center, $75 million; Union Bank 
Building, $87.5 million; 1000 Wilshire Building, $145 million; 800 Wilshire 
Building, $47.5 million. And at least 12 other major downtown office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Does this give them undue clout in downtown Los Angeles? Time will tell. 
Experience shows that when and where the Japanese have clout, they are willing 
to use it. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago it was disclosed that a subsidiary of Japan's giant Toshiba had 
exported equipment that helped the Soviets build quieter, hence deadlier, 
submarines. U.S. congressmen were outraged and eight of them vented their anger 
by smashing a Toshiba radio on the steps of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
There was great resolve in Congress to slap stiff sanctions on Toshiba by 
banning all imports from the giant electronics company. But Toshiba mustered a 
lobbying effort that cost an estimated $9 million and resulted in a watering 
down of sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Zoning Policies 
</P>
<P>
If the Japanese can accomplish that in Congress, it doesn't take too much 
imagination to see how effectively a handful of major Japanese property owners 
could affect, say, downtown zoning policy in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, there are several scenarios in which I can envision the Japanese 
investors actually dumping their U.S. real estate, plunging the industry into 
an economic tailspin. 
</P>
<P>
But first, let's look at Japan's real estate market, particularly Tokyo's. 
</P>
<P>
Japan is a tiny, island nation, about the size of Montana, into which is 
crammed a population half that of the United States. But the squeeze doesn't 
end there. Of the limited amount of land, only 30% is habitable. And half of 
that habitable land is devoted to agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Business practices and government policies have added to the problem posed by 
the excessive demand for a limited supply of land. The price spiral, according 
to the Journal of Japanese Trade and Industry, stems partly from frenetic land 
speculation by corporations trying to invest their surplus funds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rising Through Charts 
</P>
<P>
Although Japan's land prices have climbed steadily for the last decade, they 
have careened off the charts in the last three years, particularly in the major 
metropolitan areas. For example, according to Japanese government figures, the 
cost of residential land in downtown Tokyo rose 68.9% in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
And in commercial real estate, the Japanese government reported in 1988 that 
the choicest piece of commercial real estate in central Tokyo was worth $6.7 
billion an acre. 
</P>
<P>
Escalating land prices in Japan are fueling the export of capital to the United 
States. Japanese property owners are borrowing heavily against their holdings 
in Japan to make new purchases in the United States. Because of the higher 
yields available on commercial property in the United States, what seem to be 
bargain-basement prices for the Japanese, U.S. real estate has proven to be an 
attractive home for this borrowed money. 
</P>
<P>
Now this works great, as long as property values in Tokyo keep rising. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Liberalizing Land Policy 
</P>
<P>
But in an effort to solve its own problems of overcrowding and hyper-inflated 
land prices, the Japanese government is considering a combination of measures, 
including liberalization of land policy to allow more agricultural land to be 
used for residential purposes, that could increase the Tokyo land supply 
threefold. 
</P>
<P>
Such a move, although beneficial to the average worker in Japan, would be 
devastating to the wealthy landowner. 
</P>
<P>
When property values drop in Tokyo, as real estate cycles throughout the world 
indicate is inevitable, banks might begin calling in the loans. To pay up, the 
Japanese borrowers will be forced to sell off properties. It is a sure thing 
that the foreign holdings -- from real estate to stocks -- will be the first to 
go. 
</P>
<P>
Now if you think this sounds too far-fetched, that a foreign interest could 
really have that much impact on this country, think back to Black Monday. For 
millions of Americans, Oct. 19, 1987, has come to symbolize the new 
vulnerability of their once-invincible nation. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Brady, the former senator who is now secretary of the Treasury, was 
appointed by President Reagan to chair a commission to study the stock market 
crash. Despite its thoroughness, the commission's findings were sanitized and 
the blame for the crash was apportioned safely among a number of culprits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pinpointed Cause 
</P>
<P>
But six months later, Brady put aside political niceties and in a 
little-publicized speech to institutional investors pinpointed the cause of the 
crash: 
</P>
<P>
"People ask me, 'What was it that blew it off on the 19th of October? Was it 
the twin deficits (budget and trade)? Was it the Rostenkowski (tax) 
legislation? What was it?" Brady said. "I don't think it was any of those 
things . . .." 
</P>
<P>
"The real trigger," he said, "was that the Japanese came in for their own 
reasons and sold an enormous amount of government bonds, and drove the 30-year 
government (bond) up through 10%. And when it got through 10%, that got a lot 
of people thinking, 'Gee, that's four times the return you get on equity. Here 
we go, inflation again.' 
</P>
<P>
"That to me, is what really started the 19th -- a worry by the Japanese about 
U.S. currency." 
</P>
<P>
So what we are seeing here is a loss of sovereignty. The crash was a graphic 
example of what happens when a nation cedes economic control to an outside 
power, even a friendly one. Foreign investment evolves from benign to dangerous 
when decisions affecting a nation's economic, political and military destinies 
are made in foreign capitals. With that loss, a nation puts itself in danger of 
becoming a colony of its foreign owners.

REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: ADJUSTABLE MORTGAGE RATE INTEREST CAN DIFFER, DEPENDING 
ON INDEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I am a puzzled real estate broker. What is going on in the 
upside-down mortgage market? In our town, fixed-rate mortgages are a little 
over 11%, whereas adjustable-rate mortgages, after the initial six-month teaser 
rate around 9%, jump to almost 11%. I thought adjustables were supposed to be 
cheaper than fixed-rate mortgages, but that doesn't seem to be happening. Also, 
most of my home buyers who took adjustables preferred the cost of funds index, 
but now all that seems to be available are adjustables tied to the volatile 
Treasury bill index. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: As you know, local savings and loans, banks and mortgage brokers have 
been selling most of the mortgages they originate to the secondary mortgage 
market, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. But, in the last few months, these 
major buyers have discovered the cost of funds index is moving very slowly 
upward, whereas the Treasury bill index changes much faster to reflect rising 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in the last year the cost of funds index has risen only about 0.5% 
whereas the Treasury bill index has gone up around 3%. Adjustable-rate mortgage 
borrowers with loans tied to the cost of funds index (as I have been 
recommending) need not worry about massive monthly payment increases. But, ARM 
borrowers whose loans are tied to Treasury bill indexes are often shocked to 
receive big payment increases. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that lenders have suddenly switched from originating ARMs tied to 
the cost of funds index to ARMs tied to the faster rising Treasury bill indexed 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
To complicate matters, a few adventurous ARM lenders now offer loans tied to 
the LIBOR index, the London interbank rate, which has nothing to do with U.S. 
interest rates and is not understandable to most borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Should Option on Land Be Recorded? 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have an opportunity to buy an option on land that I think I can get 
rezoned for a shopping center. The option price is only $5,000. Do you think I 
should record the option? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. Since you are not living on the property, an unscrupulous owner might 
sell to another buyer who would not have to honor your option if he was not 
aware of it. Recording the option, or a memorandum of it, gives constructive 
notice of your option rights to anyone dealing with that property. Ask your 
attorney to explain further. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Personal Property in Sale Should Be Listed 
</P>
<P>
Q: At a Sunday open house, the realty agent handed us a listing information 
sheet about the home. It said stove, refrigerator, washer, dryer, barbecue and 
drapes were included. After some heated negotiation, we bought the house. But, 
when we received the keys we were shocked to discover the house was stripped 
bare. The realty agent refuses to help us get the items we thought were 
included because they weren't listed on the purchase contract that we signed. 
However, we presumed they were included since they were on the information 
sheet. Do you think we are entitled to these items? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. Shame on that realty agent for failing to be certain that the personal 
property items on the information sheet were not listed on the sales contract. 
</P>
<P>
The general rule is that a real estate sale does not include personal property 
on the premises. From a strictly contractual viewpoint, the seller was correct 
in removing the personal property because it was not included in the sales 
agreement. However, as novice buyers, you were relying on the truth of the 
information sheet and the honesty of the agent to deliver what was promised. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest you try to settle the matter with the agent's broker, but if that is 
not possible, don't hesitate to go to court. Consult a real estate attorney for 
further details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ask the Right Questions When Buying a Home 
</P>
<P>
Q: My husband and I want to buy a home in an elegant, established neighborhood 
where the schools are top quality. However, the homes are about 30 years old 
and some have serious problems, such as the need for new plumbing and faulty 
additions built without permits. What is the best way to avoid being "taken" by 
the seller and the realty agent? 
</P>
<P>
A: Just ask the right questions of the seller or the realty agent. My favorite 
is: "What are the drawbacks of this house?" To be absolutely certain you have 
been told about any defects, when you make a written purchase offer, make sure 
it includes a phrase such as: "Seller warrants all material defects in this 
property have been disclosed in writing to the buyer." If the seller or agent 
failed to disclose a problem, then you have a basis for legal action later. 
Please consult your attorney for further details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Home Seller Should Limit Repair Costs 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am trying to sell my home, but my real estate agent isn't much help, so I 
am turning to you for advice. Our home is in an out-of-the-way location and is 
rather unusual, so it is not easy to sell. 
</P>
<P>
It has been listed for sale two months and we have only received one low-ball 
offer, which we rejected without a counteroffer. However, that offer said the 
buyer wanted a professional inspection. We had no objections to that. But the 
offer also said the seller agreed to pay for any necessary repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, we objected to that. If we receive a similar offer with such an 
inspection clause, how can we protect against unlimited liability? 
</P>
<P>
A: That's easy. In your acceptance of the purchase offer, just add a clause 
such as: "Seller to pay for any necessary repairs to the premises recommended 
by the professional inspector up to $1,000." Ask your attorney for further 
details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Should Home Seller Let Buyer Make Repairs? 
</P>
<P>
Q: We must sell our home due to financial problems. The agent with whom we plan 
to list our home recommends we paint and fix up our home. Frankly, we don't 
have the money or the time to do the work. However, if necessary, we could 
borrow the $1,500 we need. I think we should give the buyer a credit for the 
work, but my husband thinks we should borrow the money. What do you recommend? 
</P>
<P>
A: Please listen to your husband. Getting your home into tiptop condition 
before putting on the market for sale could be the smartest investment you ever 
made. 
</P>
<P>
Paint is by far the cheapest and most profitable improvement you can make. 
Cleaning and repairing are other valuable home improvements. Most home buyers 
have little imagination. If you don't fix up your home before selling, it will 
appeal only to the bargain hunters like me. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small Down Payment Advantages Outlined 
</P>
<P>
Q: I think you are wrong to tell home buyers to get the biggest available 
mortgage and to make the smallest possible cash down payment. If people 
encounter financial difficulties, then they have a large monthly mortgage 
payment and they will probably lose the house. A better idea is to make at 
least a 25% cash down payment, so they can reduce the monthly mortgage payment 
and minimize the risk of loss if times get tough. Why don't you rethink your 
advice? 
</P>
<P>
A: There are several sound reasons that home buyers, even those who can afford 
a large cash down payment, should obtain the largest available mortgage and 
make the smallest possible down payment: Uncle Sam allows home mortgage 
interest deductions only on acquisition mortgages plus up to a $100,000 home 
equity loan; if the home appreciates in market value, the owner's yield per 
dollar invested will be maximized with a small down payment; if the owner 
encounters financial difficulty the home can be sold whether it has a large or 
small mortgage, and if the home has a large assumable mortgage it will be 
easier to sell. 
</P>
<P>
A mortgage is really a forced savings account. Most home owners need the 
discipline of a mortgage payment. They would probably waste any slight monthly 
payment savings if they made a large down payment. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate, suppose one home buyer purchases a $100,000 home with a $10,000 
down payment and a $90,000 mortgage at 10.5% interest. The monthly payment on a 
30-year loan is $823.25. However, if another home buyer pays $25,000 down and 
obtains a $75,000 mortgage at 10.5% interest, the monthly payment on a 30-year 
loan is $686.05. That is only a $137.55 lower monthly payment, but the second 
buyer tied up an extra $15,000 cash. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Uninsured Losses May Be Tax Deductible 
</P>
<P>
Q: A severe storm damaged the roof of our home. Although I think our 
homeowner's insurance company was wrong to deny our claim, and we are now suing 
them, we did not receive any insurance payment. Can we deduct our loss of about 
$4,500 for repair costs on our income tax returns? 
</P>
<P>
A: Probably. If your loss was "sudden, unexpected or unusual" you qualify for 
the casualty loss tax deduction if the loss was more than 10% of your adjusted 
gross income. Other examples of casualty loss deductions include uninsured 
losses due to fires, floods, earthquakes, thefts and wind storms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Know Risk of Buying With Zoning Limits 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are considering buying a two-family duplex on a lot zoned for 
single-family homes. This is called a "nonconforming use." The realty agent 
says if we should have a fire, the city will allow us to build only a 
single-family house. Do you think this should stop us from buying the duplex, 
which we like very much? 
</P>
<P>
A: If you understand the risk of buying a nonconforming use property, I see no 
reason why you should not purchase that duplex. However, your offer should 
consider the diminished property value due to the zoning problem. If a fire 
should damage or destroy the duplex, rebuilding with a single-family house 
might be an advantage because such properties usually appreciate much better in 
market value than do small rental properties.

INNOVATIVE APPROACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an article (April 2) and subsequent letters, the merits and advantages of 
Leimert Park were generously extolled. My father, Walter Leimert, developed the 
area in the middle '20s, giving an entire block to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Leimert Park was probably the first community on the West Coast to merge under 
one project various developments . . . single-family homes, apartments and 
business. Really an innovation at the time. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowner association and building restrictions encouraged proper design, 
implemented and maintained abundant tree planting (before the city had a park 
department) and set the tone for community involvement. Illustrious architects 
were encouraged to design model homes for the middle class. Life magazine 
called Leimert Park the "City of the Future." 
</P>
<P>
As a young man in the '40s, I participated in the latter stages of the 
development. I am delighted that today Leimert Park is once again experiencing 
recognition as truly a lovely place in which to reside and shop.

ZOO TEAM OMISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheryl Kornman's article (April 30) on the new Children's Zoo was both accurate 
and informative. Throughout the article she developed the theme of a 
well-coordinated team consisting of the owner, architects and specialty 
contractors. Unfortunately one key member of the team was not mentioned, 
specifically the general contractor, Ray Wilson Co. 
</P>
<P>
We are very proud of the accomplishments of the group assembled by Greater Los 
Angeles Zoo Assn., and we are very proud of our contribution to the Adventure 
Island project.

ON THE FENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andy Lang (Handyman Q&amp;A, April 16) gave a very informative answer to a "We 
want to build a fence on our property" question. 
</P>
<P>
However, where should the property owner put the fence? Where is the property 
line? I am a licensed California land surveyor, and I get this question daily. 
</P>
<P>
The only sure way is to find the existing property line markers (if any exist) 
or have the line or lines established by a licensed land surveyor. An agreement 
line between the two neighbors is fine if the neighbors don't move or change 
their minds. It is wiser and less expensive to place the fence in the correct 
position than moving an existing one over to the correct position.

BUILDING SANDBOX LIKE CHILD'S PLAY; 
</P>
<P>
PUT ONE TOGETHER WITH PATIO BLOCKS, BOARDS, FASTENERS AND, OF COURSE, BAGS OF 
SAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By READER'S DIGEST, For the Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Children of all ages love sand. Here are instructions for an easy-to-build wood 
sandbox that will provide them with years of fun. 
</P>
<P>
A hammer, saw and screwdriver are all you'll need. 
</P>
<P>
The base for the box is made of patio blocks, available at building product or 
home centers. The box itself has no bottom, so that rainwater can drain out. 
Get at least 21 8-by-16-by-2-inch blocks for the base. A lid allows the box to 
serve as a low play table and also acts as a barrier to pets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Built of Lumber 
</P>
<P>
The box and lid are built of lumber. To minimize waste, buy the lumber, all 
1-by-4-inch stock, in standard lengths. You will need 7 8-foot lengths, 1 
10-foot length, and 2 12-foot lengths. 
</P>
<P>
Redwood needs no wood preservative because the wood resists rot, but it is 
expensive. Pine or other softwood is cheaper but should be treated with a 
nontoxic wood preservative or paint. 
</P>
<P>
Saw the wood into these pieces: 6 48-inch side boards; 6 26-inch end boards; 10 
12-inch uprights; 14 28 1/2-inch lid boards, and 2 46-inch lid crosspieces. All 
the lumber is 1-by-4 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Hardware and supplies: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Four mending plates with 1/2-inch screws. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Galvanized nails: 2-inches and 2 1/2-inches. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two 36-inch lengths of 3/8-inch steel curtain rod cut into six 12-inch 
pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Three 50-pound bags of washed white sea sand, available at building or home 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Steps of Assembly 
</P>
<P>
How to assemble the box: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- Use 8-foot pieces for side boards, lid crosspieces, end boards and the 
uprights. Cut side boards and lid crosspieces first. Then cut end boards. Use 
the leftover 3-foot lengths for the uprights. Use the 10- and 12-foot lengths 
for lid boards. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- The sandbox is 12 inches (or three boards) high. Nail three uprights, 
evenly spaced, to the end boards and two uprights to the side boards. Use 
2-inch nails driven from the outside. Hammer two nails through the uprights 
into each board. 
</P>
<P>
Stagger the nails to prevent splitting. The nail points will project 1/2-inch 
from the inside surface. Hammer and bend these points down and into the wood 
(clinch-nail) so they won't scratch. This will also make a stronger bond. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- Assemble the completed sides and ends. Fasten the sides to the end pieces 
with 2 1/2-inch nails. 
</P>
<P>
4 -- Position lid crosspieces 10-inches apart on the lid boards. Adjust the 
crosspieces so they will fit inside the ends of the box. Clinch-nail the 
crosspieces into the end boards with 2-inch nails driven from the outside. To 
reinforce the lid boards at the corners of the lid, attach mending plates 
outside the crosspieces with 1/2-inch screws. 
</P>
<P>
5 -- Lay the patio blocks. Set the box on the blocks. Anchor the box by driving 
two rods into the ground on each side and one at each end in the spaces between 
the blocks.

SINGER BACKED FOR TOP CAR POST, TAKES SOME INSIDERS BY SURPRISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move that surprised some realty insiders, a search committee formed by the 
California Assn. of Realtors has recommended that the trade group's chief 
economist, Joel Singer, be promoted to the CAR's top staff position. 
</P>
<P>
Singer, 38, would replace Executive Vice President Donald Wiedmann, who 
recently announced his plans to retire by the end of the year after more than a 
decade at the head of the politically influential trade group. 
</P>
<P>
CAR directors will vote on the committee's recommendation in July. Sources 
familiar with the selection process say the board will likely rubber-stamp the 
recommendation and that Singer would assume the job before the end of this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The low-profile Wiedmann, a former San Diego real estate broker who was named 
to head the trade group in 1978, led CAR through the booming real estate market 
of the late-1970s and the tough early 1980s, when the number of dues-paying CAR 
members dwindled and revenue declined. 
</P>
<P>
Under Wiedmann, the realty group became more active in state and local politics 
and enhanced efforts to improve realtors' public image. 
</P>
<P>
Singer joined CAR as its manager of research and economics in 1978. He soon 
began moving up the career ladder and is now the trade group's chief economist 
and vice president of planning, research and economics. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation that Singer succeed Wiedmann surprised many of the trade 
group's 125,000 members. CAR general counsel William Pfeiffer has been gaining 
influence in the group for several years and was considered by some as the 
front-runner for the job. 
</P>
<P>
Some insiders saw the recommendation to elevate Singer as another sign that 
realtors are acutely aware of the role politics and public opinion play in the 
real estate industry. 
</P>
<P>
Singer's staff provides assistance to members across the state on a number of 
political fronts, including fighting slow-growth battles and other proposals 
that the group feels would infringe on property rights. 
</P>
<P>
Singer is also well-connected to many of the leaders of the National Assn. of 
Realtors, CAR's parent trade group. The California association represents about 
one-sixth of the national group's membership.

TAPER'S FESTIVAL FORAY PROVED TOO EXPENSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bit more than 3 years ago, the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles called a halt 
to its play festival, New Theater for Now. It had begun in 1967 and was one of 
the oldest in the country. The reason it ended? Lack of money. 
</P>
<P>
"The only other thing around when we began was the O'Neill Center," says Gordon 
Davidson, the Taper's artistic director. "We started the festival as a series 
of Monday night readings, and then we expanded it." 
</P>
<P>
Shoestring productions staged between major plays on the Taper Mainstage grew 
larger with the financial backing of the Rockefeller Foundation, he says. 
Perhaps the best-known play to come out of the festival during the late 1970s 
was Luis Valdez's "Zoot Suit." But after the foundation dropped its support, 
the festival became "a victim of its own success." 
</P>
<P>
"People expected more and more," Davidson says. "More scenery, more costumes. 
The playwrights wanted more. Everything seemed to grow. And it became more 
expensive even with simple productions, because we are a full union house." 
</P>
<P>
To cut costs, Davidson sought cheaper venues. New Theater for Now was produced 
on a 20th Century-Fox sound stage, in a coffee house at USC and at the Aquarius 
Theater. Eventually it returned to the Taper in the mid-'80s, the last time in 
November, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Although Taper staff members maintain that the festival could be revived if 
money is found, Davidson says he now prefers workshops and readings away from 
the pressures of a public forum. He cites "Stand-Up Tragedy," a new play by 
Bill Cain, as a successful instance of that thinking. 
</P>
<P>
Cain's play went from a workshop last fall -- it was one 16 developmental 
projects in the Taper Lab '88 NeWork Festival -- to a Taper, Too production in 
March and is scheduled to open June 1 on the Taper Mainstage. 
</P>
<P>
"That," Davidson says, "is a dream scenario for a playwright." JAN HERMAN

WELL-REGARDED ORANGE COAST COLLEGE MOVIE, VIDEO PROGRAM LETS THE STUDENTS DO IT 
ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Alan Ruffier graduated from the film/video department at Orange Coast College 
in 1986. By 1988, he had formed his own production company and written, 
produced and directed his first feature film, "Bonneville, Arizona," on a 
$100,000 budget that he raised himself. 
</P>
<P>
Just 25 years old, Ruffier is now at work on "Grandpa," his second independent 
feature. "It's a bigger budget ($500,000) and I'll be working with name actors 
this time," Ruffier said in a phone interview this week. "It's a whole new ball 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Kent Blakely, a fellow OCC graduate and Ruffier's co-producer on "Bonneville, 
Arizona," is now directing an independent feature of his own, "A Different 
Life," to be shot entirely on location in Orange County in June and July. With 
a local doctor as an investor, Blakely has also optioned the rights to another 
screenplay that will go into production next year with a projected $2-million 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 26 years old and I'm doing my second film," Blakely said, "and I've 
already got my third lined up." 
</P>
<P>
Ruffier and Blakely are two of the success stories that Brian Lewis, head of 
OCC's film and video department, points to with pride. And the two former 
students in turn give credit to Lewis -- and the program he has built on a 
shoestring budget -- for giving them the tools to build their early success. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very grateful to Orange Coast and Brian Lewis," Ruffier said. "At OCC I 
had the freedom to do what I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
"When you're first making films, you have to have the freedom to experiment," 
added Blakely, "or you won't learn anything at all." 
</P>
<P>
Although it lacks the glamour of more famous film schools such as USC and UCLA, 
Orange Coast has quietly been building a reputation for turning out students 
with a solid grasp of the technical side of movie and video making. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the film school in Orange County," Lewis said matter-of-factly. "We're 
the main game in town." It's only a 2-year program but, Lewis added, "it's 
totally hands-on." While the school also teaches film theory and appreciation, 
all students in the introductory courses have a camera thrust into their hands 
in the first week of class. 
</P>
<P>
After Blakely graduated from OCC, he went on to Art Center College in Pasadena 
but said he learned more in his 2 years at Orange Coast. "I went to Art Center 
for the degree only," the young film maker admitted. 
</P>
<P>
When Ruffier graduated from Orange Coast, he went straight to work. "I never 
went to any other schools because by the time I came out of Orange Coast 
College, I knew how to make a film," he said. 
</P>
<P>
These days, activity in Orange Coast's editing room is especially frenzied as 
students scramble for equipment, desperately working to finish their film and 
video projects in time for the school's upcoming festival. 
</P>
<P>
"I came back to do some editing the other night and there wasn't any room to 
stand in here," said Todd Williams, a beginning production student working on a 
video to enter in the annual event. 
</P>
<P>
Students have until Wednesday to turn in their entries. That's when the work 
begins for Lewis, who must choose from as much as 40 hours worth of 20-minute 
films to create a 2-hour program, to be presented Friday night in the school's 
Forum theater. 
</P>
<P>
This is the 19th festival in as many years for Lewis, who started the festival 
after arriving at Orange Coast from San Francisco State University. "The first 
year here (the film program) was kind of a meager offering," Lewis recalled. He 
also recalled 
</P>
<P>
how an annual festival created a focus for the program at San Francisco State. 
</P>
<P>
The approach to student projects at other film schools is often highly 
regimented, with each student responsible for just one aspect of a production. 
Each of Lewis' students is assigned his or her own full project and gets a 
taste of every aspect. "It's like throwing you in the water," said student Dan 
Buhler. "But it really does make you work." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis puts no constraints on style or content, which results in a wide variety 
of approaches. Colleagues have asked how he can view so many student films year 
after year; Lewis says that variety is what keeps him going. 
</P>
<P>
"It never ends, in terms of the creativity of the students," Lewis said. 
"There's been some great stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis screened two films from past festivals to prove his point. One was 
"Rabbit," a short by Keith Fialcowitz that went on to win awards in several 
international competitions. The highly polished film takes a humorous look at 
the way nature turns the tables on a bored driver during a lonely haul across 
the desert. 
</P>
<P>
"Horror Brunch," a slice of Grand Guignol humor in which a peaceful Sunday 
brunch turns into a blood bath, was done by Rik Carter, who has gone on to work 
special effects in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis also screened an early entry in this year's festival, "Under the 
Windowpane," a mature and sensitive look at a father coping with the suicide of 
his son. Mark W. Solter wrote, directed, produced and edited the film, with 
photography by S. Emmett Fahey and original music by Todd Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
Until 2 years ago, the festival accepted only films; now videos make up about 
half the entries. Where beginning production students once worked in super 8, 
now they use one of 15 video camcorders the school owns. 
</P>
<P>
That is partly a matter of convenience -- video is cheaper and easier to use 
than film -- and partly a recognition that most jobs are now in video. "You 
really need to have an insight into video production," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
The hands-on approach to teaching film relies heavily on having the right 
equipment, which Lewis has managed to assemble -- largely through donations and 
discounts -- at a time when community college budgets are notoriously tight. 
Film and video-editing equipment, a screening room, mixing equipment for film, 
and computers for graphics all are available to students. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis remains the program's only full-time instructor, and now he has been 
handed the school's studio production program as well. Film and video classes 
fill up within the first few days of registration, so Lewis would like to 
expand the offerings. "The only thing holding us back is the money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
About half the graduates of his program go on to 4-year colleges, Lewis said, 
while the other half go straight into the workplace. Of those, about half go 
into theatrical and commercial films and television, while the rest find work 
in Orange County's burgeoning production market, which is mostly focused on 
industrial videos. 
</P>
<P>
While Ruffier and Blakely took the independent route, largely for the creative 
freedom it offers, they are the exceptions. Former student Liz Ervin, like most 
of the graduates, works for others; a free-lance production assistant, she just 
finished work on "To the Limit," a new Imax film from Laguna Beach-based 
MacGillvray/Freeman Studios. 
</P>
<P>
In the next 2 weeks, Ervin will be releasing the second edition of her "Orange 
County Film/Video and Audio-Visual Resource Directory" which lists production 
and post-production facilities, recording studios, permit information and 
free-lance production people in the county. Its size -- 230 pages, up from 180 
last year -- indicates the growth and size of the production business here. 
</P>
<P>
Ervin was planning a career in social welfare when she took Lewis' introductory 
film production class to satisfy a general education requirement. She soon 
switched her major. "It changed the course of my career," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis' approach "weeds out the people who aren't serious," Ervin said. "If 
you're really interested, you put in a lot of effort. If you're not, you drop 
the class. It's a lot of work." 
</P>
<P>
Since graduating, Ervin has hired Orange Coast students to work on her 
productions, as have Ruffier and Blakely. "I've hired a few production 
assistants out of OCC, and it's worked out great," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast College's 19th annual Student Film and Video Festival takes place 
Friday at 8 p.m. in the Forum theater, 2701 Fairview Road, Costa Mesa. 
Admission: $2. Information: (714) 432-5629.

HIRING OF EX-GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS CITED; 
</P>
<P>
LINCOLN S&amp;L OWNER BUYS INFLUENCE, CRITICS CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was November, 1985, and Charlie Keating was perturbed. 
</P>
<P>
His company had bought Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine less than 2 years 
earlier, and federal regulators were trying to curtail his use of new state and 
federal laws that gave him wide discretion to invest S&amp;L money -- mainly 
customer deposits -- in an array of ventures. 
</P>
<P>
It was then that Keating offered a high-paying job to Edwin J. Gray, the 
nation's top S&amp;L regulator at the time. Gray turned the job down flat. A 
year later, he characterized it as a brazen attempt to "buy me out." 
</P>
<P>
Others were not as quick to reject Keating's overtures. Since purchasing 
Lincoln in 1984, the Phoenix financier has hired or retained at least a 
half-dozen former state and federal government officials, including the head of 
a regulatory team that was examining the thrift. Five years ago, he even 
retained prominent economist Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the President's 
Council of Economic Advisers who is now chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. 
</P>
<P>
Those hirings have become a major issue in the controversy surrounding Charles 
H. Keating Jr., chairman of American Continental Corp. 
</P>
<P>
On April 13, the Phoenix holding company filed for protection from creditors in 
federal bankruptcy court. The next day, Lincoln was seized by regulators, who 
claimed that the thrift was engaging in unsafe and unsound business practices. 
</P>
<P>
Critics claim that Keating has used his political connections and financial 
resources to buy influence in government circles. By contributing hundreds of 
thousands of dollars to elected officials and by hiring former state and 
federal agency officials to represent him, Keating kept regulators at bay while 
he mismanaged Lincoln's assets for his own benefit, critics allege. 
</P>
<P>
While the migration of government workers to positions in private industry is 
not unique to American Continental, "I'm seeing this pattern in a very great 
extreme with Lincoln," said Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va., industry consultant. 
</P>
<P>
In the words of one federal regulator in San Francisco, "Keating stands in a 
league of his own" when it comes to seeking political influence. 
</P>
<P>
Whether it has worked is subject to debate. 
</P>
<P>
"If he's trying to buy influence, he's wasted his money," said Roger Martin, 
one of the three members of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in Washington, 
which oversees the nation's federally insured savings and loans. Martin said 
he's never encountered any "political interference" as a board member. 
</P>
<P>
While Keating's campaign contributions may have gained him access to elected 
politicians, his employment decisions have not been based on political 
considerations, an American Continental spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"That is absolutely not the intent at all," said Mark M. Connally, the 
spokesman. Connally is the son of former Texas Gov. John B. Connally, whose 
unsuccessful campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in 1980 was 
managed by Keating at one point. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Connally said that Greenspan was retained at the suggestion of a 
New York law firm that American Continental had retained to fight proposed 
restrictions on the ability of thrifts to make direct investments in real 
estate. The law firm decided it needed an expert to render an opinion on the 
economic damage the restrictions would cause, he said, and Keating was not 
trying to capitalize on Greenspan's political prominence. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Coyne, a Federal Reserve Board spokesman, said Greenspan was not in 
government service at the time and was retained by Arthur L. Liman, the lawyer 
handling the matter for American Continental. 
</P>
<P>
Keating's political connections are being scrutinized as part of a lawsuit 
recently filed on behalf of 22,000 bondholders who may have lost more than $250 
million they invested in debt securities issued by American Continental. 
</P>
<P>
The suit claims that Keating and other directors and officers of American 
Continental perpetrated a "massive fraud" on unsuspecting, unsophisticated 
investors. Many had gone to Lincoln offices with the intention of placing their 
savings in insured certificates of deposits, but they were persuaded instead to 
buy uninsured bonds issued by American Continental, the suit claims. 
</P>
<P>
Connally said the company "absolutely denies" that it defrauded the 
bondholders. 
</P>
<P>
The suit is aimed at directors and officers, and the lawyers and accountants 
who advised them. It is being handled by two of the lawyers who won more than 
$70 million from advisers to convicted San Diego swindler J. David Dominelli, 
who bilked millions of dollars from investors. 
</P>
<P>
Keating and his cohorts, the suit alleges, tried to "cover their tracks and buy 
extra time" over the last 5 years by hiring or retaining former government 
officials who could use their connections to keep American Continental 
operating while the company sold more bonds. 
</P>
<P>
"Without the assistance of these and other paid professionals, the 
multimillion-dollar scheme alleged in this complaint would not have been 
possible," the suit states. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit names only one former government official -- Franklin Tom -- as a 
defendant. 
</P>
<P>
Tom was commissioner of the California Department of Corporations when American 
Continental obtained approval for a $200-million bond offering in December, 
1986. After leaving office in March, 1987, he returned to private practice with 
the Los Angeles law firm of Parker, Milliken, Clark, O'Hara &amp; Samuelian. 
</P>
<P>
In that capacity, he represented American Continental before the Department of 
Corporations, which was then headed by his former assistant, Christine Bender. 
She also had worked at the Los Angeles law firm, which is named as a defendant 
in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
"There are rules that govern the conduct of former state employees. Suffice it 
to say, I did not breach any of those rules," Tom said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have long represented clients at the Department of Corporations," he said. 
"Certainly, my having spent 4 years as commissioner enhanced my technical 
capability for later representing clients before the department. So it seems 
perfectly in order for me to do so." 
</P>
<P>
Tom said he had not been served with the lawsuit and could not comment on it. 
</P>
<P>
Other government officials hired or retained by Keating are not named as 
defendants in the suit. Except for Greenspan, the lawsuit identifies them only 
by their former positions. But Ronald Rus of Orange and Joseph W. Cotchett of 
Burlingame, the lawyers handling the suit, acknowledged that they are: 
</P>
<P>
* Lawrence Taggart, former commissioner of the California Department of Savings 
and Loan. On behalf of American Continental, Taggart lobbied state and federal 
lawmakers in an effort to kill restrictions on new powers that allowed S&amp;Ls 
to make direct investments in real estate ventures such as hotels, office 
buildings and residential developments. 
</P>
<P>
* John Rousselot, former U.S. congressman from San Gabriel who tried to buy 
Lincoln before regulators seized it. After leaving the presidency of an 
industry trade group last year, Rousselot was retained by American Continental 
as a consultant to help with industry relations and to find a buyer for 
Lincoln. Rousselot acknowledged that Keating -- like other Rousselot clients -- 
expected him to provide access and exercise influence with government 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
* A. Melvin McDonald, a former U.S. attorney in Phoenix. Since leaving his post 
in 1985, McDonald has handled legal work for American Continental, including an 
investigation into alleged leaks by regulators about confidential information 
on the condition of Lincoln. McDonald said Keating is "absolutely not" using 
him for any political purposes and called him the "most decent man I know." 
</P>
<P>
* Joseph Kotrys, head of a 1986 examination team from the Federal Home Loan 
Bank of San Francisco. Regulators in Washington threw out the team's report on 
Lincoln after it was completed in 1988 and stripped the San Francisco office of 
its supervisory responsibility for Lincoln. It is unclear what Kotrys' role in 
the audit had to do with Washington's action. Kotrys, who now works for Lincoln 
in Irvine handling regulatory compliance matters, said he approached Keating 
for a job last year, long after he had finished his part of the examination. He 
denied he was hired to exert influence with regulators, maintaining he had been 
"too low on the totem pole" to have much clout. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit also claims that one of the officials who helped buy time for 
American Continental was a "former administrative assistant" to a U.S. senator, 
an apparent reference to James Grogan, an American Continental staff lawyer who 
is named as a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
But Grogan's clout is questionable. He was never an administrative assistant. 
While in college, he worked as an intern for 5 months in 1975 in U.S. Sen. John 
Glenn's Washington office and later as an intern in one of the Democrat's Ohio 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also contends that Keating "enlisted the active assistance and 
intervention of many public officeholders." 
</P>
<P>
Those officeholders included five U.S. senators who met with regulators in 
April, 1987, to question a lengthy regulatory examination of Lincoln's books. 
The group consisted of Sens. Glenn, Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), John McCain 
(R-Ariz.), Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) and Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich). 
</P>
<P>
All five senators are from states in which American Continental and Lincoln 
operate. The five had received more than $300,000 in campaign contributions 
from Keating, his family and American and Lincoln executives. 
</P>
<P>
Riegle later returned the $76,000 he had been given, saying at the time that he 
wanted to avoid the appearance of a conflict since he was about to become 
chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. The other senators, or their aides, 
have said that they saw no potential conflicts and were simply helping a 
constituent. McCain, however, has expressed concern that the meeting might 
foster the appearance of impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
Keating also used his political influence to propose or support friends for top 
regulatory appointments. Connally said Keating pushed for the appointment of 
Atlanta lawyer Lee H. Hinkel Jr. to one of two seats on the three-member 
Federal Home Loan Bank Board in 1986. He also endorsed the nomination of George 
J. Benston, then a University of Rochester (N.Y.) finance professor, for the 
other seat. 
</P>
<P>
Hinkel was appointed in the fall of 1986 by President Ronald Reagan, even 
though he had acknowledged receiving $61.9 million in loans from Lincoln for 
his real estate company. But he quit in early 1987 amid conflict-of-interest 
charges after voting for a change in the real estate investment rules for 
S&amp;Ls. Regulators said Lincoln would have benefited from the change, which 
was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Benston's nomination was withdrawn. He had used funds from Keating to conduct 
research on the S&amp;L industry, and concluded that the direct investments in 
real estate that Keating favored were not the cause of the wave of S&amp;L 
failures. 
</P>
<P>
Keating also turned at times to the private sector to hire people in sensitive 
positions, the lawsuit claims. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, Keating recruited Jack Atchison from the national accounting firm 
of Arthur Young &amp; Co., then the company's independent auditor. Atchison was 
the partner in charge of American Continental's account. Several months after 
hiring Atchison, the company fired Arthur Young in a dispute over how to 
account for a stock swap. Atchison, Arthur Young and two other major accounting 
firms used by the company -- Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. and Touche, Ross &amp; 
Co. -- also are named as defendants in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Connally said none of the people identified in the suit were hired or retained 
for political reasons. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental already had retained the Parker Milliken firm before Tom 
returned to his old firm from the Department of Corporations. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving his government post, Taggart joined an old friend in a company 
partially owned by Lincoln. Since his views were similar to Keating's, he was 
"a natural" for American Continental to hire in the fight to maintain the rules 
on direct investments, Connally said. 
</P>
<P>
Keating's involvement with Greenspan and Benston arose from that same lobbying 
effort. The New York law firm retained Greenspan as an expert on the economic 
validity of the restrictions that regulators wanted to adopt. The law firm also 
brought in Benston to do an economic study that resulted in a monograph 
opposing the restrictions and validating the new powers. 
</P>
<P>
Connally said that Kotrys and Atchison came to Keating looking for a job 
because of their dissatisfaction with their previous jobs. Keating did not lure 
them into the company, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't stop people from saying what they want to say," Connally said. "But 
Charlie Keating was not buying influence."

UCI HIRES PR FIRM ON MEDICAL COST ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN and JEAN DAVIDSON, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a gloom-and-doom press conference last week, UC Irvine's new vice 
chancellor of health services opened an aggressive campaign to spotlight the 
financial hemorrhaging that threatens to close UCI Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Walter Henry, who is also dean of the UCI College of Medicine, believes 
that too many people think of the medical center as an ordinary public hospital 
instead of a top-notch teaching and research facility. 
</P>
<P>
So, faced with a projected operating loss of $13 million this year, Henry 
reached beyond the medical center's seven-member, $250,000-a-year public 
relations and marketing staff. 
</P>
<P>
He got permission to go around normal university hiring rules and awarded a 
$20,000, 3-month contract to a Newport Beach consulting firm headed by a woman 
with whom he had previously worked. Saying the medical center's crisis needed 
publicity and its image needed improvement, the consultant immediately 
announced a series of press conferences. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Burden Called 'Unfair' 
</P>
<P>
At the first of these last week, Henry said the medical center in Orange is 
suffering because federal, state and county governments inadequately finance 
insurance programs intended to provide hospitalization for the poor. The 
shortcomings, he said, have forced the 493-bed facility to play the role of a 
county hospital and shoulder an unfair burden. UCI has 6% of the hospital beds 
in Orange County but treats 50% of the poor. Apart from the financial strain 
that comes with treating indigents who cannot pay, UCI officials contend that 
the consequently heavy load of routine medical cases is undermining plans to 
develop the medical center into a major teaching hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to develop a consistent program that reflects the strength of the 
(UCI) College of Medicine as well as my plans for developing UCI Medical Center 
into a major academic hospital where research exists side by side with 
teaching," Henry said before the press conference. "We need help to develop 
that concept in terms of our internal perception and to communicate that vision 
to the community." 
</P>
<P>
Henry warned that the medical center could go bankrupt and close within 2 years 
if it continues to be flooded with indigent patients. And his straightforward 
comments were applauded throughout much of the medical community. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be a direct and discomforting approach to a lot of people," said David 
Langness, vice president of communications for the Hospital Council of Southern 
California. "But the fact is, it is the truth. 
</P>
<P>
"A record number of hospitals closed (in the nation) last year and Orange 
County is not immune to those problems. What it (Henry's public statement) does 
is communicate the severity of the problem and in so doing brings about 
action." 
</P>
<P>
David Paine, a Costa Mesa public relations executive who has several 
health-care industry clients, also praised what he called Henry's honesty. 
"When you talk about a potentially unpopular decision, sometimes it is better 
to be pro-active and explain why you are doing what you are doing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Confronting the Crisis' 
</P>
<P>
L. Wade Rose, assistant dean of community affairs and development at the UCI 
medical school, said: "What Walt is doing is confronting the crisis we have in 
medical reimbursement head-on. And he knows when he does that it will create a 
tremendous amount of concern among local, county and state governments as well 
as the general public." 
</P>
<P>
Advocates for the poor said the developments are worrisome. 
</P>
<P>
"My concern is poor people are going to be dumped and where are they going to 
go?" said Jean Forbath, a founder of Share Our Selves, a service organization 
that runs a free clinic in Costa Mesa. "We feel this would be a tragic 
development. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand UCI's position -- they are really in the hole," Forbath 
continued. "But there doesn't seem to be any suggested alternative." 
</P>
<P>
Henry, a research cardiologist who took the vice chancellor's post in March, 
went after professional help in delicately charting his public relations 
strategy. Days after he became vice chancellor and dean of the medical school, 
he hired a friend, Susan Meister, who has 25 years' experience in medical 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
Meister's Newport Beach public relations firm, Communicore, is working under a 
3-month consulting contract with the university. One of her jobs is to screen 
all calls from the press to Henry and to Mary A. Piccione, the medical center's 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Make Public Aware 
</P>
<P>
But Meister says she was primarily hired to draft a game plan that will 
emphasize the teaching and research functions of the medical center as an arm 
of the UCI College of Medicine and make the public aware of how they may be 
affected by the crisis in indigent care. 
</P>
<P>
"If UCI Medical Center closes down, there will be no academic medical center in 
Orange County," Meister said. "Academic medical centers are depended on to take 
care of the most complicated medical problems." 
</P>
<P>
"UCI is a victim, it's not a perpetrator" of the indigent-care crisis, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Meister said the amount of money her two-partner firm will be paid for the 
consulting work will depend on how many hours of work are involved. But she 
said she expects that the contract, which began in March and ends June 30, will 
be worth about $20,000, a sum that she said was reasonable and far less than 
she would charge a private corporation. 
</P>
<P>
Henry hired Meister's firm without going through the university's customary 
bidding process. Services expected to cost at least $15,000 must be bid, 
according to the policy, unless a candidate has expertise that cannot be 
duplicated. 
</P>
<P>
Leon Schwartz, UCI's vice chancellor for administrative and business services, 
said Henry persuaded him that Meister offered a unique combination of medical 
communications experience and knowledge of the university. "I thought it would 
be very appropriate to use her (services)," Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
Meister acknowledged that her professional friendship with Henry helped her 
firm hurdle the bidding process because Henry had gained confidence in her 
communication skills and understanding of the medical industry. Also, she said, 
as with most medical public relations consultants, she has considerable 
experience in "crisis management." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Variety of Positions 
</P>
<P>
Before Meister established her own public relations business in 1985, she held 
a variety of health-care industry positions, including vice president for 
medical affairs for Allergan Pharmaceuticals in Irvine, director of 
communications for the Edwards Division of American Hospital Supply in Irvine 
and vice president of Burson-Marsteller Inc.'s former health-care division in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Meister said she has known Henry since 1980, the year she joined Edwards, where 
Henry was a consultant on cardiovascular-imaging technology. Also, for the last 
5 years she has served on the board of directors of Medical Research and 
Education Society, a volunteer support group that raises funds for younger 
researchers at the UCI College of Medicine. This year she was elected president 
of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
Meister said UCI is only one of her firm's 15 clients. She said she is working 
for Henry only on a temporary basis while he reorganizes the public relations 
operations of the medical school and hospital. 
</P>
<P>
As part of that reorganization, Henry announced last week that he is seeking 
university authorization to create a new permanent position of assistant vice 
chancellor of health sciences in charge of public relations and fund raising 
for both the school and medical center. That person would report directly to 
him. He said Meister could be a candidate for the new position, although a 
hiring search would be conducted. 
</P>
<P>
Seven employees, including two clerical workers, already are on the payroll of 
the medical center's public affairs and marketing department. Salaries of the 
department, which handles news inquiries, special events and in-house 
publications, total $250,000 a year. A public information office on the UCI 
campus also has two employees who produce press releases on the College of 
Medicine's research, fund-raising and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
Neither UC San Diego nor UC Davis, which have hospitals comparable to UCI's, 
employ a top administration-level spokesman who reports directly to the 
overseer of those medical schools and teaching hospitals. But neither school 
faces the medical center's financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The medical center's financial position has severely eroded since fiscal 1986, 
when it posted a $772,000 operating gain as a result of cost cutting, officials 
said. Last year, the medical center posted a $8.6-million operating loss, and 
the operating loss this year is expected to reach $13 million. 
</P>
<P>
Since taking office in March, Henry has been playing hardball with government 
officials, beginning with a threat to withdraw from the Medi-Cal program if 
reimbursement rates are not improved. The university is negotiating a new 
Medi-Cal contract. Medi-Cal is the state's medical insurance for the indigent. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Henry said medical center belt-tightening efforts, which in 
the past included cutting staff, have been more than offset as the hospital's 
share of indigent patients has continued to expand and Medi-Cal reimbursements 
have fallen further behind costs. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we are in a situation where we realize the major problem is the very large 
burden of indigent care we are having to assume, and that burden has gotten 
much worse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The medical center reports receiving about 30 cents in reimbursement for every 
dollar spent to treat patients on Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
"We are simply trying to communicate the issues as strongly as possible," Henry 
said. "We are trying to help the public understand the issues as we see them 
and the implications of various actions." 
</P>

UC MEDICAL CENTER BUDGETS 
</P>
<P>
The following is a comparison of public affairs and marketing budgets for 
medical centers at UC Irvine, UC Davis and UC San Diego. Among the five UC 
hospitals, these three are most alike because all formerly were county 
hospitals, are major centers for the care of poor patients and are affiliated 
with a general campus.*

TRANSIENTS MAY HAVE STARTED BLAZE AT ABANDONED ANAHEIM ELKS LODGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BEENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fire that may have been caused by transients swept through the abandoned 
Anaheim Elks Lodge early Saturday, causing thousands of dollars in damage but 
no injuries, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A transient woman, identified as April Brown, was found inside the building 
when firefighters arrived but was not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
The exact cause of the blaze was not immediately known, but investigators said 
the old, three-story building at the corner of North Anaheim Boulevard and 
Sycamore Street could have caught fire if transients had been cooking or 
smoking in the structure. 
</P>
<P>
Built in the early 1900s, the massive, white-columned Elks Lodge was closed 
about 10 years ago and has been vacant ever since. Though boarded up to keep 
people out, officials said transients and homeless people had been known to 
make their way inside the building in search of shelter. 
</P>
<P>
When 16 Anaheim fire units responded to the blaze at 6:30 a.m., Battalion Chief 
Ron Hamric said, the interior of the building was engulfed in flames. When a 
back door was opened, Hamric said, Brown stumbled out, scared but apparently 
not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'There Might Have Been Others' 
</P>
<P>
"She told us she had been staying there," Hamric said. "She was a transient. 
There might have been others there, we're not sure. She left and now we're not 
sure where she is." 
</P>
<P>
Hamric said it took firefighters 90 minutes to bring the fire under control, 
but by that time the entire southwest portion of the interior, the old ballroom 
area, was gutted. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that we probably lost, due to fire damage, less than a third of 
the building," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is still under investigation and probably will be for some time," he added. 
"The owners of the building will have to secure or demolish that section that 
received the major damage. At that time, our investigator will be on the scene 
to see what kind of physical evidence there is. 
</P>
<P>
"The structure is just too unstable to put any of our people in there right 
now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
By late afternoon, workers were replacing the long plywood boards covering the 
entrances to the building. 
</P>
<P>
Hamric said officials had been concerned about what could happen if the 
long-vacant building caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an old building and at the north end alone there are 20 separate rooms, 
like a maze," he said. "I've been here 22 years and we have been concerned 
about that building for years, because of the way it was built."

TRUSTEES OK ACTION TO DISCIPLINE STRIKERS AT ANAHEIM SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MITCHELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bracing for a threatened strike, trustees of Anaheim Union School District 
moved Saturday to punish teachers who participate with loss of salary or 
disciplinary action and to hire up to 700 substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
The action came 1 day after a union representing 900 teachers in the district 
voted overwhelmingly to stage a 1-day strike Wednesday to protest stalled 
contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
School officials reaffirmed their plans to keep schools open despite the 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
The five board members, along with most of the district's ranking 
administrators, gathered at district headquarters in the unusual emergency 
meeting Saturday morning. One key decision makes it extremely difficult for 
regularly employed teachers to take a sick or personal day off during the 
walkout. 
</P>
<P>
"We took these measures basically to tighten up on our policies and to prepare 
for the strike. We do not expect that this (union) action will result in any 
disruption of the educational process," said Leroy L. Kellogg, assistant 
superintendent for administrative services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deficit Cited 
</P>
<P>
Teachers, whose salaries range from $21,000 to $42,000 annually, are demanding 
an immediate 3.2% wage increase. The district, facing declining enrollments and 
claiming to have run a multimillion-dollar deficit last school year, has 
offered wage rates based on its total budget, with no specific increases 
guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
With the board's approval Saturday, teachers who would normally be allowed to 
use a sick day or take a leave of personal necessity will now be required to 
fully document their absence, such as by providing a note from a physician. 
</P>
<P>
The board decided that requests for leave must be made directly to the 
district's assistant superintendent for personnel services, rather than local 
principals. 
</P>
<P>
"What these resolutions say is that we are simply not authorizing leaves (for 
the day of the strike) unless they have valid (reasons.) The resolution states 
that they (teachers without authorized absences) will face either a loss of 
salary or disciplinary procedures or both," Kellogg said. 
</P>
<P>
The head of the Anaheim Secondary Teachers Assn., Leonard Lahtinen, said the 
board actions were not unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Respect for Teachers' 
</P>
<P>
"That would be standard operating procedure for them," said Lahtinen. "They 
have little or no respect for teachers as it is. Why should they start now?" 
</P>
<P>
The last contract between the union and the district expired last August. 
Despite the attempts of a state mediator, the two sides have failed to reach 
any agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Kellogg said the salary dispute is based upon different perceptions of whether 
or not the district, which is facing continually declining enrollments and 
worsening deficits, can afford the demands of the teachers. 
</P>
<P>
The last offer made by the district would hold teacher salaries for the next 
school year to the same proportion of the total budget as this year -- after a 
reserve fund of 2.5% is set aside. Any money left over would be given to the 
teachers in the form of salary increases, up to a total of 5%. 
</P>
<P>
In the following year, there would be salary increases after a 3% reserve fund 
was established, with a maximum salary increase of 8%. 
</P>
<P>
The union is demanding 3.2% salary increase for this year, in addition to 41% 
of what is left after the 2.5% reserve is set aside.

<P>
A motorist died after he slammed his speeding car into the rear of a truck on 
the San Diego Freeway early Saturday and became trapped as the car caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
The man was driving south on the freeway near Seal Beach Boulevard in a 1981 
Dodge station wagon about 4:40 a.m. when he ran into an International Harvester 
truck driven by Dennis Sam, 38, of Long Beach. Sam was unhurt.

Sgt. Don Hulen of the California Highway Patrol said that the victim, described 
as "in his 50s," was driving at a "high rate" of speed when his car hit the 
truck.

VICTIM OF FREAK AUTO ACCIDENT DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 80-year-old woman, critically injured when she was struck by an unoccupied 
automobile at a Tustin bus stop, died at United Western Medical Center-Santa 
Ana on Saturday, Tustin police reported. 
</P>
<P>
The accident Thursday in the 13800 block of Red Hill Avenue near El Camino Real 
occurred after Barbara Greland, 45, of Santa Ana left her 1967 Mustang at a 
Mobile service station to get directions. The car, left idling, slipped into 
reverse and moved slowly backward, hitting Aletta Streeter, who was sitting on 
a bus bench. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin Police Officer Bryan Meder said the woman died at 2 p.m. Saturday at the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Meder said that the car had slipped into reverse, but how it did so is not 
known. He said the car was shifted into park when the woman got out of the 
auto. 
</P>
<P>
After the car struck the elderly woman, it continued onto Red Hill Avenue where 
it hit a northbound vehicle. No one was injured in that collision.

CYPRESS RALLIES WITH 5 IN THE NINTH TO WIN TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Twice in the past week, Cypress College got some unexpected help in its quest 
for the Orange Empire Conference baseball title. And it looked for eight 
innings Saturday as if the Chargers might need another favor. 
</P>
<P>
But Cypress staged a five-run rally in the ninth inning to defeat Fullerton, 
6-4, at Cypress and win the title on the final day of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress tied it, 4-4, on a two-run home run by Mitch Kaylor and won it on a 
two-run home run by Jason Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
The inning started when Mike Scott was walked by Trevor Paintor. Terry Tewell 
then doubled off the right-field fence, leaving runners at second and third and 
bringing up Kaylor. 
</P>
<P>
Painter got two quick strikes, but threw a wild pitch, allowing Scott to score 
and cutting the lead to 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
Kaylor worked the count full, then lofted a breaking pitch off the scoreboard, 
just above the left-field fence for a two-run home run. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just trying to put the ball in play," Kaylor said. "With my power, I 
can't tell if anything is out. I was just running." 
</P>
<P>
Paintor was replaced by Mark Rogers, who got Steve Gill to ground to first, but 
the ball got away from Greg Gistlinck for an error. Friedman then drove the 
ball well over the center-field fence for the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking to go to dead center," Friedman said. "He threw me my pitch -- a 
knee-high fastball -- and I just drove it." 
</P>
<P>
Cypress (31-13 overall and 17-7 in conference play) started last week a game 
behind Rancho Santiago. But Rancho Santiago was upset by last-place Riverside 
Tuesday and Golden West Thursday. Cypress beat Golden West Thursday to move 
into a tie and topped Saddleback Thursday to take over first. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago (27-15, 16-8) defeated Saddleback, 5-3, Saturday to finish in a 
tie for second with Orange Coast. Had Cypress lost, Rancho Santiago, OCC 
(29-11-1, 16-8) and Cypress would have finished in a three-way tie for first. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first conference championship for Cypress Coach Scott Pickler in 
his four seasons at the school and the first for Cypress since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
But until the ninth, a championship didn't appear likely. The Chargers 
struggled for seven innings against Fullerton starter Will Barber. Fullerton 
(12-27, 7-17) scored single runs in the first and second and two more in the 
seventh for a 4-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Lodding started for Cypress and allowed two runs in 2 1/3 innings. He was 
replaced by Jeff Patterson, who allowed two unearned runs on three hits and 
struck out nine in the final 6 2/3 innings. He raised his record to 9-3. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress will have 13 days off until the first round of the Southern California 
Regionals. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago 5, Saddleback 3 -- Jack Bailey (11-4) pitched seven innings for 
the victory for visiting Rancho Santiago. Marty Neff and Tim Reynolds had two 
hits and two RBIs each for Rancho Santiago. Derek Gingerich hit a home run for 
Saddleback (16-18-1, 8-15-1). 
</P>
<P>
Golden West 4, Riverside 1 -- Todd Long (6-1) allowed eight hits, struck out 
five and walked none, for his third complete game of the season. Ken Lynch 
drove in two runs to lead Golden West (21-14-1, 15-9) Riverside is 7-26-1 and 
4-19-1.

PHEBUS HAS TO RALLY TO WIN HER THIRD TITLE IN 3 MONTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Top-seeded Keri Phebus overcame a strong challenge from Kim Shasby in the 
Seventeen Magazine Tennis Tournament of Champions Saturday to win the 
16-and-under division title, 2-6, 6-2, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
But winning has become a familiar story for the Newport Beach 15-year old. The 
victory in Mission Viejo gave Phebus her third tournament title of the year. 
She also won the Easter Bowl in Miami in March and the Long Beach Juniors in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
To win Saturday, however, Phebus had to survive a scare from Shasby. 
</P>
<P>
"I was giving her a lot of short balls and she hits very hard, but once I got 
momentum, I knew I had the match," Phebus said. 
</P>
<P>
Shasby's presence in the final was a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
She was not among the seeded entrants for the 96 junior draw. Just because her 
hometown of North Liberty, Iowa, isn't a hotbed of tennis doesn't mean she 
hasn't been noticed. 
</P>
<P>
Shasby, well-known in the Midwest, where she's the Missouri Valley's No. 
1-ranked player in 16s, stepped out of the shadows at a national tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the best tournament of my life," said Shasby, who beat three seeded 
players. "Or close to it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the first finals of a national-caliber tournament I've been in. It was 
exciting for me just to be there (in the finals)," she said. 
</P>
<P>
One could almost expect that kind of statement from a kid who is so genuinely 
amicable she frequently congratulates opponents' shots and says, "Sorry" when 
she returns faulted serves. But when Phebus, ranked fourth in the Southern 
California Tennis Assn., had a troublesome first set in which she blew a 
two-game advantage, Shasby was not too polite to capitalize. 
</P>
<P>
Shasby broke Phebus' serve twice and Phebus double-faulted twice, the second 
time at match point. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in the tank," Phebus said of her first-set performance. "It's good that 
I was (struggling) because I overcame and did enough to win the match. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew if I could stay in the rallies and keep it deep she'd make an error 
sooner or later." 
</P>
<P>
Shasby, ranked 32nd nationally, admitted she let down after winning the first 
set. 
</P>
<P>
"I was satisfied with one set," she said. "I relaxed. I gave her an inch, and 
she ran away with it and didn't let me back in the match after that." 
</P>
<P>
Phebus steadily built momentum by breaking Shasby's serve twice and holding 
service to take a 3-0 lead in the second set. 
</P>
<P>
"I started pumping myself up going into the second set," Phebus said. "I said, 
'You're not going to lose this,' and I knew I had the ability to win. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I played well at all," Phebus said, "I just won the key points." 
</P>
<P>
In the two other finals, Audra Keller of Memphis, Tenn., defeated Angelica 
Gavaldon of Coronado, 6 -3, 6-2, for the 18-and-under title. In the 14s, Nicole 
London of Rolling Hills Estates defeated Chanda Rubin of Lafayette, La., 6-4, 
4-6, 6-2.

JAPAN TRANSFORMING ITS RUST BELT INTO HIGH-TECHNOLOGY CENTER

KITAKYUSHU, Japan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former steelworkers in the western industrial town of Kitakyushu are growing 
flowers and building a new amusement park as the area struggles to return to 
prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
Steel plants on Japan's Kyushu Island are suffering amid a strong yen and 
intense foreign competition, but civic planners are determined to save Japan's 
Rust Belt with an infusion of high technology. 
</P>
<P>
Steel and heavy-machinery plants throughout Kyushu Island are losing steam in 
the current climate. Unemployment is twice the 2.3% national average and 
government planners are toiling to tempt young workers to stay in the area. 
</P>
<P>
But civic authorities have heeded former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's 
emphasis on local autonomy and are pulling cities up by their own bootstraps. 
The Fukuoka Prefecture is now planning a shift from heavy industry to high 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
"The figures do not look good for Fukuoka right now, but we are working to 
redesign our industry structure," said Kiyo Kuroishi, chief of planning for the 
prefecture. "Until now, the central government would take the initiative. The 
mentality now is for each region to think seriously about what it wants to do." 
</P>
<P>
For example, Kitakyushu, a port city with more than 1 million people and 
dominated by Nippon Steel, will be rescued by imitating Pittsburgh's revival, 
city planners said. Pittsburgh, the United States' steel-making center, has 
been attracting high-technology business and research. 
</P>
<P>
Kitakyushu's planners have formed a key eight-member civic group to tackle 
topics such as industry development and city identity. 
</P>
<P>
"In general, Kitakyushu has the image of being dark," said Masahiko Fukami of 
the Kitakyushu Prosperity Enrichment Council. "We are trying to change 
completely its identity and make it a beautiful, modern city." 
</P>
<P>
Nippon Steel's Yawata Works, built in 1901 and once Japan's largest steel 
operations, has seen employment drop to 11,000 from a postwar high of 43,000 
workers and 10 blast furnaces in the early 1960s. The number will soon drop to 
under 10,000 workers through attrition and redeployment, said spokesman Kosuke 
Sato. No one has been fired. 
</P>
<P>
Nippon Steel, like its Japanese rivals, has spent 2 years slashing production 
and setting up new businesses that include plant engineering, communications 
and biotechnology. Of Nippon Steel's 60,000-strong work force, 12,000 are now 
in a new business or joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
Nippon predicts that non-steel business, now accounting for only 5% of total 
sales, will reach 40% by 1995. To achieve this target, many steelworkers in 
Kitakyushu are retraining for new careers. 
</P>
<P>
Yoshimasu Kokanemaru, 48, once worked on the docks but now tends orchids in 
four Nippon greenhouses on a hill overlooking the last remaining blast furnace, 
giving up a higher-paying shift job to cultivate his favorite hobby. 
</P>
<P>
The prefecture is also investing in Nippon's Spaceworld, a 20-billion yen 
($155-million) amusement park/space education center on the grounds of the 
Yawata Works. Spaceworld, due to open in 1990, will employ 200 full-time and 
500 part-time workers, hiring from the region, Sato said. 
</P>
<P>
Prefecture leaders are optimistic that the region will attract technological 
investment, boost scientific educational programs and keep home-grown talent at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
In a rare move among Japan's 47 prefectures, Fukuoka has budgeted 1 billion yen 
($7.7 million) for a science and technology endowment to finance projects by 
local companies, said Kuroishi.
